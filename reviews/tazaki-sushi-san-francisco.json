I drive all the way from across the city to eat here at least once a month. Personally I love all of their Maki rolls, especially the specialty ones that would fetch a 50% mark up back on the other side of town! Most of the specialty rolls are under $10. Personally favorite is the Volcano roll- A California roll with salmon on top, and a spicy sauce and a sweet aioli. The gyoza is also excellent and comes with a spicy soy sauce. \n\nBest of all, the service is quick, efficient, and friendly, with complimentary tea and edamame.", "author": "Tim Y."}

But everything I'm about to say is true.\n\nTazaki is a well-known neighborhood institution, which usually hits the mark with fresh fish and flavorful food.\n\nThey have very reasonable prices for all of their items. \n\nLast night I decided to try something new, and I got the tazaki house clams. This was about $15 and had probably 18 to 20 clams in it. It was a tasty thick soy-based sauce, chock full of onions and some pieces of garlic.\n\nI had already eaten a huge lunch so I didn't eat very much of my food. I sat there talking to my friend for a long time and then I asked the waiter for a to-go container.\n\nInstead of him bringing me out of to-go container he brought my bowl of clams to the back. Then he brought me back a half pint plastic container filled with my leftovers. Or so I thought...\n\nI just opened up the leftovers container and what did I find within it? THREE CLAMS. Literally THREE CLAMS. \n\nThe rest was just the sauce and onions. I double checked with my friend to make sure I wasn't going crazy and she said she remembered as clear as day that I had approximately half of my clams left.\n\nI love clams, and I'm positive since I was looking directly at my dish between my friend and I the entire dinner, that I know how many clams were left. That means that the waiter kept almost three quarters of my remaining clams! \n\nWell, that's my story. I'm irritated, but also kind of in disbelief.", "author": "Grizzle J."}

Welp, look no further. This will be your neighborhood sushi spot. Tbh, best bang for your buck sushi spot in the avenues!It's honestly my go-to whenever I'm craving some regular wknight sushi, but don't want to pay an arm and a leg for it. And this is def not the most authentic sushi spot by any means (Chinese-run). But the food quality is good for what it is. \n\nBe warned. The restaurant runs small, they take a ton of to-go orders, and seating can take a little longer if you come at peak hrs. I've waited 20+mins before. But, they're also pretty efficient as soon as you're seated. Edamame and hot teas/water come out within mins. \n\nMy go-to dishes here typically vary btw a fish special (love the sea bass), clam ramen (TONS of clams), 49er roll (salmon, lemon, scallops...none of that fake crab crap), sunset roll (uni!!), various nigiris (toro, amaebi, uni, etc), and sashimi salad (this is MASSIVE). I've never had anything here that's disappointed me. I personally don't like my rolls or salads overdressed so I do ask for either no sauce or sauce on the side. My last visit, I forgot to ask and my salad was def overdressed. Other than that, everything was great. \n\nExpect to spend $35-$40pp. Will continue to return! 4 stars.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Found Tazaki Sushi on Yelp and it seemed promising. \n\nI opted for the chirashi since the presentation looked pretty impressive. They put a lot of thought into the execution, but unfortunately the chirashi itself was average/mediocre. They were very generous with the fish, I will give them that. \n\nFish quality is what you would expect from an average casual sushi restaurant. There are a ton of other affordable spots in the city that serve better quality fish. The biggest disappointment was the uni, which I had to spit out upon first taste. It did NOT taste right and I'm positive I would have gotten sick from it. The sushi rice was so mushy, I could have picked up a huge chunk of it with my chopsticks. \n\nTo add salt to the wound, the menu displays prices if you pay with cash.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-03-30", "description": "I'd like to preface this review by saying that before I started writing reviews on Yelp, I've had great experiences here. Yesterday was not one of them.\n\nMy fiance and I came at 5:30 P.M. on a Thursday evening and had dinner sitting in the tatami mat area, which was neat. We've been wanting to come here for weeks for the sake steamed clams that we were craving, and were disappointed to find out that they had been sold out. We ordered the sizzling walu, creamy roll, and Romeo and Juliet roll. I've only ever had walu as sashimi and not cooked, so we asked the waitress how the sizzling walu is. She gave us this weird look and said it was good, and threw up her hands as if saying \"I mean, what do you want me to say?\". I wanted to know how the taste, texture, maybe even portion compare with the other sizzling fish options. And it's okay if all she said was that the fish was good, but I could have skipped on the attitude.\n\nThe creamy roll was described on the menu as being \"deep fried scallop and spicy tuna\". We thought that it meant that only the scallop was deep fried, not the entire roll. Since I don't like cooked and warm sushi rolls, I wasn't a fan of this or the mayo that was on top of it. \nThe Romeo and Juliet roll was amazing, however. The blue fin tuna and salmon were slightly seared, and the tuna deliciously melted in my mouth. The scallop was very fresh as well. We would definitely order this again.\n\nWhen the sizzling fish came out, it was incredibly dry and the fish was a rough texture. It was actually pretty terrible. I was so surprised because walu is a really buttery fish when raw, but since I had never had cooked walu, I didn't know what to expect. Taste was good though, and because of this, my fiance and I were eating the bean sprouts more than we were eating the fish itself. When another waitress stopped by our table to ask us if everything was okay, I told her this and she just apologized and left. And that was okay, since I wasn't asking to have the dish switched or replaced - I was just being honest when she asked me how my food was. When the bill came, I saw on the receipt that the fish order that was put in was actually HALIBUT. That explained a lot, and we brought it up to the attention of a waitress. She apologized and seemed to want to leave it at that, so I asked her what she was going to do about this. She came back with the menu and showed me that the prices were the same, as if to say that since we weren't being charged more than the original item that we had ordered, it was no big deal. But the point is that we were not given what we had ordered, and what we were given was bad - if the halibut had been great, we would have definitely let it slide. She then tried to push making another sizzling walu dish for us, but we were full at this point and didn't want to wait for the kitchen to make a to-go order for us. Finally, she said she'd just take the item off the bill.\n\nThe waiter at the restaurant was great about refilling our teas and giving us two ice creams. Our dinner overall wasn't terrible and we still had an enjoyable time, but besides the Romeo and Juliet roll, the food was very subpar, we were given the wrong entree, and I didn't feel like it was a priority of the staff to address customer concerns or questions. There was a loud constant chopping sound from the kitchen that was a little bothersome. On top of all this, there was a sign on our table saying that all menu prices were \"cash discount prices\", and that meals not paid with cash would be subject to an extra fee - I've never been to a place that does this, and it was off-putting.", "author": "Nicole M."}

For three people, a bunch of nigiri, a few special rolls, a couple cups a tea and a couple orders of matcha ice cream, the total comes to around $85 after tax and tip.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-05", "description": "TL;DR - Tazaki reminds me of a less glamorous, slightly cheaper (in price) version of Sakesan. The pieces of nigiri are HUGE, but there's nothing special about it other than that. Prices were an average $4/piece of nigiri, which is a steal! I admit I'm a bit of a sushi snob, but for those who aren't Tazaki is great bang for your buck for fresh sushi. \n\nThe boyfriend and I stopped by Tazaki on a Sunday afternoon and was seated at the bar. Overall, the service was good and the server checked in on us 1 or 2 times while we were there.\n\nFor nigiri we had maguro, hamachi, kanpachi, tai, medai, hirame, walu, albacore and shima aji. I'm okay at identifying types of fish when I'm just handed a plate of nigiri, but I really couldn't tell between the hirame, tai, shima aji, and kanpachi....Which made me feel like they may have given me 2 types of nigiri vs 4, who knows! The slices of fish on each nigiri were gigantic! You could've easily made double (maybe even triple...) the nigiri had the fish been sliced thinner. The fish tasted fresh but was too warm XP... The rice was also warm, overcooked and didn't have enough vinegar. Because the cuts of fish were so thick and because there were no special garnishes or sauces used, I could taste the fishiness for a few nigiri -- chewing on that was borderline gross. \n\nWe also ordered the Sky Roll, which I believe had tuna, albacore and walu and was topped with wasabi tobiko. Not a bad roll. Rolls were reasonable priced, with most under $10 before tax. \n\nWe also got the Eclipse nigiri ($8 or so), which is rice wrapped with tuna and then topped with a quail egg and 2 types of tobiko. Meh, nothing special here. I expected more flavor, but it was very one-dimensional (texture-wise too).\n\nI ordered The Spoon (oyster, quail egg, uni, tobiko + sauce, $7 or so) to try and uggggggggh. It was way too fishy tasting, like I licked a fish I just fished out of the ocean x__X!! I haven't had too many of these spoon/shooter-type things, but the ones I have tried use ponzu. This one...I don't even know what it was...Ponzu gone bad? Ponzu mixed with soy sauce? Whatever it was, it did nothing to help with the fishiness or enhance the flavors. AVOIDAVOIDAVOID if you don't like fishiness. \n\nFor the mini feast we got, it was about $70 after tax and tip! And this is because we (meaning me) over-ordered. It easily could've been $20 cheaper had I practiced some self-control (NONEXISTENT when I'm hungry and holding a menu ho ho ho). \n\nThe bottom line? I won't be back because I enjoy my nigiri made with more care and skill. However, I'd definitely recommend to those who enjoy sushi and aren't as picky as I am.", "author": "Doris K."}

They changed the way they served it from the first time I tried it here. It's usually supposed to be baked on an aluminum foil but this time it was just served in a row on a plate.

It's more affordable here compared to other sushi places since the rolls are cheaper (priced at under $10) but they do offer only 6 pieces instead of 8. \n\nTHE SPOON! I was always curious about uni and frankly, I still am today since I couldn't really tell what uni tasted like since I slurped the whole spoon up. Can someone please invent the LADLE instead? A spoon just is too small. The Spoon comes with uni, oyster, quail egg, and tobiko. After eating it in one slurp, I tasted mostly oyster in the beginning with the egg at the end. It was delicious and I wish I had ten more spoons OR LADLES of those. \n\n#23 Sashimi combo stated that it had 16 pieces but we counted 20! There were five different kinds of sashimi and each had four pieces. Big slices with a thicker cut. \n\nChirashi bowl is beautiful. On a bed of rice, from the center clockwise, you have tamago (egg), ebi (shrimp), hamachi (yellowtail), lemon slices, sake (salmon), ikura (salmon roe), uni (sea urchin) on top of a shiso leaf, walu (Hawaiian butterfish), avocado, maguro (tuna), with hirame (halibut) shaped like a rose in the center. \n\nThis place can get busy really quickly at dinner hour. We were lucky and came here right when it opened so we were able to get the cool seats in the back by the window. You have to take off your shoes but you can sit on the floor on the mats. The chair is quite comfortable but could be hard to figure out where to put your legs for the most comfortable position. \n\nService-wise, they are nice and friendly but could be hard to flag them down since there is only maybe 1 or 2 servers and they're busy trying to serve everyone.", "author": "Diana C."}

The interior is small yet cozy and dinner time is consistently packed, mostly with locals who know where to go for good fresh sushi.\n\nWe ended up ordering several items from their nigiri (maguro, shrimp, toro) menu on top of their sashimi combo plate, which came arranged with vibrant colors and interesting textures in mind.  My favorite slice of fish are maguro (tuna), Hamachi, toro, and salmon.  The nigiri presentation is good in that the rice is not too thick (something I'm not a big fan of) so the flavor of the fresh fish is apparent and not washed out by the inordinate amount of starch.  In addition to sashimi/sushi offerings, the menu lists an extensive array of udon/ramen, bento boxes, as well as appetizer items for those that are unable to consume too much rice.\n\nPrices are competitive and typical of Japanese food pricing with nigiri ranging from $4 - $20, depending on the portions and plating preferences.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-12", "description": "NO JAPANESE SERVICE HERE! Why? Well, because it is Chinese owned and I guess they do not understand the authentic nuances of a REAL Japanese sushi restaurant.\n\nFirst, if you sit at the counter, the chef should at least acknowledge you there. He is there to serve you. That is why you choose the counter over a table. Here at Tazaki, they are too busy to even look up. Next, I should have known from the start when sitting at the bar, you are given an order sheet to make your sushi selections. WTH?!?? Isn't the whole point of sitting at the sushi bar so that you get personalized service from the sushi chef that is right in front of you? The chef is there to cater to your needs and to see how you react with each piece of sushi that you eat. He is there to adjust the next selection upon how you reacted to your current taste. Instead, we had to wait 45 minutes before we received any sushi. Yes, at the Tazaki sushi bar, you are treated like any other table whether it be a table for 10 and your party at the counter is only 3.\n\nThird, the chefs do not know how to make nigiri properly. It may look ok, but if the fish falls off the rice when you try to pick it up, what is the use? Plus, their rice doesn't taste like sushi rice, but just plain rice. Also, the cuts are a mish-mash of shapes. Heck, you have pictures right on the counter (to show the customers), so why not at least cut the fish like it? Instead of the long rectangular cuts that cover the fish length wise, we got all sorts of weird rectangle-ish cuts, meaning that they don't cut the fish blocks properly to begin with. This is to save $$ and maximize profit. Japanese first \"eat with your eyes\" and well, if you need to cut the fish and there is some leftover in order to make it look presentable, then that is how REAL Japanese restaurants do it!\n\nForth, who runs out of beer on a Sunday? If you are out of your \"special\" that is on the board, why not delete it? I feel that if you are not Chinese, then you don't get proper service. My beer selection suddenly \"ran out\" even after the waitress told me they had it. The Caucasian customer next to me had an item on his order also \"sold out\" but it looked like another Chinese customer at the bar (that seemed to know the owner really well) got the order filled. Hmmmm...\n\nThe fish quality is not bad. But don't order the maguro which is previously frozen!\n\nIts too bad, this place could be a great find, as the location is outside of the packed Irving Street area. However, we won't be coming back. If you expect real Japanese service, go elsewhere.", "author": "Mark M."}

One waitress finally walked over and asked us how many were in our party. We were then promptly directed to the bar for our seats. \n\nI like sitting at the bar because I get to watch all of the action in how the chef prepares the sushi. Also it kills time when waiting for the food to come! It got super busy and the waitresses were constantly telling the chef that numerous tables were complaining that the sushi was taking too long. Not once did the chef complain! He kept on cranking out those rolls like a sushi making machine! \n\nAs it got busier, I'm glad I chose to sit at the bar because it was like free entertainment as I got to watch the waitresses go back and forth, talking about their own drama and communicating with the chef on which rolls go to which table. There was one instance where one waitress brought back a roll that the sushi chef made wrong and the sushi chef said told the waitress to let the table keep the sushi as he prepared the correct roll for them. How nice! \n\nThe boyfriend and I both ended up ordering the 16 piece sashimi combo which was priced at 18.95. It also came miso soup, rice, and ice cream at the end! Now you would think at that price that the quality of the fish would be questionable... It was actually pretty fresh! \n\nThe sashimi were 4 slices each of salmon, red tuna, white tuna, hamachi. The chef threw in an extra four slices of halibut free of charge! Presentation was very pretty! In addition to that, he also gave us a small plate of tuna poke while we waited for our sashimi combo to arrive.

After 40 minutes, we were seated in the tatami.\n\nThere are 5 different servers, and they randomly serve the various tables.  None take ownership for any one table, so the service is awful.  Took us 20 minutes after being seated for someone to take our order - and that someone was actually one of the kitchen staff!  After taking our order, nothing.... no food.... no extra tea/water... no attention for 50 minutes!  Did I mention we ordered two appetizers?\n\nPeople who were seated after us had already finished half their meal!  After 50 minutes, I talked to the head waitress, and her excuses were:  (1) there was a large party, which was seated after us by the way, and (2) there were a lot of to go orders.  She went to the back to check, came back out, and then told me they just started cooking my order!  Well gee whiz!  I wonder how long they would have taken if I hadn't said anything.\n\nIn the end, one hour after getting seated, we finally get... our appetizer (grilled squid).  Yes, we had to wait even longer after that for... ramen.  Are you kidding me?  Total wait time for the order to be completed was 1 hour and 10 minutes.\n\nI see some key problems with their operation, consistent with all the bad reviews you see on yelp.\n\n1)  There are 5 serving staff, but none are assigned sole responsibility for a \"section\" or \"table\".  You'll be served by at least 3-4 different people to seat you, take the order, serve the food (when it finally arrives), give you the check, etc.  If you think that each person is assigned a specific task, you'd be wrong.  They all do it all, and they do it so randomly that their service is grossly inconsistent.  Plus, when you ask them about your order, they don't follow up because they don't know who took the order in the first place, or what the order was.\n\n2)  They don't prioritize eat-in orders over to go orders.  You've waited 40 minutes, show up at the restaurant, ready to give a tip, and they don't prioritize you in person over someone who phones in an order, and isn't even guaranteed to show up to pick it up?  That's just BAD.", "author": "Bryant W."}

I don't expect much of sushi restaurants especially when I haven't heard or read about it (quite nitpicky about fish being fresh) - but I'm glad I've had a chance to try it now since their fish was fresh and priced fairly!\n\nLocation - near the beach - convenient as its right by the N line, parking isn't too bad around this area.\n\nRestaurant - small, clean restaurant, fits maybe 30 people max? Doesn't seem like it gets SUPER busy. They have 2 tables where you can sit traditionally on the floor :)! I wanna do that next time. Fairly quiet and fit for a casual dinner.\n\nService - attentive and quick.. they checked on us and refilled our tea regularly. (Then again I came on a Tuesday so it wasn't busy either.)\n\nFood - Fresh and decent portions! Good fish to rice ratio, I'd ideally have liked a bit more vinegar in the rice, but not bad at all. For a sushi restaurant in the Outer Sunset, I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of fish.\n\nThe spoon - $6.50/1pc : uni, oyster, raw quail egg shooter - YUM!\n\nThe creamy roll - $7.95/6 pieces - huge and worth it! Came with a generous amount of spicy tuna and scallop with avocado and not too much rice at all. I'm typically a sushi purist as I like to taste and feel the fish on its own (without the distraction of sauce/rice), but in this case, since the portion of fish was huge, it was actually a good mix of everything in terms of flavor and mouth-feel.\n\nMoriawase sushi combo $13.95 - essentially, 6-pc nigiri with a small cucumber roll - HUGE pieces of fish for nigiri - again, wish they had slightly more vinegar in the rice but not bad at all. Good deal!\n\nSeems like a lot of locals come here on a regular basis as the waitstaff recognized quite a few people in the hour I was there and they were constantly working on takeout orders, which is always a good sign!\n\nI'd definitely return if I had a hankering for sushi!

I've delayed in writing this review as I held such a Long affinity for Tazaki, but unfortunately their treatment of me earlier this year was insulting.\n\nMy friend and I ordered 5 rolls of sushi, 4 of them coming on one plate. As we started sampling the rolls, I felt the dreaded sensation of a hair in my mouth. I alerted the busboy and showed him the hair, who apologized and altered the manager. I set the hair on the table, as I no longer wished to hold it. \n\nThe manager arrived, and we explained the situation to her, but she was quite skeptical and asked to see the hair. Despite the busboy saying he had seen it, the manager asked us if we were sure it wasn't ours. The hair was clearly an employee's (long and jet black) as opposed to our curly hair (and quite short). \n\nThe restaurant then took the entire plate of 4 sushi with only one piece missing per roll(we weren't sure which roll it was in) then brought out the bill, adding insult to injury by taking one roll off of the entire order. We were left hungry, had to pay for a meal we didn't even get to eat, and treated quite poorly by the staff.

Of course, their fish is not super good quality, but it's very much worth the price. Their salmon and yellowtail nigiris are only $3.50 for 2 pieces! I'm aware that most Japanese restaurants in SF these days price them at around $5 nowadays, so it's always good to have a cheaper alternative if you're not feeling like a baller. This is overall a place where I can see myself going to often if I'm craving sushi, but don't want to spend too much.\n\n::MUST GETS:: Pumpkin Sushi, Scallop Nigiri, Yellowtail Nigiri\n\n-Pink Lady Maki (~$14): Blue fin tuna and avocado on the inside with salmon on the outside, topped with a mayo based sauce and tobiko. A very decent roll if you enjoy creamy sauces (; Flavors blended very well together, but nothing really \"popped\" if that makes sense. I might go ahead and order some other roll instead during my next visit.\n\n-Pumpkin Sushi ($6.50): Salmon sushi topped with scallops with mayo. I actually enjoyed this a lot because I love mayo everything. A big pricey but I feel like it's worth trying.\n\n-Salmon Nigiri ($3.50): This surprisingly melted in my mouth! However, there wasn't a sweet salmon taste that you usually get with good quality fish. Oh god I feel like my descriptions are confusing lol. But because I am a salmon lover, this did the job just fine!\n\n-Scallop Nigiri ($4.95): This was bomb. MMMM! Very sweet and delicious scallops that made me incredibly happy. I would definitely recommend this!\n\n-Uni Nigiri (Seasonal): Nope. Just a big fat NO. This filled my mouth with bitterness ): Maybe it was just a bad day for uni, which I understand. \n\n-Hawaiian Butterfish ($3.50): This was pretty good. Melted in my mouth just fine, but no distinct strong flavors. But then again, this is a subtle fish to begin with. \n\n-Yellowtail Nigiri ($3.50): Strong flavors, melts in your mouth, GET IT! haha\n\n-Chicken Teriyaki: The flavors were good but my friend said it wasn't as moist as she would have liked.

The food deserves 3 stars, but after the horrible service Ive experienced 4 times, I dont believe the restaurant deserves 2 stars. \n\nThis may be a long review/rant, but if you experienced the quality of service I did, I doubt you'd want your disappointment to fall on deaf ears. The first three visits I made with my family, we had to wait at least 30 minutes to be seated. Understandable for a Japanese restaurant, but each time we watched as the waitresses seated parties that came in after us without even looking at us or the waiting list. The first two times it happened, we brushed it off because it seemed like they were friends and families of the owner and stuff like that happens. Same thing happened during my third visit, but in addition to waiting 45+ minutes to be seated, I had to wait another 45 minutes for a sizzling platter they said \"will be ready in 5 minutes\" over 3 times. I then waited another 10 minutes for the bowl of rice they twice forgot to bring out. \n\nTonight's visit however, is what led me to compose this review. Again, we show up expecting to wait a while because they are busy. After 40 minutes of waiting we are finally next on the waiting list for a table/tatami of 3. BUT THEN, a waitress comes over to the middle aged couple that came in 20 minutes after we did and whispers something to them (they didnt even write their names on the waiting list). We already knew what was happening, but we didnt realize how disrespectful it was going to be. \n-10 minutes pass and a table of 6 leaves, and im expecting a waitress to skip us and give it to the next party of 5 (actually a practical thing to do). Instead, she tells another waitress to not seat that table and hands it over to the couple she whispered to earlier. \n-They tell her it seems really awkward to cut so many people and be put at a larger table. So this waitress tells them to just sit at the table and she'll move them over to a smaller table thats getting ready to pay the bill. \n-The smaller table is cleaned and lo and behold she moves the nameless couple over. Only THEN does this party of 5 get seated at the table large enough for 6-7. \n\nOnce this happens, my family and I are FINALLY disgusted enough to decide to leave after patiently waiting for 40 minutes and then watching in angst for another 15-20 minutes as they \"sneak\" this couple in front of us. Before I left I went to the waitress who literally turned her back to us the entire time to avoid the shame of what she was doing, and I asked if her manager was around. She said yes. I asked if I could speak to them, so she said okay, she would go tell them.\n-She goes to the back, comes out ignoring me going about her business as the restaurant is still busy. After a few minutes of making me wait, she comes to me and suddenly says the manager is not at the restaurant. \n-I then ask her why she seated the party of 2 before us and she starts playing DUMB AF. \n-She says \"oh, let me check the waiting list.\" and we take a nice stroll to the front door. I told her they didnt write their name on the list, which is why Im questioning her actions. She then tries to play it off even more by saying \"Oh, the party of 5?..\" Before she can continue I said \"No. The party of 2. Do you want me to walk you over to them?\" As if im not making ANY sense to her, she then says \"Oh, the party of 7?\" (I kid you not, these questions are quoted word for word). I respond with the same answer and she allows me to walk her over to the table and point directly at the couple to avoid any further confusion.\n-Then she says they called and made a reservation. I tell her we tried doing the same thing 2 hours ago but they told us they dont take reservations for parties of 6 (also very common and nothing im complaining about). She then tells me those reservations for small parties arent taken by the staff, but by the owner because \"theres a list in the back\" of people who are close friends/family.\n-Still giving her the benefit of the doubt, I ask why did she not tell us anything and openly ignored all the other guests who waited well before that couple got there. She then has the nerve to say \"I understand your situation.\" Thats when I realized there was nowhere else this conversation could go and left. \n\nAfter 4 visits (4 waits, 3 meals), I have spent over 3 hours standing and observing their waitstaff. What I have gathered is they give decent service to half of their customers while the rest take a back seat to the owners friends, family, the takeout customers, and a few lucky patrons. The groups they seat faster also always gets their food faster, while everyone else is forced to wait /be ignored. I cant recommend Tazaki Sushi to anyone unless you like being served by people who visibly care for only SOME of their customers and simply dont care for the rest.", "author": "Andrew P."}

My best friend and I usually go to sakesan in Richmond for our sushi fix, but we decided we should try out a new place and that it might be better than sakesan. Oh man, we were so wrong...\nUpon walking in, I noticed right away that the interior of this place was quite old while I expected a lot more. We were seated right away, there was no wait on a Tuesday night. I was super happy because we were STARVINGG. Once we were seated we started to look at the menu. You order by checking a list. We got California roll, sake maki, philly, caterpillar, Alaska, two orders of sake nigiri, and a sizzling fish plate. I had no idea what that was but my boyfriend wanted that. \n\nThe food took quite a long time to come out especially since there weren't many tables and those tables had already gotten their food. Once the sizzling plate came out, I was so shocked to see how little of a portion we got for the price. The sizzling plate also said it comes with stir fried vegetables but all my boyfriend got was bean sprouts!!!! That's not mixed vegetables, what a lie. Honestly I didn't even know he had ordered ahi tuna  because what I saw and what I thought it looked like was chicken lol. I asked him why he got chicken and he told me it's tuna, and that it's super drying. For $3 more we got fried salmon along with that meal. Holy shit, the chef should feel ashamed of himself for even serving that salmon to us!! It was the saltiest piece of shit I've ever ate.. it was so salty.... it wasn't edible. The rest of the rolls came and to be quite honest, everything tasted very mediocre. I was so disappointed because it definitely didn't satisfy my sushi craving. The California roll was the worst, the crab meat was so dry, I couldn't eat another piece after trying one. \nHowever!! Their sake nigiri was pretty fresh and good. \n\nI'm just super disappointed with my experience here. Can't believe they had the audacity to serve us that salty ass salmon, and I love salmon!! \n\nTheir service is slow af too. At the end of the meal, my boyfriend was really upset with his meal he complained to one of the waitresses about the fish and salmon. She even said that it is dry.. then why do you guys keep serving this inedible dish?! Wtf. They still charged us for it. $60 for a pan of bean sprouts, salty ass salmon and mediocre sushi. \nDefinitely won't be returning.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

We are staying south of Golden Gate park, and had walked our feet off in the park, so we wanted a very close, local place. Yelpers give this place 5 stars, and it delivers on all levels. Full of locals, we were lucky to get a table on a Tuesday night, although there were a couple of seats available at the lovely sushi bar, and a low table in the window seat. All seats were full by the time we left with people waiting for our table.\nService was very friendly and conscientious about checking on us. Prices were amazingly low. We ordered a shrimp tempura platter which came with a good miso soup, salad, rice, 4 shrimp skewers and  6 veggies AS WELL as dessert for $11. The veggies were okay, but the shrimp was incredibly battered, and cooked to perfection. Mmm, still reliving their crunchy goodness. My husband and I split the order, but since we had ordered 3 different sushi rolls, we did not have room for dessert. All the sushi rolls were tasty and fresh. \nBeer and wine are available, with a glass of nice red wine for $5. They apologized profusely for not having a large bottle of Sapporo, only a regular size, which ended up being a good thing, since we did not have room for dessert, much less more beer.", "author": "Debra R."}

My best friend, however, loves this place. Me, not so much... The restaurant is fairly small so there's a wait for mediocre Japanese food. Let's get into further details.\n\nFood:\nMy meal was bland, tasteless, and overall lacking flavor. I ordered the Katsu Curry (~$13), expecting lots of flavor from the sauce. I found myself adding salt, soy sauce, and at some point even Sriracha to my katsu. The katsu should provide the flavor for the white rice, that's the whole point. I ate a quarter of my meal, not even half. I also tried some of my friends' California Roll. It tasted like straight up mayo (One of my major pet peeves! Don't drown the sushi with mayo, it defeats the purpose.)\n\nI did like that the meal came with Miso soup and Ice cream though!\n\nService: \nThe food took forever to get to our table, which I usually don't mind because it gives me time to catch up with friends. However, this place was extra slow. Not sure if they're understaffed in the kitchen, but man it took about half an hour for our food to arrive. Our food also arrived at different intervals, so my food was cold by the time my friends had gotten their Bento boxes. \n\nThe waiters though are very attentive and nice, which I appreciated. Good service on their behalf. The food preparation was definitely something out of their control, so can't blame them on that part. \n\nAtmosphere:\nLots of families and group of friends. We visited on a Saturday night and it took us about 10 minutes to get seated which is relatively fast considering their small venue. The interior is nothing fancy, pretty simple and straight to the point. It was clean, from what I could see. I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come back here again. There are better Japanese restaurants in the same area.", "author": "Stefany Z."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-18", "description": "My friend lives nearby, so we decided to give this place a try. This review is based on my takeout experience only. \n\nI came with the intention of simply ordering a specialty roll to go, as I wasn't too hungry - but the moment I walked in, my nostrils were engorged with the dazzling aroma of sweet and savory teriyaki sauce. I ended up ordering salmon teriyaki ($12.95) while my friend ordered ahi tuna teriyaki ($14.95) to go. \n\nWe waited about 15-20 minutes for our food. Each of our orders came with a side of miso soup, small side salad, white rice, and our entree - pretty standard. The miso soup was nice and hot, warming my palate at first sip. The salad was just some pieces of lettuce with thousand island drizzled over it - nothing special. \n\nNow, when I bit into the salmon teriyaki.... INSTANT DISAPPOINTMENT. When I took another bite, and another... TOTAL REGRET. The salmon was extremely bland; it didn't taste the least bit seasoned. The teriyaki sauce was light and watery, sweet and savory, but not at all powerful enough to combat the utter lack of flavor from the salmon. The salmon was also very dense and overcooked and chewy. There was nothing that could save this dish. My friend said her ahi tuna turned out similar...as in tasteless and overcooked. I am saddened to say that this was probably the worst salmon teriyaki I've ever had at a Japanese restaurant.\n\nAside from the total miss from my teriyaki takeout experience, I do remain hopeful and would give this place another shot. Everyone deserves a second chance, right? Although i can't comment too much on the service, every staff member I interacted with seemed pretty friendly. The restaurant itself is pretty cute and quaint inside as well. Next time I'll definitely skip the teriyaki and try the sashimi/sushi instead, which is what I intended to do in the first place... \n\nTl;dr - Never judge a restaurant by the way it smells...Lesson learned.", "author": "Cheryl N."}

I'm gonna kick his ASS!!!  \n\nI ordered the Butter Fish. When it came out the waitress covered the fish. When I uncovered the fish I was in a state of shock, disbelief, angry and mortified how tiny the 2 pieces of fish I got. It was like Nigiri Butter Fish!! If anyone ever had the feeling of being completely cheated, ripped off or scammed, that's how I felt. For $15.28 I got 2 tiny pieces of fish and the rest of the sizzling platter was full of Bean Sprouts! So actually they should rename the dish to Sizzling Bean Sprout with a Dab of fish. The owner, who was behind the sushi bar should be ashamed of himself for serving this. I told the waitress I do not want this if this is all I'm getting, it's not worth it. She took it back and showed the owner. He said it isn't like the picture we saw and that was the wrong picture. I said no matter what picture you should be ashamed serving so little food for that price. He told me he will take the fish back and said for me not to come back either!! Instead of saying \"let me add more fish\".  See what happens when a place gets too popular? The owner doesn't care cause he doesn't need your business. So that's why I'm giving the Cheap Son of a Bitch 1 star. Not only is he ripping people off, over charging for his food and he doeant give a shit about his customers! The ones he kisses ass to he knows he is cheating them thats why they keep going back. I can only hope people will see how he treats his customers and eventually he will go out of business! \n\nHere is the positive: the slices of fish for the Nigiri was very good sized, the fish was fresh and the service was good.

I love scallops and salmon so this was the perfect dish for me. Both ingredients were fresh and I liked the sauce. I would definitely recommend this.  \n\nSoft shell crab appetizer $7.95\nThe breading is different from other Japanese restaurants.  It's was more of a fried calamari breading..  I'm not sure how to describe it.  Although it was tasty and crunchy,  I prefer the regular breading.  It was also tiny for $8 so I wouldn't order it again.  \n\n3 item bento box with salmon teriyaki,  beef teriyaki and vegetable tempura. $13.95\nThe salmon teriyaki was small but it was good.  The skin was crunchy and it was cooked perfectly.  The beef teriyaki was hard and chewy. The vegetable tempera was nice and crunchy.", "author": "May S."}

We've been twice and surprisingly Tazaki Sushi is a good choice for the area - if you order the right things.  \n\nThis small restaurant seems to be a neighborhood favorite and some people even call ahead to make reservations.  Our first dinner there we ended up at the sushi bar and ordered a variety of rolls: spicy tuna roll, spider maki roll, creamy roll and shared a bento that came with chicken karaage, California roll and shrimp mixed tempura.  I wasn't expecting much with the rolls but was surprised on the flavor and the freshness of the seafood.  I think the rolls could have been a little bigger though.  Our favorite was probably the creamy roll which was scallop and tuna with a creamy slight carroty tasting sauce.  The crab was perfectly breaded/fried in the spider roll, but I'm used to having a big roll for it.  Spicy tuna was standard but pleasing.  The bento box was big and fairly priced for what we got - wings & drumsticks of chicken karaage, 4 pieces of California roll, two big tempura shrimps with a handful of tempura veggies.  Chicken was delicately fried and had a nice sweet salty sauce.  The tempura wasn't very greasy either.  California roll was standard.  I totally miss Joy Sushi in San Mateo when the sushi craving hits!\n\nThe second time we came we got two rolls and a katsu don.  While the seafood was fresh, the pork, not sure if it wasn't fresh, but it was just rubbery.  I definitely prefer katsu don at other places.  The thing that kind of kills the rating here too, is the service.  It's pretty slow and I feel like the girls here can get flustered at times.  The guys at the sushi bar are cool, but you still can get ignored by the waitresses if you sit there since they have to take you order, bring you your hot food and check.  And, with both the katsu don and bento boxes on those two seperate occasions, it's a meal and includes ice cream, the second time we went one of the waitresses just gave us the bill when we asked for it and didn't even ask us about which ice cream we would like, we had to follow up with her.  \n\nLots of people seem to get one of the sizzling plates they offer.  We may have to try that next time with a roll or two of course.  Generally, if you stick with the sushi or chicken karaage or tempura, you're golden.  3 stars for now.", "author": "Cat C."}

I have been here with someone like a grandmother to me, came here with a date before, enjoyed dinner while catching up with a friend, etc. In the past, I always seem to go when they aren't so busy. However, with the game going on and it being a Saturday night, I experienced the place being packed for once and I felt I was due to write a good review for this place. \n\nThat night they were packed, they were understaffed, so the service was a tad slower than usual, but that did not stop them from checking on me and my friend just enough times (how we were, and for more tea). Plus, despite the crazy busy night, flagging down a server wasn't impossibly difficult. \n\nI order things in the menu that have raw seafood - salmon sashimi, fatty tuna sashimi, and sunset roll (aka uni roll) and the spoon (a spoon with uni, oyster, quail egg, tobiko, and garnish). As always, I'm never disappointed and can taste how fresh the ingredients are (FYI, it was quite generous portions). Seriously (for uni lovers), the uni they used in the roll was soft because it's getting mushed to get rolled up, while the uni used in the spoon was a bit more solid - both had the same vivid orange color and were yummy. Oh, and the fatty tuna was fall apart and melt in your mouth good. \n\nAnyway, what really pushed me to write this review on this place is when we checked on the status of a bento box they were taking unusually long to make. They were VERY apologetic that they neglected that portion of our order because it was written on the back corner by our server. I know that we're all human and things happen, but it's the fact that they took responsibility for it and put that missing part of dinner as top priority after realizing their mistake is what I'm very please about. \n\nMy only memo to the business would be that their miso soup is rather salty, but that is an easy fix. \n\nExcellent food with courteous service!! This is definitely one of my top places for good Japanese food in the city - especially for raw seafood!!", "author": "Christina L."}

It's not a fancy place, and by that I mean this is not the place to bring your date unless you've gotten past that stage of needing to impress someone with looks.

That's pretty darn inexpensive for California. Finally, I appreciated the real shiso leaf instead of that fake plastic leaf that most cheap places will give you.

I am hesitant to rave about this spot too much, because it is my go to- but they deserve an awesome review. \nAppetizers I would recommend the Hamachi Collar, or the gyoza. Both delicious. \nAnd for the courses my boyfriend and I ALWAYS get sashimi hamachi and sake. both are fresh and they don't skimp on the sizes. For rolls the 49 roll is delicious ( i believe that is the first one on the menu with scallops and fresh lemon on top!) and there also the entre plates. I have had almost all of them and never been disappointed. \nThey have an average size sake collection, and they are always a fast spot. They only take reservations of a party of 4 or more, so get there during dinner rush a little early. They have great for small groups, the ambiance is pretty casual and it is never too loud. They have a larger room set aside for large parties, but you need to reserve it a little in advance, even if it is same day but just early in the day \nThey do have a few tvs and are wiling to change the channel- but mostly they have the games on which is cool. \nOne time, i got pretty drunk and left not one-but two designer sunglasses at my table. I called and they had them set aside. Life happens- and i didn't pick them up for over a week and they were right there waiting for me. I thought that was just a nice gesture because I couldn't have been mad if they didn't have them, or they could have lied, but the fact that they held on to them made me more grateful to have such a nice neighborhood spot, just a few blocks away.", "author": "Julie H."}

The sashimi is fresh, the rolls are flavorful, and the combinations from the bento boxes give a great variety. Takazi also offers sizzling fish plates, ramen bowls, and really yummy ice cream. \n\nBUT, the service is less than desirable. This is taken from a slow Wednesday and an extremely busy Friday. Both were lacking of attention. Although all the attendants were friendly, many basic things were forgotten. They totally disregarded my party's miso soup. It did not come out for 35 minutes. I watched a whole 2nd quarter and halftime show of a Warriors game. Nothing came to the table, not even tea. Instead of admitting that they forgot, they insisted it was because it was busy and that we ordered sushi rolls. That would be true except we also ordered kitchen food including appetizers. \n\nParties around us who sat AFTER us, with the same number of people, received everything including miso and entrees/rolls. After arguing, things started to slowly come out of the kitchen with large chunks of time in between orders. Just tell me you forgot, that's all. And worse, the waitress gives me the check without offering ice cream. When I bring it to her attention again, she brings us ice cream saying \"it's on the house\".   -__- It comes with the meal, lady. \n\nOn the slow day, our waitress brought out everything but it took 3-4 reminders. That was frustrating in itself. \n\nI really do like this spot. It's convenient on my commute. I like small restaurants, especially those supported by the surrounding neighborhood. And Tazaki is big on Bay Area sports. But man, don't make me upset before you bring out your delicious food. It really spoils the appetite.

How this makes any sense? I don't know. We finally placed our orders: 6 pieces of white tuna sashimi, 1 order oyako soba, and 1 bento with chicken, beef and yellowtail sashimi. The waitress was consistent with filling our cups with tea, but sadly that was the only thing they kept coming. It took 15 minutes for our seemingly thin and small 6 pieces of sashimi to come. Sashimi of that quantity should not take that long. As I sat at the bar, I was observing how they were preparing every order. They had already finished plating our sashimi and left it on the counter until the rest of other people's orders were prepared and served... After waiting for another 25 minutes, we began to wonder where our food was, only to find out that there's only one chef. We finally got our food, the food was mediocre, and portions were stingy. Overall, this whole experience was unpleasant and uncomfortable.", "author": "Kass L."}

But the name of the restaurant is a bit misleading - is it Judah Okazuya or Tazaki Sushi? \n\nAnyway, once entered the restaurant, on a Saturday night, the restaurant was quite full. Sat down, free edamame, and ordered the following things:\n\n1. Sashimi Combo - there were 20pcs and to my surprise it was so fresh! I wasn't expecting much actually just wanted to get some fish; but there was no taste of \"ice\" which a lot of sushi restaurants do. There were 5 kinds of fish and all of them were good and fresh.\n\n2. Soft shell crab combo - it was very well deep-fried and with the sauce, the whole thing was just very good\n\n3. Karaage - don't know how to judge this one because it came with 4 big pieces of fried chicken instead of usual small bites of fried chicken. But anyway it was juicy and it tasted very crispy outside and soft inside.\n\n4. Hamachi Kama - very surprised about this one because there were two pieces for one order! At the same time it was very well grilled; not overcook but still has that carbon taste which to me is quite essential for hamachi Kama\n\nSo after all, two people only less than $50 for all these!! If I were to get same quality and same quantity elsewhere in bay area, I guess at least $70. So good food good price. Five stars!\n\nOh and one more thing, I totally forgot my sunglasses in the restaurant and the waiter ran out, chased me for a block an gave it back to me. Very nice of him! All waiters and waitress service was super good and I felt like an important customer, one of these 5 stars must be given to the waiters and waitress!", "author": "Simon C."}

Against my better judgment, I kept eating it even as the fish seemed to be warm when sashimi should be somewhat cold even though it took me 20 or so minutes to get back home. Within half an hour of eating the sushi, I began to throw up along with bouts of sitting on the porcelain throne several times. I'm almost certain I have food poisoning.\n\nTo be fair, I've been to this place twice for takeout and this was the second time. The first time was absolutely fantastic whereas this time was the complete opposite.

I am amongst the other spoiled 40th & Judah residents that have Tazaki just around the corner from their apartment, and I really can't say enough good things about this spot. It's consistently humble, comforting, delicious and a real welcome landing spot after dismounting the N Judah. \n\nYou can always come here and receive excellently fresh ingredients. Try the sake sashimi, it's fantastic and always sliced generously. Their nigiris are also an act of generosity as they are cut to be big, satisfying bites. Their list of rolls is extensive, and it seems you can always find something you haven't had before. When it doubt, try these: Snake Roll, Swamp Roll, Dragon Roll, Summer Love Roll, and the Yakuza Roll. \n\nThe miso soup. Oh the miso. It's such a lovely bowl of comfort. Always piping hot, full of flavor, and it's often the thing I crave after a 10 hour day at the office. \n\nThe complementary edamame and attentively refilled green tea is very much appreciated, and it's a great touch that sets Tazaki apart. \n\nThe service is always friendly and accommodating. Unless you find yourself in the middle of a dinner rush, you're never ignored at the door. They make sure to ask if the bar, a table, or a tatami is okay for seating instead of just assuming one way or the other. The owners always seem to be around keeping tabs on things, so quality of service is never left unattended. \n\nUntil Tazaki, I never realized the necessity of having a homey sushi joint a measly 3 minute walk from my apartment. If I ever move, it'll be another requirement to add the the difficulty of finding a place to live in San Francisco. But in the meantime, I will happily continue to be a faithful Tazaki customer! \n\nSashimi vacuum for life out.", "author": "Chelsea B."}

If you're one of those people who love  the sauce drenched sushi, you should go elsewhere cuz this is the exact opposite.\n\nWe came a few minutes after they opened. Surprisingly, we weren't first. Admittedly this ambiance is kinda weird. Doesn't give an authentic Japanese restaurant feel outside the bar area. It's just like another chinese restaurant. I also thought it was weird that our waiter was our chef and then later on, another waiter had no uniform (uh did you just hired him?)\n\nTheir menu is strange, the rolls are on a paper checklist and you just add a number next to the specific rolls. We were hungry and I think I ordered more than I could've finished.\n\nOrdered 2 small 6 piece rolls (maki?). Shrimp tempura and spicy tuna I think? Very simple rolls. They don't even have fake crabs which I kinda wish we had. It will have just the fish u want inside. Definitely better than expected. Cheap, totally worth it. \n\nGot a holiday roll and some other salmon roll. Again, no sauce drenching here. Just fish as it is. The soy sauce brings out the flavors in the fish. Not exactly memorable tho.\n\nFinally we got 3 nigiris. A hamachi, salmon and this midnight something. That last one was supposed to have a quail egg, caviar, and tuna wrapped but they ran out of quail egg and gave us uni instead. They did this before asking us which I felt was kinda rude. What if I didn't like uni? It's def not my fav, and I felt like I didn't have a choice and we didn't even get a discount because they didn't have the egg that I originally wanted. Yea I'm picky, but this is sushi. Tried it anyway. Wasn't spectacular at all. Caviar didn't even taste salty. This was definitely a disappointment.\nThe hamachi was good but my bf got the vein-y piece that were a bit too chewy. The salmon made up for it tho. Huge cuts and was so melt in your mouth good!

They don't usually take reservations for less than 6, but if you call before you arrive, they were able to save a table for 5 for me for 20 minutes.\n\nTip 4: Ask what's fresh, but don't be too harsh--they were super honest with us about what was frozen (basically everything but the ahi steak), but I couldn't complain about the yellowtail or salmon we ordered anyway (if anything, I liked it a littl better than the overcooked ahi platter). \n\nOne note/complaint: They don't put the plastic spouts on their tea pots so it is very, very easy to spill, which sucks.", "author": "Cailin H."}

My Japanese friend lives walking distance from this place and we were craving decent sushi. His roommate suggested this place and after reviewing the menu we knew that it probably would be the same grade sushi as other typical cheap sushi restaurants.\n\nFor $40 the two of us shared a combination sushi plate that usually feeds 3-4 people. It included a total of 16 different nigiri and three specialty rolls. The nigiri were HUGE and the highlight of this experience! I loved the fact that they only used a small amount of rice so the fish was really the spotlight. I was also surprised that the fish was fresh and tasty for being so \"cheap\". The specialty rolls were not as good. They included a California, Spyder, and Caterpiller. We didn't think these were as good as the nigiri. The crab used in the California roll was really strange. We described it as having a furry texture, maybe because the crab was more on the dry side. Also the other two rolls had lettuce in it which was odd and probably just used as a filler (glad they didn't resort to the typical Americanized sushi with cream cheese).\n\nIt was overall satisfying and really filling! Although it's not one of my favorite sushi restaurants I think it is a bit better than other decently priced places. I will be back in the future to get my nigiri fix!

The sashimi quality was ok. I didn't really like the beef teriyaki. It is usually the thinner cut of the beef and not much fat, so it is more like teriyaki sirloin. \n\nOne thing I didn't really like was their service, there wasn't a wait for tables, but yet, they kept pushing the bill on us.

However, we had to wave down the waitress to take our order after 15 minutes of waiting. Then, our friend got her bento box 15 minutes after we ordered. She decided to wait for us to start since we ordered chirashi bowls, which didn't need to be cooked (other than the rice). We waited another 20 minutes, we asked the waitress and she said 10 more minutes. 10 minutes later, we asked another waitress which then said it was going to take a little bit longer because the fish was difficult to cut for the chirashi bowl (?) Then we waited another 10 minutes and finally got our food. During this time we were waiting for our food, I was glancing at the sushi chef here and there to make sure it was coming when they said it would. However, the entire time he was making to-go orders until 15 minutes before our food finally arrived. I really don't think that \"the fish was difficult to cut\" if he didn't even start on it yet. I wish they would've been more honest with an apology. I wouldn't be so irritated. They also forgot our salads that came with the meal until the end of our meal. \n\nOur entire dinner from the time we sat down took 2 hours. On top of that, they split the bill incorrectly. \n\nThe food was good! The chirashi bowl was definitely a bang for your buck, but, with the unpleasant dining experience, I'd rather pay the extra $5 and enjoy my meal.", "author": "Thatcher H."}

My mom was taking a walk and she said it smelled nice, so we walked in. \n\nSitting down, the ambiance was sort of nice - no pop music or even the stereotypical Asian music playing. The door was open and you could feel some of the sea breeze blowing through the restaurant. Very relaxing. Other than us, there was no one else in the restaurant. (besides a couple sitting on the tatami mats in the corner)\n\nThe waiter who served us was most likely the owner. My dad asked how long the restaurant has been on business, and he said about 15-17 years. My expectations for Asian restaurants are never very high (as all TRUE down to earth Asian restaurants have pretty bad service) and this man proved that somewhat to be true. He was wearing a white apron, and put our food down a bit brash. He was older in age, so I think his tendency to spill was a little higher. (Watch our for the tea -it's good tea - but it spills EVERYWHERE. Literally) but otherwise the food was amazing!\n\nHamachi Sashimi - One Word: FRESH. The hamachi was cut perfectly and was very cold, as if it was cut and served immediately. It was extremely tender and left me wanting more.\n\nCalifornia Rolls - Although these were good, they left a bit more to be desired. The crab meat was a little dry, but the avocado helped balance it out, along with the soy sauce. \n\nTonkatsu - One thing I particularly enjoyed about the Tonkatsu is that he gave us an entire bottle of the Tonkatsu sauce. Many restaurants drizzle the sauce over the meat for you, but usually by the time the meat gets in your mouth, the taste evaporates. Having a bottle, I was able to use it to my hearts content.\n\nTeriyaki (Beef and Salmon) - [heads up: the teriyaki sauce is more salty than sweet] the salmon just melted in my mouth. No need to keep ranting how good it was. The beef was extremely thin cut so it was easy to chew, unlike the restaurants which give you the fat along with the beef.\n\nTempura - the tempura was the perfect balance of crunchy. While some restaurants don't add enough \"panko\" AKA breadcrumbs, others overfry it so the covering is too hard. This place had the perfect crunch to their tempura! Yum!\n\nOn the house ice cream! Yay!\n\nOverall: amazing food, quiet mood, mediocre service.", "author": "Calvin H."}

Many times we just walk down from our house as parking around the area is poor.  For unknown reasons, we stopped going there and our Japanese food of choice is Spiral located in Westlake area in Daly City.\n\nA couple of days ago, we had guests and decided to return here for a quick bite at about 2PM on a Tuesday.  It was pretty quiet, since it was after the lunch hour, but the service was very slow and the people did not appear very welcoming.  \n\nThere were four in our party and we had cooked sushi, another sushi dish (can't remember what they ordered), chicken teriyaki entree, and beef teriyaki entree ($12.95).  I can't remember the prices of the other items except for mine as someone else picked up the tab. I did noticed that the prices are higher than what they advertise on their web site.\n\nOur teriyaki dishes were bland and the meat was rather tough.  Also it didn't look that appetizing.  The dessert of green tea ice cream was good (what could go wrong with ice cream?)\n\nOverall, it is a much better value at Spirals, as Judah Okazuya has sat on its laurels for way too long and thus the food quality and service has deteriorated.

We came in around 7:45pm and left around 9:20pm...for a table of two...after having ordered three sushi rolls and a \"salad.\" Service is just that inattentive when they get busy and I don't blame the servers because from what I observed, there is a lack of a division of labor at this place and it's a hindrance. This place is pretty small, so having multidisciplinary servers ain't a bad thing, but they just don't have their stuff together. I witnessed a party come in and get asked within minutes of each other how big of a party they were by three different servers (who also host, run and bus). Communication is key - just not at this establishment. Many other tables seated around us were also impatient because the turnover time for food was just too slow and nothing was done about it. The servers are super nice, and had checked up on us/refilled drinks for the first ~30 minutes of the meal, but after that, we were forgotten about.  \n\nThe $9 cucumber shrimp \"salad\" we ordered was really just thinly sliced cucumber and four shrimp in a small ramekin soaked in some sort of soy/mirin mix and topped with sesame seeds... I can't even imagine how much they're profiting off of this dish alone because the portion was so small. \n\nReal crab is used at this establishment, which I appreciate because imitation crab meat is actually just mystery meat, but I found it a bit too fishy for my taste.

I had an udon from here and it had so many onions in it. It made me feel like I was having onion udon instead of the chicken and egg udon I ordered. Unless it's supposed to have so many onions? I've also had their beef teriyaki, but that was a miss since it was a little burnt. It's a little hard to flag down the servers.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we've always been given green tea ice cream, which is nice.", "author": "Jay L."}

The kind of place where you always go because you just know it will be good, and it feels relaxed and comfortable. The sushi is delicious, and they have an array of other Japanese dishes. It is casual and no fuss, which is the type of place I like to go after a busy day at work! Another great thing about Tazaki is the prices: they are very reasonable! I always leave there happy. The service is really good too, they are quick to get your food to you.\nMy only reason for not giving them 5 stars is that some of the dishes on the menu (sizzling plate, noodles) were good, but not amazing. Now I consistently order sushi or one of their combos. If you are in the Sunset I highly recommend Tazaki!", "author": "J K."}

I've been here a few times already and was here again today because I wanted my mom and brother to try this place also! Parking was easy to find and we got seated instantly. We ordered 4 sushi rolls (6 pieces each), 2 orders of The Spoons, an order of the Midnight Express, 2 orders of the pumpkin salmon, and the Hawaiian fish steak special which includes a toro roll! Even though there was only 1 server working today, she was really great and attentive. Everything tasted really deliscious and fresh! I think everyone's favorite dish was the fish steak. It was really flavorful and tender! We should have ordered 2 of those! I also really enjoyed the pumpkin salmon. We were all really full by the end of our meal but since the our fish steak included ice-cream, we shared a green tea ice-cream, which was rich and creamy. Yum!

The food is good, the prices are good, and there's plenty of parking. \n\nI love those little green salads with iceberg lettuce and house dressing that you get at cheap Japanese restaurants. I'm always disappointed at the upscale joints which only offer more authentic seaweed salads or green salads with only gourmet lettuce. Tazaki doesn't disappoint--and the salad is only like $1.50. The creamy sushi is as good as the other yelp reviews claimed. I've been craving it since. The little bowl of edamame that we were served on arrival was also a nice touch. \n\nTazaki looks like a typical cheap sushi joint--it's pretty bare bones inside.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-11-14", "description": "After living less than 1 mile away from this place for the last 17 years, I've finally decided to come pay it a visit. Walked in, service was nice. I was acknowledged immediately and was shown the table. There were 3 families also eating.  \n\nThe table that I was shown to was not exactly stable. It's one of those table that tilts whenever you put your arms on it. It's ok I guess, but then it's sticky, so whenever it tilts, it makes those stickyass sounds. Not so bad, but a bit irritating after awhile. But it's ok, as long as the food is good right? Wrong. I couldn't be more wrong with this place. I came here with humble expectations. Ordered three dishes that I'm fond of - Cold Soba and two rolls (one is an Uni roll while the other is albacore with white bass. \n\nFirst of all, the portions were decent. They're pretty big, and you will get full off it, unlike the pussyass portions from Ebisu. But besides good portions and decent service, everything else goes into the shithole. So where do I begin? Well let's see....\n\nThe cold soba was soaked. At first I thought it was from me dipping it into the sauce, but after looking at a growing puddle underneath the noodle box, I noticed that the liquid was clear, and not black. My noodles literally took a piss while I was eating it. Can it get anymore disgusting? Not only did it felt weird to chew on soggy noodles dipped in the sauce, it also tasted weird. How did they manage to fuck up something as simple as cold noodles with a cup of sauce for dipping? It's like eating out a girl while shes taking a piss at the same time. Now that's just sick.\n\nThe albacore / white bass sushi roll was cut unevenly. One piece would be really big, and the other would be small. The fish was not even cold! It was room temperature, which made me to start imagining how it's the optimum temperature for bacteria to grow on dead flesh. I'm sorry, but after taking biology class where you learn about incubation, you start to think about this shit when eating something that's in the wrong temperature. Knowledge is power right? Yes it is.... Did I mention that it had no flavor, but somehow has a weird after taste. How weird is that? \n\nFinally let's get to the uni roll. Uni is one of my favorite dish. I've tried a few varieties of Uni, whether it's live, nigiri, boiled with soup, by itself 'sashimi,' etc. But I must say this is the first time where I've had 'shit uni.' I'm not joking. The uni was so pressed against the rice that it literally looked like diarrhea. Surprise! The uni was also warm! You can probably guess that it was also not firm; it was liquidy. So can you imagine what this soft uni looked like mixed with rice? Yeah, like literally a pile of soft yellow feces being mixed with white maggots. This is just sick, I had two pieces (one with soy sauce, one by itself.... they both tasted like shit) and couldn't take it anymore. Even Lacy rejected this pile of vomit after I brought home the other 4 pieces, and it's fucking Lacy for god's sake. Oh, Lacy's my dog by the way, and she's willing to eat anything that's not shit. This, obviously, is shit. I ended up having to throw it all away. How did they fuck up so much with this? I love uni, but this was just a miserable shitload of fuck.", "author": "Calvin D."}

It's sushi and they don't go wrong with it, it's just nothing crazy or exciting. I get my typical rolls, which consist of a rainbow roll, philadelphia roll, and one roll at random. I usually add in 2 salmon nigiri because it's my favorite. Those taste the freshest. I really like that it's not cut too thick and it's the perfect portion.\n\nThe only big thing that I'm a fan of is their tempura. It's delicious and I absolutely love it. It's a huge portion, especially when I get it for myself. There's always enough of everything and typically, I end up leaving a few onions on the plate. Still overall, delicious.\n\nI really enjoy that they give you edamame and green tee as soon as you get there. It's a nice appetizer that's free.

I don't know if they were ever that good as the pictures form 2012 but the Sake sashimi I got tonight was about 3/8 inch thick, not the best quality cuts, and oddly shaped (some were rectangular and the size of a thick pen, while other were thin and flat). My date had the pork ramen, which had a soup that was as bland as water. We poured pepper flakes and soy sauce into the soup to no avail as there was little to be done to resuscitate the lost cause. The noodles were very thin, similar to some Chinese dishes I've seen and were not really ramen noodles, unless it was supposed to be some sort of spin on the traditional ramen that I'm not aware. The green tea dessert, on the other hand, was delicious. I'm not sure if the contrast between the flavors at dinner had anything to do with my experience during dessert because green tea ice cream is pretty safe dessert where ever you go. In all, dinner ran a little under $30, which is cheap for Japanese and for SF but neither person leaving satisfied, I would rather spend the couple extra bucks at a better place.

The service was excruciatingly slow (especially considering how empty is was), the waitress barely spoke English, and she never offered to refill our water or tea.  She got one of our order's wrong, and the entrees came out at varying times, up to 10 minutes apart.\n\nThe food itself was mediocre at best.  The sushi was just OK, and the udon broth lacked an authentic flavor (it simply tasted much too salty). \n\nThere are much better options in the Sunset district for Japanese food at or slightly above the prices here.  I recommend you consider your other options first before going here.", "author": "Jeff H."}

After reading some bad reviews of this place, I was scared that we might not get fresh fish.  Howver, when you look at their menu and photos on their website...you're taken aback with the look of freshness and deliciousness!\n\nSo we ordered with caution because advertisements and photos can be deceiving.\n\nFirst of all, walking in, we were seated immediately as the first customers for the lunch hour.  I was a bit hesitant - as always - when the staff are speaking Chinese in a Japanese restaurant (or any other language).\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nNama Kaki Viagra:  6 raw oysters served with heaping portions of uni on top with ponzu sauce on the side.  It was okay.  I read other reviews saying their uni tasted bad, but it was okay today.  I've had bad uni at the best of places, so it's really a hit or miss when taking your chances....in fact, the nama kaki viagra was the best thing we had at the restaurant.\n\nNabeyaki Udon:  tender noodles served piping hot in an clay pot.  Poached egg on top with just the right amount of onions and napa cabbage, chicken, shitake mushrooms, fish cake, and 1 shrimp tempura.  This was okay as well...better than some other places.  The broth was flavorful - not bland at all.\n\nRolls:\nCreamy Roll - which they seemed to be famous for.  It was made with scallop and spicy tuna - not to spicy, and it had an abundant amount of spicy mayo sauce that drowned it.  I like to taste the fish - not mask it.\n\nSpider Rainbow roll - deep fried soft shell crab topped with a variety of fish - this was okay, but our fried soft shell crab was burnt\n\nSunset Maki - sea urchin roll with tobiko - this was good....I could have done with an order of this and 3 orders more of the oysters and be set.\n\nI don't know if i'd venture to try this place for other stuff.  The rice for the sushi was not so sticky that the rolls fell apart..  Fish was fresh - but I've had fresher fish (at least it didn't taste like it sat in the fridge for a few days)\n\nOverall - okay.", "author": "JJAMZ C."}

Seeing as how there are plenty of Japanese restaurants to compare with, I will lean more with 3.5 STARS.\n\nThis restaurant offers some KILLER Chicken Katsu Curry! Compared with other restaurants this is a solid 4 STARS. Flavor was on point with Japanese Curry. It had a good portion of carrots, onions, and crispy delicious chicken katsu. I was surprised at the quality of their Chicken Katsu mainly because when you have a Chinese Owned Japanese Restaurant (majority of Japanese restaurants in SF) quality and authenticity comes into play. But their Chicken Katsu was by far some of the best I had in the city. You can expect to have large pieces that are crispy, full of flavor, and not overly breaded. \n\nTheir sushi on the other had is more on the 3 STAR side...but when you take into account the price, portion, and size of rolls I will give it 3.5 STARS. They have a great selection of sushi to choose from, which is great if you are a picky sushi eater. If you live in the sunset district or are in the neighborhood and have a late night craving for sushi, it will suffice. \n\nOverall, this is the kind of place where it's late, all the really good Japanese restaurants are closed, you are on a budget, and need some JAPANESE FOOD!!! Great neighborhood place to get decent to good Japanese food, but nothing to travel for or take a date. If you live around here and are craving Japanese food, give it a shot, you won't be disappointed. But don't expect to be blown away...unless you order that KILLER Chicken Katsu Curry...=]", "author": "Nick C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-21", "description": "I came here on a Thurs night with 2 friends. The wait wasn't too bad for peak dinner time. The food was actually very good. They start you off with free edamame. We ordered entrees of chicken katsu, deep fried scallops and beef sukiyaki, each was ~$10 (a pretty good deal as far as Japanese places go). The sukiyaki was a pretty large portion and the other ones were standard size/as expected. We also ordered a 49er roll to share (scallop, lemon, salmon) and they were generous with the salmon and scallop, very little filler stuff. The entrees come with miso soup, rice, salad and ice cream! Most places charge extra for ice cream so we were very excited about this. I wasn't a huge fan of the salad dressing (I don't really like ginger flavor), but that's just me. The rest of the food was great!\n\nThe reason for the low rating is the terrible service, probably one of the worst experiences I've had! \n1. The food did not come out around the same time. My friend got her chicken katsu at least 15-20 minutes before the rest of the food arrived. I understand that sukiyaki takes a bit longer to cook, but it should be timed better so everyone at a table is served within a reasonable time frame. Service in general was SO SLOW. Our meal from start to finish took well over 2 hours with the majority of it waiting around!\n2. They messed up our order multiple times. My friend ordered the deep fried scallops, but the waitress apparently heard \"fried soft shell crab\" (which sounds very different to me). There was also a separate order form for sushi and we marked off 49er roll, but instead she input California roll (what the hell??). The waitress didn't seem to understand English that well so I can somewhat understand the scallop/soft shell crab mixup, but I don't understand how she could've messed up the sushi order when we wrote it ourselves! My advice to her would be to repeat back orders to customers to double check.\n3. They flat out forgot to give us our ice cream at the end and we had to ask for it. Not only that, when they told us our choices were green tea or cookies and cream, my friend ended up with coconut (or maybe it was coconut cream??). Either we didn't hear right or she doesn't really know what the restaurant even serves. We were so fed up with the service by that time that we didn't bother to ask about it. Sigh.\n4. Some of the waiters seemed more preoccupied with the TV than actually serving customers. One of the waiters just sat there drinking beer and watching the game (I'll cut him some slack because it was the NBA finals, but still...). We had to ask for the bill twice. However, they were quick to take our money afterwards!\n\n3 stars may be a bit generous. Based on this experience, I probably won't be back.", "author": "Janet N."}

I wanted to try something new. I find Tazaki Sushi, formerly called Judah Okazu ya. It's got some great reviews, I check out the menu and fell i love with the half dozon raw oysters w/ uni and decided to come.\n\nWe walk in around 2:45 - 3 ish, completely empty. The server, sushi chef, everybody was eating lunch at a table watching TV. Which is fine, they're people too, they get hungry. The table we sit at is sticky. Ew. I ignore it and decide to order my appetizer, uni maki, philidelphia roll, and a couple others that we found appealing on the menu. The food overall wasn't BAD. But for the price I paid, I felt like it could have been better.\n\nAnd OMG the presentation. It was so sloppy, I should have taken a picture and posted it. The Philidelphia Roll (Cream Cheese & Salmon Maki) was literally a piece of frozen cream cheese  with a small block of salmon barely the size of my pinky nail. The sushi was hastily made and the rice was falling off the seaweed and the cheese & salmon was falling out as well. The uni Maki looked just as sloppy, it looked scooped out of the tray and placed into the roll. Not even pieces of uni, scoops. You could see the spoon mark where it cut into the uni. Now, that wouldn't have been bad if I could pick it up without the uni squirting out. AND THE UNI WAS WARM. WTF?! WARM UNI IS DISGUSTING. \n\nThe appetizer that I came for was good though, So I have to give an extra star for that, bumping it up to a two star review. The oysters were a little small, but the amount of uni given was generous, and the ponzu sauce was pretty good. Even though I could see the sugar they threw in quickly to make the sauce sweeter. Ack.\n\nOverall, I didn't really enjoy my experience here. They dumped the food on our table and made it quickly to get back to their lunch and whatever TV channel they were all fixated on.

I looked over the menu before I came and just seeing all of the options under the entree list and even the sizzling fish options, everything sounded very enticing. \n\nI stopped by for dinner and I settled for a Tazaki combo with beef teriyaki, shrimp tempura and tuna sashimi. Our waitress was a bit soft spoken so I couldn't really hear what she was saying half of the time. She brought out edamame, tea, followed by miso soup. She dropped off bowls of rice before our bento boxes came out. The bento boxes looked super good and it even came with a bit of seaweed salad. Unfortunately, I wasn't impressed with my bento. The beef teriyaki was sliced too thinly for my liking and was in a sauce that tasted bottled. The salad was not drained properly and was sitting in water. The sashimi was nice and thick but wasn't very fresh. My favorite part of the bento were the tempura veggies which came with the shrimp tempura. The veggies were sliced thinly, enough to hold that good crunch with the batter. However, the shrimp looked a bit gray in color. I also tried my bf's ca roll which just had no flavor at all. \n\nAs for the scoop of ice cream that came with our meals, green tea, mango and butter pecan were available.  I ordered the mango which was nothing special but I was just happy to get something sweet at the end of the meal. \n\nWhom I think may be the owner seemed really nice.

The staff is quite friendly and accommodating.  We started with free edamame and tea.  We ordered the combo plate of sushi/rolls for 5-6 ppl ($76) and the sashimi combo with 60 pcs ($70).  I ordered a chicken teriyaki bento box for the kids to share $12.95, which included miso soup, salad, and ice cream.

Plenty of food for 2 kids and a mom that eats leftovers:)  In addition to the above, we ordered a few more sushi items.  But we were pretty well-fed with the 2 combo platters ordered.  \n\nThe owner or manager was kind enough to give us all ice cream when it came time for the kids to have theirs, which came with the bento box.  That was a very kind gesture of this man.  I wish I asked his name and if he was the owner.  He's caucasian and was sitting with someone who must've been a regular, because the patron shared his beer with him and they toasted glasses.  We chose the green tea ice cream, which was delicious, by the way.  And one of our guests brought some cookies from Anthony's, which made the dessert even more decadent!

The food there is pretty good, and it reminds me of Taraval Okazu Ya (T.O.Y).  The menu even looks similar.  There are a few differences though.  For one thing, they gave us a free edamame appetizer when we sat down, which is nice.  Also, the dinner combos are only $9.95 rather than $11.95, so it's a bit cheaper than Taraval Okazu Ya too.  I got the Tempura/Sashimi/Chicken Teriyaki combo, and it was pretty good, comparable to T.O.Y.  The sashimi was tuna and it tasted very fresh, I'd say that it's better than the tuna at T.O.Y.  The tempura was alright, comparable to T.O.Y.  The chicken teriyaki was very flavorable, although it was a bit dry.  I'd say that T.O.Y's chicken was better because it was more moist, but all in all, the flavor of the chicken here made up for that.\n\nI would come here a lot more often if I lived closer to it, but because the food is so similar to T.O.Y's, I have a feeling that I'm gonna end up going to T.O.Y. (because it's 2 blocks from my apt).  But this place is definitely cheaper, so I think it's a great value for Japanese food if you live in the area.", "author": "Tyler C."}

NASTY. that was a waste. And they were SOOO stingy on the rice.  they BARELY gave me a whole bowl of rice. stinge-binges. However, my friend said they were pretty giving and not greedy on the sashimi, which i guess adds +1 star.  other than that, this place is probably def not worth a go to spot again.  \noh, and how could i forget, they tried to gyp me of my ice cream that was part of my \"bento\" box.. and then tried to play it off. shame. -1 star. \n\nAfter our meal, they had to have seen us completely finished with our meal sitting right in front of them with nothin left on our table but our dirty napkins,.. its a hint to give us our bill...ugh must we flag you down every 10 seconds when things are obvious. another por ejemplo: to refill or fill (like water) \n\noverall this place was a Meh. i've experienced WAY better.", "author": "Em C."}

We stumbled on this restaurant because it was the only place open that we knew how to get to.  (We were in San Fran. on vacation and our friends live in Mountain View)  Happily the food was fantastic, and the service was great, especially since we rolled in about 5 minutes before they closed after lunch service and I would not have been surprised if they told us they were no longer serving.  The place looks like a hole in the wall, but it was really a nice way to finish an afternoon. \n\nAs a strict vegetarian, eating out can be hard for me, and sushi is often a good compromise.   I had the miso soup, inari (sweet fried tofu), and a cucumber roll.  Even after a full day of hiking, I left full and totally satisfied.  They also brought out cold edamame and green tea right when we sat down.\n\nWhile I cannot fully speak to the quality of the fish, as I did not eat it, everyone in my group seemed really happy, and nothing was left on the plate.  My husband who is still new to sushi and a bit timid had the Volcano Roll (salmon and crab) and really enjoyed it.  My friends got the Rock 'n Roll with eel and avocado.  Husband didn't like that too much, but neither of us are huge fans of avocado in general.

on another occasion, me and the bf brought two other people here, and we got a bunch of things including two sizzling fish sets (thus two ice-creams), and we were served with four bowls at the end of our meal. much appreciated!\n\nrolls and nigiri: i've tried most of them, and have not been disappointed thus far. fresh ingredients, wonderful flavors. most delish. just pick out whatever mix of ingredients appeal best to you, and most likely you will not be disappointed. nom on, everyone. explore the list and nom on.\n\nsashimi: so thickly cut. juicy and fresh deliciousness. ordered the mixed sashimi once, 4 slices each of 4 types of fish. each individual fish's flavor shone through very well. i still remember how the salmon pieces melted in my mouth in a superb way even though they were not at all thinly cut. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.\n\ntempura: consistently good, except for one time when i got a piece of broccoli with soggy batter. the rest of the plate was piping hot and crunchy, though. i can cheerfully overlook the isolated incident.\n\nbento boxes: 3 choices from the list, and tummy filling indeed. i always find more than the stated 5 pieces of vegetable tempura in my bento, especially when the veggie slices are on the smaller side. the bf and i always order one bento with the cooked items - usually vegetable tempura and chicken karaage (hot and juicy, always)  - and sashimi (4 thick slices) along with various rolls, instead of getting the cooked items a la carte, as the portions are great for sharing. i personally gotta have tempura and either karaage/teriyaki items along with fresh fish and rolls when i eat japanese food, so this is a great way to taste various items instead of having too much in quantity.\n\nsizzling fish entrees: i've had varying portions of fish; once when i had a couple of dinner guests with me, the fish pieces were smallish, which let us down a little. i've had some hearty slabs of sizzling fish too, which were fantastic. it would be best if tazaki could be more consistent here. if the fish pieces are on the smaller side, it would be great if 2-3 pieces were served o make for a fair portion. apart from that, always fresh and delicious. they have a special on 'hawaiian' fish currently, order one at full price and have the second order at half price. choose between three fish; ahi, ono, and mahi-mahi. order the ono and mahi-mahi for a great contrast in flavor and texture; one is meatier and bolder, and the other is flakier and more delicate. love taking alternating bites between the two!\n\nappetizers: since the mains come out in good time and patrons are given soup and edamame already, i've only tried out the fried oysters and scallops a couple of times when the bf and i were super hungry. they were fried well, crunchy on the outside and beautifully hot and seafoodily fresh on the inside.\n\nhave not tried the udon, soba, or donburi though, but they look and smell good, from what i've seen on other tables!\n\nfree dinner delivery within the sunset district with a minimum cash order of $25, Tuesday to Sunday from 5pm to 10pm. i live right across the beach a couple of blocks away from Judah, and decided to call for delivery a couple of nights ago at around 9.30pm. the older lady at tazaki picked up and took my order, and was super friendly and patient with me even when i told her i'd call back in a few minutes with a trimmed down list of items as i was just rattling on a bunch of delicious things and she told me the bill was over $50. not feeling too famished, i called again with lesser items, and she was still super cheerful and told me it would take only about 25 minutes for me to get my food as they weren't busy. i called sheepishly a third time to ask for extra wasabi and pickled ginger, and the guy behind the counter who makes the sushi picks up the phone and enthusiastically said 'no problem!'. \n\nBAM, food arrived (delivered by nice owner guy in giants hat) in less than 25 minutes. no miso soup, but a chinese takeaway box STUFFED to the brim with complimentary edamame!!

We sat down, filled out our order sheet, they brought out a sushi roll for my brother and set one in front of my friend. When they did that, my friend asked, \"so, this is the calbear roll, right?\" The employee seemed to say in reply, \"Yes, this is the calbear roll\". The minutes passed by and after 20-30 minutes, I asked them if they had forgotten my catipillar roll because I was still waiting for it (this waiter spoke English perfectly and so do I, so they understood me perfectly). They left to go talk to the gentleman making the sushi, then, came back with a calbear roll and set it down in front of my friend. I was like, \"No, I am waiting for my catipillar roll.\" Then, who I am guessing is the manager comes over and argues with us about it. After another 10-15 minutes, I finally got my roll and it wasn't good. Besides the fact it was a mediocre roll, by the time I got it, I just wanted to scarf it down and get out of there. I normally prefer to sit down and relax and enjoy my meal whilst being treated with respect and kindness by the people who work at a dine-in. When we went up to pay, the managers way of \"making it up to us\" was by not forcing us to pay a tip like he normally does. He didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. No, sir. That did not make up for anything. I am incredibly disappointed with the service there and received attitude from not one, but two employees. Also, as a side not, the atmosphere was unremarkable.

After finishing the oysters and sushi, we waited a long time for our bento box.  It was really busy because there was a large table right next to us, so we could understand why it took so long.  They even gave us some seaweed salad for free because our order was taking so long.\n\nThe bento box was not good.  It all just seemed very limp and unflavorful.

Just good sushi, HUGE portions (even their nigiri slices are large!) and nice people.  Oh, and did I mention the prices? It's totally the best deal in town. 2 people can get STUFFED here for around $30, $40 if you want to drink some sake and beers. Trust me, if you come here, you will be glad. And I don't know why it is, but they have the best, most meaty soft-shell crab I've ever tasted, and I've tasted a lot. Closed on Mondays though :(", "author": "Eryn S."}

My favorite is the dinner sashimi or I would just order nigiri and rolls.  Dinner combo C (the one with soft shell crab) is also a good deal.  I like this place over Taraval Okazuya because it's cleaner, less crowded, has better service, and better fish.  This is another reason wny I missed not living in SF!", "author": "jenny t."}

That's all I can say...I have, up to now, been very dedicated to Shimo #1 on Clement, with Shimo #2 on Taraval as a standby for convenience. However, I just moved WAY out in the Sunset, and last Friday evening, after shlepping the last of our things to the new place, my boyfriend, David, our dear friend, Symon, and I decided to try the nearby Sushi spot. I was SO impressed! Granted, I prefer ordering directly from the sushi chef rather than filling out the little form, but, aside from that detail, I was thrilled with our meal. I love white tuna and hamachi sashimi, and I have rarely found it so pristinely, mouth-wateringly fresh as ours was. The nigiri sushi was equally fresh and generously proportioned. Another great favorite of mine is tobiko with quail egg. Normally, this is created with a seaweed wrap, but at Tazaki, it came with a combination of tobiko and black caviar, wrapped in a thin piece of tuna. Exquisite! There is a generous and varied selection of rolls, and many varieties of sake. The service was cheerful and efficient. I feel so fortunate to have discovered this gem, and to have it so near - within walking distance. Parking would not be too bad, but might take a couple of turns around the block...WAY worth it, though. I'll be back again and again", "author": "Angela M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2006-11-10", "description": "I had to go to this place twice before reviewing it because there were so many 5 starers and great things said.  I'm sorry, but I have to say that I'm quite convinced that this place is not worth my going and I would not recommend it.  The family atmosphere someone mentioned is indeed true however.  But that's about as far as this place impressed me.  The soybeans (only served at dinner) were too salty, and my udon was not even made of real Japanese noodles.  My egg in the udon was also half raw and the soup was not hot enough to make it done.  I've had the sashimi and a roll as well and I can say that both times the fish was not fresh.  If you do not have a real mouth for sushi (which can be a very finicky thing) and are on a tight budget, this may be a place where you can chow down.  For someone like me who craves really good and fresh sushi along with other crisp japanese dishes, I cannot say I would lead you to here.", "author": "Sokokyu K."}

They don't have anything out of the ordinary and their food doesn't taste out of the ordinary.  But it is close to my house, they make their food pretty quick, and they like me because I tip well.  I will continue to go here for cheap convenient sushi everytime I don't feel like driving to a better place.  By the way, is it Okazu Ya or Tazaki or both???", "author": "Chris H."}

We went here and were ignored by the wait staff. when we wanted to pay it took over 30 minutes and my wife had to leave it took so long. The fish is good, not great, but good. The first time we went we were given the back room and the owners came by and were really nice. Service was slow, but it was fine, the next time, and final, we spent over 1 1/2 hours waiting around for a small order of food, that was not that spectacular.

Tazaki takes his sushi, oysters seriously and the quality shows. Also a great selection of cold saki's. A very family place with not much atmosphere (but your here to eat, right?!) but the staff makes up for that in spades. Very reasonable in terms of other foods (cooked Japanese). Where else do you get a free bowl edamane when sitting down? They don't even have it on the menu so more is on the house too. I have eaten at Sushi Ran and other 'quality' places of 2-3x the price range and Tazaki rates higher in terms of fish and food; you just are not paying for the decor at Tazaki.
