Of all the food places on Irving, Loi's is probably one that I would choose because of it's authenticity. When I was first introduced to Loi's I thought it was heaven on earth because of how cheap the food was. You would get a big portion of pho for about $2 cheaper than the other places. The rice plates are very big too. For the last couple of days, I've had Loi's pho because I was sick at home and couldn't eat anything else. It's definitely all quantity here. \n\nBut for me the problem is that it lacks quality. The few times that I went with my family and we shared some items family style, I noticed that the meals were just the same except with either rice or noodles. The 5 spice chicken we got was a bit too salty and it looked and tasted exactly the same in both dishes. The broth for the pho was the same as well. First couple of times I went, it was fine. But then as I tried other dishes on the menu, I noticed that it was the same type of broth all across. I suppose that's why they can serve that much cheaper.", "author": "Tom C."}

It's almost habit that we drop by here for lunch after shopping on Irving. You can find many bad things about it if you look hard enough, like everything else. Based on price ratio quality, it's as good as it gets. A medium #1 just comforts me just right. Slices of rare beef, strings of beef tripe, slices of fatty pork log/roll all mixed in w/a clear broth along w/rice noodles in string or 1/4 inch flat form. Comes w/the usual plate of condiments of bean sprouts, lemon grass, jalapenos & limes. Still save myself enough room for dinner later on. For me the larger sizes are too overwhelming & is less enjoyable. Over stuffing oneself is not a healthy way to dine, or order the extra large to share & a side order of egg rolls. Their beef stew over rice is awesome too & lots of pieces of meat w/that half inch of fat hanging on it. Meat lovers know what I'm talking about & the sauce w/cuts of carrots & onions.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-04-10", "description": "There's a right way and a wrong way to dine at Loi's.\nLoi already has an idealized customer in mind, so any expectations you may have as a customer must be set aside in order to have anything resembling a pleasant dining experience.\n\n1. You will need to be exactly a party of four, as the tables are not large enough to accommodate two sets of two as you will be a bit snuggled up to complete and total strangers. If you are a party of one and seated alone, you may be ejected from your table mid noodle slurp at any time, also be prepared to be insulted if you cannot comprehend their increasingly fervent demands to move.\n\n2. Order immediately just after sitting down, not one second longer, as Loi's attention will quickly wan. \n\n3. Order either numbers 1 or 2, or possibly 3 if you feel particularly adventurous. Ordering beyond the number #5 is a dangerous game. Also know as \"The Barnyard Raffle\", ordering beyond these numbers means you could receive anything from pure, iron laden blood to raw egg from one brutally tortured chicken. (**The rest of the menu numbers are really just for show, only vaguely related to the dishes that they describe- for example, ordering a #33 could really net you a #17 or a #51 and these orders are irreversible as Loi's rage, stemming from deep seeded inadequacy, can easily be triggered** )\n\n4. Do not ever request water or dessert. The complementary tea in a child's already dirty plastic cup will suffice. If you ask for anything more than that, as in what you would think would be normal \"ordering\", it is really like demanding these things from a war torn country.\n\n5. Do not ever examine the contents of your broth or what could lurk below your shiny perfect noodles. Eat most everything completely and blindly in front of you, like a hungry person with a severe and possibly life threatening disease. Same for exploring the hygienic qualities of the table, chopsticks, napkins and immediate dining area. These items may or may not have been used for standard surgical procedures, childbirth and/or the strangling and dismembering of \nhundreds of pigs.\n\n6. If you have any leftovers, do not ask for a doggie bag, though if this mistake is already made (And Loi always remembers), you will need to pay for the first edition, classic, state of the art paper container, featuring in cartoon bamboo font \"Thank You\", for the low, low price of 50 to 75 cents depending on how much Loi despises you and/or his day thus far.\n\n7. If you successfully followed items numbered 1 to 6, Loi, although not expressing it verbally or anywhere on his face, will glide past the tables with a certain demented pep in his step and turn the Charlie Chaplin clock backwards several minutes instead of his usually preferred forwards.", "author": "Dan S."}

Beef broth for the pho is hot and good. Beef is not your typical sliced beef, instead its more of a chopped beef (so if you are accustomed to ordering \"beef on the side,\" I wouldn't do it because i think this beef should be cooked well done, plus they charge an extra 50 cents to do so, weird). Tables seems pretty clean, but the floors were wet and there was a smell in the restaurant. \n\nWhat we ordered:\nXL beef pho ($6.50, can't get better then that) - not the best but can't complain. It may not be the beef I like but everything else makes up for it. This dish came out probably 3min after we ordered.\n\nFive spice chicken with imperial rolls on vermicell ($7.50) - not my cup of tea and definitely a dumbed down version. Instead of a thigh fillet, they used a chicken leg quarter. Instead of juicy seared/grilled chicken with crispy skin, I am certain chicken was boiled to cook all the way through and basted with teriyaki sauce on a pan.

After our experience, it is unlikely that we would eat here again.  \n\nWe arrived about 1145 hours and the place was packed.  Luckily, someone was just leaving and we occupied the table.  By 1215, the restaurant had emptied out. It looks like a mom and pop type restaurant and the pop came by to clean our table.  He piled everything into a soup bowl and made kind of a mess while cleaning up.  The table was sticky and the wooden chairs were not comfortable.  Somehow the seat is not very wide and it pressed against the back of our thighs.\n\nThe pop took our order and seemed a little \"POed\".  Judging by the other reviews, it is his normal character.  Plastic cups of thin tea were brought out.  I had an extra large bowl of Loi's special beef pho while the other party had had some vermicelli with five spice chicken.  I can't remember the price of either item, but the total bill was about $14.  The prices are about 10% or so less than other Vietnamese restaurants such as PPQ down the street and there are reasons why.  \n\nThe soup came first and even though it is advertised as extra large, it is no bigger than a competitor's \"large\".  Nothing special about this soup, though their were large pieces of beef that could have been cut to bite size pieces.  Pho tastes the same and the broth is so-so.  The vermicelli dish came a few minutes later and consisted of a side of vermicelli and a chopped up, whole leg chicken.  It is unlike other restaurants and a knife and fork is needed to eat it.  The sauce was too sweet and the chicken flavoring was unusual and not really that appetizing.  Not many veggies were included.\n\nI had my back to the kitchen, but could hear lots of yelling and the sound of loud banging and slamming of the plastic dishes.  It was a man's voice and probably that of pop.  The banging and yelling was unnecessary.  It is though the staff did not care that this noise might disturb the patron's eating experience.\n\nThe restaurant is not very kempt and by the health score, I can see why.  The service is very minimal and we had to ask for the check.  Loi's need to bring themselves to modernize and clean up their act and maybe they'll get as much business as PPQ.  If it involves raising prices, then let it be.  The way it is now configured, I would not want to eat here again.", "author": "Robert J."}

It's the same decorations, tables, seats, and the Charlie Chaplin clock on the wall that would totally entrance me as a kid with its swinging legs.

I still come in and get the same order I've gotten since childhood - Medium #5 (beef and fish ball pho).  \n\nSure it's not the cleanest place and it's dark in there, but it's the quintessential neighborhood dive restaurant that has survived on Irving all these years.  Every few years, new restaurants and chains (ohmygod like 3 boba places on one block, and boba places every which way you look) pop up on Irving, but over time, many of these stores close and a new business moves in.  Loi's has endured on Irving, and I hope it does for another 50 years!  I've moved away from SF and lived in various states in the last decade...everytime I come back to Irving, I'm always appalled and saddened by how much change occurs on this street; however, I can always count on Loi's for its food.  It's not gourmet in anyway, but it's reliable, cheap, and decent.\n\nOverall, prices are dirt cheap, food comes out fast, portions are big, and you come out with a full belly.  What more can you ask for in a meal that can be under $5?  For those who complain about the service, you really just have to get to know the proprietors.  If you've eaten there enough, you'll get to know them and find that they're really nice people.

I saw the decently good reviews, the shockingly low prices, the full house. We popped in and were seated at a very sticky table. We were having a hard time deciding since the menus were not in the least descriptive (special noodle soup.. what makes it different from the noodle soup?), and the waitstaff had no interest in helping. They just kept walking away with annoyance.\n\nWe ended up ordering a few phos and the dry seafood noodle. The waiter brought the pho over and his fingers were alllllll up in my soup, and they had visible grime all over them. The dry noodle was literally dry, and it's supposed to come with this sauce. When asked, the waitress YELLED at us that it's in there, just mix it. It wasn't, and we didn't pay for a clump of tasteless noodles. When we asked another waiter, we were again yelled at, by both waiters, in a combination of Vietnamese and Cantonese. They couldn't speak either very well, and certainly not English. Finally they just slammed some soy sauce on our table and walked away. Then my cousin found a bug in his pho. The pho was bland with very little meat, even though it was a big bowl of noodles and soup.\n\nWhile we were sitting there waiting for someone to go get cash (there was no sign anywhere, not even on the menu that it was cash-only), people walked in and were told they were out of soup. How does a pho place run out of soup? The patrons were bummed but I wanted to tell them, \"RUN, RUN AS FAR AND AS FAST AS YOU CAN.\"", "author": "Vivian H."}

If you've ever made pho at home, Loi's tastes as close to homemade as you can get. They don't give you a ton of broth, just enough to barely cover the top of the meat on the pho, which is another signal to me that they don't want to waste their own broth either. \n\nThis place is the ultimate noodle shop.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-05", "description": "The cheapest pho place I have ever seen!\n\nFor a little hole-in-the-wall type of joint, their menu is decently extensive.  Beyond the usual suspects you'd expect to find, I like how they also offer pho with grilled meat instead of the usual sort of combinations.  So rather than getting it with like rare flank steak, tripe, beef balls, etc., you can just get a bowl of plain pho with a generous portion of bbq meat on the side.  Definitely don't see that available at most places, and it's good for people who may be a little torn on getting a bbq meat rice plate or pho.  And seeing as how I find myself in that situation from time to time, kudos to them for offering a solution to both of my cravings in one meal!\n\nBesides that though, the biggest draw to the place are their prices - I don't think they've changed much, if at all, since they first opened.  And from the looks of some of those tattered menus, that was a long ass time ago! I can't remember the exact prices, but a large bowl of the reguar combination pho runs for about $6.  That's it...$6!  Seeing as how most charge $8 or more, that bit of savings can really add up...especially considering how often some of my friends and I get pho!  And if you do the math...two dollar savings  x  (each time I get Loi's pho)  =  more money for more pho!\n\nUnfortunately, as much as I like the place, there are parts to it that leave much to be desired - particularly the service.  I never expect much beyond \"acceptable\" at divey Asian restaurants, but the waiter can be a little rude at times.  The place is pretty small, so with table space limited, they'll be pretty swift in trying to turn tables over when the line outside start to form.  While that's completely understandable, it's a bit much when he brings you back your tab and stands there next to you waiting for you to sign the slip or calculate the tip.\n\nAll in all, even considering the service, Loi's can definitely offer up a decent value for the money.  The broth is flavorful, the servings are pretty generous, and the prices are super reasonable.  As long as you aren't shy about questionable service, cramp spaces, and semi-dirty tables (five second doesn't apply here...or ever really), you'll probably like this place.

This place is rustic, with old wooden tables and greasy floors. However, its all about the priority of food and service when it comes to rating a restaurant. in my book that is :)\n\ncharboiled pork spring roll:  D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!\n\ntheir Bun Rieu- crab and pork noodle soup: is YUMMY. The taste is traditionally good and orginal.. soft taste of crabby eggy taste with tomatoes lingering in your taste buds. i have tried a few viet restaurants here in the city which serve bun rieu is by far this has the best taste... maybe next time i can ask them to put pork blood on it which will give it more flavor. \n\ntheir grilled chicken pho was alright.. they give you a BIG price of grilled chicken and a bowl of soup and rice noodles. i think the broth could have been a little more saltier or more seasoned, it was some what bland,, but i guess you can always add your table sauces and condiments to it?\n\nid definitely come back here again, especially when im craving bun rieu!", "author": "Steve S."}

I went in around 2:00 p.m. on a Saturday for lunch and was lucky enough to get a table for four.  If you've never been there, Loi's is a really tiny place with maybe about 8 tables.  Both times I have come, I've been lucky and not had to wait for a seat.\n\nThe menus are located at each of the tables, so once you sit down, you can start deciding.  Everything is super cheap here!  I think it is because they haven't changed the prices haven't changed since whenever they first opened.  The menu is pretty standard for a Vietnamese restaurant.  The last time I went, I ordered a basic combination pho and an order of egg rolls.  But today, with the recommendation of my Vietnamese friends, I ordered the Bun Rieu.  This isn't on the menu, but there is a 8.5x11 print out taped to the wall advertising this special.  For those unfamiliar with what this is, it is a rice vermicelli soup.  The broth is tomato-y and has shrimp/crab paste (very tasty!).  I think it is topped with pork (?).  To me, it sort of tastes like spaghetti and meatballs, in a soup form.  \n\nAnyway, all four of us ordered this dish and all four of us thought it was delicious.  A medium sized bowl will cost $4.75, a large cost $5.25 and the extra large is just a little bit more.  My friend and I actually shared a large and it was plenty to feed the both of us.  \n\nOverall, Loi's Vietnamese Restaurant cranks out delicious food at cheap prices.  The restaurant is not very fancy, but it's sufficiently clean and  it's very casual.  All of your napkins, utensils, sauces, (and menus) are already located at your table.  The waitress quickly brings you complimentary tea and they take your order quickly too.  Within 5 minutes, you'll be enjoying your food!  I will most likely be back soon.\n\nNotes:\n-Parking in the area may be difficult.  There are metered spaces in front, or free street parking on the side streets. \n-Try the Bun Rieu!", "author": "Samantha L."}

I almost left right after walking in because of the amount of flies there. Unfortunately, I decided to stay. I've never felt so unwelcome in a restaurant before. I'm sitting there looking over the menu and the old man (owner?) asks if I'm ready to order. I say no, and ask him for a glass of water. He let's out this huge sigh, gives me this crazy look like I'm making some outrageous demand and walks away. He comes back to take my order (still no water) and before he walks away he demands that I put the menu back behind the napkin dispenser. I say, \"Ok I will,\" thinking he'd just walk away. No, he stood there to watch me actually tuck it behind the napkins on the table. I kid you not. \n\nHe finally brings me a Dixie cup of water along with my food. Yup, a Dixie cup. I had ordered the beef stew (#3) and it was just disgusting. It was just bones, lots of sinew, fat, and noodles in a bowl. No beef whatsoever and the broth was bland. \n\nDo yourself a favor and eat at Pho Kim Son on Balboa & 37th Ave instead of this dump.\n\nThe service at Pho Kim Son is great (very friendly & attentive,) the restaurant is very clean, and they have the best Vietnamese food in SF!

The broth had a weird flavor, not smoky, not salty, just sort of rich and...dirty.  My uncle said that when they boil the soup bones they are supposed to skim the scum off the top and they just didn't do that very well.  It added a strange flavor.  I couldn't choke down much of the noodles because they were just sort of bland and definitely not fresh.\n\nThe consensus of the family was that it was a never again kind of place.

What a deal. It filled me up, and the soup base was similar to how my daddy makes it at home.  There was way too much noodles though.I couldn't finish it all.\n\nThere has been accusations that the restaurant is doing something to the food since the prices are so dirt cheap... but I personally think pho, in general, is overpriced anyway. Pho tastes the same in all restaurants; it is usually the soup base that differs in taste. Am I right OR am I right?\n\nAfter all is said and done, this is a good place to get pho for a really reasonable price.

I don't set the bar very high when it comes to customer service in Asian restaurants, but this restaurant is the absolute worst I've ever been to. I ordered the Bo Kho beef stew, one of my favorite dishes in Vietnamese restaurants. The first thing I noticed was the broth, it didn't have that rich brown color like it normally does..it was murky yellowish and tasted awful. I then inspected the pieces of meat, but all for one or two very small cubes of beef the rest of the meat was all nasty fat. Not the glutinous fatty meat, I love that, no this was really just a big clump of fat that hardly looked edible. I laid my chopsticks on top the bowl and waited for someone to come by. The owner finally comes over and I politely and quietly (I did not want to interrupt the dining experience for the other people there) explained that I did not enjoy the stew and that it mainly consisted of big pieces of fat. He instantly started yelling at me and said that I ordered it, so I had to pay for it. I only had a few bites and told him that I was not going to pay for it, because it wasn't made well. He said that is the way it's made as though I've never ordered it before. I stood up and made my way towards the door and he blocked my way and started throwing his hands out at me and started swearing at me and ordering me to pay. At that point the whole restaurant and pedestrians outside were staring after all the commotion he started over a lousy $5 bowl of stew. Worst dining experience I have ever had. Don't be tempted by the cheap prices here: go to Pho Tan Hoa when downtown in Little Saigon or even Pho Huynh Hiep 2 right up the street.

It already gets pretty crowded and there's really not a lot of space to work with inside. So maybe I should stay quiet and let people rumble on about poor service (if i ask for something, they get it for me - they even refill my cup of tea before it's empty), sticky tables (it's from the polyurethane lacquer on the tables - they probably could have used something that wasn't as glossy but the stickiness is NOT from food residue), health scores (in my humble opinion, these ratings are seriously overrated. anyone who has traveled to any other part of the world has undoubtedly encountered something worse than a restaurant that fails inspection). \n\nBut this is one of the few honest to goodness Vietnamese places and I feel the world should know that.\n\nWhenever they run out of broth, it's because they've sold what they made for the day. This means they don't water down like other places. To me, that's assuring quality.\n\nThey keep their prices low (5.95 for XL, 1.75 for Vietnamese coffee). They work their butts off, just like the rest of us so the prices are low. To me, that's honesty.\n\nThere's no place that has better BBQ pork - juicy, perfectly seared, and deliciously juicy. To me, that's special. \n\nI've never been disappointed when I leave because it's pure goodness.", "author": "E L."}

Their prices are still cheap but for my being a loyal patron for 5+ years and my boyfriend being a common face there for 10+ years, this place has really gone down the chute. \n\nIt started with a normal ordering experience except the owner was a bit rude. Fine, busy day, understandable. Brought out some ice water, my drink of choice. It tasted like? Cleaning liquid. It was like the cups hadn't been washed properly and there was still a film of cleaning liquid that came off in the drinking water. I thought maybe it was just my cup, but no, my boyfriend's was exactly the same. So we put those aside and began eating our dishes, which were norm.\n\nThen we asked for 2 to go boxes. He then proceeds to tell us that he has to charge 50 CENTS for EACH box!!!! We mention, we've been here for over 10 years and we've never been charged before. His response? No \"sorry for the inconvenience,\" no \"oh I'll waive it this time but keep it in mind for the future,\" just a cold and VERY rude \"it's expensive for me.\" I know people in the restaurant business and I know to go boxes are an added expense but it's not THAT expensive that you have to charge 50 CENTS for each box. \n\nSo all in all, I think that Loi has just decided that instead of raising his menu prices and driving people away (I wouldn't have minded a 5 cent increase to stay up with the times rather than charging for a flimsy, plastic box), he has decided to charge each person per box. \n\nWith that type of attitude, the now mediocre food, the poisonous water, and the lack of courtesy to say the least, I would not recommend ANYONE go here. There is another tasty vietnamese restaurant right down the street a couple stores in from 19th, right on Irving as well. Let's try supporting restaurants that actually care about their customers. And to think, I put in a great review for its food just last year.\n\n*******\nRecommended Dish: #3 (Beef Stew) & Fried Egg Rolls. This small, cozy restaurant is one of the best Vietnamese restaurants I've been to, impressive considering how many I've visited (at least 20) in California. You may have to wait on weekends and on cold winter nights, but turnover is fast and the wait is worth it. Service is friendly, prices are inexpensive, flavor is phenomenal.

I've walked by this place so many times before cuz it looks like such a hole in the wall, but it's totally a hidden gem.

First of all, I am also a waitress at a Vietnamese restaurant so I am very familiar with Vietnamese food. There is not supposed to be shredded carrots in the peanut sauce or sriracha added in either sauces. I usually just add the sriracha myself. Unfortunately for my friend, she hates spicy food so she asked for peanut sauce and fish sauce without sriracha and the male waiter said this in front of us, \"You should have asked when you were ordering!\" Then he continued to bitch about it in Vietnamese thinking we don't understand, we understood. Also I asked for a cup of iced water for my friend and then he started making a fuss about that too, in chinese, which also we understood. Obviously, the people who work here does not know how to treat customers because it is very stupid to btch out loud, even in another language (I suggest you not to talk crap in any Asian language if there are a bunch of Asians around) It was a big disappointment.

That's why my wife wanted to leave after sitting down for 10 seconds at the last table on the left side.  It was the very first time that she and I wanted to venture out to this tiny crowded spot for some pho. I have to admit I was little bit nervous by the not so clean tables with pieces of jalape\u00f1o sitting next to my elbow, but seeing how crowded this place was, is quite assuring that this place, at least their food, can't be so bad.  I was right. I am still glad I didn't listen to my wife and left the place. I guess women ain't always right about everything (although gents you should always listen to your wife, except when your want to dine at Lois).  \nWe were lucky as we got the last two seats at the corner. Looking at the menu I could not believe my eyes. $ 4.75 for a large beef noodle soup!? What the pho??? So we ordered it and BBQ pork over rice with egg rolls. Everything was so delicious. Especially their broth. By far the best on Irving. I used to go to Kevin's all the time because I liked their broth better than PPQs, but Kevin's doesn't come close to Lois.  Did I even get to the famous bun lieu yet? If you like the taste of crab, well, a stronger taste of crab, then you will surely enjoy their bun lieu. I swear they put crack in it because it is addicting! Bun lieu is crab mixed with egg white and maybe shrimp over tomato broth and vermicelli. I can't believe this deliciousness is like $ 5.75 for a large if I remember correctly. \n\nYes, the owner aka service may not be great. But I like him. He's extremely efficient in his service as he'll minimize the amount of words with everyone. It's understandable because they are always so busy.

I liked getting pho here, and I had no problem with it. But then this past Friday, when it was a super busy night, I decided to go with a BBQ Pork Pho. A friend recommended it and it's a plate of the bbq pork with a big  bowl of pho on the side. I tried it, and I was not very pleased with the taste of the pork. I had to dip it in the sweet fish sauce, that they provide with their really oily and old tasting imperial roll. It helped, but I don't like the idea of doing that. And then half way into the meal, I felt sick. I went into the bathroom, and puked. At first, I thought maybe it's just me, and my taste buds are not use to this style of pork? I can deal with that. Or perhaps maybe the pork was off that night?  But then after me and a friend finished our meal, I step outside, and right in front of the freaking place are two piles of rice noodle vomit. And then no joke, I walk around the corner to where my car is parked, and there is another pile of rice noodle vomit. Soooo maybe it wasn't just the pork that night, but other dishes as well. It sucks, because I did have good experiences here prior to this past Friday. But consistency is really important. Three piles of vomit on the street and don't forget to include my vomit in the bathroom happening all in one night is just way too much. So long Loi's.

I had never been before my girlfriend took me, but Loi's was synonymous with ultra cheap, ultra dirty food.  My girlfriend put it best: \"that the owner has no qualms about scratching his head before putting the food before you\".  Damn...snow flakes in your food...most wadDUUUUP.  Being in the mood for pho, she decided to take me here.  Walking in, this place is a damn hovel.  Taking a menu, I had to hide a laugh.  This menu was so old, yellow'd, and curling b/c of age.  It was like an ancient treasure map.  However, this place is not unlike many Vietnamese/Chinese places.  The service is very brisk and they don't waste time conversing.  They have mastered cleaning tables with a 1 squirt, 1 wipe technique down to a science.  Minimal quirt of cleaner + minimal effort on a wipe = profit.  I ordered the noodle dish with beef and pork skin while KJeh ordered the pho.  10 seconds later, I KID YOU NOT, 10 UCKEN SECONDS LATER, the food arrived.  My noodle dish is very simple...lettuce, beef, peanuts with a bed of noodles resting on top with a side of nuoc nam.  Mixing it all together, I was not that impressed.  The noodles were a likttle tough and dry.  They sprinkled in about 5-6 peanuts.  The beef was good however, and the pork skin didn't add much flavor.  My girlfriend is a fan of Loi's pho but when I tasted it, the noodles were not to my liking.  I did't try the meat and the broth was belly warming, a testament to the MSG laden preparation I am sure.  \n\nLoi's is comfort foot, similar in vein to King of Thai.  It is a quick meal.  In addition, the price was only $10 bucks.  What the hell can you get for $10 these days.  You cannot rate Loi's as a restaurant, as it isn't.  It is what it is - a hole in the wall.

I went to my iPhone and yelped for the nearest pho place. Loi's ended up being the closest to me. I found this place 2 weeks ago and I've already been there twice.\n\nThe portions are super big for the price you pay! So, it's totally worth it! So you may ask why I'm giving it 4 starts instead of 5? Well it's pretty clear that Loi's food is amazing, but let me explain the cons of this restaurant.\n\nThe actual place itself is pretty small, so it's very likely that you'll have to wait. The first time I went there I only waited a few minutes, but this last time I had to wait about 10-15 minutes. I noticed that a few people left after probably being too hungry to wait, so I can see Loi's losing a lot of business from the size of their restaurant. Now, the second reason why I'm giving this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because of the SERVICE! There are only two people trying to handle the entire restaurant. Looks like they're an older couple. The wife is very nice, but the HUSBAND is absolutely horrible. He is rude, harsh and has no sense of customer service. Sir, I understand your restaurant has amazing food at amazing prices, but please try to take a few seconds to treat them with respect.\n\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this place!

I go to get fed and warm. When the lunch, dinner and weekend rush is on, drop all above levels down 1/3. \n\nI won't over-analyze food in this review. I usually go for the noodle soups. BBQ pork and chicken flavors are good. Portion is just a bit less than other places, but it's appeal to me is the lack of MSG symptoms from eating here, the full flavor of food, the heat of the soups, the cool of the bun, and the speed of food at the table.\n\nI actually came here the first time because somebody once yelped this places uses no MSG. After having pho, I had no tinglies in the shoulder, and did not break out in hives. (Yes I am an MSG detector.) After having bun, I did break out - most likely from the marinated BBQ sauce on their pork and chicken. \n\nThis rating is -1 star because of the male owner/server, who has his own brand of customer service, which obviously does not include customer respect. Tapping his pen on the table at folks who he wants to get out is rude even at global train station eateries. Don't expect more tea other than the original cup provided. Don't ever change your order lest the fear of back-kitchen tomfoolery. Hey it's his resto, so whatev. \n\nIf you're not too needy for the touchy-feelies, you can cheaply nourish yourself here.", "author": "Loocha L."}

The place is a hole in the wall and it's literally one of the homey places I've ever ate at. For this place, it really is a compliment.\n\nThe prices are amazing. The service is usually quick and attentive, although I have to say that is probably more about getting me out of there and getting more people seats than anything else, but I'll take it! They're very friendly and willing to explain anything I have questions about what something is if I want to try something new. i usually end up getting their rice plates though. There is just sooo much meat and rice, and the meat is always marinated fantastically. \n\nYou HAVE to at least try this place if you want some good Vietnamese food in San Francisco, seriously. The only thing that pisses me off about this place is that it closes on Wednesday. You have NO idea how many times I've come here on Wednesday excited for some good lunch or dinner only to remember that they're closed, obviously too late.", "author": "Rick C."}

It may be the tables aren't very clean or it's just the texture of the table.  It feels sticky.  Another thing, try not to ask for cold water.  It seems the cups aren't as clean and sometimes my taste like cleaning solution.  I would ask for hot tea.  It's still in the same plastic cup, but at least I don't taste the cleaning solution.  Probably masked by the taste of tea.  \n\nThe food is delicious.  Nothing wrong with the food.  I've been coming here for quite some time.  This may be my last time and I'll explain.  The customer service is the worst.  Makes you feel uncomfortable.  They don't accept credit cards.  While I was eating, one of the customers didn't have cash, so they let them go get cash at a local ATM to pay the bill.  Of course, the customer had to leave their drivers license with them.  Which is understandable.  If they had a credit card machine, it would go a long ways for bring back repeat business.\n\nNow here's why I won't go back to this restaurant.  On my last visit, the owner of the restaurant, who usually runs the front, had an argument with one of the cooks in the back.  I don't understand what they were arguing about because it was in a combination of spoken Vietnamese, Chinese, and English.  But it was loud and heated where the owner was in the middle of the restaurant floor while the cook was in the back.  Yelling across to all the customers to hear.  It looked like there were going to or was about to get into a fight.  \n\nI asked for my check and a a couple of boxes to wrap my food to go because I didn't want to be there when that was happening.  When I asked for the boxes to wrap up my food, they said the boxes were 50 cents each.  I thought I didn't under tand them and said \"excuse me?'  He said \"50 Cents\".  I said \"what?\".  He said \"50 cents each box?\"  My friend said just get it.  My thought was, do they want us to finish our food so I don't have to get a box?  Why is he telling me that a box cost 50 cents more?  Screw it.  I take the two boxes and when I got the bill, there it was.  An additional $1.00 for the two boxes to take the rest of the food home.  I couldn't believe this.  So I paid, and undertip.  Get my $1.00 back from the tip.  \n\nBAD customer service, no respect for people eating at the restaurant, cups not throughly washed.  Food is still great.  But customer service is the worst.  May as well eat a five star dinner sitting at a dumpster watching your back for dear life and avoid people asking youf or extra change.", "author": "Jack L."}

We chose Loi's over our regular place, only because it was a place we haven't been to yet. It's a really small restaurant, a hole-in-the-wall, nothing fancy about this place at all. The menus, utensils, and all your sauces are all on your table. The tables are pretty close together too..only one walkway separates the tables across the rooms. Probably no more than like 12 tables there. \n\nWe ordered the ex-lrg #1 pho ($5.95) and a northern pork noodle dish ($5.75) - the table next to us was having eating the northern pork noodle dish, and it looked pretty good. The pho was pretty good tasty, the soup wasn't bad - but I've had better. The pork dish was yummy - they give you a plate of rice noodles, lettuce, mint/basil/cilantro, and the bbq pork is in the fish sauce and you can roll up the meat in the lettuce or just eat it as is in a bowl. \n\nI didn't like the fact that when we got there the waitress came with cups of tea...and right when she was going to set it on our table she was distracted and started talking to the people walking through the door that she ended up spilling HOT tea on my bf's arm! It was another waiter that saw it, quickly ran over and grabbed the tea from her hand and put it on our table and apologized.

In fact, it seems that the prices haven't changed in ages, which is great in these tough economic times.\n\nThe food itself is fantastic.  The grilled meats are tender and flavorful, the imperial rolls crisp and delicious (not as good as Tu Lan, but great nonetheless), the veggies fresh, and the portions generous.  \n\nEvery time I've been here, the service has been friendly and efficient, if a bit terse at times, which I don't mind so much seeing as how they can get busy and crowded at the drop of a hat.  What we lose in small talk and ingratiating inquiries we gain in speedy meals and good food -- a win in my book.  However, when Papa Loi comes out onto the floor, I can always expect a warm welcome and a smile and, if I ask for one, a free bowl of broth with my rice plates (at least my girl T.L.H. and I have gotten free broth...I can't say it's a guarantee for everyone).\n\nThe space isn't glamorous or modern or hip, but it's intimate and lively and usually full of a nice mix of locals, which is awesome.  I never understood people who complain about the small space or the fact that tables are sometimes shared or that it's not as pristine as other places.  Loi's is what it is -- excellent food at a steal made by good people -- and we like it that way.  The place is an local institution.

I have been eating here since I was a fetus, for at least 24 years. At 27 years old, I have yet to find another restaurant that even comes close to Loi's. The prices are ridiculously cheap and the food is awesome. I've moved around and am now in San Jose, I still make the 45 minute drive just to eat here couple times a month because after living all over California, Loi's is just the best. \n\nOK people, Get over the rundown exterior of the place. Get over the dingy and cramped interior. Sit your ass down, pick up the old ass menus they've had since I was in kindergarten, and just place your order. All of that negativity goes out the window once you dig into whatever you order.\n\nThe PHO, I LOVE LOVE LOVE. The broth is always piping hot and is hands down the best broth I've had anywhere in California, it's just that good IMO. I'm always dumbfounded by how many other places don't serve the soup hot enough, the second you put all the peppers, bean sprouts, basil, and lime in its luke warm. Their broth ACTUALLY tastes like broth!!! Like they actually make it from scratch. Bones, vegetables, etc. Not the homogenized, overly seasoned (MSG?), fake broth all the other places use.\n\nI always order a #9 which is a bowl of Pho w/ a side of bbq grilled beef. SOOO LEGIT! Loi's is the only place I've been to that does this and does it well. \n\nMy GF gets a #10 which is a bowl of Pho w/ a side of bbq grilled pork. Also delish, only downside is the pork tends to be too fatty so i usally stick with the beef. Side note we both stuff ourselves for $20 less if we refrain from the double order of fried rolls mentioned below lol.\n\nWe always share an order of Fried Rolls (comes w/ 3 per order) and always end up ordering another because they are just that good. The spring rolls are good too but I can't find fried rolls like this in San Jose so I load up when I eat at Loi's.\n\nThe rice plates are great also if you don't feel like soup. All the meats are grilled. Beef, Chicken, Pork, Shrimp, etc. I usually stick with the beef or pork chop, can't go wrong there. Good portions of rice, comes with some chopped peanuts and fish sauce (love their fish sauce).\n\nVietnamese Coffee is great here too. Overall the food is amazing and the prices are a steal, I've never had a bad meal here. I only take select friends to this spot because its like my little hole in the wall secret. Pho is usually a matter of personal preference but everyone that I have brought to Loi's LOVES the food.\n\nI acknowlege the complaints about the sticky tables, the flies (when its hot), the restroom is a joke, and the place is overall kinda sketchy from a cleanliness standpoint (I've never gotten sick) haha.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-03-29", "description": "Probably the single worst pho place I've been to. I think it's pretty hard to screw up pho - you actually have to try pretty hard if you're Vietnamese. Chinese people running a Vietnamese restaurant does not produce good pho. At most pho places, the number one is basically the combination, which has everything in it. The broth was very fatty and had the most random stuff. When I get pho, I expect to get thin slices of steak, brisket and all that other good stuff. Instead, I get ground meat. Who the heck puts ground meat into pho broth?! In addition, the noodles were clumped together and it seemed like it was just dumped into the broth last minute. I was thoroughly disappointed and didn't even finish eating it. The imperial rolls were also below average - they fell apart and did not taste that great. I think the one thing that was enjoyable was the Vietnamese drip coffee, but even that could have been stronger. \n\nOverall, lunch was quite lackluster and definitely not worth the wait. When my friend asked for his meat to be placed on the side, they forgot to do that (he asked twice). But then again, you usually ask for the steak to be put on the side (raw) and they didn't have that. I guess it would be too weird to give you ground meat on the side of your pho. The one positive was that the prices here are very cheap and I think that is pretty reflective of the quality of food that you receive.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

The soup takes me longingly back to Vietnam and was an excellent comfort dish on a cool, foggy evening.\n\nI am not a super expert on Vietnamese food but I have been to Vietnam before and I love the delicious beef broth soups with vermicelli noodles (Pho). I have tried 5 or 6 different restaurants in various West Coast cities in the past but have yet to discover anything really amazing in the past on my own (though I was taken to Vung Tao in San Jose and it is to die for, but pricey). \n\nAt some of the other restaurants I have been the Pho is filled with really, really fatty and tough meats including tripe and the soup is left with a floating film of rendered fat which grossed me out. But at Loi's the meat in the #1 Pho (special beef) was very, very tender, lean and delicious and it the was the best Pho I have had. My friend also had the #1 Pho and also enjoyed it immensely. I liked having the Sriracha, fish and dark sauce (similar to Hunan) at the table to customize the taste to one's own liking.\n\nThe BBQ pork over rice with a spring role was also incredibly delicious as well. The cold shrimp rolls were OK, but a bit basic in flavor so I would recommend people try something else for an appetizer. \n\nAfter reading the reviews that described Loi's as \"a hole in the wall\" I was expecting a real dive and was pleasantly surprised to find the restaurant to be clean, maintained and not at all dumpy; I would describe the decor as simple, functional and basic. The service was also incredibly efficient and fast, though not overly chatty/friendly at 6PM with 3/4 of the tables occupied.\n\nWhat really amazed me after the amount of great food was the price - 2 Phos (1 med/1 lg), 1 order BBQ pork/rice/spring roll, 1 order of shrimp rolls all for $20+tip and we finished with a ton of leftovers to save for lunch tomorrow. \n\nIf you have never tried Pho, or have not liked it in the past give Loi's a try and you will surely find it equally enjoyable. \n\nI will definitely be back.", "author": "Mike L."}

Very limited space. \nService: The old man takes charge, he remembers what you order. Great service!\nParking: street. Not too bad for the area. \n\nI was introduced to this place by a friend. He ordered for me, so I just tried what was known to be best.

Most importantly, this is some cheap eat!! \n\nI don't have any complaint in regards of the food and service at all. The only reason why I am grading this down one star is because of the cleanliness of the entire restaurant itself. The bathroom is pretty small, I think it would be a difficult challenge for anyone over 200 lbs.

This restaurant is pretty authentic even if the restaurant itself doesn't look appealing. The place is very small with only a few tables and chairs (which appears to be fairly sticky too).

There's a large variety of Appetizers, Pho, Cold Vermicelli, Rice plates, etc to choose from. This place is even better because the pricing is beyond reasonable.

Deal with it.\n-The old lady that buses the tables is super crabby. Haha, we sat down, ordered #2 (Lois Beef Broth Pho or something) and #28 (BBQ pork and rice). And she yells the numbers at us like \"TWO! TWENTY EIGHT!\" I don't know if that was for our benefit or what...\n-So the beef broth pho was really good. The tripe was really tender. And the broth is delicious. A must try!!\n-The rice dish on the other hand, was so-so. The pork mix on top of the rice wasn't the best I've had and it didn't come with freakin' pickled veggies that these rice dishes usually do. Argh!\n-Two main issues 1. They didn't have that red chili oil that comes in the small container on the side of every table in pho restaurants. I usually mix the hoisin sauce, sriracha, soy sauce and the chili paste and use that as a dip for stuff. Anyways, they didn't have it, kinda disappointing. 2. The bean spouts that they gave us were a little wilted. No biggie, its just an annoyance. \n-The food is amazingly cheap tho. For a large bowl of pho, an eggroll, and a rice plate, it was $13. \n\nCome here and try the pho. I'm not even recommending it, I'm telling you that you have to eat the pho.

I walked in and realized my friends were not joking when they said this place was really small. It was. 8 tables only! Our party of 4 was put in a 6 person table and my friends told me they might give the other 2 seats to others and I was really hoping they wouldn't because it would've been so awkward and not enough space. I ordered Pork BBQ which was not bad but I think I could've done a better job. The pork had a really strong burnt bbq smell. Yes, I know i ordered pork BBQ but it shouldn't have been that strong. In fact, I still smell the burnt bbq breath as I'm typing this post. The tea was just ridiculous. They served it in little plastic tumblers that are for 5 year olds and you would have to ask them to refill it. Seriously? It's the cheap tea that is served in the silver teapot at other restaurants. I recommend washing the utensils in a cup of the hot tea since they were kind of greasy. Btw, my bbq plate cost $5. It was really cheap but I'd rather spend an extra two or three bucks at a place where the food does not reek of burnt bbq and has clean utensils. I believe they do not have a bathroom for customers. My friends noticed I had a disgusted expression throughout the whole meal because I was truly somewhat disgusted. A lot of the noodle soups were $3.95 for a medium. What a deal but seriously you might find this place repulsive. I would only go here if I was extremely hungry and wanted dinner for less than $5. I wanted to give this place 2.5 stars but couldn't. On the bright side, the lady owner was nice but the guy was rude and kept on pushing people to combine tables.

That is the standard dish with which I compare with other Vietnamese restaurant preparations.  This dish has at least five components -  the pork, imperial rolls, vermicelli, vegetables and the fish/dipping sauce.    I thought Loi gave me a decent quantiity of noodles  and the dish came quickly.  The imperials rolls were good, the pork was tasty and plentiful, the vegetables fresh, and the sauce strongly scented.   For the five bucks, a darn good lunch which hit and fulfilled all my caloric, protein, salt, meat, and vegetable needs for the afternoon.   The service was efficient with minimal chit chat -  which is fine since I was there for the food.

The price of Loi's cannot be beat.  Under $5 for a medium bowl of pho?  Yes please!  The flavor is pretty decent and worthy of 3 stars.  The broth was just mehhh.  It was murky, possibly from constant reheating and recooking.   Why one star you ask?  The service was downright rude.  My friends and I were appalled by the way we were treated.  Don't get me wrong, we weren't expecting anything fancy at all and are used to terrible service.  Loi's attitude however, was completely insulting.  When my friend asked twice for a tea refill, she was ignored by all the waiters.  Thinking they did not hear her or understand, I asked a man walking by in Cantonese since I heard them speaking some Cantonese to each other.  The man walked away and went on to continue talking to his coworkers.  10 minutes later, he walks back with a little kettle of tea, looks into my friend's cup, and yells at us saying in canto that there's still some tea in the cup.  He then continues to insult and talk about us in Vietnamese.  My friend's cup only had a sip of cold tea left ...  Bad service is one thing but loudly insulting customers in the middle of a full restaurant is something else.  Do I recommend Loi's?  For the price, possibly.  Just don't ask for a refill on tea.", "author": "May T."}

Many (myself included) find it to be authentic and positively gritty, while some will be turned off by the invariably blaring TV and the no-nonsense attitude of the staff. \n\nI think that what some often intepret as rude is just the staff/owner trying to accomodate everyone in what is often a very busy restaurant. I personally find the attitude to be quite warm here.  I have never felt like the owner was annoyed when I asked for more tea/water, etc. He even took it in stride when, after eating, I realized that I didn't have any cash and had to go to the bank once. For me, Loi's beats the other three pho joints between 19th and 25th in terms of flavor, portions and price. \n\nRecommendations: The green pepper hot sauce on all of the tables makes for a spicily tangy soup that is a refreshing change from Sriracha rooster sauce that spicy Pho lovers often add to their soup. The peppers themselves make nice little appetizers. Of course, Sriracha is also available.\n\nThe creamy crab pho is also very nice and hearty. (Look on the wall as I don't think it's in the menu).\n\nAlso, the crispy bbq-ed meat dishes give you a generous helping of sweetish meat on the side rather than soggy beef in the soup itself. A plate of bbq meat is easily shared. \n\nMinuses: Sometimes their Asian basil is less fresh than other pho restaurants, but I haven't noticed an adverse effect on the taste. The place could be cleaner, but then it probably wouldn't be Vietnamese.", "author": "Douglas S."}

I think it's RIDICULOUS how expensive most pho places are nowadays. Most of the time the portions are pretentious; don't be tricked cuz it's usually the noodles and soup that fills you up. Anyway Loi's is this small, hole-in-the-wall restaurant that is super affordable. It isn't the cleanest looking place but I haven't found any weird crap in my soup yet (phew!) so it's all good. The staff is kinda rude but what do you expect from a place like this. The food is average; pho is pho, every place pretty much tastes the same. The downside is that they don't have bun bo hui (sp?) which sucks cuz it's bomb. Hard to find parking since it's in on Irving. I would recommend if you're running low on cash and want a quick bite. I got a medium size number 1 for about $5 including tip and tax. Thumbs up for a poor college grad like me!!", "author": "Jenny T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-06-16", "description": "Horrible service, dirtiest \"restaurant\" in SF, and even after 9 months I will never set foot in Loi's if it is the last food source on this planet! I still hate this place and advise everyone not to go! Cheap prices are not worth your health and definitely not worth being treated like the dirt they serve you! \n\nI've heard that quite a few people have gotten sick after eating here... PLEASE report it to the Better Business Bureau otherwise they'll continue serving their filth to innocent customers!\n_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ \n\nNEVER GOING BACK HERE AGAIN!!!!!!\n\nI would never write a review if I didn't feel so strongly about something, and after eating at Loi's today, it would not be possible to HATE this restaurant more. Hate is a strong word, but that is the feeling that comes to mind after sitting in the dirty little room, that passes for a restaurant, for more than half an hour waiting for my food. My boyfriend and I walked into the restaurant at 2 something in the afternoon expecting some good food and quick service since there were only 5 other people in there. I've been to this restaurant before and respected that it was family owned and ignored how dirty it was because of that. \n\nBut after sitting there for what felt like an eternity waiting for our food to arrive, we noticed the dozens of flies flying around the chopsticks and soup spoons that were just sitting there exposed in the open. The flies would land on the utensils and clean themselves, undoubtedly spreading bacteria and other unthinkable dirtiness. The menus were disgusting as well. And my cup of tea had some snot or something of that composition on there. \n\nWe sat there for THIRTY MINUTES waiting patiently for our simple-to-make Pho ... watching everyone else get their food before us. I told my siblings and they all thought that was strange since they get promptly served every time, and that maybe we did not get served as quickly because we look like little kids.  My siblings also noticed that non-Asian people and older adults get served before younger Asians, like ourselves. How can you run a business based on these principles?!? Does this count as racism? Ageism? Thinking that the money of non-Asians and older people is better than the money of Asians and younger people? Or thinking that we're too stupid to complain or make a point to blast how rude they are?\n\nSo after sitting there for thirty whole minutes, the lady comes up to us and doesn't apologize or anything... but JUST asks us what we ordered! As if that wasn't enough, they take another TWENTY MINUTES to finally get our order! Then we had to ask them for the bean sprouts and mint leaves because they apparently forgot about that too! When we finished eating and asked for the check, they just told us the price and didn't even offer a receipt despite them giving receipts to everyone else. They didn't even say thank you. \n\nI've been to A LOT of restaurants but have never been so highly disrespected and mistreated. Poor service is not their only problem. They also only scored a 42 out of 100 on their health inspection! I would rather be eating out of a trash can than here! My sister even said that she saw the lady that owns the place drop a meatball on the floor... she just picked it up and threw it back into the bowl to serve to a customer even though she knew that my sister saw her!!! Disgusting! Who would want to eat meatballs that have rolled around on that floor?!?\n\nIf you don't read everything above, at least read this:\nService was horrible: they wasted an hour of our time (that's a whole $1.50 in quarters for the parking meter!), no apologies, no thank yous, serve certain people first even though we were there first and waiting\nFood was raw even with the \"boiling\" water to cook it, didn't come with everything we expected (no sprouts or mint leaves)\nPlace with dirty: flies everywhere spreading bacteria, mucus on tea cup, menus were soiled, pick food up from floor to serve to customers, 42/100 on health inspection\n\nFinal Rating: Negative One Million. NEVER GOING BACK and HOW DO I GET THIS PLACE SHUT DOWN?!?!\nSome of you may have never experienced such horrible service from here, but think about how it would feel if this happened to you because it may (I've been to this restaurant many times before over the years and this has never happened to me until now).", "author": "Mabel T."}

It was my first week moving to SF and my roommates decided to take me here after telling them i wanted vietnamese bun. We pulled up, parked and walked in. 2 seconds later i walked right out! If you've been here, you know what im talking about. It's a tiny place with about 25 people filled in there with a capacity of im assuming 16. No.. that isn't the reason i walked out, i seriously thought this place was a joke and my roommates were messing with me. One look and i was afraid to go back in. This place is def. your old school ma and pa vietnamese restaurant that has not been remodeled or updated since who knows when. We got seated by im assuming the owner, a man that always wears a navy blue vest =) He takes our order without even giving us a minute to look at the menu, but luckly my roommates have been here too many times and knew what to order me.\n\nMy food came out and i was surprise. I got the bbq pork bun (dry noodles) and was amazed at the presentation. It's neatly and nicely packed with a small bowl of fish sauce. I figured the place is known for their food not the look of the place. You might get that icky feeling just dont look around! Eat with one hand covering your eyes and your fine! What do you expect it's a hole in the wall joint! Besides the place the service was fast and this place always seems to have a wait outside. Don't get offended if the man takes your plate/bowl away or in my case cleans the table and throws everything in your bowl right after your done  in front of you. He's just trying to hustle and get people in and out. My roommates and I always try to pay and walk out before getting grossed out to his speedy cleaning routine.\n\nI've been back ever since and i usually stick to the bun or the crab noodle soup and order togo.

I was hoping to find a good bowl of pho and other Vietnamese dishes in the city. I'm very sad to say that my search continues. \n\nLoi's was quite possibly the worst Vietnamese food I've ever had in my life. When other reviewers say it tasted like a foot would have tasted, they honestly mean it. No exaggeration, no humor, no nonsense. They aren't trying to make a joke, the fact is the food was not good. I don't believe the chef has any sense of \"gia vi\" (vietnamese for spices, flavors) whatsoever. What my bowl of pho lacked in traditional flavors and aromas it made up for with salt (maybe it wasn't even nuoc mam), tap water, salt, poor cuts of meat, oh and did I mention salt? The raw meat that goes in your pho was not right...it wasn't quite ground beef but it was close. \n\nI'm being very critical with my review here but it is honestly how I feel about how poor a choice this place was for a bowl of pho. At least the people were friendly and made sure I was enjoying my meal (I forced a smile and lied to the lady that it was good...I don't like to hurt feelings). The place was not that dirty, it was just what you can expect from a pho place in a major city. The family owned environment was nice and I support that, I just don't support the lack of quality.", "author": "Brandon V."}

I don't know about you, but I like to peruse the menu and consider my options and maybe ask what other people in my party are thinking about ordering. But that's just me. So, he ordered beef pho and I ordered ah I forgot the name but it was BBQ beef over noodles with veggies plus an order of egg rolls for both of us. We got the food and it was ok. My friend asked the waiter for some basil because he didn't get a plate with bean sprouts and basil that I thought usually comes with pho but nonetheless the waiter came back and gave my friend a handful of basil. I thought it was a little  strange/unsanitary  that he didn't put it on a plate. All in all it wasn't horrible and it wasn't amazing. It was really cheap, really fast and really dirty.

Loi's meets them all.\nThis is easily one of the last good pho places in the Bay Area.  The prices of their food are still set at the 1999 level.  Easily affordable by all, including me.  A large order of pho is more than many can finish in one sitting and their XL will fill even me up.  They are not one of those modern pho places that give you a huge bucket like bowl but only fill it half full, their pho is filled to the rim with a good amount of noodles and meat.  Bean sprouts and basil are always fresh (the 3 times I was there at least).  and their broth, although like any Asian restaurant, is filled with MSG. It actually tastes like decent beef broth, exactly how pho broth should taste.\nPho used to be my default food if I had to eat out, but recently, Bay Area pho joints have gone downhill.  Prices skyrocketed to an average of 6.95 for a large (often the only thing large about these is the unfilled space in the bowl) and 5.95 for mediam.  Portions has gone down (both meat and noodles, you can grasp all the noodles most pho place give you in your chopsticks pretty easily nowdays) and many start to cut corners on the broth.
