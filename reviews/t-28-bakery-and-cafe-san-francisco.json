She made eyecontact with me and then she purposely ignored us and went to the table behind us even though they didn't even had their hand raised to order either. By now, it was obvious that she was ignoring us on purpose. Then I waited again, and this time I purposely said \"we're ready to order\" and then she said WAIT with attitude. At that instant I left.

It's good and edible, I finished the whole thing since the portion isn't too big, yet I was hungry too hmm. They gave me a lot of beef, and I thought the beef was soft to chew and easy to eat! Sauce was mildly bland, although some parts while eating I could taste it. My friend ordered the baked fish with corn sauce and rice. Fish was soft and I thought this entree was so-so, wouldn't eat it again if I do come here again. Since I ordered from the specials, I get a drink and dessert too! For the drink I ordered iced red bean drink, NO too watered down and tasteless. For dessert I ordered pumpkin with sago and I must admit, this was pretty yums, though very little. \n\nFood came out fast and service was quick.

I knew I could count on T-28 for cheap, amazing food, huge portions and good service. But I came here a little while back and everything has gone downhill. \n\nI arrived on a Monday afternoon with two other people and it was relatively empty. Normally, this place is packed with a huge lunch crowd. What happened? \n\nWe were seated quickly and the first thing I noticed was that they renovated. Okay, cool, that's fine. They now have a jumbo flat screen television and nicer tables. The waitress was attentive and gave us time. She didn't check in frequently but came quickly when we flagged her down to order. I got one of their lunch specials - spaghetti with pork chop, which comes with a drink, soup, and dessert. The others in my party got Hainan chicken rice and beef noodle soup. \n\nOn an earlier visit, we had ordered a great, saut\u00e9ed noodle dish. It was huge and flavorful and delicious. We asked the waitress what happened to it, and she informed us that they reduced the menu. We asked if they changed managers and she said no. I'm assuming the subsequent reduction is quality is because they changed chefs...\n\nThe food came relatively quickly. That's where I was concerned. My pork chop and spaghetti were a bake. Bakes take a long time. (If you've been to Man Kee cafe and VIP on Broadway in Chinatown, you know what I mean.) So I was surprised when it came out as quickly as it did. \n\nIt wasn't bad; it had flavor, it came with lots of spaghetti and two large pieces of pork. But the pork was chewy and definitely overcooked. The soup it came with was bland. I also got a coffee milk tea which tasted like overly sweetened tea with honey and some dark coffee aftertaste. Not pleasant. You could choose between mango pudding or some rice dessert. We got the rice dessert (it came hot), which was good. Not too sweet and very comforting. \n\nThe Hainan chicken was dry and underwhelming. The beef noodle soup was good; nicely cooked beef and flavorful broth. But the broth was definitely full of MSG. The noodles were chewy but not perfect - it would have been better with a flat or thicker type of noodle. \n\nService was great, as per usual. But it can't make up for what's lacking in food. \n\nAll in all, I most likely will only be back out of convenience. Personally, I think Smile House up the street is better than T-28.

He picked the place.....\n\nFirst off, we sat down and the lady gave us a STACK of menus. I mean literally there was like 4 different menus... kinda overwhelming for a small cafe like restaurant. If you came here with no type of dish in mind... you will be screwed and starving because you have no idea which menu to look at and what to choose from.\n\nI ended up picking the 3 items for $19.95 which comes with soup and rice. I find this deal much better than their daily specials, just that the daily specials come with a drink.\n\nWhat we ended up ordering:\n\nBaked pork chops in tomato sauce: I was actually disappointed in this dish. I expected it to be baked, just like those individual baked dishes where the plate is piping hot and there is a baked crust on top. This dish was not the case. If you want a baked item, I would get the individual dish with the rice/noodles underneath it. There was no crispness to the pork and it wasn't actual pork chops, it was just cut up pork slices with white onions and tomato sauce. No bones, no crispiness, no crusty top from baking... oh so sad.\n\nBlack pepper steak: This was good with rice, if you eat this by itself you would think it is way to salty. Also, they are not kidding when they said black pepper steak. There was TONS of black pepper, and I am not saying it as a bad thing... just be prepared if you order this dish and you're not used to that much pepper. BF says this dish is awesome if you stir fry udon noodles with the black pepper steak... I must try that one day.. just not sure if this place does it.\n\nVermicelli with mixed veggies: a bit on the salty and bland side. I mean it literally is vermicelli with mixed veggies in a clear sauce (which could just be salt, water, and corn starch). \n\nAll three dishes, the portions were HUGE! I still had left overs for lunch AND dinner! Just too bad the dishes didn't taste all that good. Service was so-so.

Nobu K thought this place had something to do with a new version of Terminator. So yeah, N-31, T-28, S-69, no name sushi, nothing makes sense. \n\nT-28 offers a mini combo Ho' Ko' style brekkie with a slightly wider range of choices than TKL at $3.75 including a drink!\n\nSeveral varieties of congee or fish soup noodles (supposedly) for the Chinese side of the brekkie menu\n\nand of course the typical fried eggs, bacon, sausage type western style breakfasts bladitty blah blah.\n\njust a little bit more variety than Tak Kee Lee.\n\nSo I opted for the most unique and representative of Macau Cantonese...\n\nand got the salted pork bone congee. It was actually small pieces of bone in pork rib, brined and preboiled (or pre-steamed).\n\nFor $0.25 more I could add either a fried dough stick (cruller) or steamed rice roll crepes (cheung fun).\n\nThe congee was on the watery side, but hell it's cheap can't complain. Had it been thicker and creamier, would've been great.\n\nThe steamed rice rolls/rollades/crepes weren't even from Hon's, but some other generic brand off the supermarket. They put very little effort into providing additional sauces (just hoi$in sauce....). I guess you really do get what you pay for (Tak Kee Lee gave me peanut sauce, soy sauce, splash of oil, and hoisin sauce).\n\nAnd now drum roll please.....\n\nthe hot Hong Kong milk tea\n\nI must say it was quite the disappointment. When T-28 first opened oh about 7 to 8 years ago, it was packed to the gills. The menu actually at the time listed this drink as pantyhose milk tea (using the original nomenclature of this drink). Of course they didn't use pantyhoses to strain the tea leave mixture, but some cheesecloth type thing that stained from the tea and water. Back then I remember this drink being real smooth doing down the pipes. \n\nYears later something was missing. I cannot put my finger on why. \n\nThe iced version was worse...could hardly taste any tea, and it was mostly condensed and evaporated milk flavors, with a hint of sour. This leads me to believe that whoever was doing the tea brewing slacked off, and didn't allow the tea mixture to properly cool down, or the tea \"pulling\" process (where the brew needs to be poured between pitchers back and forth to ensure an even mixing of tea and hot water) was shortened and/or not done enough or done right.\n\nConsidering the competition in the outer Sunset, I'm surprised this place isn't any better. But the locals still eat it up, like that father and daughter, this guy who appeared to be a regular, and this young Japanese married couple. Cheapne$$ and value does not discriminate. \n\nBut bottom line\n\n- T-28 is becoming less and less Macau style Cantonese and more like a typical HK style cafe with a few snacks found in Macau, but nothing in the way of brekkie fare (other than this salted pork bone congee which was a bit of a flop, but cheap)\n\n-Noriega seems to have it better for Ho' Ko' brekkie fare.", "author": "Ken K."}

We ordered the afternoon tea special...sounded pretty decent for $4 to $5, you get food and drink (cold drink +$1)...typical and fair enough. \n\nThe food was just okay. I had the macaroni soup with sausage and spam. It was loaded with what felt like never ending macaroni, but geez, it was oh so salty. My siblings got eggs and sausages; man, those were filled with grease. \n\nAnyways, the service was terrible!!! First they messed up our order. Second, we asked for hot water and it never came. Third, when I try to get the waitress' attention for the hot water and bill, she was busy talking to the back staffs. Fourth, when we asked for the bill, they charged us more than what we had....continue on...\n\nWhen we got the bill, it was over-charged. We studied it before we asked her to come over and found that she charged us for the wrong order she gave us and that was more expensive than what we had ordered. We told her the bill was incorrect and was more expensive than what we ordered, and instead of looking at the bill first, the waitress just said because we had cold drinks. And then when my mom was trying to explain to her we actually only got 3 cold drinks and 1 hot drinks. The RUDE waitress grabbed the bill and started to explain how she calculated OUTLOUD in front of the other table of customers. After that, she ignored my mom and she asked me if I get it? I said yes, and then go on explaining why I think she calculated wrong, and then she straight up cut me off, made an annoying noise with her tongue and said  \"you don't get it\", and explained herself OUTLOUD again. WTH?? Uh...why won't you let me talk. Not only did she not look at the bill, she kept thinking we got it wrong instead and felt annoyed by it when we should be annoyed. It's not that hard, but the whole time she thinks she's right--and the way she handled the situation was super rude and unprofessional.\n\nI will never go back again.", "author": "Mandy C."}

T-28 is the quintessential neighbourhood Hong Kong style cafe, serving local residents in the mainly Chinese area.  This restaurant also serves some Macanese cafe dishes also, and I'm guessing by the pictures of Macau hanging on the walls, the owners may be from Macau.\n\nOne morning, I had toast with condensed milk, and the other morning, I had Pidan Shourou Zhou.  The toast with condensed milk is basically just that - toast lathered with condensed milk.  This is a Macanese specialty and is always delicious.  Pidan Shourou Zhou is congee with \"thousand-year egg\" and lean shredded pork.  This is a very very common Cantonese breakfast.  Both of these dishes were good, but when compared with other places I've had them, not exactly exceptional.  Three stars.\n\nFor those of you who don't know where Macau is - it is a smaller city just about an hour-long ferry ride from Hong Kong across the Pearl River Delta.  It is a big gambling city and it was a Portuguese colony for 400 years until 1999.  There is some unique architecture and also some unique cuisine, but the biggest attraction is still the gambling (and of course.... everything else that comes with a gambling city...  use your imagination).\n\nAnd now, Wikipedia links.

CASH ONLY!!! No money no talk. That said, let's talk about the food. Mediocre. Just in the middle. Not exactly WOW and full of pizazz and not exactly boring to the point of being plain. The food is decent. Like I've said before, it always depends on who the cook is that day and how he's feeling. Sometimes if the cook is angry and lost a ton of money on the ponies and the night before playing mah jong, you're in for a roller coaster of shitty food. If he's happy and made a buck, the food will sing off the plate. And then there are days when the cook takes a day off and the backup is there...Sometimes it's cool, sometimes it's not. If they could only manage to stay mediocre everyday...\n\nThe portions are perfect. Not too big and not too small. You're getting your money's worth here. And the times this place runs is cool, too. Almost to midnight. Which is perfect because there are no bars near here so they don't need to stay open past midnight. Now the wait staff...I'm not sure what is going on with them but one of them is always in a bitchy mood. And it's never the same one that's a bitch each time. It's like playing musical moods with them. If you hate working there then quit. Simple as that. But on the days they aren't soo bitchy, they're on top of their game.\n\nSo for mediocre food, this place is great for you. Not in the mood for WOW? Then you should give them a try. Trust me, your boring ass will enjoy every minute of it here.", "author": "Anthony L."}

Unfortunately, they serve the worst congee I have ever had.  I did not know congee could be so bad.  They reached new depths.  I had the minced beef and egg congee.  I think they must have used a tablespoon of rice for 20 cups of water to make it.  I could not see rice - not even broken down rice.  It was so watery and goopy that it reminded me of what you'd get in a refugee camp or a Chinese construction site.  The minced beef tasted funny.  They put a raw egg in the congee.  I didn't realize it at first so when I started eating, I wondered what that thick, viscous substance was - it was raw egg white.  Yuck.  The best part of this goop was the fresh scallions.\n\nI had the $3.75 breakfast special.  Along with the congee, it came with rice rolls (these were okay; they probably didn't make them, they come with a hoisin sauce) or fried Chinese donut and beverage of your choice.  I had the soy milk which was too sweet.  Despite the low price, I felt dissatisfied.  Rice is cheap, so I don't see why they're so skimpy about using it in their congee.  \n\nIf this is what the Macau twist is, yuck.  I hope that this isn't true for the sake of Macau.  For better congee, go to Ming Tai or Hing Lung.  Well, actually, go anywhere but here.", "author": "Lolia S."}

My first time was a long time ago when this place first opened. And it pissed me off so much because my dad and I were sitting near the window, and everytime the T-train came by, my seat shook. If i wanted my seat to shake while I have food in my stomach, I would ride a rollercoaster. \n\nMy takeout experience was a little more recent. I ordered the curry chicken with rice. The curry was good but the whole meal and presentation of it was crappy. The chicken was in this big patty they didnt even bother to cut. As I'm used to and as normal restaurants do it, but not here, there were no potatoes or even bell peppers! Just chicken, curry and rice. WTH do i have to order curry chicken, potatoes and rice next time to get some potatoes included? For my boyfriend, I ordered this bbq pork + chow fun dish that he always gets. He said the bbq pork was cut too thin, but the gravy on the chow fun was better than the stuff they use at ABC. Price was about normal, 15 bucks for both dishes. \n\nLast to mention, this place is supposed to be open late night. Not sure how late but my friend says it is.

An order of rice porridge which came out luke warm to my surprise and a side dish of chow mein.

I knew beforehand they would probably overcook it because most Chinese restaurants do (I know because I frequent many of these cafes) and my instincts were spot on.  They didn't have the filet mignon but instead regular steak so I decided against my better judgement to try it.  I specify in great detail and in Chinese that I want it completely rare, noting that if I spoke English, they would not know what the heck I'm saying and I didn't want to take any chances.  They gave me this really weird look like \"are you sure you want it that rare\".  I nodded and said yes.  Well, about 15 minutes later my steak came and it was completely cooked and dried like a desert inside.  I bet if I threw it in the wall it would crack it.  I laughed because all this time the ladies looked at me weird and was shocked that I want a steak rare but WTF, it's not like its rare anyways and it's cooked completely.  So what is the difference if I said I want it medium rare, medium well or completely cooked?....NOTHING.  It would come out exactly looking the same.  That is just how Chinese cafes do it...LOL.  Seriously, I think they assume everyone must want it cooked well just because these prudes want it that way.  On top of that, the meat tasted disgusting.  I think it was not stored properly.  So I left most of it untouched and they looked at me like \"what happened\".  I gave them back this look like really, can you not see it's so cooked.  This confirms it.  Sorry but Chinese cafes can't cook a good steak.  They don't listen and they'll cook it that same no matter what you say.  And they use the cheapest meat available.", "author": "Hairy Potmaker C."}

I get food here once in a while and it's usually pretty okay. Their food is not awful nor is it very tasty. Their lunch specials are pretty worth it. For $7.95 you can get an entree, soup, and a drink. What more could you ask for with that price? If you eat in, make sure you have patience, especially if they are busy. I've been ignored here maybe twice and it isn't very great. I make eye contact with a waiter and he doesn't even bring me a menu. When you order take out like a sandwich with fries, they only give you a tiny container of ketchup, which is barely enough.

I went walking along Taraval with my boyfriend on our third anniversary, and we decided to drop by and grab a bite to eat.\n\nI ordered the lunch special, or whatever the menu was called for the food ordered around 2:30PM... We actually wanted to order from the Hi - tea time menus posted on the outside window, but after asking the server, she replied in a semi-angry tone \"THREE O CLOCK\"... I'll bet that if we spoke cantonese like every single other customer in the place, she'd have let us slide.. damnit. (Too bad my bf only speaks mandarin! ) \n\nAnyway, I ordered the beef curry dish over rice, can't remember the exact name, but it's the special for wednesday, and my bf ordered the chicken steak over rice. His chicken came out, at least 30 minutes before mine, because they forgot my order, but remembered every other part of my meal (drink/soup).. we asked the woman about it, and she actually apologized and said she'd get the dish out in 5 minutes! (Unexpected, considering the cold, dismissive way she'd treated us only a bit earlier)\n\nI admit, I could barely taste the milk tea, soup, or dessert I had while eating there, but when my beef came out, I could actually taste some of the spicyness, and the sauce looked INCREDIBLE. I've had curry at many other asian restaurants in my life, but it never looked nearly as fresh and not.. canned or bottled as I'd expect. (it didn't have a too-yellowish, fake looking color to it either, it looked homemade) My boyfriend tried some of it and said it was at least 25 times better than what he'd ordered (haha... the tomato sauce on his chicken steak looked like orange globular vomit). Anyway, I was impressed with the quality of my dish -- fantastic looking, and i was getting hints of savory, spicy flavor. I boxed up the extras, and took them home.\n\nAfter clearing my sinuses with some powerful medicine, I decided to heat up my leftovers that night. And.. that is where the 5 stars is coming from.. IT WAS INCREDIBLE~~... Almost too good for words, it had such amazing flavor for a dish that seemingly came from a mediocre quality place, and after this pleasant surprise, I decided we MUST go back!... \n\nAnyway.. order the beef and curry dish with rice!! Better than any I've EVER had.", "author": "Christine K."}

I go to this place on Sundays to avoid the crowds.  There's never a a line.  There's always daily specials for $7.95 (?) which includes choice of 4 daily entrees, salty house soup, spaghetti or rice, choice of drink (I usually choose between Hong Kong tea or hot fresh soy milk-reminds me of childhood), and very nasty mango pudding.  You probably ask why I go here.  It's comfortable and homey food.  You sit next to the window and you watch the L-Taraval go by.  You see families eating together.  You can actually hear conversations.  The baked seafood has fake crab meat and calamari, one mussel or two.  It's not overpowering and not too much gravy.  The seafood rice is not so greasy.  The Portuguese curry chicken is really good.  It includes two cups of rice.  You have to take home; it's too much.  The shrimp rice noodle comes with both hoisin sauce and sesame sauce., which reminds me of Hong Kong.  The won ton lo-mein looked really good.  The service is typical Chinese.  You're in luck if they are friendly.  They are not there to make your day, just to give you your food.  This is hard work and long hours, so give them some understanding.  Did I mention, cheap!

At home I remake the sauce by adding different shit to it, which further validates my own opinion that I should open up my own Hong Kong cafe. \n\nMy sister's seafood spaghetti with pineapple and cream sauce was decent, though the pineapple in there is questionable. It doesn't make it delicious, so why even put it in the mix? The Portuguese Curried Mussels were OK, just baked mussels with yellow sauce on it. The mango pudding is awesome, though it tastes really processed. Still good, though. \n\nFinal Verdict: If you happen to be in the area, then stop on by! The yummy shark's fin soup will make you cry.

My first impression was that it seemed very clean and newly painted.  I was meeting my sister-in-law for a late lunch, I arrived shortly after her and when I went to place my order, the guy there told me that I couldn't sit with my own party and told me to sit at a table by myself.  Then after I agreed to this outrageous request, a waitress bumped into my baby's stroller while carrying a hot bowl of soup.  My sister-in-law asked the waitress to go around the other way and to not bump into our stroller again.  The entire wait staff refused to go around my stroller and continued to carry HOT food and liquids above my daughter's stroller and then had the nerve to complain about us blocking the walkway, where else was I supposed to put my daughter's stroller??? I had her right next to my table.  The people who worked there were very rude and unprofessional.  They insisted on bumping into my daughter's stroller (did I mention that my daughter is only 6 months old) and continued to be very rude to me and my sister-in-law each time they passed by.  I was so uncomfortable being at this cafe I couldn't even finish my food, which was very oily and had no taste, I asked for a take out box and the guy rolled his eyes at me and then just slammed an empty box on the counter and walked away.  Never in my life have I ever been treated with so much disrespect.  I do not recommend anyone going to eat at this cafe.  I read some of the other reviews and were surprised that I was treated so poorly.  \nTO sum it up, I do not recommend to eat at this place unless you want very bad service, want to put your child at risk of a burn injury due to lack of common sense and tasteless greasy food.", "author": "Sheree A."}

Depending on the time of the day they have random specials. An example would be their 4-6pm Tea time specials. Nice little meals just to tide you over to dinner. There breakfast menu is classic HK style with rice porridge and other Macau style food. It's very clean and well lit. Usually its easy to find parking. I like taking my mom just because it makes her happy and is close. I'm not that keen on Asian food. But this place does blow away establishments such as ABC which is NASTY!", "author": "Mike W."}

I think this is a far superior name to T-28 though the latter has a very Blade Runner-esque quality. This place is awesome for the quintessential hangover food or the late night drunk  dining experience. The white fish rice porridge is pretty damn good especially when you add the homemade chili garlic sauce found at each table. May I also suggest the dried beef chow fun, the ho fun is good and rarely made too oily. I usually order these two dishes and end up taking half of each home. Everything on the menu, especially the late night menu, is super cheap!!! My bill never exceeds $7 if I'm eating alone. I also enjoy their Hong Kong style iced coffee. The service is always friendly and FAST!!", "author": "eric m."}

I usually order the daily specials with imitation shark fin soup (+.50 cent), drink, and dessert for about 7 dollars. The portions are big and the dishes are tasty. They have a variety of other dishes on their menu as well. I don't think any cost more than 6-7 dollars. Really good deal if you ask me.. especially now because we are in recession.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-11-24", "description": "I really think Yelp should modify their rating system because there are just some establishments that just don't deserve even ONE star!!! I don't know what's up with all of the restaurants on Taraval but they ALL seem to be consistently just plain bad!!!! Perhaps they have a \"terrible restaurants of Parkside Union\" or something.  \n\nThe only thing I like about this place was that the setting of the establishment is consistently clean.  The second only thing I like was that their menu was very vast so you can pretty much order ALMOST anything; except ORDERING FOR WHAT YOUR MONEY'S WORTH!!!!!\n\nI'm cook and I know cooking/running a restaurant is a tough business to run but there was NO EXCUSE for their poor services/poor food! I have been to PLENTY of Macao/HK style restaurants to know that there are plenty of restaurants out there that would put this establishment to shame! For example, if you order their \"baked\" plates, you expect to get your money's worth or at least be semi-filled even for your money, well not here.  Their baked beef w/tomato sauce and cheese on top was NO EXCUSE! The whole dish consisted about 90% rice and just a RIPE OFF stewed \"GROUND BEEF---SHOULD NOT BE GROUND IN THE FIRST PLACE\" in tomato sauce with just barely a sprinkle of cheese on top (not even melted and equivalent to a small packet of parmensan cheese you get when you buy a whole pizza).  Oh and here's the icing on top that makes this place the ultimate, \"scam establishment\", I would say for this dish, the only amount of nasty ground beef you got is equivalent to a TABLESPOON of meat.....So there you have it, NOT BAKED BEEF, IT'S BAKED RICE W/TOMATO SAUCE;NO VEGGIES TOO.\n\nSTAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE! IF YOU WANT A LATE NIGHT MEAL, BEST BET WOULD BE TO GO TO \"ABC restaurant and bakery\" on Irving and 32nd street than this dump.\n\nOh and here's what made my evening, the waiters did NOT CLEAR ANYTHING OFF OUR TABLES UNTIL WE LEFT!!!! Our table was so crowded with empty dishes (had to order several because of the ripe-off small portions here) we had a difficult time putting our left over \"dishes of rice\" in a container.  The staff just stood there, dumb founded! A friend and I had dinner at around 7pm and it wasn't even crowded (only one other table besides mine), so there was NO EXCUSE for them to just be standing around, looking in our direction knowing that we had a lot of EMPTY dishes around us and NOT PICKING THEM UP!!!!!\n\nFOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE THIS PLACE HIGH MARKS:\n\nDo you even know what is \"Food\"? Do you even cook or are any of you Chefs???? Perhaps your lack of understanding of food and cooking is what's holding you back from giving an honest review (because you really don't know how to compare this place if you don't know how to cook or have never grown up in a cooking household).\n\nAs a chef, as a person who loves to see customers walk out of restaurants happy (because if you aren't cooking good food/providing good service then you aren't doing your job), and above all as a person willing to try ALL types of food be it game, strange, or foreign I URGE YOU FELLOW SAN FRANCISCANS, DO NOT COME HERE!!!!! THERE'S A REASON WHY SAN FRANCISCO HAS SOME OF THE BEST RESTAURANTS IN THE WORLD, EXPENSIVE OR CHEAP! THERE IS NO REASON WHY THIS PLACE SHOULD CONTINUE TO STAY IN BUSINESS, PLEASE DO NOT COME HERE, SO THAT IT CAN GO AWAY AND SOMETHING BETTER CAN REPLACE IT! \n\nPlease, don't be lazy, just because it's open late, does not mean they deserve to stay in business! There are plenty of establishments that open late, like ABC restaurant (similar to T-28 and just better; not by much but you get your money's worth), just keep looking and don't stop over here!", "author": "NeverFoodFull F."}

T-28 is like another D&A but better .  They have late night special which and another special which is 3pm-6pm . They have a variety of food . They offer a lot of interesting things other cafes in SF don't offer . This place is very clean . They have a flat screen where they play chinese karaoke songs but you can barely hear them because the volume is turned down so low . The HK milk tea was way too bitter . Seems like they put too much tea and didn't put any condensed milk or sugar . The wonton noodle soup was ehh .. mediocre . The wonton didn't look like wonton at all .. they were very big and tasted like sui-mai . The noodles that came with the wonton got tiring . The macau style pork chop bun was suprisingly good .The jook was very good too . It was too liquidy like the jook you get at ABC but it wasn't too thick either . It was just right and full of flavor . The porportion was just right . I love their hot sauce !! It's not the cheap hot sauce other restaurants and cafes use . The hot sauce is very flavorful . Dirty cheap prices for good food ! Two wonton noodle soups , a jook , a macau style pork chop bun , a jelly hk milk tea , and a ice cream float came out to be only $20 !!
