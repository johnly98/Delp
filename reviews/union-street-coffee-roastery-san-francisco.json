The coffee is strong and the family that runs the place is super nice. There are other breakfast type foods available (ex: sandwiches, bagels, muffins, cookies) but I usually just stop by for coffee. It's not the swankiest or nicest looking place but it doesn't pretend to be anything that it's not.", "author": "Al D."}

This is post is mainly for the staff sweeping at the patio, who is very rude. \nI sat on the chair at the patio using my phone, before entering the cafe.  The staff came out with a broom, and started sweeping right next to my feet. He did not say a word. (I heard him speak English so it's not a language barrier). I stood up, and moved away from the chair, so that he can sweep. I had expected an \"excuse me\", or \"May you move so I can clean this area, etc.\", but he said nothing. Then, he continued sweeping for about 5 minutes, while I kept moving away so that he doesnt' bump into me. Then, the staff looks at me like I should leave the patio, or go somewhere else. \nThat's very poor customer service! Any guests on the patio is a potential customer! Should not treat a customer like they should leave so that you can clean! And because of this behavior, my friend and I decided to dine somewhere else.", "author": "Jess W."}

As I have gotten older I have learned that SF is known for all the restaurants, shopping and theater.  I like to call it a mini NY because you have all the quaint little shops and grocers in the neighborhoods along with different mom and pop restaurants.  I LOVE the personal touch of going to family own business'.\n\nThis place was right down the street from our apt. We saw it the first day and was drawn in by the massive BEAN ROASTING MACHINE they have inside.  Yes they actually roast their own beans before brewing them!  Talk about fresh!\n\nWe didn't think they had food, food unless you wanted to eat some fruit or a pastry so we waited and came back later.  We ended up stopping by on our way out of town.  They have coffee from ALL OVER the world and I do mean all over!  HUGE bags of coffee beans in their natural form.  It's GREAT!\n\nWe ordered two coffees and found out they do have some hot breakfast foods in the form of bagel sands and ritos.  We each got a rito, paid and went to find a seat.  They have a nice sized seating area or you can eat on the little steps where there is one table looking out onto the street.\n\nThey gave us our cups with coffee and we went over to doctor it up.  The coffee was SUPER HOT and FRESH!  I think I burned my tongue.  But it's a small price to pay for fresh hot coffee.  They brought our ritos to our table.  NICE and hot.  They didn't take too long to make I'm guess that they are premade and froze then heated up.  \n\nEverything was really good and a NICE way to start the day before heading out to the airport.  It was also GREAT because we could call for our Uber and it picked us up right in front of the coffee shop.  No extra walking.", "author": "Ryan P."}

Sorry, but I changed my mind! People still do that, right?  Yes, it's a little annoying (I'm in retail services too) but I wouldn't ever be so bold rolling my eyes and telling a customer off like that.

I was sitting right next to the counter and the girl didn't even call our name or let us know the drink was ready.  When he drank his latte, it was cold and it tasted like the milk had curdled.   We left the drink and cake there and left.

This is a nice looking place with a creative menu. However, the service was...awkward. I ordered an espresso. When I gave the cashier my credit card to pay for it he took the card, flipped it over and analyzed it, and then gave it back and told me that there's a $3 minimum for credit cards (darn). I didn't mind paying for my order in cash, but the fact that he took my card and looked over it and THEN told me that I couldn't pay for my order with the card was suspicious. Either he wanted to check my card out or he thought my card was fake (because it's one of those ostentatious gold capital one venture cards ugh sORRY it's not my fault I wanted flight points on my credit card). \n\nAnyway, the espresso itself was served to me within seconds. It tasted awful. I've had espresso from various locations in this city and each time the flavor of the blend is different, but the pattern is the same--an initial warm bitterness that fades out into the flavor of the coffee blend that is used. This was so different, and not in a good way. It was an initial liquid-y-ness (almost like drinking hot water) and it faded out into a back-throat bitterness that was terrible. My only explanation was that the espresso maker might not have been good.\n\nLife is too short to consume bad espresso. Avoid.", "author": "Idk A."}

But seriously, 2 visits a day, 5 days a week for about 5 months.  How hard would it be to act like you recognize me from a few hours ago.\n\nI know it sounds petty - but I'd rather walk the extra 4 blocks and pay less for a larger cup at Starbucks where after 2 weeks, they recognize me and remember my order.
