A friend that we were with suggested this place because he said they had a good deal on drinks. A beer plus a shot for $7? Sure why not! \n\nThe first bartender, a Caucasian guy with a beard was the first to serve us. Have no complaints about him, he was very amicable and funny. We drank our beer, took our shot. \n\nWe saw they had a juke box so we decided to put some music on. The playlist before us consisted of 70s, newer alternative rock, and some heavy metal. Pretty much a variety and mos def random playlist ever. But that's what you expect when you have a juke box in a bar. My friend decided to play some Shania Twain, I'm not a fan myself but hey, we all have our taste in music. As soon as the song came out she yelled out a \"woooo Shania\". We finished till her song played and left. \n\nWe took a walk around to check out some murals and decided to go back to the bar. As soon as we walked in, there's a Caucasian female behind the bar yelling at us to get out of the bar & that she was no longer serving us. I asked her what the reason was and she yelled,\"last time you guys were in here you were really drunk. I'm not serving you, get out!\" (No we were not drunk, there's been worse times) Mind you, she had a smile and a \"have a good one\" attitude the first time we left. She didn't seem annoyed or angry the first time. The screaming was so unnecessary. No one was raising their voice, or arguing with her. \n\nSo embarrassing and uncalled for. I believe she just wasn't feeling our vibe and music and needed any excuse to kick us out. I wouldn't recommend this bar unless they're ready to meet a rude bartender. Totally killed our experience, will not spend another dollar in there until she is gone. I will not feel discriminated against no matter how cheap your drinks are.

The old blond one is a bit of a pill, but lovely Audrey more than makes up for her colleague's lack of personality.  \n\nLet's get to brass tax though. You are here for the booze anyway right? This is a whiskey bar kids. If you want some pansy ass vodka drink, you are standing in the wrong building. I don't know how many different kinds of whiskey they have, but when I close my left eye and steady my head, it looks like about five hundred...

They have a jukebox, a pool table, and a decent selection of beer and spirits.\n\nThis may not however be the right place to bring 70 people for happy hour. \n\n********************************\n\nDive bars are notorious for being badly managed. Someone inherits 50 grand and decides to buy a bar having little or no management or service skills and that's par for the course. Dirty Thieves however is owned by a guy that used to co-own a bar, Two Thieves, and he worked at Crow Bar on Broadway for years so I would expect something more..\n\nI like this bar and wanted to introduce it to my dive bar group. It has a decent selection of beers, a pool table, and a nice open space. I posted the event and about three weeks before tried to contact the bar and let them know we were coming. I sent them an email on their MySpace page and didn't hear back. About two weeks before the event I called and tried to get any contact info for the management and they said they couldn't find it. The week before I went in to try to at least warn the bartenders we were coming because the RSVP's were growing. Finally I talk to the owner and the manager. I described my group and told them between 40 and 50 people were coming. I negotiated an extended happy hour and felt satisfied that I'd finally got through to them and everything was arranged.\n\nThe day of the event comes and I show up a bit early to introduce myself to the bartender I slap on my name tag and say \" Hi I'm Tom from the Mission dive bar group\" and she just looked at me like I was crazy. I said, \"I'm expecting about 50 people tonight\". Her eye's get big and she say's, \"WHAT!!! I'm here by myself\". I told her that it was all arranged as well as the happy hour agreement, she should call the manager to verify and that we were a patient group so she shouldn't worry. She did a great job, and probably had a great night tip wise but that isn't really the point. This whole thing was a communication cluster f*ck.\n\nThe event turned out to be bigger than I expected and there was more like 70 people that showed up for it. I conservatively added $750 dollars to their receipts for the night and $150 to the tips. I feel like all my drinks should have been comped but I wasn't even floated a single one for free.\n\nI like drinking here but it's too disorganized for me to ever use it as an event venue again.", "author": "Manny F."}

What is this, bizarro world?!\n\nI wandered into this place at the direction of a very gracious local host. It seems to be a tad off the radar, but hat could be due to the fact that it was a Thursday night, and not in the full weekend swing. \n\nI was confronted by a small, dark space with cool rounded booths, an awesome selection of liquor (including Old Potrero18th Century Style Single Malt at $15  for a healthy shot), friendly, unpretentious service, a cash only bar, and a chill crowd that consisted of a mix of old and young professionals alike (professional drinkers, that is). There are 2 flat screens above the bar, which turns this from a dive bar into... well... I don't know what kind of bar to call it, but I like it. A divey lounge? It's not a sports bar, and the higher-end selection of brown liquor makes me shy away from the dive category. Whatever. It defies categorization, and that's probably why I liked it so much. \n\nPlus, I got to watch the Lakers lose on their home court in the playoffs. \n\nThere's a pool table in the back, and the juke was playing some classic rock... not top-40 classic rock, but some quality lesser-known jams. Some of the older dudes were dancing around the bar to the particularly rockin' tunes. Everyone seemed to be down. \n\nThere's a pool table in the back as well, which is another plus that would keep me coming back to Dirty Thieves time and again.", "author": "Don B."}

You should feel \na little bit like you are taking your life in your hands at a dive bar.  You should feel as if Tom Waits could be sitting down at the end of the bar, or that you might have to step over Charles Bukowski on the floor of the bathroom.  (Yes the ladies room--that dirty dog!)\n\nJust because they didn't clean the place up the other night, doesn't mean they're a dive bar any more than I am a diva just because I belt out a mean drunken karaoke of \"I Kissed a Girl!\"  So when I find a place like this categorized as a dive bar--I have to protest.  Dive bars do not get the same clientele as Elbo Room.  This is a neighborhood bar with hipster leanings that happens to serve some mean whiskey drinks.  (No I'm not drunk right now! Never drink and yelp!)\n\nSo what's my point? Okay, nothing. I really dug this place. Me and my Jesse Eisenberg lookalike of a date (he loves it when I point out his resemblance), came here after our semi-successful salsa night.  The atmosphere was really pretty cool and crowded. We shared a booth with this hipster and his tattooed girl and had a blast. He was one of those conspiracy theory guys who thinks Bush did 9/11 and the moon landing was a hoax.\n\nThe juke box is great in this joint and the drinks really pack a kick.  Jesse had to help me back out of the place because they kept on sliding the pub walls back and forth by the time I got up. Darn trick bars pretending to be dive bars!", "author": "Nikki K."}

I was kind of tripping about going in this joint because I used to live less than a block away when it was still Treat Street Bar.  I had never gone there, but saw a lot of strangeness go down outside.\n\nAnyhow...  I found a stool and pulled it up to the bar.  I ordered a Jack and Coke for only $5!  SWEET!  The bartender (female - didn't get her name) was not only personable, but checked in a few times to make sure I had plenty to drink.  \n\nThe other thing I really like about the place is that there are comfy looking booths and they aren't directly smashed up behind the bar stools, leaving an area about the size of a stripper's \"landing strip\", for a walkway.  This place actually has room enough to dance, should one be so inclined.\n\nA friend of mine suggested we start a list of at least 5 bars/hood that we frequent that are our \"go-to\" bars.  Dirty Thieves would definitely be on the list for The Mission.", "author": "MoMo D."}
