For $28, you get a lot of variety and choices of meats to choose from.\n\nOrdering meats and broth is as standard as any other hot pot place. After you order, they have a whole buffet bar for side dishes. Go and choose from various types of seafood, vegetables, noodles, and sauces. It's so cool seeing everything laid out in front of you and you just get to take whatever you like, and however much you like. And even though the place can get crowded sometimes, the staff always replenish the bar whenever something runs out.\n\nThe beef is tender and juicy.

It's definitely time for an updated review.\n\nAs most of all Yelpers know, the experience of the restaurant doesn't stop at just the food. It's a whole package experience from the approach of the restaurant, the service, the ambiance, the food (of course), the cleanliness, all the way to you step foot out the door. Some thing must have happened during these two years because the staff at Fiery is slamming down their house rules on their customers like you're attending class. I intended to enjoy a relaxing dinner with my family, I wasn't expecting nor prepared for a dining 101 session at the beginning of my meal.\n\nFirst of all, parking in the area was relatively easy for a Sunday night. Fiery made it super easy to get on the waitlist through Yelp so you can time your arrival to be seated promptly. Got 3 adults, 1 child, and 1 toddler in my party (toddler under 3, free). Because of our party of 5 (toddlers are people too), they pushed a 2 seater table together with a 4 seater for our party. Waiter comes over to take our order, specifically asked for the kids age and then as if I could hear the class bell rings, class is in session.\n\nRule #1: You only have 3 adults and 1 child, toddler eats free. We can only give you ONE pot. You don't meet the minimum requirement to get 2 pots, extra pot will cost you an additional price of an adult ($20+).\n\nRule #2: Your dining session is timed at 90 minutes, it began as you get seated. (We nodded, but he repeated a few more times as if nodding is not the universal gesture for understanding)\n\nRule #3: We will charge you for any excess leftover food as we shall deemed appropriate. (He tried to repeated it a couple more times, but by now he can tell we're annoyed so he didn't attempt to remind us for the 3rd time)\n\nRule #2 and #3 is very typical in most other hot pot places, it's normally written on the menus, not thrown in your face a few times to make sure you're aware of it. I think we were just minutes away of them bringing over a written consensus form for us to sign to make sure we understood their rules. Rule #1 was a strange one too me. They formed a 2 table seating situation for us with two burners available. Throughout the whole dinner, that one burner was unused. What if I were to ask for an empty pot and get soup in there as they offer us refill soup? How much more trouble would it had been to just give us the pot of broth in the first place? AND, nowhere was there any information you must meet a certain party size to obtain a # of soup pots.\n\nThe whole no this, no that orientation left such a sour note to our dining experience. It was as if they were trying to convince us not to dine here. Although their food and arrangement of food station set up is great, I guess I have to grant their wish to take my future business elsewhere.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

Never had to call out to servers because before I even had to look up, one of them was in their way! So good!  Definitely a change of pace for hot pot joints.  Service was very friendly and hospitality was evident from all the workers. I enjoyed hearing them give a \"method to the madness\" to some newbies to hot pot.\n\nThe broth was okay. Had the miso and the rich beef. Nothing much to talk about. Felt like there was something missing---like depth in flavor. \n\nI enjoyed and was grateful for the variety of vegetables and meats besides the shabu meat on the menu. Yes the menu selection is limited but what makes up for it is the sides and veggies and other meats like tripe and beef tendon.  The dipping sauces were limited. It.mightve been me but the sesame sauce tasted off. And yay tons of garlic!\n\nEnded the meal with cute dessert-lychee ice cream and watermelon sago!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-19", "description": "Most Cantonese folks have traditionally grown up having hot pots at home. It's one of my fondest memories, as this was always considered a special treat in our household. Whenever I came back home, after getting a \"real job\" and thus, becoming a\"real adult\", my Dad would ask what I wanted for dinner whenever I went back home to visit, and hot pot was always my first request. It makes me teary-eyed just thinking about those good ole' days, and Cantonese-style hot pots will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nWell, this kind of dreary weather has had me craving to be around a huge bubbling hot pot, surrounded by an endless amount of meats, veggies, and tons of classic hot pot sides. So, of course, we came to Fiery Hot Pot. This is my favorite hot pot restaurant of all. Hands down, no doubt!! Why?\n\n- Fresh veggies and lots of great sides, all self-served, but nicely presented in individual containers. Most everything you'd want in a Cantonese hot pot is here. Think fresh and fried tofu, shrimp, tendons, fresh and baby corn, lotus roots, a variety of mushrooms, including enoki and wood ear mushrooms, tripe, mussels, bean thread noodles, udon noodles, ramen noodles etc. Plus a variety of greens, including spinach, baby Bok Choy and watercress. If you have vegetarian leanings, you can live on this section alone.\n\n- Fresh meats and fish.  I usually get the rib eye and American Kobe style beef. The chicken was dry, so I wouldn't suggest that, and I haven't tried the lamb, so unable to comment on these. For me, it's \"Where's the beef\"?\n\n- Excellent, clean presentation. The self-serve section is very well maintained. It's not some sloppy picked-over buffet. Again, the buffet items are served in individual containers, so no need to pick up a serving utensil that 25 others have just touched with their yucky germ filled hands. I'm no germophobe, but that's how germs are passed, and that's how you get sick. No worries about that here.  Really like this clean sanitary concept!!\n\n- Modern, clean, relaxed decor. \n\n- Friendly, attentive service. Refills for sodas, water and broth showed up often, without even asking for them. Imagine that, in a Chinese restaurant. Wow! It can be done! They need to share their best practices with other Chinese restaurants.\n\n- Flat price ($28.00/pp) includes bottomless soda, AYCE food, free rice and even a choice of two desserts.  No trying to nickel and dime you for a $2.00 bowl of rice, etc. So tired of that b.s. You won't encounter that crap here.\n\n- No SF Healthy Tax added to your bill! Wonderful!! This is the way it should be EVERYWHERE!!! It maybe rolled into the price, but not added as a separate charge, which is just plain untransparent. Restaurants who add a separate charge don't want to roll into the cost of the food, in fear that people will see the prices, and won't want to pay the added cost. But, at the end of the day, you ARE paying it. So just be upfront about it, like this place, and tell it like it is. It is what it is, so don't try to hide it. This restaurant deserves kudos for this!\n \nI must admit that their set-up might even be better than what we had at home. Of course, in my book, there's nothing better than sitting around a table with family in your own home, but there's no clean up here. Moreover, realistically, you're just probably not going to have like 40 plus kinds of different foods. It just isn't done on such a grand scale at home. However, you can have it all here!!!", "author": "Lori N."}

Fiery Hot Pot is an all you can eat hot pot place located on Taraval. \n\nWhat I love most about this place is that at the back of the restaurant there is a station where you can create your own sauce. They have so many different sauces you can combine to make your own plus ingredients like jalape\u00f1o, garlic, ginger, and cilantro. \n\nThey also have all the vegetables and hot pot ingredients in small bowls out back so you can grab what you want to eat. You don't have to place an order for your veggies, just grab what you want and bring it to your table. For the premium meats, you do have to place an order with the server. \n\nWhile I love the concept, I'm not a fan of their soup base. Both times I went, we got the split pot so that we can try different soups. The first time, we got the spicy beef and the spicy pork. The second time we got the curry and the spicy miso. Out of all four soup bases, I think the curry was the most delicious and the most flavorful. My friends loved the spicy beef. The rest of the soup bases were a little disappointing.

My whole group of seven waited patiently outside for my name to be called since it was packed inside. After about 10 minutes, we checked the waitlist and somehow was removed. We asked the server and she said she called my name out inside and gave our table away. We told her we were waiting outside the whole time and she said sorry I didn't go outside but she will give us the next available table. The party that took our table wasn't all present yet (1 out of 8 was there). \n\nFinally got seated at a table that had two burners... when we started ordering our soup base, server says since we have four adults and three kids, we can only have 1 pot of soup. Their explanation is: since the three kids are under the age of 3, we don't charge them and therefore you can only get 1 pot of soup and if we want an extra pot we would be charged $20 extra.\n\nFast forward to checkout: to our surprise, we got charged an 18% gratuity  even though the charge is for four adults. They didn't give us an extra pot of soup because they were not charging for the kids but they're ok with charging us a service fee because we had kids. \n\nOverall experience was bad because the customer service and stingy management.

The exterior looks tiny, but it's not as small as you would think as you walk in. We got seated right away since we got there around 7:20 on a Monday night. The menu is small so it's not hard picking what you want. You get to choose up to two broths like many hot pot places. This is AYCE for $29 per person which is a usual price point for AYCE everywhere. For our broths, we chose the \nvegetarian spicy miso and the beef broth. They offer a buffet style for the sides like ramen, udon, fish balls and fish cakes, etc. For the meat, you order wit the staffs and they're very efficient with it so you get to eat all the meat you want without time wasted. I first tried the broth and both broths were very intense with flavor. However, I thought the meat tasted a bit funny, it looks fresh and all but it had this taste to it. Overall service was good, but I didn't think this place was all that.", "author": "Lisa W."}

He encouraged us to please come and we even took his recommendation on broth choice (spicy beef and roast pork). \n\nThe price as of this review is 29$ per person which is average price for most ayce hot pot. I would even go to say that it's a thriftier option. Soda and tea is included as well. While most shabu places will give you an assortment of options for their soup add ins, this place has a buffet like station to pick up whatever type of noodle, vegetable, tofu and others you wish to enjoy. What's great is that it minimizes waste for the restaurant and allows the servers to focus on drinks and meat orders. In addition, it allows eaters like me to pile on my favorites without filling up on items I don't enjoy. \n\nThe place looks fairly new by the decor and include a few tvs to watch sports. \n\nThis place is a must go in terms of value, service and atmosphere.

I came with my bf for dinner after seeing some yelp pictures. It's $28 per person, which is standard AYCE price. We also ordered some lychee soju for $12. Since we came early at 5pm, there was no wait, but by the time we finished eating around 6:30, there was a crowd in the front area.\n\nYou order your soup and meat with the server, and then visit the sauce bar and buffet in the back! The sauce bar had a few different sauce bases and the usual toppings like green onions, garlic, chili oil, etc. The buffet had anything you could ever want in your hotpot! I loved the fish tofu, fish ball with roe, diff types of tofu, quail eggs, and all the veggies. We ordered the pork bone broth and tried the rib eye, wagyu (daily special), and lamb. I liked how everything came in small portions so you could get as little or as much as you please. Even the meat came in smaller portions than usual, which may be bad for big groups, but is perfect when you're only with one other person like me.\n\nThe service was suuuper friendly. I would come back because everything was yummy! The total price was a lil expensive, but I guess that's expected with all you can eat.", "author": "Tara A."}

The portions are well managed so you can always go back for more\n3) The meat slices are HUGE! The brisket and supreme beef were both delicious\n4) They also offer all you can drink for not all that much more ($7 or $8). Otherwise, you can just grab a pitcher of beer for less than $10. \n5) They include two different desserts as part of the payment: a mango sorbet or a honey dew rice pudding thingy\n\nCons:\n1) They spiral the lamb and supreme beef into a rose shape which looks nice but is a PAIN to unravel to eat. You end up just having to tear all the pieces apart to get a thin slice to cook. \n2) It would be good if there was more table space...or if maybe they collected plates faster. We ran out of space a little bit though not terrible\n3) They seem pretty strict on their time limit and suggest only being seated once everyone in the party is there because once the party is seated, even if not complete, the clock starts\n4) They're really far away... hard to get there without a car\n\nAll-in-all, pretty good. Better than some other AYCE hotpot places in the same price range.", "author": "Liza X."}

This place is really solid!! Went on weekday around 7pm with no wait time at all. The staff was really attentive and asked immediately if we want something to drink because it was included in the AYCE price of $27.99 !! He also came around asking if we wanted more meat which doesn't happen often at AYCE hotpot. Maybe because it wasn't that busy when we came in, but afterwards it was busy and he was still attentive and made sure that we had a good experience!! \nWe got the MALA Spicy beef broth & Regular Beef broth. OMG, i never tried such flavorful brother before!! Once your beef is cooked from the soup, the beef doesn't even need the additional dipping of the sauce!! WOW, really never tasted beef that great with just the broth alone.\n\nBesides the Meat, there is a station where you get your own veggies, random sausages, fishcake, shrimp, noodles, and etc. Which I think is great because you get to choose as much as you want without having to ask the waiter! Saves so much time!!! \n\nThe sauces are decent, wish they had a better \"chilli oil\" to be honest, but who cares! Their broth cover all the dipping sauces! I'm impressed with the exceptional service from the server and the owner I believe? \n\n\n\nOMG, they have BOOOOOOOMMMMMMBB asSSSSSSSAASSSSS Watermelon Sago and Lychee Ice Cream!! Holy shit! It was so refreshing to drink the watermelon sago after having such \"heaty\" hotpot. ( If they actually sell Watermelon Sago, I won't mind coming once a week to buy the drink, HAHAHA).  \n\nWill definitely come back here!! Highly Recommended.\nP.S their ventilation is one of the best(you can hear it blasting near the front counter area!!  I always walk out AYCE HotPot Place smelling like... I was in the kitchen  war ZONE!!  which isn't pleasant.... and the smell lingers afterwards. With this place though, man I did not STANK!!! There was little to no smell from the hotpot on my clothing or my hair. Usually my hair would capture any type of smell pretty quickly, but after walking out, my hair still smell like my conditioner!

They are 1/2 buffet style and 1/2 order.  The sliced meats are ordered from the wait staff and all other items (veggies, various balls, hot dogs, spam, tendon, tripe, carbs, etc) are located at the buffet in the back of the restaurant.  Some of the leafy greens at the buffet were a little wilty or showed some browning.  They also have a DIY sauce bar including peanut, soy, xo and other various sauces.  Unfortunately they did not have a chili or chili oil type sauce.  A light dessert is included in the AYCE. \n\nBroth: There was a decent selection of broths, at our table we chose veggie miso, (very) spicy beef, spicy pork, and curry.  The broths were ok, but didn't really infuse the meats with much flavor (hence the sauce bar).  \n\nService:  The staff were very attentive.  We ordered several rounds of sake. Plates were cleared efficiently.  Considering how large our party was, the staff were troopers.  They even accommodated a cake at the end.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

You know I would've asked for Tasty Pot (aka torture for my bf), but I wanted to give him a break from always feeling obligated to eat there with me. He always goes, \"Anything but Tasty Pot, please..\" So out of love, I only did the next best thing and ate at a restaurant he liked!\n\nWe called in to put our names on the waiting list even though when we arrived there was no wait. We were seated immediately. I guess it just depends because I heard it can be one hell of a wait. \n\nWe were allowed to choose two broths and so we went with one of the meat broths (idk which...) and some spicy one. We ordered the same four meats constantly: rib eye, supreme beef, premium lamb shoulder, and fillet-of-sole. They had an endless self-serve bar serving a variety of seafood/meat balls, shellfish, noodles, veggies, and oo seaweed salad (love dis!!) I'm not super into veggies when I eat hot pot - I literally just eat napa cappage. They've got a variety of sauces as well. I couldn't find a combo that I really liked, but I did try their ponzu, sesame sauce, and satay sauce. I would recommend the ponzu and satay sauce. Don't expect it to taste like shabu though because the broth flavor is a little overpowering.\n\nIt was $27.99/pp AYCE with unlimited soda/lemonade too! What I loved most about the place is that they servers were very attentive and always there when you needed them. It wasn't the annoying kind of attention too. They serve complimentary dessert (which you can also have unlimited of) also. I heard they usually have other flavors, but what they were offering were ice cream and grass jelly dessert. I actually really liked the grass jelly dessert! \n\nI'd come to visit again as long as there's no wait!", "author": "Sydney C."}

That's what I felt as I walked up to the restaurant. Prior to this, I was looking up a good hot pot spot on Yelp for my family to dine at; we haven't had hot pot in a while. So, it was kind of a mission to pick from all the various hot spot restaurants in SF, eventually we chose Fiery from all the positive reviews. And it was a damn good choice we picked Fiery.\n\nFirst, they had a Yelp waitlist, this made the wait much more bearable as we didn't have to go there to get on the waitlist. I liked the decor and the 5 TVs they had in good viewing angles.\n\nOnto the food, for an AYCE $28 meal, this place is worth it, it includes a drink, AYCE-whatever-food-pleases-your-belly, and a dessert! Our family ordered just about every cut of meat they had and they were all super tender when cooked in the hot pot. They also had a cut of meat that wasn't on the menu, American Wagyu, this was so good. On top of that, we didn't get any meat that was frozen, plus+! Great selection from the self-serve bar and for dessert, we could choose between grassjelly or black sesame ice cream, we all opted for the ice cream. It was good.", "author": "Sherman S."}

Which I don't recommend. I thought the numbing would be from the peppers being super spicy but it's actually an herb that numbs your tongue and throat. So with your tongue and throat numb it's just an awkward feeling while eating. \n\nDessert: don't get the grass jelly.

The restaurant had a few other open tables at this time.  A waiter came by, politely walked us through the menu options, sides, and soft drinks (which are inlcuded in the buffet).  It was particularly cold this evening, so we got two cups of hot water that came out quickly.  After looking at the menu, we decided on the lamb shoulder, ribeye and porkbelly with rich pork broth.  \n\nWhat's particularly fun about this hot pot restaurant are the sides and sauces that are neatly displayed at a counter for pickup.  You just grab a tray and select the perfectly portioned sides that you want.  I picked up the lotus root, napa cabbage, shrimp balls, fried tofu fish cake, enoki mushrooms and some seaweed salad.  All were clean, fresh, crisp and ready to cook.  \n\nOnce we picked our sides and sauces (which you can easily make to fit your tastes) we headed back to the table where our meats were waiting.  I like a lot of garlic, cilantro and a small bit of hot sauce with soy and making this was a quick and fun process.  The hot pot is on an induction range and comes to cooking temperature very quickly.  We quickly placed our sides in the hotpot, let cook, removed and then added our meats.  Everything was very tasty and the sides cooked nicely.  Over the course of an hour, we were offered additional broth by their friendly and attentive staff through several rounds of cooking meats and sides.  \n\nOne thing to note is that they told us of their time limit prior to us ordering a second round of meats, which by my estimate, was a little over 1 hour.  Would definitely come back here again and highly recommend to those who are hungry for a great hot pot experience.", "author": "Henna P."}

Once they refilled our broths with what I think was hot water, the broth tasted watery and flavorless. A big part of a hot pot experience is the broth and this was saddening. To make things worse, the server looked at us weirdly when we asked for bowls and soup spoons. Is that seriously something weird to ask when you are having soup?

Hands down one of the best hot pot restaurants in SF.  Excellent, attentive service.  Clean sidebar that is continuously restocked with fresh vegetables and fixings for your pot.  Way more efficient than waiting for understaffed servers to remember what you asked for 10 min ago.  The servings of meat are generous per order.  Icing on the cake is that AYCE fee includes bottomless drinks and one scoop of ice cream with your check.  Extra props for clean bathroom!\n\nBe advised.  When they say that the spicy broth is numbingly spicy, they are not f*cking around!", "author": "Carter Y."}

This place takes reservations, so it's best to call ahead.   They need everyone in your party to be present when you arrive before they can give you a table.  The staff were are super nice and polite throughout our whole experience. \n\nTheir menu is small because most of their items are at the counter.  You do need to pick your meat items and soup base from the menu.  You can have a split soup base and there isn't an extra cost for that.  A major plus!  They have 5 choices for the soup base- Rich roast beef, Rich Pork, Rice-less porridge, Vegetarian Miso, and fiery spicy beef.   I ended up getting the Rich pork and my friend got the Fiery Spicy beef.  They will ask you how spicy you want it and they will do their best to make it for you. My friend chose the super extreme spice level.  The waiter tried to warn us, but we insist.   I tried my friends Fiery spicy beef and it was flavorful, but a little too spicy for me.  The Rich pork was good and went well with the items i put in . \n\nTheir meat selection consist of Rib eye, supreme beef, chicken, lamb, pork belly, pork shoulder, filet, housemade dumplings and pigs blood.   My friend and i stuck to the rib eye, supreme beef, and pigs blood. I liked the rib eye more, because to me that one was more tender, but my friend was the opposite of me and liked the Supreme beef more.  So you be the judge. \n\nAnd now for the items the counter.  They had taro, pumpkin, veggies, fried tofu, spam and so much more.  I love the taro and the fried tofu.   They also have woodear and lobster balls and fish balls with roe. I love the fish balls!  Their quail eggs were a good portion and they had different types of noodles too.  You can create you own sauces at the sauce bar.   \n\nI guess the best advantage about this place is that you don't always have to flag down a waiter to order things.  You can just get up and grab it yourself.   Your order includes unlimted soft drinks.   They have root beer, lemonade, coke, sprite, fanta and diet coke for you to chose from.    In addition you can order their soju or sake choices.   The staff here was super nice, but i think they should have a place to write down your name and your party, because i was asked by 3 different staff, at 3 different times how many people were in my party and if they were here.   They should find a better way to keep track of that information.  They have so many TVs here, so it's a great place for those who want to catch up to their Warriors or Giants game", "author": "Belinda C."}

Overall, I had a good experience here. This restaurant is still relatively new and I just loved how clean it felt.\n\nI tried the fiery spicy beef and the rich pork broth. The broths were good although I chose medium for the fiery spicy beef. Not sure what sort of peppers they use but it's the kind of spicy that leaves your tongue tingly. Wasn't able to handle too much of that before I stuck to only using the rich pork broth. \n\nThey have a large assortment on veggies and other food neatly placed on a counter for grabs. I like the concept, quick and easy. For the meats such as lamb and beef, they were nicely presented in a rose. Service was also good. The workers were very attentive and nice.

This new restaurant on the block is the big news around town and if you don't hurry and try this place, you will regret it!\n\nDID YOU KNOW: That this restaurant is owned by two couples! wowzers && they do a exceptional job at making their patrons happy!\n\nI first found out about this restaurant as it was noted on Yelp as the \"New Hot Business\" around town! I knew I was trying to find a place to celebrate my roommate's birthday and I also knew that my roommates loved Hot Pot so this was a double score. I called the restaurant about 4 days in advance and spoke to a wonderful woman named Pansy! She answered the phone and once I told her I was celebrating a birthday, I let her know my roommates name and she told me that the restaurant would do something nice for my roommate because of the birthday celebration (whoa, that took a lot of hassle off me). \n\nMy roommates and I arrived to the restaurant and noticed that upon walking in the restaurant was not busy at all considering that it was 7PM. We were greeted right away by server Leo! Once we sat down Leo went over how everything works and the menu. This restaurant is all you can eat hot pot for $28 which is limited to 90 minutes. But who's counting?! This has to be the best thing I have heard in a while!\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n1. You get to choose 2 out of 3 different types of broth. The options are: Vegetarian Miso, Spicy or mild. \n2. Then you get to choose what type of meat you want. They have a wide variety ranging in choices of Lamb, Chicken or beef.\n3. You choose your drink type. They have the option of all you drink for $10 extra charge! Amazing!!\n4. Then you go to the back table layout where there are many many options of veggies, seafood and sauces that you can pick to put into your soup.\nI love that that the restaurant gives you the option to create your own sauces! This was the best part! \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nThe service here was stellar! From the beginning to the end. While we were eating our server Ray and our busser Jaden came by multiple times to check in to see if there was anything we needed. The empty plates and bowls were picked up immediately by Jaden who was quick! \n\nBIRTHDAY CELEBRATION:\nAfter our meal arrived Leo and Pansy came out with a beautiful ice cream cupcakes decorated and catered for my roommate's birthday. Once they brought it to the table all the workers surrounded the table to sing happy birthday to my roommate. It even came a time where the whole restaurant started joining in by singing happy birthday and clapping at the end! It was such a wonderful moment (I caught it all on video, \"I'm such a nerd, I know\"). \n\nMY RATING:\nDefinitely a 5 star in my eyes! If I could give this place more stars I probably would! They totally beat my expectations from the beginning to the end. They have amazing customer service as well as provided exceptional and quick service once we were at the restaurant. \n\nI would definitely recommend coming to this restaurant and I have to admit that this wouldn't be my last time. Birthday events, hot dates?? Yup! This is the right location and place for that!\n\nThank you Pansy, Jaden and Ray for the amazing experience here! My roommates and I truly enjoyed ourselves and will be back very soon!\n\nREVIEW 144/196", "author": "Porsche C."}

We loved G Cube and couldn't imagine loving another hot pot joint on Taraval again. Well, that was until Fiery Hot Pot Buffet opened in their place! Since the closing of G Cube (RIP), Fiery Hot Pot has turned into one of our faves!\n\nPros\n+ Their roast beef broth is the best! Seriously, it only gets better as you dip beef in it.\n+ Service is always top notch. \n+ With the buffet bar, you don't have to wait for them to bring you items like noodles, veggies or more sauce.\n+ They give you free soda with AYCE.\n+ Homemade dumplings are bomb.com.\n\nCons\n- The last time we went, the roast beef broth was a little oily.\n- The rib eye is served in the shape of a heart. While that is unique presentation, it's extremely difficult to take it apart. We always end up just throwing the entire lump of meat into the broth. \n- The staff is attentive, but can be a bit unorganized at times. \n\nNow that they've been opened for a while, be prepared for a bit of a wait.", "author": "Tiffany U."}

It was $28.99 per person and includes unlimited sodas and desserts at the end. I love how they have a cute buffet section where you get to choose the ingredients to put in your hot pot. I think they can have a wider selection if they are trying to charge you almost $30. Like they could have crab legs with the shells, crawfish or other items included. Their sauce station was the simple sauces like soy sauce, ponzu, and garlic, etc. I think they can offer more sauce options as well. You order the meat at the table from your server. My boyfriend and I loved the ribeye the best. At the end we tried the watermelon dessert and the green tea ice cream. Would have to say the watermelon dessert was our favorite.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-01", "description": "Had dinner with an old girlfriend I haven't seen in forever. We both love hot pot, so when looking around for places to meet up for dinner, I suggested Fiery Hot Pot Buffet. We stopped by Monday, August 22nd at 6:15pm. Not sure if they take reservations, but we didn't have one. It was pretty slow, so it was easy to grab a table. No wait at all.\n\nI love All You Can Eat, even if I don't really take advantage of it. The AYCE here includes bottomless soda. $27.99 for adults, $13.99 for children under 10 years, and Free for kids under 3 years. If you want to add All You Can Drink, it's an extra $7 for draft beer and hot or cold sake. We of course opted for the AYCD option as well. We did many, many hot sakes and a pitcher of Asahi. They also give you edamame when you sit down.\n\nThe difference with Fiery Hot Pot Buffet is they have a sauce, veggie, sides, seafood, etc, bar. So all you really need to order are the meats. This is great as sometimes AYCE places can lag while waiting for the servers to bring out the food. For our broth, we did a split pot with Rich Pork and Fiery Spice Beef. Other broths they offer are: Rich Roast Beef, Rice-less Porridge, Vegetarian Miso.\n\n*Sauce bar: Ponzu, Hoisin, Chili, Beancurd, Barbecue, Sesame, Chili pepper, Garlic, Green onion, Cilantro, Soy\n*Seafood/Sides: Seaweed salad, Tomato, Imitation crab stick, Quail eggs, Spam, Spicy sausages, Shrimp, Mussels, Fish ball with roe, Beef tendon, Cooked clam, Beef tripe, Pork sausages, Combination meat & fish balls\n*Vegetables: Spinach, Tong ho, Enoki, Baby bok choy, Romaine lettuce, Watercress\n*Noodles/Sides: Daikon radish, Fried tofu, Yam noodle, Wintermelon, Corn, Taro, Tofu, Broccoli, Pumpkin, Rice cake, Woodear, Vermicelli, Udon, Napa cabbage, Mung bean noodle\n\nYou can also get a raw egg or sides of rice if you ask for it. I love adding a raw egg yolk to my sauce, so of course I asked for an egg. I just keep my sauce simple: ponzu, soy, garlic, chili, green onions, and cilantro. Perfect for dipping.\n\nWe actually stayed light on sides. Grabbed mussels, fish ball with roe, tripe, spinach, enoki, corn, yam noodles, and maybe a couple other things I can't remember. The size of the dishes is actually perfect for sharing between two people as it's not too much. I loved putting everything in the spicy broth. I especially enjoyed the tripe and the fish balls filled with roe. My fav veggies were the spinach and enoki mushrooms.\n\nFor the meats, we started with one plate each of the Ribeye and Supreme beef. The Ribeye ended up being the best, so we stuck with that one and ordered another plate. The supreme beef was a little stringy and tough. The ribeye was more tender. The other dishes you can order are: Tender chicken breast, Premium lamb shoulder, Pork belly, Premium pork shoulder, Fillet-of-sole, Housemade dumpling.\n\nService was excellent! My gf and I were catching up, A LOT. So he was very sweet as we asked for refill after refill of sake. We actually didn't really eat much since we drank so much. At least we took advantage of the AYCD?\n\nSo glad I found this place. I do look forward to coming back and actually eating. Gotta take advantage of that AYCE as well!", "author": "Elena N."}

But Fiery is definitely one of my favorite hotpot restaurants and I've told many people about it! The selection of meat is standard with a few additions such as dumplings! You make your own sauce at their sauce bar and grab your veggies, noodles and other proteins in that area. They have a great assortment of types of mushrooms, noodles, and greens. This is really what sets it apart from others I've been to. \n\nThe service is pretty friendly and attentive. Your meal also comes with all the soda you can drink.

The food presentation was definitely on POINT. The waiter was kind and they tended to us whenever we needed. (Although, again, I must mention that it wasn't as busy and we came right when they opened)\n\nSoup Bases: Regular beef - star of the show and Spicy Fiery Beef in medium (way too spicy for us...shoot for the mild if you're not a spicy person)\n\nMeat + Side dishes: We got supreme beef, rib eye beef, lamb shoulder, and pigs blood (yummy for chinese people). I personally don't like lamb as much, but the prime beef + rib eye beef were delicious. There were also plentiful of side dishes at the bar such as shrimp, wood ear, muscles, enoki, udon, ramen -- the list is endless. Check out the pics if you really want an idea of the whole list! The sauce bar was amazing as well, but of course I stuck to the usual, ponzo + garlic. But there are a lot of other choices like peanut sauce, hot sauce, etc. \n\nDrinks: We also received unlim drinks, soda + tea. :O\n\nDessert: We had a choice of grass jelly+ fruits or strawberry icecream at the end as well!

And it's because of places like Fiery Hot Pot Buffet. \n\nAll you can eat and drink\nExcellent customer service\nEnglish speaking\nQuality ingredients\n\nNot many places offer all you can drink. Combine that with the excellent customer service from Pansy, not sure if she's the owner and or manager, but she kept the refills coming. I wonder if it's because if patrons are full on drink - they eat less.\n\nNot in my case though. And the quality meats (see pics) as well as fish - came out when we were ready - the rest of the ingredients, was self serve. See pics again. The ingredients were fresh and they were kept stocked so no one was left waiting, wanting. I have to shamelessly admit, our table ate every meat and fish offered on the menu. \n\nDifferent broths available - you can even split the pot in half. We opted for Miso on one side and medium spicy on the other. The broths were full of flavor, even after several refills of hot water. The mixes complimented one another and I would definitely order the same combination again. \n\nThe interior was modern and clean. As for parking, if you're familiar with the area, then you know what to expect. If you don't, all I will say is good luck. \n\nI really had an awesome experience here.

The taste is still good. I do like there were more people working to service us on the meats. I also like the idea of the self-servicing station where its all you can eat and get as much as you need or can eat. That just means the servers are paying more attention to customers who want more meat and drinks. \n\nNot sure why they rebranded as it has always had a lot of customers everytime I eat here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-24", "description": "I have my own favorite hotpot place in San Gabriel Valley, but this place, makes my place in SGV \"mediocre\" in comparison. The first thing when you think buffet/AYCE is quality will suffer (because hey, it's obviously a large volume type of place) and the lack of customer service is expected (they employees normally are just going through the motions, again, due to the high number of patrons coming in and out). This place not only provides quality ingredients for a buffet, but the customer service is quite spectacular. Amazing how they can do it considering it was only Pansy (we believe the manager/owner?) and one other gentleman serving the place.\n\nBeef/pork/fish/lamb is \"controlled\" by the house as you order accordingly what you like and they bring it to your table. It's not a problem because more than likely Pansy (who took care of us all night on our visit) made sure when we did run out (visually) of meat, she was there to ask right away, \"You guys ready for more meat?\". Same goes with our bottomless sodas, she would provide us with a new cup once the current one we were drinking was already half way. \n\nOnce you're seated, you order your broth(s), they can do a whole pot or a split pot. We chose the Miso (good for vegetables) and spicy beef broth (we did it medium which had a nicely slight kick to it). Then you choose your protein(s). We ended up ordering all of the proteins on the menu that was available.\n\nRib-eye: it was nicely marbled, thinly sliced and didn't taste like it was frozen, nicely presented (reminded me of KBBQ) this was my favorite overall\nPork (Belly?): felt like bacon (sans being cured/smoked/salted) wasn't bad at all\nSupreme Beef: tasted like regular beef (don't know if it was supposed to be seasoned?), but rib-eye to me was a better choice (rolled to look like a rose)\nLamb: wasn't as gamy to what lamb normally is, so it was decent (rolled to look like a rose)\nChicken: sliced thinly, was OK, but I prefer the others (rolled to look like a rose)\nSole: looked like sashimi, nice texture. Doesn't crumble like other places I've had fish in hotpot before. My second favorite \"meat\"\nBlood cakes: subject to availability, was good, we basically used the ladle with the strainer to lightly blanch them. Doesn't really have its own flavor, so it soaks up whatever flavor you dip/heat it in\n\nAfter you order your proteins, you can go to the ingredients bar that broken up into three \"sections\" (all in one area, but broken up).\n\nI grabbed quail eggs, tripe, tendon, fish ball with the roe inside, fried tofu, woodear mushrooms, corn, lotus roots, large enokis. There are plenty of items to choose from, though lacking bamboo shoots and baby corn. The ingredients they have, were more than enough for me and my party. The other thing I noticed, they're all on top of cooling type bars (refer to my picture). \n\nLastly, go to the condiments bar to mix/match your own type of sauces, green onions, soy sauce etc.\n\nI really enjoyed my meal here, coupled with the quality ingredients and the amazing customer service. I can't wait to go back with more people. I just hope nothing changes from my visit to when I do visit again.\n\nDinner is $25ish tax/person, but that includes all you can eat hotpot, all you can drink soda (you can do all you can drink alcohol +$7/person, but the entire table has to do all you can drink), and dessert. Please take my money!!!\n\nThe only thing that was new to me (being from L.A.) when the trolley would go up and down Polk, the floor would shake a bit, but again, nothing that will keep me away from this place). Parking is also tricky, but worth looking for to eat at this place. My spot in SGV is lucky this place is in Northern California, otherwise this would be it.\n\nAfter a disappointing dinner at another place we had high hopes for, my finacee was glad to \"make up for it\" by finding this place.

Closer to 7-8 that's when the crowds rolled in. Service was great. They were able to answer the questions thrown at them. They checked in from time to time and they speak Canto for the curious ones. I heard they were setting up a karaoke room in the back sooo...\n\nYou're allowed to do half-half for the pot. The broth I got was rich pork and it was pretty good. I liked the porky taste. My table had the supreme beef and ribeye. The ribeye was soooo good. The meat was soft and broke apart nicely after cooking. The supreme beef was good too. If you plan on cooking the whole thing, just toss it in; it will break apart itself in the cooking process. Otherwise, unwrap it. I forgot about it and left it in the pot a little too long, it didn't turn very chewy so that's good. You know it's good meat; fresh and tasty. I also liked their dumplings, which are made in house. \n\nIf you want some seafood, go to the back where there's a small bar of fish balls, clams, mussels, spam, quail eggs, shrimp, etc. There are also veggies like broccoli, napa cabbage and tofu. They also have a variety of sauces in the back like ponzu, bbq, hoisin, sesame, etc. Everything is really fresh. Didn't see any bad foods or any left out for a long time.\n\nOverall I think this place is pretty neat and worth a try.

BUT only a half hour after I called, there was a pretty significant wait (probably about 20-3min) for two people. \n\nI definitely liked that there was a self-serve area for non-sliced meats, veggies, sauce, and other items. Also, soft drinks are included in the price as well! There's an option for AYCD as well, but I'll save that for another time. The items in this area were changed pretty frequently as I went to grab veggies and other items frequently and always saw someone adding and removing items.\n\nWhen we ordered meat, it came out pretty quickly and it was presented in such a pretty way! I was literally given a bowl with roses made of sliced meat. The staff were very kind and attentive, but it was so busy that night that they didn't check on us too frequently (also, we had large parties to both sides of us). Parking can be a pain, but we found that there was ample parking near the Taraval Police Station and the park the block up; it's definitely a small walk, but it's worth it when you're that full.\n\n\nFood: 8/10\nStaff: 8/10\nAtmosphere: 8/10\nValue: 8/10\nOverall: 8/10", "author": "Evan K."}

But if you go down towards Ulloa it should be fine lol. No wait! We got seated after 5 min of them prepping a table. \n\nThe place is not too big itself. What I love about Fiery Hot Pot are the meats. They are so fresh and tender. The supreme beef was my fave. I like how you can pick your own veggies, noodles, etc. without having to wait to get them. I personally think the items were fresh, and they were often interchanged so I dont believe they were sitting out for too long. I wish there were more items/variety but it's a pretty good/basic selection for hot pot.  Sauce bar was good. Sesame sauce tasted a little like peanut butter, so wasn't too much of a fan of that. But ponzu was great! \n\nWe got the miso and the spicy pork broth. I'm sensitive to spice & the spicy pork broth wasn't too bad. You can also customize how spicy you want the base to be. \n\nCustomer service was also great! Very attentive and offered suggestions. Always took away finished plates immediately & fast on refills.", "author": "Kathleen A."}

I wanted to see how this place measured up to the others and whether it's worth it to go. The set up is similar to Sea Pot (albeit the conveyor belt) where the veggies, fish balls, etc are laid out. You will need to order the meat via the server though. I appreciate that they're in tiny containers/plates so that you can portion yourself and try as many things as you'd like. Standard fare of various hotpot things. \n\nThere's a sauce bar where you can make your own sauce. The hot pot utilizes induction heat. The place is decently sized. Our group had went on a weekday and there wasn't a wait. However, your party will not be seated unless your entire party is present. \n\nThe best part is the broth. We ordered the spicy rich pork and the rich beef broth. The broth is exactly like its name.. it's rich! (Not the layers and layers of oil but dense in flavor.) For dessert, we were served watermelon sago in a shot glass!\n\nThe service could be a bit more attentive (we asked twice for water..and more than once for other things).

Made a reservation for 8 people and were accommodated immediately upon arrival. We chose the spicy and pork bone broth for both pots. I couldn't stop eating the rib eye and supreme beef. The meat remained so tender after the cook that I immediately knew it was quality beef. Lamb and pork belly was also a running up great selection. I liked the presentation of the self served mini plates of vegetables, clams, mussels, fish & beef balls, etc. The self served sauce station had all the staple hotpot sauces like soy sauce, chili oil, cilantro, garlic, etc... \n\nSomething that was a plus, was it was unlimited soda with the All you can eat deal. That is something that probably makes them stand out from most hotpot places who charge individually. The server was also great in providing excellent service. Ended with the complimentary dessert of lychee ice cream and red bean ice cream. Andes mint chocolates were also provided when paying. \n\nOverall, grade A meat quality and service.

So I strongly suggest calling in and asking beforehand! & to be safe, come in before 7pm!! (Aka crazy dinner rush time). \n\nTHE SERVICE:\nThe staffs were extremely kind and constantly stopping by to check on our table! That doesn't happen too often at pot hot style restaurants. And even when there were a few people waiting to be seated, the environment was very calm, spacious, and I never felt rushed! WIN!\n\nTHE FOOD:\nAll of the raw pork and beef needs to be ordered by the server and they bring it out to you. Then theres a bar buffet section that offers a wide variety of dishes such as tofu, mushroom, noodles, veggies (eat your veggies!!) and ect. Every thing looked and tasted fresh!\n\nORDER THE HOUSE MADE DUMPLINGS!! underrated on the menu but soooooo tasty!!\n\nI would def be back one day!

Bonus points for being in my neighborhood. I used to be a frequent patron of Hot Pot Garden before it burned down, but it was always so busy and the wait so long to get a table. Secretly crossing my fingers that Fiery Hotpot remains a hush-hush neighborhood secret gem so wait times can remain fast! I came at opening time on a weekend and there was no wait until later in the evening when groups started coming in.\n\nThe price is very reasonable for AYCE hotpot AND it includes free soda + refills and a complimentary dessert at the end, assuming you have the stomach space left. Their sauce station and small seafood/veggie buffet station is my favorite part. You can grab small bowls of a wide variety of hot pot staples like shrimp, fish balls, clams, mussels, etc., and vegetarian options such as tong hao, spinach, mushrooms and more. Also I LOVE that their sauce station includes sesame sauce and satay sauce. They have even ponzu and fermented tofu sauce, and very fresh herbs for your dip. You can choose to create your own sauce to be more Chinese style, Japanese style, SE Asian style, etc..\n\nTheir meat is also exceptionally fresh. I am typically a ribeye fan but their supreme beef is very good also. Service is great and they are always refilling your pot and drinks when running low.", "author": "Melody S."}

First of all, this place is Way overpriced and horrible service. Meat /food quality is only average. For $35/person including tip and tax, we could have chosen another better hot place in the city. Services was extremely terrible and horrible, this waitress- the guy really acts like he's the owner wanting to make sure customer are eating too much so he could make more business . But I don't think he's the owner bc he was also wearing uniform like others. If could leave zero star, i could have given zero star.

Came out to be smaller portion. When we were done we asked to order for 2nd time ,then same guy, this guy asked if we want to order half order they can do that? What? Did I hear him right? Half order for the 2 time we ordered meat? Isn't it a AYCE place? Why we were so afraid of ordering and being rejected each time? Me and hubby cAme with our baby and we were barely eating at all. We were very stressful eating there the WHOLe Time, afraid of being criticized for ordering more food. We left the place with empty stomach. The 2 female waitress are nicer at least will come collect dirty dishes when w asked .when asked to refill soda, this same guy pretend didn't see us. What a experience!

Some tips to improve is just to have a sign up sheet in the front so the hostess isn't running back and forth and then forgetting to help current customers who have sat down. Just have one or two people focused on actual customer service (pouring soup/drinks/putting in new items) and have 1-2 servers be the actual food runners.

Apparently a lady who worked there had it but she was in the back of the restaurant occupied and it was 10 mins until my boyfriend went to remind them about our table. She said they just had to set it before we got seated.\n- Although our table was clean when we got there (we had a table for 9 so we knew it was ours), it took 20 MINS for them to actually set it with plates and chopsticks and seat us. \n- It took us almost 30 MINS AFTER THAT just to get our broth aka we got our broth about an hour after we got to the restaurant when we had a reservation. \n- Our waiter messed up on our drinks. We ordered mostly sodas...got mostly waters and had to remind him about the sodas. \n- The meat selection is okay but the meat comes out in such small bowls that you have to keep reordering and of course the meat takes a while to come so there's lots of waiting. \n- What's different is that they have a sauce bar and a bar with all the non-meat sides (veggies, noodles, seafood). There are many different sauces to choose from and you can pick up the veggies, seafood, and noodles whenever you want.\n- You can have two different soups for no charge.\n- They offer dessert which is nice but they'll say they have strawberry ice cream and grass jelly and we thought they had grass jelly ice cream but it's really just grass jelly fyi haha. \n\nI think they were just really understaffed and just need to get their act together.

As for the meat, it's fresh and tender. As for the food that was laid out, I question how long it was out there. The restaurant definitely looks clean  and service is 6 stars. They were on point. Seriously. Oh, bonus point- soda is free! They would give you a new cup of soda before you even finish yours. Once they see an empty plate, they will clear it off fast and if you are low on meat they will ask if you want to order more. This hot pot place is average. Nothing too special about it. I would come again, if they made some changes to the soup.", "author": "Darlene T."}

I've been to so many hotpot places and even hotpot places in Hong Kong.... Fiery Hotpot is seriously doing something right. From the amazing spicy mala beef broth to the amazingly clean display of side dishes, it's so delicious here.\n\nFiery is located where G-Cube was originally but don't be fooled because the place actually can set 40-50 people. The space is really open and is so clean and well decorated. You are greeted with edamame immediately and head to the sauce and sides station!!!\n\nThe sides are prepped and displayed really nice and clean so it makes it really appetizing to grab. Unlike some hotpot places where you know in he back of your mind it's probably been prepped in a really gross Chinese kitchen. GUYS I CANT RAVE ENOUGH ABOUT THIS PLACE.\n\nP.S.

Let's face it, this place is desperate to have high ratings without a dissenting opinion that their service lacks common sense and their side bar of veggies are old and dry. \nThey refused to seat us even though there was 1 other customer there; the place was dead... We were missing 1 from a big group of 6, I think u can bend if there's NO one there.  \nThough my list of complaints proceeds with how the manager or owner explained SLOWLY how Hotpot works there when it ate sufficiently into our 1.5 hour and we know how AYCE Hotpot works, it's nothing new. So we were left with 15 minutes less, not including the time to bring out the soups, subtract another 10-15minutes, thus, an hour or less. \n\nPlease stop removing my review as it pertains to the lacking experience and rudeness my whole group had there. Bad move when we are big ol' foodies that eat out a lot... Why would you be rude and inconsiderate to customers in an empty place by making us stand by the  freezing door when, , should had just seated us and get our water  and order started at Least, unless that's your business tactic to lessen eating time.", "author": "Miss J."}

I came here at around 7pm on a Friday night and the place wasn't full; but that shouldn't deter you from entering though! \n\nOur server was very attentive to our table and was willing to explain how to cook everything and recommended a lot of items to us. The service was just on point!! I think some servers don't really understand English though since my BF tried ordering another plate of meat and the server ended up calling another server to our table. If you speak canto or mandarin, the servers would be able to assist you also.\n\nThe soup bases I got was veg miso and the fiery beef. The server said the veg miso would bring out more of the flavor which I agree. The fiery beef base kind of over killed the original flavors of the food items. But if you like that extra kick, the soup base is for you. Anyway, I tried almost everything at the bar and all of the meat. I really liked the supreme beef and the rib eye the best out of all the meat selection & my fav sides were the clams, the ball w/ fish roe, and the mussels. \n\nThe sauce bar is a really great idea IMO. Unlike little sheep, Fiery allows you to make your own sauce and it is to your liking of what and how much of the sauce you want to make (y'all should try the garlic+BBQ sauce+cilantro+green onion+chili sauce combo).

Hiring people whom are raw, unable to even do the simplistic request like a clean plate or another pair of chop sticks. The 1st time coming they didn't even know the soda selection was down to Pepsi or Sprite only, only after walking back and forth of what wasn't available. When we got tea instead of soda, they never refilled.\n\nDo not bring anyone who has food allergy here, they will kill them. The meats need to be requested like most other places. The vegetables and other cheaper stuff is pretty much self service. The sauces are self service and can see that a lot of the sauces has other things in them due to being so close together and how other customers are.\n\nThe tables are pretty tight together. We didn't have much room for the uncooked and cooked food on the table at the same time. There isn't enough room to put a purse of even a jacket when everyone is there. And sitting next to the door, there is often so many customers waiting that pretty much stand over your table, unable to even move unless they get out of your way. \n\nThere is no WiFi available and reception is pretty bad in the back section.

Food is amazing, everyone who works there is super nice.  And the broths are soooooo good, that's like, the most important thing in a good hot pot right?

I'd rather go to iPot instead on Irving as their broths are tastier and they have more variety in meat choices. Our soup bases were rich pork broth and the spicy beef one. They were okay, nothing to really write joke about. I do really like how the vegetables and other stuff besides the raw meats are self service because there's no need to flag down wait staff or forgotten orders. The quality in the meats weren't terrible, but definitely nothing to write home about. The pork belly we ordered tasted really funky though. I almost waned to spit it out. Couldn't really figure out if it smelled weird, tasted weird, or both. Their sesame sauce tastes very oily and overpowers whatever you dip in it, instead of complimenting it. For dessert we were offered red bean ice cream or grass jelly, and we opted for the red bean ice cream.

It has always been a great experience, but the last 2 times we visited which happened just after the beginning of 2018, it was definitely not pleasing. \n\nLeo was one of the best waiter at this restaurant as he greeted customers very well, managed the restaurant in great efficiency and treated the restaurant like his own business; however, we were shocked to learn that he is no longer working here at our 1st visit in 2018, and both visits we had received definitely below average service from the waitresses.  We were not being greeted when we stepped into the restaurant; there was just an iPad at the entrance letting people to check in, and no one comes to the front to check regularly, and the waitresses pretty much ignore the how crowded it was at the entrance until they were finally able to manage their time to come forward.\n\nMy last visit was just 3 nights ago, and the wait time was seriously ridiculous. I called the restaurant for reservation, and they told me to sign in via yelp, which we did, and it says about 30-45mins wait. That's fine as we were just almost on the way to get there. Around 30mins later, we arrived the restaurant and noticed the wait position hasn't changed (we were the 5th one) but we started seeing people leaving, so good sign. However, there were a total of 5 waitresses who only focus on cleaning, taking empty container and taking existing customers' orders. They didn't seat anyone party in until there were 3~4 tables emptied for at least 10mins. We became the next party to be seated after 20ish mins and saw another table just left, so we thought we are gonna be seated soon, but what happened? We actually waited another 30-40mins at the entrance until being seated as they just cleaned the table and did something else without coming to the front to check people in. By the time we got seated, there were a total of 4 tables emptied, and at least 3 parties left at the entrance due to the long wait and inefficiency. And when we got called, the waitresses did not even say a word on the long wait time but just started taking our orders.  Seriously, we did not really feel welcoming anymore in this restaurant which such greatly deteriorated service.\n\nThey introduced wagyu at our 1st 2018 visit, and they cut it so thin to a point my wife didn't even notice she ate it when she had the 1st piece.  The 2nd time was better cut, and the rest of the food pretty much still remain the same standard.\n\nOverall, I think it's such a shame to see this restaurant which has great food and portion to start going downwards due to its deterioration in service. We missed the time when Leo was still there as we enjoyed so much on both service and food. We will most likely get there again maybe next month, and i guess it will be our last visit if the service and efficient have not been improved.  \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving 1-star is because the food still taste ok.", "author": "Henry M."}

If you don't like szechuan peppers, you won't like the soup since it has the numbing effect that comes with the peppers. The pork was pretty delicious as well, not spicy. \n\nYou order the meats at the table through the servers. The servers don't all speak english well... you can tell when they look at your blankly when you ask for something simple like water. But there are two servers that come by often and are super attentive. \n\nI enjoyed being able to control the portions of items.

The only con I have about this place is how they made my party of 3 wait for a table after 8pm when they close at 10 and do last call at 9:30. We had another person coming, but they should've seated us when it wasn't even busy. \n\nAnyways, I love the decor of this place. It's very modern and sleek in my opinion. There's plenty of tvs around the restaurant, so it's perfect for the upcoming warrior games! \n\nAyce $28, includes soft drinks! $8 more for aycd, which includes draft beer and cold or hot sake. One more con, all parties have to do aycd in the table if one person does it. $8 is such a great price but one of our friends didn't drink alcohol at all! I kind of wish they would have made an exception, especially if the person does not even drink! Oh well, rules are rules. \n\nIn the back, you get to choose your assortment of veggies and you can also make your own sauces. I like how they have fish ball with roe, lobster balls, imitation crab sticks, cooked clams, mussels, shrimp, various mushrooms, ramen, udon, and napa that's already cut. Some of the balls were still frozen, but the veggies were good quality. The sauces vary from soy sauce, hoisin, chili sauce, BBQ sauce, ponzu, garlic, green onions, jalepenoes, and cilantro. I put together BBQ sauce (almost like satay consistency), soy sauce, chili sauce, green onions, and jalepenoes- it turned out a little sour. But I was too lazy to make another one and fail, so I stuck to it lol. The meats include ribeye, supreme beef, chicken breast, lamb/pork shoulder, pork belly, and pigs blood!! The meats were good quality too and I love how they have pig blood! Yum. \n\nThe service is actually really good and attentive. It was not busy anymore and the two guy servers did a good job on serving us. They were professional, yet friendly and personable. Never rude and seemed happy to help us.

I ordered the Vegetarian Spicy Miso and request it to be extra spicy and my boyfriend ordered the Spicy Pork broth. The broth was so flavorful! One of our favorite part is the self serve side dish area. Adults are charged $28.99 but the price includes soft drinks with free refills and dessert. I believe children 3 years old and under eat for free and child under the age of 10 year olds are charged $13.99. You don't have to flag your server down for refills, more meat, or for any other request because they pay close attention to their customers. This restaurant is very clean. Shabuway on Geary Blvd used to be our go to place, but now Fiery is our first option and Shabuway will be our second option. Also take into consideration that although they close at 11:00 pm, they do stop seating customer by 10:00 pm. They do this for your own good. This doesn't benefit them. If you're paying close to $30 for a all you can eat dinner, you most likely want to be able to dine in without feeling rush.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

SO glad I made the reservation because there seems to be a long wait!! This is a pretty simple hot pot buffet, you order your soup base and meats with the server and the buffet line offers everything else from the soy sauce and toppings to vegetables and carbs. I like that everything was in small individual bowls so you aren't grabbing from a big pile which can be messy when it gets busy. Also it helps with portion control, so people aren't getting more than they can eat! Service was great, the meat was good however I couldn't really tell the difference between their supreme and rib eye... and they weren't consistent because our first order was very lean and the second order of the same beef was really fatty. Regardless, everything was tasty and fresh and I will be coming back!!", "author": "Athena L."}

They carry most items other AYCE hot pot places have. \n\nCustomer Service: AMAZING! This is where Fiery Hot Pot really shines out. The service is the BEST i've had in any other AYCE location I've ever been to. Everyone is smiling, polite, and extremely attentive. I not once had to wave anyone down for a drink refill, soup refill, or to put in my order. Dirty empty dishes are taken away right away and the entire staff seems happy to be working there. Being served by a happy and polite staff really just puts the icing on the cake for me when it comes to dining out. \n\nFunny story - my boyfriend and I were bickering about something at the table, and the server came by to check on us and ask how everything was going.

They offer 6 types of meat; supreme beef, ribeye, pork shoulder, pork belly, lamb shoulder and chicken breast. Their fish is a muuuuust! Not only was it fresh but they add a little bit of ginger on top for that extra kick! Amazing! Besides the meat and fish, everything else was self served.

We got seated right away and helped ourselves to creating our own sauces for dipping. The sauce station had a variety of sauces and toppings for your dipping pleasures. I had a mix of soy sauce, ponzu, seas and, cilantro, scallions, lots of garlic, and chili sauce. If you want a raw egg to mix with your sauce you need to request from one of the waiters. We got to choose two soup based since they do halves without additional cost. My friend and I opted in for spicy fiery beef and rich pork broth. Since my other friends eat lamb we had our own pot next to them to keep that lamb taste from our soup aha. I requested for really mild fiery spicy beef broth but it was actually pretty spicy so I didn't use that side as much as the rich pork broth, which you can never go wrong with when you go to hot pot/shabu spots. All the meats and seafood would need to be to be requested from the waiters, but they have a veggie station where you help yourself go veggies, noodles, etc. The large clear noodles were a hit with my friends and the fish filet. I stuck to my usual ribeye and premium beef, which were a cut a little thicker than I like but they tasted good. Your all-you-can-eat meal comes with complimentary soda so I ordered the Minute Maid lemonade since I'm not a huge fan of the other soda options; unlimited refills! After our meal we had the option for complimentary desserts: lychee ice cream or grass jelly with canned fruits. We liked the lychee ice cream because it reminded us of the jelly cups markets use to sell. The grass jelly was a bit bland and the fruits weren't sweet. Overall paid $48 per person since we paid for birthday girl too. Not a bad spot, but good timing since Hot Pot Garden is still renovating.", "author": "Amanda C."}

I made reservation for Sunday and when I got to the restaurant they told me they accidentally put the reservation down for Saturday, but they were very nice to quickly give us a table anyways. They sat us in the room at the back and I was a bit wary thinking we will have a hard time getting the server's attention to order, but they were super attentive and kept checking up on us for any orders,. The refrigerated cold bar and sauce bar was very convenient and clean. They always quickly restock the food when it's low. The down part about this place is that I think they use MSG in their soup, which is typical but it got me so thirsty for the rest of the night after dinner. They also lack variety in their soup, meat, and food selection compared to other restaurants alike. Nonetheless, it's still a nice restaurant to eat it on a foggy day in SF !", "author": "Lucy C."}

The selection of ingredients to add to your broth is great, too. But what really sets this place apart is the service. Rarely, if ever, do I leave a restaurant thinking \"man, that waiter was incredible.\" At a hot pot or shabu place, the waiter is important and our guy (the tallest guy) was just fantastic. All the hot pot I can eat plus unlimited sodas and great service for 27.99 is a steal!", "author": "Erik S."}

The team is super responsive and not like other hot pot places where you have to wait ages for someone to notice you and bring you more meat. What makes me give Fiery Hot Pot only two stars is the quality of the broth. We tried both the pork and beef broth. The pork broth tasted metallic not unlike the taste of something from a can. The beef broth was unmemorable. The meat selection is just ok but the sides and condiments are vast and set up in an easy to use way. If we could have waitstaff at any other hot pot restaurant I'd be elated. Another important thing to note is that the floor here is extremely slippery. Like someone is going to fall and break their neck slippery.", "author": "ipvcake i."}

I ordered meat but they apparently forgot about my order and took them quite a while. Their pot for hot pot is quite small and anyone getting food from the pot must be careful to not spill onto the portable stove because it will turn off the stove. They have a section for people to get veggies, mushrooms, noodles, and dressings etc so that's very convenient.", "author": "Angel N."}

Service was excellent and the food delicious.  Thought the quality of the meat was outstanding and the broth very flavorful.  We were surprised and delighted by the ACYD sake as our expectations were low thinking it would be not very high quality due to the price and yet it was fantastic.  We had 4 large carafes :)\n\nThe buffet was well stocked and really clean.  Nice offerings especially the mushroom selection which is my favorite.  We would have liked a few more options on the sauce bar compared to a few other locations in the area.\n\nOverall the service was outstanding.  They were attentive, friendly and they all seemed quite happy to be there.  The food was delicious and high quality.  Don't forget to get the pineapple coconut ice cream for dessert.  The atmosphere was warm and exceptionally clean.  Would absolutely return!", "author": "Katia D."}

I had never had hot pot before, and it turned out to be a wonderful experience.  The staff was so friendly and helpful.  They explained how to pick from the menu, what tastes best with what and how to pick out the side dishes and cooking instructions.  What fun and great food.  I was so full I couldn't even think about having dessert, which comes with the meal.  Looking forward to enjoying Fiery again.   Thank you for the wonderful time!!", "author": "Jacque J."}

I had originally wanted to come to this neighborhood for this Shanghai style dumpling place but I came across this hot pot place after I parked outside . I decided it could be fun to visit this place instead since I was already parked outside . I walked inside and it was really clean, modern, and welcoming. It's only $27 AYCE and that includes soda and the side dishes station. The wait staff was really friendly, attentive, fast, and helpful in describing to me how the menu works. The menu basically is comprised of about 6 different types of meat, soju, beer, and drinks. There's a self-serving buffet station filled with all types of sauces, udon, rice noodles, spam, tofu, yam, fish balls, quail eggs, and some other items I forgot to mention. You can boil the meats and side items in the boiler in your table. And the boiler has 2 different compartments so you can use 2 different soup bases. The mango jelly dessert was scrumptious! You can ask for white rice and I found that they delivered my rice fast and I have about 4 refills this night . Overall I am very pleased with the ambience, service, food, and the impressive selections. I will be back! Bravo to this new hot pot restuarant !", "author": "Stephen C."}

I was greeted at the door and was sat down in few minutes after! Our waiter came explained to us our options and gave us some suggestions. After we reviewed the menu we settled for the spicy broth and split it with the rich pork broth. We also decided on Ribeye, pork belly, fish, and home made dumplings. Every thing was delicious! The veggies were fresh and right portions. I would definitely come back!", "author": "Susana Q."}
