{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-11", "description": "A very close friend took me to here for lunch and the food here was exquisitely delicious! I had the pleasures of trying out their Quesadilla Roja con Chicharr\u00f3n, Gorditas Campechanas, Tamal de Birria de Pollo, Almond Horchata, and Strawberry-Almond Horchata! \n\nThe quesadilla was very unique in its look as it wasn't the usual round sandwich type that you usually get at Mexican places. I was told it was more authentic and something you'd find on the streets of Mexico, so already, the visual of the quesadilla piqued my interest. It was very crunchy, and the pork belly was juicy and seasoned well. I also appreciated how the cilantro did not overpower the dish as I'm not a huge fan of a lot of cilantro.\n\n\nThe gorditas were also very delicious! It was my first time eating gorditas and I expected the chorizo to be drenched in oil, but the oil was not overwhelming and didn't make me feel nauseous (which usually happens with oily foods). I thought it was a very well balanced dish with meat, lettuce and sauce.\n\nThe tamal might have been my favorite dish. I am used to the typical tamale style that are kind of small and skinny in size. But this one was a larger version of it, stuffed with shredded chicken and smothered in a delicious, spicy red sauce. The sauce wasn't really that spicy, but it had that nice punch which isn't too wimpy but also not too spicy at all. It definitely had a subtle spice to it. Usually I don't find tamales to be very filling as a meal. I'd have to eat several of them to feel satiated, but this tamal alone would have been enough for me!\n\nThe Almond Horchata and the Strawberry-Horchata were also very delicious. They tasted like they were made fresh and on the spot. A friend in Mexico had been taunting me for months about how Strawberry Horchatas were a thing there, and now that I was able to have a sip of it myself, I can say that I was not disappointed. You can definitely taste the \"real strawberry\" in it! Even the regular Almond Horchata was very creamy and delicious.\n\nAnother thing I really appreciated about this place was that they did not give you the typical salsa and chips as their complimentary dining-in services. Instead, they give you these roasted, salted, spiced garabanzo beans that were quite addicting!\n\nOverall, I think if you go here, definitely try out the Tamal and the Strawberry Horchata!", "author": "Rachel L."}

We arrived around 6:30 and put our name on the sign in sheet outside. Our table of 2 was seated about 15-20 minutes later.\n\nAfter we were seated, we received menus but no waters. We looked over the menus and a few minutes later, a server arrived. He did not say anything. It was a little awkward.\n\nWe ordered two of the agua frescas (Tepache and Strawberry Lemonade), and the Ensalada de Melones con Chile y Lim\u00f3 to start, and the fish tacos and the Caldo Tlalpe\u00f1o con Pollo to share as our mains.\n\nWe were given some crunchy garbanzo beans to start, and our drinks arrived a couple minutes later. My boyfriend then asked for water, and the waiter brought us a pitcher as well.\n\nThe melon dish was flavorful and a nice refreshing start to the meal. The drinks were also fun. The tepache had a kick to it and the strawberry lemonade was more sweet. \n\nAs for the mains, the fish tacos were a hit and the Tlapeno was a miss. The Tlapeno was a soup, and was super light on all the beautiful vegetables noted in the menu. It was served with warm corn tortillas, but it was a little odd to pair with a rather soupy (not thick) soup. Also, the soup itself was pretty bland.\n\nFinally, if you need to use the restroom, you have to exit the restaurant and re-enter to the spot where you pick up to-go orders. Kind of annoying.\n\nOverall, an A-OK place for fresh Mexican food with a more upscale casual atmosphere in the neighborhood. I subtracted 1 star for the sub-par service and 1 star for the disappointing soup.", "author": "Roya B."}

Really good, really flavorful, and really fresh! Everyone seemed to enjoy their food because plates were cleaned. In general, dishes are on the smaller side. Not a bad thing.\nOn that note, would probably not recommend the guac appetizer as it was too small of a portion. We annihilated it in 3 bites.

It was basically a large hard shelled taco with melted cheese layer like a quesadilla. It was such a nice balance of flavors and texture.\n\nThe totopos con chile was a little soggy I thought. I didn't think there was too much flavor there. Idk what happened there.\n\nThe carnitas was pretty boring I thought. The meat was tender and soft, but there wasn't much besides it. It was essentially just soft pulled pork...\n\nThe horchata was also pretty meh. It was a softer and more subtle flavor.", "author": "Victor D."}

Not that they made me fall in love with Mexican food again but that was definitely worth the calories.  \n\nService was awesome and the restaurant is nice and open.

We found this place via Yelp and we're staying not too far from this restaurant. We read a lot of positive reviews about the Tacos de Pescado al Pastor so we decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, we both were really disappointed. We felt that everything from the taco shell to the fish to the garnishes really had no flavor what so ever. The texture of everything on it was all over the place too - one bite of carrot over here and another bite of orange over there. It was also very pricey for two tacos.

Our server was very nice and amicably pointed out some choice small plates to share for our purposes rather than being miffed that we were merely grazing rather than eating a full meal; he was so friendly and relaxed that it felt like talking to an old friend. We chose to share the chips and a chicharrones quesadilla, which one of my friends had remembered fondly from her previous time at the restaurant. They offer complimentary fried chickpea snacks, which were addictive. Surprisingly, the chips were the standout of the night for me. One would think that tortilla chips can only be so good but the way these chips were tossed with salsa made the texture delightfully not too dry but somehow still crunchy. Of course, the cheese sprinkled all over the top and the ramekin of straight-up sour cream as dipping sauce didn't hurt either. The quesadilla had a homemade looking tortilla and crunchy pieces of pork skin inside. My friends and I still talk about the chips! We are looking forward to another appetizer filled meal at Nopalito in the future.", "author": "Amy G."}

Most things around are so overpriced but here...you get what you pay for. In the best sense. \n\nMy \"elegant\" chicken taquitos were crunchy, fresh and so tasty ! The chicken was marinated to perfection and that guacamole sauce added bliss to the meal. The savory meal satisfied my hunger but didn't leave me super full/overwhelmed or with leftovers that I'd dread to drag around the city. \n\n My boyfriend's chicken mole enchilada was also exceptionally well-balanced. Mole is a pretty rich, bold sauce that can be a bit much for someone who doesn't like super saucy dishes such as myself. HOWEVER (caps for emphasis), their chicken mole had a such a well-balanced combination of flavors that although prominent as its meant to be, it's not overpowering. Bold but not overwhelming. Rich but generously balanced. You get the point. \n\nSo yes, I highly recommend this gem. Enjoyed my experience very much. \n\nOh and the service was very kind and efficient.

Sadly she training and running in and out of the building seating one group of people every handful of minutes. So there is a long line making it seems like it's popular and packed when in reality it's probably 70% capacity. \n\nThe seating arrangements can be fun. Shared tables which I like because you can interact with some new people when eating. \n\nI initially was planning to get some kind of mixed drinks but when I watched the bartender under-pour each drink while using a jigger I quickly lost interest. \n\nNext the bathrooms. Or should I say ONE bathroom. It's a neutral bathroom and extremely disgusting. The smell is horrid. Definitely need to figure out a way to keep this clean and operating smoothly. \n\nThe service was short. The service was NOT overly polite or attentive. I come from a place where \"please, thank you and you're welcome\" are customary. Sadly here it's just too much to ask. \n\nThe food: \nPretty uneventful here. I mean they don't even offer a complimentary chips and salsa. Obviously not a big issue but hey it would go a long way. \nServing sizes are rather small for the price point. \nWife had the special which was red snapper. Under seasoned and not worth coming back for. \n\nI had the carne asada which was equally as bland as the red snapper. The toughness of the steak was similar to cutting a car tire. And the marinade/seasoning was so minuscule that my little wedge of lime overpowered any of the flavor. Normally when I have carne asada the lime marinade is sharp. The beef is tender and small tug of a knife across the grain of the beef allows it shred and cut easily. \n\nThe only thing worth getting her is the smashed black beans. The richness of the seasoned beans really comes alive especially when nothing else on the dish has any flavor\n\nAll in all a pretty heavily overrated place with lackluster meal options. Of course I'm from the south and know what GOOD Mexican inspired cooking is supposed to be. Sadly this truly misses the mark.", "author": "Robert B."}

I would still choose the former any day though. \n\nTotopos con Chile - This was highly recommended by someone I knew who loves the restaurant but also by a lot of Yelpers. It was really good. At first, I saw that all the chips were coated in the salsa... and thought oh no, they'll be soggy like chilaquiles. But they weren't at all. They remained crisp even by the time I got to the bottom of the bowl. So good! Even their sour cream tasted like they made it. \n\nQuesadilla de Roja con Chicharron - Not your ordinary quesadilla. It's made with a chile-corn tortilla so it has a rougher texture but it holds up to being fried and stuffed with a lot of stuff. I like how the crispy pork belly was chopped up--it worked well with all the other fillings and wasn't just dominating the whole dish. The quesadilla reminded me of a breakfast food for some reason. \n\nPozole - Really rich flavor but same thinner consistency as a traditional pozole. My husband loved their take on it but I prefer the homier, simple version. Not bad at all though! This also came with a side of tortilla chips which means there was something crispy in every dish we got. \n\nThe Almond Horchata and Andytown Coffee were perfect complements to the meal.", "author": "Shannon L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-06-27", "description": "I picked up some takeout (that I immediately ate a block away, so it didn't sit and get gross). The best thing about my experience was the woman handling the takeout, who was a rockstar and clearly highly competent; that said, the food was much less impressive. As a vegetarian, I get that the dishes I tried were not going to be their standout ones, but they shouldn't have to be -- it should all be good. I love Mexican food. I've lived in Mexico. This had a lot of the components of really great, authentic Mexican, and I really wanted to love it after seeing all the different named components of each dish on he menu. But it really missed the mark, which made the high price point sting a bit.\n\nThe Tacos Dorados de Papa were, in some ways, pretty spot on authentic. But they needed more seasoning and some serious elevation. The avocado salsa was basically like a watery guacamole that I didn't understand how to eat other than as a dipping sauce. There was some cabbage and queso fresco on the side, but it didn't seem to be dressed at all; I mainly ate it because I like cabbage and it added some flavor and texture to a pretty bland taquito de papa. The crema, which seemed to be regular sour cream (it was certainly way thicker than the avocado salsa), was much needed. The potatoes themselves were delightfully fluffy, but the whole thing needed more seasoning (and I didn't taste any jack cheese at all). \n\nThe Quesadilla de Calabacitas was sloppy and one-note. The green habanero salsa accompanying it was my favorite part, though it was still missing something for me. The veggies tasted as though they'd been saut\u00e9ed with little to no fat; The whole time I ate it I kept thinking how drastically it could be improved by a few pinches of spices and even a modicum of caramelization of those onions. The queso fresco, while lovely, didn't make any sense; there was a ton of it in there, and I would've liked it much better if it were replaced with a smaller amount of something more flavorful, like cotija. I also think this would benefit from the addition of garlic and roasted corn. \n\nLastly, the horchata. It was comforting, sweet, spicy, and filling in the way you want an horchata to be, but pretty texturally unappealing; it had a thick, dusty mouthfeel that cut at the back of my throat and made me wonder if it hadn't been sufficiently strained or blended. \n\nI really, really wanted to like this more than I did. I'll probably give it one more shot to try a few more things and see if there's an improvement, but ultimately I wouldn't really recommend it at this point.", "author": "Aly P."}

Overall - cool spot, tasty food, good menu with lots of small plate / sharable options, good drinks, and excellent service. I am a bit mixed on my # of stars, as I do think it's a little pricey for the cuisine type, atmosphere, quality, and plate size. \n\nFirst, we had the Ceviche de Temporada (the spring version). Light, fresh, and flavorful, it was a nice way to start. The combo of everything made the green sauce on the bottom tangy and acidic. I liked that it had two different kinds of seafood (halibut and calamari), and the pickled onions and shaved asparagus brought a different aspect over other ceviches. The chips were nice and thick, but I always think they can use extra salt. 4 stars, as I think it could have used a kick of umami somewhere for that 5th star.\n\nNext, we had the Huarache con Guisado de Lengua, as I can't resist a good tongue (insert joke here). I liked the thick, almost spongey, tortilla on the bottom; it really created a nice base for the dish. The tongue was cooked perfectly and was nice and tender, but of course, I wanted more of it! It was very good, but again, giving the same 4 star note as above, as I just wanted a litttttle bit more for that 5th star.\n\nBonus - we had a pitcher of the Killer Bee cocktail, but substituted tequila for the mezcal. I do think we got 4 cocktails out of it, although I don't think there was much of a price break for the pitcher vs glasses. \n\nOur server was great! Gave us all the time we needed to order without us feeling rushed, and offered substitutions when she overheard us discussing various items. Very attentive without feeling overbearing. \n\nOverall, great experience, and I will be back to try more dishes!", "author": "Rebecca S."}

They have a greeter at the door who helps with coordination. They don't have a wait area inside so the greeter acts more like a friendly guard.  Once inside, the seating area can be a bit small but manageable for just two people. It has this chill, relaxing, yet still high end feel to it. I guess that's probably the classic San Franciscan chic. \n\nIt's just a good place to relax and it's been great for brunch espicially. I've tried the different juices and really like the hibiscus orange. We tried a bunch of different foods from ensalada, quesadilla, etc. They taste good and it's more of a fusion and maybe a bit experimental type of place. I find this to be a wonderful place to hangout and chat.\n\nThe only downside is that to get to the restroom, you need to exit the restaurant then walk around the side to enter another set of doors. I don't know why the design is so complicated, perhaps it's because the bathroom is right next to the kitchen and they wanted to separate them?The bathroom is very clean, large, and sleek. \n\nProtip: You can call ahead of time and put your name down if you think there might be a wait.", "author": "Lana W."}

Worthy of all the recommendations.\n\nSince you can't make reservations at Nopalito, you may have to wait a while. However, you can ahead of time to put your names on the wait list (which is what we did). Because of this, when we arrived we were insta seated at a bar high table. \n\nIf you get seated at a large table, you may end up sharing it. Since there were only 5 of us at an 8 person table, there was one person seated at the far end we didn't know. Not a big deal at all, but something to be aware of!\n\nTo drink, I tried the white sangria. It was delicious and unique from the typical sangrias-- definitely worth a try! Food-wise, I don't think you can go wrong. Since I'm indecisive, I ended up trying both the tamal and memela de tinga. What can I say, I'm a sucker for food.\n\nI've loved tamales since I was a little kid, and the masa on the tamal was definitely up to snuff. The memela was also delicious-- the blue corn tortilla was nice and thick and the chicken + other toppings blended together beautifully.\n\nIn addition to the food that I ordered, the restaurant also provides some (baked?) chickpeas as a pre-dinner snack which were da bomb. I couldn't stop my hand from dipping into the bowl and ruining my appetite. We also ordered some guac for the table. This was the only disappointment for me, as there weren't that many chips included. However, given the quality of all the other foods, it's something easily forgiven.\n\nOverall a great meal.

Nopalito offers up traditional Mexican food using high-quality ingredients--and there's always a wait and a line! Luckily, you can call ahead to reserve your spot in line, so when I arrived for dinner on a Saturday, we were seated right away (by that time, the wait for a table of 4 was 2 hours!). The service was friendly though quite slow, and the atmosphere is clean and modern (definitely not a grungy spot). But while some of the dishes were good, I was somewhat underwhelmed by others, as they seemed a bit lacking in flavor or balance.\n\nOn our table soon after we sat down were some delicious spiced chickpeas for snacking on. We started our meal with a large round of appetizers--the totopos con chile (spiced tortilla chips with cotija cheese) was good--kind of like Doritos but much fancier. The panuchos de pollo al pibil (black bean stuffed corn tortilla with citrus achiote chicken) was nice, as was the ceviche served with even more tortilla chips. The ensalada de lechuga (lettuce/avocado salad) added a nice vegetable component to our meal, but my favorite appetizer was definitely the huarache con huitlacoche--a large, oval-shaped corn tortilla (we described it as a Mexican pizza) with beans and mushrooms (king oyster?). Sounds simple and unspecial, but the mushrooms had an amazing, deep umami flavor that went so well with all the different toppings!\n\nAfter waiting for what felt like an eternity, we finally got our entree--the carnitas served with a spicy salsa verde, cabbage salad, and plenty of warm corn tortillas. The carnitas were delicious--you could really taste all of the different ingredients that went into the marinade (primarily orange, milk, cinnamon), and putting all the different components of the dish into a taco really made the flavors come together. \n\nOverall, while some of the things we ordered were delicious, many of them didn't stick out all that much, and I felt that many of the things on the menu (especially the appetizers) were tortilla-focused, and I wish I got more of a balance.

Straight lemon lime ish flavor overpowered everything else, even the cheese. The ceviche tasted good, but the portion was super tiny, and had very little avocado.

The mexican is more expensive but we ended up a little stuffed, 3 cocktails and a bottle of red wine for $50 per person, pre-tip. I think that's pretty good... Anyways, below are the dishes and drinks we dined on: \nDrinks: El diablo margarita with mezacal (great), bloody maria (great and actually worked well at dinner), frescita (too sweet for my liking but wasn't my drink)\n* Totopos con Chile - 2 stars Very thick tortilla chips, dipped in light chili-sauce (spicy kick) and topped with cotiga cheese and green onion. Personally I wouldn't order again... the delicious topping is only on the very top layer so most of the dish are thick chips that aren't worth wasting space on \n* Empanada con Deshebrada de Res: 5 stars very large empanada that could feed 3 - 4 people. Shredded beef was so tasty, not too salty and I highly recommend for an app\n* Ensalada de Lechuga con Duraznos: 5 stars Little gem salad, nice fresh break-up to the meal that I recommend\n* Esquite - 5 stars Corn in cheesy mayonnaise sauce - shits bomb just get it  \n* Carnitas - 5 stars. Large portion for 3 people to get ~2 tacos each or 4 - 5 people make single taco. Meat was delicious, veggie accopaniments were awesome and their tortillas are also great. \n\nSo with that said - that amount of dishes is too much for 3 girls (cut the chips).

However, at the price range that they charge, I would have hoped for slightly more generous portions and better service. We had a reservation for my girlfriend's birthday, but were seated twenty minutes late and the hostess was rude when we inquired when our table would be ready. \n\nThe drinks are all takes on standard cocktails but exclusively use tequila and mezcal. Think a Moscow Mule with tequila etc. A small amount of fried garbanzo beans was given to our table of 6. While delicious, there were only about enough for 5-6 beans each. This set a tone for a night of being hungry. \n\nThe food was truly tasty. The carnitas were the most generous portion out of all the dishes we ordered. As a vegetarian, my tacos were nice, but nothing to write home about. \n\nI think this restaurant is a bit overrated. It consistently ranks high in reviews, perhaps due to being an elevated Mexican restaurant and having a sort of trendy feel to it.

A MUST GET. \n-Panucho de Pollo - one of the most juiciest chicken tacos. Theres just so much layer of flabors.\n-Chicharon Quesedilla - Not your regular quesedilla. Great crunch with the chicharon and \n\nThe Bad: \n-Queso Flameado con Chorizo y Nopales: lacks so much flavor and lacked the cactus flavor. \n-Hurache con suadero: a little too heavy and oily - would really avoid.\n\nDrinks ($11 each usually, unless you get a shot)\n-Their drinks are very light and refreshing - if you want a kick - just get a shot. \n-The bloody maria and sangria are missing that punch these drinks usually have, BUT the mezcal paloma and killer bee (very sweet flavor) are great to start off a meal! \n\nAfter some drinks and great bites, I highly suggest getting a popsicle.

It's a small restaurant but it wasn't busy during the day. Casual spot that felt like it was completely outdoors even though it was technically indoors or covered. Relaxed, laid-back atmosphere.\n\nI've also had their catering, which didn't stand out to me in comparison to other Mexican options or Mexican food in general, but it's a solid catering option. The meat was cooked super well (especially for catering), but was pretty greasy and lacked a wow factor.\n\nMy experience dining in was more memorable though. Not sure if it's because I ordered something different or because dining in is generally better than catering (or because of both), but I liked the food and overall ambiance enough to want to come back.\n\nThey started us off with some complimentary fried garbanzo beans, which had a nice crunch and were flavored well with some sort of spices. My group shared the Totopos Con Chile as an appetizer and I ordered the Caldo Tlalpeno Con Pollo as my entree, and both were delicious!\n\n-TOTOPOS CON CHILE ($7) - 5/5\n[tortilla chips, salsa de arbol, cojita cheese, onions, cilantro, crema, lime]\nAddicting! The tortilla chips were thick and crunchy and loaded with toppings. Lots of cheese but cojita isn't overly cheesy. It's not served with any guac but we asked for some on the side. The best part is the sauce the chips are covered in - some sort of spicy buffalo sauce that makes you just want more.\n\n-CALDO TLALPENO CON POLLO ($14) - 4.5/5\n[chicken consomme, cauliflower, broccoli, carrots, garbanzo beans, avocado, queso fresco, chipotle adobado]\nI honestly would've never expected to love a soup from a Mexican restaurant, but this was surprisingly good! And it was really healthy, which is something I always struggle to find at a Mexican spot. The chicken was cooked really well, the broth was light but flavorful and there were plenty of healthy veggies. Super filling, warm and satisfying, especially for a cold winter day.\n\n*** From catering ***\n\n-ENSALADA DE LECHUGA Y DURAZNOS ($9.50) - 4/5\n[lettuce, stone fruit, pickled red onion, pumpkin seeds, tortilla strips, cotija cheese]\nI'm always a fan of salads with fruit in it. The apples gave it a little sweetness and the cotija wasn't too cheesy\n\n-CARNITAS ($21) - 3.5/5\n[braised pork, orange, bay leaf, milk, cinnamon, beer, cabbage salad, pickled jalape\u00f1o, salsa de tomatillo]\nHuge chunks of pork. Tender but superr fatty. Flavor is solid but not super memorable.\n\n-POLLO AL PIBIL - 3.5/5\n[shredded citrus-achiote chicken]\nCooked pretty well - good texture and not dry - but rather greasy. Flavor is citrus-y but still lacking a wow factor\n\n-VEGETALES - 3/5\n[carrots, zucchini, potatoes, onion, broccoli and cauliflower]\nRoasted nicely, but MUCH greasier than I would've expected from a vegetable dish. I really liked the carrots, broccoli and cauliflower. Would be a 5 if it weren't so oily!\n\n-GUACAMOLE - 2.5/5\nAverage guac, but a little on the salty side.\n\n-CORN CHIPS - 3.5/5\nNot super special but I like that their chips are a lot thicker than average. Super crunchy, not too salty and very sturdy for dipping in guac and salsa!", "author": "Jessie L."}

We were seated next to a man who didn't like dogs and he was being extremely rude and loud, escalating the situation. We were a little taken aback by his rudeness and my friend told him there was no need to yell. The waiters immediately saw and moved us to a better spot and came and apologized for the man later on. Great customer service already gives them a good mark in my book!\n\nNow on to the food - delicious! We ordered the Gorditas Campechanas and the ceviche. Ceviche was fresh and seasoned perfectly! Gorditas Campechanas were little tortilla pockets full of meat, veggies, beans, and queso fresco. They were delicious and full of flavor with every bite!

I ordered the Ceviche which was alright, nothing to write home about. It came with tortilla chips that they said were made in house. I feel bad ragging on their chips, but I'm pretty sure they use the same exact recipe as Fritos. For my main dish I got the fish tacos. They  were decent. Overall I wasn't impressed.

We don't go out and choose Mexican food often but I'm glad we checked out this place. We have been to a mom and pop place near Sac State called Nopalitos but they are not related. This place is a quaint little restaurant next to a Peet's coffee. They have a indoor sunroom type patio, and they welcomed dogs! During our stay we saw several other dogs dining in as well. \n\nWe started off with the almond horchata, of course. If I'm gonna have Mexican food, I've got to have horchata. We had the totopos con chile as a starter, per recommendation. They were delicious! I thought they would be soggy because of all of the toppings, but they were far from soggy...very crispy, topped with onions, cotija cheese, cilantro, lime, and a side of sour cream. \n\nFor my entree I decided on their ceviche, since it sounded refreshing and light. It wasn't quite your typical ceviche - no shrimp - but it had calamari and fish, with apples, corn, avocado, red onion, and cilantro, meant to be eaten with their blue corn chips. It was the perfect serving size with enough to share with others too. \n\nGreat stop in the city if you're looking for some tasty Mexican food with bold flavors!", "author": "Ashley C."}

This Nopalito did not provide me the sophisticated and intimately casual experience as the one on 9th Ave did on a Friday night, instead serving us a night of disorienting frustration...\n\nI found myself constantly shouting over the music just to talk to my friend across the small table from me while the couple next to us did their best to elbow us as little as possible, which was hard because it was a full table of 8. Our service was half-mindedly rushed, which can be understable due to the number of people that night, but it took forever for us to take our order and our check. When the food finally arrived, it was spectacularly flavorful as always, but was just not worth the price for the tapas serving they offer us. \n\nOverall my enjoyment here gradually declined and I would not come back unless I really craved some Nopalito (which is pretty often actually...) and happended to be in the area.

Just watching that short excerpt of Guzman making the tortillas from scratch and etc. made me want to try the food and especially because we were really close to the area. When we first walked in the ambiance was great, it was around 5pm on a Saturday night and surprisingly it was too filled up. Others said the wait usually varies from 30mim- an hour or more but when my girlfriend and I came we were sat right away, only problem was that the two person tables are very close to each other that conversations start to conflict. Ambiance was a more modern and playful set up. The bar is located in the middle of the first room connected to open kitchen. \n\nService: Great, they were tentative to every thing we needed and he would come every 5-8 min asking if we needed tortillas, water etc. \n\nCarnitas: One of the best carnitas I ever had, reminded me of this place in LA that I hold the standard to. Try the taco with the meat before adding the pickled veggies. The meat was tender and great accompaniment to the fresh made tortillas. MUST GET\n\nEmpanada: At first I thought the meat itself was more bland in taste but the star of the empanada was the fresh made masa tortilla, everything worked well together especially the queso fresco on top \n\nTotopes: Probably the dish we liked the least but it packed the most spice, not to say it was really spicy. It comes with a salty cheese shredded on top and a crema or sour cream with a citrusy taste at the end. \n\nOverall a great place to try, and would come back again to have drinks and some tacos.", "author": "Jordan N."}

Made a reservation and showed up at 7:30. Ordered our drinks and got them in a timely manner. Everything after this went downhill. We waited 45 minutes for our salad while diners around us got their salads and food even though they were seated after us. Finally our salad came literally 2 minutes later our waitress comes up and says our food is ready can she bring it out. No we just started our salad. When we finished our salad she then brings out our food which is now cold. By this time we have both lost our appetites. Not the typical experience we usually have.

Decently priced at $37.00 (not including tip) for 2 of us. We ordered pork tacos, veggie quesadilla and a beef empanada to share. I wasn't impressed with the taste of my meal. It lacked a lot of flavor. I wanted salt, spices or something to add a kick, sadly, I felt it was quite bland. :(\nWe did receive a small bowl of complimentary dry roasted garbanzo beans, I liked those as it was spicy and had good flavors like paprika, cumin and/or chili powder.  \n\nThe check came with 2 small round complimentary cookies, similar to a Russian tea cookie. (I LOVE Russian tea cookies!) It was like a sugar and butter cookie with nuts topped with powered sugar. The texture is soft and should crumble in your mouth. I should really call this a Mexican/Spanish tea cookie, although it really wasn't bad, but it had too much nutmeg or allspice plus a lot of cinnamon. Sorry folks, I wasn't a fan!\n\nThe food lacked flavor (with the exception of the garbanzo), and  \"Russian tea cookies\" was overpowering with spice! \n\nNopalito is nestled in a cute plaza with street parking.

Nopalito reminded me of a \"Chipotle but slightly better\" type of place (not necessarily a good thing). Super busy on a Saturday around lunch time. I appreciate their call ahead service and I would encourage anybody to use that if they were thinking of coming in for breakfast or lunch. But in all honesty, I found the food to be boring and one dimensional. \n\nI ordered their quesadilla with pork belly and it was more reminiscent of a large hard taco with some stuff inside. They don't add any salt to their food so they conveniently have salt in a side dish on the table. I didn't realize this until halfway through my meal when I was feeling that my quesadilla was lacking any flavor. Once I added that salt, it improved but only slightly. I think some salsa or heat would have made the dish so much better. Also paying $7 for a plain taco was kind of meh for me.\n\nI did enjoy my horchata, the spicy chick peas, and the little cookie dessert at the end of our meal. Those were nice touches. Service was okay... nothing spectacular. Some people were super friendly while others were not so. \n\nIf you want real Mexican food, this certainly isn't it. Drive around and you'll probably find a real taqueria with authentic Mexican food for way cheaper.", "author": "Melissa M."}

We took a look on Yelp and there was Nopalito. We got to the store at around 3:30pm on a Sunday and I was pretty surprised to see that the place was actually jam-packed even though it was so late! We could only get tables at the counter, but it's a chef's counter so that's not too bad! We went with some of Yelper's favorites. Since it was a pretty late lunch/early dinner/midday snack or whatever, we didn't get too much.\n\ntotopos--yum yum chips and salsa! but way fancier and way more delicious WARNING this thing is spicy!!! It's not just the sauce. It's something in the chip. Not sure how they make it, but we were both weaklings and couldn't handle it. It was absolutely delicious though but will definitely burn your mouth off! I usually am okay with spicy but I found this to be a very dry spicy which is why it was really hard to actually eat without coughing and chugging a ton of water. It is very delicious and worth trying though!\n\nceviche--thought this was mediocre. It wasn't awful but wasn't great. It was okay ceviche served with tortilla chips. Just a nice refreshing contrast to the burning hot totopos that we got.\n\nempanada -- YUM. This was pretty freaking delicious. Embarrassingly, I've actually never had an empanada before, but this was goooood. Super tender pork inside, the shell was just right, and all the garnish and everything else going on with it was pretty yummy. It was just great that the meat was juicy and tender. \n\nFinal price was less than $20... can't remember the exact bill but I thought it was pretty reasonable for a late brunch kind of thing.\n\ntldr; yummy Mexican food at an affordable price! great service, great atmosphere", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Margaritas were really good - not too sweet - more tart.  Draft beer selections really good.  Staff very friendly and helpful.  Service excellent.  Make sure to watch the staff person making the corn tortillas.  Hard work and tortillas are a must have.  They do not take reservations but we did call ahead and put our name on the list.  \n\nThe only reason I gave this restaurant 4 stars is because we could not buy a gift card at the restaurant - only online.  Thought this was a bit odd.  Customer wants to spend more money - to me it is a no brainer that you take the money when offered.  Would suggest they enable gift card purchases at the restaurant.

Sad to say that our experience here was pretty mediocre at best. The service was not existent as our server didn't sound enthused or interested at all in serving us. After he took our initial order he mumbled the special to us and walked away. And the only time he came back to check on us was when we were pretty much done with our food. Anyways, when it came to food i was pretty excited to try the ceviche and enchiladas de mole but was quickly disappointed. Although the ceviche itself was quite tasty the portion was pretty small for the price point. On top of that the chips that were served were pretty hard and stale. When it came to the enchiladas. I was surprised to only get two enchiladas with barely any sauce and nothing else to accompany it. Pretty overpriced to charge  14 dollars for two tortillas with a little sauce and chicken... otherwise they were alright... my boyfriend got the pambazo with chorizo and papa and it was good but so soggy that when he went to pick it up it fell apart. We ended up paying over 50 dollars for over glorified Mexican food, when I've had even better for a fraction of the price.

He called in an hour ahead to make a reservation, and by the time we got there, our seats were ready! The place is very cute - there is indoor seating and also patio. We picked a table in the patio, which is kind of like a green house, with windows all around so you can see the outside. Very cool! If you are worried about being cold, they got outdoor heaters! \n\nFor food, there are two general types to pick from - small dishes (more than $10) and main dishes (more than $12). For the two of us, we got 2 small dishes and 1 main dish, which came up to be $25/person with tax and tip. For the small dishes, we got a tamale and ceviche, both of which were SO GOOD! The tamale had sweat potato filling and tasted VERY HEALTHY! The cerviche was made with a few different seafood (octopus and some other fish...), drizzled with orange juice, which gave it a very unforgettable taste. The ceriche was served with blue corn tortilla chips, and the serving size was great.\n\nFor our main dish, we ordered the pork tender carnitas with cabbage slaw. THIS IS A MUST TRY!!! It was served with 4 tortilla wraps. The pork was extremely tender and well reasoned. And you can tell they calculated the portion sizes, because we just barely finished everything with 4 wraps. Very satisfied feeling when you don't waste anything. :)\n\nGreat experience! The food is a bit on the expensive side, but not too much if you treat yourself once in a while. It is a very cute brunch place. There is a market right next door, if you choose to walk and digest after your meal. Would definitely come again with one or two friends.", "author": "Wendy F."}

Typically a party of 8 is the maximum allowed, because that is how many the communal table seats. They were nice enough to make an exception, especially since they usually only accept call-aheads to be placed on the wait list. We arrived right when they opened at 11:30 and there was a line of people waiting to get in! The restaurant was filled in a matter of minutes. I loved the relaxed atmosphere. It felt contemporary but still a bit rustic. Our waiters and servers were always there right when we needed them. They were always refilling our waters and keeping our food and drink orders coming with an upbeat attitude. \n\nI don't have any complaints about what we ordered. We mostly went with small plates so that we could share them and try a lot more items. Even when we got one serving of an item, it was still able to make a round of all 9 of us so that we each had at least a bite. Some of my favorites were:\n\nTotopos con Chile: Tortilla chips with a thick red salsa and a big mound of freshly grated cheese. These were so delicious for something seemingly so simple. A squeeze of lime just took it over the edge.\n\nCeviche de Pescado y Calamar: Fish and calamari ceviche. The calamari was included in large pieces so that you didn't have to dig around for it. The flavors were so fresh and this is one of my favorite ceviche dishes I have ever had.\n\nEmpanada con Deshebrada de Res: A grass-fed shredded beef empanada with a beautiful mound of cheese and sauce on top. The corn pastry shell tasted freshly made and it was a pretty large size. \n\nCarnitas: Pork braised in orange and beer, among other things. The flavor on these was KILLER and they were so tender. I could have eaten so much of this. Definitely a must-try.\n\nWe finished off the meal with some house-made paletas (Mexican popsicles). I chose Arroz con Leche and it wasn't just flavored with it; I came across many pieces of rice. This was my first time trying this flavor and it was just perfection. With your bill they also deliver some tiny hazelnut cookies. I could eat here again and again.

I needed a nourishing and refreshing meal, and I needed it fast.  \n\nLuckily the place wasn't busy mid-afternoon on a Friday.  It was a piece of cake to cozy up to the counter and soak in the contemporary atmosphere.\n\nA margarita was a good refreshing choice to start.  It was a bit sour for my taste, but definitely had a nice kick, and was a nice accompaniment for the complimentary bowl of fried garbanzo beans.\n\nThe real highlight of lunch at Nopalito was the ceviche verde de pescado y calamar.  The fish was super fresh and tangy, while the squid was silky-smooth and not the least bit rubbery -- and I say this as someone who normally shies away from calamari that's not of the deep-fried variety! \n\nI wasn't as huge of a fan of the totopos con chile -- spicy tortilla chips with cotija cheese, onions, cilantro, crema and lime.  Despite all the toppings, these glorified nachos were actually kind of bland.  I guess I expected more (and I don't mean in terms of portion size, which was quite behemoth).\n\nService was fast and formal, in that impersonal sort of way that feels more \"Cheesecake Factory\" and less \"local neighborhood joint\".  On the other hand, it was a wonderful surprise to receive a complimentary almond butter cookie at the end of the meal!\n \nThe few complaints I had are all pretty minor.

A long wait, but to be expected at a popular restaurant. It's now 7PM and I ask the hostess when we will be seated. She replies by saying that she underestimated how long it would take other customers to finish their dinners and that it could take another 30 minutes before we were seated. \n\nI was really floored by this \"mistake\" in large part because the hostess didn't take the time to let us know that it would take MUCH LONGER for us to be seated than she'd estimated. I had to inquire about this myself and was given an attitude to top it off. It seemed like other people were being given priority seating over my group. Several times I saw that the hostess was taking in people who had just arrived. \n\nFinally, we decided to walk over to Green Chile Kitchen because, let's be real, no one has time to sit around waiting for a table for 1.5 hours. We got a text message from Nopalito 2 HOURS LATER saying that they had a table ready for us. Really? Who would wait for 2 hours for a table. \n\nManagement needs to better train their hostesses, and the hostess should not be in charge of cleaning tables and setting up utensils. We noticed several times that the hostess was running around doing things that normally a busser would do. \n\nI'm definitely not coming back here.

Also they were too spicy (and keep in mind I like spicy foods).\n\nWe ordered a MARGARITA PITCHER ($40), which gave the two of us two drinks each. They are very generous with their alcohol- the drinks were strong but tasty! We also ordered the BIRRIA DE RES ($23) to share- and I must say we were both STUFFED.

I asked the waiter for a side of salsa and he just brought more of the habanero tobasco.\n\nOverall, we thought the food was great. I would definitely come back but I won't get the Totopos.

I am accustomed to having amazing Mexican food from food trucks or slightly run down but delicious mom and pop's type of establishments. Whenever I see Mexican food in more upscale places, I tend to assume the flavor would be watered down. I wouldn't even say this place is \"upscale\" but it definitely has a more modern and trendier feel to it.\n\nDespite that -- the food here is divine! It's not the most traditional but I'm not really an \"authenticity\" purist. Some traditionally prepared foods could benefit from some culinary techniques not often used in the cuisine. This place combines traditional flavors with amazing techniques and the result is fantastic food. The mole was so delicious I debated licking the plate clean. My carnitas was so moist and instead of covering up the flavor of the pork, it highlighted the best of it.\n\nI loved that we sat by the kitchen and could watch them put together the food. My mouth watered at almost everything that came out of the kitchen. The portions are perfectly sized. Service was understated but always available when needed.

But let's start from the beginning...we were actually seated pretty quickly (within 5 minutes) but we had our seats almost given away cause we weren't present at first call...why ask for a phone number if you don't even bother calling?? Luckily, my brother had a sixth sense about our status - we were just exploring the market next door though.\n\nStarted the meal off with the machaca de camaron con huevo y salsa. This was very delicious and full of flavor. I'll admit that I couldn't really taste the shrimp though. This was followed up by the quesadilla roja con chicharron. It's not your traditional quesadilla...the shell is uber crispy, but still pretty light. Flavors were fresh and paired well together but there was basically no chicharron in our quesadilla. Granted we split it 4 ways, but everyone only got a sliver of chicharron. Next we had the torta. It was basically a pulled pork sandwich. Absolutely nothing stood out to me, not the bread, not the pork...and to think this one was the recommended dish on Food Network. Lastly, we had enchiladas de mole con pollo. I was not a fan of the mole sauce....I've had way better. But the chicken was very tender and juicy...I'll give it that.\n\nThese size of the dishes here are small, but prices do vary from $6 to $13/plate. \n\nWould I go back, probably...\n\nDefinitely not for the value, but in terms of atmosphere and hanging out with friends, this is definitely a place to consider.

I consulted with Yelp before I agreed, and saw that the reviews were great so I gave him the thumbs up! And let me just preface this review by saying that if the food hadn't been so ridiculously good, this entire review would have a totally different look to it. By different I mean, ugly! \n\nWe arrive, reservation-less on a Saturday evening at close to 8pm. We'd been out all morning, so we were fairly tired, and just wanted to get a bite to eat. We walk up to the hostess and she tells us it will be at least an hour and a half wait. AHH! Earlier that day, we'd opted against waiting 45 minutes for lunch and then realized that by the time we walked to another spot, the 45 minutes passed, and we ended up waiting longer. Needless to say, this time around we decided to wait it out. We walked back to our car and waited there instead of out in the freezing cold. \n\nAs I'm sitting I notice that NO ONE else is waiting. Why? I saw few people ahead of us, behind us, check-in, get seated. Sure there was a bar the hostess offered up to the other 99.5% of kid-less patrons that arrived, but even still, the people that checked in immediately before us were no where to be found. Hmm. \n\nSo 90min later, we get a text saying our table is ready. As I'm walking up, I see the hostess put the high chair next to our table. I say our table, because we were literally the ONLY people with a kid in the entire restaurant. So she walks out, and knowing full well we've been waiting for 90 minutes, she decided to check in the 2 couples that may or may not have arrived before us and had US wait!!!! She suggested the bar for them, and immediately took them inside to show them the bar area. We waited another few minutes before she came back for us, and sat us. UGH! \n\nI also noticed that we were the ONLY \"latino\" people there. Now, keep in mind, it is very rare that I feel like I've been the victim of racism. I think in my entire lifetime I've felt discriminated against, twice. I couldn't shake the feeling, when I saw how friendly the hostess was to everyone else, who happened to be white. So I actually edited my review to include this bit of information because I went back to see if anyone else had complained about this same sort of thing, and THEY HAD! TONS of people complain about the hostess and one person in particular noticed the racial stuff. If there are so many complaints about her, why isn't anyone doing anything about it?\n\nFortunately, our server was great! No complaints there. \n\nThe food itself was it's ONLY redeeming factor. Absolutely AMAZING! We ordered the Tamale, the Huarache, and the Empanada ... ALL incredibly delicious. Absolutely exquisite. Just, great quality food & ingredients! I also tried their Almond Horchata which was very tasty and unique. \n\nI would absolutely visit here again if I could order my food to-go and not deal with the BS seating.", "author": "Joana F."}

The reviews seem spilt between hype and disgust, as seems to be the trend here in SF. \n\nI enjoyed my meal, but only a 2.5star amount. They were not busy by any means, but no one came for our drinks for a good 10-15 minutes, and we were never given plates for our appetizer. \n\nOrdered :\n- Totopos con Chile to share (1/5) : this isn't an appetizer to dip chips into various sauces. It's a bowl of chips already coated in the salsa, it is instead very messy and pretty bland in taste ...while plentiful in sweaty spices. We also had no plates on which to eat them, and made our table subsequently gross. \n- Empanada Con Deshebrada De Res (3/5) : meat was flavorful, pastry was slightly overcooked making it dry and crumblier than usual, toppings were paired nicely. Enjoyable enough, but simply average. \n- Complimentary cookies that came with the check (4/5) : I believe they were Mexican wedding cookies, and we each were given one.", "author": "Amanda W."}

But they earned an additional star because my order was takeout and they forgot to put the avocado on the side in my bag--- and they handled it just how everyone would want to be treated.  \n\nOk the details:   Nearly $18 on uber fees later to/from my hotel I envisioned eating my dinner just i as I hoped with some pieces of avocado smushed into every bite.   When I got back to my hotel, turned on my tv, I was saddened to see no avocado.   I called the restaurant and they offered to remove it and then later Lauren called back and said they would take care of the whole thing.   Nice.   \n\nTwo tips:\n1) if u r visiting SF, come here and if u do takeout, check your bag \n2) if you get the quesadilla I really think it needs some more greens and avocado.  It is really quite good but needs a little some green to balance the generous portion of meat.", "author": "Rachel L."}

One of those places that walks the walk with all the talk it gets.\n\nThe restaurant:\nIt's connected to Falletti Foods grocery store on Broderick so it conveniently has it's own parking lot if you're driving. No reservations, but they take wait-list calls two hours in advance. I called at 5:30pm and got a table for 5 at 7:30pm with no problem at all. They have a sorta strict policy of not seating you until your entire party arrives so make sure to be on time unless you want members of your crew waiting outside for you (they can also go wait at the bar of course). \n\nThe food:\nWe had shots of mezcal to start the night. They normally don't come with the salsa chase that mezcal should be downed with, but I asked our waiter about it and he was nice enough to hook it up. I guess mezcal has nothing to do with the restaurant itself, but I could drink mezcal forever (haha sike), so I'm just very happy they had a large variety of it.\n\nWe got the Totopos con Chile as our appetizer. With an extra lime they were the perfect amount of spice and sour I'd want in a chip. I'd recommend this appetizer over any of the others on the menu. For my main dish I got the Birria de Res and I shared it with my cousin's Carne Asada con Nopales. Both dishes were aesthetically basic, but tastefully intricate! We really liked dipping the carne asada in the stew that the Birria de Res was served in. You can also ask for extra tortillas and make a taco out of the meat, black beans, salsa, and fajitas that come with the carne asada! Ended the night with some complimentary cookies that I cannot remember the name of for the life of me, but were a kind gesture on behalf of our waiter.\n\nOverall, would totally recommend for a night that you have a reason/occasion to go out to eat/celebrate. If I had five words to review this place I'd say: Mezcal, mezcal, more mezcal, mezcal?", "author": "Shayan S."}

Fortunately, I had no problem getting seated at a communal table early on a Saturday evening.

You need to go outside and walk around to the take-out space if you need to use the loo.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-15", "description": "On Saturday, 2/14/15, my girlfriend and I ate at Nopalito for dinner. I had to give this place a try after seeing Nopalito on Taco Trip hosted by Aaron Sanchez. Nopalito was also featured on the Food Network show Diners Drives and Dives. After hearing a lot of positive reviews about Nopalito from famous chefs along with people I know, so I would think this place was going to knock my socks off. Well...it didn't. Here's why...\n\nAtmosphere/Decor:\n\nThe restaurant is pretty small. The tables were very close to one another. There were two dining areas. One was a covered patio type dining area and the other was your traditional inside dining area. There's an open kitchen. There's not much to Nopalito. It reminded me of every other restaurant in San Francisco. Kind of plain in a way. \n\nFood:\n\nWe ordered the Carnitas (Braised pork, orange, bay leaf, milk, cinnamon, beer, Cabbage salad, pickled jalape\u00f1o and salsa de tomatillo) tortillas, Birria de Res (Grass fed beef stewed in ancho chile, roasted tomatoes, sesame seeds, spices, pickled onion, cilantro, lime, Mexican rice and salsa de arbol) and a side of Whole Pinquito Beans along with a side of crema. \n\nThe Carnitas were okay. In my opinion they were lacking in flavor. There was no wow factor when I was eating the Carnitas. On the positive side they give you a good amount of Carnitas and the texture of the Carnitas was good. I didn't care for the Cabbage salad. It was very plain and lifeless. The salsa de tomatillo was really good. My girlfriend liked this salsa a lot. The tortillas tasted good and fresh. \n\nThe Birria de Res was underwhelming and over salted. The quality of the meat was good and tender. It just wasn't seasoned well. There was also a large amount of fat. I'm not used to eating shredded beef with a lot of fat. I like it better when the fat is trimmed off. The Mexican rice was good but it tasted a little burnt. \n\nService:\n\nOur waiter Michael was very nice and attentive throughout our dinner. He always made sure our waters were topped off. The food came out fairly quick. \n\nOverall:\n\nI had very high hopes for Nopalito. I honestly thought Nopaltio was going to be one of the best Latin infused restaurants I've ever eaten at but it wasn't. The food fell short and left me unsatisfied. If you're in SF and craving Mexican food try Lolo or El Techo de lolinda.", "author": "David R."}

Yes We were very blessed to have such an awesome cook at home which is bad now because we're always comparing Mexican places to her cooking. So with that in mind I must say best thing we had was the tamal de Huitlacoche and mushroom. Keep in mind that this is the tamal made in banana leaf, topped with sour cream and quezo fresco! The totopos con chile are really yummy too not spicy but are flavor full. The gorditas and quesadilla de chicharron were really tasty but needed a bit of salt. We also had the mole enchiladas now if you're like me that likes spicy mole vs sweet mole these are not for you. Of course the parentals were not a fan but my husband really enjoyed them since he doesn't tolerate spicy food. Nothing comes out of microwaves you can watch the kitchen staff being preparing your dishes. My favorite drink was the tepache.

Despite calling an hour ahead, we still had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. Thinking back to that night, we should have been more aggressive in terms of our position on the lady's handheld electronic waiting list...\n\nThe restaurant buds from the nearby Falletti Foods grocery store, which meant that I mistook it for a very busy cafeteria. Mind you, it is busy, but the interior is anything but cafeteria-like. The indoor and heated&covered outdoor seating house a bustling social ambiance that lends to good conversation with good food.\n\nWe were first given a small bowl of complimentary fried garbanzo beans. Spiced with chili, they were a flavored crunchy kick to our taste buds and our appetite. The water came out in a trendy glass bottle (like at Gather in Berkeley), as it's filtered on-site. One friend ordered the horchata, which was more watered down than what I've had at other places but was extra spiced and iced.\n\nFor our meal, my friend and I decided to split two dishes, which came to an affordable $15 each for us that evening. We first ordered the CALDO TLALPENO, a soup comprised of chicken consomm\u00e9, carrots, brussel sprouts, cauliflower, \ngarbanzos, avocado, queso fresco, and chipotle adobado for $10 (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ODWobJZkhfWpnsuF90QHmQ/l.jpg). I had my eye on this dish because of its presence on the SF Big Eat 2013 list (http://www.7x7.com/big-eat-2013#/51). The Caldo Tlalpe\u00f1o has a combination of ingredients that is unique and refreshing, with the creamy avocado chunks, the pleasing queso fresco, the textured brussel sprouts, and the mild zing from the dried chipotle adobado pepper that makes your soup spicier the longer you keep it in your soup. That being said, this soup is a one-time order for me.\n\nThe next dish was the CARNITAS for $15.50, which is braised pork seasoned with orange, bay leaf, milk, cinnamon, and beer that comes with 4 small yellow corn tortillas, cabbage salad, pickled jalape\u00f1o, and salsa de tomatillo (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0zxiKpUHJxBQqZK65TTAqA/l.jpg). And WOW, this was AMAZING! Another Yelper, Talia G, had recommended to ask for the carnitas extra fried, and I'm glad I did. The pork chunks were generous with a sublime crispy skin and pockets of devilishly delicious fat, and the pork didn't exactly fall off the bone but was tender enough. The seasoning was subtle, perhaps too subtle since I can only really remember the richness of the pork. The pickled onions on the side were a bit spicy (I stopped eating those haha), and the salsa verde was divine. Making my own mini tacos was so fun with such scrumptious ingredients!\n\nAnother friend ordered two vegetarian items, the Naranjas con Chile, Lim\u00f3n y Queso (Cara Cara & blood oranges, grapefruit, pickled red onions, chile de arbol, chile guajillo, lime, and queso fresco), $6, and the Tamal de Amarillo con Calabaza (corn masa, butternut squash, jalape\u00f1o, Oaxacan cheese, mole of dried chiles, tomatillos, peanuts, pumpkin seeds, and spices), $6 (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/g_n4W2Itr4hIz9g0bDxztg/l.jpg). Judging by how she finished her plates, they must have been tasty :)\n\nTo wrap up the meal, each person was given a complimentary Mexican wedding cookie, a small almond cookie topped with powdered sugar (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/p-zumNhO2IwaByhbR0GnQQ/l.jpg). The crunchy almond cookie was a perfect ending--if only they could give us more than one!\n\nNopalito has fantastic food with prompt service and an enjoyable ambiance.

Friends checked in around 7 and estimated time was 745pm (table for 3, no reservations allowed). There is a wait area outside with a heat lamp, but be sure to dress warm since we are around Divisadero where the fog loves to sneak on in. Once you are closer to being seated, there may be a chance to wait at the bar. We did. We were given complimentary corn nuts (spicy) and sangrias and margaritas. Very good Sangria!\n\nWe were seated and wait staff was excellent. My friends typically like to share everything so I had a chance to taste all ordered - pretty tasty! I ordered the Trout over Fava beans. It was so good, I finished it completely. It definitely has a kick, so if you do not like spicy, I would avoid. So flavorful though. The Citrus salad was a perfect starter. My friend's Chicken Mole was so delicious. We had room for dessert and had a citrus flan, also very good. \n\nThings that can be improved: bathroom is outside, you have to walk and go to the take out area in another door and possibly wait outside if there is a line. Bathroom wasn't as clean or welcoming like the dining area as I hoped. The guacamole was delicious, but portion was small for three people. However, if you noticed, my rating was unaltered!

It was a very generous portion of tortilla chips, salsa de arbol, cotija cheese, crema and lime. It definitely had some heat but was also extremely flavorful. As an entree my husband ordered the carnitas ($15.50) and said they were possibly the best he has ever had. I  ordered Arroz a la Tumbada ($16.00)  a seafood stew of brown rice, salmon, mussels, shrimp, tomato, onion, morita chile, pickled serrano chile and herbs. It was phenomenal. I would have licked the bowl if i had been eating it at home. My cousin is a vegetarian so the server recommended she try the quesadilla de Primavera. ($ 9.00) which was a corn tortilla filled with asparagus, mushroom, spinach, quesillo, queso fresco, spring onion, cilantro, and salsa de chile puya. She enjoyed it very much. \n\nWe liked Nopalito so much we seriously contemplated going back again before we left town. I just don't have anything bad to say.

While Nopa showcases New American and Californian cuisine, Nopalito features upscale Mexican and Latin cuisine.  This restaurant (this is one of their two locations) has a clean and contemporary look that includes a chef's counter where you get to see obstructed views of the kitchen in action.\n\nUnlike Nopa, Nopalito is open for lunch and their lunch features casual Mexican fare, but more upscale and dinner-esque entrees are also available.  A lot of their plates looked good--their Totopos con Chile looked like delicious and spicy nachos.  Their many tostadas and tacos appeared to be fresh and tasty with all kinds of great textures.  I liked how their lunch menu offered Mexican breakfast/brunch plates too like chilaquiles and a take on huevos rancheros.\n\nI tried a few things and a lot of it was good though not exceptional.  However, ordering other items here might yield a much more satisfying experience.  I started with their complimentary spicy fried chickpeas--addictively crispy, crunchy and a lot of heat.\n\nMy first course was a salad of winter citrus (orange, blood orange, grapefruit), avocado, pickled red onions, chile, lime, and queso fresco.  I liked how they were showcasing a seasonal salad at lunch and the citrus was great--bright, sweet, tart, and just the right amount of acid.  I liked the creaminess and freshness of the avocado too.  I wish the cheese had a saltier note.  I also felt the salad needed something crispy or crunchy to balance out the plate.\n\nNext was a corn masa and sweet potato tamale, which was topped with a mole-esque sauce of chile, peanuts, sesame and pumpkin seeds, tomatillo, and onion.  The tamale was good.  It was moist and the corn flavor was really good.  The sweet potato part of the tamale was merely chunks of slightly bland sweet potato stuffed in the tamale.  I thought it was going to have a more pronounced sweet flavor to go with distinct heat and smokiness of the mole-esque sauce.\n\nMy next course was a very lightly crispy empanada that was filled with moist grass-fed beef (braised beef).  The filling was good--meaty and moist (very tender beef) that was nicely seasoned.  The empanada was not a traditional empanada shell.  Instead, it was a very thin and crispy shell (very fresh too).  The empanada was topped with cabbage, queso fresco and salsa frita de guajillo.\n\nThe lunch ended with a good though small almond butter cookie, which was complimentary.  I do not believe a dessert menu is offered at lunch.\n\nService was decent.  The food came out at a quick pace and the staff was very attentive; however, while the service was polite and pleasant, it did not feel as friendly and engaging as I have experienced with other restaurants in San Francisco.\n\nPrices felt very reasonable for upscale Mexican cuisine.  A lot of the menu was $10 and below and the portions felt like more than enough food for lunch.\n\nNopalito is an upscale Mexican restaurant that utilizes high quality ingredients to produce nicely presented and tasty (albeit not excellent) food.  I only tried a small sampling of the menu here and the menu is filled with great sounding dishes and a lot of the food looked great too.  If you enjoy upscale Mexican cuisine and do not mind paying the slightly higher prices (when compared to hole-in-the-walls and not other contemporary restaurants), Nopalito is definitely one to consider for lunch or dinner if you live or spend a lot of time in San Francisco.\n\nNopalito is part of a retail plaza that has its own free parking lot.

The restaurant doesn't take reservations, so we showed up at 3:30 to put our name down for a party of 6. Of course there was a wait, which we expected, so we asked to go to the bar to wait. \n\nHere's the thing, the bar at Nopalito is pretty much non existent and there isn't much of a waiting space. For a place that doesn't take reservations, you'd expect them to have a solid waiting place where you can grab a drink/apps.\n\nWell my family and I still ended up trying to grab a drink at the barely-there bar where you have to stand, but the bartender (lady with short pixie cut hair) wouldn't even recognize us, let alone look at us for at least 20 minutes. I would understand if she was busy pouring drinks (although a hello would have been nice), but she was just chatting with the other servers. After my mother tried to grab her attention, she was very rude to us, but finally poured us a drink. When we tried to get another round, we had a similar experience and ultimately ended up leaving.\n\nThe food here is good, but not good enough for a poor experience.", "author": "Jalahn W."}

I ended up here on a late lunch on a Friday randomly just after the holidays with colleagues. Both had dined here and loved it. I love the outdoor seating area it's really cute and almost reminds of a spot you'd see in SoCal or LA. There was a bit of a wait even at 1:30 later lunch time probably because it was still holiday and a Friday. Granted, we waited about 15-20 minutes which wasn't all that bad. I didn't mind at all. \n\nThe food was PHENOMENAL! So much flavor and really still showed you they can do mexican food without an overload of cheese and beans. It was done so right. We started with the Totopos con Chile which was seriously amazing. The tortilla chips and cheese were so good. It wasn't too heavy and one of the best things we ate. It's a great starter and a MUST TRY! It was topped with cotija cheese, lime and their crema. Can't speak more to how good this was and the portion is rather large. I could get full on just this and 3 of us were dining,\n\nWe ended up sort of doing family style and ordering a few things to try. I always prefer this when dining. I can never finish a meal on my own. We ordered the fish tacos (which came with 2 tacos) and asked that we order a third. They were fantastic and delicious. I'm a big fan of fish tacos and these just did it. I would highly recommend it.  \n\nI was told to try the carnitas and we ended up getting them. They were delicious just as well. I couldn't have eaten it on my own - way too much food and meat but a few pieces really hit the spot. I would gladly try it again. We also ordered the beet salad to make it a really balanced meal and it was delicious too. I have no compaints about the food - everything was ON POINT!\n\nIt was a little slow but I do think it was just busy.

I decided on the squash blossom quesadilla and my friend ordered the mushroom tamale and beef empanada. I thought the higher price tag of my quesadilla might translate to a bigger portion, but all three dishes were about the same size. My quesadilla was fresh and flavorful. I can't remember the last time I had a quesadilla that didn't weigh me down. I sampled my friend's dishes and neither won me over. The tamale would have been good, but the crema topping had a flavor that reminded me of Elmer's paste (yes, I ate glue as a child). Our check was accompanied by by a dish of small, nutty cookies. A nice sweet end to the meal.\n\nWhile service was prompt, our meal felt rushed. The restaurant does a brisk business and the high customer turnover made service hurried.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-30", "description": "The jury is still out on this one. I still can't decide if I like this place or think it's not all that special. Nopalito, I think, deserves another try down the road. For now, here's an explanation for the 3-star rating. \n\nI recently went in for lunch with a friend. It was a Thursday around lunch hour and it was moderately busy, but definitely not packed. The restaurant was unexpectedly attached to Falletti Foods which threw me off. I was expecting it to be a stand-alone place and not adjacent to a Peet's and a market. Not necessarily a bad thing -- just an observation. Keep that in mind because I was a little confused upon finding this place. \n\nAnyway, I walk through a door, and woops! It's (I think) the take-out entrance. You have to enter on the Fell St. side (not Broderick). When you go around the corner and find the correct entrance, you briefly walk through a handsome atrium and then a more traditional restaurant set-up. I was immediately met with a server and a hostess. I told them I was waiting for a friend so they took my name in case it got busy. While I waited, I thought it was kind and classy to bring me a glass of water and some spicy chickpeas to pick on while I waited. Definitely did not ask for that, but really appreciated the small gesture. One of the staff, who interestingly enough kinda reminded me of Rick Bayless (of Chicago's Frontera Grill, Xoco, and other restaurants of the Bayless \"empire\"), warmly welcomed me while I waited. Again, immediate good vibes from the staff.\n\nMy friend walks in and we are sat in the atrium area. (There's good lighting there! Perfect for food photo opportunities! Yes, I said it.) We order some libations to get our day going. Yes, we're drinking on a Thursday afternoon, but he and I work very hard. So, why not?I had the El Diablo ($9) which was Pueblo Viejo Blanco, Cassis, lime, and ginger beer. Very refreshing for mid-day, and provided a nice kick! It was perfect to drink when we shared the totopos con chile ($6). Now, let me say, this was quite the shock in terms of presentation... and even value. The table next to us also gasped when they saw this. Granted, this was \"just an order of chips and salsa,\" but a wild version of chips and salsa! The chips were doused in this beautiful red salsa that coated those beautiful corn strands. Yet, amazingly, the chips remained crunchy and firm albeit a bit wet. Hey, I personally like that texture combination. (Reminds me of my days in high school when I was introduced to corn chips and Tapatio shaken in a bag. Don't knock it 'til you've tried it! It's brilliant.) Anyway, the chips had shaved cojita on top and a luxurious crema (that was a little bit on the rich side to be honest, but still delish!). \n\nFor the entrees, my friend and I shared the tacos de pescado al pastor. I liked this, but it wasn't particularly memorable. The fish was nicely cooked, but it lacked that perfect amount of salt. The fresh orange slices added a nice flavor contrast, and you can definitely taste tomatillo. Nevertheless, it was good, but not great. Much to my surprise, I wasn't altogether excited or inspired by the machaca de camaron con huevo y salsa. This cross between a seafood stew and a very wet omelette was also under-seasoned. The overall flavor profile was a bit \"boring\" to put it crudely. The accompanying corn tortillas were good, but again, nothing particularly spectacular. Now, I don't expect to be \"wow-ed\" everywhere I go, but for a place regarded by many locals as a \"unique place\" (I've had several friends recommend it to me), I struggled to find its novelty. \n\nIn terms of service, our server was pleasant and attentive. In fact, it was her who brought me the chickpeas and water at the beginning of this review. Overall, my visit to Nopalito had its pros and cons. The solid service and attention to detail enhanced my experience with mostly pedestrian food. I saw other items on their menu that look delicious so I am willing to visit again another time.", "author": "James Z."}

Overall the place is fantastic, but I guess because I'm an Oaklander I have a hard time seeing it as \"all that\" in the context of Nido, Comal, and Cosecha--all closer to home with less of a too-cool-for-school vibe. Or Lolo for an equal competitor in that arena in SF.\n\nOur food was EXCELLENT, our service was uneven, and the front-of-house person could basically \"not be bothered,\" but it was 4 p.m. on a Saturday and who knows whether she'd been dealing with \"New San Francisco\" DBs all day long, so I can cut her some slack.\n\nI will say--what's the point of advertising that you can call ahead for a wait list add when they don't add you?! Just take reservations or abandon that option if it's really not an option--or rather, an optional option if the person who answered the phone felt like or had time to walk over to write down your name.\n\nMy honey and I shared yummy vegetarian plates and walked away stuffed and satisfied. No question this is A+ food. Our issues were never being asked by our server how anything was and having things doled out one at a time. We couldn't have our tamale until our salad was gone, etc. Odd. And if our server had bothered to ask we could have told him this or that our cocktails were yucky.\n\nThey need to better call out what is mezcal. Those of us not versed in that vs. tequila can spend a lot of $ on SMOKE SMOKE SMOKE. My partner ordered the mezcal (unknowingly) version of a Bee's Knees, which I drank to save him from the smoke, and I ordered the Diablo, which he drank to save me from the boring. (Very watery and no ginger/cassis coming forward.) Both drinks very unbalanced.\n\nWe shared a seasonal salad with everything summer and wonderful--$11 for a large plate of little gems, avo, cuke, stone fruit, etc. etc. Perfect. We followed that with a small on size but BIG on richness and flavor tamale, and then ended with a fresh and amazing blue corn quesadilla with squash blossoms.

How could such a simple dish leave so many people flabbergasted? To this day, I still don't understand. For $16, you get a relatively heft portion of carnitas, cabbage salad, a few grilled veggies, and sauce. That's it. I'm not a fan of cabbage, so I pretty much had no side dish. Yes, they are marinated in orange, bay leaf, milk cinnamon and beer. Yes, they're tender, aromatic, and delicious. However, they're still just carnitas and are not worth $16. \n\nTo wash it all down, we got a pitcher of seasonal sangria. Our original choice was the exquisitely looking white wine sangria with frozen grapes, but they were out. It was very watered down and tasted too simple. I could easily make better with just a few ingredients. For $9 a glass, it's a rip off. \n\nService is very slow and you have to hunt down a waiter just to get water.

I had their potato tacos (can't remember the exact name), it came with crema, queso fresco and guac and it was surprisingly very crispy but I loved it. I also had a taste of their quesadillas, which were a little bit more average, but still good. My friends loved the carnitas dish.\n\n- Strong mojitos! \n\n- Nice ambiance with a cute sitting area, plus they do takeout too! \n\n(MINUS SIDE)\n\n- It's not a dog friendly place, which kind of sucks. But we still managed to get our puppy in, provided he be sitting under the table.\n\n- It's a bit over priced if you ask me. \n\nOverall a good experience, I will definitely come back for a late weekday lazy dinner to try their takeout.

Guess I made the mistake of thinking \"sustainable organic Mexican\" eats equals healthy eats (silly me).\n\nIf you call ahead to place your name on the wait list (no reservations) they don't start the timer until you arrive there in person (someone correct me if I'm wrong). Our wait time on a Friday night was over a hour (to be expected). We took this in stride and decided to sooth our hungry bellies with alcohol at a local bar. Thankfully they call/text you when your table is ready. Cute restaurant, friendly service, delicious margaritas- what's not to love?  \n\nMy entree- just awful (a three is being generous). I had the carnitas and thought it was a pretty piss poor rendition of carnitas. Flavorless and greasy with a cabbage salad that was equally as distasteful. The wrapper was actually dripping in grease- nasty... I took the leftover carnitas and used it to make a Chinese pork stir fry at home the next day, which tasted better than the original creation.

After pushing three times he went to ask and said he could only offer \"regular beans.\" I asked what they were and he couldn't tell me. I said 3 times they needed to be vegetarian. They came out in a broth that must have had meat, because I spent the rest of my night sick in my hotel room.\n\n$3.50 for a few spoonfuls of beans in water with no seasoning. Refused to provide black beans even though they are on the menu. I had to badger the server to ask if I could have some beans. No substitutions, just upcharge. \n\nIt took everything I had not to just stand up and walk out. I felt robbed of my time, my money, and the basic dignity one should expect as a paying customer. Restaurants are supposed to be part of the service industry!\n\nI promise you I waited to post this review. I waited to calm down.

We were not dressed fancy , we were in cold weather and we were just coming back from an entire day of sightseeing, so neither to say we didnt looked our best.\nWe encounter a very judgy hostess that gaves the stinkin eye and again told us to wait 40 minutes to 1 hours, even though there were 2 empty tables, we understood because maybe those reserved , but on the 1 hour we waited, bu the door, nobody was sitted there.\nThats when I started putting attntion  on the hostess behavior, to the white people ( i dont want to sound racist , just stating the facts) dress in fancy clothes , she was treating them so nicely and inviting them to wait in the bar, I understand we needed to wait ouside because of my little dog, but then 2 ladies arrived  one was an african american, the hostess blocked the entrance and told them that they had to wait 45minutes to an hour, she didnt invite them to wait in the bar (they didnt have a dog like us) and she didnt let the african american lady to even open the door!

We didn't have to wait long for a table. Split a bottle of sangria which was standard. Probably better split amongst a party of 4. The table split an order of the queso which was legitimate melted cheese (not the plasticy sauce you get on your nachos at Taco Bell). It's rather embarrassing to admit, but I think I actually prefer the chemical-y queso. \n\nI ordered the fish tacos, what was basically a chicken tostada but had a fancier name, and a side of rice. I usually like my fish tacos fried, but these were grilled and still very flavorful. The chicken tostada was super well seasoned. And I'm incredibly picky about my Mexican rice, and I had zero complaints about Nopalito's. So good. Everyone at the table enjoyed their food. \n\nAs for the servers, some were fine, but others seemed to have a negative attitude I didn't really appreciate. When we asked for something, we were met with a look of irritation. The service itself was spotty. They always dropped by the table when we didn't need them, and then never seemed to be around when we were looking for them. The thing that irritated me most was we were getting ready to leave, and the hostess rather rudely came over and asked us to move to the bar. Our dinner was rather extended by the 10 minutes it took for someone to come back for our bill (we eventually had to flag someone down).

I guess once sign was when the waiter was like, are you sure you want to order off of this?\n\nOrdered the totopos con chile, a quesadilla, ceviche, mole, carnitas, and drinks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-01-26", "description": "Overrated. 2 stars for effort. This place has good intentions, but I felt like the food was lacking. \nFirst off, this place is always packed! This was my second attempt at eating here and the only reason why we ended up getting a table was because we called ahead. Because of the demand to eat here I believe our waitress got a little annoyed with us. We came in between lunch and dinner and the person who sat us gave us both menus. Naturally, we had to look over both menus (they gave a party of 4, 2 lunch and 2 dinner menus) and couldn't decide what we wanted. She came to the table 3 times and, we believe, since we still hadn't decided her attitude changed with us. I knew it wasn't just me that felt this change since someone in my party mentioned it just as I was thinking it. In addition, this place is soo small, you're constantly seeing the greeter walk up and down the aisle to see who is getting their check(s) so they can tell people in line how much longer of a wait. It makes you feel like you're not welcome because in you're head you know they want you to leave so they can seat someone else.  \n  \nNow to the food. 3 different dishes; fish tacos, carne asada, & huarache w/chorizo all tasted like Al Pastor when the only one that should have were the tacos. The ceviche was lacking flavor and a bit on the fishy side. We tried 3 different alcoholic drinks and they were not good, the flavors didn't mix well and my Bloody Maria tasted like liquid smoke. My favorite dishes were the Topos, (crispy tortillas in a spicy sauce with fresh grated cheese and sour cream for dip) and the hurache (the tortilla was filled with beans) the chorizo and beef went really well together. The flan was authentic and good as well. \n\nNow I don't think it's always like this but worth mentioning, the plates ordered that were more 'dinner plates', not sharing plates, took about an hour to come out. We had to ask our waitress what the hold up was to which the answer was that the take out window was slammed. She made up for it by giving us complimentary flan which was appreciated, but a simple update would have been cool.", "author": "Selina K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-11-11", "description": "Nopalito serves the white hipster man's version of Mexican food and it's still unexciting if you accept it for what it is. The restaurant itself is cute but, then again, it looks like you're dining in at a Whole Foods. They don't take reservations, but you can call ahead two hours in advance to put your name on the waiting list. Still, I'm not sure this actually does you any good. We called ahead and still had to wait for roughly thirty minutes once we arrived for a table, which would have been fine if there was anywhere suitable to wait. We basically shuffled around the bar area for thirty minutes trying to get out of the way of the wait staff while inadvertently getting in the way of other members of the wait staff. It was the least fun game of Frogger I've ever played.\n\nThe food was fine, but I can't envision myself ever getting a random hankering for the grub at Nopalito. I got the Quesadilla Roja con Chicharr\u00f3n. It was interesting. I liked that the tortilla was crispy. The \"crispy pork belly\" inside the quesadilla is just their way of describing what are effectively pork rinds, which were a little bit too hard for me; there were a few moments when I thought I had bitten down onto bones. No bueno for Estephania. For drinks, I ordered a Margarita and a Killer Bee. The Margarita was just your standard margarita; nothing special to report. The Killer Bee tasted like gasoline. BUT, two of my friends also ordered the Killer Bee and seemed to enjoy it, so perhaps I am the anomaly here. Yet they both chose a different beverage for their second drink, so I'm inclined to believe that they were too shy to admit that it just was not very tasty.\n\nOur server was nice, but I'm pretty sure he was as high as you can rightfully expect a San Franciscan to be. He fudged our bill a tad, but he was quick to right his wrong, so no complaints about that tiny snafu.\n\nOverall, Nopalito wasn't special. I can't imagine that I will ever recommend it to others but I also wouldn't say no if I was with people who wanted to try it out.", "author": "Stephenie S."}

My favorite was the totopos con chile which is basically chips doused with a mildly spicy salsa de arbol and other stuff. It got pretty soggy pretty quickly though. My least favorite was the tamal which was disappointing. It had chocolate in it which sounds strange, but sounded interesting at the same time. I made my friend eat it after I took a few bites.

This is Mexican food straight from the interior of Mexico, with a bit of a creative spin on it. They have these nachos that are covered in a two chili sauce, covered with white cheese, served with a side of crema that was absolutely incredible. You get a small dish of roasted beans that are like peanuts, with a hint of spiciness. \nI got the pulled pork torta, a Mexican sandwich served on a french loaf. It was spicy, but was countered with cole slaw, which was beyond amazing. I scarfed it down. \nOur server was from Texas, and was quite nice, helpful and friendly. She made recommendations that everyone loved. My dining companions both opted for the ceviche, which looked simply amazing. I was a bit disappointed that they didn't serve the ceviche in the tall glass like I'm used to. They serve it in a bowl, which is not very traditional. \nApparently, this place was featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. It wasn't any of those places. I wouldn't call it a dive or a diner. It was a really nice restaurant. \nThey serve up palettas, the Mexican version of a popsicle. I had the Mexican chocolate one, that took me back to my time Oaxaca.

The chips in the chilaquiles were still crispy and had great flavor. I especially loved their house margarita. It was not overly sweet and you could taste and appreciate the tequila. If you are going to have a margarita, I suggest ordering a pitcher. It's a better deal for two people who would like two drinks each. The restaurant is also kid friendly.

Carnitas is on the 7x7 at least twice, I believe, and the carnitas at Nopalito is nothing like any carnitas taco I've ever had.

I really wanted to eat it by itself.\n\nThe ceviche was OK.  Marinated rock cod and squid sat in what seemed like the same salsa verde that came with the carnitas.  Half of an avocado sat on top.  I love squid, but the slimy legs eventually got to me and I had to make the BF eat all the legs.\n\nI tried their white peach/blueberry organic and house made popsicle.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-08-04", "description": "So, honestly, it wasn't good. Wouldn't go back and can't really understand all the positive reviews, nor could I recommend it.\n\nThe first thing is that the menu specifically says 'traditional' mexican cuisine. It was definitely NOT traditional. Maybe fusion, or modern, but there was nothing traditional about it. So much false advertising. \n\nHonestly though, the biggest issue i had was that it just wasn't good food.\n\nFirst of all we got Micheladas, which I love and could drink daily, and Nopalito managed to serve me a michelada that was nearly undrinkable. When we ordered it we were told/warned by the waitress that they make it 'hot and smoky', and when I tried to order my beer to go with the michelada I was told that it is 'specially formulated for Tecate'. Hmm. I feel like at that point we should have just left and gone to look for food elsewhere... Anyway, back to the Michelada. 1. A michelada is a mixture that you add beer to, I have NEVER seen it anywhere with a prescribed beer, and 2. Tecate?? That's a bit like saying 'we've specially formulated this drink for PBR.' It's something so pretentiously hipsterish that I was a bit dumbfounded.\n\nThe drinks came and they were clear, orange colored cocktails-like drinks. I kid you not. I wish I had taken photos. Basically it was watered beer with smoked-peanut flavor. No hint of lime, no hint of salt or pepper, no hint of spice or tabasco, of clamato, tamarind - anything. Just bitter smoke flavour. I then asked for some more tomato juice, hoping to 'michelada-up' my drink a bit. The server said she 'didn't know if they had any' - which made me feel like a 'gotcha moment; it must in fact be a pre-made mixture if they don't even have the tomato juice... I was actually pretty embarrased to have a friend there who hadn't had a michelada before and tried it on our recommendation - I kept wanting to insist that 'that's not what it's supposed to taste like!!!'\n\nAnyway, off on such a great start and sadly that's the level it stayed at. We had the ceviche,nthe panucho de pollo, and the enchiladas de mole con pollo. The ceviche was ok but somehow lacked all acidity (I have no idea how ceviche could be bland, but they sure managed!). The panucho was the best of the lot, with nicely crunchy slaw and onions. The mole, again, was really not great. It was kind of bland/bitter at the same time, like it lacked salt and then something else, and had the same peanut-smoky flavour as the micheladas. \n\nThis restaurant came so highly recommended that i'm really surprised, both by the yelp reviews as well as by the bride of the wedding we were attending. I was having a 'maybe I don't get it moment' but then I remembered the micheladas and yeah, I get it, and no, it wasn't good.\n\nOh - and I nearly managed to forget - the bathroom situation. I just wanted to write the words 'to add insult to injury' about this but then I remembered - in my case, since I'm on crutches and have trouble walking, that's EXACTLY what it was. They have one (1!!) bathroom for the whole restaurant and takeout customers, that you actually have to go outside the restaurant and walk all around on the sidewalk and then in another door to the take-out foyer to go. I also had to wait on the sidewalk, so awkward.", "author": "Marie Q."}

She ordered 4 items, but out of the 4, I really enjoyed the Totopos con chile and the Carnitas (pork belly).\n\nThe totopos con chile - So simple, yet so addicting. Just go ahead and take a chip flavored in a delicious tomato sauce (I could be wrong but that was what my tastebuds were telling me) and dip it into the sour cream! Phenomenal! I could eat it for days.\n\nCarnitas - THAT DELICIOUS, SOFT, FATTY PORK BELLY was soooooo good. The pork belly was moist and tender and it went great with my White Sangria. Definitely could've just had this all night with the tortillas.\n\nWhat a great place to enjoy gluten-free (HOW MANY AFFORDABLE RESTAURANTS HAVE GLUTEN-FREE FOODS?!) \"authentic\" mexican food. Just wish the server would at least smile when she talks to us. It sounds like she hates her life...", "author": "Betty P."}

I ordered two different tequila drinks (El Diablo and Blanco Rojo) and both could have passed for alcoholic pink lemonade.  \n\nThe appetizer (Black bean stuffed tortilla, citrus-achiote chicken, cabbage, \npickled red onion and salsa habanera) was pretty meh as the chicken was dry and lacked any real flavor.  My girlfriend actually questioned if they used any salt in preparing it.\n\nFor the entrees, mine came out first and it took another 25 minutes for my girlfriend's to arrive - not exaggerating.  They assumed we were sharing because I had ordered them both for us, but I did not specify that.  Even if I did, no excuse for the second dish to come out a day later.  When her Carne Asada finally arrived, half of it was cold. \n\nI'm not a hard guy to please when it comes to food, especially Mexican, but this place is simply not worth the long wait.

We opted for the Chocolate/Cinnamon popsicle as it sounded the most appealing. It's literally a popsicle shoved into a plastic casing. It looks like something you could buy at the grocery store.

The ceviche is also quite good quality. There never seems to be a shortage of chips as i have experienced in some other places.  Generally, I've had very issues with the quality or pricing of the food.  Portions are pretty generous for a tapas place.  I do find that making a full meal out of it ends up with a lot of heavy/fried items.\n\nThe ATMOSPHERE:  This Nopalito I don't like as much as the other one.  It feels more cramped and the noise level is getting a little tough for conversation.  The patio at the other location is much more pleasant.\n\nThe SERVICE: Generally good, but never outstanding.

The entrance was a bit confusing with the take out entrance where I think the real entrance of the restaurant should be. Once I walked in there was no hostess to greet us and I had to walk further into the restaurant which was a very awkward spot to have someone finally greet us and had us wait for a bit. \nWe came here for a late lunch at around 4:30PM and got seated right away. The hostess who had seated us and gave each of us a menu. I knew what I wanted right away-the torta which was on the lunch menu that the hostess had provided me with. At 4:50pm not the server, but the hostess came by our table and literally took the menu out of my hand saying, \"Let me just switch that for you.\" It took me a moment to realize that he had switched the menu from the lunch menu to the dinner menu because he didn't mention it as he took it away. At 4:55pm our server finally appeared and when I told her I wanted the torta she said they stop serving it at 5pm because that's when they switch over to the dinner menu. It was obviously not 5:00PM and even so I was very disappointed with their service in how they first gave me the lunch menu and didn't take my order for another 15 minutes or so and when the server finally came I wasn't even able to order it. I was pretty upset at the service but I wasn't rude to the server however she purposely took her time serving us because the table next to us who got seated at least half an hour after us ordered the same thing as us but got their food and devoured them even before we got our appetizer. We also sat near the bar where theres a giant curtain for the lighting above the kitchen and I almost threw up looking at it because there was a whole colony of flies flying around in it. \nSometimes even if the service sucks if the food is good they are sometimes forgivable but the food wasn't even that great and lacks a wow factor.

The original passage to the bathroom was blocked to create this takeout counter. The funny thing is that while we (to go order customers) get easy bathroom access, regular patrons have to leave the restaurant, go outside and walk around into the takeout area (and get wet, when it rains) to use that bathroom.\n\nI was in the neighborhood on Friday, so I parked at this plaza building to buy drinks and something to eat from Falletti/Delessio. I soon changed my plans when I saw the takeout counter and placed my order.\n\nAlso, if u have a long wait at the DMV, or if the waiting list for the restaurant is too long, perhaps consider ordering takeout here. It's a quick alternative and u probably will get food faster than dining inside. The menu is identical so u won't miss much other than the waiter service.\n\nService at the takeout counter was fast and VERY friendly, most orders are ready within 10-15 minutes. Having a restroom is a nice bonus (note that there's no paper towels inside. They use a \"jet powered\" hand dryer instead, same as the one at Dosa Fillmore).\n\nNopalito's menu is more expensive ($4.50-$15) than most Mexican restaurants and yes, u could find a few similar menu items elsewhere for less. But the food quality (organic) and preparation are top notch, and it saves u the trouble of going to multiple hole-in-the-wall places to find what u can get here in one place.\n\nSome of my food pics:\n- Taquitos with guacamole and crema dipping sauces (it's really just 2 flautas cut in half) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nopalito-san-francisco?select=A-lTHcVFMO7eyZ43sGuPHg#A-lTHcVFMO7eyZ43sGuPHg\n- Lengua taco - u need a fork and knife to eat this version (my favorite item) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nopalito-san-francisco?select=JxmtM02RVIn6P6z5HvUMsQ#JxmtM02RVIn6P6z5HvUMsQ\n- Tamal filled with stewed pork (it's okay) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nopalito-san-francisco?select=hE_CozglOewccPw-UaavOQ#hE_CozglOewccPw-UaavOQ\n- Complimentary Mexican wedding cookies http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/nopalito-san-francisco?select=Mu7zfBIADxTectc9xzWcXA#nITyr1hFdTV-wH_QPztnHA", "author": "Luis C."}

I prefer the inner sunset location because it's not as hard to get into.  \n\nThe food is always fresh and clean with bright flavors.  The portions are a perfect size (as opposed to tex-mex style portions) where you won't leave feeling too hungry or too stuffed.  I've had nearly everything on the menu and my favorites are the fish tacos and the trout.  As someone who doesn't particularly care for mole, Nopalito's mole is delicious (it almost tastes like a barbecue sauce).  The tamales are also very light and fluffy.  The blue bottle coffee is at it's best here, although they don't offer non-dairy alternatives.  At the end of every meal, they serve these complimentary tasty little alfajores (nut flour cookies).  \n\nService is always great.  They must treat their employees well because the staff always seems unusually happy.  The atmosphere is welcoming and the prices are good, particularly for the caliber of the food.

It was like a great Mexican pot roast: the meat melted in my mouth. The broth rich and spicy but not overwhelmingly spicy. My friend had the fish tacos: fresh fish marinated in ancho chiles adobo and grilled to perfection, and served with fresh tomatillo salsa. The place was packed, and we were lucky to be seated quickly. (Though we got there at 5:30 pm). \nThis was traditional Mexican cuisine (more like Yucatan).

Screw that.\n\nIt's tasty  healthy Mexican food in large portions at an affordable price.  \n\n* Free parking, always a spot available.  In San Francisco that's rare.\n\n* It's all homemade from scratch.   They make their own salsas.  If it's on a bun, they baked the bun.  If there's corn in a dish they shucked the kernels.\n\n* Professionalism.  The servers here know the menu, they treat you right, and they seriously know what they're doing.  They can help you deal with a difficult child or recite the philosophy, ingredients, and sources behind a dish.  That's a level you might expect at $25-50 a plate, but a complete surprise under $10.\n\n* Dog friendly.  Many places say it, but Nopalito is one of the only places you can bring a dog, dine under the awning, get some respect, and all that.\n\n* Quality.  The food here is very tasty, clever, and all around amazing if traditional in conception, execution, etc.\n\nIt's delicious food to be sure. But the only reason I'm taking it down to 4 stars instead of 5 is that it's, well, it holds back a little. It doesn't give and give. There's a seriousness about it. That's just me I guess.\n\nThe homemade chilada (beer + chile fruit and spices) almost makes it all worth it.", "author": "Gil S."}

I staggered out of the cafe like a three legged turtle into the savagely benevolent streets of San Francisco. I stopped a man whom sported a beard of which I'm fairly certain was grown intentionally, and question him on the whereabouts of his favorite restaurant. Unindignantly he didn't shout, \"Nopalito\". Before I could react he draws his fist, jabs a finger at what I only assumed to be a drug dispensary, and unimpolitely delivers, \"That's Nopalito.\". I told him thanks and slid him a business card I had received earlier from a tax attorney.\n\nWhen I arrived at Nopalito's I was set upon by the maitre d. Recalling the training I received in yoga class I found my intention and was able to communicate it. The place was jumping and I got the sense that I should stop talking to myself. To slip into something a little more destructive I'd been eyeing mezcals when the man whom I knew knew I knew nothing approached. I asked the man who the prime suspects were in a good experience. With the confidence of an avocado in a CA market he replied \"The fish tacos are great and the Totopos Con Chile is an experience.\". I told him what he could do with his suggestions and shortly after the fish tacos and totopos con chile were in route to my table. \n\nI approached the totopos con chile as a cockeyed optimist; snatched up a chip and gave it what for. It responded in kind with a bland yet substantial sock in the mouth. What it lacked in personality it made up for in character. I generally observe the principle \"never leave your enemies alive\" but the chips in this dish are forged and folded. I offered a truths with the totopos and diverted my attention to the fish tacos which were descended upon as if they were cats in an Alf orgy. I'd never before had swordfish in a taco, and I will kill the next man who serves me a taco without it! \n\nFinal thoughts: the food here is only slightly beat out by it's value and service staff. If you find yourself in the area this is well worth checking out, and don't allow them forget the complimentary almond butter cookie at the end....\n\n-Final Boss.", "author": "Erik G."}

The dishes were pretty hit or miss. The 3 of us ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees to share. My favorites were the Ceviche Verde which came with cod and calamari and the Enchiladas de Mole con Pollo. The best part of the enchilada was the mole sauce that it was served with. Totopos con Chile were given to us on the house. They were like glorified tortilla chips. Glad there were for free because I wouldn't have paid money for them.  I was also a bit disappointed with the Panucho de Pollo al Pibel which was a tortilla stuffed with black beans served with chicken and cabbage on top.  The chicken was dry and the tortilla was too crispy and fried.  The Carnitas was also just okay. The 6 oz chunk of pork was super fatty and was braised a little too long. \n\nThe drinks were super exciting. The table across from ours ordered a few white wine sangrias. They looked so delicious I hunted our waiter down to order one. The sangrias came with persimmon and pomegranate and tasted like juice. DANGEROUS!  \n\nOverall the meal was pleasant. The service was friendly and the food was pretty good. One minus of the place was that you had to leave the restaurant to use the bathroom which was over on the other side of the take-out counter. I thought about hopping over the take-out counter so I could avoid walking outside.\n\n4 plates (2 entrees + 2 apps), 2 beers and 1 sangria turned out to be about $70 for three people.

While we didn't want to pull the race card, we both couldn't understand when she passed us up although we were clearly in front of them.\n\nAt any rate, the food was awesome. Such a new twist on mexican food. We started with the special which was a ceviche to start. It was fresh and light along with cool presentation.  Next to the empanadas that had chunky flavorful beef topped with goodness. The surprise of the night was the chicken enchiladas that had no chicken inside but on the side. We loved the potatoes and the chicken was moist and crispy on the outside. Good job just tell your hostess to be cautious of who's in line. Xoxo", "author": "Jennifer H."}

Quesadilla de Primavera\n2. Carne Asada con Chorizo y Papas\n3. Birria de Borrego\n4. Ceviche Verde de Pescado\n\neverything was really good especially the Birria de Borrego (lamb). The ceviche was the BOMB but i wish the portions was slight bigger. \n\nall the plates were small portions or maybe its just smaller cause we got take out?\n\nfor those who want to dine in -- the restaurant is very small and you have to walk outside by the takeout menu to go to the bathroom which i think its SUPER weird because the waiting space is very SMALL. its like a small box especially if you are waiting in for the bathroom and there are two people waiting for their take out. :P \n\ni will definitely try to come back again. or maybe order takeout. would love to try their soup. i cant wait for their 9th ave location!", "author": "Carol Y."}

My fav was their hibiscus/orange drink and their version of a Mexican (spicy) bloody mary. Their ceviche is one of the best that I've had- must try, so are the carnets that my husband swears by.

That is like a whole other meal cycle for me and my 'hanger' would have spilled over by that stage.\n\nI just think so many problems could be solved by taking reservations for at least part of the restaurant. I guess they have no problems filling tables, but it just shouldnt be such an effort to eat here. \n\nThe food is good - the highlight is definitely the first item on the menu, the chips and salsa. Seriously, its good enough to get me back there. I am picky with food (not overly qualified, just picky) and I find the rest to be a bit hit and miss. We had an item not delivered but charged (they did fix when we asked). The first time we came here the server was memorable and fun, this time the server didnt really care for eye contact or conversation. \n\nI'll likely be back, but some of the shine has fallen from my first visit here.", "author": "Mitchell S."}

The huarache was unique because it was layered with sour cream, meats and sauce.  The huarache is a thick corn tortilla.  The combination of sauces and meat was amazing.

I was greeted with a smile and kindness by a lady that was standing in the front.\n\nThe light was low which created a romantic setting. Everyone spoke with a low voice which made me feel I had to be cautious of my voice (I'm a loud talker. hehee).\n\nOur waiter was even worse! His voice was very low and he was very tall. I got tired of trying to hear what he was saying so I just guessed and did my best to read his lips when he asked us questions.\n\nHe came out with these tiny (but cute) folded menus. When I opened it up I realize it was all in spanish. Traditional spanish I think (or was it italian). So I ended up reading the fine print under the name of the entrees. I tried ordering my usual drink, but they didn't have it. Our waiter tells us that the only alcoholic drink (beside beer) are the ones they have on the menu. I looked, chuckled and said, \"I can't read anything.\" (LOL) I spotted the word \"bloody maria\" which I assume it was a bloody mary so I ordered that instead.\n\nAs for my entree I ordered the \"mole poblano con pollo\". Soon after we placed our order our food came out. When my dish came out, half of the dish was filled with red rice and the other chicken topped by some sort of chocolate sauce. It was deceiving to be honest. It didn't look delicious at all. But luckily that I love food so I ate it anyways.\n\nI had a fork full of rice, it tasted like any red mexican rice would taste. Then I cut a slice of chicken. It was tender but a dry. The sauce however, was surprisingly good. So the next half our all I did was listen to my friend talk while I chow down on my chicken.\n\nThe service was excellent and prompt. The company was pleasant. The location was quiet.

This time we went for lunch on a Saturday and didn't have to call in at all. We were seated promptly and the food was delicious again!\n\n In fact, our last visit left us confident about their ability to consistently deliver good food and so satisfied with every dish that we didn't order what we had previously tried. Usually, my husband will go with a safe choice and I will order something new to try. This way we know that we can discover something new without too much risk since we share both dishes. This strategy is not necessary at Nopalito!\n\nThe two new dishes for us this time were no disappointment at all. Indeed, one of them, the Chilaquiles Rojos en Cazuela, are now our new favorite! It's really flavorful and the spiciest we have tasted so far. I ordered the Caldo Tlalpe\u00f1o con Pollo which was a good chicken soup. I probably wouldn't order it again here since they have so many other delicious things, but I wouldn't advise anyone against ordering it either. Since it was warm outside we decided to give their popsicles a try. I had the dark chocolate and cinnamon and my husband had the milk and rice flavor. Both were delicious. \n\nI also want to mention that the prices this restaurant charges are very reasonable. I am so happy that they use organic ingredients. We ourselves cook mostly with organic ingredients and don't like eating out too much because there are hardly any restaurants that provide an organic alternative. So, Napolito is a rarity and welcome addition to our routine. The result has been our thinking about picking up take-out often and I am sure one of these days we will be in line at their take-out counter.", "author": "Emma E."}

The guac can be a little better and I wish they were a little more generous on the amount of guac that we got as well. The quesadilla was tasty but too greasy. The quesadilla is deep fried y'all so be careful. The totopos was amazing. It's very basic but the flavors are on point. Mucho sabor! We also got the empanada which was also deep fried. -_- I wish my food would stop taking a bath in oil. It's not very healthy. Haha.

They stand there in the line, holding \"it\" and the door open (or keeping it closed (depending on which side of THAT political spectrum you fall on)), and just talk their fucking asses off about the sitch they find their asses in, moments before said asses mount porcelain.

The host maintains a list of names and will even ring you on your cell phone when your turn comes, should you decide to wait in a nearby bar.  \n\nUpon entering, diners can choose between a covered \"outdoor\" area (like a sun room with heat lamps), a few indoor tables, or a bar overlooking the prep area/kitchen.  The bar is where the action is:  you will be treated to watching the fresh tortillas being made by hand, the organic vegetables being skillfully chopped, and the components of each dish being arranged just so.\n\nOnce seated, diners are treated to complimentary dried spiced garbanzo beans, which cry out for a margarita to wash them down.  The menu is divided into small plates sized for one person and larger paltes perfect for sharing.\n\nPiquant and tasty, the panucho de pollo al pibil ($4.50) features citrus-achiote chicken on tortilla stuffed with black beans, cabbage, pickled red onion, and salsa habanera.  With fresh rock cod and calamari, the ceviche verde de pescado y calamare ($10.00) combines lime, tomatillo, jalape\u00f1o, cilantro, and avocado into a light, citrusy treat.  While the sesame seeds were a little our of place, the mole poblano con pollo ($14.00) was still quite delicious with a rich, dark sauce of toasted chiles, chocolate, cinnamon, nuts, and onions served over a seared chicken breast on a bed of rice.\n\nMostly attentive and friendly, the waitstaff was also very knowledgeable about the dishes and ingredients.

Yessss!\n\nThis time around it calls for the carnitas as a \"serious\" must try. It's so serious that it made it on their list of 100-places-to-try-before-you-die type of serious.  \n\nBlame the seriousness on the Triple T's:\n\n*Tender: The carnitas were delicately and deliciously tender. You can tell that it's been slow roasted and marinated in its own juices. Cutting through it w/ a knife was effortless & the meat just fell right through. Each bite was perfect, juicy, and had that right amount of fat to it. Certainly not a dish to indulge in on the daily, but something you can easily reward yourself w/ after a great workout or heck, just to have. (Thanks for the recommendation, 7x7!)\n\n*Tequila- Ohhhhhh, the tequila. I tried the mezcal de oaxaca, which is basically an unfiltered tequila. I opted for the del maguey tobala- which is the most fruitful & luscious of their list. It sounded like a mouthful so I just had to try it. Unlike other tequila, you had to \"sip\" it rather than \"shoot it\". Really, sip tequila? \n\n*Terrific- terrific food, terrific service, terrific ambiance, and just plain terrific.\n\nBottom line: I was very impressed with the carnitas. They were delicious and I will definitely come back here for it.\n\nAn additional T, for Tips:\n*The restaurant tends to get crowded. You can call ahead to put your name on the wait list.\n*There is both indoor/outdoor seating available.\n*Use the bathroom inside the grocery store next door, in case the restaurant's single bathroom is occupied.

I am a sucker for good taste, but I also prefer to eat healthy whenever possible. Is that too much to ask? So when it comes to something super savory like carnitas, I'm aware that the pork shoulder is one of the fattiest cuts of meat you can eat, and that the typical preparation of carnitas is to fry it before it is served, which adds flavor but more oil and fat as well. I've gone so far as to call all of my favorite Mexican restaurants ahead of time to ask them how they prepare their carnitas before deciding whether or not to order it or the grilled chicken there. So when I called Nopalito to ask them how they prepare their carnitas I was pleasantly surprised to learn that they braise it a citrus marinade for 8 hours which slowly tenderizes the meat and locks the flavors in. The pork they serve is not organic, but it's all natural and hormone and antibiotic free. Once the dish was in front of me, it also helps to notice that they wrap the serving in paper which further absorbs the grease. The carnitas goes super well with the green tomatillo sauce, I ended up doubling up on the sauce as it's fresh tasting and not overly spicy. One thing I think would be nice if it you could order a side of guacamole or avocado with the dish that would also be another nice complement, otherwise the corn tortillas are served nice and warm. \n\nOne note: This place gets super busy at dinner time and it's highly recommended to call beforehand and put your name on the list since they don't take reservations. It helps a lot that they have parking because the Nopa area is notorious for not having any street parking. I've also come back for lunch before when it's not as busy and fun to sit in the sun room, and also have called ahead for take out when I just want a simple meal to bring back home.", "author": "Mark Y."}

And this is very important when a restaurant does not take reservations, because you have no choice than to go through her to get seated. \n\nShe completely miscalculated our wait-time, told us the wait will be 45 minutes but it took one and a half hours. Eventually offered us a small communal table, and said we would have to wait another hour to get our own table. \n\nShe was also very unprofessional, kept looking at her ipad when people spoke with her, did not apologize about the wrong estimation of our wait-time, put people on hold on the phone indefinitely, gave fake smiles and robotic answers instead of communicating respectfully.\n\nOverall, her attitude was something in between that of a club bouncer and the cranky assistant at your doctor's office.

Then after looking again when we showed her the text confirming our call to the correct location, she found our name and said it was another 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, she said it was another 20 minutes.  \n\nFinally we were seated after an hour and a half wait and ordered carnitas (very delicious), the corn dish (tasted just like canned corn with some unmelted cheese-- no one liked this dish), the empanada (the shell was dry and tasteless) and some other appetizers that were not memorable.   Except for the carnitas, nothing tasted that good. Boring at best.  It was extremely loud and crowded and NOT a relaxed nor enjoyable experience for an end-of-the-week dinner. My friend noted we had to shout at each other the entire time to be heard and tables are communal and packed really close. The server was nice and pleasant, though.\n\nParking was $10.

Kind of like chilaquiles but w/o the eggs; I love that just softened but still crispy in the middle thick tortilla chip bite.  Good balanced flavors.\n\nFor my entree, I had the chicken mole enchiladas.  This version is just a touch sweeter than I expected it to be, but I could tell that the chef(s) but hours of love into that mole.  The chicken was tender and flavorful as well. No complaints.\n\nThe pozole, however, was a disappointment.  The broth really lacked depth and needed something to boost its yummy factor.  I didn't get a sense that the broth was made from slow-simmering veggies and protein for several hours; rather, it tasted like it was made in the last half hour.\n\nThe next time I went, I knew I had to try the carnitas.  Oh man, am I happy I did.  You see, I love pork.  If I had to pick one protein to eat the rest of my life, I would pick pork in all its glorious forms, carnitas being one of them.  This had great natural pork flavor and the crispy outside with just enough fattiness still remaining.  I could eat it for days.  It also doesn't look like a lot but it's plenty of food, which is great.\n\nThe pozole was a miss when I first went, but the other dishes I tried were great.

Zion after spending most of the day waiting for my spouse to get out of surgery, so my hope was to have a drink, a couple of courses, read for awhile, and decompress. As they say, the best laid plans of mice and men....Anyway, I arrived at 4PM to a mostly empty place. Someone shouted from the bar to \"sit anywhere,\" and as I was just about to sit at a large table (the only place that didn't have direct sun) the waitron informed me that I was sitting at a group table that I would have to share if someone demanded to sit there, Um, it was 4PM and the place was empty. Oh yeah, and \"hello\" to you, too. I ordered a margarita--which was a good drink--and the manager actually came over and closed some of the window shades, which was helpful and nice.\n\nBut the waitperson was not warm or professional--what an attitude!  I ordered the appetizer fish taco ($5) which is a 2-3 oz piece of fish. It was okay--the texture was good, but not a lot of flavor. The tortilla was chewy in not a good way. Two bites into my app, my entree arrived. When I noted the timing, the waitperson sighed deeply and said, \"I guess I can keep it in the oven for you.\" Blech. I was not happy, but frankly didn't trust her to take my food out of my sight. They certainly were not going to refire the dish. So the two chips in 3 oz of refried beans and the two enchiladas sat for about 4 minutes while I finished my app. Not much queso on the enchilada and the mole was sweet--very, very sweet and not a lot of depth of flavor. This tortilla was even chewier. On my third bite,  I bit into a big chicken bone. How did they miss that? \n\nI called the manager over, who couldn't have been more understanding--and she did the right thing with regards to the bill.  I was going to chalk it up to weird timing and a bad day in the kitchen. I don't think the waitperson is trainable (I literally grew up in a restaurant and have known waitresses all my life). As I was leaving the waitperson said, in a sarcastic voice, \"have a really great rest of your day.\" Ew.  Avoid this place.

Who do I ask when I need something, when we were \"helped\" by no less than four people?!? \n\nWith that being said, I came to eat not worry about establishing a close relationship with my server.... The \"crispy pork belly\" quesadilla- sounds good in theory but the execution is poor at best. It's not crispy pork belly! It's basically a shredded pork quesadilla with half ass \"chicharones\" that weren't even as good as pork rinds out of the bag! Furthermore, what's up with the greasy, seemingly fried tortilla? I will say my lady's torta was pretty damn good, and the carnitas plate looks bomb! Lastly, your michelada tastes like hickory smoke... not sure if that's what your going for but it left me highly bummed :(\n\nBottom Line- Get your service in check ASAP!

Didn't see many reviews on it but decided to try it since I love seafood stews. This was really great - the flavor was not too sour, the seafood was fresh (the white fish was fantastic!), mixed very well with the rice at the bottom, and just went down great on a cold night. Would come back and get this again!\n\n-Carnitas - having not read the review but going by my friend's recommendation, I was quite surprised to see two larges pieces of pork sitting in a paper tray. I was expecting something more shredded and covered in sauce like at my local taco joint. This was cooked very tenderly, lightly seasoned so you could taste the flavor of the meat, and overall was pretty great (especially for someone like me who usually doesn't enjoy pork). Eat it alone or put a little bit of the cabbage salad, jalapeno, and the sauce on it, roll it with the corn tortilla and it's a nice treat.

It really could have used \"something else\" to add another layer of flavor.\n\nThe quesadilla was a *true* quesadilla (one tortilla folded over) and not a sincronizada (what is usually served in U.S. restaurants as a quesadilla - two tortillas with stuff between them). Corn tortilla, zucchini, several cheeses, spices. Tasty, but  small for $9.50.\n\nCeviche. Really delicious. Lots of fresh seafood and overflowing with flavor.\n\nThe gazpacho was a surprise to me, because I didn't order it and I didn't read the description - I just heard somebody order \"the gazpacho\". I expect gazpacho to be a finely \"ground\" soup - instead it was small chunks of different sorts of summer melons, swimming in a liquid sweet/tart orange/lime \"dressing\", and queso fresco. The sweet melons were really complimented by the tart orange/lime dressing. A great, light, summer dish.\n\nThe fish taco was tasty. The orange slice gave it an extra 'zing'.\n\n\nThe place was packed and there was a waiting list when we left at 1:20.\n\nOverall food was really good. Normally I'd think it a little expensive for the portion sizes (the portions were smaller than I expected - except for the taco - just slightly larger than tapas portions) but maybe those are just SF prices, and I'm not used to them.

Oh and we also ordered some beers. \n\nSo this is what we had \n\n- Totopos con Chile, which are basically tortilla chips with grated cotija cheese and salso. Also comes with a side of cream..i think sour cream from what i can recall.\n\n-Ceviche Verde de Pescado y Calamari, a ceviche with cod, calamari, avocado, lime and i think tomatillo..which is like a green fruit of some sort..anyways this dish was not my favorite..no wows here\n\n-Quesadilla Roja con Chicharr\u00f3n, a tortilla with crispy pork belly, jack cheese and onions. This was very nice\n\n-Carnitas, tender braised pork with salsa and some other stuff, which I dont really remember. The only thing I remember is this pork, it was so tender and i got a nice fatty piece. God i love pork fat....wrapped that with the soft tortilla and the pickled jalapeno and cabbage..it was soo good.\n\nWe also ordered a couple other things which were not  too shabby like the Gordita Picadillo which is a fried corn tortilla with beef and salsa and beans. and these tacos..which i can't seem to remember what they were called...So, the Ceviche was a miss, but the Carnitas, man very delicious..\n\nOverall I thought this place was very good, not the best but very good.

But alas, they are that crummy. \nI'll write my most recent experience because that is much fresher in my memory: \n\nWe we under quoted by 25 minutes and did not get anything from the hostess other than Hi, for 2. She looked like a manager, and now that I reflect I can see that is why Nopalito is doing so horribly service wise. If management can't make you feel welcome at the door then there is no hope.\nWe didn't mind the communal seating arrangement. \n\nThe food arrived cold and over an hour after we had ordered it. The chefs in the kitchen seemed to be working their asses off so I'm uncertain as to the reason. Perhaps understaffed or poor server ordering. \nThe people we sat with communally had about the same wait time on their dishes and made comments about the hostess that failed to show any signs of being hospitable. \n\nOur server, Pia or Pria, only made an appearance to get our orders and bring the check. I tried without success to flag her down for more tortillas and to order a drink and was lucky another server was able to multi-task but not actually follow through with our requests.\n\nThe food was standard but I could get waay better food elsewhere for less money and it would come with a larger side of service. \n\nWe were asked at the end of our meal how the food was and when I told her it was cold when it arrived and we never got the tortillas we asked twice for she just smiled and said Oh goodness, I'm so sorry. \n\nI left the minimum tip hoping that the cooks get tip share because they were the only ones I could see actually completing tasks. \n\nGet more servers, or at least get ones that can do their job efficiently. \n\nOver priced Mexican food and unsatisfactory service topped with long unfriendly waits will make me never go back.", "author": "Karen M."}

Everything was pretty good. Not mind-blowing, but solid. We especially liked the orange salad -- just be sure you're okay with Mexican cheese, as the fruit is generously topped with it.\n\nThe carnitas is one of the celebrated dishes here, and we were both eager to try it. Maybe our expectations were a bit too high because we thought it was... good? The meat is very well-cooked and is served as two large chunks in a little brown wax paper wrapping (as pictured). Very juicy, VERY tender, but maybe a little under-flavored? Especially as the other trimmings -- cabbage, picked vegetables, and salsa verde -- aren't especially robust either, we felt the meat could have been a little more memorable.\n\nAs for the mole, I ended up eating most of it because it's a personal favorite, but I'd call it fair -- no better than a hole-in-the-wall place in terms of flavor. The chicken was evenly cooked though and, although on the verge of being too dry with the first bite, ended up being just about right. \n\nFor our drinks we had sangria and the \"Killer Bee\" cocktail, both of which were tasty.

Their sauces are scrumptious and they offer things you won't find at your local taqueria.  The menu is fairly limited.  I placed my order which was ready in under 10 minutes.  They tucked in some complimentary cookies in the takeout bag.  I don't mind paying extra for quality and something unusual plus they (staff) were very sweet (free cookies too).\n\n* Panucho pollo al pibil ($4.50):  This isn't a bad value because the bean stuffed blue corn tortilla is generously topped with shredded chicken in a slightly spicy sauce, crunchy pickled onions, finely shredded cabbage.  The corn tortilla was slightly crispy.  It was delicious.\n* Taco pescado ($4.75):  It wasn't horrible but I wasn't a fan - the orange segments were too sweet, the hunk of fish was firm and dry, there wasn't enough cabbage or cilantro.  I did like how it was slightly spicy.  With a different kind of fish, more cabbage and smaller pieces of orange, I could see it working.\n* Cookies: These were tiny almond cookies dusted lightly with powdered sugar.  They were very, very dry.  Definitely have these with tea or some other beverage.\n\nI also like the location - as you wait for your order, you can get a cup of Peet's, a scoop of Humphry Slocombe ice cream or a mini cupcake at Falletti's.", "author": "Lolia S."}

We all agreed and we were expecting for it to be a great restaurant with lots of great flavors. BUT WE WERE WRONG! Since we are of Mexican origin we practically know the real flavors of mexican food. And we were excited and looking foward to try  this place out. \n\n  The first thing we ordered as a group was the Totopos con Chile and I have to admit it was really good but nothing special. Then we all ordered separately, I ordered the Quesadilla Roja con Chicharr\u00f3n and I was expecting it to burst out in flavor but it was plain and nothing special. My brother and sister both ordered the Enchiladas de Mole con Pollo but asked for it to be in red sauce, by the time they both got their food they started eating and they did not like it because there only came two small enchiladas and the chicken was soggy and full of bones also they freaked out because there was sweet potato and they never ate sweet potato in a enchilada before, and there was also celery in it and they weren't expecting veggies in their enchiladas. My mom and dad both ordered the Empanada con Deshebrada de Res and they were not satisfied. My mom & dad were still hungry after that so they ordered the same thing i did and they found nothing special about either. They also ordered the Taquitos de Res and Gorditas de Chorizo and i can really say that after having eaten before in many different places in Mexico they only are about half as good as the real Mexican antojitos (snacks) because these types of food is what it really is, Mexican snacks that you can find all over Mexico and have a family of eight eat very well for a tenth of the price! \n\n  The waiters were very attentive but there was multiple waiters waiting our table (about 4 waiters). When we recieved our bill it also came with free cookies (those were good). OVERALL EXPERIENCE: Wouldn't reccomend to a friend, good service but plain food.", "author": "Jenna G."}

She got an empanada, which was made with a crunchier tortilla than average and pretty good sized. It was tasty enough.\n\nFor diner, I got a beef soup. The broth was thin, very spicy, and had hominy, which I liked. She  thought it tasted like it hadn't decided what it was doing. The beef was a giant, fatty hunk I had to cut with a knife. I was okay with it, but not wowed. She got carne asada with asparagus. The carne was very tender, undercooked (in a restaurants-refuse-to-cook-steak-all-the-way-through way), and otherwise fairly bland. The asparagus was grilled and she liked it, but it wasn't Mexican in any way.

Even at the table it took about 15 min to get the chickpeas. We ordered and waited, and waited, and waited, we were so disappointed at this point we honestly just wanted to get up and leave. Once we got our food it was so delicious we were sad that the service wasn't up to par with the food.

I can't decide!\" get yourself to Nopalito.\n\nWhy else might I recommend it?  For starters, on-site free parking, really nice staff, and a warm and welcoming ambience.

That's at least the standard in Atlanta, my home town.  We have some awesome more-authentic-type places (esp on Buford Highway), some reliable enchilada+taco plate type places, and a scattering here and there of some places that try to step it up a bit.\nSo I didn't know what to expect when I visited friends in San Francisco and tried this place.  I'd been to Nopa before, and love it, but here - oh here.\n\nBest carnitas I've ever had.  One of the best margaritas.  Other mixed drinks were magnificent uses of agave-based liquors and just the right mixes and enhancements.  Totops con chile - trust me, it's worth every mega-calorie when you eat these sauce-soaked but still crisp chips with cheese.  Chicken mole.  Quesadillas.  Such simple ideas, but so different than what they'd mean almost anywhere else.  Every single dish had me licking my fingers, however uncouth that may be.  They were busy but wiggled and shimmied to get us in quickly, but then let us take our time drinking and eating.\n\nIt used to be our tradition to visit Nopa once a trip.  We may now have to alternate with Nopalito.  It's just that good.", "author": "Scott M."}

I disagree with his hair and all his dumb one-liners, but I completely agree with his restaurant choices.

Points for that. Fresh and clean atmosphere, casual but still trendy without being pretentious. A place for dates but also families. \n\nDue to my dairy allergy, I don't eat much Mexican food, but they were very accommodating. Complimentary deep fried chick peas while we ordered:\nTostadas: MUST GET\nEnsalada: Fresh butter lettuce with one bite of avocado and one bite of tomato. Sprinkled with peanuts and crispy tortilla strips. Not that tight. \nFish taco: Pretty straightforward. Looked kinda small and sorry on the plate, but the fish was good and the mandarin oranges brightened the taste with a nice burst of citrus. But also not that tight. \nQuesadilla Rojas: Not for me obv because I'm allergic to cheese. He ordered this because it was featured on DDD. Good, but a little too salty (to be expected of pork belly). \nCarne Asada: Seasoned with spices I'm not normally used to (I'm sorry, we grew up on Gordo's and Chino's).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-13", "description": "After eating at Nopalito, definitely the most common conversation my friends and I had for the rest of the night was, \"Is that place worth waiting two hours for?\" Followed as a close second with, \"holy fuck, that food was good.\"\n\nOnce we were seated, everything about the experience was perfect. Waiters were all casual but incredibly friendly; my mezcal cocktail was delicious; the food was to die for. On the recommendation of Yelpers, we started with the totopos con chile--kind of an upscale happy medium between chips and salsa and nachos--which was a great way to start the meal. For entrees, I had a lamb dish, which was the single most flavorful thing I have put in my mouth in recent memory. It's the kind of dish that reminds me just how wide a gap there is between ok-good food and a truly perfectly made dish. Everything worked together, the flavors playing in perfect harmony. It was difficult not to let out a satisfied groan with every bite.\n\nSo, is it worth it? The verdict is a strong maybe. If you're going on a Friday or other busy night, as we were, definitely call ahead with plenty of time before you actually want to eat. They were not kidding when they gave us a two hour wait estimate. Luckily, the ma\u00eetre d' was great about suggesting bars in the area to kill time, so all's well that ends well.\n\nOh, and as a P.S. -- yes; you do need to leave the restaurant, go around outside and re-enter through their takeout door in order to use the rest room. At first, this seemed ridiculous--which, for the record, it is--but by the end of the meal, it kind of grew on me, and the separation from the main space combined with the tight quarters for the waiting area meant that you almost had to small talk with strangers, which I think actually added to the convivial charm of the whole thing.", "author": "Ben K."}

I really did. \n\nI know it's SF but just because it's \"sustainable organic\" Mexican cuisine doesn't mean you've sold me. \n\nIf you charge twice the price for a taco I'm expecting twice the flavor. \n\nAnd for the record - I am absolutely in love with Nopalito's sister restaurant NOPA. \n\nI've always had misgivings about upscale Mexican food. Not that Mexican food isn't upscale - but if you're going to charge a premium I need to be able to say \"damn, that was better than the taco truck outside my office in the Mission\". Nopalito did not pass that test. \n\nThe first thing that almost made me choke was the $3.95 almond horchata. Good god. Almost $4. Really? FAIL. My second thought on the horchata was that while it was good, it was more like Spanish horchata than the Mexican and Salvadorian horchatas I have tried (which I believe are cinnamon based). Just an observation. \n\nThe Taco de Pescado al Pastor for $4.75 (Seared adobo swordfish, chile ancho, orange and salsa de morita y tomatillo) was good. A bit on the spicy side but good. The favorite app I had that night. Yes, one taco is close to $5. \n\nThe Panucho de Pollo al Pibil at $4.50 Black bean stuffed tortilla, citrus-achiote chicken, cabbage, pickled red onion and salsa habanera. Yes, one tostada is close to $5. This one I can't rave about. I've had pollo pibil before at Poc Chuc but never as a tostada. I just wasn't feeling it. \n\nAlso had the Tamal Enchilado de Puerco y Queso at $5.00 Housemade masa, stewed pork, queso fresco, chile ancho. It hurt me to pay $5 for a tamal. Initially I wasn't into it but it grew on me. The queso fresco was a great touch with the guacamole.

We also brought our 5lb Chihuahua, in a shoulder bag, who is neurologically impaired, blind and very old. We take him everywhere. As soon as we got to the door, the host started telling us where we could tie up our dog outside. I don't have to explain how stupid that would be. When we said we were bringing him in, she started in with a list of rules. The manager joined her and restated ...\"the dog must be kept on the floor' etc. They had no interest in good public relations. I wanted to leave, but our guest had picked the restaurant, so I had to be polite. The waiter was aloof as well.  The staff all appeared to think they were doing us a favor by letting us into their restaurant. Every employee we had contact with seemed to need an attitude adjustment.\nI felt equally angered by the clients who left their dogs tied up outside in the light rain.\n\nTHE FOOD:\nFirst they brought us a jug of warm water. I do not know if this is a gourmet thing. But we had to ask for ice.  My chicken was cooked perfectly. It was moist and tender, with no pink. The mole sauce was unexceptional and very little of it. The rice was awful. The tortilla was like damp cardboard. Altogether, I was very sorry I spend $17 on my entre and still had to eat dinner when I got home. \n\nTHE BILL:\nThen they add this 3% surcharge to the bill for employee benefits. Just include this in the price of the food. I don't want to pay $17 for my entre and then realize it is actually $17.51. So since this employee is getting an extra 3% of our bill on top of his wages, I reduced his tip by 3% to even it out.\n\nI will not be eating there again.

We were in the neighborhood, hungry, reviews looked good, and we were able to get a seat immediately.\n\nEverything was, at best, \"alright\".  The carnitas were the only decent thing because the meat was so tender, but it lacked flavor.  Also, the carnitas only came with two tortillas, totally inadequate for the amount of meat and whatnot there.  I thought I heard another table offered extra tortillas, but our waiter wasn't around much to do any such offering.\n\nThe chips appetizer is fresh tortilla chips tossed in hot sauce, with a dusting of cheese and a side of sour cream.  They were ok, but I've had better chips set on my table for free.\n\nWife's quesadilla came unaccompanied, and she left still a bit hungry.\n\nAlso, to use the bathroom here you're required to walk outside, down to the end of the building, and around the corner.  On a brisk 55 degree, windy evening, it sort of kills the mood of dinner to need to bundle up to use the facilities.", "author": "John A."}

I don't care about service or ambiance if the food is good.\n\nNopalito apparently has two locations and after complaining about our food at this one, my girlfriend said that she thinks the same dishes are better at the other one.  With that preface...\n\nPros:  \n* We had 3 dishes and the meat was cooked perfectly in each one.  The chicken in the Panucho de Pollo was awesome (in terms of juiciness and texture).\n* The flavors are not bad and are present.\n\nCons:\n* The flavors are distinctly lacking something.  Maybe it's just too classy for my personal tastes, but no dishes had any PUNCH...they were just there on the plate.  In addition to lacking soul, every dish was missing a taste that would unify the flavors.  You know?  Maybe if they'd just squeezed a lime over everything the dishes would have come together...but no.\n* For what you pay, the portions are laughably small.  This would be excused if the taste was mind-blowing, but getting similar stuff like this on the street in Guatemala (or hell, even Redwood City and San Jose) and knowing how cheap it could be for something that tastes much better and then paying for this specific taste and amount; it's an insurmountable disappointment.  If you can't deliver the taste or keep the price down, at least deliver the volume.\n* Ordered two kind of horchata.  The persimmon-almond one was saved by the persimmon, but the plain almond horchata was just not very good.  My experience with horchata is limited -- I've only had it maybe 10 times -- but this was easily the least good serving of the drink in my memory.  It's also the first time I've ordered horchata at a place where the wait-staff speaks fluent English.\n\nSummary:\nThis place makes fancy food and thus everything tastes wimpy.  It might be what upper-class food tastes like in Mexico, I don't know, but my preferences are for the vibrancy of street food and this place was a disappointment.", "author": "Tom C."}

The drinks were amazing (his margarita wasn't bad either!) and the company was perfect. :)\n\nAfter eating, they didn't mind us going back for seconds, so we grabbed another order of ceviche to finish the night off.

The place is not big and we had to wait awhile for a table since we had a big party.  We tried the white wine sangria and it tasted good. \n\nWe ordered a lot of food. We had the shrimp enchilada, pork, corn with cheese, and a few other items that I can't name.  The food tasted good.\n\nThe reason why I'm giving this place a 3 star is because while I was waiting for a table, I left my drink on a table that was near the bar and a waitress came by to tell me that I can sit on the chair but not put my drink on the table because the table needs to be left clean for the next party.  I thought that was sort of rude and could have been handled better.  For instance, she could have given me a few napkins to put under my drink or even a coaster.  Instead, I may only sit and have to hold my drink in my hand the whole time.  This just means that if people are waiting for a table, DO NOT order a drink unless you're committed to holding the drink in your hand the whole time.  The bar is not an option because it is small and has no space for you to hang out.  \n\nThe ironic part about this situation was that the table I was about to dirty with my drink was actually for our party.  I sort of knew that table was going to be for us because it was one of the only few tables for 8 people.  \n\nAs a result, I probably wouldn't come back.

Luckily though, you can put your name on the list, buy a 6-pack from the adjoined Faletti Foods, and enjoy a couple of cold ones in the tabled area outside the shopping center and restaurant. Plus points!\n\nThe venue is casual and small. There's covered outside seating, a tall communal table, and only a few individual tables inside. Service is slow and spotty. The setup definitely takes a strange turn when you have to actually exit the restaurant to use the restroom, which is accessible from Broderick Street and doubles up as a takeout window (well, the foyer to get to the bathroom, not the toilet itself... but basically!). Wee-yerd.\n\nTaqueria-goers (*raises hand*) might see some familiar items on the menu, but many of them aren't what you expect. The quesadilla roja con chicarron does not come sliced into sections for you to share, but cut it up with your knife, have yourself a bite, and you won't care--it is SO yummy. We also tried the ceviche, which was good, though I've had better. The caldo tlalpeno is a tasty, spicy chicken and vegetable soup, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're hungry. The chicken mole that just got a shoutout in the June issue of San Francisco Magazine in my opinion was too bitter and nothing to write home about. I liked my chile chocolate milk more than my entree--served cold and flecked with red chiles (it's got a kick!). Finally, I preferred the tender, fatty carnitas (not the shredded kind you see in burritos) over the carne asada, which didn't wow me.\n\nThe lady sitting next to me at the communal table claimed that the homemade tortillas were the best she's ever had. I thought they were just ok. They're served in a brown paper bag which our server told us is both for blotting the oil and \"presentation.\" This confuses me, as I could get an equally well-presented paper bag at Papalote up the street for much less.

Which is appropriate because they take no reservations.\n\nGrown-ups don't complain about the wait at restaurants. Either because the wait means it's popular, and for whatever reason you want in on the action... or because you can always go elsewhere. That said, this place is muy popular, so call ahead and put yourself on the waiting list and then enjoy a drink somewhere else for the estimated wait time.\n\nOnce you're seated, order the totopos. Hand made chips from scratch by grinding the corn that morning, making masa, pressing into tortillas, cutting, frying. Think about the labor involved and stop wondering why this place is a bit more expensive than the corner taqueria that gets raw materials from Sysco and bags of chips from Costco.\n\nOrdert the carnitas, because it is possibly the most wonderful piece of pork you'll ever eat, other than maybe bacon but that's an unfair comparison because bacon rules the universe. Seriously, get the carnitas. Thank me later.\n\nJust about everything I've tried there has been great, so feel free to explore. Anything with crispy pork belly is great. Not totally sold on the pozole however, maybe it's just me but I like it with massive nuggets of hominy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-08", "description": "Let me preface this review, by saying I love Nopa, which is arguably my favorite restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nSo when I heard that Nopa had a Mexican restaurant offshot, Nopalito, I was intrigued and worried. Could the little brother of the behemoth Nopa, live up to the standards of their big brother? The answer is a resounding yes. If you are currently following the 2011 NBA playoffs I liken the Nopa and Nopalito relationship to Pau and Marc Gasol. Pau has been the headlining grabbing big brother for years now and Marc has always been the chubby little brother that no one thought would amount to anything special. But so far, as the 2011 NBA playoffs have shown, little brother got game! And that's how I feel about Nopalito, sure you stand in the shadows of your big brother, but baby it's time for you to shine!\n\nSure it is a pain in the ass to have to wait for a table; their are no reservations. Our wait was almost 2 hours. Irritating yes. But worth it in the end because this is best fancy Mexican food in the City. Hands down. Pardon my ignorance, but fancy Mexican food is an oxymoron when you are someone who is only familiar with the sour cream drenched and indigestion inducing foods of your local taqueria or taco truck. \n\nThe dishes they serve up excel on so many levels, including texture, taste, and presentation. The food is elegant, but comforting. \n\nFor starters we had the totopos con chile, in layman's terms tortilla chips and cheese dip. However, this was no ordinary chip. The chips were coated in a orange-y sauce that was both tangy and spicy. The sauce was baked on, so it wasn't messy. But man it sure enhanced the flavor of this super chip. The cheese was white and creamy. Honestly, I don't what I was eating, but man was it good. \n\nWe also shared an empanada con deshebrada de res. I have no idea what this translates into, but the empanada was bomb dot com. I am big on texture and the empanada was super crispy and flaky. It was stuffed with grass fed beef and other super delicious and fresh ingredients, including queso and salsa. Again, pardon my ignorance, but I can't name half the things in this empanda, but my senses do not fail me, this was pure deliciousness. \n\nFor my main entree, I had the quesadilla toja con chicharr\u00f3n; a quesadilla made with pork belly. Only one human sound is guttural and visceral enough to describe the pleasure one gets from this dish, and that one sound is fughhhhhhh. Talk about pure mouthgasm food. Fughhhh. I am at lost with words trying to write out a description for this dish. I won't even bother. Just try this dish if you love pork belly or just plain good food. That is all.\n\nI sampled some of my roommates' enchiladas potosinas de camaron and carnitas. The enchiladas were pretty good, given that I normally do not like enchiladas. The carnitas was exceptional. The braised pork was super tender and flavorful. Plus this dish is super hearty, as it comes with a pouch of warm tortillas to wrap your meat in...(keke). \n\nHomemade popsicles for dessert? Just lovely. I was fan of the strawberry, which was really fresh and each bite came with a bit of fruit. \n\nOverall, this was one of the best eating experiences I've had in recent memory. Enough said.", "author": "Allan Y."}

But I did get another beer that I didn't order.  So the visit wasn't bump free.  \n\nI wasn't that upset though because after a 9 hour day on the bike and wolfing down some emergency pizza at 4:30 I was more thirsty than hungry.

After a few more confused seconds, it turned out there was the option to mix the juices with sparkling wine. Now, I'll take my share of responsibility for not knowing exactly what I was talking about, but her attitude was surprising, especially given that they do have an alcoholic/juice mix on the menu. \n\nWe ordered the totopos, the quesadilla de flor de calabaza, and the machaca de camaron.  The totopos were great--a big portion, everything you always wanted Doritos to be that they weren't. We asked for extra sour cream, and were surprised the portion was so small since it was fifty cents. The quesadilla seemed more like a soft taco, with zucchini rather than the butternut squash we expected ( that's on us though--we didn't ask). It was tasty but small for the price. Finally, although the machaca came with four nice corn tortillas, it was not special--I really feel we could make something quite similar with Trader Joe's enchilada sauce, scallions, shrimp & scrambled eggs.\n\nThe server who refilled our waters was friendly. A different server came and asked to clear our plates before we were finished, which made me feel rushed. All in all, for $50+ for lunch, we won't be back.", "author": "S H."}

The friendly gal on the other end of the phone said if I got there in 20-30 minutes, finding a table wouldn't be problematic, but she still took down my name and digits. She also assured me that parking shouldn't be a problem as ample spaces (for unlimited hours) are available at the Falletti Foods garage. SWEET! Usually, I'd walk but since it was pouring rain outside, I decide to be a lazy arse and drive!\n\nI met my lunch date, and notice the vacant tables in the outdoor patio area. We sit down at a table that was directly under a heat lamp. I was a bit warm under the heat lamp, but not totally uncomfy, as I enjoyed being outside to watch and hear the rain fall and not get wet. Anywho, my date and I were so engrossed in our convo that we had our server, Anne, stop by at least 2 times and we still hadn't quite decided what to order. She let us know that we could flag her or the other server, also named Anne, when we were ready. So, after Anne #1 gives us fried seasoned garbanzo beans on the house, I ask her to take our orders of the Enchiladas de Mole con Pollo - Tortillas with mole poblano, shredded chicken and queso fresco; and Carnitas - Long braised pork, orange, bay leaf, cinnamon and beer. Cabbage salad, pickled jalape\u00f1os, tomatillo salsa.\nTo accompany our lunch entrees, we order a few beers from the fine selection of draft and bottled beers.\n\nThe food arrived within what seemed like 5 minutes, and I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken enchilada. The mole sauce was savory with a spicy kick to it and the chicken, which was shredded, was tender and flavorful. The carnitas were served with fresh, warm tortillas, which my date really enjoyed.\n\nThe service was outstanding, and seemed like whenever we needed a water refill, one of the Annes was there to refill our glasses or our water carafe. We never felt like we were bothered or rushed, which was so nice. It was a very lovely, easy Sunday afternoon lunch.\nBefore we got our bill. Anne #1 dropped off some powdered almond cookies. They were so yummy and the perfect sweet to end the savory and mildly spicy meal.\n\nNopalito is such a casual, yet still manages to be a fine dining experience. It's much smaller and prices are cheaper than NOPA, but you still get that same comfortable vibe. The set up is great with the outdoor patio seating and the indoor seating with the kitchen and counter in plain view.  Service is outstanding, with friendly and efficient servers. The food is fresh and can really taste the quality ingredients. I'll definitely be back to try their other entrees, and look forward to their to-go service when its ready.", "author": "Gill C."}

It's a complete departure, not just in terms of cuisine (Mexican), but in style (casual, family), price (noticeably less), occasion, and these are all good things. \n\nIt's a small space that can seat maybe about forty people, and given its current popularity, you should almost expect to wait during peak lunch and dinner hours (they have a semi-enclosed patio to hang out in). \n\nEverything is extremely fresh, and you can taste it with each bite. Our waitress was more than ready to offer up some suggestions, and easily my two favorites were totopos con chile and the carnitas. Well, the enchiladas de mole were another flavorful surprise.  \n\nWhile they have some top notch beers and wines to choose from, I went with one of their housemade non-alcoholic options, the grapefruit-piloncillo, which was a perfect thirst quencher. \n\nCan't wait to head back, and to all the staff, I apologize on behalf of our son Dash for his uncanny ability to get most of his rice and beans on the floor as opposed to in his mouth (he also likes their quesadilla de acelgas!).", "author": "Nish N."}

We walked up at 2:30p on a Saturday afternoon with 2 visibly empty tables for 4 and were asked if we called ahead. We said no and were told it was a 45 minute wait. As my husband was insistent on trying this place out we waited. In 45 min, the hostess turned away 4 groups of 4 guests who \"walked up\". Meanwhile as we were sitting there 3 parties walked up who had called ahead - one group of 10 and 2 groups of 4. Two of the parties with a group of 4 were both reprimanded for arriving late and not responding to being called by the restaurant. This all happened as we were starving, waiting and seeing empty tables stay empty for a good 25 minutes. Shouldn't we have been seated and fed by then and let these people wait the 15 minutes for us to finish? Oh NO not at Nopalito. Instead after the stern reprimand, they immediately walked in like they were gold.\n\nThe food is excellent, albeit a bit one-note with the heavy handed use of one specific spice but there's enough variety in the menu to keep it interesting. Look at the photos and other reviews to see how good the food is.\n\nIn the end, I remember the awful first impression (hello Nopalito get a clue) of giving priority to customers who weren't there over customers ready to eat and spend money.

This means free parking and easy access to groceries in addition to delicious and authentic Mexican cookery.\n\nWe stopped by on opening night around 7:45pm to a 1.5 hour wait; night #2, with many friends of the house still arriving, was much more resonable at a 15-20 minute wait.  They have heat lamps and gladly serve drinks as you bide the time on the patio.\n\nThe greeter carries with her probably the most amiable babe in arms ever, and it makes you happy that establishments with such family-friendly policies for its employees exist.\n\nOn to the food:\nAmuse: fried spiced chickpeas. (Nopa style) \n\nThere is a list of smaller dishes ranging from $4-9.50.  In the $4 range, Totopos (house-made chips) with spicy chiles de arbol or the amazing Tamal de Hongos y Huitlachoche (Mushroom + Corn Truffle Tamales).  On the higher end is the Quesedilla de Acelgas (Erbette chard and jack cheese, queso fresco), $8; and the Quesadilla Enchilada con Guiso de Puerco (Pork Belly, jack cheese, guajillo salsa), $9.\n\nFor mains ($11-$14) the husbear chose Enchiladas Placeras - Pan-seared ancho chicken breast and tortillas, potatoes, carrots and queso fresco. A note - their house pickled carrots were *very* spicy that evening -- even for someone who likes spicy food ($13).\n\nI chose the Birria de Chivo: Goat stewed in chiles, spices, chocolate, with roasted pinquinto beans and salsa de arbol ($13). Delicious tender goat (tastes like beef) in a marvelous sauce served with a nice vinegary, spicy salsa.  Take your tortillas, dab in a bit of salsa and add the beans and goat.  Try not to drip. \n\nComplimentary dessert bite: Mexican wedding cookie (cinnamony)!\n\nNote that anything with arbol chiles are bound to be a tad hot on your tongue... but the flavours are wonderfully rich and complex.\n\nTake out  and lunch service are scheduled to arrive in a couple of weeks.  For now - make sure to arrive with an appetite (you'll want to sample everything) and patience.  The resto is small, and you'll likely share a 5, 6, or 8 top with other folks.  It's definitely worth it, however.", "author": "Claudine C."}

Huevos de caja was my favorite!!! I've never before had anything like it. For those who don't know what that is, it was refried black beans, poached eggs, salsa de cilantro, and jack cheese on a corn tortilla. The carnitas fell apart and melted in your mouth. MmmmMmm gooood. Last but not least, we ordered the oaxacan style horchata, which is basically horchata with some strawberry pure\u00e9.

It prides itself on its use of local, organic, and sustainable ingredients and this is apparent in the flavor and color of their dishes. \n\nThis is a review of their Brunch Menu.\n\nCame here for late lunch (linner) this past weekend and we were seated quickly by a really nice waitress. Here's a breakdown:\n\nPre-meal snack: These yummy but spicy garbonzo beans. I have a pretty low spice tolerance but these were tasty regardless. I would've been content with a bowl of tortilla chips, but Nopalito does things their way!\n\nI got the Quesadilla con Flor de Calabaza (9.00):\n\"Corn tortilla, squash blossoms, zucchini, jack cheese, queso fresco, cilantro and salsa de tomatillo y chile puya.\" It was the perfect size for me and the veggies were fresh and flavorful, not to mention really nice to look at. It came with a house-made salsa that wasn't spicy (thank god, i would have cried) and it had a slight smokey flavor. Very unique and very tasty. Those with a larger appetite might not feel like they got a good bang for their buck but it was perfect for me.\n\nMy date got the Huevos de Caja (9.00\"):\n\"Poached eggs, refried black beans, corn tortilla, jack cheese and salsa de cilantro\" Of course I had to taste some before he doused it in a habanero salsa that would have literally sent me to the hospital (my eyes watered just smelling it) but if you like spicy, apparently it's delicious! The eggs were poached nicely and this is also a unique and flavorful dish. \n\nMargerita (i dont remember which one i got): STRONG. just how i like it\n\nThey brought out these complimentary bite sized cookies for dessert which were really good but would be better if i were drinking tea....\n\nSo if you're looking for your typical greasy and cheap Mexican food joint (which sounds gross typing out, but when eating, is delicious) then Nopalito is not for you. If you want a unique and fresh Mexican dining experience and don't mind spending the extra cash, then head straight to Nopalito! Great place for dates!\n\nAnd the Peet's next door has the COOLEST baristas if you want a post-meal coffee or tea---a suuuper cute boy used to work there but i haven't seen him in a while. sad:(", "author": "An-Nhien L."}

The service was attentive but when I had a few questions about the food, the server wasn't too well versed.  He did mention that some portions are small and some were large enough for a meal.  I ended up with a great iced tea and ordered two plates to have a filling lunch.  The food was really good.  Exceptional for Mexican cuisine.  Unfortunately, because the portions were small, it made the meal expensive and I wasn't truly full.  I felt a bit let down because it was so good I did want more.  I just didn't feel like spending 20 bucks for a Mexican food lunch.\nIt seemed this place is for the crowd that's uncomfortable in a Mission taqueria.

I have lived two blocks away for two years and cannot believe I have never tried this place.  I am pretty sure I will become a regular.  The servers were nice, attentive, and explained everything about the menu.  My parent's were visiting me to help me out with some domestic stuff while I battle law school and some medical problems.  My Dad had gotten the Carnitas take-out on the way back to his hotel the night before, and when it came to the lunch debate it was Magnolia's or Nopalito.  I didn't want to deal with the pretentious, \"I am too cool for you\" servers at Magnolia's.  Glad we decided to go here.  \n\nOur server answered all of our questions  - even noting which items were better for lunch than a huge dinner (as my dad had loved - but was not feeling carnitas again).  My mom got their soup - and when it arrived the server asked if she had had it before and then explained what to do with the limes, and pointed out the pepper - and when to pull it out based on taste preferences.  I loved my chicken taco - the server mentioned it was a light lunch, but I don't eat a whole lot at one time.  It was perfect.  Corn tortilla filled with black beans and perfectly spicy.  Only $4.50 with a ton of meat.  My dad had fish tacos and liked them as well.  \n\nThe fried chickpeas and complimentary almond cookie desserts were amazing.  Oh!

The whole place is cozy. We sat in the covered area that was much like a sun room, with all windows (an indoor/outdoor area) that had heating lamps as well. The light wooden benches and tables are cute, and the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly. They also use an empty milk gallon as a water bottle for the table, and give you complimentary dried spiced garbanzo beans to start, and almond cookies to finish your meal.\n\nHowever, the food was slightly overpriced for how much you get. I suppose you're paying for the setting, and yes the food tasted good, but portions were small. The vegetarian quesadilla came with a really good smoky salsa. I was slightly disappointed in my shrimp enchilada, because there were seriously almost no shrimp in it. The bits of shrimp i did find were, for lack of a better word, shrimpy, and I could barely taste them under all the other toppings.  \n\nI do look forward to trying their carnitas which are on SF Best of 2010, and this place is too cute not to give it another go.\n\nBTW, owner of Nopalito, please don't give out paper menus, they get dirty and feel flimsy, and I'm sure you have to replace them often, if not all the time.

Went there with a friend last night (a Thursday) and was told the wait would be an hour and a half, but 1 drink and 30 minutes later we were seated at the counter. \n\nThe waitress recommended we split an entree and two appetizers since we weren't that hungry. The carnitas were the obvious choice and also an indicator to me that we're getting way too competitive about the 7x7 \"100 Things to Try Before You Die\" list - neither of us like pork but this is on the list! We also got the chicken tamale and some fish tacos. The tamale was definitely lackluster and lackflavor, but everything else was just \"pretty good.\" The carnitas were juicy and so easily shredable, plus make-your-own-taco has always given me that arts and crafts feel we all miss from our youth. Okay, yeah fine so I'm 23 and we did arts and crafts in my sorority in college, but anywayyy. \n\nHalfway through, the waitress convinced us that sipping on some tequila with accompanying \"sangrita\" (no, that's not a little thing of sangria. It's basically really spicy tomato juice) would go well with the meal/is just the thing you do here. So from here on out it's tough to say if the meal really got better or if I just got drunker, but either way I left feeling satisfied, happy, and accomplished (yay 7x7 list) - a perfect way to gear up for the weekend - though I couldn't help but scowl at all the cute little dating couples on my way out, as I made a mental note to tell the next \"pizza place down the street\" date suggestion that we're going to Nopalito!\n\n+4 stars for the great vibe, friendly staff, and overall experience.

What I mean is the fact that I'm publicly admitting that I like Nopalito is huge.  Immense.  Gigantic.\n\nSee, I hate NOPA.  Not the neighborhood, but the restaurant.  I've hated it almost from the moment it opened its doors and streams of middle-aged couples from Pacific Heights began arriving in my neighborhood on their double dates in their BMW SUVs.  These people would scurry into the restaurant, enjoy themselves, and then escape as quickly as possible, I assume because they felt the neighborhood had nothing else to offer them.  And maybe the Popeye's across the street worried them.  Hell, I don't know, but the first year that NOPA was open, I spent at least an hour total each week waiting at the bus stop across the street around dinnertime, and the homogeneity of the clientele was comical and slightly frightening.\n\nIn case you didn't know, NOPA is named after my neighborhood.  Well, technically, it's named after the cutesy acronym that real-estate agents gave to my neighborhood in order to signal its future gentrification and, I assume, to disassociate it from the larger neighborhood of which it is a part, the Western Addition.  Outright racism being out of bounds--except in the Tea Party, apparently--said real-estate agents can get away with the things they can get away with because classism is still A-OK in the United States, and it's easy to talk about property values and up-and-coming and improving neighborhoods without ever mentioning the people you have to get rid of to gentrify these neighborhoods.\n\nBut here's the funny part.  NOPA isn't even in NOPA, at least not technically.  According to the North of Panhandle Neighborhood Association, NOPA's eastern boundary is Divisadero, which means that NOPA is actually in the Alamo Square neighborhood.  Funny how that stuff works.  A few years down the road, and NOPA attracts a much more diverse crowd.  That's good, although I still hate the restaurant.  Which brings me to Nopalito.  Like its big sister, Nopalito isn't technically in NOPA.  See, the Panhandle is due west of Nopalito, so it should probably be called Eopalito.  In any case, I was all lined up to hate this place, but then I actually had a nice meal here.\n\nThe food is delicious.  The people who work here are nice.  Although it's crowded, once you're seated, you don't feel like you're being rushed.  I'm not the biggest fan of small foodie portions, but when the food is this good, I can handle them.  Still, I wouldn't suggest coming here if you're really hungry.\n\nSo NOPA still sucks and Nopalito is great.", "author": "John S."}

Had to ask several times for several items like napkins, ice (for water), etc.\n\nWe started with the Totopos. These were WAY TOO hot (spicy).  I have had these at the other Nopalito location in the Sunset and the ones here were much different.  Too hot to eat.  We sent them back.  \n\nI ordered the fish tacos and the portion size was more like an appetizer than a lunch entree.  For the price of this dish, it should have at least included rice or something.  Also, the dish was dry.  The tacos needed some sort of sauce or something to counter the dryness.\n\nI do like the fact that they have a good selection of Gluten Free options, but I will not go back here.

It was 845 and they were scheduled to close at 9, but they so graciously let us take a seat at the bar and enjoy a meal. My roommate is vegetarian, and luckily there was no shortage of meals that we could choose from. \n\nWe both started the night off with some beers and all I was really craving was a pescado taco and maybe some veggie taquiots.  My roommate opted for a pescado taco as well, and the veggie quesadilla.  We thought that was sufficient enough food for us both, but our server recommended that we add an additional plate to split because the portion sizes of our meals were a little small- so we got the salmon plate.  \n\nOur night at last came to an end after a full belly of veggies and fish and some beers.

I've been here three times and, while I love how fresh and creative the menu is, I feel that it lacks seasoning and flavor.  I truly feel bad for giving them three stars because you can see the care that goes into their food and service - homemade tortillas, little cookies at the end of your meal, great explanations of the menu for the non-spanish speaking - but every time I come here I'm a bit underwhelmed. It may be because I'm expecting at least a hint of the bold Mexican flavors we've come to expect in California and you don't really get them here. I do really love the two salads I've had though. \n\nThis place is definitely worth a try to see what you think. I know a lot of people that love the place. If you go, try a salad and maybe only one thing that involves corn tortillas (i'm telling you, they're bland).

She might balk a bit at the bustle, though. (And this woman likes a crowd.) Monday night - full to the brim. Didn't wait long for a table, ahem, two stools along a tiny bar counter, and the service was impeccable. \nFull, beautiful bar with dozens of tequilas.\nPretty neat decor; I like that the cooking and preparing is done in full view and that everyone's milling in the same space.\n\nBut honestly, for a glorified tacqueria, this place should be most esteemed for its crisp, bold flavors, and I wouldn't give the dishes I tried more than 3 stars.\nCeviche - tart as a motherf***er, with no alternate edge to cut the sourness. Same with the beet and tangerine salad. Pass the salt!!!\nGranted, there's a little bowl of coarse salt on every table, but something else was missing from the seasoning and I can't tell what. All's I can say is my taste buds were left hankering.\n\nPork belly was scrumptious, I must admit. And I suppose there's something to be said about letting a flavorful, tender meat speak for itself, but I think I was half-hoping for some kind of unique garnish - just a dab woulda done me - and there just wasn't any.\n\nMaybe I'm done with Mexican food, I dunno.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-03-04", "description": "Moderately upscale Mexican, at least when compared to your average taqueria, Nopalito is a satisfying, and unique take on Hispanic cuisine with fresh ingredients and tasteful combinations. I believe the menu changes as I had been here once before a year or so ago, and some of the items such as the swordfish tacos, which were spectacular, were not on the menu. \n\nService: 2 STARS\nI came to Nopalito last night on a date. Having noted that the place was PACKED the last time I had came, I decided to call ahead and try to make a reservation. They don't make reservations, but assured me if I left my name and number on the wait list, I would have a table for two within an hour. I received a txt message roughly 45 minutes later claiming my table was ready. I was excited and pleased by the seeming efficacy of their service. When I arrived there my name was on the list being held by one of the hostesses on an iPad, \"how modern\", I thought. The hostess declared my \"table was ready\" and had to be reset after cleaning. Up to this point I was pleased. Little did I know when they said they would have a table for 2 ready within one hour,  they really meant they were packed on a Sunday night and were going to force us to sit at the bar.\n\nLike lambs to the slaughter our hostess led us, as I glanced around hopefully for an open table, only to be led to the bar. She attemped to dress up the seating, calling it the \"chef's table\", or some nonsense like that. It was the bar, plain and simple: stools and everything.  Although I had called, and put my name on the list an hour in advance, I had no option but to sit at the bar with my date crammed between the throngs of hungry patrons. Nopalito follows a tapas style of food and service similar to Cha Cha Cha, which made the service very awkward. The server had to stand behind us and reach around between us and the other patrons of the bar to place the food in front of us as each dish came. This repeated three or so times. Our server was not particularly friendly or pleasant. At first we were given one small water glass for two, then eventually another glass, significantly larger and clearly from a different set than the first, was brought with an empty glass bottle full of water.\n\nThe Food: 4 STARS\nDelicious, tasteful, yet restrained Nopalito understands how to bring subtly to a cuisine which generally rests on the bombastic.\n\nTotopo's con Chile: $6\nEssentially a reconstructed chips and salsa appetizer, the Totopo's themselves are corn tortilla pieces which have been fried in a oil and a red chile sauce making them spicy and greasy while not necessary \"wet\". Perfect for whetting one's appetite, they are served garnished with cotija cheese and cilantro, which are served with a small dish of sour cream aka \"crema\". The crema, I felt, was unwarranted. The amount they give you is quite excessive, especially in juxtaposition to the relative mildness of the totopo's themselves. Had that small bowl have been replaced with a small portion of guacamole I believe this dish could go from a 3 STAR appetizer to a 4 STAR. \n\nTaquitos de Papa con Espinaca: $6.00\nThis was definitely an interesting take on taquitos! Instead of being stuffed with god awful gas station ground beef and nacho cheese these taquitos are artfully stuffed with a much more tantalizing combination of  potato and spinach. Garnished with cabbage and served (YES!) with a side of guacamole and a side of crema. My girlfriend, a vegetarian, was OBSESSED. This is definitely a 4 STAR appetizer, which could be elevated to 5 STARS if it was served with a side of spicy salsa or enchilada sauce. I say this because the umami overload of the potato, crema, and guacamole is a little heavy, muddying the dish, and could use some spice to clear it up! \n\nQuesadilla Rojo Con Chicarron: $9.50\nAn absolutely delicious quesadilla! The shell is extremely crispy, and inside there is delicious, tender pork belly with salsa, onion, cilantro, and cheese. Easily a 4 STAR dish. My only complaint is that the proportion is a little small considering the $3.50 markup from other items on the small plate menu.  You're essentially paying $3.50 more for the same sized plate with the inclusion of meat. None the less I would highly recommend this quesadilla! \n\nTotal not including tax and tip: $21.50\n\nThe Bottom Line: 3 STARS\nOh Nopalito, how I long to give you a 4 star review overall. The food is delicious, the dishes are interesting, and the flavor is just right which is why I give their food a solid 4 STAR review. Unfortunately, last night the service was terrible. Who sits at the bar after calling an hour in advance?! This isn't exactly Gary Danko's, it is moderately dressed up and date appropriate Mexican food. We held back from ordering drinks and more plates because of the disappointment of seating and service. At that point we just wanted to get in and out. Food was great as always.

After reading all the great Yelp reviews, I was really looking forward to trying this place out.\n\nFirst of all, we asked for a table for two in a 2/3 full restaurant. The hostess passed over 3 tables for two and sat us at a table for 6. I don't mind sharing, usually, but the other diners were really loud so we couldn't hear ourselves think let alone talk to each other. \n\nHad the ceviche which was quite nice. (That, the wine and the wait staff were the saving graces of this meal.)\n\nI had the Carne Asada y Acelgas as la Mexicana. It was okay. The meat was tough and bland - I was felt the need for some serious flossing afterwards - the braised greens were tasty, but the black beans were mushy and tasteless. The mole sauce was probably the best part of the dish.\n\nBig G had the Enchiladas Placeras...um...the chicken was UNDERCOOKED. Unfortunately, because of the red spices on the chicken and the lighting, neither of us notice it until we'd eaten half a piece each. Hellooooo, people...you should know better than that!!! \n\n$50 for an appetizer, one glass of wine and two entrees in a Mexican restaurant?

We were seated on the enclosed (read: warm) patio next to a beautiful border of plant boxes - with exquisitely chosen bright green pants, contrasting dark dirt. (Yes, this sounds very simplistic, to comment on plants & dirt, but from an interior design perspective, the contrast was clean & crisp, which set the stage for the beginning to a delectable dinner.) \n\nOnto the food...\n\nWe started with the following two appetizers:\n* Ensalada de Betabeles: Salad of mixed beets, carrot-orange juice, queso fresco and chile-lime pickled onion\n*Tamal de Frijoles Negros Con Hongos: Black bean-corn masa, mushroom, poblano pepper, onion, epazote, crema, queso fresco and salsa poblano mulato\n\nand later moved onto trying the following two entrees:\n* Enchiladas Placeras: Tortillas, chile mulato, carrots, potatoes, queso fresco, seared chicken breast and pickled jalape\u00f1os\n* Carnitas: Long braised pork, orange, bay leaf, cinnamon and beer Cabbage salad, pickled jalape\u00f1os, salsa de tomatillo \n\nEverything we ordered was, frankly, phenomenal.

It's because of this Emperor's-new-clothes phenomenon that I tried Nopalito not one, not two, but THREE times before finally admitting that it's just not that good.  In fact, it's just plain not good!\n\nMy first visit was for lunch shortly after the restaurant's grand opening: overpriced drinks, undersized portions for the prices (and yes, I'm factoring the cost of organically and sustainably raised foods), and CHEWY ceviche. In short, yuck.\n\nMy second visit was a take-away order mid-December 2010: some overpriced burrito-type thing that I can't believe was fried, and which relied on its dipping sauce for flavor.\n\nMy third visit was just on Wednesday (mid-February 2011) for dinner, and my dining companion and I, for the first time in each of our 21st-century experiences, sent our entrees back.\n\nHer albondigas disintegrated at the touch of her fork, and their near-black color resembled something so unappetizing (think HazMat) that I couldn't state it until the plate was taken away. Their flavor was promising at first taste (yum, cumin!), but faded into nothing in just two seconds. I never salt my food, but I did these, and it did not help.\n\nMy mole was so beautifully presented (see user's picture) that it brought a tear to my eye, and the chicken was the tenderest and most flavorful I've tasted at a restaurant in a long time--and it had better be, at $14 for about 3 ounces of leg meat. But the mole itself? BURNED! The telltale bitterness of burned chiles. Oh, so bitter. [wipes tongue at the memory of it]\n\nI prize my dinner companion above the food we're sharing, but when our server approached us both picking at our plates, we confessed our dissatisfaction. She took our plates and offered us some guacamole while she adjusted the bill. The bill came back with only my friend's albondigas removed, and get this: a charge for the guacamole! Unbelievable, especially since it consisted of about 1/4 of an *overripe* avocado, bland as ever, to boot. The manager responded, and we insisted that both my mole and the guac be removed. He begrudgingly complied. We even asked if there had been a change in kitchen staff, a vain attempt to defend our server's perfectly fine service.\n\nWe tipped 20% on what would have been the total, paying only for two $8 glasses (short pours, barely 3 ounces) of mediocre red wine plus some of the BEST-tasting tortilla chips ever created--and I never thought I'd say this--*if* you salt them.\n\nWhy the two stars, then? It would be just one, but for the sustainable organic foods offered.", "author": "Diana P."}

If you want more space try to get a table outside.  The place has lots of light. The one bathroom is reached by going outside and around the building.\n\nService: a bit brusque at the door but she was sifting through lots of people and the system is not efficient. People with dogs are trying to get seated outside, big parties need multiple tables, people are calling ahead and others are walking up asking how long, in a very congested space. One can't help but ask, what is the purpose of no reservations except to perpetuate chaos?\nInside, once we were snuggled together, our waitress literally had to come up behind us, get our attention and hand us stuff over our shoulder, but she was friendly, efficient and seemed unphased.\n\nFood: I would put up with a lot, including pringlization, to eat this food. There were so many yummy looking things on the menu and others being cooked in front of us, it was hard to know where to begin. Watching other food led us to pick the chips covered in chili sauce, sprinkled with cheese and white onion (do not even think nachos), the stew with white beans, pork bacon, cilantro, and the thick corn tortilla with pork, chorizo and cabbage on top. It was impossible to chose. The mole enchiladas looked fantastic, as did the posole and this fried quesadilla thing. \nFirst, let me say that everything we had was fantastic, and they all tasted different. What a pleasure to have three such distinct dishes. The chips are crispy with just a big of chew, spicy and they give you a sour cream like thing (crema) to dip them in but it's not necessary. The stew has large, almost firm white beans, chunks of bacon, and a red flavorful sauce. It's served with warm, chewy corn tortillas. And the thick corn tortilla dish was a mix of textures and tastes with a lightly spicy bite.\n\nDrinks: they have beers, margaritas, and a variety of non alcoholic Mexican bevs. We had a hibiscus orange drink that was light, refreshing and just slightly sweet, exactly like a similar drink I had in Mexico. We had the mex beer Indio which is a lighter dark beer.", "author": "Vivek V."}

After a 45 minute wait, the hostess told us we were next and would be seated soon. We watched what we thought was our table being prepared but were then told we couldn't have that table because there was a group coming with small children. They instead gave us a bar seat. Not a huge deal but we had been waiting 45 minutes and specifically asked if we could please have the window seat. They again refused. 10 minutes later a group walked in with NO children and took the table we requested.  This party was obviously being given special privileges for whatever reason. We waited for 45 minutes and they walked in With no wait and sat at a prime table. But here's the bad part. I asked that  they at least give us an apology and maybe buy us another round. That would have fixed everything. Instead they were completely unapologetic and brushed it off as \"not their problem.\"  They just lost three regular customers.", "author": "Michael A."}

I was excited to try Nopalito even though i haven't even tried NOPA yet. lame i know but hey, I will try NOPA very soon! :) The wait for this place can be pretty long and they don't take reservations but apparently you can call ahead to get on the wait list. We ended up having to wait around 45 mins for a table but it was worth the wait. At least for the food but not the company that came with it. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n\n-Ceviche Verde de Pescado y Calamari- which was a combination of marinated rock cod, tomatillo, calamari, lime, cilantro and topped with avocado. I found this to be my favorite among the two appetizers we ordered. It had a spicy kick to it that i loved, I keep coming back for more. Until there was none :(\n\n-Taco De Pescado al Pastor: which is a taco that contained a piece of fish that is seared in adobo, a chili, orange, onion, cilantro and salsa de morita y tamatillo. Unlike Fro-yo Girls experience our fish was not dry and i thought the flavors mixed well but agree that the orange was a bit too sweet.\n\nFor our main courses:\n\n-The gf got the Carnitas: The braised pork was delicious and flavorful but it was a little bit dry for my taste.\n\n-I got the Enchiladas Placeras: Which contained tortillas, chili mulatos,  around teh plate where scattered summer squash, carrrots and potatoes. The was a pretty good amount of queso sprinkled everywhere on the plate. The seared chicken breast was perfectly cooked, it was tender, juicy and carried alot of flavor.\n\n\nNow that i talked about the food, I thought it might be funny to tell you about the people near us. So when we were seated, we noticed that the table of two was very close to us. It looked as if they had split a table of 4 and didn't have room to move the tables much, so the clearance wasn't that much. First off we had an old lady with another laady  making comments about our food and just kept trying to make conversation with us as we were trying to eat our food. Once they left then a couple sat down and they were annoying as ever. \n\nThe girl starts talking to her bf about this guy at the bar area. She said he looked like a \"12 yr old boy and shouldn't be with such a hot girl.\" O.o Her bf then chimes in and says well maybe he is \"packing\" and the gf agrees by saying its probably the only reason she is with him. The bf's response to this is he probably uses a penis pump. At this point, I was getting reallie annoyed that they couldn't shut the hell up and eat!!! I mean WTF, I am trying to eat here SHIT! If i wanted commentary I would have gotten take out and sat in front of the TV. After we finished eating, I wasn't even in the mood to check out the dessert. I just felt like leaving and the gf was in total agreement with me. Despite this crazy convo's we heard and encountered I would like to come back and check out a more of their dishes as well as the dessert the next time around. Until then, I will have to hit up NOPA :D", "author": "Jonathan W."}

By the time I got halfway through the drink, I could barely taste it anymore because it was almost all melted ice.  But I finished it, what are you gonna do?\n\nOnce I sat down, I ordered another Sangria, this time without ice.  Instead of coming in a half-pint glass, it came in a half-full wine glass.  I asked why they weren't serving it to me in the same size glass - and the waitress said, and I kid you not - \"It's the same amount of alcohol that you would get if there was ice in the drink.\"\n\nJust in case they were any way in the right here, I asked my friend who bartended for many years and also owned a bar and restaurant.  He said, in no uncertain terms, that it was unacceptable for them to do that with sangria.  With a mixed drink, it's the bar's call - it costs you a bit more, but you get repeat customers if it doesn't seem like you're nickel-and-diming people.  But with Sangria, which costs basically nothing, it just makes no sense - you're not saving money and you're pissing off a customer.

They sat us at a two top table with the third chair placed in the small walkway the servers use to get to the different ends of the restaurant and bumped into my back several times in the few minutes I was seated in that third seat. I asked if we could be at the four top instead that had opened up at the same time, but was told by the manager that because they were so busy they couldn't afford to sit us at the four top because there were only three of us. \"Ok\" I said. But then the manager sat a party of three at the very table I asked about. At that point I got up and asked her why she denied us the three top when we were there first and I had asked for that table AND the hostess had made a mistake and made us wait longer because she simply forgot about us. She said (in a rude manner) because they were so busy, and turned around and simply walked away. \n\nI didn't want to make a scene so I just sat back down and had just resolved never to come back. But my out of town guests had heard and saw the exchange with the manager and one of them got up and confronted the manager. That out of town guest was both my senior and the manager's senior, but the manager simply said that she was sorry we felt slighted and if we didn't like it, we didn't have to eat there. WOW!! The audacity of that manager stunned me! I had been a waiter at several restaurants and had never witnessed such behavior from a manager! Then one of the waiters came to our table and apologized for the manager's behavior. I was shocked again! A waiter apologizing for the manager's behavior?!

Forget La Taqueria down the street - Chavo's is awesome...and they give you so much!\n\nThat said, I had to see what the more modern idea of carnitas is by checking out the famed dish at Nopalito.  First time I've been there, and what a treat.  The wait was 45 minutes, so we trekked up the street and around the corner to The Page for a beer during the wait.  Dark, seedy, and a no-nonsense and not entirely friendly bartender awaited us.  I knew we weren't there for long, but it was definitely not my cup of tea.  The two pool tables, though, are a nice addition.\n\nBut, I digress...\n\nFrom the succulent garden that surrounds the heated outdoor area of the fairly small restaurant, to the extremely nice servers, Nopalito is a nice little tucked away place to get some fine grub.  We ordered the ceviche, which was so fresh and delicious I almost devoured the whole thing before my companion could get a fork in, edgewise.  We also tried what I'd like to consider dinner's take on chilaquiles - I forget what it's called but it was the first item on the menu.  It was made with a red sauce that I wasn't too into, but overall it was a good dish, especially when you're at the top of the chip pile and all the cheese is there waiting for you.  \n\nMoved onto the carnitas (finally, what this review is about).  Arrived in a nice little paper bag with sides of green salsa, pickled pepper, carrot, and onion, and a cabbage mixture.  Came with tortillas, in which I did not partake.  Simply delicious.  It was maybe a total of 6oz of meat, but I could have downed another 6.  So good.  \n\nOn the other hand, my dining companion had the pork quesadilla, which came in a really brown tortilla and I can't figure out how it got that brown.  Maybe it's deep-fried?  Anyway, the catcher on this one is that the quesadilla arrives with pork belly cracklings cooked inside.  Now, it sounded absolutely divine when I ordered it, but to eat it was...crunchy.

So we did what we thought was obvious--we added our name to the list and waited by the entrance for the host/hostess to give us more information. \n\nSo we waited about ten minutes with no host/hostess in sight. Other diners also signed up on the clipboard and we were all milling about, waiting to talk to someone. All the while, waiters and waitresses were busy running around serving customers inside. \n\nAnother ten minutes go by, and finally(!) a man comes out to look at the clipboard. He's on the phone, writing down people's names on the list. When he finally gets off the phone, instead of greeting us, he asks whether or not or name is on the list and declare to the whole group that the wait will be at least an hour. \n\nAt this point it was eight o'clock, so we felt like it wasn't worth the wait. We took our name off the list and decided that next time we try to eat here we'd call ahead to put our name on the list before arriving. \n\nAt this point I'm mildly annoyed by the host's attitude and the lack of service, but whatever--it's a Saturday night and everyone is busy. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAbout two weeks later, we decided we want to try eating at Nopalto's again. Once again, it's about 6 at night and we decide to call ahead.  My GF gets on the phone and tries to call--busy signal. She tries again a few minutes later--no answer. She tries yet again, and no answer.\n\nAt this point we're getting hungry, so we decide to walk over and see if we'll get lucky. My girlfriend continues to try and call as we walk.\n\n We arrive and once again, there's no one at the door. We put our names down on the clipboard that's next to a cordless phone that's ringing off the hook. \n\nWe wait ten minutes and the same man finally comes to the entrance and picks up the ringing phone. He once again writes down names and then turns his attention to the gaggle of people outside the door. We ask him how long the wait will be, and this time he says an hour and a half.  He says that to us as we're looking through the windows and see three of four open tables. We ask him about those tables and he says that the other groups waiting are about to be seated, but instead of seating them, he lets the tables sit there empty for another ten minutes...\n\nWe left at that point. Why wait to eat at restaurant that doesn't make an effort to keep your business?\n\nBefore anyone gets too riled up, I DO know that Saturdays are busy and that we should have tried to call sooner, yada yada. That's not the point. \n\nWhat upset me about Nopalito's experience were a few things:\n1) Nopalito's does not take reservations. You have to call ahead to put  your name on the list.\nFine--that business decision is their prerogative. But, IF that's the decision you choose to make, then you should have someone staffing the phone at all times--especially on a Saturday night. We called and kept calling. Not answering is not an option. \n\n2) They don't have a greeter/host:\nWhat's their problem--are they short staffed? On a Saturday night? Come on! That's just plain stupid.  There are tons of people looking for jobs right now and they decide to run their seemingly busy restaurant without a competent host? I know that my experience would have been a ton better if they had 1) someone dedicated to running the list of diners waiting to be seated and 2) to welcoming potential diners and seating them instead of leaving tables empty for 10-20 minutes until magically deciding that they can be seated. \n\nEating out is supposed to be an experience--from walking in to walking out the door. Restaurants should be judged for that complete experience, not just on their food. \n\nNopalito's needs to work on the basics before I'll consider trying to eat here again.", "author": "Laura M."}

Yea you. Here is why I'll never be back.\n\n1st and Foremost, your disorganized staff is the reason people wait 2 hours to get food not because your place is unjustly popular. The front of the house person sat the group that checked in immediately before us after 30 mins. So how the heck did we get seated after 1 hour 15 mins, 30 mins beyond our estimated wait? Once I got inside I realized why, not only is the staff running back and forth like chickens with their heads cut off they aren't communicating. The table next to us asked for a special salsa on the side. You brought them the salsa after a few minutes then a few minutes later someone else brought them the same salsa only to have it sent back because, guess what, somebody already took care of it. So you waste a few minutes here waste a few there and it adds up to bitter customers pacing in front of your restaurant. I seriously suggest the owner taking the whole staff on a field trip up to that Puerto Rican spot in San Rafael to see in person how a super busy place can communicate, stay organized and pump out happy customers like a machine.\n\n2nd, after waiting a total of 2 hours to be handed $40s in food. We were presented with steak that was pink in the middle yet chewy(is this an indicator of cheap meat?), chorizo that was greasy, homemade tortillas that were gummy, and a shrimp salsa that was fishy mushy and blah. I swear I could slap a cook when I bite into a taco and all the chewy meat pulls out on the first bite leaving a hollow tortilla. Come On Man that's not cool and certainly not a $15 taco plate. Also your Enchiladas Potosinas aren't Enchiladas Potosinas they are tacos rojos and not worthy of being called Enchiladas Potosinas. I suggest you fly the cooks happy asses to San Luis Potosi and serve them the real deal maybe a light bulb will go off and they'll realize maybe we should change the name.\n\n3rd your guajillo salsa tastes good but it wasn't pushed through a strainer so I got a mouthful of impossible to chew bitter chunks of dried chili. No Bueno. I can't say gnawing on bitter dried chili peppers is a desire of mine. Your salsa would be killer if you made it smoother.\n\n4th and finally. You did me dirty. I don't know if it was your salsa, fishy shrimp, rubber steak or greasy chorizo but I have a horrible pain in my stomach thanks to you mother lovers. Now I've gotta be up for work soon and I can't sleep because I feel like the alien from SpaceBalls is going to pop out my stomach any moment and start singing, \"Hello! ma baby: Hello! ma honey: Hello! ma ragtime gal\"\n\nSo yea good luck to ya.", "author": "R J."}

This place does not take reservation, but you may put down your name by phone as you are on your way there. I did that two times, which still left us needing to wait for an hour or so. But by the third time, like a charm, we got seated right away. \n\nI came here to try their carnita because it was on the 7x7.com 2010 SF Big Eat List. If it's on the list it must be good right? That wasn't the only reason I wanted to dine at Nopalito though. It was more so because Nopalito is not any Mexican restaurant...it is an ORGANIC Mexican restaurant. Also, I'd been wanting to try this Mexican stable sauce call Mole. \n\nUpon seated, the waiter gave us water and a small bowl of fried chickpeas. And as hungry as I was, I started munching on them. They were good. Not too greasy, not too salty, just how I like them to be. I had looked at the menu so many times before since I'd been wanting to try this place for awhile. \n\nWe ordered what was on the list, the Carnitas. I think what got this carnitas on the list was that unlike many Mexican restaurant, which served their carnitas shredded, Nopalito served it as a whole in a baked parchment paper. Using a folk, the carnitas could be easily shredded apart. Very juicy and tender, but just not as juicy as most carnitas you get at other Mexican restaurants. I think it was because other Mexican restaurant then soaked them in grease. Nopalito's carnitas was good, but just not something I would go back purposely for. \n\nWe also ordered Mole Chicken since I wanted to try Mole. My coworker told me about how mole was made with chocolate, so I expected it to be sweet, but it wasn't as sweet as I could have imagined. The sauce tasted very unique. It was a little sweet yet bitter as the sweetness trailed off. I didn't really enjoy it much. I had to scoop some sauce away and just ate the chicken by itself. The poached chicken was really tender. I like it a lot. The rice was really good too. It was cooked with tomato, so it was very appetizing. \n\nWhat I love the most out of everything I ate at Nopalito that night though, was their Housemade Corn Tortillas. Both the entrees were served with homemade corn tortilla. Now I think this tortilla should have been on the list instead.

Very flavorful and the meat was tender. \n\nFriend went for the braised duck leg, which was succulent and tasty (as duck tends to be, I guess).\n\nBest friend went for the chicken consumme, and I don't know how a dish including turnips cauliflower, and garbanzo beans has a bolder flavor than a pork shoulder stew, but it did (in a good way).\n\nThe corn tortillas they bring out are a little starchier and dryer than I'm used to, but I suppose that helps balance out just how strong the drink flavours are. We were initially going to pass but the bartender was entertaining as he kept hawking his wares and I'll be honest, they were worth it. I had the Mezcal Paloma, which essentially tasted like a combination of grapefruit and smoke - loved it. Best friend went with the Bloody Maria, which was basically a Bloody Mary using beer instead of vodka. Not my thing (as I don't like tomato juice) but he enjoyed it.\n\nOne oddity of the restaurant (as two of our party found out) is that you have to exit the building to use the restroom (they're by the takeout station and there's no clear path without going through the food prep area). \n\nThere were LOTS of groups (I think the entire restaurant was filled with parties of four or more, except for one pair on a date) which is a good idea since there are no sides included with your entrees. We just kept passing our dishes to the right, but if on a date I'd definitely order some smaller dishes to split.", "author": "Justin B."}

The staff treated us as if they knew us already, which is good for me because I'm a big dork who likes to spazz in enthusiasm about great food, and I didn't feel judged for my flailing.  There was a group of 5 or 6 ladies lunching at a nearby table, along with a toddler, and it seemed an appropriate setting for group or family gatherings.  And lordy, the food at Nopalito was fantastic.  I think I'll need to visit a couple more times before maybe upgrading my rating to five stars, but believe me, it won't be a chore.\n\nI ordered a margarita, which was nice, but I wish I had followed my friend's recommendation and ordered a mezcal cocktail -- same price, more adventurous, and quite tasty according to my friend and previous Yelp reviewers.  We split the fish taco (Taco de Pescado al Pastor), squash blossom quesadilla (Quesadilla con Flor de Calabaza), beef empanada (Empanada con Deshebrada de Res), and chicken enchilladas with mole sauce (Enchiladas de Mole con Pollo). I love fish tacos, but my personal preference for tacos is more like sloppy street vendor food rather than what was served at Nopalito; however it was undeniably delicious and high-quality.  The enchiladas were my first mole experience, and it was a great introduction, though sweeter than I was expecting.  I think I'll have to try mole at a few more places before I figure out my preference.\n\nMy favorites were, in ascending order, the empanada (delicious, crispy, again with the fresh ingredients, and the beef was excellently prepared) and the quesadilla.  Holy crow, that quesadilla may have changed my life.  I had never had squash blossoms, and their crispness, combined with the subtle creaminess of the queso fresco, was such a delightful surprise.  \n\nThere's plenty of parking in back, prices are reasonable (definitely not Mission taco prices, but you can get something small and completely delicious for $5), and the flavors are pure and clean, and combined in an obviously thoughtful and loving way to provide you with a full and robust bunch of mouthfuls.  The waitstaff was quite friendly and prompt -- maybe they're in such good moods because they get to eat at Nopalito all the time.", "author": "Kelly F."}

The chips are smothered in the sauce and heated, with an arrangement of condiments, which we asked for on the side, so we could dress the chios as each of us liked. I'm all in, but if you have dairy sensative people in your group its a good option. Just the chips with sauce is still good]\n\nTaquitos: (4 Star)\nThey are taquitos, What do you want? =) No really though. Not greasy, very assertive flavors and a decent 2nd starter.\n\nCeviche Verde de Pescado y Calamari (5 Stars)!!!\nMarinated rock cod, calamari, lime, tomatillo, jalape\u00f1os, cilantro, avocado and housemade tortilla chips\n[Review: The server maintained that it is the best ceviche in the city. Having only been to the cevecheria in the FiDi, I don't have much to compare, but its equally as good as ive had anywhere, and may edge themout for cleaner fresher notes. Very fresh, very clean flavors/texture, and a perfect course to have before the entree]\n\nCarne Asada y Acelgas a la Mexicana (5 Stars)\nSeared flank steak, braised greens, onion, tomato, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os , black beans, queso fresco and salsa pasilla\n[Review: We shared this, because we were getting kinda full, and this was really only a pitstop, so they did a split at no charge, and this carnes asada plate was perfect size for two of us. Nopalito sources the beef from Marin Sun Farms and its 100% grass fed. Just saying.]\n\nMezcal Margarita - (5 Stars)\n[Review: Maybe it was because I was already several drinks deep when I ordered this, but it was awesome. My fellow diner didn't like it, and I can see how it might be an aquired taste but I thought it was great. The agave plant is smoked when making mescal, so expect a very smoky margarita, if ur not used to this flavor. very good i thought]\n\nNo dessert. In fact I've never had desert here, but I have had the pozole, the carnitas, the beet salad, and others at various times, and everything here at Nopalito is good. They take the food industry seriously, and you cannot do yourself wrong, but stopping here, as the prices are reasonable. 5 Star Experience.", "author": "Jason F."}

Real mexican food, like you'll experience in Mexico (if away from a resort town).\n\nThe folks at Nopalito really turn it out.  Consistently amazing food.\n\nTHE SCENE\nIndoor and outdoor seating.  Clean, uncomplicated aesthetic.  And generally, plenty of tables.  Some nights you can end up waiting like 30 or more minutes, but if that's the case, you can always wait next door at Peets :)\n\nTHE FOOD\nThe dishes are simple.  We're not talking about beans and rice plates.  If you order Carnitas, that's what you get and nothing more.  The portions are large and can be shared (if you also have an appetizer).  Speaking of appetizers...you have to try the TOTOPOS CON CHILE -- they are addictive chile rubbed chips.  Also, whatever you have to eat, you should definitely try their HORCHATA -- it's home made and is so much better than any other horchata you'll try other places.  \n\nSome people's reviews say that the food is bland.  That's just not true.  It's not bland - it's subtle.  It's not a \"knock em over with super aggressive chile flavors and salsas\"  It's more like, \"use traditional spices how they were intended to be used -- let the spices subtly enhance the great ingredients.\"\n\nTAKEOUT\nIf you are there to order take-out, then walk around the side of the restaurant.

They make their own tortillas in house, use organic products for all their food, and make delicious traditional meals.

The first bite of the piping hot, homemade tortilla stuffed with the juicy pork, pickled veggies and cabbage and tomatillo is incomparable.  \n\nYesterday for a party of five, we ventured beyond the carnitas (although we got two orders of those as well).

The place was hopping when we showed up...all the tables were full so we had to wait for 15 minutes.  No problem, it gave us time to look at all the dishes as they came out.  We were sat at a communal table and started perusing the menu.  A couple was sat at the remaining two seats and after about five minutes decided to move to the next table (despite it being another communal table).  It was weird, but whatever, time to order.\n\nWe decided to go for one appetizer and one entree apiece to have dinner family style.  As apps, we ordered: tostada de tinga, tamal enchilado de queso & puerco, and quesadilla roja con chicharron ( i am a fan of any sort of fried pork product so i could not resist).  They arrived quickly and all were delicious, but i think the tostada was my favorite.  The quesadilla was deep fried and i think i was just expecting the chicharron to be fried.  I was not a big fan of the \"taco-like\" shell.  Next up for dinner we ordered: carne asada, mole poblano con pollo, and stewed cod (i cannot remember nor pronounce my dish to save my life).  All were decent.  My cod was stewed with tomatoes, peppers, onions, and capers.  It was slightly spicy and sweet at the same time.  I tried both other dishes and believe that mine was the best of the trio.  \n\nDinner was a good experience.  I think all three of us would return, however, we would revise our strategy.  The appetizer section of the menu definitely was the better part of the meal.  Service was also a bit spotty.  I know it was busy, but we were sometimes neglected by the waitress.  Also, b/c the waitress disappeared for a bit, it took a while for the appetizers to arrive.  Then the entrees showed up before we were finished with our appetizers.  Since there is a take out window my advice is to go to it, buy your apps, and enjoy them at home.  \n\nOne last note...the bathroom is in the take-out area.

Bland mexican food is a no go. \n\nParty of 4 and our experience: \n\nOrdered 2 bloody mary's, server said 'it will be about 10 minutes and they mixing up the base'. When WE asked again 20 minutes later, and said any word on the bloody mary's we were told in a VERY condescending english accent that it has only been 12 minutes and that was that! \n\nRequested their spiciest sauce for the huevos and our bandana head clad server brought me mashed up grapefruit, infused with orange juice, and I quote. I tasted it and asked for anything with some spice or maybe a tomato based salsa, he looked at me as if I was crazy and then stated in yet another condescending manner 'we have NOTHING with a tomatoe base or spicier. Walked away and then when we got the bill they charged us $5.00 for the 'hot sauce'. BTW-my daughter dumped the grapefruit mash in our margarita and it was MUCH improved margarita!\n\nSo we were made to feel like idiot customers and they NEVER did bring the bloody mary's or offer an alternative, AND they charged us more for hot sauce. Will never go back as they seem to be truly elitist in their treatment of customer. Where is the manager here? No decent bloody mary mix on a sunday, surly employees and disasterous hot sauce from a mexican restaurant....really?\n\nI have been to Nopa and it is a 100 times BETTER experience.

The quesadilla con chicharron is also lovely.  Fatty crunchy fried pork pops in your mouth and does not disappoint.  Oh and the torta de chilorio is what you are having if you decide to lunch here because it is only available for lunch.  It comes with house made potato chips and the bread is a nice ole squishy bun.  It's a sloppy joe gone Mexican- delish!\n\nThe bonus take out window on the side so you can get in and out with your food without pushing your way through the crowd is brilliant.  \n\nNote- the smaller lower priced items are indeed smaller.  So if you are hungry like I am most of the time, you might want 2 or 3 of them to the one bigger dish.  \n\nAt the end of the meal, you get these tiny little Mexican wedding cookies, which are so dry you'll be wondering why you didn't order a glass of milk.

What an experience.  Our server, Emmanuel, was very helpful and patient with us Nopalito virgins.  The restaurant is not huge.  It has an indoor and outdoor patio area that is covered and very well heated for those cold nights.  I love exhibition kitchens and they have that as well.  Once sat we were given a small dish of salted chickpeas(?).  \n\nI had the much talked about Michelada.  Never had it before and it was good.  Next time I will try the Sangria. I was the DD, so I couldn't partake in too many adult bevs.  **One thing to note about the Sangria (as told by our server) is that the fruit that accompanies the Sangria differs depending on what is in Season.**  Makes sense, but we were salivating from the white wine sangria w/ frozen grapes picture.  Yesterday they had it with Oranges.    \n\nWe decided upon the Totopos con Chile and Ceviche Verde de Pescado y Calamari.  Both were delicious.  I'm lactose myself, but I didn't want my friends to miss out on one of their popular apps.  I just made sure I had one of the chips from below.  Still yummy.  They got a little kick to them from the sauce it's covered in.  But, the crema compliments it nicely and cools it down a bit.  \n\nWe all ordered separate entrees and decided to just grab a piece from each as needed to try.  I already knew that I wanted to have the Carnitas from the get.  It was so damn tasty and moist.  I could have just eaten that without everything else that came with it.  I guess you could think of it as the one of best Atkins meal out there.  All Meat and Veggies.  My other friends ordered the Enchiladas Placeras (chicken was tender and moist.  sauce was light and not too overwhelming), Mole Poblano con Pollo (my first mole and it was surprising good...subtly sweet and yummy), Albondigas al Chilmole (recommended by our server as an \"adventurous\" dish...meatballs were done perfectly - not dry - and though the ingredients were indeed a bit adventurous they all seemed to work great together).  **I know some people have said remarks about their portions, but we found their portions perfect sized.  So much so that we didn't have room for dessert as you'll read below.  And we are all about desserts**\n\nWe were so stuffed that we couldn't indulge in dessert (boooo).  But, our server was so thoughtful and brought our (2) birthday celebrants Mexican cookies with a candle for each.  Sooo sweet.  They were a perfect way to end our meal.  \n\nOur bill for 2 apps, 2 drinks, 1 bottle, 4 entrees = $116 and change.  Not bad for real good organic Mexican food with local, sustainable ingredients.  Service was amazing.  Even though our water was next to us, we never had to refill it ourselves.  The staff are very attentive and so nice.  We shall be back Nopalito!  Count on it.  \n\nThings to Note:\n- Free Parking in Parking Garage next door\n- They don't take reservations, but you can call ahead and say you're on your way.  They'll really put your name down on the wait list as they're talking to you on the phone.  \n- They offer Complimentary Still and Sparkling Water.\n- The Carnitas is on 7x7's 2010 Big Eat SF (100 Things to Eat Before You Die).

We found it far too dense and concentrated and left it half-eaten to melt on it's wrapper.\n\nBonus fun: Sit at the counter and watch the bartender hand squeeze limes for the margaritas then use a straw to extract a tiny taste of each drink she makes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-26", "description": "Absolutely amazing; I'm assuming the only reason Nopalito doesn't have 5-Stars is because American's are so boring in their taste- commonly preferring Chevy's or Taco Bell over authentic taste and flavor which all too commonly is heaven for the palate.  And, all for a few dollars more, if not less.\n\nThe only thing non-Mexican about Nopalito is the atmosphere and staff- along with the occassionaly \"stuck-up\" clientele.  I personally prefer authentic settings, similar to those found at Chava's, El Paisa, and El Zocolo in the Mission.  The environment at Nopalito is definitely enjoyable- especially the full-view kitchen.  I must admit though, I feel sorry for the chef's and line cooks (they have no privacy!).  Plenty of light during the day, and the restaurant is located in a new and contemporary shopping center.  \n\nIf you prefer Tex-Mex (American-infused Mexican food) then you may want to pass on Nopalito.  The food is of superb quality; I personally care less about organic food, however combined with the high quality of the ingredients it's an added bonus.    Try the Birria con Chivo, absolutely superb, although in Mexico, it's simply called Birria.  Unless you're Jewish- aka a Kosher dieter- you'll enjoy everything on the menu.  You'll be so excited that you'll come back again simply to try something new.  And in the two years I've been coming here, their menu has never changed.  The quality of the meats, cheeses, vegetables and other ingredients combined with the heavy authentic spices is what makes the meal.  \n\nThe type of Mexican food found at Nopalito is mostly Jalisco style combined with a Southern Mexico flavor as well.  Your Northern Mexico taqueria food cannot be found here, (aka, tacos, burritos).  \n\nI'm a German/Italian (eating a lot to support both my German size and Italian hunger) so the only problem is the SMALL (I mean -small-) portions.  When I go here I usually order two entrees- and no I'm not a pig!  If you're looking for a cozy authentic Mexican meal and are not in a rush and must have full flavor, then please, stop by.  Lastly, this reminds me that Nopalito does not take reservations, and wait times commonly exceed one hour.  The DMV is across the street, so since they make you wait two hours to be called, simply run across the street to Nopalito and enjoy a wonderful meal and maybe even a cerveza (beer).\n\nI also find this to be a perfect restaurant for dates: I've taken two here myself.  It's not loud, so you can listen and talk with your date, but it's also not quiet to the point that you're nervous.  It's very casual and, put simply, happy.\n\nEnjoy.", "author": "Robert L."}

Maybe just that it is a SWPL type of place...\n\nWe went there for sunday brunch. The wait took 40 mins, and yet another 25 mins before food showed up (and I dont have an issue with this since I understand its a sunday and everyone is out for brunch).\n\nBut when the food did show up, I found it to be failry mediocre. We had the shrimp machaca, a fish taco, a torta and a pinucho. there seemed to be something amiss in each of the dishes. Maybe it lacked the intensity of flavor... So we ordered a hot sauce, and were given something that mildly resembled relish (i.e. not spicy at all). We asked for something else, and kept waiting, then we asked another person, and waited more. Then asked yet another person and waited some more. Finally, after 15 mins of waiting (our food was getting cold all this while), we actually went almost into the kitchen to get it ourselves.. \n\nThe litte cookie at the end was a nice touch, but the service was totally lacklustre.

The consistency was very watery and the flavors were extremely subtle. They serve it with a side of crushed chili powder and mexican oregano and you're supposed to season to your liking. I used it all and still wanted more. Plus I added salt and tried to squeeze the very dry half lime they gave me. It still lacked the pizazz I was craving. My partner had the Pork Sandwich (so did about 2 others around us) and it was delicious.

My bestie lives down the street and I've been eyeing nopalito ever since she moved to the hood, esp during trips over to the neighboring peet's and falletti's. Plus I love eating nopales (cactus) in mexican cuisine, so I was attracted to the name because it reminded me of that.  \n\nWe liked the tented eating area - it had that outdoor green-housey feel to it, but you are covered and flanked by heat lamps. I had the quesadilla azul, which was one of the only vegetarian options on the lunch menu (beside from maybe a salad and a chips and salsa plate). It had braised veggies and two types of cheese and it came with a good spicy salsa on the side. My friend had a chicken taco and a pork dish. They were all nice-sized small plates - I'm sure some would say that the portion sizes were too small for the price, but we happen to like small plates so no complaints there - I just know how some people think. Good flavors and fresh ingredients. \n\nI also liked the little touches, like the homemade \"corn nuts\" they served when we sat down and the little cookies that came with the bill - mexican wedding cookies, anyone? Felt like a high end \"ladies lunching\" kind of experience but was not too pricey. I do have a feeling dinner would be pricier.

We were excited to get seated after only 15 minutes, when we were originally told it would be about an hour (you can't make reservations, but you can call and say you're on the way, and they put you on the list as if you're there).  There's free parking for 2 hours in the Falletti's garage.\n\nOur server, Emanuel, was very knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.  As you sit, you're given a small bowl of...toasted corn? toasted chickpeas? anyhoo, they're tasty and crunchy and delicious.  I had the mint-lemonade, everyone else had the sangria and the michelada-there were empty glasses of everything as we got up to leave, so you can feel free to form your own opinions there.  note: your meal comes with FREE still or sparkling water, which is a rare treat in san francisco restaurants these days.  the sangria was tasty, made with oranges this time, and surprisingly strong for the taste!\n\nfor apps, we had the totopos con chile-AWESOME.  think tortilla chips smothered in a spicy sauce, sprinkled with cheese, served with sour cream on the side.  the spiciness of the chips can kick your butt a little bit, but the sour cream calms it down right away.  a verrrrry delicious treat.  they also had the ceviche, which i couldn't eat, but everyone said was very fresh and delicious.\n\nwe each ordered an entree. i was very happy with mine, the enchiladas-the chicken was so tender, moist, juicy, and flavorful, and the enchiladas were perfectly cheesy.  there was a side of veggies-carrots and potatoes. everything was great! i had bites of my friend's carnitas-also amazing.  tender, moist, perfectly salty, and the green salsa that came with it was good.  \n\nnow, this is just me, and my amateur palate..but to me, personally, i didn't see what the big deal was about the carnitas.  yes, they were tasty and soft and moist...but to be on all these \"things to eat before you die\" lists and stuff? really?  to be fair, though, i usually don't eat carnitas, or much pork in general.  i also personally didn't care too much for the mole chicken or the meatballs.  again, i'll say, my friends seemed to enjoy their dishes very much, but they just weren't for me.  i found the meatballs to be too smokey for me, and i may just not be a mole fan in general. \n\nwhen we were ordering, the server was very conscientious to tell us that the meatballs were good, but an adventurous dish.  they were soft, and flavorful...just not my personal flavors.  this doesn't mean these aren't good dishes, just not to my personal liking.\n\nthe food and drink was good enough that we didn't have room for dessert...but our server was sweet enough to bring us mexican cookies for dessert.  \n\nall in all, i would definitely eat here again, and recommend it to people, but i just know what i for sure what i would and would not order.  the service was great, and the stuff i liked, i really really liked.", "author": "asia c."}

Everything is done with the utmost care, and it is clear from the moment you walk in the door. I came alone and sat at the chef's counter where I watched the bartender prepare the myriad of tasty cocktails available. I had the Mezcal Palomita, which had a wonderful smoky flavor and reminded me of mezcal I had once in the mountains of Guerrero. To start, they bring spicy garbanzo beans instead of the traditional chips and salsa. Quite hot! I ordered the duck confit huarache, topped with cabbage, queso fresco, and chorizo. An interesting take on the traditional dish. Loved it. I also had the ceviche, which was equally delicious and had a green tomatillo sauce, more the style I've seen in Peruvian restaurants. Their coffee is brewed French press and a butter almond cookie is provided gratis at the end of your meal. Something I've left out is that the waitstaff was tremendously friendly and helpful. Their service was so on point and seamless, I was compelled to leave a twenty dollar tip on my 37 dollar meal. They chatted me up and made me feel extremely welcome.

Don't get me wrong, I love me some dirty taqueria Mexican food but sometimes when I go overboard, I end up paying for my tacos and burritos in other ways. Wait, I think I've revealed too much...\n\nI recently visited and had a fantastic caldo/soup dish. I wanted something lighter because it hadn't been that long since I ate lunch and this was the perfect dish. It was chicken consomme with a charred chile (I can't remember what kind but it was pretty huge), avocado chunks, caulflower, hominy, cilantro and a few other healthy goodies. The server told me that the longer I kept the chile in there for, the spicier it would be (and also if I poked at it or aggravated it). It was awesome because it imparted a soft smokiness throughout the broth. Yum! It was definitely a feel-good dish. \n\nI also had the ceviche, which was great as well. It was in a green salsa type liquid with fish, squid and baby scallops. Nice and spicy - and the chips that accompany it are perfectly crispy and firm. \n\nI would probably pass on the quesadilla with crispy pork belly. It was a pretty greasy affair.\n\nThe carnitas is always awesome looking (I never order it because it's too intense for me but I've been lucky enough to sneak a few bites both times I've been here). It comes with lots of warm corn tortillas and some pickled veggies on the side. \n\nLastly, the popsicles. Mmmm, I'd say pass on these. They're really intense popsicles that seem barely frozen in a way. The chili chocolate one tastes more like a cold truffle on a stick and the arroz con leche one was, well, really rice-y and glutinous. I know you're thinking, what did you expect? But it wasn't very sweet, just really chunky. I think you're better off just eating the little cookies that come with the check. \n\nOoh, I almost forgot about the fried garbanzo beans! They taste like refined corn nuts. They're awesome. \n\nOnly real complaint about Nopalito is that the bathrooms are located outside, even though you can see them in the restaurant.

They don't take reservations, but you can call in and put  your name down, which is what we did. By about 6:45-7:00, all the tables were full. We sat in the outdoor area, where they had the heaters on -- a bit too high, in my opinion, but since it was cold and windy outside, it felt nice.\n\nThe food is a contemporary twist on your traditional Mexican dishes. They use local, organic, and sustainable ingredients; portion sizes are on the smaller side given the prices; and the dishes are sort of hit or miss, depending on what you order. \n\nWe split the taquitos, primavera quesadilla, ceviche verde, and each got a fish taco. The taco was tasty -- seared fish in a tortilla with onion and cilantro, ancho chile sauce, orange slices, and salsa. The orange slices added a sweet-and-tangy flavor that went really well with the ancho chile sauce.\n\nThe ceviche was probably our 2nd favorite dish. There was a lot more calamari than rock cod and it was a bit on the lime-ey side, but the salty chips and avocado slices made it delightful. Our table neighbors had to totopos, and that definitely didn't look as good as the ceviche. I'd highly recommend it if you like calamari and want an alternative to plain ol' chips-and-salsa.\n\nThe taquitos were nice and cripsy (but not oily), but you only get 4 pieces -- which is really 2 cigar-ish sized taquitos cut in half. The quesdailla wasn't anything special (esp. since it was a veggie one) and lacked taste. Thank goodness for the salsa they give you with it. It didn't save the dish, but made it bearable.\n\nThey've got a decent mix of tequilas and a handful of tequila-based cocktails. The service can be slow at times, especially when all the tables are full. We waited about 10 minutes after drinks came to order food. So be prepared to hang out a bit when you come here.", "author": "Denise E."}

After we had those, I was so excited to try the rest of the food, but it was downhill from there.\n\nfish taco - looks great, but left a fishy aftertaste in your mouth\nGordita de Picadillo - so greasy that you could barely pick it up, grease dripping all over the place\nside of rice - I asked the waiter for a side of rice for my 15 month old daughter, it was so spicy I couldn't eat it!  I asked the waiter about it and he just said \"yeah, it's really spicy\", I wish he would've warned us up front, he knew who it was for!  i asked if they could make a non-spicy version and he said they could not.  They did credit this on our bill.  However...when I received the side of rice with my dinner, it was NOT spicy at all!  Pretty inconsistent and seems that they do have some control of the spice in the rice.\nBirria de Borrego - this is the lamb and the only good thing i can say about this was that the meat was tender.  the portion was incredibly small, you could put everything in one of the corn tortillas they serve with it and it would barely be enough.  Which is not what I expected considering this was a $16 dish!  Other than having a slightly gamey flavor, there was no taste to it.  the sauce they served with it could have been mole out of a jar. \n\nAnd, our dining experience was totally ruined by the extremely hot lamps they had going full blast out on the closed-in dining patio.  We asked the waiter if they could be turned down and he said that they could not.

First, the wait is not fun and since they don't take reservations, there's not much you can do about. Next, it's the LOUDEST restaurant I've been in, including sportsbars, etc. You can't have a conversation, well actually, you can't focus on a conversation b/c you hear everything everyone around you is saying. The space is also really tight, so if you are waiting for a table, and trying to get a drink inside while doing so, there's no where to stand, you''re constantly in the way. The 'bar' is actual seating so you can sit down there even if a spot it open.\n\nOnto the food... Now if the atmosphere had been a little better (not so loud), and reservations were offered/not so long wait, then I think I would come back to this place as the food is pretty good. But based on those issues, the food wasn't that amazing to make me go to the trouble. Here's what we ordered:\n\n-pork belly quesadilla\n-empanada\n-carnitas\n-carne asada\n\nThe food came out quickly, the apps separately, as they were ready, which worked out well. Everything was good and we were definitely full when we left. They were good about keeping water filled, but as the place was so packed, our waiter didn't check in often and my husband would have had at least another drink if he's been asked. We both liked our mains, although I hate to say it, I still love the carnitas at Colibri.\n\nI think this is a fun place, a good place for groups, but again, due to how crowded it was, the long wait and being so loud, it just isn't worth a return for the food.

It turned out to be a bad evening, and a less than optimal way to get to know them.\n\nThere were problems from the start. While we were waiting they asked us to move out. Alright I understand that.  But then they should have tried making up for it in some way. Instead, they escalated things by  snapping at some of my friends when we reached for an unused chair. We wanted to accomodate a person who showed up last minute.  \n\nThen the food. The flavor was alright, but they took a long time to bring food to one of us.  They brought his appetizers later than they bought the main course for the rest of us!  You should wait to have all 9 dishes done before bringing them.  \n\nThen came time for the bill. Some of our friends would have benefited from having separate, itemized, bills. Unfortunately we did not mention this before dinner. Our fault? sure, but they were not at all willing to help on this. Other restaurants have done this kind of adjustment before. Some grumble, but do it, the best just do it. (And we go back to those)\n\nOkay, then instead we take the time to specify how much to charge each card. Give them the bill with the numbers. Then they take it and spend 20 mins without getting back to us.  \n\nMeanwhile, their heating system can only either grill you if you are below it or otherwise leave you pretty much to the mercy of cold San Francisco weather. A few of us needed to step away from the heat lamp. This seemed to only annoy the waiters more. If we stood in one place, they would want to walk in that place exactly. Then when we moved,  thats where the waiter wanted to walk, 3 times. And they were not nice about it.\n\nFinally, they came back with the wrong bills. They decided it was too complicated to do, so they simply split the bill on equal parts in the end. Some of us had consumed very different amounts than others, and they had already taken 30 mins to do this! we were not going to now sit and go through it again.  We were leaving the place, and some of us made clear how dissatisfied we were with the whole situation.  \n\nWe were about to leave, when a waiter comes out to inform the manager that we did not leave enough signed receipts. Really? well there were enough. And they found them, but this just made things more tense.\n\nIt seems they just cannot handle a group of more than 3 people, they should make this very very clear rather than provide mediocre service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-07-04", "description": "When you can get an authentic Latin American meal in the mission for no more than $15 a person, including a beer, it's hard to give into the idea of \"fine dining\" Latin American good that costs $50 a person with beverage. Then again, that's not bad at all considering we had two appetizers and two alcoholic beverages each, on top of our entrees which were large portions. \n\nAnd even still, for the price, I wasn't that enthused by Nopalito. Let's start with the appetizers:\n\n1. Topotos con chile- GREAT, and not at all soggy by the cojita cheese and lime sauce.\n\n2. Civiche*- Fresh, but not original in flavor. Like any other civiche you've had. My co-worker MADE a MUCH better version once... on his lunch break!\n\n*comes with chips. Why the waitress didn't tell us this, we don't know. It was pointless having two heaping sides of chips for 2 people.\n\nEntrees:\n\n1. Carnitas para mi- ok, so it's on the 7x7 list and I thus had to try it. I wasn't too thrilled I did. Sure, the meat was very well cooked and tender, BUT where was the flavor?!?! Donde?! The carnitas are supposedly braised in beer, orange, cinnamon, and bay leaf, but I could not taste a single one of those spices or flavors to save my life. A little disappointing. The cabbage salad with pickled jalapenos was very good, though. A much healthier, fresher, version than what you get at taquerias.\n\n2. Pescado a la Talla para mi amiga- I didn't try it, but my friend said it was good, however not memorably interesting in flavor...again. \n\nTo drink, we had some Malbec (always nice to see a Malbec on a menu) and I tried a glass of their white-peach sangria with frozen cherries. Perhaps the best part of the entire meal! Very refreshing, strong, and an original concept for sangria.\n\nI recommend coming here and bellying up to the bar for some sangria and an appetizer or two. The other appetizers we spotted on tables looked great...but again, in terms of flavor, it could be a gamble. Maybe Nopalito is one of those places where the food is hit and miss. Depending on what you order, its either exciting or completely uninspired. I do like the atmosphere, and the servers are very friendly. I also didn't wait an hour to sit, as I dropped in to add our names an hour before we were even going to be ready to eat, so I wasn't too disappointed with the food for that. If I had to wait forever as many seem to do, this review would have probably been a lot worse.", "author": "Raquel C."}

So when I read about 7x7's list and the carnitas at Nopalito, I had to go.  \n\nSuffice to say the food was great.  Its not your usual mexican fare and I'd say there is a little more effort to make it more than just simple mexican food.  \n\nThe funny part is that my girlfriend got the carnitas and I got the mole.  One can't find mole everywhere and one can't find good mole anywhere.  When I read that they had mole on their menu I sortof jumped on it and my girlfriend got the carnitas.  I loved both of out meals.\n\nTry and get the popsicles. \n\nThey don't take reservations.  However, you can call ahead and put your name on a list.  They are really cool about it.  I called and left a message that the two of us were coming and they didn't even take my name.  They forgot and I forgot.

It's a lovely ambience, and a good value for a mid-range, sit-down place.\n\nIt's a huge bowl of pozole for $11, a huge bowl of birria for $10, and some meat-heavy appetizers (like chicken pibil) for $4. Is it better than a giant $5 burrito at your favorite taco truck? Not better, just different - and very very good. And, there is Bohemia beer for $3.25 - you will pay that much for it in a mid-range restaurant in Guadalajara. (You will pay $2.50 for it in a cheap bar in Guadalajara).\n\nThe problem with arguments are \"authenticity\" in Mexican food, is: \n 1) Mexican cooking styles are both regional and individual (you'd never call someone's mom's macaroni and cheese \"inauthethic\" because it's not exactly like your mom's). The food at Nopalito is not like the food my family makes, but it's still delicious. \n2) It locks a culture's food into a place in time. Mexican chefs in Mexico put their own twist into traditional dishes, just like every other chef.

They were FABULOUS. The meat is juicy and loaded with amazing seasonings, the masa is fried to perfection and not greasy(!), and both small plates were topped with tons of cotija. My only complaint is the price difference, which doesn't make any sense -- the gordita is $4.50 and the empanada is $7.00, although they are roughly the same size and are very similar food items. Regardless, both are worth ordering.\n\nI was also happy to see that the check is still delivered with a Mexican Wedding Cookie for each person in your party.

Both nontraditional, modern takes on food and atmosphere, they appeal to the masses and foodies alike. And unlike the more familiar Mexican food of the Mission, you won't find anything typical here. Although Nopalito is a small establishment, they really have utilized the space that they have next to Falletti's Foods extremely well. Decorated in earthy brown and green hues, from the burlap art on the wall to the one-of a-kind lamp shade with cactus illustrations hanging over the bar, this place makes me feel right at home.\n\nWhile you peruse the menu they serve you a small dish of their homemade crispy chickpeas. I really wish they sold those by the bag to take home! Their menu has small dishes akin to Spanish tapas perfect for sampling on the left and larger portioned meals on the right. The staff is very friendly and I love that they labeled my food that I took home. They are also very accommodating. The dishes here are mostly non-vegetarian fare, but they gladly changed up a dish for a vegie friend who also doesn't eat mushrooms.\n\nItems I recommend trying: Huevos de Caja, Carnitas, Esquite Tostado con Crema y Queso, Pozole Rojo, and their own Organic Almond Horchata.\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest perk to eating here is that Nopalito shares their parking lot (yes parking lot!) with Bank of America, Falletti Foods and Delessio's Market & Bakery. 4 great places and free parking for every one of them.

Yes, but that is inherent to carnitas--Nopalito did nothing to further this dish.\n\nenvironment/service: two stars (* *)\nI called ahead to put my name on the list.

We finally had to ask someone how it worked and he kindly sat us. The worse part was that we waited 15 minutes before a waiter came to our table. It was absolutely ridiculous. The place is not even remotely big so I know they saw us. After 20 minutes, I decided to flag a waiter down. He was nice, but not apologetic. We order a Tecate (that's the only beer on the menu) and a Michelada. The Michelada was ok. It was definitely a twist of the original recipe (I hate when people f**k with original recipes).

An hour later I realize just how much salt and grease I'd consumed as I curl up in bed trying to drink a gallon of water to counteract dinner.\n\nBeing vegetarian I was a little unsure how dinner here would go, but they were very accommodating in showing us the veggie options on the menu, and even turning a few meat items into veggie meals. We were very grateful. We wanted to share small plates instead of ordering appetizers, because from a veggie point of view, the apps are much more diverse and delicious sounding. We were informed that 4 would be the correct amount of food for 2 people. So we ordered, and after our food arrived it was gone 5 minutes later. Bother because it was delicious, but also because it was teeny tiny. We ended up having to order even more food.\n\nThe service was decent, the wait staff was very pleasant are fairly attentive, although they did forget to bring two dishes to the table until we asked about them 20 minutes later. I think generally speaking, I felt a little cheated out of time having to wait so long for food to come out of the kitchen and the plates to be so small and barren. Because I'm willing to wait for my food, but not if I'm only going to get three bites out of it after it arrives.\n\nAll in all, the prices are good, the strawberry sangria awesome, and the food delicious. I'll probably go back when I happen to be in that part of the city, but I'm not sure I'd specifically plan another trip there.", "author": "Allyson S."}

But if you are coming to have a refreshing take on Mexican cuisine, then you are visiting the right place.  Nestled in the bustling new Broderick complex, Nopalito is a great place to visit on a sunny San Francisco day.  The place is full of windows and makes good use of their limited space.  \n\nThe food, which is for the most part organic and sustanable based products, is satisfying for both my growing need to try new things and my larger than normal appetite.  I really enjoyed the Ceviche and the fresh plump pieces of fish, as well as the Totopos (thich tortilla chips covered in a red sauce and cheese.)  I'm a huge fan of Carnitas and while Nopalito isn't the moistest one I've had, I did enjoy the hunk of well flavored pork sitting in the cermamic bowl.  It was more than enough for two people to share.  The (non-alcoholic) drinks are all worth trying, especially the Horchata.  Try not to leave with out getting one of their desserts on a stick.  ;)", "author": "Jason A."}

If you really wanted good Chinese, you'd go to Chinatown. If you really wanted good Mexican, you'd go to the Mission. \n\nThat being said, let's talk about the food. The Totopos con Chile (tortilla chips tossed in chile de arbol and topped with cojita cheese and lime) was a cute idea, but it just didn't have that yum factor. I would've been happier with simple housemade chips and salsa. No, they don't have that. And that's the last time I pay $14 for Carnitas. I'd much rather have Gordos or El Farlito. Actually I didn't pay for it, and I'm still complaining! She had the Carne Asada steak which was a perfectly cooked skirt steak that was tender and flavorful. It was accented nicely with a peppery mole (mo-lay!) sauce. I'm glad she doesn't eat much. Awesome!\n\nSo I'm not saying this place is not good. You just have to know what you're getting yourself into when you go here.

It feels like everything at Nopalito moves in slow motion.

Your interior and decor rock.

These are not the most common in SF but are more popular in TX where I grew up and are a great addition to a Saturday lunch. \n2) I used to live about 2 blocks away and when it is busy, they let you call in and they will put your name on the clipboard.

I wouldn't call them healthy, but they were clearly better than regular nachos with a ton more flavor. The portion size was gigantic. So much so that my gf and I couldn't finish if we intended on eating our entree. The tequila selection is excellent and there are a ton of local beers that I love, but I do wish there was more a craft Mexican beer selection available (Is there even such a thing that exists?). My gf had the quesadilla for dinner which is not like a normal quesadilla. It's almost like a large soft taco folded over with mushrooms and cotija inside along with some really fresh greens. I'm not fan of mushrooms, but my gf (a vegetarian) loved it. \n\nI ordered the posole. To me posole is sacred, it's like going to an Italian restaurant an ordering the Chicken Parmesan or the meatballs or a pub and ordering fish & chips. If they can't get this right then how can I expect anything else to be good? The posole was the best I've had since I was a boy and my best friend's mother used to make it. It was hearty and just spicy enough, there was enough pork shoulder in it to create a fantastic flavor, but not too much to over power the dish. Tons of hominy and chips, onions, oregano and spices on the side to fix it up to your own specifications. \n\nI wish I remembered my server's name, instead I'll have to describe him. He wore black rimmed glasses, with black hair and was very attentive. Not in the overbearing sort of way, but just enough to know that if we wanted something he'd be there. He knew the dishes, let us take our time and was very very nice. He made us feel like we were not just customers, but guests. We also were helped by either a second server, a food runner or a busser, I'm not sure what his title was, but he boxed up my posole, dropped the check and was very witty and funny in his small interactions with us, It was the epitome of team work and at no time did I feel like they were overbearing or annoying.\n\nThis is the best casual plus dining food I've had in the city and we're going to definitely make this our go-to place.", "author": "Matt D."}

I want to describe our outing as the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.  \n\nGood:  The food and the price.  We loved the Carnitas and also shared the Ceviche, and the Tamal.  The corn tortillas were great too.  \n\nBad:  Service and wine.  This is the kind of place that you need to order as soon as the wait staff show or you are in for a nice, long wait.  We were eating at 8:30 p.m. so I don't know if our waitress was tired, working too many tables (7+ tables), or just didn't care.  We ordered some wine (I know this is lame at a Mexican place) but it was terrible.  My wife ordered the Syrah-Carignane and I ordered the Carignane.  We are not wine snobs but the Syrah-Carignane tasted like they took a scorpion and squeezed it into a small wine glass.  They should nix the wine and just stick to beer until they get a license to serve hard alcohol.\n\nUgly:  The wait.  You are looking at at least 90 minutes to 2 hours at a minimum on a weekend.  You can call ahead to get your name on a list but you still have to wait.  The host was nice and accommodating but he was managing a six page list (back and front) and you have to track him down by going into the restaurant.   They take your name and phone number and then promise to call you back.  We hung out at a bar on Divisadero.  I think we could have saved ourselves some grief by just showing up at 9:15 or 9:30 p.m. and pretend we live in South America.\n\nSide Note: There was a couple on a date beside us and they waited longer than we did.  We told them that we experienced the same thing but the food was quite good.  The guy's date looked pissed and he was looking frantically for a waitress to order since his date looked like she was about to eat the silverware.\n\nMy suggestion to the restaurant would be to take reservations to save everyone some grief.   The host looked beaten down and spent all his time with an ever expanding list.   The patrons looked unhappy due to the chaos associated with a list and not knowing when they would be served.\n\nI am not ranting here but I wanted to make sure people have realistic expectations for a place that has good food but needs to work out some kinks in service.", "author": "James B."}

I was a Michelada virgin before today, but no more! I love the combination of the light Mexican beer, chili, salt and lime.

This is not your standard greasy spoon Mexican.  If you want that then choose another option.\n\nBecause it is a sister restaurant of Nopa, which I love, I did start off with high expectations of wonderfully spiced and balanced food.  I was a bit disappointed. To be clear, the flavors of the food we had were wonderful and the ingredients were super fresh, but each dish that had a tortilla was overpowered by it, and unfortunately just about every dish I ordered had it.  If Nopalito could make those tortillas thinner it would balance the dishes in terms of flavor so that the tortilla would be a side note rather than the main attraction.  The dryness and thickness of the tortillas really do detract from the experience. Seriously nopalito- change this one thing and it would take you over the top, bringing you on par with your sister, nopa.  \n\nThat being said, I think the food, the ambiance and the service was very good. I imagine that there might be a few dishes that I will decide are *the* dishes and it will become the four stars I feel it can be (which is why I rounded up). When I go back, I will try the chips & salsa as the tortillas alone are wonderful if they are the main attraction, and will also try other dishes that do not have the tortillas & will update.\n\nOh! whatever you do, if you are a chocolate lover- you MUST order the hot chocolate.  I cannot say enough about how the flavors dance on the palate.  It is like a dessert you drink. oh. my. god.  I wish they had more options in terms of dessert here. Considering how well nopa does the pot de creme (to die for) I imagine that they could do an amazing flan or tres leches.  \n\nWe had the taquitos, fish taco, empanada, quesadilla, and carnitas.  We also tried the sangria, sparkling & hibiscus valencia orange, and the sparkling & strawberry lemonade.  Oh.. and the hot chocolate. \n\nThe carnitas were very good.  I would definitely order this again.\n\nThe taquitos were good also.  Again, wish the tortillas were thinner- or if not then there was more filling to balance it out. I would order this again, but not jumping to- I will try the other appetizers first.  \n\nThe empanada filling was wonderful and more plentiful than the taquito and because of the deep frying, it ended up having the tortillas taste less dry. It also could have been heavier on the filling & wish it did.  I would definitely order this again.\n\nThe fish taco dish was good but the balance was off because the tortilla is thick & dry. The sauce was good and helped, but I would not order this dish again.\n\nThe veggie quesdilla filling was good but of all the dishes this had the most serious balance issue and the bites tasted dry.  The filling was good but sadly, because of the dryness I would not recommend this dish unless they were willing to put double the amount of filling in it. That would certainly help to balance it out.\n\nAgain... did I say ORDER THE HOT CHOCOLATE? The hot chocolate was out of this world amazing!!!

We took the Hayes st bus from Civic Center and in minutes were deposited just two small blocks from Napolito which is across the street from the DMV parking lot. The place was busy, we were asked to stand at a side bar for 10-15minutes until our table became available which was fine by me because I like checking out the \"Cocineros\" or cooks in action. The bar tender asked us for our drink order, I chose the Strawberry Ginger drink which was refreshing! \n\nWe were seated at a table for two which wasn't too close to the next table (Pet peeve of mine) so we both had some elbow room and didn't have to hear our table mates conversation. My only comment about this table, in the semi permanent room just as you enter the main dining room is it sits underneath the heater which made us feel too warm. Several times during the meal we asked our server to turn the heater off, somebody else asked to turn it on, well you see how this game was played throughout the evening.\n\nOur server was a lovely young woman, asked us if we had been to Nopalito and since we had she didn't go into great detail about the restaurant and took our order. Here is what we ordered:\n\nTotopos con Chile:Tortilla chips, salsa de arbol, cotija cheese, crema and lime.  \n\nIn a paralel universe, Totopos con Chile would be served in every Mexican restaurant instead of the typical \"Chips n Salsa\". These are just amazing, the tortilla chips are fresh AND crisp, tossed with a spiced red sauce but not so spicy that lightweights like Irv will cry about it but spicy enough so that heat/spice lovers like myself are still satisfied. I love the salsa crema served with it to cool it down and the squeeze of lime adds the perfect touch to this starter.\n\nQuesadilla Roja con Chicharr\u00f3n: Chile mulato corn tortilla, crispy pork belly, salsa guajillo, jack cheese, queso fresco, onions and cilantro. \n \nAs a teen I worked in a Mexican restaurant and made tons of Chicharones, the perfect Chicharon has the perfect balance of fat and meat; the Chicharones served at Napolito's were perefect! I'm also a fan of quesadillas, and I loved the combination of meat, salsa, cheese, cilantro and onions, it played out very well, was a joy to eat.\n\nGaspacho de Frutas Estilo Morelia:Salad of peaches, nectarines, apricots, orange juice, chile, lime, queso fresco and Nopalito hot sauce.\n\n This is not your Gaspacho from Espanya! In fact I would call this a fruit salad to be quite honest but doesn't Gaspacho sound better? The fruit was ripe AND sweet, the perfect dish after the Totopos and Quesadilla and still not filling which left plenty of room for the main course, CARNITAS.\n\nCarnitas:Long braised pork, orange, bay leaf, cinnamon and beer, Cabbage salad, pickled jalape\u00f1os, salsa de tomatillo.\n\nOk, I died and went to culinary heaven with this dish, it's all about the Carnitas. Again, I'm no rookie with Carnitas but these are not just ordinary Carnitas. A typical Carnita seems to be a mound of shredded meat and you add salt to bring out the taste, more seems to be better. The Carnitas at Napolito's had a wonderful taste of spices, very moist, tender, loved how they arrived in a pocket of parchment paper which I think is how they keep their cooked meats from being overdone. Loved the Cabbage salad on the side and picked jalapenos, these two items only enhanced the carnitas taste.....oh I forgot, the home made tortillas are delicious, again, these are not the typical corn tortillas you buy by the dozen at any mercado or Safeway, these are home made and you can definitely taste that stone ground corn goodness in them.\n\nI'm not a big dessert eater not because I don't like dessert but I felt perfectly content at this point (Panza llena, corazon contento) and one more morsel of food even in the form of dessert would have put me over the edge from content to uncomfortably full. Irv on the other hand ordered the Home made Paletas or popsicles with blueberry and white peach; he loved it, especially nice on one of our few warm evenings. I did enjoy the little sugar cookie at the end that is brought with the bill, I'll say it again, those should be on the dessert menu!

Ironically, the menu sure talked about how many spices each dish contained - and man were those descriptions fancy.  Our pork stew had tiny pieces of pork floating in a mass of red broth that tasted of nothing.  I kept adding salt to it, hoping the taste would change.  The goat came out, about 5 small pieces - nicely tenderized, but tasteless.

The space is on the small side, although there are several larger tables in the outer covered courtyard area (there are heat lamps, so no worries about being cold).\n\nSERVICE: Every single staff member we encountered was very friendly (although occasionally a bit brusque... which I assume is b/c they were in a rush).  Our waitress took pretty good care of us, considering all the other tables she had to cover.\n\nFOOD: Beware, just about everything is deep fried (not what I expected).  Reminiscent of classy street food.  We shared several dishes:\n- Totopos con Chile ($6): Not bad.  Not as mindblowing as others made them out to be.  They're like weird soggy Doritos with a generous sprinkling of cotija cheese on top.  The fact that Nopalito's chips are extra thick is a nice touch.\n- Panucho de Pollo al Pibil ($4.50): Good flavors, but the chicken was so dry.\n- Gordita de Picadillo ($4.50): My least favorite dish.  Bland and greasy.\n- Empanada con Deshebrada de Res ($6): Very beefy/gamey.  Wished there was something to mellow out that flavor... onions?  \n- Ceviche Verde de Pescado y Calamari ($11): The citrus/acid was very refreshing.  The fish and calamari were both very tender.  It was one of our only non-oil-drenched dishes.\n- Carnitas ($15.50): Table favorite.  I thought the flavors were only ok.  The pork was a mixed bag-- some was fork-tender while other bits were really dry.  I adored the pickled items (jalapeno, onion, carrot) and the cabbage slaw.  Yum.  \n- Chilpachole de Jaiba y Pescado ($15): A brothy soup that ended up being super fishy.  Not a huge fan.\n\nOVERALL: The complimentary almond butter cookies that came with the check were a nice, sweet touch.  Total came out to $27/person (including tax+tip).  Seemed kinda hefty for the amount of food we got, although to be fair, I think we were all stuffed and ready to burst at the seams (didn't stop us from going to Humphrey Slocombe later though haha).

You do pay for it, esp considering the meager portions of some dishes (I didn't try the quesadilla, but it looked pretty thin for $8).\n\nWe made the big mistake of sitting at the counter facing the kitchen during rush hour, and it was _stressful_ watching the whole operation on full throttle for 40 mins while we waited for our food. They seem way short staffed to handle a full dinner crowd & an unrelenting stream of orders from the take-out window, and it was nothing less than chaos in the galley - shouting, dropping/breaking things, hastily prepared dishes, sweating cooks....I felt exhausted when I left! \n\nI'd like to come back when it's not Sunday night, and I think if you order the right things, it can still be a bargain bite - the fish taco for $4.5 w/ a sizable fillet was pretty filling, as was the tamale.

No, no, no. I mean the totopos weren't bad but I would have rather tried dishes that stood apart from the average chips and salsa spread...my 3 dining companions agreed...\nPanucho de Pollo al Pibil - One of the best plates of the night. Basically it was a corn tortilla stuffed with black beans and topped with shredded chicken and salsa.  The chicken was super moist and seemed to have some kind of citrus sauce on it.\nCeviche verde - Hands down the ceviche made the meal. Bits of halibut and calamari were marinated with lime, cilantro, tomatillo and avocado. It was tart and tangy but not painfully acidic. I've eaten many a plate of ceviche in Mexico, Peru etc. but still think that Nopalito's version may be the best I have ever tried. Yum.\nMole poblano con pollo - Good but not nearly spicy enough. Maybe time for the chefs to take a trip to Oaxaca to pick up some more spices? I would have also liked a bit more chocolate in the sauce. And I am not a fan of dark meat so how about serving the plate with a chicken breast instead of a leg?\nPozole rojo - Delicious version of one of the hardest Mexican dishes to make. The broth was not too oily and quite fresh. I am not a real fan of pork but it worked with this dish and was tender and flavorful. \nCantaloupe popsicle - Fresh cantaloupe frozen on a stick. Need I say more? My bf ordered a Cafe con Leche popsicle - quite rich and creamy but yes, just like a nice cup of coffee with milk. The third option was chocolate with chili...\n\nAh and like others mentioned, you cannot make a reservation for Nopalito.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-03-01", "description": "Nopalito, run by the successful Nopa team, has failed to hit the mark. \n\nDrinks:  Most of us ordered the Michelada ($4.50), a refreshing beer concoction mixed with tomato, chili de arbol, a healthy rim of salt, and a lime. The waiter praised us for our risk taking, which surprised me, in that the drink, a cerveza preparada, or prepared beer, is a common Mexican beverage (that they actually got right). Even the major American beer companies jumped on the bandwagon with the (I think grossly failed) Miler Chill and Budweiser Chelada. \n\nWhen we finally got a seat, outside on the patio, well over an hour later, we were given their toasted chickpeas, which are on the house, a wonderful amuse bouche which provide delicious crunch and flavor. If anything, these are one of the best things that they do here, and I could eat them all day long.\n\nAfter handing us the menus, and most strongly recommending the Carnitas ($14), the waiter headed back to the kitchen as we made up a game plan to try as many dishes as we could. When he came back to us, he profusely apologized but they had run out of carnitas, their signature dish!\n\nWe started out with appetizers, tasting the Totopos con Chile ($4), their home made tortilla chips, chili de arbol, cotija, with some sour cream, which were slightly oily, but made better by a healthy squeezing of lime. The Tamal de Frijoles ($4) arrived looking like a dessert, wrapped in a corn husk, made with homemade masa, and a squeeze of sauce and a grate of queso fresco. It was good, but somehow lacking in any sort of punch. The Ceviche ($9.50) was not a success, the small dish of rock cod was served in a delicious lime sauce that had completely failed to infuse in the fish (a sure sign that the fish had not been allowed to marinate for the hours that a traditional ceviche is given). The result was a slightly tasteless and overpriced dish, completely overshadowed in taste by the oily chips it was served with.\n\nThe two appetizer success stories however were the Ensalada de Repollo ($5), a lovely cabbage salad with carrots, pretty watermelon radishes and oregano, in a nice acidic dressing, and the Quesadilla Roja con Chicharron ($9), served like a crepe, with a red pancake like corn tortilla, filled with crispy pork belly, which was delicious.\n\nAfter a less than successful round of appetizers, we had higher hopes with the main courses. We started out with the Birria de Chivo ($13), goat stewed in a nice sauce of dried chilies, roasted tomatoes and spices, served with corn tortillas, and pinquinto beans and salsa de arbol on the side. We were instructed that this dish was one of the do it yourself assembly dishes, and so we poured everything into the pot and went at it. It wasn't a bad start, although I'd probably not order it again.\n\nAfter a few minutes of waiting, we received our next dish, the Enchiladas Placeras ($13), a breast and drumstick of pan seared ancho chicken breast, which arrived with two tortillas that had a very small amount of potatoes, and carrots inside. The dish did however come with a pickled pepper which was delicious. Another put it together dish, the chicken was absolutely delicious and beautifully cooked, but like an all star pitcher playing on a team of seventh grade boys, had very little backup.\n\nWe were still hungry, and our last dish seemed to be taking some time in the kitchen, so we ordered a trio of Gorditas de Picadillo ($4.50 each) to tide us over. The gorditas, little  tortilla pockets were filled with ground beef, carrot and salsa, and while the meat was nicely seasoned, the bland and oily tortilla, and lackluster sauces failed to fulfill us. \n\nFinally, our Barbacoa de Borrego ($14) showed up, steamed adobo lamb tied up in a package made of banana leaves, with a bowl of consomme with a few chickpeas in it, and a side of salsa borracha. We were instructed that we could just put everything in the soup bowl, although after tasting the consomme and the sauce, I had my doubts about the flavor compatibility. Nevertheless, we combined everything and doled it out in another round of the small corn tortillas. It just didn't do it for us. The lamb was cooked well, but the flavors seemed mismatched, and worse, bland. \n\nBy the end of the meal we were all still slightly hungry, and although they served complimentary cinnamon cookie bites at the end, a few well chosen desserts might be a useful addition to the menu. \n\nTo be honest, two of our party went out after the meal to get drinks and burritos in the mission, and we went home and microwaved a bowl of swedish meatballs. For a Nopa sibling, Nopalito just doesn't seem to get it. Mexican food is about big flavors, heaping portons, and a lot of love. Americanized Mexican is fine in my book, but Nopalito has a long way to go even at that. Let's hope that they can work on these dishes before it tarnishes the wonderful work they are doing at Nopa.", "author": "Samantha T."}

Servers are friendly, but a bit off. \nThe menu small, and not described well. Dishes are arranged with appetizers on the left, entrees on the right. The reason I knew this was the prices of things. There was no telling what any given dish came with as a side, which is fine if you're not in a ravenous mood. \n\nOur radish salad, we were told was big enough to share. It isn't. With fresh, bland cheese, chili powder, radishes and mandarin, this salad was off in it's flavors and textures. \n\nThe fried chickpeas are just what I love, crunchy, flavorful and fried. Yum. \n\nCeviche was also a good choice, comes with homemade tortilla chips - I'll let you know since the menu doesn't. Ha. I broke their spell. The seafood was tasty in it's lime broth and I was happy with the avocado topper that made it a Green Goddess of a Grouping. \n\nNo hot beverages, so don't ask for coffee or tea if you don't want to be rejected. Some of us are fragile, and to you my sensitive sallys, I beg - do not order anything that would promote steam. \n\nLet me mention the cutlery. It was nice, with a heavy feel. Remember this Kids, for later in the reivew.\n\nThe service was good, but a little funky. Like the chickpeas were brought after our \"share-able\" salad and the topper for me; the waitress was expertly stacking all our wares when I felt a silver bump on my head. She had dropped my fork on me - and kept going like the Champ she is. I know she didn't realize it, but did I need to leave with a concussion AND a confused stomach?? \n\nI won't be back, flavorings need a bit of help and the feel just isn't there.

You can call ahead to have your name put on this list, which is great because there always seems to be a wait. There's parking in the Falletti's garage. They have an outdoor seating area which is, for the most part, enclosed. The decor is clean & cute. The flavor of everything I tried was great!\n\nNow the negatives. The parking situation is a bad thing for Falletti's as I've already had a difficult time parking to do my shopping on multiple occasions. The portions are SMALL!!!!! I went for lunch and paid $11 for enchiladas mole. All that was on the plate was 2 tiny enchiladas. They tasted great, but for 11 bucks can I have some beans or rice too? The prices range from $4 to $16, so a normal size meal would be $20 or more (tapas - order 2-3 plates per person). My server was really nice, but not that great. What I ordered as an appetizer was forgotten and came out well after I finished eating. \n\nSo, I will give it a couple more shots and hopefully change my rating to 4 stars at some point.

It was a busy Friday night and we were told the wait would be about 30-45 minutes. Standard fare. We went to the bar and I ordered a margarita. Blech. My boyfriend ordered an iced tea, which came with an agave nectar in a bottle, but not just any bottle. It looked like what I imagine miracle hair-growing tonic was bottled in in the late 19th century. Besides the bottle being eye-roll inducingly contrived,  isn't agave syrup not really good for you? More fructose than high-fructose corn syrup... uhh... I'd rather have some real sugar.  But I digress.\n\nTwenty minutes later and a table opened up. Score. At this point I'm two Winter Red Wine Sangrias in and feeling pretty good, the hair tonic bottle and the shitty margarita becoming fuzzier and fuzzier memories. Looking at the menu, everything looks so good. I finally settled on the Carne Asada y Cebollines a la Plancha. Boyfriend got the same. The food arrives and it's plated beautifully, but right away I know this isn't going to be enough. \"Oh,\" I think to myself. \"This is one of those places.\" I should have figured that out by looking around at the other tables, but my attention was elsewhere. I'm no stick, but I'm not about to have my own Discovery Health channel special either, so if these portions weren't enough for me, it probably wouldn't be enough for most people. The black beans were SO TASTY, but they were just a pretty, tiny plop on the plate. I thought about reaching over and stealing my boyfriend's beans, but by the time I conjured up that ingenious plan, they were gone. You snooze, you lose indeed. The carne asada was cooked perfectly--maybe too rare for those who prefer their meat well done, but I enjoyed it. For dessert I went with the cafe con leche popsicle, which arrived unassumingly enough but when ingested, quickly brought back memories of a five-year-old me stealing my mom's coffee when she wasn't looking. Like another reviewer said, there's no ladylike way to eat these delicious frozen confections, so just go balls out. Who cares if you look like you're ten cents a dance? I ain't gonna judge. \n\nSo why only two stars? Because it's bougiefied Mexican food and that burns me to my core, like a tiny flame of inexplicable resentment.

We left the house a little later and arrived at about 8:10, and again were told about 20-30 minutes, but that the bar was full and so we would have to wait outside.  In the rain.  We strolled around Falletti's for a while to grab some dessert for later (sorry Nopalito, you lost out on that purchase), and checked back in at 8:30.  Still no table, and several groups in front of us.  15 minutes later, my friend decides to ask if we can now move into the bar.  We were given permission to get a drink, so wander in, and wait 10 minutes before someone asks if we need something.  We ordered a pitcher of margaritas and some chips and salsa.  The margaritas came about 5 minutes later.  But no chips.  Another 5ish minutes pass and we watch as someone delivers our chips to two other groups (each time removing them) before finally realizing that they were meant for us.  We got them, they were delicious.  At that point, frozen pizza would have been.  Finally, around 9:10, the table that was supposed to be ours opened up, and then sat there.

Its namesake, in my opinion, is one of the best restaurants in San Francisco, and while I wasn't looking for a duplicate experience, I had hoped that the quality of Nopalito's Mexican fare would match Nopa's New American. \n\nWe called ahead to claim a spot on the waiting list - the predicted hour-long wait ended up being closer to two, which is not a huge deal except that the host was a total tease (just one moment...almost there...a little longer...). The patio would not be a bad spot to wait on a warm night, but it was cold so we hovered near the space heaters at the entrance. The host took drink orders, though, so I suppose that's one way to stay warm. \n\nThe seating is limited, so if you're a party of two odds are you'll be seated at a communal table. Our waitress was pleasant, if somewhat forgetful - we had to ask for water and the complimentary fried chickpeas. \n\nThe appetizers were a major disappointment. First off, the fish taco (singular) was severely lacking in flavor, which is a serious crime against fish tacos specifically and Mexican cuisine in general. The rustic corn tortilla was great, but it was all I could taste - the skimpy piece of fish needed some spice, and the whole thing was begging to be slathered with salsa, guac, something! The ceviche was likewise underwhelming ...fine, but not what you'd expect from Nopa's progeny. \n\nThe entrees were an improvement. My lamb was tender, the sauce was delish, and it came with more corn tacos - plus I love the DIY approach to eating. The only component that didn't work was the bowl of broth with a few chickpeas floating in it - not interesting enough to eat on its own, and it didn't contribute anything to the lamb tacos except to make them soggy. My friend's chicken with mole sauce and rice looked good, but didn't elicit the mmms and oh my gods that a dinner at Nopa invariably does. \n\nOne last complaint and then I'll shut up - the glasses (or more accurately, mini ceramic cups) in which the wine is served are tiny!! As someone who loves a boozey dinner, I don't want to have to down ten cups of wine to get a buzz.  \n\nThe cinnamon Mexican cookies were a lovely way to end the meal, but I wish there had been more of them. Overall, underwhelming, but Nopalito is just a baby...let's hope greatness is in its genes.", "author": "A M."}

It's another thing altogether to wait that long and then get served mediocre food.  And yet that's exactly what happened.  \n\nThe carnitas had little flavor and were very greasy -- like oily pot roast.  The \"sangria\" may be made in house, but that's all that can be said about it.  It tasted like tap water with red food coloring in it.  It's hard to maka sangria have no flavor, even when using cheap wine, but somehow Nopolito did it.  It's equally hard to make bad carnitas -- pork butt fried in its own fat is usually flavor heaven.  But not at Nopalito.  They bake oily pot roast without any seasoning and call it \"carnitas.\"   Hint to the chefs:  add some salt to your pork, ditch the paper bag gimmick, get some lard, and fry up some real carnitas.  \n\nThe one thing that was actually good was the roasted corn salad.  Everything else -- from the tostada to the tamal -- was mediocre at best (and that's being generous).  i don't think we'll be back.

We have been devotees of Dona Tomas in Oakland's Temescal neighborhood for several years, but now that Nopalito is open we haven't needed to travel across the bridge for an authentic Mexican food fix. \n\nWhen you are seated, the totopos con chile are are great way to start while buying time to ponder the menu -- tortilla chips, salsa de arbol, cotija cheese, crema and lime. And if they have the strawberry sangria, grab an order before it's all gone. \n\nWe usually order a mix of appetizers and entrees, and then share with friends. The adobo fish taco with orange, tomatillo, and ancho is a slice of heaven -- it's an upscale Veracruz style with an outstanding balance of citrus and heat that doesn't overpower the sturgeon. The pork tamal with mole verde is also outstanding -- housemade masa, stewed pork, poblano peppers, jalape\u00f1os,  tomatillos, cilantro, epazote, sesame seeds and peanuts.\n\nOther standouts include the squash blossom quesadilla and the radish/citrus salad. I'm quite fond of the pozole, and if you want to share the waitstaff will bring extra bowls, limes, and a ladle. The boyfriend adores the chicken mole poblano, and I admit it is lovely -- they make their mole from scratch and it tastes wonderful (most Mexican places use a pre-mixed mole paste as their base -- you can buy it in any shop in the Mission). And everyone loves the carnitas.\n\nNOTE: if the only Mexican food you know and like is the Mission-style burritos or rice-and-bean plates on cafeteria plastic, don't bother with Nopalito. This is authentic Mexican, based primarily on Oaxacan regional style with other regional touches showing up as well.

Each time I stop in and eat (or pick up), I'm treated with friendly service and get constant check-ins to make sure I have enough agua or totopos con chile.  Each of their entrees has a different flavor that's emphasized; thus, my palate never tires.  And little things, like spiced chickpeas and a free cookie at the end, gives your experience a nice touch.\n\nLast but not least, the price is very reasonable (you can order a dinner for $5, but $10 will more appropriately satisfy your cravings), but this isn't really fast-food, Green Burrito territory - so it probably won't meet your requirement if you don't want to spend more than $3 for a dish.  These entrees are fluffed up with fresher ingredients and are a little more on the untraditional side in the Mexican genre; but obviously, someone who was craving the gritty, greasy flavor of a taco stand would have headed to the Mission - and if not, that's just poor common sense.\n\nYum!", "author": "Caitlin M."}

Well, you won't get much farther than that as noh-pah-lee-toe's new offerings. Everything feels like a better version of whatever Mexican you may have tasted before. I recently had the privilege of eating an amazing Barbacoa de Borrego, its simple and honest presentation already advertising its delicate flavors. My wife went for dual appetizers (tapas' style) of Gorditas de Picadillo and Ceviche Verde de Pescado... Despite their familiar names and ingredients, they were all surprisingly delicious. \n\nThe portions are prudent enough to leave you with a satisfied yet un-regretful finish. I also went for Michelada, which for any self-considered lover of beer is a road that must be taken: I will push your preconceptions of what a beer goes well with. It is served chilled, with salt, lemon and a generous dash of Tabasco sauce (They skipped the traditional ice cubes no doubt to push the limits of propriety).\n\nWe ate in the patio, and despite San Francisco's chilly night of winter, we were comfortable enough with the overhead heaters. The service was prompt and friendly. The unisex bathroom was impeccable (although it takes a walk around the block!) and the parking plentiful. They had interesting touches like napkins resembling traditional rags. Unfortunately they have no desserts... something I hope they correct as no doubt they are bound to be spectacular.\n\nThe pricing was fairly affordable and even generous to the quality given, so the only caveat I can say is that they take no reservations and seem to be in high demand almost any evening. It takes a good 30 minutes wait in the cold (they will serve you drinks while you wait though). You actually sign your name and leave a phone number, so you can take off, and for example, buy yourself that post-dinner treat in the wonderful Delessio Market & Bakery next door.

We have been anticipating the arrival of Nopalito and sadly, since we live in the South Bay (not for long!) we haven't had the opportunity to try it yet.  Until today.  \n\nI was pleasantly surprised in so many ways.  First, it's much larger than I expected.  I remember walking by the space many times and thinking, this is going to be a tiny little burrito bar.  But it's not!  I LOVE that they created the outdoor space and it's gorgeous.  The decor is clean but fun and I love the live plants.  \n\nThe food is really good, of course.  I'm used to leaving Mexican joints way over stuffed and feeling greasy.  Noptalito serves just the right amount, doesn't fill you up on chips before your meal, has refereshing beverages and an amazing salsa.  I had the green one and I loved it.  The dish was also clean, a good size, and almost felt healthy.  Gasp.  \n\nI'm happy for you guys!!!", "author": "Rachel C."}

The first-come first-serve thing is a bit of a hassle, but they seem to have the system down.... it's a cute restaurant, though it can be noisy.  \n\nAnyway, on to the FOOD.\n\nWe had halibut ceviche (delicate and tart, with creamy avocado), the totopos con chile (crunchy, smothered in crema), tostada de tinga (this was astonishingly savory and delcious), ensalada de repollo (good, nothing special), enchiladas de mole con pollo, and the quesadilla roja con chicharron (both very good). The horchata was AMAZING, the hibiscus-valencia orange not so much.   I think the whole thing may have been worth it for the horchata alone, seriously.\n\nAnyway, very very very good, reasonable price, and pleasant, cheerful low-fuss atmosphere.  It's perfect for a brunch with a couple of friends.  We will definitely come back!\n\nAlmost forgot... the most hilarious part of our visit was that I had seen the waitress passing several times with trays of small golden pastry balls of some sort and I became irrationally convinced that they were teeny churro balls!  They turned out to just be cookies... we were so sad.  The waitress got this very bemused expression on her face when we asked and was like... churro balls... that's brilliant!

A group of four of us went to try it out, and the experience started off quite well with their call-in waiting list.  They gave us an estimate of about 45 minutes, and when we showed up 45 minutes later, we got a call from them to let us know that our table was ready -- Perfect!  \n\nWe ordered lots of things on the menu, so much food that the waiter kinda gave us a friendly face of disbelief.  We ordered two chicharron quesadillas, the black bean tortilla, the gordita, the ceviche, two orders of carnitas, and an order of chicken mole.  The carnitas were amazing -- a little bit of crispiness on the outside but very tender on the inside, and not very much fat.  The black bean tortilla with chicken and onions had a very nice late kick to it.  The ceviche was very fresh.  The mole had a very nice flavor to it, and the chicken was very tender -- it maybe could have used a bit more spice, but I definitely liked it a lot.  \n\nSadly, the dish I was most excited about -- the chicharron quesadilla -- was probably my least favorite dish.  The ratio of tortilla to meat was a little bit high, and the strong tortilla taste hid the saltiness of the pork belly a little too much.  It had some very tasty bites, but was not consistent.  \n\nThe only other drawback to Nopalito was the fact that they don't have a liquor license.  They serve beer and wine, but I stuck with the non-alcoholic drinks.  The citrus drink was very good, although the menu description made me think it was more like an agua fresca than the carbonated drink that was served.  The almond horchata was also really good, except that I think it was $4.  \n\nOverall, it was a GREAT dining experience, and we are all looking forward to going back to try everything else on the menu!", "author": "Pilan C."}

The worst part of it all is that after a couple bites we decided to tell the backwaiter what we thought of the food.

They also were $14 and were kinda bland. nothing special. \n\nI should have told the frontwaiter also, but honestly just felt so oppressed there at that moment, feeling the bourgeoisie of gentrification in san francisco. \n\nAll in all, the food was expensive, not new, exciting or even authentic.

We tried the Totopos con Chile with cotija cheese and crema on the side. very good and spicy. The Ceviche was fresh and loaded with fish. We ordered the Quesadilla de Hongos y Huitlacoche without cheese...it was alright but really needed the cheese. The Taco de Pescado al Pastor was AMAZING, by far the best thing I tried and worth going back for.

I love all the natural light that comes into this building, as opposed to the shadows cast by the tall buildings of the  Financial District\n\nIf you're gonna try something with a group, definitely start with the totopos - pretty delicious and actually pretty filling.  Carnitas are also plentiful and delicious.  There were a couple things that made this place well worth paying a little extra for and one of it was the home-made corn tacos that came with.  You gotta love tacos that are jagged on the edges and asymmetrical. The cabbage salsa and pickled veggies were a nice accent to go along with the carnitas.  I also had their hibiscus blood-orange juice - that was okay at best for me, as I was looking for something a tad sweeter.  The second thing that made it worth a little extra for this place is serving sparkling water free of charge!  More places need to do this.  \n\nIt was a sunny leisurely day in San Francisco, the wait staff is super nice, the wait was short for us and the food was very good, so I left completely happy.  Parking is also very easy in this area. The bathroom's a little weird since you have to exit to get there, but it's got the most powerful hand dryer in the US and a cool sink, so consider it even.\n\nIf you're deliberating this place, just try it.", "author": "Tsubasa O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-03-11", "description": "I went to Nopalito last night and it was cold.  I live on the other side of the Panhandle and it is almost always cold at night.  WIth the exception of a few nights a year, this is a foggy neighborhood.  In the summer the fog rolls in from the sea and gets trapped in between Lone Mountain and Twin Peaks.  I mention this, because I am wondering why the good folks at Nopalito thought an outdoor section would work at night in the Panhandle.  \n\nI forgot that you can call ahead and put your name on the list, and at about 7pm on an ordinary Tuesday night, there was a short wait for a table.  It seemed like their staff was working hard to get people seated.  The problem is that if you wait outside in the cold and then have to sit in the outdoor section, you are still going to be cold.  Sure there is a covered space with heaters, but there is also a big open window that lets all of the cold air in. \n\nI am only complaining, because I like Nopalito and want them to succeed.  It is ran by the same people who own Nopa, and I am sure they will work things out.  On a nice sunny afternoon their outdoor section will be a cozy place to have a bite and enjoy the weather.  When I had dinner there last night, it was just too damn cold.  This is San Francisco after all, when is it ever warm at night?\n\nOtherwise, the menu looks great and the food was solid.  I would have liked the portions to be larger, especially the appetizers.  I had the gordito something and the pescado taco, which are about $4.50 each.  You only get one of these items per order, which is a little disappointing.  I know a lot of good taquerias where you can get two tacos for $5 and be totally full.  Of course, Nopalito is catering to a different crowd, but they are serving Mexican food.  For an entree I shared the Pozole with my companion.  Our server told us that it was like a stew, but when it arrived it was more like soup.  When I saw it on the menu, I imagined that it would have big chunks of slow cooked pork that you could eat with tortillas like tacos.  Sadly, in the Pozole I ate, there were a few tiny morsels of pork.\n\nI am looking foward to going back to Nopalito and seeing how they adapt to the neighborhood.  I think their to-go window will be a really nice addition to the restaurant.  Until then, I will not be back to Nopalito after the sun goes down.  In the meantime, I will trek the extra five minutes to Valencia and eat at Regalito.", "author": "Ezra Y."}

Yanni made us some awesome drinks and worked with us to make them perfect.  So delicious.\n\n3) We brought in our own desserts for a dessert buffet.  The staff helped us set everything up beautifully.\n\n4) We had many friends and family telling us that this was the best food they've ever had at a wedding. =)  [Granted, they might've been saying that to make us feel special! hahaa]\n\n5)  In addition, folks came up to us during the reception to say how sweet and nice the servers and bartenders were.  They went above and beyond to make the experience amazing for us and the guests.  (Including making sure the bride and groom had a full plate of food to eat without prompting.)\n\n6)  Behind the scene prowess.  The chefs had some electricity problems in the kitchen during set-up.  The team took care of everything and made sure that it wasn't an additional stress on us.  Seriously, I didn't really know what happened until after the event.  I'm sure Allyson was responsible for that.  She was great at making everything happen.  \n\nThank you Allyson, Laurence, Yanni and the entire staff!!", "author": "Cat B."}

Initially I wasn't too hopeful about my experience because outside the entrance (which I had to search for) was a \"sign up sheet\" for a table, but no host/hostess to be found. Not sure if this was to emit a \"hey we're so casual around here, we don't need that type of structure\" attitude, but it was odd. Nonetheless, we signed our name and put a time and crossed our fingers someone would notice we were there. \n\nAfter about 20 minutes, we were seated by a cheerful gentleman. At this point in my eating career, I've given up being self conscious about the large volume of food I order when trying a new restaurant. I have embraced my inner fat kid. That being said, we proceeded to order about 70% of the menu to sample. \n\nHighlights definitely were the Totopos con Chile, the Gordita and the Taquitos.

You can call ahead to be put on the list - but that list gets long at peak times. The wait for a table on weeknights has grown to 45 minutes and this past Friday our party of four waited 90 minutes. While I can't blame a place for being popular - note that there is no bar to wait at and no other place to sit in the vicinity - so you may be spending a lot of time browsing the grocery store next door and drinking wine in the parking lot and trying to stay warm (which is what we ended up doing.) \n\nThe food is quite good, obviously. Maybe the only Authentic-ish interior Mexican cuisine in the City. The food is not fancy but instead typical cantina fare like carnitas, polo mole, and birria.Yes a lot of taquer\u00eda in town have these dishes, but the quality, flavor, and presentation here is more like what you would get in Mexico. The prices are reasonable considering the quality and novelty. \n\nOne of my dining companions ordered beef enchiladas and she was presented with a plate of rather tough and flavorless carne asada and a little paper bag of fresh corn tortillas. That's it. That does not constitute \"enchiladas\" anywhere in Mexico I've visited, but maybe they serve a regional variation I'm not familiar with. In any case it was a disappointing dish. Another companion got the mole which just had a small leg and thigh. It was yummy, but I felt should have been a bit more.\n\nService was relaxed but decent. So I guess I remain torn on Nopalito. I love that there is a place to find these flavors in San Francisco, but the food has been inconsistent and waiting so long for a table is kind of a bummer.", "author": "David C."}

Once half a large table was available, the hostess seated us, thinking that the other group would leave within about half an hour or so.  Half of my group sat down and we ordered a Margarita pitcher and we were gonna wait until we could get the full table before we ordered our food, since we were there for a birthday.  The other group ended up staying and ordering their own pitcher, so the estimated half hour turned out to be TBA.  Instead of telling us that we would need to get seated somewhere else, the male host, told us that we would need to order and eat our food now even though only half of our group was seated or get up and wait.  So, we told him we don't mind getting up and waiting for a full table to be free, but we still had a nearly full pitcher that we would need to finish and we weren't allowed to take the pitcher outside.  So he left to \"try\" to figure it out and 10 minutes later a bigger table opened up and we were seated.\n\nI guess my main complaint is that we were essentially being asked to get up for doing the same thing the group next to us was doing instead in reverse order (Ordering drinks before the food instead of vice versa).  \n\nAnyway, it'll be first and last time I go to this place and it's not that much of a loss to be honest with you.", "author": "Joe N."}

Next was the Esquite Tostado; toasted sweet corn with queso fresco, chilie lime and pico de gallo; that was pretty kick ass as well. So then comes my Enchiladas Placeras; enchiladas stuffed with squash and potatoes and pan seared chicken breast. I was confused by this dish; I wasn't expecting the gigantic piece of chicken breast to be accompanying my enchiladas.

There are positives and negatives about their reservation system, but as long as you get it you're golden.  Really how many places let people do drop in reservations anymore.  It's sad to say, but if you want to go out for a date, or do a spontaneous dinner in SF, you should have booked in advance.  This is why I like Nopalito's system.  It's smart and simple, but you actually have to think an hour in advance for food (which I have no problem doing).\n\nOnto the food:\nIn a word excellent.  I've always been a foodie for latin cuisine (I happen to think I make the best pico de gallo) and Nopalito has it dialed.  The appetizers are in short yummy.  Seasonal Sangria, mmmm....  But what I love most is that they have goat stew!  There are few places that would serve anything but the usual, beef, chicken, lamb, and pork.  To see goat on the menu, is amazing.  After all Americans are the only prude nation that is prude sexually and nutritionally.  Nopalito follows a local in season menu, so things change through the year.  I'm also a huge fan of chicken mole, which they do beautifully.\n\nYou can consider Nopalito a fancy Mexican restaurant.  You really don't get the quality of food that they serve at a local taqueria, so you really can't compare the two.  But, you can compare it to other places like this restaurant (Regallito in the mission, Andele in SFO an OAK airports).  This is a class or restaurant like Delfina.  You can't put Delfina in the same class as Dominos would you?\n\nSo, appreciate creativity and you'll love this place.

I grew up with mom's homemade tortillas, tacos and pozole and this restaurant is the most authentic Mexican food I've ever had. I took my parents to dinner here and observed their facial expressions intensely as they tried each dish. There's no one who is a better judge than my mom who's been cooking mole her whole life. It's  one of the toughest dishes to master in all cuisine's, period. She gave the nod of approval and I've been raving about it ever since. I've had nearly everything on their menu and these are the dishes that stand out:\n\n1. Carnitas (juicy on the inside crispy on the outside)\n2. Tamale (Comes pretty darn close to my Tia Lupe's)\n3. Crispy pork belly quesadilla (need I say more???)\n4. Mole (perfect spice to nuttiness ratio)\n5. Pozole (hangover cure according to my dad. It's a spicy soup with hominy, meat and about 15-20 different spices)\n6. Beer with the tomato juice and lime\n\nThey're prices are very reasonable and they serve homemade tortillas. My only recommendation would be to offer another tamale flavor.  For the vegetarians out there a cheese + jalapeno would be nice. Or even a tamale with mashed potatoes inside or the hard-to-find SWEET tamales (raisons and pineapple), YUM!

I'm talking sizzling-fresh carne asada, heaped onto a mound of outta-the-fryer french fries, drizzled w/ cheese, sour-cream, guacamole, and salsa-- for $4.)

The food's well-portioned (in the middle of our subsequent food comas, we realized that Nopalito's entree plates are deceptively BIG), delicious (if the mole doesn't make 7x7's \"100 things you've got to eat in SF\" list next year, then I have to question their research team), AND-- believe it or not-- 'lito's keeps it real.  Not real like Taqueria Can-Cun street-style; but real like what I had at the sit-down restaurants while I was living in central Mexico.  What I'm saying is, even if it's not dirt-cheap; you get what you pay for here, in terms of quality AND quantity.\n\nThe wait for a table's reasonable (we waited maybe 15-20 mins for a table for two on busy a holiday weekend), the entire staff is super-professional (the hostess was great, the cooks were friendly and on-top-of-it, and the wait-staff was so attentive, we never even had to ask for our water glasses to be filled); and, hey, it's right next door to Faletti's, so if you feel like it, you can go next door afterward and stock up on some groceries so you can cook your next gourmet meal at home :)", "author": "E R."}

We still had the lunch menu because the dinner menu doesn't come out until 5:00 but the food was still amazing! It was a group of three of us, we ordered the quesadilla Chicharon, totopos, cheese and green chili tamales, carnitas, and three drinks. The total came out to about $60. The quesadilla was pretty delicious but a tad greasy, the tamale my husband said was really good (he's very picky!) , the totopos lived up to all the yelp hype and the carnitas, which included fresh tortillas and a type of coleslaw were juicy and tender without all the fat and grease you usually find in Mexican restaurant carnitas. The totopos comes with a delicious lime sour cream to dip it in which we also put on our carnitas. The service was excellent! I read a lot of reviews on here with unhappy customers because of the service so I was skeptical about what type of service I would find but our waitress Mary was very attentive and gave us lots of advice about the amount of food we should order and what type of taste we should expect from each dish. The rest of the staff looked in on us as well even though Mary had us handled. I can't wait to go back again! Definitely worth trying :D", "author": "Cristina G."}

The food is good and my husband and I have had great experiences the two times we ate here.  The first time was at lunch sometime after the grand opening of the restaurant in 2009.  I found the prices to be a bit high at that time but I was eager to try it.  I was very hungry so my enchiladas (you don't get rice & beans like at a traditional Mexican restaurant) did not fill me up.  However, I stopped caring how hungry I was when two reality stars from Top Chef sat at a table about 5 inches from us.  (I get star-struck really easily.)  We struck up a conversation about the current seasons's Top  Chef contestants.  Now, I'm mentioning all of this because we had excellent service that day.  Coincidence?  Read on.\n\nThe second time we came here was on my birthday, just 2 weeks ago.  We came for dinner.  The service was great and the waitress was very attentive.  I have a very sensitive taste for spicy foods -- btw, why does every restaurant nowadays use chipotle for everything? Okay back to Nopalito -- the waitress offered to tell me which selections they could make less spicy so that I could enjoy my meal.  (Normally I just chug water but if you get bad service, you don't get much refilled water.)  They refilled my water glass constantly so I was a happy camper.  Anyway, we ordered the Taquitos to start.  I thought they were really full of flavor.  I ordered the Empanadas.  For a food item that is normally greasy, I thought they did a good job.  I couldn't even finish my plate!  I didn't know I was ordering two large empanadas. My husband ordered the Carnitas, probably the best item on the menu -- I tried them and YUM!  I had the Sangria, and it was VERY flavorful and delicious.  Mmmm.  We decided we're coming back to share Carnitas and Sangria.  I love trying new items but their Carnitas sang to me!  P.S.

Yes, hungry! And - heaven forbid! - if you ask for salsa, you'll get a little scoff (from an otherwise very pleasant waitress) and, if you're lucky, they'll provide you with a tiny cap full of salsa (not sure if they realize, but tomatoes and peppers are sort of cheap - you'd think they'd be giving it away or something). \n\nBut (!) I do love their beverages -  the serving pitchers of ice tea and the handy bottle of simple syrup? The horchata? And the canned Tecate?

First off, this place is tiny and in SF and popular.  So hence no reservations.. makes it a tad difficult.  They have a call in wait list.  So I call at 5 pm to be on the \"wait list\" for 7 pm.  They tell me that I need to come at 7 pm with my whole party and then thy'll tell me how much longer we have to wait... I just don't see the point of that.. the point is so we Don't have to wait?.. anyway so we were extra early and as promised, they did have our table ready about 10 min after 7 pm.  Unfortunately, our whole party wasn't there yet.. hence we could not sit down.. =(... minus 1 star.. they came after another 10 min or so.. and we also had 2 people in our party said they were going to be late so we did not assume they would need to sit down for dinner...  Getting seated and ordering took so long due to the very very slow service.. that by the time we Just ordered our meals, the other 2 people were here already ready to leave for dessert..  What's worse is that they would not accommodate the other 2 people even if we said we would squish our whole party on the bench and only requested 1 additional chair.  I saw plenty of chairs lying around but the manager refused to give us one...mind it was well past prime dinner time already.. like 8:30 pm.. OK.. minus 1 star.   onto the food.. their lemon ginger lemonade was OK.. a bit toooo gingery if you ask me.  the chips were actually decent and kind of unique tasting.  Seems like they are double fried chips coated with some salsa sauce topped with good cheese and sourcream.  The entrees:  the mole was NOT good.  It tasted Burnt to me ! mole does have some elements of burnt chocolate, cinnamon and dark flavors.. but this one literally tasted like they burned the sauce.  the rice had absolutely no flavor at all.. it was SO bland i had to add a ton of salt for it to taste like anything remotely good... the chicken was OK.. donno why they kept the soggy skin n it.  at least if the skin is on the chicken, it should be crispy.  The lamb was so dry!... the sauce was OK though.. however it did not make up for the small portion of lamb or the dryness. minus 1 star.. in addition, our waitress wasn't the most pleasant either.. she hardly came to check on us and took forever to take our orders and to give us our check.  The fact that we had a child at the table probably didnt' help the situation either.  All in all, the only saving grace for this place was the delcious complimentary cookies at the end of the meal.. otherwise, I don't think I\"ll be coming back here for mexican.. i'll go to the taqueria down the street for a 1/4 of the price. !", "author": "Margie C."}

I had heard such good things about this place, so perhaps I experienced it on an off night, but it must have been a WAY off night. \n\nI went with three friends for our monthly dinner outing.  We waited over 45 minutes for a table on a MONDAY night (which is fine, except that I SWEAR they seated another party of 4 ahead of us when we were next on the list---also a forgivable oversight except that 50% of our party was visibly pregnant---the pregnant ladies just want their food, damnit!).  We ordered three apps (did I mention two of us are pregnant?), including the totopos con chile (basically soggy chips with a meager sprinkling of cotija cheese), chips and guac (not on the menu, but pretty good), and the quesadilla azul de hongos (basically a folded over blue corn tortilla with under-seasoned mushrooms and a hint of cheese).  Had we left it at that, I would have given the place a C+. But it declined from there... \n\nThen there were the entrees.  First of all, it took almost 45 minutes AFTER the apps for them to bring out the entrees, which seems a bit ridiculous in such a small place.  Amongst the four of us, we ordered the Enchiladas, the Pozole, the Pescado, and the Barbacoa. Let me break it down: \n\n1. Pozole: this rated a solid C. The chips that come with it are too big to really put in your soup like proper Pozole. There was a decided lack of meat in the dish, and it overall seemed kind of lackluster. \n\n2. The Pescado: a small-ish piece of fish that was probably still the best of the entrees, but nothing special. \n\n3. The Enchiladas: terrible. Or at least terrible if you're expecting traditional enchiladas.  Here's how they come: two dried out, bland \"enchiladas\" with no sauce, barely a hint of queso fresco, and spartanly \"filled\" with potatoes and carrots (nothing else).  But seriously, NO sauce (the tortillas were slightly red in color, so maybe they had sauce at one point), and none of the melted cheese that makes enchiladas so delicious.  The chicken breast that comes with the enchiladas is off to one side, completely separate from the enchiladas. The enchiladas themselves were luke-warm and super dry. Ugh. \n\n4. The Barbacoa: My poor friend who ordered the barbacoa! It sounds so great in theory, but it comes as this completely disjointed dish. There is this stew bowl on one side, then some other random sauce, and then the banana leaf with lamb inside. But when my friend opened the banana leaf, she found a whole mess of bones and fat inside.  Not a whole lotta lamb.  So she asked the waitress if this was normal, to which the waitress replied, \"Well, all of our meat is really fatty which it what makes it tender.  As for the bones, sometimes there are a lot of bones, sometimes there aren't.\" To her credit, the waitress offered to bring my friend something else.  So my friend swapped the barbacoa for the enchiladas. Oops. \n\nI really wanted to like this place, and Michael Bauer's review gave me such high hopes! Alas, I'll probably give it one more try, but the first meal there was so utterly disappointing that I don't think it will make it on my top 20 list, as I had hoped.", "author": "Bess K."}

I thought that was very kind of her.\n-I love the extension of the building.  I like that there are heated lamps which is suitable for the cold gloomy days in San Francisco.  Sitting and eating watching the rain fall.\n-We ordered the Almond Horchata, torta, and the machaca.The almond horchata did not taste like a horhcata.  It tasted like a nutty soy milk.  I thought it was good, but I was expecting more cinnamon.  The torta came with fries that were very fresh.  The torta was very delicious.  The machaca was recommended by the waitress.  It came with black beans and the egg mixture with shrimp you eat with a corn tortilla.  I thought it was light and tasty. \n-Overall, I thought nopalito was good.  I can't say that the food was as good as Nopa.  But, you can't expect nopalito to be on that level.  It has a more laid back feel to it.  I plan to come back and try there other dishes like the totopos and end with some blue bottle coffee.", "author": "Joanne H."}

Don't get me wrong, I like fancy (Gary Danko is one of my favorite).  So I was willing to see how their fusion-Californian spin would turn out. I was not entirely impressed.  I got the Totopos, Tamal de Frijoles etc., and the Mole Poblano.  Totopos = overpriced chips; Tamal = dry and bland, I have had better from the Civic Center tamales truck; and Mole = tasty but not good enough to write home about.  \n\n2) Price and portions: I do not feel like I got my money's worth.  Portions are small, which is fine if the food is uber-fantastic but per point #1 above, it wasn't. So I was kinda annoyed at the prices.\n\n3) Over-hyped.  I live above this restaurant.  I come home everyday to see tons of people crowding around in front of Falletti's and Peet's waiting for a table. Now that I have tried the food I can honestly say I would never wait as long as these people do.  The guy who manages the waiting list (short, dark hair, I think he manages the place), not very friendly and kinda stuck up.  Please, take that stick out of your bottom.\n\nDecor is very nice, restaurant is very pleasing to the eye.  But, I'm there to eat, and my mouth and stomach both vote to not go back, even if it is convenient as hell to eat there when my lazy-ass doesn't feel like cooking.\n\nOnly reason I am not giving it a two is because the food isn't bad.", "author": "Helen C."}

The things that make Nopalito more than a Mexican joint with a bunch of food buzzwords are the quality of the ingredients and the precision of the technique. I've had a lot of dirt cheap Mexican (and love it!) but you cannot tell me that the pork in your street carnitas is anywhere near the quality of what they're serving at Nopalito (roasted en papilliote! genius, I have to try that...). What's more, the seasonings are bold enough to satisfy but clear enough to allow higher-quality ingredients to speak up. I've also had a couple of the beef dishes and they're similarly well-executed. Prices are high if you're expecting Mission taqueria food but pretty cheap compared to similar restaurants.", "author": "David Y."}

We were seated surprisingly fast, but sadly next to the door of the patio so people were constantly walking by.  Nice atmosphere, though a little on the chilly side for me (I'm a wimp, though...).\n\nI liked that they keep it real and serve tecate in a can.  Friends ordered the carnitas and the enchaladas - looked good, though the portions were a little small.  I'm cheap and love cerviche, so I ordered that and tasted my other friend's soup (caldo de res ala pasilla).  Like I said, I love cerviche, so it's hard to find fault in that for me.  It was soaked in lime and served with thick corn chips.  Couldn't really taste the cod through all the citrus, but that didn't bother me so much.  Did like that they served it with avocado to cut the acid a little.\n\nThe soup had a nice spicy broth and lots of veggies floating in it.  Tasty, but not very filling, it seems.  Actually, the soup seemed forgettable as my friend forgot there was a piece of chicken in it when asked if she liked it later on and then also finished the soup and bought a bbq sandwich on the way home.  ouch.\n\nOverall, the food is good, not great.  And for the price you're paying, not really worth it.  But, that's just me.  Nice to be trendy for a night, though.", "author": "Leslie G."}

Yes, this is a yuppie, over priced mexican food establishment. You'd be better off going to Tacolicious for similar style, Little Chihuahua or better yet the Mission. We came during the week for lunch so the place was not busy and our service was relatively friendly and fast. Prices were decent for appetizers but not so much for drinks and entrees. I ordered a michelada and the potato taquitos. I really wish chips and salsa came with your meal rather than fried chickpeas. My taquitos were good but they weren't what I was expecting. They were a rather small portion, granted they are on the appetizer side of the menu. The potatoes were also not mashed like I've been accustomed to at delicious San Diegian eateries like El Zarape. The potato-chile mixture had flavor, and was complemented by some crema and cojita cheese, and maybe 2 tablespoons of guacamole. I really like the mexican wedding cookies that came with the bill. The food itself was good but Nopalito doesn't really strike me as somewhere I'd eat often.", "author": "Cori W."}

While Nopolito does not have the most vegetarian friendly menu in the city, they are extremely accommodating!  While we were looking at the menu, the waiter asked what we were in the mood to eat and we told him that two of us were veggie--he said no problem.  He asked if we were ok with the chef (Gonzalo Guzman?) picking out our dishes, and we said sure.  Well, here is what we had--\nFresh tortillas off the grill with salsa--I love that!\nTaquitos de Papas--small but yummy!\nQuesadilla de Primavera--I am not a huge fan of a ton of veggies in my quesadilla's but this was very well made.  I would order again..here anyway.\nVegetarian Enchiladas Verde--not on the menu but delicious!\nSparkling Wine with Housemade Fruit Juices--yum!\n\nOur experience was great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-04-08", "description": "I've been waiting to go to this place for sometime with some hesitancy because I really like tapas and/or mexican food and I'm really particular and their menu proposes a more lofty version of mexican food which makes me question whether they actually can make it better than regular mexican food.  Strating off the staff were nice and I liked the general decor.  We order margaritas and they were good, yet over priced at $9 a pop.  Still, with a slightly modern decor this price is too be expected in SF where food is often priced on decor rather than quality. We ordered Ceviche Verde de Pescado y Calamare, Tamal Oaxaque\u00f1o de Pollo, and Gordita Campechana.  \n            The ceviche was alright.  I have a friend from Mexico who makes his own ceviche and this tasted very similiar to his, but the sauce was a little bit more dull and the fish not as flavorful, but this ceviche was still decent and I would order it again.  \n         The Tamal is not your usual tamal, so I fought the urge to compare it to the tamlie lady's.  This tamal has a thicker, grainier consistency which I liked, but the mole sauce was unholey.  To me Mole is sacred when made correctly and this one lacked refinement and made me want to get up and go somewhere else. The chicken under the tamal was dry.  The score for this dish--1.5.  An interesting tamal does not save the day.  Sorry.  \n          The gordita was tasty.  definately the best dish, but a little heavy with the oil at a place trying to show refinement.  \n        My favorite part of the entire meal was actually my complementary mexican chocolate.  It was really amazing, I just wish the food I paid for made me feel the same way.\n\nSummary: My actual score for this place is 2.5, but they rounded me up.  I would not recommend going here if your looking for anything special.  I would probably only recommend going here if you were walking by the place and you were hungry or if you were tired of the other restaurants in this neighborhood.  If this was regular street food at a decent price I would give it a 3 max, but because this place is trying to show refined mexican food and increasing both food and drink places to reflect the refinement of their establishment, I have to say, \"Nopalito, you are not all that.\"", "author": "mick H."}

We also had the sturgeon fish taco that I liked because it had a spicy ancho chili and chipotle-tomatillo salsa on it. What made this taco different was the soft crisp shell and being topped with an orange. Among other dishes was the torta that I enjoyed, verde chorizo with avocado, cabbage, onions, and queso fresco (mexican cheese). The thing that makes a torta is the bread and the did it well, housemade bun that was nice and soft.\n\nThings that we really didn't enjoy were the quesadilla de hongos y huitlacoche that seamed to be a little weak in flavor - needs some work with that veggie dish.

I really enjoyed the atmosphere.  It's decorated very interestingly.  I liked the curtain of hot chocolate mixers in the back.  The menu was very diverse.  It was hard to choose what I wanted to try.  I ended up with the tamal dulce and the enchiladas de mole.  Wow!  Both were outstanding.  The mole was just like the mole I had when I was in Oaxaca.  The service was very nice too.   I will definitely go back  to try their dinner menu.  The only thing I didn't like was the bland mexican wedding cookies given with the check.  Over all, a great place!  5 stars!", "author": "Pixie D."}

I also tried a lemonade flavored with bergamom that was especially delicious. Oh and the dessert was REALLY good, a dark chocolate fudgsicle that was pretty much the best dessert I've ever had.

I recieved a call saying that my table would be ready in 10 minutes.  I walk over only to be told that there would be a 45 minute wait... 45 minutes later, I was told the wait would be another 30 minutes.

To make it worse, a group that showed up after my party arrived was seated ahead of us.\n\nThinking this was just a fluke I went back but I had a repeat performance with the same hostess.  It's not that she is unpleasant, she is just terrrible at her job and does not know how to manage a crowd.

Nopalito does serve micheladas, and it was alright; but I was looking for something more. My friend liked it, but he had never tried one before. I told him I could probably make a better one at home.\nOn the other hand, the rest of the food was fantastic. We ordered the Totopos con Chile as an appetizer. The cotija cheese shaved on top made the entire dish. Usually you'd just get nachos with a spicy salsa to dip with. These already had a salsa on the nachos and it comes with sour cream to dip with. Delicious!\nAs a meal, I ordered the ceviche. I was impressed with the ceviche, as that has been another hard thing to find in the city. The marinated cod was fresh and had just the right amount of spice. My friend ordered the Quesadilla Roja. At first glance it seemed a bit small (he's a big eater) and didn't have any side dishes.

The bebe and I met my friend Aimee there a few days ago for lunch. Following the advise of other Yelpers, I called an hour ahead and gave them my name and to let them know that I was bringing in a stroller. And what?! It was a great surprise to find what that the complex has parking! Yay! \n\nAimee and I decided to half share everything so that we could try more things. We started off with the esquite tostado con crema y queso. The corn was sweet and spiced slightly with the chile and pico de gallo. It reminded me of the elotes (or corn on the cob) that you would get from a street vendor. It was absolutely delicious! Aimee ordered the ceviche verde which came with tortilla chips perfect for scooping the calamari and fish out of the bowl and into our mouths. I ordered the quesadilla roja con chicharron. Anything with pork is good! And although pork is the other white meat, this quesadilla was dark and luscious with the chile ancho tortilla and the crispy pork belly. To wash everything down with, I ordered the hibiscus-valencia orange drink. It was sweet, fruity, fresh, and perfect to compliment the spiciness of our meal. Lastly, we shared their chocolate and cinnamon popsicle for desert. How decadent and kid-like at the same time! \n\nThe staff was very friendly. The location is perfect (with parking).

It was obvious the pork had been cooked for a long time and the meat was super tender and easily pulled apart. Came with a tangy cabbage salad and corn tortillas which were tasty as well. My only gripe is that the portion is kind of small for $15. I guess we did manage to create three hefty tacos out of it which comes out to $5 a taco but still....

But  Nopalito exceeded my low expectations, by a lot.\n\n1.  Reservations--Called to put my name on the list while we were at a bar in Lower Haight.  The hostess said, \"So like, 45 min to an hour?\"  I said, \"That would be perfect.\"  And lo and behold, as we were walking up the hill on Haight approaching Divis, I got a call from Nopalito, saying our table was ready.  We literally walked in and sat down.  Sweeeet.  Did I mention it was a Friday night?\n\n2.  Service--Prompt, efficient and friendly.  We ordered a pitcher of sangria, and the waitress accidentally brought just only one glass of sangria.  Instead of taking it back and bringing the pitcher, she left us with the glass to share while they made up the pitcher.  Very nice.\n\n3.  Food--The totopos could have been more cheesy, less spicy, but were a nice departure from the usual chips and salsa/guac.   But the highlight were the enchiladas.  Yummy, yummy.  I usually prefer green sauce, but the smoky, mole-esque red sauce here was mighty fine, especially when complemented by the cotija cheese.\n\n4.  Prices--Very reasonable.  I was surprised.  We probably could have spent less than $20 per person (maybe not incl. tax and tip) if we didn't drink so damn much! ;)  (Oh, btw, they didn't charge us for the extra sangria.)\n\n5.  Ambiance--Noisy but not an overwhelming vibe.  We were seated at a communal table, which could be annoying if you don't like your tablemates, but I liked chatting with the folks next to us.  What can I say, I'm a talker. \n\nOverall, a surprisingly nice experience.  I would give it five stars, but it's not Dona Tomas on Telegraph in Oakland, which holds the highest place reserved for gourmet Mexican in my heart.

I've been to Nopalito several times since they opened and really liked this restaurant. Our friend arrived there before us and put our name on the list, we were told we had a 30 min wait. When we got there, the host told us it was very full inside and didn't want to let us go in to the bar. We said we had a friend already waiting and walked in. Then we encountered another staff person who also said the bar was too full and we shouldn't come in. I said we at least needed to tell our friend we were there. There really was was space for us at the bar with our friend and we ordered a round of margaritas. At that point things really went south. We waited for 45 min and saw people who arrived after us get seated before us. When we asked, the host said we would be seated next and she was sorry for the mix up Then a nice table cleared up and we thought we would be next but they said we couldn't sit there because a table with children was coming in. That party arrived and had NO children with them. When we asked what was going on, the staff said the party had told them they had children but then turned up without them. We said, then fine, call them on it and give us that table. They said it wasn't their place to call people on things. We finally said we'll sit at the bar but at least comp us something for the long wait and putting other people in front of us. They basically said no and they didn't care that we had been treated poorly. We paid for our drinks and walked out. Although Nopalito is popular and the food is good, there are other places in town in the same range that are equally as good if not better. I will never go there again due to the terribly poor service. I wish it hadn't come to this as I love their food and have so many good memories there.

It is a dis-jointed mess of a place.\n\nFirst off, I am a mexican-aholic and I guess this restaurant  is trying to be \"modern mexican\" which I can go with, but the food was small and marginal and unauthentic.  No free chips and salsa at the start which is always expected at a mexican restaurant , you just get a weird and really small dish of  dried garbonzo beans supposedly dusted with cayenne and spices--- but they lacked any flavor or spice and dried our mouth out.  Bleh!!!!\nThe food we actually ordered was very greasy! the starter we had,  cerviche, seemed like it had been marinading so long in citrus that it was thouroughly \"cooked\".   Food overall  lacked flavor and spice--very gringo and  quite tasteless and bland, bland, bland.  Also, please dump the \"small plates\" concept.  It does not work here especially when even the \"large plates\" are so small...this is insulting and misleading and makes for lots of disappointment.\n\nBeverage choices non-existant in the alcohol area, one choice of red, white and rose wine each.... and they ONLY have a beer and wine license which means, NO margaritas.... sad.   I was served the one choice of white wine (chardonnay, which was awful) in a tiny toothbrush holder type of cup made of rough pottery, gross!   I asked for a glass, because that is just tacky.  They do have glass in Mexico.  I have had many beverages served in all types of glass there paying 10% of these prices so I didn't feel I was being snooty by asking for one--- although I still didn't get a wine glass.\n\nAnother one of the many turn-offs and disappointments here is that the seating  is all \"communal\" for the most part , unless you want to wait for a table on the front porch which is outside.   The communal seating at that is very, lets say, \"cozy\".  Hey, I don't even know these people, I  certainly don't want to sit at a table with people and hear every word and feel awkward about talking to my companion sith no sense of privacy.  They tried to cram us between two couples on a high table and stool with no back, we refused and opted to wait for a table at least on ground level with real chairs.  There would have been no elbow room without impacting others at the tall table so we waited for this table for an hour on a weekday night.  Unfortunately, even the coveted tables are so close that the converstation from the table next door was distracting.   Prices too expensive for this, the food, the lack of hostess/  \" write your own name on a list \" hanging outside.\n\nService was ok, they asked, but what can a waitress really do when the whole concept of the restaurant from top down is wrong???  Hard to know where to start to complain ...When asked, I just sent the waitress away with a sad smile.... Expensive and a bad experience.  Don't go.", "author": "Anibel B."}

And I had no idea they serve organic foods, which upps its cool factor.\n\nUsually restaurants as miniature versions of its older siblings aren't as refined. I'm glad to say that the decor and set up of this place is fun if not encouraging for more of a sociable time than its sister restaurant. For example, both inside and outside cute wooden benches and stools with high tables which makes the environment less formal. We went during the evening and the inside was very well lit. Outside seating was a little more dim and chilly because of the weather, but the heat lamps helped. I can see this restaurant being a really good summer spot.\n\nAttention is also paid to little details of the decor. I love how they served our wine in little clay mugs, probably similar to the effect of drinking vino in Mexico. Cute. I had their  syrah, which wasn't as full bodied as syrahs I usually drink but it went well with the dishes we ordered.\n\nGood service. Our waitress was very attentive and came back several times to see how we enjoyed our dishes. Even a different waitress who served us our drinks chatted with us because she caught a part of our conversation.\n\nWe ordered\n[panucho del pollo al Pibil] deep fried tortilla with black beans, chicken, bay leaves cheese and onions. I'm glad I ordered this because the flavors went together really well. I just wish we received more than just one. \n[totopos con chile] homemade deep fried tortilla chips flavored with refried beans cheese and lime. I've never had anything like it before- a bit heavier than your regular chip. I liked eating them with some of the other toppers we ordered, like the\n[Ceviche Verde de Pescado] translates as Green Fish Ceviche! I thought this one was okay, the taste of the lime was a bit overpowering. The fish was good. The rock cod they used had a good strong consistency that stood out and didn't become runny with the sauce of the ceviche. \n[Carnitas] Also really really good with the totopos. I love the way these were prepared- not greasy and full of flavor. Came with a chile verde sauce that brought out the taste of the carnitas. Soooooo yummy!\n\nWe finished off the meal with polvorones that our waitress brought us with our bill. Sure beats a dinner mint! They tasted even better than the filipino kind my people's bring back from the motherland as souvenirs after trips. Hollerfront.\n\nIt tends to get busy, so if you can call in advance. There was just two of us, but we had to call an hour before on a monday night. One more thing about this place that I like: there's lots of parking!

Didn't have to wait too long for a table on a Wednesday evening - we had not called ahead. Plus we were served the delicious seasoned roasted chickpeas while we waited for our table.  The atmosphere was really great - warm and friendly. And there's a lovely heated patio for additional seating.\n\nEverything on the menu sounded delicious so it was difficult to choose.  We did order the highly recommended Totopos con Chile to start and the dish did not disappoint - note it's a bit spicy which makes it all the better! I couldn't decide on an main dish so ordered two small plates - Taco de Pescado al Pastor (Seared fish in adobo, chile ancho, orange, onion, cilantro and salsa de morita y tomatillo) and Panucho de Pollo al Pibil (Black bean stuffed tortilla, citrus-achiote chicken, cabbage, pickled red onion and salsa habanera).  The Taco de Pescado al Pastor was good but a bit dry and I didn't care for the coarn tortilla it was wrapped in, I probably wouldn't order it again.  But the Panucho de Pollo al Pibil was outstanding. I recommend it if you want something light but surprisingly filling.  I love small plates, so I recommend taking a risk on a few in place of one main course.  Also ordered by friends were these main course dishes: Carnitas, Enchiladas Placeras and Mole Poblano con Pollo.  They all seemed very happy with their orders - clean plate club.

Mainly, Nopalito is a Mexican modern execution to Nopa's American modern.\n\nAmbiance (4): The place is nicely set up and there is lots of wood all over the place including some nice wooden tables and bench setups. Modern, warm, and very inviting. Wide open layout and the only thing missing would be to have outside seating. They have some covered seating which is nice but no direct sunshine.\n\nFood (4): Authentic fusions, if you will, with lots of traditional ingredients but with that American touch. We had the sweet pumpkin tamal which was great, simple and well executed. You get the hint of traditional corn tamal but can definitely pick up the pumpkin. The ceviche was good but it didn't go well with the chips which were too thick and salty and overpowering the subtle flavors of it. It was still good but I prefer it more limey. The totopos were ok, but maybe too far from the original and not enough fresh cheese action. The carnitas were amazing. Perfect, perfect, perfect. Just make sure to scarf them down while hot, that's when they are at their peak. They get served with traditional corn tortillas, a damn good slaw, and a green tomatillo salsa which I wish was the one they used on the totopos. The horchata was good, but they need to get some hot drinks in that place for when it's chilly outside.\n\nService (3): It was ok. Very little personality though.\n\nValue (5): The pricing of the small plates are spot on and the large plates are decent. We only had one large plate and it was worth every penny, but can't vouch for the other ones.\n\nOverall: Food was great, price was good, heading back there soon.", "author": "Alvaro H."}

I was worried it would be really crowded given it's recent write-up in the Chronicle followed by a spot on the Chronicle's Top 100 list. But when we called ahead at 5:00 PM, there was no wait.  We got there about 5:45, street parking was easy, and we had a choice of tables to sit at. About 15 minutes later all the tables were gone, and traffic on the street had picked up, so I think we timed it perfectly. \n\nFor drinks, my friend and I ordered a Tecate with a salted lime. We had  no idea what to do with the lime so we plopped them into the can. Then I found this explanation: http://www.ehow.com/how_2110218_drink-tecate-mexico.html. Even though we didn't follow these directions, it was still a good beer.\n\nTwo of us are vegetarians (I eat fish, she doesn't). The waitress helped us navigate the menu and explained that the kitchen would also make a vegetarian version of the enchiladas (not an option on the menu). We didn't end up ordering them, but they sounded pretty good. On the right side of the menu are small plates that you can mix and match and on the left are dinner-sized entrees. I went with the small plates and got a fish taco and a mushroom quesadilla. Overall the food was delicious, especially the mushrooms and the corn tortillas. The fish taco was a little bland for my liking, but still very fresh and tasty. For dessert, they gave us some interesting cookie-like-ball.  As soon as I popped it in my mouth it felt like I was trying to eat a ball of saltines filled with peanut butter. The taste was fine, but  you are hereby warned to save a sip of water in your glass if you plan to consume this, otherwise you will feel like that poor dog in the old got milk commercial.\n\nAround 6:15 a small crowd had formed outside and I started to feel a bit like I was inside a fishbowl, people peering in, eyeing how much food was left on my plate (downside of the outside seating). As mentioned in other posts the bathroom was indeed hard to find. You have to exit the front door and walk around the building to the \"To Go\" entrance. Even then it was not labeled but I saw a \"vacant\" sign on the door handle which was my clue.\n\nOverall good food and good prices, but would recommend going for early weekday dinner if you don't like the wait.

We arrived and were seated at the bar which in my estimation is the best place in the joint to sit. The place was hopping on a Friday night and the guys in the kitchen were at full speed but the chatter seemed upbeat and friendly. A good sign. \n\nThis was a whole different scene than Nopa. This isn't a place where you're going to spend an evening getting together with friends for a few drinks and a leisurely dinner. Rather this was a place for the food...authentic, sustainable, organic...all the right words. We sat and perused the folded paper menus. Wanting a drink, there is no bar service and the wine selection is a red, a white and a rose. That's it folks. The beer menu is obviously where your attention should be focused. They have four drafts and six or seven bottled selections. I went for a Michelada which is a combination of a tomato paste concoction with chili del arbol, salt and lime added to a draft beer. I'd never seen anything like it. Throughout dinner I never really made peace with it. I'm glad I ordered it but don't know that I'd order another. Along with the drinks we were served a small dish of seasoned, fried garbanzo beans. These aren't what you might think. Think about an airy flavorful bite...almost like what a corn nut should be. We asked for a second dish. I should have brought some home. Yum.\n\nFor starters we ordered Quesadilla de Acelgas (corn tortilla, erbette chard, jack cheese, caramelized onions, queso fresco and cilantro salsa) and Ensalada de Repollo (cabbage salad, carrots, radishes and oregano). Both were awesome. The quesadillo was crisp and the salsa was spicy and really fresh. I wish I'd ordered another. The salad too was super fresh with large thinly sliced discs of pink and white radish. All good,\n\nNext came the entrees. We ordered Carnitas (long braised pork, orange, bay leaf, cinnamon and beer...cabbage salad, pickled jalapenos, tomatillo salsa) and the Birria de Chivo (goat stewed in dried chillies, roasted tomato, spices, chocolate, pinquinto beans and salsa de arbol). Let me start by saying that Carnitas in SF...it had better be good since there are plenty of places to go for it. Here is was considerably better than good. It was fantastic. Crisp on the outside, moist inside, steaming and not too salty. Pretty damned perfect. The goat? Well...not quite as successful. There was too little meat and the broth it was served in was bland. Trying to assemble the ingredients in a corn tortilla led to a mess and it all fell apart. I think this one needs to be rethought.\n\nOur server, Miki, was damn near perfect. Service all around was snappy and friendly. It's obvious everyone cares what the customers think of Nopalito. I really enjoyed it. In a few months I expect it to be even better. Highly recommended.\n\nBTW...unlike Nopa, parking is easy.", "author": "Gary C."}

Little sister to nearby Nopa, it is also a tiny space that doesn't take reservations, so be prepared to wait or order from the takeout counter at the entrance on the side.  Or you could call ahead and put your name on the wait list....\n\nFood:  3 stars.  For upscale Mexican, the prices are relatively cheap so we tried alot of different things.  For starters, we tried the totopos con chile (tortilla chips topped with cotija cheese served with salsa and crema), gordita de picadillo (served with grass-fed beef and refried pinquito beans), panucho de pollo al pibil (black bean stuffed tortilla with citrus-achiote chicken, pickled red onion and habanero salsa), quesadilla azul de hongos y huitlacoche (with mushrooms, corn truffles, jack cheese and queso fresco) and naranja y cebolla con chile, limon y queso (salad of grapefruit, blood orange, pickled red onion, chili, lime and queso fresco).  My favorites were the quesadilla azul and panucho, both are so freakin' good.  The tortilla chips are crisp and spicy (one of my fellow diners was so enraptured by them I had to stop my conversations to eat some before they were gone).  The gordita was okay and the salad was average yet would be refreshing on a hot day.  For the mains, we ordered the pozole rojo (stewed pork shoulder with hominy and ancho chile), carnitas (served with orange, bay leaf, cinnamon and beer with cabbage salad), mole poblano con pollo, barbacoa de borrego (steamed adobo lamb in banana leaves), enchiladas placeros (with pan seared ancho chicken breast) and birria de chivo (goat stew).  My favorites dish was the goat stew (the one I ordered, of course), followed by the enchiladas placeras (juicy, tasty chicken) and mole poblano.  I thought the pozole rojo was nice, but didn't have that much pork, while the carnitas and lamb were a litle on the dry side.  For dessert, they serve different flavors of popsicles (chocolate/cinnamon, lime and blood orange), all delicious and refreshing (at least the citrus ones).  We also ordered some housemade beverages for dessert - the chile chocolate milk, which was spicy but a little chalky, and the organic almond horchata, which was nice.\n\nService:  5 stars.  Service here is top-notch for a neighborhood eatery.  They do a really good job of managing the wait list and providing everyone with reasonable estimates of the wait (even if you don't like what you hear).  Our server was super, super friendly and well knowledgable about the dishes (including recommending the goat stew and panucho).  Even when things go wrong, they right the ship pretty quickly.  My friend got up to use the restroom and it was actually fortunate that she did.  The server that cleared the table dropped a few plates exactly where my friend would have been sitting.  A little bit of food spilled on her purse, but they were quick to offer her a free voucher to get it dry cleaned.\n\nAtmosphere:  4 stars.  The restaurant has two rooms:  the trendy colorful inside space and the rustic enclosed patio (which is heated properly on cold days).  This place is great for people watching as there was definitely lots of eye candy on a Friday night.  There is only one bathroom (next to the takeout counter) with a very weak flush (hopefully you don't get an unpleasant surprise) and super loud hand dryer.  When waiting outside for your table, be careful not to block the way - you may get some evil stares from Falletti Foods shoppers or the residents from the complex upstairs.\n\nHits:   Quesadilla azul, birria de chivo.\n\nMisses:  What, no guacamole?  Also no reservations, weak toilet.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Nopa, Mexico DF, Maya, Mamacita, Colibri, Zazil.", "author": "Keith C."}

The robsut flavors demonstrate the care the Nopalito kitchen takes in preparing its food. \n\nAfter a trek from the Academy of Sciences, the Tecate in a can, topped with a salt crusted lime was just the ticket! Originally, I came thinking that I wanted to try the Pozole Rojo, but we were so warmed from the walk that we opted for the small plates. Started with the ceviche, fresh locally caught rock cod marinated in lime juice, cilantro, tomatillos, and jalapeno. It was served with hearty homemade tortilla chips. I could sense the corn flavor of the chips before the dish hit the table!  A perfect refresher after a long morning at the Academy. \n\nFor our entr\u00e9e, we each ordered the pork tamale, gf ordered the sturgeon fish taco, and I ordered the Panucho de Pollo al Pibil. The masa of the tamale seemed to be flavored with broth from the cooked pork, which impressed me because my mother does the same when she makes beef tamales. It helps to liven up the masa. My only complaint about the tamale is that I prefer more meat to masa ratio. That's how mom does it!  The sturgeon taco had a meaty flavor and texture. It was a generous portion and I especially liked the smoky heat of the adobo sauce. The panucho, served like a tostada, had a smear of mashed black beans stuffed into the corn tortilla.  It was topped with a slow cooked chicken which you could see was not manually shredded so much, but simply fell apart. This made for tender, juicy chicken. The pickled red onion added a slight tang which married well with both the chicken and the habanero salsa.  I like more heat than some, so I asked for a little extra, which I used sparingly. \n\nOverall, excellent food and attentive service made for a lovely dining experience.

The service was responsive and helpful with good suggestions. The Carnitas at Nopalito was terrific and should be shared by two unless you are a big eater. One thing I like is that they serve right through. I love late lunch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-10-03", "description": "Very, very disappointing, especially after the fact that my friend and I were in the Mission and could have had dinner there, but instead chose to go all the way out to this neighborhood to try Nopalito. What were we thinking?!?\n\nFirst off, it's ridiculous to wait an hour and a half for a seat at this place. We were told about an hour, which already would have been too much, but anything over that is just plain ludicrous! I don't understand why they don't take reservations. It's just masochistic of them to make patrons wait this long just to let them down.\n\nThere's nowhere to wait after you've put your name down on the list. You can wait out in the cold, dark SF night along with the dogs people tie up to the post outside the supermarket as they shop. Yeah, we sympathized with those dogs whimpering outside. Or you can perhaps wander around the supermarket yourself. There is a Peet's Coffee as well and truthfully we should have just picked up something to nibble on at either place rather than wait for a table at Nopalito.\n\nOnce we finally got a table, the waitress explained what they were out of. The menu isn't that extensive to begin with, so points docked for being out of items, one of which is the one that my friend had wanted to order. My friend also thought the waitress was a bit brusque. \n\nAlthough it was quite cold, some of their heaters in the patio-like area weren't turned on. We had to specifically request the wait staff to turn them on since we were afraid of freezing. The patio area is too open. It feels like you're eating under a tent. That might be ok on a warm day, but this is SF. How many such days do we actually get?? Shouldn't you want to shield your patrons from the elements? \n\nThe food was just ok. I had the mole and my friend had the enchiladas. Interestingly enough, her enchiladas were spicy (although neither of us remembers that the menu description aptly portrayed this fact) but the mole sauce was not. That's the opposite of what I would have expected. I've had better mole sauce at a hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint. I will say that the chicken was fairly tender. I think the food here is catered toward people who want a watered-down version of Mexican food. This is not authentic Mexican food and it's definitely not worth the price ($14 per entree). Way too pricey and I think the restaurant is hypocritical to market this place as cheap Mexican fare. That's a joke.\n\nSince it was a cold night, my friend wanted tea. No such luck, they don't serve that. Hmm, it tries to be an \"organic\" restaurant, but apparently tea is not organic enough for this place. Strange.\n\nThe set-up is weird as well. We thought it crazy that you had to exit the restaurant and go around to the take-out area to access the one and only bathroom. The larger eating area looks like a diner and I've already mentioned the drawbacks to the patio-like eating area.\n\nThe restaurant's website touts the free parking. Yes, they have about 10 spots in a lot in front of the restaurant, shared with all the patrons visiting the supermarket and Peet's Coffee. This means that you won't be able to find a space in the lot. Parking is also hard to come by in the neighborhood. Be sure to drop someone off in front of the restaurant to put your name down and then drive off to find parking. \n\nYou'll be waiting a long time to get in, so be sure you're not in a rush if you go here.\n\nOne star for the food at least tasting fresh and one star because there was cool, lively music playing throughout the evening at the restaurant (although, like the food, it wasn't Mexican either). It's sad that I have to stretch as far as giving credit to a restaurant based on its music selection.\n\nI won't be returning to this place. It doesn't have enough going for it to make it worth my while. There are so many restaurants in SF, that you can have a better dining experience elsewhere. If you're in the mood for real Mexican food, head to the Mission.", "author": "O K."}

I lived in Mexico last year, and I miss so much of the good food, but this is definitely a good way to keep the cravings down.  \nI went with some friends and we wanted to try a bunch of stuff so we ate family style, which I think is the best way since the plates are served solo, no accompanying rice or beans or anything.  This way you get full and variety.\n\nFood: \nCarnitas A+ soft and tender and with hot tortillas and a fresh salsa, you can't go wrong. sooooo good!\n\nEnchiladas Placeras A : The mole was really good, not too sweet and the serving of two enchiladas was enough for us to each get a bite\n\nQuesadilla with Huitlacoche A: I'm not a big mushroom fan, but the others really liked the combination of creamy cheese and this corn fungi\n\nTamal Enchilado A: This was a good tamal, not soggy and a little spicy, though I would have preferred the cream be left off the top\n\nCod Ceviche A+ : Oh man... I had never had ceviche of cod before, nor ceviche with salsa verde, and it was soooooo good. I wish I had ordered one just for me!\n\nSince they put a California Organicish flare on things, their menu changes with the seasons and what is availible locally.  I was sad that nopales (cactus) is not in season, so I will have to wait to get some of that.  \n\nDrinks:\nWe tried the Horchata - good, has a touch of almond\n\nJamaica/Habiscis - very fresh, nice with the blood orange and sparkling water\n\nThey have a list of local beers, and Tecate in the can.  Of course that's what I ordered... :) They also make micheladas, but with the local beer it tastes a little off, maybe request it with Tecate.\n\nOverall it was a great dining experience.  I enjoyed every plate that we tried, it was all very fresh, and though some things weren't 100% authentic, the California touch didn't take away from any of it.\n\nWe had great service as well.

After letting the chile sauce sit the chips become soft and dough like. Horchata is a great alternative to the standard traditional horchata we are all used to. The Carmel asada con chorizo plate was great the carne asada was cook perfectly while the chorizo was hot enough to make you wanting to go back for more. The home made tortillas were perfected and delicious. The chocolate ice cream was out of bounds. Our waitress was extremely nice and very helpful.

I have certainly had enough of the boring chips and salsa starter and will go for this any day!  I loved the salsa and shredded cheese.  None of it was over done.  We then moved on to a Gordita Campechana and Tamal Oaxaqueno de Pollo.  The Gordita was great, I could have eaten a few more.  I was less impressed with the Tamal  I felt that the majority of it was the masa, there was not enough actual meat.  The mole was just ok, it was not something I would order again.  We then had the Carnitas.  They were great, all components together were delicious.

The chips are actually tossed in the salsa and served with fresh queso and crema. Along with the spicy fried chickpeas, these should keep any customer occupied for a while. When more hunger strikes, if you are vegetarian, they will gladly make you a herbivore's version of the enchiladas (quite delicious), a very well made squash quesadilla (excellent in-house tortillas), and some really addictive mix of toasted corn, cheese, chili and lime.

Disappointing.\nOur food was greasy, greasy, greasy - grease dripping on the plate as we were eating. The tortilla shell our food was wrapped in was very hard and slightly burned (I really thought I was gonna break a tooth), the servings are tiny (we left hungry and broke), and it is pricey. \nIf this is the food they eat in Mexico - like the white waitress carrying a baby tries to make you believe - them all the people must be hungry in Mexico. By the way - not one Mexican in sight.\nOur dish was supposed to have pulled pork in it but it had only one small piece of meat - we sent it back and was given another which had slightly more meat but was still lacking and rather tasteless, and the cheese that was part of the dish was almost non existent and so finely grated that you could hardly taste it.   \nThere was nothing else on the plate - no garnish, no lime, no sour cream, no avocado - nothing, just the (small and expensive) dish we ordered on a bare plate.\nIf you want good Mexican food that is hearty, delirious and reasonably priced - do not eat here.

I will say it's kinda pricey for the portions but you could easily fill yourself up on a couple of the $4 small plates. Anyway, the totopos are amazing. A much better version of chips and salsa. Imagine your chips with spicy enchilada sauce baked onto them...and you dip them in what I guess is their version of queso fresco. We had the ceviche with avocado, the panucho de pollo (chicken on a black-bean stuffed tortilla), a quesadilla de roja, and the pork pozole (soup).

The open kitchen lets you get in on the action.

The Rock Cod Ceviche (Ceviche Verde de Pescado) was quite tasty.  I needed some extra tortillas to savor the sauce of the Birria de Chivo (stewed lamb).  The kick of habanero from the Panucho de Pollo al Pibil (citrus-achiote chicken) was washed down nicely with an Allagash White brew.  The plates are best if shared (in my opinion).

Everything is accented in green and the place has a nice casual feel. We opted to sit inside (rather than the heated patio) next to the kitchen so we were able to see all the food going out. The list of house-made drinks was so tempting - I wanted to order all of them. I ended up settling on the almond horchata which was sweet and addictive. My friend had the spicy Mexican coco - it was really rich like a milkshake but had a great spicy kick of cheyenne at the end. \n\nWe started with the halibut ceviche which was served with Nopalito's super thick tortilla chips. The ceviche was tart from the lime and seasoned well with cilantro. I ordered the carnitas. Now it wasn't cheap, but the reviews don't lie - this was some rad pork. As my hands were covered in pork fat and I was loudly praising the virtues of the heavenly pig, my friend reminded me how much I love the pork chop at Nopa and that perhaps I have a thing for pig done by these guys. The carnitas was wonderfully seasoned and shredded perfectly. I realized I was supposed to eat the slaw and tortillas that came with it, but a third of the way in I gave in to the temptation and just ate the tender meat. The rest of my dining company did not seem as thrilled by their meals (although everyone liked their selection), but maybe I was too blissed out in a porky fog to accurately assess the situation.

I'm not sure why this place it always crowded, especially when it's just as overpriced as Falletti's next door (which I want to love since I can walk to it, but I don't have the budget for the $2 markup on even kraft products). I wanted to love it, as I love Mexican food, and I wanted to like the oh-so-trendy shared seating arrangements inside. We had a drink at the bar while we waited for our table, which we ended up sharing with three other people, which wasn't all too bad. Except, the bathrooms are at the other end of the restaurant. Which you can't access from INSIDE the restaurant. It was pouring rain and freezing. Do you really want to get up in the middle of the meal, put on your jacket and umbrella and then wait in a three-deep line for the one-holer bathroom behind a crowded takeout corner? What planner approved that one? I was excited for the food when we got the appetizer, those thick-cut tortilla chips were really good. The salsa/sauce they were in was bland and only served to soggify their goodness. The albondigas were so unfortunate. The sides served with them were even worse. It seemed like no one had ever heard of garlic, cumin, chile, onion, or even . . . salt. It was like eating wierdly, creepily, dyed black meatballs made of rice and charcoal dust.

Really gets a lot of sunlight but doesn't get too windswept.  Nice colorful, no-frills decor\n+ CARNITAS.  This was absolutely delicious.  A very large portion of cinnamon/orange/bay leaf smoked pork comes with housemade organic corn tortillas, cabbage slaw, roasted vegetables and salsa for a make-your-own experience.  I was tempted to just eat the carnitas alone, it was so good, but I used up all 3 of my tortillas (and asked for one more since I had unwisely skimped on meat in my first)\n+ Hot sauce.  You have to ask for it, but I think adding the salsa molcajete to the tortillas gives it a great taste.  This salsa was hot, smoky and textured.  I got the habanero salsa puree too, but as warned, it was a little bit too spicy for my taste.\n+ The fried chickpeas served at the beginning were nice- I had to ask for mine, though other tables got them delivered instantly.  Might have been an oversight of my server.\n\nDrawbacks\n- Michelada (essentially a beer-based bloody mary).  I didn't love this as much as I thought I would.  Weird flavors and not as spicy as I was hoping, although quite peppery.  They do have a nice selection of beers on tap that I might get next time.\n- Menu.  I found the menu kind of confusing and needed to pore over it and talk to the server to understand.  I think one side of the menu are smaller appetizer dishes, while the other side are more savory but this isn't labeled or especially obvious (prices aren't too far apart).  Also, I didn't know what came with tortillas, etc.\n- Bathroom:  You have to go outside and down the block to enter on the other side of the restaurant to use the loo.  Probably outside their control, but makes for a slightly disjoint restaurant experience.\n\n\nI know others think that it is pricy, but I think it is fairly priced for the quantity.  It's only a few dollars more than Chevy's and the portions are pretty reasonable (and organic/ house-made).\n\nI would definitely recommend the place and am hoping to go back sometime soon.", "author": "Jeff A."}

She is Mexican (not just Mexican-American, but born and raised in Mexico) and is usually very reluctant about going to Mexican places as the food isn't very authentic, she says. Like previous posters have said, this definitely isn't authentic Mexican food--I almost feel that this is the P.F. Chang's of Mexican food (although it's not really a chain). None of the staff  appeared to be Mexican/Latino and none of the guests were either. When we tried ordering in Spanish the waiter had trouble understanding us.\n\nBut whatever. I think most people have gotten the idea that this really isn't a Mexican restaurant in the authentic sense. So that's not why I gave this place two stars. The main thing has to do with the quality of the food. It was okay--certainly eatable, not horrible. But if I'm going to pay $15 for carnitas that would cost $6 a few miles to the south in the Mission--they had better be superlatively tastier. My girlfriend order the tostada plate, which was acceptable but certainly not phenemonal.\n\nI guess it's all a matter of opinion. If ambiance and decor is very important to you, and you're willing to pay twice as much for mediocre food just because you're eating at a chic, stylish place--then you'll probably like Nopalito. Personally, I don't care that much how 'authentic' a place is, as long as its food tastes great. With that said, I don't really understand the buzz behind this place and will go to the Mission next time I want to eat Mexican.", "author": "Eric J."}

Ill give it two stars instead of one because other people have said its so good. \nMy girl friend and I went to go eat there the other night around 915 pm.  The place was crowded, but it looked like we got there just when things started to calm down.  There were about four parties waiting outside.  We walked in to put our names down on the list and the owner stopped us and told us they were not talking anymore names. When I observed that there did not seem like much of a wait, he said they had been slammed all day and were looking to close.  \nThe owner made two mistakes:\n1. a new restaurant should not turn away patrons that want to pay to eat there.  Especially 45 minutes before  closing (or five for that matter) and certainly not during a recession!\n2. You should never turn away patrons because you've been slammed.  Isnt that what you want?  Why is that the customer's problem?\n\nSo food issues aside, I think management needs some service training.  I have certainly worked at many food joints that I would have been fired for saying that.  \n\nI dont know if Ill ever go back to Nopalito, but I have certainly spread the word about my experience.", "author": "John C."}

I've been here a couple times before and both were delicious.  The first time I had a fish dish that was extremely flavorful and spicy.  I think I like this place so much because the flavors really pop - lots of citrus and spice.  I typically order a couple small plates - I love the fish taco as well as the achiote chicken small plate (topped with yummy pickled onions).  I have also been craving the consomme for some time now - my mom ordered it when she was visiting.  It was served in a gigantic ceramic bowl.  On the menu it sounded rather boring- a lot of veggies.  While it is, essentially, broth with veggies, somehow it turned out to be so much more!  The veggies really stood out - they were incredibly flavorful - it was as though they came fresh from the garden.  My fiance had the Pozole and despite the fact that I typically don't eat pork, I tried some of the hominy and broth and almost fell over in my chair - it was like the ultimate comfort food.  In thinking about it today I picked up some hominy at Rainbow so may attempt to make some myself.  Unfortunately, I don't think mine will turn out as good as theirs.\n\nI think the prices are decent here (I filled up on two of the small plates).  Main downfall is that the service is not top-notch.  Last time our server seemed pretty out of it and we had to flag her down multiple times.  I also wished they had \"real\" dessert (in my opinion popsicles aren't dessert).", "author": "Sarah F."}

Unfortunately tonight it wasn't to be.  We waited almost an hour and a half for our table as a mere two-top, and once we sat down and our food arrived we were completely underwhelmed.  \n\nI had the tostada with chicken and habanero salsa and pickled onions.  It was good, but the grease poured out when I bit into it, and it completely lacked seasoning.  It had an intense heat because of the habaneros, but I'm pretty sure there was no salt or pepper used on the meat.  I also had a blue corn taco with fried pork belly and queso fresco.  Sounds great, right?  Well, somehow it was horribly under seasoned and completely bland.  My fiancee had a fish taco that was similarly bland.  It was too bad, because the space was pretty cool and the service was good.  I especially liked the tecate in a can with lime and salt.  Ironic that the only salt I tasted tonight was in the beer!  I'll give this place one more chance because as I said, it has promise.", "author": "lars g."}

I love Mexican food, and go all over SF searching for the perfect blend of freshness, authenticity, and delicious taste. So when I heard about Nopalito I was very excited. \n\nWhen you read the menu it sounds perfect. Authentic spices, peppers, onions, garlic pork, avocado.....traditional Mexican dishes but with quality local ingredients. \n\nThe food however does not live up to the hype. The best tasting dish I received were the homemade chips - not a good sign. My enchiladas were undercooked, and while the sauce was nice, there was barely enough to coat the tortillas. There were four of us, and not one of us were very pleased with our dinners (unlike our experiences at Nopa.)", "author": "Sean R."}

My boyfriend and I wanted to treat my family of 9 to dinner and thought this would be a good place since they rarely eat Mexican food (since we're Chinese).  I called in two hours before our dinner to put our name down and when we got there it took us ten minutes to get seated, not complaining.  The reason I'm giving 3 stars though is because of the service and food.  Our waiter forgot people's drinks so the drinks came out in 4 waves.  Our entrees took about 30 minutes to come out after our appetizers.  Coffee took another ten minutes but our waiter forgot an order so he brought one then we had to wait another ten for the second, so twenty minutes for two coffees.  The food all seemed too similar and we ordered almost everything on the menu so that's saying a lot.  It makes me sad because I wanted this experience to be amazing since I was treating but it really disappointed.  Probably won't be going back even though I used to LOVE this place :(", "author": "Monique C."}

So I suggested we check it out being as Nopa is our fave fave fave restie in SF. (So far....) Anyhoo, they of course do not take reservations so we said no prob you can find us at the bar when the table is ready! We're easy to please. I had a margarita which was dece. I mean come on how hard is it really to eff up a marg? The wait time was actually fairly short and we got a table shortly thereafter. We ordered a few things randomly just to share. THE MUSTS: Ceviche (unfortunately we ordered this at the end of the meal as we thought we needed JUST. ONE. MORE.) it was the best though. Pork belly quesadilla is also a must. Although I will warn you it is very heavy and meaty! Yum-o-rama! THE EH'S: something on the rib (maybe pork, I dunno, I'm not such a big meat eater... that's what she said.) enchiladas. Too heavy. It was good but after having the pork quesadilla, this little lady had entirely too much meat at that point. THE I WILL TRY THIS AT DEL TACO: the fish taco. Yup, pass that one up.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-04-13", "description": "I decided to give Nopalito a second chance because Michael Bauer was so effusive in his review.  This time I was much happier, but still if I had to use one word to characterize the food here it would be:   dry!!!   Totally missing is any trace of lard, oil, fat, etc...all the things that generally make Mexican food so tasty.   It's a bit like eating food where all the moisture has been sucked out leaving fibre and not much else.  However, because the enchiladas I ordered today came with a mole sauce this defect was somewhat ameliorated and the mole itself was one of the best I have ever had on this side of the border.   So I will have to say I am now willing to endorse Nopalito with the caveat that you should make sure that you avoid items that suffer too much from the dryness syndrome.", "author": "David T."}

I'm not talking fat here, I'm talking undigestible misery. One piece and 10 minutes of chewing later I just gave up which isn't second nature to me, I'm a plow through it and smile kinda guy. The flavor wasn't bad mind you, just the meat. Bad meat. And I'll give them the benefit of the doubt on this one and not just because I'm getting married in Guanajuato next week, but  because I honestly believe that shit happens, meat goes wrong and cooks sometimes just don't care enough to notice (especially for take out).

It was totally different than what I expected. It came with a breast chicken on a side and two folded tortillas. Everything was dried, no sauce,no melted cheese,no salsa. The breast chicken was good. If you love enchiladas you'll be disappointed, this dish doesn't even get close to the idea of enchiladas. My husband had carnitas and he liked it even though he had to ask for salsa. What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't automatically serve salsa ?

I don't like how some of the tables are so close together you get a stranger's ass/crotch in your face when getting in and out from the table.

The wait staff are great.  Very attentive and engaging and also great with kids (a big plus in the NoPA hood).   The food has pluses and minuses.  Mole, Tamal, Horchata and house made tortillas are all great.  Carnitas and several other items are good.  This is not your typical spicy gut bomb taqueria food.  If that is what you want there are many many choices.  Nopalito is more subtle.  My main critique is some of sides and lunch items are very small plates, with few garinishes.  And it seems that simplicty is a key - and some of the dishes seemed dry or needed \"something\".  All in all (atmosphere and staff included) I'd definitely say try it but don't expect typical bay area \"mexican\" food.", "author": "E. Z."}

Much to my surprise, the place was still packed.  After a short wait (10-15 min), we were seated at the bar area.  Menu was limited - I ordered the Cod ($15), a quesadilla ($8), sangria ($7).  Portions were terribly small - the quesadilla was gone in three bites.  Not a good start to the meal.  As I moved onto the cod, I had the unfortunate shock of realizing I was chewing more than just fish -- I extracted a long blond (presumably human) hair before swallowing the second portion of the (otherwise tasty) poached cod.  The apologetic waitress ordered me another cod -- thankfully, sans hair.  Quickly finished the meal and asked for the check (the cod was comp'ed).  Waitress claimed it was the \"first time\" she experienced something like this at Nopalito but reminded me that the cooks are not \"robots\" and it happens \"all the time\" at other restaurants.  We this reassurance, she expressed the hope I would return.  I think I'll pass.", "author": "Steve K."}

The food is amazing. I was in a group of four and we tried six dishes (wanted to try about 12 dishes). Everything we ordered was REALLY good. Even the special drinks were yummy. The waiter we got was super-knowledgeable and more than willing to make some great recommendations. The interior design of space is very cool (clean design, but not sterile; nice use of warm materials and colors). The food here is nothing like the food at the taquerias in The Mission, so please go with the right expectations. This is authentic Mexican food, as opposed to Cal-Mex. The food is professionally prepared with all local/organic/sustainable ingredients. This last point explains the only slight negative of this place. Our lunch for four came out to roughly $85 with tax/tip. Again, don't think of it as eating Cal-Mex, but something a bit more refined and you won't get shock with your bill.", "author": "Joe C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-26", "description": "I had a craving for Mexican, but needed something more than a burrito so a bunch of friends and I decided on Nopalito.  I was a little nervous since the recent Yelp reviews had been mixed and thought that perhaps the restaurant was overwhelmed now that it had made Michael Bauer's Top 100 list.  We phoned 45 minutes before we arrived to get on the list and there was still a 35 minute wait?!  A burrito was starting to sound good!  I am glad we waited because we were not disappointed.  For starters we had the totopos (OK and the homemade cotija is a nice touch), ceviche (very good), and quesadilla azul (yummy!) and for mains we pretty much covered the options.  The outstanding dishes were the carnitas (crisp on the outside, but juicy and tender) and the birria (who knew goat could be so good!) - oh, and the homemade tortillas were delicious!  The pescado was very good, as was the mole, although note that it is an entire leg-thigh piece.  I had high expectations for the lamb barbacoa, but it was too gamey for me.  The service was excellent - some of the best wait staff I have experienced in the City.  Try it - but take a peek at the menu first, this isn't chips/salsa/guacamole Mexican and make sure to call in early to get on the waiting list. (Food 3.5 stars and Service 4.5 stars).", "author": "Lori G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-04", "description": "Great value for much a much-needed excellent Mexican food restaurant.  My boyfriend and I shared four plates and two drinks for $45 dollars, and the food was delicious!  I just moved here from AZ, so I've been missing the south-of-the-border cuisine.  We began with two house-made almond milk horchatas, which were thick and excellent.  Watching a cook make tortillas by hand at the grill, we waited 15 minutes (we called ahead to put our name on the list before we left the house).  The appetizer of chips with red sauce, cheese and sour cream was crunchy and spicy.  We also shared a pork tamale (A+, order it), chicken tostada (B+, chicken had interesting citris and spice flavor and was tender), and beef in red chile sauce (A, strips of grass fed beef, comes with beans and house-made tortillas, and fabulous pickled onions to make mini burritos).  I highly recommend this restaurant for interesting Mexican flavors, very nice wait staff, and a great value.  I think I'll try the mole next time!", "author": "Leah D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-01", "description": "Nopalito. Really nice, comfortable decor featuring very exciting and unusual food, artfully served by a so-so waitstaff.  The color choices of green, dark brown, and white got me ready for the food to come.  I could almost taste the the kind of nueva mexicana feel in before I even started eating.  Sitting at the bar was quite interesting because I was able to see the workings of the kitchen while I ate the food which they prepared.  I ordered the swordfish taco, which was very tasty, combining citrusy orange with the subtle flavor of the fish and the fresh corn tortilla. For my entree I had the tender and delicious carnitas, which I would recommend to anyone looking for some succulent and delectable pork.  The waiters and waitresses were very attentive and cordial.  There was, however one waitress who, when I attempted to order a drink, expressed her own dislike of it and convinced me to order something else.  I still do not know how I feel about this gesture, for it was most definitely meant to be helpful, but I found it a little perturbing that a member of the staff would openly criticize a menu item in front of the customer.  Aside form this occurence, I found the meal delightful.", "author": "Kirk J."}
