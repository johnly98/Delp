I came here a few years ago and regret not getting their nigari special, so I came back here with a friend recently and decided to get it.  I got the Omakase Nigiri 12 piece, along with the Hamachi Carpaccio and Salmon Carpaccio.   The salmon Carpaccio was ok, I didn't think it was as good as the Hamachi Carpaccio, maybe because the capers on the salmon Carpaccio took away the taste of the salmon.   The Hamachi one was our favorite and the Jalapeno did not over power the Hamachi.  \n\nThe Nigiri they had that night were the following amberjack, halibut, ocean trout, kinmedai, shima aji, sardine, salmon belly, and blacktrout seaperch. The Sardine was my least favorite, it had the strongest fish taste ever.   Everything else was amazing.  Most of it had the melt in your mouth feel.  The way to gave you the order was perfect, except for the sardine.  The most amazing dish was the last two.  The salmon belly and the Blacktrout Seaperch.   It was marinated just right, the perfect amount of sweetness and it still just magically disappeared in your mouth as you bite into it.  The final desk they gave me was the uni with the roe, over sushi rice.   Even though I like uni, it still didn't take my mind off that last two nigiri dishes.     In the end I ended up ordering an extra Tamago (Seafood Castella), which I found to be just ok, not as good as other ones I had before.  The next time I'm back I'm going to save enough money and order two pieces of their Blacktrout Seaperch.  It was that amazing!", "author": "Belinda C."}

There's almost always a long wait for all the high quality sushi places. Daigo Sushi is also great quality with a fraction of the wait time as other places. If waiting is not your thing, you can also call them to make a reservation.\n\nWhat's nice about Daigo Sushi is the balance between affordable and nice. Typically, you can expect to pay a lot when you go to a sit down sushi restaurant. Here, it's a little more affordable (still be prepared to pay more) whilst providing great quality fish. While the menu isn't expansive, there are some good choices. We got the baked salmon roll, the naruto roll, and the moriawase nigiri. The nigiri should be eaten as is so don't drench it in soy sauce and wasabi.\n\nThis restaurant is small but it's cozy and definitely a nice place to enjoy a quiet date or nice meal with a small group of friends.", "author": "Derek T."}

Each piece is garnished and flavored in detail that makes dipping in soy sauce unnecessary. \n\nWe then preceded to order more because we weren't exactly that full :-). We had the Tokyo Cowboy Roll which consisted of shiitake and tempura, topped with filet mignon served with a tataki sauce on the side. Unique and delicious.. the sauce complimented the roll perfectly! \n\nAn order of uni (1 pc/order) was also placed...

Daigo is popular for its nigiri sushi, but the makis and appetizers are just as good! \n\nMy favorite rolls at Daigo are the Tokyo Cow Boy and Rainbow Roll. The Tokyo Cow Boy has filet mignon topped with tataki sauce that just melts in your mouth and the Rainbow Roll is your typical California roll topped with assorted fresh fish. Other highlights are the Aburi Saba, Saba Nigiri, and Sake Nigiri. All makis and nigiris have the perfect rice to fish ratio. Since it's maki, it's not really that filling so expect to order at least 2-3 plates or eat for taste. \n\nParking isn't too bad around this area. It's more residential so you can park either with meters or street parking a few blocks away. Expect to wait if you go during busy hours. Price is alright (slightly on the higher end). I personally think it's worth it for the quality.", "author": "Michelle L."}

We were devastated when we finished the last plate...it was so good and went by so fast!\n\nSo we ordered more. On to the rolls.\n\nTokyo cowboy roll ($16): This is a filet mignon roll with shiitake, tempura, and tataki sauce. The texture was great with a nice crunch and savory taste of meat. Definitely unique. \n\nThere are other rolls but pretty basic: dragon, caterpillar, etc.\n\nWe were still hungry. I knew I should have pre eaten at this point haha.\n\nWe ended it with Uni. I was hesitant to try it since I haven't had great experiences before.

While this restaurant isn't like the super expensive omakase sushi restaurants that serve you piece by piece, the quality of their rice and fish speaks for itself.  \n\nThey have a standard menu with fish that they always have in inventory; however, there is also a separate list that is composed of the fish they received for the day--usually the more expensive, exclusive, and sought-after cuts.\n\nI always start with the hamachi shooter with truffle ponzu.  It is my absolute favorite, and I could probably pound a dozen of them in one sitting (test me).  I always go straight to the fish-of-the-day list and pick what pieces catch my eye from top to bottom.  I have two pieces tied for first place as my favorite nigiri:  the salmon belly (sake toro) and the seared A5 wagyu.  Both are a must order.  The sake toro is topped with green onions, which adds a nice complexity to the buttery salmon.  The wagyu is lightly seared and topped with truffle salt.  You cannot go wrong with their selection of mackerel and sardine nigiris either.  \n\nI'm really bougie with my sushi, so I don't usually order rolls.  But Daigo Sushi has one roll that I really enjoy, the Tokyo Cowboy (yee haw).  It has shrimp tempura on the inside and is topped with seared beef on the outside paired with a green onion dipping sauce.  \n\nJessie, one of the owners, is extremely friendly and always names the type of fish as he places your plate before you.

We came on a Monday night with a reservation for 8 pm, and it was pretty busy. We ordered a few appetizers, the omakase and some of the rolls. The food itself was fine, but we didn't get the main part of our order until about 9:20. We sat there pretty unhappy for almost an hour. Some of the other patrons said that's part of the experience, but I wouldn't recommend coming here based on the long wait for food. The atmosphere is also loud and not very pleasant.

It's a little neighborhood spot, and it's perfect.\n\nLocated in the Outer Richmond, it's certainly a five-star sushi joint, but hardly \"SF's Best Sushi.\" I think the charm lies in the location, the service, and the high quality stuff they're doing. It's not fancy, but they've got that little corner on lock.\n\nI've been a handful of times, sometimes to celebrate a small life victory in a group of three, or with family. There's not much room inside, so you will do well to limit your party to four at the most; two, ideal. It's a lot of neighborhood folks, but it's a little more elevated than a \"swing by and pick up some rolls\" kind of sushi joint.\n\nI was going to try to recount everything I've gotten here, but it all has been so good that let me just give you some guidance: let them guide you. Grab the list of current fresh fish, and go with some interesting cuts you've never had. Nigiri or sashimi, just delight in the actual fish. They're not really roll-heavy on the menu, and you can add a seaweed salad it you want to have a little variety on the plate. Last time I was here I did just that: ordered some 8 or so pieces of nigiri based on the server's recommendation, and sat back to enjoy. Each was expertly prepared and I was able to focus on the fish and seek out the distinct flavors that each species and cut brought me.\n\nThere's a wait almost every night, but it's not huge. The most they've ever quoted me was 30 minutes, and I've just hung out twice and been seated within 15 minutes. You'll be seat to seat with other people there, but again, with a neighborhood vibe, no one is too cranky about this. The joys of the Outer Richmond are that if you need parking, it's (probably?) not going to be impossible, but I usually walk here. Clement has a bunch of great options, but when Daigo opened, it got the sushi option it was lacking. \n\nNot necessarily a destination sushi spot, but if you're in the 'hood and want sushi, you shouldn't mess with any other place.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

The place is very small and was still packed even a little later into the evening, so we were lucky to have gotten a small table as we walked in.\n\nThey don't have that many options on the list, but sometimes its actually a good thing. We got a salmon avocado roll, caterpillar roll, baked salmon, and tokyo cowboy.\n\nIn my opinion, the salmon avocado roll was actually one of the best I've had ever, the fish was really fresh and soft, melt in your mouth, and one of the favorites out of even the special rolls. I thought the special rolls were decent, but not amazing. The Tokyo Cowboy, is definitely unique and a must try if possible; I enjoyed it, just because its not something you see often.\n\nThe icing on the top? Some green tea ice cream at the end.

What I love about this sushi place is the variety of fish they have.  They generally have a special slip with all the fresh fish of the day.  You'll find selection that I normally won't be able to find.  The price is quite reasonable as well.  They won't charge you an arm and a leg for uni.  The ankimo nigiri was much more reasonable than I thought as well.  I love their shima aji.  I haven't tried the rolls.  However, why would you want to, when they have a wide selection of fresh fish to choose from.  \n\nOne thing that I would caution was that the rice wasn't at the right consistency or temperature.  It was a bit hard and a little too cold as well.  It may have been a bad night, so I'll try this place again.  Perhaps I can just get sashimi and avoid the rice all together.  Another thing I didn't like was the toro had some tendon leftover on the fish.  The knife work needed to be better.  The toro tasted amazing, just the piece of tendon on it left the texture a bit off. \n\nI'll definitely come back for any non-standard fish that I would normally try.", "author": "Shirley C."}

I ordered the salmon belly nigiri from that list, and a sweet potato maki and shrimp tempura maki from the regular menu.\n\nThe salmon belly was delicious! It had a hint of wasabi that heightened the taste of fresh salmon. Though I wished I ordered the sashimi (because I would've had 3 instead of 1), I'm glad I didn't because I was full from my two other rolls.\n\nThe sweet potato was light in taste, but a bit of wasabi and soy sauce took care of that.

Their ikura is the bomb! No rice needed. They flavor their own ikura. Give me a bowl of ikura and spoon and I'm happy all day ! Their Kama toro is F..goooood! Beside Hokkaido uni of course lol.

My favorite was their hamachi shots which were $6 for one. Customer service was alright as well. This place is pretty small there were only 7 tables and a bar which fits 4 people.

The seafood quality here is A/A+ & better than even trendier spot like PABU / ICHI+NI downtown. It's also cheaper, but not *as* cheap as the dingy decor would lead you to be believe! So don't be misled on both its stunning sushi and its secretly-$$$ price.\n\nI was skeptical of the non-Japanese staff and the really un-auspicious design choices in this space, but the $40 ten-piece sushi omakase blew me away. That is by far the best deal in this sushi bar, and the same quality/tastiness would probably cost $60 at a trendier spot. Hirame, scallop, and all the varieties of madai/kurodai/kinmedai were expertly seasoned with light shiso/yuzu/searing. Salmon roe is also authentically marinated to be umami rather than overly salty.\n\nYou'll notice that the penchant for of zealously scoring/searing the fish flesh is a trend more commonly found in upscale sushi places in Chinese speaking countries (Taiwan / Hong Kong / China) than in Japan itself. That's fine. It's still very good.\n\nIf you start ordering catch-of-the-day nigiri pieces individually, this place could get as expensive of the big downtown sushi masters (though still good, you might not want to pay so much at a crowded hole-in-the-wall with no ambiance).", "author": "Ken H."}

Most recent visit was last week for dinner and we ordered:\n\nHAMACHI sashimi- most outstanding, fatty; ordered the 3 pc but chef voluntarily cut into 4 pc so that husband and I could have 2 pc each.

Recommend Go for the Maine if you must have uni bc the pieces are ridiculously small and NO way worth $8 (does not taste as good as those I had in Japan either)\nHotaru IKA- firefly squid nigiri was okay\nIka sashimi- pretty good, cut into approx. 3/8 in. Thick Threads. I order this almost every time since I like ika\nAOEBI shrimp- nigiri okay, fried shrimp head is good; I feel like the shrimps were much smaller than previous times\nSakura SALMON- good, light, soft texture\nSALMON SKIN ROLL- salmon skin is very hard and difficult to chew, rice a bit dry\nABURI SABA ROLL- was tasty, scallion tempura inside, Saba outside. \n\nEverything was edible with a couple items I particularly enjoyed like the hamachi sashimi and aburi Saba roll. However, everything seemed to have shrunk in size (to ridiculous small portions especially the uni nigiri) and they need to improve on their rice game. Rice is equally important as the fish in nigiri/sushi!\n\nService from the chef is always pretty good, especially when you sit at the counter he may give you his recommendations of the night.

FISH BELLY, get in my belly!!!!!\n\n- FOOD, deliciousness \n- PRICES, decent/depends \n- SERVICE, good\n- AMBIANCE, small and clean\n\nYou pay for QUALITY!! They have a \"Today's Special\" menu that changes daily based on what the supplier brings in. ALWAYS order from this menu. This is not the typical sushi joint where the rolls are covered in sauces, nor it is a sushi joint where you can order teriyaki and all that extra garbage. This is a TRUE and LEGIT sushi joint. \n\nHEFER STATS. \n\nHAMACHI SHOT ($6) - that has got to be the loveliest hamachi shot I've had (beats the one at Alexander steakhouse). It had finely diced hamachi, finely chopped onion, raw quail egg yolk, crispy rice balls (crumbs), sliver of avocado, pinch of fish eggs as garnish, and truffle ponzu. The truffle wasn't over powering and enhanced the flavors. It was just lovely! Highly recommend. \n\nHAMACHI CARPACCIO ($10) - thinly sliced hamachi, jalape\u00f1o, tobiko, and garlic ponzu. It was laid out like the beef Tataki, on a long plate. Beautiful color, crackin taste!!! The hamachi was like velvet with little hints of heat. I could do without the fish eggs... The hamachi is just fine without or with. Good stuff!\n\nBEEF TATAKI ($10) - seared filet Mignon and Tataki sauce (think it has jalape\u00f1o flavor), The beef was laid ontop of raw arugula. The slices of filet Mignon were delicious; tender and flavorful. If you take a bite with the arugula you get the sharp taste on the after taste. Flavor, savory of the meat, and a nice tangy and spice of heat from the jalape\u00f1o. Highly recommend.\n\nTORO TASTING ($15.5) - this was on the today's special menu; not always available but if it is... Order it without hesitation!!! 4 pieces only but the belly (toro) is the best part. The toro tasting came from 4 different fish (albacore toro, salmon toro, blue fin toro, and yellowtail toro). MELTED IN MY MOUTH!!!!! Hands down, that was the best I've ever had. Highly recommend.\n\nNARUTO ($9) - 4 pieces. spicy tuna, sake, hamachi, and avocado wrapped in cucumber wrapper  with ponzu. This was one of their special rolls. This is one of their popular items. You can see three different fishes folded within the cucumber wrap. The cucumber wrap gives this roll a nice crunch and the ponzu helps digest the roll. Highly recommend.\n\nISAKI ($6) - this was on today's special. 2 pieces of three line grunt from Japan. The fish was light in taste and not as tender as is imagine. There isn't much creaminess in this order and nothing exciting. It wasn't \"terrible\" it just wasn't awesome. Do not really recommend. \n\nNEGIHAMA ($3.50) - 6 pieces. hamachi and scallops. This was a roll and came in six tiny pieces. Although it looks simple, it was yummy and I liked it. Didn't have any crazy/colorful sauces, just pieces and dipping sauce. Who needs garbage sauce to cover quality. Highly Recommend. \n\nGREEN TEA ICE CREAM (free) - save yourself $2.50 if you check-in. You can chose other flavors but green tea is yummy. Refreshing after a meal. Green tea is always my first pick in ice cream at this place. \n\nBLACK SESAME ICE CREAM - they have the best black sesame ice cream!! The sesame taste is not overpowering and the ice cream itself is very creamy. I am a fan. \n\nWill I be back? DUH!!! I am duke for a reason.\n\nJABA APPROVED...

Out of three rolls that I tried, I thought that the Baked Salmon Roll tasted the best. \n\nThe Baked Salmon Roll is basically a baked California roll filled with avocado and imitation crab meat topped with salmon and drizzled with spicy mayo. I loved that it's definitely fresh. This roll took the longest to make, which is understandable. I loved that the entire roll worked well together. It is on the pricey side with 8 pieces for $12.\n\nThe Tempura Roll came with just 6 pieces for $6.50. Shrimp tempura with avocado wrapped into a sushi roll. This roll didn't amaze me and I mostly tasted the batter of the tempura more than anything else.\n\nThe Spider Roll was pretty good too. The basic soft shell crab wrapped with cucumber and avocado then drizzled with teriyaki sauce. When you bite into this roll, the first thing you notice is the soft shell crab. It's crunchy and delicious. However, I feel like it's all I noticed too. It's as if I'm only eating the soft shell crab rather than as a roll. \n\nI was a little bit disappointed after all the reviews I read. However, since I don't eat raw fish, I can't review their other rolls. I do believe they are known for their fresh fish. For me, I feel their cooked rolls are overpriced for the amount we received.

I downed this shot and man was it yummy!! I could have another but I needed to save the tummy for more yummy food. \n\nHAMACHI CAPACCIO:\nSlices of HAMACHI with jalape\u00f1o slices, red onion, and tobiko on top drizzled with what looks like sriracha.  One of my cousins LOVE HAMACHI and she loved this dish, I would too if I could handle the jalape\u00f1o, I did try this and it was good but so spicy!!\n\nNARUTO ROLL:\nAs everyone has already said, this roll is top notch! Thinly sliced cucumber wrapped around spicy tuna with HAMACHI, avocado, and salmon. The ponzu sauce that this roll comes with is good enough that you don't need soy sauce to dip unlike other rolls.  This roll is a must try. 4 piece this roll. \n\nWHITE TUNA: \nPretty standard sushi roll with white tuna on the inside  avocado, and pickled radish, with citrus miso drizzled over it. I loved the crunchy texture of the radish that comes in this roll and felt that the radish kind of over powered the white tuna cause I barely tasted it. \n\nJAMES ROLL:\nA spicy tuna roll with tempura shrimp, asparagus roped with seared HAMACHI and jalape\u00f1o.  I didn't taste this but presentation looked nice and the cousins loved it.\n\nSEAFOOD SALAD:\nSpring greens with pieces of assorted sashimi and a miso dressing.  Pretty healthy meal here, comes in a big bowl, and just this dish by itself can make you full. Again, fresh fish!!\n\nI would like to try more here probably another day because it really is good food.  Oh btw, check in offer free ice cream!", "author": "Anita L."}

Tuna is nicely seared with a crispy coating and rare middle. Yummerz. \n\n(2) Hamachi Jalapeno Roll- hamachi fish & jalapeno. It was alright. The jalapeno adds a nice kick without making the roll unbearingly spicy. Probably would not order this again because there really isn't anything too unique about this roll. \n\n(3) Aburi Saba Roll- our favorite! It has tempura green onion, ginger, onion, avocado, and topped with a fat piece of seared fish.

I've been coming to Daigo for a while now, but I've never had a chance to take pictures and actually write a review. The restaurant is small and contemporary. There is a sushi bar of course, with a beautiful view of the fishy goodness. They also had a $20 for $10 special on Yelp. Totally worth it!\n\n[THE FOOD]\nThe Naruto Roll - $8.00\n4 pieces in each roll. A nice appetizer and very refreshing. The roll has no rice and is instead wrapped in cucumber. Inside is avocade, spicy tuna, hamachi, and sake with a ponzu sauce. YUM.\n\nSeafood Salad - $11.50\nI really enjoyed this! The dressing was acidic and complimented the sashimi very well. I also enjoyed the various types of fish on top, plus the kaiware sprouts are my favorite!\n\nBaked Salmon Roll - $13.00\nYour standard \"lion king\" type roll. California on the inside with baked salmon and sauce on top. It was very comforting. Warm sushi that melts in your mouth just feels more like a full meal because it's savory I guess. \n\nNegihama Roll - $4.50\nI was still hungry (it was a really long day) so I grabbed a small hamachi roll. The nori outside was fresh and crispy, and the hamachi fresh!\n\nWhen you check into Yelp, you can get a free ice cream. It comes in Black Sesame, Ginger, or Green Tea. I came in a group of 3 so we each tried one. I liked them all, although my ginger was my favorite, as I just really love ginger.\n\n[THE VALUE]\nFor the quality of the sushi, I'd definitely be back. Their prices were fair. Not dirt cheap, but definitely worth it for what you got. Their hamachi shooters, carpaccio, ankimo, etc. are all very good too, and you can't find them just anywhere.\n\n[THE SERVICE]\nService has always been pretty solid for me here.

The chefs really know what they're doing (although I'm not sure they're Japanese) because it was one of the best sushi I've had in the Bay Area. The fish tastes fresh and melts right in your mouth. They don't pile on the rice in their rolls/nigiri like other places do so you're able to try a variety of their dishes. We got the moriawase nigiri ($23), chefs choice nigiri 5pc ($20), the caterpillar and rainbow rolls (~$15 each), and the grilled salmon collar ($11). Everything was great. I especially appreciated how detail oriented each dish was. The nigiri comes with wasabi and soy sauce already set on each piece, so you don't have to worry about accidentally drowning your sushi in soy sauce. The crab meat in the rainbow roll was actual crab and super flavorful to complement the fish on top.

It's got the perfect equation for an amazing meal that you are looking for. Daigo is actually a pretty small joint compared to may sushi places and I've actually never seen a line here. As a matter of fact I think it's actually a gem/ hole in a wall that gets overlooked. But beyond all that you get a comfy atmosphere, an amazing ambience, and most importantly hospitality like no other. The owner here (who is the chef himself) is amazing and very friendly. 5 stars for that.\n\nLets talk fish:\nThere are a couple things you can do with the food here but I recommend omakase as always. Don't just get the set menu that the chef has (which is a set number of fish), but just eat until you are full. Why? Cus this place has good price for the amount of fish you eat compared to many SF places out there. The only downfall? It's pretty far out. But if you get a chance to taste the fish it's perfection! I'm not even joking. Bonus item!!!!!! You get ice-cream for dessert.\n\nIn SF there has only been one other place that I have given a 5 star. But honestly that place is very pricey.

I had their salmon sashimi and a couple of their rolls.\n\nThe salmon was not fresh; it had a rather dry, rubbery texture. The rice they use in their rolls contains too much vinegar, leaving a sour aftertaste. Their tempura resembles nothing like traditional tempura; they seems to use panko instead. Portions of their rolls are very small, only 6-8 pieces each in the diameter slightly bigger than a quarter. Service here is typical for a Chinese-owned restaurant (heard them yelling in Cantonese in the back); you have to flag them down to do anything, from placing your order to refilling your water/tea.\n\nDon't let those websites proclaiming Daigo as a top sushi spot in the city fool you - it's nothing more than a paid placement.", "author": "Felix C."}

You know this place is the real deal when you see that most if not all of their fish is imported, primarily from Japan. What impressed me is that you don't even need the soy sauce dish. Every piece of nigiri/maki was served with its own unique sauce and I ate it as is, which in my opinion is the way it should be eaten.\n\nI had ordered the hamachi shot + naruto roll + hamachi/toro/engawa (gotta thank the waiter for this recommendation!) nigiri and Oh. My. God. Every bite that I took had an explosion of flavor that made me cry a little on the inside because I was in heaven. The fish just melted in my mouth like butter. But really though, their quality of fish is just on a another level! Although they ran out of the wagyu beef when I was there, I'm definitely coming back to try that little bad boy!\n\nRegarding the atmosphere, this is a pretty small restaurant but the ambience feels really intimate yet laid back at the same time. I'd highly recommend this place if you're looking to take that special someone or good friend out for a nice and high quality dinner. It's a huge plus for all you Nujabes fans because they always play his beats in the background. Sooooo dope! On that note if you're going to eat here, you don't eat here to get full.

I was a bit skeptical, as I some earlier reviews stuck a paranoid bug, that some of these reviews have been fabricated to offset negative reviews. I can assure you, that the stars are well deserved. \n\nI made a reservation, but ended up not needing it. There were people, but it wasn't full at all. There are 5 tables that seat 4, and like 3 tables that seat 2. There is also bar seating. The lighting is warm (yellow), and there is soft jazz playing in the background. Easy to have a conversation and talk normally. \n\nWe were given menus and served complimentary hot tea. I have been fasting, and this was my meal to break my fast, so naturally, I wanted to binge. The waiter was great at explaining things to us, introducing the alcohols, and just very attentive and super nice. When I ordered Himachi Kama, he had to go to the back to check to make sure they had some.\n\nHere is what I ordered for two:\n\n(chilled) Dewazakura Sake Sampler for $15:\n---\"Oka\" - Cherry Bouquet - This was my favourite sake from the sampler. I'm not a big fan of sake, but this one was great! Didn't have too much of the sake flavour. Strong floral and melon aroma. \n---\"Dewasansan\" - Green Ridge - Tasted very tart apple-y just as the description says. This one is also pretty light, and doesn't have too much of a sake taste\n---\"Izumi Judan\" - Tenth Degree - I'm reading the description right now, and it's fairly accurate. I was going to compare this to a gin. It's very dry, again, doesn't have too much of the hot sake flavour. Definitely a dry drink. It was okay. Tasted more like alcohol than the other ones.\n\nHimachi Shots $6 (per shot) - Onion, quail egg, truffle ponzu; We got two. These were super delicious. The combination of everything was great and it was flavourful, but not overwhelmingly so. Just right! This was a great way to start the food.\n\nMoriawase Sashimi $22 - tuna, hamachi, salmon, binnaga (albacore tuna), walu (escolar); (2 pieces of each); This was a great price for this sashimi. The cuts were consistent and precise. The fish were fresh. The decor was super cute!\n\nBaked Salmon Roll $12 - Baked CA roll topped with salmon, spicy mayo; This roll was definitely a big step up from eating sashimi... flavour wise. It packed a lot of flavour without being drenched in too much sauce. Definitely a delicious dish, and I'd like to try some of the other rolls.\n\nHitachino Kest $10 - This beer was definitely delicious, and I've never heard of it... however, when it was brought out, I definitely saw this at bevmo before. $10 for this beer is a bit steep, get it at bevmo. \n\nHimachi Kama $14 - We ordered the last one! :) I have a friend from NY who loves this dish, and I've eaten it once with her, but it was overcooked and dry. I had low expectations, but it came out amazing. The outside was crispy with about a quarter inch cooked fish, leaving the inside and bone rare. This came out perfect and I was extremely impressed. Odd that this is an appetizer but it came out last.\n\nSesame Ice Cream FREE! - Check in on Yelp! and get a free ice cream. I let my friend pick the flavour (green tea, sesame, ginger, red bean). We opted for Sesame. It was good! Not amazing, but it was good. They gave us two scoops and two spoons for sharing. \n\nThis whole time, our tea cups were constantly check on, and we were checked to see if everything was okay. Service is definitely top notch and friendly. I appreciate that. Our server was easy to talk to - as if we've been friends for a while. \n\nThe only issue I ran into was that today was the last day that all sakes were 50% off, so my sampler was $7.50. However, I couldn't get both the yelp $15 for $30 AND the 50% off. He suggested I take the 50% off because it's the last day for that deal, and save the $15 for $30 for some other time. Uh, no. I don't understand why they couldn't just let me use both... the total bill came out to be close to 90 dollars. If you put the alcohol on a separate bill, and the food on a separate bill, I would still qualify to use both! Ugh. I'll let it go, it's 7 dollars.\n\nIn summary, good food, great service, I highly recommend this place for good sushi. I will be back to try the other rolls!

This was my first experience with Beef on Sushi. I loved how it was very lightly seared and mostly raw. The sushi itself overpowered the taste of the beef, which was unfortunate, but when eaten alone and beef held a wonderful flavor. Good Quality seafood and meat.\n\nCreamy Scallop Roll - This roll said on the menu that it had Soy Wrap, which is my personal preferance over seaweed, so I ordered this roll thinking the Soy wrap was in place of Seaweed. However, when the roll arrived to our table I noticed it was both wrapped in Seaweed AND Soy Wrap. I had never seen this before and it tasted OK, I just prefer no Seaweed. More good Quality Seafood.\n\nSpicy Tuna Wrap - DIVINE! The spice was just right and the Tuna was SO fresh.\n\nHamachi Shot - WOW. This was by far the best thing we had! Brilliant Flavors.

My wife and I spent over 4 bills at Wako (which was amazing) but for our more frequent daily fix, Daigo really hits the spot.  I'm generally against non-Japanese owned restaurants because they are all typically soy sauce, rehydrated wasabi powder, dragon rolls, and California rolls etc etc all day long.  Daigo features nigiri seasoned perfectly specifically to particular types of fish or seafood.  Eric the chef is a magician of flavor and texture, serving up imported specialties from a daily changing menu.  Just the other day we compared Uni from Japan and Maine, both unique in taste, but equally fresh and satisfying.  Gone are those days covering the delicate differences between variety of fish with dark soy sauce and wasabi.

The shari (seasoned rice) could have been more sticker as it easily fell apart upon picking up the nigiri with chopsticks.\n\nThe standouts of the night were the tantalizing Hamachi Shooters which had tons of umami flavor and a nice crunch from the toasted rice balls, the soft, velvety Ankimo, the torch blown Hamachi Carpaccio which was super buttery with a delicate smokiness, the unique half raw and half torch blown Blue Shrimp with deliciously crunchy fried shrimp heads and the silky Sake Salmon. \n\nThe mediocre selections were the Unimasu, Uni, Tachiuo, Unagi, and Walu as I've had fresher elsewhere. \n\nThe disappointments of the night were the Beef Tataki which was grey and dry and the Toro which lacked the quintessential butteryness that I'm used to. \n\nComplimentary scoops of Ginger and Green Tea ice cream nicely ended our meal.

Perfectly timed and seasoned so that it isn't too salty or sweet depending on whether you get a braised or miso grilled collar.  The texture is absolutely amazing, super tender and smooth.  The last time I went...they were out of kama =(...but because of that I tried their hamachi carpaccio instead.  It was the perfect appe8tizer.  A little salty and a little sour.  I've had some before where the saltiness or the sourness overpowered the fish, but once again...perfectly sauced.  It definitely helped increase my appetite.  For some reason not many Japanese restaurant have saba (mackerel) for some reason.  They have good saba here so that's always a plus for me as well.

I admit, I follow him as well on yelp. But for some reason he didn't like it. For me, I've always found this place to be spectacular and different compared to the fusion Japanese cuisine all over the bay. Yes, this place isn't Japanese owned, but the sushi chefs do know what they are doing. \n\nThere's a few things I recommend when you come here. \nI go for omakase.. Talk to the sushi chef, tell him what you like and get a relationship with a small talk. Forget the rolls, because you can get rolls everywhere. Nothing special if your going to go for a california roll. \n\nI've uploaded a set of pics on my recent visit. \nThe Sushi Chef (Eric) worked out a Sashimi Moriawase, which was a selection of sashimi pieces in small cuts. The work of art and knife skills are presented here. \n\nThen comes the nigiri. I tasted 11 piece nigiri special (for me, i've come to a result where i tell him when to stop). Served up in these 11 pieces included Chu-toro, regular toro, king salmon, tuna, ikura, etc etc.. Note that the rice (Shari) is marinated. If you watch Eric work his magic, the fish gets the knife treatment, and other ingredients are added on top. This means you may not need to use soy sauce. If your drenching every piece in a deep bowl of soy sauce and wasabi, your going to loose the original taste of the fish. \n\nIf your still not full with the nigiri, I recommend doing a handroll to complete the dine in. \nEnjoy!", "author": "Eric Y."}

On top of that, the fish is subpar at best with long lines that no one has time to wait for. The other option is paying $200 somewhere like Maruya, but who can afford that?!\n\nThen came along my knight in shining armor - Eric and his sous chef are masters of fish. Even though they look young, they have a great understanding of fish and really care about what they serve on your plate! Their fish specials change all the time so there's always something new and delicious to try! \n\nOn top of that customer service is top notch! They remembered after just one visit that my roommate doesn't like Ikura and haven't served us Ikura since.\n\nMy roommate have been coming here at least once a month (often more) since September 2014.

Even the largest and most expensive rolls are only about six pieces instead of eight, and that is a pretty small-sized roll (in overall lenght compared to the average six piece roll). Nice decor with an upscale feel, but it felt more like a crutch for mediocre food. The location and area are great, and it seems to be the case with some restaurants thinking that success is guaranteed if they are located next to a bunch of affluent people and have a snazzy decor. \n\nMaybe it's my Americanized palette, but I did order the more Americanized rolls (the Naruto roll) and felt them to lack creativity versus other sushi restaurants I've favored in the past. Friendly service although reserved and quite shy. I don't know what it is with sushi places in Marin county, but it seems most waiters are extremely shy and overly polite. This may be more authentic to the culture, but I would rather my waiter be an extrovert who can make me feel like a friend. This is universal anywhere.\n\nWhen I eat sushi I expect to be blown away, because I'm never full from eating it by itself (I have a more athletic body and require to eat a lot of food and protein to maintain my mass. This is not practical with sushi, because of its expense, although it is one of my favorite foods). There is nothing worse than a sushi place that is only mediocre, because most sushi will be pretty good, but since all sushi is expensive than only the best of the best will survive. This basically means I won't be back here as I will keep searching for something more akin to my palette. \n\nBy the way: I have been eating extremely healthy at home lately (no condiments, no processed foods, no sugar, etc.) and therefore everything I eat when I go out to eat always tastes incredible, no matter how mediocre the food actually is.

Restaurant is small, so expect to wait if you don't show up early. No parking issue since we live close by. Pleasant and quick service which always a plus. We ordered a couple of rolls and ikura nigiri as fillers because it was the sashimi we came for. The variety and the quality of the raw fish were top notch. Nigiri was smaller than the usual. The truffle salt mushroom tempura was very unique, I loved it although the Mister didn't care for it (more for me). We were both a bit disappointed with one of the day's special - miso marinated wagyu beef. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad. The flavor was there, but we were hoping the beef could be a bit more tender. The ones we got were a bit chewy, and that wasn't what we expected. Again, I can't reiterate enough the exceptional quality of the fish and how well each dish was presented.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-17", "description": "I grew up in this area and have watched this place change a couple of times. The sushi spot it used to be was a small, casual, and decent joint. However since it has changed to Daigo, it is a bit more \"up there\" so the price point has gone up with more focus on the actual fish and not rolls. Daigo also offers a tad bit more of an exotic variety of fish.\n\nMost people say a reservation isn't necessary, but since this place is so small it does get full during dinner hours. I would recommend a reservation for the sushi bar. You seem to get your food a little bit faster this way, although the service can be excruciatingly slow as they get backed up with Eat24 orders. Normally I thought that sitting at the sushi bar meant the sushi chefs will take my order but they were super focused on making to go orders so my friend and I patiently waited for our waiter...so hungry.. \n\nMy game plan was this: go with omakase, decide what I liked most and order more more of it, get some nigiri and if still hungry, maybe the Tokyo Cowboy roll that was recommended to me. My plan was genius and it worked. If you're a big eater, you will definitely need a roll because omakase got me nowhere near full. \nQuality of the fish was excellent.  The uni was from Boston the night we dined there. Sweet, but a little too briny for my liking. What I was highly impressed with was the ikura. About 95% of sushi joints in SF make it way too salty. Daigo's ikura was perfection and not overly saturated in soy sauce (thank goodness). \nReally enjoyed the textures in the Tokyo Cowboy roll. The inside consisted of tempura-ed scallions and shiitake mushrooms with thinly sliced seared filet mignon on top, and an accompanying tataki sauce. Crunchy, delicate scallions with rich smokey shiitake and buttery meat goodness. It only needs a small dabble of the tataki sauce otherwise it can be too tangy and overpowering. \n\nMy only complaint is that this place is SO HOT. I was sweating bullets sitting at the sushi bar in a tank top and jeans... and I only had 1/2 a beer! Please get a fan.. or AC..or something.. PLEASE!

Then we ordered 2 sets of omakase (chef's choice) which has 10 different selections of nigiri. The price for it is decent. We were not full from the nigiri since they make it slightly smaller than most places so we ordered the ocean trout, uni from Japan, and wagyu beef, all nigiri. All is great. Especially the seared wagyu beef because the chef added a hint of truffle salt to it. You can taste the freshness of the beef and the truffle salt is not too overpowering. It just blends in so well.

I was pleased to find that the food is outstanding and they DO deliver!\n\nI've been meaning to write a review for a while now, but last night finally put my a** in gear. I took an out-of-town-friend-with-discerning-palate for dinner and he was blown away. We ordered everything from hamachi shooters to the James roll, Tokyo cowboy and Baked salmon roll. All amazing. The nigiri is incredibly fresh and the fish just melts in your mouth.\n\nAdd to that, Daigo has a vast beer and sake selection not available at any other restaurant I've been to. \n\nJesse and Eric are awesome and despite having just eaten there last night, I want to order again tonight.

You can't tell in the pictures because you can't see them in scale. As soon as walked in, I noticed this place must not be Japanese operated. The people making the sushi are just young kids who look like they have never been trained in making sushi, and they also double for waiters. But whatever, I thought I shouldn't judge by the looks.\n\nWe got the ankimo, naruto roll, and a few assorted sushi. Naruto roll was nothing to rave about - fresh yes, but I don't know how you can mess up bits of fish wrapped in cucumber with ponzu sauce. Also it's only 4 pieces ($9). The sushi, like I said, was tiny and not very good. The ankimo was alright, but also tiny. The price was on par with other sushi restaurants, which made it worse because it was not good. \n\nIf you are a true nigiri/sashimi lover, I cannot recommend this place.

We ordered a couple things: uni, ikura, dragon roll, naruto roll, spider roll, and the hanabi roll. They were all equally delicious, but if I had to choose one, I would go with the dragon roll -- other than the uni and ikura nigiri of course! You can never go wrong with those two. My least favorite was the naruto roll. I am not a fan of sushi drenched in ponzu. I have never seen it in Japan and I don't think I will ever get used to it. It also only came with four slices, which I thought should be stated (I typically expect around 6-8 rolls). \n\nWhat really stood out to me about this place was the freshness of their fish. Like I said before, the fact that they focus a lot of their attention on nigiri shows that they are confident in their fish and knife skills.", "author": "Hana K."}

Each Sushi-Chef has very different way of preparing Saba.\n\nAfter I ordered Beer and Nigiri, I went to bathroom to wash my hands.\nWhen I came back, the man in the counter who suppose to be Sushi-Chef, was peeling off Saba Skin out of a plastic bag that you can buy a prepared Saba from a Japanese market.\nThen I knew, the man didn't really have proper Sushi training before, or he may not been Japan even, because Saba is very basic and important Sushi-item for Japan's Sushi world.\nThere is no Sushi-Chef use already prepared Saba from a Japanese market. No one. \nMaybe I am the first person who ordered Saba here. No one else had ordered Saba in the Daigo Sushi before. This is not the right way to serve Sushi professionally.\nI still remember that the man who thinks he is Sushi-Chef, his face was stunned when I odered red Saba. His face was like, \"Holly mackerel !\"\n\nAnd most of all, I could tell that his hands movements were not really coordinating when he was handling Shari (sushi-rice) and Neta ( sliced raw fish). He looked really awkward making Nigiri.\nShari was way too small. So tiny! The Shari was only 1 inch long, That's it!\n\nI ended up having Saba and Maguro. 4 piece of Nigiri, I ate them within 30 seconds.\nThe Saba was so dry, the Maguro was so lame, the Shari wasn't good.\nI did waste 15 bucks, but I did try to manage my damages by getting minimum.\n\nI was there for very short time, maybe the shortest I have ever been in a Sushi bar.\nI wanted to get out of there as fast as I could. So I did. It was that bad.\n\nNo offense but 100% Chinese.\nI am pretty sure that he hasn't been in Japan having real Sushi there.\nDisappointed, Very Much!\nUsually, I am pretty good and well manage my feeling of having pseudo Sushi but this time, must be different because I just got back from Japan and having a real thing. I was there for a month. I had real good Sushi in Japan.\nI don't think I'll go back.\nI am still very angry for having such an unsatisfied Sushi. \nI do not recommend to any of my friends, period.", "author": "Nobu K."}

I've had most of the rolls and my favorites are the tokyo cowboy, naruto and the baked salmon roll. Cowboy is topped with seared filet mignon and tataki sauce. It has a somewhat garlicy taste and isn't a common roll at other Japanese restaurants. The naruto is very fresh - spicy tuna, hamachi and avocado wrapped in cucumber. It takes a few minutes extra for the baked salmon roll - basically california roll topped with warm salmon. It's definitely a savorier choice for dinner.\n\nSome of the more common rolls are the rainbow, dragon, spider, spicy tuna and hamachi. All solid - you can't go wrong and they are the perfect second choice options to cowboy and naruto. The hanabi is more thinly sliced, crispy and topped with sriracha - tasty, mildly different. Of all the rolls, I found the James to be the least inspired. \n\nThe separate special menu actually operates more as a weekly. I really enjoy the uni, firefly squid and miso cod. Anything with oysters, hamachi or ending with 'shooter' is a fair win. \n\nFrom the drinks menu, I was excited to see they have a full suite of Hitachino beers. The red rice is easily my first choice though I have heard good things about the espresso stout. Conveniently, they serve plum wine in a tiny bottle for one.", "author": "Camille L."}

We had the moriawase sashimi (tuna, binnaga, hamachi, sake, walu), and a bunch of nigiri (toro, zuku sake, amaebi, walu, and some others). All the fish was fresh and had the perfect melt in your mouth texture.  Besides the sashimi, I didn't dip the any of the nigiri in soy sauce or add any extra wasabi because the sushi chefs had flavor down to a point.

We got bar seats and my first impression wasn't too great. The place is a little shabby and there was two young dudes behind the counter just chillin. The special menu had an interesting selection, though so we ordered some nigiri. We got our first order quickly and the taste blew my mind. The fish was top notch and the rice quality was excellent. The nigiri were a little small but it was priced pretty well ($4 per piece on common cuts, $5-$10 for more \"exotic\" stuff) so I didn't care **(I say priced well for the quality.. you can easily find cheaper but it won't be as good).\n\nWe ordered a bunch of nigiri off the normal and special menu and everything was great but what really stood out to me was the special menu fish. It's a little pricier than the normal stuff but it was great.\n\nService was good but not outstanding, which is fine for me since I don't expect anyone to go out of their way at a small sushi spot.\n\nOur bill came to $250ish after tip (with drinks) but keep in mind we we probably ordered enough for 3-4 people. We normally spend $200-$300 (without drinks) depending where we go so price good.\n\nAnyways, can't recommend this place enough.

I love me some citrus on my rolls. The one thing I have to complain about though is that the rind was left on some of the lemon pieces which made for a hard surprise while chewing a few times. Once I figured out it was lemon rind I was cool but not really what you want in your roll! Lots of fresh crab though and asparagus gives it a great crunch. \n\nThe Hanabi roll was cut in very slim pieces and I have to say I preferred that! Easy to eat and made it seem like you got more for your money. More sushi places should follow suit. Quite spicy but the flavor was amazing. \n\nI liked these two together with the fresh/citrus contrasting with the spicy/fried. It ended up being plenty enough for me which is rare when i order two rolls. \n\nMinor points off for not putting a barrier around the wasabi so it doesn't get on the rolls.

I have seen this on more than one occasion. After each use he would merely dab his hands on a wet towel and go back to making sushi.

Especially when the reviews says \"real sushi followed by\" hamachi shots\". Sorry but real sushi places don't have such things!!\n\nAnyhoo, the hubby and I were really craving sushi sho, but considering we were not in the eastbay and didn't get in line an hour early for first seating, we roamed around the city thinking of a good place to eat sushi on a sunday night.\n\nI had seen this as a new place on yelp and saw the good reviews and had bookedmarked it. Conflicted, I told the hubby to have medium to low expectations of this place considering it is a chinese owned japo place with jive as rolls.\n\nWe forged ahead anyways and found parking right away in my old stomping grounds on 26th and clement. The place is located right next to hard knox cafe, another asian owned, mediocore place to eat on Clement.\n\nFor 9pm on a Sunday night, the place was almost full; a good sign.\n\nThe overly loud lounge music is sort of overkill and just trying too hard for me.\nWe ordered:\n\nHamachi belly nigiri\nsake nigiri\nalbacore tuna nigiri\nrainbow roll (yes jive ass roll but we had to fill out bellies with something)\nMiso soup x2\nSashimi salad\n\n\nEverything was OK but you can tell the skillset of the chef was subpar. Some of the fish was completely unevenly cut, with some of the sake having parts of the skin on it. (fish was not cut cleanly and half of it was fish and the other half had the white reminants of parts of the fish skin)  I have never seen this before!\n\n the rice itself was OK. seasoned OK. Nothing mind blowing.\n\n\nthe rainbow roll was the worst. it was like it was made by a 6th grader, uneven cuts of fish, small, and just wasn't the most appetizing.\n\n\nThe sashimi salad was good in taste and I enjoyed the flavor of the dressing but for $9, i expected something better than butter knife cuts of fish with skin still on it and a few lettuce leaves. The bits of walu in it still had the black chewy skin on it. REALLY? The best sashimi salad is still at Kanpai in LA near LAX. \n\n\nOverall like i said to the hubby,  to have 'medium to low\" expectations and you won't be disappointed. I don't think i will be back.\n\n\nbleh.", "author": "Petri Y."}

My favorite items ordered yesterday both had quail egg cracked on top -  Hamachi shot and the Uni (you have to ask for the quail egg). They also seem to have a good selection of sake, and our waitress was pretty knowledgeable about the entire sake menu. She recommended the Kikusui sake, and it was very good, crisp, and clean (just like the menu says it is). We also ordered ankimo, unagi, the the blue fin Toro special, the nigiri king salmon, and the nigiri Tasmanian trout. All pretty yummy, as well. It just feels like you can't go wrong here. And the cherry on top was that they played some Nujabes tracks all night long. Perfect end to a long week.", "author": "April D."}

They got seated at the sushi bar and flashed us some dirty looks which made the meal even better. \n\nThe appetizers and sushi itself were super good. The filet mignon appetizer was perfect: good quality, lightly seared and rare. The one roll that stood out among all the sushi I've ever had was the Salmon Citrus roll. Snow crab and asparagus inside with salmon and a razor-thin slice of lemon on the outside - perfect. The other rolls we had - of the spicy tuna/hamachi variety - were great too . \n\nReally good and well-priced beer and sake selection, as well. \n\nGlad to find this place and will definitely be coming back.", "author": "Ethan S."}

Go more than once, and Jeff the manager/host will remember not only your face, but where you last sat AND what sake you enjoyed. \n\nGive Eric behind the sushi bar a few pointers about what you like, and then give him free reign to pick and choose the specials of the day for you. We like to order about 1/3 of our meal, then leave the rest to him. His choices are superb, creative, and result in a carefully balanced meal. \n\nDaigo manages to excel in both the ultra traditional (homemade ankimo, some of the most tender you'll find in SF) and elegantly nouveau (truffled hamachi shots, unexpected yet delicious).

We got in just as it opened and we got tea serviced quickly. The decor is very calm, and the music is soft and jazzy. There are several tables and a sushi counter for those who want to see the chefs go do their sushi magic.  I got my usual order of Dragon Roll and a side order of the special uni *fresh from Fort Bragg*. \n\nMy Dragon Roll was beautifully presented and clean...no sauce drenched everywhere. The unagi portions were nicely portioned and the tempura ebi inside the roll was crispy and fresh! My first time eating a super crispy tempura...they usually end up semi-mushy at other places. Everything tasted clean and well seasoned. I liked my uni maki. They were deliciously fresh and with a hint of wasabi on the top. \nJolene got the maguro sashimi (nice!), and the negihama roll..both looked clean and super fresh.\n\nService was friendly and nice...and we got constant refills on free tea. I never felt rushed and it's a great place to relax and chat awhile. We inquired about the yelp deal we couldn't purchase online prior to coming, and they were gracious enough to give us a $15 discount on our meal. Sweet!!!

Somehow I never thought of venturing to this corner under I read some of the positive reviews about the latest ownership here.  I was not disappointed.  For $14, I ordered the five-piece chef's choice omakaze sashimi and enjoyed the selection (for which I posted a photo).  They were all fresh, tasty, and fairly unique (as in something different from the run-of-the mill selection).  It's a good way to be introduced to a small selection of omakaze sashimi without a strain on the wallet (like a restaurant in San Mateo for which I inquired the price of a similar five-piece chef's choice).  For the dinner I also ordered the saba (mackerel sashimi) which I very much enjoyed.  I also got the hamachi carpaccio, which is an item that I generally like but somehow it didn't stand out very much here.

Everything was awesome; the fish was perfectly fresh, the menu was large enough to contain variety but not so large I was overwhelmed, and the wait staff was very friendly! \n\nMy order included the baked salmon, Naruto, and spicy tuna roll, and salmon and tuna nigiri. I ordered so much food and could not eat it all fast enough! I know it looks like I ordered a lot and you're probably thinking, \"wow, the portions must be really small.\" No, that's not true; I went for a long run today and whenever I run I feel like I can eat the world after wards. The prices were fair, too.  \n\nI like how you can sit at the bar and talk to the sushi chefs. They're pretty knowledgeable and will answer any and all questions you may have about what they're doing etc etc. I was particularly intrigued by how much sushi they prepare in such a short amount of time; I was even more mesmerized when I saw both sushi chefs taking out a blow torch and flaming the raw fish! So cool!\n\nMy advice would be to arrive before 7pm as that's when it starts to get busy (and since it's a small restaurant you want to be there early). Bring your cell phone; if you check in on Yelp you get a free ice cream! Overall great find in the city, I'm literally planning my next visit.", "author": "Tommy C."}

Being a professional cook/chef,  I Have a pretty good idea of what fresh fish should taste like and THIS IS IT. Im pretty close to a sushi addict...may even need to get therapy for it. Hahaha. This place is So good and its not super highly priced as i would have expected after having my first few pieces of nigiri and tasting the freshness. And Erik and Jesse are great owners and really treat their customers well. That also has to do with me coming back so frequently.I love this place. Love it. And it's just two blocks away. Lucky me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-11-13", "description": "Hmmm...where should begin? Well, when I walked into the place, no one welcomed me. Place wasn't even crowded to be ignored. The chefs and the servers just stared at me. Not very welcoming. What made it worst was that after I sat down, someone else walked in and was welcomed in Japanese. My bf came in first so he chose to sit at the bar which was fine with me. He already got his cup of tea. I was still waiting for someone to come ask me for my choice of drink. Sat there for 5 mins and no one came to ask me.  Finally, a girl server came and asked us for our orders. I asked her if I can have a cup of tea first, just to give them a hint that I've been waiting!  After scanning the menu, we gave in my order to the server. Here's what we'd ordered...\n\nMoriawase sashimi - 2 pcs each of hamachi, shiro maguro, sake, walu, and Saba. I don't eat tuna unless is marinated so I asked to substitute that with Saba instead. All the fishes tasted normal. Nothing really wowed me.\n\nTuna poki salad - portion was small but tasted good. Wasn't really spicy. Wish the portion was bigger. ):\n\nBeef tataki - now this one was bad. It had no taste. I ate like 2 pcs and that was it. The bf didn't really like it either, but ate the rest since he was hungry. The sauce that accompanied the beef didn't really help much. \n\nNaruto - tasted ok, couldn't really pick up the piece because of the cucumber that wrapped around the mixed fishies didn't seal the piece. I've actually had a similar roll from another restaurant and didn't have a problem picking the piece up with chopsticks. \n\nBaked salmon roll - looked like a lion king roll. Cali roll topped with salmon, tobiko and special sauce. The sauce wasn't that special. Wished the sauce was a lil spicier. The taste was only alright since I've had better at other places. \n\nToro tasting - contained one piece each of shiro maguro toro, sake toro, hamachi toro, and blue fin toro. This was actually the best part of the meal! Then again, how can you go wrong with toro? This dish is actually served per person, so we ordered another set of it. The price was very reasonable. $17 for a set of toro tasting! Can't beat that price! The bf liked it very much! \n\nAnkimo nigiri - a disappointment! Didn't have that taste that I was looking for. The texture wasn't  as firm as how other restaurants prepared it. I've had better! \n\nOverall, food was edible but nothing spectacular. After reading all the good reviews of Daigo, I had high hopes for this place. I drove all the way from Daly City to richmond district just to be disappointed, not to mention that parking isn't so easy on clement! Though my teacup was always filled, tea was actually luke warm. Heard both server and a chef asked the couple who sat next to us at the bar if everything was ok. I was pretty annoyed after hearing that because we didn't get the same treatment. What bothered me the most was one of the chef's nails. Chefs are suppose to have short nails especially if you're handling raw food! Anything will get trapped underneath your nails! Very unprofessional! Also, The place is rather small. If you plan to sit at the bar, I suggest you not unless you like the servers or other patrons bumping into you while you're eating. The cash register was literally right behind where my bf and I were sitting. Also, to get to the restroom, you have to get through between the bar seats and the cash register and into the kitchen. I can't say I'll come back ever again. If the food and service were good, I wouldn't mind driving out of my way just to have a nice meal. Sadly, this place just didn't meet my expectations.", "author": "B L."}

It's a tiny place with minimal ventilation but it was well worth it! Once you walk in, all you smell is fish. Not the bad old fishy smell, but this smell of fresh fish. That's how you know a place is good! ;]\n\nFood:\nWow, I don't even know where to begin! My friends and I ordered so much food that I can't remember mostly what we ordered but I'll try to list it (as I try to retrace my steps on what we ordered)\n\nHamachi Shot:\nOH.MY.GOODNESS! This was the best dish out of everything we ordered. It was def. my number one. I was wary of it since it was a raw egg and all that jazz but! The hamachi was so sweet! It was cut into little pieces and with the combination of the onion, avocado, tobiko, AND TRUFFLE PONZU SAUCE was amazeballs!!!! Mmm...I'm still dreaming about it =)\n\nNaruto:\nThis roll was really good too! It's wrapped without seaweed.  They use cucumber as a binding wrap and it's basically filled with three kinds? of fish. Salmon, spicy tuna, and sake. Yummmmmm. The cucumber was super good as well (and i'm not a veggie person). (my second fav roll)\n\nCowboy:\nNot a fish \"sushi\". It's topped with filet mignon, shiitake mushroom, and tempura scallion. Yum! I think by this point, I tried so many fish rolls that this was an alright roll to me.  The sauce was good as well! It was slightly spicy giving it an interesting taste.\n\nCaterpillar:\nI mean, this one is the most generic roll we ordered. You can never go wrong with unagi. Yum! \n\nOn to the raw stuff (if I can remember)\nHad the salmon sashimi and it was really fresh! It was sweet and had all that salmon-y goodness. Yum!\n\nHamachi toro nigiri:\nWOW. Like....really wow. Obviously it was fresh and it completely melted in my mouth! I've never had ones that melted in my mouth. Definite plus. It was expertly sliced into very thin pieces. Maybe that's why it melted in my mouth? Since most places has a slightly bigger chunk. Def. worth it!\n\nService:\nThe waiters and waitresses were really nice and super efficient.  Every time they see an empty plate, they take it away. Unlike most sushi places, this place has everything come out in order so it doesn't take away the taste of the sushi. For example, they would come out slowly with the sashimi first because those are usually the lighter taste of the course. Then they'll come out with the rolls which are heavier in tastes so it seems like they give the customers a feel for the taste of their food. Basically from light, to heavy so they can enjoy their food.  Service with the food coming out is relatively slow though. We got there around 6:50 and we left around 8. It was a nice place to talk and catch up with  friends.  \n\nAll in all, yes! I will come back...well worth the trip out there since I live in the East Bay. Can't wait to bring people here as well. Not exactly the best place for big groups but I'd bring my group of friends just for the heck of it! The food is so good!", "author": "Denise L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-09-19", "description": "We went there yesterday for the first time because we love Japanese cuisine and this place was recommended by others.  We ordered miso soup, seaweed salad and edamame for appetizers.  They brought the miso soup first and it was not very good.  The soup had very little taste (I think they did not add enough miso).  Worst of all, it was lukewarm!  Little did I know that the miso soup was a precursor for things to come....\n\nThe seaweed salad came next and I thought it was excellent...that is until my sister said that the reason it tasted so good because they used tons of sesame seed oil to flavor it (which is very high in fat and not good for you).  The edamame was good but the portion was small (it came in a small bowl).\n\nFor our main course we ordered a spicy tuna roll, a caterpillar roll and a yellow tail nigiri sushi.  The caterpillar roll was awful, the eel was not fresh, the pieces that I got were the worst cut possible and they didn't prepare the eel correctly (there were still some bones from the eel that they didn't remove).  Also, the cucumber inside the caterpillar roll was hard as rock.  I've never had cucumber in sushi that was that hard before.  Cucumber should be crunchy and juicy.  The spicy tuna roll tasted like sushi that you would get from Safeway.  The fish was way too salty.  The yellow tail nigiri came last.  The tiny piece of yellow tail (nigiri) looked limp and beat up, like a victim of a road kill--it was not at all healthy looking nor very appetizing to look at!  I thought that the portion size of the fish on all of our sushi seemed undersized, smaller in comparison to the size of fish served at other sushi restaurants.  Finally, the rice in the sushi fell apart as I tried to pick it with my chopsticks.\n\nThe dinner was way too pricey for what we ordered (almost $100 including the tip for four adults).  We only ordered four miso soups, three seaweed salads, one edamame, three sushi rolls (my father only had the tofu salad), two $5 draft beers (which were great) and two desserts.  Overall, the small portions and the quality of the fish was definitely not worth $100!  And yes, we left hungry!\n\nThe service was excellent and lots of parking on Clement Street.  Bring lots of quarters, though because 25 cents buys you only 6 minutes!\n\nWe went to Daigo Sushi because of the great Yelp reviews and because of other friend's recommendations.

I loved sitting at the sushi bar because we were able to se what was going out o other tables and we could ask directly what type of fish it was so we could then in turn test it out for ourselves. This is probably TMI, but after dinner my stomach hurt a bit and my bathroom visit wasn't so pleasant. I'm still on the fence about going back, since my taste buds enjoyed it, but the rest of me did not. :/", "author": "Kathy B."}

This city is full of restaurants with lines out the door or 2 hr waits. Realistically this sushi spot should be one of those restaurants. Luckily it's fairly quiet, and of the four times we have been here we have only ever had to wait 15min. There isn't much in terms of cooked food, but the fish is fresh and the service/chefs are legit. Please don't come here.

I've been here a couple of times with friends and the server is very friendly, but both times, he was working by himself and when it got busy, it seemed he was running around, trying to keep up. I've also ordered the tataki and sweet potato fries appetizers and the non-sushi dishes are just as delicious. It is a little cramped so if it's packed, it's not a very comfortable place to eat.

They also have a wide variety of sashimi and it's always quite difficult to decide which to get.  But they do always have some type of toro which is awesome.  The one roll I always get is the toyko cowboy.  Although its the only roll that doesn't have fish in it, it's still my favorite roll here.  The sauce has a nice sweet, tangy, savory flavor to it and the beef on top of the roll is very tender.  This place is also very small and can get busy quick so I suggest arriving early and parking can be difficult.  The service is always friendly and informative.

After spending a good amount for mediocre sushi and $20 a pitcher beer not even filled to the brim, we decided to never spend another dime at this place.  Be wary of Japanese restaurants that aren't Japanese owned or that don't employ Japanese sushi chefs, they are often subpar.  The restaurant staff's mistake was they thought we were too drunk to understand or realize how much they were overcharging.  Our mistake was to believe a non-Japanese staffed restaurant would be any good.  We really only went there because we thought that since our friends were regulars they'd give us a good deal on the price.

After I tried it I was a believer. The outside cucumber wrap holds in the spicy tuna, salmon, and something else. It's quite yummy. The James Roll has seared tuna (?) on top with a jalape\u00f1o that gives a good kick. The beef tataki is also really good.

Well our very first visit was AMAZING!!  The sushi was fresh and the owners and wait staff were pretty awesome to chat with.  We left  knowing that we definitely would be coming back again real soon.  Well our second time there was pretty shocking,  this time we were surprised with a bill that kind of floored us.  We ordered a bottle of sake but was told that they ran out so instead the owner suggested a different bottle.  We didn't' ask for the price because who would've thought that it was going to cost $250!!!!!  And it wasn't even the largest bottle that they had either!  The sake was good but not that great.  Again the food was amazing but wish we were told ahead of time what the prices were before ordering the sake bottle.  Well we decided to come back the 3rd time, and this time it was a little disappointing.  For some reason the sushi didn't seem as fresh and consistent as before.  We ordered the same as before and they seemed a bit different. This time we didn't finish all our dishes as we usually do which is unfortunate because that's money down the drain.  I still have to give them 4 stars because the service was always top notch and our first two experiences were great, besides the surprise of the sake price on our bill.  I think we'll give them another shot (after I'm no longer pregnant and can eat sushi again) because we do like the owners and the staff, just hope that the food will be back to where it used to be when they first opened.", "author": "Paige L."}

We are moderate sushi fans and wanted a quick dinner before going out to the theater.  We were pleasantly surprised by everything about Diago's but especially the sushi - clearly the best we've had in San Francisco.  We spent a long time talking with Jessie, the owner and waiter - he directed us as to choices and was spot on.  We will return - frequently.", "author": "Larry H."}

A typical unassuming restaurant in the sleepy Richmond, but boy what a treat. This place is a keeper. Nice wait staff, pleasant ambiance, but like most of the ethnic places in the Richmond, in need of someone to decorate the place with a warmer feel, cooler appeal, but I guess that is what keeps the Richmond sleepy. Otherwise the sushi was terrific! I don't think there was a roll I didn't absolutely love. So happy to have this place as a 'go to' restaurant within easy walking distance!!", "author": "Duncan K."}

It's small and intimate inside, perfect for a date.  The food is fresh and delicious.  I was very impressed with everything we tried.  The Hamachi carpaccio was fantastic and all of the sashimi melted in your mouth.  I felt that the value was great too.  The quality of the fish was well worth the price.  Service was very good too.  I cannot wait to go back and try it again.", "author": "Sara C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-27", "description": "Fantastic, can't think of superlatives that would truly do the experience justice. We'd been regulars at this space, a few owners ago, when there were loads of photos on the walls, but had stopped going when there was a change in owners and the grease factor increased. It's been a while since Daigo Sushi took the space and I now regret not revisiting the establishment sooner! We rectified that tonight, and WOW, the experience provided matched the satisfaction we experienced eons ago, but Daigo Sushi kicks up those memories a few notches. Top notch service (Courteous and  attentive but not hovering or pushy), reasonable prices, and quality food (in freshness, presentation, and execution). It's as five star as I ever expect to experience. Yes the space is small, the mirrors do their task of expanding the illusion, but the quality was obvious. Flavors were clean, crisp, and fresh - and no grease stink with the focus on what a sushi joint should be about IMO. Guarantee we'll be back, just sad we didn't do so sooner, but looking forward to slowly working our way through the menu!", "author": "Billy B."}

Relaxed ambiance, kind servers, delicious sushi (and beer and saki)! On top of it all, this shop is not packed like sardines, even on a Friday night...which I can only assume is because they are way out in the avenues. Would surely return again to sample more fishes!

We ran into our landlord and he told us we should head over because the restaurant was having their grand opening. Turned out they were having a private grand opening but when we walked in the owner, Jesse, let us sit and eat anyways! He was so sweet and attentive, giving great suggestions for both sushi and sake. I adore that their menu is so small because it means they specialize in those dishes. I would much rather pick from a few phenomenal items than a 3 page menu of mediocrity. The two rolls that stood out as being especially fantastic were the Tokyo Cowboy and, shocking to me, the Golden Veggie Roll. I usually NEVER get veggie rolls but my boyfriend isn't a big fan of fish so the Cowboy and Veggie rolls were my showing gratitude for him going to get sushi with me and WOW! I have dreams about that veggie roll. As soon as I have some extra money I'm treating myself to another great dinner date at this restaurant.", "author": "Angela S."}

It's owned by 2 young guys (Jesse, who did the serving, and the sushi chef himself whose name I didn't catch).  It's a tiny corner place with simple, clean decor.  We ordered the sashimi lunch special, which was salad and 11 pieces of the freshest and most tender fish we've had in awhile, all beautifully sliced and presented. After chatting a bit with Jesse, we were impressed with their thoughtful and clear vision for what they want this place to be. They have a unique sake selection, take special care with little personal touches such as making their own low-sodium soy sauce and going the extra mile with minute details such as marinating ikura before serving it (apparently the standard preparation is to serve it up straight n' salty).  It was an altogether very pleasant and delicious lunch, and really refreshing to meet young restaurateurs who are passionate about their food.  We're glad to see that they also offer online ordering and delivery, so we'll be visiting this restaurant again soon!", "author": "SfMom O."}

They were the smallest rolls I've ever seen at any sushi bar I've been to. The rolls tasted good but the size is not worth your money.

We have found a lot of sushi around this area is not worth spending money on as it is typically stale and overpriced.  That being said, Daigo sushi is always fresh and delicious. You are definitely getting good value for your money. We typically order our usual spicy tuna and salmon nigiri and then a third order of something new. We have yet to be disappointed.", "author": "Amanda M."}

We ordered a few items and was not impressed at all.  Had the beef tataki which is described as seared beef, it was dried up and not tasty at all.  The poke was tasty but the order was definitely smaller than most places, there was maybe a tablespoon of small cubed tuna in the order.  Next came the spider roll, the crab was cold and chewy not freshly fried like I'm use to.  Citrus salmon was the best, tasty and fresh.  There are way better sushi places in the area so no need to return to this one.  Had hoped this place would be good and sadly disappointed.", "author": "Genie G."}

The food tasted great and left me feeling very good afterwards.  The quality of the food was of highest standards.

I must say the service was extraordinary and I usually find it difficult for me to say that. The waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable. We arrived just before it got busier and even when it was busy, the waiter was still really attentive, in a positive way. It was my first time drinking sake and my friend wasn't quite familiar either, so we asked for help with the fairly large selection of sakes. We ordered what the waiter suggested and he even gave us tips on drinking sake, which was much appreciated for a beginner. As for sushi, we ordered the saba nigiri, dragon roll, spider roll, and the aburi saba roll (from the special sushi menu?). All were very well made and flavorful and the price was reasonable for the quality and portion. &Dear Waiter, thank you for the ginger ice cream and wishing me a happy birthday. The ice cream was delicious and very unique. I definitely left the place smiling and would love to go back again.", "author": "Mary P."}
