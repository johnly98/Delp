I've had it both in the restaurant and as take out and it's HUGE! I also love the elote a lot. I've seen friends order everything else on the menu and the portions are always generous and delicious. But I never venture from my salad because...I love it that much. I feel like it's the dressing that makes it extra good.?? I always order more on the side.\n\nThe staff is very friendly. The margaritas are also good but if you have too many you'll have quite the hangover. (...speaking from experience.) \n\nI was worried about Bonita when Tacolicious moved in across the street...but would pick it over tacolicious every time.", "author": "Taylor G."}

Tasty food, killer salsa, and prices that aren't great but aren't TOO bad. \n\nFrom the look of the menu and pictures, I was expecting things to be pretty bland and whitewashed, but I figured I'd give it a try, and I'm glad I did. I got the bonita bowl, and it was delicious - and a generous portion. I got pastorcito, and I'm not 100% sure what that was - Google wasn't much help - I'm guessing similar to el pastor? Either way it was muy sabroso.\n\nThe salsas were outstanding, too. Their habanero salsa manages to have all of the flavor of habaneros with very little of the heat - it was making my mouth do a double take. A very weird sensation to be sure.\n\nMy roommate got the burrito and chips and salsa; the burrito was good but the \"salsa\" was just pico de gallo (very disappointing given that their actual salsas are so good!)\n\nI don't know if I'd go there very often given that Pancho's is nearby, but I definitely wouldn't mind returning! Their delivery was also very speedy, which was awesome.", "author": "Chris S."}

And as Robert Frost once wrote, \"Two roads diverged and I was presented with two taquerias (Tacolicious and Bonita Taqueria Y Rotisserie)... and I took the one less traveled by, and that made all the difference.\" Wel,, I'm pretty sure he said something along those lines. In any case, I had never dined here before and it didn't look like too long of a wait. So my decision was made! \n\nBonita has your standard taqueria offerings (burritos, tacos, fajitas, salads, tortillas soup, etc.). I opted for the street tacos made with rotisserie chicken (see posted photo). I must say that I was pleasantly surprised with the flavors and portion size. At many taco stands, \"street tacos\" means super tiny. But for $7.95 I got three adult size tacos made with corn tortillas and topped with onions, cilantro, and a generous helping of juicy chicken. I certainly didn't walk away hungry. It was a perfectly satisfying meal for under $10. \n\nLong story short... I could certainly see myself returning here for lunch if I was back in the neighborhood, or if I was looking for a late night bite after bar hopping in the Marina.", "author": "Kevin B."}

Ok then...\nI passed this place and realized I was hungry and need to get grub in me before a movie I was seeing down the street. \nAfter staring at the menu for moment I decided on the California burrito with steak,(I saw sour cream and said yes) and my companion got steak tacos. \nWe sat at the bar facing the street ready to show everyone how we got down with food and waited for our food. And delivered it was. \n\nI took a bite and my mouth was immediately happy! Those dang potatoes. They were freaking tasty. Mixed in with the beans, sour cream, salsa and steak there was no sense of loss for the rice I usually love. I let my companion taste, and they liked it. So much so that I offered them some more but they stayed with their tacos (which were really good btw)... but as I got full, I offered them more. I mean who gets full on two tacos (ok some people do... just not me)? And they took the rest of my burrito. Saying they were waiting for me to finish so they could have at it. \nI washed this all down with a bottle Coca Cola (glass bottle with real folks). \n\nI was stuffed by the time I rolled out of there.

Didn't feel like a typical authentic Mexican place but overall it was good for the neighborhood. We came here to eat a late lunch (4:30pm) after walking around Chrissy Fields and were starving. We sat outside at the bar area cause it felt nice and breezy and casual. They have a pretty nice outside seating (tables for two) and also plenty of space inside. You have to order and pay first and the staff brings the food over.\n\nWe ordered separately but the food order got messed up. The biggest concern was when the meat eaters ended up with the veg burrito and the vegetarian person was eating the carne asada burrito. That's a huge mistake from their part. We got lucky the veg person wasn't allergic and was chilled out with it after we found out, but this is not cool at all. We brought it to their attention about the mixed up in our order and they did offer to bring new order but at that point we all had 1/3 of the burritos so it didn't make sense. What was eaten was already digesting so we didn't make a big fuss about it but I was pretty shocked.\n\nBetween the 5 of us we ordered:\n\n- 2 burrito bowls\n- 1 veg classic burrito\n- carne asada bonita burrito\n- pascarcito grilled pork taco\n- baja style fried fish taco\n\nThe bowls were huge and they looked like a jungle with way too many things in it so needless to say our friends didn't finish it.\n\nPork taco was good but the fried fish taco stole the show. \n\nBonita carne asada burrito was a good size, tasty but very little pieces of meat inside.

You can also sit outside if the weather is warm. But, on a recent Saturday visit, the volume of the music was too loud.

Walked this place today and I realized I never seen it before so I decided to come in to try their food. This is a definitely an Americanized Mexican restaurant where most of the menu caters towards white Americans. The interior is very simple with tables in the front but you must order before you sit down. The menu is simple, not many option but definitely enough options to make a choice. Me and my friend decided to order the NorCal burrito which is beans, choice of meat, gauc, pico de gallo, and instead of rice, it's makes with potatoes. We also got a street side and chips salsa, & gauc for $7.95. This is definitely overpriced because it comes with way too much dip and not enough chips. The burrito came and I split it in half with my friend. The meat is very tender and juicy which I really liked. On the other hand, the potatoes replacing the rice in the burritos is something different. Other than that, it's not really special. You can definitely get something better in the excelsior district for a much better price. \nI'd come back for the tacos and tortilla soup.", "author": "Lisa W."}

The cashier was friendly but for some reason every time I order here my order is messed up in one way or another. I am allergic to dairy and ordered their Nor-Cal burrito without any cheese or sour cream. I received my order and went on my way, in hindsight I wish I'd checked my order before leaving. When I went to take a bite my burrito not only had cheese but sour cream as well, on top of that they had given me their basic burrito instead of the one I had ordered and paid extra for. In addition to that I was sick for three days after ingesting such intense dairy content. Every time I order my food to-go from Bonita they give me the basic one instead of the one I pay extra for. I don't know if this is a common theme but having this happen three times is more than a coincidence.", "author": "Diana R."}

The manager or guy in charge was somewhat apologetic, but seemed annoyed when it really was their fault. It would have been nice to comp the food since they messed it up 3 times, but not all restaurants have good customer service, I guess. To make things worse, when I got my food, it was so bland!

There's a big bench style table in the middle and can fit a few parties. I like that the tables are stainless steal, easy clean up. When you enter, you go to the back, order your meal and they'll call you when it's ready. The menu is on a big lit back board and easy to ready. \n\nFor dinner, we got the best value in my opinion! The Bonita bowl for $10.95 and chips and salsa side for $3.50. The chips and salsa was HUGE! It was served on a rectangular platter with guacamole and salsa, lots of it. Then the bowl. OH-EM-GEE, what a gigantic serving! Served with your choice of meat (I chose Rotisserie chicken), rice, beans, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream & guacamole. This was such a great deal and the flavors were great! Lots of protein so you know it was worth the price tag.

Enter Bonita Taqueria Y Rotisserie, an overwrought name for a tiny Chestnut Street storefront in San Francisco's Marina district.  \n\nBTYR's meal-sized salad, La Campesina Ensalada comes close to perfection.  The salad is big, fresh, and filled with fork-finds like pumpkin seeds, avocado, roasted corn, black beans, and cotija cheese.  The addition of excellent carne asada, for a few dollars extra, puts the salad into the category of things I'd gladly return to on a weekly basis.  \n \nWith its Marina location and a crowd straight out of Marina District Central Casting it's obvious that this isn't an authentic Mexican taqueria.  It's a busy little hive packed with bar-height counters, backless stools, and lots of young beer/margarita drinking patrons who you'll eye-plead with to please vacate their stools before your food is served.  \n\nDespite the salad, not all menu items are created equal.  BTYR was the first place I ever had an ear of Mexican corn (elote) which I disliked.  I'm also not fond of the fact that chips and salsa (pico de gallo) are not provided gratis.  A spicy margarita was delicious, with significant chunks of colorful peppers but no evidence of actual tequila.  These seem like mere quibbles however; as the La Campesina Ensalada with carne asada was that good.\n\nWith Tacolicious on one end of Chestnut, Mamacita on the other, and BTYR sitting in between there's some serious competition here for your Mexican-ish dining dollar.  If you're looking for a fast, casual dining experience and an excellent, filling salad for under $15 I'd recommend giving BTYR a try.", "author": "Tracey A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-01", "description": "This review is based on 2 different experiences in the past week:\n\nThe first time I came here, I was craving a burrito. Tacko is my usual spot, but since Bonita is new in the neighborhood I wanted to give it a try. I ordered the Bonita burrito with rotisserie chicken. The idea of the juicy flavorful rotisserie chicken as the meat made me so excited. But truly, this burrito was a letdown. Granted, I ordered it without cheese or sour cream because I have a lactose allergy. But still, I've had great burritos that lacked those ingredients. This one just seemed to lack flavor. I wouldn't recommend the black beans in a burrito - how about an option for whole pinto beans?? Also, the chicken. Sadly, it lacked the flavor, and it also had a giant piece of gristle in it which grossed me out.\n\nBased on this burrito, I'd give Bonita a 2-star rating.\n\nBUT, they did redeem themselves somewhat. \n\nIf were up to me, I probably would NOT have given them a second chance. But a friend in town wanted a burrito bowl, chipotle style. Since there are no Chipotles in the Marina, the closest thing I could think of were the burrito bowls at Bonita. So I begrudgingly gave them another try. \n\nThis time I ordered the salad and topped it with carne asada (and warned my friend against the chicken - he ended up ordering the bonita burrito bowl with carne asada). Both the burrito bowl and the salad were very generous portions and both very tasty. I'd recommend the carne asada, much more flavorful.\n\nSo based on the salad and burrito bowl, I'd give Bonita a solid 4-star rating. \n\nGiven the two vastly different experiences, I'm gonna average the two and call this place a 3-star. But they could sway me with more good food to up in to a 4 in the future, so stay tuned for a possibly update.", "author": "Krista S."}

I have now been there 3 times and have had 0/3 good experiences. \n\nThe primary problem here is the place calls itself a Rotisserie.  I ordered the rotisserie chicken and it was almost un-edible.  It had no flavor, the temperature was luke-warm, and the meat was rubbery.   Probably the worst Rotisseries chicken I've ever had in my life and I've been to some sketchy ones in places like Ecuador and Colombia.  Imagine a supermarket rotisserrie chicken left in a freezer for a month, then cooked by being boiled in water.  That's how it tasted.\n\nThe second problem here is the place calls itself a Tacqueria.  Unlike a 'Mexican restaurant', Tacquerias' tend to have very fast service and consistent quality.  I ordered a burrito from this place and it took 15 minutes to prepare, arrived cold, and was just a mess of beans, guacamole and congealed cheese bits.

I told the same lady and she points to the menu board and tells me everything that comes in the burrito.  I was like...seriously?  There's nobody here... you don't recall me asking you to hold the beans, sour cream and guac...and you repeated it all back to me before submitting the order?  She turns away and heads to the kitchen to get my order fixed...with tons of attitude.

(Pun intended)\n\nI am currently in the process of eating a veggie burrito from Bonita. When I started talking to the \"guy (seemingly) in charge,\" he explained that the brown rice is vegetarian, although when they first opened it wasn't. Something like this makes me skeptical whether it has really changed, since they've only been open a week-ish. Skepticism aside, I knew the burrito would be bad the second it was handed to me, because guess what? It was barely lukewarm. No orders before me and I was prepared to wait 10 mins for my food, but it came out cold after maybe 3 mins. \n\nTo put things into perspective, I literally haven't eaten all day, and it's 8:30p so I will eat just about anything, which is why I took the burrito home anyways. Biting into the burrito, the rice doesn't look very brown to me, nor is it warm. The only thing vaguely warm is the refried black beans. The burrito might have all of the basic components you'd need, but zero flavor. I'm so hungry I'd thought I'd eat it anyways, but with every bite I'm questioning taking it back and just saying \"here, I don't want this.\" \n\nMaybe I should have gone to Toma for nachos, all I wanted way something with a bit of warm, melted cheese!\n\nIN SUMMATION: a cold burrito with no flavor for over $10?

They only have black refried beans, but these were delicious. The rice was well seasoned. The cheese (cotija?) was a little cold, which can be a downer. It worked here, however, providing little crumbles of seasoning like parmesan cheese on pasta.\n\nThe owners seem super friendly and eager to please. One suggestion if they read this review: consider renaming the \"Nor Cal\" burrito something else. I've never seen potatoes on a burrito in Northern California.

Why do you do this to me?  \n\nI was thrilled when this place opened up a mere 2 blocks from my apt.  I love me a good taco or burrito and it seemed like this place was going to be legit.  And it often is.  My first order here was the nor-cal burrito bowl (with potatoes instead of rice) and it was AMAZING.  The potatoes were gloriously soft, flavorful pillows that complimented the rest of the burrito bowl.  I was hooked.  \n\nSo why 2 stars?  It's the inconsistency of this place that drives me insane.  Some days, the food is spot on delicious - the chicken will be moist and juicy, the potatoes cooked perfectly, the spices on point.  Other times, it's a total flop - chicken is dry, potatoes are underdone. I've experimented with different dishes and some are more consistent: the carne asada burrito (or bowl, if you choose) is usually spot on.  Sadly, I have ordered this to go and - more than once - gotten home to discover they have given me a chicken burrito bowl instead.  UGH.  It's just so frustrating!

Our favorite taquerias are in the Mission but since we were starving and in the Marina, we stopped in. I had a shrimp burrito bowl and my son had a shrimp burrito. It was pretty big and damn good for $11ish It was fresh, the salsas were really good And I recommend the jamaica agua fresca. The workers were really nice! 4stars only because I spent $32 with tip at a taqueria for 2 things and a drink & I never do that....", "author": "bree m."}

I ordered a vegetarian burrito bowl. The flavor was terrible, the rice was sticky, the beans were undercooked, and half of the bowl was filled with lettuce. I ate a few bites and went up to the counter to tell them I didn't like it, their response was \"you ate too much of it for us to refund you\" and they wouldn't make a new one. They said the most they could do was make me a single taco or a side of chips. As humiliated as I was already, the lady at the counter took out her phone, snapped a picture,  and said \"you're going to give us a bad review anyway so this will show that you didn't just eat a few bites.\" As a business owner myself and a local to the Marina neighborhood, I will never go back to this place.", "author": "Joshua P."}

Although he wasn't working, his coworker didn't hesitate to help me. She had my order ready promptly and didn't charge me for it. I wish I got her name, and had more than $3 on me for tip, because she was so pleasant.

It was SO dry and overcooked, my husband even commented that it looked a little gray. It was flavorless and chewy. My daughter got a shrimp taco. For $4.95 each, there were just two sad little shrimp in there. The corn tortilla was hard and looked undercooked. Chips and guacamole were fine, but that's the only positive.

Got the roast chicken an assortment of tacos the macho nachos a side of rice and a quesadilla. Waited ten minutes then walked back which took about ten minutes. Stood in line for another ten minutes to be told it was almost ready. Waited another 15 minutes till we finally got our food. By the time we got home half the food was barely warm. While we were waiting for our order you could see him put an item in every few minutes and apparently it wasn't all cooked at the same time. Too bad because it was pretty good but would have been better if eaten freshly made. Some places just aren't worth getting take out and this is one of them. The place was very very busy with not enough wait staff. While we were waiting several people came up to the counter wanting stuff that was forgotten. Overall the food was decent.

I had a mixed order of street tacos with pastorcito, carnitas and carne asada. The pastorcito meat was undercooked and under seasoned. There were big chunks of chewy, pink pork that were inedible. The carne asada wasn't fresh tasting and not very flavorful. The carnitas better in comparison, but still not very flavorful. \n\nThe campesina salad was very bland. There is no punch to the salad dressing.\n\nBetween the salad and the tacos visit, I had the tortilla soup. It was extremely good. The broth is so flavorful and rich.

Couldn't tell you if the meat was good because there was so little I couldn't really taste it. Also, it was over filled with potatoes. \n\nAnother observation: The person who designed this place must have been an amateur. You have the line to order blocking the kitchen so basically the staff bringing food to customers is constantly having to push through the line ordering so its just one big process of shuffling around while you are in the restaurant.

We live in San Diego, so we are used to good Mexican food at reasonable prices.  My son like carne asada burrito's (he's 9,) but Bonita didn't have anything simple, that didn't include onions and peppers.  I decided to ask if they could make a burrito with just the carne asada, cheese and guacamole for him.  They said sure.  A man, came over to ask me what exactly I wanted, because he said cheese and guacamole didn't come in the \"Classico.\"  I told him I didn't order the classico, that I have a picky 9 year old, and he just wants meat cheese and guacamole.  His burrito came with very little meat, lots of guacamole and no cheese.  Needless to say, he didn't like it very much.  I tried to scoop out some of the guac, so he could eat it.\nI ordered their \"Bonita Bowl,\" which sounded good.  I got carne asada, and it comes with beans, rice, sour cream, guacamole and they said they put it on lettuce.  We took the food to go, and when I got to my hotel, I was shocked when I opened it up, because more than half of it is was lettuce.  I didn't order a salad.  What was most disappointing was that there was very little meat.  I guess I am very spoiled living in San Diego, because when you order carne asada anything, the meat is the star of the show.  I could barely even taste any meat.\nI'm guessing had I eaten there, things would have been better, and the rotisserie chicken did look good, but we had really wished we had gone to Pluto's instead.
