Food was great, service is amazing and the restaurant itself is soooo cute, especially with the outdoor patio space.\n\nI went for a Saturday dinner with a couple friends and we had the best time! There's a bit of a wait, so we put our names down and had a few drinks at some nearby bars. Once we were seated, our server Matt was a total delight and recommended the meatballs, arancini and Moto pizza. We decided to get those items as well as the seasonal burrata dish, the cavatelli and a bottle of wine!\n\nThe appetizers came out very quickly and the meal was well-paced. Matt was funny and engaging and provided the right amount of attentiveness- not overbearing but still present! \n\nThe food was very tasty- the standouts were the burrata, meatballs, and moto pizza. The meatballs were very flavorful and juicy, and the tart yogurt sauce kept the dish from being too heavy. The burrata was AMAZING and was complimented by the nectarines. The Moto pizza was really interesting and flavorful, and I liked the crust of the pizza more than the pizza crust at Beretta. I was a little disappointed they only had one pasta option but that just means that we need to eat more pizza the next time we come here! Definitely not a bad compromise. \n\nThe restaurant is on the smaller side, so I'd recommend only coming with a party of 4 or less if you're not sitting outside. Overall, I think this is a great spot to go with close friends or on a date. The atmosphere is super pleasant and all of the wait-staff is really nice and personable.", "author": "Michelle V."}

Their Moto pizza that I've had every time I've been there was garbage. No umami, was a chore to eat the bland sausages balls and the Portabella mushroom was tough.  \n\nWe asked for Parmesan and chilly flakes - she said right back but never returned. We had to scrape all the toppings off the pizza and just eat the bread (with the lamb meatballs which were really good).  I honestly don't know how such an amazing pizza came out so inedible. And as she never returned - we couldn't provide any feedback nor get anything that could help it.  We left hungry (reflected in my tip) and walked to poppeys chicken a few blocks up and got some chicken which we had to eat at the bus stop because they were closing. \n\nIm not going to go back after that - so so sad to given how much I used to like them (and their service).

We arrived around  8 and the restaurant was pretty busy. Luckily, a party was just about to leave when we arrived. If you like your personal space, this is not the place for you. The restaurant isn't too big, so the 2-4 person tables are set up pretty close together. \n\nWe ordered the rigatoni with rustic fresh tomato sauce and the Moto pie. I was excited for the pie since it looked so good in pictures, but was quite disappointed. It lacked a little flavor for me. It tasted like an average mushroom pizza. The rigatoni on the otherhand gave me the complete opposite reaction. I usually don't care for pastas with tomato sauce, but I loved the rigatoni. That was the real winner of the night. My friend and I were basically trying to lick our plate clean of the sauce, without seeming too obvious that that's what we were trying to do. I would come back here just for the rigatoni, although I don't think they always have it. \n\nIf you have a choice, ask to be seated in the outdoor patio!

One is a bit much for one person so I would suggest sharing one pie and a salad.\n-The mushroom pizza tasted very cheesy.

We didn't have to wait at all which, from what I read on Yelp, seems to be a constant issue with Ragazza. Our waiter was friendly and our waters were refilled frequently. We decided to split 2 pizzas so we didn't try any of their appetizers or have any wine. We had:\n\n-Margherita ($14): This was great and definitely our favorite. One of the better Margherita pizzas that I have had in SF and it wasn't too heavy.\n\n-Magic Mushroom ($17): This was a bit funky and earthy for us. Points for creativity but this was a bit heavy. I don't think either of us would order this again.\n\nOverall, I thought 2 pizzas was the right amount for 2 people but I could see splitting one and an appetizer if you weren't too hungry. We had 1 leftover slice (my friend's hehe) but I even had to struggle to eat my portion of the pizza a bit. I don't think the price was too bad for thin-crust, upscale pizza but I do think there are a lot of places in the city that do this as well as Ragazza. Overall, I am pretty excited that we are getting a restaurant with the same owner as Ragazza/Gialina in Noe Valley and I am sure I will go. I definitely do see what others are saying that it isn't worth the wait and I think if I had waited longer than 20 minutes and eaten the pizza we had, I would be mad.", "author": "Carrie W."}

It is gorgeous to dine within the plants and it's like a secret garden in the city. The pizza selection is reasonable with seasonal offerings as well as the classic Margherita. The pancetta one with the egg was kind of salty but the other ones were good. It is pretty overpriced but some people think it's worth it for the ambiance. The Margherita was the best in my opinion because it was simple but the ingredients really shine. The crust is chewy and ultra thin, and the sauce taste fresh and vibrant. However, I'd advise to eat it quickly because it is a thin pizza and it will get soggy if left out for too long.

Everyone in the group was raving about each course. \n\nOn top of the delicious meal, the staff made the experience unforgettable. I accidentally confirmed dinner for 15 people even though I had reserved the space to fit up to 22, and there were 22 guests in total.

Yes, it's a little pricey, but for what you get, I highly recommend it. We started with the buffata, which that alone was a great gooey starter. We also got the stuffed rice balls (arancini), which on a cold San Francisco night, this was highly needed. Their cavatelli is perfectly made, not too heavy and not falling apart and their panna cotta was divine. Ideally go in the middle of the week, when parking is hopefully not as bad.", "author": "Carolina S."}

Hence, we left and tried another restaurant. \nOn our last meal in San Francisco we decided to return early to give it a try. Our decision to go back was the right choice of the day. \nThe deco of the restaurant was full of family photos. Which I reckon it is the owner's family photos. \nThey serve pies and pasta. When I saw pie in the menu I thought it was a pie as in pastry covered with fillings inside. The pie in this particular restaurant is a pizza. We ordered the Pies - Amatriciana w/ tomato, Olli pancetta, Calabrian chilies, pecorino, oregano & an organic egg. The pie's crust was amazingly crunchy yet soft and chewy inside. The flavours of the pie is dimensional. Every layer that you chew through the taste was flavourful. \nAntipasti we ordered was Local Asparagus w/ Greek yogurt, black tahini, hardboiled egg & chili oil. Both the dishes that we had was amazing! If I am back in San Francisco again. I will return to try their pizza.", "author": "Melissa K."}

He seriously made our night. From his banter welcoming us to the restaurant and then helping us decide on our wine, he made for a great start to the evening. \n\nOur wine was delicious, he let us try a few things to land on what we wanted. We had to wait about 20-25 mins for a table, but we got to sit in this really adorable, lush garden courtyard area in the back. Super cute and inviting. A perfect place to hang out and probably a great spot for a small event/intimate dinner with a group a friends. \n\nThen our food was delicious. The arancini, cavatelli, and burrata were all home runs to start. We got two pizzas, the moto and then a white one with lots of arugula and figs that were to die for. Really delicious start to finish. I would definitely venture back when I'm in the SF area again.", "author": "Alicia C."}

We tried the Kale Mary and Putanesca pizzas. The Putanesca owned up to its intentions, delivering all the flavor one would hope for from a Putanesca, but without overpowering the senses and taking away from blissfully encountering the perfectly crafted crust: thinnest in the middle, crispest around the edges, and flavorful enough to taste, even through the rush of Putanesca induced emotions flooding the gates of thine palate. The Kale Mary paired very well with the Putanesca, in the same way that a right-hand glove pairs very well with a left-hand glove. That is to say, awesome irony of their names aside: they were clearly meant for each other! \"Tangy\" might be the best word to describe the Kale Mary, which, in our case, flirted with the Putanesca's aggressions by way of dancing upon our lips with the smooth and focused assertiveness of a pizza that just so totally wants to be your boss.

This place made a few appearances on the 7x7 list so we went in with high expectations. Getting there a bit early on a Sunday afternoon we were lucky enough to get the last open table.\n\nArancini - 2/5 - Decent arancini. The pesto got drowned out in the sauce by the tomato flavor. \nMozzerella, Prosciutto & Crackerbread - 3/5 - Tasty dish with a generous serving of mozzerella and crackerbread although not quite enough prosciutto to pair up with.\nPizza - 4/5 - What stood out the most to me was how thin and crispy the crust of this pizza was, which I enjoyed. We started with a margherita and added pancetta, garlic, mushrooms and an egg to it. While this was a quality pizza, I don't think it earns a spot as a top pizza option in SF.\n\nOverall, I had a decent experience at Ragazza.

The outside was very crisp, and the inside was soft and creamy with the melted cheese. The tomato added a very sharp flavor as well.\n\n* Kale & Little Gem Lettuces w/ beets, farro, avocado, radish & green goddess dressing ($10 size) - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ragazza-san-francisco?select=dfd3tN6s6HVylyAzH5y0Ig#DwQlduOJ7r-d6Bjdj2g5kA\nThis had a good mixture of textures with the thick, grainy farro and fairly heavy dressing. I thought the kale could be more crisp though, and overall there could be a little more flavor (the dressing was a little bland). \n\n* Hand Pulled Mozzarella w/ honeydew melon, purslane, Prosciutto di Parma & cracker bread ($14) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ragazza-san-francisco?select=dfd3tN6s6HVylyAzH5y0Ig#l9AQdiOjoiq3ygzpdMVjjg\nThe mozzarella was very soft and fresh. The honeydew was a little out of place. The purslane was really interesting - we were all wondering what it was and had to look back at the menu. The crackers were very crisp but not super crumbly - they were good for breaking into bite-sized pieces to eat with the cheese.\n\nPASTAS & ROASTS: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ragazza-san-francisco?select=dfd3tN6s6HVylyAzH5y0Ig#cb6YFtZl5mVInRfjmZOizA\n* House-Made Cavatelli w/ carbonara sauce, guanciale, English peas & Parmigiano ($17) - 5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ragazza-san-francisco?select=dfd3tN6s6HVylyAzH5y0Ig#g5yXkQGMahNejs6L0mtW4w\nThis had a perfect chewy texture, just the right amount of sauce (which was very thick and tasty), and overall we all found this very delicious!\n\nPIES: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ragazza-san-francisco?select=dfd3tN6s6HVylyAzH5y0Ig#T3XeO5u7v8GZA7OuxccrwA\n* Moto - tomato, Calabrian chilies, mushrooms, red onion, sausage & mozzarella ($16) - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ragazza-san-francisco?select=dfd3tN6s6HVylyAzH5y0Ig#pcv04P7u8YhuQaWnfzOx0w\nThis had a pretty good kick of spiciness to it.

It was definitely pretty salty! I did like the extra burst of flavor, but my friends thought it was a little much. They didn't do traditional radial slices, but instead cut this into squares. We didn't request this but didn't mind - maybe it was because we had extra eggs, to help us share? Just something to keep in mind in case you're particular about the way your pizza is sliced.\n\nDESSERTS: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ragazza-san-francisco?select=dfd3tN6s6HVylyAzH5y0Ig#inf6y5smaGZpC0davECO1Q\n* Chocolate Pot de Cr\u00e8me ($7) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ragazza-san-francisco?select=dfd3tN6s6HVylyAzH5y0Ig#cj7_QPyn525CGSbWYnsdng\nThe whip cream was a little light, but the chocolate itself was dense yet soft & smooth.

I originally nixed the idea of *another* pizza after our two entrees, but this was significantly different. The crust is much thicker and softer, also a bit grainy. It had this amazing fresh bread smell. I really loved it and could have just eaten it as plain bread! We also liked that the nutella was topped with mascarpone, which is a little denser and thicker than whipped cream (which would have started melting and falling apart pretty quickly). The mascarpone added more to the overall texture of the dessert.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

The food was delicious and interesting and Eric and Vanessa were as welcoming, friendly, and attentive as they could be. \n\nRagazza is one of those neighborhood gems with amazing cusine that San Francisco is famous for. One of my close friends who grew up in Italy told me Ragazza was one of her favorite places and after listening to her gush I decided to give it a try. Ragazza has a very relaxed atmosphere but also appears very clean and comfortable. I really like open kitchens and you can watch as your food is being prepared.\n\nTheir specialty is pizza but they have several other items on the menu. My appetizer was the lamb and pork meatballs served over Greek yogurt and a tasty pistachio salsa verde. The cool and tangy yogurt presented an interesting counterpoint to the warm and spicy meatballs and the pistachio salsa verde gave the entire dish an interesting kick. My entree was a flavorful saffron tagliatelle with chanterelle and maitake mushrooms, espelette-Meyer lemon butter and parmigiano cheese which I enjoyed with a glass of Fattoria Selvapiana chianti. The tagliatelle was delicious and the saffron flavor blended perfectly with the fleshy buttered mushrooms which were likewise cooked just right. I also had a crunchy and tangy side dish of fresh asparagus served on top of a generous dollop of black tahini yogurt and lightly toasted sesame seeds. Of course I wasn't leaving without dessert, and the honey lavender panna cotta with fresh, plump blackberries was perfectly finished with a glass of Quinta De La Rosa ruby port. \n\nOverall this was a wonderful dining experience and I hope to repeat it soon.", "author": "Lou S."}

I came here with three other people on a Saturday night, and the wait was around 45 minutes. My friend conveniently lives literally around the corner, so it worked out well since we just had to wait for a text from the restaurant saying our table was ready. \n\nBetween the four of us, we ordered two appetizers, three pizzas, and one pasta.\n\nAppetizers: fried arancini & brussels sprouts. The fried arancini (stuffed rice balls) was good because I enjoyed the spicy tomato sauce they came with. The brussels sprouts were a little too soggy in my opinion, but the rest of our group enjoyed them a lot.\n\nThe three pizzas we got were: bianca, brussels sprouts, and pear. I think the bianca was the best - the use of lemon in the pizza really brought the whole thing together for me. I also loved the arugula on top and provolone as the cheese. The brussels sprouts pizza sounded a lot better in my mind. There was way too much bacon on top; it was super aggressive. The shaved brussels sprouts and caramelized onions underneath the slightly burnt bacon layer on top was just too much going on. I didn't get a taste of the pear pizza, but my friend enjoyed it a lot, so I will take his word on it. My friend ordered the ricotta cavatelli and said it was very rich. \n\nI think the best part of the meal was the bianca pizza. It's a pretty good go-to place for Italian food, but I wouldn't say it's super casual or anything since it's more a sit-down meal. Since it's not a super big place, I imagine the wait here can get pretty bad at rush dinner hours.", "author": "Steph V."}

I'm not a huge pizza fan but I make an exception for wood fired pizzas with a thin crust.  When we were in New York, I learned that I like \"New York Style\" pizza.  That's what Regazza is.  If you're looking for a thick, doughy pizza, this is not your jam.  But if you want a pizza where you hesitate between using a fork or folding it in half, this is it.  But beyond that, I don't know what these people put in their sauce, but it is amazing!  It's almost like it's blended with ricotta cheese.  We ordered the Margherita and it was perfect.  Just enough basil and tomato.  Now I'm looking forward to coming back to try the other pies.  They also have a pretty complete wine selection which I plan on checking out on our next visit.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and efficient.  We saw a group of 5 have to wait for about 5 minutes but we were a group of two and we got in, got served, ate and paid pretty quickly all told.  The atmosphere is very comfortable inside (I learned about the gazebo outside as we were leaving) and we definitely could have lingered but we had other plans for the evening.", "author": "Stacy S."}

Food and service. \n\nWe started with a shared appetizer of lamb meatballs which were sensational. Full of flavor and the perfect amount m to share. Then it was one of the best pizzas I've had in a longtime. Full of natural flavor and perfectly cooked. It was a good size without being crazy and not a problem to finish the whole thing. There are many more delicious entrees on the menu and I was surprised I picked a pizza but so glad I did. I was memorable and I don't say that about pizza outside NYC too often. \n\nThe only reason this isn't w 5 star is because we ordered a lemon and verbena panna cotta to end the meal and there was no lemon flavor at all.

We both chose the Restaurant Week menu.\n\nFood: \nThe ingredients were good in their freshness but overall bland. \n-The kale salad was aesthetically pleasing but too creamy and slightly blah. It may have been the inclusion of the farro which made it more filling but also more subdued. This could be a main dish in itself (for future reference).\n-Hanger steak was served cold and was tougher than it should've been to chew. The gorgonzola on top was a nice touch and made the steak more flavorful. The potatoes were decent but the side of veggies was also cold with SUPER hard pieces of ham.\n-Dessert of the chocolate pot de creme was the saving grace and I feel like it was a good move on their end to finish the menu off with this. Light, delicious, and not too sweet. I went back and forth between 3 and 4 stars but feel 4 stars is seriously inflating this menu. 3.5 would be more accurate.\n\nService:\n-Not good. Our waitress was pretty rude and seemed annoyed when coming back to our table to check how things were. Don't ask if you don't care would be my preference.\n\nAtmosphere: \n-Cute spot and I liked the interior. It seemed warm and inviting.\n\nI had to knock off two stars due to the lackluster food and service. I would've expected that both of these would be spot-on during Restaurant Week to attract a more loyal following. Maybe the menu highlighted the wrong dishes? I'll give Ragazza the benefit of the doubt after seeing the other reviews and probably be back to try something else, but there are other restaurants I would prioritize.", "author": "Salma R."}

Don't know if we just got lucky, but we arrived around 7:30 and were seating right way, I'm definitely not complaining! \n\nWe ordered the Fried Arancini to start. It comes with 3 large-ish balls of fried rice in a spicy red sauce. To say the least, it was delicious! Definitely recommend that to share. For our mains we shared the Ricotta Cavatelli, and the Bianca, and Brussel Sprouts pies. I enjoyed the Cavatelli because it had a citrus-y flavor which was very unique for a pasta dish. Out of the two pizzas, I like the Bianca a little more, although it was pretty heavy and a little more cheesy than I like. The brussel sprouts were a little overwhelming and the pizza had a unique chewy texture that I'm not sure I liked. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this place because they have such a variety and their food is good! They only take reservations for a group of 6 or more but it didn't look like it gets to crowded based on my experience! The bill came out to $20/person - more than reasonable for some good quality food in SF!", "author": "Malika R."}

Service was very friendly and helpful. Pizza was good, but not the best. We ordered the zucca (ricotta and butternut squash) pizza and the cheese was a bit dry and crumbly, and slices of the squash were just falling off the pizza. Everyone ended up eating a squash salad and pizza crust since the toppings would not stay on the pizza. The focaccia bread was tasty, but the olive oil and vinegar came out in a narrow little tub. Not conducive to dipping if you wanted some vinegar since it sank in a small dot to the bottom while the rest of your bread soaked up and inch and a half of olive oil. Mmmmm oil bread. We also ordered the hand-pulled mozzarella which was decent.\n\nThe other pizzas we shared included the Triple P (very tasty) and Moto (also good), but we were warned by the server about how spicy these pizzas were going to be. Turns out? Not spicy at all. There's a slight kick, yes, but not enough to call spicy-- especially by San Franciscan standards. Overall, I expected a bit more flavor for the price.

We ordered the large portion and shared it with the table. We also ordered the Moto pizza which has tomato, Calabrian chilies, portobello mushrooms, red onion, sweet Italian sausage and mozzarella.

Pizzas are consistently great, and the salads are usually worth the trip alone.\n\nLately we've gone early on a weekday (like Tuesday) and it's been quick to get seated and served. This week, even with that strategy, was quite busy and we had to wait a good 20 minutes. The place was crowded - every table full. A bit loud, even with their sound-buffers on the ceiling.\n\nThe food:\nAlmost always get the kale/farro salad, with green goddess dressing (ordered lite). It was good but not exceptional. Heavy on the radish, and the kale seemed a bit tougher than usual with lots of stems.  \n\nWe got the moto pie, recommended by the server as the top choice for a meat-pizza. Added an egg, which I ordered on the done side (I don't like the white part runny) - executed perfectly. Sausage was fine to taste - could be chopped into smaller pieces & spread around the pizza a bit more.\n\nI think the level of busy delayed our pizza a little. Understandable. Overall, a decent experience on this visit. Nothing stood out as stellar, but food/service all as expected.\n\nI know it's the big-expensive-City, but it'd be nice to have a few \"house-wine\" options that are under $10/glass.

But then he said \"These flavors are nothing new, I feel like I could get this at Cheesecake Factory!\" (yikes) He would order it again, but it was not an inventive dish you'd make a beeline to Ragazza for. \n\nMeh: \n- Moto pizza - While the toppings worked well together with a nice kick of heat, the crust left something to be desired. Soggy in the middle with overly dry crusts, did not have a good chew. The crust needed more salt in its dough; it was bland and wasn't satisfying.\n\nBad:\n- Fresh Hand Pulled Marinated Mozzarella salad - WTF were they thinking with this? Hot mess. The three massive mozzarella balls were tough and purslane did not work well with the rest of the flavors. Also, this dish was huge, I wish our server mentioned that two salads were way too much for two (non-obese) people. This salad alone would've been enough for 2-4 adults.\n\nAmbiance:\nWHAT? I CAN'T HEAR YOU! Our table was in the middle of two other tables, each about 6\" away on each side. That definitely put a damper on the meal. I heard our neighbors more clearly than my husband. \n\nService:\nService was acceptable/uneventful until the end, just before we stood up to leave. A server was cleaning up the table next to us and spilled a glass of water. It splashed over the entire table and all over my husband. The server was more concerned about the water on himself and did not notice AT ALL that water was also on my husband.

BAD, BAD, BAD ATTITUDE.\n\nLet me preface by saying, this would be a 5 STAR review if it weren't for our waitress, Grace's BAD attitude and BIZARRE behavior. Her behavior was so disconcerting that I decided to skip 6 reviews just to write this one. But, more on that later.\n\nOn Sunday, 10.30.11, my friends and I came to Ragazza at 7 pm for dinner. There are NO reservations and the wait was about 45 minutes. I highly recommend coming on the weekdays instead where there's little to no wait.\n\nF O O D\n*SPECK w/ Stracciatella, Cubanelle Peppers & Housemade Breadsticks ($12) - 4 STARS \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9acPdpguULGPbChPwpS3aw?select=AhYYQwHw2wwGfRe4jJ1veg\nThe warm doughy breadsticks was served with salty prosciutto, creamy and milky burrata-type cheese and crisp sweet tangy peppers. Salty, savory and creamy goodness with a touch of sweetness.\n\n*PIZZAS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9acPdpguULGPbChPwpS3aw?select=G1pXjZAfjbaNHlsPRWYtOw\nThe crust is the quintessential part of a pizza and Ragazza has that down to a \"T\". The pizza crust was flawlessly baked with a slightly charred (not burnt like some places) and blistered outer crust that produced a satisfying light, crackling crispness. The crust was crisp throughout which many other restaurants have a hard time perfecting. \n\n**MOTO w/ Tomato, Calabrian Chilies, Mushrooms & Sausage ($16) - 5 STARS \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9acPdpguULGPbChPwpS3aw?select=XskAnx-wn782bRxKWP2vKw\nOur fav of the night, the Moto had a PERFECT balance of tanginess from the tomato sauce, rich savoryness from the sausage, and earthiness from the mushrooms with a slight kick from the chilies.\n\n**AMATRICIANA w/ Boccalone Pancetta, Chilies, Pecorino & Farm Egg ($16 +$2 for each add'l egg) - 4 STARS \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9acPdpguULGPbChPwpS3aw?select=3_MdSe9c00rPZhDKx7h2zA\nWith a less hearty meatiness, the Amatriciana was a close second with the runny egg being a highlight as it added a creamy decadence to the pizza.\n\n**WILD NETTLES w/ Boccalone Pancetta, Portobella Mushrooms & Aged Provolone ($18) - 3 STARS \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9acPdpguULGPbChPwpS3aw?select=kgKHBnvAQ5ruvrQPWVXoGQ\nThe Wild Nettles pizza was our least favorite. Wild Nettles are a bit assertive in flavor; like a tart spinachy flavor. Too much was used in our pizza which overpowered and hindered the taste of the pancetta, Portobello, and provolone.\n\nS E R V I C E\nWHERE DO I BEGIN?\n\nWe sat at our table for a good 12 minutes without being acknowledged. There were 4 waiters for about 8 tables so it shouldn't have taken that long. \n\nWhen our waitress, Grace finally arrived (I got her name from our receipt), we told her we were ready to order. I waited for several seconds so she can take out her notepad which apparently she didn't need as she blurted, \"You can start talking now...\" Wow, rude much?\n\nI looked around and we seemed to be the only ones without our own pitcher of water. Grace only filled my water halfway so when she brought our pizzas, I asked for more water and chili pepper flakes. That seemed to have hit a nerve with her. Grace looked down at her apron to grab the chili pepper shakers and gave me the most disturbing glare as she slowly sat the shakers on the table. My friends were all shocked at the way she looked at me.\n\nI thought she probably felt bad because she later tried to make small talk with us. However, when I was on my phone taking notes for this review, my friends started laughing and sarcastically remarked, \"She must not like you\". Apparently, when they asked for the bill, she gave me \"that\" stare again.\n\nAs we were waiting for our change, I saw Grace talking to her co-worker. At the corner of my eye I saw her looking at me as she made this odd gesture while shaking her hips as if she was mocking me. She then caught me looking directly at her so she rushed over to us to thank us for coming in. At this point, I was completely stunned with what I just saw and walked out without even saying anything to her.\n\nI've worked in the retail industry for years so I know how tough the service industry can be. I was always polite to Grace so I'm still scratching my head as to what I did to deserve her \"bi- polar\" behavior which is the best way I can describe it. Her bad attitude and disrespectful and strange behavior created one of the most uncomfortable dining experiences in my life. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nCozy and modern with rustic feel with wooden furnishings with black and white paintings.\n\nThere are 30 seats in the indoor dining area and counter seating for 4 in front of the kitchen. There's also outdoor patio seating, however, there are no heat lamps.\n\nP A R K I N G\nDifficult street parking.\n\nRagazza has one of the BEST pizzas in SF (trumps Tony's, Beretta, Delfina, Flour+Water and Zero Zero in my book), but sadly I will NOT be back nor would I recommend it to any of my friends because of Grace. I'm going to be nice and leave it at that.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Perfect.\n\nThree of us sat down at a small table, but that's fine, not too uncomfortable. We ordered the arancini, pasta and maitake mushroom pie, olive oil cake and chocolate tart. They all Amazed me! The portion of pasta is very small but so good I would still order it nex t time, the pie is very innovative, so good so comforting, its a must try for everybody! And lastly, the cake just perfectly ended our dinner. \n\nI really like their dishes because I could tell they made really good use of small and simple ingredients. You can taste all the ingredients in the dishes, they are so simple, yet rare combinations that go really well together!

I stopped by for dinner here with 2 of my good friends, 1 of them was visiting from out of town so we wanted to try something new. Ragazza had good reviews and was close by to our location. So off we went!\n\nThis place isn't huge, so I don't think coming in large groups would be ideal. They also seem to be pretty popular because we came on a Tuesday night and it took a bit for us to be seated. I think they don't take reservations so you should take that into consideration. Don't come here about-to-pass-out-hungry because you may have to wait!\n\nAnyway, the food was absolutely delicious. We ordered the potato pizza and the bucatini pasta to share between the 3 of us. The pasta was definitely my favorite, it had sundried tomatoes and I'm not sure what else but my god. The sauce was perfection! It was just the right amount of food and it disappeared within minutes.\n\nWe then ordered dessert: tiramisu & olive oil cake. The cake wasn't my favorite, it was a bit dry. The tiramisu, on the other hand, was sooooo freakin' good. My friends and I were basically fighting for the last spoonful of it. It was so creamy and delicious.\n\nMy friend and I have plans to come back here, but it's a shame they change the menu so often!

Great ambiance\n\nCons:\n- The pizzas are pretty small. One person would likely be able to eat almost an entire pie - I've definitely been to fancy pizza places where the same prices would buy you a much more sizeable product. I was warned, but still disappointing\n- Overly salty, and initially, the taste (Bianca and Summer Squash) didn't wow me. It was adequate. I will add, though, that we took home some leftovers, and the flavors did improve with 1-2 days\n\nSo, kind of meh.

They have made a commitment to only serve food that is in season and, even though that means they'll take some truly delicious things off of their menu, the seasonal choices they make are top notch. It's very clear that their kitchen staff really understands food and how ingredients go together. We always order waaaaaay too much food and aren't sad about it as the leftovers make great meals for the coming days. My favorite item on the menu is the brussell sprout pizza. Add an egg to it and you're good to go. Also, the arancini is so yummy, particularly the sundried tomato pesto. YUM.\n\nApart from the high quality of the food, the service is top notch. The wait staff is fantastic and very educated about both the food and wine. The only dark spot to their incredible service is their manager who was very rude to our server and (indirectly) to our group. That being said, our waitress was a consummate professional and smiled through it, treating us with respect and like we were her only customers. \n\nIf you're ever in the mood for Italian food, or just a damn good meal, I can't recommend Ragazza strongly enough.", "author": "Kyle M."}

There was no flavor development in the sauces, and we probably went through an entire jar of Parmesan cheese trying to impart some seasoning to our food.  One member of our party commented that the meatballs tasted as though the meat had been freezer-burned.  The pizza crust was perhaps the one redeeming part of the meal.\n\nThe lack of flavor continued into the dessert course with the pots de creme (more like a mild, milk chocolate pudding), a tiramisu which seemed more store-bought than house-made, and an affogato with a generous portion of espresso, but a skimpy portion of ice cream.", "author": "Jennifer R."}

We ordered three pizzas and an appetizer to split among the five of us, and found ourselves with a bit too much food at the end.\n\nFor an appetizer, we ordered the Arancini, which comes with 3 pieces in an order. You can easily add another piece at $3/pc. Though not the main part of the dish, the tomato sauce is delicious! It's quite thick, but seasoned so well. The arancini were fried perfectly, and had a nice texture. \n\nAs for pizzas, we went for the Amatriciana, Cherry Tomatoes, and Wild Nettles. Of the three, the Cherry Tomatoes pizza was my favourite! The toppings were so fresh, and complemented the pizza well. The Amatriciana is also delicious - a more unusual combination of flavours for a pizza. My friend commented that this pizza felt heavier in a way that you wouldn't want to eat a lot of it at once. The Wild Nettles pizza was the most disappointing. I felt like it was way too salty, and the pancetta made it even saltier - would not order this again. All of their pizzas are served on a very thin crust, but the edges of the pizza are so soft and fluffy.

It was pretty spicy but it a really complimentary way- the pie focused on the spice and not the cheese, of which I'm not sure there was much of/ it could've been missing and that would've been fine.

The balance of flavours is perfected here, it's the Umami Burger of pizzas.  These thin-crusts aren't going to fill you up like a hearty deep-dish Patxi's, but your tastebuds will be glowingly satisfied after.  Great for a casual, elegant dinner.  These are the two pizzas we got and they went superbly together:\n\n* Moto (Calabria chillies, portobello mushrooms, Italian sausage, mozzarella):  So good.  Perfectly seasoned, a bit spicy for me even but the meat and mushrooms were filling and really hit the spot.  This went really well with the gorgeous red wine we ordered too.\n\n* Zucca (butternut squash, ricotta cheese):  This one was sweet and creamy, perfect to counter the spiciness of the Moto.  It also had a slight delicate almond flavour.\n\nThe pricing is reasonable:  two girls can share a pizza for $8 / person.  We ordered 2 pies just to get variety, and I got to take half of each pizza home  :)\n\n* * * * UPDATE * * * *\n\nSat out in the gazebo this time.\n\nArugula and Nectarine salad:\nDelicious shaved fennel and hazelnuts\n\nSummer Corn Pizza:  4.5 stars\nSo we cheated and added pork belly. But seriously ricotta cheese on pizzas is genius.\n\nI gotta come back for the Fig and Pork belly pizza and the mozzarella and melon salad next time!", "author": "Letitia L."}

After much finger pointing and mumblings behind the counter, a very rude waitress/manager came over and said \"he can't lie there, he will block people trying to get into the next table\". \n\nAre you proposing to wake up a sleeping baby just so people can get through? Have you ever woken a sleeping baby? \n\nWe were seated along the wall, and the toddler was lying well within the confines of our table. Of course, if people do come by (which did not happen until we were done with dinner), we will certainly move. \n\nEnough about the service, let's talk food. \n\n-Fried Arancini: the fried risotto balls were good, but the tomato pesto the came with it was too acidic and sour. The sauce completely overpowered the subtle creaminess and flavors of the arancini. Good idea, poor execution.\n\n-Baked Rigatoni: We were looking forward to this dish, and expecting a hearty, home-style pasta dish. The rigatoni tasted find enough, but we found whole burnt pieces of sage to be inedible. \n\n-Wile Nettles pizza: Tasted fine to me, but it was the least popular dish for the dinner, not sure why. \n\n-Amatriciana pizza: The pie looked great, with a half cooked egg on top, the presentation was excellent. It was well-liked by everyone, including the sleeping toddler who woke up because of the commotion earlier. \n\nThanks for nothing, Ragazza.", "author": "Toshinobu K."}

They don't get a ton of fan fare either, especially compared to the SF darling Delfina, but their food is five star and has had me coming back for more again and again.\n\nAll of the pizzas are great, my personal favorite being the Moto because I love housemade sausage on a pizza. It's also a little spicy with Calabrian chilies, precluding the need for my normal Sriracha. Also featured are big beautiful portabella mushrooms, red onion, & mozzarella. My only complaint on some of the other pizzas that feature bacon is that they actually put too much bacon....but is that really a complaint? I don't know.\n\nLastly, the warm pulled mozzarella with sage, olive oil and heirloom tomatoes is seriously the stuff dreams are made of. I am addicted. It may be seasonal though, so get it while the getting's good!\n\nOnly drawback to Ragazza is that yes, it's busy pretty much all the time. I typically order to go and pick it up since I live in the neighborhood. If that's not an option, or you are looking to dine out, expect at least a 30 minute wait. Because the place is so small inside, that wait will typically take place outside or at another bar.

Figs, onion and pork belly is such a good combo...sweet and savory again.\n\nWe also had a salad: Wild Arugula w/ Black Mission figs, fennel, goat cheese & pistachios  - excellent.\n\nBottom line this is one of those places where I am both excited and hesitant to try anything else because what I had was all so good and I want it again.

I earned a Dukedom for this place, and I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. For shame... but better late than never!\n\nOk peeps, this place is STELLAR. Everything from the food to the service is great. Let's dive into this deliciousness!\n\nPIZZA:\n*Amatriciana (5 stars - $16, +$2 for extra egg): Runny egg on yo pizza? Say no more! This pizza always comes out perfectly. It's full of flavor (tomato/pancetta/chilis/oregano/egg), and the crust is always baked to a tee - really crispy without being burnt. I usually add an extra egg when I dine in, but if you get it for take out, just cook up an extra egg for yourself and put it on!\n\n*Moto (4 stars - $16): The ingredients on this pizza are a bit more traditional (tomato, sausage, mushroom, chilis, onions), but it's still one of my staples. The only reason why I ding a star is because the crust on this one is sometimes inconsistent. It's not as crispy as the Amatriciana, but sometimes it's softer than other times.\n\n*Heirloom Tomatoes (4.5 stars - $20): Bacon + lots of veggies (tomatoes, arugula, basil)! OM NOM.  The pizza crust always comes out really crispy, like the Amatriciana. And I LOVE all the fresh veggies that top this pizza. I feel like the bacon makes the pizza a tad bit too salty during some bites, but for the most part, this pizza is delicious.\n\nRagazza often has some other seasonal specials on their menu, which I also recommend! But most of their pizzas (Amatriciana/Moto/Margherita/etc.) are usually always on the menu.\n\nSERVICE:\nEveryone is really friendly here and fairly attentive. And even though I don't like revealing this secret, I suppose I will for my fellow Yelpers' sake... sighh... I hear lines can be long, but usually if you have a good idea of what time you want to go, you can call in advance to put your name down. And they usually have a table by the time you arrive.\n\nI genuinely love this place. It's perfect for a casual date night or for a party of 4 (more than 4 can get a little tough, I imagine). There's a good variety of wine, appetizers, pasta (though I haven't tried any yet!), and pizza for everyone to choose. If you haven't tried this place... GET ON IT!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Stuffed with mozzarella and a great flavor but even better in the dense sun dried tomato sauce they were siting atop of .\nLittle Gem salad.  Everything I love in a salad in perfect proportion.

A great dough/crust.  Puffed but still dense. A solid crisp back to front but still tender enough eat without a tug of war.  Excellent flavor all by itself.  The necessary sign of a great pie.   Nicely charred on edges and bottom. That means a perfect cook.   Great range of toppings including the usual trendy ones but a few with a twist as well.  Got the Wild Nettles and the Amatriciana pies.  The Amatriciana had a great sauce but it was spicy.  But so good I ate it anyways despite knowing heartburn might follow.  \n\nNow this is not as good as Pizzeria Mozza crust in Los Angeles,  or maybe Delphina is a bit better as well.  But this is a close cousin and damned near tops in pizza land.  \n\nPrice is of course trendy pizza out of this world, but they are good sized and if you have any bit of decorum or nice waistline you can share with an ap and still be happy.

Nice menu of antipasti and a couple of non-pizza entr\u00e9es as well as intriguing pizzas. Hip vibe. Good time overall.\n\nPizza was delectable. We had wild nettle with portobellos and pancetta. The crust was puffy at the edge, blistery and had a crisper shell that other Neapolitan pizza I've eaten; it also had a toasty note that reminded me of Asian rice crackers. The toppings played well together, though the slabs of pancetta concentrated the saltiness and were tricky to bite off gracefully (if I were cooking, I'd break the pancetta into smaller pieces - and look for a less-salty pancetta).An arugula salad with pear and goat cheese was top-notch -- terrific ingredients and excellent flavor balance. We splurged and had two desserts: affogatto was full-flavored and delicious, and BiRite Brown Sugar Ginger Caramel Swirl ice cream was divine. The only thing we had that was disappointing was a bottle of primitivo - it was uncnaracteristically thin and just a little sharp (not \"off,\" just not a very good wine).\n\nI'm not much for \"hip\" places, but this was OK, although our server could have been a little warmer and more engaging. The room is cute. The noise was not too bad, the music was good, the dim lighting was mostly negotiable. I am greatly in favor of reservations, but we came early so didn't have to wait.

I work in a service based industry so I know how important having good customer service is and how online reviews can really make/break an establishment's reputation... that being said, I feel like my experience is worth sharing so that others don't make the same mistake of coming here with a large party. \nDue to poor communication between the manager and their staff I was forced to pay a $50 fee for 'private' use of their back patio. The only problem is that they seated/served other parties outside while my group was there and then refused to refund me the $50 fee after being told on the phone several days prior that they would. Their managers emails have been short and condescending. Seems like a common trend for him based off reading several other reviews on yelp. Large parties - take your business elsewhere unless you feel like putting up with this type of bs! Such a shame that a restaurant with great food and a great ambiance can leave one with such a bad taste in their mouth due to poor management.", "author": "Jamie Z."}

A lifetime of happiness. \n\nSeriously that's like my life motto. DAEOI is my version of YOLO. So I was really happy to see that this was a restaurant that very prominently dropped an egg on their pizzas. We stopped here before heading to a show at the Independent, and were hungrier than first world citizens really have a right to be. \n\nThey don't take reservations so we called in 20 min before to put our name on the \"waitlist\". They pegged us at a 35 min wait and to their credit that estimate was spot on.... sort of. \n\nWe were seated in 35 minutes, alright, but our waitress was nowhere to be found. When she did show up she disappeared the moment she saw we had not fully decided our order. I'm used to ladies running away from me, but it was her job to at least stay in my immediate vicinity while I tried to order. She reappeared some 10-15 minutes later, just as our stomachs grumbled for her head. \n\nI wanted to take a star off for her, but she was balanced out by the great hostess that night. She noticed we weren't being served and tried to help us out. She also smiled, which was super great and a marked improvement over our waitress. She and the waitress basically existed in a perfect equilibrium with one another.\n\nAnyways, the FOOD:\nWe skipped the antipasto and got right to THE GOODS. Two pizzas for two small people. We don't mess around. We ordered: \n\nAmatriciana - tomato, Olli pancetta, chilies, pecorino, oregano & farm egg  \n \nPotato w/ smoked bacon, leeks, thyme & dolce gorgonzola \n\nAnd they were excellent. They hit all the spots I needed hit and some spots I didn't know I had. AND THEY DROPPED AN EGG ON IT! Excellent. We finished that up right quick.", "author": "Salman Q."}

Needing to be alert for the dangers possibly awaiting us, we ordered some espressos to stay awake after such a comfortable dinner.\n\nI really liked both of the pizzas.  It had been awhile since I've had pizza, but I'd say that they're more generously sized and satiating than both Beretta and Pizzeria Delfina. Unfortunately, I've never ever been to Glen Park so I can't compare it to Gialina.  The heirloom tomato's crust tasted like there was bacon inside it, and if this is so, it is genius!

It's silly and maybe a bit more than slightly juvenile, but pizza is an art form that is very under-appreciated in the world we live in. A good slice is neither flimsy, nor too firm. Neither too thick nor too thin. It has just the write proportion of sauce to cheese to toppings and to that crust should feel like reaching the finish line of a long race.\n\nAs you can probably tell by my star rating, Ragazza does a great job with its pies. The crust is crunchy but never hard and aways tasty. The sauce is of the sweeter variety (every pizza needs red sauce to be considered actual pizza, in my opinion) but was enjoyed by me and every large party of friends I brought to Ragazza. \n\nMy pizza of choice is the Potato Pie, but without Potato and with red sauce. It's to die for. It's a creation of my own and while I do get some funny looks from the waitresses, I've never been denied.

My summer Squash w/ oven roasted tomatoes, white corn, Nostrano salumi  & farmer's pecorino pizza was full of flavors and the dough was thin and chewy, just the way I like it!\n\nMy husband had Amatriciana pizza which he liked also.\n\nThe arincini was okay. It's hard to mess up pan fried rice balls, but I have had better. \n\nWhat impressed me the most was the hostess.

It was still crispy by the time I brought it home, instead of soggy as thin crust pizzas usually get. The taste was excellent. \n* Decent size. Filling for one person.. \n\nCons\n* Its expensive. My bill was $17. That's a bit much for a personal pizza. \n* The box they put tha pizza in is clearly too small for the pizza. They end up breaking apart the slices and stacking them somewhat. Not cool. \n* They totally forgot to pout the calabrien chilies on my pizza and I had paid the extra $1.50 for it.

Smiles through gritted teeth sort of stuff.  They were very busy but the hostess seemed confused a lot of the time.\n\nThe chicken pate was not enjoyable.  The very sweet cherry liqueur/sauce didn't really work for me and the pate itself was very loose and not really a classic pate.\n\nThe arancini were very good.  Crispy on the outside and a strong tomato based sort of pesto which I really enjoyed.  The cavatelli was kind of odd.  Really under seasoned it had an odd sort of creamy cheesy mix.  It kind of tasted a bit like soured milk/cream.  I don't know, it wasn't quite right.  The tomo pizza was the saving grace and it was an authentic tasty, thin crust pizza.\n\nOne pet peeve is to do with the wine. If I order a 2010 Barbera D'Alba then don't bring me the 2012.  I don't know enough about the wines to know if one is better than the other but the wine list should reflect what you actually have in your cellar.  The menu is a piece of paper with the wine list on the back, which was pretty small so hardly a massive effort to keep it current. There is no excuse for not updating your wine list to reflect your actual stock.  It's just lazy.\n\nWould I go again?  Maybe, if it was empty and I didn't have to wait.

Our server was annoyingly, boisterously friendly with the table right next to us (and by right next to us I meant 6 or 7 inches in this small place), awkwardly inept with us, and flat out rude to the poor group of girls on the other side.\n\nDespite the acoustics being pretty well designed to allow you to hear your date in such a small crowded place--there is some sound dampening on the ceiling--we couldn't have a conversation because we were either listening to her talk about her tattoos at the absolute top of her voice to one side or listening in shock while she ridiculed the choices the other girls where making, gave them condescending speeches about how much they were ordering, and chided them for not refilling their own water glasses.   \n\nTo us, she was thankfully just inexplicably tongue tied--stuttering out responses and needing to be told twice that we were not interested in dessert. /awkward turtle! \n\nOkay, the food...\n\n...is actually pretty decent, but ultimately not something you have to have. It's generic Italian cafe fair that you can get at any neapolitan pizza joint. These are increasingly dime-a-dozen affairs. \n\nAnd this is NOT must have pizza.\n\nWe ordered the soft polenta--which was well executed--and the amatriciana pizza. I love the idea of turning a classic sauce into a pizza, but this one lacked all of the sumptuousness you'd expect in amatriciana. The pancetta they used looked and tasted like classic American bacon to me--though that's obviously a semantic point. And amatriciana's not usually made with pancetta anyway.\n\nFor options in the area consider: Uva--for equally apt Italian and a better wine selection--or Nopalito--for awesome organic Mexican...with totopos (nachos) and grass fed beef empanadas that you really should try.

When we opened the box, I was surprised to see an egg on the top! Anyways, they had cut the pizza into these squarish pieces, which I thought was cool.\n\nThe pizza....was unbelievably amazing. OMG. So so so delicious. Some kind of herb they used that I am attracted to...mixed in with a little bit of spicy kick from the peppers, and the pieces with the egg were just fantastic. Thin crust pizza so you don't even feel bad eating a lot of it! I don't even think there was that much cheese on it and I still loved it! I was so full already because I had eaten dinner with my roommates at another restaurant, but I couldn't resist stuffing my face with approximately half of that pizza. I am a fatty.\n\nRandom fact: They have cool giant fork and spoon art installations on the walls. I like the giant fork.", "author": "Melody L."}

No matter which pizza you get, get an egg on it. If you get the Amatriciana, which comes with egg, order another egg. Dip into the gooey goodness, and then fight with your fellow diners as to who gets that last, sopping wet piece in the middle with the remains of the egg left on it.\n\n2. Stellar wines. Most of it is in Italian, and I don't know my Italian wine regions, but with organized headers like \"Big, Bold Reds\" who can go wrong? The wines are always good.\n\nSide note: I once sat next  to a table of chicks that ordered their white wine with glasses of ice, and then praised their waitress for not chastizing them for ordering their wines with glasses of ice.\n\n3. Butternut squash rigatoni. My heart was almost broken tonight when I came in and they no longer had it on the menu, but I suppose they have their reasons. Maybe butternut squash is out of season? Maybe they continually make it and then eat it all themselves before their patrons come in for dinner? (It is that good). Whatever their reasons I know it will be back someday. Just like Rose to Jack, I won't let go. It will be back  (I hope!)\n\n4. Their salads. And simple decor. And chill waitstaff. And dessert (that you never need).

My first time was so good, I think I might be kale whipped.  \n\nYou might be wondering, \"How did this happen?\"  Well, after a happy hour get together with friends I hadn't seen in months, we were drawn to this restaurant because we were starving.  We had oysters and wine, but who gets full off of that?  We searched high and low for something with big portions, but calorie deprivation quickly drained all energy and we finally stopped in front of this restaurant.\n\nThe line was long, too long.  It was obviously very popular and the night was getting chilly.  We were told the wait would be 45 minutes.  We thought to move on, but quickly turned back around when we realized we were so hungry that we were unable to walk any further.\n\nWe sat outside on the bench and read the menu in the cold while we waited for a table for four to open up.  Their menu seemed really good and I was of course browsing yelp reviews to see what people suggested.  We had made up our minds by the time we were sat.\n\nThe restaurant is definitely cozy, but it's also really busy - indication that there is good fare to be had.  We had the kale salad and a beet salad.  I definitely liked kale salad more, but I love my beets.  Very funny with my friend smearing the goat cheese everywhere to my lactose intolerant friend's dismay!  We also had two pizzas, one with the egg and one with the potatoes.  We also had our waiter select a bottle to be shared - a perfect wine for the perfect price.\n\nEverything was incredibly delicious and it ended up being the perfect place for the four of us to get together.  The one drawback to this restaurant is actually the parking situation in this area is atrocious.  If parking weren't so difficult, I would be here frequently.  So if you live in the area or can walk, I would definitely suggest giving this place a go.", "author": "Wilson K."}

It's understandable considering how small the place is and how popular it is. (esp. on weekends!) The service was superb though. Once we made it inside the lady at the front cheered for us (because we actually waited that long and because we finally made it out of the cold haha). \n\nBut I have never been more proud of a decision than this. We ordered bread with oil and vinegar as an app and then ordered wild nettle pizza with pancetta. So delicious. The flavor combination was awesome and the pizza was actually quite big. Therefore, the price we paid for this meal did not feel bad at all. I just wish it wasn't so crowded so I could come here more often (...or like, every day).

It tasted like a $10 bottle that they charged $40 for, which is something that really annoys me.  You expect markup at restaurants, but to have it be so blatant just made me feel like they thought (correctly) that they could get away with it.\n\nThe pizza was good, notable mostly for being paper thin.  Like there was no structural stability at all to it, which I suppose is novel, but novelty for novelty's sake doesn't really mean much besides calling attention to when it really doesn't work.  We had the margherita, which was basically a mouthful of basil so if you hate basil stay away, and the Bianca, which was a interesting mix of onion crema and lemon and other stuff.  It really was a unique blend of flavors that really worked well together.  We also had the Moto which tasted like any other not-terrible sausage pizza.  Except, y'know, thin.\n\nBut at the end, I came away thinking that I paid mostly for air and a really packed restaurant that may make claustrophobes slightly uncomfortable.  I guess if you really hate carbs because you're one of those types that can't seem to balance diet and exercise, then yeah I guess you'll get less carbs.  I'd stick with the more interesting items on the menu, since the \"normal\" ones don't seem to offer anything that elevates it to a memorable status.   \n\nRecommended:\nMargherita\nBianca", "author": "Norman S."}

Their pizza crust is chewy and perfectly fired w/out being burnt to a crisp, like many wood-fired pizzas fall prey to. The sauce is tart, but still sweet and the selection of different pizzas vast enough to please all the different palates. I've had their margherita, wild nettles (w/ portobello mushroom,  Boccalone pancetta, red onion & aged provolone) and their brussel sprouts pie (w/ applewood smoked bacon, thyme, red onion & smoked mozzarella). I've been happy with all of them and have actually craved their pizza many-a-time. Just writing this review is making me salivate!\n\nTheir arugula salad (w/ beets, fennel, Cypress Grove goat cheese & pistachios) is fresh, baked rigatoni (w/ butternut squash, brown butter, sage & fontina) yummy and their Lemon Verbena Panna Cotta (w/ blackberries) dessert right on point. All of these were delicious and I love how their Panna Cotta makes for a nice, light finish to the dinner. Ah and to top it off, their Nero d' Avola red wine is fruit forward & generally very likable (ordered a bottle on one occasion, and glasses another time).\n\nThe space is tight, but if you call ahead and put your name down on their waitlist (they don't take reservations), chances are you won't be in for an excruciatingly long wait. I love their simple cozy space w/ its classy, Italian decorations (even the bathroom) & their holiday trimmings (they had mistletoe up!!), and most of all, I appreciate their ceiling's sound tiles that absorb much of the potential noisiness one would typically get an earful of. I agree w/ some of the reviewers- the wait staff is pretty stand-offish & could be a little friendlier, but the hostess has been a total sweetheart & super accommodating.\n\nLove this solid spot and I'm looking forward to coming back again and again.", "author": "Tiffany M."}

You will have a tough time finding a better selection of delicious thin crust pizzas in SF than at Ragazza. The crust is thin, crisp and a perfect platform for the toppings. It's all about the ingredients here, not a thick bready pie. \n\nOur table of four shared everything. The salumi plate had two of my favorites, speck and lardo. The Fried Arancini was good but I expected more kick from the \"angry\" tomato sauce. The Pork Belly pizza was delicious, as was the Potato with Smoked Bacon (I did not eat healthy that night). The menu only had three pasta items on it that night and they were out of one, which shows you that they really focus on making a good pizza, so if you are looking for pasta I would probably try somewhere else.\n\nThey don't take reservations but they held a table for 5 minutes for us when we called on our way over.

The restaurant is pretty small but they have a heated gazebo in the back that seats 18-20 people which is where we had our dinner.  I felt like we had a rocky start with dinner.  We all arrived a little after 5 and nothing was set up.  It took a while for them to get us seated, offer wine and start with appetizers.  After that though, things went incredibly smoothly and I regretted my earlier complaints.  Our server was amazing and the food was so delicious!  \n\nWe started out with some warmed olives and Fried Arancini w/ sundried tomato pesto.  The Arancini were delicious and I kept going back for more of the tomato pesto.  The second course included a Kale salad with little Gem Lettuces, farro, avocado, kumquats, watermelon radish & green goddess dressing as well as a cheese plate with and Pulled Mozzarella& Roasted Asparagus with smoked prosciutto & crackerbread.  My only complaint about the salad was that they didn't cut out the really hard centers of the kale leaves.  Other than that, the flavor was great, I loved the addition of the farro and the kumquats added a nice citrusy sweetness.  The Mozzarella was delicious and I loved the crunchy asparagus texture and the salty prosciutto.  After this course I was starting to feel a bit full, and we still had the pizza course!  \n\nWe started out with a Sausage pizza that was delicious.  The pizza crust was thin and the outside crust was just thick enough.  The pizza's just kept coming then and we also got a Bianca and a pizza topped with fava greens.  The Bianca pizza was equally as delicous as the sausage but very different.  It was topped with onion crema, shaved garlic, preserved lemon, aged provolone & wild arugula.  I loved the addition of the preserved lemon to the pizza as well as the fresh arugula topping.  Both made the rich pizza feel a little lighter and healthier.  The Fava green pizza was probably my least favorite.  I felt that the greens were a bit too bitter and that the flavor wasn't quite there.  I was officially very full after the pizza course and we still had dessert.  Luckily the desserts were shared among groups of five.  We had Tiramisu and an Olive Oil Cake topped with whipped cream and blood oranges.  Both were tasty but I think I preferred the Olive Oil Cake.  \n\nI also really loved the wine that was served at dinner.  I wasn't sure about the red wine at first glance because it came in an oddly shaped liter bottle.  The flavor however was great.  The wine was rustic and tanniny with a smooth finish.  It was an Italian blend of Grenache and Mouvedre and I'm already trying to figure out where I can find it in Portland.", "author": "Katherine C."}

I've been to Gialina, and for some reason, Ragazza is way more amazing.  I don't know why - maybe I'm a sucker for the slightly sleeker decor of Ragazza versus the more homey atmosphere at Gialina.\n\nRegardless, the food we ate there was top notch.  We ordered two small salads (arugula and farro) to share at the table, which were refreshing with delicate greens and subtle flavors, as salads should be.  The goat cheese that came with both salads was smooth and mild.  Even the goat cheese hater at the table liked it.\n\nThe pizzas are quite large, maybe a little larger than your typical Neapolitan style pizza.  But don't be fooled.  They get the crust so amazingly thin on the bottom that you can easily scarf down 3/4 to a full pie.  We had the spigarello, amatriciana, and margherita.  My personal favorite was the spigarello, which is a type of mild mustard green.  Besides the greens, the pie came topped with an herby, flavorful sausage.  The cheese is supposedly provolone; it is the best darn provolone I have ever had.  Far richer and closer to fontina than anything I've ever put on a Subway sandwich.  All the pies were fantastic though.  I like to judge my pies based on the margherita, but I think the amatriciana better reflects what they do with simple flavors, and if you had to pick between those two, I'd go amatriciana.

One of the times neither tables were told to share the one portion of appetizers and so as one table finished it the other understandably asked for their appetizer too...we were then charged for the added portion to accommodate our table...not that spending 75 a person wasn't good enough. We asked if that could be removed from the bill as a courtesy as we really weren't aware that that one small portion on the separate table was supposed to be shared by both tables and upon asking the manager noted 'are you upset that we didn't store your ice cream cake?' Earlier that night, we asked if we could have them keep the ice cream cake and the manager noted that they don't have a freezer...we went all the way home and dropped it off and then went back after dinner to bring it for our friend. There was no harm done if they don't have a freezer and we all had forgotten except for the manager who very passive aggressively told my boyfriend that he must just be upset about the cake.\n\nAll in all the worst dining experience the entire group had in San Francisco in terms of service.", "author": "R B."}

An hour later, we came back and sat outside watching her seat everyone except us. I had seen the wait list above us and she clearly was not following it and was not managing the tables well. I made a subtle chill comment about it to her and she came unleashed! She was incredibly rude, condescending and I was so embarrassed that someone in hospitality would talk to a customer that way, especially in front of my out of town guests. \n\nAn hour and a half wait is not worth it. The food is good but to be yelled at by a hostess is ridiculous. If you can't handle the stress or talk to a customer with respect, hospitality is not the job for you, blond hostess girl! And a note to the owners: choose your hostess well, it's the first impression people have of your restaurant and this gal isn't giving San Francisco a good one!\n\nGo to Gialina in Glen Park, the sister restaurant instead. The menu is almost exactly the same but they have a welcome neighborhoody attitude and the wait isn't as insane. Or better yet check out Pizza Nostra in lower Potrero Hill, rarely a wait and they are actually happy to have you, you'll even meet the owner or her husband.", "author": "Sarah R."}

While I thought the pies were delicious, the service was not up to par.  The hostesses demeanor was off-putting as she told me I needed to wait outside for my friend before I could be seated.  While it's understandable in most cases, especially if it's packed, the place was not even half full.  To make matters worse, the restaurant was bustling by the time we were about to leave, yet, a patron was seated as she waited for her party to arrive.  Regardless, it was more the hostesses attitude than anything else.  This is something that I know would not happen at Gialina.  While a bit chilly, I was grateful that it wasn't raining, otherwise, I would've hightailed it back up Divisadero to Little Star.\n\nIt's very reminiscent of my experience at Pizzaiolo in Oakland, where good service is the missing element to what could be a great restaurant.

I like the food at Tony's Pizza Napoletana but the scene is a bit too Mulberry Street (not a good thing these days) for my taste. A16 is very good but a bit too fancy and heavily oiled / salted for my taste. Delfina is terrific, no doubt. I dig the scene and the Chicago style pie at Little Star up the street from Ragazza but it's a totally different beast. There are probably 15 - 20 other places I've tried, many of which are good but none really stand out.\n\nWent to Ragazza last night and was blown away by the pizza. We sat at the bar in the back, which was a good decision because we got to watch the guys and gals in action. It was a thing of beauty, other than the ridiculous huge red Ragazza patches they have on their chef coats.\n\nThe pizza was the best I've had in SF, definitely rivaling some of my NYC favs: Lombardi's, John's, Grimaldi's and even Roberta's. Very thin and crispy crust, beautifully adorned with, in the case of the Moto, a well balanced red sauce, coarsely chopped mushrooms, some chilies, just the right amount of cheese and a 15 - 20 morsels of sausage that were hot enough to announce their presence but not overpowering.   \n\nThe little gem salad with kumquats was OK - a bit overdressed and undersalted. We usually skip getting new plates between courses but actually asked for one this time b/c of all the salad sauce (seems like a better choice of words than dressing given the viscosity and volume) remaining on the plate.\n\nThe cannoli was also just OK, despite the promising description from one of the gracious servers (from the Bronx, woot). The shell was a bit lighter than the ones I'm used to from Ferrara's but the mascarpone-based filling, while light, lacked a bit of flavor IMHO. I'm not an expert on these, though, so Ragazza's might have been the real deal.\n\nWill be back and try a few more dishes.

I seriously could eat pizza every.single.day. \n\nI was a little hesitant to try Ragazza after a less then spectacular experience at Gialina's (the sister restaurant in Glen Park), but after deciding enough time had passed, and heard great things about Ragazza, we decided to give it a go. \n\nWe went on a Wednesday night, called ahead to put our name on the list (since they don't take reservations) and wandered down to the cute new cafe/wine/beer place on the corner of Divis/Oak (which replaced the cafe that replaced the little liquor store where I used to buy alcohol underage with my awesome fake ID). \n\nSo, after a small confusion with the hostess (she wrote down we were a party of 2, there were 4 of us), we were seated at our table and prepared for our pizza journey. Two of my dining companions had been to Ragazza before, so I just followed their lead - except I was insistent that we order the Heirloom Tomato Pizza (seriously, do it before it disappears from the menu). \n\nOur server was amazing and attentive. She knew her stuff and kept making sure we were still doing alright. \n\nThe pizzas were great! My only complaint was that the bottle of wine ran out too quickly!

Great flavor and generous hunks of goat cheese. It did however, need more peaches! \n\nPizzas! \nMoto- tomato, Calabrian chilies, portobello mushrooms, red onion, sausage & mozzarella $16 \n*****Thoughts - This pizza was good. Not my favorite, but had good flavor. \n\nAmatriciana w/ tomato, Boccalone pancetta, chilies, pecorino, oregano & an egg $16 \n*****Thoughts - ORDER THIS NOW. Thank me later. My favorite pizza of the night! Such a great combination of flavors and the egg puts it over the top. \n\nMariquita Heirloom Tomatoes w/ applewood smoked bacon, mozzarella, basil & wild arugula $19 \n****Thoughts - My second favorite of the night.

HEAVEN! \n\nEscarole w/ caramelized onion, Nostrano salume & Val d'Aosta fontina $17 \n***Thoughts - I don't know if I would order this again. It was good, but needed a bit more salt/seasoning.

I have no idea what the wait or crowd is like later in the evening. \n\nOverall, the food was delicious.  Everything was seasoned really well. We started with the salume plate, breadcrumbed sardines, and pork belly with figs.  We thought some of the salads were priced really high, but we got some arugula and other greens with our antipasti (the large salad the other table ordered was huge, served in a big salad bowl). I'd skip the salume plate since the amount of actual cured meats was minimal (check out Una Evoteca's selection of carne a few blocks away instead). \n\nI loved the potato and bacon pizza (don't forget to add egg on yo pie!) cuz really what's not to like about those toppings? Taleggio cheese gives it a good salty kick so no Parmesan necessary. I love all types of eggs and egg yolk as a pizza dip is no exception. I thought the crust was just a tad dry, but there were no burnt/black areas except for the big bubbles on top which I love. The next time I'll probably just focus on the pizzas and skip the starters. They usually only feature one pasta dish. Ragazza will probably be a take out pizza spot for me on fancy dinner night.\n\nNote: no gluten-free pizza or pasta options", "author": "Mimi L."}

But Ragazza's restroom was just the most awesome bathroom space - it was small, but decorated with these great vintage picture frames that I totally wanted to steal. \n\nMoving on.\n\nWe got an early dinner before going to see The Flaming Lips over in Oakland, and boy, was I glad we had an excuse to go early. At 5:45pm we got seated immediately. By 6:15pm there was a 45 min wait for 2 people. Luckily, they take phone numbers (and the Page is right across the street!). Worth the wait, I say.\n\nFood: \n- The beet & arugula salad (with goat cheese) was light and delicious.\n- The wild nettle pizza had a golden crust and I loved that the nettles weren't wilted, but crispy. \n- The crust on the margherita was thinner than the wild nettle pizza -- I later found out that it's the same crust, but the pizza crust comes out differently with different cheeses and toppings!\n\nThe ONLY issue was that they brought out the wild nettle pizza first.... and didn't bring out the margherita until we were done. I like to sample one slice and then another, instead of eating 4 slices of one pizza and then moving on to the next. It didn't ruin the meal though.\n\nWine:\nNow, let me address this wine situation. Yes, the by-the-glass is pricey ($7-10), but we got a bottle for $22. You can get 3/4ths of a bottle (500ml) for $18! I think that's totally worth while. If you are worried about getting a small pour, pop for an extra $9 and guarantee that you'll have enough wine to guzzle throughout dinner.\n\nDessert:\nRicotta cheesecake was unnecessary (I was so full!) but I had to try it. Mmmmmm. The portion wasn't too big, but it was definitely sweet.\n\nOverall, the service here was great (we overheard servers having to deal with customers being grumpy about waiting...and they were very nice about it).

After being seated for about half an hour, still no sign of the wines we ordered. After nicely reminding the hostess, I was given an annoyed look followed by: as you can see we are very busy and you guys were the last to be seated. (seriously, in those words) I was a little taken back by the response and proceeded to explain that I was just checking that they transferred our drink order from the backyard. Guess I wasn't allowed to question that because, yes, it was all done...or so we were told. Another 15 minutes goes by and still no sign of our drinks. We brought it up to our waitress (who was nice), and she explained that she never received our order. \n\nWe ended up waiting another half an hour for our pizza. The whole dinner took 2 hours, and actual eating time was about 20 minutes.

The bean salad was wonderful, surprising, not too vinegary at all, bright flavors, pretty, good bite.\n\nThe pizzas weren't perfect.  The crust was just a bit too thick, so it felt too chewy in places.  The dough itself is fantastic - it has that shininess that I associate with a starter-leavened dough.  I suspect those last 2 points are related.  It was a little undercooked, not colored all the way to the edge, and it seemed as though it might have sat for a few minutes before arriving at our table - there was some condensation at the bottom.  One of the yolks had broken on the farm egg pizza, and who wants scrambled eggs on pizza?  The other egg, to be fair, was cooked perfectly for my taste.  \n\nThe nettle pizza is terrific, though with preserved lemon in the ingredient list, I expected a little more of that fragrant lemon complexity.  \n\nThe desserts were good, maybe too big.  The ricotta cheesecake  was sweet for my taste but wonderfully rich.

We just went out to Ragazza, a new pizzeria between Oak and Page on Divis. -- it was a delight. Located where the old Metro Hotel french bistro used to be, Ragazza offers a good size menu complete with wonderful appetizers, salads, as well as some great \"pies\". \n\nThe pizzas are thin crust with generous topping that can please both the vegetarian and the bacon-a-vor alike.\n\nRagazza is on par with the other high end pizza destinations in the city. Perhaps it's just nostalgia for the lower Haight, but Ragazza seems to have a genuine homey feel. Although it does not have the fine finish of Delfina or Flour+Water, the food is just as good.", "author": "Philip C."}

I'm so happy to report that it was the best foodie discovery I've had in a while.  \n\nOrdered:\n\n- Antipasto Plate with Umbrian lentils, olives, mortadella, speck, and salume nostrano - $14\n- Farro Salad with cherry tomatoes, Frog Hollow peaches, sweet white corn & ricotta salata - $9\n- Potato with applewood smoked bacon, red onion, rosemary & goat cheese - $14\n- Add Rancho Elias Egg to pizza pie - $2\n- Add Sausage to pizza pie - $3\n- Tiramisu - $8\n\nThe restaurant was extremely busy, but the staff was very attentive.  We sat at the bar and we were able to take a look at all the food coming in and out of the kitchen (all of which looked SO good!)  The food may take a bit to come out, but it is well worth the wait!  I can't get over the combination of ingredients on our pizza.  I love potato on my pizza (it's a popular trend in Japan) but Ragazza slices the potato very thin so it blends nicely with the rest of the toppings.  If you've never tried egg [fried/not hard-boiled ;)] with your pizza, you should definitely give it a go. It was my first time and I would do it over again in a heartbeat. Our other dishes were just as yummy and complemented the main dish well.\n\nThere are so many places in the city that I'm dying to try, but I will make the effort to stop by once in awhile to get my Ragazza fix! \n\nMLOU'S TIPS\n------------------\n\n1) GET THE EGG ON YOUR PIZZA!\n\n2) Take a peek at the garden in the back of the restaurant-- very pretty!", "author": "Marilou A."}

Nevertheless, service always seems a bit disheveled, some employees can seem a bit overwhelmed, and can sometimes be a bit cold and drafty inside.  I like the place, its convenient and good pizza.

And lastly, the pizza was perfect as has always been the case.  \n\nI'm not asking for much in terms of service when going to a restaurant such as Ragazza, just not interested in being subjected to the problems of an unhappy staff member who cannot handle the pressure of working in a restaurant.

We were so excited to try Ragazza because we have been wanting a good thin crust pizza place in the neighborhood for a long time. We love food!! We love food so much that when we travel together all we do is eat.  For us to get the true experience of a restaurant, we usually share everything. Four of us shared the fallowing.. \n\n1. Little Gem Lettuces, green goddess dressing, farro & local apples $18\nWe had the large salad and we thought it was delicious but we also felt like it was a bit expensive. We never complain about prices but we also want to get our money's worth.  \n\n2. Pork Belly over a fresh corn salad. \nWe really loved the flavors of this dish but what we got was not pork belly. It was actually a piece of meat and this was not what we were expecting. It was a bit dry too. \n\n3. Braised Short Rib Sugo w/ strozzapreti & Parmigiano Reggiano $14\nThis was delicious! In fact we ended up ordering another one. We would return just for this dish. \n\n4. Pork Osso Bucco w/ preserved Meyer lemon & Cavolo Nero soft polenta $21\nI think we all agreed that this dish was good but not great. It lacked a depth of flavor that I normally get from Osso Bucco when I make it or have had it at other restaurants. With a few tweaks this can become a great dish. \n\n5. Amatriciana pizza w/ tomato, pancetta, chilies, Pecorino, oregano \n& an egg $16\nWe loved this pizza! It was so flavorful that we wished we had ordered \nmore pizzas instead of some of the dished we had.\n\n6. Ricotta Cheesecake with Figs. \nI wouldn't say its the best cheesecake we've ever had but it was a nice end to our meal. The cake was light and airy but a bit grainy. I think we just prefer the texture of a mascarpone cheesecake over one that is made with ricotta. \n\n7. It was a warm evening so the server suggested a ros\u00e9 wine that went great with our meal. We had 2 bottles.... :-)\n\nThere was some misses but there was also some great dishes. We would return just for the pasta dish and to try more of the pizzas. The combinations sound delicious and hopefully they are as good as the one we ordered. We love Delfina Pizzeria and Flour+Water but we also loved Ragazza's pizza. I love each restaurant for a different reason. I think we all agreed that we enjoyed the bold flavor of Ragazza's pizza.", "author": "Rolo A."}

We put down our number and went over to The Page to grab a drink while we waited. I must say, I give props to the staff for dealing with some very push and pompous customers. There was clearly a queue where everyone had to wait. There were a number of women who thought they were better than others and felt they should not have to wait. Some tried to force themselves to the bar area (which is NOT first come first serve) and the hostess had to escort them out. They had the audacity to say \"I don't get why that's a problem if we sat at the bar?\" Even though the hostess said to them that the seats are also for those in the waitlist. They left storming out and pissed. Good riddance.\n\nAfter we were seated, we were greeted with menus and water. I love that restaurants now give bottles of water to tables so that they're not always refilling cups. Just makes it easier for them and easier for us too so that we don't have to keep flagging someone down. My roommate and I got the tossed salad (lettuce, goat cheese, beets, and pine nuts) and Amatriciana with an extra egg. The salad was really good. I'm usually not a fan of goat cheese but I loved it this time. When ordering the amatriciana, get extra eggs! If you think the egg is amazing idea then please get at least two. The egg makes it so much more creamy and a bit more protein as well. Before biting into it, spread the yoke across the pizza so that every piece gets a bit of it. The pizza as really good and the crust was nice. Towards the edges it was a bit thick but that's ok since I could easily use that to mop up whatever yolk was on my plate.\n\nThe only thing I wasn't a fan of that after we ate our salad, we didn't get new plates to eat our pizza. I might be a tad bit anal about this part but I just don't like mixing flavors and the pizza did not go with the dressing of the salad. Overall, this is a great establishment.

I predict success -- good for the owners, good for the neighborhood.\n\nFor antipasti we ordered the oven roasted sardines and the mozzarella/prosciutto/tomato-corn salad.  Both were perfectly executed and beautifully presented.\n\nWe ordered a red wine from the upper half of the price range (Avignonesi, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, Toscana 2007 ....$49), because my handy Droid cheat sheet told me 2007 was an outstanding year in region, and I was with one of my more free-spending friends.  Bullseye!  I'd go lower end if I was ordering pizza and salad, but we had the braised short rib pasta, and this was a lovely match.\n\nOur meal was rounded out by a vegetable dish -- braised chard with garlic and bacon.  Also perfect. \n\nThe only reason I haven't given five stars is that one of the servers was simply unprofessional.  We interacted with four staffers in total, and three made good impressions.  But one of them brought out one of our dishes and, seeing that some other plates would have to be moved before she could set it down, held it over our table without saying a word.  Of course we cleared space for her, but she should have either a) cleared the space herself (best option) or b) asked us to make room. She looked like a sourpuss, too -- maybe a bad night for her, or maybe she's got one of those personalities unsuited to a service occupation.\n\nOverall, an excellent dinner.", "author": "Francisco G."}

About 25% of the crust around the pizza was burned (burnt?). I like crust. I'm here to eat the whole pizza. \n\nThe margherita had so little cheese that 2 of the pieces (out of 8) had no cheese at all. Zero. I looked. They clearly don't shred the mozzarella and spread it around. They put down a few mozzarella balls and they spread out as they melt but clearly not enough to cover all the pieces.  Seriously guys, take the \"sophistication\" down a notch and just grate the cheese. I'm from Wisconsin.  I order pizza so that I can eat cheese.\n\nSo one pie with too little cheese. Two pies where I couldn't eat a big percentage of the crust.

The hostess was incredibly accomodating with our group, not just pleasant but genuinely nice. \n\nBoth the appetizers we tried (lamb meatballs, hand pulled mozzarella salad) were delicious, and the tender fococcia was a steal at $1.  We shared three of the pizzas: The Moto was spicier than expected and while good, paled in comparison to the other two pizzas we ordered.  The Bianca was fantastic, I loved the addition of preserved lemon and the freshness of the arugula.  Our last selection was the Hen of the Woods mushroom pizza, which came loaded with fontina.    Heavier than the Bianca, it was earthy and cheesy and wonderful.\n\nWe tried two pastas as well, one with lamb sugo and another with butternut squash.  The former was good, but a little too traditional for me to get excited about.  However, I kept going back to the butternnut squash for the crispy sage and amaretti cookies.\n\nTogether with two bottles of wine, our party of six ended up paying about $60 a person.  A little pricey, but well worth it for an evening of exceptional food and service.", "author": "Shayna F."}

The restaurant occupies the spot that previously housed \"Metro Kathmandu\" (and a number of other failed restaurants) -- hopefully, Ragazza will have better fortune.\n\nThe place is small, and they dont take reservations, so the only option is to add your name to their waitlist & then go for a drink in the fairly dive-y \"Page\" bar across the street. For us, on a Saturday night, the wait was about an hour - then, I got a friendly call on my cell phone to tell me the table was ready.\n\nThe place was bustling on a Saturday evening, but in a casual, fairly laid-back way. It seems a lot like the sister restaurant, Gialina, in Glen Park -- similar space, similar artwork on the wall, and a similar menu (though seeming not as centered on pizza.)\n\nWe started with an Arugula Salad (excellent - zesty, with tangerines and goat cheese) and a carafe of Chianti. (I love the carafe notion -- not too much, not too little -- and something you see too rarely). We followed with a couple of entrees -- bigger than I expected -- the Amatriciana pizza (with a signature friend egg in the middle - for \"dipping\", our waitress helpfully explained) -- and the Roast Chicken (\"diavola-style\" -- meaning, we discovered, very hot & spicy on the outside.) The pizza was excellent, another staple from Gialina's - very thin crust, but big and satisfying. And the chicken was mouthwatering - juicy and tasty, complemented with polenta and baby broccolis -- definitely one to return for.\n\nAll-in-all, a great meal in a friendly, casual environment -- a good alternative to the more high-end, nearby Nopa -- I'll be back...!", "author": "donal c."}

It feels like a local gem, with great atmosphere and a casual but warm-seeming crowd. The service is attentive and very personable.\n\nThat said, those qualities are enough for me to overlook some not-as-stellar things. I didn't like the flavor combination of the fried padron peppers and goat cheese. The goat cheese overpowered the peppers, which were slick with oil but yet not cooked through enough. There weren't any real overarching element to bring the two ingredients together either, like a sauce or herb. \n\nI also tried the chanterelle pizza, and though the crust was one of the more amazing ones I've had in SF (perfect chew, yum yum), the chanterelles (and whatever other ingredients were on that pizza) were lost among a mass of very oily onions. \n\nThe wine is very reasonably priced here....you can get bottles for $30.\n\nSo if Ragazza, you can dial back the oil, and let your super fresh ingredients shine through more on their own, this would definitely be five stars in my book.", "author": "Carolyn F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-26", "description": "3.5 stars.  Good pies, but not mindblowing.  To avoid a wait and negate massive calories, we employed the same strategy we previously deployed for Gialina: pick a random Tuesday, eat nothing all day, work out, ignore hunger pangs, head to Ragazza at 9:40pm and channel last bit of remaining energy to supress irritability from low blood sugar.  Ok, so we had to embrace a couple eating disorders for *one day* but hey, we sat down immediately and justified our caloric binge.  (Note: the place was packed at 9:40pm).\n\nAmbiance is ok, mostly 2 tops, dark tables. Not too loud, dim lighting.\n\nWe shared:\n-Baked *SQUASH* appetizer. Oh, the first bite of food all day! This was delicious, a bit sweet, baked, served with some figs, ricotta, and sprinkled with some nuts which gave it a great crunch.  Great contrast of textures.\n-*MUSHROOM PIE* (no tomato sauce). Favorite item I ate here. Savory, earthy.  Highly recommend if you like mushrooms.\n-*AMATRACIANA* w/ tomato, pancetta, chilies + an egg.  One word: salty!  I'm pretty sure this pie caused me to bloat up to Violet proportions in charlie and the chocolate factory. Each bite seemed increasingly salty yet addictive. Friend agreed - bloatworthy.  Good thing the mushroom pizza was \"normal\" salty to balance things out.\n\nCrust: Just ok.  It was kinda too much, too thick, too poofy for the pizza. Tasted a bit bland. (Maybe the salt killed my taste buds).\n\nDessert: *OLIVE OIL CAKE* w/creme fraiche.  Mild, neutral flavor.  Creme fraiche was almost frozen, not sure if intended or not.  Came sprinkled with about 7 raspberries, which were teeny tiny, seemed out of season.  I still haven't formed my final opinion on this mild, yet dense dessert.\n\nOverall, pretty good pies, reasonably priced, but I'd probably only go back if there were no wait.", "author": "Caroline I."}

The food speaks for itself, and even though I am a devoted Gialina lover, Ragazza offers a larger menu and it has an amazing gazebo that is good for group dining.  I LOVE eating outside and their gazebo feels like you are transported to a secret garden somewhere in the Italian mountains.  Large group dining is a pain in the butt in SF (except if you want to spend insane $$$) and Ragazza has rescued me twice in this department (see their web-site for reservations for the gazebo).

I have sought out some delicious west coast pizzas at Pizzaiolo in Oakland, Pizetta 211 in the Inner Richmond.  There are some great Italian style pizzas out there to be had.  But the pizza at Ragazza was a monstrosity.  My Italian came out and I could only think of what a monstrosity the crust was.  In Italy, the secret to ones pizza is the dough recipe... you couldn't call this dough.  It was like a cracker, burnt to a crisp.  \n\ni am a firm believer that dough should have some softness to it, so that it can absorb and carry the flavor of the toppings.  This dough you could pick up in the middle, like a cracker, and overpowered all of the ingredients with a burnt smell.\n\nThe arugula salad was small and uninteresting\n\nThe service was quick and attentive, I will give them that.

That said, it went like this:\n\nWe walked in and the place was very pleasing to the eyes and nose, almost like I'd been here before.  Sitting down and looking at the menu, I realize I had: the layout, menu, even the black and white photos on the wall were pretty much a carbon copy of Gialina in Glenn Park.  \"Same owners?,\" we wondered.\n\nWe ordered the warm olives and blood orange salad for appetizers.  They looked wonderful, but were a little off.  The greens in the salad were....a little too tough, frankly.  It was the difference between greens that are appropriate for a salad and those that were straight off of a lawn after a day of gardening.  It was like Gialina, but not.  A little off.\n\nNext, the pizzas arrived.  They are large and wonderful to look at, but I think they were just ok.  I got the Rabini/Potato/Leek/Sausage pizza, and my wife the Bacon/Brussels Sprouts pizza.  My potatoes were literally tasteless, and overall I did not think the flavors meshed well together.  Likewise, the textures were a little too tough, the portions of the toppings a little too large.  It was kind of like a Gialina pizza (or Peccino, or or or), but a little off.  Neither of us really enjoyed our pies.\n\nWith a single glass of wine, our bill totaled about $60 without tip.  The pies are definitely large enough for two people to share.\n\nThe place was rockin', so again, I imagine we just had a strange combo of things we ordered.", "author": "Rob P."}

But, the food is fantastic!\n\nThe braised greens with bacon, goat cheese and breadcrumbs are absolutely fabulous!! Its a very flavorful dish and great for sharing. But the pork belly is my favorite dish!! The figs and pistachios make it pure heaven. The braised short ribs leave a bit to be desired. The dish tastes great, but is very heavy on pasta and light on meat. When I ordered it, I wasn't expecting a bowl of pasta, I thought it would be meat with some pasta. The Moto pizza has a ton of flavor and a little kick of spice which is great!! The sausage pizza is also delish. For dessert they have two daily selections of bi-rite ice cream... you can't go wrong with that! But the ricotta cheesecake is something you should not miss. The wine selection is good and reasonably priced. Our server seemed knowledgeable about the selection and directed us to a wine that we loved. If you don't want to eat a ton of pasta and pizza, there are a few selections on the Antipasti menu that should keep you satisfied, but Ragazza is definitely for the carb lovers.\n\nService was a little touch and go. At times our server was very attentive, and other times we didn't see her for a while. I'm not too crazy about the new decor in the space. It just doesn't have the warm feeling from the Metro days.

We got in within 10 minutes though, relatively early on a Saturday night. Our server seemed a bit impatient with our drink orders (we wanted to try a wine or two, and she seemed annoyed by this).  She also steered us away from even trying the prosecco, saying it was bad. Most of our food was great though, including braised brussell sprouts with pancetta, and two pies cooked perfectly and with the right proportion of toppings and seasoning. The \"pork cakes\" were simply strange--we were trying to be adventurous, but this dish fell flat--essentially cooked shredded pork covered in bread crumbs and fried, served with a celeriac puree and balsamic reduction. The pork was somewhat dry and the texture overall unusual. I'd definitely return for the pizza though.", "author": "Timothy V."}

Instead she was very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable about the menu, providing insight to their diverse wine list. The ambiance was modern yet cozy and after a delicious meal we were able to split the bill a few different ways no problem.

The arancini looked really good on the menu, but we heard our waitress tell another party that the pizza was larger than personal size, so we had to pass on the appetizers to try the pizza we had heard so much about. We had the Amatriciana and Potato pizzas, and both were delicious.  We loved the tomato sauce on the Amatriciana pizza, and all the toppings were good, especially the egg on top.  The potato pizza also had a great cheese and nice chunks of bacon on it, which we really enjoyed. What we appreciated most was the size of the pizzas, which were much larger than most of the other good pizza places in SF.  We took home four slices of pizza (each pizza had 6 slices), which we enjoyed re-heated the next day.  Service was good, and a lot of things on the menu looked very tempting.

What I can't live with is that they charged us a $3.00 \"service charge\" for absolutely no apparent reason.  Then when we asked the waitress about it she told us that it was a mandatory health insurance fee charge for San Francisco employees.  BULL$$$$.  So I looked into it, and it turns out this is a great little scam that a lot of high end San Francisco restaurants have begun profitting from.  Most of these restaurants never even use a penny of the money for health insurance for their employees.  They pocket the money.  This level of greed deserves nothing more than 1 star, even if the food is amazing.  Which it isn't.   Open your eyes fellow yelpers, and take a stand against greed.  Don't eat here until they take off that ridiculous charge of $1.00 per guest ObamaCare style fascist socialism fee, which takes advantage of the liberal left sympathies of San Franciscans for an extra thousands of dollars in profits per month.", "author": "dom j."}

The brussel sprout pizza was great, actually. They server was someone we knew from the neighborhood so perhaps that's why it went so well. So well, in fact that I decided to go again on Feb 25th for my birthday. Big mistake. \n\nThe menu had changed and everything we had enjoyed the last time was gone. That was not a big deal as we thought we could find something else that was good. My friend ordered the pork belly pizza. Epic fail. It arrived drowning in a pool of grease. I know that pork belly is fatty, but there was so much grease under this pizza that my friend literally poured it onto an appetizer plate to get rid of it. There must have been an 1/8 of an inch of grease. Not a few drips but a puddle that was able to be poured. Not really what she expected.\n\n Another guest ordered the lamb belly. Something was very wrong with the sauce it came in. Very wrong. This was not a situation where it was just not to his liking but one where someone in the kitchen either added something that had gone bad to the sauce or accidentally used an ingredient they should not have used. I dont know but we all tasted it and all agreed that it was not edible. He sent it back. Then my pizza arrived with the fried egg in the center that I had specifically said needed to be left off when I ordered it. When I said something, the server immediately recalled that yes I had said \"no egg\". Perhaps it was the kitchen or maybe it was the fact that the server wrote nothing down when we all ordered.  I dont know. I do know that at my birthday dinner I got to watch everyone else eat and then, after everyone else had finished, and they were outside enjoying their cigarettes, I was finally served my pizza 45 minutes after I should have gotten it. Thats right, I got my dinner a long time after the other people I was with had finished and were getting ready to leave.  It was a really really disappointing meal that we ended up paying hundreds of dollars for because there was 6 of us.  The people at the table were not exactly thrilled to throw down about $90 each for a meal where so many things were bad or had gone wrong. I dont know if it was just an off night or what the deal was but this was not good and they have lost me as a customer as well as all the people who were with me.", "author": "angela j."}

I've heard other people rave about the other pies, so I look forward to trying something different in the future.\n\nIn terms of service... the place was packed when we arrived around 8:30pm on a Tuesday night. There were only 2 servers/hosts on, which made the experience feel quite rushed. It's a pet peeve of mine to go to a restaurant where you're willing to spend a pretty penny (our bill was just over $100), feel rushed with each course being thrown down onto the table, and then struggle to even make eye contact with the server. We ordered a bottle of wine and about 5 dishes (pizza included), and were out in less than 45 minutes.

We shared a farro salad with arugula, radishes, and snap-peas, and all I can say is it was like Springtime in a bowl. The soft polenta appetizer was rich and creamy and topped with mascarpone cheese.

Last night, my friends & I attempted to eat at Ragazza.  My boyfriend & I have eaten there several times & wanted to introduce it to some friends.  I was with a party of six & we were told that the wait would be 50-75 minutes.  We left a name & number for her to call when our table was ready and then we went to get a drink.  After we finished our drinks, we returned to Ragazza.  The hostess told my friend she had called him repeatedly & had even left a message.  He verified that she had the correct number.  He did not have any missed calls or a message.  She then pointed out a table that was finishing up and told us she would seat us there.  We waited for the party to finish and the table to be set up for our group.  The hostess then proceeded to seat a different party of 6 at the table she had said was for my friends and me.  Two members of my party went inside to speak with the hostess & question her as to why she had seated a different party of six at the table she had said was for our group.  She never offered an apology or an explanation as to why she seated the other party or admitted any fault.  By that time, we had had enough of her attitude & took our business elsewhere.", "author": "Karen P."}

The nice hostess called my cell phone when the table was ready (15 minutes earlier than estimated)- so easy!  The wine list has some little gems and our server was really knowledgeable about the wine.  We settled on the Uva di Troja by Santa Lucia in Puglia which was great and  really well priced.  We moved on to Brussel Sprouts (with some salty pig fat) that were instantly devoured by my boyfriend before anyone else could even blink, and a beautiful, family style salad.  The pizzas were my favorite part.  The crust was thin and bubbly with a little char on the bottom.  They also offer the option of a sunny side up egg on top of the pizza to dip the crust in!

My friends and I devoured the heirloom tomato pizza with bacon (pushed into the crust!), a veritable garden of arugula, mozzarella, and bacon.  We were lucky to have it, at that, because heirloom season is almost over and these gorgeous tomatoes were at the peak of ripeness.  This wonderful course had been preceded by a tasty -- if too small -- antipasti of oven-roasted local sardines with Sicilian stuffing and breadcrumbs.  Dessert gave me a moment of pure bliss, an incredible instance of pairing perfection.  We ordered their olive oil cake with creme fraiche ice cream and figs.  Being out of figs, the dish was instead served with dates.  I ordered Vin Santo del Chianti Classico with this, and was floored by the perfect combination that turns out to be Vin Santo and figs.

We started with the delicata squash app with ricotta, herbs, crushed almonds and currants. The dish sounded fantastic but was really lacking seasoning and wasn't served warm enough; it almost had a sweet dessert quality because of the ricotta and almond, but it really needed some salt. The margherita was fantastic with a sweet sauce, some bits of fresh mozz and super thin crust with crispy bubbly ends with fresh basil. The quality was superb and I didn't think $12.50 was a bad pirce. We wanted to try the chanterelle mushroom pie but I didn't want to spend $18. Also, you can add an egg to your pizza, yum.Their wine list may be nice but I wish they had a glass that was less than $9. Our service was okay, we sat at the bar and a fellow bar patron held the waiters attention the entire time, we went 20 mins without water refills and felt waiting 45 mins for a pizza was a bit long.

I visited Ragazza a couple of weeks ago and ran into two of my friends outside, so I decided to join them at the bar, where there were two seats next to them.  My boyfriend was 10 minutes away on the bus, and the hostess refused to let me sit at the bar with my friends, even though I was going to eat dinner, because my boyfriend hadn't arrived yet.  I wanted to have a glass of wine with my friends and wait for my boyfriend before I ordered my food. The hostess shooed me away as if I were a nothing, and would not let me order a drink at the bar unless I was ordering food right then. She literally told me to go to the bar at the corner and have a drink while I waited for my boyfriend. I'm not the kind of person who drinks alone at a bar, especially when I can have a nice glass of wine with friends. The hostess clearly had a one-track mind for turn-over turn-over turn-over and $-$-$, rather than treating customers appropriately. There are many other places in the neighborhood that deal with much bigger crowds, like Little Star and Nopalito, and they do so with grace and good service, so I will gladly take my money there in the future.", "author": "Kate G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-04-08", "description": "This place has potential. If we got our pizza in a reasonable time and if was good, I'd easily rate a 4, but since neither happened, I give it a 2 or 2.5.  Our arugula salad was great. My date and I were starving, and our waitress indicated if we were hungry, get the large. So that was helpful. For pizza, we ordered the Hedgehog Mushrooms w/ provolone, ricotta, preserved lemon & Boccalone pancetta. To be honest all the pizzas looked good, our waitress was honest in indicating that she liked the potato w/applewood bacon one. So this is where my review turns sour. It took forever to get the pizza. Mind you this was a Thursday night, we were seated a little before 9pm. The restaurant by this time was only 1/2 full. We got our salad on time, and yet it took forever to get our pizza. In fact, I now remember our waitress initially was taking our order, someone dropped a glass, she excused herself to clean it up, then took about another 10 minutes to come back, was apologetic. So we order, get our salad, finish our salad. And wait. And wait some more. So after awhile, the restaurant is now 1/3 full, we're plainly sitting there, she looked at us like, \"where's your pizza\" to which we were, \"you tell us\"...I honestly thought she forgot to place the order.  A pizza comes out. Not ours. We get our pizza. We think it is the wrong one b/c we can't see any mushrooms on it, just what looks to be a solid, dark coating of the pancetta bacon crumbled up over 100% of the pizza (imagine not seeing any red of the tomato sauce.) The complaint both my date and I had was that there was a ridiculous amount of the pancetta, overwhelmingly so...it was crazy salty. could't taste the mushrooms, which our waitress upon ordering told us were similar to morels. We were ravenous at this point. So when there were two pieces left, neither of us wanted to have it boxed up. Our waitress had seen that i didn't order a 2nd glass of wine, and wanted to \"splash some more wine\" in my glass, apparently feeling bad for the long delay. After her 2nd entreaty, I relented for probably close to 1/2 a glass, but mind you at the 1st offer, I was so hungry, i didn't want to drink anything more on an empty-ish (salad only) stomach.  For dessert, after consulting our waitress, the only thing she steered us away from was the Nutella Pizza...we got and order of Bi Rite ice cream, Ricanelas (cinnamon with snickerdoodles). It was very small, but very, very good (as Bi Rite always is.) ...the only other thing I'd mention is that a lot of the staff were eating behind the bar...i mean, it was late, 10pm, and i could clearly see a handwashing station in the kitchen behind them, it's just that my date had waited tables before and said that she thought that unusual/unsanitary, but it's a tiny place...otherwise they'd have to eat before working their shift entirely, I suppose. Also, the staff kept opening the back door, so cold air kept blowing in...the waitress asked if we were ok with it, and she closed, but then they opened it again...so that wild mildly annoying...Like I said, I'd really rate 2.5, just that between the ridiculously long wait for thin crust pizza, which was not to our liking, it's hard to give even 3 stars, and could easily be a 4. A larger table next to us was very friendly making recommendations on pizza and pasta, having clearly enjoyed their meal. And it's a cute little place, very good for a date.

My dinner companion and I had to shout at each other through our entire meal.  I understand you have sound cushion thingy on the ceiling but it's not working.  Aside from the noise, the food was good overall. We started with the Oven Roasted Local Sardines which implied \"more than one\" and in fact it was \"only one\".  It was sooooo fishy and salty  it overpowered whatever stuffing was supposed to be inside.  Another table near us ordered it and it was all you could smell.  Next course the Braised Short Rib.  Though the taste and flavors were yummy & buttery and the pasta cooked just right, there was no bone just stringy meat.  The meat portion was plentiful but it could have used a little more pasta to soak up all the juices.  We ordered the Squash Blossom pizza with Pesto & Ricotta.  Lovely presentation, not too saucy which we loved.  Yummy buttery crust and somewhat yeasty but this just added to the flavor.  But the pizza was served on a cold plate so pizza didn't stay warm long and as we got to the last couple slices the crust became tough to cut and the crust became soggy.  We both really enjoyed the combination of ingredients on our pizza though and the size was adequate for 2.  To complete our dining experience we had the Flour-less Chocolate Cake (tough decision between this and the Cheesecake) which was heaven.  Moist, warm, lots of nuts, like a brownie on a plate.  Though we were told the whip cream was \"flavored\", it was not.  Given the dessert choices are quite good, I'd like to suggest a new one called \"Black & White\", which would consist of a 1/2 slice of Cheesecake and a 1/2 slice of Chocolate cake.  This way folks can try both for one price.  Bill came to $54 w/o drinks so a bit pricey in my book.  Would I go back, NO!  Again, the noise is so off-putting if I'm going to spend this much money I want to be able to enjoy the company of my dinner partner(s) without screaming.", "author": "Marla B."}

The nettle pizza was okay- I've never tried nettles before and was very curious but I found the flavor to be too strong, they almost tasted fishy (maybe that's what nettles are supposed to taste like but i wasn't in love) however, everything else about the pizza was good, and the other pizzas I saw looked great.

Have been to pizza places all across the city, and have had pizzas that were well cooked, undercooked, good ingredients, bad ingredients, you get the idea....  This is the first time that I have been to a restaurant where the pizza I was served was borderline inedible because of the amount of raw flour on the base of the pizza. It was bizarre. We had 4 pizzas on our table, and each one had the same issue. I am all for artisan bread with some flour dusted on the TOP of the bread BEFORE being thoroughly cooked in the oven, but there was so much flour packed in on the pizza base, that it never had a hope of cooking in the oven, and just ended up tasting bitter and chalky. Forgetting that for a moment, the crust itself was really bland, and had none of the delicious flavor of what I had at Gialina. How could the two places be so different?
