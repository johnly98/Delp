They offer a good assortment of meat and tortilla choices.\n\nMy typically order is a Super Burrito, with black beans, pico de Gallo, sour cream, jalape\u00f1os , and their green hot sauce. The flavor is pretty standard but it can get wet if they don't drain the meat. Almost $10 w/add ons.\n\nI would give a better review if the assembly line constructed a better burrito. The portion size varies almost every time and the extras you pay for (sour cream & guac) typically get dolloped on but not spread out evenly. So one portion of the burrito can have the sour cream, while the other half will have the guac. \n\nOccasionally I'll get the tacos but they are a bit overpriced, almost $5 per  w/add ons. Tasty but not a good value \n\nRegardless, I'll continue to come back because of proximity to work. But not something I'd go out of my way for.", "author": "Paolo B."}

I'd avoid it at all cost. The carnitas are better, but just average. Chicken options are all pretty forgettable. The only redeeming item on their menu is the Spicy Pico de Gallo. It rocks because it's actually spicy with generous chunks of peppers! (Is there anything sadder than mild pico?) But the quality of it (spice level) is so inconsistent you have to get lucky to get the memorable version. Sometimes you'll get batches where they skimp or short arm the pepper density. They even once used blended peppers which was strange. Bad quality control here for sure. Again, you have to get lucky. \n\nAlso note: If you order this place for delivery through Postmates or DoorDash, they are REALLY bad at order accuracy. Order the Spicy Pico de Gallo (really the only thing worth ordering here) and there's a 50/50 chance you get the sad arse mild version. 3-stars only when they manage to not screw up your order for Spicy Pico.

My sister and I were looking for a place to get lunch, and it looked promising. The place is extremely small. There are limited number of seats indoor against the walls. Where the seats are and the line forms are on the same side which might make eating inside awkward.\n\nService: One person takes your order, the next fills your taco/burrito/etc, and the last person rings up your order. They had their work flow down pat. However, because they were so efficient when completing the order and with the line, I felt rushed. \n\nFood: I got a regular size Beef Burrito.  They give large portions of whatever filling you request making the burrito very large. I didn't think that the burrito would keep its shape because of the way they folded the burrito. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I opened it back home. The burrito kept its shape for the rest of the meal. Aside from the large portions, I didn't find it anything exciting or new. Just another good 'ole burrito. They do have options for spinach or wheat tortilla.\n\nMy sister ordered a taco and a quesadilla. In my opinion, she pretty much ordered 2 tacos but one had a slice of cheese that they grilled on. So you're really not missing out on much if you don't get the quesadilla.\n\nI had high expectations for this place, but in the end, it was just a burrito. I would recommend it if you need something quick to grab to eat on the way. However, if that's the case, do not get the tacos because those are A LOT messier to eat.

The burritos are pathetic. They take store-bought pre-sliced cheese, slap it on a tortilla, throw on some meh-worthy fillings, and wrap it in a hurry. It's getting harder to find a burrito under $8, so I thought their burritos were a good deal for less than $6, but they are more like mini burritos. The super burritos are more like regular-sized burritos, which explains the seemingly low prices.\nAt least they offer crispy tacos.\nThe only thing really worth ordering is the Gordo Plate (~$7), simply because it is cheap and filling. But with none of the robust Mexican flavors. It includes pasty beans, watery salsa, rice, and a choice of meat. It's mostly rice with very little meat. Sour cream & guacamole cost extra.\nTheir saving grace is the service is fast. It shouldn't take more than a minute to scoop things into a box, ring it up, and get you on your way.", "author": "Joy W."}

First let to share that I'm from the Mission/La Mission; born and raised here in SF, I've has my fair share of tacos and burritos. This place is on a whole other level of BS. You have to order every specific ingredient and there's virtually no difference between the Super and Regular Burrito. Except for the price...This was also the 3rd time I paid the extra for a Super, asked to guacamole and sour cream then didn't get it. I allowed the cashier to distract me. Shame on me. Then I'm asked if I'd like some picante sauce, but i would tend to think 1/4 of a teaspoon doesn't meet any Latin standards on any level. My estimation is the cashier will talk to you while your food is being made, you're charged for the extras, but you won't get them. I confirm the ingredients for the Super weren't in there by the time I got home. (I was in a hurry and I didn't want Jack in the crack) Complain? Sure maybe, but this is the 3rd time I know this has happened and it's a good chance it's done intentionally. So I'll take to Yelp and give them 2 stars instead. 1 - star for appearance (it looks the part)  and location, 2nd star because I won't be coming back, it's the least I can do.

I finally got to try Gordo last month after many years of walking pass it on Clement with grandma as a little girl.  \n\nWe called our order when we were leaving CPMC and it was done by the time we arrived.  We both ordered a regular carnitas burrito (minus beans) and shared an order of chips.  Prices were cheap, parking was hard around 8 on a Friday, so he double parked (expected for Clement).   One thing that turns me off is that they don't give out free salsa, I mean, I guess that's fine if you don't have a salsa bar like some Mexican places, but the fact that you bought the chips and you still have to pay extra for one little container of salsa is kind of lame.  \n\nWe finally were ready to indulge once we got home.  It was still a good portion despite only being tomatoes, meat and rice.  The meat was tender and flavorful and the rice was great too.  Okay, totally can see the hype in Gordo's.

Flavor was definitely there and the burrito was nicely rolled up which ultimately lead me to regrettably scarfing down every last bite.  \n\nThe shop itself is small-ish with seats lined up against the front window and continues around to the side wall facing their wall of business cards.

I was starving and Gordo's was in the area. \n\nAmbiance/ Appearance:\nGordo's is pretty small inside. There are a few seats along the front window and sides of the wall. \n\nTaste: \nMy boyfriend ordered a grilled chicken quesadilla and I got a regular carne asada burrito without beans. The burrito was just eh; it was kind of dry and just... not too appealing even with the hot sauce. Usually when we go to Gordo's, we just get the quesadillas. This time around, I thought it was not as good as I have had in the past. It might of been because the outside was not as crisp, so everything became soggy really quickly because of the steam and pico de gallo, but they do put a lot of meet in the quesadillas. I hate how in both the quesadilla and the burrito, it would leak through the aluminum foil. \n\nOverall the food was okay. The total came out to around $11 something. I don't think I will be returning for a while, unless I am in dire need of Mexican food and quick (they get your order out pretty quickly).", "author": "Vivian Y."}

First of all, don't order the Quesadilla appetizer - it's a complete rip off for $2.99 a small tortilla deep fried with a slice of cheese on it folded in half.  It was too greasy and not even suitable for any child to consume.  I could have made a far better one when I got home.  You can buy a whole stack of tortillas for $3 and put as much cheese on it and the tortilla you get at the grocery store would be fresher than this.  Secondly, I ordered the Carnitas plate with refried beans and Spanish rice.  The most edible portion on the plate was the Spanish rice.  The Carnitas were oily, hard, dry, and too salty.

There are two notable exceptions to this personal rule: Nopa (to which I've so far deemed myself unable to do justice due to the weakness of my writing), and Gordo Taqueria - which I have almost literally gone to every week of my life since discovering it a few months into moving to San Francisco.  As near as I can tell, I've eaten there roughly 750 times.  \n\nEvery one of those times but three, I've ordered the exact same thing - Super Burrito with \"Crispy\" Carnitas and \"Everything\".  That's not to say that there's anything on their menu that I haven't tried - I've just only done it by trying other people's food - because I can't waste my weekly fix on anything but the Carnitas.  And I have introduced virtually everyone who comes to San Francisco to this quintessential.  Multiple guests have told me that they later literally had dreams about their burrito.  My firstborn son's third word was \"Gordo.\"\n\nFor the haters who are gonna hate - San Francisco is full of amazing taquerias and I've given up convincing people from here that mine is better than theirs.  Taqueria loyalty in SF is stronger than religion for a lot of folks as far as I can tell.  \nSuffice it to say a few things seem to differentiate this place for me specifically - total freedom in the ordering process no matter what dish you've selected (I've noted that some places enforce a more Soup-Nazi-like purity in their receptivity to modifications and additions), the quality of the carnitas themselves - juicy / rich / crispy, the tendency of the burrito rollers to add the ingredients as larger chunks which leads to a more heterogeneous mouth-feel that adds a little bit of uncertainty in each bite (as opposed to carefully balancing every square millimeter via a stirring move like many other places seem to do).\n\nDownsides: the pico de gallo can be inconsistent - and be warned that ordering a side of spicy salsa REALLY means spicy - they're not playing around.  Also the to-go number seemed to be a well-guarded line-skipping secret until recently, when more and more folks started glomming on to this.

Location - far from us. :-(\n\nSo my wife and I live in Russian Hill.  One day (sometimes two) every weekend we need to get our burrito fix.  The closest joints are Nick's Crispy Tacos, Pancho's, and the new Uno Dos.  But, each of these, while good, has its flaws that keep them from being in the upper echelons of the burrito competition.  So, we typically drive to La Corneta in the Mission (see my separate review) while looking for some closer alternatives.\n\nGordo on Clement has a whole different philosophy than La Corneta, and a much smaller menu, but it will now be our go-to burrito place on the north west side of the City.  The food was great and the prices right.  \n\nI had the carnitas super burrito, with extra black beans of course.  The meat was tender, flavorful, and unlike a lot of other places, not at all fatty.  As I chewed my first bite, I thought - Man, that's delicious.  It continued that way through the entire burrito.  My wife had her usual - veggie super burrito no rice, no sour cream.  She said hers was also delicious.\n\nNormally, I like to fire my burritos up with pickled onion, habanero sauce, etc., but these aren't available at Gordo, so I had to take it as their chef intended.

It's a damn burrito, not a chicken wrap from McDonald's. And why do they put very little queso in a quesadilla?

My love for Gordo's burritos pre-dates the creation of Yelp.  True story: I once had a full meal at PPQ involving roasted crab and garlic noodles then proceeded to order a burrito down the street from Gordo's and finish it.  And no, I am well within the average weight range for someone my size!\n\nOn Friday night, I was stuck in a screening of Alexander Payne's Nebraska at ILM@Presidio, and was seriously contemplating leaving early if Gordo's closed at 9pm.  I resigned myself to the fact that they would be closed, and checked their hours in vain.  I literally whooped and jumped when I saw that they closed at 10pm!  It was one of the most glorious eating experiences I've had in the past few months, and that includes a whole steamed crab and clam chowder from Swan Oyster Depot and dim sum from Koi Palace.  That is not to put down either of those fine establishments.  I thoroughly enjoyed their delectable food.  I don't care what anyone else says, Gordo's on Clement is my number one house of burritos.\n\nFor my all-time can't miss burrito configuration, try this: spinach tortilla, boiled chicken, black beans, pico de gallo (salsa), sour cream, hot sauce.

Giving a place a review based on one visit is extremely flawed.  If you had asked me 3 months ago how I felt about Gordo I would have given 4 stars.  \n\nInstead, if I erased that memory and used the last month it would be 2 max, if not 1.  Why?  \n\nMeat portion.  It used to be very significant portion of the burrito.  And damn good intoxicating flavor at that.  Lately, minimal.\n\nI think it is related to the smaller younger employee who seems to be new.  The portions he serves is extremely small in comparision to the other bigger employees.  Keep in mind I eat 4-6 burritos from them a month minimum so it isn't a one-time ' well bleep ' occurence. \n\nI noticed it about a month ago and shrugged it off, again, then again last week while getting the mouth-watering steak super burrito.  I came away perplexed at how little meat was in the burrito.  Now today I ordered carnitas super burrito.  I (insert swear word here) you not I only got about half a cup, if not less than a quarter, of carnitas in the whole burrito.  I couldn't even TASTE the meat.  I think he used his fingertips to pull the meat out after he chopped it up.  The remaining chopped amount on table he put on 2 other burritos which I suspect were for employees since there was no line.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, the carnitas is very salty, very dominating, and very GOOD.  But if you order the saltiest meat on the menu and you can't taste it?  Something is going wrong.  If I wanted a burrito with nearly 60% rice, 35% beans and 5% meat I would ask for it.  No, I would ask for a vegetarian burrito because that is what it was.  \n\nI take that back. I wouldn't even order a vegetarian. I'll take my service elsewhere if it happens again.  I took a picture of it in the MIDDLE of the burrito to illustrate the point and put it up on Yelp.\n\nOh, side note, if he is doing that because he was trained to give less, then that is just bad business sense.

What is your secret?\n\nWith a few hours left before a friend's wedding reception, I was getting hungry. I wanted to try Taqueria La Cumbre because I was determined to go on a Man vs Food run in SF... However around New Years Eve the traffic inside the city was No Bueno. So my family and I decided to try out Gordo's based on a recommendation. It was very strange going to a local Mexican food shop completed suited up. I know we looked gansta, but we were just hungry and felt like some good Mexican food. \n\nSurprisingly, there were a lot of customers in the joint, but we happen to enter with no line. Since this was a new place for me, I didn't know what to order. I always hate that feeling whenever I walk up to any restaurant counter and don't know what to get.. because you know this annoys most workers. I quickly scanned the menu and decided to get the Super Burrito All Meat. I thought this would be pre-made order with no options needed, but I guess you need to pick what you want in the burrito. After placing my order, I wasn't sure if the server heard me because of how noisy it was in the kitchen. So, I repeated my order ALL MEAT. So he literally gave me a lit bit of each type of meat. No Rice No Beans No cheese No filling of any kind. I realized I should have been more specific with the fillings. Oh well, this time it worked out for the best. Carnitas, Carne Asada, Chicken, and Chili Verde. \n\nI took one bite and I was in love. I felt satisfied that if this was my last meal on earth I would die happy. Add this to the list of items to rub in my face if I ever think about become Vegan. There's really nothing special about Gordo its just simple and delicious food. No silly names or brown rice, just a burrito, taco, or quesadilla the way you want it. Maybe it's lard or maybe it's made with love, but this 6 dollar burrito is way better than a lot of expense dishes I have tried. \n\nI will make sure to stop by Gordo again next time I'm in San Francisco again.", "author": "Jason L."}

I prefer my cheese/tortilla to be warmed on a skillet to get a crispier/harder texture (personal preference). \n\nThe beef was alright (still a little dry), chili verde was good (tender), chicken was good as well.

The cashier and the preparer were having a negative conversation and it was reflected in their demeanor.  In addition, due to the obvious PC types more aligned in the Richmond as opposed to the Mission, they seemed to be more inquisitive about the fillings and condiments.  Refried versus black beans.  No sour cream.  No avocado.  No salsa.  Mild salsa.  \"No, I want a normal quesadilla.  Refried beans.  Sour cream.  Spicy Salsa.\"  When in Rome, I do as they do.  Which means everything.  Spicy.  Jalapeno peppers.  Plain and simple.\n\nWhen I walked away, they started asking me what kind of beans.  \n\n\"What?  Just refried.\"\n\nThey thought I wanted the black beans.  I said everything.  They asked me if I wanted salsa.  Dang.  What Mexican place does not include salsa with their food?

I probably won't hit this burrito place in the Richmond, although I'm definitely open to trying new places.  I'll just return to the Mission for my usual loud and dirty Taqueria experience with all the yelling and chaos that ensues with the typical staff behind the counter.  \"Everything, Miha?\"  But it is what I'm use to and what I've grown up with.

You have to interrupt their conversation to order. I've never been asked, \"What would you like?\". I've had them wander away or start talking while I'm mid-sentence. That might even be forgivable if they didn't screw up my order again and again. I usually order the same thing: beef burrito, black beans, NO RICE.

The rice was bland, the meat was not even close to flavorful, I needed more pico de gallo and hot sauce (which wasn't even good in the first place, I just needed more flavor some where). I was still hungry afterwards. My husband said the carnitas was dry, choke down the throat dry. \n\nI really can't believe a burrito place in California does this well. I should open one too then since it doesn't seem to require much to make a burrito. I would rather go to Taco Bell than get a burrito here in the future.  \n\nService is slow, price is decent, but for the quality, I would rather cough up a few more bucks for something better.", "author": "Lang T."}

Carnitas was the prepared meat of choice this visit, although more often than not I choose chicken when eating mexican food. It surely didn't disappoint. The pork was tough, and meaty, just the way I like it. It wasn't too salty and tasted fresh. It was chopped up right in front of me seconds before being laid onto the tortilla.\n\nThe chunks of tomato in the salsa were bright red, and a very tasty and refreshing addition to the rice and pinto beans. The rice and beans were also very good tasting, and had the perfect proportion to the rest of the ingredients (ie It didn't feel like I was munching on a log of bean and rice with small chunks of dry chicken every now and then).\n\nI purchased a small drink to go with it, and opted not to pay extra for chips and salsa. All in all it was under $7! \n\nThe one, albeit small, problem that I had with the burrito was the tortilla itself. I don't know whether it was steamed too long, or not long enough, but something wasn't right. It tasted alright, however, a little bit of it got stuck to my teeth with every third bite or so.

After all: the portions are ginormous, the ingredients are fresh, and the price is oh-so-right. There was a week, or two, where Gordo was the one real meal I ate -- and for that, I'll always be grateful.\n\nThe only downside? Flavor. As far as Mexican joints go, this one is a little on the dull side. That being said, if you're not afraid of a little spice, ask them to throw on their *SECRET* red hot sauce, as well as their salsa verde, you're taste-buds will get a little weak in the knees.

I've been coming here since I was a wee lad in elementry school, 25+ years ago(...actually just down the street from this place). Ahh...such memories! I used to get a super carnitas burrito AND a carnitas flour quesadilla (yup, I ate both at the time!) before balling it up after school in the yard(kick/war or hand ball)!\n\nWell, times a changing...I can't eat both anymore. Thankfully the taste has not changed. Both the super carnitas burrito and carnitas flour quesadilla I normally order, taste the same as I remember it when I was a kid. (Maybe a very slight difference...and that it's not as greasy nowadays as I remembered it. I guess due to health consciousness.) One of my favorite things about this place, the carnitas flour quesadilla...it tends to seep a liquid (not thick nor light) tasting of cilantro, tomato, onion, and grease from the cheese and carnitas that tastes of....I dunno...something of awesome goodness! Man, I tend to sip that stuff from the foil!\n\nI love me some good carnitas, and these guy here do it right. Not too dry, good texture, great taste.\n\nAlso, this location (which is also the original location)  is different/better then the other two locations in SF. Why?...because the guys that work here are bigger then the workers at the other locations!...even though it's a small place. Why do I say that? It's because of a theory I have. My theory is this. At a taqueria, you get a better/bigger burrito, or what not, depending on how big the guy/gal who is putting together your order. A big/huge guy/gal makes a bigger/better order, whereas a small/tiny guy/gal makes a smaller/not so great order. Ponder this, a bigger person makes a better burrito or order because they like to eat! They put it together as how they would make it for themselves. They are hungry, and will not hold back!...whereas a smaller person has a smaller appetite, they will hold back. They will not put together an order which they would not eat or finish for themselves. I call this the FAT=PHAT! theory.\n\nLong story short, try this place out. If it's not one of the best, then at least expect a very solid (or more then) taqueria. This is a very tiny place, no thrills, no nothing,,,,just a straight up good taqueria. \n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Paolo V."}

Put some more money on the counter, bitch! This is one of the few places that charges for chips and salsa and I totally agree with them on it fully on their decision. I don't need something I won't eat. Most of the time, chips and salsa are part of the price you pay for the entire order. I would rather have them charge me for that than to add that onto my bill and give it to me to throw away at home.\n\nAnd the menu is freaking simple. Choose your food. Then your meat. And if it applies, chose your wrap. Then the rest is simple. They ask you what kind of beans and meat. You want onions? You want hot sauce? Jalapenos are extra and you need to tell them. Also, if you want the sour cream and guac, now's the time to tell them if you haven't ordered it super already. Then you slide over to the left and pay the man behind the register.\n\nI order a burrito most of the time and when I am really hungry, a quesadilla. This is where they lose a star from me...Their quesadillas are awesome but they have one major flaw...The juices from the meat and onions always flow out of it. Kinda a non matter but when it starts to leak all over everything and then if there was a hole in the bag and it leaks over some other stuff you have in other bags, not a happening thing. But that is my only qualm with them. But usually this meal of both costs less than 11 bucks. What a bargain! And it is freaking filling even without the quesadilla.\n\n\nSo if you are hungry, then bring your appetite here. Super fast and super good!

The Chile Verde Gordo plate I ordered was packaged up in a to-go container with rice, black beans, pico de gallo, and tender, moist, beautiful chile verde. I requested guacamole and spicy sauce to be added. The four hot corn tortillas were packed up in aluminum, where they might have gotten soggy if I did not eat in my friend's car (since we're fatties- and since we were famished after hitting up lap swim at Rossi pool).\n\nMy friend ordered a black bean and cheese super burrito and we got chips and spicy salsa to go with all of this food. The result? Mountains of delicious, satisfying Mexican for dinner, all in my friend's pick up truck while watching the waning crowds of people at the fruit shop in front of us. While the fruit smelled good outside, our food inside the car smelled better. My Gordo plate was so filling and tasty; I will definitely order it again. \n\nThe spicy salsa was muy caliente, and my friend went back to get more water after trying it.

Came here looking for a quick, delicious dinner before walking over to the California Academy of Sciences for Nightlife. I picked up a Chicken Burrito with beans, rice, guacamole, and sour cream for about $5.75. This doesn't come with complementary chips and salsa like other taquer\u00edas, but I'm not going to give this place one less star because I'm not a douche. \n\nTransparency\nPretty common now with delis and burrito places, they make your food as you order it. You can see everything they put into it, and they don't hold back. Ingredients were leaking out from all holes as they folded my burrito, but luckily the foil held everything together while I ate it. It's also nice to have the capability to watch them make your food, so you can make sure they don't add any unwanted...\"byproducts\"...\n\nVariety of Ingredients\nMy friends and I liked that the variety of ingredients is fairly consistent between types of burritos. You don't have to get a super burrito to get the additional ingredients that don't normally come with a normal burrito. The only difference between the regular burritos and super burritos is the addition of cheese and the size. \n\nFilling Factor\nI consider myself a big eater; my friends call me a trash can, which makes me sad deep down. Despite that, a regular burrito filled me enough to last until the end of the night, even with all the walking and yelling at CAS Nightlife. \n\nTaste\nMy burrito tasted good. Great even. I'd say it ranks among the best burritos I've had. But then again, I'm not the pickiest of eaters. You might not like their burritos if you're a burrito snob who only eats burritos made of gold. Or if you're allergic to burritos.\n\nI haven't tried all of the Burrito places in SF, so of course there may be other equally good or better ones.

Anyways, as I was saying, I think I was mocked when I ordered chips & salsa as I was paying, the dude said \"chips & salsa\" in a really high voice (not that I have a super high voice, although sometimes I will sound like a 12 year old girl on an answering machine, close enough that I've been able to tell telemarketers that \"no sir, my parent's aren't home right now.\") Yeah so, he was either mocking me or had a voice like he had no balls. I hope its both, that he has no testicles and that he was mocking me, then I wouldn't feel so bad that he had no balls. So there's a star knocked off for that, btw everyone else working was indifferently pleasant.\n\nAbout the food: My super burrito was good, not great. I did appreciate how all the ingredients were evenly distributed from top to bottom. The carne asada was especially good, it was as if they grilled me up a marinated steak and simply cut it up and put it in my burrito. Its not the normally tiny thin chopped carne asada I'm used to, it definitely tastes like real grilled steak. It wasn't bad for the price, very reasonable at $5 something, plus they take card if you're a never-carrying-cash citizen like myself. The mild salsa I got with the chips was super bland. I needed hot sauce, I forgot to ask if they give some to go.... \n\nMaybe if I want a burrito on this side of town again I will return, see if they hand out hot sauce, and see if the balls-ass-guy is really an ass or if I made up the situation in my head.

The problems with the Mission however, are 1, if you live in the Richmond or anywhere else in the city, it's a major pain in the ass to go all the way to the Mission just to get a friggen burrito, and 2, the filthy, filthy hipsters/yuppies/same thing. Gordo's is great because it offers a cheap ($6.50 FOR A CARNITAS BURRITO OMG) without the journey or the aforementioned hipsters. Service is lightning fast. Provided you know what you want and your money is ready, you can walk in and out before the door you walked through has closed. My point is, Gordo's has great burritos for it's cost, time taken to get there, and overall flavor. The Gordo's on Clement is also more friendly than Geary's. Another thing is, the place is TINY. The guys behind the counter look pretty cramped. There's seating for about 10 on a counter. No tables. Doesn't matter though. The first thing you notice walking in here can be one of two things:\n\nA. The place itself.\n\nOR\n\nB. The freaky painting of half to two thirds-naked Mayan people discovering what is modern day Mexico City.\n\nCrazy  I know.\n\nBut what about the burritos themselves?

Not like they're hurting for business!\n\nI've been going to Gordos since the early 80s, they started me i guess you can say on Mexican food, especially the burrito.

Then invaded LA and San Diego next and sampled what they offered in Mexican. \n\nMoved back to the hood about 10 years ago and started going to Gordos again and you know what, i like Gordos. I think its the flavor of their rice. Maybe the salsa too. Whatever it is that makes a Gordos burrito different from the ones served elsewhere, i like it . Its distinctive, flavorful, well-built (doesn't fall apart easily-CRUCIAL to a burrito!)\n\nSo yeah, go to a Gordos if you haven't yet.

Go to your run-of-the-mill Mexican food place, and it is a flour tortilla filled with cheese and meat (in some cases). Go to a slightly better Mexican food establishment and it comes with guacamole, sour cream and pico de gallo in neatly displayed portions alongside. Go to Gordo and it is STUFFED with sour cream and guacamole, the already superior cheese oozing out of the lightly browned tortilla as if it wants to climb into your mouth.

I don't think this place is authentic enough for me. Not enough flavor, a bit bland, seems a bit Americanized? so to speak. I'd say it's comparable to Chipotle. Then again, some people love Chipotle. But if you want a real good burrito, go to the Mission. You won't be disappointed, that's forsure.", "author": "Howie T."}

Don't get me wrong, the staff is super friendly and efficient. The customers (which are obviously regulars) are also very fast and efficient! hehehe, so If you're not sure what you want you better go wait in the back of the line and not piss anyone off! Its a trip to watch how fast they make their burritos and its great that they do everything right there in front of you. Have your $ ready because as soon as you pay you're handed your order and boom you better move outta the way for the continuous flow of people coming in behind you! This place is very small and there aren't any tables to lounge at. A bench was found outside where my boyfriend and I shared our beast of a burrito. We got the carnitas super burrito and let me tell you that pork was juicy! The parts of the burrito that were just rice and beans (you get to pick between black and pinto) were a lil dry so I would suggest asking for some salsa verde (if you can handle the spice) to top everything off before they roll it up. I didn't see any salsitas lying around on the counter anywhere so your only option might be to get it inside the burrito.  For $5 two people were fully satisfied off of one burrito. talk about some amazingly cheap eats!!!", "author": "Niki P."}

Has anyone ever had a GORDO burrito?  My friend David, looked at me and with much enthusiasm..  said GORDOs!  His eyes were wide and mouth was watering with drool.  I said to him, so you understand?!  He immediately nodded like some kind of common secret was just revealed.  Now my other friend Tony was seeing  this and had a look of confusion on his face and was like.. umm okay.  I don't get it.  We told him to go to San Francisco, go to Gordo and you will understand.  He did just that. One day we were again having lunch in LA and Tony said \"GORDOs!!!!\"  He understood.  We've converted many people to being a GORDO lover and if you're scratching you heard in confusion.. go to one of the few locations up in the bay area and you will understand too.  I still don't understand one thing... If LA is so close to Mexico, you would think that there would be a better place for a burrito than all the way up in the bay area.  I have yet to find one that can beat out GORDO.  My recommendation.  Don't just try the burrito.  Try the Quesadilla.  Trust me.  It's not what you think it is.", "author": "John B."}

They have this awesome little press that melts the cheese right onto the tortilla before filling it with beans, meat, salsa, guac, etc.  It makes any burrito taste better, and I have no idea why every burrito place doesn't have one.  In fact, I've only seen something similar in one other burrito place (and I eat a lot of Mexican food (and yes, I know a burrito isn't actually Mexican, but whatever)).  Calling in orders is a good timesaver (as it can get very busy sometime), and walking in past the line and going straight to the cashier definitely makes you feel like a big man, but you run the very real risk of not getting exactly what you ordered.  So if you aren't in a huge hurry, definitely order right there, and they are totally willing to give you more or less of an ingredient if you just ask.  Gotta love Gordos!", "author": "Ari B."}
