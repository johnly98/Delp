I'm not sure what the white shrimp are exactly, but they have been tender and their flavor standout even with the very spicy sauce. It makes the other foods I've tried are bland by comparison, which is probably why I often see families with kids here. And the aforementioned spicy salsa can always add the desired kick.

Their Mexican food is less authentic than Taco Bell and also far less delicious, but they give you plenty of warm chips (with free refills) and (really good cilantro-y) salsa on the house, so come for the margs! They usually have drink specials most days of the week, for example Taco Tuesdays they have $5 margaritas (do NOT order their taco Tuesday tacos. They're really tiny and not good), and I went Wednesday and they had $19 pitchers of margaritas. Rocks and blended, same price. So, despite the fact that I have hated everything I've ever ordered to eat here, Celia's margaritas have kept me coming back time and again. Eat beforehand and come ready to drink\n\nSome more specifics on the food. One time I ordered fish tacos and it was just unbattered fish cubes with some pickled jalepenos on top. One time I ordered steak tacos and they gave me steak tacos in a hard shell with some sort of weird mole type thing on top, like what? I assumed by default they'd come in a soft shell, and the waitress did not ask nor did the menu specify. Refried beans are pretty decent. Mexican rice is barely spiced. And again, the taco tuesday tacos are a horrible choice. The barest minimum amount of bland filling in a soft shell about 1/3 the size of a normal taco tortilla.", "author": "Katie N."}

It also said the beans and rice were vegan, yet the beans had cheese on them... which we like, but is just another example of poor communication/menu.

It was only half full with customers.  They may only have 3.5 stars, but based on our visit there, they should REALLY be in the 4 star and above category!!\n\nThe ambiance was FESTIVE, loud, spacious, a large hut inside with spacious tables, comfy \nsofa seats great for groups and even families with kids. They serve many different types of alcoholic drinks along with non-alcoholic drinks.  They even had tvs which were high up near the ceiling but could be easily seen by their large projections against the sides of the restaurant walls. \n\nThe service was EXCELLENT--Our table always had someone asking if we wanted more chips, drinks, etc.  If I asked for another drink, it came in good time. And our meal only took at most 10-15 minutes, all while they made sure we had drinks and nacho chips/salsa appetizers.\n\nThe crispy thin chips & mild salsa tasted fresh. The food was pricy at $13.95 for a carnitas burrito, but when it came you could see why--it was HUGE with fresh chopped tomato/sour cream toppings. There was a side of coleslaw.  My friend ordered Nachos with ground beef and for about $10.95 and she had not eaten anything the whole day and EVEN SHE SAID SHE FELT FULL because they give you A LOT!!  She also thought her meal was soooo tasty.  You may want to ask them to add lettuce & rice on your nachos since those were not on the nachos my friend ordered.  Except for the drinks which was about $4 to $5 for VERY SMALL agua frescas, the food was definitely a great value!! I mean, no where in the outer Sunset/Richmond area can you come out with a $35 tab for 2 people for fresh, tasty, high quality MEXICAN food, with generous portions, with excellent service/ambiance. I did NOT think the food was authentic Mexican because the marinade and mexican taste would be more evident such as in Mission St Taquerias, but as a No#1 mexican place in the Ocean Beach/Sunset/Richmond area, it's a #1 Mexican place in MY book-just based on ambiance/service and high quality/generous amt of food.

We were told it would be 15-20 minutes, which we were ok with. 7:15 rolled around and we still had 3 parties in front of us. My wife noticed people walking in and sitting at the small round tables in the foyer. We inquired about those tables and were told it was a first come first serve section. Why we weren't told this at the beginning, why would they have a section in the middle of the restaurant like that? We ended up swooping up on one of these tables. The service was decent but the hostess didn't know how to do their jobs. Food was also decent, I just know that I would never wait 45 plus minutes for this restaurant ever again on any trips to San Francisco.", "author": "Eddie K."}

Oh yes! It might even be sweeter than bottomless mimosas, but they serve different purposes. I usually prefer the Celia's in Daly City, but this one was closer to my homegirl's house, so I rolled over.\n\nHeaded to the spot last night as my dear friend wanted to take me out for my birthday (two months ago) and this was the first time we both could make it happen. I met her and two other loverly ladies at the bar while we waited for our table. Obviously, the people who you go to dinner with make it a special event and a good time (which we had), but our waitress and really the whole staff was attentive, prompt, and friendly. \n\nI ordered three soft tacos, one with each kind of meat: shredded chicken, picadillo, and beef. They were very good and I appreciate that Celia's has Tobasco sauce (my fave). My friend had tow crunchy tacos and I immediately wished I got those when I saw the size of mine: seriously *Teeny Tiny*! And if there's one thing I can't stand in this world, it's tacos that are too small. But whatevs, I ate, I drank, I was merry. \n\nThe guac was decent, mixed with salsa and some salt it got a lot better, plus it was free. We all had The Standing Man which is a Carona upside down in their house margarita and it was superb. Happy hour prices are very reasonable, I will surely be back.", "author": "Crystal C."}

I guess it depends on the server you have. Our server the first time was amazing. On time with food, refills, and checked in on us every now and then. Well, the second time we went, we ended up with a waitress. Evening was going well in the beginning. I ran out of my coke and I never got a refill.   She brought the food, and noticed our cups were empty, didn't even bother to refill our drinks. 25 minutes passed by before a different server who passed by our table asked us if we needed our drinks to be refilled.

Waited til 830p before I finally got my order with no real update the whole time I was there. Hostess was no help at all and had no idea what she was doing! Saw someone drop off a to go order at the front. Had to ask her if it was mine. She didn't know and made me wait even longer! Would have completely cancelled the order if I hadn't already pay for it. Plus I would have had to wait to do it! So annoyed!!!\n\nOkay that was completely written out of frustration. I understand that restaurants can get busy. I grew up in one. But communication should be the key when food is lagging right?! They could have called if they were running behind. Or they could have given us an ETA when we got there. Instead they just made us wait with no update whatsoever.\n\nAfter all this I really wanted to enjoy some Mexican food. Boy was I disappointed! Almost everything was super bland and dry. I basically drenched everything in hot sauce so I could eat it.  That was the only way to make anything palatable!\n\nThe Expresso burrito was the worse. The carnitas had the texture of jerky, but not the awesome flavor of jerky. Not what you would want from a wet burrito! So super hard and chewy!!!\n\nEverything else was simply bland even though it was covered in sauce. The chicken in my enchiladas was dry. The chimichanga was super doughy and nothing else. The chile relleno had no flavor. The taco and carne asada were the best of the worst. Both managed to retain some flavor and the taco shell some crunchiness.  But this didn't make up for the rest of the food.\n\nHonestly I would have given this place 2, maybe 2.5 stars based on the food, but since the service was so horrendous, I bumped it down to 1. And I hardly ever give 1 star to any establishment. Maybe I went on an off night. But there was really no redeeming quality about this place.

I try to support my local businesses, and, seeing as I live just a few blocks away, I decided to give Celia's a try. \n\nWe got in and I put my name down for two, and we were told that it would be a fifteen minute wait. We were fine with that, so we went to the bar area and ordered some drinks. A server came over to us, cleaned our table, and brought some chips and salsa, good service! The salsa was really good too! After waiting about fifteen minutes, we were given a table.\n\nI ordered the enchilada and chile relleno plate, and my girlfriend ordered the enchilada and taco plate. My girlfriend doesn't like spicy so she couldn't finish her taco, if you aren't a fan of spicy, don't get the shredded beef, but we both enjoyed the enchiladas and my chile relleno was very tasty! It is a bit more expensive than your grab and go Mexican, but it won't break the bank.\n\nLastly, I really like the decor! The colors, art work, light fixtures, and murals really give it a lively vibe.

The guy even asked if we wanted to try the other home made salsas the restaurant has to offer (get the green one - so good)! \n\nWe ordered 2 house margaritas and shrimp ceviche to start with and it was just perfect. The lime juice marinade was refreshing and the shrimp were very fresh and juicy. The margaritas were just right and I was pretty shocked it was a \"house margarita.\"\n\nI really wanted to try their \"wet\" espresso sauce on my burrito. I asked my waitress what she thought of it and was surprised with her honesty. She told me she wasn't too big of a fan of wet burritos and the sauce itself and recommended that I get it on the side. I ordered the shrimp burrito with the sauce on the side and it came out amazing! Mind you, I was just getting better from the stomach flu and completely devoured my burrito! So good! There were plenty of shrimp inside and the only thing I wish was if the waitress asked what kind of beans I wanted inside (I guess I should have remembered to specify black beans).

It was great because we live nearby, so it was a great place to go if we weren't feeling up to making dinner. I would have given Celia's 5 stars before, but in the past few months we've had a few bad experiences that really left us in disbelief. I wonder if management has changed or something last year?\n\nDuring our visit in October, the tostada salad was one of the most disgusting things I've ever tried. I ordered it vegetarian with no beans and no sour cream. It came out vegetarian but with beans and sour cream, plus it looked terrible. I sent it back and after a few minutes, what looked like a chef or manager or someone came out and asked me what was wrong with it and claiming it was what I ordered. I explained my order and after a bit of arguing, he went back to the kitchen. A new one came out after my boyfriend was almost done with his meal...\n\nThe most disgusting part was literally everything about the salad. The tostada was tiny, wet, soaked with oil and limp. The lettuce was cheap shredded taco lettuce. Half the vegetables were cooked, so the finely shredded lettuce got warm and limp fast. There was a single piece of broccoli and it tasted incredibly rancid. There was melted cheese on the bottom of everything, so it stuck to the plate. It was so bad and I already felt guilty for sending it back in the first place, so I ate not even a quarter of it.\n\nNext visit in November: I left the October visit behind me, because I was positive we would have a better visit to my previously favorite Mexican restaurant... The service was slower than ever. It was so bad, I watched a table in the back of the room get upset with the waiter then walk out (I guess they were waiting a long time, too). My mom ordered fajitas and the flour tortillas never came until the end, so they were dessert I guess? Everything bad that could have happened, really did. I don't think our waiter was to blame. I think the kitchen was backed up or they were understaffed or something.\n\nBasically it leaves me to believe this restaurant had some bad change happen, so now we won't be going back, unless if management changes again maybe. I miss the old wait-staff we used to see. I didn't recognize any of the staff the past 2 times we came here.", "author": "Nic E."}

This room hasn't changed much since it's renovation; most of the upgrade was done to the entrance and bar area. \n\nOur server, Sasha was kind and very efficient. She regularly came by to refill our waters, chip bowl, and salsa, and our food come out quickly. Tonight's chicken tostada was spot on. The meat was tender and flavorful and the fresh veggies were a good pairing - iceberg lettuce, tomato, avocado, plus beans, sour cream, salsa and melted cheese. In addition to shredded chicken, this dish comes with an option of picadillo (shredded beef), ground beef, or cheese. In the future, I'll order this without the tostada - I'd eat it with the chips since the tostada tends to get soggy. \n\nOn our way out, the staff showered us with thank yous.

Anyway, my husband and I were starving- even contemplating the rather sketchy \"Golden Gate Pizza & Indian Cuisine\" place- but ended up choosing Celia's instead. Coincidentally, the last time we'd gone out to eat with these same friends, it had been to Celia's as well- one of the Peninsula locations.\n\nAnyway: the four of us had a great time! Our waitress was really nice, and we were able to luxuriate in a long lunch, catching up with our friends, and enjoying decent and utterly satisfying Mexican food. Our party included an infant, so we tried to isolate ourselves in one side of the back room. It ended up being a really relaxing meal ... we never felt rushed for time, or embarrassed by the baby's (admittedly few) unhappy moments.\n\nWe started off with sangria (for the dudes) and virgin mango margaritas (for the ladies). I believe the sangria was a hit; the margaritas less so. I thought it tasted far more of orange juice than mango; also, the glasses were constantly leaking, with either melting ice, overfilled contents, or ... some part of the margarita? We couldn't figure it out, but did end up using a lot of napkins to sop up the spillage.\n\nNachos rancheros, with black beans and chicken, was a tasty starter and totally whetted our appetites. The free chips and salsa (mild, verde, and spicy) were also good. Everyone enjoyed their entrees:\n\nPollo en crema\nCancun platter\nSmall combo- with enchilada\nChicken quesadilla (grilled chicken, with black beans); my go-to order and idea of heaven\n\nMy husband and I had some leftovers, which we greedily gobbled down after returning home.

It is bastardized for Anglo tastes and has not resemblance to any authentic Mexican cuisine.  I know Mexican food because I happen to be a second-generation Mexican-American born in the USA.  About the only thing that is Mexican here is the name - Celia's.\n\nLet's start with the over sweet Margarita.  What a waste of Tequila.  The salsa was right out of a jar with a hefty dose of salt to help to improve the taste.  \n\nI ordered the Chile Relleno and enchilada combo.  I make Chile Rellenos at home and make enough to freeze as it is a time consuming dish to prepare so why not make enough to freeze for another day.  What I got at Celia's was basically a cooked egg patty, like an omelet, wrapped around a green chile.  I was shocked.  Picture the egg omelet you get at Subway in the breakfast sandwich.  This is certainly not a Chile Relleno in any region of Mexico.  Disgusting!\n\nThe enchilada sauce was canned green sauce.  I found this odd as it is customary to get red enchilada sauce unless you happen to be in New Mexico where they ask - Red or Green. It was all too salty.\n\nThe whole Pinto beans were okay.  After all how can you screw up whole beans?  The rice was passable.\n\nThe service was not there.  While the waitress was pleasant the overall service was nothing to feel a standard 20% tip was in order.  \n\nI can't say I would ever return to this place to eat.  It's a shame to see what the family Matriarch built with pride for her family to leave to the descendants is reduced to a shadow of what the service and food here used to be like when I firs had it several decades ago.\n\n\u00a1Que lastima que la comida aqu\u00ed no vale un comino!", "author": "Catania G."}

We were given chips and two types of salsa right away. The chips were stale? and the salsa tasted like it came out of a can (bummer). We got free guac with our check in but it tasted like it was pre-packaged and it was super watery. \n\nWe ordered nachos and two types of burritos. The nachos were ok. Lots of cheese, some guac, and good scoop of chicken meat. The california and the fajita burritos were next. The california had some flavor to it with a salsa that had a kick. The meat, carne asada, had some good flavor to it. My burrito was tasteless and super dry. Although the carne asada was the same there was no flavor and no kick in this wrap. \n\nThe service was good.

I haven't tried the tacos as I see many people complaining about but I always get the California burrito and my partner gets the fajitas and both dishes are amazing. I'd like to say I've been to my fair share of Mexican restaurants and this is definitely not a bad one. Margaritas are expensive here but that's okay.

Yet again, I am amazed by the gems that encrust the Outer Sunset. I want to wave a sunset-colored flag. I want to write an anthem about fog, Ocean Beach, quiet streets, sushi, and include my latest discovery, Celia's. It's strange to call it a discovery, because Celia's has been there forever, and it's strange and unusual that it took me so long to get myself over there. \n\nI can rave about the environment. From the outside it's just like the rest of the Outer Sunset -- quiet, humble, and quaint. The inside, however, is colorful, warm, and surprisingly full of energy. \n\nI can praise the staff. Very friendly, happy, and casual yet professional. Never fear, your tacos and margaritas will make it to your table post haste. \n\nThe food was a delicious and satisfying spread that can double as the necessary medicine after a long day. Hot, savory, tasty, and lovely quality. The Taco Tuesday specials are where it's at. $4 house margaritas, a selection of other equally cheap drinks that I'll have to try next time, and $1 tacos ranging from your traditional chicken + pico, to your interesting pork + mango salsa. My Taco Tuesday partner in crime also ordered the beef fajitas. It came out in full force: sizzling pan of beef, peppers, and onions, coupled with a plate of rice, pinto beans, guacamole and sour cream, and completed with a container of warm tortillas. Ask for more and they'll happily replenish those toasty circles of love. Tip: check in on Yelp for a free side of guacamole. It's nature's cream cheese, and Celia makes it oh so creamy and delicious. \n\nThe house margarita (a sexy $4 on Tuesdays until 9pm) was dangerously good. This ain't no Chevy's \"skimp on the good stuff\" margarita. That thang was strong -- in the best way possible. Get it on the rocks with salt, they pop a slice of lime in there and complete the beautiful package with a cactus glass. I had four. I had four. I had four. FOUR. Tuesdays will never be the same. \n\nOverall, it's a comfortable yet lively place with a lovely air of generosity and care about it.

We waited about 40 min.....Margaritas were great but an hour after we ordered we still had not gotten our tacos and other\nitems. When the food finally came, everything was COLD.....not even luke warm. Cold like cold. The waitress who was super busy, asked did we want it reheated. Yes. That would be good. Same platter came back and my friend proceeded to bite into a now luke warm heated up taco, only to bite into something hard. The size of a marble. We concluded it appeared to be something similar to dog kibble. We asked for the manager who tried to convince us it was a piece of avocado pit. Hmmm.  No... I am pretty familiar with avocado pits, that is not one and we're not stupid. More of a deliberate hoax by the kitchen. He took the tacos off the bill but we are now 2 1/2 in and the service, the food and the attitude were a disgrace. Don't have Taco Tuesday if you can't handle the crowd or make decent tacos. It is not rocket science. TBH the large crowds are young people who are there for the margaritas and just need something to soak it up with. They are not there to eat gourmet Mexican cuisine. Too bad, back when their grandfather owned it, in the 70's and 80's, it was authentic Mexican cuisine served with every effort to please the customer.", "author": "Maria S."}

One time we asked them about this and they told us they do that to give time to the kitchen to catch up!\nLast night it happened again, we were waiting for a table even when they had 4 tables available!  my husband asked a waitress if they could give us a table so we could have drinks instead of been standing by at the  hall, even if we have to wait for food, the waitress went to talk to a manager but nothing happen, they keep us waiting. This doesn't make sense, to have people waiting when they have tables available!\nThey either should hire more kitchen help or allow customers to seat even if they alert them they will have to wait for their food a bit, don't they realize they could provide better service and make more money (in drinks) if they manage better this place?", "author": "Araceli L."}

Also, we ordered the Coconut Margarita -- amazing!!! and the Mexican hand stand which was strong but good. We decided to try the ceviche since we're on a ceviche crazed..and it was meh.

Oddly enough, our waitress asked us what we wanted to order before she ever gave us a menu! 10/15 minutes later we finally got menus and who know how much later they took our orders. I had to find the server in an empty restaurant to ask for more chips and salsa and normally we could careless but we felt like we were being ignored. It was comical to the point where we watched a server sit down, have a margarita while we were trying to get chips. Granted, she might have just finished her shift but after we asked for guacamole three times she was the one to serve us. \n\nWhatever, no big deal - service was shit and we caught the staff at a bad time but we didn't care we were there to drink so we ordered what I thought was a mid-range pitcher of margaritas - 38.00 dollars, in the Sunset (no one gave us a menu so we had no idea)... but there was a ton of tequila in it.

But I like that they serve a lot of things that you don't always find, like enchilladas with mole sauce, fish tacos, and something else I am forgetting now.  I also like how they serve their food with coleslaw instead of iceburg lettuce.  Nice change, and very yummy and healthy.  \n\nMy enchilladas verdes was really, really good.  The cheese inside was a lighter cheese--not greasy and heavy like everywhere else I have had cheese enchilladas.  Made it very easy to digest.  The verde sauce was fresh and delicious.  The beans and rice were very tasty as well (and yes you CAN mess up beans & rice).  \n\nThe staff was attentive and friendly.  Although a makeover is needed, there is something really pleasant and satisfying about knowing you've walked into a long-time local establishment, instead of the latest trendy restaurant.  \n\nThey deserve 4 stars.  Maybe I will change it to 5 after I try it a few more times.  I found it to be just a tad on the pricy side, but it beats going all the way to the Mission, and the food is just as good.", "author": "Lizzie R."}

I ordered the enchilada & chile relleno combo, everything was spot on. Exactly what I wanted to eat, rice & beans were so good though my chile relleno was not piping hot, lukewarm only--BOOOOO!!!. I also like that they offer small combo plates for light eaters & monsterous combo plates for the big eaters (they have 2 of these monster combos w/almost one of everything!). Prices are reasonable for a sit down mexican restaurant ($13.50 for my enchilada & chile relleno combo). \nMy dining friends ordered their burrito but added salsa verde to it (for a wet burrito) but adding salsa verde added an extra $1.50 to their burrito--is this common? charging extra for the green sauce?? It was a very hearty size with guac & salsa on top..looked yummy. \n\nWaitress was friendly too.\n\nOverall, I will come back to the place. docked star due to the floor where I sat underneath the booth was dirty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-07", "description": "I have been to Ceila's by the Beach numerous times. They have a great jalapeno margarita and recently improved their food. But tonight I went in and ordered a salad with carne asada. The salad itself was $6.15 and the added meat $5,00, totaling $11.15. It was made clear to my server Jill that this was to be my entree. I was not told when I ordered that the salad was simply a side salad. When it was served on a 6 inch plate with just lettuce and tomato, and a few measly croutons, with a little bit of steak on the top and a tiny ramekin of dressing on the side, I questioned the size of the salad costing $11.15, and which was not described on the menu or by her as a \"side\" salad. I asked if I could get it on a dinner size plate with a little more lettuce and a couple of more slices of tomato. She agreed and said she understood my complaints, but suggested that I would have to talk to a manager. I said that I understood and waited patiently for a manager. He/She did not arrive. Instead Jill came back, stating she had talked to her manager. The only way they could accommodate my request, other than having me order something entirely different on the menu, was for me to pay for 2 dinner salads ($12.30) plus meat ($5.00), totaling $17.30. I questioned this hefty price just to get a little more lettuce, couple of slices of tomato and a bigger plate to eat it on. She said that is what her manager had insisted on so again I would have to wait for him/her to discuss. I would have been more than happy to pay a few extra dollars but not double the price, which seemed ridiculous and Jill seemed to agree. After having asked now twice and waited to see a manager, I declined and left as my patience had run out. Kindly Jill bought me my margarita and that was much appreciated, as my dinner and time at Ceilia's had been ruined by their cheap attitude and failure of the manager to deal with me personally or giving Jill the authority to do what it took to make the customer happy. When I worked in the business giving a larger salad was never a big deal and in fact was encouraged. It was not the money it was the principle. BTW got an amazing large salad, with beans, red peppers, tons of fresh avocado, better salsas and at least twice as much meat La Playa Taqueria down the street for $9.  They even threw in some fresh red peppers at no extra charge. Also Underdogs Taco on Irving has an incredible large steak salad with lots more goodies than Ceilia's sucky salad for a mere $7.75. Furthermore, the manager could not even take the time to initially come by and speak to me, instead sending Jill to do the \"dirty work,\" and give no satisfying alternatives to remedy the situation. For a neighborhood restaurant Ceila's was not very accommodating and cheap! Again, thank you Jill for the comped margarita but would have preferred a little extra lettuce and larger plate.", "author": "Alexandra R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-21", "description": "Six of us enjoyed dinner at Celia's last Sunday.  I like the decor, with the pastel pink and green walls.  The place does not have a modern look, but a spruced up look, maintaining the \"retroness\".  We were promptly served chips and two salsas.  One pitcher of house Margaritas gave each of us a brimming glass, and that was plenty for a toast and a slosh!\n\nMy combo of chicken enchilada verde and pork tamal was huge.  Although the masa on the tamal was a little tough (always the downfall of tamals) the meat inside was really tender and flavorful.  Also with the enchilada, the shredded chicken was delicious and fork tender.  I'm a sucker for refried beans, and mine didn't disappoint! The surprise was the rice; it was extremely delicious, subtly spiced and moist without being clumpy.\n\nMy friends ordered all kinds of things from fish tacos to steak to fajitas, and everyone enjoyed their food.\n\nOur server (I wish I got her name...maybe the manager can deduce who she was based on the date and time, 6pm, and we were in the back dining room) was extremely attentive and friendly.  She regularly checked on us, had our tortilla chips and salsas replenished, made sure we had water, etc.\n\nHave you noticed that what ticks people off most about a restaurant experience (whether it's a fancy place or a neighborhood joint) is the service?  When you have really good service, you overlook some little food gaffes (like the masa!).\n\nWould enjoy a return visit.  Parking isn't as easy as you might expect, this being the outer Sunset, so just take note.\n\nThank you, mystery server!

Being Mexican, I find the food they serve at Celia's insulting. Nothing tasted fresh. Salsa tastes like it came out of a jar, the tortillas clearly come out of a package, the carnitas my son had looked really dry. I had the Chile Relleno and it was incredibly bad: the sauce was runny like watered-down tomato puree and so tasteless, the cheese inside was barely warm not melted, the batter-merengue a Chile Relleno is supposed to be coated with was replaced by what seem to be an omelette wrapped around a California chile; anyone who knows what a Chile Relleno is supposed to be, will tell you that only Poblano peppers are used to make this very simple dish. This is the kind of restaurant that gives Mexican food a bad name. I can assure you that real Mexican cuisine is nothing like this.", "author": "Teresa B."}

So yesterday a friend wanted to try the Sunset restaurant since he heard it was remodeled, it looked nice, clean...we were off to a good start with the greeting/seating when we walked in and pretty much ended there also, we ordered from our waitress and it took about 15 minutes to get my coke and his margarita(and we were the only customers there at 4:30), the food came 20 minutes later, but the food wasn't nothing to write positive reviews for.\n\nWe were having our dinner and not once did anybody come back and ask how we were and if we needed anything, that was disappointing since my buddy wanted to order more...he was hungry but since the waitress didnt ask if we needed anything else while we were eating he didn't order anything more.  All we heard was reggae playing(I like reggae but was expecting latin/mexican music so it through the Mexican vibe out the window) at a Mexican restaurant and just heard the crew talk amongst each  other while we were waiting for someone to check on us, and at the end we just wanted the bill(even though weren't in a rush).   We finally had to ask for the bill and received it, we wanted to pay with credit but 5 minutes in she didn't even come back to process payment, we ended up just leaving cash with a tip(that was the change) even though she didnt deserve one...we just wanted to pay, leave and never come back. \n\n1. service slow, and inattentive (maybe a off day, on the contrary to other reviews saying great servcie, I don't know because we are never going back). There were about 6 employees(including cook) only the 2 customers(us) and not a one of them asked us how we were until we asked for our check which would not have came if we didn't ask for it.\n\n2. food was just ok (nothing to say \"you gotta go to Celias by the Beach and try the Tamale/Enchilada\"), which I had.\n\n3. maybe on a weekend if you want to go the the bar to just drink and have appetizers it will be cool, but to dine-in and expect what a restaurant should be, thumbs down.  You'd be better off going to the mission district and order/pay at a counter, seat yourself, get your own food when it's ready(which would be twice as good for half the price) and you'd get better service then at Celias SF.\n\n4. $40 for 2 dishes and 2 beverages just to have your food delivered to the table. .", "author": "D C."}

One year and five months without those margaritas was quite a drought. I think the kitchen was totally remodeled, and the dining area was refreshed. It looks really great, but it's still the same booths and tables, so don't expect an entire remodel of the dining area. The murals are really lovely. The entryway looks great, the bar area looks nice (new TVs), and the dining area has a fountain with lovely artwork surrounding it. Celia's grandson Phil came to each table and thanked everyone for coming in, which means a lot. There are a few new menu items, including amazing carnitas fajitas with pineapple! It was excellent and a really big portion (lunch the next day). We also had enchiladas with shredded beef -- as good as ever. Service was a little slow, but everyone was extremely friendly - lots of smiles from all the all new wait staff who were dressed in black, well-groomed, and looked sharp.

It is a very festive place, the food has become much better, they have specials (happy hour?), taco Tuesday is a blast and a deal, and it has become a very popular gathering place for the locals. My only concern (and it is really no biggie) is that the wait staff is very green, young, and on every visit there has been a major issue of incompetency that has screwed up our dinner. However we have always had good luck sitting at the bar, as there are a couple of very professional bartenders there...or was.
