Walked in at 7:40 on a Friday with an order for 6 drinks and the barrista whipped all the drinks out fast without giving us grief and they were made nicely. I like that the drinks aren't overly sweet. Peets is much much better than Starbucks and this location isn't an exception. The only thing that caught my attention was that the vanilla cardamom latte didn't really taste like cardamom. But it may just be the amount of spice mixed in that blend. FYI they have soy, coconut, and almond milk sub for milk", "author": "Rou M."}

Everything is pretty much the same, coffee is consistent with other Peet's Coffee and it's not burnt from sitting around too long. It's also a very sociable atmosphere.  It's a much older crowd when I usually stop by here in mornings.  Most people seem to know each other.  I'm upping it to 5 stars b/c I saw one of the employees help one of the patrons out to their car.  I rarely see people go out of their way to help others but this employee did.

I decided to let that one slide. \"So what's today's brew?\"  followed. But of course the response was unintelligible the second time around, besides which merely repeating the Peet's coffee's name without anything descriptive like, \"it's a rich bodied, medium roast which works well with cream and perhaps a tasty snack.\" When it's a really slooow late afternoon/early evening further demonstrates a lack of caring. But aside from these managerial oversights, the WiFi connection there appears problematic. Nevertheless, hearing a staff member's declarative \"It works for me!\" fails to assist. My questioning to have the WiFi's server rebooted was met with its high-up location's description, and nothing more.

When I usually hit up a coffee place I usually get a hot chocolate or when I need it, a decaf mocha. Hey, they say that decaf has a little caffeine in it. All I have to say is that the hot chocolate here sucks. When I order it , it taste like plain milk that is just chocolate colored, not chocolate flavored. I mean obviously when someone orders a hot chocolate over a hot cup of coffee, it's because they want something sweet. Nope, I do not get that here. I'm not even sure how the barrista got the milk chocolate colored without it even being chocolate flavored, I guess she didn't put enough chocolate syrup/powder (not even sure which one they use) in it? The last time the bf and I came here, he ordered his coffee and was enjoying it all the way down to the bottom and when he got to the bottom he had a whole mouthful of coffee grounds. YUCK! What a disappointment to a good cup of coffee. Oh, and whats up with the coffee cups being messy. We always get handed our drinks with coffee spills all along the side. Those messy barristas. The service here is slow and not friendly at all. I swear the last time I came here the bf and I ordered our drinks and like the different people that were behind us in line got their drinks before us and there was only one barrista making the coffee. What's up with that? Why do you ask do we keep coming back? We have a friend who is a a coffee snob and only likes Peet's coffee and I don't really thinks he cares about the service. So, every time we are out with him he only wants to go to our local Peet's. Don't you think half of the whole experience of going to your local coffee place is for the barristas/service? Now I will just go there with the bf and friend and just not order anything. For the service and the bad tasting hot chocolate, I can just go home and make a better hot chocolate.", "author": "carebear l."}

I ordered 2 kids hot chocolates and 1 small (regular size) hot chocolate.  When I got the drinks, I'd have to say that the kids hot chocolates were about 1/4 cup full with hot chocolate and another 1/4 of it was filled with whipped cream on top making the cup 1/2 full.  My regular size hot chocolate was about 1/2 filled with hot chocolate and 1/4 filled with whipped cream.  Kids took two sips each and they were finished.  What a rip off.  To top it off, it didn't even taste like hot chocolate!!  Tasted like water with a hint of cocoa flavoring!  Total rip off.  Economy is bad but this is ridiculous!  Never again will I go to this Pete's Coffee!", "author": "Suzy W."}

(Not a good sign!) I was crossing the street when I realized he missed the shot of Vanilla but I just couldn't be bothered going back. PEETS is usually pretty reliable but for $4 coffee the quality has to be consistently high and unfortunately on this visit it was disappointing.", "author": "David W."}

It's happened in Palo Alto, and now it's happening in Half Moon Bay.  I believe in free market, but this is a different story: They seek out a successful coffee shop, and then wrestle it away.  They effectively steal the business goodwill and customer base.  Peets is now on my boycott list.", "author": "Oliver K."}
