While these two might be your original target, let Eiji be your new destination.\n\nVery small and intimate- the focus here is on the revolving daily specials and fresh nigiri. This is not where you come to eat rolls. I repeat, this is not a rolls spot. \n\nNo photos, but we had tried a large assortment of nigiri, some hot dishes, two of the three tofu, and ended with a mochi dessert. The tofu plates were surprisingly big/filling, not sure if I would get two away because it got a little repetitive eating that much tofu. All the nigiri was delicious- nice fatty pieces on top of well seasoned sushi rice. \n\nThe mochi dessert, fried and coated with cinnamon, was the perfect ending to dinner.\n\nOverall, the bill (before tip) was under 200 for three individuals trying a LOT. The assortment and dishes we ordered made it feel like I had Omakase. \n\nDefinitely another sushi spot with going to, that is on the cheaper side of the high end sushi spots in the city (lol, that under 200 is cheap in SF).", "author": "Arezou A."}

Came here late last Saturday evening with my date (about 30min before closing). There were only a few other parties in the small restaurant. Being newly in love, my man and I wanted to sit next to each other, so we asked to sit at a four-top, but were told we could not and had to sit at a two top across from each other. Ok...we ordered appetizers first (which never arrived), and then ordered our meal. \n\nAt this point one employee came over and placed a RESERVED sign on the four top next to us. Seeing as there was a bench seat on one side, my guy came over to sit next to me while we waited for the food. *Let me be perfectly clear...we were holding hands and he had his arm around me. We were not making out or offending the few other customers in any way.* We were immediately approached by a different employee telling us to not sit this way, then when we protested and wanted to know why he said that when the food came he would have to move to sit across from me. We reluctantly agreed. Then we get approached AGAIN (by the chef I believe) saying we would have to sit across from each other because \"that is the rules and if I let you sit this way and not others they will ask why they can't and you can.\" By this time, one other couple is overhearing all of the goings on and the woman is giggling at the seeming absurdity. We did move and finished our meal, but really should have immediately left. Had we not been starved and it not been so late we would have left. When the other couple left, the man jokingly told us to enjoy the rest of our evening and joked about how ashamed we should be for wanting to sit together. By the time we finished the meal we were the only people left in the restaurant. \nThe food was fresh but just ok. Bones in the baked miso cod, yellowtail so-so and not smooth in texture...\nThe cold sake pour was ceremonial and generous...if only the rest of their hospitality had been like the sake...we will NEVER eat here again.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

I think they have only 1-2 tables that seat four people and the rest of the tables are for groups of 2. I came on a Thursday night at 7PM and there was no wait.\n\nReally enjoyed the tuna belly steak! I've never had anything like that before. It was so light yet filled with tuna flavor. You get an entire plate of it and easily is an entree on its own if you just order a side of rice.\n\nAlso ordered\n+Ankake tofu: I really liked this! it was soft and silken and delicious. It comes with a sauce that I'm not sure what it is but similar to a thicker, sweet soy sauce, and it pairs well with the tofu. You gotta proportion it well though because sometimes I'd scoop too little tofu and too much sauce and that wasn't as enjoyable.\n+Sea bream: tasted fresh\n+Tuna belly w/green onion: initially thought it was going to be served like nigiri but got maki, so it was a bit of a let down\n+Uni: tasted fresh but it was a little watery. Uni is my favorite so this was a bit of a disappointment\n+Fresh strawberry in mochi: so good! loved it!\n\nOverall, loved this place! Probably will order their other specialty tofu next time, tuna belly steak, and try some of their rolls or sashimi. Also, huge surprise when the bill came out to a little over $60 for all this food.\n\nOh they do this extra charge if you pay with credit card, so bring cash if you wanna avoid that minor charge.", "author": "Mimi T."}

Over the last seven years I've really enjoyed eating here and have always been blown away by everything I've tried and it's quality for the price. At one point I was going so often they started to treat my wife and I very well and we would always make a note to say thanks to the chef and tip well for the extra love.\n\nHaving two new kids, we haven't been eating there as much as we'd like but we did order out when they were doing it often and came in with my son for his first sushi. He loved it but...\n\nThey don't appear to appreciate kids :( Tonight my wife and two children went in and we decided to leave. There were two other tables being served. My wife breastfed my daughter and it seemed to visibly upset the chef this was happening. They didn't say anything but we felt uncomfortable. My son later started to get bored so I put on a Netflix show (sound off) on my phone and the waitress came over and said he can't watch tv in the restaurant. Only a few weeks earlier my son and I had eaten there and he watched a show on my phone. Was really awkward so I left with my son and my wife asked for a to go box which they awkwardly watched as she put each piece in the box and paid the bill. :(", "author": "Scott B."}

If you know Japanese food, then you know this place has it right. If you're looking for big-portioned deep fried sushi rolls or I don't know... a place where the service is better than the food, then don't come here. Come here to satiate your delicate palate, fulfill your cravings for freshness. \n\nOboro Tofu. It is not \"just\" tofu. Come on people, making tofu is a process. You gotta soak the soybeans, squeeze out the \"milk\", coagulate it... there is a difference between fresh tofu and tofu from the plastic containers. Here at Eiji, it is the former. Fresh as can be, made to order. No extra chemicals or preservatives, just freshly made tofu. The shoyu they give you to add to the tofu is not any old shoyu, it is lighter, more delicate and complimentary of the tofu and toppings. \n\nAll of the fish served as either sushi or sashimi is fresh af. Enough said. \n\nThe broiled miso black cod is to die for. To die for. Perfectly cooked. It is very easy to overcook this dish, and I've had many that were overcooked. The way they do it here is just flawless. \n\nGet the gyoza. \n\nThis place is worth it. It's not cheap, but it's worth it.", "author": "Anthony G."}

I've also gotten the mapo tofu to start with, which they prepare in a traditional setting right in front of you on a burner. they bring the tofu soup to you with other goodies (veggies, spices, sauces) and you can customize your own bowl of soup! it's so fun and soooo delicious! I shared this with my partner. it makes me smile thinking of enjoying this soup with someone I love! \n\nthis is totally the type of place where you can get practically anything that they have on special (board above the bar) and it will be so yummy. last time we came in, we got the black miso cod.

Food and drinks were served in a timely manner. \n\nFood: my friend and I both ordered the sashimi lunch - the salmon sashimi was smooth like silk butter. It was my favorite out of the sashimi & very delicious. The sashimi lunch came with 3 tuna, 2 salmon, & 2 amberjack. We also ordered the tamago, kampyo (squash) maki roll, and negi-hama (hamachi w/scallion) roll. \n\nThe kampyo roll was interesting - the texture of the squash was chewy and tasted pretty sweet. The Negi-Hama roll was very light and you can't taste the hamachi really. \n\nAmbience: super small place so it can get pretty packed when the tables are filled. When there's less people, it can feel like you're shouting (if in a group) so at first, I felt like I had to whisper. Once the tables started to feel, I felt more comfortable to talk at a \"normal\" volume. \n\nPrice wise: I thought it was pretty pricey overall, but you're paying for the quality here so I was A-OK with that!", "author": "Cheri C."}

They have a lot of desserts offered too that you don't typically see either, like sakura mochi and kyoto style mochi ice cream!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-11", "description": "I learned about this Japanese restaurant from fellow Yelper B.B. many years ago, and since then I have kept this place in mind whenever I visit the City. One evening Santi and I decided to stop by for dinner, and the overall experience was everything B.B. had described. \n\nBy all measures, the restaurant was tiny, with a handful of small tables in a quiet surrounding parsimoniously decorated. The serene ambiance was what I expected in a traditional Japanese restaurant that takes their food seriously. Service was warm and mild mannered. From the restaurant's composition to the dishes that arrived at our table, each profile and finishing touch was illuminating and purposeful. \n\nThe homemade Oboro Tofu ($9.75) was served in a pot filled with silken tofu slightly breaking from its light broth. The tofu was made to order, and we were given a set of garnishes that included sesame seeds, scallions, fresh and pickled ginger, shaved bonito flakes, shiso leaf and soy sauce to season at the table. I wished the consistency of the silken tofu was thicker, but it was still a delicious starter to warm the stomach and open the taste bud. \n\nThe Yosenabe ($19.50) arrived boiling hot and filled with assorted seafood, shellfish, and vegetables in a broth lightly seasoned. The centrality of the seafood was influential and nuanced in the delicious broth. It had all the right profiles that left me wanting more.\n\nThe Chirashi ($20.75) came in a small bowl layered with nine different kinds of seafood such as salmon, tuna, yellowtail, red snapper, salmon roe, octopus, white fish, cooked shrimp, mackerel, and steamed eggs served on sushi rice. The fish was fresh with great flavors and colors, and the sushi rice was memorable too.\n\nThe homemade Kuri Daifuku ($3.50) came with a soft mochi with a good chew, and a layer of sweet azuki beans surrounding whole chestnut in the middle for a complete profile and texture. The kuri was easy to bite into and the composition was just sweet enough to accompany our hot tea. Despite the feast, we wished we had room to try their Strawberry Daifuku. \n\nThe experience was worthwhile, and we were very pleased with the amount of delicate flavors to illustrate a different, and probably more traditional, vantage point on the cuisine. Interested diners should come early to avoid a wait. I hope to eventually return to try their Okra Beef, Ikura Oroshi, Misonabe, Aji, Uni, Negitoro, and Strawberry Daifuku.", "author": "Daniel L."}

The service is professional and the food is traditional and satisfying.\n\nMy friend and I each got a chirashi, I also got an order of the kohada nigiri, and we split the house-made oboro tofu. The chirashi was a decent size at a decent price. The tamago, hamachi, and ikura were both above average .The rest of the fish were average in terms of freshness. The rice had good texture and the flavoring was a little light but still noticeable. Nothing particularly noteworthy but a solid chirashi bowl. (3.5/5)\n\nThe kohada nigiri was lightly pickled and quite fresh. The skin was slightly scored and I'm glad I ordered it as a little add on to my meal. It's nothing particularly special but I love kohada. (4/5)\n\nThe oboro tofu was definitely the star of the meal. It is a wonderful and delicate dish and you can really taste how fresh it is.

The prices are cheap for sushi ($15 for a 7piece + roll nigiri lunch!) and the homecooked offerings are what you'd find in an unremarkable mom and pop shop in a small city in Japan. \n\nThat said, there are a few downsides to watch out for: the space can smell a little damp and fishy (they ought to leave the doors and windows open more!) and while the freshness of the fish exceeds the value most of the time, there are some days when the sushi just isn't fresh. They need to have more stringent quality control, because it can vary a lot day by day and be a bit of a gamble, but most of the time you walk out feeling like: dang, that fresh sushi meal was only $20!

This popped up so decided to check it out considering the overall 4 stars out of almost 950 reviews. Was surprised, it was a small shop. Wasn't too busy when we went, we got seated almost right away and our waiter was very friendly. I was disappointed in the lack of sushi choices. I just got one order of salmon roll. There was a minimum charge for credit card, so my friend had to change his order to something a bit more pricey. One of the ladies who work there suggested the tuna steak, so my friend decided to try it. It was actually very hard for the both of us to eat, had to drink a lot of water after each bite for me to even try to eat it. I can't describe the taste but it tasted a bit too fishy and wasn't what I expected.", "author": "Elizabeth L."}

The restaurant is small and very authentic; all the waiters/waitresses were Japanese and spoke Japanese to each other. Things we ordered:\n\nOboro Tofu: 3/5 - cooked fresh from liquid form and comes with a bunch of toppings like ginger, green onion, bonito flakes, etc. The main reason this was my least favorite is because it was very simple plain tofu with inexpensive garnishes. I didn't think it should cost $10.\n\nAlaskan Roll: 4/5 - this was a 6 piece salmon avocado roll. It was a good portion and tasty. Solid order, no surprises.\n\nYosenabe: 5/5 - a delicious pot of yumminess cooked in bonito broth! They somehow nailed the cooking temperature of the seafood in the dish. The fish, shrimp, mussels and squid were cooked perfectly! It was also a very generous portion of meat and pretty much filled the entire pot. Additionally, there was lots of napa and some mushrooms.\n\nHomemade Strawberry Mochi: 5/5 - omg one of the best desserts ever. I think I'd come back just to eat my own one of this. They have the genius idea of wrapping mochi and red bean around a real fresh piece of strawberry. It's really good, highly recommended!\n\nService was friendly and the tea here was great. It's 4 stars mainly because I was not impressed by the tofu but everything else was awesome. I'd like to come back soon!", "author": "Sophia H."}

Come dinner time, I was 20 minutes late due to traffic (and starving- as usual). Lesson learned, your reservation will expire after 15 minutes and you're back to the end of the line. Be on time since they don't seat you until everyone in your party has arrived! \n\nLuckily friend and I were here around a time that there wasn't a massive line, so we only had to wait 30 minutes extra for a table. After rubber necking (politely), looking at everyone's delicious food and studying the menu for a bit, we got seated at the bar.\n\nWe ordered/shared the nigiri chef's choice, seaweed salad, and an ichigo daifuku (strawberry mochi). We also ordered a spicy tuna roll and ume shiso (not on the menu but I always ask for it anyway)s.\n\nThe sushi here is some of the best I've had in San Francisco. So good, that I came back Sunday night in the same week. I'm typically annoyed and disappointed when it comes to sushi in this city because it's so subpar. Eiji fills the void (of Shiro's/most sushi in Seattle, a baby step behind but delicious nonetheless).\n---\n\nSecond time around, ordered the oboro tofu, okra beef, ume shiso, and ichigo-daifuku (strawberry mochi). It's probably the BEST I've had in a very long time. \n\nThe oboro tofu is a MUST try. It has a slight \"nutty\" flavor when eaten on its own which I really enjoyed but the full deliciousness was with all the extras and the tamari soy sauce. I could probably eat this dish all on my own, shamelessly. \n\nWell, all you need to know is: \n\n1. Be on time with your full party\n2.

On that Saturday, when I arrived with my bf and two friends, we were told that there was no reservation under my name. WHAT!? This has also happened to my friend. She once made a reservation only for them to not have it when she arrived. Now, whenever she dines in... she calls three times to confirm her reservation. So frustrating! \n\nLuckily, after waiting about 20 minutes, they had a table for us. Weirdly enough, the table had a \"reserved\" sign on it the whole time we were waiting outside and then they finally seated us at the table. Could this have been the table that I had made my reservation for? No one will ever know.\n\nAfter the reservation debacle, we were hungry bears. I needed to carbo load because I was going to run the Nike Women's Half Marathon the next day. We enjoyed their appetizers. I can't remember what we had exactly but I know it was tasty. The sushi was delicious. Loved the scallop, the uni, and the aji. We had ordered it initially and then we ordered another round of our faves. The four of us were stuffed and very happy. For dessert, we each wanted the strawberry mochi but they only had two left. They did have chestnut mochi so we all shared the strawberries and the chestnuts. Be sure to order the mochi with the rest of your food because they do sell out. \n\nThe experience is very authentic and I loved the food. My friend, who grew up in Tokyo, has stated that Eiji is her favorite Japanese restaurant in the city. I can see why! The restaurant is easy to find and lots of Ubers around for easy accessibility.

There are 3 dessert items that are homemade: \nStrawberry mochi --SO good. The gigantic, \"on steroids\" strawberry had a thin layer of red bean paste, followed by the delicate mochi. This was flavourful and refreshing.\nPurple Yam Cake -- Not too sweet, nice texture, I liked it!  My second favourite.\nIce cream crepe -- vanilla and green tea ice cream inside of a thin crepe. This was good, but not as special as the above two.\n\nThe extra star was really for the dessert. I'd go back just for the strawberry mochi!", "author": "Colene C."}

We were a party of four and comfortably seated in this very small restaurant. Our waiter was attentive and quick to understand what we wanted. The house prepared tofu was extra special, soft and tasty, garnishes were good too. We shared a large bowl but I would have happily eaten it all myself. We also shared two veggie dishes, one eggplant and one spinach, both excellent. Then a variety of sushi followed- absolute perfection! As if we hadn't had enough, we sampled two desserts. The strawberry mochi and the mocha Kyoto style were both delightful. Accompanying all this we had a variety of drinks, hot and cold saki and beer. We left full and happy and already planning our next visit. Thank you!", "author": "Gloria R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-08-15", "description": "Hype.\n\nMost of us succumb to it. I will gladly admit that I can be the #1 offender when it comes to hype. As soon as I hear about a new \"it\" place, I just have to go. Like a mad woman, I do my research to try to secure reservations. I once went as far as finding the co-owner's number of a new restaurant to secure reservation for their soft opening. SO you best believe, if I ever thought my significant other was creeping on me, I would be lurking in the bushes with an industrial pair of scissors. *Snip Snip* Muaahhaaahaaaa. I'm kidding... \n\nEiji is not a new \"it\" restaurant but it's supposedly the \"it\" place to get tofu. With all the stellar reviews, we expected to have the BEST tofu of our lives. Mmmm, maybe we needed more sake. Ok, more on that later.\n\nFirst things first, you need reservations to eat at Eiji. We saw people get turned away who didn't have reservations and the place wasn't even full. Eiji is small and fits about 25 people. There's no sushi bar which I find odd for a Japanese place that also is a \"sushi bar\". Parking is terrible in the area because it's a residential area so allot an extra 15-20 minutes for finding street parking. There's no nearby parking lots. \n\nMy gf and I normally opt for omakase at Japanese restaurants but they don't offer it here so we stuck with the highlighted items on Yelp. Eiji is not a place I would recommend for good sushi as I found it very mediocre especially for the price point and they have a VERY limited fish selection. For hardcore sushi lovers, I recommend Ino (purists), Okina (cheap and simple) or Akiko (if you have a sugar daddy). \n\nOUR ORDER:\n*Miso Black Cod - $13: http://bit.ly/1cFXoAe\n*Deluxe Sashimi (Maguro, Sake, Hirame, Amber Jack, Hamachi & Toro) - $27.75: http://bit.ly/14Cc5tY\n*Sake Salmon - $5.25: http://bit.ly/1eMzsqE\n*Amaebi Sweet Shrimp - $8: http://bit.ly/1dauNRk\n*Uni Sea Urchin - $8.50: http://bit.ly/17PTBZ8\n*Ceviche Roll - $8.25: http://bit.ly/1eMzvm7\n*Negi Toro Roll - $11: http://bit.ly/1cFXMhZ\n*Ankimo Monkfish Liver - $9.25: http://bit.ly/1eMzD5b\n*Oboro Tofu - $9.25: http://bit.ly/1cQca6G\n*Strawberry Mochi - $5.50 for a pair: http://bit.ly/15JtDEV\n\nI generally despise cooked fish but black cod is an exception because I love the buttery delicateness. I would have enjoyed the miso black cod more if I didn't have to pick out bones from my mouth with each bite. Tsk tsk, that shouldn't have happened especially when you're paying $13 for a small portion. \n\nNothing noteworthy about the ankimo, sashimi, nigiri, or rolls we had other than it's overpriced for the quality you get. I will say that were very disappointed about the ceviche roll that others raved about. Not sure what's to rave about salsa and rice because that's exactly what it tasted like. And, what's up with not serving the amaebi heads? A good sushi joint, will always prepare the heads either fried or in a miso soup. \n\nAs for the oboro tofu, I do love the concept that it's made to order but it was nothing special. It was just warm tofu served with condiments (sesame seeds, ginger, scallions, etc). It's bland so you have to add soy sauce to taste. Maybe we got a bad batch but it wasn't even silky and just disappointing all together. *Sigh*\n\nThe best part of the meal was the strawberry mochi which is limited at one per a person. A deliciously plump strawberry encased in a thin layer of sweet azuki and then wrapped with glutinous rice with a lovely toothsome chew. I could of eaten a whole tray of these bad boys and did without the rest of our order. \n\nService was very polite and somewhat attentive. \n\nHmmm...what else...\n\nIt took me nearly 4 months just to write this review because there was nothing really to say about Eiji other than it's overhyped and overrated. That is all.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I loved the tamago in it, and the ikura was not too salty for my taste. \n\nAnd lastly, we had to try the strawberry mochi, for which they are known. And it definitely lived up to the hype.

Their uni was good, however, traditional servings of fish in the form of maki, sashimi or salmon may be better tried at other restaurants. This place shines in their unique interpretation of more common (at least common to Japanese people who don't eat sushi every day) dishes such as spinach with miso, eggplant and certain main dishes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-27", "description": "A truly magical Eiji experience is composed of two periods: before dessert and after dessert. Make sure you enjoy both, so pre-order dessert when you arrive, as they do run of out of desserts. \n\nBefore dessert, you can feast on many delicious things. The Oboro Tofu features a large bowl of hot tofu in a light broth, with a set of accompanying toppings. While I enjoyed the spicy radish and minced ginger, I ended up eating most of the soft, creamy tofu without any toppings. The Eggplant with Walnut Miso was out of this world. The Walnut Miso was hot, creamy, and had walnut slivers layered throughout. Eiji offers mostly traditional rolls, but their Ceviche Roll (hamachi with homemade salsa) is non-traditional and tastes like a sushi taco!\n\nYou pre-ordered dessert, so now things are going to the next level. The Strawberry Mochi has an actual strawberry inside it, wrapped in a layer of red bean paste and soft sticky rice cake. The Purple Sweet Potato Yokan features a subdued sweet purple yam cake topped with some rich vanilla ice cream on top. Every bite was wonderful; the cake was firm, yet melted in your mouth along with the ice cream.\n\nYou really can't go wrong at Eiji. Everything we tried was fresh, prepared well, and thoroughly enjoyable. To boot, unlike other great sushi restaurants that sometimes have snobby service, Eiji has a friendly staff that is always helpful if you need some recommendations or don't know what a particular item is.", "author": "Mark C."}

Again not sure why she would take out food back especially if we asked her to leave it.\n\nThen the chef (owner?) kept coming out and staring at people. Then he yelled across the restaurant at a customer who was taking too long to decide on her to go order.

The fish was fresh and had perfect texture. The sushi lunch ($13) was also good, but I prefer sashimi because you can focus on the fish. \n\nThe oboru tofu ($8.75) was yummy but a bit pricey. The texture reminded me a bit of Taiwanese xian do jang where the vinegar makes soy milk curdle, very tender. Oboru tofu doesn't have any vinegar in it so it is much milder. Loved the bonito flakes and ginger toppings. I have no idea what this dish is supposed to taste like, so it might be perfect and authentic. That said, I wished there was a tad bit more tofu flavor to it. \n\nAmaebi ($8) was expensive but usually is. Will probably just get the sashimi lunch next time for the best value.

This is a tiny hole in the wall restaurant, and you'd probably miss it if you weren't looking for it. They have several specialties here including house made tofu and strawberry mochi. After about a 30 minute wait on a Friday, we were seated at the bar -- convenient for watching how the tofu was prepared! \n\nThe homemade tofu (oboro tufisn't the silky kind; in fact, it has more of a grainy texture, but it still tasted quite good. At least there's no GMOs in this, I hope! It also came with a bunch of garnishments/toppings including green onions, ginger, soy sauce, sesame seeds, dried bonito flakes, and more. It was fun mixing and matching different toppings to see how the taste changed. I've never experienced a more fun and interesting way of eating tofu. The serving is rather large though -- good for two or three people. \n\nThe clam miso soup is really just that -- miso soup with clams inside. I'm not sure if they actually boiled the miso soup with the clam, because the miso soup didn't taste very different from ordinary soup. There was not much clam flavor that had transferred. Probably wouldn't order this again. There are other variations of miso soup that I'd try. \n\nWe also tried the black cod with miso sauce -- can't really go wrong with this dish, and it was just as good as expected. The skin was very nicely charred, and the fish was almost melt in your mouth. Another dish we ordered off the specialty menu was the sardine sashimi, which was something I've never tried before. The fish was extremely fresh and you could take a clean bite out of it without bits of fiber hanging onto the fish...A+!!\n\nFor dessert, we tried the yam cake and the strawberry mochi. Be sure to order the mochi at the beginning, because they do run out! The yam cake was not as flavorful as I thought it would be as there was only a light yam flavor. but the color and texture were definitely reminiscent of yam. It wasn't very sweet at all...a bit bland actually. I probably wouldn't order this again, but would order the strawberry mochi over and over again.

Read up the reviews and excited to try something different. I ordered the oboro tofu, Salmon skin salad, Ohitashi (boiled spinach with ohitashi sauce). The salmon skin salad was different, as it was wrapped with a cured daikon peel. I thought the ohitashi was meh, didn't jump out at me. Maybe I should have asked more questions before I ordered that one. The oboro tofu was their signature dish. This dish separates itself from other sushi joint. They cook it right before you. It's very similar to the Chinese dessert (sweet tofu dessert - \u8c46\u8150\u82b1). It was served with an array of toppings (sesame seed, ginger, green scallions, onions, spicy daikon, etc). Again, it was different, but taste wise, it didn't make me jump out of my seat. \n\nLastly, we heard about the out-of-the-world strawberry mochi, and came to try it. It was good, but can definitely try to make it at home kind of dessert. We also tried the mango and red bean mochi ice cream. Didn't do it for me since I felt like it was store bought. Nothing special for me.\n\nThere are few things worthing mentioning about this place. Your full party has to be all present before they seat you (even the restaurant was empty when we got there). Your kids will be asked nicely to turn off any video games (on phone or any device) when seated which I thought was pretty awesome. Sashimi is definitely not the best here. Though the fish is high quality (very fresh), but the skills of cutting of the fish still needs to be perfected.\n\nThis place is charming and unpretentious. Not good for big parties, and not your usual sushi place. If you want to try some authentic traditional Japanese food, it's worth it.", "author": "Em T."}

I am rarely at a loss for words, but I literally was so shocked I could only stare open-mouthed at the restaurant staff.\n\nFirst of all, I get that restaurants want the whole party to be there before they seat you.  My friend, who was starving, got there first, wanted to sit and order and eat first since I was on my way there, but they refused to seat her.  Fine, whatever.\n\nWe received our food, which is very good and fresh, and our other friend told us that she was on her way to meet us and asked us to get her some stuff to-go so she could eat it en route to a charity spin class at SoulCycle.  We placed the order with our waitress as we were eating.\n\nWhile we were waiting for our to-go order and dessert, our friend arrived and kind of hovered over my chair.  Not wanting to block the path of the waitress, she shared the bench seat with my friend, but one of the chefs (maybe the owner?) immediately STORMED OVER and pointed to her and said \"YOU CANNOT SIT THERE.\"\n\nShocked, my friend said, \"Oh, she's not eating here - we're just waiting for the to-go order.  We already finished eating.\"\n\nAngry Chef continued to RAIL on our friend, telling her she was NOT ALLOWED to sit there and said, word for word, \"GO STAND OUTSIDE\" while pointing to the door.\n\nOur friend picked up her bag and went outside, and Angry Chef stormed back into the kitchen.  My dining companion and I, along with the guys at the next table, were stunned.  I heard one of the guys tell his friend, \"Ummmm they just kicked that girl out!\" before giving me a wide-eyed, almost apologetic look.\n\nA busboy came by to wipe our EMPTY table, and we told him we wanted the check and just to get out.  At this point we didn't even care if they'd made our friend's to-go order.\n\nThe busboy, who clearly had to have witnessed everything because the restaurant is very small, said, \"Oh you still have food coming.\"\n\nMy friend responded with, \"Yes but we don't want it anymore.  That was very uncomfortable.\"\n\nI told him to cancel our order, and just bring the check.  He responded with, \"Ok so you want me to cancel the order.  Ok.\"\n\nNo apology from our waitress or the busboy, who ended up bringing our to-go order.\n\nI rarely, RARELY ever leave zero tip for anyone, but this time we left a big fat zero.\n\nUnacceptable.  Absolutely horrendous service.  Never have I ever been so embarrassed at a meal, and I will never come back ever again nor will I ever recommend this place.", "author": "Tori S."}

When a dessert is the highlight of a Japanese restaurant, it definitely won't bring upon a return visit.  \n\nThe food wasn't horrible...but, it wasn't great either.  We started off with okra beef...it was rather salty and definitely something that could be put together at home...not much flavor.  \n\nWe then moved on to a large order of sashimi...the fish was fresh...but nothing wowed me.  The cuts were nice...not extremely generous...but big enough that it was worth the price.  \n\nNext, an order of uni.  Ok, the uni was wham bam thank you ma'am.  Super super fresh...and plentiful.  It melted in my mouth and had to refrain myself from ordering more.  Definitely the highlight of our dinner...\n\nAnd for our last item, we ordered the chirashi.  Meh, I've had way better...nothing was special about it...it actually tasted a bit amateur...if that makes sense. \n\nAnd then dessert...we ordered the sweet yam thing with ice cream which really wasn't anything special either.  I felt like I was eating purple jello with a scoop of ice cream on top.  Eh...not so much. \n\nThe strawberry mochi was all that and a bag of chips though...the red bean accented it perfectly.  The mochi was soft...the strawberry was sweet.  Too bad they don't allow their desserts to-go.\n\nThe service was good...I watched her make the tofu dishes from scratch while testing it on her wrist.  \n\nOverall, it was just a 3 star experience.

The food is good, but the service was left to be desired.  \n\nFor those that are first timers, understand that this restaurant has 11 tables (10 tables for 2 and 1 \"bar\" table for 4).  That means only 24 people can dine comfortably.  Surprisingly, they accept reservations for such a small restaurant.  This is where our caveat with the restaurant intersects.  \n\nWe are a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids).  Understanding that the kids are young, means we can't stay out late.  When we arrived to the restaurant around 7:00pm with the intention to sit and eat, we noticed that 4 of the 11 tables were reserved.  The hostess/waitress had told us that it would be an hour or more wait.  Fine, no problem there.  We decided that we would order \"to go\".\n\nUpon our departure at 8:30pm, we noticed STILL that the table reserved for 4 was STILL awaiting it's patrons, an hour and a half later.  I'm pretty sure that most people won't take more than an hour and half to enjoy a meal at their own pace.  We were not alone on this one, with other patrons waiting to be seated outside.  \n\nMy suggestion to the owners, is that you shouldn't have table reservations under 6 patrons, that is if you would like to increase your business revenue.  \n\nMy suggestion to potential diners, get their early or book a reservation.  Apparently they will hold it all night for you.  \n\nI gave 2 stars because the food is good, but that doesn't make a good dining experience, especially if you trek across town to be there.", "author": "Kevin L."}

Similar to the misoyaki butterfish that I used to eat back home, but tastier. \n\nI would recommend this place. Only thing was that its a small place and we had to wait for a table, but it was a good experience.", "author": "Kenson K."}

We had seaweed salad and fresh yellow tail and salmon sashimi to start (it was another melt-in-your mouth Experience). Then we tried Oboro tofu, smooth and silky. Delish! If you're the salt-and-pepper-right-away person, give this a chance and eat this first, as it has a light subtle sweetness to it.

Only one strawberry mochi is allowed per person, so savor it while it lasts.\n\nI had the caterpillar roll and the spicy tuna roll for my dinner here, but it wasn't anything spectacular.

It reminded me a lot of the small and intimate dining experiences I had in Tokyo a few years back.\n\nFirst, we started with seaweed salad, which was some of the best I've ever had.  We followed that with the famed Oboro tofu.  I personally love it, but it served in a soup like form (i.e. not fried tofu), so just know that before you order.\n\nThe sushi roles that we ordered (Rainbow, Alaska, and Poke Roles).  Personally I liked the lighter Alaska and Poke rolls better, but the rainbow role was bright and fresh as well.\n\nLast, but certainly not least, was the strawberry mochi!  The cold, sweet dessert was the perfect cap to the night.

Calming place, and the hot hand towels were a nice touch.\n\nWe started with the oboro tofu, which is basically tofu in cloud form that they make in a cute nabe on the side. It made me think of chawan mushi, but not eggtastic obviously. Light broken custard with pinches of condiments: shiso, negi, sesame seeds, daikon, ginger, and bonito flakes.

My husband and I decided to try it out for lunch while they weren't as busy.\n\nWe decided to try a few of the more popular items; the house special tofu, the $13 assorted lunch special sushi and cooked tuna belly. We also split the miso that came with one of the entree's as well as getting the house special miso with assorted fish and seafood.\n\nWe received the two miso soups first. The regular miso was perfect, not too salty and the house special one was a delicious creamy miso broth with different fish and seafood in it. I could have definetly gone for seconds! The tuna belly came out first, it was a satisfying 4 pieces on top of a bed of greens. The tuna belly was cooked but not chewy and the maranade was delcious. After came the house special tofu, which was a soft steamed tofu in broth. They gave us a little tray of condiments to put into and it was very light and had a unique but mild flavor. Lastly, we split the assorted sushi which was all raw, accept for the once peice of masago. The sushi was definetly fresh tasting and not fishy or slimy and it was a good size for two people to split.\n\nFor dessert we decided to try the little Tokyo style crepes with cinnamon and vanilla and green tea ice cream and a side of red bean sauce. We also got one fresh strawberry mochi to try. I enjoyed the big whole strawberry inside but wish there had been a thicker mochi layer of mochi around it, especially for $3 bucks a peice. Both desserts where good though.\n\nI can't believe I had never noticed up until I was actually in the area. I hoghly recommend coming here during lunch (thier not open very late anyway) and just splitting a bunch of appetizers and sushi. I would recommend that pork belly even as a good sized dish on its own for one, in addition to a sushi roll and some miso. Don't forget to try the strawberry mochi!", "author": "Petra S."}

Eiji is a perfect example of meticulous subtlety that results in some mighty delicious meals.\n\nBlink and you might miss it, Eiji is a tiny place. Thankfully the flags outside proudly proclaim what they do best - sushi and tofu. Having been shunned twice before, we made reservations a couple of days in advance. I highly recommend calling ahead. \n\nWe started with salmon sashimi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-zetzVfO4X0dpiiTmjdeKg?select=qzimN5mp6wHgBoLdjLIKjA) and wow! It's just up there in terms of the best fish I've put in my mouth. Incredibly fresh and perfectly sliced, it was almost a sin to dip it in soy and wasabi. So satisfying!\n\nNext up was the famous Oboro tofu. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-zetzVfO4X0dpiiTmjdeKg?select=tTO9PgdiL0GtrCKVH-20nA) It reminds me of Chinese bean-curd but much lighter. It almost had an ethereal feel to it as the cloud-like tofu floated gently in the broth. Add some soy, sesame seeds, scallion, ginger, and other condiments, and it was a very soul-warming dish. I especially loved the hints of ginger after each mouthful. \n\nWe split salmon and poke rolls plus some salmon, white tuna, yellow tail nigiri. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-zetzVfO4X0dpiiTmjdeKg?select=sZnPI4Wf4Y0PKCicmalVyw) Just like the sashimi before, they were just perfect. Fresh fish well prepared combined with rice that was cooked to perfection. \n\nNow maybe I wasn't paying attention when other Yelpers raved about the strawberry mochi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-zetzVfO4X0dpiiTmjdeKg?select=hnnH-M0IZBc3fAgigxMwdw) but I thought, \"how special can a mochi-wrapped strawberry be?\" The surprising answer is with red bean paste sandwiched between, pretty darn good. It really is just the right amount of sweet to end the meal. Folks were right though, they run out of it quick. \n\nI think Eiji is my new favorite Japanese restaurant in the city. Quaint and unassuming, it will take your mind to some fabulous places... like a little warm nook during an Osaka winter where a husband and wife team just keep serving up delight after delight.", "author": "Jon L."}

I'd like a bit more fish in the Toro roll, considering how much rice there was it made it a bit difficult to enjoy/taste the fish. \n\nThe desserts were shockingly well-done.

The final straw: I had made a 60-second video that I was showing to my husband (no sound) when the manager (?) came over and very loudly and rudely said, \"NO video games.\" OK, we weren't playing video games and don't be so rude about it... Then they overcharged us by 50% and then tried to insist they were right (they weren't). On a prior visit, we had each ordered a miso soup and an order of rolls and were told, \"We have a $10 minimum.\" We said that was fine and that we were planning to order more as we went (pretty typical for sushi), and they wouldn't let us. Either we order everything now or they wouldn't serve us.\n\nService aside, the sushi is usually very good, though every so often they definitely have a bad day.

The space has a Tokyo-meets-Marin-in-a-sleeping-tube vibe, but it's cozy-quaint if you don't mind sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with complete strangers who are trying to look at the pictures on your iPhone. This eatery wouldn't be out of place in a Ginza alleyway dominated by a bunch of drunk businessmen with a two-hour commute ahead of them. However, the crowd here was more on the Castro-cool side with a cheery waitress encouraging Jamie W. and me to try everything we asked about. \n\nEverything on the menu indeed sounded good, but we were also drawn to the chalkboard menu above the counter table. We both started with bowls of the Special Miso Soup ($3.75 each) - which tasted a bit like a Japanese clam chowder since it had a milky consistency (see photo). It was filled with strips of seafood I really couldn't recognize (bottom-feeders, I was imagining) and topped with chopped green onions. It was indeed special since I've never had as hearty a broth nor as many diverse ingredients in a miso soup. \n\nI knew I needed to try the tofu - which Jamie steadfastly refused. I didn't have enough gumption to order the $8.75 Oboro Tofu, often referred to as the chef's masterpiece (...I just can't pay that much for bean curd) - so I went for the $4 Cold Tofu - ice cold and apparently made in the cup to a silken texture (see photo). While I admired the freshness, it just refused to move from the bland to the sublime despite how much soy sauce I doused over it. We moved onto the $9.25 Steamed Wild Duck Breast, a seasonal special that is sliced and fanned immaculately on the plate (see photo). While the duck was tasty no matter the temperature, I still would have preferred it warm. \n\nThe sushi was more uniformly successful. We tried the $7.25 five-piece Ceviche Roll, a Latino-tinged concoction with hamaichi, lettuce and some kind of homemade salsa inside (you can definitely taste the kick of the jalapeno). Off the chalkboard, we ordered the $9.85 Negi Toro, a fatty tuna roll sprinkled with green onion (see photos). Tasty. We did save room for dessert since we knew the $3.50 Strawberry Mochi was a must (see photo). The fresh sweetness of the real strawberry really goes very well with the mochi covering. \n\nSomewhat less interesting was a more elaborate dessert, the $5 Mochi Ice Cream - Kyoto Style (see photo). It consisted of scoops of vanilla and green tea ice cream wrapped in cinnamon-sprinkled mochi and then cross-hatched with a sweet red bean sauce. Too much sauce, and I was just hoping it would be chocolate. All in all, it was a very nice series of little courses, a bit like a Japanese tapas house. Well, it felt like somebody's house. Or maybe somebody's walk-in closet. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...moments of bravura, a few slight misses but quite worthwhile overall\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...smallish and then some but it felt like Tokyo to me \nSERVICE - 4 stars...smiling often, and the dishes came out in quick order \nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely would like to come back for the Oboro tofu and other delicacies from Chef Onoda", "author": "Ed U."}

It also comes with a tray of different toppings that you can add if you find regular tofu a bit bland.\n\nLike their venue, their serving sizes are also tiny.  After sharing four plates and dessert, our hero was still a bit hungry. Their sushi is a bit underwhelming, so it's best to stick with their hot dishes here. The ankimo was also nothing to write home about. Their chalkboard miso cod special, however, was pretty decent and left our hero wanting more than the 4 oz serving size.\n\nPROS:\n- Their homemade tofu is excellent.\n- The service is pretty legit and all Japanese.\n\nCONS:\n- Don't expect to get full off your meals here.\n- It's really crowded in there and the tables are packed way too close for comfort.", "author": "Albert W."}

The bottom line is that the service we received was completely rude. \n\nThere is no way around it. We made a reservation, ordered 8-10 dishes for 4 people, 2 bottles of beer, a very expensive bottle of sake, and 2 desserts. Several of the standard dishes we requested were unavailable, which is annoying but it happens. Then our server rolled his eyes when we asked him to divide the strawberry mochi into quarters. Every time we go there is only one strawberry mochi left, and now I'm starting to suspect that's a lie they tell customers to keep some around for other customers. Why don't they just make more strawberry mochi? Those were minor annoyances.\n\nA the end of the meal the chef came to our table and very rudely bent over asked us if something was wrong, told us to leave because he had customers waiting for their reservation. It was a totally humiliating experience. I'm really sad about it because the food really is top notch in terms of authenticity and quality, but with service like that I can't imagine feeling comfortable going back.  I was surprised to be treated so rudely, especially in a Japanese restaurant. \n\nWe've celebrated anniversaries, birthdays, the birth of our child there.

It can easily be missed so look out for it just past Kitchen Story.\n\nThe bar seating area only had roughly two seats and the sushi chef was located in the kitchen. Talk about being further removed from your customers. The restaurant doesn't seem to have a traditional sushi bar seating area and mainly consisted of a couple sparse tables.\n\nFOOD:\nClam Miso Soup\n*Came with 5 clams. The clams were tasty and had a good texture, but the miso soup itself was lacking. It just tasted like a very boring miso soup and the clams didn't enhance the flavor at all.\n*If I can remember correctly, this was $5!\n\nChirashi (~$20)\n*One word: UNDERWHELMING. \n*Beware of small portions and very slim cuts when ordering this bowl. The menu mentioned it would come with 9 flavors of seafood.\n*I remember tasting salmon, tuna, hamachi, squid, mackerel, salmon roe, cooked shrimp, and two white fishes.\n\nSpicy Tuna Handroll\n*I was still left hungry after having a very expensive Chirashi bowl so I decided to order a handroll.\n*There was barely any spicy flavor in this! FAILURE written all over the place!\n\nStrawberry Mochi\n*The saving grace of the meal, but they have a limitation where you can only order one. WHY?!\n\nI could have just ordered the wrong dishes, but I truly was hoping for a good sushi experience at such a highly rated restaurant. I should have known to really lower my expectations when I noticed most of the clientele were not Japanese or Asian. I probably should have stuck to their signature house tofu.\n\nQUICK TIPS:\nThe red bean covered Strawberry mochi might be good, but it can't save a lackluster sushi dinner. This place will definitely not be my first pick when it comes to sushi. I would recommend going elsewhere for better tasting options at a better price.\n\nThis review was for a visit in 01/2013.", "author": "Jason H."}

As you can tell by the many reviews here, small but awesome menu of very fresh and good quality seafood. All the sushi is good.\n\nBut what really makes this place stand out is the hand made tofu selection. I recommend just ordering a different one each time and try them all. As an Asian person I am always asked really funny questions about how we eat Tofu. My response is.... it's like how Caucasians eat potato. Everyone has their very own special recipe and there are so many varieties!! \n\nThis is a great place to check out traditional Japanese style tofu.\n\nAnd of course that strawberry mochi desert is a must must order.

I think this may be the first restaurant I've found in SF that has up-to-par sushi! So happy I get to fill my sushi craving now :)\n\nHighlights:\n1) TOFU!! The Oboro Tofu is a must! They make it fresh from soy milk in a clay pot at your table(side). They give you a few garnishes and tamari soy sauce to accompany the tofu. But remember to take a bite sans any condiments first! The tofu is rich and flavorful. Anyone who doesn't like tofu should eat this and reconsider their decision! My favorite garnishes are shiso, scallion, ginger and a bit of bonito flakes, with of course the tamari.\n\n2) Sake-miso Black Cod. This was on their special menu board but hopefully it's not a rare item! I've had really good and really bad preparations of this dish, thus I'm always suspicious. First, the fish has to be procured freshly. Second, it can't be overcooked! Overcooked black cod is not worth eating at all! Third, of course, the seasoning has to be just right. When it's done right, (and Eiji does a great job of it), it's buttery, flaky, and just slightly sweet!\n\n3) Misonabe. December is the perfect time for nabe! The broth was slightly sweeter than I expected because it's a miso-based broth. The pot is chock full of veggies and seafood. Really hearty and good!\n\n4) Sushi. I didn't expect a place like this to have fresh sushi, but I was checking out other people's plates. The fish looked really fresh and cut properly (there are certain ways to tell good sushi from bad by just looking at it). We ordered some kanpachi and uni to end the meal. They were on the special menu board so I assumed it meant they were really fresh.

I read a few other reviews about bad service, and one of the highlights of my experience here was the wonderful service. Maybe Yelp reviews have an effect after all...\n\nAnyway, I wanted to give a brief, honest view of my recent dining experience at this place.\n\n1. The service was very nice. Two tables already said \"reserved\" on them, and there was a group of four people in line already, possibly more. The host said it would be 30 minutes at least, unless one of the reservations didn't show up in 10 or we'd get that table. I think we waited about 20 minutes. Perfectly reasonable.\n\n2. There is no sushi bar. Wah. There is a \"bar,\" technically speaking, with a whopping two seats (or three, depending on the availability of that one table juxtaposed against the end of the bar, where they will take the free chair and turn it towards the bar to make three), but should you be so fortunate as to be seated in this area, you will not be in front of the sushi chef as he prepares delicious sushi. No; the chef will be in the kitchen, viewing through a little cubby hole so as to expedite his deliverables and monitor the state of the dining area. (Hello Rumble Fish.)\n\n3. The place is tiny. I'm talking room for 20. You do the math.\n\n4. There ain't no samba sushi at this joint. It's more on the authentic side of Japanese cuisine, as far as I know about traditional Japanese. Their claim to fame is the tofu, which indeed is quite tasty. We had the Ankake Tofu, which was nice.\n\n5. The real highlights were the White Meat Fish Carpaccio, Eggplant with Walnut Miso, the Poke Roll and the Tamago.\n\n6. The Uni was disgusting (to me) and I actually love Uni. Maybe my palate is not sophisticated enough, but all I tasted was my best guess at sewage treatment. Sorry to spoil your appetite, but it was really vile to me.\n\n7. The service was great! We had two different people attending, constantly delivering orders, taking away empty plates, and refilling the sake bottle on request. Both of them were pleasant and sociable.\n\nOkay, this wasn't so brief after all, but in summary, I'd love to go back and try some different menu items (although the White Meat Fish Carpaccio will always be a staple), but I wish they had a proper sushi bar, because for me, that's an integral part of the sushi-going experience.", "author": "Rick A."}

I arrived before my friends.   I was greeted quickly and told to take a seat in the waiting area next to the door.  Immediately you sense the impatience of the staff.

I said I had a 7:45 dinner reservation.  \n\nMy friends arrived about 2 minutes late and we were seated promptly.  The menu was pretty small, so we decided pretty quickly.

The flavor was ok, not too special.\n\n2) Cod:  The cod dish was small.  The marinate was delicious.  The fish was melt in your mouth tender.\n\n3) Eggplant with miso:  This was my favorite.  I love eggplant.  This dish was flavorful.\n\n4) Rainbow Roll:  The fish was fresh.  Not too special compared to other sushi restaurants.\n\n5) Dragon Roll:  Again, not much difference from other sushi restaurants.\n\n6) Yosenabe:  This seafood stew was delicious and hearty.  They were pretty generous with the seafood.\n\n7) Strawberry mochi:  This dessert was addicting and very original.  Beautiful to look at as well, but very small serving for the price.\n\n8) Purple sweet potato yokan:  This dessert was yummy and fun.

I guess it's common sense that tofu wouldn't always come in a neat little plastic-wrapped cube, but it had never entered my mind that it could be served hot & fresh.  The curds are served swimming in whey that tastes just like fresh soybeans to me.  To accompany the obaro tofu, there are seven condiments: spicy daikon, sliced scallion, fresh ground ginger, shaved fish, sliced shiso leaf,  roasted sesame seeds, and a small bottle of tamari.  Experimenting with all of them to find the best combination for your palate is fun.\n\nOther good things from Eiji: steamed duck breast appetizer.  Served (intentionally) cold, it was tender and flavorful without any of the heaviness I normally associate with duck.  All of the sashimi and maki rolls we ordered were good- the Mackerel (Saba) is marinated in a house marinade that gives it tons of flavor, and I love that the California roll is made with fresh crab.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-02-21", "description": "Eating the homemade tofu at Carmel has been a gift and a curse.  I never order tofu at restaurants, however did on a whim and it turned out to be the best tofu I have ever eaten.  However, since it is so far away, I have been trying to find a replacement.  You cannot never forget first love and I tried, I really did.  I came to Eiji because their oboro tofu is supposed to be the best in San Francisco.  \n\nWalking in, Eiji is tiny, literally a hole in the wall.  It is right next to Tangerine and it is so small that when driving, a tree blocked the whole restaurant from view.  I drove by it at least 2-3 times.  We did not have a reservation and this restaurant has an elitist vibe.  It is genuinely Japanese and because their fish and tofu are so sought after, the waitresses, especially the head one, comes off as a bit haughty.  We came in around 6:15 and she gave a little fuss about serving us, saying their were reservations.  However, nothing speaks louder than greenbacks and finally she told us we could have a table, but must finish by 7:15 so that the table could be relinquished to the party who reserved it.  \n\nI ordered the oboro tofu, 9 piece sashimi, spicy tuna roll and an order of toro.  The sashimi was fresh and the cuts were generous.  However, it is like any other high grade sashimi.  You cannot go wrong with toro...the fatty tuna is delicious.  The oboro tofu came out (it is made when you order) and I could not wait.  They give you a little tray of condiments which you can sprinkle in your tofu.  Taking my first bite, it was good, however........The tofu was soft, but broke off in pieces while the one in Carmel was so silky smooth.  Also, the sauce they gave us was just not the same.  It was too underwhelming if you put too little and too overwhelming if you put too much.  I do not mean to sound like a little bitch and complain however, Akaoni will forever have my heart. \n\nEiji is a good date place, however, I would not call it the best Japanese food ever in the city.  I am still searching.  If you are ever in the Carmel area, please go to Akaoni and try their tofu.", "author": "Brian V."}

The comic relief starts when one walks into this place, and sees the huge blusterous bulletin that they WILL NOT SEAT until EVERYONE from your party is present.  Also, next to the door is what appears to be a seating bench, but has a pathetic looking flower display, with accompanying sign that instructs guests to not sit, because the place is so obviously reserved for the wilting flowers. Hilarious!  \n\nFor Starters:\nWakame Salad & Ohitashi | both equally delicious, 4 stars \n\nI quickly stopped laughing when the actual sushi was served.  Usually like to mix things some authentic Maki, with infused / contemporary Uramaki rolls.  So for lunch Timothy and I shared:\n\nHamachi Nigiri | although, they served a really visually beautiful cut, I am questioning how fresh it actually was.\n\nShitake Roll | usually a staple sushi roll for me, this one was good, but nothing special.  it could've been rolled a bit tighter, a few of my rolls fell apart when I dove in for the kill.\n\nCeviche Roll | is a neat concept, but it literally does taste like it was marinated in cheap salsa.\n\nAlso, I don't remember what they called it on the menu.  But, it was listed in the specials board and was pretty much a slab of eggplant that has been roasted with a caramelized walnut sauce. This was really disgusting, and I am glad this was ordered last or else I may have just thrown up.\n\nAlthough this place does seem like it could have some potential for the location.  And I see how they are trying to brand the authenticity of their restaurant through the themed Japanese-esque pit house mock-architectural feature that frames the chef's quarters.. But, it is just kitschy, and I definitely felt sorry for the poor waiter, who had to wear that abstrusely tasteless costume.  \n\nI am not a fan.", "author": "Ty T."}

My friend and I make it a point to grab dinner here at least once every 4-6 weeks.  Their fish is consistently fresh and we can never say no to their delicious, house made desserts.

They're all house favorites, and for good reason.  \n\nThat being said, why does Eiji only deserve four stars in my book? ---- Their service has steadily declined since I started coming here a year ago.  My friend and I like to take our time and enjoy our meal here.  We catch up over an appetizer or two, individual entrees, and dessert.  Sometimes this means that our meals take slightly longer than an hour.  Normally, the wait staff are courteous and check in frequently and are quick (but not pushy) about turning over the table.\n\nToday was different.  After we had finished our meal and the dishes had been cleared away, one of the waitresses came to inform us that the next party had arrived and were waiting for the table.  Wow.  Okay.  I always make reservations when dining here and have still had to wait to be seated in the past, so this treatment is a first for me.  We were actually waiting for the check when she said this, so I thought this was pretty rude.  This left a rather sour taste in my mouth as we left the restaurant.

So while cute, I wasn't super at ease.\n\nFOOD\nWe had clam miso soup, seawee salad, cold tofu steamed, regular sushi set (assorted fish and tuna roll), and the strawberry mochi with kyoto ice cream.\n\nMiso soup = with incredibly fresh clams inside, was delicious. One of the tastiest miso soups I've ever had. Not overly salty like most. Downside is it's served incredibly hot, so you gotta be careful. But after a couple minutes, it's cooled down enough to start sipping\n\nSeaweed salad = fresh, and tasty, but somewhat on the small side. Still, delicious!\n\nCold Tofu Steamed = Never had this before, but wow! It's delicious! It's a soft silken tofu in a sauce, and you spoon it out like you were eating a sundae. It comes with salt, scallions, fresh ginger. The tastes are delectable.\n\nSushi! = Probably the freshest tasting fish I've had in the past 6 weeks. I was very happy with it. Also, you could actually taste the fish in the roll, which I really appreciated. Most sushi places over-complicate the rolls so you don't get a true taste of the fish. Our chef's choice roll was simple, and packed with wasabi, maybe a little too much as it gave your nose a kick\n\nMochi = someone showed up and asked for take-out desert, and the server said they don't have any. Then I found out they save it for guests! Boom, that's a win. Because the home-made mochi with strawberries inside is great! They sliced it in half for me and my wife. I want it again!\n\nKyoto-style ice cream = Yes, I'll have some more! Basically it's home-made ice cream (green tea and vanilla) inside a dough.

Its served hot and comes with several condiments (like ginger, sesame seeds, green onions, bonito flakes, etc) http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-zetzVfO4X0dpiiTmjdeKg?select=dMSPhUEmdcJ5I4hFAPPImA  We decided to order their cold tofu instead (since we've never tried it). It was just as good. The only difference: served cold with no condiments.\n\nDid I mention they have strawberry daifuku?  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-zetzVfO4X0dpiiTmjdeKg?select=pszRQF_SwynOzfMkm4woAQ Its my favorite!! If I could order 100 of those for myself, I WOULD!! If you like mochi, then you will LOVE this! I also ordered their purple sweet potato yokan. Its like a pudding topped with vanilla ice cream. Not a soft pudding but it had the texture of gritty jello (if that makes any sense). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-zetzVfO4X0dpiiTmjdeKg?select=o1ZWl0Ku4wXX0LKRQOZtuw  I LOVE ube and taro but this dessert was just okay.

The hostess was kind enough to seat us, and the atmosphere was very nice, even though we came close to closing time. First off, the tofu was fantastic. I've never seen tofu brought out in that kind of fashion, nor had freshly-made tofu, but it was very tender and tasted particularly well with a light topping of soy sauce. The sushi, unfortunately, left something to be desired. Perhaps it was a consequence of coming 45 minutes before closing time, but the fish didn't taste as fresh as some of the other places, and they loaded up the pieces of nigiri with wasabi. On more than one occasion, I had to gulp down a good amount of water to make sure the strong wasabi spice didn't linger in the roof of my mouth.\n\nThat being said, I'd definitely come back again for the tofu, and I'd be willing to give it another shot earlier on in the day to see if the quality of the fish improved. We were also really looking forward to the strawberry mochi, which was (unsurprisingly) gone by the time we dined. Definitely plenty of reasons to come back, but I'd rate this currently as a slightly above-average shop, with the tofu worth the price and the rest of the menu a bit questionable at this point.", "author": "Asuka N."}

The place doesn't get too packed-- but it is quite small. The service is great and very authentically Japanese.

We were running late thanks to SF traffic so I called and they cheerfully moved it 15 mins. later and told me to drive safely! When we arrived we were immediately greeted and seated at our table that had the \"RESERVED\" happily waiting for us. \n\nWe ordered the salmon and maguro (tuna) sashimi.

With ginjo wakatake sake, beer and soda to wash it all down.\n\nWhen our server brought the the sashimi, I took one look at the fish and new it was fresh. A quick dip in the wasabi with soy sauce and into my mouth...it melted. OMG! As we devoured the sashimi I looked over and saw the infamous fresh strawberry mochis in a glass container. Something told me to tell our server to put some on my tab before they sold out.\n\nWhen our sushi was brought to us with 15 mins of us being seated. The server place a huge tray with a massive amount of sushi beautifully displayed. Glen and I looked at each other and knew we were about to get into trouble. All the rolls were nicely portioned. All the fish was butter soft and just melted away with each bite. The rice wasn't sticky it had the right amount of starchiness so that it would not take away from the fish. Oh and the sushi doesn't give you the bloated feeling which is awesome all the more reason to eat more! I noticed they make their own tofu before your very eyes! Im trying that next time I come here (who wants to come with me?)\n\nOh and the strawberry daifuku! This alone can bring in 5 stars!

I could've eaten it in three small bites. The sushi was nothing exceptional except exceptionally small--it was sushi I sleepwalked through eating. I liked the Spicy Tuna Roll best because it had flavor unlike the others. The piece of unagi/eel in the Caterpillar Roll was so tiny it went under the taste bud radar--same goes for the imitation crab in the Caterpillar Roll. This was the first time I've had uni/sea urchin and it was really unmemorable. The mochi ice cream was the best part of the meal, but when is it ever bad?\n\nI hate to dog on a beloved neighborhood sushi joint, but this place was a disappointment.

In withdrawal from Sushi Zone (temporarily closed for remodels) and in the throes of nightmares from a surburb joint that calls itself a sushi bar, we stumbled across Eiji. An unearthed gem for us it was a frequently visited comfort food stop for our friends (who remarked everyone knows Eiji is awesome). \n\nOur initial plan was to play it safe-one or two pieces of sushi that almost anyone can get right and a spicy tuna roll. What greated us dissuaded all fears. We instead doubled down and went for it. We started with clam miso. Fresh clams in a light, perfectly seasoned miso broth. We then split an order of gyoza. The wrappers were thin, perfectly grilled without being soggy or dripping in oil. The contents were steamed with surprising fresh flavor.\n\nNow the edge of our hunger was satiated so we were ready to evaluate our sushi completely unbiased. The first sushi - a nigiri toro - melted in our mouths. The second sushi - spicy tuna roll - lived up to our expectations. We finished with maguro (with a touch of wasabi), hamachi, and sake.\n\nThe meal closed with Strawberry Mochi. This is not your store bought, run of the mill blah mochi.

The oboro tofu was fresh, not the usual tofu you get at any other Asian restaurant. I loved the service here. When the owner brought the oboro tofu she did a full explanation of the dish, and advised us to first try it unflavored (awesome taste), then add the special soy sauce along with mini garnishes of ginger, daikon, bonito, sesame seeds, and green onions. Only complaint here was the portions are small, in fact, this place is not good if your are starving. So there's my one star deduction. We ordered several rolls and sushis- and my favorite were the Negi Toro and dragon roll. But you need to order a lot in order to feel full. \n\nDecor was wonderful and kitshy. It had the traditional wood structures I experienced in Kyoto with a ikebana flower arrangement decorating the restaurant. Also had bold, easy to read special of the day's posted over the front of the restaurant, just like the ones at the Tokyo Bay fish market. Its very authentic here in not only look but flavor as well. After some Sapporos and sake thrown in, we each put in about $30, definitely worth trying due to the freshness, quality and service.", "author": "Thomas L."}

Service horrible.\n\nUpon making my reservation for 4.5 people, I was promptly asked if I had any babies in my party.  I explained that we had a three year old.  Although I gave no indication that I would be tardy, he was quite insistent about informing me about their everyone present and 15 min holding only policy.  \n\nWe arrived early and was seated promptly.  \n\nPoints about the horrible service:\n\n1. My niece was holding a toy computer, which was not opened.  The server immediately told us not to open it when we sat down.  We have already read the sign, indicating no computers.  Maybe she should wait to see if we would open it before assuming that we would.  \n\n2. Never bring kids here- not kid friendly or even mildly accommodating- We tried to order a simple order of meat and rice, which was denied.  She claimed that there was no chicken.  When we asked about beef, she said that they only have okra beef.  She was not willing to make a beef dish without the okra.  After going through a couple of other possibilities and explaining that my niece has a seafood allergy, we asked if we can order something small for my very hungry niece and bring it in.  This was also refused, explaining that once they let one person bring food in, then others will feel that it is ok.  We promised to keep it hidden, but was denied again.  Being a little irritated, I told her, \"But there is nothing that my niece can eat on the menu.\"  No response.  \"So she cannot eat then?\"  No response.  I truly do not believe that other patrons will begrudge a three year-old bringing her own food.  Against our better judgement, we stayed and ordered tamago for my niece, which was not eaten.\n\nIf a restaurant is not willing to accommodate for kids, then they should indicate when a reservation is made with a child that their menu is not kid friendly.  It is not ok to have a child starve.  It is very easy for any restaurant to whip something up for a child. \n\n3.  Upon receiving the check, I paid cash leaving a 15% tip due to the horrible service (I usually tip at least 20%).  It was obvious that I did not need change since I included $1 bills.  My $25 change was returned to me in the form of a $20 bill and a $5 bill.  As someone with much experience as a server and owner of restaurants, this gesture was clear.  She is indicating that I did not leave enough tip.  Change is never given if $1 bills are included.  And change never comes in the form of big bills, because that does not leave the customer with the option of changing the amount of tip to leave.   \n\nThe food was overpriced.  We ended up paying $45 per person and was not even half full.  This would not have been an issue if the food was good.  As a sushi lover, I can tell the fish was not fresh.  Only the strawberry mochi was good, but at $3.50 for one strawberry quite pricy.  \n \nI will never come here again.  As a successful restaurant owner, I believe that service makes or breaks a restaurant.  I cannot believe that this restaurant is Michelin rated.  Makes me think twice about the value of the Michelin rating on my own restaurants.", "author": "Susie M."}

I lived in rural Japan (Nagano) for 2 years (and Tokyo for a year after that) and it's very unusual to find a restaurant in Japan that makes its own tofu. AND strawberry daifuku. \n\nSeriously, I think you can wrap anything in mochi and it would be delicious (there were department stores in Tokyo that had full on cakes with whipped cream and flan and fruit wrapped in mochi, I kid you not, and I want to cry thinking about it right now, so far away from that deliciousness in San Francisco.) \n\nAnyway, I don't go here for sushi, which you can get anywhere these days in the City (But I will say that the uni I've had here has always been excellent), but for the home-cooked food, like okra (my favorite vegetable) and the eggplant. And I think they have chawan mushi too, if they do, get it, a savory egg custard that has a bit of fish and chicken and a gingko nut in it. \n\nIt is very small, and the owners might be a little strict, but this is their world, and we have the privilege of eating in it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-03", "description": "I've always been intimidated by the wait but finally got around to trying this. So glad I did.\n\nFirst off, I want to give props to the service. The server prevented me from over-ordering, the guy behind the counter did the initial serve of the oboro tofu (I was sitting next to the counter), they recommended trying the oboro first by itself before adding any of the condiments and warned me the eggplant was really hot, the server wiped up my fauxs pas before bringing dessert, and the guy behind the counter kept refilling my tea. And the service was friendly throughout.\n\nNow for the oboro tofu. I was expecting from the reviews that it require the condiments to have any flavor, but that was not true. The flavor is delicate to be sure, but it is there and it was delightful, as was the texture. In fact, I'd suggest not overdoing it with the condiments, as some of them overpower the tofu.\n\nThe eggplant miso isn't a soup. It's more like an eggplant steak with a savory sauce on top. Tender and flavorful, and the sauce added to the flavor of the rice. There's not much you can say about the rice other than it was fluffy like it's supposed to be.\n\nThe strawberry mochi is a large, whole strawberry wrapped in mochi. It's small, so I ate it in tiny bites, and it was a delight.\n\nBe aware that the prices have gone up from what is shown in the photos, but the food is well worth the price for the quality you get.\n\nI hate saying this because I tend not to trust reviews that have nothing good or nothing bad to say, but I have nothing bad to say about this place beyond that the sushi seems pricy from the menu.

The nice was my idea, mostly because it seemed an appropriate way to mark my newfound \"status\".  We drove around a bit aimlessly for a bit, and then M suggested this place, saying it's quite nice. \n\nWell, she was pretty right, especially when it came to the decor.  The place was small, comfortable and homey.  The specials board dominated the wall and featured a few interesting choices, which we got.  The menu also had a few unusual things, which we also got.  Unfortunately, aside from the grilled Tuna steak, which was AMAZING, nothing else was too exciting.  The fish was fine, but not the kind of freshness I can get at Aka Tombo or at Ino.

It will take you about two seconds to realize that this cozy, place is incredibly small and is about the size of two bedrooms. If anything it feels like a slightly more refined izakaya, small drinking/eating hole.You will be pretty close to your fellow patrons, so don't mind it too much when people can shift slightly and pretty much put their face in your food. Did I say appetizing? No it isn't nearly that tight, although it can make you feel like you are sitting on your neighbor's lap, which may or may not be fortuitous thing. The patronage is leaning towards the more refined and upscale variety if that matters to you.\n\nWhen people come to Eiji, they come for their special tofu. Hell, on the menu they already self proclaim their house special is their tofu. So I took heed to the calls of my sleezy friend and ordered the Oboro tofu. \n\nFor nearly 10 bucks a pop I was expecting an 'eye rolling back into the head' experience but was left quite unsatisfied. The presentation was exquisite but its was just basically a watery broth of tofu similar to consistency of water drop egg soup that is ever so common in Chinese eateries. I do like that they provide a plethora of condiments, most I have not not even heard of, so it was semi enjoyable to mix and match in trying to confuse the taste buds.\n\nOne cannot subsist on this soup so naturally I ordered a roll and a few orders of yellowfin tuna and yellowtail. Quality was alright, but not exceptional, presentation was again quite nice. Placing of items was immaculate and the color/texture of the fish was on point.\n\nOverall, I can see this as a nice place to meet up with some old friends and the entire look feel of this place is worth a visit.

Donna suggested Eiji, so that's where we headed. We found parking almost immediately; it was our lucky day. We were meant to have Eiji this evening. Without reservations, our wait in the early evening was about 15 minutes. If we'd known about making reservations, we certainly would have. \n\nWe started off with the ankimo [monkfish liver]. I ordered the Deluxe Sashimi - 13 pieces, six types of fish, so three pieces of one type of fish, and two pieces of everything else. Ryan ordered the Deluxe Sushi - 11 nigiri and a roll. Donna ordered the uni special and chirashi. Needless to say, we were all pretty stuffed and had no room for dessert afterwards. The fish was fresh and quite tasty, each piece of sashimi sliced to perfection. The fish on the nigiri were good, but not as delicious as the sashimi. \n\nIt was a pretty penny well spent.

It is similar to Chinese tofu dessert (tofu flower) but with a salty soy/bonito broth instead. Yeah they make their own tofu but so do a lot of places.\n\nBAD:\n- The CHIRASHI was a terrible value. For $19, there were only like 6 pieces of fish. They say 9 pieces of seafood but 1 piece is the obligatory cooked shrimp and 2 pieces were tamago (egg). This is the second time in my life that some place went cheap and gave 2 pieces of tamago. They do sprinkle some ikura on top but overall the chirashi was very overpriced.\n- The prices here are above average for what you get.

Sushi is always good, but really good sushi is AMAZING, and Eiji makes amazing sushi.  It was a really good birthday.\n\nWhen you walk into Eiji you will notice that it has less than 10 tables and the dining area is the size of a medium living room.  You will either love this like I did, or be wrong.  The menu is very simple - which I liked quite a bit, as I've begun to feel that sushi is being overtaken by rolls - so we decided to start with a Sapporo, a hot sake, and a tofu dish that is made from scratch at the restaurant and cooked in a clay pot at your table.  I really liked it (and I'm not a huge fan of tofu) because of the subtlety and delicacy of the flavor.  It went very well with sake, and was a delightful way to begin a Japanese meal.\n\nFrom there we decided to order Sake (salmon), Hamachi (yellow tail), Inari (fried tofu) - which was not actually on their menu - and a Poke Roll (spicy white tuna with shies leaf lining the inside); all of which was AMAZING.  The fish was fresh and delicious with the wonderful texture that good sushi has, and I loved the way it felt like I had accidentally stumbled into a Japanese chef's house and invited to an amazing, yet simple dinner.\n\nAt the end of the meal we decided we wanting a little more to nom on, and ordered what I think was just called Okra Beef (it was whole okra wrapped in bits of beef and cooked up somehow) which was an odd ending to any meal, but I like savory, salty things (my mum's from England, I can'r help it).  I'm told they have good dessert items on the menu, as well, but like I said before I prefer savory to sweet.\n\nIf you like sushi and cozy restaurants, please check this place out.

But that wasn't what I came here for...I was craving sushi last night!  \n\nFirst off, a very disappointing menu selection...they had the very basic nigiri and maki selections but less than 10 special rolls to choose from.  We ordered two rolls...dragon roll and spicy tuna.  The spicy tuna was salty...how is that?!  We also ordered the basic nigiri...shiromaguro, hamachi and unagi.  The shiromaguro and the hamachi did not seem fresh...texture and taste were off.  \n\nWith SO many sushi places in the city to choose from, I definitely will not be back.", "author": "Tina L."}

It's just simple traditional and fresh.  Everything you'd want in great Japanese food.  We had gotten the oboru tofu (just ok to me), one of the special sushi's (sorry i forget the name.  something bonito?  delish!), uni (super fresh and flavorful),  caterpillar and alaska rolls (also quality),  I had been looking forward to trying the strawberry mochi all night and was super bummed to find it had sold out.  We half heartedly ordered the kyoto mochi, and so glad we did.  I couldn't get the tastes and textures out of my mind for hours after.   My only regret was sharing that dish.  \n\nSince moving to SF, I've been on the search for a good japanese restaurant.  I hadn't found anything that compared to restaurants in South Bay til now.

Not the best I've ever had but certainly good. Not fishy, not too cold (I hate hate hate when it comes out practically friggin frozen), and nicely sized. \n\nThe salmon sashimi really was quite delicious. Generous fat pieces that really had awesome flavor that just melted in your mouth. The texture was just right. It was, for lack of a better expression, simply luxurious. \n\nThat's all I ate but according to the boyfriend...\n\n- the eel was \"ok.\" Generous serving size and decent. Not the best, not the worst. Nothing to complain about for sure. \n\n- Spicy tuna roll: decent but a little lacking on the tuna. Overall it had a \"nice spice to it.\" \n\nOh and then there's the straweberry mochi... and you'd better believe I had my fair share of that! That my friends, is a must order! For sure! it had the most perfectly tart strawberry on the inside, surrounded by just a thin layer of red bean goodness and wrapped all up in a delicate mochi shell of wonder. Actually... shell is too sharp and shiny a word. It was more of a cushion of soft wonderful mochi. Yes, that's better. \n\nAll told I'll definitely go back.

It comes with condiments like wheat-free soy sauce, shiso leaf, ginger, scallions, and sesame seeds. It is heaven. \n\nThe tuna belly steak is also to die for. Seared just right with tons of flavor from the tuna itself, plus a gingery vinaigrette.  \n\nGet there early to get a seat and some house-made strawberry mochi-- mochi wrapped around a strawberry with red bean paste. I also love the mochi with vanilla and green tea ice cream, which they sprinkle with cinnamon and red bean paste. \n\n*The only reason Eiji does not get 5 stars is because of their customer service concerning seating. We made reservations at 5:30 to ensure we got a table for 4. At 7pm we were still chatting and enjoying visiting and we were asked to leave so that they could seat more people. Yes, Eiji is small and seating is limited, but when you make a reservation they should expect a party to be there for a two hour block. \nI thought that was really rude.... but not rude enough that after a couple month hiatus I won't go back for that Oboro tofu.", "author": "annie s."}

Aji (spanish mackerel) can be very fishy but it's not fishy at all at Eiji. \n\nBesides the fish, they have a signature tofu dish (oboro tofu) you should not miss.

I've been to many Americanized sushi restaurants in the Bay, and not discounting the fact that they are also delicious in their own ways, I was so happy to have discovered this place (thanks to yelp!) for some authentic Japanese food! How can I tell it's authentic? 1) the staff is entirely Japanese, believe is a family-run business, and 2) they have minimal amount of sushi rolls on their menu. Sushi rolls are something that Americans invented (and they are very yummy!). Totally pigged out at this place and I would recommend the following items: \n\nHomemade tofu: yes, they actually make their OWN tofu!!! this is the signature item on their menu. Came in a clay pot and a platter of condiments including ginger, green onion, dried fish flakes, chives, etc. I recommend against using soy sauce since that would overpower the taste of the tofu. As simple as just plain tofu with green onion may sound, it was the best dish of the meal. The tofu was so light and fluffy - without factory-processed preservatives, I was able to taste the soy. It was amazing! Homemade tofu FTW!!! \n\nSashimi: Eiji offers an amazing selection of fresh sashimi, ranging from commonplace fish like salmon to something more exquisite like toro or monkfish livers, this place has it all! \n\nSukiyaki: a very traditional home-style Japanese dish where some sort of meat, mostly beef or chicken, is tossed together with assorted vegetables and clear noodles to make a stew and served in a clay pot. Awesome comfort food for cold SF nights \n\nStrawberry mochi: these are to die for. Gigantic succulent strawberry wrapped around in thin mochi skin, these two complementing ingredients make an amazing combination. One of my favorite desserts of all time! \n\nEating here reminded me a lot of eating at home. Because it's a family-run business (or at least I think it is), the setting is small and home-y; the staff made us feel very at-ease with their warm smiles, personal recommendations, and personal attention of checking up on you to see if the food is ok - why of course, it was delicious!!", "author": "Melody L."}

My friend and I walked in on a Friday night, only to find that all the little tables had little 'Reserved' signs on them. But the waitress told us that if one party didn't show up in the next 5 minutes or so, a table was ours. And because he had scored some amazing parking (and by 'scored' I mean stole from another car), we decided to wait it out. 10 minutes later, the missing party was nowhere to be found and we swooped on their table. Wreckless San Francisco parking FTW. \n\nWe ended up trying the Oboro Tofu, the nigiri combination, salmon sashimi, and poke roll. EVERYTHING IS SUPER FRESH. Like, somebody just killed some fish and served it to you on a platter kind of fresh. And I can truly appreciate the freshness. But I am not a tofu kind of girl. So honestly, the Oboro tofu wasn't really my thing. That being said, it was the most unique tofu experience I've had. Prepared right in front of you and served steaming hot with 7 different condiments and intense soy sauce...truly memorable. And it even took on a smoky flavor which I didn't expect. The fish in the rolls/sashimi/nigiri was really good. Melt in your mouth soft and tender. But I would say forgo tradition and ask for your nigiri without wasabi because they put A LOT on. I did, unfortunately, end my meal with an incredibly chewy, tough piece of fish (definitely not Eiji's fault--I just have no idea what kind of fish I ate but I HATED it). \n\nWe decided to try all 3 dessert mochis that they had. Don't. The purple yam one was mediocre and the cinnamon mochi crepe thing was a little bizarre. But definitely get those strawberry mochis. Delicious! \n\nSo why only 3 stars? Because I cannot see coming back to Eiji on a regular basis. Yes the fish was fresh, and yes the tofu was cool, but you can get fresh fish elsewhere, and tofu is not bringing me back here. The desserts were massively overpriced, and while I loved the strawberry, I still find it hard to believe we spend $3.50 on 1 strawberry. A little ridic.

It's been on my list to visit, but it's sort of tucked away, that I always forget to check it out. I also wondered why my Japanese friends have never recommended this place, so it was suspect in that regard (they have very reliable palates) -- especially since one friend lives only a few blocks away. That said, it was a nice day, and I happened to walk by Eiji right around opening time, on my way to the library. That's a nice adventure, I thought. Homemade tofu, then casual library browsing. So perhaps it was fate.\n\nSince I was a party of one, my server suggested I order the Ankake tofu with the \"flavorful\" sauce. I'm sorry to say, the sauce was not flavorful. What was flavorful was the ginger, scallion and shiso I topped it with -- not fair. There was so much sauce on the tofu, I could not taste it. Unfortunately I cannot recommend this dish. It is bland through and through. Although I will come back to try the made-to-order tofu dish, which everyone around me was enjoying immensely. I am a bit perturbed I was steered away from ordering this (because I was one person), so I recommend bringing a friend, or two, when you visit.\n\nOther items ordered were the fresh sardine nigiri, and bamboo with wakame. The sardine was delicious and very fresh, but it was sooooo tiny. I practically inhaled this as I ate. Next time I will order a variety of nigiri, to make up for the small portions.\n\nThe bamboo shoots & wakame are served hot in a very light broth. The bamboo shoots are fresh and absolutely delicious! The grilled taste comes through, although I wish the broth had more flavor. Again on the bland side. The wakame is just a supporting role, for toothy goodness. I would definitely recommend this dish for anyone who hasn't tried fresh bamboo shoots, but I might slip in a dash of soy sauce just to give a bit more flavor. The grilled taste is wonderful.\n\nService was attentive, but there are 3 servers on the floor, which I felt was a bit too many people in such a tiny place. The space is very cozy, and the servers are nice enough, although they seem a bit rigid, with the slightest veneer of stress amongst them. A table next to me was having a great time, making friends with the couple next to them, and the servers looked so removed from the atmosphere.

There was actually a whole chestnut stuffed inside and it was very strong in chestnut flavor. \n- I tried their purple sweet potato yokan with vanilla ice cream and really liked it; it was a light dessert and I loved how it wasn't too sweet or rich.\n- Their uni was good, but I've had fresher ones. Their halibut was very buttery and I regretted getting it nirigi and not sashimi.\n\nI wish we were hungry enough to eat more things that time.

It sounds a lot like this: \nI gotta have Eiji, and I gotta have it NOW!!!\n\nThe back-story:\nSomething you should know about me is I know my tofu.  My mom was such a hippie that she denies being called a hippie.  \"No man,\" she says, \"I was an Earth mama.\"  I was that kid in a small town Colorado middle school trying to hide my turmeric tofu salad sprout sandwiches on homemade whole-wheat bread, hoping (in vain) to make trades for white bread cheese sandwiches.  Not cool at all. But I grew up on the stuff and now I love it.  I also lived in China & Taiwan for a couple of years where I tried all kinds of tofu (yes, I did become a fan of chou dofu (stinky tofu)).  Now I'm married to a man who's uncle owns a tofu factory in Hawaii.  I'm telling you, obsession!\n\nThe review:\nI do believe I've had delightful dreams about the oboro tofu at Eiji, which, as others have mentioned, they make fresh when you order.  It has an exquisite texture, all soft and soupy, with special condiments to add.  The other tofus are also good, but if it's your first time you gotta go oboro.   \n\nThe other Japanese entrees are quite good as well, though I typically get some wakame salad, sashimi/sushi to round out my meal.  I'd say everything else on the menu is very good, just not quite as ridiculously outstanding as the tofu.  Oh, and for dessert, you do have to get the strawberry mochi.  It is required.  By me.  1 whole perfectly ripe strawberry, glazed with red bean paste, wrapped in mochi.  Must have.\n\nThe ambience is adorable, simple and elegant.  It's small, so it can get crowded (though, remarkably, not noisy).  It's a good idea to call in reservations from about 7:30 on.\n\nThis truly is a one-of-a-kind restaurant.

(thanks to the Asahi Super Dry)\nIt was initially a three-some but Cindy K just watched as I put those wonderfully fresh golden gonads in my mouth.  (uni is super fresh)\nWhen I masticated and then swallowed... the flavor and quality was blissful, majestic, and soothing at the same time.  My eyes rolled back in ecstasy as the experience penetrated into my soul...\n*stay tuned for more*\n\nOKAY, I realized it would take too much time to write a romance novel review, so here's the breakdown for Eiji:\n\nIt seats, at most, 20 customers at any one time, so it's adviseable to call ahead for reservations.  Since it's a very small space, it can be romantic for dates, and I did tell Cindy this... whoever brings me here and makes sure my hunger is satiated will most likely get some of my fresh-grade sashimi. The sweet floral decorations are done by Floral Designer, Hidemi Onoda who owns Arancione e' Porpora (I believe this person is family of Eiji's owner).  (mark as USEFUL).\n\nTheir specialty is silken tofu, which can be served cold, warmed up, or made-to-order--the Oboro tofu, meticulously prepared on a portable propane stove, in a clay bowl.... basically the ephemeral tofu curds before forming into solidified tofu.  Resembling clouds, the oboro tofu has a mild sweetness followed by a very delicate caustic sensation from the clear liquid used to coagulate the soymilk.  If you've had the Philippine \"TAHO\"... it's like that.  What relaxes your senses is how careful and gracefully each claypot is prepared by the uniformed, very attentive, and very cool servers (there are 2 of them).  Each claypot is served with 6 flavor topping enhancers: toasted sesame seeds (which I thought was the best), sliced scallions, minced ginger, minced spiced daikon, bonito flakes, thinly sliced shiso leaf.  You can also splash a little bit of their organic tamari soy sauce.  Mmmm.  \n\nThe sushi chef/owner Eiji Onoda is in the back, dressed in the same uniform as the two servers tending to the customers.  He masterfully selects and beautifully slices the fish, so when you get your nigiri or sashimi... they will, no doubt, stimulate your rods and cones.  My eyes were definitely rolling in the back of my head when I experienced the fresh and flavorful uni and ankimo.  I was speechless afterwards.  \n\nWe also had various nigiri, which were all of very good quality.     We ended our dinner with their fresh strawberry mochi, which was not overly sweet (i liked it!)\n\nEating at Eiji definitely relaxed and soothed my senses after a stressful week.

My spontaneous, last minute dinner at Eiji was one of the best evenings I've had since moving here to San Francisco.  So it had been an unexpectedly sunny warm Sunday, after weeks of grey and rain.  We had just left some friends on the search for food after sharing some drinks with them, so we already had a pleasant buzz going.  And I was having a great time with a new friend whose food radar was directing us in the general direction of Eiji, though we didn't know that's where we were heading. All of this probably colors this review, but I'll try to extract the essenital elements.\n\nI've often passed by Eiji, wondering about this tiny cozy looking place, but on this evening, my companion whispered \"Eiji\" as we walked past and whoosh we were in.  The place is neat and tidy, with lots of wooden surfaces, but no pretension to be hip or super exotic or trendy.  We were lucky that it was a slow night, since I've seen this place packed before, so the staff were very attentive and helpful.   It was just unescapably low-key romantic, and I'm a sucker for that with or without company. \n\nSo, as others have noted, the sushi and sashimi is good, but not necessarily outstanding. But, to my still unsophisticated sushi-taste buds, it was still quite good. But the non-sushi items, the tofu, the whitefish in broth, the whatever else we had were stellar.  I was seduced by the subtle tastes that demanded you take a break in conversation and just savor. Yum.  And then there was the sake.  We order a premium sake, on recommendation by my dinner companion.  I'm afraid I've forgotten what it was exactly, but it was the last bottle they had, a special brewing available only once a year.  So, we had some and then we had some more. And then some more.  It had been a hard couple of months for me at work, so this unexpected indulgence was healing.  And before we knew it, we had spent easily over two hours eating slowly, laughing, drinking.  What a meal should be.\n\nSo, thanks to the afternoon sun and drinks, Eiji, and of course my companion, that first Eiji evening will stand out.  Of course I'll go again, but I'm actually going to wait a bit, because I'm enjoying the memory of that evening still.", "author": "Padawan T."}

It is their home-made tofu & strawberry mochi desserts that are their big 'selling points'.   Anyway, maybe because of my 'just ok' picks from the menu, I'm rating this place 3 instead of 4 stars, although it's probably more of a 3.5.\n\nThey have 3 kinds of tofu:\n-- [[ Cold Tofu ]] - \"Made directly in a cup.  This is a plot type of silken tofu\"\n-- [[ Ankake Tofu ]] - \"Steamed cold tofu.  Topped w/ starchy sauce.  Very flavorful\".  This was the one that we ordered.  I'm not sure what they meant by cold, since the tofu came in a bowl with a generous amount of (soup-like) sauce on it, that was made with soy, mirin, and daishi.  The tofu was creamy and soft.  It came with a condiment dish of diced ginger, scallions, and something else.  Try the tofu & sauce by itself before adding the condiments.\n-- [[ Oboro Tofu ]] - \"We make it when you order.\"  It is \"the name for tofu before curds form in a square shape, or when curds separate from soymilk\".  This is supposed to come plain/bland.  We didn't order this since it didn't sound as appealing and it was also more expensive ($9.25, instead of $5 for the 2nd, and $4.50 for the 1st one).  However, this is supposed to be the most infamous one at this restaurant.\nhttp://s3-media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G25254E4Vswzc3ZwUfFrxA/l.jpg\n\nOther things that we ordered:\n\n[[ Chirashi ]]:\nComes with 9 kinds of fish on top of sushi rice.  The fish quality was pretty good.  There were  the 1 or 2 obligatory dinky pieces of fish though.  The rice could have been better if it was more firm in texture, and a wee bit more cool (temperature-wise).  A cooler temperature could have also made the fish taste even more fresh.  The flavoring of the rice was good though.\nhttp://s3-media3.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ARg-DkyVg7LzV2NuCJJ4JA/l.jpg\n\n[[ Poke Roll ]]:  \"white tuna with spicy sauce\".  I had great expectations for this, but I was sorely disappointed.  It was not that spicy, and it was not that flavorful.  The sauce was also a little bit creamy, which I thought was kind of uncharacteristic of poke.\n\n[[ Alaska Roll ]]:  Good.  No complaints.  We ordered this as a filler when we thought that we would be more hungry.\n\n[[ Broiled Miso Black Cod ]]:  This was a \"special\" of the day.  My friend ate most of this.  I just had a bite of it, but it seemed flavorful, well-cooked/textured.  Generous size (but does not come with a side of rice, as we had expected that it would).\nhttp://s3-media3.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/SwdZ59iCg74IsjDT1kci3A/l.jpg\n\n[[ Strawberry Mochi ]]:\nA thin layer of mochi around a very fresh strawberry.  Even though I had seen a picture of this before coming here, and saw it sitting in front of me as I picked it up to put it into my mouth, I was expecting to bite into ice cream.  It is something that is strangely hardwired into me - that I associate \"mochi\" and \"dessert\" with ice cream.  Anyway, I was surprised by a fresh burst of strawberry.  Delicious!  (But not worth all of the hype by all of the other reviews.)  Beware that they do run out.  My friend and I had to share one strawberry because the restaurant was dwindling down on their supplies.\nhttp://s3-media2.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/CtomBMSEZMQ5n8465fNXbw/l.jpg\n\n\nAmbiance:\nIt feels very \"Japanese\" inside.

Given the top billing for tofu (huge sign outside and reviews from Yelp), we felt compelled to try the Oboro Tofu, and it did not disappoint. It came out in a porcelain bowl, and Eiji's wife suggested we try it plain, then with the organic soy sauce, and then with one of the six toppings: ginger, sesame seeds, shiso leaf and scallions, shredded bonito, daikon, katsuo flakes. My favorites were the ginger and shiso/scallions. It actually had a soup like consistency, rather than solid tofu that is normally served at restaurants. It was phenomenal and only got better after sitting on the table longer (I believe it cooked more in the bowl). \n\nWe also had a combination of rolls and nigiri.

I've been here three times; tonight, a few days after they opened a couple years ago, and once somewhere in between.\n\nThe first time I ate here, I was the only person in the restaurant.  The husband prepared my sushi while the wife waited nearby, and then, sort of charmingly I suppose, stood in the doorway to the kitchen and pretty much watched me eat.  So I'm glad to see they're getting enough business to spread the attention around now.\n\nThe second time here I tried, among other things, the freshly-prepared tofu.  Raw, fresh tofu is a pretty austere experience.  Frequently, I find these Japanese pairings of an overtly plain base with (to my American palate) shockingly flavorful spices/seaweeds/fish sauces to be a bit much.  I think I prefer flavors that blend smoothly or stick to one section of the spectrum.  But it is an experience, and if those flavor sensations are something you appreciate then it's well worth it.  I mean it's worth it once or twice on fiend points alone.\n\nThis most recent trip I started off with an octopus salad - the tako sukomono - which isn't something I usually order.  I felt adventurous and was rewarded for it.  Long, half-centimeter thick cuts of octopus on a nice vinegary cucumber salad.  Nema S. was impressed.  The ceviche roll is delicious although I feel like it could use a little more zest.  The shiro maguro was entirely decent - not best-of-class but but where it lacked those most delicate flavors it filled in with silence, which is better than fishiness.  And actually Nema preferred it to the toro, although for my part I thought the toro was tops.  Buttery in both flavor and texture, smooth  taste, really prime.\n\nEiji is intimate, tasteful, tasty, and probably a really good place to take a date...or a housemate, in this case.  I was able to get a 8:00 reservation, calling at 7:20 on a sunday, but from the other reviews it sounds like that might be a lucky break.  At any rate...enjoy.", "author": "Oliver N."}

I don't expect my sushi to be crunchy, so I guess that makes me a wimp.\n\nI'm ok with that.\n\nOne thing that didn't really wow me was the homemade tofu.

I've been a regular customer of Eiji for 4 years, each time spending well over $100 per meal and leaving a generous tip. One of the things that's always irritated me about this restaurant is that he does not serve any Japanese beer. All of his beer is cheap crap imported from Canada with fake Japanese labels stuck on it. Last night, I really felt like a nice Japanese beer with my meal so I picked up an Eichigo Beer from Japantown and politely asked if I could drink it with my meal. He demanded a $15 corkage fee for a $3 bottle of beer. The whole point of a corkage fee, as I understand it, is to compensate for lost profit on drinks the restaurant could have sold. So, I asked how much it would cost to buy a beer, and they said a large beer would be $6 (mine was a small beer). So, the most they could possibly be losing in lost profit would be $4, probably less, and therefore, the corkage fee for a single small bottle of beer should not possibly be $15 which is more than twice the price of the most expensive beer I could have purchased from them. I asked if they could reduce the fee if I purchase a $19 glass of sake (plenty of profit in that, right), and he started screaming at me about how he doesn't like it when people bring their own beer into the restaurant but for this one time only (with a very hostile and rude face and tone) he'd waive the fee if I purchase a BOTTLE of sake! What am I going to do with a $64 bottle of sake (my partner does not drink)? And, how insulting to suggest that's a special concession! His demeanor was on the verge of going ballistic, he was literally shaking and contempt was oozing out of his pores. He knows me. I've been a solid good customer without giving him any difficulty whatsoever for 4 years. All I asked, politely, was to have this beer with my meal and to pay a reasonable fee for doing so. In a nice way. His hostile attitude ruined my entire meal and made me feel so unwelcome that I've decided not to return again. It's really sad to close the page on a 4 year relationship, but I work too hard for my money, and this jackass doesn't deserve it, if this is how he treats someone who has shown consistent loyalty for 4 straight years.", "author": "Eater S."}

It has been months now since I've been back in SF, and every time I got sushi I was disappointed. I was starting to get worried that I would never again be able to enjoy Japanese food here, because the Tokyo/Kyoto trip had reset my bar too high. Kiss would probably have reassured me, but I haven't gotten over there in ages.\n\nEiji was a random visit with a friend who'd heard about it. I was broke, but it was utterly worth it. My fears have been assuaged.\n\nDelectable sushi; we ordered simple fish rolls, no cutely-named, ingredient-heavy nonsense. Go for the specials menu, and trust the servers for recommendations.\n\nThe mackerel/bitter melon sunomo was outstanding. The flavors and textures were an absolutely brilliant contrast. \n\nThe house-made ankake tofu was delicious. I usually find tofu tedious, but I could eat that stuff for breakfast every morning for a week.  There was another tofu dish that we ordered, a crumbled tofu/minced vegetables item; it was not terribly inspiring. It felt like health food, something that we were being made to eat because it was good for us. It wasn't *bad*, but everything else was so stellar that it paled in comparison.\n\nAnd then there were the strawberry mochi. Ichigo daifuku mo futatsu onegaishimasu! I loathe adzuki (red bean) paste. I have very open food preferences, and I periodically try adzukis again, but I have continued to hate them for well over 20 years. The ichigo are giant strawberries coated with adzuki paste and then enveloped in mochi. They were so. very. good. I grew up in a place where it was standard to go strawberry-picking in the winter, and I am very fussy about strawberries. Those flavor-free things in the supermarket? Those are a pale attempt at imitating strawberries. The strawberries at Eiji were not quite the same as sun-warmed berries straight from the field, but the whole package was well worthwhile.\n\nThe place is small; expect a wait unless you're there early.

Instead, he excels at cutting technique, truly understands the importance of the right temperature for serving raw fish, and is incredibly consistent.

Firstly, it's one of the only sushi restaurants I've been to that's actually owned and managed by Japanese... a rare commodity. Secondly, the quality of the fish is outstanding. Their specials are delectable and are quite varied. Thirdly, they make tofu en premis, and it's outstanding! I'm neutral on tofu, it's not something I actively seek out, but it's their speciality, so I had to try it. We had the steamed tofu with the savory sauce (\"made directory in the cup\", it's right there in the menu, made me chuckle) and it was absolutely delicious: creamy, velvety, tasty, and the sauce (the last time I tasted that flavor was in a soba house in New York, any suggestions from anyone in the know?) was amazing, like drink-the-remnants-directory -out-of-the-cup amazing!\nWe're very lucky that the best sushi in town (so far) is right near our neighborhood!", "author": "Ramsey J."}

The Oboru at Eiji, I have to say was exceptional.   I WILL crave this tofu.  The special shoyu (soy sauce) they serve with the Oboru, I wish they would have left at the table, as I requested, but they did not... refused even, as the chef does not recommend using it with anything other than the oboru tofu.  When asking about dessert they only told us about the mochi ice cream, but I knew better (per other Yelp reviews) and asked for the coveted mochi strawberry.  The sushi was fresh, but was average in proportion... I could get better elsewhere.  Service was mostly good and friendly.  \n\nI should mention the Chirashi and Misonabe that my other dining companions ordered looked quite good, and they seemed to enjoy them quite a bit.  \n\nFor me though, the real deal is this...  come here solely for the tofu, appetizers, and mochi strawberry, they won't disappoint.

As per everybody's advice I made a reservation earlier today and besides a small wait (fewer than 10 minutes) our service was perfect. We had the famous tofu which was completely unexpected and awesome - it ought to be required that everyone try an order so you can experience it. The two of us split an order and it was more than enough to go around. I had the special - mackerel with pickled bitter melon - and it was also incredible. Wasn't a fan of the monkfish liver but I never am, so I think the fault there lies within me. The nigiri was so perfect and fresh that we ended up ordering a second round so we could try other types of fish. The uni was like eating a cloud. God knows there's a place in my heart for Westernized, deep-fried, stick-a-mango-in-it sushi, but everything here was simple, traditional, fresh and PERFECT. Finally when we thought we couldn't eat anything more, we tried the dessert. The cinnamon mochi wrapped ice cream with red bean sauce was so good and we thought there was no way it could be beaten - until we tried the strawberry mochi and it blew our minds. A++++ meal.

Can there ever be TOO many sushi places you may ask?  Not really, but I don't want to go to some bunk-ass place when I'm paying for, and more importantly in the mood for, good sushi.\n\nIf you're in the Castro and looking for a new sushi place--OR if you want to impress some date with your unique finds for choice restaurants, then head to Eiji.  But!  Make a reservation because this place is the quintessential hole in the wall that seats maybe 12 or 15 at best.\n\nI came here with a couple of foodie girlfriends.  And I'm SO pissed that I only discovered it now--I lived in the Castro for 2 friggin years and had no idea this little gem existed.  But I guess that's not really my fault since it's relatively new.\n\nWe came here because we heard that it was known for its homemade tofu and were curious.  Damn, that shit is good.  They devote an entire page of their menu to their tofu selection.  Knowing little to nothing about the intricacies of tofu-making, I deferred to our server (who was the cutest little elf-like man.  He was like the Japanese Peter Pan).  In fact, after we ordered the typical starters like wakame salad and edamame, we just asked him what we should get for the whole meal (\"of food,\"  W.F.) and were never disappointed.  From drinks (I think we only picked the beer out, which wasn't too hard since they only had one kind at the time) to dessert our Japanese Peter Pan (\"JPP\") scored big.\n\nWe got the oboru tofu to start, per JPP's suggestion.  Not only is it divine (ugh, did I really use that word?!) but it's a fun eating experience.  It comes in a big clay pot, has two serving spoons (one for the tofu, one for the liquid), 6 accoutrements (ginger, scallions, etc.) and a special soy sauce that is used specifically for this kind of tofu.  JPP said it serves 2-3--we were 3 and I think that it could have served 4 at least.\n\nThen we asked for the chef's choice for sashimi and good god.  Just do that.  Just go in and ask the chef to hand-pick the fish he thinks you should eat that night.  Silky, smooth and fresh.  Maybe I should date the chef.\n\nWe also tried the ceviche roll, which was pretty good--kind of a ceviche/salsa thing, which I'd never had before.  And we tried some different nigiri, per JPP, so clearly yummy.  Oh, JPP also suggested some sake, and when we asked what it was he just scurried away to present the bottle to us.  JPP is a man of few words, but sharp instincts.\n\nThen we asked JPP about dessert.  He went on and on about the mochi--he had us at \"I suggest.\"  Homemade strawberry mochi.  OMG.  I thought about it for weeks.  To the point where I'm not letting myself go back til I have another out-of-this world dining experience.

I purposely reserved for four because I knew the place was tiny and didn't want them to give us a larger table especially if I wasn't planning on bringing the car seat.

Liked it but would not recommend to everyone, esp for price, eep... steep\n* Eggplant with Walnut Miso = really yum, $6.25-ish though. Debating about whether the yum meets the price.

But then, who wants just an adequate meal?\n\nEiji is one of those sushi bars that has just the right combination of incredibly fresh fish, authentic feel, and creative dishes besides sushi that brought all together create an extra-ordinary meal. The sushi was delicious and fresh. The salmon had a wonderful texture, and the hamachi was simply delightful. The hamachi had just the right amount of firmness that when you bit into it, there was the slightest bit of resistance (a sign that it was incredibly fresh). The toro that came in the $25 assorted deluxe sashimi plate was just average, but that is to be expected. Great toro cost $25 for just one piece. The uni was very enjoyable and had that light flavor that is an indication of incredible freshness. But besides the sushi, the waiter recommended one of the specials of the day: broiled belt fish.

Goma-ae was good, although the portion size could have been larger. The asari saka-mushi was fine as well.

Staff are very friendly, and enthusiastic, decor is homely and cozy, and food is warm and tasty. \n\nNevertheless, the menu options are pretty limited and there just doesn't seem much to be offered here in terms of specialty or classic Japanese dishes that would warrant another return.

The seafood stew was also yummy, with fresh ingredients but not something I would go out of my way for. I enjoyed all the dishes, and felt satisfied at the end, but it didn't really feel worth the price. Aside from the sushi (which I'll touch upon later), there isn't real Japanese 'soul food' here to be had. \n\nSushi quality was good - good texture, good freshness. The negitoro (fatty tuna) roll didn't have that much fatty tuna, but I guess you can't expect much for $10.00 worth. Nevertheless, because the dishes here aren't really that special and the sushi is slightly overpriced with basic selection (although good quality), I would rather go to a different sushi house to eat only sushi. For example Sushi House in Alameda is a place where you can get fresh fish and a huge selection of decently priced rolls enough to fill you up. \n\nTo summarize, Eiji was definitely something different than all the izakayas, traditional Japanese cuisine, ramen houses, regional dishes that I had, but it's not really something worth cramping yourself in a small space, with long waits, difficult parking, limited menu, and listening to blaring Spanish music for. If you have plans in the area and feel like eating Japanese - be sure to make reservations ahead of time.", "author": "Lars B."}

I've always liked tofu, but I don't think I really new what tofu was all about until eating the oboro tofu here. it is made when you order it, and comes out warm. It is extremely mild and soft in that custardy comfort food kind of way. they serve it with a little plate of condiments (scallions, ginger, sesame seeds, etc) but I think its best plain. One dish is plenty for 2-3 people. \n\nIn terms of fish, the sashimi was top-notch. the rolls were nothing special, but if wild rolls with 8 kinds of fish and some crazy mayo are what you're after, you should go to Blowfish or something instead. Eiji is much more about high quality simplicity. \n\nDesert was a nice surprise. Everything on the menu involved red bean paste, which I used to think I didn't like, but Eiji has convinced me that I just don't like BAD red bean paste.

They'd mentioned some random small Japanese place that they first went to simply because there's a giant sign outside that says \"TOFU.\"\n\nI was a little skeptical, because I've never been a huge fan of tofu, but we got the oboro tofu at their recommendation.  Despite my meat-loving tendencies, I have to admit, it was pretty awesome.  It's super fresh (as in, it tastes freshly made... I don't mean to imply that it's \"fly\" all 90's style), and comes with an adorable little palette of garnishes that you can add.  I'd definitely recommend it, especially to those tofu skeptics out there (like myself).\n\nWe also got the yosenabe (?), which is kind of like a seafood casserole (not Japanese! don't yell at me if that's entirely incorrect!).  It was simple, but good and clean-tasting, and filling in that good way -- where you don't feel like a disgusting blob of fat afterward.  And we of course ended with the strawberry mochi dessert that everyone else talked about.  The strawberries were huge and really flavorful, and the red bean paste went really well with the other two flavors.  And I'm not a fan of red bean paste either, so I was impressed.\n\nI thought the place had a nice interior, though the tables were maybe a little close together.  I don't know too much about it, but it felt pretty genuine (when we asked about the difference between tuna belly and toro, our waitress was Japanese enough that she had to ask the chef how to say it in English, which was super cute).

I pretty much blew my load and ordered everything...The ankimo was buttery and sea-licous. The sawara (king mackeral) grilled with shiitake and sake put in a little hollowed out orange was amazing with just that hint of citrus from being partially cooked in the orange.

Located under trees on the corner of Sanchez and 16th, most people probably miss this gem. \n\nWhich is probably good since seating is so tight! A friend and I came in after a day of exploring up north, and were lucky to be seated in 10 minutes. There were plenty of \"reserved\" markers so be prepared to make that call. \n\nI'll cut to the chase: If you like your sushi/Japanese experience to be about rolls, sake and anything crunchy, then carry along to Tsunami or perhaps Osaka/Barracuda. If however you understand those poignant moments of perfection that mark Japanese culture at its best, then you must give Eiji a try.\n\nThe homemade Tofu is amazing. Rich, subtle, almost transcendental. The spinach appetizer, with the sesame dressing is another \"aha\" moment. Its presented to you tiny and garnished so delicately you're almost angry it cost $8.00. Then you go to eat it, and it unwraps like the best present ever. How they manage to pack so much spinach so tightly is one of life's better mysteries. \n\nThe fish is good, the specials are better. The Uni and Monkfish liver I had last time were perfect.

Second time I've been here...\n\nThe saba was some of the best I've ever had, which is saying quite a lot since I've been eating saba since I was 6 years old and pride myself on being quite the connoisseur. The uni was surprisingly good.\n\nMake sure you make reservations since it's small and fills up quickly. When I got there at 630pm it was relatively empty but by the time we left at 8pm it was packed and that was on a Tuesday night.\n\nThe reason I don't give them 5 stars is their bedside manner... If people are waiting and you are finished they are notorious for asking you to leave. And last night they had just a few sakura mochi left, which apparently are only in season during the springtime... So first I will set the stage. They recommended we try this type of mochi because they only had about 10 pieces left. We were hesitant, mainly because my friend does not \"love\" mochi but after some discussion we decided to split one. That was the beginning and ending of a 5 minute love relationship because the mochi actually WAS that good. The outside was not your typical mochi, pounded to oblivion (or whatever they do to mochi to make it look like dough). The outside of this was obviously rice, all held together with some kind of magic. The inside was red bean paste, YUM, my fav. Over the mochi was a shiso leaf that was either pickled or pressed or something to completely rob it of it's \"normal\" shiso flavor which was fine by me since I find the flavor often completely overwhelms the delicate potpourri of the rest of the food. The taste of this mochi was sweet AND salty, which is one of my favorite combinations - like that delicious dutch licorice. \n\nWe liked it so much we asked to split another, which was fine.... it was when I asked to buy one to take it home that I was reprimanded. \"ONLY ONE PER PERSON\" I was told sharply!! I realized at that moment that I was sitting at the mochi dealers and the first one was \"free\" (well $3 is almost free) but once you were hooked, that's all you gotz...!!!!\n\nMy friend thought it was hysterical but I did not. As a matter of fact I'm so \"for\" sharing that I often give what I have to someone else even if it's something I want... So even the fact that I'd asked to buy one to take home was a rarity for me. And I was immediately shot down. I have never been in a restaurant where I was refused when I asked to purchase something. I've actually been caught more than once where the chef has told me \"I'm sorry we've sold out of that\" and oh well if the table next to me had bought three of those, that's their prerogative. \n\nThese mochi balls were not even on the menu, they were on the counter right next to me - tempting me!!!! \n\nAnyway, in retrospect I kind of wish I'd never tasted them at all, then I wouldn't know what I was missing.

It's hidden away, it's intimate and well decorated, it's got that charm that I love to see in restaurants.\n\nThe food... wow, it was amazing.  We started off with their homemade tofu which was the best tofu I've ever had.  It just slides down your throat, it's so smooth.  I've never had tofu like that, and all you Yelpers are spot on.  You need to get these, you really do.  The sashimi was fresh and portioned well.  I've had good sashimi so many places, and this ranks right up there with it.  All in all, the portions are on the smaller side, but do what we did:  hit up Beard Papa's beforehand.   I love me some of those cream puffs ;o).\n\nThis is a fun, quiet place to go to.

It has a large free-standing red flag that boldly proclaimed \"TOFU\" but nothing else to beckon you in. \n\nUpon crossing the threshold, you almost feel like you're intruding. Small tables for 2 or 4 are huddled around the small restaurant, conducive to intimate conversation and maybe some footsie. They had 2 traditional Japanese flower arrangements to lend atmosphere to the place, but it's mostly just small and cozy -- a place where you can smell all the goodness cooking in the kitchen. \n\nThe service is attentive wiouithout being obsequious. Our server, a lady in her 60's who was both motherly and efficient,  was precise about food placement and prompt about re-filling our tea and water. Instead of bringing all our food out at the same time in an attempt to rush us out, she brought the plates out one by one and patiently waited for us to savor and finish our food before bringing out the next item. \n\nThe sashimi here was fresh, and they offered some fish that we hadn't had (raw) before, such as iwashi (sardine) and kohada (shad/herring). Their specials board boasted such dishes as Broiled Sake-Miso Cod, Ankimo (monkfish liver), White Meat Fish Carpaccio, Eggplant with Walnut Miso, and other intriguing items we didn't try. We had the sake-miso cod, which was perfectly-flavored and broiled. I was reassured that their \"Today's Specials\" were actually as advertised (unlike at many other places with specials written on whiteboards that were no longer erasable) when I saw a lady update it.\n\nThe most unique offering at Eiji is their tofu, which they make fresh daily. The cold tofu, according to some versions of their menu, is \"made directory in the cup.\" =P The Oboru Tofu is made fresh when you order it so we were able to observe the lady prepare it on a portable gas stove -- first warming the soymilk in a pot, testing the temperature by dripping some on her hand, and then pouring in vinegar to denature it. I've had fresh tofu at other places, and I love even packaged tofu, but it always amazes me how much better the fresh stuff tastes. It was served with condiments on the side, including home-made soy sauce, dried green onion, bonito, shiso, ground ginger, spicy radish paste, and sesame seeds.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the food and service at this place, I'm not sure they outweigh the prices. The small ~4 oz. serving of cod was $11.50, and the two kohada nigiri were $8. We ended up spending more than $40 for 2, which admittedly is not much for Japanese, but we left almost as hungry as when we got there.", "author": "Lillian L."}

The quality of their fish in general is top-notch. Their \"fresh\" tofu speciality is interesting and worth trying, though it's not something I felt the need to order the next time I came.\n\nThe only thing holding it back from 5 stars is that the service do not speak English well enough to avoid misunderstanding orders and reservations.

They told me that it's my kind of place - low key and cozy, with traditional sushi that would just melt in your mouth.  My first experience here was that.

After trying to get into Sushi Zone 2 nights in a row and not settling with a line of 14 groups in front of us, we decided that we would try something else around the neighborhood.  A friend looked this place up on Yelp for us and with 4.5 stars, we were all for it.\n\nFirst off, It smelled a little more fishy than I like my sushi restuaruants to smell.  The service was a little slow but very nice.  The prices were great for not too bad of sushi.  \n\nMy boyfriend found a bone in his AmberJack nigiri which wasn't cool.  My halibut nigiri had too much Wasabi hidden between the fish and the rice which completely masked the taste (and my enjoyment) of the actual fish.  \n\nThe ceviche roll with tomato was pretty good but I was expecting more...like ceviche and not just a slice of fish with a slice of tomato and a slice of onion.  \n\nThe rest of the rolls lacked creativity.  I want the mango and the jalepeno - ya know, interesting flavors that make sushi mind blowing.  I know these aren't \"real\" sushi ingredients but boy, they sure do add to the experience...", "author": "Leah B."}

We took our dear friend here for his birthday and enjoyed a little bit of everything from the menu.  Personally I had the Ankara(??) tofu - house made, the middle of three options, and it was so wonderful.  Like a savory (with sweet after tones) custard made of tofu.  To describe it a sliken tofu doesn't begin to capture the greatness, but you might get the idea.  I also had miso soup which for such a simple thing was also amazing, some of the best I've ever had.  and a spicy tuna roll.  \n\nOthers in my part had something ranging from your basic nigiri rolls to sashimi and everyone seemed pleased.  the wait staff was really attentive and helpful.  Our friend who speaks Japanese chatted with the waiter a bit and he was very engaged.  His sake recommendation was also AMAZING!  \n\nnothing but love for this little tiny gem that I will return to again!", "author": "Annalea I."}

It is definitely a level above your average Japanese restaurant.  None of that typical teriyaki or fried tempura or California roll nonsense, which I equate as \"fast-food\" Japanese.  At Eiji, this is more like the Japanese food that your grandmother would make, if you happened to have a Japanese grandmother who knows how to cook.\n\nSushi tastes fresh, and yes, the oboru tofu is worth a try.  I had some kind of cooked fish, maybe it was sea bass or halibut?  Can't remember but it was delicious where the meat felt so tender that it almost melts in your mouth.\n\nI'd want to give it 5 stars but I need to try it again, as it has been a while since I've been there.

I think the people are great and a few of the dishes I had were really wonderful, but I think a little massaging of the menu, portion size, and pricing is in order to get Eiji to the next level.\n\nThe Oboru tofu everyone soygasms over was definitely an interesting dish texturally, but not a ticket to cloud 9.  The flavor was too subtle, even with the nice array of condiments- and I LOVE tofu.\n\nThe ankimo and the white fish carpaccio tasted and looked beautiful, but were impossibly tiny and gone in an instant, which is sad, at these prices.\n\nOn the good side, the sake sashimi was the freshest I've ever encountered- really, it sort of made me wonder what sort of dank hole every other sushi place has been pulling their salmon from in comparison.  \n\nThe maki, though serviceable, were uninspired.\n\nHow do you quantify the worth of a dish?  Does a few bites of something wonderful equal a healthy portion of something a little less ethereal?  If you answered yes, then avail yourself of Eiji's specials- they are very tasty.  If you're really hungry, low on cash, or just plain not a foodie, steer clear.", "author": "George C."}

It is a small, friendly restaurant with a sparse, yet high quality, selection of sushi. I went there with two other people and our check came to 52 dollars; not bad at all. Everything I tried (Maguro, Hamachi, Kappa Makki, Spicy Tuna) was quite good. One person at my table got some sort of tofu, which Eiji touts, and said it was exceptional. Miso soup was good, although I didn't venture to try their \"Special Miso\" - a white, sake-flavored broth with salmon pieces in it. The standout item was their salmon skin roll: six pieces containing salmon, salmon skin, cucumber, and a thin slice of carrot, served warm.\nEiji is a great neighborhood sushi place, no doubt.", "author": "Jackson G."}

It's easily my favorite sushi spot in the city, with Sushi Zone, Kiss, and Sushi Time right up there.  You will love it.  The sushi is outstanding.  Skip the rolls (although they're good) and go with the authentic Japanese nigiri and sashimi.  It's perfection on a plate.  You must try the Oboro Tofu, too.  You've never had tofu like this.  It's like eating a cloud that you can season with shiso, ginger, daikon, sesame, and green onions.  I loved it, and you will, too.

However, I had such a terrible experience I will NEVER go back and will make it a point to tell people never to eat here.\n\nTwo friends (who live across) the street and I sat down about 15 minutes before closing (10p) for a late dinner.  The waitress sat us promptly and informed us that the kitchen would be closing soon so we'd have to order everything now.  Fine, we ordered a ton of sushi, a hamachi kama and a $40 bottle of sake.  Food came out quick as there was no one else in the restaurant.\n\nTowards the end of the meal I got a call from a friend who was visiting from the south bay.  I told him to stop by and help us finish the bottle of sake and then maybe join us for a beer at another bar.  \n\nHe came in and sat down...the waitress was just about to bring us a glass for him when a loud voice from the kitchen yelled...\"NO...WE ARE CLOSED!\"  It honestly scared the hell out of me, and realized that the owner was yelling at us.  \"WE ARE CLOSED.  HOW COME YOU SAID YOU ARE THREE AND NOW YOU ARE FOUR PEOPLE!!!!\"  \n\nI was shocked...my jaw hit the table.  I politely told him, \"Oh he's not eating, just wanted to sit and say hello as he's visiting.\"  The owner responded....\"I DON'T CARE!  WE ARE CLOSED!  YOU SAID THREE PEOPLE!\"  \n\nI didn't get this.  My friend wasn't eating anything, maybe having a glass of sake.  However, the owner couldn't get over the fact that having an extra person here somehow gave him extra work.  The poor wait staff had no idea what to do.  Things heated up pretty quickly at that point...we were telling him we did not understand his logic and we tried to be reasonable.  However, he wasn't \"getting it\" and we were done being yelled at.  He could have came over and explained this to us instead of yelling at the top of his lungs.  We asked for our bill and ate and drank as fast as we could.  I was embarrassed in front of my good friend who then felt so bad for getting us yelled at.  The poor waitress, she obviously felt bad for us by the expression on her face.  We almost didn't leave a tip until we were assured by the staff that the owner DID NOT get any of the tip.  After all, the wait staff was NOT at fault.\n\nAs we were getting up to leave we said, we were so disappointed because this was one of our favorite places to eat.  My two friends who live across the street ate here almost every week.  We told him that this was a terrible way to treat customers and that I would write a bad Yelp review and tell all of our friends how badly he treated us.  He replied, \"THANK YOU.  PLEASE TELL EVERYONE NOT TO EAT HERE. PLEASE DO THAT.\"  This pissed me off but at this point, it was no longer worth wasting my breath.  After we closed the door, we could hear the owner yelling at his staff.\n\nMy parents owned a restaurant and I've eaten in hundreds of restaurants from inexpensive to pricey places.  To this very day I have NEVER been treated so poorly ever in my life than I did at Eiji, by the owner no less.  Eiji is by no means a \"cheap\" sushi joint and we we did not just order one roll to split...our bill was over a $100 for the three (or maybe four) of us.  I just can't fathom why the owner would raise his voice to us like he was scolding his children.\n\nIn short, this guy does not deserve to have people eat at his establishment.  He obviously has the attitude \"I can treat people poorly, so what, they'll keep coming back.\"  In tough economic times like this, I hope we can all give him a big middle finger by not eating at his restaurant.\n\nI highly recommend Daimaru which is catty corner to Tangerine...the service is great and you won't get yelled at by the owner.", "author": "Clifton T."}

I used the Yelp.com mobile function, and low and behold, found a great sushi place called Eiji.  Four stars, numerous accolades, and glowing reviews, my friend and I knew we had to stop here.\n\nIt's tucked really away from everything, a quiet spot with a big sign that says TOFU on one side, SUSHI on the other.  We sat at a 2-top, and immediately ordered the hot and cold tofu options.  While the tofu was super smooth and had a hint of sweetness from the sauce, we were not overly impressed.  I mean it's tofu, sometimes overlooked, and possibly for good reason.\n\nWe both ordered the Regular Sushi, which had a combination of a tuna roll and sushi selected by the chef.  Each piece was really tender, smooth (I love this word!), and no note of fishy flavor.  You must not miss the ceviche sushi, which has a bite of jalapeno, topped with a cherry tomato.  \n\nMy only dissatisfaction came from the tofu (although theoretically speaking, this might be a favorite for vegetarians and when you're sick) and HUGE GAP in price between the Regular sushi option ($14.95) and the Deluxe sushi option ($26.95), which only had 4 more pieces of sushi than the regular.\n\nGo to relax.

Tiny and cozy place. Ordered tofu, salmon sashimi, eggplant, sushi, amongst others, which were all delicious. Authentic enough I was planning on bringing my mother here on her next visit. The service was just fine to this point. So far so good, right?\n\nI then invited my friend (a fourth to our party) to join us since I thought she'd enjoy the place. (She was also having a tough night and needed a friend.) Granted it was nearing closing time, but we'd just ordered a ton of food and were going to be there a little while longer whether or not she came. She comes to join us, at which point a man who I think is the owner/chef comes out to our table, leans in, and tells her she can't sit there for whatever reason. Honestly thought he was joking. He then begin lecturing her on how out of line she had no right to be there, claiming that he was not \"in the business of letting in people who could be homeless\" into their store if they weren't going to eat. (she looked nicer than the rest of us.) We were in complete awe, in disbelief of what an utter jackass this man was being. Not wanting to create any more of a scene or upset my friends, I tell the him that she can order her something if she needed to. At which point he tells us that \"we're closed, she can't order anything.\" He spoke to my friend as though she was dirt. Utterly unbelievable. \n\nSince the man has absolutely ruined our evening, made all of us completely uncomfortable, angry and unhappy, we asked for our check so that we can leave this awful, miserable place. The man then tells us that we'd already ordered so we couldn't leave until we had our food. Wouldn't let my friend stay, and wouldn't let us leave. (Mind you, the place was half empty so we were by no means taking up any additional seats, nor were staying any later than we would have had my fourth friend not joined us.) WTF. We all just wanted out of there at that point. But NO. He comes back out just to yell at my friend even more, going on and on. He would not let it go. Appalled, I had to tell him that that was ENOUGH and he needed to leave us alone. UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE. \n\nThis was THE single most unpleasant dining experience I have had in my whole entire life. Finding a fucking cockroach in my food would have been a significantly more pleasant experience than the one we had at Eiji. And you know what? While I would have very much liked to have thrown my last order at this guy's face and left, we ended up tipping them well. 1) Because my other friend frequents that place, and 2) because the two servers were nice and it wasn't their fault that the owner was a mad jackass. This upset me more, but I hope this shows you that we're all good and respectable patrons.\n\nYou must be kidding me with your elitist sushi-nazi shit. The place isn't nearly that good.

Hubby and I were looking for a new great sushi restaurant to try out to night. We were in the mood for healthy food. He found Eiji on Yelp. 287 reviews and 4  1/2 stars. Pretty darn good for a neighborhood restaurant. I am one of those that pout and put up an unhappy face when I have an unhappy meal. You can tell if I like the food by the look on my face. When we were waiting for our check, hubby looked at me and asked, \"Did you find a new fave tonight?\" I smiled to answer him. \nEiji has many interesting dishes for inexpensive prices. The food is fresh and well prepared. Here are some of the items we manage to try tonight.\n1. Fatty Tuna Steak - Served on some greens with a light sauce. The fish was cooked just right and soft. (~$8.5)\n2. Uni - You guys know how much I love Uni from my Nijiya Market's review. The uni here is definitely top notch. If you are a big uni fan, you have to order it at Eiji.\n3. Salmon skin roll - Good. I think they add cucumber and carrots to add some crunchiness. $4.5\n4. Spicy white Tuna roll - Good especially for $4.5.\n5. Homemade cold tofu - Soft and smooth like baby ass. Have to try this dish.

Every thing we ordered was so sweet, fresh, and buttery.  It's what good sashimi is all about.  I would definitely come back here and just order their sashimi.  Everything else was good, but their fish is their shining star.\n\nIt was a cold and windy May night, so we ordered the Misonabe to warm our tummies.  This stone pot of seafood miso soup was really yummy.  The miso soup was sweetened with rice wine and tasted very different from what you're usually served at Japanese restaurants.  The seafood variety included shrimp, mussels, clams, squid, and salmon.  I would definitely order this again.  The Tako Sunomono salad we ordered was okay, just some blanched octopus on a bed of cucumber salad.  For raw fish, we ordered Aji (Spanish mackerel) sashimi and a Ceviche Roll (made with hamachi).  The sashimi and the fish in the sushi were amazingly fresh, but I would stick with sashimi next time.  Their rolls aren't very innovative and don't leave much to be desired.  They are small in size too.  Even after eating all of this, we were curious to try the Oboro Tofu after seeing everyone around us ordering this unique dish.  And how could you not order the tofu when there's a huge TOFU banner displayed in front of the store?  The execution of this dish is really interesting, with all of the condiments and utensils.  Overall, we decided it wasn't our cup of tea.  I have loved tofu for all of my life, but this type of tofu was different.  Very soft, but not very smooth, nor flavorful.  And the condiments didn't add much to it.  I'm sure I might be offending some people here, but I think I'll stick to the packaged stuff.   It was worth trying nonetheless, since it's their specialty here.  And of course we had to end our meal with the mochi-covered strawberry.  It was damn good!  \n\nThe service was okay, but we were under the impression that our server was working her first day on the job because she was extremely nervous.  Every time she came over to clear our dishes, her hands were shaking.  And as everyone has mentioned, this place is tiny.  20 seats max.  I highly suggest you go early in the evening, around 6-6:30pm.  We called to make a reservation on our way there, and when we got there, the place was pretty empty at 6pm.

Eiji is good across the board.  And as others have noted GET THE OBORO TOFU, which they will cook up on it's own burner at the server counter upon order.

Two weeks later I brought some friends from out of town who were dying to try the mochi after I explained it to them. It was a Monday at 1pm and the restaurant was dead. I asked for 5 mochi to go. The waitress, in a deadpan annoyed way, said they don't give mochi to people who don't order food. Fine, so even though we had all just eaten Ike's sandwiches, we said we'd order some food to go.  Then she said they didn't serve mochi as takeout. So THEN we had to SIT DOWN and order food in order to get the mochi. Before she would seat us, she asked to make sure we would ALL be ordering food. For god sakes, the restaurant was EMPTY. I said yes, as long as it was ok that my 2 year old and 5 year old were allowed to share! \n\nSo after finishing our 2nd lunch, we ordered 8 mochi for the 5 of us. The same waitress said there was a mochi quote of only 1 per person. At this point I was ready to say f*ck the mochi, but it was that good that I managed to stay calm, eat my 1 alloted mochi, and leave.\n\nAfter that I was so desperate to find an alternative strawberry mochi place that after much googling, my friends and I now go to Benkyodo in Japantown (http://www.benkyodocompany.com/).

Now, I separate Eiji from \"favorite sushi restaurant\" (which is Koo) because Eiji is genuinely unique relative to other Japanese restaurants in SF.  Firstly, the menu reads a bit more like a culinary tour of Japan, especially the specials board from which I primarily compose my order.  They house make their tofu every day and it is divine.... and you've likely never had anything quite like it.  The green tea smoked duck breast is on the menu often and is absolutely killer.  Any of their preparations of the raw stuff are top notch... but one must also try the many unique cooked dishes along with the sushi to really appreciate this place.  Also, save room for dessert because they often have house made strawberry mochi and purple potato youkan... but the best has to be the green tea ice cream wrapped in house-made cinnamon mochi and topped with red bean sauce.  It is beyond killer!  Everything is served as small share plates which should satisfy the current San Francisco craze for \"tapas style.\"  Definitely go with a friend to get the best sampling of the menu.  But, the place is TINY, so don't try to bring everybody in your family tree to dinner here (like this group of 12 tried to do the other night I went there... rightly the owners went, \"are you nuts?\" and sent them away).  Save this place for a few of your good close friends that have a penchant for adventure... you'll honestly think you've landed at a hidden gem deep in the quiet neighborhoods of Tokyo... but you haven't even left SF.", "author": "Chris P."}

Other than saying that it's tofu at some stage prior to being a block (think silken and then step back a bit) I cannot explain what it is or why it is so friggin' tasty.  Like that matters.  Hot in a soup bowl, it is served with a super secret special soy sauce and a selection of toppings (grated ginger, sliced shiso leaves, sesame seeds, bonito flakes and a couple other things I don't remember).  See pengrin..'s 'fresh tofu' pic.  Per server instructions, the way to go was to try it first with just the soy sauce and then again with various toppings.  Per my instructions, the way to go is with just a bit of the soy sauce.  Tofu.  I just wanted to say it again.\n\nIf Eiji was only about tofu it would hands down be a 5 star restaurant.  But tofu alone does not an Eiji meal make.  To do that you need to add in some sushi.  While I thoroughly liked the hotate, toro, and rock n roll I found the maguro and hamachi to be just average.  Good fish but not great and at best average size pieces.  Yet greatness was on the horizon in the form of dessert.  See reese w.'s 'Mochi covered strawberry dessert' pic and then think about all that is good, right and addictive in the world.  Though more of the 'It's not dessert without chocolate' ilk I would never, as in not ever, turn down this dessert!\n\nSo you have reasons to go but what else matters?  To start, know that this is a very small place.  I'd be surprised if capacity is above 30 people.  Also, the service is very good.  That's not to say that it was perfect.  When we asked to keep the tofu soy sauce for our sushi we were denied under the guise that the chef recommends the regular soy sauce (though I suspect the special stuff was just too expensive).  And after eating we were fairly promptly presented with our bill followed by, a couple of minutes later, a request that we pay so a waiting party could have our table (even though it was sort of late and a bunch of people were about to clear out).  And we had to ask for the strawberries as they were not included in the dessert options offered by the server.  But those were just minor events that didn't detract from the experience.

Now, I noticed that there are many people who were not as impressed, especially those who tried the sweet chinese tofu \"douhua\".   You have to understand that the coagulant used to make japanese and chinese tofu is inherently different.   Also, many chinese restaurants may add a little agar to smooth the tofu texture out; so it's like comparing apples and oranges.  \n\nThe only thing I would question is whether they make the soy milk themselves.  The tofu is clearly homemade, but I'm note sure if the milk is made from scratch.\n\nI had mixed feelings about the sushi.  The premium stuff was absolutely delicious- chu-toro and uni.  I was surprised that the more basic fish were just ok- the tuna, grouper, and yellowtail were not impressive at all.  I liked the fresh shrimp, but my wife thought it tasted too fishy.

The rice was fresh, and warm and the tuna was good.\n\nWe got there right before closing, so we had the restaurant to ourselves, which added to the ambience.\n\nOnly downside is that the place had a fairly strong fishy smell, but I guess that would be difficult to avoid in a small closed space. \n\nWould go back here again if I didn't want standard Japanese food.", "author": "Nick K."}

I wholeheartedly thank my friend for luring me here for its reknowned homemade tofu. Eiji is one of the rare SF restaurants that offers tuna chunks soaked in slimy yamakake, my favorite! Any of the specials hand written on the board like tuna carpaccio and creamy monkfish liver, are always a fish purist's thrill.\n\nThe crowd pleaser is definitely the homemade strawberry surrounded by red bean paste wrapped in a thin layer of sweet mochi. The last time I went with a friend, I was looking forward to this evening highlight. There were a dozen left and thought about putting in my dessert order later. Half an hour later, I glance over at the dessert plate, and there are 2 left. I tried to get the waitress's attention, and somehow two aggressive patrons were able to get the last two. One of the patrons that cut in his order sat at the table next to mine. I began an immediate, immature death glare, and he shirked in his chair. I felt awful for being passive aggressive, but I felt someone stole a significant gasp of air from me. The sweet patron split the tiny mochi four ways between us all. I was pleasantly surprised by his gentlemanly gesture, and he renewed my faith in humanity again. Peace has been reinstated. Gan-bei!", "author": "Cathy H."}

Try your best not to blink, because you'd be missing a gem of a Japanese restaurant in the heart of SF.  The restaurant is tiny (maybe capacity for 20 patrons or less).  I was encouraged immediately when I could hear Japanese spoken by the other patrons and among the waitstaff.  Too many sushi joints are run by Chinese and Koreans, so I was hopeful about this place. Everyone has said it before, and I won't hesitate to say it again, the homemade tofu which was prepared right before us because we were seated by the bar was silky and smooth.  With all of the seasonings like ginger, dried bonito,  sesame seeds and more.  We also had the special miso soup with salmon and some interesting vegetables and it was definitely special and almost buttery in it's flavor from the salmon.  Then it was on to the sushi which was very fresh.  We were a bit disappointed that they didn't have any uni, but the salmon, cobia, hamachi, tuna and caterpillar roll were all good.  I liked that the caterpillar roll wasn't drowning in unagi sauce like a lot of places.  You could actually taste the eel.  We were stuffed but staring us in the face all night on the counter was this plate with a cute sign calling out to us \"Homemade Mochi Strawberry\".   UH-MAY-ZING.  There were like only 3 left.  We split one not knowing what to expect and it was some of the best mochi I have ever had, including Japan.  It was this giant, plump,, sweet, red strawberry covered in a thin layer of azuki bean paste and wrapped in a thin skin of mochi.  Next time I'm getting my own.  I heard they run out of these if you go to late.  \n\nThis place has rocketed to the top of my sushi restaurant list for San Francisco.

The latter most likely applies. I've must of been on hard-core smack. How could I have been so off the mark on this place. This restaurant has become one of my favorite Japanese haunts in The City. Check it out, it's well worth it.  \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nI have been forever passing  this place for quite some time, but my timing has been off because they always seem to be closed. Therefore, I have made it a point to check this place out and indulge in some serious Japanese dining. For the most part, both of my experiences were not all that bad. They make their own tofu which I guess is sorta cool. Although I find that items like tofu take up too much space on the table and in my belly for that matter. I would much rather save the room for raw flesh. Which brings me to the nigiri, very  small and a couple of the varieties (Kohada & Sawara) could have been better/ less sullied. I liked the fact that they have an extensive array of items and a couple of them are rather good. For instance, the Ankimo appetizer was excellent, as well as the Kinmedai sashimi. The atmosphere is quaint, but I felt that it lacked character and coupled with the high price point, made my experience a tad bit jaded. But the ambiance is not the primary reason why I dine at a particular establishment (although it helps). I am going to have to come back one more time, just to be sure. Until then, I will leave you with this less than stellar review. I hope it suffices because I really want to like this place.", "author": "Gabe T."}

Great miso (especially asari miso - my FAVORITE!!!), which is another guide to how good a sushi place is from what I've been taught. It shows the chef's dedication to preparation and little details. The tofu is incredible, as far as tofu goes (I'm not a big tofu fan, but even I had a few spoonfuls with the special soy sauce, which was super yum in and of itself). The Sake-Miso Black Cod was very good; I've had better (i.e. Chiso in Seattle, Ozumo in SF), but this was simple, tender, fatty, and delectable. The special toro was like butter. The service was mostly great - pleasant, helpful, polite, attentive -  though I had a tough time getting my water glass refilled and they got one of our Maki rolls wrong. Overall, one of the better classic, unadulterated sushi experiences I have had in SF. We'll definitely be returning.\n\nSide note: Myself and some other Seattle transplants (including Japanese and Korean friends) are on a hunt for sushi as good as we got in the Emerald City and Vancouver, B.C. Who knew we were so spoiled? Our search is still in its infancy, so I'm sure there are some fabulous gems left for us to discover.

The service also left much to be desired...the waitresses suggestions for dishes to order were disappointing (really, a fish head?) and they were also out of this mythical strawberry mochi so we didn't get to try it at all.

Understandably, I was very excited after all the hype. This is what we ordered:\n\n1. Anake tofu - overly salty, not much tofu flavor and boring\n2. Tuna belly steak - extremely salty, ruined a nice cut of fish by overcooking it and drenching it in soy\n3. Nigiri special - Boring, cliche sushi plate with the usual staples - many of the pieces were tendony which I wasn't too surprised at given that it was a set\n4. Poke roll - boring, uninspired\n\nHere's where I get to the worst part. We ordered Amberjack, Aji, and Sake, some of my favorite fish in any restaurant. I was very excited and decided to save them for last. One thing I should have noticed, though, was the large side of color on the sides of all of the fish, signaling a tough, tendony, poor cut of fish.\n\nI took one bite...UGH!!!!! I spit it out immediately...it was so tough and stringy/tendony as to be completely unedible and unchewable (worse than octopus which should be chewy!!!) This was the case for the amberjack and aji, which were their \"specials\". I informed the waiter, who looked confused and went to ask the chef. When he returned, he had the audacity to say that the chef had said that chewiness is a sign of a \"fresh\" fish.\n\nNow I am not a sushi chef, but I have been to many many top sushi restaurants in the Bay Area, and when I go to a small sushi place I always get the amberjack and aji specials...it has never ever ever tasted like that. I looked online everywhere, where I found that \"sushi, besides octopus and squid\" should never be chewy and tough. It was terrible.\n\nOne more thing - they had suspiciously put down one of my items 2x on the bill...when I informed him, he came back a little while later and said that he had added up the total correctly, just accidentally wrote one entry 2x. Now how does that happen, I wonder?\n\nOn the plus side, the $1.75 for the daifuku was cool - not worth the money but at least it was well executed.", "author": "Catherine H."}

I found all the above at Eiji.  The place is small and easily missed which just adds to its charm as a place to discover.  Decorated to resemble a rural Japanese shop, Eiji reminds me of the old shops of Kyoto.   The food and experience is one that even in Japan in difficult to find these days.  It was a Zen experience to eat the tofu dishes, which are homemade and beautifully presented.  Sushi was fresh and the various grilled fish equally well done.  There is also an eclectic sake collection.  Eiji is not cheap.  But anything more authentic will require you to fly to Japan.", "author": "Andrew C."}

(The second one on the menu that starts with an \"A.\")   It was warm, had this wonderful sauce---very good with the supplied shiso, green onion and ginger condiments.\n\nBroiled sake-miso cod.   Very, very good.  Perfectly cooked, slightly more on the underdone side.  So luscious and tasty.\n\nMisonabe.  A seafood casserole with miso soup.  It took a while to get to the table, but the seafood was cooked perfectly.  Not a piece of shrimp, oyster, mussel or salmon was overdone.  The napa cabbage soaked up all the wonderful broth.  I kept fishing for it even though I was full.\n\nCeviche roll.  Very, very good.  Very little soy sauce needed---it has a wonderful sweet, sour, vinegary kick on its own.\n\nStrawberry mochi.  It's a strawberry, lovingly covered with a layer of red bean paste and mochi.  I am allergic to strawberries, but I couldn't resist.  It was definitely worth it.", "author": "G H."}

I heard about their fantastic strawberry mochi and *had* to come here and try it. The original plan was take out (2 sleeping kids in the car with hubby) - hubby called in sushi order and the guy on the phone said you can't get mochi to go, hubby suggested i eat the sushi there since the kids were asleep anyway. What the server meant was that you couldn't order it - it's their \"fortune cookie\", that is you only get it at the end of the meal if you eat there. So i had them put the order on a plate, have them serve me tea, and ate my part of the sushi. asked them to pack the other half for hubby, all so i could get my mochi (wasn't sure if they were going to give it to me or not since i made them repack my sushi even though i spent $40). The mochi was delish, though my strawberry had gone bad (it was effervescent). And I snuck the other half into a napkin and into my pocket when the server was doing my bill. I ordered sake, hirame, uni, aji, inari. i will come back and EAT IN. Then i can try their tofu too! Hope they don't remember me as the troublemaker. 0:)", "author": "Cammy H."}

Saw this one was highly rated as well as having fresh mochi and tofu made in house so thought I'd give it a try. The sushi was pretty good but I've definitely had better. It was by no means bad though and I wouldn't hesitate to go again if I was in the area. Also tried their house made tofu which was really interesting, I've never tasted tofu that was so flavorful. They serve it in a broth with daikon and bonito and the usual accompaniments. It was good but again I don't know if I'd go out of my way to get it again. What I would go out of my way to get is their fresh made mochi. I had the strawberry and the chestnut flavor and man was it good. It's unlike any mochi I've ever had. Soft, sweet and flavorful with this wonderful chewy texture. And the filling is delicious as well, not overly sweet and complements the mochi texture.

Anyway, so basically, their appetizers were alright (eggplant was good but I also love nasu dengaku in general) and their sushi for the most part was alright too but their uni was gross. For me, uni either melts in my mouth and puts me in a happy place or I have to spit it out because it makes me want to barf. The service was really really great though, super friendly and all.

Eiji is a small little restaurant where it  could only fit about people 20 in there max so I wouldn't try to bring in a big birthday crowd. Only reason why I gave it a 3 start instead of 5 is because my buddies and I were a pack of hungry wolves and we left as a pack of starving wolves. The portion was small and wasn't filling at all for the price. $17 a head for the tofu, 4 rolls, and the deluxe sashimi. It felt like we had only ate some appetizer and walked off.  It is a place if you want a quick snack, but don't go there for a real dinner. As for the fresh tofu, definitely try it out for the first time to taste the texture and slight sweetness of it.

I originally wanted to take her to Sushi Zone on Pearl St., but knew waiting outside in the rain for an hour isn't how we wanted to spend our evening. I remembered the little sushi place on Sanchez St. @ 16th that used to be Ibisu and was now Eiji. I hadn't been there since the old man who owned it passed away last year and decided to give it a shot, hoping it was as good as I had remembered. We walked in and almost felt like we had walked into someone's home. The restaurant was warm, the air smelled sweet and my stomach was excited. We started with some sake and edammame to tide us over until our sushi was ready. We ordered toro nigiri (fatty tuna), scallop nigiri, salmon nigiri, spicy tuna roll, salmon/avocado/cucumber roll, and eggplant roasted with a miso-walnut sauce. Everything was incredible. The fish was fresh, the vegetables crisp and sweet. I had never actually had toro and I now see what I had been missing. It literally melted in my mouth. I can honestly say that was some of the best $10 I have recently spent. The spicy tuna roll was the best I've ever had. The tuna was mixed with a little bit of jalapeno and wasn't drowned in a mayonnaise-y sauce. The walnut in the miso sauce was a great compliment and was delicious with the earthiness of the eggplant. Our bill came to just under $60 and it was worth every dollar. I will definitely be going back to this little gem and would recommend it to friends or dates.", "author": "Ariel D."}

Bluegrass as playing on the radio, which brought back all the good vibes of the Bluegrass festival last weekend.  It was a perfect Sunday Sushi experience.  Until, my dad took out his computer to look at some drawings that I had emailed to him that he couldn't open.  The sushi chef, from back in the kitchen yells out, \"No computers!\"  My dad looks up says \"What?  Why not?\"  The chef say \"Because I don't like them!\"  My dad had that \"What the hell kind of answer is that!\" look as the chef was glaring over the counter, and I had scenes from Seinfeld going through my head...' No Sushi for You!\"  Of course the computer had to take time to shut down before it could be put away, the chef watching the whole time, it was a stand-off, Sushi Chef vs. Slow Processing Computer.  finally, the computer went away, the chef was happy and we had a great lunch.

The restaurant is small so reservations are recommended. Our waitress was very friendly and provided good service.  We came right when it opened at 5:30pm on Saturday and there were several tables reserved and walk-ins were accomodated but with some wait.  We had a lot of the fresh fish that was just amazing - I'm not normally a fan of Uni but it was so good I wanted to order a 2nd serving but refrained so I could try their hot dishes. I highly recommend trying their tofu  - my favorite is the Ankake in a small clay dish that was warm. We also had the Oboru tofu. which is the freshly made on the spot one, it's more plain tasting but comes with lots of toppings for flavor. One appetizer my husband and I really liked was the firefly squid...such a small portion but bursting with flavor. We spent about $100 for the both of us for nigiri, hot apps, tofu, salad, and sake. We did not have any rolls and ordered straight off the specials menu except for the tofu and a Kelp salad. When I was there, someone made a negative comment on the $10 minimum for dine-in, this is definitely not unreasonable and easily met by ordering 1-2 items. May of the special nigiri and hot appetizers were about $8-10 an item anyway. Another Yelper mentioned their food descriptions on the menu do not really do the food justice, I agree b/c the \"starchy\" sauce on the tofu was really a delicious, light tasting soy/miso flavored sauce. Basically come here for very good Japanese food, don't come here for Bento Boxes or Special Rolls you see at standard sushi places, and ignore all the mispellings on their menu.", "author": "Mellie D."}

The second time I went the food was still good, but the fish wasn't as good as the first time. I might have to make a few more visits to fully assess the consistency & quality of this place. However, I'd have to say I'm pretty satisfied by this place and LOVE how they are TRUE to their reservations. Every single time they always reserve your table for you...that's AMAZING service. I hate going to sushi restaurants and waiting for 2 hrs to eat (*cough cough - Sushi Zone*). ONE LAST THING - I LOVE THE STRAWBERRY MOCHIS. EAT EM UP. Not AS good as Benkyodo, but I like the fact that it is a WHOLE strawberry. DELISH! Bon Appetit!", "author": "Jeannette L."}

The place is small and cozy which I like, but what really turned me off was that the waitress tried to rush us out the minute we signed the bill. There was only one other party of 2 waiting and they were not waiting long. I had not even finished my food yet. It did not seem very Japanese. They would never do this at Sushi Zone. People don't mind waiting if the food is worth it and if they know they can have a calm dinner where they can take their time.", "author": "Jan M."}

Oboro tofu was fun but it reminded me of the soft tofu + sugar water dessert at dim sum places, only there it is $2 and here it is $9. The atmosphere was small and cute and a little like Tokyo (except for the American music). Sushi was good but Angel Fish is better. A nice place to visit once in a while for a change of pace.", "author": "Sarah J."}

Parking was easy and location was easy to get to, but I have DEF had better sushi. They don't serve chicken teriyaki or tempura, so if you have a friend that isn't into all that crazy sushi, DONT BRING THEM HERE. Server was nice and friendly and the sushi was good, but not the best. Oh and they also don't use real crab...cali rolls aren't the same if they don't have real crab. Keep searching on yelp, I am sure you will find a better sushi restaurant.", "author": "Katie F."}

After making a reservation, and arriving a few minutes early, we were told there was no table.  There was in fact, an empty table (that seated 4, we were 2).  When we suggested that we would sit at the bar, and move once a table opened up, the hostess said that wouldn't be possible.  After waiting 15  minutes, we deciede to leave, and ate at the sushi bar across the street.  THAT place had excellent service, and great food.  Two thumbs down for Eiji.", "author": "bruce b."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-02-27", "description": "If i could give this place less stars i would. I have eaten at Eiji several times and was pleased. However, I had a very special guest in town and wanted to go there with a few friends. I called 1 week in advance to make reservations. The woman on the phone told me that she couldnt hold a table for that night bc it was friday and to just come a little early. No problem. So i had my few friends get to town early from work- we got there at 6pm. I walked in and asked for a table and the waitress said 'sorry there is no room for you because another party has a reservation.' Well i tried making reservations... she proceeded to basically call me a liar and that i didnt call a week ahead of time to make a reservation and rudely laughed at me when i tried explaining that we would wait for the next party that had a reservation to leave. \"NO\" was all we got. i even told her that we would come back later that night just so we could eat there. Still 'NO' Fully insulted and very hurt we walked  to the very nice sushi house across the street. Crisis averted. I will say that at one time i really liked Eiji, but i will never eat there again because without good service or even average common manners to talk to people nicely the food you serve isnt worth crap. Learn some manners Eiji. And even though you seat 12 people total you can still get too big for your britches.", "author": "Mellow Y."}
