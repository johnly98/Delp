The meat in the wonton soup had obviously gone bad. A quick bite out of it and i could tell that it wasn't \"fresh\" anymore.\n* Customer service level: Let's put it this way, when i called in & offered a reasonable resolution to my problem (ie. willing to wait an exorbitant amount of time *3 hours* for my dinner for the promise of rice, that was NOT included) the girl on the phone accepted that offer & countered it with an additional $3 charge.\n\nhere's the long & short version of the story:\nI work graveyard & my co-workers and I have been to this place before so i figured it was a safe bet. \nStandard order & apparently it my fault for \"ass\"uming that a side of white rice would come with the entrees, however I did put a comment on the online order that would have triggered some kind of action. \nPlaced order at 10:30pm\nQuoted delivery time: 11:35pm - 11:45pm.\nWaited until 11:55pm to call - it rang multiple times then rerounted to a fax called again at 12:02am - went through this process & was told that \"it's on it's way\"\n\n12:30am THE DELIVERY SHOWS UP. NO RICE, SOUP was spilled.\nIn my attempt to give this place the benefit of the doubt I called up the restaurant & of course I got just as bad attitude, attempting to place me at fault. Apparently this place just can't handle constructive criticism & had the nerve to accept my offer for a reasonable resolution to counter with a cheap trick and wanted to charge me.\n\nSO: \n1) 5 hours is what I was going to have to wait in order to eat a meal. 1 of those hours is your expected delivery time. OK Fine. but to charge me $3 for not only a cup of rice but to wait an additional 4 hours - SERIOUSLY!?!?!\n2) Blaming me that I didn't order rice & so now it's an inconvenience for you to pick up the phone in attempt to possibly up my order an additional $10 bringing the grand total of a meal for 1 up to $30. ARE YOU SERIOUS?! a simply phone call...\n3) The FOOD had gone beyond it's expiration date & then....THEN\n4) The claim that they are SO BUSY they are unable to deliver another meal my way is just RUDE for rice when I've already paid for a $20 dinner, but you'll offer me a discount??...OMG.\n\nI will say this -  Yelpers will NOT be the only ones to hear about this review.", "author": "Riz B."}

Last night, however, was a total disaster. So bad, in fact, I don't think I'll ever be ordering from them again. The food was expensive ($40 for three dishes), the order arrived incomplete, omitting my free item for an order over $35 completely, what was there was ridiculously small in size for what their charging, it tasted literally like MEDICAL WASTE, and the service was atrocious.\n\nThe driver was obviously lost and my house is extremely easy to find. After arriving somewhere in the ~2-HOUR range, after a hideously long wait, and a rude phone call asking for me to come outside to get my food as opposed to the driver coming to my door (WTF??!!), the driver hung up on me mid-sentence. Then, after finally finding my place, just handed (more like dumped) the bag of food with me, and without even asking me if I needed anything else or if I was satisfied, just spun around and ran back to his car. Some way to treat a customer guys!\n\nThen, we get the food inside, only to find our soup we asked for was missing. I ordered brown rice, and got white steamed rice instead. What else was there, was small. VERY small. And then then final horror; the HIDEOUS FLAVOR. There were mostly green beans in our three mushroom dish, but what was there definitely had a plastic 'sharps syringe' medical waste box flavor to it, the rice noodles in our mongolian beef were literally glued together in a massive mound at the bottom, and there was about an ounce of beef in there anyway that also tasted like plastic. The kung-pao prawns and scallop dish had shrimp in it (know what your calling a prawn please at least people, I mean really!!), there were only about 5 or 6 of both in there anyway, with mostly green bell peppers and onions to take up space and make it seem like there was something besides just the vegetables in there to eat.\n\nWhat a s**t hole!! I wish there was a negative-star option and a quick refund button. If I knew I wasn't going to waste half a day and a lot of stress, I might actually try to get a refund for this outrage.", "author": "Yuri G."}

I ordered like I would any other chinese delivery service but after hanging up I noticed an entire Szechuan section - realizing my error I called them back and changed my main to \"Szechuan spicy boiled fish fillet\".\n\nWhile this is no Z&Y, this was really solid for delivery. The fish fillets were lightly breaded and fried and the szechuan oil was really tasty and solid and it was accompanied by baby bok choy and some thinly sliced bamboo shoots (no bullshit cabbage or american broccoli here). While i could do with more of the \"ma\" it was sufficient and the \"la\" aspect was fiery.   \n\nI am excited that I can get szechuan delivery (looks like they deliver througout the city and beyond) I look forward to trying the other Szechuan dishes like the tripe w/blood pudding and their mapo dofu.  I did not see any dan-dan noodles though but maybe if i ask nicely enough (maybe brush up on my mandarin) I might get hooked up.\n\nEDIT\nI have gotten chef mings two other times with less spectacular results but it is still solid.  the Szechuan spicy boiled fish fillet is still the thing to get.

Unlike everyone else, I actually step foot inside this restaurant. There were so many red flags, I know it is only a matter of time before they give someone food poisoning. DON'T let it be YOU. Read on to see I am not exaggerating.\n\n1. The first thing I noticed in this restaurant was the old grandpa and grandma separating the egg roll wrappers.. directly touching the dirty table full of ribbon trimmings and ripped up plastic packages. The grandpa even had the wrappers directly touch his pants. Kind of disgusting right? Read on. \n\n2. There were cigarette ashes on my plate set. What, not that bad? Read on.\n\n3. When the waitress got the plate sets for the other members of the party, they were ALL dusty. Like, abandon building dust. D-U-S-T..Y U NO CLEAN YOUR PLATES?!\n\n4. We smelled an overwhelming odor of cigarette smoke at the beginning of our meal. I thought it must be from the outside. It IS next to a liquor store after all. Then at the end of my meal I smelled it again. This time one of us went outside to check if anyone was smoking. No one was outside. Where could the smoke have gone? Read number two again. Yes, I believe one of the cooks was smoking IN the restaurant. Double U, Tee, EFF.\n\n5. Now the rice. Luke warm and there was a piece of plastic trimming in it. Are you guys seriously competing to be the worst restaurant ever? \n\n6. Half the restaurant had boxes scattered around, taking up sooo much space. Paintings were unhung. The dishes were also awfully beat up for a \"new\" restaurant.\n\n7. Then, there's the ambiance. You can tell no one gives a damn about this place. I don't even understand why they opened it.\n\nSo yes, if you order take out, this place is \"fine\". You'll keep thinking everything is all clean and dandy. If you set foot in this restaurant and experienced the things I have experienced.. You'll never order from here again. In all fairness, the food was pretty tasty. I feel awful for giving this place such a bad review. The service was inexperienced (the waitress clearly didn't know what she was doing but was trying hard). I also understand how hard and how much money it costs to have a family restaurant. I'm less sympathetic because it seems like they never even put in any effort. Why do you open a restaurant when you have random boxes scattered on the ground. Your plates are DUSTY. Hong Kong Delight, you fail.\n\n\nBottom line: I honestly feel lucky that I didn't eat a bug or get diarrhea.", "author": "Theresa N."}

After not listening to me and putting the phone down in search of our order and then assuring me they would call the driver I finally asked them to please listen to what I was saying. After explaining the prawns they used had gone bad, she told me \"that's the way we make them!\". I explained again. She spoke to the the manager and offered us a free appetizer next time. I then explained there wouldn't be a \"next time\" and that they should know that the prawns they are using tonight had gone bad. She then argued with me telling me nobody else has complained.  This was the exact response I had expected.  I hope I don't get sick, Thanksgiving is 2 days away and I would hate to miss it because of bad prawns.

I ordered the three dish special which gives you a list of 40 dishes to choose from for $19. We got the orange chicken, the beef and broccoli, and the Mongolian beef. The portions were decent but some were incredibly lacking, I'm looking at you Mongolian beef! From the time we called to when we got the food was about half an hour, which is not that decent decent for free delivery to the Balboa Park area. If I got a menu taped to my door, I'd expect that this place would be close by and quick to arrive! Additionally, I can drive to SFSU in less than ten minutes and I know Chinese doesn't take longer than 20 minutes to cook so why the wait?\n\nThe orange chicken was not what I was used to. I expected small pieces of chicken deep fried in orange sauce. Instead, it was cut slices of breast or rib meat swimming in sauce. There was plenty of chicken though and the sauce wasn't too sweet. The beef and broccoli was your standard Chinese fare but there was a lot of beef AND broccoli. The Mongolian beef wasn't too spicy and didn't come with too much meat. Additionally, I think there's supposed to be crispy noodles that come with the dish traditionally that this place eschewed. \n\nIt was pretty decent food, although I wish it were a bit cheaper and arrived sooner. The food, while somewhat plentiful depending on the dish, was pretty decent but could be a bit more better heated.", "author": "Rick C."}

I got 1 soda, pepper steak with no peppers, and meat that was just about RAW.  The egg rolls were sitting in about an inch of grease in the container and completely soggy.  It was a disgusting mess.  I placed a complaint with eat 24 and the contacted the restaurant, which authorized a credit for the 2 sodas I didn't receive and the order of pepper steak.  So, I was left with soggy egg rolls and a large rice for dinner.  Really?  What am I supposed to do with that?  And yes, go ahead and keep that $4 tip as well.....as I sit here....without dinner.

We live in the Mission, and Hong Kong Delights had left a delivery menu on our front door. We called, placed our order, and were told a price. Then so many things went wrong:\n\n- Once we hung up, we realized the price was much too high. We called back, and they gave us a bullshit story about how their prices had just gone up -- despite the fact that they were cheaper on the menu they'd just left on our door, and online.\n\n- They also charged us a delivery charge, claiming that we were just outside their range of free delivery -- again, despite the fact that they were intentionally advertising free delivery in our neighborhood.\n\n- Given all of this price hiking, we asked them to please cancel our order. They got mad and told us the driver had already left, even though we had only placed the order a few moments before: another clear lie.\n\n- When the order got here, the portions were small and the food mediocre.\n\n- My dish, the sweet and sour tofu, had stray bits of pork in it. Not. Cool.\n\n- All three of us housemates ending up feeling sick after eating. We all had very different dishes. We don't know if our food was tampered with, pumped full of MSG or what, but it was not a fun experience.\n\nIn short, DO NOT order delivery food from Hong Kong Delights. It is not a neat, yet undiscovered gem. It is a recipe for lies and sickness.", "author": "Bonnie R."}

I specifically said not spicy for salt and pepper fish and they put Jalape\u00f1o on the food, and the House Chow mein which I have ordered in the past a few times was made into House Spicy Chow Mein. I emailed and spoke with 24 online assistance from eat24 and they said somebody from restaurant was going to call me. Somebody called and said they were going to send a replacement salt and pepper fish so not spicy , but not chow mein as he said cook did not make it spicy and did not add anything - I told him are you kidding me there are red pepper flakes all over them and so after I got pissed off he said he will send the 2 dishes not spicy. I am still waiting right now for the food to be delivered. Anyway, I don't think I will be using eat24 and Golden Wok after today. I will just have to take my business somewhere else. They will not credit items. I don't know if I will tip the redelivery guy as I am still upset as those orders were for my kids, so I ended up cooking anyway for them from what I have in the fridge, which I was trying to avoid and could have done on the first place.\nAddendum, after about an hour from the call, the delivery guy came and called me to pick up the order from his car instead of going to my doorstep. I went down from my 10 step stairs to the street and he got out of the car to give me the food. I was going to give him $2 for the redelivery but changed my mind when I had to go down and get the food on the street and skipped the tip. I gave the first delivery guy $5. That's it never again from this place.", "author": "Jose D."}

The moo shu beef was also pretty uninteresting. While the fried rice was free with a $20 order, besides the chicken and the rice, there was little else in the dish.The star was the salt and pepper chicken wings; thus the 3rd star.

Rather than trying my luck at Diala Pizza which never looked good or trying to catch the M somewhere else I wandered down Randolph St. hoping to find somewhere else to eat. While I'm new to the area I've walked down the street before and Randolph is pretty lean. Aside from the Ocean View library and the occasional convenience store there isn't much there aside from houses. Reaching the end of the street at Orizaba I was thinking about my next move and wishing that I'd just gone over to Mission instead where at least I'd have a chance to find an alternate when, upon turning the corner I found a Chinese place with a Grand Opening sign up. Taking this as fate (or more likely, a convenient coincidence) I decided to try it out.\n\nI tried the Orange Peel Chicken and my girlfriend got the Vegetarian Delight. Both were pretty good, nothing really special, but good enough for a neighborhood place. The Vegetarian Delight had a light sauce with a strong note of ginger that didn't overpower the vegetables. The Orange Peel Chicken was crunchy and spicy, not as much orange flavor as I like, but I've always been partial to the horribly Americanized style that comes drenched in syrupy sauce (i.e. Panda Express).\n\nAll in all it's a decent enough spot to stop in if you happen to live in the area already. There's a dearth of restaurants nearby unless you head over to Mission or up to Ocean Ave. or West Portal. There's also delivery with a $10 minimum.", "author": "Mark S."}

I ordered the 3 item special, pepper steak, basil spicy prawn, and pepper fish.  So I gave a generous 2 stars for the price and the as promised 45 minute delivery.  The food was terrible.  I didn't get sick from it it just lacked taste and the quality was poor. The fish was chewy, the beef was so overcooked it was like jerky.  The so called prawns (small size shrimp was the frozen kind) was watery and again no flavor. I cannot understand how a place stays in business with quality of food like this.  They disguise there name as \"chef Ming\" with the golden wok in tiny print .  I don't think this is an actual restaurant that you can pick up, I'm certain it's a shady residential house that doesn't even carry a biz license.

My roommate and I ordered food from their place and first off it took them an hour and a half to deliver our food and that too because we called them an hour after they said they would be here to see what happened. They then proceeded to say oh we'll have your food their in 15 minutes. Then when I got my food I saw they had given me a chicken chow mein instead of a vegetarian chow mein(honest mistake right?). I thought so, so I called to let them know of their mistake and ask for them to replace my order(BAD IDEA!!), they refused to bring me a replacement dinner because their restaurant was \"too busy\"(um hi then don't have a delivery service), they offered me a store credit instead. While I was upset because I clearly still did not receive food I thought it was nice of them to give me some sort of compensation but it sadly does not end there. I called the next day to order food and discovered that I had only received a $5.00 compensation for a meal of $6.50. They said that there boss only lets them give a $5.00 compensation for all meals and i had to pay $1.50 for the meal they gave me the next day. WOW HORRIBLE SERVICE OR WHAT???

Saw the flyer on my gate a few days ago so I thought why not give it a try and I called. Got the three for $19.95 and we got house chow mein, kung pao chicken, and honey walnut prawns. Most delivery spots have really shitty kung pao so I've basically given up, but 45 minutes later when it got to my door I devoured the whole damn order in one sitting. It was ridiculously good. No peanuts like most kung pao but I hate peanuts so that was a plus for me. Then tonight we decided to order again. We got the kung pao (obviously), as well as the beef with Chinese broccoli, and sweet and sour pork. Egg rolls, too. I've never liked sweet and sour pork but I tried my moms order and it was actually good. The beef with Chinese broccoli was super flavorful and the beef sauce wasn't thick and slimey like a lot of other places make it. The egg rolls were crispy and awesome but they were kinda oily so that's my only complaint. After laying them on a paper towel they were great though.
