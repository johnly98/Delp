{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-10", "description": "The beauty of San Francisco is the variety of cuisines available in a 7 x 7 mile radius.  Not only merely by countries or nations, you can find various regional cooking styles whether north, south, east, or west.  With Vietnamese cuisine, the south and north areas specialize in different signature dishes.\n\nMy friends who hosted this meal picked this neighborhood gem for a recent weeknight supper.  Being my first time, I deferred to them in composing our meal.  The dining room was about half full as we were seated at a wall table on the left.  Our party of four fit comfortably here but, after our order was placed, the table seemed small given the food that was to come.\n\nHere's what we shared family style:\n\nAppetizers\n1.  Green papaya shrimp salad (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=W3bk1ovEVEhuuM2mhAb6ig&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Refreshing and clean, this was a perfect palate opener.  Love the tangy and sweet fish sauce dressing.\n\n2.  Imperial rolls (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=0mLUIvtX3JTJsH8VICstmg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Always appreciate chefs who stay true to the cuisine, using the proper wrapper (not Chinese spring roll) to make this.  Always a table favorite.\n\n3.  Crispy calamari (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=E1hfdF_pLCiOBeOfVhyXoA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - A non conventional take on fried calamari as this is seasoned with Thai chili sauce and other herbs.  Nice flavor contrast to the first two apps.\n\nMains\n4.  Curry short ribs (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=8k-5WXGICzItTzseiSE3Tg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Tender and boneless, these were easy to eat and paired well with either the garlic noodles or the claypot rice.  The sauce was rich but note overly so.\n\n5.  Garlic roasted Dungeness crab, whole (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Hb0KDx8ghfUY8J5WzizUmw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Served with garlic noodles, this crab was a solid dish.  The flavors weren't particularly distinct but you can't beat eating fresh crab when in season.  Be ready to lick those fingers.\n\n6.  Caramelized sea bass (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=fl0s19_lcgnZksbPO0RhDA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Not my favorite but another decent dish.  Don't get me wrong, the fish was fine and paired well with the broccoli but it didn't particularly wow me.\n\n7.  Claypot rice (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=cTbzYy1pdlt9zGrHMaTM3A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - There is certainly no shortage of ingredients in this dish as shown in the picture.  Just wished the rice was a tad more crispy for that clay pot effect.\n\nBy the time we finished our meal, the dining room was just about full, seemingly with mostly neighborhood locals.  We asked our waiter to pack the leftovers and, after our gracious hosts paid the bill, tried to walk off dinner along Clement Street.\n\nThe food ranks four plus with an extra half star for the efficient service (rounding up to five).", "author": "Mike C."}

I get the traditional Pho for lunch or garlic noodles for dinner. Most of the things about the Pho is decent, from the broth to the meat, but the only complaint is the meatballs. They tasted like crab meat - tasteless and spongy... The garlic noodles thankfully not salty! I loved the crispy garlic pieces that they put in the noodles, which added a nice touch. They marinated the noodles just the right amount so that it is flavorful, but not too much! \n\nTake note that there is a separate lunch and dinner menu. Unfortunately, the dinner menu does not have Pho... but garlic noodles are still a good substitute if you want your carbs! The garlic noodles are in quite small print at the very bottom of the menu, so be sure to pay attention! It may be listed as a side dish, but it is a main course by itself! The waitress was kind enough to point that out to me.", "author": "Louis Suo L."}

The imperial rolls were so good and their fish sauce seems to have had sweet chili also in it. It was delicious. I wish I could have a bottle of that for all my food. We also had ordered the five spiced chicken and wow it was moist and the skin was crunchy.

I was surprised it was not busy at all on a Friday at 7:20. We were promptly seated as soon as we entered the restaurant. \n\nAs a started, we got soft shell blue crab. It's very rare for us to find any blue crab dish in sf so we got it as soon as we saw it. This was good but the lemon sauce that came with it did not go well with the sweet flavors of the blue crab.\n\nThe highlight of the night were the shaken beef and the macadamian crusted lamb chops. The shaken beef was tender and juicy with the right hint of spices. The lamb chop was perfect seared on the edges and when we cut into it, it had the perfect hint of pink. The garlic noodles here were cooked to perfection. It was soft and slippery and was in a generous serving size. \n\nThe biggest con of the night was the laksa. There wasn't anything remotely amazing about it to make it $33. There were only four piece of shrimp, a couple pieces of fishes, mediocre sized tofu, and a bunch of baby octopus fillers. I can't even comprehend how this dish added up to $33.\n\nService was quick and friendly which was a plus.

They said thats the only way chef likes to make it so its not on the menu.  It was amazing though!  Served on a bed of fried rice which was big enough to feed the table.  Everything else that we got on the menu was also amazing!\n\nLotus Root Salad (5): The appearance of this thing was interesting.  After the first bite though, flavors and textures just exploded!  Just a great combination with bits of beef to contrast the light, sweet, and tangy salad flavors.   \n\nCaramelized Sea Bass (5): As expected, light and melts in your mouth.  Excellent!\n\nLuc Lac Shaken Beef (5): Tender, juicy cubes of beef served with a sort of tangy sauce that contrasts the salty meat well. \n\nFried Banana with Coconut Ice Cream (4): Lightly fried bananas with some smooth coconut ice cream.  Simple yet delicious.  \n\nYoung Coconut (5): I hesitated on this one.  Just thought it'd be a cut open coconut that you can drink the water from.  Did not expect how amazing this coconut water was!  It was sweeter than expected and had a very refreshing flavor to it.  The coconut meat was also super soft and sweet!  Almost like eating a healthy and natural almond jello.  I'd eat this every day if I could.  \n\nEverything was pretty solid and amazing on this visit.  The food was on point.  The chef even came out and asked us if everything was good and up to our standards (probably cause we special ordered the lobster).  Overall, amazing experience.  Will likely return when we're in the area.  If nothing else than to get that lotus root salad and the young coconut.  Super good!", "author": "Jeremy L."}

Based on the reviews, that was definitely a surprise.

Waitress suggested that we get the garlic bread to dip the curry in. It was fine but not necessary. The combination was kinda interesting and I think white rice would have been fine. Serving was also slightly more generous than I expected. \n\nOverall, definitely not the typical \"authentic\" Vietnamese place with $10 pho and vermicelli bowls but for the taste and ambiance, I'm a fan.

We started off with the imperial rolls (very tasty!) and the chicken & shrimp crepe (also good!). My favorite of the night was the shaken beef. I've ordered this dish at other Vietnamese establishments but I have to say this is the best one I've had. Succulent beef cubes sit over a bed of softened red onions and is served with a lemony sauce. This was a nice accompaniment with the house fried rice (with duck). Finally, the five spice chicken was also satisfying. It was boneless but with the skin on (mhmm!). It was served alongside a fresh slaw of cabbage, onions, carrot, and mint. The only thing that needed some improvement was the lychee iced tea. There was hardly a lychee taste in the beverage. Overall, the flavors were solid and the prices were fair.\n\nOur server was attentive and the others who aided him came by a couple times to check up on us. Lastly, the restaurant is well-kept and is suitable for small or medium-sized groups. Le Soleil is a new favorite on Clement!", "author": "James Z."}

The dark, polished, wooden furniture and decorative accents looks more elegant than your typical Vietnamese restaurant. The abacus on the walls were my favorite. \nThe prices are also higher than that of a typical Vietnamese restaurant. Both our entrees were around $15. However, the dishes appeared more refined, with a hint of French influence. We just wanted a simple dinner, so we didn't know what to expect.\n\nLuc Lac \"Shaken Beef\" - wok tossed steak, onions, lemon pepper dipping sauce:\nThe beef nuggets were juicy, tender, and sweet. The lemon pepper sauce just added a bit of tanginess. It's hard to go wrong with beef & rice.\n\nFive Spice Chicken - grilled chicken, cabbage slaw, chili nuoc mam:\nThe chicken was tasty and seasoned well. I enjoyed the mildly spicy and sour fish sauce with it. The cabbage slaw added some textural crunch to our meal, since we didn't order any vegetables. \n\nNow that I'm aware of what this place has to offer, I'd be interested in coming back to try other dishes.", "author": "Joy W."}

I love Vietnamese food, and their French-Vietnamese fusion is interesting and yummy! \n\nBefore serving your actual order, they bring a small soup/chowder that's tangy and flavorful. Not really sure what was in it, but it tasted like tomatoes and a bit of onion. I really wanted to ask for seconds! My mom and I got the lemongrass beef with vermicelli noodles, and a plate of fried tofu with spring rolls. The tofu was perfectly crisp with fried onion on top, and the spring roll was fresh and delicious! There was also a small side of salad. The portions were perfect for me. The lemongrass beef was also tasty, not too fatty. I think the vermicelli noodles were pretty standard, though the egg rolls were great, crunchy and mouthwatering. \n\nThe price range is a bit expensive for what you get, but I'd say that's a given as it's in SF and the place is pretty nice, clean, and fancy.

But we just wanted to give this place a try. When you read the name of this place, it doesn't sound like its a vietnamese restaurant. When you come inside, its very clean and modern. It wasn't full when we came in for lunch. \n\nThe workers here are nice but there were only Couple workers who work in the customers: 1 who bring out food only while the other person takes your orders. The person who takes your order sometime bring out your food too. So it'll take them a while to get to you to give you your utensils and menus and as well getting your orders especially if they are busy. They would give lunch menu first if you come in for lunch but we also asked for the dinner menu so we can get more option of picking the foods. After we order most of the dishes come after the other. Some come at reasonable time while some took a longer than others\n\nMy family ordered so much food like we were ready to eat for dinner. The foods are in smaller portion. Here are the food that we ordered:\n1. Garlic noodle with Dungeness crab (never seen crab on garlic noodle before)\n2. Vegetarian brown fried rice\n3. Catfish clay pot (this dish was really really sweet so you definitely need to eat with white rice)\n4. Imperial egg roll\n5. Escargot noodle (this one is soup). Thought it was interesting to see escargot in a noodle soup type. Almost the same color as bun rieu\n6. Beef capriccio with shrimp chip: although its raw but it has a sweetness flavor to it\n7. Papaya salad (thought it was alright)\n8. Curry short ribs (the meats were very tender and curry was good and it was good to eat with rice)\nThere were so good that we almost eat everything that we order except for the fried rice only had a few bite.

Le Soleil (what a cool name by the way) is a fancy Vietnamese restaurant that has a lot of fancy crossover Viet/French dishes (like stuff with escargot, crab, etc.). I was craving some Vietnamese food and suggested this restaurant to my friend.\n\nWe came around 7pm and luckily found parking right away on Clement St. Fortunately, the Richmond area of SF isn't as bad as Sunset and so it's a bit easier to find parking. There wasn't a line and we were seated right away.\n\nIt seems like Le Soleil has pretty steep prices for Viet food that I'd otherwise pay very cheaply for. However, the pictures and reviews were good, so maybe this place really is reputable. As recommended, we got the garlic noodles, the chicken/shrimp crepe, and lemongrass beef.\n\nFirst, the crepe. This \"banh xeo\" was BOMB.COM. I've had pretty good Viet crepes that my family has made, but this was is definitely up there as the best. It's $14, but eating just one or two is enough to get you full. What makes this one so good is that the ingredients (shrimp, bean sprouts, chicken) are very fresh and you can taste it. Please get this!\n\nLemongrass beef came out next and I was pretty disappointed. I guess I was expecting too much because for $17, you should be getting a good steal. However, you get a place of beef and salad that can easily be assembled and eaten at another Viet restaurant for about a third of the price. That said, it was still decent and a fine option if you are looking for a beef item.\n\nLastly, the garlic noodles. This was one of the highest recommended items and for $10, it's not a bad choice. However, it also tasted like you can make this yourself or buy this for a discount somewhere else. It was still good, and so if you are into garlic noodles and don't want to make them, check this one out. \n\ntl;dr Le Soleil is a very pricy but fancy Vietnamese/French restaurant.

As mentioned the browned & garlic egg noodles with the crab brains were the table favorite, but the crab itself was just alright.\n\n\\\\ Shrimp Rice Krispies - Shrimp Cakes with water chestnut, sweet rice crust, served with peanut sauce. I'd 100% get these again. \n\n\\\\ House Fried Rice - Duck and pineapple stir-fried rice seasoned with scallions and garlic. Not a huge fan. Was a bit too dry and too salty even for me, a person who would sneak into my grandma's car to lick the salt block she kept in the trunk to weigh down the back half of the car as a child.\n\n\\\\ Imperial Rolls - Pork, mushroom, carrots, lightly fried, served with fresh vegetables & fish sauce. Again, these were just ok. A little too dry for my tastes. \n\n\\\\ Tofu Eggplant - Bean curd, eggplant, bell peppers in soy sauce, served with rice. It was just fine but not a standout dish by any means. \n\nDrink:\n\\\\ Young Coconut - So freaking good. Served in the coconut, so fresh and only $4. Def helped cure my hangover from the night before.\n\nIf I could give 3.5 stars I would, but I can't. Based off the dozen or so specialty whole crab dishes I've had for my first crab season living in the bay area, I have to say that while this crab wasn't bad, it so far has been the least impressive, but the price was reasonable, the place is cute, decor is warm, service was fine, and the bathrooms were immaculate and bigger than my apartment.", "author": "Candice G."}

The crab wasn't very meaty but the sauce was tasty. Garlic noodles reminded me of packaged ramen, would've preferred a chubbier noodle.

Pretty tasty if you dip them in the fish sauce but not necessary 4/5\n-Seabass: Sea bass on a bed of green beans and broccoli. Pretty tasty, it was my mom and sister's favorite.

Le Soleil is just a five minute walk from our house, and while it's getting harder and harder to get a table in this city without a reservation, we're usually able to walk right in. I have probably been here ten times, and I find it to be a great experience every time. The reason I'm conflicted about writing this review is that I want to praise this place... but I don't want the secret to get out! I like my minimal wait times for delicious food!\n\nI have never had a dish here that isn't good. The wait staff is super friendly, and everything has such a unique flavor that I haven't really seen replicated at other similar restaurants in the bay area. There are lots of good cheap Asian places in the city, and this place isn't cheap... but it's also not super expensive. Dishes are in the $12 to $18 range. They have so many good dishes - I recommend coming here with a group of four and doing family style. With four people, you'll likely get a table pretty quickly, and you'll be able to share a lot of things.\n\nIf it's your first visit to the restaurant and you have four people, I would recommend starting with the imperial rolls and shrimp papaya salad. The rolls are fried, but you wrap them in lettuce and dip them in some sauce. The salad is super refreshing. For your main course, make sure to get the shaken beef or grilled pork along with garlic noodles w/ tiger prawns (not on the menu).

I do wish, however, there was more of a fish sauce taste. I found the sauce they used to be a bit too sweet for my liking. \n\nBeef congee was interesting from the norm since it's more of a thinner consistently and uses broken rice! It gave an interesting texture and the flavors were good. \n\nWhole crab had a decent amount of meat. The garlic noodles reminded me of instant ramen, but I really enjoyed the taste! Especially with the crab insides on top. \n\nThere's no MSG used here, so the flavors might not be as mouth watering as typical Asian cuisine, but you also won't get that MSG hangover after. \n\nService was a bit slow since we were seated behind a pillar, so it was hard to get their attention. \n\nGood option if you're in the area and don't want to endure a long wait on a weekend.

We ordered the usual, imperial rolls, tomato seafood noodle soup and viet ice coffee. We decided to try their shaking beef because others had great review on it. I would say it's totally worth it. I've been to a lot of places that makes it good but this is one of the best ones I've had. I do have to say it's missing a bit of something to go with it. Maybe tomato? I don't know exactly but regardless it tastes soo good with rice.\n\nEverything else is also really delicious. The ice coffee felt too little. It was barely even half a cup once it's done brewing.

It's hard to really stand out in the porridge space, Mission Chinese is the only one who has been called out by 7x7.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-12", "description": "Vietnamese food use to be a weekly staple for me. You could find me at Loi's, PPQ Noodle House, or Pho Huynh Hiep (Kevin's Noodle House) getting a nice facial over a hot steaming bowl of pho, face shoveling into a combo rice plate or getting buzzed off Vietnamese iced coffee. \n\nWith age, came my intolerance to MSG and caffeine along with a couple of crow's feet, aching knees, and bladder leakage that will soon be in need of Depends. Not to mention passing out in front of the TV even before the guest list opens up at most clubs. Ohhh if only I can be 21 again. \n\nAnyhow, back to food talk because who doesn't love taking about food? :)\n\nThese days, I rarely if ever eat Vietnamese food because of the MSG. Yes, I know it's a staple in Asian cuisine but my body can no longer tolerate it so it makes it difficult to enjoy most Asian cuisine and the wallet-friendly prices. \n\nA rarity, Le Soleil serves upscale MSG-FREE Vietnamese cuisine with French influences. If you're looking for pho, please go somewhere else. It's ridiculous to complain that Le Soleil only has one pho option; they're not Pho 99. However, if you're looking to tantalize your taste buds with unique Vietnamese cuisine made with top-notch ingredients then Le Soleil is the place for you. \n\nThe menu is fairly limited at just 22 items for dinner but with you can make special requests ahead of time with Chef Dennis (24-48 hour in advance so he can buy the ingredients) who's a super nice guy. His specialties on the menu includes Flamb\u00e9ed Quail, Caramelized Sea Bass, and Roasted Garlic Dungeness Crab. They also have brown rice. Yay!\n\nWe started with the Beef Carpaccio ($8). Sorry, no pic for this app since my phone decided to not share this deliciousness with you and deleted the pic *shakes fist*. The tender slices of filet mignon was lightly dressed in a citrus, mint, and chili concoction and served alongside a basket of freshly fried thick shrimp chips (not that stale, flimsy cheap shit at Chinese restaurants). A real solid starter. \n\nThe Bo Luc Lac: Shaking Beef ($16) came next; spelled \"shaken\" on the menu. We added an egg on request (+$2) and it came on a sizzling platter which reminded me of Filipino sisig: http://bit.ly/186ePRX. Just when I thought I tasted the best bo luc lac at Bodega Bistro in TL, a bite of the mouth-wateringly buttery bo luc lac made me realized the BEST has been hidden here at Le Soleil. Not a dish I wanted to share, I'll tell you that much. \n\nAll heads turned when the gargantuan Garlic Roasted Crab w/ Egg Noodles ($32) was placed on our table for two: http://bit.ly/18TBgMz. Insanely fresh, the crab was delicately tender and ohh sooo sweet. The bits of garlic infused just enough garlickyness without leaving us with major dragon breath. The innards of the crab was then mixed with the egg noodles for an artery-clogging carb fest. My only gripe was the noodles; it was more mushy and I like my noodles al-dente with a toothsome chew. Perhaps a thicker noodle would have fared better? \n\nI know people want to know if Le Soleil's crab is as good as PPQ or Thanh Long and there's really no comparison as both PPQ and Thanh Long uses tons of MSG to flavor their signature crab dishes. As I've said, that's like comparing real tits to fake ones. Don't get me wrong, I like fake ones too and I would get a pair to fix my lopsided ones but there's really no comparison.\n\nBecause it's not a complete dinner without dessert (especially when dining out), we wanted to order the Tempura Ice Cream but one of the waitresses brought us the Trio of Ice Cream. When we told her we had ordered the Tempura Ice Cream she said they didn't have it. We instead requested the Fried Bananas with Ice Cream ($4.50) which was tempura battered bananas served with coconut ice cream (sorry, no pic). Huh? They had the tempura batter for the bananas but not for the ice cream? This made no sense. \n\nAside from this minor blunder, service was very friendly and attentive. A smile goes a long way which most Asian restaurants don't seem to get. But Le Soleil does. All smiles here--thank you!\n\nAlong with the atypical Vietnamese fare and good service, Le Soleil has a very contemporary and more upscale ambiance which makes it great for dates. Beware of the terrible parking situation in this area though. \n\nEverything about Le Soleil seems to warrant almost 5 stars. So why just 4? I asked if Chef Dennis can replicate Brodard's FAMOUS Nem Nuong Cuon in SoCal: http://bit.ly/1g5JNyD and he says he can with advanced notice. Going to hold out on that one extra star until I can meet my beloved crack rolls without travelling 400+ miles. If he can deliver, I will gladly upgrade to 5 stars with a big smooch on the face! I hope he doesn't mind sloppy seconds! I'm kidding....", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

You're supposed to eat this with the shrimp chip but I prefer to roll a beef up with onions and shallots, then pop it into my mouth.  It's a explosion of yummies in your mouth\n! - Portobello Mushrooms with green beans and Brussels - I could had just eaten this dish alone with a bowl of rice and would had been content!

While we like the traditional dishes like the shrimp-pork turmeric crepe and the crab-tomato noodle soup (best we've ever had!), we're also big fans of the fusion dishes like the seabass with brussels sprouts, the macadamia lamb chops, the curry short ribs with garlic bread, and the crab with garlic noodles. I like how Vietnamese food usually is served with a side of veggies to balance out the meat and carbs. They also have an extensive drink menu ranging from wines to beer to tea and juice. I love the fresh coconut juice (and eating the coconut flesh), and discovered a tasty beer from Brazil called Xingu black beer here. \n\nIn addition to their regular menu, Dennis would recommend dishes to us that aren't on the menu, and if we're interested next time, we'd special order the dish the day before so that he can shop for the ingredients. It's wonderful to see a chef that loves his craft and gets excited about cooking for us. We've special ordered crab with steamed egg as well as lobster with sticky rice on special occasions since they're pricier (but worth it in quality). They also welcome our feedback so if you prefer a dish a certain way next time, let them know. \n\nMy parents have lived in Vietnam so we can special order more traditional dishes, too, which he'll try to make with the available ingredients. At lunch today, I asked if he can make the cha ca hanoi fish and the bun cha hanoi grilled pork that I saw in Hanoi, he said sure. I believe that the grilled pork will be added to the regular lunch menu soon. I loved the fish which was lightly fried and served with a plate of veggies, rice paper, and anchovy dipping sauce - he advised us on how to properly wrap and eat the dish. I'm not usually a fan of the anchovy sauce but his version was so good that I finished the sauce.\n\nJust make sure both are working that day and ask for the price of your special order so that there aren't any surprises. I've been there when either Dennis or Annie or both weren't working, and the experience and quality definitely declined so I don't recommend visiting then.", "author": "Diana B."}

The quail had a sweet taste and was flambeed baked on your table. The laksa had two jumbo shrimp with deep fried silky soft tofu, I loved the exceptional spicy flavor. The imperial roll does not have your ordinary egg roll wrapping, this restaurant uses rice paper for the wrapping.

For dinner, I'll recommend you to get their Curry Short Ribs and Sea Bass.\n\n1. Curry Short Ribs (4.5/5)\n- I always love the flavor of the curry. I am not a big fan of curry but i love what they serve there. It usually comes with 7 pieces of meat, which is so tender and flavorful. It also comes with garlic bread, but I always change it to rice. I prefer to have it that way, but sometimes they also give me both rice and the garlic bread.\n\n2. Sea Bass\n- For those who can't eat curry or what to eat something less sinful. I will recommend them to order the seabass, it is served with brussels sprouts and it so tasty as well.\n\nOthers:\nI always order their calamari, which taste incredibly great. They said they took it away from their menu because it takes long to cook it, but they will serve it if you ask. It might took a while, but it is worth the wait.\n\nFriday specials : be sure to try their hainan chicken rice, I always go there once in a month to eat their hainan chicken rice.\n\nLunch Special : their claypot also taste really good but it's only served for lunch time. \n\nService: the lady who work there, the chef, well everybody are so friendly, they accommodate my request very well, they even remember that I always want rice instead of garlic bread for my curry short ribs.

Took them a while to set up our table even though we had reservations - then again, there were 12 of us, most of our party was late, and many of the groups sitting at the tables that would be ours were taking longer than expected.\n\nStill - enjoyed the food, drinks, and service. All the food had great presentation so there were a lot of \"ooh's\" and \"aah's. Also - the water is fantastic! They have a big pitcher in the bar at the back that has orange + lemon slices in it.\n\nMAJOR BONUS POINTS because I forgot my leftovers, came back 20 minutes later after they'd closed, and the chef was so sweet that he made me an entire new dish! And it was a good one - the Luc Lac beef!\n\n* Shrimp Rice Crispies - 4 stars\n(Shrimp cakes & water chestnut filling, sweet rice crust, lightly fried. $7)\nI really enjoyed this - think of it as a tightly packed shrimp cube, with crispy outer breading (like that dim sum dish), and a nice peanut-y sauce to dip. \n\n* Luc Lac \"Shaken Beef\" - 3.5 stars\n(wok tossed flank steak, lemon pepper dipping sauce over rice. $16)\nReally great quality beef, though a tiny bit overcooked for my taste. It has a great flavor by itself, but once I added the lemon dipping sauce (actually now that I'm reading this off the menu.. I should have dipped as per its name rather than poured it over all the beef) it became agonizingly tart.\n\n* Macadamia Lamb Chops - 4 stars\n(cumin & macadamia crusted lamb chops, with brussels sprouts & japanese sweet yam. $15)\nAll the ingredients just sounded so intriguing in combination and I don't regret ordering this! The lamb was great, just a hint of rareness in the middle of the chop. The brussels sprouts were a little soggy (I like 'em crispy) but still went well with the sweet yam (the purple type).\n\n* House Fried Rice - 4 stars\n(duck & pineapple stir fried rice seasoned with scallions and garlic. $11)\nTried a bite - holy cow this was good! The duck was SUPER tender and the pineapple flavor just enough to give this dish a sweetness without overpowering the savory flavors.\n\n* Mango Sticky Rice ($5.50) - 3.5\nOh, this reminds me of those wonderful desserts in China! While all the ingredients were right, the rice wasn't quite sticky enough and was more hard and stale. It's all about that stickiness!\n\n* Tempuraed Coconut Ice Cream ($4.50) - 4.5 stars\n\"WOW\" was the first word out of everyone's lips who tried this. I've had coconut ice cream before but this one was just shockingly intense, in a great way! The tempura = an added awesome bonus.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

Not your typical Vietnamese joint with mainly pho and vermicelli, Le Soleil actually deviates a lot from the traditional Vietnamese foods to more specialty items. \n\nThere's a decent amount of street parking along the entire block which is convenient.

Sometimes PPQ's crab can get this way if you order the spicy or peppercorn crab there. It was roasted with a topping that was egg thinned out with the crab's insides I think. It tasted great but I felt terrible about eating the insides knowing how bad the insides are for you! The crab also seemed smaller than PPQ's, especially when it's crab season, it should be a little bigger. I think our crab was around 1.25-1.5 lbs. \n- Garlic noodles - 3/5 - was under the crab and tasted more like garlic chow mein than the typical garlic noodles I've had before. Still good but just different and nice that it was included in the crab's price.\n- Shaking beef - 5/5 - $16 - awesome! But for that price it better be!\n\nThe location is a little small but the service was great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-31", "description": "Those of you who have lived in the SF Bay Area and through the 1980s/90s will no doubt remember the famous Thanh Long restaurant (which spun its high end counterpart Crustacean) along with a few copycats or competitors offering somewhat similar fare. I cannot speak for Vietnamese expats and how they view this sort of fare, but they have taken some traditional and not so traditional receipes, and figured out a way to make the best use of local/American ingredients and made it into their signature dish (garlic butter roasted Dungeness crab). It's easy to say on one hand that it's Vietnamese style moo shoo poo poo doo doo...but it's not cheap for one thing!\n\nChinese American MSPPDD is cheap, and frankly even PF Chang's is not expensive like MY China or Koi Palace in comparison. The bottom line is, does it taste good, and what kind of clientele does it attract? WTF, did I just abbreviate moo shoo poo poo doo doo MSPPDD like Xiao long bao (XLB)??\n\nWith Le Soleil, while the style and approach can be argued to be similar to that of Thanh Long, there is a bit of a Chinese influence in a good number of the dishes. And that is because of the executive chef Dennis Wong, who is Vietnamese Chinese and who also understands the target demographic.\n\nThis restaurant continues to be very popular for a number of reasons. The food might not be authentic Vietnamese or regional specific by any means, but attracts a stready stream of clientele, mostly locals who live in the area (of which a majority are Cantonese speaking Chinese folks). \n\nWith that said this meal was overall enjoyable.\n\nCaf\u00e9 sua da - eeeek no bueno. Crustacean and Thanh Long had a much better iced Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk in relation. This one had this whacked up Vanilla latte caramelly like flavor, like a really bad pre-made Lee's Sandwiches (McBanh Mi or Banh Bucks) iced milk coffee.\n\nYoung coconut - this was dessert. For those too lazy or don't have the hardware at home to cut it open. Drink the juice then use your ice cream scooping skills to carve out the coconut meat (delish).\n\nPan fried combination noodle - To be fair even a horrible chain (from the South and East Bay) New Tung Kee had something like this, but obviously this is way better. Vietnamese Chinese approach to HK style pan fried noodles (jeen meen), except the noodles were arranged like a \"cake\" format, with thicker layers that elevated the toppings (the stir fried combo of broccoli, chicken, shrimp etc). The sauce was a tad too sweet for my liking but otherwise seasoned well. Guessing the sugar is a bit of a crucial component to draw in the masses and is a bit of an unfortunate theme of a number of stir fry dishes here. So instead of asking to \"hold the MSG, less salt, less oil\" with here it's probably best to ask for \"less sugar\" in the dishes (unless sauces are pre-seasoned).\n\nFlambe quail - this is actually one of their signature specials. The quail arrives at the table with some sort of flammable alcohol on top, and the watistaff sets it on fire for a pyro show....but don't worry the bird is already marinated and dead so it's not like Rage Against the Machine's first album cover, but is absolutely rockin'. When the fire dies down the bird is at the right temperature to be consumed. The flamb\u00e9 seals in the juices. Now in terms of flavoring the quail has this remarkable cross between a sexcellent soy sauce chicken coupled with the complexity of Cantonese cha siu (bbq) marinade...maybe a tad Lee Kum Kee esque in flavoring. It was like deja vu eating this. $hit, no wonder there were quite a number of Chinese customers in here. Although a tad sweet (my only gripe), this was very tasty.   \n\nStir fried Portobello mushrooms with Brussels sprouts and string beans - excellent stir fry with a good wok sear. Yet the theme of sugar is a touch strong here, although it provided the needed carmelization. If they could execute this similar to the sambal string beans at Shiok Singaporean Kitchen (more savory and umami), this would work even better.\n\nRoasted crab with garlic noodles - ended up getting half crab, since there was already a lot of food. But those of you who love to whip out the cameras to let them eat first (before others) will know that excess is best...so therefore a whole crab over noodles will look a lot better than a few severed limbs (crab limbs that is). The noodles were like curly ramen....almost but not quite to the thinness of instant noodle ramen packets, yet were still quite tasty. Crab was not in season of course so not as fatty or juicy, but enjoyable.\n\nIt is said that the son (Walter Kwok) of one of the founders of Hong Kong commercial real estate conglomerate (Sun Hung Kei properties) dined here, and loved the food so much he was instrumental in helping Dennis open up Le Soleil at Royal Garden Tsim Sa Tsui in HK. Who are you to argue with the tastebuds of a multi zillionaire? If only I had a sponsor like that to write paid food reviews in HK  :-D", "author": "Ken K."}

I've always passed by it, but never thought of it as a pho place. Anyways, walked in at around 1PM and we were seated right away. They quickly brought us orange-infused water, which was nice. I don't like orange, but the offering of infused water is cool. It seems like they rotate what they infuse the water with as my sister said she had cucumber water another time. \n\nThe menu is very small and limited at only one page, but they do have pho and bun rieu (although they call it something like tomato and crab noodle soup haha). Drinks are pretty expensive, $3.5-4.5 for stuff like Thai used tea... \n\nOur server was very cheery and nice, although we didn't get any water refills. \n\nNow, for the food. \nPork & Shrimp spring rolls: These were okay, nothing special. Sadly, the peanut sauce was boring and tasted like watered down hoisin sauce... And my sister found a hair in one of the rolls, yikes. \nTraditional Pho: I must say that the broth was very good, it was flavorful and there wasn't oil floating all over. The slices of brisket were very tender and there was a ton of noodles. I dont like beef balls so didn't touch those. The one thing that bothered me was that they didn't chop up the green onions; they just cut up the stalk and threw it in. \nFive Spice Chicken: Sister enjoyed this a lot, and we both really enjoyed the creamy soup that came with it. I had some of the salad on the side and it was good, nice and refreshing. The egg rolls were also good, but I didn't try any of the chicken (not my cup of tea). \nLemongrass Chicken: Sister's boyfriend had this, and it was a huge portion. He didn't like that the rice was buried underneath everything. Didn't try this, but it is spicy according to my sister so if you don't like spicy... \n\nOverall, not bad but maybe a little overpriced, but I guess you're paying to eat in nicer conditions than the usual pho place haha", "author": "Doris K."}

Le Soleil is a Vietnamese-French fusion restaurant that manages to be classy but not snobby. It's located in a quiet neighborhood in Richmond and the interior atmosphere is quite relaxing and modern as well. \n\nWe arrived around 5:30 or 5:45 and the restaurant was almost empty. More people started coming in after 6:30 but it never felt crowded or noisy. Our waiters were very attentive in refilling our glasses (lemon- and apple-infused water) and changing our plates. But the food was the best part:\n\nBeef Carpaccio -- Appetizer of thinly sliced rare filet mignon. It was my first time having raw beef and the meat melted in my mouth like fresh sashimi. Yum. The side notes of mint, onion, and roasted garlic were satisfying as well.\n\nGreen Papaya Salad -- This might have tasted better if it wasn't served right after the Beef Carpaccio, since it had the same mint-onion taste. The green papaya is in shreds and reminded me of turnip salad. It wasn't bad, but I don't think I'd order it again when I return (because I will return).\n\nQuail -- Mmmm. The quail is already cooked when it arrives, but the waiter torches it at the table for good measure and good show. The four of us shared one quail, which was sweet and tender to perfection.\n\nCaramelized Sea Bass -- Perhaps my perfect dish of the night. The texture and taste couldn't have been more satisfying and the brussel sprouts underneath were some of the yummiest I've had.\n\nDungeness Crab and Garlic Noodles -- I'm not a big fan of garlic noodles but these were delectable. I especially loved the crab, which was drizzled over with the contents of the crab shell (I'm Chinese and my family loves eating that). \n\nTurmeric Crepe -- I'm not a big fan of the fried taste so this wasn't my favorite dish, but it was also carefully prepared with carrots and greens on the side.\n\nTofu Eggplant -- Yummy, good with rice (rice texture was great too), and pretty reminiscent of Chinese food in flavor. \n\nMy overall impression of Le Soleil was that each and every detail is carefully attended to. Not only was the food delicately prepared, but the bathroom was very clean and elegantly decorated, and the bill came in a bamboo cup instead of the usual tray or leather book. The meal was a little pricey, at $24 per person, but maybe that's just because we kept ordering more to try the menu. We got what we paid for, though.

That is definitely a first for vietnamese spring rolls, ever. Plus they use the right amouny of each ingredient and carefully construct each roll to create the \"perfect bites\". Reminiscent of how good sushi rolls are rolled. Five stars just for this. I could eat Le Soleil's goi cuon every day.", "author": "Cat T."}

Do not let that fool you. This is truly a hidden gem!\n\nWe came here on a Thursday evening at around 615pm with no wait time. We ordered the following:\n\n-Lotus Root Salad: 5/5 OMG, please do me a favor and order this. It's baby lotus root shoots (not like the huge Chinese purpley kind) with super flavorful and tender marinated beef and bean sprouts. The showstopper of the entire night IMO. My close friends all know I don't like eating salad, so if I'm raving about the salad, just get it.\n\n-Garlic Dungeness crab with garlic noodles: 4.5/5\nA close second to the lotus root salad. Extremely tasty and loved how there were chunks of crab in the garlic noodles themselves. Ugh. Drooling just thinking about it as I write this review. Compared to PPQ Dungeness Crab, I think the noodles here are wayyy better. Also, you can get the crab half or whole - we got half (3 people, but we also ordered other stuff). The reason for the 0.5 points docked off was that the crab portion was way smaller than I had expected. Or maybe I just eat a lot? Noted: I'll get (at least) a whole crab next time. Anyways...\n\n-Duck roasted house special fried rice: 4/5 so addicting, with large pieces of roast duck and pineapple in the rice. The reason for the -1 pt: don't get me wrong, this was super super super tasty, and maybe my food standards are way too high, but it wasn't mind blowing. Don't let my comment fool you though, it was still extremely tasty and would order again.\n\n-Sizzling seafood: 3.5/5 large portions of fish and big prawns. My issue with the dish was that the calamari was definitely on the rubbery side. Otherwise, the rest of the seafood was overall solid. \n\n-Mango with black sticky rice and coconut cream: 4/5 I love Asian desserts and this is no exception. The coconut cream and sticky rice were executed to a perfect consistency: light, flavorful, chewy but not soggy. \n\n***TIP: this place also surprisingly has really good teas. If you like fragrant teas, try the Blooming Tea next time.", "author": "Lena R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-03-21", "description": "Our group of 16 people went to Le Soleil last week as our Vietnamese Food Safari event in search of the best banh xeo in San Francisco.  Although, a few believed they have found it here, I find it to be very good but can not crown it was the best.  We were pleasantly surprise with other Vietnamese dishes there as well, so much so that my friend and I went back last night to try out more dishes.  \n\nLast week was a treat for us, because Martin Yan of Yan Can Cook was also there with his friends.  Martin was nice enough to introduced Le Soleil's chef and posed for pictures with us. Back to the food - the banh xeo we had was quite good. It was crispy and loaded with bean sprouts and mung beans.  I would have liked it to have more pork and shrimp, but maybe my portion of the crepe missed the goodies inside.  I've always said a good banh xeo is only as good as the Vietnamese fish vinegarette (nuoc mam) it is dipped in.  The nuoc mam was near perfect and tasty.  We ordered two lotus root salads - very good and refreshing. Two shaken beef (bo luc lac) - one dish was very good and the second was perfection!  We ordered oxtail stew(off menu), a roasted crab, egg rolls, five spice chicken, garlic noodles, and lots of merlot to help things move along. Their eggrolls were flavorful as well.  Overall, we were very pleased with the food at Le Soleil. The waitresses were friendly and one even conversed with me in Vietnamese.  The old items are very reasonably priced for the quality of food and services they provide. I almost forgot to mention the sea bass - although tasty, it missed the mark as a Vietnamese dish.  Fried with too much batter, but still moist and tasty. I would have liked to see caramelized clay pot fish (ca kno to) served at this restaurant, but there are other places I can go for that.  Although we did not find the best banh xeo here, we did find many flavorful dishes that will sure to bring us back again and again. \n\nEnjoy!\n\nLet me know what you think of the dishes serve at this restaurant.

The owner was nice for showing concern and comping one of our dishes, and sending over the free dessert.\n\nCONS - I. can't. even.\nThe service was, honestly, the worst ever. More on that in a sec.\n\nAppetizers: The imperial rolls were pretty standard, but good and crispy. The soft shell crab was salty, fishy and mushy -- but the shell wasn't even soft enough. The batter was tasty but sooo greasy.\n\nEntrees: The beef curry short ribs had a great flavor and a good deep fried coating, which really hooked me at first, but they're fried to hell and swimming in creamy, greasy sauce. After a couple pieces I couldn't stomach any more. The lamb chops came with two pieces -- one overcooked, the other almost raw, sitting on what could only be described as gritty, sticky purple peanut butter without taste. Along with bitter, tough Brussels sprouts that were *actually* the least awful part of the dish.\n\nService: where do I even start....\n\nThe waiter who asked at the door whether we had a reservation (we did.) said we'd have to wait at least 10 minutes until more tables cleared. (Even though we saw an empty, clean table right there.) After several minutes waiting in the entryway, suddenly the owner noticed us and sat us right away, at that table.\n\nIt was a wait before anyone came to take our order... when the waitress finally came over, they were out of the appetizer we wanted (we saw other tables getting it before us). Instead of giving us a second to pick another she said \"Sorry we're out of that, I'll come back later\" and left.\n\nShe came back with our drinks awhile later. My bf's beer was in a bottle with some poured into the glass -- one inch of liquid in the bottom of the glass, about 5 inches of foam. We both laughed because it honestly looked like a joke. My wine was a white (not what I expected or wanted) so she went back to check if it was the one I'd asked for. She returned, and yes -- apparently I'd ordered the only white on the red side of the wine list. She was nice enough to offer a new glass no questions asked, I thanked her and said we're ready to order, too, she just dashed away with the unwanted wine saying \"okay I'll come back later.\" bluuurrrgggghhhhhhh\n\nWe FINALLY order and get our dishes (see rant above) and were not impressed. The owner walked by and noticed our lamb dish was hardly touched and was bright bloody pink. She was so nice, apologized and offered to cook it more or bring us something new -- however we were pretty put off and said we were full anyway. She took it off the bill. I really appreciate that she cared so much and tried to make it a better experience.\n\nSo we were done eating, and a different waiter came to clear our plates. We had one short rib left, and even though he didn't love the dish, my bf asked for a box to take it home. The waiter says ok, then forgets and immediately throws a dirty bowl right into the dish. He heard my \"Uh?!\" as he ran off, and rushed back to apologize and tried to take the bowl out of the dish and sort of held it out as if we might still want it. OMG NO!!!!!!!!!!\n\nHence the free dessert. The owner was so apologetic and it's not like we were even complaining -- it's just that the experience was so clearly terrible from beginning to end. Because of the owner's obvious concern and kindness, I raised my star rating from 1 stars to 2. Unfortunately I just can't rate the place any higher no matter how good her intentions are.\n\nThis place could use an ENTIRELY new waitstaff, a better wine list that makes sense on the menu, a few fresh dishes that aren't so greasy, more consistent chefs -- just change everything please.", "author": "Laura W."}

Had a nice lemony sauce that nicey complimented this cute dish.\n\nThe lotus root salad is also a MUST get!  Since it comes with a fish oil based sauce, it basically reminds me of vietnamese vermicelli, but without the noodle, meats, or chicken.  Great fried onion taste, and it's super healthy with all those root veggies.\n\nTheir 5 spice chicken is always veery tender and has a great flavor (I also very much like the fish sauce it comes with).\n\nTheir shaken beef is okay.  It's not bad, but I was expecting something more tender.\n\nLastly, for dessert, we tried the mango sticky rice.  The waiter really undersold this one, so I had my expectations low.  I've personally never had real mango sticky rice, and my friend said that is better.  But from somebody who's never tried it, I thought this fusion version was actually very tasty and interesting.\n\nOverall, a little bit on the fancy side, so their apps and desserts, please expect small.  But their entrees are very generous proportions, and everything is very well-presented.\n\nThe overall flavor for every savory item is definitely citrus-- you'll find it in the sauces often.

First the garlic noodles were pretty good! Not overwhelmingly oily like the one at PPQ and the crab was mediocre and the amount of crab was disappointing compared to PPQ. \n\nFried rice wasn't extraordinary-- it tasted like any other fried rice at a Chinese restaurant. \n\nWhat we really enjoyed was the shaking beef. The sweetness of the sauce created perfect harmony with their sour sauce.\n\nAmbience:\nIf you're looking for casual dining you're at the right place.

This part of Clement St is home to many great restaurants as everyone knows.  So it's hard to go wrong here.  However, the consequence of being a street with a lot of culinary cred is that restaurants have to live up to it.  Also, this is a neighborhood \"in transition.\" The middle-class Chinese and USF frat boys are being replaced by well-off Chinese and grown up frat boys with families.  Thus, there are restaurants to accommodate.  Let's check it out:\n\nThis is a restaurant for people who can not deal with hole-in-the-wall authentic ethnic food.  This is a place where the focus of each dish is aesthetic, rather than taste.  The menu is Asian fusion. You won't get anything displeasing, but you won't get anything incredible.  No matter what, you'll receive a nice little mint sprig cut perfectly on the side.  There is a nice quiet water trickle the whole time while you're eating, etc.  You get the picture. \nIf you are looking for great food and incredible dishes don't go here.  If you're looking for upper-scale Asian fusion not meant to challenge any palate, this is your place.  Bland and boring in all ways.", "author": "sonrisa m."}

It's not straight up Vietnamese food, but more of French-Vietnamese fusion. \n\nThe restaurant is small, but holds quite a few people. As the night wore on, I was surprised at how packed it got on a weeknight! The service was generally good and friendly. The restaurant felt intimate and had pretty decor. \n\nI let Wendy recommend the food since she had been here often. Everything was AMAZING. We had the Beef Carpaccio (SOOOO good and served on top of homemade shrimp crackers) and Shrimp Papaya Salad (light and refreshing, not too spicy!) for appetizers. \n\nThen, Wendy's boyfriend, Jerry, ordered the Curry Short Ribs and I ordered the Shaken Beef for entrees and we shared. The Curry Short Ribs was very unique - the short ribs were served in a clay pot with the curry, but seemed to have been fried first as it was crispy. It was a good dish. The Shaken Beef is a classic, but done SO well here - it was super tender and flavorful. I would probably order this every time... \n\nWe ended the night with Tempura Ice Cream. The tempura batter was a thin coat and perfectly fried so that the ice cream was still nice and firm on the inside. It was also just really yummy, creamy ice cream. A great finish to a great meal!", "author": "Tiffie L."}

Unfortunately, it was just overpriced americanized Vietnamese food. The area is known for their great asian food, and my wife and I are regulars in the area. This falls short of places like Burma superstar(which is a few blocks down) or those small hole in the wall restaurants that the Inner Richmond is known for.\n\nWe ordered the Beef and the cod. Both were disappointing. Especially the beef. If you want a broccoli beef sauce that you can get at Panda Express with just higher quality meat and smaller portions and pay $15 bucks for it then you've found the right place. The cod was pretty good but tiny and FRIED so it was greasy. There were a lot of people here on dates and you could kinda tell that they thought this was high end asian food.

After leaving work early thanks to a lengthy meeting that left me without a lunch break I walked into a nearly empty restaurant for an early dinner.\n\nThe friendly waiter/server greeted me and seated me at a window side table.  The menus are well worn here, and the copy I got was literally falling apart in the middle.  The large number of selections on the menu surprised me, and I asked the waiter for additional time so that I could study it better.  \n\nI have this stubborn opinion that mixing rice noodles with gravy is always a bad thing yet that's exactly what I ordered on this visit, the Pan Fried Wide Rice Noodles with Chicken and Prawns.  I don't often find Hoisin Baby Back Ribs on the appetizer menus of other Vietnamese restaurants so I ordered one of those too.\n\nAs I sat slurping from two tall glasses on my table, one filled with ice water and the other with soda, and peered out the window to people-watch the passers-by more restaurant patrons began arriving.  It was a short wait before my food arrived.\n\nThe noodle dish (pictured) arrived first and it looked really good.  The soy sauce-based gravy was very light and actually worked well on this dish which combined lots of chicken with cabbage, celery, carrots, broccoli, zucchini, onions and a couple of prawns on a tightly packed bed of pan-fried rice noodles that actually looked like less than what was on the plate.  The combination of flavors was lightly seasoned, and I found that I enjoyed this dish.\n\nThe baby back ribs (also pictured) must have needed extra preparation, but it arrived just as I was finishing up on the noodle dish.  The ribs certainly had the aroma of barbecue ribs.  The soft tender pork was just slightly overcooked as parts of the meat had reached a level of jerkiness.  Most of the rib meat retained good moisture though and paired well with the thick, sticky, gooey sauce that tasted much like hoisin sauce and molasses.  These were a bit messy to eat but awesome nonetheless.\n\nOverall service is good, and the moderate prices are about the same as other restaurants of this type that I've sampled.  I would definitely return.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

On a monday night, the place got full up while we were there. We had the Soft Shell Crab (Cua Loi) and the Lotus root beef salad (goi bo) as appetizers. Both were fantastic, in particular the salad, which might have been my favorite dish of the night. A wonderfully fresh mix of flavors. For our entrees we had the Shaking Beef (bo luc lac) which was recommended by our server. It was the best I've had anywhere. Just perfectly cooked, high quality and great flavor. I found the lemon pepper sauce it came with superfluous as the beef itself was so flavorful. We also had the lamb chops encrusted in macadamia nut, brussel sprouts and japanese purple yam. The colors of the dish were striking. I thought a bit less of it vs  the other dishes: then again the  bar was set impossibly high by them) but my wife really liked it. I thought the macadamia crust didn't work that well with the lamb. But it was a very rich and hearty dish, perfect for the cold night.\n\nService was super and the whole evening was just right.

My friend was telling me that it was recently remodeled - which make sense since the pictures and food mentioned in past Yelp reviews do not resemble what I saw during my visit.\n\nRegardless, the \"new version\" of Le Soleil is fab!  It's so chic and modern yet not overly pretentious at all.  I know it sounds sort of absurd to love a restaurant's restroom but I really do appreciate the cleanliness and simple decor.  You can always tell how sanitary a restaurant is by its restroom.  As a germaphobe, I was pleased :)\n\nLet's move on to the food!  If you check in on Yelp, you get free spring rolls!  My friend and I opted for the BBQ pork spring rolls.  They were the smallest portions I have ever seen, but I think it might be because they were free. \n\nFor entree, I had the Five Spice Chicken w/ Brown Rice.  What I love about the chicken was that it was perfectly crispy around the edges and super juicy on the inside.  I took a bite of my friend's Shaken Beef and it was equally comparable to my dish.  The beef was so tender that it melted in my mouth.  I dunked it in the lemon pepper dipping sauce which gave it a nice tang. \n\nI recommend also getting a side of garlic noodles to share.  If you love eggs, then you'll absolutely love these garlic noodles.  There are chunks of garlic and eggs goodness buttered all over each strand of noodle.  So yummy!\n\nAs if we didn't already stuff our faces enough, we were tempted by the dessert selection and ordered the Fried Bananas w/ Coconut Ice Cream.  No regrets there!

My family of 4 ordered and shared the imperial rolls, shrimp green papaya salad, five spice chicken, shaken beef, and the lamb chops. Vietnamese imperial rolls are by far my favorite Asian deep fried eggroll, but the ones served here were dry and underwhelming, and the nuoc cham (dipping sauce it's typically served with) was flavorless. The salad was light and nicely plated, but again flavorless. Not surprised since the dressing for papaya salads typically is similar to nuoc cham. I'm guessing they're trying to cater to people who can't handle much fish sauce. The five spice chicken was tender but nothing special at all. The lamb chops were unique but the use of macadamia nuts were questionable and again, flavorless. The shaken beef was probably my favorite dish if I had to pick one. Oh, and the Thai iced tea wasn't bad either. \n\nIn sum, this is a great place if you are just being introduced to Southeast Asian food and aren't accustomed to the flavors of this cuisine, for the menu here has potential but is lacking in those flavors.

Even her green tea was flavorless, like from a cheap store-bought tea packet.\nThen, I ordered a \"cat fish and chips\". Total mistake. Everything on my plate was weird: the French fries were covered in sweet mango sauce (terrible combo), the salad had been infused by lavender water or something because it tasted like potpourri, the catfish was completely tasteless so I had so slather it in its accompanying sauce, which happened to be a too spicy bizarre combination of ranch and tartar sauce.\nAnd when we complained that everything was terrible the waitress laughed!\nThe only silver lining is that my mom wasn't charged for the flan debacle.\nI'll never be coming here ever again!!!", "author": "Nicky S."}

She wanted to get together with our niece and her sweetie who live in the city. They suggested Burmese Superstar on Clement. Well, when we got there around 1.30 pm on a Sat, there was a waiting list. Since I remarked that we had a BS in Alameda and that I thought whereas a few dishes were excellent, I thought that Burmese food I had tasted in the Bay Area was a fusion of Thai/Vietnamese and Indian food--but a fusion of the blandest of both! So she thought we could go elsewhere. YEAH!\n\nWe walked down Clement toward Arguello and went past several places. Le Soleil looked good despite no menu posted. James said he had eaten there before, and the food was decent. So we went.\nWe were seated right away. Decor was pleasant, not just basic. The menu was a little weird, all in English. It seemed they had appetizers, soups, rice plates, but no standard \"regular\" Vietnamese dishes. And even though I do not speak Vietnamese, I'm used to identifying the dishes by their native names. \n\nSo I started by ordering our beers: Bam-ba (bad vietnamese for 33). The waiter knew exactly what I wanted. I then started rattling off \"appetizers\" tapas-style in Vietnamese. I had no ides which of these were actually on the menu. I ended up asking for my favorite bo luc lac which I did not see on the menu, even described in english. Jack didn't see it either. But he said they had it.\n\nThe food was brought out in stages so we could enjoy everything. Condiments were brought automatically or on demand. Beers kept coming also upon request. \n\nThe cha gio and others came with all the wrappings the way they're supposed to be served. Everything was quite tasty. The bo luc lac came with the required  salt/pepper/lemon (or lime) dip, which is rare.\n\nSo we left very content. I'd definitely recommend this place.\n\nPost Script: I may have given this establishment 4 stars given yelp definitions. But after reading some of the horrific reviews, I think they deserve all the points to get their score up.", "author": "Nobbi L."}

The cup of chicken curry soup for $6 was the best thing we had.\n\nI went there the first week that after they had reopened and the staff was over attentive to the point of being annoying.

They arrived promptly as he ordered them as soon as we sat down.  The only thing missing was shrimp/pork, oh well.\n\nI ordered the 5 spice chicken, which came with rice and a delicious slaw/salad.  I expected a grilled chicken breast - I normally avoid anything fried because it makes me feel lethargic and greasy.  The dish arrived slightly before my professor's, which normally makes me angry, but his followed within 30 seconds - so I was happy.  \n\nThe chicken was lightly battered and fried to perfection, perfectly crisp and browned on the outside, juicy on the inside - I believe it was a thigh, brown and white meat, but not greasy at all.  It looked to perfect to disappoint my expectations, and it was tasty.  Not heavy at all, and the slaw that accompanied it was a perfect match - light, crunchy, and flavorful.  And what the hell, it's not as if I have any bikini competitions in the near future.  \n\nA neurotic side note, even the mint was freshly chopped - no browning of the edges (a personal pet peeve).  Oh yeah, the rice was good too - but steamed rice is nothing to write home about unless they really fuck it up, which they didn't.  The server made sure to bring two dishes of shiracha as requested, needing no reminder.\n\nThe professor's veggie curry looked good too - lots of broccoli, tofu, and a rich broth.  It also came with rice.  \n\nOverall, a good experience - and I already have plans to return with friends so that I can give their wine and beer list a try whilst enjoying a meal.", "author": "Chelsea J."}

There are California cuisine touches here and there in the food as well.\n\nThe East-West decor is showing some signs of age, but it's still appropriately beautiful and bourgeois for the mood and food presentation.\n\nI've been dying to have Vietnamese crepe (Ban Xeo) for quite some time now, but most places have jumped on the pho bandwagon and don't make it. Thank goodness Le Soleil makes Ban Xeo and it does it right!  \n\nThey don't cheat by putting eggs in the crepe  -- it's actually yellow from turmeric spice and made with rice flour which makes for a very crunchy crepe (eggs will make it soggy and runny). Local iron chef, Charles Phan has written about Vietnamese crepe in Food and Wine and Le Soleil's version is appropriately thin, crisp and crackles like thin glass under the fork and knife.\n\nIt came with the traditional fixings -- leafy lettuce, fresh mint (TONS of it -- they don't skimp on it here) , pickled onions, cucumber slices and julienned carrots.  The dipping sauce might look and taste the same as what's typically offered at cheaper Vietnamese places, but what is amazing is that they don't use MSG in this and any of their dishes and can still make savory meals.  \n\nAnother thing I like about the Ban Xeo Vietnamese crepe at LS is that they use shrimp, chicken and bean sprouts instead of the traditional shrimp, pork and sprouts combo.  I don't mind paying extra $$ since I could tell the ingredients were premium -- fresh and antibiotic/preservative free. They offer a vegetarian version which I'll have to try next time.\n\nThe service was very prompt and pleasant.  I only ordered soup (egg drop with asparagus and fresh crab which was delish, too) and the Ban Xeo crepe, but the waiter didn't have an attitude about it and was attentive throughout my meal asking me if everything was alright and filling my glass when empty.\n\nI ended up here on a whim, but next time I'll definitely come back to sample more.", "author": "Bodhi D."}

I'm a huge fan of Vietnamese food, so I was excited to try something that was not in Little Saigon. The restaurant met my expectations.\n\n- Ambiance: Cozy, sufficient space between tables, and not too packed on a Fri night. \n- Parking: A bit difficult. This may be the main downside. It is not easy for find parking in Inner Richmond, let alone for a restaurant right on Clement. I got lucky and had a spot 2 blocks down. \n- Perks: I checked into the restaurant on Yelp and immediately got an offer! This is the first I've ever gotten. We got a free pork spring roll, which was quite small but the process was super fast. I just showed the offer on my phone to the waitress and she immediately marked it on the bill. No scanning or anything needed.\n- Food: We ordered Bo Lac Lac, Sea Bass, Lamb chops and the Papaya Salad. Everything was delicious! Flavors were strong, but they had this lime/lemon sauce paired with each that helped to balance things out so I wasn't eating rice the whole time. They did offer brown rice. The meat for all 3 dishes were very tender, and though the portions looked small, I was surprisingly full after eating everything -- and there were 3 of us sharing all of this!\n\nI would definitely recommend this as a nice alternative for good Vietnamese food, which isn't in Little Saigon, but not as far as Sunset.

(i have no idea why other reviews say there is no pho on the menu). the beef in the noodles are actually flavored and marinated, not just a few simple slices of cow. the crab and shrimp noodle soup is fantastic. don't be alarmed when it comes out and the whole bowl is red. it's a tomato based soup with ground up shrimp and crab that creates a very rich seafood flavor. \n\nand don't forget the authentic vietnamese coffee!", "author": "Charmaine L."}

Finally I have found a yummy vietnamese restaurant that doesn't scare me with their cleanliness standards and doesn't skimp on the extras with the Pho. Of course you pay for that privilege at Le Soleil. It's more of a fancy version of your typical Viet place. Coming from Southern California, where I worked near one of the biggest Vietnamese communities in the state, I have been hunting for a decent place to match the quality of the food I was used to eating down south. So excited to find Le Soleil. I had the Beef Pho and the Imperial rolls. Both SO DELICIOUS! I was almost giggling when I ate it. And like I said they didn't skimp on the side goodies like lettuce, carrot, mint etc on the rolls and the Basil for the Pho. Which impresses me because invariably every time lately I order those dishes elsewhere I get like one sprig of basil and always have to ask for more.

Well, they explained that it's on the lunch menu but not the dinner menu and they made it for us, anyway. But what then to say about a Vietnamese restaurant that employs waitstaff that doesn't know what pho ga is. Seriously, without the menu to refer to, I asked for a bowl of pho ga and the waitress said \"I don't know what that is. We have pho soup.\" \n\nSo OK, I got the pho soup. A large bowl, because apparently the small is really small, like a normal bowl of soup small, not a small bowl of pho small. The broth was OK. The beef was well well over well done and there were also meatballs, which is a plus or minus depending on how you chose to look at it. \n\nBut it's a really nice looking place inside. And it's nice that they employ white people. Because not enough of them have jobs.", "author": "Will R."}

After that, we eventually stumbled into this place. \n\nIt looked like a little cafe on the outside (nothing special), but was nicely decorated on the inside. The service is a little better than your average vietnamese restaurant, but not spectacular either. \n\nNow for the food-\n1. the sampling platter w/ lemongrass beef, imperial rolls, shrimp, lettuce, pickled carrots and this rice paper tortilla was pretty good. I enjoyed the fact that it was a hands-on type of dish. We had to assemble it ourselves, and they were lucky that I was in that assembly mood that day.\n2. The curry chicken w/ rice was good. We all liked it, but for my personal taste, it could've been a bit thicker and heavier tasting. The chicken was very smooth (the way I like it, so probably chicken breast. Yes, I'm ABC), and maybe even packaged. \n3. The lemon grass beef w/ rice was just what it was.

This is my go-to if I want a pricier Vietnamese food than just pho/noodle soups! Everything is reasonably priced and portioned. I absolutely love the Brussels sprouts here, no bitterness at all (why I fell in love with Brussels sprouts!)! I love the appetizer sample which usually includes a piece of fried chicken, salad, spring roll/imperial roll, and crispy rice thing. It's a great way to try the appetizers that they offer ( they have a dessert platter too which is similar!). I have gotten the shaken beef (amazing!!!), sea bass (used to be better but now, a little too fishy for me), the curry with French bread (LOvE!!), and papaya salad! In the past, when they have lobsters, they cook it with sticky rice (I'm in heaven!) and it's the best!!

Since I live so far from home now I crave Vietnamese food more and more.  It is a good thing that I can find a decent restaurant closed to where I live.  I've dined at this restaurant twice and take out once and there will surely be future visits.  The first time I came here was for lunch.  I had the lamongrass noodle soup with fish and shrimp, which was delicious, because it tasted so authentic.  The grilled or charbroiled lemongrass pork and cucumber roll with fish dipping sauce was also delicious.  Besides the fact the it's not a traditional spring roll, all the other components are truly Vietnamese.  \n\nSecond time I came at dinner time.  I had the hot and sour soup with catfish and grilled pork.  I was taken by surprise how good the soup was.  It tasted like my mom's soup.  The rest would be history, because I came back and ordered the soup to go.....which will be the first of many times.  It's so difficult to find a restaurant that makes foods taste like something your mom makes.  The noodle soup and hot and sour catfish soup here achieved to do so, which is number one in my mental book.  \n\nIf you love Vietnamese food you must try this place.  Even though the concept is Americanize, the food lives up to its name of being AUTHENTIC!  However, you must go in the restaurant for the actual menu, because the one online is not even a portion of the menu in house.", "author": "Mai-Tam N."}

At 6:30PM, the place was already packed. It was a good thing we snatched the last table for four. By the time we order, the line was out the door. I guessed after being in business for more than a decade (as long as I can remember for they could be in business much longer), their menu and quality of food are still consistent and offering authentic dishes like Bun Siu (rice pancake) and imperial rolls. \n\nOn this visit, we had: \n\nFor appetizers, the mango salad, beef cappacio and my all time favorite -- Bun Siu (Vietnamese pancake made with rice flour and stuffed with sauteed bean sprouts and shrimps). The pancakes came with fresh lettuce leaves, mint, pickled carrots, daikons and garlic. The way you eat Bun Siu is take a helping of the pancake and wrapped it with a piece of lettuce leaf, add some mint, top with some pickled vegetables and drizzle some fish sauce and chow down the yummy, crispy pancake. So good! \n\nFor our entrees, we ordered some garlic noodles, sizzling seafood plate and sauteed string beans with garlic sauce to share family style. The garlic noodles were made with egg noodles sauteed with garlic butter. It was creamy, garlicky and hearty. A little goes a long way when it comes to this dish. \n\nThen on to a plate of sauteed string beans with garlic. The string beans were cooked perfectly al-dante so that it still has a crunch to it. Overcooked string beans can be such turn off for me. Our final dish was the sizzling spicy seafood plate with Manila clams, fish fillet, shrimps and calamari. A combination of seafood sauteed with a spicy garlic and basil sauce and serve on a screaming hot sizzling plate. It was perfect dish to eat with steamed rice. The seafood is spicy and hot (temperature) and the sauce was so delicious. \n\nBy the time we finished our dinner, we ran out of room for desserts. But we were satisfied, so no desserts required. Even though it's been a while since I visited Le Soleil, the food quality and taste still remained its consistency. That said a lot of the restaurant and its management.

I live in San Jos\u00e9 and don't get a lot of opportunities to sample Vietnamese cuisine in the city, so we came by Le Soleil after finding them on Yelp.\n\nFirst off, the restaurant is very clean and well decored. As for the menu, it actually confused me and my mom at first because the dishes were listed in English instead of Vietnamese. (My Vietnamese is not great but I know what all my favorite dishes are called!) However, our waitress was very helpful: She let us read the waitstaff's \"annotated\" menu with the Vietnamese names written in. It was a big help.\n\nBecause of this, we were a little concerned that the cuisine would be too Americanized, but all the food was delicious. The beef \"look luck\" (i.e., b\u00f2 l\u00fac l\u00e1c or \"shaken beef\") was tender and flavorful. The spicy lemongrass chicken (g\u00e0 xa \u00f3t) was good as well, although prepared a little differently from the traditional style with a somewhat \"wetter\" sauce and string beans. The price was a bit high for Vietnamese food ($14 a head) but warranted by the quality of the preparation. Overall a very good dining experience.", "author": "Tony L."}

With a full menu--from garlic noodles to fresh clams to bbq lemongrass beef--this isn't just another pho shop.   Recent  renovations, designer furniture and moderate price increases lead one to wonder if the restaurant has been sold or simply aspires to be  the Slanted Door.

For some reason, at least on the night we went, there was no music. I think it needed music. \n\nI liked the crispy vegetarian imperial rolls, served with leaf lettuce, rice noodles and mint. I loved the salty plum soda, which has a smashed up salty plum in the bottom of the glass! I was a little disappointed with the soft shell crab dish. I know it's not fair to compare to Slanted Door (there's a reason Slanted Door has such a loyal following and you have to make a reservation months ahead of time for a weekend night), but Slanted Door's soft shell crab is so delicately battered and fried and just so delicious and complex tasting... Le Soleil's was heavily battered and fried, so it didn't look like a little crab anymore... it could have been a piece of fried fish, or a piece of fried zucchini, or a piece of fried anything. The oiliness overpowered the crab-ness, and although the portion was very generous (four little crabs), we ate one each and declined the others. \n\nWe also ordered a grilled chicken dish, which is served with rice wrappers, and you roll it all up yourself. They give you a stack of plastic steamer separators with the delicate rice wrappers between the separators, but we got an empty stack. I politely explained this to our server (I wasn't mad, I thought it was kind of funny) and he explained to me that between each separator is a rice wrapper... etc.\nI explained that I understood, but there really were no wrappers in the stack. After some back and forth he lifted some of the separators and, looking surprised, disappeared with them and came back with the wrappers. \n\nIt might have just been an off night for Le Soleil, but we probably won't go back, because it was just okay, and there are other really delicious places so nearby.", "author": "Dani Y."}

If you still find that sort of thing amusing, but have the self-respect to avoid Danted Sloor, you could visit Le Soleil.\n\nActually, Le Soleil used to be a good Vietnamese restaurant, even if the menu was mostly in English.  But now it's something else, with mostly non-VN staff, and the target customer market coming for the newest bourgeois bohemian indulgence, that exotic Vietnam flavor.  You know it's a certain type of place when it advertises itself as \"authentic.\"  Everything is heavily sugared (and no, it's not just the Southern VN cooking style), and it's a creepy Polynesian-kitch-restaurant flashback that they have a fondness for the varied culinary possibilities of the pineapple.  Can I have a mai-tai?\n\nLe Soleil is neither as expensive nor as stupidly pretentious as Danted, the servers are serviceable, and the food isn't terrible.  It could be a gentle introduction to Vietnamese food.  The lack of spice and seasoning could be a benefit for certain crowds.  But the place has limits.

I was sniffling, sleeping, not feeling good.  In fact I was whining- to myself I might add.  If talking to oneself is bad, and answering is crazy, then whining to yourself is total-tinfoil hat-batshit nuts.  I'm glad I was able to conquer my mental illness and make it out of the house.  Anyhoo, I digress.\n\nPoint is, I was feeling under the weather and wanted some chicken soup.  Seemed like an appropriate thing to do. Cold+Me= Chicken soup.  Simple math.  Seeing as how I abhore canned food as much as possible, and how I had been lying in a puddle of self-pity watching terrible daytime TV for several hours, I decided not to go to Arguello Supermarket and get a can of soup.  No! I would boldly resist my cold viruses (virii?) and venture across Geary to Clement and get some chicken soup, dammit. \n\nSomehow I ended up at Le Soliel.  Probably because I was sick and tired of walking and Soliel was right there.  I went in and would've gotten their imperial roll/bbq pork lunch special but I was there for soup!  And lo and behold, out comes the most bland soup I've ever had.  Even the noodles surprised me at their boring-ness, and I go into a noodle eating situation with every intention that the noodles were boring.  These were really, really boring noodles.  And the chicken was somehow dry, despite being served in hot soup.  Don't understand that one myself, but I took a bite of the chicken and said, \"Damn! That's some fucking dry chicken!\".\n\nShould've gone to Pho Clement.  Oh well, live and learn.  I did go home and watch Cool Runnings on cable though, and that cheered me up even though I still get kinda choked up at the end when they crash their bobsled and they all (even Sanka Coffee!) has to carry the sled across the finish line to finish the race.

But wishy washy wait-staff left us wondering whether we would ever get our food.  \r\n\r\nThe hostess's face lit up when I asked what time they closed, as if she'd alighted on a bright idea.  After pausing to weigh the propriety of her approach, she ventured, \"9:45pm,\" then as if she'd just rubbed off a lottery ticket and wanted to see whether fortune was with her, she challenged us:  \"What time is it?\"  Discouraged by our 9:25pm answer, she seated us, asked with a still smoldering spark of hope whether we might be in a rush, scowled at our non-affirmative answer, failed to bring us a 2nd menu, nearly tipped over my water glass during a \"drive-by\" set down, informed me that only 1 of the three Vietnamese beers on offer was in stock, and all-in-all left us feeling like we'd better hurry up and spend our money or she might just complain to our supervisor!  \r\n\r\nFortunately, the hot and sour soup was good.

It definitely looked promising, though there was no pho on the menu.  Fair enough - this is not a pho kinda place.  Still in the mood for soup (feeling under the weather and all), the three of us shared a lemongrass coconut chicken soup.  We had to order two bowls because one is not enough for 3 to share.  Pretty good...not memorable.  Could have used more substance (more chicken, more pineapple...that's their thing).  We also shared \"steamed\" asparagus that came out in a sauce and definitely looked more sauteed than anything else.  Again, fair enough...they were definitely tasty asparagus, but not steamed (I know my health-conscious dining pal was peeved).\n\nBut the biggest disappointment was with the \"Table-side fire grill chicken\", with which came rice paper and all the fixings to make small rolls.  There was no fire, there was no grill.  More upsetting was the fact that we saw a table with a flaming piece of meat that looked amazing.  Are we not good enough for a flame?  The chicken (and resulting rolls) were good, but not memorable.  And frustratingly, as we sat and ate perhaps our ill-ordered items, I had table envy.  I wanted that flaming beef at table 2.  I wanted those delicious looking rolls at table 4.  I wanted the crispy little dumplings at table 7...\n\nIf I go back, I'll be sure to order differently...as there's nothing more frustrating than not getting what you thought you were getting.

It was over saturated with some form of corn starch making it basically slimey and not soupy at all.  It basically tasted poor.\n3)  We ordered \"Salt & Black Pepper Tiger Prawn\" and you know what?  It was basically a super duper salty typical stir fry shrimp with onions and no pepper.  \n\nNo tiger prawns.  No pepper.  Just Salt.   We *did* ask the waiter if this was the correct dish his reply was \"Yes this is how the Vietnamese style of cooking is\".   I almost laughed because....

It was just a typical cheap Chinese stir fry dish done poorly with WAY WAY too much salt.\n\nMaybe they were better before but I have to say avoid this place for now.", "author": "So L."}

Parking was a bitch, but it was worth it just to stumble in past their giant fish tank at the entrance to breathe in the scent of their vegetarian hot and sour soup on a cold foggy night.  Then I moved to Berkeley, broke up with the boyfriend, and haven't had an excuse to go back in about six years.\n\nUntil Saturday night!  My friend Rico was in town from LA and looking for a quintessential SF dining experience, so in a burst of inspiration I suggested Le Soleil.  The decor has improved considerably in the intervening years (no more fish tank!), but the food hasn't changed a bit and is just as fantastic as it ever was.  We started with the aforementioned veggie hot and sour soup, and it came brimming with tomatoes, pineapple, and tofu in a richly aromatic broth.  Next up were vegetarian spring rolls and the Vietnamese vegetarian crepe, the latter delightfully light and crispy and stuffed full of mushrooms and bean sprouts.  That was actually plenty of food for me right there, but Rico and his friend Jim also ordered main courses of the pan fried rice noodles with prawns and the lemon grass beef, with rice on the side.  And then for dessert I insisted on splitting a fried banana drizzled with honey and accompanied by coconut ice cream. There were absolutely no complaints.  \n\nI'm so happy that despite its face-lift the restaurant is the same old Le Soleil I loved back in the day.  I do miss that fish tank though.", "author": "Heidi D."}

But I feel if RKN came to SF this place would be a prime location for a show. \n\nWe settled there because we were walking around Clement for some time trying to figure out where to eat, and out of sheer hunger we decided we'd give it a shot. I should have know when we noticed the place was completely empty on a Thursday night, besides one couple sitting in the back of the room, that this place was gonna bomb. And bomb it did. \n\nGetting back to RKN. Judging by the old newspaper clippings and various dated awards this place so proudly displays on the walls, this joint used to be pretty good. But the fact that the latest clipping on the wall was from 2000 should tell you something. I think this place must have lost it's chef or come under new ownership or something because the restaurants in the newspaper clippings, was not the restaurant I was in that night. \n\nIt would be another classic episode.\n\nRestaurant was good.... Something happened... Now, not so good. \n\nThe customers start to dwindle and the place starts losing money. The chef has lost his passion and the owner is trying to hold on to the old reputation and still charge the high prices for food. Even though the quality has gone down because the chef has been cutting corners. So the customers dwindle more because the food they are receiving and the prices don't match up. So Gordon comes in and tries the garlic shrimp clay pot (like me). He realizes when it comes that he's just paid $17 for 2 whole shrimp with heads on and 1 shrimp with no head (that's right 3 shrimp, and not big ones either) in a broth that absolutely reeks of fish sauce. Then his lemon grass chicken comes and he is appalled by its flavorless, lifeless existence. Then he gets up from the table goes to kitchen and tells the chef \"that food was absolute shit mate\". Then he spends an hour (TV time) whipping the place into shape and giving customers value for their money. Alas, Le Soliel is back to its former glory (i think) and finally giving some competition to Burma Superstar and the Pizza place down the street. \n\nNibb High Football RULES!!!!", "author": "Lawrence A."}

We've seen this place and have driven by so many times. I guess we had really high expectations for this place and thought that it would be like upscale Vietnamese cuisine. Why pay more for Vietnamese food if you can get something tastier down the street for a way better price?Not sure, but we thought that we would just try it. The decor in this restaurant is lovely, but that seems to be the only thing that they have going for them. We walked into the restaurant and waited for someone to acknowledge us. Took a bit, but I guess I was expecting too much? We were seated and were handed our menus. It was interesting that the menu was in English only. My bf wanted to order Bun Bo Hue, but we couldn't tell which item it was on the menu(depending on where you go, it's called something different in English), but if it was in Vietnamese we wouldn't have had a problem. I guess it didn't matter since my bf ordered in Vietnamese anyway. I ordered the lemon grass chicken over rice. My rice plate came out first. I was pleasantly surprised.... the chicken was really tasty, not dry at all and the green beans were cooked just right no soggy green beans I thoroughly enjoyed it, but...... the portion was way too small for the price, like I said earlier. I could get more and something that tastes better for a fraction of the cost down the street. Don't get me wrong, the plate was esthetically pleasing and the the rice plate was not absurdly expensive, but for the price somewhere else, I would've have more on my little plate. When my bf's bowl of Bun Bo Hue arrived, we were pleasantly surprised, but not in a good way. You know how when the Bun Bo Hue arrives and it's piping hot  with that spicy oil floating on the top of the broth? He had none of that going on, none at all. The broth was the blandest that I have ever tasted. He had to add a whole lot of hot sauce, but you know what that did? It just made the bowl of soup taste just like watery Sriracha. Very disappointing. The service was super slow. When he asked for the hot sauce, he waited and waited. I was practically done with my rice plate before the hot sauce came. Half the restaurant was filled, it was not super busy and there were also two waiters. All in all, I would probably not come back here again, not for the service or the food, which is too bad, since we both really wanted to like this restaurant.", "author": "carebear l."}

The fried crepe was a decent app but after that, the \"Wok Fried Sea Scallops\" turned out to be a chinese sauced dish of mixed veggies w/ a smattering of small bay scallops (that had too much baking soda/flour agent, eeks) to the tune of $16.  The Large Mushroom and Tofu clay pot had only a few pitiful slices of mushroom pieces.  And where was the Vietnamese flavor in all of that?  Gone are the days of Dennis' flair for Vietnamese spices and French style cooking that made him infamous at the Taste of Asia Wine/Menu Tasting series is my guess.  And now in its place is overpriced chinese food ($70 for 2 ppl) disguised as vietnamese catering to a non-asian crowd.  I'm bummed!", "author": "Vivian C."}

I needed a Vietnamese restaurant with at least  some nod towards the health code...made the mistake of visiting the bathroom at Tu Lan once and could never get the nerve to return. Anyway, I digress. The food took a noticeable turn for the worse about two years ago but seems to have righted itself during a recent visit. Imperial rolls are awesome and once again have flavor; ditto the five spice chicken. Decor okay, but the skirts on the tables make it hard for me to get my legs under the table. It was a welcome remodel several years ago, when the place stopped being a dump thanks to new owners, but you got your money's worth and it's time to have tables more appropriate for sitting.", "author": "Christopher H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2005-06-06", "description": "this place makes the best vermicelli with vietnamese style bbq pork, and fried imperial rolls.  unlike a lot of vietnamese places in the tenderloin, the imperial rolls here come out fresh tasting instead of rancid (due to stale and overused oil in the fryer).  their rolls are also REALLY tightly packed, so they come out with a nice firm texture, instead of the oily, loosely packed rolls you get at most other places that end up falling apart.  their dinners are also outstanding.  i highly recommend the fish curry, the eggplant, the dry cooked green beans, and the vietnamese crepes (for lunch or dinner).  the crispy vietnamese crepes (made out of a mung bean batter, and infused with yummy coconut milk, and filled with sprouts, chicken, shrimp, and topped with fresh mint, et al are heavenly.", "author": "Curtis Y."}

Lovely decor and the bathroom was clean (a good indication that a restaurant cares about the whole package, so to speak). I had the lemon chicken and it came with green beans which were excellent. The dessert was lovely too. The portions were plentiful and were tastefully presented. The service was attentive but not intrusive. I would definitely recommend Le Soleil to people, based on my experience alone. I was being treated to lunch so cannot accurately make a comment on pricing, although I did not think it was expensive when I first looked at the menu. Bon Appetite.", "author": "mary f."}

The ambiance of the place has improved: polished wood seats, tempered glass tabletops, and nice flatware.  However, in a Yelp world where service makes all the difference, I was disappointed in that arena.  They have my favorite dish in the city, the sizzling seafood platter, so when we were seated and given menus, I hardly had to look at mine.  With 4 tables in the place and a guy in the back making eye contact with me the whole time, we had to wait 15 minutes before they came by to take our order.  Then the beverage guy started running from table to table filling up water glasses, spilling water all over the table in the process.  I might be able to forgive and forget if the place was even remotely busy but, unfortunately, that wasn't the case.  But that dish...oh that dish...yum yum goodness!!  Once the food arrived, I had practically forgotten the unpleasantness and entered culinary euphoria.  Fresh calamari, clams, and catfish, saturated in a to-die-for chili & cilantro sauce, sizzling, and massive to boot.  Fab, fab, fab : )  The bf settled on the catfish dish, which sounded healthy & light on the menu but came out fried and bland.  I felt bad for him because mine was so good and just as I was about to chalk all the bad service up as an off night, I bit into a piece of something extremely hard and so loud that the bf grimaced! The face I gave made him look down at his plate and say,  \"I sense a scathing Yelp review\".  I would write off this place if they didn't have the amazing dish and we know that sometimes the tummy has the final word, so I'll be back... to pick up my take-out!  And remember... Chew responsibly.", "author": "Tara G."}

My family helped sponsor several Vietnamese refugee families (in Florida) in the 70's so I grew up eating Vietnamese food - with a French flare.  Do not be so naiive as to think there is only one style of Vietnamese food.  That is like saying southern cooking is \"US cuisine.\"  The service if friendly and I have always been treated like family.  The Vietnamese-French fusion menu is delightful.  It has the subtlety and complexity of French colonial with the fresh, light touch of Vietnamese.  Their raw marinated beef is delicate and I love the crackle when you eat if with the rice crackers it is served with.  Their flaming bowls are succulent.  I also have always enjoyed the crab asparagus soup.  So, I live in Santa Cruz County and am going to drive to The City with friends to introduce them to this jewel on Clement.", "author": "Drew M."}
