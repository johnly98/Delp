Her name was Nancy. From the moment she took our order, she just had a glow that often times is lacking at fast-paced retail establishments...\n\nI told Nancy about how my 10 year old son keeps a stack-ranked list of his favorite burgers, with Super Duper Burger consistently as #1, since the family trip to SF in 2015. Her eyes lit up and I could immediately see just how much she not only appreciated the story and my son's passion for her burgers, but she clearly took pride in where she works and to her customer experience matters. \n\nNancy proceeded to serve our order and then asked me to wait for her while she got something. She came back with not only a stack of free vouchers but also a #12 order beeper (#12 is my son's soccer number) with the biggest smile and look of joy on her face. \n\nAs my business partner and I finished our glorious burgers, I couldn't help but feel the great vibes Nancy sent to me and my son -- as a result Super Duper Burger is at the top of my customer experience list.", "author": "Preston J."}

Nice vibe inside with good music.  It's pretty cramped inside and all the tables were full (I guess that's a good sign. Because it means that the food is good) so we got lucky that not many people know that there's a small loft upstirs with tables for additional seating.\n\nWe ordered 2 super burgers which consisted of 2 8oz patties with lettuce, mayo, secret sauce, tomato, cheese, grilled onions and bacon (additional charge for cheese $0.75 and bacon $1.25) and it was worth it.  We ordered another super burger with cheese but this one without bacon on ciabatta bread because the hamburger bun had sesame seeds and I'm highly allergic.  I also asked them to cut it in 1/2 because I was sharing this was my daughter and the full burger portion is pretty big.  The burgers did not disappoint - it was so juicy and the taste was really good.  If you're looking for a way to eat this burger without getting messy, there isn't one.  The juices just oozed out of the burger.   We also ordered the garlic fries $3.50 (and heck yeah it was soooooo good) made with lots of garlic and aged cheese...  you can definitely taste the garlic.  And an order of regular fries (which was just the right amount of crispiness) so me just right.  We didn't order any drinks but was given plastic cups for ice water.  \n\nThe condiment station had ketchup, mustard and pickles (those pickles were super tasty!). \n\nThe burgers were better than what I imagined it would be.  Way better than Shake Shack (which I think is way overpriced and not filling).  I'd rank it a step above In-N-Out.\n\nAll in all, a good burger for $8.25 (plus $0.75 for the cheese and $1.25 for the bacon)  so a total of $10.25 without paying for the gourmet price at a restaurant and in the city, that's a deal.  We spent $48 for lunch - not too shabby.\n\nI'm glad our hotel concierge recommended this place.  It was within walking distance (about 2 blocks) from where we were staying at The Intercontinental Hotel.", "author": "Ann C."}

I was in San Francisco for a very short trip and since my stomach was still on east coast time I stopped in at around 3 PM on a Sunday. This place was packed! I certainly didn't expect to wait 15 minutes for my food but on the other hand that's a really good sign about the food if the place is crowded at 3 PM. \n\nThe burger was very good just heed the warning on the packaging, \"this could get messy\" and it did. A very juicy burger that was really satisfying. The fries were okay, actually reminding me of fries from that huge world burger chain. Not necessarily a bad reference but the fries didn't stand out to me. \n\nI was a little unhappy that they were out of tea at 3 PM in the afternoon. They just don't understand what a tea addict I am; perhaps tea is not as widely loved here as it is from my neck of the woods. \n\nGreat burger and I recommend you give this place a try.", "author": "William R."}

Even though they have a couple of locations around the Bay Area, I've never seen or heard of this chain prior to my visit.\n\nI ended up getting the Super burger, garlic fries, and a kid's size Oreo shake. For the price you can probably get a larger burger somewhere else, but I found the patty to be well seasoned and grilled perfectly to a medium rare. The fries weren't overly oily or salty but they were a bit dry. I definitely could have demolished a full sized shake, but the kid's size is great if you just want to have a taste to soothe the sweet tooth. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my visit to Super Duper Burgers.

They were super busy and yet their organization and system they have situated was proof of what ended up being a really decent experience.\nThere were a ton of employee's working the kitchen, a few were working the front registers, and one girl was trying to maintain the restaurant in keeping it clean ( A feat inevitably impossible for one poor girl during a crazy weekend event).  Nevertheless, the fact the employees stayed busy, stayed friendly, and really tried to keep a good experience for their guests really made me happy.\nOf course their burgers were amazing.  I always get the Super Duper Burger w/cheese which is an extra 75 cents.  \n\nI have gone to their other location where I did enjoy their burger very much, but the only issue I had was just how liquid greasy it was.  Here at this location the burger was not nearly as greasy and a lot more enjoyable, Kudos to the cooks here.  But in all honesty, whichever location you end up eating at, these burgers are definitely one of the better burgers you are going to get in the Bay Area.  Very filling, juicy, and comforting to eat!\nWe usually get the garlic fries with 3 different dipping sauces to choose from.  I enjoy the variety of sauces a lot!  I'm not sure i'm a big fan of the cheesy garlic fries though.  they are always also pretty greasy and usually end up ditching the cheese loaded on them anyways.  I guess if you are a cheese lover you'll enjoy this dish lol.", "author": "Tori G."}

The employees are always nice, and your meal is always prepared quickly, even when the lines are long. Super Duper also has breakfast sandwiches and milkshakes (can get them spiked).

Now they are spread out all around SF downtown. Our family wanted to hang around the Metreon (Yerba Buena). My husband, kids and I were hungry. So we dropped by here last Thursday.\n\nThe price did went up a bit since the last time we were here. I remember we paid about $9.50 for a mini combo and now is $10.50. Cashier is very cool and patient with us. Ordered 2 mini combos with cheese. Lettuce, tomatoes, onions and sauce included. I sub mines for garlic fries and paid 75 cents difference. Got two soft drinks also with the combo. Our son didn't want anything besides fries and a kids malt milkshake. \n\nThe guys at the front counter are friendly and always had a smile on their face. They are courteous and kind. I ask for a small plastic cup for my daughter to get her some water. I didn't want a glass just in case she drops it. \n\n4/5 our burgers was a lil oily but it was still tasty. The meat is cooked medium rare which is recommended. When I was preggo with my daughter I requested to be cooked well done before. Which is also an option for those who can't eat medium rare meat. \n\n5/5 fries are the bomb! I wish they had more aged cheese sprinkled on it. The reg. Fries are good too. It is not soggy or oily. The texture have a crunch to it.

I spent a little over $14 to have a combo meal which would've cost around $6 at the local Wendy's.  \n\nFirst off, I will say the staff was excellent and deserve 5 stars.  All of them very nice and attentive.  I wish there was a way to rate different aspects of service on Yelp.\n\nThe 2 stars is strictly for the food.  I love hamburgers.  I've eaten a lot of them.  I had seen Super Duper Burgers on the Yelp map a couple of visits ago to SF and finally decided to go in.  I thought w/ all the great reviews this place had.......I had to check it out myself.  I'm just not sure what people see or taste at this establishment because it just didn't do it for me.\n\nThe hamburger was about the size of Wendy's Single burger, just a tad bit wider.  I'll give them credit, it did taste fresh, but that's all.  There just wasn't a \"WOW\" factor to this burger at all.  No spectacular taste or sauce that stood out.  Nada. Even the bacon I had added in was stiff as a board.\n\nI did upgrade the fries to garlic fries due to the amount of good reviews I had read about them.  Nada, again.  Yes, they tasted like garlic, but it wasn't even a fantastic garlic taste.  One thing that stood out for the fries was they were very crispy -- I'll give them credit for that because I do love crispy fries.  I'll honestly say, the limited-run garlic fries McDonalds produces every so often have a better taste, so wait for those to come out again if you want garlic fries.  \n\nSuper Duper Burgers, I really wanted to like you guys based on the Yelp reviews.

A few of our other colleagues had suggested Super Duper and after looking on the Yelp app, we decided to check it out for ourselves. \n\nFor a Sunday night, the line was at the door. It moves fairly quickly though, which is good if you're in a rush or have reached hangry level. How it works is you order from the counter, take a buzzer, and find a table or take it to go. Once your buzzer buzzes, you grab your food. Simple, easy, fast. \n\nYou'd think for how quick the service is that their quality would be similar to McDonald's or Burger King, but NOPE, it was far from it. The bun was soft, but didn't fall apart, the veggie patty was actually really tasty, and all the sauces and veggies were a great touch. My gal pal got the cheesy garlic fries on the side and I would definitely recommend getting them if you're feeling really hungry. The fries portions are fairly generous, so if you don't have a big appetite, I'd get them to share. \n\nFor a fast food joint, I was pleasantly surprised and impressed.

I even had snarky thoughts of artisan beef, gluten-free eggs, and vegetarian-fed buns. However, during my visit I ended up being super duper blown away by the true commitment to quality and sheer deliciousness.\n\nI was a fan of the $6.50 vegetarian burger +$1 for avocado (back story: I actually don't like burgers because they tend be greasy and make me feel gross, but I'm obligated to accompany the boo whose love for burgers rivals Thrillist). \n- The bean-based patty was remotely similar to falafel except more grainy, and it came together perfectly with the creamy hummus and super sauce, standard burger condiments including refreshing cucumbers, and a toasty bun.\n- When they say artisan bun, they are serious--the bun had that perfect amount of crisp on the exterior contrasting a pillow-soft interior. \n- The proportions were on point as well, with an excellent balance of flavors. \n- (Surprisingly, the burger fit in my mouth and I didn't have to eat it horizontally, though I don't know about the double)\n\nI also recommend the $3.25 small vanilla shake, which is essentially creamy soft serve in a cup. For better or for worse, SF has trained me to consider Straus Family Creamery's organic products as the standard for dairy. \n\nPro tips:\n*Get the kids size shake! As specified on the menu it's not just for kids, and allows for indulgence that will fit in your post-burger stomach\n*Note that vegetarian-fed doesn't mean grass-fed (this is when my skepticism of SF artisan-ness comes in useful)\n*The prices are in the range of fast-casual in the FiDi; it's worth it as Super Duper is a distinctive notch up from In-N-Out and not as exorbitant as the pretentious craft burgers at fancy restaurants", "author": "Edna C."}

Big juicy patties, nice fluffy buns, and great fresh veggies. You'll have to make sure to practice widening your jaw to get it in your mouth nicely.\n\nThe Establishment: Crowded, a little greasy, and very loud.

Logistically, I love counter service fast casual since you get better-than-fast-food cuisine without the hassle of a table service ordeal.  Also, their burgers are simply amazing.\n\nSuper Burger w/ Cheddar Cheese: This is better than any fast food burger (sorry In-N-Out) and beats many wait service joints.  There's a real distinct sear around each moist patty making for a great flavor and texture contrast.  The bun is just the right thickness and texture to accompany the burger without becoming a distraction.  The secret sauce isn't that noticeable to me, which is a good thing because I'd rather taste burger than sauce.  In my opinion it's best to get cheddar cheese, all the free toppings and jalape\u00f1os,  Just the right size to fill you up, but not make you feel gross afterwards.\n\nFries: Not quite beating the benchmark of McDonald's fry greatness, but they seem to definitely have upped their fry game since opening.  A nice thin thickness with every fry being crispy, but not overdone.\n\nPickles: All the pickles you could ever want, for free.  They're a great appetizer to get your mouth primed for the burger as you wait.  During the meal, their sourness helps cut the fatty richness of the burger.", "author": "Adam B."}

I used to go to the Super Duper on Kearny Street. Their doughnuts were awesome, small, fluffy, like a miniaturized version of a Dunkin' Donut. At this location, the donuts are skinny and anemic.

I got the normal fries and they were cooked exactly how I requested. I think they give you a smaller portion of fries when you order to go versus eating in. \n\nI thought that for the price, portion and flavor, you get a pretty good deal here.

I decided to grab a burger there on one of our lunch breaks after seeing all of the great reviews. You enter and join the line (there usually is a line) on the left. The menu has a few different items, but most people come for the burgers and fries. You can get the double burger which is 2 beef patties or the mini which is only 1 patty. You can choose various toppings like cheese. There are a bunch of other \"free toppings\" including lettuce, tomato, onions, and jalapenos. You pay and they take your name for the order. I ended up getting a double burger with all of the free toppings and I added Avocado (for $1.00) for a total of about $10. After about 5 minutes my name was called. There is a small condiment area with ketchup and mustard as well as pickles. There is a decent amount of seating there but I wouldn't bet on snagging a seat during peak lunch times. The burger was really good. I would definitely rate is miles apart from fast food places including In-and-Out. It was really filling as well with all of the toppings. The staff was very efficient.

The base price of the super burger is around $7.75 but adds up when you want to do add ons such as bacon, cheese, avocado, mushrooms (ranges from $.50-1.50+ per add on).

I had only been here once before but I had only tried a milkshake (Cookies & Cream - amazing btw). \n\nThis time I ventured out and got a burger. I ordered the Mini Burger because let's be real, the \"Mini Burger\" is actually just a normal sized burger (1 patty) vs the double patty or the \"Super Burger.\" This burger came with lettuce, tomato, onions, and super sauce, plus i added cheese. I also ordered garlic fries and a diet coke - necessary pairing with any burger. \n\nThis burger was really juice and really yummy. It is a good amount of food though, i don't know if i would ever order the double patty but hey that's just me because you gotta save room for dessert!

Didn't have grilled onion in it but I was too lazy to go and tell them. Really good size where the burger fit right into my hand.  The only thing I noticed was that they kind of skimped out on the lettuce.  Just one small piece was in mine and I didn't find that enough for me.  \nTheir garlic fries were delicious though.

The first time, we all ordered separately, and everyone got their food in a pretty quick amount the time.  Well, except for me and my husband.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and garlic fries and he ordered a cheeseburger.  After 15 minutes went by and everyone was just about done eating, I went up to the counter and talked to the lady helping expedite.  I say helping loosely.  She mostly stood at the end of the counter talking to a guy he must work there or manage.  Sooo when I talk to her, I ask if my order got lost or something, so she looks at my receipt and says oh. You ordered chicken, that takes longer.  Then she asks the kitchen and I see them look at my ticket that is at the very front of the line, which is a good 3-4 feet away from the other tickets.  So, I wait another 5 minutes before our food is done.  So instead of being honest with me and telling me that our order got misplaced, she gave me a line of crap before even asking.  I'm a manager in food service and have found that as long as you are honest, people are pretty chill.  But I guess others don't feel that way.  \nBut I must say, the food was amazing. It was absolutely delicious and I would definitely recommend the garlic fries.  They are fantastic. \n\nI do have to say that on the second trip, my chicken sandwich only took like 5 minutes!!

Since I was one of the people to suggest having burgers for lunch, someone volunteered me to go get them. I stopped by this location on Thursday, May 28th around 12 noon. I ordered pickup for 15 people: 15 burgers, about 10 orders of fries and a shake.\n\nMy order consisted of:\n*Mini burger: 4oz patty with super sauce, add Cheese, Roasted portabello, Organic egg\n*Garlic fries: fresh garlic and 6 month aged cheddar\n*Add three dips: Super sauce, Housemade mayo, Chipotle\n\nThe burger was the perfect size! I loved the addition of the mushroom and egg. I wish the egg was oozy, but I'm not sure if Super Duper does that. Would have made the burger that much more delicious. The garlic fries were great too! Loved the cheese. Would pass next time on the dips. Super rich and didn't really add anything to the garlic fries in my opinion.\n\nMy one complaint about Super Duper is they don't take advance takeout orders. I wish they did as it would have made the ordering process easier. I know we had a huge order, so I typed everything out in list form as to who wanted what. I figured it would make things easier. But the cashier looked super overwhelmed by the listed and asked us to read it off instead. This ended up in some errors in our order. Plus, she said each burger would have it's own ticket describing the burger. Unfortunately, some burgers shared tickets (like 3 to a ticket) and it got super confusing. Getting condiments for 15 people is also another thing in itself. I think everyone waiting to get ketchup, mustard and pickles hated me.\n\nOther than the typical issues that arise out of placing a huge order, I enjoyed celebrating national hamburger day.

I do like the fact that this location is at The Metreon so that I could stop by before or after a movie.\n\nMy usual here is a Mushroom and Jack Cheese Super Burger with Aged Cheddar & Garlic Fries.  So Good!  (http://bit.ly/OCdYkD)  It's pretty funny though how I'm always tempted to get the Super with two patties, when their Mini Burger with one single patty  would be just enough.  The Aged Cheddar & Garlic Fries are pretty heavy and could actually pass for a meal on their own!  \n\nService has been hit or miss here for me though.  On one occasion, I ordered my burger which was a simple Mini Burger with Jack Cheese and for some reason the cashier didn't pay attention to my order and asked if I wanted everything on it, so I had to repeat my order again.  Well after a long wait, I got my burger and it was literally a plain Mini-Burger with nothing.  Just bun and meat.  That was sad, and unfortunately I was too much in a rush to go back and have it fixed.  So yeah, that was one mishap, but most of the time I haven't had any problems.\n\nI can't complain too much about this Super Duper location.  The burgers have been solid and satisfying and it's one of the few \"fast food\" spots where you can throw a runny fried egg on your burger.  It's pretty pricey compared to In-N-Out, and way more expensive than Five Guys when you add a bunch of toppings, but you can definitely taste the quality of the ingredients which are pretty good.

I think $1.50 more for EACH special item.\n\nOnly reason why I knocked off half a star (remember, this is technically a 4 1/2 star rating) was because the burgers were dripping in grease.

This is my first review after my conversion to wimpy, communistic, patchouli-smelling vegan.\n\nQuick note for meat eaters: I highly, highly recommend ordering your next Super Duper burger with one meat patty, one veggie patty. This approach halves the aggressive quantity of saturated fat, solves the \"grease\" problem that many reviews complain about, and adds a bunch of rich flavors that are missing from the standard, hamburger.\n\nOk, on to the vegan veggie burger. It's really, really good. The server I spoke to was super cool about guiding me to a vegan version of the burger served on ciabatta bread (the standard buns aren't vegan). She also said, \"you'll want no special sauce, since that contains mayo,\" and she was right. I love it when staff are educated and joyfully accommodate special requests. Major kudos for the super friendly attitude. That alone makes me want to return to this location.\n\nIn case you're wondering, here are the ingredients in the veggie patty, based on internet research: \n\n* Organic cooked brown rice\n* Water\n* Organic corn\n* Organic carrots\n* Organic onions\n* Organic green peppers\n* Organic rolled oats\n* Organic red bell peppers\n* Organic soy protein isolate\n* Organic canola oil\n* Organic high oleic sunflower oil\n* Contains 2% or less of  broccoli, sea salt, carrageenan, organic soy sauce, organic onion powder, konjac flour, organic garlic powder, organic spices\n\nThe ciabatta bun was toasted a nice medium brown, and the seasonings, lettuce, tomato, jalapenos, grilled onions, and other ingredients on the \"everything on it\" sandwich provided me with a filling, savory, handheld treat. I'd have added avocado to kick it up a notch, but they charge extra for that and I was curious how good the \"basic\" veggie burger would taste. \n\nI arrived at lunch hour. This location was hopping, with a big line that moved fast, with on-the-ball cashiers, and plenty of seating, even at rush hour. \n\nFinal note -- I appreciate that Super Duper is trying to offer a \"better burger\" and think that they achieve this goal. If you must have a burger somewhere, this is a great choice. But consider the veggie burger on your next visit, and do cows (and your body) a kindness.", "author": "Vladimir C."}

I want to go back to try the ice cream cone, except I'm not in that part of the city very often.\n\nRevision: I was back in the city by Moscone and stopped in again. I'm bumping my review up to 5 stars. Everything that was good last time was still good (omg the garlic fries) but this time there was just the right amount of bacon and avocado, and the burger was perfectly seasoned. The liner on the tray mentions perfectly toasted bun and I agree, that bun was great. And did I mention beer on tap??", "author": "Bob M."}

We liked this place so darn much, we went there twice in one day, after the day we tried it the first time.  This was our favorite burger in San Francisco based on a number of reasons that I will share with vivid detail.  \n   The atmosphere is nice and the service is fantastic.  The cashiers were very helpful and friendly.  They set up the atmosphere right off the back.  They were very knowledgeable and were willing to make great suggestions.\n   They sell beer.  That's a huge plus for me right off the back.  The interesting thing was that their selection was different at both locations we tried, cool points from me.  \n   I really like small sides and they have a jar of pickles you can pick from, as much as you like.  Thank you for that.  I don't know if that's a SF thing because the other joints we tried nearby did the same thing. \n   Down to the main meal.  The burgers are good, like really good.  It's one of the best decent price burgers I've tried.  Really, they're good.  I don't go to a place several times within 24 hrs unless it had something good to offer. \n   The meat is full of flavor, perfectly cooked, good size, juicy, fresh ingredients, and soft bread.  Good balance.  The fries were also good.  Not too salty, not too skinny or thick.  I'm making this sound like Goldie Locks, but this place provides products that are all quality.  It shows itself in the taste and flavors.  \n  If you're in SF, check it out.  Especially if you're on budget and don't want to cut down on quality.  I'll be coming back to this place for sure.

The homeless man seemed not in his right mind, but the employee started laughing and provoking him. This was extremely upsetting for me.

And after all, it is just a burger joint. In the end, I'm glad I exhausted some calories walking here from the hotel as opposed to getting delivery.   Let me start off and say, the burger was delicious. Moist, juicy, and well seasoned without being salty. I could taste the caramelization on the meat reminiscent of those delicious bits at the bottom of your pan you pick out and eat before forcing yourself to deglaze. Imagine that feeling, but multiply it across a burger. \n\nI also liked that they have just about every burger related topping you can think of, most free, but the few paid toppings are inexpensive ranging from $0.50 to $1.00 extra. They also have an option to get a fried egg on top, which adds a creamy decadence. In the future though, I would probably get the larger burger as opposed to the mini for this option. \n\nThe bread was soft and fresh, but still toothsome. It had that slight yeasty taste of good bread you would find at your local pub. Very appropriate. \n\nThe garlic and cheese fries were a perfect accompaniment, albeit a bit cold by the time I arrived at my hotel. They are quite garlic-y though, so I wouldn't recommend this as a first date spot!\n\nI topped off my meal with a strawberry milkshake which they advertise as fresh strawberries. While this was not false advertising, and granted the shake was delicious, at $5.50 for about 8 ounces of shake with a small dollop of strawberry pur\u00e9e on top (e.g. the fresh strawberries) I thought this was a bit overpriced. Again that's not to discount the fact that this was a great shake. You can add malt for $0.50, which I did. \n\nThe highlight of the meal was the fresh made spicy dill pickles at the condiments counter. Being Korean, I'm almost embarrassed to admit that I walked away with 2 containers of pickles!\n\nAll in all, this could become a real staple for when I'm staying around 3rd and Market.", "author": "Adina P."}

(Don't be fooled by the names they use. The quarter-pound \"mini burger\" is the size of a normal burger, not a tiny slider.) I asked for my burger to be cooked medium-well, with nothing on it except grilled onions. After a lifetime of asking fast food places to desist from covering my burger in \"special sauce\" or pickles or tomatoes, with limited success, it was a pleasant surprise to receive my burger just as I asked for it. It was the juiciest, greasiest burger I have eaten in years, and I mean that in the best possible way. The fries were the thinly-cut fast-food style, and were very tasty and cooked just right - not limp, but not burnt, either.\n\nBut the highlight of the meal was the vanilla soft-serve ice cream cone with chocolate dip. The soft-serve serve was excellent - simultaneously both creamy and light, and not too sweet. The chocolate dip that hardens as you start to eat it reminded me of Carvel soft ice cream in the Bronx (back in the old days).

While browsing on Yelp, all of a sudden I hear Brian exclaim, \"OH YEAH! I'VE BEEN TO SUPER DUPER BURGERS BEFORE!\" \n\nWell, shoot why didn't you tell me about this place sooner... Let's go!\n\nBrian and I came to Super Duper Burgers about 30-45 minutes into the lunch rush hour. There were about 5-7 people in line in front of me waiting in line to grab their hands on to the famous Super Duper Burger while the restaurant was SUPER DUPER filled with people on almost every table. While the line moved rather quickly, I noticed they use organic products to make their meals on the menu. Another thing I realized is that you can spike up the milkshake if you wanted to. (I wonder what kind of alcohol they put in there...) The lady taking my order looked rather stressed out by the chaos what was happening, but I ordered a mini burger combo and substituted the regular fries with their famous garlic fries.\n\nAfter I finished taking my order, I filled up my empty glass with some Dr. Pepper and thankfully found a seat toward one of the corners of the wall. Despite how busy the place was, before I could even catch my breath from the boisterous atmosphere in T-minus 8-10 minutes, my pager buzzed. Well... That was fast for a busy lunch hour rush. I grabbed my metal lunch tray with my burgers and fries and  finally took at bite into the famous burger most Yelpers are hyped up about.\n\nThe burger itself was juicy goodness. I saw the juice from my burger oozing out as I took a bite. The vegetable and sauce ratio on the burger was just enough to enjoy the quality meat. The quality of the bun was another wonderful factor about the burger. It's spongy and soft almost like an In-N-Out burger. On the other hand, the garlic fries were just enough to compliment my mini burger. I liked the cheese garnished on top of the fries and the flavors weren't overwhelmingly salty.\n\nOn a side note, Brian and I had a pretty decent lunch at the Super Duper Burger. Here's a good tip to follow whether you should order a mini or super duper burger: The mini burger has one meat patty and cheese. The Super Duper Burger has two patties and two cheeses. If you're a small girl like me, I'd stick with the mini! On the other hand, I would not mind hopping on the BART again to fetch me some of Super Duper Burgers.", "author": "Aubrey D."}

After so many rave reviews and loud \"You HAVEN'T been to Super Duper??!?!?!\" from all my friends, it was finally time to check this place out! \n\nOn a Saturday around 1:30pm, the line wasn't long but it was pretty busy! We ordered pretty quickly and got our food in less than 10 minutes (they give you a little buzzer thing when your foods ready).\n\nWHAT WE GOT:\n1) Mini Burger (with cheese, super sauce): umm..this is the perfect size burger for someone who gets super full from eating a full-size burger (me, me!). The patty is 4oz, and is a bit smaller than a regular burger, but I swear it somehow looks so much more cute and perfectly portioned! Loved the super sauce with it, cheese nicely melted in the burger, and the patty wasn't overcooked or burnt--it was...perfect. \n2) Garlic fries with super sauce on the side: If you know me, you know l love fries. Garlic fries?? Even better. Super sauce with the garlic fries??? I'm in heaven! I shared this with my sister, which worked out pretty well with how full we got at the end. If you have a bigger appetite, you can get away with getting the fries and burger on your own (kinda like the same portion as in n out)\n\nMy friend got a super burger (2 patties) with a sunny side egg and some fries and he was pretty satisfied and full by the end as well.\n\nTo note: They have pickles on the side that you can scoop out onto little mini trays--they're pretty good if you like pickles! \n\nEveryone compares this place to In n Out--In all honestly, I don't think one is better than the other. I love that In n Out gives the option to make fries well done, buns well toasted etc. etc. but I also love that Super Duper has the \"mini burger,\" several other options, and garlic fries.

The menu is fairly simple to understand. There's the Super Burger (8 oz of beef) or the Mini Burger (4 oz) along with the good ol' Chicken burger. Grilled with all natural Neiman Ranch beef, these Super Duper Burgers are cooked perfectly. The only annoying thing is the extra surcharge you have to pay for cheese.\n\nThe garlic fries here are a real winner too. They are made with fresh garlic and sprinkled with 6 month aged cheddar and I could honestly two orders of these garlic fries if i was starving.

We all accompanied our burger with their garlic fries. \n\nAs what I have remembered from the previous encounter, Super Duper burger is yum-o. That over easy egg just adds character, texture, and flavor to a properly cooked beef. The bread was delicious and the other supporting casts were okay. By the way of appearance, crunch, and taste, their fries were nothing spectacular. However, matched with the mild garlic and aged cheddar and you have a good sidekick with the burger.

I have no doubt that my one bad trip was just an an aberration, but I just had to be sure.  You know, to help with quality control.  Because that's just the kind of guy I am - willing to force myself to eat tasty burgers for the sake of others.  ;)\n\nJust like the other two I've been to, this Super Duper has a great look and feel with a friendly staff to boot.  However, what sets this location apart is their Happy Hour special - free fries with beer or wine between 5:00-7:00pm.  Pretty awesome, even though we were actually here for lunch on a Saturday instead.\n\nFor consistency's sake, I got my usual Super Duper order - a MINI BURGER with Jack Cheese, Bacon, and \"Everything on It\" with a side of GARLIC FRIES.  Other than a splattering of sauce on the outside of the burger, everything was as I had expected.  The patty was deliciously juicy with a great char, the condiments complemented everything well, and the fries were amazing, as usual.  You can't ever go wrong with crispy fries and loads of cheesy, garlic flavor!  Love the aged cheddar they use...\n\nAlthough Super Duper may not be the best burger in SF (the patty needs a little something), they're close, as well as the epitome of a \"solid burger\".  Plus, they're reasonably priced at ~$10 ($6.50 for my burger + add-ons, $3 for the garlic fries), which puts them at the top of the mid-level price point.  Super Burgers go for $2 more, but a Mini Burger is more than enough.  Now I just need to finally update my review of their Marina location and to try their soft serve!

Bet that's never been said, huh?\n\nBefore heading to the SF Giants vs SD Padres game we were in search of food. The closest place with quick service from where we were standing that wasn't fast food was Super Duper Burgers.\n\nWe ordered one mini combo ($8.50) plus an extra mini burger ($4.75) because the order of fries on the trays nearby looked big enough to share so no need for two combos. The mini is a 4oz all natural beef patty with whatever toppings you so desire. There's \"everything on it\" aka lettuce, tomato, red onions, & their super sauce plus at NO ADDITIONAL COST to you there's jalape\u00f1os, grilled onions, & pickles, too. This mini burger just became the best burger, eva.\n\nWhat goes with the best mini burger eva? GARLIC fries, that's what, & they were so good I didn't care how much garlic I consumed because I'm not a vampire. So my breath wasn't refreshing but you know what refreshed me? A soda pop. Saved the beer drinking for the game because why pay $4.50 for a pint here if you can pay double that at a baseball game?! ;-)\n\nThe difference between the mini & the super burger is one extra patty between the buns & of course $2. Don't like beef? They have organic veggie patties, natural free range chicken boob sandwiches, & super salads, too. Don't like soda pop? There's iced tea, fresh lemonade, beer, wine, & organic milk shakes.They'll spike the milk shake for an extra $1.50. Nice SDB; same idea as The Ice Cream Bar.\n\nSDB was an awesome find for us & it's definitely worth checking out if you've never been here either.

I came here thinking I would purchase a fresh lettuce wrap and informed the register multiple times to please remove any sauce from the order due to allergy restrictions. She informed me this was okay. When I was given my order by the woman, I checked only to find more sauce all over the lettuce, so I informed the woman to please exchange my order to no sauce. She proceeded to argue and tell me that there were no sauce, and she even opened it to show me, only to see for herself that she was wrong. She did not apologize for her mistakes and kept insisting to argue, until she realized there was actually sauce in the lettuce even after informing her multiple times. She could have simply been polite and showed curtesy towards the customer purchasing the order, and instead persisted to act rude and obnoxious.

Most of the time I get a combo with fries and a drink, but sometimes I have just gotten the large burger and skipped the fries. \n\nThe milkshakes are absolutely worth trying. You're already getting a calorie-bomb burger... what'a another couple hundred, right? You can add malt for $0.50. Apparently, they will also spike them with booze for an extra $1.50... maybe next time. \n\nWhen they say \"garlic fries,\" they mean it. There is a lot of garlic flavor in these babies. They also top them with cheese, which usually has a hard time melting completely. I think that is unnecessary, but it does make them look prettier. Maybe it's a garnish  :)\n\nThe vegetarian in our group had the veggie burger and said the patty was tasty.

The place smells like garlic - because of their garlic cheese fries - plays great oldies in the background and serves burgers and shakes like most burger joints. The patties are much more on the authentic, home-grilled side, but the buns are dry... And for someone who LOVES juicy burgers, I was a bit disappointed. The price point is appropriate and the service is satisfactory. Just wish there was a bit more culinary creativity demonstrated in the flavor! Overall, Super Duper wasn't super or duper...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-01-01", "description": "Talk among yourselves. Here, let me give you a topic. Super Duper is neither super nor duper. Discuss. This is the third location I've tried of Super Duper Burgers, and I have to admit I was disheartened to see them open at the Metreon, a mere block away from their other location. I expect that kind of commercial maneuver from La Boulange, but it made me think that Super Duper more accurately described their marketing plan rather than their food. The set-up is familiar with the burgers made to order with a complicated division of toppings where some are free but others like avocado or an organic egg are a dollar extra.\n\nI came in after having one too many at Rickhouse and thinking I should eat something before I start staggering home in the SoMa wilderness. I decided to go for the Chicken Sandwich which costs $6.50 if you have the chipotle aioli slathered on the bun but $7 if you go for some melted jack cheese and $8 if you want to add bacon strips. See what I mean by 'complicated'? Anyway, even if I would have had trouble walking a straight line, I was still sober enough to know if I asked for cheese, it would cost me $7. Fries. I needed French fries. Now that gets complicated, too. For an extra 75 cents, you can get minced garlic and aged cheddar sprinkled on top.\n\nNow for another dollar, you can get three dipping sauces including the aioli which came free with the chicken sandwich. Still with me? I just wanted fries, and I figure I could squirt my own ketchup into the little plastic cup. The sandwich is really not that much different than what you would find at McDonald's except the focaccia bun made  it a cut above, even if the combination of fresh tomatoes and super sauce (whatever that is) makes it hard to manage (see photo). The fries, on the other hand, were as arid as an anorexic camel in the Gobi (see photo). There was never enough ketchup to moisten those spuds up. Marginally disappointed, I left feeling full but unsatisfied and still a little too drunk to care.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...probably would have marked it down if I was sober\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...more spacious than the other places but still felt crowded\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...automatic pilot\nTOTAL - 3 stars...neither super nor duper", "author": "Ed U."}

When it comes to new burger places in San Francisco, I am usually there within a week. Maybe I am getting old and haven't been following what is going on.\n\nThe fourth location is much busier than the other locations including nearby the Market and 3rd Street location. This location also has the upper-level seating. \n\nOn my debut of the fourth location came after spending three hours at the auto show on the other side of the Metreon (Howard Street). I got down and dirty and ordered the Super Duper Double Cheese Burger. For $6.75, the sandwich has two greasy patties, melted cheese, lettuce, tomato and onions on a sesame bun. For an additional $1.00, I also got a soft boiled egg in my burger. I also got a side of fries for $2.75. Also a pair of cute blondes were passing out coupons for a free fountain drink with your meal to hungry pups like Joe Cool. When it comes to burgers, especially Super Duper, I usually drink beer. But the free soda was good enough. (That coupon is valid at this location only).\n\nThe hefty sandwich was greasy and dripping down my sleeve (in a good way). And that greasy burger was yummy and satisfying.\n\nMy only question is: \"Why did I wait this long to dine at the Metreon's Super Duper?\"", "author": "Matt G."}

I had heard of Super Duper Burgers before, but never had the chance to try it out. \n\nThe interior of this burger joint gave me a slight resemblance to Chipotle. The industrial-looking walls and decor, the divider that splits the line and the tables, etc. Of course, this place is nothing like Chipotle. There are only a couple of signature foods on the menu, which is fine by me! \n\nWhen I went up to order, I was originally going to the order the Chicken Sandwich. However, after chatting with the cashier and telling him that it was my first time, he recommended and I decided on the Mini Burger. But seriously. My cashier was so nice and so easy to talk to, and he really seemed to enjoy his job. Thank you for making me a happy customer and saving my lemonade from spilling! :) \n\nNow, about the food. The burger was REAAALLY good. I usually am not able to completely finish a burger, but I scarfed this burger down because it was so good without being too greasy or heavy. The Super Sauce is a beautiful oxymoron of a subtle yet flavorful taste. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the burger and would recommend getting it!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-11", "description": "Joining the likes of The Counter and Pearl's, Super Duper occupies this little niche between fast-food burger joints and restaurants that serve up quality burgers. While they don't offer as many options as the other two, what they do, they do very well.\n\nThe process is simple enough: pick your patty size, select your toppings (from a list of free basic topics, to premium ones like bacon, egg, and avocado that run about a buck each), grab a seat, and wait about 10 minutes for your buzzer to light up. Then proceed to bite into a deliciously juicy and flavorful burger, sandwiched between two lightly toasted and airy buns. If you order the way I do (double patty with everything, bacon, and egg), you'll probably be relegated to eating with the flimsy (compostable!) knife and fork they provide you.\n\nAre there better/fancier burgers out there? Sure, the now-closed Thermidor was a great example. But, for the quality fast-food burger niche that Super Duper fills, they do a damned good job.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Considering this is a new restaurant in the Metreon complex, it should be no surprise that there aren't really any accessibility issues. While half the restaurant is bar seating, they do have a handful of standard tables, as well as lower bar counters that you can just roll into.\n\nBathroom - Didn't check them out, so I can't comment, but I don't imagine that they'd pose any issues.", "author": "Johnny W."}

This place was really good. I was surprised how many people were there at this time ordering food. I ordered the mini combo with a bacon cheeseburger and garlic fries. It took about 15 minutes to get it but we grabbed a table upstairs and ate our food. The burger was so good. It was cooked to a good medium well and it was delicious. It was also really filling considering it was the \"mini\" burger. I believe the bigger burger is two of the mini-patties. The fries on the other hand were a little much for me. They were good but I think I would've been okay with the normal fries. They put a ton of cheese on top to the point that it was too much. Some people probably like it this way, but it's just not my preference. Would've been better if it was melted or something instead of hard cheese. They also make their own mayo here as well and it tasted good. I really loved the ambiance of this place. It's a very hip burger joint with a cute theme through their store and food.

I got the mini cheeseburger (with fries) which is the perfect size! I took it upstairs, took a bite and was sad to think that it was just okay. I don't know if if it's because I don't get any condiments on my burger (I usually don't) so the burger was kind of bland. I always think that if it's a really good burger though, it doesn't need much because the patty will carry the taste.

No meat in the garlic fries so you better believe I didn't miss out an opportunity to try them.\n\n\nThe cashier was very nice and their service is quick. They handed me a buzzer and I only waited about 5 minutes to get my order. I only had enough time to pick a place to sit and take a peak at what others ordered. A burger joint is so hard to come to when you can't eat meat, I definitely can't wait to come back and try a REAL burger. \n\nAnywho! The veggie burger was great! Perfectly cooked fresh veggie pattie with all the toppings as well as avocado and jack cheese between what a bun should be -- an equal number of soft and firm. This was so filling, but not too much that I felt overstuffed.\n\nThis was a great pair with the highly talked about garlic fries. If only there were a way to capture scent... Man! I wish you guys could smell these things and I mean that in a good way. The fries come with FRESH not powdered garlic like some places and topped with cheese.  And again, THE SMELL!!!! mmmmmmm ... So good... It's definitely too much for me, if your out with someone it would be good enough to share between two people. But maybe that's just my opinion. \n\nOh and I also gave up soda for lent-- they have a delicious lemonade with brown sugar. \n\nPrice wise... Yeah, they are a little pricey I ended up paying a little over $14 for my veggie burger, garlic fries and drink, but I don't mind paying for good food.\n\n\nTo sum it up: \n\nVeggie Burger: Super\nGarlic Fries: Duper\nLemonade: Delightful\n\nThank you for a great Sunday night dinner (:", "author": "Clare C."}

Their patties cooked a little bit on the rare side of medium to come out with a delicious burger.

I was taken a back at first when he asked if I wanted my milkshake spiked!\n\n- Their fries are good, their garlic fries are better!\n\n- Free pickles. If you want to try to take this to go, ask for a foil wrap (it's what they put the burger or fries in). They have trays by the pickle stand, fill one or two up with pickles, then stick them in a foil wrap, then wrap it shut and put it in your to go bag.\n\n- Super friendly staff!

Because the tables and chairs were a metal color, it made the place feel cold and unwelcoming. \n\nHowever, I like that pickles had their own little self serving station next to the ketchup station. \n\nI'll probably be coming back in a few months just to give it another go. \n\nOh, their garlic fries were good :D", "author": "Fanny W."}

This location is next to the city Target at the Meteron, and couple that with traffic for ages on weekends and I have am 8-6 on Monday to Fridays. I don't get many opportunities to go.\n\nRegardless after what felt like all of eternity of people taunting me with their Super Duper Burger pictures of their burger and garlic fries, I was granted the wonderful opportunity to attend this establishment. \n\nAnd I still wonder why I waited so long. \n\nOrdering is simple, it's a burger (2 patties) or a mini burger (1 patties), cheese and bacon is extra, so is a few other items like the sunny side egg and avocado for example. There are fries, garlic fries, drinks (yes they have beer), and dessert.\n\nI wasn't aware of this but they give you an actual glass cup for the soda orders, what fast(er) food restaurant does that? The cashiers are I guess okay, but who am I kidding? I'm here for the food, plain as day. Or night when I came because there was free parking and I'm too cheap to park at the garage.\n\nThe burger, the fries, wait a picture first, smelled scrumptious. That first bite, you definitely know this is a burger you can't find at your local burger joint, its here and its pretty god dam affordable. The juiciness, the crispiness of the bacon, how the buns ever so complimented and put together the burger so well, it made me so happy. \n\nDid you notice that the bottom of the bun also had sesame seeds on it?\n\nI asked my friends what they thought and they enjoyed it, which to my liking is a good thing. For some reason every time I try to bring friends to a restaurant that I like or never tried, it turns out as a disaster. \n\nNot here.\n\nThem garlic fries though. Thoroughly seasoned with a potent garlic and aged cheddar smell that will blow you away. And its not just for looks and smell, it tastes, oh so amazing. \n\nThat chocolate dipped soft serve ice cream though? Yes mine had a hole and the soft serve was oozing out in the photo, but it was pretty good. Not exactly worth 4 dollars but you gotta try it one day right? \n\nRegardless even if it isn't worth 4 dollars, it completed the meal very well.\n\nToo long didn't read? Don't hesitate to come.

I don't eat beef so, as a rule, I tend not to get excited about burger places. BUT when it's dinner time, you're staying in/around SOMA and you don't want to spend a lot of cash, a burger will get it done.\n\nBut not just any burger. This burger needs to be super duper... and vegetarian. As my colleague Elsa M has already pointed out, veggie burgers tend to vacillate between dry as sawdust and 'what is this supposed to be?' Not so at Super Duper. I suppose I shouldn't have been so surprised that San Franciscans have managed to perfect the veggie burger. With a locally-sourced organic patty (I'm trusting you, behind-the-counter guy) as the base, adding hummus, cucumber, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and onion to just about anything would be a combo made of win. Top it with a whole grain bun and we're in business.\n\nBut why stop there? There's garlic cheesfries to order! Now, don't expect rivers of bright yellow goo on top of your spuds. No. Expect freshly cut po-ta-toes (boil 'em, mash 'em, stick 'em in a stew) adorned with herbs, garlic and freshly grated cheese. It's not the Monsanto'ed comfort of your youth, but the grown-up you should appreciate them nevertheless. At this location, there's also two floors, an industrial feel and beer. All of these items add to the burger-for-dinner experience nicely. Knowing, however, that I had much boozing in my future, I opted for a strawberry milkshake. It was delectable. Thick, creamy and packed with berries, this shake was worth the (small) wait. Order one. If you can't shake the alcoholism shakes, you can order it spiked... but don't be that person.

The meat is soooo tender and juicy and just tastes super delicious with the bread and cheese. My mouth is watery just thinking about it.\n2) Garlic fries!! You must get the fries. They are so crispy and oily and the garlic and cheese topped off of it makes it one of the best garlic fries I have had.

SD has this ability to produce that feeling of \"OMFG this is good. I want more but I don't know why; here is my money. I walked uphill for 16 blocks to get here.\" We had this place the first day we got to SF and I couldn't stop thinking about it. For crying out loud, I'm in LA right now and I still think about it. In SF, I recall any shortcomings in our itinerary were easily dismissed so long that I knew Super Duper would be there at the end of the day.\n\nSuper burger double patties + cheese + bacon (none of that punk b!tch sh!t) w/ everything on it) is absolute MAGIC the way the juice (and probably grease) explode into the cavity of your mouth. It just drips everywhere and is a mess for those without dexterity. Don't be an idiot like me and forget the free option of adding grilled onions, jalapenos, pickles. I've seen numerous people top their glorious creations with a fried egg. Don't be a moron like me and forget to add that too with the assumption that I'd be back in a couple of hours to redeem myself...only to find that the workers had a life too and the facility would be closed. I now sit in LA full of regrets and a stupid place called in-n-out. \n\nGarlic fries with three dipping sauces is a crown jewel here and must be taken seriously here.  I love the 'texture' of their fries; its a mix of crispy, soggy, and crispy-soggy (rare - savor these ones). You know they mean business when your breath is kickin' for the remainder of the day.

The avocado added a nice touch to the sandwich, although I couldn't taste it very well in the mix of all the other flavors: the onions and tomatoes really added a nice punch and were not those flavorless tomatoes, onions that one could get in some other places.\n\nOne of my coworkers had an incredible milkshake that I had the honor of trying. It was as spectacular and numbingly-food-coma inducing delightful as a milkshake could be. Their garlic fries were also some of the best I've ever had too. Why? Well, the fries were crispy to a point where eating them was savory and the garlic flavor was soaked into the fries.\n\nThe ambiance is nice as well.

Although it wasn't my favorite (Fish & Farm), this was still a solid burger. We ordered:\n\n-Mini Burger ($4.75) + Cheese ($0.50) + Egg ($1.50) + Avocado ($1.00) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-duper-burger-san-francisco?select=_3R-5w4FljV7Or6WB0XgQQ#lGZ9rvJAGDftWLqi5Yfi7w): I liked that the grilled onion and jalapeno were complimentary to add to the burger. My burger was cooked a perfect medium, but still had a nice sear on the outside. It wasn't as big as I was expecting, and I wish I asked for additional sauce on the side, but it was still good. However, don't think I would add egg the next time around since it made it really messy to eat. \n-Garlic Fries (Fresh Garlic & 6 Month Aged Cheddar, $2.75, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-duper-burger-san-francisco?select=_3R-5w4FljV7Or6WB0XgQQ#d4vV1xxfSNKQeJjcIKAm6A): Pretty good! The fries were nice and crispy, and there was the perfect amount of garlic.  \n-Double Chocolate & Chips Super Shake ($5.75, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-duper-burger-san-francisco?select=_3R-5w4FljV7Or6WB0XgQQ#_3R-5w4FljV7Or6WB0XgQQ): This shake was good, especially since it was made with Straus Organic Soft Serve. However, I couldn't take the chips, and it was on the pricey side for the amount of milk shake you get.\n-Complimentary House Pickles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/super-duper-burger-san-francisco?select=_3R-5w4FljV7Or6WB0XgQQ#4LPX_4q-RRlHGkIJOuaeWg): Good but not amazing. However, the pickles went really well when eaten with the burger.\n\nService was quick and efficient, and we got our burgers in less than 10 minutes. However, the restaurant wasn't very crowded so I'm not sure how long the food takes when its busy. The only annoying thing was I had to keep repeating my order to the cashier since it didn't seem like she was paying attention. Parking for this location is also tough, so you'll either have to pay to park in the garage (only a block away), or you'll have to walk a few blocks if you want to look for street parking.", "author": "Amy D."}

(Thanks, boyfriend!) If you're looking for a burger that's a little more gourmet than \"just a fast food burger,\" you've got Super Duper. In fact, I'd even venture on to saying that Super Duper could be a gourmet burger chain with the right prices and fast casual slingin'. I'd equate it to Smashburger, for those who haven't heard of it. Both are equally delicious and both make me feel like I'm going to have a heart attack after. I can feel my arteries clogging when I eat a Super Duper burger. (Not that that's quite a bad thing-- you're definitely satisfied.)\n\nI believe most times I ask my boyfriend to pick up food from here, I get the Super burger with cheese, bacon, grilled onions and pickles. (What can I say? I like to keep my burger greasy?) The doneness of Super Duper's burgers are perfect. They're a perfect medium- thick, juicy and delicious. The garlic fries with all the dips are amazing, though I wish they offered different sizes of fries. And also, because I get them take out-- I wish they held up better for the wear and tear of a five minute walk because they were a little soggy by the time they got to me. (No matter, I still ate 'em up like there was no tomorrow!) The cookies and cream malt was thick and delicious, and by the time it got to me it was still thick and delicious.

My colleague wanted a burger, so I hopped on that train and pulled out my trusty Yelp app. Super Duper Burgers immediately jumped out, since it was a) only a few blocks away and b) 4 stars. Booya! Done and done.\n\nSure, it may seem like your typical sterile order-at-the-counter burger joint, but they also serve wine and beer (score!) AND the veggie burger is not your average burger. You order and pay, get a buzzer, stake your claim at a table, and return to the counter to fetch your food once that buzzer buzzes. Simple. Easy. Quick. \n\nWhy's the veggie burger so delish? It's thick, flavorful and filling. Not too dry, not too boring (actually, not boring in the least) and topped with your choice of add-ons. I went with ketchup, mustard, cucumbers, jack cheese and avocado. I think it's usually served with hummus, but I opted to forgo the chickpeas in favor of my all-American condiments. I also indulged in some of the free pickles (offered at the condiment stand) and they were crispy and just what the burger doctor ordered.\n\nThree of us also split an order of fries and we totally housed them.

Finally got to try it a few weeks ago when I decided to meet my aunt for lunch.  The only thing I don't like about Super Duper is the seating.  The two-seater tables are too close to each other and everything else seems communal style.  But their burgers are delish...if you're like me & can get stuffed easily..get the mini (1 patty, 4 oz).   I liked how you can choose which toppings you want...especially the free grilled onions!  I added cheese on mine ($4.50+.50), and got my aunt a mini burger ($4.50), and we shared an order of regular fries ($2)  all for about $12..not too bad.  Super Duper is considered fast food, but wayy better quality, kinda like In-N-Out.  Our buzzer went off in about 5-7 minutes.  Our burgers were juicy & messy.  I liked the super sauce that comes in the burger.  It's a little like animal style sauce at In-N-Out, but not super rich like it and minus the chopped up pickles.  The fries were plentiful, hot & crispy & seasoned with the right amount of salt.  A few weeks prior I had some of the bf's leftover garlic fries from this Super Duper.  They were so good with lots of garlic & cheese.  However, there was so much garlic that the fries actually tasted spicy...garlic burn?  I'd get the garlic fries again if they toned down on the garlic!\n\nAll in all, Super Duper is a great choice for an affordable lunch when you're shopping at nearby Westfield.

I tend to get it with everything on it (lettuce, tomato, red onions) along with jalape\u00f1os, grilled onions, and roasted portobello mushrooms ($1 extra).\n\nThe chicken sandwich is probably one of the best I've had. The chicken breast is moist and tender with a nice grilled taste to it and the chipotle aioli is great.\n\nAs for the other stuff, the fries (and garlic fries) are delicious, but their overpriced sauces are not worth it.

Ordering my burger was a little confusing because the menu seems to imply that it only comes with hummus and cucumber. Turns out it comes with that plus lettuce, tomato, onion and super sauce too. The burger was fine; it held together nicely and you could tell there were actual vegetables in it, but overall it didn't wow me. The fries were a different story.\n\nSlathered in garlic with shredded aged white cheddar over the top, the fries were amazing. I intended to have one or two before digging into my burger, but before I knew it I was licking my fingers with gusto while staring at an empty plate where my fries once lay. Personally, I don't think there's a need for any of the dipping sauces; these are pretty fan-f*cking-tastic on their own.\n\nIf I lived in the area, this would be my go to place for fries and a veggie burger every now and again.", "author": "Mary T."}

Absolutely great if you like burgers. The fries are good also. I have always loved chocolate malt shakes and have been a bit disappointed with the selection of chocolate malt shakes in the Bay Area.\n\nMost places make their milkshakes too sweet or skimp on the malt. Super Duper just served me my favorite malted shake in the Bay Area! Seriously. I cannot express just how delicious it was! The chocolate ice cream was dark, thick, and not too sweet. The malt powder was, well, malty. But it also introduced a textural element to the beverage. While sipping the shake, I occasionally discovered flecks of the malt powder that provided a very nice counterpoint to the smooth velvety texture of the ice cream. Simply put, try their chocolate malt milkshake!", "author": "M T."}

Oh my goodness. These fries. Oh my. So much goodness. These garlic fries are even better than the ones I had at the garlic festival, mainly because a plethora of sweaty drunkards and too-hot weather weren't involved. The other positive point to these fries is that they are covered in cheese, which makes it even more delicious. And there is garlic in every wonderful, beautiful bite. I mean, the fries were more of a highlight than the burger to me, and the burgers were pretty damn fantastic on their own.\n\nThe \"mini\" burgers are where it's at, starting at $5 for a quarter-pound of awesome. A super burger is this plus one more quarter-pound patty for $7. A mini was perfect for me, and they're cooked to a nice medium (I'd prefer them medium-rare, but this was still pretty tasty). You can add stuff to your burger according to their menu, and even if you add stuff, it's still probably going to come out to be cheaper than Roam (and definitely Umami).\n\nIf it matters, everything here is organic. You can even bring your veggie friends here, since they also make veggie burgers, which are apparently also quite delightful. They've got some housemade pickles (things I don't like, but the boyfriend says they are really excellent), and their ice creams and shakes are made with Strauss, which is one of the most legit still-in-a-glass-bottle milks you can find at places like Whole Foods. The shakes are basically levels of deliciousness that aren't even fair, and are thick, creamy, and still drinkable through a compostable straw.\n\nAnyway, in terms of food, everything was delicious and of excellent quality. The burgers are a solid choice in the world of sandwiches with beef patties in between them; they are infinitely better than In-n-Out, in my opinion. But don't go expecting something that can compete with Roam and Umami. Roam beats SD out in terms of the dozens of things you can add to their burgers; Umami is king when it comes to burgers being made exquisitely. Super Duper is good when you don't want to seem overly-accidentally uppity, but still want to be the bearer of good food times. Plus, their fries are the best out of these three, anyway. I'm not overly fond of Roam's, and if I'm at Umami, I get their cheesy tots, so there you go.\n\nTo summarize, Super Duper is, in fact, super duper. Now that I know it's just about two blocks away from work, I know that I'll be going here for my burger cravings. Or, to be more accurate, my garlic fry cravings.", "author": "Robbin A."}

I find this one to be a little better than the one that's one block over on Market. Pretty sure they give hugs and kisses to their ingredients and piece them together with love. Their patties are juicier and have more taste, and it's usually not as busy. I would recommend coming at an odd time outside of the lunch/dinner rush because I always feel that they get a little bit sloppy when it's busy. Understandable, of course, but still.

My friend ordered a veggie burger and garlic fries, which came out to around $10.\n\nOverall, the burger was \"okay\". I would've preferred crisper bacon, although the burger patty was incredible.

I showed up at about 1:30 pm.  The dining area was packed.  There were 5 people behind the counter and 4 people in the kitchen.  Pickles in jars on the condiment stand, mustard and ketchup with cups that sealed to go.  This was good. \n\nI ordered a Super Duper Burger, medium, with cheese and bacon to go, and that's what I got.  This might have been a 1/2-lb. burger, for $9.62 + tip.  It was huge.  And juicy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-12-16", "description": "When I first experienced Super Duper I was pretty happy, but over time I've come to lose enthusiasm for this place and all of the new breed of burger places that aim to replace fast food burger joints. These places are hella expensive if you compare them to McDonald's, but yeah we get it. It's a better burger. However, today after paying $28 for two burgers and one order of fries (and two requested water glasses that never materialized), I kind of came to the conclusion that I may be done with this business model. It's just not worth it. \n\nI think there are three things that these places have to do, and they have to do them all well each time you visit or the experience completely falls apart: food quality, customer service, and unique offerings. The quality is always pretty good here. Organic and everything. Service sometimes isn't, but usually it is. They have a solid cooking line, but it's still pretty crazy in there and mistakes can happen. Today, I went there and the gratis pickles were gone. A unique offering. Everyone asked, \"Where are the pickles?\" And the poor girl whose job it was to tell everyone said again and again, \"The pickles taste like cucumbers because they're not done yet.\" Just tell everyone you ran out of pickles, and for god sakes pull those giant display jars of pickles down and put up a sign so every single person won't ask you about pickles until you want to quit this job. The pickles are the one thing I truly come here for, and I eat a lot of those delicious pickles. Frankly, I'd rather just buy a jar of the pickles and skip the burger. I know not everyone likes pickles, but it's an important unique offering. Just like their chicken sandwich for non-beef eaters (pretty tasty) and their salad for vegetarians and vegans (I assume it's good but haven't had it), the pickles are pretty important. Did I mention that I like pickles? I do. And these guys make really, really good pickles. Just typing out these words conjures up a Proustian moment in my mind. Only my madeleine is a pickle. With a lot of garlic and spice.  \n\nA lot of chain restaurants have one or two gratis or unique things that make you smile. Remember La Boulange? It was great because they had all those cornichons (a pickle!) and jams and fancy spreads you could put on your bread and stuff. Chipotle has familiar hot sauces in bottles. And lemons. Taco Bell has a big grab bag of hot sauce packets and they don't give a !@#$ how many you take home. Five Guys = free peanuts. In N Out? Secret menu. From high-brow to low-down, all of the truly successful chains have experiential details that make them loved by their fans. But inevitably all of these new burger places have to scale, which means they have to slowly cut back on gratis stuff and unique offerings until you're begging them for a packet of ketchup at the counter after they've pushed you onto the exit ramp. Le sigh.  \n\nIn short: Where are the !@#$-ing pickles, bro?", "author": "Casey C."}

To me, fast food is lazy/convenient food, so if it's not on my way, I typically won't get it. However, after getting home from a weekend trip and realizing I didn't have much food in the fridge, I decided it was the perfect opportunity to try this place.\n\nService: At about 8:15pm on a Sunday night, there was a pretty good crowd inside and a slight line at the register. I didn't have to wait more than a few minutes before ordering. After I placed my order, I waited probably about 5 minutes or less and my food was all ready to go!\n\nFood: I ordered a mini burger with bacon (if you're going to do it, go all out, right?) and garlic fries (when there's the option, regular fries never cut it). I'll admit, in an IN 'N OUT vs. Five Guys burger rally, I'd be rooting for team IN 'N OUT. So, there should be no surprise when I compared this burger to IN 'N OUT with each bite. The bun was solid. It was soft and held it's own when faced with potential sogginess from the juicy burger and special sauce. Heck, it even had sesame seeds. The lettuce was also good -- nice and fresh. I ordered my burger with everything, including jalape\u00f1o peppers, grilled onions, and pickles. They offer everything, but they're not very generous with their toppings. I think I only got one bite of each throughout my burger. The super sauce is okay. It adds a little something to the burger, but it isn't overbearing. The burger itself was juicy and you could taste the quality of the meat. The mini 4 oz burger was perfect for me, leaving me enough room for my garlic fries, but also still satisfied with my burger experience. The garlic fries were also topped with aged cheddar. Typically the addition of garlic adds some oil to the fries, so it made them slightly more soggy, especially towards the end. However, they were pretty good. There wasn't much of a garlic flavor to them (but I might be spoiled by the ones at AT&T Park). A good dip in the ketchup and I was a happy camper.\n\nRestaurant: There's plenty of seating around (upstairs and downstairs). The line moves efficiently. There's a self serve soda fountain, pumps for your ketchup and mustard, plastic to-go containers, and tiny troughs for those taking the dip to eat-in.\n\nCost: My order came out to be $9.75(?) Definitely on the pricey side, but I think I paid near that for an IN 'N OUT single burger and Animal Style fries. \n\nI might come back, but there's more burger places in the city I still need to try!", "author": "Leana L."}

Not this place! You want it rare to medium rare you can get it that way. Nice and juicy! It isn't a fancy place but it is a reasonably priced meal that is hard to find in this town.

The sauce and egg are add-ons with a cost of something like $.50 and $1.50, but they're definitely worth if if you enjoy mouthwatering sauce with a kick that will return to you in your dreams and prematurely murdered spawn of chicken. Just kidding, I'm sorry for saying that. But seriously, the combination is just amazing, and if you're into chicken sandwiches, get it.\n\nTheir garlic fries are also to die for. I typically get a cookies 'n cream milkshake on the side too, but their double chocolate and chocolate strawberry flavors are great as well. My sister likes getting the ice cream cone dipped in chocolate, which is pretty standard.\n\nOne note - be prepared to walk out of there with a major food baby and a complete lack of desire to move or consume anything else in the near future.

It's semi-sweet and thick and creamy without being overbearing\n\nGarlic Fries: I know everyone seems to love this order here but I simply wasn't impressed. The fries were very average - the ones towards the top were fluffy and crisp but as I worked my way towards the bottom, they became soggy and completely soaked with garlic. I almost couldn't taste the potatoes anymore. \n\nMini Burger with Egg, Cheese and the basic stuff: Good but not great. The burger was  indeed juicy but it lacked the unique flavor that I'm used to experiencing at other burger joints. I think it's definitely a notch below the burgers from Barney's or the Counter. \n\nSo although I enjoyed my shake, I was left a bit indifferent to the garlic fries and mini burger. I probably won't come back unless I was at the Metreon for a movie and had an intense craving for burgers. It's located right next to the movie theater.", "author": "Priya S."}

The burgers here are amazing, cooked medium and to your liking with a plethora of fixin' choices. And you must grab some of their homemade pickles from the condiment bar. My burger was so good that once I touched it, I couldn't put it down to take a photo (it's like realizing you locked your keys in the car right after slamming the door) I did take a picture of the garlic fries, which were equally, insanely good. My only beef (no pun intended) with this joint is what they charge for their super duper ice cream cone. $4.00 for a hand dipped cone. yeah, I understand the whole 'milk from organic cows' cost more, but we live in California and 'Happy Cows come from California' , so use milk from happy cows and charge less for your dang ice cream cones =)", "author": "Mike L."}

They've only got a few selections but they are GREAT selections-- Scrimshaw Pilsner, Racer 5 IPA, Great White, and Lagunitas, I believe. Hit me!\n\nThere is the occasional bum. However unlike any other establishment I've been in, they tend to get the winners. These are some of the most aggressive, most out-of-it homeless people I have ever seen.

Super Duper Burger is a high quality fast food burger (think In-N-Out) with an above average fast-food price (think 5 Guys). The restaurant itself has a very casual environment which reminds me very much of how Chipotle restaurants look and feel.\n\nThe Food:\nSuper Duper Burger (double) with Cheese, bacon, and egg - If you're going to ruin your diet you might as well do it right. When this burger comes out it looks like the burgers you see in commercials, all fat and perfect. The egg is an element all burger places should really utilize as it adds such a nice balance to the burger. The meat is juicy and the cheese gooey but make sure to grab a lot of napkins as this thing drips with oil and can get very messy.\n\nGarlic Fries - The garlic fries are DE-LI-CIOUS and never soggy. If you're a garlic lover definitely give these fries a try. My one concern would be that there are just too little fries, especially for what you pay. I always find that my fries are gone before I'm more than 1/2 way done with my burger.\n\nI still think In-N-Out has the better burger, never the less Super Duper Burger is packed with flavor and is sure to leave any hungry burger patron satisfied.", "author": "Eddie K."}

Yeah, yeah, they serve burgers here and they're great. But can we focus for a minute? Please?\n\nAnyone with half a brain knows that the only ice cream worth eating is soft-serve, and the stuff at Super Duper is super duper. It's made from 100% organic cow-juice from the Straus Dairy in Petaluma. The family-owned creamery has four out of five cows from the Cornucopia institute. I really don't know what this means, but it sounds like they know from udders. Four cows!\n\nI had a cookies 'n' creme milkshake here and it was one of the greatest things I have ever put in my mouth, and I'm from Canada. (I don't really know what this means.)\n\nThe swirled cones are fun to make mouth-love to too, ESPECIALLY if you get that sucker chocolate dipped. The dipping chocolate is dark (i.e., not overly sweet), which is is just how I like it. And at the risk of sounding like a pederast, I can attest that the Kiddie-sized cone is sufficient for my tastes.

Not bad at all! Verdict - fulfilling, ridiculously messy and juiiiiiiiiiicccccccy burger meat [we're talking like 7 napkins messy], delicious and definitely did not taste like most fast food burgers at all. \n\nThey also have a lot of variety: salads, chicken, veggie burger (veggie patti, cucumber, hummus), milk shakes, soft serve, beer, so you're set eve if you don't like hamburgers. \n\nSome other perks =  you get a little pager to let you know when your food is ready, and the turn around time I would say is no more than 10 minutes. There's ample seating in the main dining room or upstairs.\n\nSome bummers = in the hustle bustle of the downtown area, don't leave your stuff hanging around.

And it's actually delicious -- and they cook their patties medium!!! BRILLIANT.\n\nFirst of all, SF isn't exactly a place that is known for great burgers, so when I stumbled upon this gem with my boyf, I was stoked.\n\nTried their Super Burger (2 patties, with everything -- lettuce, tomato, red onions, super sauce, jalapenos, grilled onions, and pickles) and the garlic fries.\n\nUMM -- delicious. I would definitely recommend the 2 patty deal, their patties are on the small side but it was definitely filling with two patties. the garlic fries are what I imagine the garlic fries at AT&T Park taste on a sober pallet -- delicious. And it is a little messy to eat, but the mess is worth it.\n\n(I am an onion LOVER, but I'm probably going to pass on the grilled onions next time I come. Only because they are awesome and they give you a lot of grilled onions, but they're sweet flavor is a tad bit strong for my liking on a burger.)\n\nThe girl who took our order was friendly and told the boyf and I about how they're a SF burger spot.\n\nThis location is super cute and two stories.\nWe enjoyed sitting facing the windows and people watching while enjoying our burgers.\n\nOh and...the restrooms are clean.\nOh and they provide freshmade pickles the same way that 5 Guys provides free peanuts.\n\nOverall, I loved everything about this place.", "author": "Riana C."}

Superbly quick service for a rush hour night!\n\nThe burgers are inexpensive and fairly tasty. First timers:  the regular 'super' option is actually two patties, so if you want to minimize your red meat intake or just can't handle two patties, go for the 'mini' option. I ordered only a mini burger for around $5 and it was perfect for my appetite (I usually eat one entire In-N-Out burger at the same appetite level) so the entire deal was a total steal for me. \n\nTasty? Yes. The best burger I've ever had? No. The beef patty is a little too squishy/soft and the secret sauce did not have enough ketchup for my liking. Additionally, the bun was quite oily.

Fries tend to be crispier here, for some reason. \n\nIf you haven't been to Super Duper, here's the scoop: these are very tasty, consistent, above-average quality \"smashed\" fast-food style burgers. \"Smashed\" means they start with a ball of beef and smash it down while grilling, which leads to lots of nooks and crannies in the meat.  I'm personally a fan because it ensures a) never frozen beef, b) cheese gets all up ins, and c) each burger is made to order.  \"Fast food style\" means it's a classic American cheeseburger, nothing fancy or elaborate.\n\nLettuce, cheese, bun, etc. are all above average.

And a cold refreshing pilsner - yes please! And homemade pickles - well OK, twist my arm. This placed kicked ass! There was a long line to order when we came in, but they are quick and efficient with taking/filling orders, and they give you one of those vibrating pager things so you know when your food is ready. It's a good system -  you can enjoy your conversation without having to listen for them to call your name over the clamor of a busy burger joint. \n\nOh, and did I mention Happy Hour? Yes, 50 cent fries during happy hour, and I think we got a deal on the beer too. Our bill was $32 for two tall pilsners, two super-duper burgers (double patties) with added bacon and cheese, and two orders of garlic fries. Sounds like a bargain to me. \n\nThis place is conveniently located off Union Square, so I suspect it is busy at all hours of the day and night, but there still appears to be plenty of seating and quick service. I ordered my burger with EVERYTHING and added bacon, cheese, jalapenos, and grilled onions. It was perfectly spicy, juicy, and delicious when I was SO TOTALLY in the mood for a good burger - HIT THE SPOT!\n\nIf this place was in my East Bay neighborhood, I would go here all the time, but I will definitely hit it again next time I'm in the Union Square area. If you are in the mood for an awesome burger on my side of the bay - try Grazzy Burger and Albany Tap Room - it beats out Super Duper, but only by the slimmest margin...and probably because it's walking distance from my house and once I've walked home from there, I feel slightly less guilty about slamming down more than 1500 calories worth of red meat and beer in a single sitting.\n\nPS - After dinner we did a little post-holiday shopping and then traveled home to watch a movie on HBO. Halfway through the aforementioned movie, the leftover half of my burger mysteriously made its way out of its fancy foil bag and down my gullet. I couldn't help myself.", "author": "Rebecca D."}

To my surprise the line moved really quickly and when I got to the front the cashier was really understanding of the meltdown my one daughter was having in the corner. The manager fixed a mistake on my receipt without any hassle. And when my other daughter spilled her entire lemonade, they were on top of it and not a single eye roll in the house.

YOU'VE BEEN WARNED! \n\nWe came here today for the fifth time and we both had our usual: the \"mini burger\" (a standard single anywhere else) with cheese, saut\u00e9d onions, jalape\u00f1os and bacon. At the urging of our Korean friend Todd, we tried it with a fried egg on top. \n\nMy god! My god! It was the missing ingredient! \n\nEgg on a burger sounds out of place. Hell, it even sounds a little gross. But it's SO NOT! The egg yolk adds a richness and moistness to the burger - it's like yet another sauce on the burger. It was a little messy to eat, but... oh my... so worth the mess. \n\nSomebody back there in the kitchen sold his soul to the devil in exchange for the ability to cook the most ungodly delicious burgers this side of everywhere. They put something in them whereby, once eaten, you will crave it even in your sleep!  If you're near a Super Duper, all other lunch options fade into obscurity. \n\nEvil, I tell ya! EVIL!\n\nThree words: \n\nGET. THE. EGG.\n\n---\n\nBTW - make sure the yolk is runny or it is not nearly as good. Unlike mine, which was perfect, my S.O's egg was well-done and he said it made the burger a little bland. I's a delicate dance of textures and flavors and it doesn't work if the egg yolk is fully cooked. Check the egg right when you get it and make sure to break it right away so it flows over the meat.

It is far better than any burger I've ever attempted to grill myself or had at another restaurant.\n\nI've eaten at a lot of specialty burger joints (i.e. 5 Guys, Backyard Burger, Fuddruckers, etc), but Super Duper Burger caught me totally by surprise.

I was a bit disconcerted by the pink inside the burger, but the signs clearly state that they grind their own meat fresh, so it may be pink (i.e. rare). Frankly, I think having the burger rare is what makes it so good, but I wouldn't trust it from any other burger joint. \n\nI also had the garlic fries. They were good, but I had dragon-breath for hours afterwards. I only discovered later that garlic fries are a San Francisco thing and everybody sells them.

Most of these burger places produce a \"good\" burger, but the prices are a little outrageous. \n\nSDB is a perfect example of this trend.

To compare apples to apples, Phil's Sliders in Berkeley is much more expensive, the burgers are smaller and the service was so-so. Yet I want to go back to Phil's Sliders. That small little burger was amazing and the vanilla shake and tater tots were equal in quality to the burger.

The pickle/condiment bar was fully stocked and there was no giant pile of dishes to be seen. \n\nWe ordered and the gals were friendly and got our orders right.

Not sure if it's fresh-squeezed, but if they told me it was, I would surely believe it. The fries were piping hot and crispy - not very greasy to the touch. The burgers were done medium (perfect!) and juicy. The patty here is always well seasoned and highlights the beefy goodness. The veggies on the burger were nice and fresh, and the jalapenos made me sweat (literally).

Next time I might try actually getting them onto the burger instead of eating a dozen straight up. \n\nThis is one of the few places that has a vegetable patty that I actually really like (I'm more partial to soy patties that have a more meaty texture instead of grains and legumes and corn). \n\nIt's a bit on the pricy side, especially if you get one of the shakes.

It's not too different from the other location down the street, this includes upper-level seating as well.\n\nThis brings me to the part of why my review isn't 5 stars, the seating is sort of limited. There are a lot of seats though, but because of high traffic most of the time, there isn't much room to sit. In addition, the seating is more geared to ______ (okay, I tried remembering the exact name, but let's just say that there are long tables that seats a lot of people) type seating). But ya, if you try sitting in groups, it does get tough to find seats together. The seating arrangement that I awkwardly described above certainly invades private space that most americans certainly aren't used to.\n\nBesides the seating layout, when you get over that, the food is still absolutely good. I was able to buy a Super Duper burger with bacon and everything with a beer. The organic ingredients certainly taste good. Again with my previous review though, the reason for making both of these reviews 4 stars, it is a bit greasy and expensive for what it's worth. The price is leaning towards sit-down restaurant prices, but I can compare this to other \"medium\" priced/quality places that cost a bit less for the same quality.

As usual, service was great and the homemade pickles perfectly complimented my burger. The only thing I was disappointed about was my mini burger. The burger itself \"looked\" so scrumptious but as soon as I took a bite into the burger, it was red. Keep in mind, super duper in no way uses frozen burgers, this is the real deal, grass feed fresh beef. I knew the burger was still good to eat but medium rare burgers are not my preference.

A lot of times, my burger patty will lack flavor or is dry so I'm kind of disappointed in that. I know for sure that there's been at least 3 times where my burger tasted really good, but ive had too many average tasting burgers that I forgot what they tasted like when I actually liked it. I'll order it anyway when I crave red meat.\n\n*Chicken sandwich - awesome! The meat is nicely seasoned and the Chipotle aoli adds that nice kick to it. I frequent the chx sammie. \n\n*Veggie burger - I've never had a veggie burger until Super Duper and I absolutely love theirs!  Whenever I think about ordering a burger, I sometimes will get this instead. With bacon ;)\n\n*Fries/Garlic fries - nothing special but not bad at all. I like the garlic fries though.  Tasty with the parmasan cheese. The serving size is small but it's just enough. \n\n*Super Salad - the first time I ordered it, my impression was that it looked like it would taste like a basic, boring salad, something you get from a cafeteria.  I was wrong. The dressing was amazing, and the cucmbers added a nice, crisp crunch to it! Add chicken, and/or bacon, and/or cheese=even more amazing!!! \n\n*Shakes - love the shakes! They don't make me feel sick afterwards. Also, I tried a spiked chocolate shake and it was sinfully delicious.  If I had no self control, I'd order that every damn day!\n\n*Cones- I've only had it one time when they first opened- vanilla flavored with chocolate coating.

Had it's fair share of seating indoor and out but with the rain drizzling, indoor was the practical option. They definitely emphasized the farm freshness in their ingredients throughout their retro artwork and nostalgic posters thoroughly placed on their walls. But it's it all up to taste.\n\nSo couple friends and I tried it out and ordered a Super Combo. We decided to go with that since after scoping out the place from what others ordered, the Mini Combo wasn't for us. Basically, two guys and a girl, who just had a tiresome day Friday at work in addition to walking to the place. So might as well end the weekday here.\n\nThe burger was definitely juicy and on point. I'd recommend sticking with the burger being cooked to medium if you want that melt-in-your-mouth type of feeling. Didn't add anything extra to it just kept it simple and that's all it needed. The fries were great. Lightly salted and just plain crisp. The only thing I wish I did try was their milkshake. The next time I visit I'm definitely getting a taste of that, what turned me off was the price of it. From what I saw the amount you got for a milkshake was definitely overpriced. Maybe the taste could justify the cost but volume does matter as well.\n\nThe combo was about $10 + tax, which for a fast-food joint is reaching borderline pricey. Perhaps the fact that it's farm fresh was the added bonus, but still it's a reach for something of a fast food burger joint. The spot is worth a try.", "author": "Michael B."}

The burger patties were not over done or over salted and the meat was juicy and flavorful without being greasy. The fries were very good, and I usually dislike french fries. Large portion of fries and they were very hot, which is imperative for good fries. The homemade pickles were a nice addition to the burger, being just sour enough.

The mini burger gets you one patty and the super gets you two patties. You can dress the burgers with various toppings and they offer complimentary house made pickles. But I have had far better burgers elsewhere and would come by only if I was on the go to/from a performance in the area and wanted something fast.

I'm not a snob, I'd just like some semblance of professionalism in a business. A customer also came in with her dog, and was given a water cup for the dog to drink from.

The fare here is classic American, and they execute it perfectly without too many bells and whistles. The burgers are cooked Medium and have the oh, so desirable char-grilled flavor complemented perfectly by fresh juicy toppings. The Garlic Fries are a decadence on all on their own, and one that 100% requires a post-consumption piece of gum to kick the garlic, fire breath. My favorite part just may have been the shake though.
