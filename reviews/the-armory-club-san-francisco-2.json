I came when they had just opened on a Saturday so the place wasn't busy, but there were surprisingly some people there as well.  It was a nice, chill environment with a great bar and good cocktail menu.  Drink prices were pretty reasonable here with very friendly bartenders.  The place has quite a bit of space as well, it felt pretty open.  The decor was really nice, surprisingly not as provocative as I would have guessed, but still very cool.

It's simply a nicely decorated place with a decent menu of cocktails, beer, and wine. Service is friendly and decent. \n\nPerhaps if you were to rent a private room here and put on a kink-themed function, then things would be a bit spicier here.

The rental price was $300 from 9PM-2AM for the entire basement on a Saturday night, which included a private bar/bartender, 2 gender neutral private bathrooms, a dance floor, and DJ booth (DJ not provided, I booked separately). They did not require a beverage minimum (although I'm sure my friends would've more than hit it).\n\nThe staff went out of their way to accommodate early setup to ensure the surprise, created a specialty drink to keep with the party theme, provided a fast and phenomenal bartender (Jason, who is also the owner), and met with my DJ to see what equipment would be provided/needed before the big day.\n\nWe had ~65 guests, and the space was PERFECT. Most guests were on the dance floor/at the bar while some sat at the booth tables or took pictures at the photo booth I brought (area next to the bathrooms). It never felt overly crowded, and provided a great flow.\n\nSeveral guests commented on the affordability of the drinks and the phenomenal staff. It felt great to provide everyone a night that didn't break the bank and was fun for everyone.\n\nHighly, HIGHLY recommend Armory Club for private events of any size!", "author": "Sarah U."}

It doesn't serve food, but it's well worth a visit before or after dinner. And if you're not sure where to go to dinner, just ask the bar staff--they are happy to help. \n\nIt's a few yards from my office, so the first time my wife came to visit me at work, we popped in there--around 6 on a Thursday. The interior is spacious and elegant, like a London gentleman's club, with leather furnishings, brass fixtures, and a faux tin roof. I suppose the artwork, especially the bondage photos (Mapplethorpe?), may not be so typical, but it gives the place a local twist.\n\nIt has an enticingly exotic cocktail menu, a good wine list, and an eclectic selection of draft beers, including some from the neighboring Standard Deviant brewery. It also has a great happy hour. The creative and delicious cocktails are great value at $6 during happy hour, which appeared to still be going strong when we left well after 7. \n\nWhen we told the bartender, Sean, that we were new to the area, he gave us a list of other bars in the area to check out, and pointers on what to look for. I would hope for that from a really good hotel concierge but did not expect it from a bartender. It was good advice and we enjoyed a few of those other bars that very night. But with that kind of service, you can be sure we will be back to the Armory Club.", "author": "Matt A C."}

The decor is absolutely superb here. Leather seats, damask wallpaper, and some beautifully done artwork depicting bondage.\n\nWe came here around 6pm on a Saturday and it was already kind of crowded. The only suggestion I can think of is they should print out more copies of their cocktail menu. We had to wait a minute or two to get one, and I decided to wait because I really wanted to try their house cocktails. I was really happy with the drinks! I was surprised to see that their egg white drink was around $14. I usually pay $12 at other bars, but I think the drinks here are worth the price. The bartenders are competent and the atmosphere of this bar is really rich. Even though the look of this bar is victorian and modern, it still has a laidback feel to it.\n\nThe crowd here isn't what I expected. It honestly looked like a bunch of normal people. The people here actually looked more normal here than they did at the other bars I went to later that night.

It fits on two small pages (say, about 5\" x 7\" or so, with large type and wide kerning), with a big chunk of white space on the second. But there's maybe six dozen beers on the menu, none of which you can't get any number of other places. And the first two beers I tried to order they were out of, and the bartender tried to shove a fucking Karl Strauss at me. \n\nToo bad. They were really good at something, and they abandoned it because they're apparently on a ceaseless quest to be more middle-of-the toad and vanilla and standard.

I liked my zombies and he liked my girlfriend. \n\nI liked this bar, it's actually my favorite bar in SF, because it's neat, classy, with the right decor, excellent wine selection (GOOD French wine), and understated but prompt service. Women here are pretty, sometimes; men, not good looking at all, mostly. It has the potential to be a great bar, something you'd see in New York City, but it lacked a certain charisma. Too many young tech crowd / artist type frequenting this place, it has a younger audience than what makes a bar great. The bar itself though, is way classier than most other popular non-hotel bars.\n\nShortly after the new year, we came here to commiserate our shared misfortune of no one to kiss on NYE. The clock strikes twelve and we are left hanging, alone, different places. Ask why two fairly accomplished individuals with every right to be kissed on NYE and not have such luck? I know why for me, and I got no answer for him. Of course at that precise discouraging moment, the bouncer, who spoke with an Irish accent, looked at us, and said, \"Happy New Year, did you guys have a good NYE?\" We bursted out laughing. \n\nOff we went inside, and promptly ordered drinks. Perhaps not everyone will find love  on NYE, or last year, or this year, but everyone should come here and get a drink. It's delicious. A year and half later since it opened, and since my last review, it's still a gem. So here is to another good year of good alcohol.

A+ for that. Their craft beer and wine selection is plentiful too.\n\nThere is a downstairs space (THE DUNGEON) for events. I came here to watch their FUNgeon Comedy Show, which happens one Friday per month at 9:00pm. It's free (woohoo!) but you have a chance to donate money towards the end of the show.

It's like an amazing guava juice, and you can even taste the texture of the fruit in there - I love that part. As I progressed through the drink, I could taste the rum more and more - but it's good rum and blends smoothly into these fruit flavors. Of course, a friend who likes his strong Bourbons hated this but it was the perfect drink for me. \n\n* Gently Bound - 4 stars\n(City of london dry gin, creme yvette, rhubarb bitters, lemon, sparkling wine. $9)\nA carbonated drink that the rest of us really disliked - it tasted very strongly of maraschino cherry, almost like medicine.

The setup is dimly lit with comfy chairs and couches and the walls are decorated with some interesting artwork that includes LCD TV's that show the various rooms in the Armory Studio. They have a pretty good selection of drinks and several whiskey choices which is a plus in my book. They also offer 'signature' cocktails that seems to be the norm these days in bars.

She never smiled or said thank you. She was very short with us. When I went to let her know that we had drink tokens from the tour she sharply responded with \"I can see that.\"  My friend found a bug in his drink and when he brought it to her attention she didn't say anything. Just grabbed his drink threw it away and made another. Another friend went to the other side of the bar and waited in line rather than deal with this rude bartender. He never got served. While waiting in line. (1 person ahead of him) the person behind my friend pushed his way up to the bar and started talking to that bartender. They seemed very friendly and had a conversation.

There is nothing pornographic in the Armory Club other than a few artistic nods to Kink, a couple paintings of women in bondage and a framed tv screen that shows always empty porn sets (but you wouldn't even know what they were if you just walked in completely ignorant of Kink).\n\nAll in all the Armory Club is, i think, exactly what it sets out to be: a classy (though a little gaudy), darkly and twistedly sexy with a hint of artsy. And the pricy drinks are completely worth it. The cocktails are some of the most creative and tasty I've ever had. \n\nThe Mission is mostly known for its dive bars, that are dingy, dirty, cramped and crowded. The Armory Club is fun, clean, fancy and spacious. The service is great, honestly they really take the time to listen to your order and get it right. I even had a guy walk me to an alternate bathroom that no one knew about and I never even asked, he just started telling people about it. No one will ever mention porn or anything like that, but you'll probably be talking about it which just ends up being a fun conversation starter.\n\nAlso check out the awesome back area if you ever get a chance, there's a smaller bar there, a couple couches and a table with a booth.

And the shenanigans were plenty throughout the night. \n\nCocktails: I ordered the \"Gently Bound\" as my first drink of the evening. It was so amazing that I kept ordering them until I was too drunk to remember the name of the cocktail, so I switched to champagne. \n\nFriday evening here started off slow, but towards the end of the night the place was slammed and a long line formed at the entrance.

AWESOME.\" I wasn't going to set foot in there until I was presenting for an event and the opening ceremony was being held at the Armory Club so I reluctantly dragged myself over there.\n\nI have been pleasantly surprised at how fond I am of this place. It's got a really elegant feel inside that makes me feel comfortable suggesting it to a range of people, from jaded pervs like myself to bright eyed n00bs to my boss. And as a female Top type, the cute male bartenders really work for me, even if they do keep their shirts on and never dance on the bar counters. *coffhintcoff*  \n\nThere's some suggestive images on the walls, but nothing too alarming, just enough for a blush and a stammer. I appreciate that last time I was there I saw a painting of a BBW woman in bondage by one of the bars- something that really pleasantly surprised me, considering Kink doesn't work with plus sized models. Perhaps a hint of a brighter future? The drinks are also slightly risque- though I do sigh a bit at the Donkey Punch/Reverse Donkey Punch... rapey, violent drink names seem out of place in an otherwise sophisticated environment.\n\nI did come here for Halloween, and ended up leaving with my date because I felt there wasn't a lot going on, so I guess the only thing I'd point out is that, for good or ill, don't come here expecting kinky entertainment to be going on.

Now, bourbon is not my thing at all, but I wanted to check out two of the3 specialties, and I must say, it was pretty tasty despite my dislike of bourbon.

It tasted like lychees! \n\nAs for the decor, just imagine how a kinky Hugh Hefner would decorate a Prohibition-era speakeasy. The bartenders are cordial, but expect a wait. They take their cocktails seriously and it will take a while for them to make each drink. The bouncer was nice too. He hailed a cab for us and invited us to come back soon.\n\nVerdict: Go here for some classy drinks with friends and know that you won't feel like you're being rushed out.", "author": "Teresa G."}

I visited for the first time on Saturday night and was blown away by how swanky the place looked.  The ceiling alone could be stared at for hours on end, and the comfy leather chairs make me feel like I should be wearing a satin smoking jacket and discussing fine whiskeys - that's if I drank whiskey.\n\nThe drinks were a little pricey but my \"dark and stormy\" was really delicious and was mixed swiftly.  I hate ordering a drink that takes 15 minutes to make, I don't care how good it is.  The place was pretty full, but didn't feel super crowded.

The music was pretty good and the decor is sexy.  I went another night after happy hour and it was all dudes so that is why I say bring girls with you.

And she tries to serve while her ass is sticking out and in on her fucking tip toes. I came here last night for my friends birthday and I walked in and the it was nice inside. I got there about 1050 and I got to the bar about 11 to order my drink. I was trying to get the girls  attention for 45mins and every time she would help out other people who just got there and didn't bother making eye contact with me. I was beyond mad. No one should wait that long to just get helped or asked what I wanted. We finally order and she is asking more people for drinks. She comes back and says she forgot what we wanted and we have to tell her again. Rude! We waited 45mins to get your attention and then you forget our drink order. She gave me my drink without the cucumber and it's suppose to come with it. She seemed annoyed that I went out of my way and told her I wanted them in there. The girl next to my friend had also been waiting for her drinks and he told her \"hey she also wants drinks\" and she had the nerve to tell him \"I know how to do my job better than you do so don't worry about it\" I'd agree on this if the service was great. The fact that we had to wait that long to get her attention when she was helping people who just walked up and I was in the front of the bar is ridiculous. This place is only getting 1 star because I liked the morning delight drink. To the manager, please review your staff. No one should get terrible service. To top it off she was serving the guys and not the girls. Yes I went there. She wanted to service guys and wasn't paying attention to the girls. I won't ever be coming back there again, unless they change the staff. It had potential for me to come back. But, I didn't even want to go back up for another drink. That girl ruined my night.

That said, dont rush out the door either for awesome thin crust pizza or the widest selection of whiskey. What The Armory Club does provide is a cozy, clean environment, and if I drink much I would have commented on that too...my friends did not seem too disappointed. I on the other hand, was able to appreciate all the fine little details that the owners were keen enough to tend to.", "author": "Vivek N."}

They have pretty good alcohol but no fresh fruit.  Not sure why else the drinks were so bad.  I am comparing them to places like 15 Romolo, Maven and 83 Proof.", "author": "A J."}

Bar was a little understaffed, but there was a private party downstairs and the place was packed. Drinks are nicely mixed, ambience is definitely cool, but yeah, the bathroom locks don't work too well.", "author": "P D."}

The fetish themed pictures on the walls and the SF Armory across the street gives a little dark and mysterious appeal to it.

Go here for great cocktails and good service. Can dress down but don't go too casual, its pretty nice inside. i.e., no sweatpants, you might feel out of place if you care", "author": "Marc M."}

I waited in line and when I got inside I was expecting to find some dark over, loud, crowded place. It was neither of those. The lighting ample enough so that I don't need my phone screen to see the menu(Rickhouse). The decor is simply awesome: classy, seductive, red, upscale and hardwood floors I think. The pictures are graphic but tasteful. The staff was cool and friendly.  Nice crowd. I had a beer so next time I'll be sure to try a mix drink or two. I'll bring my drinking partner here next time he comes down from Sac.", "author": "Marvin O."}

Drinks are decently priced and well prepared.  However I was expecting more than just another touristy bar so it's hard to not be disappointed.  Was not enthused with the music either but could not find the jukebox which would explain such selections.", "author": "Matteo M."}

The BDSM theme is tastefully done and the drinks were delicious, especially the Germain to Boot. Also, had the back room reserved, and everyone commented on how gorgeous it was. Thanks to Kris for squeezing us in!", "author": "Coco L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-24", "description": "Love this place.  Small enough to be intimate, classy enough to impress all your friends.  Hosted a small birthday party here and the planning couldn't have gone any smoother.  Servers were on it, clearing out drinks and keeping us happy.  They didn't even bat an eye when we made everyone wear cheesy party hats.  Like that the windows give the place an open feeling even though it's a small venue instead of dark and cramped like so many other bars.  Good mix of music too, nice enough to groove to.", "author": "Amy S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-25", "description": "I booked the back room for a private party.  The price was reasonable, the room was just the right size for about 40 guests, and the ambiance is terrific.  Everyone who enters immediately looks at least 10% sexier.  Bar manager Kris Ramirez responded to my questions and made things go smoothly.  He permitted me to deliver some supplies (snacks and serving trays) prior to the party, and he permitted me to store stuff at the venue overnight so I didn't have to deal with it until the next day.  He arranged some hors d'oeuvres with his regular caterer, and he arranged someone to handle coat-check (she also monitored the entrance to the room to ensure that only my guests entered).  Our bartender, Mike, did a fine job.  Everyone had a great time.", "author": "Ben C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-02-17", "description": "The bartenders are great, this is no indictment on the workers, but this place is too small to reserve so many areas.  I went tonight  and not only was the back room reserved, but so were all of the couch areas.  With the back room reserved, there is only one bathroom for an overcrowded bar.  It is getting so that you really have to want to be there to be there.  Unfortunately I'm loosing my affinity for the place.", "author": "toby g."}
