I've never been to this specific location, I'm new to the area.\n\nVery busy, but clean.\n\nOrdered medium iced coffee, asked for milk to be added to coffee. Cashier pointed behind me and said I could fill it up myself at the station for customers. I acknowledged the location, repeated the request for milk to be added to my drink, and she said the exact same thing to me and pointed behind me. \n\nI smiled, paid (minus my usual tip) and suddenly noticed the cost of the usual medium iced coffee I order from Peet's. For the first time in over 10 years of being a customer did I actually feel upset by the $3+ cost of my drink. Because when you're not receiving customer service you're accustomed to, then you start to analyze the cost benefit much closer. \n\nI just wanted to get the usual stellar customer service I'm accustomed to when interacting with Peet's staff. I was unfortunately let down and felt worse than when I had entered. I don't feel comfortable returning to a location that doesn't actively listen and respond appropriately to it's customers and also not recognize that we pay the extra money to get coffee out for the convenience and interaction (we are provided free coffee at work, I don't need to go to Peet's, I chose to).", "author": "Brandie O."}

The irony.\n\nI accidentally referred to the drink size I was ordering as \"grande\" as opposed to Peet's chosen language of \"medium.\" I get it, there's some sort of weird competition between Peet's and Starbucks.

He understood just fine. He was pretty clearly just trying to shame me, which is perhaps more sad than irritating.\n\nRegardless, it just kind of ruined the latte and cookie-purchasing experience that I had there. To top it off, my drink was made hot instead of iced, so I had to stand there (next to this barista who was dripping with resentment for me because I inadvertently used Italian instead of English to describe a DRINK SIZE, mind you) while they re-made it correctly.\n\nMoral of the story, not all flower children are citizens of the world?\n\nCiao!", "author": "Cecily T."}

UPDATE: Ignore my previous review above, other than great coffee and good people inside. There are two things here that I find very annoying 1. Is that Peet's is allowing the pan handler to park his ass right in front of there establishment. He's right in front of you as you try to have a enjoyable cup of coffee on the bench out front. He bothers every single passerby, and comments on personal conversations, Peet's allows it.. 2. Peet's allows smokers to continue smoking at the side tables, right by non smoking signs.

I'm confused by all the reviews saying that the people are polite, maybe I'm going at the wrong time. I have been here three times and each staff member acts as though Jesus himself is serving the coffee. It's ridiculous. Eye rolling, sighs, sneers (basically over asking for a iced mocha, so really? Not asking for the world)...I'm a pretty easygoing person, generally don't expect the world of people, but I always leave feeling horrible. Never again Peets. There are other coffee shops in this area and I can find one sans the attitude. \n\nHowever, as a caveat, this applies to the two men who work around the 3-4 p.m. time. Not sure what the staff is like any other time. I hear the morning is generally good. The afternoon staff is rude enough to make me never return though. \n\nPlus one star for the guy who actually MAKES the coffee...because he always fills my cup to the top, with limited ice, which is awesome. Makes it worth the $$ I pay and he's always very friendly.", "author": "K S."}

I had just walked a million blocks after having spent the day shopping (more walking) and I just needed some hydration. I walked in and nobody looked at me weird as if I was annoying them. Then, I asked if they had any tea still left for iced tea. The girl informed me that she had just thrown it out.

How many people do you know 2 minutes before closing who would offer to dirty more dishes and stay after closing time to make tea??

Since neither of us were working regular jobs our coffee sessions came at odd times. Fortunately for us it meant that Peet's was never crowded (as it was at quarter to 9 this morning,) but unfortunately that makes the experience a bit less anonymous. \n\nSo after four or five visits I noticed a really uncomfortable trend: there was this women, about my age, maybe a few years older who was always there when we were there. She's tan, very fit, always in athletic clothes. I'm not trying to tell you I'm attracted to her, because I'm not, but I'm telling you I couldn't shake this broad.\n\nTo this day I haven't exchanged a word with her, but she keeps popping up, not only at Peet's anymore. I see her running, I see her at brunch. And in different neighborhoods, too.\n\nShe acts like she's never noticed me, which is ridiculous, but every once in awhile she'll give a look over her shoulder while jogging, and I never have time to throw up my arms to say \"It ain't me.\"\n\nI mean on paper I'm like one of the 6 least threatening guys in San Francisco. I'm short and I'm round and warm and fuzzy and all of a sudden I'm the stalker? F that!\n\nDoesn't this person do her homework? Hasn't she done a composite sketch of me and fed into the new Google Image Identifier and run a full background and credit check on me yet? \n\nJeez, I just want an F-ing coffee lady, stop following me!\n\nAnyway, she wasn't there today.", "author": "Jason R."}
