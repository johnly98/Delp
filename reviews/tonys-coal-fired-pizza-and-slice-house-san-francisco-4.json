Really don't see those often so it's a rare treat when I do get to have pizza with potato as a topping. This place is actually right next to Tony's Pizza, which is probably the bigger sitdown area next to this place for those who want to sit and relax while they enjoy their pizza. Anyways, I came here on a weekend and got two slices of their purple potato pizza to-go. It may be a coincidence, but when I got there, I had to wait for the purple potato pizza and had to wait for it to bake, perhaps a testament to its popularity compared to their other offerings.\n\nEach slice is pretty large and topped generously with plenty of bacon. There's a couple of giant purple potato slices on top, slathered with pesto, which paired well together. It's also pretty oily, due to the bacon, which only made it more delicious. The crust is pretty good and crunchy and sprinkled with abundant herbs. The above is made even more delicious due to the fact that the pizza was piping hot when I ate it. After I finished, I was pretty satiated and left feeling pretty full.\n\nIn my opinion, $5.50 is a lot for a slice of pizza, but since they're larger than a normal slice of pizza, I think it's a lot more reasonable after taking that into account. It also helped that I got really full of those two slices. I look forward to coming back here again, and I saw a calzone on the counter, and I think I could see myself getting that next time if I'm not in the mood for the purple potato pizza. All in all, for those looking for a quick bite, I would highly recommend this to anyone who is craving pizza.", "author": "Nelson X."}

I thought about Tony's, the other infamous pizza in the area, since I tried the other well-known Golden Boy.  Tony's has it sit-down restaurant at the corner and its pizza take out by the pie or slice is couple of storefronts up on Stockton St. \n\nThey offer five pizzas by the slice, Pepperoni. California Veggie, NY Cheese, Meat Lover's and 4 Cheese and a Sicilian Combo calzone. There are other choices by the whole pie. Checking out the pizzas, I went with the Meat Lover's.  It's a large slice with a crust that has the right crisp to it. Not crispy like a flatbread pizza. It had a perfect combination of tomato sauce, melted cheese, bacon, salami, pepperoni slices and pieces of tasty sausage. Some pizzas are greasy, but there was no grease at all here. It was so good, that I had to order another one. \n\nThe shop has one table that sits four, but there is a table in front and tables at their curb area. It was a little drizzly on this day, which made the outdoor tables not useable.  Luckily I was able to sit in the inside table to enjoy my pizza. \n\nDelicious NY style pizza at Tony's, which offers a different option to the Neapolitan style offered at the other infamous place around the corner.

Apparently, they get the beef for these heavenly sandwiches from Capo's, down the street (which only used to serve them at lunch, but now serve at lunch and dinner - you're welcome). So, if your hungry little heart is on the quest for this sandwich, you'll need to get there earlier in the day to score. \n\nIn addition to pizza by the slice, they also offer whole pies, and some thick Chicago style too.

The selection is much smaller than the actual restaurant.\n\nI don't know why it's not the same quality but maybe they churn out more pies here for quick demand. The crust is always off here.

Fantastic huge slices of pizza by the slice, approx. $5.50 a slice.\n\n5 stars You can order anything on the restaurant menu from here without the wait (the restaurant wait was 1 1/2 hours when we visited). We were able to snag one of three tables outside and dine alfresco, there is also one booth inside.\n\nThe menu can be a bit confusing for first timers like us.  They make three different types of pizza crust cooked in three different ovens, coal, gas and wood.  Certain pizzas cooked in certain ovens have certain toppings and flavor combinations. Trust me and if ordering from here versus the restaurant, just grab some pizza by the slice which is made in the 525 degree Rotoflex glass oven.  The pizza is hot, fresh and tasty and tasted way better than the one we waited 25 minutes for which was cooked in the wood fired oven:\n\n2 stars $23 Skip the wood fired Margherita pizza they are famous for (they only make 73 per day) when ordering from take out, it gets soggy and watery, and tasted almost sour/bitter from being burned and charred.  I was not a fan and was told later by several employees that the wood fired Margherita pizza is only good when dining in the restaurant. The slices behind the glass which are hot and ready to go, or whole pies not made in the wood fired oven are much better from take out.\n\n5 stars Slices of Veggie pizza with tons of fresh veggies, sauce was not salty or overpowering, crust was light, a pleasure to eat, we all loved it.\n\n5 stars Slices 4 cheese, also very decadent, rich and tasty\n\n5 stars Little Italy Salad $12 with chopped castelveltrano olives, shaved parmesan, walnuts, imported gorgonzola, cherry tomatoes and a great balsamic, fresh greens, large enough to share with 3-4 people for a side salad serving.\n\nLoved our new SF discovery!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-05-17", "description": "This is the to-go extension to the sit-down version of Tony's Pizza Napoletana which is next door. Tony's Pizza has been on the \"Best Pizza in America\" list and has won a lot of pizza awards making it on the must visit list of people visiting SF. This has resulted in long wait times at Tony's (minimum 1 hour plus for a table) positioning the Slice house as a convenient place to get a slice to-go quickly.\n\nActually Tony's is so popular that even the Slice house which has a couple of seats inside and outside ends up being full with a line out of the door. I've passed by a couple of times but have skipped it as the line has been way too long for my comfort. A couple of days ago around lunch time there was no line so I went in. It seems that the slice house is \"what you see is what you get\", meaning you can select from whatever pizza they have in the display case on the counter, take it or leave it. Unfortunately when I went all that they had in the case was some Stromboli, Calzones, Cheese pizza and Peperoni pizza. Looking at the small selection I decided to get their Calzone ($8) to-go (+55c for to-go box).\n\nAs the calzone was already precooked, it was heated up and I was on my way. It seemed that they had brushed the calzone with some sort of oil to give it a fresh feel, all of which stuck to the to-go box leaving the calzone dry as a bone. The calzone seemed to be decent sized, but it was just a hollow pocket of thick bread. There was hardly any filling inside. The two tiny containers of marinara sauce that came with the calzone tasted like plain crushed tomatoes. Overall this was probably one of the worst calzones that I've had. Only the hollow center was edible. The sides were state bread fit for the dustbin, so that's where they ended up. At $6+ per slice this had to be one of the most expensive to-go pizza places in the area (where rates range from $3.75 - $5).\n\nThis is a Tourist Trap. They are cashing in on their popularity by charging premium prices for average stuff. The 55c for the to-go box is testament to how confident they are of maintaining their prices. My recommendation would be that while visiting SF, if you need to scratch the itch of checking Tony's off your list, go to the sit down version. At-lease over there after waiting for an hour you will get to order a pizza of your choice rather than being forced to buy super expensive slices of what's available. I on the other hand have no intention of returning.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

I've been coming to Tony's slice house on 2nd, at the ballpark, and Tony's Pizza Napoletana since they've opened. For the last 3 years or so I've been coming to Tony's Coal Fired for the beef sandwiches as they've been good and with gravy that's been delicious. Last night it was such a failure I need to let people know since the manager there didn't seem to take much interest in my complaint. \nOrdered original wet Italian Beef and one with sausage, but no sausage at 4pm. Ok then, two originals please. The gravy was just beef fat, not the salty flavor filled liquid I wanted. Again, greasy flavorless congealing fat. Brought back sandwich and was shown and told that is how they've made. They even poured some into a container for me. 3/4 fat 1/4 gravy. They offered to make another sandwich but why would I want the same greasy pile. So I asked for the cup of gravy, showed my friend, whose comment on how gross that was isn't postable, and poured off the grease and watched it harden as it hit the cold San Francisco air. Yuck. Poured tiny bit of gravy on remaining sandwich. \nTony G, I hope you read this. Please smack anyone who sullies a potentially great sandwich and thinks a 1/4 cup of beef grease is a scoop of gravy.

This spot is the takeout version of Tony's main restaurant right next door. Since it can be an extremely long wait to get a seat at the main restaurant, this place is a great alternative if you're looking to get the same pizza without the lines.\n\nJust so you know - only the pizzas that are on display are available for grab and go. I ordered the New Yorker and we had to wait around 20-30 minutes before our pizza was ready. It was still shorter than what it would've been if we were waiting at the main restaurant, but it would've been nice to have been aware of this before we picked that pizza.\n\nSeating is nonexistent. You'll probably be standing outside the restaurant or at the one table right outside, but it's not bad as this place is often well trafficked and it's pretty socially acceptable to just stand outside.

He honestly told me, \"you know what bro, I didn't even take their order, I wouldn't know\". We talked for two seconds about how ridiculously they were acting. he apologized for them doing so, and gave me a full refund, even though it wasn't *technically* his fault these two chicks took the pizza. \n\nHis exact words were, \"hey man, I didn't want you to stand there and wait for nothing\", and he handed me two slices of four-cheese pizza on the house. \n\nHoly. \nBalls. \n\nLiterally the best pizza I've EVER had in my entire life. Cheese was melty, the ricotta was creamy and quality, and it was delicious. There was barely any sauce, if any, which is how I want my pizza. I couldn't get over the fact that the crust rated almost as if it were deep fried. Everything about it was great. \n\n\n\nFast forward to today, Monday September 4th, and we ordered when there was actually pizza available to order. I had to come back. First impressions are everything and I was genuinely impressed. \n\nWe ordered the New Yorker, piled with cheeses, spicy sausage and pepperoni, and had a whole pizza in this instance. \n\nThe ingredients were top notch. The sausage was great, and the same cheesy quality it had before was there again.

But, I couldn't resist the fun of posting a review of one of the top spots in SF for pizza.\n\nIf you know the pizza scene in SF, you know that Tony Gemignani is basically the wunderkind of authentic NY style pizza.   If you are looking for a great place to try higher end Tony's pizza without having to go to a sit down spot, you're in luck.  Simply put, great for what it is.   I'm excited to write the following as it is still National Pizza Day on February 9th, 2016.\n\nThe dough is cooked to a perfect place in relation to the sauce, cheese and great ingredients. This is what truly great NY pizza is.  It's about the crispy and flavorful dough, with sauce and cheese that are integrated rather than floating on top.  It's about perfection in the balance of ingredients, water and heat.  This is it.  Maybe not the best pizza ever, but a true representation of the style.  They have a good range of options - and yeah, you can get other types of slices like Sicilian or Detroit.  You are probably best served to try the classic NY cheese slice.  Go from there.\n\nI fell in love with Golden Boy Pizza first when I came to SF.  I've subsequently gone on to fall in love with some other really good stuff.  Tony's can be very good, and I rate it a tie as my favorite spot to get a slice in North Beach.  The lines can be daunting if you come at the wrong time.  And they won't tolerate nonsense, they don't need you.  They're well-known, so don't sound off about the line moving slower than it should.  If you're savvy enough to be here, you probably get it.  Take it in.  They have tremendous pizza in the garden spot of SF to eat a great piece of pizza.  I shared a few pictures that I hope illustrate it.\n\nBTW - The spot outside on the street to eat your slice is world-class on a nice day.", "author": "Adam S."}

I've had it numerous times. The toppings are always top notch and the crust is always soft with a great chew. I don't know if it was the size of the pizzas we ordered, but there was too much crust on these slices. Granted, the pizza was huge, but I was left with this giant piece of bread at the end. It felt like a waste. I wish they made the crust smaller so we'd get more toppings and sauce. Also, since we got the pizzas delivered, they weren't that hot, so the crust was extra chewy. It was kinda like a jaw work out.\n\nI've had their pepperoni before. Always a solid pie. The meat, mushroom, and garlic pie was also good. I adore mushrooms and garlic. I thought the potato and bacon pie was okay. I'm not a huge fan of feta, so this was my least favorite slice. I loved the caesar salad! I adore anchovies, so this was definitely my kind of caesar. Since we got five salads, they packaged it up into one giant salad.\n\nThis is the 2nd time I've had delivery from Tony's and it's not quite the same. The crust gets a little too chewy as it cools.

It's no contest.\n\nBut, we don't always need 20 pizza variety options, do we?  \n\nWe stopped in last night after trying the newest new neighborhood joint, BarNua.  \n\nThere were about 8 or 9 pie flavors to choose from, & 2 different crust styles; thick or thin.  There are also calzones & sammies for heartier fare.\n\nThe service was outstanding.  The cashier greeted us like he knew us, took our order, & then, as our order was being filled, he asked us what we'd been up to tonight.  He then went on to tell us about another couple that had come in earlier that had also just checked out a new spot in the hood.  We were made to feel like primo regulars, even though I'd never actually been here before.  I've always gone next door.  I didn't get his name, but what a prince of a guy & an employee.  Props.\n\nWe went w 2 picante slices.  Our order was plated for us in about a minute.  Sweet.  (If you order a sammy, or there are a lot people waiting in front of you, your wait may be longer).  This pizza was flavorfully potent, the crust had bite, w good texture contrasts between the toppings, the base, & the creamy, smooth peaks of mozzarella.  \n\nThe only thing for me is that I like a more crispy crust.  I want it crispy everywhere & throughout.  This was solid w bite, but it did have a soft component.  It was not soggy at all (most importantly), just a softer bite.  There's a big difference.\n\nAll seating is outside, except for one booth that seats about 6.  Only one table in the house?

We got two slices of pepperoni to go.  They were kind of busy, so we had a little bit of a wait and there isn't a lot of space to stand inside.  They have a great little sidewalk patio area, though.

First,it hurts to do this as a former business owner. I know how hard it is to run a business. And believe it or not, I really like Tony's and their sister restaurant Capo's. But my customer service experience was so bad yesterday that I'm not sure I will ever go to either again. I have been to both places several times and have even recommended them to others. But when a business becomes too successful and starts treating customers like cattle, then it's time to speak up. \n\nYesterday I called the slice house and ordered a pizza ahead of time. I called, was put on hold for 10 minutes, then hung up on. I called back and spoke to a very rushed person. She told me it would be about 60 minutes for delivery and 30 minutes if I could pick it up. I opted to pick it up. I arrived to find a line of about 30 people waiting to order and complete chaos inside. I asked those in line if they had already ordered and was told that they had not. Several customers told me to go ahead and ask to pay for the pizza I had already ordered. When I asked the person at the counter he said...\"no....go to the back of the line\". I asked, \"Really? That is why I called ahead. Do I really have to get in line and wait an hour, while the pizza you made sits there?\" He said \"yes\" and walked away. \n\nI then went over to Tony's and asked to speak with a manager. The same guy came out but this time he was more empathetic. \"I know what you're saying. It's not a good policy but it's what we're told to do.\" I asked, \"So then what's the advantage of calling ahead? You get cold food when you call ahead? That makes no sense.\"\n\nHe said \"I know. Sorry.\" Then...he STILL would not give me the pizza that was siting there???? Unreal. Never again. I know you probably don't care Tonys but I have been to your restaurant at least 30 times and its obvious that you do not care if I come back. And I won't. And I will never recommend you to others again. \n\nThe story has a happy ending. Tomassos on Kearny made me an awesome pizza and they treated me as if they appreciated the business. They even said \"Thank you!\" And they have a new customer. :)", "author": "Edward N."}

Cheese slices are usually very greasy but this one is only just a little bit greasy.\n\nThe system is pretty standard.

Tony's Coal Fired Pizza.\n\nYou get the same giant slices: beautifully charred crust, thick tomato sauce, expertly melted cheese, and killin' meats as the original (that sausage...My God.) without the line, blathering tourists or temptation to order a non-pizza item. If you come at the right time, you might even be able to snag a slice of their grandma's or Detroit style. The best part? These puppies come out fast. Beautiful. Take them to Washington square park and soak in the ambiance, rays, and grease.\n\nDownsides? The selection can be limited, Chicago beef sandwiches are only served after 3:00 (which means that I'll probably be drunk if I ever get one), and the prices are justifiably high for a slice of the best in the city, making Tony's a rare indulgence.\n\n4.5 stars...mmm...\n\nNear the 30/45 8 and 39.\n\nDO get a beer from the corner store and dine al fresco in the park.\n\nDO NOT expect me to share.", "author": "Casey U."}

It is def' pricey, but it is well worht the price\n2. The NY style pizza crust was good but not amazing. I like a tiny bit of crunch on my NY/Ct style pizzas\n3. One of the best things in SF so that means a long wait and line. They dont take reservations, so be prepared to wait if you go around peak times.\n4. We ordered calamari and it was okay (did not like their custom spicy calamari). Since their pizzas are beyond this world I would not recommend the calamari even though it is not bad, but their pizza is better. \n\nThey have a extremely diverse menu which can be a good and bad thing. It makes it hard to decide which to decide but they are all amazing. So that means you have to try them all eh?

For some reason I was told when I went to pick up a delivery for somebody that there's only ONE line for all orders (phoned-in orders and people ordering slices to go). I saw the phoned-in order I was supposed to get, and I went up to touch it to see how long it had been sitting there. Surely enough it was already getting cold, and the female cashier even acknowledged that it was my to-go order, but she still VERY rudely tells me and another person that we have to get in line to pay. And the line is way out the door. And it LITERALLY takes MORE THAN 5 MINS EACH per transaction because she LEAVES the register after EVERY transaction (just leaves, she's not helping the pizza makers or doing any work, she just disappears). And of course again, she's the only cashier there. When they HAVE TWO REGISTERS THERE.\n\nThat just makes no type of sense at all; So you rather me get back in line to wait 45 min for a delivery order THAT I CAN ALREADY SEE SITTING IN THE FREAKING WINDOW, INSTEAD OF JUST GETTING THE TO-GO ORDERS OUT THE WAY????

I mean winning a pizza contest in California cannot be hard. That's like Thor winning a strongest man competition against squishy human types. But winning in esteemed locations where pizza is actually consumed, like New York (sorry Chi-town, your soup in a biscuit dish isn't pizza), does peak my interest and get me excited. Which is why I was so disappointed in the end. I've been coming to the Bay Area for years and have learned that where pizza is concerned I must suspend my disbelief and just go with it, but Tony's is supposed to be different. It's supposed to be Napoletana style. It's supposed to be award winning. Sadly in the end it's just okay. \n\nWhen I arrived at the restaurant I was directed to the slice business on the side because I just wanted a pick-up pizza. The line was pretty quick and I only waited about 10 mins to order. I was suspicious when I read the menu and saw that they sell a variety of pizza like products, which is generally the hallmark of a pizza dabbler, not master. They had Chicago style (not pizza), Napoletana style (yes, pizza), NY (definitely pizza), and what I can only assume is California style labelled as by the slice (pizza?). The service staff was excellent, friendly, and helpful, so I pushed down my misgivings. I ordered a whole pie and was happy that they made them fresh. Definitely +1. They quoted me 20 mins, but has the pie out in 15. Another plus and I was on my way back to the hotel with some piping pizza in hand. I kept the lid closed while in the taxi to ensure that the pizza stayed as hot as possible. My hotel was only a quick 5-6 min drive away. Once I arrived I ran up the stairs juggling this giant pizza box all the way, and down the hallway into my room. Cracking open the box I smelled that delicious pizza aroma-- hot yeasty deliciousness with a hint of cheese and sauce. Oh joy!\nI let my teeth sink into that pile of doughy delight awaiting the slight toothsome crunch of superior pizza... Nothing. Sigh. \n\nDon't get me wrong. The pizza is good. The crust had a nice dabbling of char and the rise on the end crust was classical perfection. The problem was the taste did not mirror the beauty of the pizza. The sauce was bland and for my taste there was a bit too much, which I had to painstakingly remove. The meat overwhelmed the cheese and I didn't get the sweet note you find in a high quality mozzarella. The ricotta was the real star and definitely elevated the pizza into the realm of 4 stars, but in the end I'm giving Tony's just 3 stars for being pretty okay in the land of pizza, but 5 stars in California-land.", "author": "Adina P."}

I just had a strange experience though so i wanted to get their attention to get it fixed.  I've ordered to-go pizza from here religiously for the past 8 months (I had a baby 8 months ago) and I just went to get the Sausage and Stout, but was told that they never do this to go.  Not true, I did it last month.  I challenged this a little but didn't want to be a jerk.  Apparently the story is now that this has only ever been for dining in.\n\nFirst thought was \"not true\", because it's not.  Second thought was, \"why?\".  Are the locals your bread & butter?  The wait is long and it's hard to get in, particularly when you have a baby.  I hope this doesn't sound like I'm an entitled local, but I really just want access to the same great pizza options as everyone else.  It's already hard enough to not have kids and I've had like 1,000 New Yorkers, Honey Pies, Cal Italias, and Camparis, and I need to change it up sometimes.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'll keep ordering, but I'll probably have a chip on my shoulder.  Maybe just put it on the menu, if it's not something that I can order, and then I'll be totally fine.  I just can't handle the uncertainty of not being able to get any great pizza on the menu, any time I want (during business hours).", "author": "David P."}

I'm sad to say that what was once my favorite pizza that I've had from across the world has sunken much farther down on my list.\nService: The host was very nice and quoted us a 45 minute wait that ended up only being 10 minutes, which was great! It went downhill from here though. After we gave our order, we were brought our waters and our salad. I was pretty thirsty so I drank the water in about 2 minutes...and it was never refilled again for the half hour we were eating there. The waitress walked by several times, but never once offered. When she brought our pizza, she didn't offer cheese/pepper that all other tables had, so when I asked for cheese she gave me an annoyed 'okay' and brought it begrudgingly. The final turnoff was by the end of the meal, I realized that the waitress never once looked at me when asking how everything was, only to my fiancee. Don't get me wrong, I would rather her be treated well than me, but I would've appreciate a little love too!\nFood: We got the 'seasonal salad', which yesterday was a limoncello and balsamic dressing with greens and topped with egg. The first bite was good, but honestly it was just wayyyy to much acid. I don't think I would ever be so pompous as to say something like that, but it seriously burned the tip of your tongue on the way in and was just sour. I had to force myself to eat every bite after the second. The pizza was fine, just smaller than I remember and the sauce not as unique. My expectations might have been too high, but I've had better for much less than 20 bucks a pie. \nAtmosphere: We sat outside which was really nice! The inside is always a bit loud, but what you'd expect from an italian joint.\n\nOverall: I was sadly disappointed in this visit and my last. I'm not sure if it was just a fluke, but it seems like maybe Tony's is falling into the complacency trap of success. With all the competition in the area, I will be trying every other place in the area before I come give Tonys another chance. Not the worst restaurant I've had by any means, just a little disappointed.", "author": "Brad M."}

Drool.\n\nDespite my love for thin crust pizza, it took me a while to give this place a try because I was afraid it was over-hyped and touristy. What was I thinking going so long without having had Tony's pizza?!\n\nPer Yelp recommendation, we ordered the Margherita and took it over to Washington Square Park for a little picnic. To me, the crust/dough makes or breaks a pizza, and Tony's has their dough down. It's incredibly chewy, yet melts in your mouth at the same time. I can't wait to go back and try all the other pizzas here.

The Castro valley restaurant was great so I was expecting a great pizza. Unfortunately on Tuesdays the main restaurant is closed and you can only get slices. So I had no choice but to get a couple of slices to try. I usually don't get slices because you can't judge a pizza if its been reheated. It needs to be fresh out of the oven to really experience the true flavor, texture, chewy Ness, etc. The first thing I noticed was that the pepperoni slice was picture perfect. So I took a picture. I usually douse my pizza with parmigiano. Luckily I didn't and tryed it first. It was so salty which means they use a lot of salt in their sauce. Too much for my taste. Then I noticed they use too much corn meal on the bottom. Then as I ate my way to the crust I realized the crust tasted like bread. So I was severely disappointed as to get to this place if you are driving is extremely difficult as there is no parking Anywhere around the place. So I will never go back for a slice but one day I will try a whole pie fresh from the oven when the main restaurant is open.", "author": "James F."}

This is no foo foo pizza joint, and I didn't get a salad on top of either slice.  Today's selection was the NY Cheese and Margherita slices.   \n\nThe Cheese slice (my NY hopeful) looked the part, with some beautiful (albeit unhealthy) grease on top from the cheese and sauce.  After dabbing the excess grease off with my napkin, I picked it up and folded it!  Yes, that's right.  For you non-New Yorkers, that is how a real slice of pizza is eaten.  The crust was excellent, crispy enough and thin enough to be noticed under the usual goodies.  The cheese and sauce were good, but this is where it missed the NY boat.  Regardless, the total package was yummy and worthy of the 4 stars.\n\nThe Margherita was very saucy, but in a good way.  There was just enough cheese and the small blob of basil that seemed to be dropped in one place just needed to be spread out to provide a tasty bite each time.  This wasn't your standard Margherita, but I liked it anyway.  Taste over substance wins in this case.", "author": "Larry Z."}

As much as I love pizza, my wife is from Illinois and we couldn't pass up an opportunity to try what sound like 'authentic' Chicago Italian Beef sandwiches. Walked up the hill from the wharf on a hot Sunday, got their around 3:30pm, waited in line. Place is a hole in the wall, only real seating was outside in the sun. My wife was particularly excited to hear that they served a 'combo' (Italian beef and sausage) as that is what she always has when she is in Illinois. We reach the counter, my wife orders a combo, the woman steps away for a few moments then comes back and tells us they are out of sausages, so they can't make a combo. 3:30... out of sausages? It would probably be best not to include items on the menu that they don't have a serious intention on being able to serve.

This review is about the damned weirdest experience we had a month ago at the counter. We showed up there on a weekday, maybe 15-20 minutes before closing. I hadn't had my NY pizza fix and had to have a slice. I was disappointed to discover that the remaining selection of about 7 or 8 random slices was pretty limited (no cheese, mostly unusual CA toppings), but I compromised when the woman behind the counter brusquely told us too bad, this all we have.  Another party walked in behind us, saw the limited selection, asked if that was it, and walked out. Our two slices were reheated hastily, and weren't as hot as they should be, but fine, like I said, I'm a Tony's fan. As we devoured them, at least two more groups of two walked in, and formed a line. When someone in the first group started asking about the limited selection, the woman behind the counter got all pissed, yelled something like \"You know what?!\" and -- in front of a line of waiting customers -- swept all the remaining slices INTO THE GARBAGE, and announced in a loud voice \"WE'RE CLOSED!\" and stormed away from the counter.  Everyone looked at each other, scowled, and walked out. It was still 5 minutes before closing. While it's true that a little entertainment during meals often enhances the dining experience, in truth I was really angry with how all these people were treated, including myself.  Absolutely, incredibly unprofessional behavior, to say the least.\n\nSO LISSEN UP TONY !!\n\nIf this is your policy, you gotta re-think it TODAY. Understand that it's a NORMAL cost of business to have a few slices left over at the end of the day. Build it into the price if you have to. And you gotta plan for the fact that some days are unpredictably busier than others, and that sometimes there can be a small rush before closing because, you know, you're closing.  And if this isn't your policy, you've got yourself a serious EMPLOYEE problem that needs to be addressed soon before she pisses off enough other people to damage your reputation, which is what keeps your business thriving.", "author": "Richard A."}

Disappointed, I was about to turn back when I noticed this place. \n\nI walked in and they were selling slices of pizza along with items like Stromboli. I wanted a slice of Margherita pizza (to tide me over for an hour while I explore other restaurants) only to be told that it was not available as the restaurant was closed. More disappointment!  So I ordered a slice of NY  Cheese pizza. It was $3.75 plus taxes. The person put the slice in a revolving oven of some sort and presto!  Out comes a delicious slice of pizza. It was excellent tasting with right crunch, texture and a beautiful finish!  I loved it so much that I decided to ditch my expedition to explore other restaurants and just have a few more slices. I ordered a slice of California ($5 plus taxes) and another slice of NY Cheese to go. By the time I reached my hotel (near Clay and Battery), the pizza got cold. In hindsight, I should have eaten it right there. But the temptation of eating pizza and watching the Mavericks play the Spurs in the NBA playoffs from the comfort of my hotel room was too tempting.  Still the pizza tasted really good. \n\nI would come here again in a heartbeat!", "author": "Gopal R."}

We went to Tonys on a Sunday late afternoon when the weather was beautiful outside. Bypassed the 50 minute wait to sit by getting pizza by the slice instead. We were served pretty quickly and ate our pizza in the park which was great. But a couple of customers had been waiting north of 30 minutes for the pies they ordered. And the staff wasn't great at being proactive and handling customer service. Recommend not ordering a whole pie unless you're doing delivery.", "author": "Rebecca G."}

No need.  The food here is delicious if you want a quick bite and no fuss.  Slices, calzones and stromboli's are served in boxes.  Brilliant.  I always order too much food because they all look so good to me and I could never decide, just order all.  When you are done eating, just fold the top over and take it home.  The crust is so delicious.  I have a soft spot for calzones and I must order one if available.  The meat cheese and ricotta combination were perfect.  However, I could only eat half in one sitting.  I took the remaining half and the extra slice home.  Ate those the next day at lunch and although it was good, it definitely does not compared to the hot and fresh served at the restaurant.  There is only one banquette table inside the restaurant because this is basically a take out place, there are about 5 tables outside and there were a few available when we came.  This is my new favorite calzone.  Thank you.", "author": "t d."}

My husband said his was good. It's a small little restaurant with only one table inside but several outside. The only complaint is that if you order the pizza by the slice it's not fresh. It's taken from a glass case and reheated in the oven. However, that's to be expected when you order by the slice.

We were actually looking for a sit down restaurant and had put our name in next door (Tony's). We were told the wait was about 65 minutes. Being that it was almost 8:00pm and we had our two small girls with us, who were starving, we ventured next door. To our surprise we found out that they were one in the same. Sharing the same kitchen and offering the same food. We lucked out and snatched up the only booth inside. There are a few patio tables outside but it was chilly and packed. We ordered a couple of slices of pizza, an order of calamari, and a spaghetti. Great food and excellent pizza. After we finished our meal we noticed the party that was in front of us next door was still waiting for a table. Not being from the area they were recommended to us by the concierge at our hotel.

I went there with great expectations and I can see why people really love the place. I just liked it. The crust was my greatest problem. It was soft and bready thin crust.  The crust reminded me of Naan bread, not pizza crust. The Ribiola pizza was very good with the exception of the crust. We also had a Marguerita pizza which was quite tasty but the sauce was thin and runny. We got each a glass of chianti and barbera which had zero complexity yet for $8/$9 a glass I would have liked SOME complexity. They also were served warm which did not help.

Having lived in NYC for the past 3 years I had high expectations but I'm not a pizza snob by any means. I went to the window and ordered a slice of pepperoni - a pretty good marker to review a slice. It was pretty damn good. No use going into it and having a pizza debate but for me this did it! Base is slightly thicker than NY style but that's ok. It was nice and chewy. Pepperoni was really nice and best of all it was not too oily. Cheese and sauce ratio perfect. Overall 9/10 for the pizza. The price is a whopping $4.50 a slice tho!!
