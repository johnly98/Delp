I've actually been here before when I bought one of their rotisserie chickens whole during my more gluttonous days (photo: http://bit.ly/2JCTUoU). I still like rotisserie chicken, but I don't devour whole ones anymore. I came back here as I was strolling on Polk in the evening and noticed they still have the chicken. It looked like they expanded their sandwich and salad menu considerably since my last visit (photo: http://bit.ly/2t4QgsY). Otherwise it was still the same dark corner spot it was before with the tables crowded together and the occasional vagrant or persistent clubbers sauntering in to use the facilities.\n\nI was seriously going to order the $9.49 Kale Salad, but I looked up and saw the $11.99 Half Chicken & Half Salad featured. Ah, my memory of the rotisserie chicken must have kicked in because that's what I ordered. It was a hefty serving of food as the relatively decent house salad came on its own plate with mixed greens, tomato slices, red onion buried by a load of croutons with a balsamic dressing on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/2JDW9Is). On the other plate laid the half rotisserie chicken which definitely looked good (photo: http://bit.ly/2HLlKK1). Too bad the breast meat was a bit dried out, but the leg and especially the thigh maintained their juiciness. Gluttony kept in check.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...middling as rotisserie chickens go if Costco has the gold standard\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...feels more like a tavern than a cafe\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...manager was very friendly\nTOTAL - 3 stars...I can still satisfy that rotisserie hankering", "author": "Ed U."}

To be honest, I stopped eating here months ago after I saw the person prepping food stuff a large piece of chicken into his mouth. It was not a tiny piece either. It was enough to get chicken on his beard, which I saw as I approached the counter to order. I was so disgusted by this that I changed my mind about ordering and never came back. \n\nI used to work in the food industry, so I've been food safety certified. I also used to prep meals in large industrial kitchens for donations, so I have plenty of food experience. It's okay to taste food, but you can't eat a healthy serving from the same counter you're prepping the food. That is just disgusting! If you really want a taste, you put it on a plate and eat it somewhere else. Otherwise, you can contaminate the other ingredients if food or saliva falls out of your mouth while eating. How many of us have spilled food? It's very easy to do. \n\nI've also seen non-service animals enter the restaurant and seen the food prep people pet the animals and just place gloves over their hands without washing them. Again, food safety violation!\n\nThis makes me sad because I was a big fan of the steak salad. Oh well, I'd rather avoid an eatery if it also means avoiding potential illness.", "author": "Joanna S."}

Recently I was looking to order online through a delivery app and noticed all the food here was marked up by 3-5$ on every item. I mean the salad was 14$ on this delivery site, and when you go inside the restaurant it is 9-10$ for that same salad. That's not good business. It kinds of turns me away when I see a business do that. Consistency is very important to me. Especially when I am spending my money here for lunch every day. When I asked an employee about the price difference, he told me it was so the delivery driver can make extra money. Here I am, being taken for a fool over an over priced salad. \n\nMy lesson here is, while the food is good you are going to love it. Don't order online.

These fries were crispy and fairly thin.\n\nOnion Rings - $4 - I think these are a better deal than the sweet potato fries. The ranch sauce is a little different than ranch.

For the entree I got the \"Hillbilly Wrap\" (pulled pork, caesar dressing, avocado, croutons). This tasted like a unique, creative take on a sandwich (loved that there was a spinach tortilla option) and was a perfect choice for anyone who strays away from gluten. To add, I'm sure my friends and I were so annoying but the employees were very nice and friendly! Definitely want to come back here during normal hours to try some more wraps :)", "author": "Nicole W."}

But there are clearly better options in the neighborhood (Bite). \n\nThe reason they get a 1 star is because of deceitful pricing and poor service. \n\nThe prices when you order pick up online are hyper inflated.  To the tune of $12 online vs. $9 in store for the New York sandwich, for example.  \n\nThere's no indication of this being the case when you order and the wait staff are unapologetic for the difference when you go to pick up your food.  \n\nI can understand surcharges for delivery, and I can MAYBE understand a small fee for 'convenience' online, but $3.00 on top of a $9.00 order is absurd.\n\nOh yeah, to add insult to injury, they add a $0.25 bag fee automatically.  I don't need a bag for one damn sandwich and now I have change jingling in my pocket because that brought the order up to $13.05. \n\nBlah.  Just a poor experience overall.

Should have never have gone back.\n\nI went in on a Sunday night to get a sandwich with my boyfriend. The jarring reggae rock music was so loud, my boyfriend had to ask the girl at the register literally 6 times to repeat herself. I'm sorry, but if you're going to ask \"Wouldchulikeiceinyourcuphowmuch\" with a nasty look on your face while playing the music THAT loud, don't get all pissed off when people can't hear you and politely ask you to repeat yourself. My order experience wasn't much better.\n\nWhen we nicely tried to clean up after ourselves and brought the baskets up to the register to ask where we could put them, she made a face at us, scoffed, and said \"Take those back to your table to be bussed.\" Why does the staff even bother working in a restaurant if they are so obviously disgusted to work there and interact with other humans!?\n\nFOOD: Decent.

The lady behind the counter could not have been more clear that she did not want my business, but then I'd already committed and set my sights on that \"Soothing Chicken\" wrap.  I ordered it to eat there, and sat down.  The waitress/server/?? brought it over a few minutes later, just wrapped in sandwich paper & handed it to me, no utensils, no napkins, nada.  I look over, and sure enough there are baskets like the type for sandwiches sitting on the counter above the kitchen, it's not like they didn't have the capacity to serve something reasonable.\n\nSo I open up my wrap, and it's easily 60% lettuce.  Like we all know lettuce is filler, but holy shit did they fill.  A nice note, the menu proclaims \"All wraps come with lettuce.\"  You weren't kidding!  So here I am, thinking sometimes you gamble and you lose, I very feasibly just could have chosen a shitty spot, but I may as well eat my lettuce and roll with the punches.  But then it happened.  I got to the chicken.  Holy sweet baby Jesus it was some of the best chicken I've ever had served at a restaurant.  Granted, there wasn't much of it, as it was out-shined by the colossal servings of lettuce, but every sweet morsel of chicken that I had tasted like sweet sweet redemption.\n\nSo my quandary. I don't know what to think of this place.  I genuinely don't understand why a business would put so much effort into creating such sublime chicken only to have it tarnished by horrid service and near on abusive portioning tactics.  Maybe management is trying to save a few dollars?  Maybe they don't know how shitty that server is?  But that chicken.  I think I might go back and see what happens if I try to order a wrap sans lettuce.", "author": "Josh T."}

These are good, solid sandwich shops -- each has their own personality but basically, you're getting a big sandwich, some salads (less inspiring), and some sides. \nOver the past 4 years I've seen the sandwiches go from SANDWICHES to sadwiches (yes, sadwiches) -- less meat, more shredded lettuce, less love all around. \nI've also constantly seen \"Help Wanted\" posters in both places for about the past year. I can only imagine that SF's new-found wealth, and lack of affordable living, has created a dearth of food service workers willing to work for minimum wage -- even if SF's minimum is more, it's still not enough to live here.\nSo, what are we left with? We have restos that have less-than-ideally trained employees, we have overpriced sandos with less meat in them than a year ago, we have customers irritated that they have to wait longer for more expensive food.

The menu was extensive, which I usually hate (for the love of g-d, pick the five things you do best and feature them), so I asked the cashier what he recommended - anything with chicken.  I got the cowboy melt with dutch crunch bread and a side of chili.  It was certainly crunchy, but probably because it was left out for a few weeks.  The chili tasted like ketchup with beans.\n\nAs far as the ambiance goes -- well, everything was dirty.  There was an unidentified stain on the bench cushion right next to me, which made me gag once I visualized the tranny hooker eating meals here.\n\nGiven that I will always associate this place with tranny hookers, bad food and unidentified stains, suffice it to say I will not be returning.", "author": "Jonathan S."}

Nope, it was slathered in that sauce, and mustard (which was not listed as one of the items they would put on it)- and after a few bites I noticed their error, and now I am sick. \n I had the sandwich togo, and got out much too late from work to go get this replaced - I'm really pissed off, because I spent over $13 on food that made me miserable after eating only a few bites. I work in a restaurant too, and if I were to make a mistake like this, I would be fired. Will NOT be returning.", "author": "Alexis S."}
