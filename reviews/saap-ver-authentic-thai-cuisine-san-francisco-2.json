We yelped what was in the area and Saap Ver came up and we decided to give it a try. \n\nAfter sitting down, we took a look at the menu, and we were lightweight overwhelmed. There's so many options and we literally didn't know what to order. After browsing for what felt like forever, we decided on the Thai Sausage with Crispy Rice Salad (mild) and the Pork Spare Rib Soup (mild) and a side of sticky rice - I really enjoy rice and soup together and this was a nice combo! \n\nWe enjoyed both of these dishes! Both of these dishes were extremely flavorful and the presentation for both dishes were nice. I did find both of these dishes pretty spicy for a mild though, but I didn't mind. I definitely enjoyed the salad more between the two of these dishes! There were many textures in the dishes and the flavors of everything went really well together! Highly recommend!\n\nOverall I really enjoyed this place! I would come. I'd definitely come back and try their other dishes!", "author": "Stacey Y."}

The ambiance is dark and there is a bar, and it is pretty spacious. Busy on a Wednesday evening. It was even busy on a Monday night. \n\nThe hostess greeted me upon walking in. I requested for a menu for food to-go. The waitress said it would take 30 minutes for them to make the food. \n\nThis authentic Thai restaurant is NOT vegetarian/vegan friendly. I specifically ordered pad see ew, vegetarian with tofu. It arrived with no tofu. When I asked about it she said it costs extra. That makes no sense as beef costs more than tofu. I would have ordered both tofu and veggies.  She gave off a bad energy so I would rather leave with just veggies than wait another entire 30 minutes to fix the order. \n\nAlso they are not friendly towards artists.  Both the hostess and waitress gave me dirty looks because my eye makeup was too out-of-the-ordinary for their liking. \n\nThe portions are small. Last time I was here one year ago, I ordered food for both me and my brother (he was not physically present) and they skimped. It was not enough food for two people. I had even ordered two dishes at the time. It was even smaller portions this time. One dish 15 dollars vegetarian with no tofu. The worst part of the experience at Sap veer was the poor customer service, awful attitude, judgmental stares.\n\nThis place is awful and reeks of bad vibes. Highly not recommended.", "author": "Lydia V."}

This is one of their favorite Thai spots in the city. \n\nThe vibe and decor at this place was pretty fun. They must have been pretty short staffed the night I came because when I walked in, I had to wait several minutes for someone to come greet and seat me. \n\nMy friends recommended this cocktail they'd had there before that had some kind of lemongrass infused liquor and chili vodka or something, but they said they'd be discontinuing that drink so we were pretty bummed. \n\nWe started with the fresh rolls to start which were fresh and tasty. \n\nFor my main I had the pumpkin and tofu curry with garlic ginger rice. The curry was thick and decadent, but could've had a bit more pumpkin in it. \n\nOne friend ordered the saut\u00e9ed beef with string beans which was super tasty and well seasoned. I would get that again. \n\nMy other friend had the spicy sizzling seafood which was ok but kind of underwhelming. She loved it but I thought the ingredients were not super well incorporated. \n\nTheir dishes also came out about 10 minutes after mine so timing could've been a bit better.

Worth the $18.  5/5\n* Cut Cut Cut :  The other fruit cup cocktail, this one was made with vodka, hibiscus syrup, pineapple and lime juice served in a whole pineapple.  Sadly the pineapple was a bit underripe and the cocktail leaked out onto the plate, but it was still quite good.  4/5\n* Thai sausage with crispy rice salad:  Spicy, salty, sour, tangy:  not quite the LOS version but still very satisfying.  4.5/5\n* Crispy pork green bean:  I can see why this is a polarizing dish -- the pork is somewhat crispy somewhat chewy.  I liked it but wonder if it could be a bit more tender instead of chewy.  Sadly not spicy.  3.5/5\n* Deep fried whole tilapia with chili sauce:  this looked great but the chili sauce made the fish a bit too soggy, plus it wasn't spicy at all!

I'm very glad we did -- I liked it more than the ice cream!\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the decor. The walls are plastered in retro Thai movie posters, and there's a cute sports bar off to the side. I've never been to Thailand, but I imagine it's something a lot like Saap Ver.\n\nThe second thing was the menu. It's just plain vast. Rice dishes, curries, specials, noodles, meat, and more specials line the pages. It took some real focus and determination, but I eventually settled on the spicy red chili beef, while my less-hungry friend grabbed some of the meatballs.\n\nThe balls came out first. The sauce was sweet, with a hint of spicy of tanginess, but the meat itself was underwhelming. Moist, but otherwise unremarkable.\n\nMy beef, though, was lovely. The sauce was a top-notch combo of umami and spicy, and the peppercorns were like little popping boba of flavor. The meat was a liiiiittle tough, though; it would have benefited from a little tenderizing before cooking.\n\nOverall, Saap Ver's got some good flavors going on, but could do with upping their meat quality game a bit. I'd go back to sample something else from the expansive menu, but it's far :(", "author": "Shawn W."}

They don't appeal to the typical American tastes with the excess sweetness or tamarind. Perfectly salty with fish sauce and hits hard on the Thai pepper spice! Just the way I love it. Seriously the best Tom yum in town. I normally get it with tofu which they will add extra veggies in and makes it that much more yummy. Medium spicy is pretty spicy here and I am no stranger to spicy food, I love it. \n\nAll the appetizers I've tried are good. We normally opt for fish cakes or spring/fresh rolls. They also have shrimp egg rolls which are always good if you want to indulge in fried food. Papaya salad is the perfect mix of sour, spicy, salty. \n\nFor entree I always get the same thing: pumpkin tofu curry! Ooh so yummy. Hits the spot when you're craving something hearty.

The moment I entered at around 7PM on a Thursday evening, the bustling space evoked the spirited atmosphere of a Singaporean hawker center with a touch of San Francisco kitsch in the vintage movie magazine covers being used as wallpaper and Christmas drop lights hanging from the ceiling (photo: http://bit.ly/2pcEn2f). The dining profile was young, mostly Asian, and likely working at start-ups nearby judging from the Ben Sherman vibe of their clothing.\n\nI was seated straight away on a lonely banquette table and perused their rather lengthy menu to see what I could get away with for dinner. I also learned the literal translation of Saap Ver was 'Damn Delicious'. OK, fair enough. I started with the $8 Fresh Rolls, purely vegetarian with an extra thin rice paper wrapper and an extra thick peanut sauce. They were stuffed with lettuce, cabbage, cucumber, carrot, vermicelli noodles, and tofu (photo: http://bit.ly/2FQHoPV). Damn, it was delicious though not entirely unique in execution. My main event was the $12 Chicken Ginger Rice, their take on Hainan chicken which I dared to ask if I could have paleo.\n\nThe server asked the chef who refused as he felt the rice was the point of ordering the dish. It was indeed as the plump chicken thigh was resting on top of a large mound of ginger-infused rice with cucumber slices and soy sauce on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/2pioeZd). The poultry was tender and just what I wanted as it was boneless but not skinless. I added a $5 side of Steamed Broccoli in order to make it more paleo, and it worked for the most part since the veg was fresh (photo: http://bit.ly/2HC86t4). But hell, it didn't stop me from devouring the ginger rice much to my nutritional chagrin. Damn, it was delicious and probably worthy of a return visit with Jamie W.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...saap ver!\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...the Southeast Asian party vibe worked for me...surprisingly\nSERVICE - 4 stars...pretty attentive to this solo diner\nTOTAL - 4 stars...nice to find a Hainan chicken worth getting at a real hawker center", "author": "Ed U."}

As we sat and looked at the menus, I marveled at the d\u00e9cor around the room. Neat place.\n\nWe caved into our temptation to order cocktails. Everything just sounded so delicious! I got the \"Damn Good\" cocktail which was just that. Spicy, strong, and damn good. For my entree, I got the roasted duck plate, served over rice with chili vinegar sauce. Would highly recommend. It satisfied a culinary craving I didn't even know I had.\n\nService is fast and efficient here, especially if you're going for a weekday lunch and need to get back to the office.

They have a wide selection of food, but all the food is just meh. \n\nI really couldn't stand how nosy the place was. I really dislike eating at places where you have to yell across the table or even to the person next to you. \n\nDishes were expensive and not large portioned.\nThe customer service was bad. The drinks and dishes eventually come to you, but you may have to wait awhile AND ask a few times if they remembered. I guess the only plus is that there is alot of parking in the area since it is a new developed area of SF, but if you want good thai food, go to Farmhouse Thai, Lers Ros, or Marnee Thai.

I've lost count of how many times I've eaten here since it's affordable and in the neighborhood. The place has a lively and festive feel to it, decorated with colorful banners and posters. There's a bar that offers happy hour specials too. Food gets a 4.5 from me, but my experience overall is negatively impacted by the inattentive and sluggish service (or sometimes lack of). \n\nMost entrees on the menu will run you about $12+ depending on what kind of protein you get, such as tofu, vegetables, chicken, pork etc. The larger and more special dishes are around $25. If you're ordering off the chef's special section make sure to ask how long it'll take. I once had to wait over an hour for the Grilled Salted Whole Tilapia Fish (more like family style entree) and really wish the waiter could have given me a heads up. I've noticed recently that the lunch offering is a smaller portion of an entree and side of rice for $12, and $15 if you add an appetizer.\n\nGenerally you can't go wrong with most options on the menu. They have it all, such as soups, rice dishes, meat dishes, noodles, etc. Portions are large. \n\nI remember not liking the blue river prawn chef special, it was unappetizing and pungent. I'm also not a fan of the pad thai, it's definitely not their best dish surprisingly and a bit too sweet in my opinion. I can vouch for some of my favorites though!\n\nService is consistently not great at this restaurant unfortunately. I recall countless times I've had to flag down waiters for pretty much everything, from ordering food to paying the bill and even getting seated. This tends to happen when the restaurant is not even that busy. At least the food comes out quickly to make up for that. It's kind of a shame though, would feel like if the service was more efficient and customer first, the business would operate faster and more effectively.\n\nMixed Vegetables - Delicious black bean sauce and done pretty well.\n\nChicken & Rice - I remember liking this one a lot. Comes with chicken broth!\n\nYellow Curry - Generous amount of protein, and flavorful curry made from scratch. Lately it's more watery and I recall it being thicker which I'm not a fan of. The flavor keeps me ordering it though.\n\nPad Cashew - Can't remember exact details, but liked this one as well.\n\nChicken Noodle Soup - Delicious broth and super filling!\n\nBeef Noodle Soup - Was recommended by a waiter.

Gets pretty busy in the area, but parking is findable \n\nAtmosphere // Flashy and colorful! Rainbow flags line the ceiling and photos of old fashioned Thai movies/media culture line the walls. This place also has a disco ball. \nMy only issue is that while we were there, the same song played on loop for like 30 minutes, it was \"Closer\" by Chainsmokers. Literally all 3 of my roommates were dying from hearing this song on replay...it was kind of funny. You should have seen us when the song changed, boy it was a party. \n\nService // Honestly it's kind of hard to say if it was great service or not. They took a really long time to come and take our order. Our waiter was super nice and he was funny, but he got one of orders wrong and he didn't check up on us too often. Maybe it was because it was peak dinner hour and they were just really busy....\n\nFood // Overall tasty, but just a few irks...\n-I will note that I was really grateful that they came to refill our water/ would at least come when we called them over. \n-thai iced tea // 3.50 // Personally it was a bit too sweet, but made a nice compliment to the meal\n-choo chee goong nang // 18.00 // blue river prawn, creamy coconut curry, kaffir lime leaf // This was absolutely delicious, flavoring was superb, HOWEVER, I think our shrimp was a bit too underdone for our taste....It didn't have that firm cooked shrimp texture, because I think it was still a bit raw in the center, we should have sent it back to be cooked a bit more, but we already started eating, so we continued (bad decision on our part, not the restaurant)..luckily my bf and I didn't get sick.\n-Pad see ew beef // 12.00 // flat noodle, chinese broccoli, egg, soy sauce, and beef // Pretty tasty pad see ew but nothing crazy. Granted the price is decent for this dish and in line with all the other places I've been to. \n-Ginger garlic rice // 3.00 // This was REALLY good! Went well with our curry and had excellent flavoring, definitely worth the extra dollar. \n\nOverall, I think the flavoring is very authentic and maybe if our shrimp was cooked and they were a bit more attentive (faster service/ didn't mess up our order), this place would have been  5 stars for me.", "author": "Emily T."}

And I'm not talking about the watered down curries and pad thais that every other Thai restaurant serves in this city.

And Saap Ver has that down to a tee. \n\nDecor - reminder of all the fun, street style of Thailand (without the dirty street feels)\n\nWait staff - first visit really disappointed me. My friend had to apologize to me several times saying she'd never seen the restaurant that busy before. Our waitress didn't bring us our menus for a while. Or water. And forgot the main dish we order...the salted fish, which takes a bit longer to make. To be fair, they were catering a 20+ bday party, plus everyone else that night. It did seem busier than usual. \nWhich is why I decided to give them a second chance. The second visit was the best! The waitress was attentive, informative, and extremely friendly. The restaurant was also a lot less busy that night. \n\nFood - the star of the show!

Saap Ver has more of a lively bar vibe that was reminiscent of the nightlife in Thailand. Retro decor. Casual, energetic ambiance.\n\nThe menu is very extensive here, like most Thai restaurants, and can be a little overwhelming. Unlike other Thai places I've been to, they have some more regional dishes that I don't normally see on menus like khao kha moo (five spices pork leg). The prices are very reasonable here, especially given it's SF, and they don't skimp on portion sizes to compensate. \n\nWe ordered 4 dishes between the 3 of us and it was more than plenty. I found the more \"American\" dishes like pad thai and curry to be disappointing while the less commonly ordered som tom and BBQ chicken tasted more authentic in flavor. I'd come back to try more of their regional dishes!\n\n* SOM TOM GRILLED PRAWNS ($13) - 4.5/5\n[green papaya salad, chili, cherry tomato, green bean, ground peanut, grilled prawn, fish sauce]\nVery well balanced papaya salad! Spicy, acidic, salty and sweet - just like in Thailand. My only disappointment was that there was literally just one grilled prawn, sliced into two halves.\n\n* BBQ CHICKEN ($12) - 4/5\n[thai style bbq chicken with sweet chili sauce]\nSolid. Came with 4 large pieces of chicken - 2 drumsticks and 1 thigh cut into 2 pieces - served with a sweet chili dipping sauce as well as a salty/fish chili dipping sauce. The meat wasn't the best I've had in texture and was a little dry at spots, but the skin was crispy and it was a generous portion for the price.\n\n* PAD THAI HOR KAI ($16) - 3/5\n[egg wrap pad thai - pan-fried rice noodle, prawn, peanut, bean sprouts]\nDisappointing. I had this in Bangkok and haven't seen it anywhere in SF except Saap Ver, so I was eager to try it. I honestly wasn't expecting it to be anything like the one I had in Bangkok, but their pad thai really fell short. The noodles were too chewy and stuck together in clumps, and the flavor was too sweet.\n\n* YELLOW CURRY WITH BEEF ($12) - 3/5\n[curry powder, turmeric, coconut milk, potato, carrot, yellow onion]\nStandard curry flavor. We got ours medium spicy but it tasted very mild to me. The potato, carrots and onion were tender soft, but the texture of the beef was tough and chewy. Felt like cheap cuts, but at least they were pretty generous with the amount of it. Maybe go with a different protein, but nothing special about the curry itself.", "author": "Jessie L."}

That said, we received fair warning about the less than stellar service. On a Saturday evening around 6:30, the restaurant was fairly busy. It was definitely a party atmosphere with karaoke and singer songwriter group, not to mention the Hornitas girls walking around offering free shots. We were sat right away, but a server did not come to our table until ten to fifteen minutes after we had already decided on our order.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the som tum with grilled prawns and the steamed chicken with ginger rice. The chicken dish came out first. The chicken was plated messily and there was a piece that was too rare for our comfort. The sauce that this dish comes with is spicy and delicious, however. My previous experience with kao mun gai (sp?) is with a delicously oily and shiny rice. This rice was not like that, but served its purpose. My friend and I were starved, so we polished this off.\n\nThen, we waited. And waited for the som tum. We were reassured it was coming, but we had to ask a couple times for the dish's status update. When it finally came, I was disappointed to see that there were only two prawns on the plate and even more so when I bit into the one I dished up. It was pretty soft and I actually questioned if it was cooked all the way through. Asides from this though, the flavors were good and the medium spiciness we asked for was quite spicy.\n\nAsides from the initial lapse in attention from our server, the service from pretty much everyone else in the restaurant was pretty good. But all in all, Saap Ver is pretty close to greatness, but not quite there with seamless service, entree timing, and cook temps. Solid option for Thai if you are in the area though if you care to take the risk!", "author": "Jung-In S."}

I ordered two things here, some grilled pork shoulder and crab fried rice. The crab fried rice had disappointingly little crab and little crab flavor to it (compared to say Farmhouse Thai). The grilled pork shoulder tasted good, but very little was provided. The pork came with a tasty sauce, however, as I poured it out I noticed a strange lump. When prodding this lump, it popped and revealed itself to be a mass of undissolved/unmixed rice powder (see photos).

Their service can be slow because they lack bussers and runners...but they comped some thai iced teas for us which made up for it.  Everyone smiles and are very friendly. \n\nThis is what we recommend so far: Thai sausage crispy rice salad, Spicy TomYum noodle soup (I can literally get a bowl just for myself - it's that good), whole fish dish (any), Thai style BBQ chicken, durian sticky rice.\n\nDishes you can skip: Crying Tyger (nothing special, really) and the pad thai. \n\nQuick tip: Make a reservation during peak eating times.

It almost always disappoints, with a few memorable exceptions: Sabuy Sabuy II on San Pablo in Berkeley and Ruen Thai in Roseville. My idea of hot is nose running, throat closing, night sweats--you get the picture, a general week-long burn. At Sabuy Sabuy II (which used to be called something else, was it Plearn?), I insisted on Thai hot and the server rolled her eyes all the way back to Thailand. I'm all, bring it. The burn was incredibly fierce--like stop on the way home to get milk to drink immediately-fierce, almost inedible. You know how I likes it. Ruen Thai is less inedibly hot, but still well seasoned. \n\nSV is my neighborhood Thai spot, I practically live on top of the place. It's the sort of unsuspecting strip mall restaurant that you relish finding - the proverbial hole in the wall--the third Thai restaurant I've found that knows how to do stupid hot. A diamond in the rough. \n\nI think SV is the best Thai food in San Francisco, bar none. Of course, like everything, that's relative. I hate to complain, but this city's Thai offerings underwhelm. The east bay's Thai selection is sooo much better. And Sacramento kicks the east bay's ass. I've actually been to an incredible place in Modesto? I digress.\n\nOne night I ordered Pad Thai on the Yelp app for pickup, Thai hot, no bean sprouts, add tofu, add beef: a joyful carbo-load. Yes, I know that Pad Thai is the spaghetti of Thai food, but hear me out. This dish is a good barometer for measuring the tastiness of  your Thai. It's like vanilla ice cream, I'm most impressed when that is done well, and it's almost never done well anywhere. The Pad Thai at SV was the best I've had anywhere, ever, period. And it was soooo hot without compromising the other flavors of the dish. \n\nI've had a good portion of the menu by now, naturally. My favorites include the red curry, Pad-khee-mao, Pad-see-ew, Pad-see-you? I've not had anything bad here, everything is delicious and authentic. The one time I've dined in with my sister, no one spoke English. The bar is very interesting. I like to people watch there. The service is great and super fast. \n\nVery special.

I started at mild and am now working my way up to hot!

Green chili dip was mushy, bland, and one dimensional. Way overpriced for $25. \n\n*Coconut Ice Cream ($7): Cloying sweet; tasted like pi\u00f1a colada (pineapple chucks).\n\nWhile the staff was cordial, they were very green. Our poor server wasn't familiar with the menu (who would be at 100+ items!) and had to confirm our order three separate times. I don't expect stellar service at Asian restaurants but I expected some follow-up since we were paying auto-gratuity for a large group and prices are higher than the standard Thai restaurant. No one checked on us to see how the food was and we had to constantly flag someone down when we needed something. We asked for hot sauce for the table and they gave us a small communal rack of hot sauces. They later asked to take it away when we were STILL using it. That's like having one set of ketchup and mustard bottles at a diner! \n\nAt the end of dinner, the staff brought the birthday boy coconut ice cream with a candle in it and sang happy birthday for him. What a nice gesture I thought until...I saw they charged us $7 for it. The phuck? \n\nI rarely take pics of receipts but I did so in this case so I can refer to it when writing a review. When I was looking back at the receipt last night to remind me of the dishes we ordered, I noticed that they charged us 11.9% for tax: http://bit.ly/1UfxRmS?! If the \"Healthy SF Tax\" is included, that should be listed as a separate line item charge. \n\nSaap Ver doesn't hold a candle to Lers Ros (original TL location) and Kin Khao. I question the authenticity of many of the glowing 5 star reviews especially when they choose Saap Ver to be their first restaurant to review. Ever.\n\nBut who cares about what I think. \n\nWhat did birthday boy who's a professional chef and trained in Thailand for Muay Thai think about the food at Saap Ver? \n\n\"It was authentic but ehh...it was ok\", he said. \n\nBut he thought the bartender was hawt. Now, if she sang Happy Birthday, Marilyn Monroe style to him, the $7 charge would have been worth it!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I thought it was new ownership from the last Thai establishment in the same spot because of the different styling of the restaurant, new waiters/waitresses, and a slightly different style of food. But the expensive menu and lingering service issues make me wonder if some of Grand Pu Bah is still here.\n\nHave eaten here twice since they've opened and had poor dining experiences overall both times. The first time, it took a long time for the wait staff to take our order, and then when it came out, they were delivered so far apart that we had to have that awkward conversation of \"no, please go ahead and eat, your food will get cold.\" The first and last dish were delivered at least 15 minutes apart, which is ridiculous when you're trying to share a meal with some one. I also asked for medium spice level and it was scalding my mouth, and usually I order hot at restaurants but just wasn't in the mood this day. The spice inconsistency was an issue at Grand Pu Bah as well.\n\nThe second time was even worse. One of our table members ordered a soup which came in this large circular steel epic presentation, but then she had to stare at it for 15 minutes before even the second of our six dishes came out. When they all finally came out, we were trying to get a bowl and spoon for her to eat the soup out of, and that took multiple requests, when finally I just got up and went and found spoons and bowls, and silverware for the table. I felt bad for the waitstaff because they were running around like crazy, so it's probably a new restaurant/understaffed problem. \n\nReally bad experience here, and will not return. Food is decent, but the service situation was so bad both times that it pretty much negates any potentially redeeming qualities.", "author": "Sarah B."}

The restaurant shows Thai movies in the evening and has Thai themed movie art work on the wall. The focus of this restaurant is Thai street food so don't expect to see a large menu. I've been to this restaurant twice and would say the my experience was between a 3 and 4. I really liked the Kra Pow Gai as it was very flavorful, maybe could have used a bit more spice, but had the right texture, ingredients, and consistency. As for the Som Tum Set, the chicken BBQ was not my favorite. The texture of the chicken was fine, but in my opinion there wasn't a lot of meat on the chicken wings. I spent the majority of my meal trying to figure out how to get the small pieces of meat off the wing. This dish comes with a papaya salad which was intended to be the appetizer, but was the highlight of the dish for me. It was flavorful, had a nice tangy kick and had little shrimp in the dish. My husband and I were both impressed with this salad and wished it was a stand alone menu item. Another item I've tried at this restaurant is the cabbage the dish. The cabbage had the perfect texture after being cooked in the wok and had a nice garlicky flavor. \n\nThe service at this establishment was decent. The first time I came it was impressive, but the second time I am visited it was slow and they accidentally switched our bill with another patrons.

I went on a Monday evening around 7 PM, and the place was lively (especially because Game 5 of the NBA Finals was happening) but there were plenty of tables open so we were seated immediately.\n\nI got the Pad See Ew with beef. The portions were very large, but the meat was a bit overcooked and tough. In my experience, pad see ew tends to be on the sweet side, but their version had some interesting spiciness going on, with some hints of ginger and pepper. Overall, a decent dish.\n\nThe service was very nice, but the food was slow to come out. At $12 pre-tax for the pad see ew, it's a little on the pricey side for Thai. This is the first Thai place I've in SF, so I don't have much to compare it to, but it doesn't quite match up to my favorite spot in NYC.

I was totally expecting some quiet, sterile Asian place with few customers and mostly delivery orders.  Instead, what I found was a  facility where considerable thought went into the whimsical decor and a festive mood.  Unfortunately, the service left much to be desired.  Not only did the food come out incredibly slowly, but our waitress was way too hurried about her job.  Instead f taking time to ask if we needed anything each time she came by, she would come take plates away or set them down and within milliseconds run off again.  The food was decent, but not decent enough to wait so long to get it.", "author": "Ash T."}

Decent option if you prefer extra crisp wings.\n* Crying tiger - was cooked really tender and flavorful, but seemed a bit spendy compared to the other dishes\n* Crab fried rice - ok dish, not a ton of crab but enough to impart flavor\n* Basil chicken - meh, not very basilly, so it missed on the premise\n\nWhile they were pretty busy on a Saturday night (there were multiple rowdy birthday groups), there were lengthy gaps where we were left looking for staff to no avail.

While the space has a cool vibe, the thai food is average to good, small portioned (relative to other Thai places). On top of that, the service was awful all three times we've been there -- where we had to stand at the front for a *long* time to get seated, then another 20 minutes for a server to come, then another 20+ minutes for the food to arrive, which arrived lukewarm. And during the meals couldn't get the server's attention during the meal for drinks, etc. *And* then the last time we were there, they were extremely rude to us after we paid the bill -- we're guessing for *only* tipping 24% on the pre-tax amount (the suggested amounts on the check were post-tax, and started at 18%....).  We tried to eat here a 4th time (it's the only Thai in our area so...) and they ignored us completely as we stood at the front -- even went up to a server and they said \"yes\" we'll be right with you, just sit down\" -- and no one came to serve us (20+ minutes) and then it was closing time....they *never* came to even check on us -- just ignored us so we would leave.

Some dark colored noodles were great, seafood fried rice was great. The rib eye dish was my favorite for sure. I would totally go back if I'm ever in the area again.

Sure enough they have three or four kinds of som tum, which is rare at sit down restaurants but common if you're really making it fresh. Without hesitation I ordered the salted crab version, which is super pungent from the fish sauce and the fermented crab legs. Yes, they are black. Yes, they make the dish that much more delicious.

An hour and a half after we had ordered the food it finally gets to us, and it's completely the wrong meals. The receipt on the outside of the bag was correct so this was a mistake made by the restaurant. I called the restaurant and the guy on the line tried to immediately blame it on the Uber driver. Afterwards he said well, there's nothing I can do you have to contact Uber. The food we got was much less, super basic, and contained shrimp which I'm allergic too. So not only did they mess up, they didn't apologize and they didn't find any way to fix their mistake. To top it off, the little food I could eat was horrible. The soup tasted like it was made from dirty dish water.", "author": "Nadja K."}

Not sure if it's the same owners and they just rebranded, but the service is about the same. Slow. There were maybe 3-4 tables total and our food took more than 40 minutes to come out. \n\nThe food wasn't very good either but maybe we didn't order the right things. We ordered from their \"happy hour\" menu - thought it'd be a good deal for $5/plate: chicken wings and fish cakes. The wings are not your typical wings! Imagine your normal wings cut in half. There were maybe 2 of those (so one wing total?) and then maybe 4 pieces of that sharp part that usually gets chopped off (cartilage? No meat on it). So all-in-all, maybe about 2.5-3 wings worth of meat. No significant flavor. Just fried, salt and pepper. Blah. Fish cake was decent, good flavor mix, but think it was store-bought. Blah. We also went for the Pad Thai, a good dish to test for comparison of other Thai restaurants. The shrimp was way overcooked and the noodles were as chewy as rubber bands. Blah. \n\nEnded up being less than $25 but it was totally unsatisfying. I think I'll give this one more chance since the other reviews made it sound so incredible.

Ambience is cute, vintage, large big screen to watch sports games on, and parking is ample. Only negative on the physical space is that at the end of the night, they dimmed the room and I literally had to turn my iPhone flashlight on to see the food on my plate and finish out the meal.\n\nStaff is really friendly and regardless of who your server is, if you catch anyone's attention, they will stop and assist you. The first time I went, the food service took incredibly long, twenty five minutes for the first app to arrive to table on a fairly slow night was frustrating. However, the food came fairly quickly on our second experience, so I was glad to see them work those service kinks out. \n\nOn each occasion, I have been surprised at the flavors and layers of the delicious food, just a few hiccups on service and on a couple dishes that could make this place truly great. On my first experience, we ordered the pad Thai, crispy pork belly with basil, chicken satay, and tom kha. The pad thai was flavorful with just the right amount of sweet with the flavor of tamarind and savoriness. Ample shrimp and a surprising addition of a soft thin but fluffy omelet that covered the top. Almost like a Japanese omurice, but filled with pad thai instead! The tom kha was hands down the best tom kha I've ever had. Again, all flavors really well balanced with creamy coconut milk, spice, sweet, savory, and sour. I could not get enough. The only misstep with the soup is that they utilized random hacked chunks of chicken, which were hard to eat the meat off of, and left little shards of bone to pick out of every other spoonful. I imagine they have less waste and it may be more authentic to Thailand, as they are butchering the whole chicken versus utilizing the breast or drumsticks alone, however the velvety mouth feel of the soup was tainted by the shards of bone.  It was the equivalent of getting sand in your oyster or egg shell in your omelet. No matter how delicious it tastes, that one mistep can ruin the dish. Pork belly was decent, crispy skin, a few pieces were dry but the spicy soy and basil sauce made up for it. However on my second trip the pork belly was terrible. The skin was not crispy but so hard and chewy I had to spit it out, and the meat itself was terribly dry and fiberous. We asked the server to take this plate away, and she easily obliged. The winners of night were the pork neck salad and green curry filled with chicken and Thai eggplant. The pork neck salad is similar to the dish served at Ler Ros, however the lime and Thai chili sauce coats the luscious fatty pork neck and is covered with mint, Thai basil, and green onions, while the sauce is served on the side at Lers Ros. Both different, but equally delicious. A hands down favorite of mine.", "author": "jessica c."}

I was a big fan of Gran Pu Bah ( previous place) and thought to give it a try. \n\nWell, things did not turned has planned. The food was absolutely infect! \nFirst of all, the menu was small and did not offer much choices. They have a big kitchen so I am not sure why they decided to make such a small menu. So I ordered an appetizer, which was tasteless and horribly fried. Then ordered the tom ka gai soup. It is usually my ultimate favorite and you can tell if the place is authentic. Well what I found inside made me want to vomit... The chicken pieces were chopped with bones and nerves. Obviously impossible to eat. It was looking disgusting and thought to myself what kind of chef would serve a soup like that! I was even afraid to try the soup itself without the chicken thinking that it could get me food poisoning. So I threw it away. Spent $12 for nothing. \nThen got the chicken basil dish with the fried egg. Tasted mediocre, greasy. They grinned the chicken so you are not even sure what you are really eating....\n\nI usually don't leave bad review but the food there is not good. \n\nIn my opinion, this is just a place where you can get a good drink, that's all.", "author": "Laetitia V."}

We came in and no one came to seat us so we asked if we could sit and we're told it was cash only. The waiter had a difficult time understanding us the entire time. Their internet had gone out so it was cash only, we we went across the street to pull cash from an ATM. No one saw us to sit us down so we sat ourselves down. My friend was asking if the curry was part of the combo and the waiter didn't understand. Then she asked what the soup of the day was and it's just a clear broth with carrots about 1/2 cup. We got the entree, soup, and appetizer combo. Our appetizers came out and they are tiny. The fresh spring roll is 1/2 a roll. Tasty but small. Then our entrees came out but they had forgotten our soups so those came out after we asked for them. The soup is an extra $3 and not worth it for the size. Just save your money and order 2 entrees instead of the combo.", "author": "Crys L."}

We started with Deep-fried salted chicken \"wings\".  I use quotes because the meat had been cut away leaving a single bone deep-fried with minimal meat or taste.  Our other appetizer was fresh spring rolls about which one of my friends said they were they lamest he'd ever had.    The best entree was basic noodles with chicken which was flavorful but no better than a food truck.   The eggplant dish consisted of crunchy carrots and a small round green vegetable which had the taste & appearance of an uncooked green tomatillo, but they claimed was some eggplant.   Drowned in spicy red sauce, there was no flavor but spiciness.    The pork rice dish was a small amount of plain roast pork on white rice -- as boring as it sounds.    That was it.   The food arrival was shockingly slow and the service also sucked but no need to elaborate on that.   But hey - parking is easy.", "author": "James W."}

We have been to this location many times before it became Saap Ver and the same issues seem to be recurring regardless of name and ownership, the service is atrocious and the food is not worth the wait.\n\nWe came on a Saturday night when you would think ownership would staff up.  Instead, the front of the house was complete chaos with only about 80% of the tables seated.\n\nWait staff had no clue who had which tables.  We were greeted and greeted again but with no follow up.  I watched another table order and wait about 20 minutes for their food to arrive.  Another gentleman had to go to the waitress and alert her that their table was ready to order.\nThe owner had to run back into the kitchen to help the cook.  The bartender had to come out and clean tables and take orders.  Sad to say this is why we never went back to the previous restaurant at this location.  \n\nThis place is a great space but the front of the house requires a lot of work.\n\nThe back of the house could use some help as well.  We wanted to order items we have not seen on other menus.  Boy, was that a mistake.\n\nWe ordered the fried tofu and meatballs.  Eating the fried tofu was like eating cardboard.  What it should be is crispy on the outside and soft and silky on the inside.  No texture except for the hard fried outer crust.\n\nThe meatballs were packaged meatballs.  I am willing to bet a meal that this is the case.  Ownership, please prove me wrong.  If you do, change the flavor makeup of these meatballs because the sauce you use cannot make up for the blandness of the meatball itself.\n\nWe ordered the steak, a chicken curry and the fried chicken rice plate.  All were basic and completely standard fare.  \n\nMaybe we ordered the wrong items.  But I'm not willing to go back.  Sorry.", "author": "C C."}
