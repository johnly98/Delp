I've tried other places in SF for burritos but this is definitely the most tasty for me! I have never been more confident in giving a 5 star. \n\nBurritos: meat so fresh and juicy, perfect slightly crunchy wrap, avocado freshly scooped (you'll see them making it for you), sour cream to complement the taste\n\nQuesadilla: cheesy so good that the cheese stretches with your bite, steak inside the quesadilla is a literal strip of deliciousness. \n\nWe also get the chips on the side while waiting for our order. \n\nService: despite having so many customers they're willing to make special adjustments for us like putting any sauces on the side. There is water and plenty of napkins available. The food is also brought to you if you dine in! \n\nThe restaurant has a nice vibe, sometimes with musicians walking up and down the aisles.

Got the super carne asada quesadilla and HOLY CRAP it was AMAZING. On the contrary, everything I've tried at Taqueria was really bland and unseasoned. I paid around nine dollars for my supersized quesadilla which is on the expensive end, but it was so huge and filling (and delicious) that it was totally worth it. The meat was super tender and well seasoned. Had a touch of heat and generous amount of flavor. Quesadilla was lightly toasted and crisp. Try all the sauces at the bar for multiple flavor combinations! I'm writing this review a couple of days after and I'm honestly salivating. \n\nSome cons: \nMy quesadilla was cut into halves and stacked. By the time I finished the first half, the bottom half was soaked in grease / sauces. The quesadilla wasn't crisp anymore and it was too soggy to pick up, so I had to go grab a fork. On that note, it's EXTREMELY greasy. I could feel a coat of oil on my throat after I finished eating. But hey, if you're going to indulge in an amazing quesadilla, it better be greasy as hell :) Seating was also very dirty, limited, and crowded. Five stars for the food, one star for hygiene.", "author": "Shirley C."}

The lengua was my favorite and was super tender. The carne asada was a bit dry and flavorless. And the al pastor was pretty traditional in it seasoning. They give a good amount of onions and cilantro but the sauces are pretty mediocre. \n\nOverall the tacos are good, but not worth the price at all. At this place I would say the burritos are the way to go. They're filling but will cost you less than 3 tacos. I also really enjoyed the horchata here. A little too sweet but tasted on point. \n\nThe wait sometimes might look intimidating but the line moves pretty fast.

The al pastor super quesadilla (super suiza) was really good, but I felt like there was just more flavor in the burrito.

To be honest I didn't have high hopes for this place but the anticipation of waiting in line really made it that much more enjoyable. It's a hole in the wall, and it's dingy. Not much seating is had here but those are the kind of places that whet my pallet. I went with a friend and we split the super burrito with carne. This thing was packed with all sorts of goodness. The meat itself wasn't mind blowing and to be honest it was just okay; didn't seem to have much seasoning to it. But mixed with the piping hot beans and rice really helped to bring out the subtleties of the meat. I loaded my half with a ton of salsa and went to town. The salsa had jalape\u00f1o in it so there was some heat going along with everything else. I would definitely eat there again and see what the other meats taste like.", "author": "John C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-11", "description": "El Farolito is located in the Mission on Mission by 24th St and Bart. There is no parking lot but plenty of metered street parking in the area. \n\nThis is CASH ONLY. Limited and tight seating inside. There's a few tables along the wall by the front entrance but more towards the back. The interior is narrow and can get cramped. There is a limited salsa bar with Medium, Mild and Hot Sauces with to go containers at the end of the register area. \n\nIf you order burritos there are 3 tortilla options of flour, wheat, or spinach. I usually get the Pollo Asado Super Burrito (Rice, Beans, Cheese, Sour Cream, Guacamole, Salsa and Cilantro). If you don't pick any particular beans they will give you regular whole beans. The Burritos are pretty big. All items in the burrito are evenly distributed and they are not skimpy with the meat unlike other spots. What sticks out about El Farolitos too is that oppose to Guacamole they actually put slices of Avocados in the Super Burritos. All items in the burrito were fresh and tasty. The interior was not soaked and wet or mushy. Another go to item is their Quesadilla Suiza (Cheese & Steak). Can't go wrong with either choice.\n\nThere is usually a line but don't let the line detour you. The line moves along and they are efficient and fast. During peak hours during the week dinner time might wait 10-15 minutes for your one item order or just call in your order to go to avoid the wait. Make sure to hang on to your ticket order and listen for your number to be called then pick up the order by the cash register.\n\nI definitely recommend El Farlito if you're in the area looking for a good burrito or quesadilla. This is my go to spot whenever I am in the area. Easily one of my favorite burrito spots in San Francisco.\n\nEl Farlito does have other locations in San Francisco and around the Bay Area in case you cannot make it to this location.", "author": "Paul V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-15", "description": "I had the chance to try El Farolito after several friends recommended it to me as a MUST while visiting the Mission District in SF. The neighborhood and subsequently the city is known for it's rich history of Mexican cuisine dating back all the way to the Mexican-American war. This specific area of SF is known for the different restaurants that serve up the classics (i.e. burritos, quesadillas, etc.). However, El Farolito is apparently is THE PLACE for amazing Mexican cuisine in the Bay Area so I know I had to try it.\n\nWe walked in around 5:30 on a Thursday evening. The second we walked in their was already a line the length of the ordering station to the front door (about 6 people). My friend stayed in line while I scoped out a table where we'd be able to sit.\n\nThe restaurant itself isn't decorated in any special way. Kind of a hole in the wall spot that has a ton of people working within an open kitchen, others taking and yelling out order numbers, and customers coming and going  to either dine in or to take out. When it came time to choose I went with the Super Burrito with chicken ($8.25). Stuffed with rice, beans, salsa, avocado, and a host of other ingredients this burrito really packed  a punch. It's definitely recommended if you're really hungry and looking for something that won't only leave you satisfied, but may actually have you needing to take a nap after finishing.\n\nBecause of the high volume of people going in and out at any given time I completely understand the rush they have with their service. Not saying it was bad in any sense, but when you order is called they literally fast-walk it to your table, placed it down, and then go back to deliver the next order in the queue. I actually like this though because it means that they're efficient. They don't waste time bringing you your delicious meal.\n\nJust so you know this location is a cash only spot. They're also open super late from what I've heard so if you're visiting the Mission District it seems like a good option after a long night out.\n\nVisit if you get the chance and I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Nicholas C."}

After that I mentally had it bookmarked  and thought I should check this place out one day! Years passed and never went until I realized it's actually quite close to a club that I frequent. Once this connection was made my mind was blown and I immediately went to go check this place out after a night of dancing.\n\nWe got there around 2am and there was a line. Some in the line were drunk (expected, given the time) and some were arguing with each other (I guess, also expected given the time) but I think deep down we were all excited to get our eats on!\n\nThis place definitely lives up to its hype. Everything we had was delicious! (And I've been back several times since, and everything I order is still always delicious). The burrito is good, nice chunky meat, good ratio of sauce, and it has a nice kick to it. But my favorite thing here are the nachos or their flautas because I LOVE flautas to begin with and the nachos are more fun to eat with a group. So, really, just go and order whatever you're in the mood for at the time because the quality of ingredients they use is the same regardless of what you order and they know how to give their food flavor!\n\nAaannddd I have made myself hungry just thinking and writing about the food here...strongly recommend checking this place out, if you haven't already!", "author": "Taline M."}

However, I was accepting of the order because I special orders my tacos to be \"super\" style even though it wasn't on the menu. When the price came to $25 I asked if that was right and he said yes, because my tacos are \"super\" that is why there is an extra up-charge. When I came home  I realized that the tacos are have actually been prepared as regular style and not super as I requested. I been trying to contact them all night and they won't answer their phone. I'm really frustrated because I paid for the speciality tacos and he assured me that they would be super. The crunchy tacos are hard and dry and the meat lacks lots of flavor. I am disappointed in this establishment being that this is suppose to be he best and most authentic Mexican spot in San Francisco. The staff was rude and the food is not good at all. They need to pay attention to the customer and the customers specific order instead of rushing people out of the line. I will not be going back.", "author": "Nick Y."}

But alas, we not only have some of the best taco places I have eaten in my fair city, but I have tried my fair share of Mexican eateries all throughout Texas. I have even dabbled in a few places randomly found on Yelp in the bay area. Granted the local (Alabama) burrito scene is not quite like I have had in SF. But I do know a good burrito. Unfortunately, poor decision making led me to not even select a burrito. A mistake I will remedy in the future. This trip however was late night and led by a culinary encyclopedia of a co-worker.\n\nWe arrived with a line out the door as to be expected. But the line moved pretty fast. I fully expected to get a burrito and a beer. But apparently the beer is not an option at this hour. It threw me into a tailspin. Then I saw a quesadilla come out that was the size of Rhode Island, my co-worker also ordered one, and I could feel the eyes behind me. In a haste, I ordered the quesadilla with my co-worker having the foresight of a need for burrito in the future. Again with unfortunate circumstance, there is no way to eat one of these desert sized tortilla deliciousness and even half a burrito... at least at 2 AM. The quesadilla itself was fantastic. Had I known it had sour cream, I probably would have held off. But overall it was extremely tasty. As we were finishing up, we were asked to leave by some form of officer because of closing time. Not sure if it was a real cop (it was 2:30 AM after all - my senses weren't the keenest) but they were a little pushy. Which I do understand with a 2:30 AM closing times. I'm sure the story these walls could tell. I look forward to going back and eating the burrito in my next visit. For now, the whole experience is four stars.", "author": "Will B."}

It's pretty small inside too and can get cramped when the lines build up but if you go to the back, there are booths to sit in.\n\nI ordered 2 tacos, one lengua and I swear I said al pastor but I got a carne asada taco instead. The carne asada one was alright but the lengua one was so good omg. I haven't had a solid lengua taco in a long time.\n\nMy friend ordered quesadilla for dos and the guy taking our order was like \"thats for 2 people are you sure?\" and he said yeah but when the order came out, he realized it was a huge mistake because their quesadillas are HUGE and now there were TWO giant quesadillas on our table. He ended up only finishing one and it was pretty entertaining watching him try to finish just one quesadilla. That thing is massive.\n\nOverall this place is pretty good.

After class, I had some time so I decided today is the day. There was already a line at the door so it gave me time to decide on what to order. They have a variety of meat to choose from carnitas to beef tongue. I ordered the steak super burrito with everything. They have a salsa bar so you can choose from whatever you want. I got the green one which was surprisingly spicy for me but tasted delicious with the burrito. There are few seats to choose from and the tacqueria is small. The steak was crunchy and very good compared to other tacquerias but overall I thought this place was ok, nothing amazing. I would come here again to try other items like the super quesodilla.", "author": "Ivy M."}

But...something was missing. \nVisit 2: Super Al Pastor Burrito on Wheat, no sour cream, black beans, and grilled. Oh...My...God....this thing was AMAZING! The marinated pork was so juicy and tender.....flavor explosions with every bite!\nVisit 2: Super Al Pastor AND SHRIMP Burrito on Wheat, No sour Cream, black beans, and grilled. Wow....just WOW. This thing was incredible. There were about 10 giant, perfectly cooked grilled shrimp IN MY BURRITO! Mixed with the Al Pastor...this thing was a homerun.

El Farolito is located a short walk from the 24th St BART for those rocking the car-free or car-light lifestyle.\n\nThe best option for vegans here is the Regular Veggie Burrito. It is $6.75 & comes w/ lettuce, rice, beans, avocado, & salsa. Make sure to request it w/o cheese to have it vegan as it comes by default w/ cheese even though it isn't listed on the menu as that.\n\nChips are an extra 65 cents. While other taquerias in the Mission offer complimentary chips the fee is minimal, plus avocado is giving free on the burrito w/o additional charge.\n\nThere is a three item salsa bar including 2 red salsa, 1 green salsa, & pickled veggies. The salsa is on the spicy side. The roasted chili pepper on the salsa bar packs some heat.\n\nIt was a very filling burrito & although I finished it, I almost didn't. This is probably the most filling veggie burrito in the Mission. It is a bit heavy on rice & feel that El Farolito is doing the opposite of La Taqueria's famous no rice burrito. La Taqueria is nearby & famously does no rice to pack more meat into their burritos which does nothing for this vegan so perhaps La Taqueria is giving El Farolito all their rice as El Farolito's burrito is a bit heavy on the rice which I don't necessarily mind. \n\nThis place gets quite packed yet was here for an early dinner just after 5pm so wasn't any problem to find a seat yet be prepared to share a table & lines can get long.", "author": "Shane S."}

The line went by relatively quickly, as the staff were swift and diligent. Tables and seats are limited, so there is a chance that you might have to take orders to-go.\n\nFor our late-night grub, we ordered a Carne Asada and Carnitas Taco, a Regular Burrito and Grilled Onions. The Carnitas Taco was my favorite, the deep fried pork was crispy, hot and fresh, laying on a bed of fresh onions and cilantro. El Farolito is very generous with the portions, not holding back on packing the taco and burrito with ingredients. The Regular Burrito includes rice, beans, salsa, onions, cilantro and meat, but I would say 90% of the burrito was rice and beans, makes for one heck of a meal....or pillow. We chose a table right next to the salsa bar, making it easy access to the delicious salsa verde. \n\nWe enjoyed our late-night experience at El Farolito, a melting pot of diversity and unique patrons that make San Fran so amazingly interesting and vibrant.

There were a lot more avocados and lettuce in it although most of the burrito consisted of rice and beans. I think the lettuce that was used was romaine and it was super crunchy. I liked how avocados were used instead of guacamole. The cheese was melted along the edges of the wrap and had a better quality than the cheaper shredded cheese that you may find in a burrito at Taco Bell. The wrap was very warm. I was glad that the employees did not squish the beans. I feel like this would make the burrito more soupy. The whole burrito was not very saucy. I could actually taste each individual ingredient. I could not finish the whole burrito. \n\nMy friend really enjoyed his nachos. He says that he gets it every time he comes here.\n\nI will say that there is a lot of cross contamination.

I've literally never seen a larger quesadilla in my life (two ginormous plates) and it's currently going for like $13, I can't believe it That could legit feed a family and is a great choice, post drinking shenanerdoodles and all! Tacos are flavorful and I'm currently on a quest to find the best lengua tacos. I would say the meat on the tacos are hefty and delicious (but be warned, the sauce they put on the lengua is just a bit spicy so if you're not into that, maybe you can ask for sauce on the side or not at all, or suck it up because the meat is so yummy!).  \n\nThis place is CASH ONLY so make sure you bring money or have venmo to pay your drunk friends back!

I was recommended to this place with the claim that they had the best burritos so I ordered my go to: an al pastor super burrito. Hands down one of the best burritos I've had!\n\nMeat: Al pastor was well marinated and tender. Some places don't seem to get this choice of protein right, but El Farolito does.\n\nRice: Cooked just right and has nice flavor. This ingredient can make or break a burrito for me.\n\nTortilla: El Farolito can wrap a burrito pretty well. One of my pet peeves in a burrito is a chunk of wrap in every bite. I can understand the ends being folded but I'm not too forgiving in the middle. I also prefer the tortilla to be soft and thin so it doesn't over power the other flavors. This burrito was great!\n\nRatios: They make well balanced burritos. Every bite was bursting with flavor.\n\nThey did not disappoint! Only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the salsa. I appreciate when a taqueria can showcase a special sauce but this place was pretty standard. Aside from that, I highly recommend this place!", "author": "Jeremy L."}

It is also CASH only. \nGreen salsa is to die for -- not too spicy, but just enough of a kick to it. I've tried the burrito, steak tacos, quesadilla, and chips. The quesadilla was a huge portion, but it had a little bit too much cheese and sour cream for my liking (but was still very tasty). The burrito was a great option for something filling and a taste of everything if you wanted the whole rice, beans, meat, sauce combo. The tacos were my all-time favorite, and I have come back multiple times just to eat this -- there is a generous portion of tender meat, with a roaring amount of flavor with each bite. Again, the green salsa is milder than the red, but a lot creamier in consistency. The chips were different in a nice way. They have a crunchier, thicker texture, rather than the usual flimsy thin kind that I am used to having.\n\nIt is open till 3AM on weekend nights, so a good place to eat after a late night out.

I was at a party in the Mission and TBH planned on going to La Taq until I realized it was almost midnight and it was closed, thus ended up wandering over to El Farolito. The line was out the door and I was surprised by how slowly we moved, took about 30 minutes in total before we got our food.\n\nI got my go-to, a carne asada super burrito. The portion was generous especially for the price, I ate half that night and the rest the next day. I'm a big baby when it comes to spice, so I was sure to ask for mild salsa when I ordered. But when the guy at the register repeated my order he spoke super fast and it sounded like he might have said \"light\" salsa? Anyway when I got my burrito it looked like mild salsa/pico de gallo but holy heck it was really spicy. Like I said I'm a wimp and it wasn't so spicy it was inedible, but it definitely made me enjoy my burrito less.\n\nAs everyone else said this place is pretty dirty if you care about that. The floor, the tables, the bathroom were all straight up grimy, but we took it to-go so we didn't have to deal. \n\nOverall this is a good alternative to La Taq's crazy expensive $13 burrito.

If you're a cheese lover, you won't be disappointed by the quesadilla. It's creamy, gooey, and delicious.

Depending on where your taste buds take you, El Farolito is a good place to start and definitely to try out for visitors.  Their menu is pretty large and diverse but stick to a quesadilla or burrito and you won't regret it.  Every time I've had a burrito or quesadilla from El Farolito, I always notice that the meat is a lot more fresher than some other places.  Their portion is pretty Cali-sized so definitely have an appetite when you go! Or save it for later, of course. The ingredients they put in their burritos seem very authentic and traditional as well. \n\nI usually get their carne asada but recently I've been venturing off to their tripe and lengua.  All very great cuts.  The portion of meat in the burrito does not come shy.  There's a LOT in there.

You would think it would kill someone if they clean up their own mess but again, who am I kidding? \n\nOk, stop complaining, my burrito, maybe cuz it's a busy night but it was bland.  Even with the sauce, it didn't taste right.  I think I was lacking the fat from the meat or something but it was dry.  The rice was a bit hard and my carne asada was on the drier end.  Yea my sad face came out.  His did too.  Here he was, super excited for a burrito.  Failed\n\nI would just make my way to the SSF location or just another joint.  Oh yeah, cash only....at this point of gentrification, add a credit card option please!", "author": "Laurie W."}

All hail the King in the Mission!\n\nAffordably priced at $7.75, El Farolito's behemoth of a super burrito is loaded with explosive juicy goodness. I ordered the half pollo / half carne asada and cried tears of joy with every bite. They really nailed the ratio between meats, guacamole, and sour cream.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that there is nothing fancy about this place whatsoever. The crowd is rowdy, the seats are dirty, and the food comes in flimsy plastic containers. Don't even bother entering the restroom unless you have a gas mask on. When you come to El Farolito, you do it for the cheap and gut-busting Mexican food. Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nProTip: Let them know if you want to try out multiple types of meats in your burrito. By no means are you constrained to just one.

They have three type of sauces from the green sauce (mild), medium salsa, and spicy salsa. I got the spicy salsa and it was a nice kick!

If you're dead set on sampling something from El Farolito (as I was) to see what all the hype and line is about, I suggest walking to their 24th and Alabama St. location. It's a bit of a schlep, but the space is larger and I have heard the line is shorter. If you're too hungry to walk seven short blocks to Alabama St., head south on Mission St. to Taquer\u00eda La Corneta, one of my favorites in the city, or north on Mission St. to La Taqueria, although they also have a notoriously long line and higher prices.\n\nI went to El Farolito whilst on my Mission district taquer\u00eda crawl, sampling various veggie tacos, and I was not impressed at all. Even before I bit into the stale tortillas that they used to make my veggie taco, I was turned off by having to pay $0.65 for a side of chips. 9 out 10 taquerias in the Mission include chips with any order. The taco was so-so, but not worth the wait in line or the grubby environs.\n\nMy conclusion = El Farolito must be written up in tons of the tourist guides (the place is packed with folks who are clearly not from the area), and is perhaps cruising on a reputation it built a long time ago and has since lost.\n\nI've been to (this location of) El Farolito twice: the first and last time.", "author": "Beau W."}

I had the large size burrito, and it was easily the biggest burrito I've ever eaten.

I had this as a bucket list item to get to during a recent week out west and it lived up to its billing.\n\nNow I'm from KC which has a large Hispanic population, so we're blessed to have equally delicious tacos. That being said, the tacos here were amazing. These behemoths are loaded up with meat, and to me, like always, the al pastor is the way to go.\n\nI also tried the asada and the beef toungue which were very flavorful and delicious. The meat quality is good, you won't find popping gristly meat here. \n\nThe hot sauces have some real kick which I appreciate as a lover of all things spicy.\n\nPrices are right, service is quick, and the Modelas are cold.

Line up for a bit, the line moves quick, decide what you want, order, CASH ONLY, hold onto your ticket number and they'll bring the food to you. \n\nThey presented the tacos with separated plates for each type of meat, good job! It was easier to remember which meat was which. I devoured everything with a jarritos and what a lovely meal it was. The food was so great that I had almost forgot how it smells like urine and reeking unwashed clothes by the entrance/outside and how there's no effort into the decor and atmosphere of this place. Don't come here to eat if you have OCD. (I don't have OCD.) That's all I'm saying. It was a one time deal for me.

Huge roll and perfectly seasoned pork. My brother loved it! \n\n-1 super burrito with carne assada // basic done right! I love that the flavors were so evenly balanced and one didn't over power the other. \n\n-1 beef tongue taco // yum! To be honest, I love the texture of tongue. Give it a try!

I've tried all the other famous burrito places and they were good, but in my heart there was always a special place for the taco trucks near my childhood home (jk, more like college apartment). \n\nBut that was until I had this place. Oh El Farolito. You have single-handedly introduced Mexican back into my rotation of cravings. The one single menu item responsible for that would be the oh so glorious quesadilla.\n\nNow, I never order quesadilla anywhere. To me, the word quesadilla evokes the image of a single layer of cheese between two tortillas. Floppy. Greasy. \n\nBut El Farolito is sooooo not that. The supreme quesadilla is probably one of the most glorious foods I've ever eaten. It somehow is able to house steak, sour cream, avocado, cheese, and who knows what else they put in there. The steak is tender and seasoned perfectly. The healthy dose of sour cream really ties everything together. The tortilla is slightly crispy from the treatment on the griddle, but the inside is soft and gooey. It's perfect.\n\nIn terms of the eating experience, don't expect much. You line up, order frantically, (good luck trying to get things like a bag or to-go foil after you leave the counter), try to find a seat in the crowded back area, and hope they call your number soon.

These windows allow you to gaze with wonder how succulent and juicy the meat looks as they crisp it on the grill, how soft and supple the tortillas seem as the employees gracefully toss them around, how expertly they pile together each mouth-watering component to create something so beautiful and wonderful and heartbreaking (because your stomach can only hold so much) for you. \n\nI had 3 tacos: shrimp, al pastor, and carne asada.

But when it comes to burritos, one stands above them all, and that is El Farolito. Whether it be during lunch, dinner, or after a long night of drinking, there's usually a long line out the door. Although that may deter some from waiting, I find it an experience of itself. The smell of grilled meat greets you, and beckons your attention. The way the staff expertly prepares each order from grilling the tortillas to wrapping the finished burritos is like an art form.\n\nMy favorite item on the menu is their super burrito but customized to my liking. I order it with 2 different meats and black beans wrapped in a spinach tortilla. For the meats, I usually go with half carne asada and half lengua, but since the lengua price increase, I've gone with half al pastor instead. The combination of meats create a more complex flavor profile that elevates burrito over the top. And as an added bonus, they don't charge extra for choosing 2 meats, which a lot of other places seem to do. Their salsa bar is also amazing, especially their delicious and addicting salsa verde. I can write a whole review just for their salsa verde.\n\nThere are other taquerias nearby that do certain aspects better, whether it be a flakier tortilla, juicier meat, more comprehensive salsa bar, etc, but no one has a better complete burrito than El Farolito. It is the perfect example where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. With everything (flavor, amount, price, etc) taken into consideration, El Farolito's super burrito reigns supreme.

No beans (no farts), add avocado- my go to order.\n\nI took several bites of my burrito, and saw no sign of avocado. I figured they had forgotten, so I asked for some on the side. They must've been really annoyed with me, because they handed me half an avocado without even bothering to slice it. That's fine, I just scooped it out myself. When I got more than halfway through this massive burrito, I started seeing green. Uh oh. \n\nWhen will I stop accidentally stealing from restaurants? Is this becoming my new thing in SF? At this point, I opened up the tortilla and realized that all the avocado was back loaded toward the last few bites.  I AM A TERRIBLE PERSON. \n\nThe carne asada meat wasn't memorable, honestly. The quesadilla was okay. I'd only return if the line at La Taqueria happens to be long, or if this is the only spot open late night.", "author": "Karen S."}

Nope.\n\nThe service sucks, the guy taking the orders had the shittiest attitude. It's a new year guy, smile a little! I ordered three \"crunchy\" tacos de asada and two regular de tripa. After sitting down, Mr. Smiles, taking the orders, came and informed me that they were out of tripa, okay, I'll have al pastor. \n\nThe tacos al pastor were barely edible. The meat was reheated and dry.\n\nThe crunchy tacos were nasty. They were jam-packed with sour cream. I love sour cream with my tacos, burritos and just about everything, but c'mon. The meat quality was really poor; again, it was clearly reheated meat from last year. Taco Bell serves better crunchy tacos, no joke.\n\nAnyway, I love tacos, so I was working my way around the sour cream trying to stay positive when my brother turns to me and shows me a hair in his food.

I came here last Monday evening (August 7) with a friend around 7pm and the line was almost to the door -- that was probably the shortest it was the whole time we were there but it moves pretty quickly.\n\nSide note: this place is CASH ONLY so don't wait in that line only to find out you don't have enough cash at the register!\n\nI ordered us the quesadilla para dos: flour tortilla, cheese, steak (or another meat of your choosing, we went with al pastor), sour cream, and avocado for $12.45 but TIMES TWO. This meal is ideal if you and a friend, a date, or a future, hungover you tomorrow morning, both want the quesadilla super suiza (super delicious, amirite??) and are down with the same protein choice.\n\nHere's where I got excited and then sad. The cashier asked if we wanted the sour cream and avo inside or outside, and I was elated to shout OUTSIDE since we all know how i feel about avo. More later.\n\nWe were lucky enough to get a table (kind of dirty but we got hands, we can clean up for ourselves) and there, we patiently waited. Finally, essentially a pile of quesadillas came to us....!\n\nWith sour cream and massive slices of avocado INSIDE. My heart broke. The picky eater in me almost lost her appetite. \"Minus one star!\" I said to my friend half-jokingly. But at a place this busy, I couldn't bear to be \"that guy\" who takes two whole quesadillas up to the counter to say, \"um excuse me, but I'm super white and don't like avocado, so could you trash this perfectly good food and remake it for me despite your long af line? k thx\" so I did what any rational person does, and I pulled out every scrap of avo I could from the pieces I ate and gave them to my avo-loving homie.\n\nAnd good lord was this quesadilla great - I love quesadillas but this was one of those where you just close your eyes as you chew to really savor the taste. The al pastor had just a little bite to it but was so juicy, I had reddish orange grease running down my hands. I really appreciated how generous El Farolito was with the meat as well as the sour cream (and for an avo lover, the sliced avo). And their salsas are pretty good! The green sauce had more of a kick to it than some other tomatillos I've had but it was great. The hottest one wasn't quite hot enough for my friend but he said it was still tasty.\n\nOverall, this place was an awesome dinner -- a cheap meal that was super delicious and super worth the line, despite my order being wrong. Next time, maybe we'll order separately so I can just say no to avocado.", "author": "Keridwyn R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-14", "description": "I've wanted to review El Farolito's OG location for a while now since it is a San Francisco insitution (and Kaskade's favorite burrito joint). However, given my heavy heavy bias towards Mexican food from San Diego, I wanted to make sure that I would be able to give (as much as possible) a fair assessment. Multiple visits have ensued since my first time here. And now that I've had a decent chunk of this menu, it is time to finally lay down my thoughts.\n\nMy problem was that my original decision was to take the super burrito straight up...including beans. Perhaps my preference is born out of SD-style burritos, where there are basically never any rice or beans included. I know there are those who love beans in their burritos. My opinion is that unless you are eating a bean and cheese burrito, beans have zero business being in a burrito because they are straight filler that are meant to distract you from what really matters...the MEAT. (For the record, I am ok with rice as that doesn't really distract me from the meat).\n\nAnyways, now that we cut out the beans (and sour cream too, sacrifices have to be made in my old age) and get down to the real business, El Farolito has a solid burrito. Definitely better than your average SD or LA Mexican joint. Their carne asada and al pastor are pretty good...nowhere near the best I've ever had, but definitely in the above average range. Also, I think the rice complements the meat pretty well. Still would've preferred guacamole over avocado, but eh it is close enough. Bonus points for the burrito keeping VERY well after a flight back to Los Angeles and being microwaved a day after.\n\nBeing such a popular spot, sometimes it does get very crowded and seats become impossible to find here (I'm looking at you 2 AM crowd). And I do wish they had a non-cash option, but it is what it is. However, it has prime location (and I mean PRIME) right off of the 24th Street & Mission BART stop. If you're ever taking the BART down to SFO and you need a great meal that's super quick and cheap, you won't find a better option.\n\nOverall, El Farolito is a solid Mexican spot and I won't ever complain if I come here for any of my SF meals. But it is not elite-level Mexican food. Compared to my SD spots, there is no comparison.", "author": "Alexander Y."}

El Farolito is Americanized Mexican food done right, and that is coming from someone who lived in San Diego. \n\nThe store looks like a typical Mexican food hole in the wall. The proportions are a little weird, because it's very narrow with booths lining either side. It's a little dirty...we had to wipe down our table from the previous diners, but it's not awful. \n\nMy bf was peckish, so he just got a taco ($2.50). I was ravenous, so I opted for a Quesadilla Suiza (~$7?), which the cashier helpfully told me was about the size of a burrito. CASH ONLY! We came at a good time, because a wave of customers appeared not 10 minutes after we got there. The taco was decently sized, but...ehh, not worth $2.50. Pretty average. What was amazing though, was my Quesadilla Suiza. It was basically a flatter, crispier burrito. The portion is so large that I had to stop stuffing my face because I was too full. They were not shy with any of the ingredients--every mouthful had juicy al pastor, sour cream, avocados, and cheese. My only regret was that I could not take it home to a fridge...so 1/4 of that beautiful quesadilla was lost :,(. \n\nI have eaten so much Mexican food, but that Quesadilla Suiza has left quite the impression on me. It is a little more expensive than what I'm used to, but then again it's also San Francisco, so this is probably as cheap as you can get.

Some of the fillings were not distributed evenly, but everything was so flavorful it didn't impact my experience negatively. The meat itself was tender and there wasn't one piece I had to pick out ... usually I find there are pieces that are overly fatty or tough, but this was high quality meat. The rice was fluffy and well-seasoned, and the pinto beans weren't overly mushy or overly dry.

El Farolito seemed to be a consistent favorite so off I went. There was no line around 12:15 on a Friday which was a pleasant surprise. I ordered a carne asada super burrito with everything on it to go. It took about 10 minutes during which I snagged some of that fire avocado salsa. Carne asada was super flavorful and moist and the rest of the ingredients had a nice balance.

El Farolito hits all the right notes when it comes to flavor combinations, but something was lacking when it came to the carne asada .. lack of seasoning? We got a carne asada super burrito, an al pastor taco, and a lengua taco. My husband said that the burrito reminded him of El Gordo's in Berkeley, and I liked the burrito overall, but we both thought the carne asada could have been more flavorful. To be honest, I liked the California burrito at Viva Taqueria in Santa Clara better. We liked the al pastor, which wasn't too greasy and had a good kick to it. The lengua could have been better; like the carne asada, if just wasn't very flavorful.\n\nIf this is the best that the Bay Area has to offer, then this just cements my belief that the best Mexican food remains closer to the border in LA and San Diego.", "author": "Rachel L."}

The super quesadilla para dos will feed you and another person for more than two meals. They use lard in a lot of stuff, which makes the taste super rich, but beware for all you vegetarians/vegans out there. My favorites are the lengua (beef tongue), carne asada, and carnitas.

You don't need to tell me twice...I'm always down for cheap and delicious Mexican food.\n\nWhen we pulled up, we saw the line was out the door. Luckily it moved pretty quick.

Maybe it was because everyone was getting their orders to go but somehow it cleared up by the time we placed our order and we had no problem snagging a booth.  \n\nI was super hungry and went with the asada super burrito and the asada quesadilla. Realistically half of the burrito would've been enough to satisfy me, but since I was on vacation I decided to just power through it all. I thought it was awesome that they just had a self service salsa bar where you can just grab whatever you want. The burrito was huge as expected and packed to the max with meat. At Chipotle I watch the workers be all stingy while scooping the meat. Nope, not here. That thing was just filled with juicy, delicious pieces of steak. It was just a solid burrito all around and all the components tasted great together. \n\nThe quesadilla also tasted pretty good. Even though I ordered asada in both the burrito and quesadilla, the quesadilla steak was actually prepared in a slightly different way. Instead of little pieces of meat, they put thin slices of the steak in it and I actually liked it better this way. They also put enough cheese in there to make me question whether I was lactose haha.

I'm not sure these are so remarkable that they are worthy traveling great distances for.  There is another location a few blocks east and another location in Oakland that seem to have the same menu.  After eating at the flagship location, which was pretty packed, we walked past the other mission location, and there were plenty of free tables.  Lesson learned.  \n\nThe lengua was good, with a rich beefy taste.  The shredded chicken was unremarkable.  There is also a grilled chicken option, and that might be better.  \n\nI didn't actually see a true al pastor spit behind the counter, and that makes me suspect it is not the genuine article.  Going forward, I think I might seek out tacos instead of burritos.  And I might try some of the other meats (brains, cabeza).", "author": "Delaware F."}

Luckily, the burrito held it's shape and didn't tear.\n\nI also had the horchata to drink which was super smooth and not powdery like most taquerias. \n\nThe food did take a while to come out but they offered chips and salsa (from the salsa bar) which was great while we waited.\n\nThe taqueria is a little small. There is plenty of seating but it can get a little tight when you come in a group of 4+.\n\nThey have one restroom which I don't find all that clean.

Years ago el farolito was not only the best burrito in the mission but it was also the cheapest.  Now it's on par with the rest of the mission in terms of price and is a bit smaller.  The super suiza appears to be quite smaller as well.  It always sucks when a restaurant has to make their product more profitable so I just hope this trend doesn't continue at el farolito!. Also, my burrito and my partners super suiza were both really spicy so I don't know if they're defaulting to spicy salsa.  I hope not because neither of us can handle spice like that.

I think the best Mexican food is in L.A., hands down, but locals from San Diego and San Francisco would say otherwise.\n\nThat notion of L.A. being the king of Mexican food has been somewhat knocked down (for now) as I finally have been revisiting Farolito's more recently. I first visited this establishment many years ago, but unfortunately didn't get the burrito that currently is above the rest.\n\nThe \"Super Shrimp and Meat\" burrito which is about $12 and change, is a game changer. This burrito is not only the size of a half an infant, but the meat and thick, juicy pieces, of shrimp that's tucked inside, just waits for you to release it onto to your mouth and taste buds.\n\nGet some of the roja and verde in the salsa bar and call it a day. They also serve alcohol here, so, if you want a beer to go with your baby burrito, then, by all means. Place is cash only and parking can be a chore, but worth the scavanging for parking and waiting in the sometimes long line for the wares.", "author": "Wes S."}

All I remember was that it was a nightmare and an annoying experience. CASH ONLY. Seating areas are filthy. Restaurant is so small that every time someone walks by me, they'll bump into my elbow. My boyfriend, his best friend, and I came here based off the great reviews on Yelp. It was kind of a disappointment. The food was okay. Just make sure if you order a burrito for here, have them place it on a plate for you. My boyfriend and his best friend both ordered a burrito and the employees threw it in one of those red oval plastic containers. I asked for two plastic plates for the guys and one of the employee decided to hand me a styrofoam plate like the knife won't cut through!? The burrito eventually broke apart so it'll be a lot easier if you get it on a plate so that you can use a fork and a knife if needed.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

It just seemed like such delicious drunk food. And I'm sure it is, but I wasn't even that drunk anymore when I got here. It was around 1AM or so and the line was out the door... apparently that's typical so good for you El Farolito.\n\nMy friend suggested the shrimp & steak burrito, and I asked for NO BEANS.... but got some anyway. BOO. If there were no beans, it might have been a LOT better. I don't like beans lol (with exceptions of course). \n\nBut honestly it was still delicious. I forgot which salsas I got, but I liked the spicy one... as always. Dump some on your burrito and mMMMMMM. The shrimps were surprisingly huge and plump with a nice bite to em. I've only had one other shrimp burrito before lol and maybe I should be hitting those more often! The steak wasn't even necessary I thought lol. Delicious overall though.\n\nAlso.... you can probably share lol. It's a huge ass burrito, and I think it cost like 12 something bucks! Maybe that's because it's steak and shrimp (the fancier meats oOoO), but in SoCal that seems a little overpriced. I mean.. totally worth it for the size, but I can't finish it lol.\n\nBOMB (drunk or regular) food for sure. Would come back.

After putting El Farolito to the test I still think that Street Taco comes out on top, but when it comes to late night Mexican food when in a state of questionable sobriety El Farolito truly cannot be topped. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nWhile it may not look like as much, El Farolito is an exceptionally well oiled machine, and even the longest of unruly lines can be tamed and churned through in far less time than you'd think. It's important to keep in mind that El Farolito is cash only, and you'd better know what you want long before a menu is even visible. Place your order, pay, take a number, and listen carefully hombre - the system works if you play the game. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nThe value at El Farolito is unbelievable, and for under $7.00 you can score a burrito that surpasses the size of your average chipotle burrito. Tacos and other items are priced accordingly. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nSo here we go - as I unwrapped my carne asada super burrito a wave of hype washed over me, and turmoil over whether or not my favorite Street Taco would be surpassed washed over me. \n\nThe turmoil didn't last long, but there's still some good competition here. The meats at El Farolito are flavorful, and they go together nicely with the beans, rice, and very generous portions of sour cream wrapped in a flavorful tortilla. Was this the best burrito I'd ever had? No, the ingredients were distinctly segmented and the sour cream more or less took over half the burrito, but it was filled with good flavor. Single Star Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nSo Street Taco retains the crown as my favorite Mexican spot in San Francisco, but El Farolito deserves all of the hype that it gets with the late night Mexican market overwhelmingly secured thanks to quality and valuable offerings.

I got lengua with my super burrito, I appreciated that some of the meat was tender and soft and as if it would melt in your mouth, but there were some pieces of meat that were the opposite and almost had the texture and quality of Carne asada. I'm not sure if the meats mixed or if the meat was cooked slightly unevenly. My boyfriend who ordered the nachos, usually orders that as well as Chavez and I was surprised at the amount of chips they gave him. Both of us thought there would be more nachos, but it was pretty empty.. you could see the bottom of the box. At Chavez they usually overflow it with chips, meat, and lots of salsa and guac. I guess it depends where you go or what you expect. \n\nI sadly don't see myself coming back here because it's not as satisfying as Chavez in Hayward (or that satisfying in general), but I'll definitely keep looking around more in SF to where I can grab myself a delicious and well-proportioned super burrito.", "author": "Mae-Elisa S."}

I made it over to this location on Christmas Eve and luckily they were open.  We were there for an early-ish (11:30) lunch and there wasn't any line, though more people were coming in as we were finishing up.\n\nEl Farolito's reputation is well deserved.  The burritos were amazing.  I had half of a super al pastor burrito.  The seasoning was tasty, and the meat and fillings were delicious.  The burritos were huge and cheap.  Half was plenty for lunch for me, and I split it with my girlfriend, who enjoyed it enough to risk food poisoning by finishing her leftovers after walking around with them all afternoon (eep...).  We also got an order of chips to take advantage of the salsa bar.  The salsas were good, but the burritos are definitely the highlight here.", "author": "Bryce A."}

It turned out to be a fun gastronomic adventure. The outside was dark but strangely inviting. There was a long line of hungry and/or curious patrons. The window/counter gave you a peek of inter workings of this taqueria; masterpieces of culinary delights were being assembled. The cafe manager/cashier was loudly barking out order numbers that were ready to be picked! Eager customers were peering at the greasy menus boards and making critical choices with the cashier. The separation between the incoming customers and the seated patrons was very narrow; definitely not for those who suffering from any form of claustrophobia! The reward for those choosing to dine in and who were lucky to find seating was to have your order number called out in an unexpectedly quick wait! Presentation was very minimal but the food that my friends and ordered (assorted burritos and a quesadilla) were larger  and spicier than expected and very satisfying!  This may not be the cleanest nor safest place you visit in the middle of the night in the Mission District but this authentic Mission Style food at it's best!!", "author": "Hiron J."}

But it moves at a reasonable pace so don't you worry. You know when you spend years hearing things like, \"Mexican food outside of Mexico and California sucks\" And you're like no, but there are so many great places in city X and town Y that are amazing it can't be THAT true. \n\nYeah, it's just freakin' true. The best tacos I've ever had and they were my first ones here. First of all, for two fitty a taco you get portions equivalent to TWO tacos on the east coast. I tried one marinated pork and one steak. They were so juicy, it spilled all over my basket. Every bite is bursting with that Mexican flavor we love, a bit of cilantro and onion and all that tender chopped meat. Also, the salsa and jalapeno bar. Why has this not caught on in the rest of the country? It's FRESH and actually HOT. Not accommodating and unapologetic to anyone who can't handle heat. \n\nMy partner ordered the carne asada plate which he LOVED. The beef was thinly sliced and amazing. They also have a little side of seared scallions, such a nice touch. \n\nI promise I'l be back here when I'm schwasted and also when every east coaster comes this way to visit me! \n\nEl Farolito, you will forever be the one who introduced me to the Mexican food I've been missing all my life.", "author": "Priti K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-05", "description": "I lived in San Diego for 4 years and thought I knew what good Mexican food was. I simply must have not been going to the right places (with the exception of Tacos El Gordo in Chula Vista), because El Farolito literally changed how I feel about (Americanized?) Mexican food.\n\nThere are a few things I like in my Mexican food (and this will obviously betray how uneducated I am about this type of cuisine): flour tortillas, cheese, avocados, pork, and sour cream. It comes as no surprise, then, that the super suiza quesadilla was heaven for me. Most people like to order the default (carne asada), but if you're a fan of pork like me, get the al pastor. The meat was so perfectly tenderized and juicy and flavorful...I only wanted to take a couple of bites, but I ended up eating half of it. There was also so much sour cream and so many avocados that the quesadillas were practically watery by the time we got home--but the fried edges were still crispy and perfect. And like I said, I LOVE sour cream. They do not skimp on any of the toppings or meat here. \n\nThere is also some sort of hot sauce in the quesadilla, which gives it a kick. There are also three other salsas you can pack yourself in the restaurant. I tried the green one (which numbed my mouth for 5 minutes) and the regular salsa. The non-salsa red one is super spicy, so I was too afraid to try it. But the spicy green sauce and the mild salsa both went great with the quesadilla.\n\nMy husband has been trying to cut back on meat so we had to get something vegetarian-friendly along with our super suiza quesadilla. We opted for the super nachos with fried eggs (you can also get it with your choice of meat) and I am so glad that we did. It's everything you'd expect with super nachos--refried beans, crispy fresh corn tortilla chips, avocados, jalapenos, tomatoes, sour cream, etc--but with 3 fried eggs on top. How utterly sinful. I can't believe we almost finished the whole thing, but it was irresistible.\n\nSince I'm not a fan of corn or beans, I still prefer the super quesadilla over the super nachos, but I think regardless of what you your preferences are, you'll find El Farolito to be SUPER.\n\nWhat's not super is the atmosphere. Not enough to drag this down to 4 stars, but the night we went a man who had just stolen some clothes (he was wearing the, tags still hanging out) ran out of the restaurant when a security guard popped up and grabbed some of the chips off customers' table while running by. So random. Even less random and less super was a crazy person running in, yelling, and then grabbing half of a poor girl's burrito before running out. The security guard was finally placed at the restaurant's entrance. He was in the middle of a verbal altercation with the clothing thief by the time my husband and I were leaving.

Are there geographical differences in taste that affect the flavors and ingredients used?  I would argue that SF boasts better burritos while the tacos from LA rule supreme.\n\nYou will likely find the best SF burritos in the Mission district.  El Farolito is no exception to the rule.  Based on other reviews I ordered a breakfast burrito and also a taco al pastor.  I had heard the al pastor was in a class of its own, but I am a sucker for a breakfast burrito.\n\nMy taco al pastor, at $2.50, was huge, very filling.  Think two-three times larger than King Taco in LA.  The al pastor itself was succulent, just dripping with flavor, and perfectly accented by onions and cilantro.  The double corn tortillas somehow held together despite being overloaded with the pork.  Great!  5-star definitely.\n\nMy breakfast burrito was nearly a footlong, a beast of a burrito for only $6.75.  It included scrambled eggs, bacon, chorizo, rice, beans, sour cream, cheese and guacamole.  The bacon and chorizo were delicious, but with so many ingredients, it was a rather heterogenous meal depending on each bite.  I used plenty of hot sauce, but alas, could not finish the entire burrito having already eaten my taco.  4-star.\n\nI think El Farolito continues the high standard of SF burritos.

The line was almost to the door and the place was bustling with people working and eating. I ordered the super burrito with steak. The wait was quite a bit long for this one. It took almost 15 minutes to get my food, but it was worth it. The burrito felt like a small baby I was holding. It was hefty and they did not skimp out on the meat and ingredients. It tasted fresh and I enjoyed every bite. The spot is in the mission, so this is definitely a more rough part of town. The place is a hole in the wall, so expect as much.

This place is an absolute must try.  Located in the Mission district, this place is a total hole in the wall.  Don't expect nice and roomy seating.  Think more along the lines of waiting in a pretty long line, 30-40 minutes, in a single file line with a majority of the waiting being outside with the exception of a narrow corridor at the entrance.  Regardless of the long wait this place is absolutely amazing and totally worth it.  \n\nI've been through my fair share of burritos but this place is easily top 3 burritos I have ever had.  I'm not even exaggerating, this place is that good.  I ordered a carne asada super burrito and it was definitely the way to go.  As you walk in you see one of the chefs cooking up a storm of various meats and with the lines this place has you know that the meat in your burrito will be freshly cooked.  The burrito comes with rice, beans, sour cream salsa, and literally a GIANT chopped up slice of avocado, and your choice of meat.  With a name like super burrito you would expect it to be huge and my expectations were met.  This thing was giant.  The food comes out relatively quickly, which is nice if you're starving.  They also have a salsa bar next to the cash register with 3 kinds of salsas.  \n\nA few side notes, this place is cash only so be prepared, they have some seats inside, but can be difficult to find a table so have someone grab one while you wait in line, and as mentioned before be prepared to wait.  I seriously am looking forward to my next SF trip.", "author": "Jesus H."}

Dang.\n\nFor many years I've been told that it's a travesty that I lived so closed to San Francisco and I've never had what Esquire magazine calls \"the most life-changing burrito in America.\"   Well, this past Sunday I had a chance to eat one.\n\nOr rather, half of one.  I saved the other half for later because this burrito was freaking huge.  \n\nEl Farrolito IS the holy trinity of food in San Francisco: 1.) cheap, 2.) fast, and probably most importantly, 3.) amazingly delicious.  We went in there right as they opened at 10am and there was no line, which was awesome, since I hear that they get quite packed.  Fortunately, (or maybe unfortunately) the only other person who was there was a drunk homeless dude, so we got served very quickly.  The burrito itself comes with chips which seem kind of stale at first, but are actually just fried somewhat differently so they have \"layers.\"   There's no way to describe it other than that they're delicious.  \n\nBut the real crux of this review is the burrito.  ohhh man.  The burrito.  It's about 1.5x the size of a Chipotle, which is to say, LARGE, except unlike Chipotle, the meat isn't cubed, the ingredients are mixed together, and finally the guacamole isn't $1.80 (seriously, Chipotle.  what the hell).  I opted for the carne asada, because I'm boring, and it was perfectly grilled without being tough.  The juices seeped into the rice and beans and everything was bound together with sour cream in the most perfect way.  And it was $7.  \n\nAnyway, there's really nothing to say about El Farolito that hasn't been said other than that they make a great burrito.

Quite frankly anything non-Korean was wonderful, but one of our favorites was when our parents would buy us a burrito from some hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Central LA. I have no idea how my immigrant parents knew about this place, but that restaurant made the best burritos that we've ever had. Whenever I ate that burrito, I wasn't simply eating a burrito, but I was traveling the world. It took me to a place that was so different from what I lived in my every day life.\n\nThat restaurant closed up, moved, or disappeared. We don't know. All I know is that we were no longer able to find that restaurant and its delicious burritos. We've had other good, even great, burritos, but they weren't the same. \n\nLast year I promised Ben to bring him back from burritos from California because the burritos in the East Coast weren't cutting it. He was skeptical that a Mission burrito would be better than what we could find in NYC. I was on a Mission to find him the best Mission burrito. Thanks to the great Yelpers, like Daniel L, I found El Farolito. I didn't even taste the burritos. I bought them and went straight to the airport.\n\nWe had them the next day. If the burritos were THIS INCREDIBLE a day old, then imagine how much more insanely delicious they would have been fresh. We gobbled them down and eagerly awaited for my next trip to San Francisco. These burritos brought back memories of the burritos of my childhood. \n\nWe've had the al pastor and the steak burritos. Although there are absolutely no complaints about the steak burrito, I prefer the al pastor because I think the meat is a little juicier and more flavorful. \n\nWhat really makes the burrito stand out are the pinto beans. I don't know how they cook them, but the beans are so tender and flavorful and really meaty tasting. I would gladly eat bowlfuls of their pinto beans. \n\nThe flour tortillas are also very delicious, almost flaky and very tender, but still hardy enough to contain the overflowing deliciousness.\n\nThis year I bought three burritos, but I was on the plane wishing I had four.", "author": "Elle P."}

It was all a dream!\n\nAfter my first trip to El Farolito on 24th and Mission, that song was all I could think of. The juiciness is just out of control.\n\nNot sure why it took us so long to hop aboard El Farolito's breakfast burrito bandwagon, but after a surprising 20-30 minute stroll down the Mission without any luck finding a suitable breakfast burrito spot, Farolito's morning offering stood out for its convenience, affordability and quality ingredients. \n\nAlthough not what the restaurant is typically known for, the Farolito breakfast burrito came through for me in a time of need. The typical egg/sausage combination is elevated here by substituting mouth-watering chorizo, which went nicely along with generous helpings of melted cheese, refried beans, rice, avocado and eggs, in addition to the pile of green salsa which was thrown on top by yours truly.\n\nAnd while this may be a small thing to some, count me as being in favor of the $0.65 chips!! While that's a little bit more than \"free\", that's still some very affordable stuff right there, so sign me up every time.\n\nThe only dimension where the burrito comes up short is its high propensity to fall apart as you eat it. On this point, here the juiciness becomes a double-edged sword, as the steady flow of juice from the chorizo combines with the salsa and eggs to slowly overpower the tortilla and cause increasing wiltage as you make your way through the core of the burrito. \n\nFor the most part, though, my burrito held things together admirably, allowing me to eat relatively mess-free for me (although my friend wasn't so lucky).\n\nAnd because so many places are going **Cash Only** these days, I can't even really discount places for following suit at this point. But it is certainly something to be aware of, because you will not want to be the dummy who waits patiently for 20 minutes in line salivating at the delicious spices and aromas emanating from the kitchen just to get to the register and find out you can't pay for your food!\n\nThat's just a bad day. So do yourself a favor and make sure you come prepared.\n\nIn the end, I left the place a big believer. While the Super Burritos at El Farolito understandably grab most of the attention, the breakfast burritos are true heavyweights contenders in their own right. Although not quite an altogether life-changing experience, you can do much worse than a dank burrito filled with juicy goodness at an affordable price.\n\nJuicy. In the end, that's the one quality that defines the majestic El Farolito Burrito.\n\nUh, and if you don't know, now you know.", "author": "Brian S."}

Yes, everyone in LA thinks they have the best Mexican food and, this is simply not true. El Charito in Salinas, CA and El Farolito are clearly the best.

I expect this popular place to have quite a wait sometimes, but they seem to be on top of their stuff and can bring you your food really quickly. \n\nOf course, there's a bar of sauce fixings (the green one is my favorite) and jalape\u00f1os to add. The staff is friendly, even when they're stressed with so many customers to serve.

Not just in California. But in the country.\n\nSeriously, best in the whole U.S. of A.\n\nClearly, I needed to try this post-haste before the lines were so long*** we couldn't get in the door, let alone get a table. I mean most of SF already knows the food here is great, but now that yuppy transplants like me are aware of it, it's only going to get worse.\n\nSo last night (Monday), a friend and I took Bart to 24th Street and got in line for El Farolito to try the burrito. It looks like just about any other taqueria -- kind grimy, with a long kitchen that culminates with a cash register where you put in your order. \n\nI learned the rules quickly: get in line, look at the menu****, and have your order ready by the time you get to the front of the line. It's cash only, so come prepared as people will get upset with you if you don't have cash after you order and then try to skip the line after you've gone to hit an ATM.\n\nAlso, people really hate when you save seats: wait until your entire party has ordered and then go find seats. You might have to wait for a few minutes for a table to open up, but you can always get the food to go and head to a bar nearby.\n\nOn to the food: I had the chorizo super burrito while my friend got carnitas. We also picked up a steak quesadilla because the picture looked enticing and we like them. I enjoyed my burrito, though I didn't like the chili-fication of the chorizo -- it was ground and cumin-y instead of being the stringy, pulled-pork style of chorizo that I'm used to. My friend enjoyed his carnitas even though he couldn't finish it, though he thought it was a little bland.\n\nBut let's talk about the quesadilla! This is the best quesadilla I've ever had -- ever. It had the perfect cheese to oil ratio and was thick without being too stuffed. And the steak, oh the steak! It was fantastically season and perfectly grilled. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it.\n\nI don't know if this is the best burrito I've ever eaten, though it was really, really good. But I would go back for just the 'dilla and I would not be ashamed about ordering two.\n\n* - early January of 2014, depending on when you're reading this.\n\n** - there was a reader poll, and SF residents may have stuffed the ballot box.\n\n*** - If you come late night, this is probably already the case.\n\n**** - though I advise getting here hungry because the burritos are huge, make sure not to be too hungry because with prices that are fairly inexpensive, you're going to order way more food than you should.", "author": "Danny P."}

Yelp said El Faralito was reasonably priced and good for vegetarians. Neither of these things were true for me. \n\nI used to live in the mission and I love me a good burrito. Being a vegetarian my whole life I've almost always gotten the same thing when I go to a taqueria and get a burrito. Refried beans, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole or avocado. \nRecently the taqueria near my house has started to charge for substitutions so I wanted to try somewhere that seemed to be cheap and meet my needs. \n\nI ended up paying $9.08 for Chips(yes they charge for chips...) and a Super Burrito, no rice and no meat. The super burrito doesn't say it comes with lettuce but I made sure to tell the cashier, no lettuce. \nThat's a lot of money when you consider what I ordered, not to mention most taquerias would charge a maximum of $7 for my order. And while the burrito was quite large, I couldn't eat more then three bites before I had to throw it away.  \n\nThe tortilla was spicy and tasted like meat(presumably from the grill). It was grilled in some places but raw in others. The beans were a goopy, spicy mess. If you like refried beans that are spicy this place is fine for you. But for me, I wish they'd at least let you know that's what you're getting because I had no idea and I have a medical condition that makes even slightly spicy unbearable. \nI got lettuce on my burrito despite asking the cashier to make sure there wasn't any lettuce. \n\nThe chips tasted like stale, dried out, store bought, pieces of crap. For $0.69(when they are free at most taquerias) that's unforgivable. \n\nThe place was disgusting(just like other reviewers had said, I don't know how they have passed any type of health inspection. \n\nAnd I was aware that there would be a wait so I asked the cashier if it was ok if I ran outside for a few minutes and come back. I wanted to get some fries at the McDonald's. The cashier told me no, it'll only be 5 minutes. 18 minutes later my number was called. \n\nI cannot understand why this restaurant is popular among vegetarians. But I do understand why it'd be popular  with meat eaters. \nI think it's important that people don't just listen to the reviews. This place was a disgusting rip off and because of these Yelp reviews I wasted my hard earned money on it. \n\nIf you like a good basic bean and cheese burrito, DO NOT COME HERE. \n\nI wish I had tried literally any place but El Faralito.", "author": "Daphne H."}

It's HUUUGE and packed with meat, rice, guac, salsa, etc. The carne asada was flavorful and grilled wonderfully. They didn't over-season with MSG either *yay for no dry mouth and food coma*. My boyfriend got the lengua super burrito and enjoyed his too. It's easier to mess up lengua because there's a specific texture, but El Farolito succeeded! We also got carnitas and chorizo tacos. The only thing I didn't like was the taco shells 'cause they're made from wheat, which tasted different from what I'm used to. \n\nKey takeaway points:\n- CASH ONLY -\n- FREE CHIPS WITH PURCHASE -\n- GET THEIR SUPER BURRITOS -\n- THERE'LL PROBABLY BE LEFTOVERS -\n- USE THE GREEN SAUCE.

I was in the area finally and had a chance to check it out. The line was out the door when I was here in the middle of a weekend afternoon. But it moved quickly. I ordered and paid. The place is very long and narrow. And packed with tables. So waiting for my food was a little awkward. Not really any place to sit so I had to stand in front of or next to tables filled with people eating. Got my food about 5 minutes later, which I thought was pretty quick. I got a carne asada burrito and a sesos taco with everything to go. I rarely see sesos, which is cow brain, on the menu and I've yet to try it so I had to get it. I'm not a fan - I think it's a texture thing. It didn't have that much flavor and it was like this mushy meat. The beef burrito was really good though. I liked it a lot. Lots of carne asada. And this was just the regular burrito, not the super. The best burrito ever? - probably not, but really solid. Need to come back and try more things off the menu.", "author": "Alison W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-29", "description": "1. My sketch team, Bombardier, got selected to perform at this year's SF Sketchfest. I grew up in the Bay Area. But I had to move to New York, to move to Los Angeles, to perform comedy in San Francisco for the first time.\n2. We drove up Friday afternoon. We discussed the languages of love. I don't think gift giving should count as a language. Bribing someone for love should be illegal and anybody who adheres to it will one day be outed as ghouls once we put on the sunglasses. \"Consume Love.\"\n3. On our second day in San Francisco, Diona suggested that we eat El Farolito. I was delighted. I had spent many late nights after punk/hardcore shows at the Balazo Gallery eating El Farolito. That venue moved locations and eventually closed. But El Farolito remains. Burritos have known to be flimsy, but I believed El Farolito to remain sturdy.\n4. When we arrived at El Farolito, there was a line of people slithering out the front door. Every seat was full. I knew what to expect. People on my team looked concerned. I told them to trust me. And they did. So we ordered. I ordered the Super Veggie Burrito with chips. In an ideal world, every bite of a burrito would come paired with a tortilla chip. I do what I can to emulate that perfect world.\n5. An \"empty\" table was covered in spiraling tin foil, bits of burritos, colorfully stained napkins. People who don't bus their own tables in non-restaurant establishments should be put in a cannon. The cannon should be dropped into the ocean. And there they should spend eternity drowning in wet gunpowder and reflecting on their inability to clean up after themselves. Yes, a worker can clean the table, but if they don't, it's on the next patron. But I guess if you spend your entire life not looking backward at the trail of garbage you leave, you'd never realize you were in fact a garbage person. The thing about garbage is: it should always be thrown AWAY!\n6. A man started playing acoustic guitar. We looked at each other. There was no option. We were forced to converse with one another until the food arrived. I exhaled. One of them inhaled. \"So anyways,\" one of them said. We all waited for what would follow. A man with an apron broke the emptiness away, \"Number sesenta y nueve?\" He dropped order after order upon our table. I peeled back the tin foil. I took my first bite. And the satiety slithered down our throats.\n7. The satisfaction continued with every new bite. Our hunger was crushed under the weight of a mutated burrito. There might be bigger burritos being assembled elsewhere, but better? Hmm. I'm not so sure about that. Many burritos will exhaust a puddle of juice from its rear end. This did not. Its ratio of bean to rice to cheese to avocado felt mathematical. We discussed our show from last night. We discussed our show that would occur later that night. But none of us discussed, even mentioned, wanting to eat ever again. El Farolito had done its job once again. The last thing I can recall being said was by Jessica, \"I can't wait to see what that burrito looks like when I poop.\" Everyone who heard her nodded in agreement. All food becomes poop. All life becomes death. And, most importantly, all good reviews must end...\n8. I'd like to address user \"Kody S.\" and their \"review\". \"They were open to other customers but couldn't even several me chips and salsa  racist place to get food from\". In the minimum, Yelp, should only allow reviews that have at least ONE complete sentence. I quoted user \"Kody S.\"'s entire review. There is no period. There is but a half formulated thought. \n9. Doesn't it suck that if an establishment was actually racist nobody would believe it because of reviews like this? \"The Yelp Reviewers Who Cried Racist Wolf.\" I mean, yes, presumably, El Farlito \"couldn't even several\" them chips. But what does severaling one chips have to do with ethnicity? Is one chip less racist than several chips? Are these uncertain volleys of racism why Donald Trump might become our next president? I'd go as far as to say, specifically, user \"Kody S.\" and their \"review\" of El Farolito is THE reason why Donald Trump WILL become our next president! Now, that assertion is a CLASSIC Zed C. On Yelp Moment\u2122! Feel free to share and enjoy :-)\n10. Now that I'm back in L.A., days later, I am still full. I haven't eaten anything in over forty eight hours. I've taken a few craps but the burrito is still slowly dissolving in my stomach. All my L.A. friends have been jealous when they hear or smell me fart. \"Is that a El Farolito fart?\" \"Yes.\" \"Everybody can tell. No taqueria in Los Angeles can compare. Way to rub it in our faces,\" they say as I rub my butt on their faces. All good farts dissipate into qualitative-less nothing.

Oh my goodness, EVERYTHING WAS DELCIOUS. The quesadillas were made perfectly with loads of flavor! It's that cheap \"dirty\" Mexican food that everyone loves to enjoy. Be sure to have lots of napkins because it's messy! The tacos were delicious with a good crunch. There was more sour cream that I wanted but still very tasty. \n\nOverall, a very good place and I'm glad I stopped by before leaving SF. Know that they only take CASH however and the lines can get pretty long. The area is a little sketch but as long as you aren't doing anything stupid, you'll be safe!", "author": "Joon K."}

I would grab a whole cupful of that salsa and I'm not talking about just the mini sauce condiment cups, but the cups you use for water!  Yep, I love it that much!\n\nTheir burritos are humongous!  I can finish it in one setting only if I haven't had a meal for the entire day!  It's that huge!\n\nI have gradually preferred tacos versus burritos over the years since the discovery of this place.  Why, you may ask?  Well, tacos are much more meaty compared to what they pack in a burrito and tacos are are so much juicier!  Beans and rice are soaking up that meaty flavor in a burrito so you can't quite soak up that juicy, mixed sauce in your mouth as much!\n\nI do recommend their carne asada and spicy Mexican sausage as fillers!  They make their nachos freshly crisp and warmly melted with cheese!\n\nMind the dining area.  It's on the shabby side. \n\nService is quick, cash only and 50 cents for side chips!

There was a line that stretched close to the entrance.  The narrow walkway is surely a fire hazard.  One can barely squeeze by the line of people to exit the restaurant.  The extra tables and chairs do not help the situation either.  Upon waiting in line, there was a man who took orders to speed things along.  I ordered a grilled chicken burrito, strawberry aqua frescas, and chips.  It took another five minutes to reach the cashier to process the transaction.  Please keep in mind they only take cash at this location.  They also charge for chips.  How much they charge is unclear because they have different prices for chips.  One sign says 5x cents.  The other sign says 6x cents.  Surely having two different prices is some violation of fair pricing law.  \n\nIt took at least ten to fifteen minutes for the burrito to be made.  The customer in line behind me even got his several burritos before my one.  This made me furious because I had to get back to work.  When my burrito was finally made, I took it and dashed out of there.  It was so cramped, and nauseating being stuck in there.  \n\nAs for the burrito, it was disgustingly dry.  The chicken was without a doubt, overcooked.  It was such a let down.  The other El Farolito location has onions and cilantro that they put inside the burrito.  It makes such a huge difference.  The aqua frescas was so diluted.  Whether or not the ice had melted or they just water it down, it was a mistake to order it here.  The chips were the only thing that was good.  They were fresh and crisp.  At the other locations, they are more stale.  I guess because they give them out for free.  \n\nI had high expectations for this place.  I will pass on this location and you should too.", "author": "Victor L."}

The burrito is folded perfectly and wrapped in the beautiful metallic aluminum foil. I have yet to get an aguas frescas, but they look popular and good! After the few times I've been here, quality is consistent! \n\nSERVICE: Fast, fast, fast! Do not get discouraged from the long line, and you'll be rewarded and very happy.

But I have to tell you, this place deserves the 5.  My friend has been raving about this place for about a year now.  I just have not had the chance to try it until this weekend when I was finally able to go visit the Bay.\n\nAt first, we got the name mixed up and almost went to the wrong burrito joint. Thank goodness for Yelp to lead us in the right direction.\n\nThe place is literally 10 steps away from the entrance of Bart (24th and Mission).  It doesn't seem like much nor does it seem like it would be a delicious place... boy are looks deceiving.  The line was about a 15 minute wait out the door until we were able to order. The service was great and very quick.  My friend is vegetarian, so we ordered the vegetarian menu items.  We got the super veggie burrito with extra avocado, the nachos, and the horchata.  Looking at their cooking, I would love to come back and try their meat burrito some day.\n\nThe minute the burrito came to our table, I was blown away by the size of it.  Think of a Chipotle burrito attached to another Chipotle burrito. The length was so large I could not believe what was in front of me.  It was great... I could not wait to take a bit into the deliciousness.  \n\nFirst, we attempted to eat the nachos with real Mexican queso and loads of avocado chunks on top.  The dish was excellent with the perfect amount of toppings to make the chips go a bit soggy. I was getting full just by the nachos...and I split them with my friend!\n\nNext was the demolition of that burrito.  The first bite was fantastic. The second bite was excellent.  The bites just got tastier and tastier.  The super veggie was filled with rice, re-fried beans, double avocado chunks, salsa, and cheese.  While it is hard to make an A+ veggie burrito that looks filling and is filling, this place hit the right notes.  I could not finish it. I ate about 2/3 of my burrito and was sad that I could not continue eating the best burrito I have ever tasted. Side note: the green sauce (avocado) was the perfect condiment to put on anything. You could taste the fresh avocado with the perfect hit of spice mixed in.  From a vegetarian burrito perspective, El Farolito nailed it.\n\nAnd lastly, the prices are so affordable it's unreal.  The burrito was about $7-8 for such a large quantity.  Hint: They only take cash so be prepared!\n\nI only wish I took my leftovers to go back home to LA.  On the bus ride back, I literally had dreams of biting into that goodness... time only waits until I am back in the bay and can experience the greatness that this place has to offer.", "author": "Laura C."}

I'm not sure if that particular combo is even on the menu, but I was going through photos of Yelpers past for El Farolito and came across one that featured such combo. I had to have it.\n\nThe carne asada and shrimp were both seasoned well, and they weren't overcooked. The beans had a nice layer of gooey cheese, and the tortillas were warm and plentiful. I love avocado, so I was definitely excited to have it with my meal.\n\nThe Bad:\nMy friend ordered chips and I can't say I was too impressed with them, nor was I impressed with the salsa bar, which consisted of watery salsa without any spiciness. I've seen a much better selection at Los Coyotes (also in the Mission).\n\nThis place is cash only and that irritates me to no end, especially if the location is in a crummy part of town.\n\nConclusion:\nOverall, I left El Farolito feeling pretty satisfied, with leftovers, and I still had enough cash for a drink at El Techo de Lolinda. However, Los Coyotes still stands as #1 in this Mexican girl's heart.", "author": "Annette C."}

My New Yorker self was super impressed. My friends ordered me a Boss's burrito and it was literally the best burrito I've had in my life.

My friend and I came around 8pm on a Thursday night, but of course struggled to really enjoy our food given the lateness and the fact that we sat near the door next to the cold. However, the burrito was great but not life changing.\n\nI came back again a few months later with a group of friends at noon time. I ordered the super quesadilla and my friends got the quesadilla para dos and also the super burrito was shrimp.\n\nFirst off, the super quesadilla changed my life. Every bite will take you to foodgasmic heaven. That green sauce with the carne asada cooked to perfection... there's nothing quite like it. I guarantee one will get you full and for the price... I've never had better. I usually don't like quesadillas, but this one was more like a burrito was hella cheese.\n\nMy friends told me they loved the quesadilla para dos (but i suggest just get the super one; it has more ingredients). However, they all agreed the super burrito changed their lives. The shrimp was AMAZING. How can one place grill shrimp that well? I took a bite out of it, and I jumped right back to food heaven.\n\nI really encourage you to take the chance and try El Far. It's definitely on my list of best mexican places. I'll check out La Taqueria next time and see how it compares. \n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

I often get it with just cheese, but my friends rotate between chicken and steak. The quesadilla itself if very large (large burrito size tortillas). The fresh salsa bar is my favorite part. There are about 6 different types ranging from mild to hot, pico to liquid-like. Chips do cost extra (very minimal), but they are worth the add on to enjoy with the salsa bar. The prices are also very affordable coming in around $6 for a quesadilla with meat.

After my experience at La Taqueria and its tremendous wait, I was super hesitant about dropping into El Farolito.\n\nThe restaurant is long and narrow, and I think there is additional seating in the back. When I dropped by, the wait was reasonable, and it was sans the hoopla that La Taqueria embodies. The patrons were simply here for a quick meal.\n\nI ordered their super burrito with carne asada. The burrito comes equipped with rice, beans, diced tomatoes, onion, cilantro, sour cream, avocado, and cheese. I prefer the charbroiled quality of the meat here over La Taqueria. Again, with the addition of the sour cream, avocado, and cheese, the Americanized fixings just make the burrito a fattier version of itself, so how could it possibly not taste good? The burrito was much heftier in size and reasonably priced at around $7. \n\nWhile trying the burrito here was a good experience, I would probably not go out of my way to get a burrito here again.

How cute.\n\nThat naive threshold has since been irrevocably destroyed by the joint called El Farolito.\n\nWhy, I ask myself, do I continue to crawl back for second and third rounds, despite its grungy looking kitchen amenities that cause me to pause and question their posted passing health score? Why do I find myself at their front doors once again, despite their cramped narrow seating area that makes the inside of a school bus feel luxuriously spacious? Why am I shelling over my cash for another burrito, despite the fact that it feels suspiciously like the only source of ventilation is the breeze squeezing feebly through their front door at one end of the room, which warrants my concern of \"how many laundry cycles before my clothes no longer smell like a generous helping of carnitas?\"\n\nThe fact that I have my above concerns and still insist on cramming into my mouth the burrito that clearly cannot fit my stomach's capacity should indicate that its taste and flavors are worth overlooking El Farolito's otherwise questionable characteristics. \n\nThe phrase \"patience is a virtue\" can also be very appropriately applied here as if you so much as dare to peel back the crinkly foil and bite into the soft, steaming tortilla any less than 10 minutes since it was handed to you, you can expect to jerk back with a shout and proceed to nurse your numb, burned tongue for the next 3 days.", "author": "Jenni H."}

Finally one night I gave in during a slow and less busy time period. The patrons are quite friendly, chatted with a few of them as they hyped about the joint.\n\nOrdering was quite simple, get in line, look at the menu as you wait to reach the cashier and order. Moments later they handed me my order and off I go like any creature into the shadows or corner..joking. Sometimes does feel like that when I hold off eating my food before arriving back to my place. The order was wrapped in aluminum foil which kept it warm.\n\nUpon the first bite, the taco was filled with an abundance of meat. Still something was missing, the carne asada seemed rather chewy or perhaps it was the lack of flavor. Quickly grabbed some hot sauce and spread it over the tacos. Sadly even that couldn't save it, the tacos at the end were just the normal, average tacos. I cannot say I will ever go back but most definitely not worth waiting in line. Maybe its the zero trans fat or non-GMO, who knows, it wasn't bad just the normal, typical taco joint.", "author": "Enrique G."}

Yes, I knew you, my non-Spanish speaking comrades had an intense burning (pun intended) desire to know the origin and extrapolate some ideological meaning into the food.\n\nSeveral months ago, my friend sent me an article where the author did some data mining of Yelp in hopes of finding the best burrito in the country (http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/in-search-of-americas-best-burrito/); it's an interesting read if you're a data nerd and love food. Long story short, El Farolito blew away the competition in the \"strenuous\" tests the author conducted. I made a mental note to visit someday, and because I don't frequently visit the heart of the Mission, someday was more in the \"someday over the rainbow\" sense than an actual plan. Fast forward to last night post beering, and my brain convinced me that I was hungry and I was due for a burrito epiphany.\n\nWalking in the Mission at 11:30 pm isn't one of the safest things to do in the world, but it's also not too bad. There's traffic on the street and almost nobody walking around, so you have clear path on the sidewalk without having to deal with cranky bums and drunk frat boys (or cranky frat boys and drunk bums). \n\nThe taqueria itself leaves a little to be desired in the organizational and cleanliness sense, but hey, that just adds to the flavor right? To give you a sense of the ambiance, our fellow patrons were: a couple of kids playing a Nintendo DS, a girl wearing a witch costume for funsies long before Halloween, a couple who parked their crotch rockets outside and were having a hard time figuring out how to sit in the booths with their constricting biker gear, and a bum asking people if we were going use our cups.\n\nIs the burrito heavenly? No. Should you listen to me despite the fact that I ordered a Super Veggie burrito and many people (falsely) believe that's not a good gauge for taqueria quality? YES. There's nothing to hide behind in a veggie burrito. You taste the quality and the seasoning of the ingredients. With fewer ingredients, you also get a chance to see how well they mix everything and wrap it up. All the ingredients tasted fresh and there was some flavor to everything, but mine had way too much sour cream that I had to counteract with salsa from the \"salsa bar\", which was actually very good. Is the burrito good and worth eating? Yep! Is it worth seeking out late at night? Depends on how hungry you are and how crazy you are about burritos.", "author": "Akash K."}

By far the best burrito I have ever had. \n\nMy group of friends and I rolled in after a long day of hiking and El Farolito was exactly what we needed, we ordered way more than we could finish. This could be blamed on the fact that the line wraps outside the door and you can see them making all the food through the glass only causing you to become hungrier in anticipation of what awaits you. I really wanted to try it all so we all got a burrito and some quesadillas to share. Caution: these burritos were huge, and stuffed with all kinds of goodness. The quesadillas were really good too but one burrito is more than enough.

However my review is one specific item - egg nachos. The first time I ordered the egg nachos was last year in September. (The egg nachos is only available if you order the super nachos.) When I saw that you can order egg instead of meat for the nachos I was perplexed. Egg on nachos? Is that possible? In the Chicago episode of \"No Reservations\" Anthony Bourdain commented, \"I'm an egg slut.\" I have to admit so am I. The eggs on the nachos are scrambled cover the whole nachos. The first time I had the egg nachos I thought it was the best nachos I ever had. \n\nHowever the more I ordered the egg nachos at El Farolito the less impressed I'm with this. First the eggs are scrambled and not sunny side up. I believe to accentuate the flavor of the egg nachos the eggs should be cooked either sunny side up or over easy. That way you can dip chips on the egg yolk. By using the egg yolk you don't need to add heavy items on the nachos such as guacamole and sour cream. The best example of using sunny side eggs on the nachos is at Bourbon Steak and Pub Grill at Levi's Stadium. I prefer the egg nachos at Bourbon Steak and Pub Grill than at El Farolito because the eggs are cooked sunny side up. Second reason I've been less impressed with the egg nachos at El Farolito is because the chips at El Farolito are those generic, factory-style tortilla chips and not the restaurant-style chips - the oily looking chips I like. I believe if you really want to incorporate the egg with the chips the chips needs to have quality and not a cheap imitation.\n\nIt's unfortunate but the eggs nachos at El Farolito has the potential to be its signature dish but falls short of achieving the potential.", "author": "Gerald R."}

As I write this, the competition is still in Round 1, so it remains to be seen if El Farolito can go wire to wire.\n\nNow, I'm no burrito connoisseur. I'm from Texas, where a good many Mexican-inspired dishes are done well. For sure, breakfast tacos, a foodie feat of genius that can hardly be found outside the Lone Star State. Of course, Tex-Mex, which basically means anything smothered in gravy and cheese. There's queso, which for parties is Velveeta and Ro-Tel, and it's amazing. And--ode to Texas 'cue--the incomparable barbacoa, best had in taco form. But ask me about getting a burrito in Houston, and I'll be sending you to Freebird's or Chipotle.\n\nI approached El Farolito with a ravenous mind to know more about what makes a burrito so great, and I left with the understanding that I'd just eaten the best burrito I've ever had thus far. \n\nWhat makes a great burrito? First, the tortilla. As the tortilla grew in size to fit all the ingredients of a massive mission burrito, it still had to retain taste and texture while providing firmness to said burrito.\n\nSecond, the rice. An understated part of the burrito, sure, but the Asian in me can by no means discount the importance of the burrito. It's a simple reason why Chipotle's burrito bests Freebird's (and yes, I know them's fighting' words). Now, I can't remember the taste of El Farolito's rice the way I can Chipotle's, but that was because of...\n\nThird, the binding. By that, I mean the other stuff that brings a burrito bite together. In El Farolito's case, the oozing deliciousness of cheese and sour cream and guac, all melded together to form perfect bite after perfect bite.\n\nFinally, the protein. That's meat and beans, and El Farolito's carne asada is just the type of divey, grilled Mexican awesomeness that tastes even better tortilla-ed. It's flavorful without being dry, seasoned without being overtly salty. It's a win.\n\nOf course, it never hurts to have some amazing salsa to slather on, and El Farolito's green sauce is some sinister stuff that you'd want to take home to Mama. The red sauce isn't bad, but the green is where it's at.\n\nPut it all together, and you have one heck of a burrito. It's so dang good I ran through it and didn't even have time to take a picture.

But the prices are completely reasonable given their fame. I've only recently jumped on this bandwagon so I can't attest to how good/bad the food was before, but considering that the number of times a week I crave a brick-sized carnitas burrito has quintupled, Farolito is a very satisfying safe choice whenever I'm in Mission. \n\nSo about that carnitas... And the carne asada, and lengua, and chorizo, and yes, even vegetarian options, are finger-licking delicioso. Literally finger-licking - there's probably no clean way to eat any of their wrapped food (if you're particularly clumsy like me, you might even end up with morsels in your water cup). In particular, their crispy tacos are prone to crumbling into a delectable mess. Bottom line: prepare the napkins. \n\nI'd advise trying one of the larger taquerias for your bathroom needs.

I honestly assumed that meant it was Mormon. 1 out of 10 of you will get that. \n\nAfter a day of snapping pics of the Golden Gate bridge (because tourists) we decided to swing by El Faro for an authentic Mission burrito. The Mission district itself smells like urine and beer. This might be the only part of the city without a Michelin Star restaurant. \n\nEl Faro is very tiny, very packed, and slighty dirty due to all the presumably drunk people devouring burritos and leaving crumbs everywhere. We ordered a couple Super Steak Burritos and sat down. A few minutes later, 2 massive burritos were delivered to us. I honestly think a large amount of the hype here is with the size of the burritos. They pack the burritos with meat, rice, and beans which makes them uber filling. My only problem with that is you pretty much are only eating meat and rice and beans. I tasted no cheese, sour cream, or avocado whatsoever. So while it was a good burrito, it was not particularly balanced. \n\nWe walked by La Taqueria which had a line out the door, so perhaps we will check them out next time.

Like any good burrito joint, diners get a choice of flour, whole wheat, or spinach tortilla and black, refried, or whole beans.\n \nCorn tortilla chips ($0.65) are crisp and not greasy. The carne asada super burrito ($6.75) is truly epic in size. With just a hint of smokiness, the steak was perfectly cooked. The ratio of rice to beans to meat was perfect. The salsa was piquant enough, but real fire breathers will certainly want to take the heat up a notch. The only nit was perhaps slightly too much sour cream. \n\nThere is a salsa bar with at least three different sauces: pico de gallo, an avocado-based sauce, and a spicier red pico de gallo. All are good, but would not win the salsa competition at the state fair.\n\nThere is a choice of Mexican sodas and other soft drinks, as well as numerous domestic and imported beers.

Good enough but didn't wow. 3/5.\n\nLengua tacos: filled to the brim with meat, juicy and perfectly cooked!!! Way better than the burrito. The best lengua I've had so far!!! 5/5\n\nOverall it's a solid spot, tables are pretty gnarly but the salsa bar and tacos made up for it.

The quesadilla is stuffed with sooo much cheese which was awesome! And the carne asada was salty, but very flavorful. The burrito was good. It was enormous and really filling. It didn't strike me as anything particularly special though. I drowned it with avocado salsa to add more flavor.\n\nOne thing that makes this place awesome is the prices! Everything is so cheap.

Ordering can be a little intimidating due to the two long lines snaking around the counter but trust me, it's worth it. My friend and I split two super burritos, one pastor and one asada (about $8 each). The juiciness and sheer volume of the pastor immediately jumped out at me through the burrito's thick layers. The perfectly spiced, tender meat wasn't overpowered by the bulk of the beans and rice and went perfectly with the creaminess of the sour cream and avocado. The carne asada had a noticeably tougher and drier texture but was still tasty. The flour tortilla was soft and toothsome, which complemented the burrito's contents nicely. I would recommend the salsa verde for its sharp but not unbearable spiciness; the salsa roja was good but not amazing, while the pico de gallo tasted rather dull to me.\nEven for someone with as hearty of an appetite as myself, finishing an entire burrito was a challenge.

But one easy way to spot one is by looking at the lines. And expect to wait when you visit El Farolito. The seating arrangements are tight and limited and lines can stretch outside along the sidewalk. \n\nOnce I finally reached the cashier I placed my order. Two super burritos, one with cabeza and the other with carne asada and a side order of tortilla chips. Luckily after I ordered our food my girlfriend spotted an open table, which we quickly pounced upon. \n\nAfter we were settled I hopped on over to the salsa bar. There were 3 different sauces, pico de gallo, an avocado cilantro sauce and a spicier red pico de gallo sauce. All three were delicious, but my favorite was the avocado sauce, which was also the least spiciest. The chips were decent, not as greasy as thought, possibly baked. \n\nWhile we were munching on the chips and salsa our burritos finally arrived to our table. First things first, the burritos here are huge, and for less than $7 dollar a pop you'll surely be pleased. Now the taste test. After my first bite I was instantly pulled by the wonderful flavors of avocado, sour cream, rice, frioles (beans), onions, cilantro, and that wonderful head meat known as cabeza. I knew then that El Farolito was no joke.\n\nOverall if I had to grade my first visit to El Farolito I'd without a doubt give this place a solid A.

No guacamole here, by the way, only avocado.\n\nI finished it really quickly, and I can definitely say it was a yummy meal to fill my empty stomach.

I absolutely love this place. I come here at least once a week and during final week at school, every day. My favorite is the classic Chicken Super Burrito. For $7 something you get a huge burrito with plenty of meat and stuff to keep you full for an entire day. Not that I am too cost conscious, but I do want to point out their value proposition.\n\nThe food is merely perfect, I have no complaints whatsoever. Because I love this place so much, I am willing to disregard 2 downsides:\n\n1, Location - you know Mission & 24th isn't the best neighborhood of San Francisco, and I certainly do not recommend walking around this area at night time. Not the restaurant's fault though.\n\n2, hygiene - again not the restaurant's fault. The place is quite dirty, but that's because there is always a long line, out the door so there's no way to clean up when customers are standing right next to you. \n\nI highly recommend El Farolito to all Mexican food enthusiasts and/or to everyone coming to San Francisco. This is a must visit place y'all.", "author": "Dave N."}

I got a super burrito with carne asada and no sour cream, and it was awesome! The meat was so flavorful and I was super impressed that they used actual avocado, not guacamole (or worse, guacamole paste). The fresh avocado added so much more flavor. The burrito was way too big, it's enough to eat one and last you for the rest of the day. The salsas were pretty good too though not extraordinary. But, really delicious burrito. This place gets crowded during lunch time so it's probably better to take to-go, but if you're willing to wait you'll probably be able to snag a table! $8.43 post-tax for the burrito is a bit high, but considering the great portions, it's definitely fine.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-06", "description": "When the drunks get hungry, the hungry goes to El Farolito. \n\nThis taqueria has become the top of its class amongst the late night Mexican joints in the Mission. The go-to choice for all the intoxicated and easily the most popular joint up and down the Mission for its crave-worthy Mexican food, presented in the most  greasiest and gluttonous glory, is a sight to behold. Truth is, you don't have to be drunk to appreciate El Farolito. You just have to be hungry. Really hungry.\n\nMeaning \"The Little Lantern\" in Spanish, this tiny place lights up the corner of 24th and Mission, and can command a crowd that lines up from the moment it opens till the wee hours of the morning. People say El Farolito is cheap, but it's really on par price wise with its taqueria vecinos (neighbors). Prices have steadily gone up to as much as $11 for a special shrimp burrito ($10.95 la combination super con camerones), but for the most part a decent meal can be had for under $10.\n\nEl Farolito is the essence of Mission style Mexican cuisine. Hearty portions, giant size worthy items (i.e. super), with a heart clogging heaping of sour cream, avocado, and salsa, with just about every item. Super burritos make regular burritos look silly, as do super quesadillas, and super nachos compared to their normal sized selves. Mexican food lovers be they purist or glutton, owe it to themselves to try this interesting regional variety of the cuisine.\n\nThe late night hour is the most popular one, which for all intents and purposes is essentially the rush hour of drunk food. Tables are small and availability is limited. With a little luck and patience, people eventually find a seat, since most meals are consumed about as easily as they're assembled. The air of grease is no mistake and for many worshipers of this establishment is the perfect ambient odor to dine in.\n\nMy personal advice when coming here? Don't hold back. That carnitas burrito platter that you love but are too afraid to order? Get it. Fear the subsequent gas from the super platter of nachos? Eat it any way. I promise it will be delicious. Coming here to eat a taco salad is practically an insult to the folks who have sacrificed their well being just to eat here for a hot minute. Get the special burrito I mentioned earlier, which has the makings of a carnitas burrito, stuffed with egg, shrimp that pan fried in butter, to produce one of the most amazing burritos that even a Biggest Loser contestant would kill for. Folks who are into the alternative animal parts have their pick of sesos (brains), cabezas (head meat), even ojos (eyes) on occasion. And trust me when I say *all of it* is fantastic.\n\nDrunks instinctively know this is the king of all late night junk food; the kind that subdues the inebriation and stimulates the taste buds; the one thing that many people in SF look forward to any night of the week when the city goes dark. Anyone who has had the pleasure of eating here is certain to miss it the moment they leave town.", "author": "Jando S."}

You only get my endorsement, San Francisco, because you're so progressive and tolerant that it translates to having every doorstep in your city smell like a gangrene toe wrapped in a piss-soaked tortilla.\n\nEl Farolito is the ultimate drunk stop that reeks of putrid, human shit and I certainly was one among the masses because I visited El Farolito five or six cocktails in and thought it would be a superb idea to stuff a cannon-sized burrito after a massive dinner of cajun/creole food plus dessert.  I aim to frighten. \n\nI, myself, sampled their vegetarian burrito and nachos that they top off with 3 fried eggs.  I enjoyed the nachos more than I enjoyed the vegetarian burrito; however, I ate a good portion of both.  I ate so much I could taste the nacho and burrito combination into the next week in my sleep.\n\nEverything they make, they make it big.  The burrito was an impressive two-hander filled with beans, rice, avocado, and sour cream.  It could have used a little more salt, but otherwise, I devoured it.  A similar topping was on the nachos, too, with the addition of eggs and now I hate all nachos.  It simply does not compare.  The degree of generosity that I saw on my plate made me want to cry. \n\nYou only eat here because you're inebriated, going through cocaine withdrawals, or you have no standards.  It's one of the few places around Mission open past midnight and everyone becomes equally unattractive.  I like El Farolito's stinky ass charm and the fact that they keep drunken, hangry people like myself off the streets.", "author": "Whitney B."}

I am so in love with this place, it's not even fair. \n\nWe were trying to find a Mexican place open on a Sunday, took to Yelp (naturally), and I picked the first place that came up in my search and had ~4.75 stars -- El Farolito. What I didn't pay attention to was the location, it was about 2.5 miles from our hotel so we cabbed the ride there. On our way down Mission, we slowly enter the Mexican 'hood. The streets were crowded, the storefront misleading. I thought, hey, I guess this place must be legit if all the locals are here. The line was almost out the door, but we were quick to make it to the cash register. I opted for the tacos al pastor, which came out nearly 10 minutes later. We stuffed ourselves uncomfortably into a table meant for four, and then inhaled our food. My tacos were jam packed with pork, simply topped with cilantro and onions. I used the chips we got with our meal to dish up the fixings that fell from my tacos. Two filled me up no question. The pork was just spicy enough not to need any additional sauce and tasted like it was simmering forever. The line cooks were machines cooking up meat mountains on the flat top. I will be back. I will fly to San Fran just to eat more tacos.\n\nOh, and it seemed like a good idea to walk home after the amount of food we ate. ...It took us an hour.

I wish the menu clarified that the taco came with only one order even though it comes with two tortillas. Maybe a lot of Mexican restaurants do this and from my lack of experience with Mexican restaurants, I didn't know haha. Anywho, I got the carne asada and the al pastor which is marinated pork. The meal came with free chips which came to a surprise! El Farolito has a wide assortment of salsas you can choose from and the spicy salsa was my favorite! \n\nFinally my order came out and the tacos were filled with meat! The carne asada was the first taco I tried and it was okay! Nothing too special but it was delicious nonetheless. But oh my goodness...the al pastor.

Anyway the BF and I took the bus to the Mission and had little trouble locating El Farolito. They are right on the corner and there were a good amount of people in line so it wasn't difficult to spot. We walked in and looked at the menu for a bit which was enormous and had so many different choices. I mean they had calf head and calf brains as an option.. whoa. We decided to try the tacos: I got an order with chicken and carne asada and he had an order with lengua and chorizo. I was under the impression that the tacos were 2 for $2.25 but for some reason the guy charged us $2.25 for EACH taco. I guess I misread the sign.\n\nWe also ordered some chips (50 cents) which were delicious with the all you can eat salsa bar. That green avocado salsa is legit, we ate so much of that I stopped counting the cup-fulls lol. Service is quick but the guy calls out the numbers in spanish (then in english later haha) so be prepared. The tacos are big and STUFFED with meat so in the end I didn't feel as ripped off. I wouldn't recommend getting the chicken because it was a bit dry but the carne asada was really yummy. However, the winner out of the four meats was the LENGUA (beef tongue). This lengua was the softest, tenderest, yummiest lengua I have ever eaten, I would definitely come back for that. \n\nAs we were walking out I saw the chef cooking the meat on the grill and I saw him constructing a massive burrito which looked so delicious.

However, there is a wait usually so don't turn around simply because you see a few people out the door. My group was lucky to arrive with ample time just before the bars closed. We waited no more than 20-25 minutes for food, which I have to say was worth every second. \n\nAll of us were new to the joint and without really brushing up on the menu beforehand we ordered the Super Burrito (two w/ beef, one w/ chicken, and a veggie). They have three different salsas and containers to take on the go. The seating area itself was full with no available tables, so I would suggest having a friend go ahead to try and find a table while your party waits in line.

I've always been a skeptic of Mexican food, but I straight-up demolished my al pastor super burrito in 15 minutes and loved every second of it. Crispy but tender pork with just the right amount of fat, perfectly seasoned rice and beans, lots of spicy guac, and fresh veggies. All for much less $$ than Chipotle. You West Coast people sure are spoiled rotten. I tried all of their salsas from their salsa bar with my burrito, but honestly it was fine without anything at all. My friend lives in Mission, and this is a regular stop for him, both right after work and at 2AM after a night at the bar. We asked him for the best burrito in his neighborhood, and he brought us here. If you're in Mission, don't miss out on a truly terrific burrito experience here.", "author": "Katie H."}

I usually eat them when I'm drunk, but when in SF I figured I have to try out some good ones. I've been to Taquiera Cancun a couple of times, and I must say I've been largely unimpressed by them.\n\nFirst thing I noticed is this place is a complete dive, it looks very unclean and all the tables are dirty. Eating out will greatly enhance your experience. I decided to ignore the kitchen for my own sanity. The cleanliness lost it a whole star, unfortunately.\n\nRegarding the Burrito itself though, it was absolutely unbelievable! So delicious and well put together. I find in Taquiera Cancun they tend to go a bit mad with the avocado, and it completely overpowers everything else. Not so at El Farolito!

With that said, I dd NOT catch the part about it being cash only, which created the situation that had me giving 4 stars instead of 5 here.\n\nFirst and foremost, had no idea it was as much of a fast food spot as it is, but I get over that quickly. It's also easy to see just how popular this place is as my gf and I came in late around 10:30pm and there was a steady line to the door that did not diminish in the hour plus we were there. \n\nOnly issue I encountered was during the ordering process, immediately after realizing they were cash only, as I only had $20 on me at that point. Was going to order the enchilada dinner, a super burrito and an order of the regular tacos. However, the guy misheard/misunderstood me when I said 2 of the regular tacos, and mistook that for 2 orders of 2...which of course drove the total to JUST over $21, leaving me staring at my money like uh, I don't have enough sorry. He quickly became irate and complained that he'd already \"pressed the button\", to which I said sorry and that I did not have enough money. He huffed and puffed and stood there looking peeved for 15 seconds then finally, miraculously, hit another button which took off that tacos! imagine that, it wasn't his first day there after all *whew*\n\nGetting our order took a while due to how busy they were, and the place was pretty dingy and rundown and 0 atmosphere...but I wasn't there for that, especially since I was starving. In short, the super burrito just about changed my life, and I'm super glad I didn't have enough cash for the tacos as there's no way I could've put them down after taking down the monster that was the burrito. Their regular salsa tasted fresh with just the right amount of heat, and the green one (tasted guac based?) was epic, I couldn't get enough of it.\n\nI'd def come back again to try other stuff, and this time with plenty of cash in hand so as not to confuse their cashiers.", "author": "Wayne Z."}

As usual, there was a long line of people waiting to get food at EL FAROLITO. I asked for what I usually get at burrito places - carne asada burrito, no rice add extra hot sauce, jalape\u00f1os and pico de guillo. although they are busy they are usually fast - however this time I had to wait, and wait and wait.\nso while waiting I went over to the salsa bar to get extra goodies for my burrito. I tried all of the hot sauces and the pico de gallo. They were all decent but nothing outstanding. Not one of the sauces was very picante (aka hot) and none were mild - just 3 middle of the road hot sauces - I was surprised by how much the quality had dropped since I last ate here in the sauce department.\nAt long last my burrito arrived and I eagerly bite into the burrito expecting a nice tender but firm beef that was well spiced mixed together with flavorful beans surrounded by hot sauce intermixed with pico de gallo and occasional small bits of jalape\u00f1o.\nWOW was I ever wrong - what I got was a carne asada burrito  in which the beef was tough as shoe leather and tasteless - I really didn't get much out of the beef - it was tough, tasteless and no spices - I'm think WTF? This is the worst beef I've had in a burrito since - well I can't recall having such over cooked and no spices - the beans were there and ok.  incredulously, there was NO hot sauce,  NO pico de gallo and NO jalape\u00f1os in my burrito - so if was fortunate that I stocked up on sauces an jalape\u00f1os at the salsa bar - they were needed to make this burrito eatable.\n\n------------------- bottom line -----------------\n\nthis burrito was by far and above the worst burrito I've ever had in the mission - in fact it is almost the worst burrito I've ever had in my life. perhaps they mixed up my order with somebody else's order - but no matter - there are too many good places in the Mission - and all over California and the rest of the western states in which I can easily get a better burrito so it will be some time before I go to \nel farolito -", "author": "Mark H."}

Maybe it's because I ate quesadillas for every meal for 3 days straight when I was a kid, but I'm slowly pushing myself to enjoy tortillas once again. No lie, 2500+ reviews with an average of 4.5 stars is incredible! In addition, it's also open until 3:30am so how could i possibly  overlook this place. \n\nMy first impression upon driving by this place (to find parking) is that I must be in the wrong place; the streets were a little sketchy and there were a few bars located here and there. Honestly, this wasn't how I was planning on ending my Friday night. Anyways, after finding parking a little down the block, I make my way towards the bright yellow sign that say 'El Farolito'.\n\nSimilar to my first impression, I swear I was in the wrong place. The restaurant itself looked super cramped; the seating area and the counter were literally an arms-length away.There was a decent line ahead of us when we got there, but this gave us ample time to look at the menu. I wasn't sure what I wanted at the time so as always, I turned to yelp. To my surprise, at least 5 of my friends have written a review here and I pretty much trust their recommendations.\n\n**Cash Only**\n\nAfter the cashier gave me my number, me and my friends quickly grabbed the last table before someone else could. While waiting, I needed to wash my hands since I ended up ordering a carne asada super burrito. First of all, the bathroom area was so weird; it pretty much felt like I entered a cave that had sinks built into the walls. Even better, you have to open this huge metal door to enter the bathroom.\n\nAnyways, our orders were finally brought to us by one of the staff that literally paced the restaurant shouting orders #'s. No lie, my super burrito was HUGE. Quantity is one thing, but what I'm really looking for is quality. Let me tell you, I literally ate dinner 2 hours before I came here and my first few bites were still delicious despite not being hungry. El Farolito can easily be considered my #1 burrito spot in NorCal. \n\nOverall, the location is a little sketchy, the ambiance is pathetic, the service is alright, but the food is amazing & cheap!

I was instructed to go grab a super burrito, super nachos, and a super quesadilla. Instead I got a super burrito with shrimp, a super burrito with cabesas (cow head meat), and the super nachos. My sister worried this would not be enough food for 3 people, this place proved her very wrong.\n\nThe best words to describe the explosion of flavor in my mouth are way too graphic to use on Yelp, so the best I can do is AMAZE-BALLS.

We threw in the white flag with most of the plate of super nachos left, and some extra scraps of tortilla and beans from the burritos. I'm actually glad this place isn't near where I live because I'd put on some heavy duty weight. Everything tasted soooo fresh and there were entire slices of avocado! I wouldn't be surprised if there was an entire avocado for each dish we ordered. There was a giant piece of shrimp in every bite, and the cabesa meat was so melt-in-your-mouth tender. It was like a perfect fusion of tortilla, beans, rice, meat, sauce, avocado, and whatever kind of crack they put into their food. The place seemed super authentic because they call out the order number in Spanish before English...and there was a guy playing some guitar as we ate. Most of the clientele seemed to be Spanish-speaking so that's always a great sign when eating ethnic foods. And at $6.25 per super burrito and nachos, and $9.95 for the shrimp super burrito, this was super cheap and a great deal. Every bite after I was already stuffed brought a tear to my eye because I knew it had to end soon =,,''(\n\nUnfortunately, my sister got food poisoning, most likely from the salsa station as that was the only thing she ate differently.

No one cares that you had one drink too many, or that you're stuffing your face silly at some ungodly hour because they're all doing the same thing. And you know what? You couldn't have picked a better place. \n\nEl Farolito is the grandaddy of all burritos. I'm talking size -- these babies are huge. I have yet to finish one on my own. I'm talking flavor - ayayay that carne asada! And the sesos! And the salsa! I'm talking everything else -- all its ingredients are well-proportioned so you get a little bit of everything coming together for that perfect bite. I always get a half-carne asada, half-sesos (brain) super burrito so I get that extra creamy texture from the sesos, sour cream, avocado, and cheese. Muy muy bien! \n\nIt's not the cleanest looking place, but I only have eyes for that burrito.

Items included carne asada both in super burrito form and quesadilla suiza.\n\nThe burrito came with pinto beans by default and these were very much mediocre.  The steak itself was reasonably well charred and seasoned, but none of the ingredients tasted particularly fresh and after a couple bites...nothing stood out.  Summarily, it was a run-of-the-mill burrito and a pricy one at that at nearly $7.\n\nThankfully, the quesadilla was nicely done and worth ordering again.  Head to head, however, I'd much rather take La Victoria (also lovingly known as La Vic's) in SJ as their burritos and quesadillas are vastly superior even without any hint of \"orange sauce\".  Even the hidden gem in San Leandro that is Taqueria El Gordo blows this place away...for less money.\n\nOn the upside, the staff are great and very friendly in this divey joint.\n\nWho knows...maybe the folks here try harder during the late night rush?", "author": "Eric F."}

It's also not exactly the cleanest place and it's not exactly in the nicest area so you're bound to see some interesting folks inside now and then.\n\nWe both got super carne asada burritos and an order of regular nachos to share. I also got the strawberry aguas frescas to drink while my friend got horchata.\n\nWe got the regular nachos and our drinks first. The nachos were a bit of a disappointment considering there was a ton of sour cream and a lack of salsa, cheese, and avocado. They gave us our chips kind of delayed I guess because the chips were soggy-ish. We finished eating it but....we didn't actually like it. \n\nWe liked our drinks though. They give you a lot for what you pay for. I really suggest getting the strawberry drink when you go! It's refreshing and goes well with your food.\n\nThe burritos were a lot better. I love the tortilla they use! The carne asada was so tasty and flavorful. We were full from the nachos so I took mine home to eat later. Even when it's cold, it's really good!

Came here around 3 AM on a Sunday morning after a long night of clubbing and this place was PACKED!! There was a line outside the door and every single table inside was taken! I looked around at what others had ordered and decided on the regular steak burrito ($5.75 and includes rice, light brown beans, and salsa). (Their SUPER Burrito--which comes with sour cream, cheese, Mexican rice, light red kidney beans, salsa, and avocado-- is pretty HUGE and only $6.75! Comparable to a Chipotle burrito!) I suggest omitting either the beans or rice and adding more salsa! You can even order a side of nachos for only $0.69!\n\nThe wait wasn't that long either. Since everything is pre-made the workers are able quickly put everything together so max waiting time--from the end of the line to receiving our food--was around 15 minutes! Their salsa is SOOO DELICIOUS!!! Not too spicy but has enough kick in it to make you wish you would have gotten more before you left! (Similar to Chipotle's salsa) My friend swears by their green sauce (avocado based) but since I don't care for avocado I didn't try it :( There's also another, darker red, sauce they offer but it looks pretty spicy! Their food is definitely a 5/5!!\n\nThis is a \"hole in the wall\" establishment so don't expect much from a cleanliness perspective (i.e. they fill their water bin with tap water, there are no food covers so bugs may or may not be in your food, salsa is self-serve...enough said, and workers don't have time to bus tables due to the high volume of people during the late night hours so you'll have to wipe down your own table--I recommend just taking it to-go!). Unfortunately, for cleanliness, I'd give them a 1/5!\n\nOverall, A MUST TRY!!!! Their burritos are AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS!! A super burrito can probably be shared between two people and if you don't care for burritos they also have a lot of other items to choose from! (You can view their online menu here: http://www.elfarolitoinc.com/) I saw a couple order their carne asada nachos and they were HUGE!!

I came here with a friend at night for a late night snack and as we drove closer and closer to the place, it got more sketchy so it seemed a little creepy. People just walk across the streets when they are drunk and are super careless. I would just be super careful around there.\n\nThe wait was super long and shot out the door. It was about a 30 minute wait and as you get closer to ordering, you can see the people make their massive burritos. You will notice a lot of drunk people here who need something to munch on after going out since this place opens super late. Their quesadillas looked so legit but I had my heart set out on the carne asada burrito with avocado. They pretty much use half an avocado for each burrito which is pretty legit. THE BURRITO IS HUGEEEE. I only had 1/4 of it and I was super full. I couldnt even taste the avocado because there was so much stuff in the burrito that distracted me. \n\nThis place is a pretty good place to get your burrito.

After doing a little research, my fiance and I decided this was going to be our burrito destination in SF. El Farolito is often listed as one of the best burritos in SF, so this was our treat after a 20+ mile bike ride around the city checking out tourist sites.\n\nThe place is a bit of a hole in the wall, cash only, with counter service. I ordered the super burrito with carne asada. My fiance opted for the chile relleno burrito, plus we got some chips. There was a salsa bar as well, so we had lots of sauce options. The chips were the most disappointing part - mostly because they're just regular plain chips, nothing exciting and I don't believe they were made fresh (just didn't seem like it). But who cares about chips when your burrito arrives and it's the size of your arm? \n\nLiterally, my burrito was the size of my forearm. It was by far the best burrito I've ever eaten. Embarrassingly, I love Chipotle. And this isn't even in the same class as Chipotle. Every single component, from rice, to beans, to the real star - the carne asada - was fantastic. I was only able to eat half, then I wrapped up the rest and took it with me for a snack on the plane. I've been dreaming of this burrito since we left SF and wish we could get something even remotely similar here in DC.\n\nI didn't try any other burritos in SF, so I can't say it's *the best*. However, I can say that I'll return every time I'm in SF, and maybe even make a weekend trip across the country specifically for this burrito haha.

Get in, queue up, order, pay (cash only), eat (if you can find a table) and get out.

Of the four I had (polo, carne asada, chorizo and al pastor) the chorizo and carne asada were by far the most flavorful (and the only two fully consumed by meals end). The toppings were fresh and crisp, the meat was hot and well-seasoned, the tortillas tender yet robust, and the salsas were faboosh, to boot. Accompanied by a huge cup of horchata (that is by far the best I have EVER had, and I lived in San Diego for a spell), I was in Mexi-heaven.

I was all set on going to Taqueria Cancun but something in me wanted a change from the average Mexican drunk food at Cancun. After scouring Yelp for a new taqueria after the ball game, Yelp pointed me to El Farolitio. Over 2400 reviews and a near perfect five stars means something is be done right at El Farolitio. Oh, and El Farolito's late-hours helps tremendously. \n\nUnlike Cancun which seems to be known for their burritos, particularly the burrito mojado, El Forolito seems to be fire on all cylinders as everyone raves, well, about everything. I took to my standard taqueria taste test, which is three tacos: carne asada, al pastor, and pollo asado. Tacos come on two soft corn tortillas with tomato, onion, cilantro, and salsa, at $2.25 a pop. My fellow foodie ordered an al pastor torta, served on a roll with refried beans, tomato, cheese, sour cream, and avocado. A basket of chips ran us $0.50. \n\nAlthough cramped, it's nothing like Cancun, as you're given your own tables and not forced to share commune style. Better yet, I spotted a public restroom! Even better are the two sinks located outside of the bathroom, which saves you from waiting on the bathroom. As we waited, we stocked up on the salsas as its an unlimited salsa bar! I can take one or as many as I desire for my chips and tacos. There's nothing I hate more than being given 2 tiny salsas for an entire meal. Oh, and the basket of chips? Very generous. More than enough for me and my +1.\n\nLess than 10 minutes later our number was being called. We were given a plate of three well made tacos and a delicious looking sandwich, undoubtedly one of the better looking tortas I've seen in a long time. Unlike many other taquerias, I was able to distinguish the three different meats I ordered. Pollo asado was up first, followed by the carne asada and lastly the al pastor. The tacos all shared similar qualities: flavorful, tender, and grilled perfectly. Each taco had its own flavor and could not be mistaken for one another. Similarly my friend's torta was by far one if not the best Mexican sandwich I could have tasted. The roll was toasted to perfection with cheese and then loaded up with meat with melted cheese and loaded up with veggies. \n\nEl Farolito is by far one of my best finds in the Mission. Given it was a Friday night at 10:30pm, it wasn't a drunk hipster takeover, but rather normal people trying to get good food on the cheap. The cooks were going about their job with steady procession and kept the line moving like pros and were never rude or unfriendly. Also, it's location next door to the 24th Mission BART couldn't be any more convenient. As we began to make our way out, the line was out the door, and with good reason, its a five star taqueria.

The service is quick and table turnover is fast. I always get a super burrito with everythin' with either steak (carne asada) or pastor (marinated pork). Price is cheap for a huge burrito. Full of flavor and put an end to my protein craving. To add to the mix I always order an horchata to go with my burrito. This cinnamon rice drink is down right sweet and delicious. If you add spicy sauce to your burrito and in the case your tongue is burning, horchata is perfect to cut the spiciness. Chips are another $.50 I think which is not bad at all.

I got the carnitas super burrito and was able to try my bf's shrimp ceviche which he thought was really good.\n\nMy carnitas super burrito was good but I felt it was missing something. Something saucy. It was a bit dry to be honest. It had sour cream, cheese, avocado, rice and beans. Luckily, there were big pots of self serve salsa. There was a red salsa which was okay and a green salsa which I absolutely LOVED. It was fresh, not really spicy and went perfectly with their burrito. I think if it wasn't for the green sauce this place would only be getting a 3 star rating. It doesn't get 5 stars maybe because I had high expectations for the \"Best Burrito in America\" but it was still pretty good. I still believe there is a better burrito out there.

That pretty huge hype to come in with, and in some cases a detriment if you can't live up to it, even if only slightly short.\n\nYou can tell right from when you entered this place was gonna be good. Right by the door you see a man grilling and chopping up meats, stream/smoke going everywhere. The smell alone was amazing. Just a note: when I went there was a bit of a line and seating was hard to find. I never consider this a detriment in a place like this (in fact it's a good sign), but a little FYI and prepare to take it to-go. \n\nBack to the hype. Did it live up? Yes and no. I can't knock anything about the burrito itself. Every ingredient not only tasted good, it was about as top-notch as I could imagine it. Burrito is stuffed with ingredients (as a Mission-style one should), but a good ratio. Rice doesn't overpower meat. Meat is juicy and so good. Tortilla has the perfect blend of chewy yet crunchy on the outside. \n\nBut the one downside? I felt the salsa bar was a little lacking and salsas can really make or break a burrito for me - especially a thick, dark-red, hot salsa. If I could take it to-go and combine with a salsa of my choice from some other of my favorite joints, I may agree best burrito no question. Of course it's no hard task to take it home and combine with salsa of your choice but this will have to knock it for a perfect 5 for me (I'd do 4.5 if I could).\n\nStill, this is definitely a must visit. If on a road trip, maybe hit San Jose first, buy a bottle of that awesome orange sauce from La Victoria, and bring it when you visit Farolito. I definitely will try that next time, and I wouldn't be surprised if nothing could top that.", "author": "Lawrence S."}

The toppings are excessive, so you can always order more chips (for an extra fee) or use them to top whatever you order.\n\nRandom side note: I saw an older Korean couple eating here (chicken fajitas and some sort of enchilada). I don't know how they found out about it, but if there's an older Korean couple eating at a Mexican restaurant (amidst the hipsters and actual Mexicans), I can confidently say that the food here has mass appeal.", "author": "Michelle K."}

When La Taqueria recently won that \"Best Burrito in America\" write-up that's been going around, the Farolito fans held strong in vocalizing their support for their Mission haunt of choice. All right, we were convinced. \n\nUsually my go-to meat in Mexican restaurants is carnitas, but with everyone raving about the asada, I ordered that. Amusingly, they brought me a carnitas super burrito. I assume because it was rather loud in there, \"carne asada\" sounded like \"carnitas.\" I didn't bother to correct it when the guy showed me how the order was taken down and accepted the pork instead. It was quite good. The tender, flavorful meat with lots of cheese, sour cream, and avocado really sparked the taste buds. The soft, chewy tortilla was also quite superior to most other places'. \n\nBrandon D. ordered the Boss Burrito, stuffed with shrimp and pork. It was pretty damn amazing. It's a bit steep for a hole-in-the-wall like this at $10 apiece, but it's definitely worth getting at least once. We were so full, we didn't need dinner that night. \n\nGetting a table can be competitive, but thankfully we came in just before the line started to drift out the door.\n\nAnd to speak of it being a dive... it is. If you want to complain about that fact, you might as well go to El Torito or, oh hell, the Olive Garden, for that matter.

They had the melted cheese outside, inside it was the meat and frijoles de la olla which I did not like. These kind of beans retain a lot of water which made my enchilada wet & runny(yuck).

Food that I've been missing and craving ever since I left San Diego and moved out to DC. So when my friend and I stopped over for lunch a few weeks back, I couldn't have been giddier to order my carne asada burrito, pour over my red and green salsas, and just go to town.\n\nIf there has to be a mark against El Farolito, it's that about an hour after I scarfed down my burrito, I felt like I had a brick of deliciousness lodged in my gut. Totally worth it though. Now if only they'd open up an El Farolito DC edition.", "author": "Andrew H."}

I always order a Carne Asada Super Burrito, which comes with generous amounts of rice, beans, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, salsa, cheese, sour cream, avocado, and of course MEAT.

It has to be because I swear I've seen that yellow formica in a museum somewhere. Or was it in the Mission? Maybe it was here. OK, full circle, now I'm back. Jamie was dying to try it since a Latina colleague of his insisted they make the best burritos in town. Fair enough assessment since it appears to draw all walks of life in here. Can such a cross-section of humanity be entirely wrong? \n\nTurns out they aren't as the food here is definitely a cut above a lot of the other tacquerias in the 'hood. Just don't expect much atmosphere unless you're looking to eat in the DMV because that's exactly how it feels with a long line waiting to order, a fluctuating crowd waiting to pick up their orders, and people trying to squeeze into any available table to have an actual dining experience. That would be Jamie W. and me as we secured a table adjacent to the line. \n\nLucky us. All of humanity was staring at us eat wondering if we ordered the right thing or concluding we were just dos homos in complete ignorance of what to order here. I think it was a combination of both starting with Jamie's $5.75 order of a Super Burrito with Marinated Pork (Al Pastor), a tasty mouthful that deserves its reputation of flavorful ingredients that they definitely don't skimp on(see photo). He also had a $1.95 Regular Taco with chicken (see photo) which he finished in quick order. \n\nMine was an actual dinner platter, the $7.75 Carne Asada, which consisted of thin, slightly overcooked slices of steak topped with grilled scallions accompanied by a side salad, refried beans, rice and four steaming tortillas (see photo). It was very good stuff especially as makeshift burritos with the scallions providing a nice crunch. I liked it, and I'll probably order it again. But please stop staring at me! \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...solid, consistent, no-frills Mexican is a touchstone for many in the Mission \nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...well, it ain't Gary Danko \nSERVICE - 3 stars...fast...and brush up on your espanol \nTOTAL - 4 stars...hard to beat for a hearty, fast-food deal in these parts and especially right outside the 24th Street BART station", "author": "Ed U."}

So disappointed.\n\nCame in here Sunday around noon for a super burrito, based on the yelp reviews and an article from 538 saying that this place has the best burritos. In America! As this was based on yelp data, I had to try it myself. Line was about 8 deep upon my arrival, and took about 10 minutes to get through to order. After that, another 5 minute wait, and a huge burrito was in my hand.\n\nBottom line up front: very average. It was good, but definitely not worth the praise. And definitely not near what I've had in San Diego. They were out of the carnitas (really.), so I ended up with a carne asada super burrito. The carne asada had good flavor at least. As for the \"super\" part, it included one small slice of avocado, and about a gallon of sour cream. Pretty weak if you ask me. The rest of the burrito consisted of a little cheese, and loaded with pinto beans and rice. Like- loaded. Way too loaded for my tastes.\n\nThe salsa bar was also lacking. The green salsa just didn't have any flavor, and the two reds were average at best. No pickled veggies either. One thing I love about California is the green salsa, but this place just doesn't do it very well.\n\nOverall, I'll give it 3 stars, based on the hope that the carnitas would have been better.

I'm not saying the burrito here wasn't good. It was indeed a tasty collection of ingredients wrapped in a toasty tortilla which makes a good and cheap (only $6-7 bucks for something that could fill two people).  I've heard numerous friends rave about the Mexican  food here, claiming superiority to San Diego joints. I've seen all the love heaped onto El Farolito by the internet media. All of this probably lead me down the dangerous slope of high expectations and ultimately disappointing.\n\nMy friend and I decided to hit up here and Taqueria Cancun back to back to compare the burritos. We got carna asada at both places. El Farolito had the better beans, which were creamier and better seasoned. They also had better salsas, which was spicier and more flavorful, and better tortilla, which was toasted and slightly chewy (I wish the tortilla was toasted more and crisper. Its one of the first things for a fantastic burrito for me). However, i thought the carna asada was a bit chewy and the flavors muddled by the liquid-y mush from the beans and meat. The weaker meat component makes a otherwise better burrito at El Farolito and brings it down to a tie with Taqueria Cancun. Maybe I need to try different meats at both places, as carna asada is a relatively boring protein choice. Carnitas, Al Pastor and Lengua are definitely in my future and SF MIssion burritos.\n\nOverall, I'd come to El Farolito again, but I'm not going  out of my way and I definitely be arguing that SD mexican food is better", "author": "Billy T."}

Super steak burrito with cheese, avocado, and loads of super tender steak all for less than $10 is incredible.

It's set right in the poor Mission area, so some might be moderately uncomfortable-- but you shouldn't be.

There are plenty of places to sit down: I usually go with a group of 5-10 friends and while other places have a hard time accommodating us, El Farolito never fails.\n3.

The food itself is only four stars: Sorry guys, but the carne asada isn't as flavorful as it could be. El Farolito doesn't compare to SoCal taquerias, its good but it doesn't match up.\n2.

It tasted pretty much like a more thin pickle, not really spicy at all, and I ended up eating the entire thing via refreshing bites interspersed throughout burrito-eating. \n\nAll in all, this place is a great bang for one's buck--or, a mere ~$5 for a regular burrito that fills one up for a record-breaking 8 hours.

I just don't usually like corn, including corn tortillas and corn chips, I can't eat refried beans, and there is never enough spice or flavor other than maybe cilantro, lime, and salt. That being said, every now and then I get in the mood for a burrito. It is just such a convenient meal.\n\nSo rather than going home after an event, I decided I wanted a burrito. Bad choice around Powell. I feel like I wandered for an hour trying to get into a decent restaurant. The only place I found with burritos said they had an hour wait. WTF is the deal around there? No burrito places? Psh. So I gave up, jumped on BART, and went to the Mission. The first thing I saw was El Farolito. I had heard others rave about it, and instead of debating about going to the first place I saw, I just walked right in. That was it.\n\nI got a vegan burrito, which is usually bland and a little boring, and a good challenge for a burrito place. I was expecting bland. NOOOOOOPE! There was no bland to be found in that burrito! The dang thing was huge, cheap, flavorful, and I am salivating just remembering how happy my mouth was while it was in my mouth. The guacamole was tops and the pico de gallo that I got at the salsa bar was some of the best pico de gallo I've had. I have no idea how, but I ate the whole thing in one sitting. I ordered the veggie burrito with no cheese and black beans. El Farolito es uno de mis favoritos! I'm glad I gave it a try.", "author": "Christopher L."}

I was not part of the local bar crowd, but a lone Mexican food loving tourist looking for some love. I found it.\n\nAfter walking around the mission district on a super cold evening, I stepped up to the line and quickly scanned the menu on the back wall and one thing stood out: SUPER BURRITO. It was just what I needed to warm my cold hands and heart. Even better, it was about $7\n\nWhile the feel of this location is a cross between a taco stand and very small restaurant, the tables turn over quickly and I was able to find a spot to sit. Since I was alone, I was shortly joined by an Indian painter discussing how often people mistake him as being Mexican. He mentioned this was one of his favorite places for post-bar noms and I totally get why.\n\nI listened to him discuss his inspirations as an artist and consumed one of the best burritos I've ever put in my mouth: the super burrito with the standard shredded chicken - the ingredients were simple and superbly executed. I slightly struggled to finish it, as the burrito was huge, but it was so delicious that I had no choice but to kill the entire thing.\n\nOne thing I really like about cal mex over tex mex is the use of avocados, whole beans and fresh ingredients. El Farolito was no exception and did not skimp. \n\nAlso, the clientele is super diverse and it was great for people watching.", "author": "Amy P."}

The BEST thing about this place is they use to stay open until 5am (ALL City natives know what I'm talking about) After the club, tired from dancing all night, hella hungry- El Farolito was the after hours grub spot.

I no longer like that competition of delicious meat juice vs. avocado and sour cream.

The carne asada though, was laden with gristly, inedible pieces in about 3 out of every 5 bites.  With the volume they serve, there's no reasonable way they could be trimming the fat off each piece but I really detest picking things out of my mouth mid meal and it reflected on my overall feelings about this burrito.  When I return, it won't be for carne asada anything.  \n\nThe place is a dumpy dive that's open way late.  There's a steady stream of interesting patrons to eyeball, a constant thwacking sound of cleaver hitting meat, and the feeling that you're in the midst of a vibrant, tight, dirty little hot spot.  There's tidier, quieter Mission district taquerias that serve equally good food (and better carne asada) but sometimes a real dive is all you want.  This is it.", "author": "Tracey A."}

I was here with a friend (no other patrons were in the restaurant). While my friend was in the bathroom, I turn my back for maybe 3 seconds to throw away my trash while an employee wiped down our table. He was hunched right over my bag that was still on the seat. I grab my bag and reach inside to check my phone. It's gone.\n\nI mention this to the manager who said SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED BEFORE. What?! I refuse to leave because I know someone working there has my phone. I sit and wait while my friend calls the police (they actually show up!). After about 15 minutes the manager says one of the employees said I should check the bathroom. I never went to the bathroom. Low and behold, my phone is lying on the ground next to the sink. Ringer turned off. The police arrive but since I got my phone back I decide not to do anything.\n\nThe manager gives my phone number to the corporate office - they can look at the tapes. Someone from the corporate office calls me the next day and accuses me of accusing one of the employees of being a thief. Well, when someone steals something out of your purse, it's THEFT. She goes on to suggest that maybe my friend stole my phone. Really? The one who was sitting in front of me the entire time? She says she's looking at the tape and sees us. She sees my friend get up and walk to the bathroom. And this is the point when the theft occurs... She says, \"Oh something is wrong with the tape. I can't see anything anymore.\" Basically that's when she's covering up the fact that she can SEE IT HAPPENING. She starts yelling at me and at that point I stopped listening.\n\nI applaud the manager for trying to help. Utter disgust for an employee who steals and a corporate office that would cover it up.\n\nI'd have more respect for them if corporate called me and said that they were very sorry for the incident but that they're glad everything worked out. I was okay with letting it go but instead they turned it around on me. That's completely unacceptable and vile.

El Farolito is an explosive star amongst ALL NYC taco establishments...even Los Hermanos. I came here 2 times during my SF trip, the first time, I stumbled in (no explanation needed) and the second time, was in the middle of the night on a weekday. There's something about their tacos that make them stand out. \n\nThe simplest of ingredients: the standard 2 corn tortillas, flavorful and light guacamole, no sour cream (which is why I keep a stash from Wendy's in my purse), meat that isn't over cooked and lightly seasoned, ample amounts of cilantro, chopped onions, hot sauce and finally, a spritz of lime. Less is more.\n\nThe tacos cost around $2.50 each. If you're a fatty like me, order 4 tacos for $10 and you'll roll away happy. Thank goodness for fast metabolisms or else I'd be disgusting by now. Really, really disgusting.\n\nNext on the agenda, burritos!", "author": "J R."}

My biggest frustration about ordering from this place is the language barrier.  I had one instance where I tried to place an order for pick up by phone which was literally impossible to complete.  I was hung up on a few times in the middle of the process.  \n\nWhen I attempted to complete the order through my wife who is fluent in Spanish, we still were unable to do so.  I recently placed a \"to go\" order at the establishment where I  included an orange / carrot juice as part of the order.  Perhaps I should have said \"naranja y zanahoria\", but that likely would have not produced the desired result.\n\nInstead of an orange / carrot juice mix, I received a carrot juice even when I asked repeatedly if this was an orange / carrot I was holding.  They acknowledged that it was what I had originally ordered.  It required me having to take a sip of the juice to confirm that it was carrot juice only.  I brought it up with the cashier who appeared to be flustered at the time.  \n\nRather then wait for them to complete the order to my satisfaction, I told them to forget it, and departed with my order \"as is\".  Just keep the language barrier in mind if you decide to frequent this establishment.  In most circumstances I would choose Chipotle over El Farolito, however Chipotle is not open as late.

We probably were there a total of 20 minutes or so.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to share:\n-Chips ($0.50): pretty plain, but I thought they were good.  They were crispy and I just wanted something to eat right away.  The salsas are pretty good- and spicy!\n-Super Suiza Quesadilla (about $7): this came as two huge pieces.  It was filled with plenty of meat (we chose al pastor/marinated pork), avocado, sour cream, salsa, and a fair amount of cheese.  I liked that it was cheesy, without being overly cheesy.  The tortilla was nicely grilled and this one order was plenty for both of us.  (They also have a \"Quesadilla para dos\", for about $11.

I came here for a work lunch with colleagues and was promised the most amazing Mexican fare. Unfortunately the amazing food took a back seat to the horrible smell of urine which permeated through the restaurant while we waited in line. I think if I had been by myself I would have turned around and left but being that I was with a group I felt awkward telling everyone we needed to leave immediately. Who's the weirdo who can't handle germs? (Point to self) So basically I held my breath while we stood in line and tried to figure out where the urine smell was coming from. We theorized someone had either peed on the ground inside the restaurant or they had left a bag of pee in a grocery bag by one of the tables near the door. I was too disgusted to further investigate the situation but hopefully someone can figure out this puzzling matter. \n\nWe did a group order and I got the two tacos for $2.50. Crazy cheap when you think about it, but again, I was completely emotionally scarred by the urine. We sat down and got our food pretty quickly. My friends devoured their burritos and I ate half my pork taco. Delicious, but again, it was all ruined by the urine. I'm sorry El Farolito fans who I've heard take bulk burritos home to freeze and eat later, but I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon to this Mexican haven in the Mission. I will most likely be avoiding all Mexican food for awhile until I've mentally recovered from the haunting memory of urine which continue to haunt me anytime I eat meat.

But I tend to push the limits of my stomach when it comes to trying new and potentially good food. Given my body's conditional state at that time, I may have rated this place lower than I would have if I was actually hungry...but anyways, on to the rest of the review.\n\nOrdered a super suiza quesadilla with the grilled chicken which was pretty good. The chicken was tender and I was pleased that it came with avocado. Anything with avocado gets automatic bonus points in my book. It was a tad bit on the salty side for me though. Portions are quite large. I'll probably be back to try some more of the menu, hopefully I'll have a bigger appetite next time.\n\nRestrooms here are tricky. It took us awhile to figure out that you had to be buzzed in. I stood in front of the bathroom door for a good chunk of time pulling at the handle thinking am I completely incompetent?! (I JUST saw someone go in and come out...I probably look like a fricken idiot right now.) Finally, when I was about to just give up, someone at the counter buzzed the door.", "author": "Kevin N."}

There's a bit of a wait but trust me, its completely worth it. While you wait, you can watch them grill the meats and roll burritos like machines. I came here and got the super carne asada burrito. They don't skimp on anything! Plenty of avocado, cheese, meat, and all that good stuff. I love that everything was seasoned and there wasn't too much rice. It was the perfect balance. My first bite into my burrito was seriously a foodgasm. The staff are super friendly and even gave us complimentary chips. They also have pretty bomb salsas especially the green one which I took plenty of containers home. I definitely wanted to finish my burrito even though I felt like bursting. It was that good. The only problem with this place is that it's very narrow and not a lot of seating so have your friends scout out tables while you get their orders!\nOverall, love this place.

My friend visited El Farolito over the summer and highly recommended their super burrito. When I messaged my friend asking for the name of this place, I added, \"is there a bathroom?\" AND THERE WAS!!!! tbh if there wasn't a bathroom, we probably would have gone somewhere else. We went in with empty stomachs, full bladders, and left completely satisfied. There was a long line that went by quickly. (THE BEST KIND OF LONG LINE) We were lucky to snag a table, which is not easy here. I remember there were five of us, we all got super burritos with different variations, and one person, the only male in the group devoured the whole thing while the rest of us ladies ate maybe half. For SF, the price was awesome! Great neighborhood to be in, in the less gentrified part of the Mission.

I too decided to check out this place based on the 538 burrito competition, and it was about on par with burritos I've had in West LA, and nothing compared to East LA. Actually, I think I had a better burrito in Palo Alto the other day.\n\nIt's not a bad burrito, don't get me wrong, there's just nothing special about it. I think the high number of stellar reviews can be attributed to the fact that the reviewers are drunk when they eat here.\n\nBeyond the mediocrity of the burrito, the salsa is bland and comes in mild or mild. The chips are the type of yellow corn tortilla chips you can buy for $1 at the grocery store, and they cost extra.\n\nI also couldn't help but notice the distinct smell of urine as I entered.

Too sober, perhaps, but at least you can expect this to be an review unbiased by the effects of liquor! Normally a fan of variety, I have, for some reason, always ordered a super burrito, albeit with varying meat fillings. Like Chipotle, there's just something about the flavoring of the rice here that I like too much to skip - this is perhaps telling then, that I don't drop by here too frequently.\n\nHaving ordered it so often, it should be obvious that their burritos are super tasty. And beyond filling too, as a super burrito easily lasts me three meals - kudos to those of you who finish it in a single gut-busting sitting though! And, having stolen food from friends before, I can also say that their super shrimp suizas are also incredibly tasty - the only thing preventing me from ordering it more often is the lactose-intolerance.\n\nNear the 24th St BART station, expect this area to be a little bit sketchier. And while there's always a line here, it moves pretty quickly, so never fear. Getting a table is sometimes a bit more difficult though, especially for those in wheelchairs: the aisle is incredibly narrow, so expect to block off most of it if you decide to seat yourself somewhere.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Behind the counter, employees are working hard and working fast to get you what you need. My first time (sadly, my only time), the guy who took my order just looked exasperated as I stood salivating over the wonderful production line (way better than Ford could ever have put together) they had going.

My bf preferred the burrito over the tacos, and I vice versa... The burrito came heavy with rice, beans, and sour cream; the pastor came in large and tender chunks but seemed to be unfortunately *very lightly* marinated, or just overall lost within the mess of rice/beans/sour cream. Overall, the al pastor was just bland compared to what I'm used to in SoCal and the burrito, though large and beastly, lacked any distinctive flavors imo. I liked the tacos much better, likely due to the absence of rice/beans/sour cream. Of the tacos, the lengua (beef tongue) was my definite favorite... the tongue was extremely, and surprisingly, tender, and something I would come back for.

My friend and I decided to come here after doing archery (Yelp for the win!), and at first, we were a little hesitant in eating here; it is not necessarily the cleanest place, a very hole-in-the-wall kind of place. However, all the best food places comes for these types of restaurants right? Besides, the line was pretty long and it looked like all the locals went there, so you know this place is legit.\n\nEverything looked pretty delicious on the menu, but based on Yelp, we decided to order the Quesadilla Suiza, the Carne Asada Super Burrito, chips, and Horchata. \n\nFirst thing to note: the portions are HUGE. My friend and I ordered way too much food and were dying towards the end of our meal as we were trying desperately to finish it all (which we did like champs). Also take note that my friend has a bottomless pit when it comes to eating, and finishing all this food made him suffer a bit too. \n\nThe Quesadilla Suiza was simply delicious--my favorite thing that we ordered, and something that I will definitely order again the next time I come back. We decided to have chicken in it as opposed to beef, and I think next time I will definitely try it with the beef option. Half of that alone was pretty filling for me, but it was delicious; no extra sauce was needed, and it had the perfect balance between salty, creamy, and deliciousness. \n\nThe Carne Asada Super Burrito was alright--nothing too special about it. I don't think I will order it again, and it was a little dry. Add a little salsa too it (I recommend the green one), and you are good to go. \n\nThe chips were yummy and I like the different salsas that were offered (the green one was my favorite). The Horchata tasted a little bit like a Dubble Bubble pink bubblegum, but I never had Horchata before so my friend insisted that we get it. \n\nAll in all, it was a delicious and very fulfilling meal (I was in a food coma for over 2 hours), and was a great way to top off a wonderful day with one of my best friends.", "author": "Andrea X."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-05", "description": "I've been trying to find a go-to burrito place ever since moving back to the Bay and the ridiculous prices with several sub-standard experiences have thwarted this effort for a while. Finally, I decided to give this place a try after reading the reviews from three of my respected sources, Marti L, Tom R and Karen Y.  This hole in the wall resembles a narrow vertical hallway that offers you a fascinating preview of the food through its open kitchen by the door. Although the dim lighting and cafeteria style seating may not situate you in the most pretentious environment, but this place is not about that. The place is about using messy greasy fingers to pick up the fattest burritos, tacos and tortas and let your pretty smile dangle with something that looked like gooey string cheese with ruminants of spicy red salsa still printed on either side of your smeared little cheekies.\n\nI came back for two straight days to try their super lengua burrito ($5.45) and pastor torta ($4.45). The super burrito came with generous portions with savory chunky lengua evenly distributed throughout. The lengua was complemented with thick slices of fresh avocado, salsa, rice, pinto beans, and lots of melted cheeses wrapped in a white flour tortilla. They didn't skimp on anything as the taste of lengua was robust and savory with every bite; and the fresh avocado slices and thick servings of melted cheeses did a nice job in bringing its own mix of sweet and savory deliciousness. The mix of rice and beans were perfect additions as they were filling but not overwhelming to round out the supporting cast. During this visit I also tried their watermelon fresca ($1.25/large) and it was sweet and refreshing--something that I recommend.\n\nMy first rate experience led me to come back this morning to try my very first torta. For less than five buckaroos, portions were humongous again with plenty of chunky pastors to go with a thick layer of melted cheeses, fresh greens, thick tomato and avocado slices, and a thin layer of refried pinto beans--all stacked in between fresh buns right off the grill. I was already super full midway into the meal but it was so good that I had to finish it. I thought the numerous jalapeno slices embedded in the cheese was one memorable highlight, and the use of fresh greens, tomato and avocado gave the sandwich a sophisticated mix of textures to go with the other components that were more finesse and savory. With delicious pastor still sizzling, my torta was greasy, messy, and memorable.\n\nThis place is hard to beat given its tangible offerings of price, portion, and quality. Like several other occasions at similar places, I had to repeat several times to assure them that I can handle jalapenos in my food but otherwise service was friendly and responsive. If there is any limitation to this place, it would be their weak salsa bar and a 50 cents charge for the chips. I found the red salsa on the far right the most legit but otherwise the taste of the other two options did not register. Since I'm a tacos kind of guy, I hope to come back to try their great looking tacos. 4.5 stars for the overall experience.", "author": "Daniel L."}

And I must say, I'd definitely eat here during the day sans any drinking whatsoever. The food itself is enough to excite my belly. \n\nFor $6.25 each, I shared the Quesadilla Super Suiza & the Super Burrito with a friend, both with chicken. Both stuffed to the max. Both delicious. I love how sour cream & avocado are included & not an extra $0.50 or something silly like that. I ate 1/2 of the quesadilla, which was practically burrito size & was so full I had to eat my burrito later. Surprisingly, it still tasted good as leftovers, one the the most important qualities of food. My bf had the Al Pastor Super Burrito & once I tasted it I immediately wished I had ordered it. The pork is so flavorful, ahhh I can't stop thinking about it. \n\nLuckily at 11am on a Saturday there was no line, but once we finished eating around 12, the places filled up!

In this case, it's the super burrito with lengua (beef tongue).  Unlike some other places, El Farolito charges the same price for all meats, and with all the goodies (guac, cheese, etc), the super burrito still costs me a mere ~$7 total, and it's a decent size too.  My mouth is watering just from me writing this.  The place can be pretty crowded, especially around peak hours, but even if there's a long line, it moves pretty quickly (faster than Disneyland, that's for sure), and of course, the food makes the wait time totally worth it.  There isn't a lot of wait area or seating inside, so make sure to hover around a table that seems to be wrapping up.

Obviously, it's cheap as dirt and the portions are huge.  My feast of the evening included the large nachos, with carne asada weighing in at a whopping $5 for about 3 lbs of amazing food.

It's amazing, delicious, and quite possibly the best.\n\nMy one gripe I have about this place is the bathroom situation.  There's no key, but the door is always locked and there's no sign to indicate what's going on in there.  Basically you have go up to the counter, interrupt them and get them to push a button that unlocks the door from there.  But this isn't obvious, and nobody seems to know it.

San Francisco has been referred to as the holy burrito mecca, and I wanted to see what this madness was about. I did my research - on Yelp, through SF Weekly, and by watching Eddie Huang's Fresh Off the Boat on YouTube. The consensus was that El Farolito reigns supreme, thus my location was marked. \n\nEating a burrito from here was not the transcending experience I think I had hoped it would be. The super burrito with carnitas, for a mere $6 and change, was definitely one of the most solid burritos I've ever eaten. It might have even been the best. I'll be honest - I've eaten too many burritos to really crown any one king. \n\nThere was something special, though, about eating a mondo-sized burrito in the grubby Mission district with the locals. My friend Robert and I stood out as particular gringos, but the surroundings just added more flavor to my meal. People say all the time on Yelp how a French restaurant in LA was good, but wasn't as good as the French food they had while in France. I always feel like the food in of itself was probably just as good if not better, and it was the personal experience of being in France that gave that food experience the edge. This was certainly the case for me at El Farolito - I could certainly eat a similar burrito in any number of crappy Tex-Mex stands across the country, but I'm confident none will ever leave the same lasting impression that the one I enjoyed here did.", "author": "Eric F."}

With a line out the door, it clearly has the potential to live up to it's ranking in the burrito bracket by fivethirtyeight. That being said, it definitely isn't as good as the burritos in San Diego. Maybe it's just me talking with some rose-tinted goggles on, but there is just something about the california-style burritos with fries inside that just speaks to my inner human in a way that a mission-style burrito wrapped in tinfoil cannot.\n\nIt's not a bad burrito though! It comes with all the fixings of a burrito, with a nice helping of carne asada. It's a burrito, but like some of the other Yelpers have mentioned.. It probably isn't the greatest burrito in California, and probably wouldn't even crack my top three. That being said, I'd get it in a heartbeat after a long day at work, especially since the fact that it is right outside the 24th street bart station eliminates any need for extra walking.\n\nAbout the restaurant itself, the layout is quite poor, mostly due to the room constraints. The room is essentially a long rectangle, with about a fourth of it reserved for burrito-preparation, and the rest of it reserved for seats. This leaves very little room for maneuvering around inside the restaurant, giving it a very claustrophobic feel. It's probably better to just take your burrito and go, or visit the other (much more open) location on 24th.\n\nFunny note: One of my friends asked them for guac for his chips, and got half an avocado in return.

The prices are very reasonable too for SF standards.\n\nThis was my first experience with having a \"Mission burrito\" and I will be going back to try others in the future. \n\nI should point out that this place is located right outside of the 24th & Mission BART Station so it is quite convenient to get to.

Oh well, I guess we could stop by the Walgreens across the street.\n\nFive minutes later, we were back in line and my roommate started raving about the Suizas and the steak here. Although I did feel it might be a good idea to follow solid recommendations (after all, the five people in front of me all got carne asada Suizas) but then I remembered we're going for the grand prize here: if this place has the best burritos in town, I might as well order my favorite cut of meat which countless taquerias have let me down with so far: lengua.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes of ordering/paying, the server brought me my super burrito lengua and after seeing that the burrito wasn't emitting some sort of halo or holy light, I starting becoming a little skeptical as to whether this burrito would fulfill all my wild culinary dreams. And like it happens with all undeserved published hypes, El Farolito definitely was not the holy grail to my quest for the perfect lengua burrito.\n\nEl Farolito's attempt at the lengua burrito was actually very admirable. The lengua was neither undercooked or overboiled and the texture with every bite was as if pulled pork and carne asada had a baby. But, here comes the catch: even with guacamole, sour cream in the fray (with the super burrito) my lengua burrito was EXTREMELY BLAND. It was so bland that I ended up hauling my ass back to the salsa bar back and forth to grab more salsa to pour over my burrito with every bite, kind of like a 12 yo white kid who goes to Chipotle and thinks Chipotle has the best burrito ever.\n\nAlthough El Farolito did not end up being the little lighthouse that guided me out of the looming darkness that is not being able to find an awesome lengua burrito in the city, it did admirably well.

All the restaurants are very casual (not always bad thing!) and offer what is better described as Border food rather than authentic Mexican. Well, at least El Farolito is casual Mexican/Border food one right. \n\nThey have a good assortment of meats for their tacos and burritos. I ordered 4 tacos:  chorizo,  al pastor,  carnitas, and lengua (beef tongue).\nAll of the tacos were pretty good. They were nice and spicy and each taco comes with two corn tortillas because they are quite loaded so only one would not get the job done. Not the best tacos I have ever had, but definitely the best in SF and at pretty good value.\n\nEl Farolito is open late and can get quite busy. You order and pay at a counter and then your order is called out and brought to your table. The orders came out quite promptly for how busy the restaurant was. \n\nIf you are hanging out in the Mission and have a late night craving for tacos be sure sure to check it out!", "author": "Augusto T."}

And that is I love tongue, especially when in it's in my mouth. \n\nYou silly Yelpers, get your minds out of the gutters! I'm talking about Lengua, beef tongue. \n\nWith over 1400 reviews and a four and a half star overall rating, there is not much to say that has not already been said El Farolito. \n\nHere are a few things you need to know: \n1. Bring cash because they do not accept plastic. \n2. Be prepared to wait in a line. \n3. The inside is super tiny so you may have to wait to snag a table. \n\nWhen I visited El Farolito I was really, really hungry. The line when I got there was about 15 people deep, which the cashier told me was \"not that bad\". \n\nAfter waiting about 10 minutes I made it to the register and placed my order. This is what I purchased: \n\nCarne Asada Super Burrito - Huge flour tortilla packed with carne asada, refried beans (they have 3 types of beans to choose from), cheese, rice, sour cream and sliced avocado. \nBeef Tongue Taco (Lengua) - A crunchy shell filled with lots of Lengua meat, cheese, lettuce, avocado, and sour cream. \n\nThe super burrito was huge. It alone could easily have satisfied my hunger. There was tons of carne asada in this bad boy. It may not have been the best asada I have ever had but it was still super juicy and flavorful. Both the rice and beans were excellent as well, although I thought they put a little too much rice in their burritos. The Lengua taco was phenomenal. This was my first experience with beef tongue and I thought it was amazingly delicious. The meat was soft, flavorful and really tender. I'm not sure what types of spices they use when cooking the Lengua but it was seasoned perfectly. To wash down my food I got a large Horchata, which is always great. \n\nThe prices here were good as well. For my two items and my large drink it only set me back $11 bucks. \n\nSince El Farolito is open till 4am on the weekends, this place is, in my opinion, the best joint in SF to satisfy the midnight munchies. \n\nThis place is a must try.", "author": "Craig R."}

We got in line at  7pm and didn't have to wait too long. We shared a Carne Asada Super Burrito and Chicken Quesadilla. The salsa verde sauce is THE BEST, plus the spicy salsa.

The chicken was too dry, and even pairing it with the sauce was not good enough for me. \n\nI could not leave El Farolito having the chicken quesadilla as my last bite so I ordered a Carne Asada Taco. The double tortilla was soft and there was an abundance of meat. However, it just wasn't the same as the burrito and I have had better tacos elsewhere. \n\nAnd to add .. I loved this place so much that I came back again the next night with a group of friends for late night Mexican eats! We ordered Super Burritos, a Super Quesadilla, and Super Nachos - all Carne Asada. The burrito was just as good. The nachos were plentiful, loved it. Our quesadilla was BLAH.

If I'm ever hungry late at night while in the city, I always head down to El Farolito on account of the fact that it's open until 3:30 AM. I usually go for veggie burritos, but after ordering a few that were tasty, but a little lackluster, I switched to their super chicken burritos. Their super chicken burritos are a reasonable price for their massive size. Every time I order one, they are always really delicious and I always have some leftovers to take home with me. Additionally, if a Mexican restaurant has a salsa bar, I'm all about it! El Farolito's salsa bar offers a trio of salsa magic, but the salsa verde seems to always win me over. For the faint of heart, their salsas should offer just enough spice, but for someone who lives by Beyonce's mantra of \"hot sauce in my bag swag,\" none of their salsas seem to be spicy enough. Fortunate enough for me, they always have a stocked vat of pickled jalape\u00f1os and carrots! Depending on the day and time of day, you may be out of luck if you want to sit down.

El Fraolito was up there with the best!\n\nWe took the bus from Chinatown there.  It took about 45 minutes to get there.  It was a little crowded at the front of the restaurant which made it a little confusing to anyone going there for the first time.  The counter is at the front with seating along the side and to the back.  I ordered a carne asada burrito to half it with my wife.  The meat had great flavor and the beans and rice were in a good ratio.  That's not what this review is about though.  Definitely the thing to try when you go there is the Super Quesadilla Suiza.  Think of a hybrid burrito/quesadilla with guacamole and sour cream.  Again the meat was very good but in combination with melted cheese and sour cream and guacamole made it amazing.  This was one of the best Mexican food items I have ever had.  I will be going back to El Farolito when im back in San Francisco.", "author": "Kevin P."}

From their burritos to their tortas it's amazing. Only downfall is that they only accept cash & they don't seem to have an ATM inside the restaurant so be prepared. Also the restaurant itself is very small so finding a table can be somewhat tough but people are usually nice & offer their table once they're done. There's a few other El Farolito locations but this one is the original one. Ps don't get discouraged with the wait line, it's worth it in the end.", "author": "Sarah G."}

Was not disappointed. Got a regular carnitas burrito with guac. Carnitas was not the most juicy I've ever had, but it worked well with the other ingredients. The rice was delicious--usually rice is just filler but this was bursting with meat and spice flavors. Guac was a bit skimpy, next time I'll order double guac. Green salsa was delicious, and they have free salsa and escabeche at a serve-yourself station. Definitely more than the sum of its' parts. Super convenient to BART too, in case, as I did, you have a burrito craving in the East Bay.", "author": "Nick S."}

Sin embargo, there is no question they live up to the hype. Truthfully I am not much of a burrito person and that always felt like a sin through college and a travesty during the 20\u00b4s as eating a tortilla filled with mexican food has for some reason become a pastime, an obsession, a hobby which has breeded it\u00b4s own line of connoisseurs, amateurs, and bloggers of all flavors. It seems in not truly embracing the overfilling tortilla wrapped heaping of rice, beans, and meat of choice, I have traversed, inadvertently, the road less traveled. A lonely road indeed, cast with shadows of doubt and social ostracism; where did I go wrong? I just never thought burritos were qualified as extra-ordinary, unless in the case you eat a lot and in the moment are starving.\n\nMuch like it\u00b4s name, El Farolito is like a small beacon of hope amidst a fog of darkness for the burrito\u00b4d agnostic, for the ones who've lost their way in trying to enjoy said edible 'little donkey' without lukewarm ruminations of sheer apathy, for the ones whose hearts led their expectations for an earthly burrito too far unto the skies of more delicately and heartily prepared gastronomic creations. It is the keyhole to a forgotten room through which light shines through and illuminates treasures of antiquity, forgotten tastes, works of art, lost in time as if they were never even there. But \u00b4there' is not an attic, 'there' isn\u00b4t a case of jewelry in a first class bedroom of a deeply sunken ship, 'there' is not a hidden beach shielded by treacherous tides savvy sailors never dare sail near. No. 'There' is a burrito shop in the Mission of San Francisco. 'There' is a place of renewal, rejuvenation, a fountain of youth for the aged, embittered diner of occasional burrito consumption.\n\nThe al pastor super burrito was simply incredible. Perfectly marinated pork. Really, each ingredient was just right - you know a lot of burrito shacks screw up the rice or the beans or at least one part of it - El Farolito got every ingredient just right. The overall combination of everything (ratio of each ingredient) was just right as well.(Don't lie you don't want your burrito loaded with an over sized scoop of beans we've all been there).

I think they were having an identity crisis.  Does it want to be sweet? Salty? Spicy? Tomato-y?  A confusing enchilada.  Confusing being an euphemism for not good.  DO NOT GET.\n\nThe portions were huge. The enchiladas came on a grossly monster-sized plate, the kind that turns heads.  But that's not helpful to you at all because it's not good enough to eat all of it anyway - I reluctantly consumed one enchilada and couldn't finish the rest.  \n\nAfter I ate, I also got so tired that I passed out on my relatively short BART commute back to my office, missed my stop, had to backtrack, and then felt sick all afternoon.

Currently living in the heart of Los Angeles I have had my fair share of burritos all over the LA area. I have yet to find a burrito that compares to the carne asada super burrito.\n\nThe super burrito comes with your choice of meat but the best one there is indeed the carne asada even though I might be the biggest al pastor fan in the world. It's made with a soft flour tortilla, rice, beans, tomato, cilantro, onion, salsa, cheese, sour cream and copious amounts of avocado. Combine all of that with their already delicious carne asada you have the best burrito In the city if not the state.\n\nThe fact that the Bart stops right there on 24th and Mission  and it open late gives you no excuses to not eat here. It really is a must go to place even if you are only in the city for the weekend. I know it is the first place i am going to as soon as I move back.", "author": "Matthew T."}

Then he put some shrimp on the grill and continued the same process of mixing and turning the shrimp with the same spatulas. Then he went back to the meat to mix and turn using the same spatulas.

Being surrounded by so much awesome Mexican food is a luxury I gave up when I moved to DC, and ever since it has been a struggle to find something that tastes the way it should without spoiling all the things that make Mexican food great. El Farolito lived up to all my expectations, and my Californian eating companions who were skeptical were even more than satisfied by the quality and the quantity here. I'm pretty sure everyone who comes here late at night does it under the same general auspices, and probably leaves with the same sense of happiness after quickly devouring their orders in a similar Neanderthal-like fashion as myself.\n\nWe started out with an order of the Super Nachos with beans, melted cheese, fresh salsa, avocado, sour cream, jalapenos, and beef. There's no skimping on any ingredient here for sure, the pile of nachos was massive, and every topping was well represented. From the pieces of freshly sliced avocado (no watered down guacamole crap here) to the really large pieces of chopped beef (note, not minced), every bite was loaded with great but simple flavors.\n\nNicole decided to have a beef taco after, which I of course couldn't resist sampling. The amount of beef piled in was quite impressive, and the fresh lettuce and cilantro makes such a huge difference for crunch and flavor. Thankfully they did the proper thing and used a double tortilla, because otherwise this thing would have been way too heavy to stay together.\n\nI decided on the \"al pastor\", or marinated pork, super burrito (although the idea of beef brain was really tempting). Unfortunately no photographic evidence exists of this monstrosity, as I pretty much guarded it like a dog with a bone and consumed it in record speed. Unlike every other burrito from every other place that doesn't know jack about properly preparing food, this one was superbly layered, ensuring that each bite provides a wide range of flavors, instead of getting 4 bites of rice, 4 bites of beans, and then 4 bites of miscellaneous toppings. Thank you El Farolito for proving it is possible!\n\nThis place is really cheap considering how good it is, and how much food you wind up with for just a few bucks.

On the non-burrito side of things, the fire roasted/pickled peppers and onions are about the spiciest things on Mission Street, the artwork is super-rad, and the Horchata is exquisite. \n\nOn the other hand, their tortillas aren't always well grilled, the meat isextra-greasy, burstage is an issue, sour cream is applied with a fire hose and what part of extra-spicy is so hard to understand? Oh, and their chips suck. Constantly.\n\nAs for their meat, quality can be variable. On the one hand, their pork is a total, under-flavored grease-fest, but on the other, their Carne Asada is superb. Seriously, cows probably grow up dreaming of becoming part of a Carne Asada burrito at El Farolitio. \n\nFour stars then? Yeah, I often come out more impressed then disheartened, the convenience can't be beat, the prices are reasonable, and shit, that is some delicious Carne Asada. Shit, even on a bad day, the most mediocre of their work is better then most other Taquerias in The City. \n\nIn conclusion:\nOn a good day, Farolito can't be beat and lives up to the hype.

At first i realized that i had gone here before and was hesitant to order food, but then again i was drunk and hungry so i ordered a carne asada burrito. This burrito tasted a lot better than the first time i had came here. Main reason being i was drunk. So if i was in a sober state of mind during the day time i would much rather go somewhere else for mexican food.

Honestly, it did not disappoint, but overall, I'm not a huge burrito person (Hubby loves them though!)\n\nWe decided to stop at this place on our way to the airport. We wanted to be daring and tried things that we would've never thought that people can put in a burrito. (i.e. Cabeza or Beef Head Meat and Lengua or Beef Tongue). Also, we got a traditional steak burrito just in case we can't take the \"delicacies\". \n\nThe Beef Head meat was actually very tender and I thought was better than the steak meat. However, I guess probably a lot more people order steak burritos, so the fillings in that steak burrito was made to perfection. In comparison, the fillings in the Beef Head meat burrito was a bit more bland; also, I didn't know we can ask the guys to put spicy green sauce on the burritos to make it more flavorful; totally would've done to the Beef Head burrito if I knew. So don't forget to ask them if you like your ingredients spicy. As for the Beef Tongue burrito, it wasn't too impressive either; still liked steak burrito the best. So much for being daring, but hey, at least I can say that I've tried. =P \n\nAnyways, overall, this place is tiny, but the lines move rather quickly. The burrito wraps here are just the right thickness, so you don't feel like you're eating tons of wheat flour. The ingredients are fresh, and everything is easy to customize. Let them know what to wrap, and they'll do it to fit your appetite. I must say that even though I'm not a burrito person, I would have to admit that this is so far the best burritos I've tried.

Daniel N. and I were on our way to San Jose to v1.0's birthday and wanted to grab a quick dinner before we got on the road. I had very high expectations for the BEST Mexican food I could imagine. Can you guess how the experienced resulted in... a little bit of disappointment? \n\nParking was annoying... there simply was none. The line wasn't too bad but we definitely beat the crowd... we turned around and the line was out the door. The food took a while because everyone and their mom was there, literally. We ordered the super burrito, crispy taco and soft taco - all with the Carne Asada. And the end result, bland-ish meat, weird iceberg lettuce on the crispy taco, and old, oily chips. \n\nThe plus... the refreshing strawberry juice beverage. \n\nI'll be back, maybe in 6 months to give this place a try again.

She had taken three or four of the different free salsas to her table and was eating them with bagels. It looked kind of good actually and I was about to ask her for a bite when my tacos arrived.\n\nThey were beautiful. They were perfect. They were fucking spicy. They were messy. \n\nI knew at that moment how John Doe felt and I let all of my inhibitions go. I forgot about my diet; Jenny who?

Even the guy who rented them their boarding gear said \"that place is the sh-t\" as we mentioned possible food breaks (yes..within the city haha). First things first, be careful when looking for it because around the corner is a place with a VERY similar sign-tricky taqueria!\n\nAs we turned the corner to walk into the store we saw a good sign- a long line of hungry looking customers, even better-it was moving quite quickly! We waited about 5ish minutes and were able to order; at that point my sensation of smell was going crazy and I could barely decide on one thing to order. In the end iur car got, a chorizo burrito, two carne asada burritos and a super quesadilla suiza w/ carnitas. \n\nLet me just say that the chorizo burrito was amazing. The sausage was cooked to the point of near perfection that allowed the flavors to infuse throughout the burrito. For such low prices I can't wait to chisle the rest of the menu down. If any of you have personal favorites, please let me know so I can try them! The 2ish hour car ride up was probably the most delicious smelling ride I've ever been on. Can't wait for the next round!", "author": "Jon K."}

One thousand thank you's to the SF friend who recommended this place to me (and to the bartender and other patron who overheard her recommendation and said \"oh, that place is really good\"). BEST TACOS AL PASTOR I have ever had, and it's my favorite, so I order it many places. Delicious pork-y goodness, with fresh onions and cilantro. Yum again! Reasonable prices on the tacos and burritos (which looked amazing, but was more than I needed at 10am), but the drink prices are a higher mark-up...not unreachable, but not a \"deal\", either. Order at the the counter. Cash only (as all the best places tend to be). Small no nonsense place. \n\nAnd hooray for having early hours. I only had 4 hours to wander in the Mission. Had intended to start with Humphrey Slocombe for breakfast and El Farolito for lunch. However, the ice cream place didn't open until noon, but a quick check on my phone told me El Farolito was already open. So, TACOS FOR BREAKFAST! Yum, again, I say. The man at the counter seemed concerned that I was only ordering two tacos. I assured him I'd be alright (as I intended to nibble my way through SF.

But when I cut the burrito in half I didn't see any guacamole in there. Thinking maybe it's just hiding, I took a couple more bites, but nope. No guacamole in there. There was sour cream so I'm sure this was a super burrito. Ate about half of the burrito and I feel like I've had better.

All were good, but nothing amazing. They carne asada was the weakest link, aside from the chicken, in my opinion, but I am a tough critic when it comes to the stuff. I never order chicken burritos because you always get that weird boiled chicken in tomato-y sauce that tastes nasty. There's was just very bland and dry. The pollo asado is delicious though. The carnitas are actually really good too. Al pastor is one of the more difficult items to mess up and they did not, which speaks to their legitimacy. \n\nI prefer burritos personally, but their all meat offerings are very small. They literally just take out the rice and beans (I've compared the sizes), but I believe they charge more. Shouldn't I get more meat in there if I get charged more? Whether or not they charge more though, I just think that the all meat option should be a more reasonable option for those of us who are not accustomed to all this filler in our burritos.

It's like, \"I MUST write about this experience! The world has to know about this place and, because of my thoughts, people will be forever changed.\"\n\nWell, this review is the latter.  :) \n\nI had an AMAZING experience at El Farolito.  During (and after) my meal, I kept saying, \"This is going on my YELP review.\"  That's how eager I was to YELP about this place.  (And, those who know me know that I don't generally crave Mexican food, and Mexican food rarely wows me unless its stellar.)\n\nWell, El Farolito is STELLAR.  Totally changed my life because now I love Mexican food from El Farolito. Here's the 411:\n\n1)  Carnitas Super Burrito (5/5): The carnitas is moist, juicy and succulent.  YUM.  It makes my mouth water just thinking about that generous helping of salty, marinated pork that melts in your mouth.  Coupled with the sour cream, an ultra-creamy avocado (what do they do to their avocados? is it guac?  it's SO freakn good) and beans,  this burrito is absolutely delicious.  I think it's $6.25 for a Super Burrito, and I saw a ton of bf/gf couples splitting it and being quite content on the size/amount of food in the Super Burrito.  \n\n2) Salsa Bar (4/5):  Fresh tomatoes, various level of spice and plentiful, well-stocked salsas make El Farolito's salsa bar yummy.  \n\n3)  Chips ($.50):  Too bad chips don't come with the meal (like at Papalote), but it's still good and cheap.\n\n4)  Venue: A Lil' Ghetto but Endearing (2/5):  I saw people who just came from the opera, college couples out for a late night snack, people wasted from a wild night in SF, super ghetttooo people, young working professionals, yuppies and hipsters dining at El Farolito.  If you don't mind the crowd (and the various people), then this place is solid.  Yes it gets dirty (there are literally a ton of people in the restaurant. It's not that big and, given that many people are drunk, the place can get messy. But the workers do try to sweep up the spilled salsas, chips and jalapenos and they try to clean off the tables.)  If you don't mind a little bit of grunge, then eat here!  The kitchen totally looks clean, so don't worry. :)\n\n5)  Open till 4 a.m.?  YES. How convenient-- just perfect to feed my late night snack cravings and (drunken) appetite.  :)  \n\n6)  The wait for our burritos was about 15 minutes.  The line was out the door!  It's well worth the wait.  This place totally puts SF on the map for good Mexican food. \n\n7)  Late Night Music (4/5):  I don't know if they have a guitarist playing every evening, but they had one on Saturday and he sang really sweet, upbeat songs.  I didn't understand one word, but I really enjoyed it.  It added to the whole experience, you know?", "author": "Sunny S."}

It took 20 minutes and the same man who took my order and stood next to the cashier while I paid asked me SEVEN TIMES what I'd ordered.  He took my receipt, looked at the number and order SEVEN TIMES.  One of the guys who was cooking looked up after the seventh, \"can I see your receipt?\" and said I would have to keep waiting, then suddenly, \"I'll make it for you, sorry.\"  He made a steak and rice burrito with a bit of salsa AFTER taking the receipt that read 'super carne'.  No cheese, no beans, no guac, no cream, nothing else but steak rice and some salsa.  It wasn't great.  I have some serious thoughts about this incident especially since I was with someone who can attest to the fact that I was treated a bit differently from those we saw who ordered before and after us....", "author": "Britt T V."}

Ordered two veggie burritos. Which, according to the menu, include rice, beans, salsa, avocado and lettuce.\n\nWe stood on the edge of the salsa bar, on alert, until we finally found a table that was being vacated. Brian rushed over, but a group of assertive hipster kids scooped it out from under our noses. No biggie though. A few minutes later, we found a table.\n\nSat down with the dirty garbage left behind (piled high) from the table's prior occupants. Ate some chips. Which, mind you, are pre-packaged store-bought chips...not fresh. No one cleared our mess. To be fair, it was busy. But not that busy. Eventually, after 10 minutes or so, I moved it to another empty table, as I'm not really the type who likes to eat with the former diner's leftovers right next to me. Gross status.\n\nEventually (15 minutes later perhaps?) our number was called. Went to get the burritos and was grilled on my number and what I had ordered to make sure I wasn't stealing someone else's meal. Finally sat down. Peeled away the foil. Unwrapped the tortilla to peak inside. And...CHEESE.\n\nSo I took my burrito to the counter. \"No puedo comer queso,\" I said. The cashier looked slightly annoyed but quickly scribbled down my order and put it back in. I walked back to my table. \"My burrito has cheese too,\" said Brian. Only his was a few bites in.\n\nSo back I went, explaining my friend ALSO had cheese in his burrito. The cashier wasn't so forgiving this time. I kept apologizing for being an inconvenience and he just glared at me and was short in speaking with me. Took the new order and put it in.\n\nAnother 10+ minutes go by. All our chips are gone, and all I can think of is how glorious it was going to be when I got that first bite of burrito. They called our number. Brought our burritos. Opened them up. All looks good on mine. \n\nBut then, Brian found cheese stuck between the tortilla and foil. Bad sign. He inspected the burrito further. All appeared OK. So he took a few bites. And came across...a piece of chicken. \n\nSince we had already been A HUGE INCONVENIENCE on this place, we just kept eating. Only... the burrito was really dry. And really... well... boring. The rice wasn't that great. The beans had zero flavour. The avocado was maybe the only saving grace of the burrito.\n\nBut dear avocado, you weren't enough. No no no. Never coming back here if I can help it.", "author": "Natalye R."}

BF said Mission, Yelp said El Farolito.  We walked in at ~8pm on what must have been Sunday evening (?).  \n\nIt's little more than a hole in the wall; the first impression is not one of cleanliness.  You stand in line, pressing yourself against the counter to make space for the patrons on their way out the door, then place your order at the register (cash only).  From there, take your claim ticket (I forgot to ask for an actual receipt) and elbow your way onto a table.  Our party of four claimed one near the door when we entered but abandoned it to a bum and a baby.  \n\nThe food is delivered in a little plastic tray, and you can salsa-up at the little sauce bar.  Our burritos were absolutely massive and came wrapped in foil, which helped keep things tidy.  My chicken burrito was just ordinary, though, really nothing impressive, fairly flavorless.   Maybe that's what the salsas are for?  The three we sampled had some nice heat.  My partner's steak tacos were simple but tasty; the quesadilla was big and sloppy.  While we ate a little dude strode in with his guitar to warble a tune, passed his hat around and walked out.  You buss your own space; the garbage bin was nearly full to overflowing.  \n\nI mean, the guys behind the counter are hot (by which I mean warm) and working hard, but this just isn't 4-star Mexican.

My curiosity  sparked and I must try this awesomeness of a burrito. \n\nLadies and gentlemen, I must say the carne asada burrito really blew my mind and tastebuds. The ingredients were nothing new or special just the basics. But whatever they use to season or marinate their meat is what makes the difference.

I could not find this particular restaurant in your list. \nI love the food at El Farolito.  My husband and I (we are Seniors) are customers since the '90s.  We and a friend went there on a whim on Saturday, Jan 23, 2016 at about 5:30pm. I noticed that there was a new cashier. I recognized him to be one of the people who used to cook for the restaurant. It seemed he got promoted. I ordered my burrito and paid with my credit card because I did not have enough cash. The new cashier grumbled, for me using my credit card (my husband and I have been customers for over 25 yrs. I regularly use a credit card to buy my burrito, no problem with the old cashier, who even told me to order burrito separately if I wanted a bag of chips for every burrito that I bought. I always bought burrito for my daughter too.) This new cashier gave me my bag of chips. I placed a second order of burrito for my friend and paid it with the same credit card. The cashier grumbled again and was so displeased. He refused to give my friend a bag of chips because I ordered and paid for his burrito.  He treated both transactions as one order. I told him that the second burrito is a separate order but he refused to listen. What could I do? \nI went to the end of the counter to get some salsa.  I spooned salsa into the little one ounce containers. I normally use 4 of these containers for my burrito and chips. I spooned salsa to another 4 containers for my friend who was there helping me to cover the containers. At that time, my husband fell in line (he came from the restroom) to buy his own burrito. I started spooning salsa for him when the cashier came to tell us that there is a limit of 2 salsa containers for every customer. I told him that I always use 4 salsa containers and there was no problem in the past. If there was a change in restaurant's policy, there should be a notice posted on the counter. There was none. The cashier asked one of his helpers to get back from us some of the salsa containers that were still on the counter. I felt so disrespected and humiliated! This cashier was so rude! After patronizing the restaurant for over 25 years, I was appalled to be treated so badly by this cashier!  I don't think I will be back to this restaurant for a long, long time, as long as this rude cashier is there, or until he is further trained for effective customer service. He should understand that satisfied customers are the lifeline of their business.  Customers should be treated with respect at all times!\nI surely miss the old cashier (I think his name is Joe) He was so friendly with me and my husband and he even learned how to say \"Salamat po\" whenever we put and paid for our order.", "author": "Carmen R."}

I spent the first 18 years of my life sampling some of the finest mexican cuisine southern california and northern Mexico has to offer. Not only do I consider myself an expert in the field, but I'd go so far as to proclaim myself one of the preeminent authorities on burritos, carne asada fries, etc. That being said, I found myself in a frustrating dilemma when I moved to northern california and could find nary a mexican place that met my lofty standards.\n\nThat all changed the moment I stepped into El Farolito.\n\nThe inviting scent of grilled carne asada hangs heavily on the air in this lush burrito Shangri-La. The decor consists of slightly dilapidated tables/chairs and a messy salsa bar - which only furthers its claim to legitimacy.\n\nStill, with a weary mind and an all-too-frequently disappointed belly, I ordered a supreme carne asada burrito. The feast my eyes were met with was that fit for a sombrero-clad king. \n\nAlas, I don't remember much else from this sublime culinary encounter (I was probably too busy eating).

Checked it out on Yelp, saw that despite the high rating, a lot of recent reviews were negative, particularly after the hype from being on the show, and found that a lot of good things were written about El Farolito in comparison. The next day, we hopped in the rental car for a mid-afternoon snack of splitting a burrito and a couple of tacos. We ended up waiting about 15 minutes or so for our food, even though the line wasn't that long when we arrived at 3-3:30ish in the afternoon.\n\nAll of the food was really good, although I would definitely rank the al pastor above the carne asadas in terms of spices and flavor. They keep the tacos simple as well, which I like...don't try to stuff too many other condiments in, just keep it simple with meat, cilantro, taco shells, and not much else. But I wouldn't put it on the level of Taco Don Memo in Philly, which is the best burrito I've experienced to date.

It was spectacular, better than anything else in the Mission, comparable in price and, more importantly, big enough to actually sate a starving man's hunger (El Tacqueria super burrito is very small and shockingly overpriced, if delicious, compared to other Mission shops).\n\nI'd give it 5 stars but it charges extra for chips which I think is just not right.", "author": "Pierre B."}

If you plan to eat there, have someone try to secure a seat while you wait in line. The turnover time for tables is pretty quick though.\n\nThe first time I was here, I wasn't very hungry so I ordered ceviche. I seriously thought that ceviche was raw seafood (a variety) in a good lime sauce/salsa. What I got was a plastic cup with cooked shrimp in an almost-salsa sauce and a bag of chips. So not worth it.\n\nTherefore, during subsequent visits, I ordered something they were more known for, or at least something more substantial. Both times, I ordered a burrito with carne asada. Bingo! I finally understood why everyone raved about this place.\n\nThe burritos were packed such that something fell out with each bite.

I inquired and about two minutes later, I got my order and with chips - I did not order chips but I thought it may have been a small gesture on their part for the wait time. I asked the employee if they were marked to identify the type of burrito and he said yes.   Two of the burritos were marked with Pollo and Pastor, the third was not marked and I assumed it was the Carne Asada.   This is what I got:\n\n1. No marking -  Regular chicken with whole beans and salsa and cheese.\n2. Marked Pollo -  Regular Carne Asada with whole beans and no salsa or sour cream. \n3. Marked Pastor - Super Al Pastor with whole beans\n\nThis would have been okay if the parties involved were eating together but I was doing a Burrito run and dropped them off to the individuals.  The errors were not noticed until they bit into them.\n\nI don't even think I am complaining because the only disappointment was that 2 of us did not get what we ordered.  The burrito was good and I guess I hope El Farolito read this and asks their employees to be more careful.  If we stayed and ate there, we would have returned them and got the right order.

What I love most about this place is the fresh avocado they throw in the burrito and the cheese that melts in the burrito. The carne asada was tender, flavorful and was in every single bite. I wolfed down that burrito like there was no tomorrow. I will be back here again to get other items such as carnitas and their quesadillas. Also, it is so damn cheap!

The line was out the door and the restaurant was pretty cramped. Wet bodies everywhere waiting for tables, eating their food, or waiting in line to order. We finally got to the front and I put in my order for 1 carnitas, 1 carne asada, and 1 al pastor taco. We got a number and the waiting game began.\n\nAs we waited we were hawk-eying the tables to make sure to snatch one up as soon as someone leaves. Got a table near the area where they were handing out the orders.. SCORE! When I got my taco I was soo overwhelmed! These tacos were stuffed with meat, and they looked delicious! Took my first bite and ouu la la, I was in heaven. I had the red sauce and the green sauce, I love having a combination of both. Half way through my 2nd taco I was starting to get full. I wanted to be able to try all three flavors, so I put the second taco down and started my way to the third. Half way through my third taco, I called it quits. It was definitely a satisfying after the club meal. I was now happy and ready to go home - knowing that deep down inside, the next time I go to Slone I would have to stop by this place again... and that was exactly what happened. A few weeks later we went to Slone for a friend's birthday and the deciding factor for me to get out of the house that day was the promise of having these tacos by the end of the night!

Hopping off the BART at 24th and Mission (as I have done before) I entered into the vibrant Hispanic district with high hopes. Every time I have consumed a Mission burrito it's been good. Really good. \n\nThis time I did it right. 1: I consulted Yelp, and 2: I asked around.  In both cases, El Farolito came up tops, and I now know why.\n\nThis dirty little hole-in-the-wall taqeria on Mission just off 24th makes hands down some of the best burritos I have ever consumed.  I ordered a carne asada super burrito (incl beans, rice, avocado, cheese, etc - sin crema) and it came with a side of chips. \n\nThe burrito:  This little wrapper of joy was delivered to me by an angel driving a golden and white chariot pulled by winged unicorns with rainbow feet. Well, ok, no, it was brought to me by some dude from the back, but it might as well been sent down from on high.  The burrito was wrapped perfectly tight, with a nicely grilled tortilla.  The meat was good but a little gristly (as it should be), and contained some... uh, is that BACON?!?! Oh yeah babay.  The beans, rice, and the rest rounded out this well-balanced log o' food to create a perfect hand held meal. \n\nThe chips:  The chips were standard, likely from a bag. They did not taste store-made, but they did come free and instantly in a nice little basket. I was hungry, so instant chips kept me satiated until my burrito came. \n\nThe salsa:  This was one of the BIG highlights of my meal. The  little salsa bar had some roja (obviously home made) and some verde/avocado salsa.  The roja was amazing, with little chunks of tomato/onion/cilantro.  The avocado salsa?! OMG. Amazing. I could drink this stuff. I went back for thirds it was so good. \n\nAll together, I sat in this tiny, cramped space and ferociously devoured my chips and burrito, the only sounds emanating from my mouth being \"gasp\" and \"mmmm.\"  I have found burrito Valhalla. As I munched away, sitting at the little metal table with chipped paint, watching the ever-growing line of customers eagerly awaiting their little bundles of Mexican-food joy, I snapped a few mental pictures. This is not a burrito I will soon forget. Never, never forget. \n\nYum.", "author": "Don B."}

Whenever I talk to native San Franciscians, the topic of best burrito is always bound to come up.  It could be upon initial conversation, after a couple months of friendship or even a year, but it is bound to come up.  I have found that more times than not, my tacqueria of choice, Gordos, is continually dismissed, even by my own forever love, EVEN THO she grew up in the Richmond.  Most of the flags are waved for El Farolito and La Tacqueria.  I can understand La Taq, however, am miffed at the \"famed\" El Faro.\n\nGoing at night, parking was plentiful in the Mission.  However, there are a lot of restaurants and bazaars so parking will be difficult in the day.  Bring lots of quarters.  There was already a huge line at El Faros but the cashier took everyone's order quickly.  He got to me before I was ready as I was conflicted between a super burrito or a suiza (quasidilla).  Mind racing between the two, I stuttered super carnitas burrito.  Given a ticket, we seated ourselves into a booth.  Lemme tell you...the ambiance of this place is as authentic Mexican as you can get, and by that, I mean grimy.  The tabletops of our booths were dirty with grains of rice and beans strewn over the surface.  The color was a decayed formica white.  The walls were lined with paintings depicting rural L'Mexique.  Basically, you want to eat while touching the least amount of table service area as you can...aka...no elbows on the table.  Our order came quick and our burritos looked relatively large.  Peeling back the foil and taking my first bite, I was disappointed.  The carnitas were so salty and I felt like I was eating a meat burrito.  I could barely taste any other condiments.  The carnitas were soft and ripped easily, however, there was not much flavour besides that of salt.  We had to get some picca de gallo and pour some in our burrito with each bite.  The guacamole and salsa was scarce and there was not much balance to the burrito.  The cool thing is that they use avocado chunks instead of guacamole.  The downside is that because it is not paste, doesn't spread evenly and you only have avocado in the middle of the burrito.  \n\nI am sad to conclude that El Farolito is horribly overrated.  It is so salty and the ingredients aren't evenly dispersed.  This place is packed however, but it seems mostly so with Mission natives, workers and hipsters.  As a result, El Farolito is most certainly the epicenter around their activities, makign it their neighborhood tacqueria.  I cannot make that same claim.  I am a foreigner to this realm.  I am a Richmond District Native and Gordos on 24th and Clement is where I make my bed, and what a wonderful bed it is.  Home is where the heart is.", "author": "Brian V."}

I wish I knew about this spot a long time ago, because I would make it one of my must visits every time. My boyfriend was ecstatic to eat here because he's a burrito connoisseur. He got a chorizo and carne asada burrito. I got a suiza, which was a quesadilla. It was huge. I could barely finish it. Everything was so good. The sauces were so flavorful and creamy. The veggies added that freshness to balance out the meat. I liked the salsa bar there, the green salsa was my favorite.", "author": "Jazeleene G."}

I had that hunger, you know the one where your stomach yearns for something the size of a baby's leg, wrapped in a flour tortilla, filled with all the food groups, ensconced like a damaged reactor in silvery tin foil? You with me? It was that kind of night, the world was flying by me from 26th in black and white and every face was mean and ugly and ravaged until I saw the light of El Farolito like the light house of Alexandria itself, mythical in it's tiny size, a wonder of our urban streets.\n\nI said to myself if a parking spot opens up it was meant to be. I passed the beacon and just as I was about to hit the light on the corner of 23rd and nowhere a subaru pulled out revealing the 2nd most rare thing in San Francisco after a sunny summer day: a parking space. I walked in got in line and then thought I might pass out from low blood sugar. \n\nLook, the place is the size of my closet, it's long, slim and unlike jim, you don't want to break in there cause it's full of cameras, motion detectors and a grizzly feasting patronage that make you think twice about looking anyone in the eye. But the upside is the burritos do not skimp. Nope the fellas wielding slices of avocado and ladles of salsa make a solid fleshy log like offering of rice, beans, sour cream and other goodness. I took a gander at the quesadilla  for two, it's massive, no seriously, there's like a pound of meat on it or more. The Al Pastor, the measure of any good taco truck is tasty with a nice zing to it, all in all a solid feast-aval in the mission.

Order took around six minutes to arrive table side.  I love the pico salsa and the green verde salsa it just gives the burrito just the right spicy wetness.  The asada in the burrito is well seasoned and has that lovely grilled greasy finish at the end.  The lengua  quesadilla, the cheese is melted giving it a stringy pizza like consistency.  The lengua is soft and tender not all watery like many places who pre-make it and have it in the heating tray.  The strawberry fresca is sweet and refreshing with some fresh bits of fruit.  \n\nBest times to go are usually between 2-5PM if you do not like lines.

I saw the reviews on yelp and I came in expecting a lot.  I have to say, this place lives up to all the great reviews its been getting.\n\nI tried the taco with brain because my friend really wanted to try it.  It had a nice creamy texture that reminded me a lot of sweetbreads.  If you like organ meat, you'd love this taco.\n\ni next had the super burrito with cabeza (stewed beef head meat).  It was a delicious burrito.  The meat was flavorful and really tender and the burrito itself was solid.  I didn't think it was amazing, but it was still a really good burrito.\n\nThe highlight of my meal was the super quesadilla suiza with carne asada.  This was undoubtedly the best quesadilla I've ever had.  The tortilla was grilled and crispy.  The carne asada, melted cheese, avocado and sour cream made for a perfect filling.  I've had a lot of quesadillas and I can say this one was special.  Next time I come back, I'm getting this.\n\nThis is a great taqueria.  This place serves great food and on top of that most items are under $6.  Highly recommended.", "author": "Josh W."}

Put at ease, I scrambled in late on a Friday night to find the place packed with my like-minded brethren, hungry for foods that end with O. Decor-wise El Farolito is an exercise in Big Bird yellows and grime, but you will too distracted by the din, the shouted Spanish, and the sizzling of authentic Mexican foodstuffs to notice.\n\nTacos are cheap ($2) here so I hooked myself up with three.  I sat down with nary a napkin before I dove into my trio of crispy tacos. Bad move. Barely a bite in I was surrounded by a miasma of sweet taco bliss.  The steak, pollo, and chorizo -- which happen to be the increasing order of awesome -- were perfect. Though I was creating an ever-growing pile of tortilla shells and toppings with each bite, I simply manned up with a fork and hit it like a taco salad. (Can you man up and eat a salad?) I wasn't planning on wasting one delcious morsel. \n\nObligatory Title Pun: Make it your MISSION to visit El Farolito.\n\nMenu Readability: Good.

This burrito is filled with TONS (and I seriously mean TONS) of rice, beans, meat, guac, sour cream, etc.  Eating this slowly to embrace each bite will make you want to unbotton that top buttom by the time you are done.\n\nOther than the burrito, I had a friend order the nachos.  Oh my goodness these nachos were huge.  The nachos were basically a burrito without the tortillo all over chips.  It was so good that even though I had the burrito I was munching on the nachos.  I highly suggest you get either or both if you have a group of friends that are REALLY hungry.\n\nI not only love this place for its great overly stuffed burrito but because this place is open late (to my surprise until 2am I believe) and it's on Mission Street which is close to one of my fave bars and they are quick...so quick that by the time you order and find a table to munch on your chips and salsa your burrito is done!\n\nThe staff is friendly and pretty patient with you when you are trying to decide what to get.  The prices are great, the times are convenient for party goers who really just want a quick filling meal so that you can go home nice, happy and plump!\n\nThe only reason this place received 4 stars from me and not 5 is simply because I live in Sacramento and there's nothing like this place over there.

REALLY???\n\nOkay so I've gone there twice so far..  both times I've gotten a grilled chicken SUPER burrito (gotta have the works right?)\n\nNom Nom Noming into my burrito I say to myself, \"This tastes like a burrito... ok and??\"  I don't see or taste anything special about it??! Ok so it has the cheese, beans, rice, guac, sour cream, very dry chicken, salsa, tortilla, and nicely wrapped inside tin foil. Where's my OMG DROOOL FACE AMAZING BURRITO??? \n\nOk ok, I think I get it now..... I can see why it is really good to a lot of people: It's SUPER GREASSYYY!!! Cheesey, Greeasssyyyy, slimy, smushy, melty moist burrito. It's the kind of burrito that melts and oozes in your mouth I guess. If you are hella (rockin' the norcal slang) drunk, hella hungry, hella tired and want a super amazballs NomNom-ing session in your mouth at odd hours of the night (like 3am)... OF COURSE this burrito is going to be soooooo amazing!!! I GET IT!!!  \n\nbut bleeeeeeh.... it makes your tummy and aura feel like poo poo. Both times I did not finish my burrito because it was so greasy and made me feel icky. I normally don't eat greasy foods.. and so the effects of something like this really weighs me down and alters my way of being. \n\nAn El Farolito Burrito is the fastfood mcdonalds of burritos. It's not healthy. At All. Look at the mushy oily brown gunk they are cooking your burrito in on the grill!! \n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE/SPACE:\n \nEl Farolito feels like a bar. It's bustling with loud patrons, it has an awkward let me stare at you nom noming your burrito feeling, you get pushed and shoved in the aisle, and it feels like someone left their left over grease all over the tables and chairs. This is the kind of place where you might want to come with friends (not alone), especially late at night. It for some reason has an eery awkward feeling in there!! Men gawking at you with their burrito glazed nom noming eyes...gross!! Girls, can you agree with me??\n\nNot only that, you get walked on when you're going pee pee in the bathroom!! I'm not sure how they got their bathrooms organized or who has control of the buzzing door, but they need to make the bathrooms more secure. So it's ONE STALL with 1 urinal and two toilets. Do they want us to all pee together as a group staring at each other??? Both times Ive been there... someone has walked in on me using the bathroom...i even had it \"locked for my own privacy\" as per what the sign told me to do.

It has all the makings of a great taqueria: it's a hole in the wall place, next to a skeezy Mission Bar, the line is out the door, it's gritty, it has a great jukebox, it's open until 3am serving all the varieties of Mission drunks (hipsters, Marina kids who went \"slumming\" at the Mission clubs/bars, or really just the roof-top deck at Medjool and \"discovered\" this authentic gem of a place, Mission locals, the panhandlers who hang out at 24th St. BART and scrounged up enough money to buy a burrito...) and the food is delicious!  The tacos de carne asada are great, the tostadas are big and cheap loaded up with refried beans, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, sour cream, the chile relleno burritos are spicy and flavorful, and the super carne asada quesadillas suizas and super nachos are fabulous, too.   \n\n\nI've taken my auntie (who moved to Fremont from So. Cal no too long ago) here. She loves the adobada and al pastor tacos. I'm not sure what she thought of the lengua (tongue) tacos.\n\nI worried that I had such a high opinion of the food here because I'd only ever frequented the place really drunk and late at night. Every weekend night after bar-close my best friend, Alice (who loved their shrimp burritos and quesadillas suizas), and I would inevitably tell our cabby to drop us off at El Farolito before heading home to Potrero.

I recommend rolling up your sleeves, taking off your jacket (most likely not in that order) and try not to black out as you quadruple orgasm.  The workers are there to cook, not clean up after you.\n\nSuper economical. A burrito that can be saved for later (which you won't be able to do given the taste) starts at around 5-6 dollars and tacos run for just 2.25.\n\nIf you haven't already, I demand you to stop by and hope you enjoy it as much as I did, do, and will later this weekend after a night out.\n\nUntil next time.

It's also more vegetable than you're likely to find in any other burrito.  I've ordered this and had it scarfed down by vegetarian and non-vegetarian friends.  Do yourself a favor, and go there now, or when you're out in the MIssion after a night of drinking.  It will be good either way.", "author": "Pearl L."}

The lack of marinade or sauce is indicative of how good the meat is on its own.\n\nI thought it was a great, solid burrito, but it was not mind altering nor life changing.  Also, my friend ordered 4 carnitas tacos, and those of us who ordered burritos got our food much faster than her tacos (as in we sat there and waited and waited and waited...while we were dying to eat our own food, but didn't want to be rude), so service wasn't too good in that sense...hence 4 stars.", "author": "Laura S."}

I know you're hungry. You know you want one.\"\n\nThe flat top grill in the front window prominently displays their wares--- meat and toppings and all of the delicious promises of a carne asada burrito. Then you walk in... and see a box of chips. *wonk wonk*.... I almost walked out because that made me realize that their chips were not made fresh throughout the day. I mean...  if you're going to whet our appetites with FREE CHIPS AND SALSA... then the chips should be good, right?\n\nBut about a foot away, someone was slaving over peeling carrots, chopping limes, and all things salsa. So I stayed put.\n\nWe ordered two carne asada burritos- no beans, no rice, a carne asada taco, and cokes in bottles (you have a choice between the bottle or a can). \n\nThe place was PACKED. I would normally consider that a good sign, but because this place was featured in 7x7, I was more skeptical than anything. Food reviews always ruin the great eateries.\n\nShortly after ordering, we packed up our tower of salsas and found a table. Then... THE FOOD. \n\nBurritos weighed in as small babies. The taco, decent sized, but I was confused as to whether I should eat it like a pizza or try to smush it as a taco. (that tiny little tortilla was stacked!) \n\nThen... the burrito test....\nsoft tortilla- PASS\nsits/stands on its own - PASS\nleaks a little bit out of the bottom, but not so much so that it demolishes the tortilla- PASS\n\nThe meat was oh so tender. Salty, but would be much better if they let it marinate just an hour or so longer. The bites were a perfect mix of sour cream, guac, meat, and salsa.\n\nI have found the burrito that fills the need.

Also a little too much sour cream. The ratio of everything else to everything else was a little imbalanced, too. The rice was all piled on one side, the avocado chunks were large but infrequent, and I could barely taste the salsa. Judging from this taqueria's ratings, I think I just caught them on an off night.

This place came across as I searched eateries on the map, and out of a lot of reviews the average rating was like 4 stars so I thought to give it a shot. \n\nFirst of all, there's like 3 or 4 different \"Taquerias\" on that city block alone I think lol so I almost walked into the wrong one haha. It's a narrow little restaurant, only space of a single-file line as the rest of the place is filled with tables. I went in thinking I was going to make the next train in time, but the two parents ordering for their family of 10+ people seemed to disagree with me. Oh, how I hate probability. There is truly nothing more annoying than waiting as a dad yells past you three tables over to people sitting down, \"What kind of soda do you want?!?!?\" and etc. For the next like 8-9 minutes (felt like 20) I glared at the parents as the cashier kept adding on menu items as I saw the total came to nearly $150. Geesh. Is this food that good? Btw by the 5th minute I had already given up the fact that I wasn't going to make my train on time, which made me glare and stare down the whole family even more. However, By the time it was my turn there was a line out the door into the street so in retrospect I was glad I didn't come any later than I did.\n\nI kept it simple, ordered the Super Burrito Pollo, and made sure to take my time mean-mugging the large party family while I waited for my food because now I had to wait another 12 minutes for the next train. One of them was cute anyway so I didn't give the \"look\" too hard. Over all the burrito was very good. And big. The chicken was kinda dry, but it was WHITE meat (which I am so glad for because it seems hard to get white meat chicken at some taquerias) so I couldn't complain much.

Everything else on the menu is pretty good as well.\n\nSuper big tortilla with your choice of meat, with fresh avocado, fresh salsa, sour cream and cheese.  This thing is stacked and if i try to finish thing, guarantee to be stuffed and a food coma will await you in seconds. I myself can not even finish this and i will have a quarter left for later!  You must add their tasty avocado salsa sauce its my all time favorite, with a little bit of fresh salsa they make as well.  All their salsa is freshly made and its very good.\n\nThe taco's are like street tacos but it is stacked with your choice of meats,  They ask you if you want it spicy or not and they add a hot sauce on top with cilantro and onions.  Typical taco but is stacked with a lot of meat.\n\nThey have a condiment bar:  wedge limes, small radishes, fresh salsa, pickled jalapeno with carrots and onions, and the delicious mouth watering avocado salsa.\n\nOverall this place is amazing it's not expensive for the price and the amount of food you get.  The only drawback to this place is, it is not the prettiest place but its a place you can sit and eat your meal.  You can even see the cook making your food in front of the store and while you wait, how cool is that?  Just watching them make your food just makes your mouth water while you await your order.  lastly, I can devour a Super Quesadilla Suiza anytime... :)\n\n-parking-\n\nParking can be hard, it is on a busy intersection of Mission and 24th street.  You might be lucky and find a spot on Mission street,  the farthest i parked was a block away.  Majority of the parking spaces are metered so bring some coins.  Not to mention if you were to take the MUNI bus the 14th Mission heading towards downtown it will be right there!\n\n**QUICK TIP**\n\nThis place can be busy at rush hour times, lunch time around noon, dinner time around 6-8pm and on the weekends when the party poopers are done they usually come here and get a quick bite!\n\nThis place isn't the safest neighborhood and a bit scary, i would recommend you go with a buddy or two just so you won't feel worried walking on the street at night!\n\nTheir are other several locations.", "author": "Kenneth Y."}

Many of the  reviews for that location always talk about how it's not as good as this one. We were in the city on a Saturday and figure \"why not?\"\n\nThe minute I walk in, I realize that we HAD been here 4+ years ago and decided then that although the good was tasty, it was just too dirty to enjoy your food. Forgot it's cash only (SSF location takes credit cards), so had to get cash and come back. No biggie. Got veggie and carnitas super burritos. Sour cream tasted \"off\" in veggie. Carnitas was just meh. I'm used to yummy, crispy bits of pork. Theirs had not a hint of the crispy bits I've grown to expect. Worse part, it was so dirty in there that it put me off my food. After 10 min, I wrapped up my food to-go. \n\nAfter reheating at home, I realized that the carnitas just wasn't good. Ended up eating the rice/beans/cheese and some of the tortilla. For a committed carnivore like myself, bypassing the carnitas is a huge deal, but I just couldn't do it. \n\nAt the end of the day, this place is palatable if: you close one eye and squint with the other to avoid seeing how dirty it is. Having your taste buds numbed by alcohol probably would hurt either. While i recognize that many (many!) people have no problem with this, I have a weaker constitution.", "author": "Eme L."}

I'm talking about you, blonde girl who had to be perfect about eating a burrito. And be LOUD about how messy it was.  That thing is going to fall apart regardless of how you eat it. In fact, using your fingers and hands is part of the fun.  And if you're going to be eating a burrito, expect that you have leftovers.

To save room for subsequent stops, we decided to order one chorizo taco for me, one lengua (beef tongue) taco for her, and carne asada super nachos and strawberry aguas frescas to share.  The chorizo taco was perfection!  I don't know how many times I exclaimed how yummy the chorizo was...slightly crisp but not overcooked, great flavor with enough of a spicy kick.  The super nachos were decent with a lot of meat, slabs of avocado, sour cream, melted cheese, and touch of jalapenos.  The beef tongue taco looked good too but not as tasty as my chorizo taco.  We ate at 8:30pm, and our tummies were full for almost 5 hours.\n\nOf all the taquerias we visited, El Farolita has the best prices - taco for $1.95, super nachos for under $5, aguas frescas for $1.25.  Our meal was quite filling for under $12, and I was surprised by the generous portion of meat (see picture).  Street parking is doable, and it's on the same block as the BART station.  The area can get sketchy at night so be aware.\n\nBecause I can't stop thinking about the chorizo taco (too bad I was too full to have seconds), El Farolito deserves 5 stars.

It's not that I don't want to ... okay, it's because I don't want to, so I rely on my friends to drag me away from my faithful eating places.\n\nOne thing I like about this place is that it's conveniently located near the BART station. We got there around 1pm, and we were lucky that the line was short but for a line as short it was, it moved a bit slow.  However, that's in no way a reflection of how hard the guys were working behind the counter.\n\nI ordered the super veggie burrito (with black beans) ... and it was actually really good. My friend kept pestering me about this place, and I can see why.  They pack those burritos to the brim; you're lucky if you can even taste the tortilla with all that filling going on and making a mess every time you invite your chompers down for a taste test.\n\n- One thing I didn't like about the burritos was the spiciness. I think it's the rice. Not to say that it was heat I couldn't handle because I could, but for my personal taste? I wish it wasn't. Obviously, many people don't seem to mind it or don't find it spicy at all (I'm a baby, okay).\n\n- Speaking of the rice, it was a bit too dry for me. No bueno.\n\n- The place is kind of dingy and left -a lot- to be desired, but that is the beauty of take-out.  I don't think I'll ever order here and stay to eat.\n\n+ The best thing I can say about their burritos that counteracts the negative aspects is that just one of their burritos will make you full. In fact, it was really the only thing I ate the entire day. I honestly don't know how anyone can eat those suckers in one sitting.\n\nIn the end, I could see myself coming back ... provided my friends drag me over here for their foodie craving. Habit wins over my stomach in the case of El Faro, what can I say.\n\n\nP.S. Your debit/credit cards are no good here. But don't get your knickers in a twist.

Do they call it little lighthouse because it takes forever to get there and appears closer than it really is?? It took us lots of walking and two busses to get there and damn was it hot today. By the time we got there I thought I was going to pass out from hunger and heat and would have just about eaten the foil off the burrito if that's what they gave me. \n\nI immediatley ordered Horchata and my friend got a strawberry juice which was amazing. Not too sweet and super thirst quenching(the strawberry juice that is. the horchata was on par). I then(by then I mean-still at the counter after I'd downed half my horchata)ordered a regular carnitas burrito with avocado. What is up with that? It's called guacamole!! Get it together people! Por Favor!! He got the super quesadilla with beef which he said is the only thing he misses when he is traveling in other countries.\n\nWe got our chips and I loaded up at the salsa bar that had 3 different kinds, all with a good kick to them. God I love salsa. Our food came and I ripped into my burrito like there was no tomorrow. The carnitas was tender and there were huge chunks of avocado which I found about half way through my burrito. I had to load on the salsa for each bite but it was definitely a good burrito. \nI looked around and noticed that pretty much everyone was eating the quesadilla--which was good if your into that kind of thing. They have sour cream in them so that kind of tainted my bite, but other than that it was yummy as well, and big.

Yes - rice and beans can be seasoned too! At best, a typical, nothing special burrito. \n\nI also didn't really enjoy the dingy dining experience. Waiting 15 minutes a narrow line while people are trying to squeeze past you in the too-narrow walkway isn't fun, nor is hovering to try and grab an already-dirty table. \n\nFinally, the only reason I tried this place is because they ran a 50% off promotion with Scoutmob. I printed the coupon and brought it with me, and when I presented it to them they refused to honor it, even though it was valid for another week.

El Farolito is everything you could want in a taqueria, from the sights of carne asada cooking up in a pool of grease to the long lines.  The burritos are absolutely enormous, and they don't skimp on the meat.  Tacos are a good size and tasty as well.  Pastor, lengua, cabeza....whatever you fancy, they have it.  The only thing I can complain about are the chips, which taste like a bad version of Frito Lay's Tostitos. \n\nTo note, I've only eaten at El Farolito sober, so please take this into account when analyzing my rating.

El Farolito just keeps it real, serving good cheap food; and therefore, reigns as my go to spot for a good burrito. \n\nThe super burrito is so good, it will put you in a food coma for hours. Literally. Pure lethargic bliss. I can never finish the entire burrito too, so that says sometime about its portion size (as well as my appetite). But it works perfectly for me, knock out two meals with one bomb ass burrito!\n\nWhat I also love about El Farolito is its salsa bar. You got your mild, medium, and spicy selections, which, unlike some other taquerias, actually feels appropriately labeled as such. \n\nQuick tips:\n- Cash only.\n- Chips are an extra charge.\n- There's usually a line, but a short, and worthwhile, wait.", "author": "Ray W."}

After my friend finished Christmas shopping for his girlfriend we head towards the place. When we got to Mission Street, the place was crowded and we spent a good 10 to 15 minutes looking for a place to park. When we finally found a parking spot, we quickly headed over the taqueria. At our arrival, we encountered a long line than went out the door but flowed quickly and we were in front of the line in no time. My friend and I decided to split a super burrito with tripas (fried tripe) and my other two other friends ordered a sesos (brain) taco, cabeza super buritto and a carne asada super suiza. \n\nTripas Super Burrito - Fried intestine with the normal fixin's that come in a super burrito. The tripas and rice were well cooked and tasted good but the beans were overwhelming and at times overpowered everything else in terms of flavor and texture. Also, I sort of wished that the tripas was crispier but all and all, the burrito was good.\n\nCabeza Super Burrito - Same as above except with cow face meat. The meat was good and tender was an overall a good burrito. \n\nSesos Taco - Cow brains. My friend being adventurous, decided to get this to find out what cow brain tastes like. I decided not to take a bite but my friend describes it as having a rich and creamy texture and with a taste resembling liver. If you're into that kind of flavors, then you would probably enjoy this one.\n\nCarne Asada Super Suiza - Carne asada with avocado, cheese and sour cream wrapped in a grilled tortilla. This was the highlight of the meal. The tortilla was crispy and had the right amount of cheese and sour cream inside. What really made this item the best out of the four was the meat. The meat was nice and tender and packed with a tremendous amount of flavor and was by far THE BEST CARNE ASADA I HAVE EVER EATEN yet. \n\nIf you're planning to stop by El Farolito, get your order to go since chances of finding a clean table at this place is somewhat low, especially for a group of 3 or more people. We found a table that would sit the four of us but we had to clean it ourselves. Also, parking around the area can be tough. We found a 30 minute parking spot which gave us ample time to get to the place but our group had to split up and re-park the car. \n\nPros: Carne Asada, Carne Asada, cheap, fast moving line, Carne Asada.\n\nCons: Parking can be a hassle, packed and slightly dirty, has brought down the rating of ever other taqueria that I know.\n\nRating: 5 Solid Stars", "author": "Roger L."}

I got the vegetarian buritto, which was bland.  My boyfriend got the carne asada buritto which he said wasn't that great either.\n\nIf you are looking for a lot of food for cheap, El Farolito is the place to go, especially when its late.

My friends came back from New York and they talked about how hard it was to find a decent burrito over there. Apparently Chipotle and Taco Bell are your best bets on the east coast.\n\nParking was hard to find, and when we did find it, it was for only 30 minutes, so we had to act fast. By the time we got here there was already quite a long line, but things were coming out quickly. My friend and I decided to split three items: a crunchy taco, a super suiza quesadilla, and a super burrito. Actually, we were going to order only the burrito and the quesadilla, but I wanted to order the taco because I saw a meat on the menu that I hadn't seen anywhere else: cow brain. We figured that it wouldn't be a wise idea to pick a meat that we might not like in a food as big as a burrito, so we decided to order it in a taco instead. Our other two friends ordered a super burrito with tripe.\n\nOur food came out in about ten minutes, and we dug into the taco first. The brain was...interesting. The flavor was irony, kind of like other organ meats like liver. The texture was kind of off-putting as it was a bit too creamy and rich. It was like eating a liver flavored pudding. However, the other components of the taco were good.\n\nNext, we tried the burrito, which we got with cabeza (beef head), and it was very good. It had good flavor throughout the burrito and it was not disappointing in any way. However, the best item, hands down, was the super suiza quesadilla. As my friend put it, \"This is the best quesadilla I've ever had\" and I will not argue that. It was warm throughout and was packed with flavor. \n\nWith over 1,000 reviews and a rating of 4.5 stars, this place hardly needs any more praise or people raving about how good it is, but the meal was that damn good, that I felt like I had give it some more applause.", "author": "Stephen N."}

Like, that one time I came in drunk just before 2 and ordered a Super Carnitas Quesadilla? Or that other night when I stumbled in drunk after bar-hopping in the Mission, and ordered a Super Carnitas Quesadilla? And, of course, you can't forget the time when I wandered in drunk on a Saturday and ordered a Super Carnitas Quesodilla. Do you remember that!? Good times my friend, good times.\n\nOkay. You get the picture. I never eat here sober. That said, I don't really know that anyone SHOULD eat here sober - I think to truly appreciate the magic that is El Farolito, you have to be sufficiently intoxicated. And frankly, I think my judgment of tacqueria quality improves as my cocktail intake increases.\n\nSo with that, as far as quesadillas go, I officially decree El Farolito as the 2nd best tacqueria in the Mission - 2nd only to Cancun. Frankly, they're almost exactly the same - huge portions, dripping with gooey cheese, and smothered in avocado and sour cream. The only difference is the carnitas - at Cancun they are thrown on the stove, whereas at Farolito they are kept in a container of meaty juice. The problem is this can make the rest of the quesadilla soggy, and doesn't have the same level of crispy, fried goodness that the other one possesses.\n\nBut, at the end of the day (or I should say, night), it's still freakin' delicious, and biting into a warm, greasy, gooey serving of happiness is one of the best ways to end an epic night in the Mission.", "author": "Kelsey E."}

Yeah, I mean you -- the one in line who has to tell the order-taker exactly what goes in and what must stay out of their burrito!\n\nFarolito has the best-tasting pollo asado of the cheap taquerias (Papalote's is supreme, overall) making it a great place to satisfy your craving for a chicken burrito, quesadilla or what have you.\n\nAre ya ready for some fat?  Hell yeah!  Aight then, order the Quesadilla Super Suiza (DO IT) with a meat of your choice (I recommend the chicken).  Decadence.  Savory bits of meat suspended in loads of queso fresco AND sour cream with slices of creamy avocado, it hits all your yummy places for an oralgasmic experience.  All folded up in a flour tortilla, then grilled, then chopped in half.  It's enough to feed two, or just feed you if you're ready to consign yourself to the couch where you WILL make lowing noises like a walrus for the rest of your day!\n\nBe sure you nab some salsa or pico from the bar to kick up the heat, and do get some lime slices to add some zing, and some pickled peppers because, well, they're looking at you with dewy eyes and mewling.\n\nTipy-tips just for you:\nFarolito is very crowded during meal hours and after 11pm -- especially on the weekends, so expect to wait in line and then wait as long as 10 minutes for your order. No reason to cry and lament on Yelp about the place being packed all the time, you will get why it is as soon as you chew your first bite.\nif you're shooting by, do take away a side-order of their chicken to toss in your own homemade quesadilla, or salad, or tacos, or whatever.  Best $2.75 you'll spend that day.\nDon't order the chips, they're crappy.\n\nFarolito used to have a health score of just 68 -- which they almost defiantly displayed at their front door (ha, and it had zero impact on the crowds lining up for taqueria tastiness).  No longer in violation, they have a score in the 90s despite how messy it can seem.

The only difference between the Super Burrito and Regular Burrito is that Super Burrito has the ingredients of a Regular Burrito (rice, cheese, beans, choice of meat) in addition sour cream and avocado slices. \n\nThere were some steak pieces in my burrito that were burnt or like cartilage.

They make some mean burritos. However, my recent visits have made me downgrade it to 3 stars. They are just a bit too inconsistent (recently) to be my go-to taqueria. I went a few weeks ago for a pastor burrito, and the burrito was good and the meat was tender and spicy, but it also ended up being pretty oily. Yesterday, I had the super nachos with pastor, and the meat just wasn't as good. It was not as oily, but much more bland than I was used to -- maybe they didn't want to include all of the oil on the nachos because it would be so easy to see, and maybe that's where all the flavor was. Other times, their burritos can be on the dry side, especially when their carnitas -- which are good, but not amazing -- are involved. I didn't finish the large portion of nachos last night, but I woke up in the middle of the night with a stomach ache, and I can't even blame the alcohol for that. \n\nAlso, being super dirty and unkempt is not a requirement for a Mission taqueria. When I went a few weeks ago, there were lots of tables with stuff all over them, which clearly hadn't been cleared for at least a few seatings, as more and more stuff was getting pushed to the side of the table. A little cleanliness never hurt anyone!\n\nDespite this, I know I'll be back in the future, because on the right night, El Farolito perfectly hits the spot.

There is only one Mexican taco truck in LA that I believe is better than El Farolito (FYI, it's ALJ Taco Truck w/ the best empanadas in human history). \n\nAnyway -- El Farolito is open late at night, always bustling with drunk night owls coming from Medjool, Benders, or Bruno's.

The nachos were filled with carne asada, sour cream, cheese, jalapenos, onions, salsa, and much more. The taqueria is not stingy on toppings whatsoever and it's a simple place and it's open late!

We met up at El Farolito for burritos one night, and I think I was expecting something similar to Papalote.  Not so much - El Farolito is a true dive.  I got the carne asada super burrito, and the carne asada was so deliciously fried with just the right amount of fat.  The super burrito was huge, and afterwards, I thought I should've ordered the regular burrito instead.  My friend insisted that the regular burritos are the same size just without all of the good stuff like the guac, sour cream, etc.  \n\nWe ate at the restaurant, but it's not really the kind of place where you want to hang out for a while.  Best bet would be to eat while you walk or take it home...  \n\nThe best part is that it's such a steal - a giant, delicious burrito for $5!\n\nI've never been for late night burritos but it's definitely on my list...!", "author": "Wendy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-12", "description": "Fellow Intrepid Gringo Pie Holers! \n\nYour Captain, accompanied by the lovely and vivacious Sandy S, dined herein on the eve of the Okie Dokie Karaoke UYE held at The Mint, which was hosted by the incomparable Alexandria N a few weeks ago. \n\nHaving walked and walked from the Civic Center Bart Station, we ended up chilled, windburned, plain tuckered out, and utterly lost. A couple of kindly San Franciscans took pity on us and steered us to the right bus line to reach this joint. \n\nAfter fortifying ourselves and recovering from our ordeal with one or three libations at the El Farolito Bar, which is just next door to this place, and will also  be reviewed separately, we joined the line of patrons waiting to order their eats at this fabled venue. \n\nOne is first struck upon approach, by the frenetic energy of this busy place, as well as its charming, shabby \"sheikiness\". \n\nFrom the peeling paint on the ceiling, which one hopes won't end up in one's order, to the patina of grungy venerability, which many joints have tried to affect artificially with varying degrees of success, but which can only be authentically acquired by decades of earnest service, it fairly screams \"ethnic diamond-in-the-rough\"! \n\nYour Captain had thought this was the birthplace of the 'Mission style burrito\".   But found, after performing the due diligence he should have, before heading to the Mission for this historic dish, it is not.  It is however a reasonable facsimile, and we loved it anyway. \n\nSome Mexican Nationals, having cherished ideals concerning authenticity, whose fierce and justifiable pride in the glorious culinary traditions of their homeland, have panned joints like this one, as well as burritos in general, because they either don't exist back home, or differ markedly from the dishes of the same names, found there. \n\nWhile The Captain respects, and even reveres the opinions of these better traveled ones, who are truly qualified to make these judgments, he still adheres to one simple rule. \n\nIs it good, especially for the price, or not? And if it is or isn't, just how good is it or isn't it? \n\nThe US, for better or worse, is not only our planet's greatest ethnic melting pot, it is also its largest crucible for forging the evolution and fusion of diverse cuisines, into variations which can be new, exciting, and even spectacular. \n\nSadly some of these, even quite popular ones, descend into bland banality at the hands of commercialized mass marketers, but this doesn't seem to be the case universally, where Central American, South American, and Caribbean cuisines are concerned. \n\nThe burrito, especially the \"Super\" or \"Mission Style\" is said to have originated in the produce fields of Salinas in the 1950's, and even earlier, where farmers competed for the best cooks to feed their crews of Mexican fieldworkers, which in turn, attracted the most skilled and productive among the legions of migrant laborers. \n\nIn 1961, a taqueria called \"El Faro\" unwittingly unleashed these savory dreadnoughts upon the world, by introducing the first \"Mission style burrito\". El Farolito, which is part of a local chain, apparently was one of many joints, who glommed onto this success shortly after the dish's original debut, and along with several others in the Mission District, it prospers to this day. \n\nI ordered a super burrito with my favorite and inevitable meat choice, lengua, and Sandy opted for a couple of tacos, however, I don't recall her meat choice. \n\nThe array of salsas etc, available was formidable and excellent with the exception of the escabeche. (Pickled, veggies, usually including jalapenos, dear Gringos.). It was canned, but everything else was fresh and vibrant. \n\nAs we enjoyed our meals, sipping bottled beer from the large choice available in the cold case behind the counter, we watched the patrons come and go. Sleek, prosperous urbanites mingled freely with students, day laborers, artists, and the rest of the usual eclectic mix found where tourists are rarely seen in The City. \n\nAs much as I loved this colorful establishment with it's unhindered view of their hardworking, cheerful crew preparing mountains of meats, rice and beans etcetera, I was sadly compelled to subtract a star. \n\nThe generous serving of flavorful lengua which my stupendously proportioned burrito was constructed around, was unfortunately, a bit tough.\n\nI have been served beef tongue many times, and although quality of flavor can vary, the buttery tenderness, which characterizes this part of the beef critter's anatomy almost never does. I am guessing it was cooked at too high a temperature, and for not a long enough time. \n\nEverything else however, was perfection wrapped in a tortilla. \n\nThe Captain shall return with Ma Megabyte in tow, and try some of the other temptations offered.\n\nCopyright 2010/2011 by Pie Hole Publishing.

I'm from Washington state, and I'm lucky enough to live in a part of the state where we have tons of taco trucks.  With that, I've become a taqueria whore.  So, when I had a recent trip to SF, I did my research, and this joint was high on my list.\n\nWent with the Super Quesadilla Suiza & a Mexican Coke (I usually go for tortas or tacos, but I thought I'd change up for this special occasion).

I was sure delicious Mexican food couldn't  be found North of -oh, I don't know- the 118, but here, in the desert of bland, I found an oasis.  With a line out the door, across the sidewalk, and threatening to overflow into the street, El Farolito got my heart racing from the very beginning.  Clearly a taqueria couldn't have this many people in line on an otherwise dead block if it wasn't amazing.  \n\nOnce I made it inside, I ordered the super veggie burrito (beans -I got black, pinto, AND refried!-  rice, cheese, sour cream. avocado, salsa) with cilantro and an orange Fanta.  Despite being crazy busy, we easily found a table, and our food was brought to us relatively quickly.  I tore back that foil and OH MY GOD THIS is what I've been searching for all this time.  Flavorful and delicious, the perfect balance of hot salsa and cool sour cream, of firm rice and ripe avocado.  This was burrito heaven and I'd been a very good girl.", "author": "Denise K."}

I had been told that these Mission-style burritos are unique and different from what I've ever had before in SoCal. So all this hype I had been hearing from my friends got me excited and eager to try the burritos here at El Farolito. \n\nI ordered the carne asada super burrito and that thing was MASSIVE. The contents of the burrito were like any other burrito I've had: beans, rice, salsa, avocado, sour cream, and carne asada. While the burrito was delicious and difficult to finish, I was a little disappointed that it didn't seem any different from any burrito I've had before. When I told my friends this, they said a multitude of things: (1) the tortillas are steamed rather than heated on a pan, (2) the ingredients are more fresh, or (3) the addition of the rice is what makes it uniquely Mission-style. *Shrug*. Like I said, I'm a burrito fan and I've tried them in many places. So while it was good here, I didn't find it spectacularly different from what I've had before although this will be my go-to place for burritos the next time I visit the city.", "author": "Michelle Y."}

I had it with the choice of al pastor, but you can choose any type of meat to your liking. Gonna be honest, for the price I paid, I was a little skeptical to be trying a burrito that big and hardy. Talk about a steal...$6? Are you kidding me?! It's been one of the best burritos I've had so far in the Bay Area. And let me say, burritos like that are a dime a dozen. I know I've been spoiled by the Mexican food from SoCal but this one ranks high up there.\n\nThis burrito I had really hit the spot. The meat was very juicy and tender. The fresh avocado, salsa, sour cream, onions, beans, rice, etc- they all worked like a team. And in doing so, this burrito scored big. WIN! \n\nService is efficient, especially in the wee hours of the night. And you can watch your food being made as you stand in line (and perhaps sober up) while you wait. Also it was crowded when we came but we were lucky enough to get a table when we arrived.\n\nOk it's not the most appealing of all places.

He said he'd gone to some of the more fancy and famous restaurants and thought they were good but nothing had wowed him and he didnt' realize it was so expensive, so we went here. \n\nWe walked in with suits and ended up getting a lot of food. \n\nWhen I've eaten in L.A. and NY, the mexican food is much different than in the bay area.  Some of my friends from other parts of the country have said this restaurant is just ok but not great and I think that's the reason.  I think L.A. especially is obsessed with more trendy ingredients and also lime which I'm not into on my mexican food. \n\nAgain, it's their opinion and not everyone will like every restaurant. \n\nMy favorite is always the carne asada with a mess of salsa.  We had that and the meat was grilled perfectly and was so tasty.  I like it hot and the salsa made me think of my grandma; it hit the spot.\n\nWe also had the tacos.  I love the grilled steak but my friend loves tongue so he had the beef tongue and loved it.  He said it wasn't chewy and the beef flavor was strong and fresh and not overpowering. \n\nI do have to agree the burritos are really good but not the greatest on occasion.  I don't like huge portions at restaurants too much and I think their portions are very good.  \n\nI've never gone their late night, only during the day and evening so I can't tell you how the food is.  Sometimes the quality can be tarnished when it's so busy so I would check with others that eat late night to see what they say.\n\n\nPros: \nGreat fresh food; great meat and tongue.  Love the grilled steak.  Great spicy Salsa. Carne Asada and tacos are my favorite. \n\nCons:\nBurritos are good but at times, they have been so so.

Finally made my way here for the first time after the Yelp Pley party and dang what a good idea!\n\nAs sober as I was, yea yea I know there was an open bar but DD status, the quesadillas here CAN NOT be beat. Not even by anything I've tried in SD, OC or LA. I think its the mix of the sour cream with the cheese & meat that just oozes pure goodness.\n\nCarne Asada burrito was pretty huge but it wasn't anything special compared to the quesadilla. Each time I bit into my burrito I was hoping to get some of that quesadilla oomph but I think it's just all too spread out when food's wrapped like that. Hot sauces compliment the food well althought out of the three I tried none of them were mouth burning hot, medium at best.\n\nService is a bit slow, I got lucky and beat the drunkie crowd that came in shortly after us, even saw some Yelpers wearing their pins from the party.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-12-04", "description": "It's 2am and you need a burrito.  What do you do?  No, Taco Bell totally doesn't count.  The answer is YOU HIT UP EL FAROLITO!  Why you ask?  Well because they have the best Carne Asada burrito I have EVER had.  Seriously, this burrito tastes so good that if I was Agent Sands (Johnny Depp's character in Once Upon A Time In Mexico) I would have to shoot the cook just to keep things fair for all the other burrito spots in SF.  Ha!\n\nSo here are my thoughts on the RADtastic Mexican food that is El Farolito:\n\nFOOD - Hands down, one of the best places to get a burrito at in San Francisco.  As I mentioned above, I'd definitely recommend getting the Carne Asada burrito with all of the fixings.  Make sure to also add sour cream, guacamole and avocado to it as well.  Trust me, you gotta add these extra condiments to really experience this burrito in all of its awesomeness.  I also gotta give a special shout-out to the red sauce/salsa that they offer with their chips.  I'm not gonna lie, it's pretty badass.  Watch out though, the salsa has definitely got some kick, kid!\n\nTHINGS THAT AREN'T JUST THAT COOL ABOUT EL FAROLITO'S - Well the title of this section says it all.\n\n1.  The first thing that isn't that cool about this place is the size of the restaurant.  It's really small, the layout isn't that cool and sometimes the tables are sticky.  Honestly, it's pretty pinner.\n\n2.  The second thing that isn't that cool about this place are the long lines.  Now don't get me wrong, I really don't mind waiting in long lines for good food.  The last thing I'm going to do is penalize a place because they are popular.  My problem with the line at El Foralito's is that it isn't run as efficiently as other \"long-ass line\" places that I've been too.  They know that they make bomb-ass burritos that are going to draw a crowd.  They should really start stepping their game up to help move things along in this area.\n\n3.  The third thing that isn't that cool about this place is the shady clientele.  I'm not trying to say that it's super ghetto, but...okay, yeah, that's exactly what I'm trying to say...it's super ghetto.  In El Farolito's defense, I've never been to this restaurant before 2am.  That being said, I gotta believe the reason I'm running into vandals and not loving families is because I'm there at a not so normal time.  BUT that does segway the review into another COOL point for them.  THEY ARE OPEN UNTIL 4AM ON THE WEEKENDS.  OH SNAP!\n\nAnother interesting thing to note, well interesting to me at least, is that I recently discovered there are a few El Farolito restaurants around the Bay.  I know, I know.  The fact that it is now becoming a chain restaurant makes it not that cool, but don't knock it until you've tried it.  By the way, in case you're wondering, I just made that phrase up right now.  Aren't I clever?  ANYWAYS, the only one I can vouch for is the one on Mission street that my man Fernando works at.  PSSSST.  You wanna know a secret?  Okay, I don't really know who Fernando is, but all of the cool people that are allowed to cut in line all seem to know him, so I figured a shout-out ain't hurtin' nobody.\n\nSo there you have it.  A 5 star review for their Carne Asada burrito and business hours, but a 2 star review for the overall rating of the establishment.  \n\n5 stars - 2 stars = 3 stars.  \n\nI gotta say, this was a pretty good review by me and I am now officially in the mood for Mexican food.  I'm totally going to have this for dinner tonight...so you know what that means, don't you?  Oh, you don't?  Well, in other words, just like my good friend Justin Timberlake, I'm bringing Mexy back.

Yeah, Pancho Villa's salsa's are awesome, and Papalote can make a mean bougy-ass burrito, but El Farlito is still the best. I can't really say what distinguishes it from the others, as the French would say it's got a certain Je ne sais quoi. Or perhaps it's the fact they use avocados instead of just quac?

But there was a huge line (which went by very quickly), and my friends were raving about it, so I buckled and gave it a try. I ordered a Carne Asada Super Burrito for myself and Super Nachos for the group. We sat down and eagerly waited for our food (I still had no idea what I was in for) and we all dug into the nachos the moment they came out. I blame being tired for getting full really quickly, but I did manage to get a couple of bites out of my burrito. I normally stay away from beans and salsa in my burritos, but I was so hungry when I ordered that I didn't bother asking to take them out - and I don't regret it! It was really tasty, and the burrito was HUGE. Lots of tasty goodness inside without being too greasy or saucy. The meat wasn't dry, the beans and rice weren't soggy, and there was a lot of guacamole and salsa. Definitely enough for three meals (I realize I don't eat a lot so this isn't saying much...). Also really good because it was so cheap! \n\nLike I said before, it isn't exactly the cleanest place but honestly, I'm guessing that everyone's usually so tired (and hungry and/or inebriated) that it doesn't really matter. There's a lot of seating space inside, so it's great for groups. I highly recommend El Farolito for late night munchies.

I can vouch for that.  I have been here sober as a 10 year recovering alcoholic and found that the food is still delicious.  \n\nEl Farolito has a wide variety of things to choose from but my fav is the carne asada Super Suiza. The Super Suiza that they serve up here is nice and cheesy with grilled carne asada, avocado, and sour cream.  When you get that perfect bite with all of these ingredients in your mouth, you taste the juicy carne asada, the subtle flavor of the cheese, the fresh avocado, and a hint of the sour cream.

Instead of them making your burrito right away they have a guy going to each person in line and taking your order, following by you paying, then you wait for your number to be called. Prices are what you'd expect with burritos being around $6 and beers being around $3. If you haven't been to a Mission burrito shop before then you can expect to see more protein options than just chicken, pork, and steak. If you want to be adventurous try beef tongue or head. I stuck to the steak which didn't look all that amazing when it was being tossed around on the grill but when I bit into my burrito I changed my mind. The steak was incredibly tender and juicy and the burrito was great. The only issue I may have about the burrito is that there was just too much rice. It's mostly used as a filler which makes the burrito weigh the same as a newborn and I just don't think it adds much flavor. I originally wanted to eat at La Taqueria down the street (who don't even make rice) but they close earlier then El Farolito.

If this is what good mexican food is about then I should either stop eating Mexican or not bother even travelling to Mexico (as I have been there).\nIf you want cheap food by the tonn and don't care about flavour then the reviews are accurate, but if you are looking for flavorful food ---- Flee from here.\nLet me start with the simple things \" Chips\"-- It was not fresh/ too oily and tasted stale, I have had chips in a of of mexican places, fine mexican restaurants in NYC, dive Mexican places in Texas & Miami but they all have something in common. Excellent Chips & Salsa. The three flavours of Salsa was all tastless GOO with no difference between either of them!, the chips in combination with the salsa was cardboard dipped in tastless GOO, I did not eat more that 2 chips --- Honestly Chipotle chips tasts better that this..\nI had the Chile Releno with beans and rice, it was over cheesy and bland. I was really hungry but still could not eat more than a few mouthfull, just did not do it for me. The others with me did not get thru their meals either, they said the chicken was bland, the sauce in flavourful.\nI could not believe it that I had travelled all the way from NYC to eat at this dump and also spend considerable time trying to find parking to come to the DIVE.\nIts sad that \"BurritoVille\" - multiple locations in NYC serves some fantastic burritos full of flavour - The route 66 is my favourite, also a much smaller place than this server FREE CHIPS & tongue scortching spicy salsa deep is flavor.\nWhen in NYC check it out and you will know what I am talking about.", "author": "H S."}

Thankfully there isn't a bad item on the menu, although I'm religiously partial to the Super Burrito with carne asada. \n\nThe Backstory: In 2000 I lived and worked in the Mission, a byproduct of the tech boom that was transforming the neighborhood (Hindsight's 20/20: in some ways for the worse). When I left San Francisco, I returned to Washington DC and it's premiere burrito palace, California Tortilla, but stomach ached for it's separated love. (Although I've always held a place in my heart for CT, it has never been able to fill the void left in my stomach's heart.)\n\nFast forward 8 years and the prodigal son returned to 24th and Mission, luggage in tow. And this time I brought my brother, ever the burrito skeptic. As my friends can see in video and images on Facebook, we both bowed down to the burrito gods in the promised land. \n\nI've seen paradise; perhaps this is my penance for continuing to patronize McPotle. Now I'm relegated to gloomy Washington DC and the saturated landscape of inauthentic \"burrito\" purveyors. \n\nTaqueria el Farolito is so good that I would consider making a day-trip just to have a burrito. Crack is whack. Taqueria el Farolito is the bomb-diggity.", "author": "Justin S."}

I usually go with the carne asada super burrito; great taste, ingredient distribution, and consistency for like 6.60, plus it's large enough to feed a family of four. The suizas are also pretty legit for snackin, the suiza para dos ($10) is a great value when you're splitting with a friend or feel like going bigtime. The tomatillo sauce is pretty delicious. \n\nThis place also has some great hours of operation, great for those midnight munchies. Go before noon or later on weekday nights to avoid large crowds, weekend nights are nightmares and I've had them miss an order on one of those busy nights.", "author": "Samu S."}

Walking in, you can see all the meat and everything being slice and diced by the wonderful chefs. I ordered the super burrito with carnitas and it was around 7-8 bucks? Finding a table at that time wasn't too challenging, but it was still packed! People came from clubs and other events as well. We didn't wait that long, and the chef brought the food to us. When we got our burritos, I realized that this burrito was HUGE! They gave me soooo much food! It was filling and I was satisfied with it. I just wish the carnitas had more flavor to it. I tried my friend's horchata, and man, it tasted like powdered horchata. Not good at all. I wouldn't recommend getting the horchata here.

But I was expecting a life-changing burrito experience, and this wasn't it. I've definitely had better burritos. Though tender, the meat lacked flavor and didn't have that nice crispiness that I love about good carnitas. \n\nI really don't mind hole in wall establishments, but I wasn't a big fan of the seating situation here. I was in around 5:20 pm, and it was packed. A good sign, of course, but there was nowhere to even wait for my burrito without feeling awkward. Booo. To be honest, I don't think I'll be back - I'd rather experiment with some of the Mission's other taquerias.", "author": "Miranda N."}

OMG, we were making play barf sounds the night before and this time I wasn't playing. It smelled sooooo gross, like someone took a lot of toilet paper and stuffed it down a clogged toilet, but it wouldn't go down so they kept flushing and flushing and all it would do was make it worse and make the smell permeate. Besides that, I don't know what the actual bathroom looked like. There was an invisible force field of stank that prevented me from crossing the line into the unknown.\n\nAnyways, with that said, if you can grab it to go, I'd recommend that. Or hover over people who are down to their last bite and swoop on dem seats, ya heard!", "author": "Clarisse C."}

Possibly the only burrito I will ever eat in burrito form (I hate food that is messy to eat, so I consume most of my burritos in bowls). Stuffed full with so much food, and YET it never ever fell apart. AMAZING. Also tasted so fresh and with ingredients that tasted like they were just cooked (and had not been sitting behind the counter for days). Cash only though. We also started to get serenaded in Spanish by someone walking around - kind of weird, but still cool. The only thing is that the place is a little dirty, but I guess there are sacrifices to be made for good food. Cute little booths to sit at.

Known as one of the places credited for the Mission/San Francisco-style burrito, the enormous, foil-wrapped inspiration for Chipotle burritos, El Farolito in my opinion is one of the best burrito stands.\n\nStep inside El Farolito, and you wouldn't think it to be a San Francisco institution. It's loud, dirty, furnished with formica-and-wood booths, and has your questionable looking salsa bar for the complimentary stale tortilla chips. Its patrons include goths, hippies, BART commuters, and the occasional Asian like me. Perhaps its scruffiness is what gives El Farolito its charm. It definitely made me feel like I was back at one of the many Mexican food joints in South Los Angeles.\n\nI can't wrap my head around it, but there's something about El Farolito's that puts it above other burrito places like Chipotle. My burrito, a super carnitas burrito, was well assembled, with each bite consisting of a little bit of meat, beans, sour cream, and rice. The carnitas was amazing. Juicy and tender, yet with just a slight fried texture. Perfectly complimenting the meat was a generous portion of sour cream, which for some reason had a slight citrus/orange flavor to it that made the burrito even more delicious. The beans and rice were perfectly flavored and were in perfect quantities in the burrito. Not to mention this burrito had GUACAMOLE! All this prepared fresh after you order it. No industrial assembly line, no \"burrito bol\", and no need to mention about farm-raised meat.\n\nI've promised myself that someday I'll take BART through the city extra early and make a quick stop at El Farolito for their breakfast burrito. Something tells me it'll be a good day when that happens.", "author": "Scott J."}

We got the Super Burrito. They only accept cash. Good thing my friend had cash... The super burrito was pretty big, but I've seen much bigger in other places. I would say this was more like a medium burrito, but it was still too big for me to finish. It contained fresh avocados, a major bonus! And the carne asada was nothing like I've ever tasted in a burrito! Think, juicy, with a bit of crunchiness from coming straight off the grill! We asked for the hottest hot sauce and the guy pointed to all of them and said they are all hot so we took all of them, tried all of them, and none of them were hot at all to my liking so minus a star for not having real hot hot sauce in a Mexican restaurant. \n\nThe food from what I tasted is worth it. The price is worth it. The service is pretty good too. But I didn't give it a 5 star because of how dirty the place is and that the hot sauce was lacking. I also didn't like how it was so narrow that our table is literally next to someone's butt while they are standing. Other than that, great place. I'd like to come back and try a different plate.", "author": "Lucky N."}

El Farolito will bring that authentic grease, fillingness, and keep your wallet big enough for another round of El Farolito the very next day.

My husband and I both ordered chicken tacos. The chicken was tender, but not especially flavorful. The salsas we tried were too mild. And my taco was overwhelmed with sour cream (it felt like I was eating a sour cream taco).\n\nIt seems like the burritos have a lot of great reviews, so maybe this is the dish to get?

I think El Farolito is supposed to be one of the Burrito Gods of San Francisco or something. And yes, the burritos are solid, but nothing special. I mean, you can get an extremely well-made burrito with delicious carne asada or carnitas in a ton of places in California (thank God for that). But what really stood out for me was the mighty quesadilla. I have learned, by dining in Mexican restaurants where actual Mexicans eat, that quesadillas are not just thin, lifeless flour tortillas with melting yellow cheese in the middle. Heck to the no. True quesadillas are more like monster soft tacos. The exterior (the flour tortilla) should display an array of beautiful, golden markings received from being pressed to a hot griddle while the interior should be filled to bursting with meat, cheese (usually white), and avocado. The carne asada really shone in the quesadilla. \n\nMy only problem is that this place is extremely filthy and they allow the homeless to come in and attack you while you eat. One star because the owner should probably do something about this. Oh, and there's powder in my horchata.", "author": "Christine N."}

In my opinion, everything else is pretty lackluster when you know where to get good eats in the Mission. Even though El Faro is only really good for their burritos, they excel at them.\n\nWith the super burrito, you can look forward to a good balance between the meat and everything else. My last couple of burritos were always balanced with a good portion of meat on one side of the tortilla and beans/rice/cheese on the other. Don't shortchange yourself and get the regular; you'll want the sour cream and avocado slices that comes with the super. Slap some pico de gallo on there and you'll have a burrito bonanza in every bite. The consistency of my burritos should definitely be commended. My only problem with the burritos is the tortilla: it's your standard, \"we've been sitting in this bag for a week\" type of tortilla. I'm not even sure if El Faro bothers to steam them, and it shows in the lack of flavor and unnatural chewiness of the tortilla. I guess I've just been spoiled by La Palma's super burritos. Those bad boys are much bigger and much more flavorful for the same price, but El Faro is not a bad choice at all in a pinch.\n\nIf you don't want to make the journey out to other good eats or if you're caught with the 2am bar crowd, El Faro is a decent choice for filling that burrito void.", "author": "Frank Y."}

I would say there's a one-in-three chance they'll get your order wrong, and I don't mean they'll add guacamole. A couple times I've gotten shrimp in my vegetarian burrito, and one time, I got beef.\n\nBecause I was curious, I actually visited the location myself one Friday night. That was a big mistake. The line was long, which wouldn't be so bad except that almost everyone in line was a hipster. I'm not exaggerating. So in addition to having to wait in line in a dirty, noisy place, I had to listen to fourteen conversations about track bikes, flashmob pillow fights, and RC-car parties. And 90 percent of the interlocutors were wearing the hipster uniform--conductor cap, too-tight short jeans, and black-rimmed glasses.\n\nDid I mention the place was dirty? Disgustingly so. I'm all for greasy spoons, but I also know when there's a significant risk of finding rat feces in your burrito. And they got my order wrong again; I guess they like giving away free shrimp.\n\nI will never come here again, and I suggest you don't either.", "author": "John S."}

The meat tasted a little funny, but not bad at all. I looked at the meat and it was a little off-colored. Three quarters of the way done with my \"carne asada\" super burrito, I noticed I had not eaten any sour cream nor cheese. Did El Farolito rip me off by giving me a regular burrito instead? I turned around to Amir A and noticed a dabble of sour cream on the corner of his mouth. Wha??? \"Hey, how come his regular burrito came with sour cream?\" I proceeded to finish the last quarter of my burrito in hopes that all the cheese and sour cream was somehow disproportionately placed in the bottom.

Of course, Yelpers eat this stuff up (literally), which is why El Farolito's review count handily beats those other 3 (indeed, is there a more-Yelped taqueria in the entire Bay Area?)\n\nI was planning on getting a burrito, but one look at the Super Suiza Quesadilla and I was already an addict.  The wife wanted chorizo, so we basically wound up with the greasiest pile of hot deliciousness I've ever had, and one that absorbs Tapatio hot sauce like a Millbrae Pancake absorbs syrup.  For those who can't afford an afternoon-long food coma, the tostada de ceviche is also impressive.  My only regret is that the chips aren't fresh.   \n\nAnyway, it may never make Michael Bauer's Top 100 (unlike a certain taqueria down the block), but El Farolito is certainly a landmark beacon of comfort on the wild shore of Mission St.  My next goal is to figure out whether all those other El Farolitos in town are affiliated, or if taquerias just really like the lighthouse motif...", "author": "Wes M."}

Take a big old bite of vegetarian super burrito, and let us say AMEN!\n\nNew Years day, hungover, and exhausted off four hours of sleep, boyfriend and I were craving a Mexi-meal. Actually, we were really horny for Nick's Crispy Taco's, but the damn place was closed, which worked out, because it forced me to drive to the Mission, where I would meet my future Lovah, El Farolito. \n\nPeople think vegetarian burritos are dull, unadventurous wraps, but to me, they're perfection. I eat the chicken burritos on occasion, but always find myself wanting it to be meatless. The veggie burrito at El Farolito is really one of the best burritos I've ever had. The two deciding factors are: the rice and the cheese. The rice had this amazing rich and spicy flavor and the cheese, well the cheese was melty and delicious. I often can't even tell there's cheese in a burrito. But these bad boys are filled with cheesy goodness. \n\nOther bonus points are for:\n\na grilled tortilla, rather than a steamed one\n\nchunks of avocado, rather than soupy guac\n\nthe right amount of sour cream, rather than a white gloppy mess\n\nand beans, glorious beans (they have black beans! huzzah!)!!!\n\nAll other burritos I've had in SF pale in comparison to El Farolito. Boyfriend was raving about his Carne Asada burrito too, and tells me that we're going to have to cross town anytime we're feeling the need for Mexican food, because the Mission is the Mecca of beans and rice!\n\nThe horchata was yummy too, like French toast in a drink!

What I got was a burrito full of nothing but cheese and sour cream. I'm not exaggerating. Well, maybe there were like 5 beans and perhaps 6 grains of rice in there. Needless to say it was totally gross. To top it off, my friend and I had made the ill-fated decision to eat in instead of take out and there were at least two Mission crazies (I say that with the most affection possible) leaning into our booth and jabbering loudly and lecherously in our ears.\n\nCrazy lecherous jabbering plus cheese and sour cream nasty mess = blech\n\nDid I mention that my husband (then boyfriend) once found a huge safety pin in the Farolito salsa as he was pouring it onto his burrito??!! \n\nGrody.", "author": "miss m."}

Or (as in my case), get a burner friend who keeps a live/work in the Mission District.  But make sure they're a foodie first.\n\nYeah, pretty much the default place when in for Mission Mexican.  That's a lofty statement, because The Mission has a ton of yummy food, but this place is the gastrointestinal equivalent of binge drinking.\n\nTheir burritos are the best I've found in the Mission and that's saying a lot.  Their quesadillas are phenomenal as well.  But what gets me is the Super Nachos.  I *can't* order super nachos anywhere else because it feels like I'm cheating on them.  Remember when you were starving in a dorm room and decided to make nachos by putting everything on so much as a nodding acquaintance with Mexican cuisine on a bunch of tortilla chips and throwing it on the hot plate for ten minutes?  You'd get this four pound plate of goo that would feed you and two friends for the entire game?  They're like that, only better balance of ingredients, real avocados, and no tobasco sauce.  Since I'm only in the Mission once or twice a year I'm pretty screwed when it comes to nachos.  Fortunately I'm working an escrow there right now so for the next couple of months I'll get one or two more chances to get the super nachos.\n\nThe food is prepared pretty much in front of you.  They have Jarritos, Mexican Coca-cola, and standard canned fare, so their attention is on the food (as it should be).

But, I usually get the suisa, and it's not a mound of chopped steak ... you actually get a STEAK in your quesidilla suisa!  Top it with their spicy salsa, have some aquas frescas --- did I spell that right??  anyway ... it'd darn good!!!  The line gets long, but that just tells you how good it is.  Lots of straglers from the bar next door.  I gotta take other yelpers advice and get a buritto, but I can do without all the rice and beans ... just too filling for me.  And we all know that for most of us guys, it's all about the meat, cheese and salsa!  It is really blue collar, and really dirty, but you don't mind once you try it!\r\n\r\nUPDATE -- I was in the area and was craving Alambres, and hoped it was good as it was in the outer Mission.  Sadly, it was not.  There were no bell peppers, smaller portion, cold rice, and no chili sauce!  I had to add the salsa, which made the dish cold.  I have finally tried the burrito, and it looks like the secret is the roll in on the grill to crisp it a bit.  Still good, but the Alambres was a real let down.  If I want that again, I will head further out at Onondaga, but for some reason, it's more dangerous out there.", "author": "Michael M."}

Anyway, I always got extra sour cream on mine because I felt like their super burritos went too easy on this magical white substance. Upon a second rendezvous with this particular menu item, I realized without extra sour cream the meat was entirely way too salty and no amount of rice or beans could save it. It was also extremely dry, and I found myself dipping my burrito into my salsa (which isn't bad, by the way) constantly, in efforts to hydrate the desert of saltyness. The carne asada was also very burnt, and not very tender. That's my take on it.\n\nOn a side, un-burrito related note, the carne asada quesadillas were AMAZING. If you enjoy thick, hearty slabs of avocado, lots of cheese, and a truckload of sour cream on top of tender slices of steak, this is your very good friend.

But, this place surprised me like no other. \n\nI, myself, have no preference/knowledge in Mexican food, so my friend ordered a super quesadilla suiza and we shared. I actually had really bad experience with quesadillas because of the cheese part, but it looked so good when served, the wrap was the right thickness and crispiness, they gave you huge amount of avacado (i took one out to eat individually, and it was so flavorful and savory that it didnt taste like a vegetable anymore), the cheese was just the right amount i can tolerate and its melted just right so that when you bite it, it's stringy, the onions were minced to little pieces and fully cooked so the taste was soaked into the meat. Their salsa was soooooo damn good, one of them was green and almost herby, and the other ones were chunky and spicy (: My friend told me to try Horchata, and it was refreshing and went so well with the meal (:  It's not 5 stars because i was really disappointed with the chips, they weren't fresh or crisp, and they were too thick and tasted dull.\n\nIf every mexican restaurents can up this bar, i actually wouldn't mind eating mexican food everyday\n\np.s let's goo eat at this place, Alex and David!", "author": "Lizi F."}

However, I thought it was mostly just \"pretty good\", not amazing. To start with, the chips are craptastic. Which is sad, since they appear to have a variety of tasty salsas.\n\nI ordered a crispy chicken taco and an al pastor super quesadilla suiza. The quesadilla was huuuuge. I did not need the taco. The chicken was super bland, though. Skip the chicken. As for the al pastor, I'm still confused. From my understanding, it should be spit-grilled. I swear the menu said stewed. However, it was really greasy, so it didn't seem like either of those things. Maybe I got something else by mistake. That said, it was good. I think I would have liked the quesadilla way more had the menu mentioned it was loaded with tomatoes, so I could have ordered it without.

Here's what I found, having shifted my allegiance to Can-Cun more than two years ago:\n\nThe line moves quickly, and the orders come out fast. I've never been bothered by how tiny and dirty it is, so that's fine.\n\nBut the menu is somewhat confusing. A veggie burrito is around $5, and a super burrito (with meat) is $5.45. But a super veggie burrito is also $5.45. So is a regular burrito (minus avocado and sour cream, basically). There's no scale, seemingly.\n\nI LOVE that they still grill the tortillas. Not enough places do this.\n\nAnd I also love that they use avocado slices instead of guacamole. I'm admittedly a guac-snob, and most places' guac just isn't up to snuff. Avocado is more appealing, also, if you dip chips into your burrito like I do.\n\nThe non-chunky red salsa is still my favorite. I would quite happy on a diet of it-and-chips forever. The tomatillo is magical also.\n\nBut the biggest drawback, and this may have been a one-off, was the fact that I didn't get chips.

It's gotta be the perfect drunk food, I'm convinced.\n\nYou go in and stand in a single-file line while watching the food for the customers ahead of you being assembled. This both infuriates the hungry beast inside of you and caresses your olfactory receptors at the same time. It's an evil but well-planned system. The line has been known to stretch out the door but usually moves quickly enough to get to the actual chowing down within 10 or 15 minutes. While waiting (or steaming with hunger/anger) in line, you decide on a choice of burrito, quesadilla, or nachos, and maybe 2 or 3 more options. I appreciate a simple and easy-to-decipher menu, especially while intoxicated, and Farolito excels in this category.\n\nAt the register, they take your order...then you sit down with your chips and salsa and salivate until your food arrives steaming with Mexican goodness!\n\nThe best thing about El Farolito is that all the ingredients are so fresh and also that almost every dish comes with big slices of avocado. Come on, now. When does this craziness end?\n\nI think the mouth-watering flavor their food delivers can be attributed to the delicious creamyness in every dish. I don't know how they do it, but there's this creamy factor that just satisfies so deeply...to the emptiest pit of your stomach. \n\nAll the food is hot, creamy, full of flavor and freshness, so cheap, and more than you ever need to eat. The winning combination for an awesome Mexican joint. Highly recommended!", "author": "Maria P."}

As a Texan, I believe that rice has no business being in a burrito. Who needs a carb rolled around some more carbs? Gimme the good shit--meats and cheeses. So I always order a quesadilla in these here parts. A quesadilla is all of the burrito goodness without those useless rice and beans.\n\nThe Fart's quesadillas are a thing of beauty. There's really nothing finer than stumbling into their BRIGHT YELLOW (I frequent The Fart at the corner of 24th and Alabama) shining edifice at 1:30 in the morning, sloshy and happy from a night at the bars. There have been many a night where it was my intention to stumble straight home from the bar without passing Go. But then, there it is, calling to me like a beacon, its jaundiced glow beckoning me like a warm and sexy lover. \n\nYou place your order, and five to seven minutes later you are rewarded with a pouch of foil that is roughly the shape, size, and weight of a rugby ball. As you peel the foil back, you are blessed with the sweet, sweet smell of grilled pollo and grilled pollo greases. \n\nSweet Mother Mary, Virgin of Guadalupe, the next five to seven minutes that you spend scarfing down this rugby ball of goodness will be among the finest of your life. Perhaps even finer than the last five to seven hours that you've spent funneling Jack n' Cokes down your throat. \n\nDon't get me wrong, a hangover that involves the better part of a bottle of Jack Daniel's and an El Farolito quesadilla isn't a pretty thing to behold. It's sorta like shitting out a cactus wrapped in sandpaper. But that's something to worry about in the future. Right now, right now? You are in the moment.

I saw this cracked out lady stick a burrito somewhere it shouldn't be and then make someone else consume it.  \n\nNo wait, wrong taqueria and wrong night.\n\nAhh...  well damn, I guess I'll just have to tell the mundane details of the how I ended up here.  Well, I've started frequenting Doc's Clock on Tuesday evenings.  After a friend started hyping this place up more than Paris Hilton's next bad move, I decided to give in and walk a few blocks south.  This week was different, I was more sober than usual.  While being a consistent carne asada consumer, I broke ranks and ordered the carnitas.  There was something about that juicy fresh looking pork sitting in that pan that wouldn't let me stop staring.  Uh, oh... Two things different from my usual burrito experience, would this be a harbinger of burrito horror?  I ordered and waited.\n\nI had managed to get one bite from the burrito while waiting for my friend to use the bathroom, but I couldn't help it, I had to pull the fall back technique of stoners and drunks on the move... the eat and walk.  I wasn't even wasted but there was something about that damn burrito that wouldn't let me put it down.  I'm sure I looked like an absolute slob or an ambitious stoner as I made my way down Mission, ravenously devouring this carnitas burrito.  I mean I probably looked drunk since I couldn't keep my face out of that burrito enough to walk, never mind the disgusted looks I received.  It was a 15-minute walk of gluttony that was more than worth it.\n\nThe lesson:  come try the food here, it's quite good.  Oh, and there is usually a line here.

And most importantly, that the food doesn't sit stagnant under heat lamps and \"dry up\" or worse, that it should form some type of living organism (like pork does) while it waits for a customer to stroll by and consume it. Some places in the Mission should require you to get a Hepatitis B shot prior to entering, but not this place. \n\nAlthough it doesn't look like much from the outside, this place gets solid marks from the health board year after year. Beacuse of the popularity of the restaurant, the food is constantly turning-over, meaning it's nice and fresh at all hours.

I dunno why they call it suiza) is the most amazing thing a drunkaholic can eat at 2:30am. The only downside is a kind of an upside: there's always a long line out the door and you'll have to wait at least 20 mins. \"HTF is this an upside,\" you ask? Because believe it or not, you're not the only drunk-off-your-ass-yahoo in line for a super suiza! Yes it's always quite the entertaining wait at El Farolito!\n\nMy latest trip to the little light involved a certain out-of-the-middle-ages-and-straight-to-the-department-store fellow that I would eventually dub \"Lothar\": An impressive 5'6\", this man-of-men boasted a full flowing blond hair not only on his head, but from cheeks, chin, neck, and even out of the top of his solid green dress shirt, similar to ivy cresting a brick wall. But his full mane isn't what catches my attention: it's the argyle-patterned wool sweater, tied neatly around his Dockers that gets me all excited! (remember, I'm drunk at this point) I bellow my best pirate \"ARRRRGGHHYLES!\" at him. He's not amused.\n\nFast forward a bit: My roommate and I are exchanging standard awkward small talk with him when a group of semi-attractive club girls appears out of nowhere (they hop out of a cab), bat their eyes at this poor unwitting Gentleman and cut in front of him (and therefore, us) in line. Nuh-uh!\n\nMe: \"What the fuck?? You girls at least gotta go behind us!\"\nLothar (taken completely aghast): \"Now THAT is quite the mouth you have young man!\" (I'm probably older than him) \"have you no respect for these lovely ladies?\"\n\nIs this guy for real?? I immediately decide his name is Lothar: \"Very good, Sir Lothar! I'm glad to see that Chivalry lives on!\" Lothar isn't pleased and keeps spouting down to me from his high horse. I guess he IS for real! A real-life Knight of the Round Table, sent forward through time by God Himself teach ME a thing or two about chivalry! \n\nlatron...\n\nLothar finishes his Mexican meal first and passes our table on his way out the door, coke bottle still in hand. My drunken reaction is to stand and raise a toast to the restaurant: \"To Lothar! Defender of Chivalry and The Free World!!\" To my complete surprise, he actually clinks his coke bottle to mine! And just when I'm about to sit back down in smug satisfaction, my wasted roommate comes out of left field, coke bottle raised, and bellows, \"MEAD!!!!!\" (yeah, wrong era but tooootally hilarious when you're drunk in a packed taqueria at 3am)", "author": "Stephen L."}

Even many of the chains (e.g. Alberto's) turn out taqueria style burritos that are out of this world.  You can even get an awesome burrito in a strip mall in Laguna Beach where 99% of the population isn't latino.  That said, I've been on my own personal quest to find good burritos in my adopted hometown of San Francisco (and environs) for the past 13 years.\n\nI've read so many rave reviews about El Farolito on here so I decided to check it out last week.  I ordered a chicken burrito without beans, and it also had avocado and cheese.  Although the chicken was moist and tender, the burrito didn't have any rice in it, which I found to be odd and the avocado was more like a runny guacamole.  The kicker here is that it cost $9.50 and they didn't even throw in a handful of chips!\n\nI can get an equally good burrito (which does have rice in it) at Taqueria Cancun or El Tonayense for about $6.50.

I was really, really disappointed, especially since I had tried tacos at La Taqueria a few days earlier and LOVED their tacos.  \n\nThe tacos from Farolito's just didn't compare.

The streets were clogged, people were crossing the busy intersection of 24th and Mission and some drivers had no regard for rules and right of way whatsoever. Finally found a sweet parking spot around the corner and we ran to go to see if our hopes and dreams would be crushed from a power outage. We peered through the window and right behind it, was a man, working on his craft, grilling tortillas and meats. We were safe! \n\nWe went inside and noticed the outage had affected the restaurant. No lights at all! The refridgerator was dead, and they had to take the tray out of the cash register to do transactions. \n\nWe ordered from the menu on the wall, lit up by the light flowing in from the street. Super Quesadilla Suiza and Super Burrito please! Both with carne asada! When our order came up, they had made a mistake and gave me 2 Quesadillas so I brought that up with the guy behind the reg. and he quickly had a burrito made for me. We thanked them and left, running to the car to devour our goodies. \n\nThe burrito is like a small child. Weighed maybe 4 lbs! I ripped off the foil and took a bite. It was nerve-wracking. The steak, beautifully marinated and grilled on the flat iron griddle, with bits of charred meat here and there, tender and juicy. The rice was a bit....overdone, a bit dry but I can let that by since they did have a power outage. \n\nThe tortilla had been warmed on the grill also, so it had a toasty, crunchy taste to it. They put it grilled side up when they wrap it, so the outside is a soft, pillowy-yet chewy texture while the inside was lightly toasty and crisp. The avocado, beans, sour cream, and salsa blendly blissfully with the entire burrito. It was great. \n\nThe gf's quesadilla was similar to my burrito, just no beans or rice.

I followed him and proceeded to flip out at the bartenders (sorry ladies!) and talk half in my shitty spanish. He finally gave me my money back after I threatened to call the police.

I enjoyed my burrito in peace, but when I had a few bites left I got up to refill my water. As soon as I turned around my table was already cleared for the next person, the rest of my food thrown away. It was literally about 5 or 6 seconds.

When I get nicely sloshed, I begin to think I cannot go on living without an El Farolito burrito.  \n\nThe decision to drive out to 24th and Mission at 2 AM usually goes against my better judgement.  But irrespective of the fact that I have to be up early the next morning, that I'm nowhere near the Mission to begin with, and that I enjoyed quite a satisfactory dinner before hitting the bar in the first place, I invariably find myself steering my car in the direction of El Farolito.  Once the seed has been planted, all counterarguments become superfluous.\n\nThe cheap, delectable Mexican fare within instantly banishes any lingering doubts and, before long, I'm enjoying the perfect burrito: exquisitely seasoned meat, fresh salsa and avocado, and the obligatory rice and beans all wrapped up in a tortilla that even tastes delicious (How do they do that?!  I probably don't want to know.)\n\nIt's enormous, so I usually end up saving some for the next night, when my El Farolito craving will undoubtedly strike again.\n\nI'm not generally a fan of superlative praise, but El Farolito makes me feel a little crazy.  So, here we go: BEST BURRITO IN SAN FRANCISCO!", "author": "Karin H."}

I didn't think I had room to even attempt the Barbacoa and figured I'd have a bite or two.  My plan didn't work as that Barbacoa taco was aburdly good.  I didn't realize Mexican food could be this good.  Unfortunately, now I have a new national favorite and a new future comparison point for which every taco will be judged.

At an easily accessible location of Mission and 24th, you can eat well in both quality and quantity without thinning your wallet.\n\nThe layout is very standard eatery affair: faux wood table and benches packed closely together, helping to staunch the already dense traffic of patrons in line to order. This isn't a fancy outing location, or even somewhere I would suggest for a first date (though there is always take out), but the food is excellent for an outing with friends or comfortable relationship.\n\nI should admit at this point that I have stayed loyal to a single plate in my outings to El Farolito and not experiment with their full menu, but given it's quality there has never been need to stray.\n\nThe Carne Asada Super Burrito, with everything, never fails to please. This alone is more than a meal in itself, containing all four food groups (if you count the tomatoes in the salsa as a fruit.) The burrito is so large and filling I usually can only eat half, saving the second half for a later meal. A mouthful of delicious, and at only $5, is something any carnivore can be pleased about.\n\nCertainly in a city with as strong a food culture as San Francicso there will be others that claim there is a better burrito and a better taqueria.

To me a burrito really can't be messed up but wow have I been wrong with other taquerias (La Cucumbre down the street ick). El farolito gave me faith again, that a burrito just because it's peasant food doesn't mean it should be acceptable for it not to have any flavor and quality.

There is plenty to choose from in \"Little Tijuana\" and it's hard to distinguish which place to go to. The good news is, 9 times out of 10 the food is going to be cheap, easy and delicious. Farolito does something special though by way of having the cheapest most delicious veggie burrito with full fixins INCLUDING AVOCADO all for about $5 (depending on if you get a drink, chips etc.). The best news is, I have not conquered this veggie beast in one sitting yet which is a wonderful feeling. I love eating to the point of being full and having a little butt to put in the fridge for when I get the munchies later. Someone informed me that Farolito means lighthouse, hence the obvious icon on their storefronts I never noticed for years. Been to this location and the one on Mission St. and missed it each time. Now I realize I was a wayward sailor searching for nourishment, sustenance and Farolito led me to safe shores filled with black beans, rice, pico de gallo and so much more!

How they manage to make sure i get a taste of sour cream in every bite still astonishes me!\n\nThe second time i went was last night - more sober and just as hungry.  I ordered a crispy taco to accompany my super burrito.  The experience was just as orgasmic as the first.\n\nOpen late, great prices, awesome taste!  No matter where i manage to find myself in SF, it'll be hard not to come by here afterwards.  It's definitely well worth it.", "author": "Tan T."}

Although, I'm sure I'll regret it later.  But what a small price to pay to the Tostada Gods....\n\nI have only one complaint, they were really slow for the amount of people in line.

This means you might stand in line for a few minutes before you place your order, but it'll be well worth it.  To occupy your short wait, they have a plexiglass enclosed grilling station so you can watch the goodness being cooked up in the meantime.  Chips are an extra 50 cents, but they provide a decent salsa bar.  Getting a table can be a bit cutthroat at times, but just hover near the back and you should be able to score one by the time your food arrives.  The Ceviche tostada was fresh and didn't make me queasy as my friend assured me was typical of taqueria seafood.  But truly, the thing to order is the Quesadilla Super Suiza, a steal at just under 6 bucks for such hearty meal.  It's cheese-heaped quesadilla filled with a meat of your choice, avacado and sour cream, grilled to \"can I please please please have a bite\" perfection.  They fold it to look like a double layer burrito, removing any need for utensils.

Farolito's burritos are bigger and cheaper than La Taqueria, but they just fall a tad short of the true grill flavor of La Taqueria. Sort of unfair comparing these two locations, but I have no choice, since they are only one block apart from each other. I just went to el Farolito today (La Taqueria is closed until Jan 15th) and ordered four burritos to go, three carne asada, and one grilled chicken. As I got home, and shared with the family, we noticed all four burritos didn't have pico de gallo or salsa, what a big downer. Also, the complimentary chips were good, but again, no adjacent salsa whatsoever. What the heck is going on here? A massive shortage of salsas? Anyway, aside from missing salsa, both the carne asada and chicken were tasty. Overall personal rating for el Farolito is an eight out of ten, so it offers very good burritos. But for excellent off the hook burritos...La Taqueria is the best in town, bar none. La Taqueria gets ten out of ten. So, if you want the very best grilled steak burrito, and you don't care for rice (no rice offered there), La Taqueria is the way to go. But if you want something that costs less, and a bigger burrito, while still flavorful, then el Farolito might be your choice. anyway, you can't lose with either one of them.", "author": "Hector Z."}

I consulted with burritoeater.com and discussed it with my wife and decide to come here.  We scored a parking spot on 25th beween Valencia and Mission and walked the two blocks to Farolito.  \n\nIt is a grimy looking place and narrow.  It had a long line and several tables.  The line moved fast and the turnover at the tables was quick.  I picked a spot while my wife ordered a couple of super  burritos.  She ordered the grilled chicken while I ordered beef tongue (change of pace).  There are 3 different selection of hot sauce and the help is constantly refilling them.  One of the restaurant workers brings the meal to our table according to the receipt that was given to us.  \n\nThe burritos size was humongous and very tasty.  The chicken had a good flavor and the beef tongue was tender.  It was packed with rice, meat, black beans, avocado, sour cream etc.  It also came with a basket of chips.  Both of us stuffed ourselves until we could barely stagger out of the place.  Next time I may just shared one with my wife as I still felt stuffed many hours after dinner.\n\nWhile sitting there, you can't help notice the clientele.  There are students and locals.  The price is inexpensive - about $11 for both of us, w/o drinks.  By about 6:30 PM the crowd slows down, so they probably get a lot of the after work crowd.

WOW, can we say - getting muy gordito super quickitto?  The meat for both was perrrrrfectly marinated.  I later ordered refried beans that came in a huge soda cup (I guess people don't ask for refried beans to go), but he gave me enough to scare my friends from standing too close to me for the next hour or so.   Just $2! \nThe salsas were also very fresh and the horchata was just aight, but the jalapeno peppers - YUMMMMM!!!

They don't even give you free chips to eat while you wait for your invisible food.\n\nThe dude did not seemed phased in the slightest and just asked me what kind of burrito I would like, as if this was our first dance. Then when I told him I wanted a refund (instead of waiting all over again to see if they could materialize an actual burrito in three dimensions), he refunded me the cost without the tax and ignored me when I told him he was charging me a percentage for my invisible food experience. But since then i have come to understand that this is a variation on the famous old 'making sixty cents off of an invisible burrito' trick. I think I might have even tipped when I paid so that will help with the 'invisible burrito pyramid scheme' royalties.\n\nMy friend tells me I am not missing out on much as the burritos are so greasy they get all orange and soggy by the end. He says you always have to wait for a while for your soggy burrito but usually they are not invisible. You can however get a 'brain burrito', so if that's your thing maybe you can give this place five stars and laugh at all the invisible burrito victims while you chomp down on your brains al pastor.\n\nRegardless, they failed me in my hour of most desperate need, and so they get one star to the dome.

The salsa bar is a nice touch and very cool that you can help yourself to as much as you want, but after tasting the salsas did not really need all that much.

I ate through more than half of the thing prior to hitting the sour cream and the slice of avocado. There is supposed to be tomatoes and onions and cheese in a 'super' as well, but I was not able to locate any of those. The chips you get, are like the generic 'Safeway' brand, priced at 3 tons for a buck 99 and labeled \"korn chips.\"\nWe also had the Ceviche Tostada.

For the record, \"white people\" were definitely the minority at the time.\n\nEl Farolito is the kind of taqueria you go to by choice, only because a) you've been to every other place in the surrounding area and you want something else, b) the McDonald's across the street does not sound appetizing, or c) it's sometime before 4AM.\n\nI rarely have the burritos here, especially with La Cornetta and La Taqueria in such a close vicinity, but there is something about their carne asada tacos at 2:30 AM that makes me always order at least 4 of them. Pretty much everything on the menu is heavy, greasy, and therefore good.\n\nAt around 2AM, though, the hipsters leave their dive bars and descend on this place like they are giving away free white belts and free emo hair cuts. The line exists far outside of the building, and eating inside can be hard to do. Definitely get there before 1:30AM if you want a seat or your food in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nMy girlfriend's response to the chubmo Latina's question was, \"What's with all the FAT people in here?\" We're lucky we didn't get sat on or something.", "author": "Alexis C."}

SO worth it. At first bite, I noticed that the flour tortilla is just the right amount of chewiness. The most tender, flavorful chicken meat I've had in a burrito in a long time. Good quality cheese that melts beautifully. Several slices of fresh avocado (none of that stuff that goes squirt). Creamy pinto beans that add the perfect texture to this package of delight. Salsa to add a hot kick. Fluffy rice to soak up and support all the tasty juices running throughout. Only (minor) complaint is there was a little too much sour cream for my liking, not the most pleasant first couple of mouthfuls. I also took the advice on here and had the strawberry aguas frescas.  What a great sweet, pulpy companion to my burrito and chips.

On my next visit I ordered the super shrimp tacos and received the same generous amounts of shrimp and fix'ins but also the yummy salsa and cilantro goodness.

I've been a connoisseur of burritos and Mexican food for years and this place serves the best I've ever eaten.\n\nI had my first taste of El Farolito after the Carnival parade on Mission. The restaurant was packed with a line out the door. Any place this packed has to be good so I was really excited to give their food a try. Inside, El Farolito is very small with just a few tables in the back. Luckily we were able to swipe one from a group that was leaving after we had ordered our food. The atmosphere was noisy and very lively. The perfect setting for some great Mexican food. I ended up ordering the super burrito with carnitas and black beans. Hands down, it was the best burrito I've ever eaten. To start from the outside, the tortilla was soft and chewy. It wasn't overly starchy and thick, but enough to keep the ingredients from leaking out. The carnitas was tender and flavorful, just how it should taste. I can't tell you how many times I've been served crunchy, dry carnitas. The stuff at El Farolito was just right. The rice had a nice mild flavor with hints of lime. The beans were well cooked, firm but soft on the inside. Lastly, the salsa was what really shone through apart from the excellent carnitas. It had a great tomato and onion flavor with just a hint of spice. It's the kind of salsa that tastes so good, you can eat it with a spoon. The freshness of the ingredients only enhanced the rest of the burrito.\n\nIt's too bad I no longer live in the Bay Area, because this place is a gem. If you're in or around San Francisco, absolutely stop by El Farolito. You just don't run into places like this everyday.", "author": "Chris C."}

The man at the register was trying to push chips and a drink at me, even though I only wanted a burrito.

Meats - aside from the standards, they have lengua (beef tongue), shrimp, fish.  Actual avocado in the orders instead of green splatter that looks like guacamole.

And trust me, I've had plenty of burritos of all kinds-small, big, round, flat, skinny, dry, wet, tall, savory, boring... \n\nFirst off, no one can resist the temptation of walking in here. It's like Cinnabon's Cinnamon Bun scent that you can smell 50 miles away, (which I think they have a secret C-Bun machine that only wafts out the scent to attract people). Turn the corner and you smell the savory meat flavors already. Staring at the menu, I decided to go with the Camaron (shrimp) burrito. I ripped open the foil & shoved my face in it, and couldn't stop eating the savory burrito. Even the regular size is pretty big, as I tried to finish the entire thing (a goal I set each time). Good flavors, and filling for the price you pay (roughly $6 for a burrito). They have vegetarian & meat selections, and don't forget to top it off with a bottle of Mexican coca cola (I don't know their secret, but it always tastes better). Although most places give you chips for free, I believe they charge you (yes, sorry to disappoint you)...well they're still set at a cheap price regardless. \n\nThe service was good, and I have no complaints. The man taking our order was nice, and they got our food to us in a decent amount of time despite the crowd at 11 P.M. Best part is they are open fairly late, so burritos late night always put you to sleep. Not a huge place to eat, squishy here and there...I got mine to go.

These small easy-to-eat pieces of meat are brilliant for grilling---the flavour infused by the grilling goes a long way for making this essential dish fantastico.   This is a taqueria of simplicity so you will not see anything but a very simple menu---and part of that autentico you will see Seso (beef brain) on the menu.  But take this for the simple authentic Mexican approach to a tanqueria and leave well satisfied by such a commitment to great quality.  I go at least 3-4 times a month.\r\n\r\nBuen Provecho!", "author": "Jaime Patricio M."}

Unfortunately, I wasn't sporting much cash, so I only got a carne asada taco, but my friend was kind enough to let me have her chicken taco as well.  The chicken taco was a little on the salty side, but I love my sodium, so I gobbled it up.  The carne asada was definitely less salty and sooooo good.  \n\nIt does get all sorts of crazy there as the club-goers pour in, so make sure you check your bill because I think someone else may have paid for my friends' meal, but I was really too drunk to be sure or care.\n\nI have been craving the tacos ever since.

I also had some of the vegetarian nachos one time, and they were pretty impressive. Definitely go for the carne asada here. I've had the marinated chicken, the grilled chicken, and marinated pork here as well. The marinated chicken is not the best choice for a burrito- too soft and boiled for my taste. The salsa is very good. Their tomatillo (green) salsa has a nice fresh taste to it and the chunky red salsa packs a good little spice to it. The clientele here as it gets later, gets drunker, but I've had this when both drunk and sober and it always tastes amazing. The place isn't the cleanest burrito joint in the world, but it's respectable and they do a good job of making sure there aren't heaps of baskets and salsa all over the tables that you have to clean up yourself. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite burrito joints in SF", "author": "Tyler C."}

This San Francisco institution serves the legendary mission-style burrito, a gut bomb monster practically large enough to feed a family of four, that inspired a world Q'potles to pop up all across the country.  When we arrived, a line was snaking out the front door.  The front window provides us voyeuristic food porn fetishizer types with a glimpse of the rapid grill operations at El Farolito.  The line moves rather rapidly, so don't let the deter you.  I went with an order of three tacos, one al pastor, one cabeza, and one lengua.  The al pastor was pretty middle of the road for me.  It was soft, tender and spicy, but lacked the crunch a good al pastor gets from caramelizing on the spit.  It also didn't come with pineapple, pretty much a sin in my book.  The cabeza was simply not good - it was kind of waxy and ultra bland.  The lengua was marvelous - a lovely symphony of tender, slightly gooey, rich, and oh-so-satisfying beef tongue.  Each bite bursted with flavor.  They stock three salsa, which were merely just okay.  Overall, this place is a-okay, a great place to satisfying your need for a second dinner in the mission.", "author": "Thomas S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-29", "description": "Okay, well first off, let me start by saying that the only people who seem to have ANY issue with this place whatsoever are either yuppies, vegans, vegetarians or any combination of them. That being said, this place is about as good as it gets as far as Mexican food in California (Yes, i grew up in LA, plenty of good places too). \nDrunk food? Sure. Sober food? Absolutely. I just returned from my (at least) weekly visit, and it was just as good as ever. The first thing I ever ordered here was a taco (4 of them, actually) and they were everything tacos from a legit Mexican restaurant should be. \nBut i quickly moved onto their Super Burritos. I almost exclusively order burritos al pastor wherever i go, but the bites of asada burritos i've had here have been quite tasty as well. They pack these monstrous super burritos with beans, cheese, rice, sour cream, big chunks of avocado, and your choice of several meats. The pastor is exquisite and, in my opinion, is the way to go when ordering burritos. The damn things are gigantic, and i've only finished an entire burrito once... and I've got a pretty decent appetite. basically, you won't be left hungry when you order a burrito.\nOne menu item at El Farolito that is sadly overlooked all too often is the torta. I had never strayed from their trusty burrito, until i saw my buddy's torta one day. Next time i visited, i ordered one up, with asada, and, man oh man was it good. jalapenos and cheese melted into the bread, fresh leaves of lettuce, some tomato slices, beans, sour cream, slices of avocado and a thin slab of asada cooked perfectly for a torta. They are exactly what a torta should be. They don't stuff you the way burritos do, but, again, you leave feeling perfectly satisfied. all for a little under 5 bucks.\n\nAgain, if you're a yuppy, vegan or vegetarian, go find somewhere else to eat. If you piss your pants because a Mexican dude with tattoos comes in; go elsewhere. If bums intimidate you; perhaps this isn't your place. If your feelings get hurt because the cashier doesn't want to small-talk with you... well, you don't need to waste your time. There is plenty of decent Mexican food in other touristy neighborhoods. Try Haight St or Castro. \n\nLittle Lighthouse, you've earned my respect and loyalty with a consistent meal that never fails to hit the spot. You've never messed up an order (perhaps because i'm not picky)  and you've pulled your weight in this city for plenty of years. Keep doing what you're doing.\nCheers!", "author": "Q M."}

Yeah, the place is dirty. Yeah you gotta park a few blocks away and wait in line with 25 people before you get to that younger dude, who's now sporting corn rows, to order the same damn thing you had last time, which you order anyway because it was soo good. \n\nThe Al Pastor burrito here worries me. I know it will kill me. It feels like I'm eating a pound of bacon whole. But it's flavorful and the cheese and sour cream and whatever else the slap in it just melts into this creamy porky goodness. I like it a lot, but I'm worried it will kill me.\n\nI don't smoke weed but this would be an awesome burrito to just zone out on. Until you get that one piece of chewey meat that kind of spooks you a bit. That would be a bummer.\n\nSo I can't speak for the rest of the food but I imagine their carne asada would be pretty good.

I was gonna go with the carnitas at first because the menu stated it was fried, but when I saw it...it didn't look crispy....so then while still waiting in line, i was gonna opt for the carne asada that looked so gooood on the grill...but then yo, wait....they had lengua on the menu! I aint french, baby, but gimme dat tongue!  It was excellent!  Juicy and flavorful!  This is as good as it gets!  Check this out, The burrito was piping HOT!  Not warm....but HOT!  So hot that I could barely hold it!  Dios mio! Mmm mmm good!  The cheese was stretchy...the rice and beans were just right...and instead of guac, they throw in about a fourth of an avocado!  I was full after eating about half of this donkey-sized burrito, but because it was THAT good, I proceeded to eat it, cuz I need it!  Man, was I stuffed!

One of my friends was already with me, and since we were at the place a bit earlier than the appointed time, we decided to start with some libations, two different Mexican beers, with a goodly amount of chips. When all were present, one had a carnitas burrito, another had the veggie, and I had the shrimp burrito. All very yummy items that satisfied us all nearly to the point of bursting. Beautiful salsas of the tomatillo, fresca, and chipotle varieties. And the fact that there was a line the entire time we were there was pretty telling of the business this place receives.

First of all what's up with the chips, funky ass tostitos!?!  It would be great if they fried their own or something cause the stale stuff is not cool.  Also the huge no no for me, the crispy taco!  WTF?  Its made with a funky old taco shell!  Like taco bell...  At other taqueria's its typically a regular corn tortilla grilled crisp.  Aside from that I can still give it 4 stars because of the self serve salsa, the pico de gallo and green sauce rock..  I also loved the carnitas tostada I had, that thing was piled high with meat, beans, avocado and lettuce.  Also the carne asada in the funky taco was very tasty.  I guess now I know better and will order tacos and quesadillas here but not the 'crispy' taco.  This place is right outside of the BART exit so very easy to get to from downtown.

Having been here sober (while my friends were drunk), I heartily endorse this place.  The super burrito was great.  They definitely did not skimp out on the Al Pastor.  My friends got the Carne Asada, they definitely piled it on there.  The sliced avocado is also a nice (and welcomed) touch.  Being the gluttons that we are, we also shared a Carne Asada Super Nacho to compliment the burrito.  Comparing the two meats, I would say I made the right choice in getting Al Pastor, though the Carne Asada was still delicious as well.  The portions are huge and the prices really cheap.  Did I mention this place is open til 4 am?  It's a miracle that there's food at 4 AM, let alone really good food.

Excellent burritos because the tortillas are grilled (on a nice meaty, greasy grill you vegetarians!  Ha!

Just ignore the dead animal grease, spay or neuter your pet and adopt your next pet from the pound and savor the flavor and dig on the HOT guacamole sauce with little avocado chunks you can load up on.  You can order whole beans (to alleviate your meat residue eating guilt) or refried beans (in LARD) if you like.  YUM!  Most burritos places STEAM the burritos which make them taste bland and soggy in my opinion.  Anyplace that real Mexicans eat at has got to be good!  Also - they put chunks of real avocado in their burritos (not that wimpy runny green stuff most places use).

Hell yes, I'll take 3.  2 carne asada and 1 al pastor.  My mistake right there was not making it all 3 al pastor.  I bit into the first carne asada taco and was slightly disappointed that it tasted like pretty much every other good taqueria in the mission, which isn't hard to find - it's the friggin mission.  I figured I had just set my hopes up too high for my little friend el farolito, but lo and behold, once I bit into the al pastor taco, I was in absolute taco eating bliss.  Amazing flavor in that meat, I could really taste the pork.   I willed my last taco to turn from carne asada to al pastor.  It ranked right up there with the al pastor taco I had in TJ.

The entire reason why El Farolito exists is to hustle that last three or four dollars that only sheer willpower got you to leave the bar with in the first place. You don't feel so bad though, when you end up here after 2am in line with all the other El Farolito minions watching them grill that carne asada steak. Take heed however, because lots of drunk bros and wiggers are on the El Farolito tip as well, and expect them to accuse you of being a dyke if you don't answer to their mating calls. Typically I end up here drunk as all hell so it's mostly a free comedy show at that point. Good luck finding a place to sit though because this shit gets PACKED. I pretty much admire the awesome work ethic of all the people who get stuck working the graveyard shift here because in my mind, the worst job imaginable would be serving a bunch of wasted jerk-offs like us at such an ungodly hour. So be nice because they're quick and nothing's going to cure that anticipated hangover better than a $4 SUPER burrito from El Farolito.", "author": "Jenn W."}

After debating which of the many mission options would hit the spot, Taqueria El Farolito won out, and we were on our way to burrito heaven.  I think what really takes these burritos to the next level are the onion and cilantro, creating a flavor fiesta in your mouth.  I got the super carne asada - the steak was tender and savory, the sour cream was cool and soothing when my mouth felt like it was on fire, the generous helping of avocado was perfectly ripe, and the tortilla certainly wasn't dried out.  They also have a little salsa bar; I was a bit disappointed they didn't have a tomatillo salsa, which is my most recent food obsession, but the red salsas were quite good.  (Also a minor downer - no complimentary tortilla chips.)  They also have a vat of something that looks like pickled peppers.  I knew my place and didn't even consider trying one of these obviously spicy little treats, but my friend, who was once paid $18 to eat a plate of jalapenos and likes to think of herself as \"good at spicy\" decided she should try one.  Luckily she waited until the burrito came to go in for a big bite.  There was a moment where it looked like it might all be okay, and then her eyes sort of bugged out of her head with a look of panic, her face flushed, her eyes became bloodshot, and she was sucking on her burrito to try to calm the fire that appeared to be burning deep into her soul.  I laughed so hard I cried - and I will definitely be going back.  But I think I'll still pass on the peppers.", "author": "Rachel B."}

Tons of people, a myriad of food, a rare sunny, temperate and beautiful day in San Francisco.  It have couldn't have been any better. After walking the crowded streets of Chinatown and sampling it's street fare, it was time for a filling meal. I had enough Chinese food, so I decided to sample the much raved about Mexican food on Mission Street. I decided to follow fellow Yelpers and go to El Farolito. From the menu I ordered the super suiza (quesidilla) and the regular burrito, both with carne asada. The super suiza was only OK at best and the burrito was just awful. The most prominent flavors in the super suiza was the sour cream and cheese. The carne asada was too flavorless to have an affect in the entire meal. The burrito was had a similar let down. Rice and beans overpowered the whole meal and the meat was also flavorless. I had high expectations of this place from the reviews posted. Maybe I've been too pampered by the Mexican food in San Diego, maybe the food was over-hyped. In the end, I did not enjoy the food.", "author": "Steven N."}

I'm not particularly squeamish (I like grimy places like Tu Lan, for example), but El Farolito almost seems to make indifference to cleanliness a point of pride. It's like it would mess up their shtick if they were to periodically clean up all the crap and grease splattered all over all of their ingredients, sweep the garbage off the floor, and wipe the crusty scum off the glass by the register. I can see going here when you're drunk and indifferent and just happen to be there, but otherwise the virtue of the place eludes me. Yes the food is fine. But La Taqueria is better. El Metate is overwhelmingly better.

It's hard to screw up the taqueria model, but it is as hard to perfect it. This is the place you want to go for a late night Mexican and be on your way in half an hour (ish). If you are a local, chances are you'll see some friends, but even coming from out of town, there's always so many different crowds here that I never feel out of place. I have had every flavor of burrito and quesadilla they offer. What I would say makes this place stand out is the assembly on the griddle and the proper proportions of the ingredients involved. Their asada is my favorite. I've personally never had it dry, but it looks like a few here have... its a taqueria, it happens. It would be nice if they had free chips, but hey, I'm paying $6 for a super burrito, what do I care? Salsa was pretty good, not stellar, but not lacking. BTW, I'm super sick of the \"Since I'm from LA... anything north of Bakersfield is by default sub-par\" reviews.  I've been all over EasLos, nothing there has shifted my allegiance southwards. Since we're both from California, we're both spoiled rotten when it comes to Mexican food.
