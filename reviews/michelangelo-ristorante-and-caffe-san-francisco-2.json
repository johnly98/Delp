We learned that after a fire in the restaurant next door a few months prior, business never quite picked back up.

I used to live in The City, but came back months ago to play tourist. We spent some time around the Pier and North Beach and ended up here for a late lunch. \n\nWalking in, I enjoyed the decor. Carvings and artwork gave this place an old school Italian eatery vibe. A large bowl of what I hopoed to be freshly grated Parmesan cheese sat on an empty table. I also hoped no bugs flew in there as the table it sat on was right by a window. \n\nOur server also gave off an Italian vibe, with an accent and hand gestures to match. He was the only one serving, so mych attention was paid to the larger party that was already there. We placed our orders about 15 min. later. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nBruschetta: Nothing fancy or outstanding about this. Wife can make it much better. But we were hungry by 2:30pm so it was devoured.\n\nCombo pizza: The crust was not like anything I had in Italy. It was thicker, had doughy ends and again, tasted very average. \n\nVeal parmesan: It didn't seem like veal, but more like meat that was fed through the tenderizer a few times, like how places make chicken fried steak. It was topped with a slice of cheese w/ no flavor and served with tube pasta. Average\n\nLasagna: I feel like I'm repeating myself too much, but this was average also. Heavily drenched in tomato sauce.\n\nNone of the dishes gave off any memorable flavors or detectable herbs. The sauces were one dimensional and the flavors did nothing to wow us. As we sat, more people came in and service became increasingly slower. Water glasses were not filled and we even had to wait for the check. This was simply a place to fill our hunger, not somuch to taste great cuisine. Although our meal didn't turn out awful, I highly doubt we'll return. If I play tourists again, it's very likely we'll plan ahead and go elsewhere.", "author": "James L."}

I mentioned him in my first review after he tried to attack me and stole my iPhone with Salvatore and the rest of the restaurants' waitstaff posse. Tony was consistently creating problems between passersby, neighbors, and the restaurant (owned by Salvatore and his family).\n\nSalvatore had generously given Tony many chances with the doorman gig since Tony had been repeatedly harassing pedestrians, but finally, with Tony's departure, Salvatore and I were able to make amends.\n\nUnfortunately, Tony remains a plague on the neighborhood. I'm sympathetic towards his immigrant father who runs a luxury rug store nearby in North Beach on Grant St. because his son rejects his proud Afghani heritage simply to work in Little Italy as a \"fake Italian\" guido mascot attracting tourists to other Italian-owned family businesses. It's a sad situation for Tony Sr. running his rig shop on his own, so let's all hope Tony Jr. learns to accept himself and his ethnic identity, grows up to maturity, and helps his father out sometime before Tony Jr's upcoming 60th birthday!", "author": "Melvin S."}

The man out front stopped my uncle and chatted for a few minutes before we decided we would stay. Ordered a few glasses of wine for Happy Hour and had their meat/cheese antipasta plate. It was awesome! Their Penne Rivera had what seemed to be fifteen clams and plenty of shrimp. Most Italian restaurants never have pappardelle, which is one of my favorite pastas, and they had it mixed with peas,mushroom, and sausage in a sort of bolognese. The tiramisu was amazing as well as this iced/custard sort of dessert that came served inside a hollowed out lemon. Just all around great food and atmosphere. We ended up stopping gay a second time the next day because it was all so good.\n\nNow for the service. I'm not sure why others complained so much about the staff. Sure they aren't the \"smiley/overt friendly,\" type of servers you get at a chain restaurant, but they aren't rude. They are direct and to the point and check on you if it looks like you need something. If not, they are going to leave you to socialize. They offered up advice on the best dishes and made small talk. \n\nDefinitely stop by for some authentic food, but don't expect \"friendly, upbeat\" servers who are only faking it because they are following corporate mandated policy. If you want that type of service, go to Olive Garden.", "author": "Mike L."}

My husband (a professional cook) ordered the Chicken & Sausage and here's his take: \"It was supposed to be a simple and classic dish that really highlights what's best about Italian food. It was executed in the laziest possible fashion. Chicken breast had no sear to it and the sausage, potatoes, and mushrooms were not browned at all. In general, colorless and bland. There was just no love put into it.\" (I personally thought his dish tasted like Chinese food, especially the sauce and the steamed broccoli.)\n\nWe also shared the carpaccio, which, similar to the chicken and sausage, seemed phoned in. Again, it was the little things they didn't do that made it mediocre. Simple stuff like not seasoning the beef.\n \nI ordered Cioppino which was served in a plastic salad bowl. The clams and shrimps tasted fresh, but the rest of the seafood was rubbery (either poorly cooked or were frozen.) They did hook me up with a lot of clams though, so I appreciate that! The sauce was also kinda bland. We were served gummy bears for dessert which was unusual but probably one of the best parts of the whole meal. \n\nThe Italian family next to us ordered pizzas and appeared to enjoy it a lot so I'm guessing it'd be the best suggestion if you're planning to visit this place.\n\nIn terms of customer service, our waiter was very friendly and prompt, but the host was a little cold so I can see how that may come off as rude to the previous reviewers.", "author": "Michelle B."}

It was around 4 pm and happy hour just started so we decided to stop here for a few glasses of wine and appetizers. When we were seated by the waiter, the four of us were the only souls in the restaurant. But the restaurant was beautiful and had a lovely Italian ambience and we were seated right by the window for prime people watching. \n\nWhen we told the waiter that we wanted appetizers and wine, he was visibly irritated and literally rolled his eyes. When he brought our wine and food out, he grunted and slammed our items on the table. We had to call him over every time we needed to order another round because he never came back to check on us. We were all extremely uncomfortable each time he served us. The wine and food was delicious, but not worth the discomfort of having such rude service! The bill was over $100 and although I am usually a generous tipper, I felt compelled to only leave $5. If he hadn't been so rude, he would have gotten the tip that he so clearly anticipated he wouldn't receive. Honestly, having four good looking girls by the window is good for business and we ordered plenty to justify his time and service.

Started to seem like he was just making excuses. He eventually stated he would talk to the manager then came back and said that they would accept the Groupon. \n\nThe food was okay but overpriced without a Groupon and for dessert you get gummy bears? Even Chinese restaurants don't go that cheap on desserts! \n\nTo the manager, if you guys don't accept Groupons anymore then CONTACT GROUPON. Your waiters don't get paid enough to put up with customers complaining about Groupons. \n\nWould not come back.

Avoid at all costs.\n\nWe were hungry and had been walking around the city all day on the 4th of July.  We were lured in to Michelangelo's around dinnertime by a woman standing on the street advertising the fact that they were giving free bruschetta appetizers.  Didn't get a chance to check yelp first, and boy was that a mistake.\n\nThe promised bruschetta appetizer (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/michelangelo-ristorante-and-caffe-san-francisco-2?select=OW1BCGgFa722YcFD8NuNyQ#OW1BCGgFa722YcFD8NuNyQ) was very average and the tomatoes didn't taste fresh at all.  A man who appeared to be the restaurant manager/owner was basically making it in the hallway in front of a big tub of tomatoes.  Besides the average bruschetta, the bread they served also seemed quite stale.\n\nMy main dish - Fettuccine Mari E Monte - mushrooms, peas, scallops, and shrimp sauteed in tomato cream sauce - (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/michelangelo-ristorante-and-caffe-san-francisco-2?select=OW1BCGgFa722YcFD8NuNyQ#SO71UyUhR0shEncAnkdoig) was surprisingly decent.  Would rate it 3 stars as it had a good amount of scallops (albeit cut up) and shrimp that were flavorful.  Pricey for $17, but not horrible.\n\nMy boyfriend's dish was what really brought this place down to 1 star.  He ordered the filet mignon special (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/michelangelo-ristorante-and-caffe-san-francisco-2?select=OW1BCGgFa722YcFD8NuNyQ#eG5hqq-7WvdJs6IoR29K7A).  From the picture, you can see that it basically turned out as a large plate of overcooked beef that was  completely flavorless and basically piled onto the plate.  The restaurant clearly had no idea how to cook filet mignon.  The \"special\" seemed like a bunch of beef that they were just trying to dispose of.  On top of that, we even found a bristle from the grill brush stuck onto the meat.  Talk about poor quality control and potential for food borne illnesses.  The restaurant charged $29 for this \"special\".\n\nThe service was polite but relatively detached.  The waiter did not ask us how our food was at all during the meal.  It didn't seem like they were interested in retaining customers with their food quality.  We skipped the complimentary vanilla wafers and gummy bear candies for dessert (talk about being cheap) and will not be back.", "author": "Yun W."}

Then we decided to order the pizza appetizer and spaghetti/meatballs entree to share. The pizza was pretty tasty, and you can choose whatever toppings you want (salami, ham, cheese, mushroom, just ask them what topping there are) and it comes in thin crust!

He was attentive and helpful with picking out choices, he didn't get snotty about having a Groupon for the meal, and he was just overall charming.\n\nThe building is a little much; giant replica statues of famous sculptures make it interesting and a little comical (people walking by pointed and laughed through the glass), and a TV keeps your attention if your dinner guest is boring (IE, my roommate who I'd been stuck with for our fun vacation thought I was the boring one. -sniff-sniff-)\n\nThe desert was delicious. Tira misu that my roomie threatened me with bodily harm if I cut onto \"her\" side, and comped gummy bears and almond cookies. We were still pretty full, so we didn't try the beautiful bread or the olives, but I'm honestly surprised this place doesn't get more foot traffic.

So off we went to find another restaurant.  Didn't want to ruin the good vibe we had with free street parking at Washington Square.  Went past Michelangelo Caffe and the hostess invited us in.  Plenty of room.  Why not?\n\nThey start you with bread and bruschetta.  Nice touch.  I thought the bruschetta was very tasty.  We had the marinated calamari and butter lettuce salad, caprese salad, and beef carpaccio.  Enjoyed all of it.  Very tasty spaghetti alla carbonara.  Lots of seafood and shellfish in their pasta with tomato sauce.  Basically the same dish as their cioppino, but with pasta.  Enjoyed this dish as well.  \n\nService was ok.  The brought us almond cookies and gummy bears.  I asked about the cream puffs.  Only three per order.  The four of us ordered it anyway, and they brought us four cream puffs.  Bonanza!  (Tony's called us about our reservation while we were waiting for the dessert!)  \n\nKind of an odd decor with colorful glass lights and enormous fiberglass reproductions of famous Italian frescos and statutes on the walls.  \n\nRestaurant got a lot busier later in the evening on Saturday night.  \n\nBeats the absolute hell out of a 105 minute wait for Tony's Pizza in North Beach.

Honestly, the food was so-so... While the spaghetti sauce was good, everything else was just \"okay.\" But to be honest, what bothered me more than the quality of the food was their service.\n\nOver the course of the meal, we felt overlooked by the team of people serving us. I was given a fork to eat with that had dried food on it and when I brought it to the attention of our server, he forgot to bring me a new fork. After waiting about 5 minutes I had to ask the man working the door to get one for me instead. The thing that upset me the most was when we finished our meals and received our bill. Before finishing our food, I noticed that servers handed out gummy bears and a small treat (I'm not really sure what it was) to other customers when dropping off their bills. I saw it happen with the couple sitting behind us, and shortly after with the couple sitting next to us, but when we received our bill it was quickly dropped off with no post-meal treat. After hearing how one customer raved about the treats she received, I was really looking forward to us getting ours. Needless to say, I was disappointed that we were snubbed.\n\nIt also took them forever to present us our bill to begin with, and forever to return the paid receipt...

Having worked in an Italian restaurant myself, I often find myself critiquing a restaurant's Penne Puttanesca or their pepperoni, always remembering from my early days as a server in an Italian restaurant, that if it doesn't curl up when it cooks, it isn't real pepperoni.  \nBeing new to the San Francisco Italian cuisine scene, my boyfriends's mom had bought me a Groupon to Michaelangelo's. With two appetizers, four entrees and two deserts included, I decided to take some friends and family to the joint for my boyfriend's birthday.\nOnce we got there, we were greeted with the warmest of Italian welcomes from Salvatore, who expressed that he had been there for 20 years. Not only that, once we sat down we immediately received bread and bruschetta to start off. The menu consisted with traditional Italian dishes, like Spaghetti and Meatballs and also Veal Piccata. After our delicious Antipasto and Calamari appetizers, I decided to order their Spaghetti and Meatballs with Bolognese sauce. \nFor me, it's always a gamble to order meatballs at any restaurant, because sometimes the ground beef can be too heavy and the spaghetti ends up being more greasy than anything else. However, when I tasted their dish, I was pleasantly surprised to taste that not only was the meatball flavorful, but it was not too greasy at at. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly (not overlooked like how many restaurants today cook pasta) and the Bolognese sauce was light and meaty which was exactly what I wanted.  \nWe finished off our meals with their Tiramisu and Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e, both of which melted in your mouth when you took a bite. \nNeedless to say, I will definitely be going back there, they offered a superb menu and has impeccable service!", "author": "Vanessa J."}

No more trying places that have been around forever that no one I know has been to in the last 3 years...\n\nI recently had a conversation about restaurant dining with a friend. We discussed whether awesome food but bad service would keep you away from an establishment or whether ok to bad food but great service would be more likely to keep you away. Ironically, she is the friend that I went to the Corner with and Michelangelo's with in the same week. We decided, as most food-centric people would, that good food, bad service was definitely the lesser of the two evils. Too bad for Michelangelo's...\n\nWe were supposed to go to one of her favorite NB restaurants but she forgot that they're one of the restaurants that aren't open on Tuesdays. So we decide to try Michelangelo's since she hasn't been there in years. The staff is super friendly and attentive. Really, they get five stars for the service.\n\nThen we tried to the food... Calamari painfully in need of salt, but perfectly cooked and not at all rubbery. Pasta with clams and red sauce, pretty good with a tad too much salt. My friend''s Carbonara not so much. Now I have dined with this friend many times. I have never seen her leave food on her plate without taking it home.... EVER.

The host here was standing outside and tempted us in with his promise that if we didn't love the food, he would pay for our meal. Too bad he didn't make the same offer for the service. We returned two months later for one of our worst dining experiences.\n\nI don't know if it's always this bad, but the service we received was the WORST I've ever experienced. We were seated right away (at a table awkwardly situated against a step-up near the corner), but that was all that went well. A basket of bread and bowl of olives were literally dumped on our table 15 minutes after we sat down, but it took 35 minutes before anyone came to take our order -- even for just drinks. My husband literally had to flag someone down. Three tables seated after us were served first. And the initial server who took our order then repeated it to our actual server.\n\nWe got our salads in about 15 minutes but those came 10 minutes before our drinks. In one of his fly-by passes of our table, the server said, \"Oh yeah, you wanted drinks\" and asked us to remind him what we ordered. Dinner took another half hour to arrive and the server failed to put the right plate in front of the right person. On another fly-by, he unceremoniously dumped a huge bowl of Parmesan cheese on our table and virtually ignored us the rest of the night.\n\nMaybe the service wouldn't have been so troublesome if the food at least had been good. It wasn't. I ordered the Pollo alla Milanese that has received rave reviews here. Apparently, the kitchen was asleep at the wheel tonight, too. There was absolutely no white wine, lemon sauce on my chicken. Some had sunk into the chicken, but not enough to keep it from tasting dried out. The mixed vegetables consisted of two flavorless pieces of broccoli and one half white potato sliced. My husband's lasagne didn't even fill three-quarters of the dish and was drowning in sauce. My daughter's spaghetti and meatballs were cold.\n\nOur server never asked once if we needed anything. I had to ask a second server to refill by daughter's water glass (her only drink) and bring us ketchup for my other daughter's fries. At one point, I tried to stop our server to ask for an additional glass of wine. \"OK, OK, OK,\" he said over his shoulder. We never got the wine. This dinner took 90 minutes start to finish -- with only salads and the entrees, no desserts or even second drinks. After waiting 15 minutes for the check, I finally walked up to our server and asked him to bring it to us so I could get my 4 year old home to bed. \"OK, OK, OK,\" he told me, again. Then he spent the next 5 minutes waiting on everyone else. I finally asked the hostess to please get it for us. Never once did the server even bother with a \"sorry it's so busy\" apology.\n\nI've never left a penny tip. Tonight, I did. This restaurant sends its host or hostess out to recruit diners -- even when it can't handle the customers it already has. I suggest they train their host or hostess to backup as a server. Clearly, that's needed. Because I can guarantee that even if the owner paid for my meal next time, I still wouldn't come back here.", "author": "Ann P."}

I haven't written many.  It usually takes exceptionally poor service or unusually poor food.  Honestly, at times I've found myself willing to overlook one or the other, but certainly not at the same time.  Couple that with feeling gouged and you've earned yourself some personal time.  Honestly, how do you guys stay in business?  It must be the tourists, because frankly, I can't believe anyone would visit more than once.  \n\nLike most of their customers, I imagine, my family and I found ourselves drawn in by the gentleman at the front door who asked if we \"wanted to come in and try some his dad's cooking?\"  Sure, a family owned restaurant?  We'd love to support that.  What followed was quite possibly the worst Italian food we've had in our lives.  Even our kids thought the food was cheap, bland and tasteless.  One after the other we each tried each other's meals, wondering if it was just us that ordered poorly.  Nope, disappointing across the board.  \n\nNow it's quite possible that we just don't know what true Italian food tastes like, or that our standards are unreasonably high, but I don't think so.  I think we're very reasonable and a pretty fair judge of character.  As a matter of fact, we were all so bothered when we left that we followed a recommendation from a friend and walked up to the Nob Hill Caf\u00e9 where we had some very good Italian, and great service too.  From our perspective, we certainly don't mind paying for quality food (or quality service) but get frustrated quickly when we feel like we're being \"taken\" and that's just how we felt while eating here.  \n\nHonestly though, I would spare the review if it were just due to the food.  It looks like this place has earned mediocre reviews from other customers, which is probably in line with what you'll experience if you choose to eat here.  What truly earned the review was the response from the shill at the door as we walked by later, on our way home.  Not realizing that we had just eaten there earlier (and weren't particularly happy about it) he continued,  \"Hey, want to try the best Italian in San Francisco?\" \"I grew up in this neighborhood.\"  \"I'll put my reputation on it.\"\n\n\"No thanks,\" we replied.  \"Honestly... we weren't that happy with it.\"  \"Really,\" he replied.  \"Well, too bad, we don't want you here anyway.\"  \n\nNice... very professional.  \n\nLook, there are so many other choices available I'm just not sure why anyone would choose this one.  Don't take my word for it, just read the other reviews (like I should have done) before you commit.  The truth is probably somewhere in the middle.   \n\nIf this prompts some better service, or effort, then it's served its purpose.  If not, then consider your reputation established.", "author": "Yuri S."}

I'll make it quick: \n\n(1) Tiramisu \n comparable to favorite at Rulli's in Marin - outstanding!  Large portions for sharing, homemade, fresh European butter and cream you can feel from your lips to hips- \n*boom chicka-smack.*  Ladyfingers very spongy, just the right amount of chocolate, espresso and liquor.  \n\n(2) Sambuca \ntender veal you can cut with a fork, covered in some pig, sage, European butter, lemon - goodness.  I left the Italian ham for pops but the veal was good.  Dad orders sambuca whenever he can and claims this is \"one of the better,\" though not the best.  The best apparently is at some 5 star in Tahoe - I will take his word for it.  \n\n(3) Vodka cream sauce\nI like this here! I had it with the lobster ravioli- again.  \n\nNote: homemade fresh pasta is the standard in little Italy - haven't had a pasta I didn't like here yet.  Everything is a bit above average here for a good price - sometimes that's what you want.  I wanted to share a quick meal with my pops, in sweats, in my neighborhood, without cooking.  My Dining Dough certificate was about to expire so we came here - good time and savings.  \n\nTIP: even after tiramisu - skip two block up the street for a chocolate covered nutter butter - sure to impress.

The only thing i liked about the food there was their complimentary appetizer.  which was the marinated diced tomatoes on top of toasted bread. than they gave you this plain bread in a basket. I went there dinner time, around 8pm. and gosh that bread was stale. very hard to bite into. \n\nAs an appetizer we ordered the calamari dish. it was lightly battered deep fried calamari with marinara sauce. The calamari was very tender and chewy, but it didn't have that crispy bite to it. and it sure didn't taste that fresh.\n\nAs a main course, I got the clam shrimp scallop mushroom fettuccine in some garlic tomato sauce. The sauce was way too creamy. It just made me feel like I gained 100 lbs. The scallops tasted like they've been frozen for years! the shrimp was pretty good and i didn't see or taste any clam. o.0 where the hell were my clams?!?! \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the secondi veal dish with potato and broccoli.  oh yuck the broccoli tasted like it was just thawed or like boiled in sink water or something. the veal didn't have much taste to it, it was moist tho. the potatoes were pretty good. and the sauce isn't bad, it just felt cheap for a 19$ meal. \n\nSo overall, this place is overpriced for the crappy food it serves.

He advised the lasagna was the best option as it was homemade. \n\nThe bruschetta came first on what appeared to be stale crostini, and there was just no flavor to it at all. It didn't appear as though the tomatoes were tossed with olive oil at all, there were barely any chiffonades of basil to be had, and I had to use the balsamic vinegar on the table to make it edible. He also brought bread (the crust was hard enough to cut the inside of my cheek), and marinated olives. All of this was free, so I wasn't really disappointed, but the lasagna took care of that.\n\nWhen it arrived, it looked like it might be decent, but any \"lasagna\" that was there was buried in a bland tomato sauce and not at all aided by the powdery grated parmesan that topped it. In fact, Lean Cuisine (hell, even Michelina's) makes better lasagna, and that's saying something. I had to fish around for any meat, and it appeared to be all sauce, no substance. It didn't even feel like there were layers, just a few square noodles swimming in sauce with a dab of ricotta and a piece or two of bland meat. If this was the waiter's recommendation, I'd hate to see how bad the spaghetti or fettucini bolognese would have turned out.\n\nI needed to see if dessert could redeem this meal and at least end it on a good note, and fortunately it did. The tiramisu is excellent, and that's exactly why this place gets a second star. The portion was generous, and I find that the best tiramisus always leave a finish of amaretto at the end of the bite, and this one did. If only the lasagna could hold up as well as the mascarpone and lady fingers in this dish!\n\nAt the end of the meal, the waiter brought out almond cookies and gummy bears, and I was still hungry enough to eat the gummy bears, which were pretty good.\n\n1 star for the server, 1 star for the tiramisu. Even with the free appetizer and drink, I still ended up with a bill of 22 dollars before tip for a delicious tiramisu and a lasagna so bad that Chef Boyardee would have thrown his hands up in disgust. \n\nIn an area that prides itself on good Italian food as much as North Beach does, I've surmised the only reason this place stays open is because of unsuspecting tourists and first-timing locals enticed by freebies. Don't make the same mistake.", "author": "Josh J."}

Our original plan was to go to Cinecitta around the corner but when we showed up, the owner explained she had the restaurant fully booked for a party.  Lucky for us, Michelangelo's was happy to have us.  Solid Italian fare and family-friendly service.\n\nFood:\nI started with the carpaccio, because I am unable to pass it up whenever I see it on a menu.  Served with crust bread and a drizzle of olive oil, it was very good.  My next course was the papardelle with meat ragu, which is my favorite pasta.  Hearty and filling but not heavy, and the ragu was well-balanced (not too acidic).  Pasta was made fresh (and I know so because I saw the cook portioning and rolling the dough as I walked back past he kitchen to use the mens room).  \nThe missus ordered the orrechiette, which is one of her faves, and she was quite happy.  She didn't offer me a tatse, so it must have been good! The kids enjoyed their cheese pizza (shocker).  I think it would be challenging to find a bad dish on the menu. We enjoyed a bottle of the house Sangiovese as well, which was a nice treat. And gummy bears and amaretti cookies are complimentary at the end of the meal.  Really nice touch.\n\nService:\nExtremely accommodating, especially when my kids wanted their own little two-top table rather than sit with us adults.  Our server was a sweetheart and took great care of us. Maybe it's cliche, but I really did feel like part of the family here.\n\nVibe:\nLike visiting your Italian aunt's house - you know, the aunt who is the same age as your parents, but she's so cool that you always introduced your girlfriend to her first.  Well, now imagine that aunt was a rockstar cook.  Being here is comfortable and great, just like that. \n\nFamily-friendly:\nDefinitely was for lunch.  Probably would be for dinner, too, but it would be more fun to enjoy Michelangelo's sans rugrats.  \n\nSummary:\nThe only thing keeping me from giving this place five stars is that I have only been here once and I've eaten a lot of Italian food.  Go to Michelangelo's, choose your favorite pasta, and enjoy how well they prepare it for you.  It will make your belly happy.", "author": "Aneesh B."}

One star for food that was mediocre, at best, and terrible service. \n\nI was here with my boyfriend during the North Beach Festival because the lines for food were insane and this place wasn't crowded and seemed decent. One of the waiters was outside promoting the restaurant and promised a free bruschetta appetizer. We never got it. My boyfriend ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, the portion was a nice size. I ordered the cheese ravioli and when it came out I stared at it for a good 2 minutes before poking at it. I hardly call what I got a portion, the 7 small pieces of ravioli wear spread out on the plate to make it look like there was more and the sauce was sparse. I decided to be nice and just eat since I was starving. I couldn't even enjoy it since the pasta was still hard, I'm a fan of al-dente but this stuff needed to be cooked for at least another 5 minutes. \n\nTwo girls sat next to us and ordered the ravioli. They received bruschetta and a full plate of ravioli, with over flowing sauce. \n\nI didn't want to be negative so I never complained.

After passing several fancy restaurants we noticed Michelangelo's-- mainly because there was a guy standing out front (presumably the owner) telling us to come inside to enjoy some wine on the house and grab a bite to eat. We shrugged our shoulders, and walked right on in. Who can say no to free vino? The server brought us each a glass of wine and some bruschetta, bread, and dipping oil with balsamic. Yum! That's a way to start a meal! I really enjoyed the complimentary appetizers.\n\nI ordered the gnocchi with bolognese sauce (~$14 or so). I also tried some of my friend's appetizer, the carpaccio which was rather delicious. Our food came out pretty quickly which was nice. My gnocchi was pretty good, but I kind of wished I had ordered something a bit lighter. It was very heavy, and not particularly amazing. The sauce was very good though. During the meal the server accidentally spilled red wine all over myself, and my new shirt. It was an accident, of course, and he was incredibly sorry. I seriously didn't care, and the wine came out of my shirt after a good wash, but the server made up for it anyways but bringing us a complimentary tiramasu, a plate of cookies, and some gummy bears.\n\nI enjoyed eating here because the staff was so lovely and accommodating.

This is not a place to go if you want to be a food snob or a critic, it's where you go to feel happy, smile at the friendly staff, and eat delicious food.\n\nWith the bill, they brought out a plate of gummy bears and amaretto cookies, which I think sums up the restaurant perfectly; Michelangelo's is a casual restaurant with a relaxed atmosphere, thin forks, great service and warming, tasty food. Your seafood might come out slightly overcooked, but what the hell the sauce was great, it's not very expensive, the service fantastic, and it was a nice meal overall.", "author": "Jen N."}

It took them literally F-O-R-E-V-E-R to get us food. I was reaching that point when I wanted to leave, when they brought out bread for us. Followed by a longer period where we got a appetizer. One. (1). Single. It took 10-years for one dish? WTF?! No one else had come in the restaurant yet and it felt like they were taking their time. We even asked to get whatever my daughter ordered first before appetizers or anything. Of course, her food came with everyone else's later on, but by then, she was hella pissed and getting to be handful who just wanted to leave. The food came and it wasn't anything to write home about.

Finally, they told us that the deal was only for dinner.  When we pointed out to them that we ate there because of the deal AND showed them right on their printed card that it said \"lunch or dinner\", the waiter went to \"ask\" again.  He then told us they can't make bruschetta, the appetizer, for lunch.  Really????  Bread, tomato and basil?  You can't do that?  We said, \"ok, what's the substitute?\"  Again, he pushed back!  Finally, he came back 15 minutes later with bruschetta after we had our meals.  \n\nUgh.  I had spaghetti and meatballs, and it was truly forgettable, but I ate it all as I was on a vacation budget.  My wife had a ravioli with mushrooms that she didn't like, and she loves mushrooms.  Also, we didn't get the gummi bears.  \n\nFail.", "author": "Eric S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-02-27", "description": "I was with a group of friends when I walked past this joint and we were, apparently, mistaken for tourists. The owner offered a free glass of wine and bruschetta and, essentially, manipulated the group into dining at his not-so-fine establishment against my better judgment.\n\nLet's start with the free wine. It was jug wine. It had to be. Four dollar wine from Target is better than this. Box wine is better than this. I tried my own white and my wife's red. The white was bland and watery while the red was bitter and vinegary. I've had better wine out of a paper bag during a frat party. Despite the fact that it must have cost the house a dollar per gallon, we only got a half glass of free wine. One of my group ordered another glass (again, a half-glass) for SIX DOLLARS. Six dollars a glass for jug wine. No thanks.\n\nThe bread was day-old supermarket bread: chewy and stale. The oil and vinegar were average and contained in tacky ikea-style containers. The appetizer olives were soggy (downright mushy, actually) and bland. I didn't touch the bruschetta, it didn't look appetizing at all and tomatoes were not in season. \n\nI was immediately shocked at the prices. When I pay 13-15 dollars for pasta, I expect to be in a pretty nice place. This was not a nice place. It was tacky, decorated without rhyme or reason. We were obviously not paying for the atmosphere, so I assumed the food had to be amazing to justify the price. You know what they say happens when you assume...\n\nI ordered the spaghetti carbonara (which the waiter, who was likely the owner's son, quaintly described as spaghetti with cream sauce and italian bacon) and my wife ordered the ravioli. I don't know how else to put this: the carbonara was Pasta Roni. You know, the San Francisco treat? This was not a treat. The noodles were obviously out of a box and the sauce was runny and had very little flavor. Instead of fresh pancetta, the carbonara was filled with sliced grocery story bacon. It wasn't even crispy! Don't get me wrong, I ate it. I was hungry. If it WAS pasta roni, I'd have eaten that too. However, I wouldn't have paid THIRTEEN DOLLARS for it.\n\nAccording to my wife, the sauce on her ravioli was good, but the raviolis were not fresh or hand stuffed. She got the distinct impression that they were the same as the ones you get in a large bag in the frozen foods section of Costco. Seriously. She was also pretty sure the sauce on the ravioli was so good because she'd had it before: as the Trader Joe's brand Vodka Sauce. \n\nI'd like to take a moment to mention the salad my friends ordered. It was butter lettuce, sliced tomato, sliced cucumber and balsamic vinegar. It was the kind of salad I got with a school lunch when I was a kid, minus the ranch dressing. Gag-worthy.\n\nAt the end, we were given cookies and gummy bears on a plate. I like gummy bears. Gummy bears are great. At any other restaurant, the gummy bears would have been adorable. At a restaurant that clearly doesn't care about the quality, flavor or preparation of their food, they are clearly a cheap gimmick to amuse tourists. \n\nOn the bright side, the owner and waiters were friendly and pleasant enough. Considering the fact that we were conned into entering the restaurant in the first place, I'm more inclined to believe that the friendliness was equally insincere.\n\nI'm no snob, but in a city where you can find cheap and/or gourmet food on the cheap almost anywhere you go, there is no excuse to have a restaurant this bad. Fast food chains have food better than this. Taco trucks have food WAY better than this. I'd have been happier with a burrito or a slice of pizza and paid 1/5 of the price. I can make bad food at home, I don't need to empty my wallet for it. If I could give this place 0 stars, I would. This is as bad as it gets; the worst italian restaurant I've ever been to, in any city.", "author": "Benny B."}

Then the next day I spent 15 hours throwing up every 10 minutes from food poisoning from the shrimp and clam pasta that we had. Since I was so sick and couldn't be moved we had to stay an extra night in town and pay $200 extra for the room we had on a Friday night and weren't able to finish visiting with our friends from out of state that we had come down to see.

Charming, actually.  My friend and I got lured in by their hard-selling immigrant hostess, who offered a free appetizer and glass of wine (perhaps a promotion during North Beach Festival? Maybe a regular thing?)\n\nWe ordered one but got TWO small glasses of wine (decided to just keep them), the appetizer, split an entree and finished off with complimentary plate of gummy bears (not kidding). \n\nThere was a hair in our calamari, for which the waiter profusely apologized, shaking his head in embarrassment every time he came by the table. It became funny and made up for their lacking English [They had some trouble understanding my order for ONE glass of wine, and later for packaging both items in one box (they tossed one of them), etc] \n\nWithout asking, the server charged us what I expected, considering the situation: 2 free glasses of wine to fulfill their promotion, comp the appetizer because of the hair, and full price on the dinner. So we paid 13bux (justice? above and beyond!) and tipped on what should've been a $37's bill (already inexpensive for the level of quality/service).\n\nSo the food was excellent. I've worked in this industry for 5yrs and can overlook a hair (which got fried and just as decontaminated as the seafood, so who cares?)  BTW, the thorough bussing (more like server's assistants here) and quick food running were top notch.  Impressively on point, unlike most amateurs I encounter while dining out.\n\nThe experience was more than pretty good. Things weren't perfect, but were handled perfect-ly.  I will have to come back sometime for a full dinner and probably update my rating to a deserving 5 stars.", "author": "David D."}

If you are looking for white linen fine dining then go elsewhere. For a clean, tasty and  reasonably priced ($15-$19 per plate) Italian dinner I really enjoyed this place. The restaurant is located right across from the park in the center of North Beach.   I called for reservations and Tony said to just come by and ask for him. I showed up a few minutes late and Tony was there to greet me on the sidewalk by name. He got me a good seat and even though I was on the Groupon he asked the chef to send out some Bruschetta for me while I waited for my fiance. This was in addition to the olives and endless bread. He then kept an eye out for her as she was arriving by bike and greeted her by name as she pulled up. We had an enjoyable bottle of Sangiovese, Ceasar, eggplant parm and a chicken dish with fontina and ham that was very good.  The white chocolate/dark chocolate dessert cup is fantastic and I'd call it a must order dessert.  At the end of the meal we were surprised with gummy bears and cookies on the house. Throughout the meal we chatted with Tony and the staff, learned about the history of the place and North Beach.  It was a very personal dining experience. If you want to be  left alone and dine in solitude I'm sure that's an option but where Michelangelo's shined was good priced, good tasting food with a fun bit of socializing with the crew.  Some have commented on the idea of someone working the sidewalk as pushy.  I like that there is someone who wants to bring you in and while you are eating wants to make sure it lives up to the billing he gave it. I like that the owner is there and the people working feel a sense of ownership and pride in the place.

The guy outside was working the door trying to entice people to come in by offering a free appetizer. That should of been red flag number one. Any great place wouldn't need to push so hard. It reminded me how the people push things when your vacationing in Mexico. But as I said, it was cold and windy. We are seated and soon after he takes our order. The food arrives, but we never receive a table check the entire time we are there, not one! My wife's salmon is cold, the broccoli had no seasoning what so ever, and the rest was just OK at best. If your starving and everything is closed, this place might do the trick. But if your planning a trip to San Francisco, and your looking for a cool/great place to eat, well, this isn't it! I enjoyed my food at offthegridsf food trucks more then this place. Keep walking down Columbus and find another place to eat at!", "author": "Bri A."}

He may offer you a complimentary glass of wine and a snack just for trying his food and the view of the park.  The ristorante is warm, friendly and serves very good food for the tourist corridor of the Italian district.  In fact, Michelangelo could take advantage of the tourists by service poor and overpriced food, but it is just the opposite.  He continues to focus on great service, good food and a warm handshake upon coming in and leaving.\n\nOh yeah, at the end of the meal they bring you gummy bears and those little Italian cookies that come in the red and yellow can -- on the house of course.

The owner Michelangelo seemed like a great business man, very nice, offered us a free glass of wine if we dine here.\n\nWhen I heard this, the alcoholic in me took over and agreed to come in and eat here.  \n\nService: good service, it seems more mom and pop than professional, but definitely made you feel welcome.\n\nPrice: So you think location, you think italian and you see menu and you think the prices are acceptable.  But when your food and your \"glass\" of wine comes out, you think RIP OFF. Glass of wine was free, but I saw that it was $6.50 on the menu.  If you've ever had desert wine or port, you usually get it in a smaller than normal wine glass.  well this is what a \"glass\" is here.\n\non to the FOOD: I got Fettuccine with some scallops, shrimp in an orange cream sauce.  It was $17 and it looked and tasted like it should have been $10. My bf got one of their specials, spaghetti with bacon carbonara, and that looked and tasted really plain, and crappy.  It was basically spaghetti with some salt, and a spoon full of bacon bits and that was it.\n\nSorry Michelangelo, you're a nice guy and all, but your food does not match the price and the presentation was rather disturbing, Looks like someone threw up onto a plate.  \n\nI'm giving this place 2.5 stars but rounding up because of the free wine and the nice owner, but other than that, the prices are ridiculous (for what you're getting) and the food tastes mediocre.", "author": "Zu W."}

I then asked what wines were available and it was met with a large exasperated sigh, eye roll, and somehow I should have magically KNOWN what was available.\n\nI checked, the lunch menu has no mention of wines, other than \"wine.....$6\". There were no written signs or placards saying \"Wine List\", and when brought in, there was no mention by the staff of any wines, specials, etc.\n\nAll I got in edge wise was \"red\" before he sauntered off. \n\nTLDR; When the owner is there?

The 'owner' named 'Michelangelo' stopped my group as we were walking up Columbus looking for an Italian spot for dinner.

So food wise, this place nailed it.\n\nBut...\n\nStainedglass lamps swarm the ceiling-- the insane decor of this spot is absolutely nuts.  Large sculptures peer at you while you eat.

Going to restaurants in the North End of Boston growing up, I've always loved Italian food the most.  The experience of eating great food when you go out with friends or family is always the goal.  You make the experience yourself, positive or negative, and that's totally true at this place where the hospitable service and food quality is spot-on.\n\nThis spot might not be some insane deal or bougy mecca, but it's everything you need when you're wandering North Beach looking for Italian food.", "author": "L J."}

Bread and olives were brought, but everything was so tight that service and access was annoying, I had to actually move the table to squeeze into the jailbox, which was a tiny 2'x3\" tabletop with one small chair and what I call the jailbox, a box seat made of wood and almost immovable. I ordered Chicken Valdostana (or what I thought it was), and whatever it was was served with bits of rosemary and broccoli, in its own lake of watery light white sauce, probably due to the broccoli. The broccoli was so under-cooked I thought I was eating in a chinese restaurant, while the chicken slices while big were quite tasteless. Seeing others who ordered house white/red, I was for once happy I didn't as the glass was very small with a smaller quantity of wine within for $6.50 a glass! The restaurant is so disorganized that a couple sitting next to us next to the window had four waiters waiting on them with 10minutes! The host was dressed casually and sporting a week stubble and chewing gum!! A nice place to see the decoration within but I wouldn't return for the \"service\" nor the \"flavor\". They do not accept AMEX but VISA si. Street parking only. Did I mention dessert? While sis ordered an ice cream they brought out a small plate of gummy bears and coconut-flavor almond cookies!!!

We were searching for an Italian place with bolognese and were surprised at the amount of places that didn't serve it. \n\nWe were standing outside checking out the menu for Michelangelo's, when the owner (surprisingly named Michelangelo) came to us and offered a free appetizer and glass of wine. Who doesn't like free stuff! Plus, they had a bolognese, so we were in. The owner was very nice and pretty much hustled outside the rest of the night, but it's understandable as the restaurant seems to be in the midst of a ton of different places. \n\nThe inside is a decent size, but the wall decor is a little overwhelming. My fianc\u00e9 was seated next to a 3-D relief of Michelangelo's \"The Creation of Adam\" - right by Adam's wee-wee! :P  Thankfully, a table along the wall left and we were reseated, so it worked out. \n\nOur waitress was nice but she seemed extremely stressed out. It didn't look too busy when we entered, so maybe it was a precursor of what was to come that night. We got some bruschetta and olives after we were seated, which I guess was the free appetizer. We didn't end up getting the free glass of wine though. \n\nWe did order a bottle of wine, but were sad that they didn't have our first 2 picks (Cabernet Sauvignon or Merlot). We were pleased with the Pinot we got and the price was good ($25).\n\nIn terms of food, I started with a white bean soup and my fianc\u00e9 got the Cesar salad. Both were very good - the serving of soup was huge and the salad was very good as well. The dressing was very light and fresh, very flavorful without being overwhelming. \n\nI ordered the eggplant parmigiana as my entr\u00e9e and my fianc\u00e9 got his bolognese. We were also both pleased with our meals. The servings look small but are very filling and don't leave you feeling overly stuffed. The bolognese sauce didn't overpower the noodles, and the eggplant was actually a few pieces of thinly sliced eggplant (I think it was like 4 slices) stacked one on top of the other, so it wasn't a huge brick of eggplant like I've had at other Italian places. You also get vegetables and who doesn't love those, especially while on vacation!\n\nThe overall vibe of the place is family orientated and very friendly. It does seem like a tourist trap however, and by the time we left, it was pretty busy. Three really big parties (6+ people) had come in while we were there (one with some really excited kids), but we got out just in time.\n\nWould recommend this place to someone visiting the area as the prices are reasonable and the food is good.", "author": "Beata P."}

And as an Italian, this place was insulting to Italian food.  The only reason I did not give it 1 star was because the owner was pretty cool and I respected his hard sale skills to sell myself as well as my date on the place.  \n\nHe sold us by offering a free glass of wine to each of us.  My date fell for it, but I should have known better because the wine that was offered tasted like warm Welch's grape juice.   We ordered prosciutto and melon appetizer, and I ordered the minestrone soup for myself too.   The presentation was laughable for the prosciutto because they literally just piled some prosciutto on some cantaloupe as if we were at a bachelor pad.  The soup look like it had just spilled completely out of the bowl.  Both tasted very bland.\n\nAs for dinner my date ordered the spinach ravioli and I ordered the lasagna with a side of meatballs.   Now the meatballs came about 5 minutes before our dinner and right when we were finishing our appetizers which I thought was odd.  After we received our entree, I noticed they used the table next to me as a station for grated cheese and water which I thought created a lame vibe.   You use the table to seat guests?   Anyway, my lasagna was something right out of the microwave in a deep dish.  Mind numbingly hot and tasted like a soggy mess.  The spinach raviolis were a much better choice and I was jealous my date had them because I was stuck with this food that was allegedly called lasagna.  It was like placing lipstick on a pig - it's still a pig.  \n\nWhen you are done, they give you a plateful of gummy bears and a plateful of sugar cookies.  I don't see the connection of gummy bears and Italian food but we did eat those.\n\nUpon leaving, the friendly owner, or at least the gentleman claimed to be the owner, thanked us for coming and off we went.  If it was not for him, this would have been unbearable.   The worse part of the whole thing is that it was $50.00 with tip which I thought was expensive considering the quality and the atmosphere.  \n\nSo if you are looking for a descent italian meal, definitely move on and don't get baited by the wine.", "author": "Duchess B."}

When three of my friends and I came here recently, our experience was wonderful. While exploring the stylish neighborhood of North Beach in San Francisco, we were looking for a notable place to have dinner, and the stylish Michelangelo's was the winning selection. Our table was situated right next to a large stone fresco of mythological creatures. The ceiling is heavily adorned with Tiffany colored lights. From fine art prints to pictures of palaces from Architectural Digest, not a space on the walls or tables is left naked, conjuring an eclectic feast for the eyes. And now on to the feast for the stomach: \n\nRed Table Wine - A glass of this (or white wine) was complimentary with our meal. Robust and graceful, I enjoyed it. \nBruschetta - Also complimentary to our meal was a savory bruschetta. Quite tasty. \nProscuttio and Melon - Fragile fragments of cantaloupe and paper-thin slices of proscuttio made for a vibrant addition to the meal. I could eat this all day. \nPasta Carbonara - A creamy golden sauce containing fettuccine noodles and proscuttio. It reminded me why I love Italian cuisine. Not a single morsel was left on my plate. \nGummi Bears - Another meritable compliment came at the end of the meal. A small platter with cookies and gummi bears was served to us. I was not impressed with the small cookies, but the gummi bears won my heart. I thought it was a really clever way to bring the meal to a close, like fortune cookies at Chinese restaurants. And it also took me back to my childhood. My favorites (then and now) are the red and orange gummi bears. \n\nWe met the owner, who was very cordial. Our server was also really nice and attentive.

We were served by Sal, the owner, and he was great.  The door guy was friendly too without being pushy.  Having lived near NYC for years, we knew the Little Italy experience there and there's so much pushy upselling to get you in the door.  This was not the case at Michelangelo's.  We got all the goodies others have written about.  Complimentary bruschetta that my wife went nuts over.  Gummy bears and cookies at the end of the meal.  We were even treated to a complimentary tiramisu that was delicious.  Sal told us about the business, the ups and downs, the story behind the gummy bears, and we just felt like guests and not just another table. I'm sure there are other places with similar food in North Beach but we won't need to go further up the hill if and when we are back in San Fran.

Maybe because I was younger then and didn't really know what Italian food tastes like from a decent restaurant...or maybe it was because i was tempted by the thought that a Groupon would make it worth it. I know enough now to say this is place serves very poor quality food.  It's not worth going here even with a Groupon.  The food was barely edible and everything was way overpriced for the quality.  The best part of our meal were the olives...but of course they didn't cook those.  We had the shrimp cocktail to start.  The shrimp had a strange, almost musty, taste to them which began to worry me. I feared what was to come. I ordered the Veal Parmigiana.  It came with broccoli and potatoes. I had them include some pasta with it. The roasted potatoes were the most edible thing on the plate but were still bland. The broccoli might as well have been only for decoration because you wouldn't want to eat it. It was like cardboard.  And the Veal...I don't even want to go into it. It was gross. \n\nI must say, the dessert was good. We ordered something very similar to a creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  It was tasty. \n\nThe service was very mediocre. The waiter wasn't very pleasant. He would look out the window as he talked to us and seemed to be curt in his responses to questions. \n\nOh, I almost forgot to mention....we were the ONLY people in the restaurant at the time which was a little awkward.  It was late (9:15pm), but this is San Francisco, not Rio Vista....people eat late here.

At first I was hesitant as the place was empty, but then the owner (Salvatore?)  told us they don't actually open til 4:00 and they weren't quite ready.  But he still made us feel welcome and immediately asked if he could start us off with something while they prepared for opening.   We started with a yummy antipasti with olives,  caprese salad, salami, roasted veggies.  My only complaint was that the veggies had too much olive oil, but other than that, really good.   The garlic bread is DELICIOUS!   One of the best I've ever had!    For my main dish I ordered their salmon special.. it was moist and full of flavor with plenty of capers.  My dish normally came with potatoes, but I wanted to try their pasta so the owner gave me an extra complimentary order of pasta.   My boyfriend ordered New York steak which was also really tasty.   The service was excellent, and I loved the decor with lots of beautiful stained glass lamps everywhere.    As a little added perk the owner and his son were quite handsome ;).

The owner could not care less when I told him his mushrooms in the veal dish were sour I was shocked when he told me that it was not his problem and maybe it was the sauce and didn't even offer an alternative. It was inedible and I usually eat everything. To add insult he loses our check when we ask for it and takes his time tending to other tables while my boyfriend and I waited patiently for 20 minutes. I can only imagine that his lack of concern for us was because we were the only non white customers there. I read the reviews on Yelp, sadly after I purchased the deal, hoping that the reviews may have been slightly exaggerated as to how terrible the food and customer service was unfortunately none of them were. Also the waiter/owner added and additonal $5.48 to the check which I have no idea where it came from I'm assuming it was a gratuity for himself as we ordered a glass of wine $8 and beer $4 which totals to $13.02 after tax but our bill came out to $18.50 after the Groupon discount and we still tipped him (well my bf told me we should because he's too nice).

The greeter was charming, the brochette came quickly, the waitress took our order in good time and the entr\u00e9es were prompt and delicious. (Veal was exceptional).  Midway through our meal I enquired about the wine the greeter had offered to draw us in.  Once the wine was delivered, we never saw the smile of our waitress again.  She managed to completely seat, serve, and check out a table that arrived after our entr\u00e9es  were delivered before returning to our table only after we had given up on her and I was getting my coat on to leave.  The owner was attentive to the Italian folks, but completely ignored the rest of the guest.  The bus-boy was more attentive to the guests until he dropped off the cookies and gummy bears (really???) then he disappeared.  We were never offered any other desert options (mind you the Italian folks had complete offerings of what looked like some awesome orange gelato... again, the owner was keeping an eye on them).  Finally a check arrived, we commented to the waitress that we were going to order desert, no apologies.\n  If I wanted to be ignored, I would have gone to the French restaurant across the street from our hotel; at least I would have expected it!  \nBTW, we didn't leave a tip, so here it is: Don't ignore your guests.

The two last times I went the food ranged from just adequate to really, really bad. My salad was awful (both times)  -- oddly spread out lettuce, no taste tomatoes, boring dressing. We brought our niece in for her last dinner before heading back to Chicago. We all used to love Michelangelo's - it was tasty, fresh and authentic. But something has changed. We all were disappointed in our orders (mine was the least disappointing - cheese ravioli). But our poor visiting niece  could barely eat her carbonara.

My roommate and I were on Columbus on St. Patrick's day last year, and we are not the drinking types, so we were trying to avoid the overwhelming fratboyishness that was taking over the whole city. My roommate is big on Tiffany lamps, and what should be hanging all over this kitschy little restaurant but Tiffany lamps. So of course we had to go in. (They also have hilarious wall friezes and whatnot of ridiculous Italian scenes and sculptures. It's all beautifully tacky.)\n\nWhat we didn't expect was that it was delicious. We shared a pasta dish (poor college students don't got much to splurge, y'know?) and it was unbelievable. I cannot for the life of me remember what it was, but it was amazing. It had a pink cream sauce, and I believe there was seafood in it. However, before the meal there was some fresh bruschetta, and a big piece of parmesan to gnaw on. I'm a fan. We only had water, but I hear the wine is lovely.\n\nAfter the exemplary entree, instead of just being presented with the bill, there were amaretto cookies and gummy bears! Truly surprising. At no time did this place fail to impress and entertain. The decor, the waitstaff, the appetizers, and the finishing touches.

We almost gave up, when Michelangelo himself stopped us on the street.\n\"Lovely ladies! May I offer you a free glass of wine?\"\nNormally, such a question from a middle-aged man with chest hair curling out of his collar makes me cringe, but he had the good sense to follow it with the ever-endearing,\n\"You're both over 21, no?\"\nAnd with that, Michelangelo, you won me over. We were ushered to a seat by the window, further encouraged by offers of free appetizers (and a description of the cheapest menu items.)\nLuckily, my friend isn't as terrified of service people as I am, and reminded the waiter about our promised freebies.\nI had the lasagna, which was impressive. Then again, I generally only eat boxed frozen lasagna which requires a solid 12 minutes of microwaving and who has that kind of patience?

The cheese was just like the balls from Safeway and the tomatoes were a bit under ripe and were mealy - definitely not heirloom or anything special. \n2. pasta: pumpkin ravioli with a vegetable sauce... actually pretty good \n3. main course: chicken dish for boyfriend (he eats anything so he was happy), salmon for me. I asked for very light on the sauce (specified no sauce on potatoes or broccoli because I knew that the chef was heavy-handed and I expected the fish to be delicious without it). Fish was undercooked and entire plate was swimming in sauce. Waitress took it back and second fish was a bit tough and still too much sauce.  And the chef/owner glared at me a few times while he prepared it.\n\nDid get the free wine and bruschetta, cookies and gummi bears. \n\nNote to wait staff: if you are going to serve commercial cookies, at least make sure they are plated nicely - upside down cookies look like you don't even care. And yes, the house wine is really cheap. We have had better bruschetta, too. The bread was extra crunchy this time and not enough garlic and basil, mostly watery tomatoes. \n\nNote to young man hawking the place: do not stand out front with your hands locked on your head. Showing your underarms to potential customers is most unappetizing.\n\nI do have to say that every time my boyfriend has gotten the large bowl of seafood soup/pasta, he has been quite pleased.  However, how hard can it be to poach salmon?  I have also noted the price fluctuations over time.  This time the fish was $2 more than the place next door and the pasta was $2-$3 more.\n\nAs you can see by recent reviews here, the food and service are hit-or-miss and tonight was a miss for us.", "author": "MF L."}

Firstly, the food is decidedly mediocre and, secondly, they have some seriously weird ideas about presentation: my husband was served his spaghetti in a big plastic punch bowl! Thirdly, the management is not very friendly: I do a lot of volunteering - specifically in event planning - and recently went to ask, very politely, for a small gift certificate for a fundraiser. Now, I don't expect everyone I ask to give, but the manager rudely chased me out the door and wouldn't even let me leave my letter! I didn't get that treatment anywhere else. \n\nOn the positive side, the food is pretty cheap and I do like the big block of parmesan they bring around every now and then. The gummy bears thing is odd, though, as another reviewer has commented (although I don't have the same concerns about germs!). In summary, I'd say it's your typical North Beach tourist trap - reasonably priced, but uninteresting, badly presented food and not the nicest people in the world running it.

We started by splitting the antipasto and having a couple of glasses of wine.  The waiter brought bruschetta and comped us the rest of the bottle (half a bottle).  We then had the Ciopinno and the Spaghetti Carbonara.  The Ciopinno was interesting...it contained pasta and the broth was slightly weak, but it was loaded with seafood.

I don't write reviews, but I thought I should warn people of the risk that they might be taken before eating here. My boyfriend literally vomited in the bushes not more than a block away after eating there. And I know what you're thinking he was probably drunk but he in fact he doesn't drink at all. It's just that the food was that bad.  I have been suffering from an upset stomach as well. \n\nThe food was not only bad it lack flavor and style. The caprese salad was bland. The prosciuttos if you want to even call it that was also bland.  It might as well have come out a zip lock bag labeled deli meat. I do have to say that the melon that came with it was sweet and fresh. The Chippino was so fishy that I barley touched it. I ate a few clams and asked for the rest to go. The veal Parmesan was as flat as a pancake and it had a hunk of melted cheese that covered that whole thing.  Cheese was probably trying to mask the fact that one it didn't taste good, and two it wasn't real meat. I'm sorry but I use to live in North Beach and 10 years ago I loved this place I am so disappointed! And the price was like $75.00! I felt so ripped off. I wish I had said something right then and there and refuse to pay for my meal. I really hope they get a clue and change their ways. I can't see them managing to stay open much longer; then again there will always be tourist who will think there getting a real authentic Italian meal.

The decor is intimate and the wall statues make you feel like you are in Italy. Our waiter was the restaurant's owner, a real Italian born with genuine accent. He was filling in for an absent waiter and he was tons of fun and gave us superior service. He spent lots of time talking and joking with us. When I switched my order from spaghetti and meat balls to eggplant parmigiana, he brought me a big side of the spaghetti and meat balls anyway, for no charge. They were the best meatballs! My sister's and husband's dinners were also excellent. After olives and bread, a large delicious antipasto, entrees+, dessert and the tasty house chianti, we had to take the finale gummy bears to go.

But there is one area where I allow myself to be snobby, and that is when it comes to Italian food.

Where are all the authentic, delicious places? Please tell me.\n\nAll of that to say, Michelangelo is highly mediocre. Starting with the bread, that was dry, flavorless and left much to be desired, and ending with the crappy service, I would not go back. I got gnocchi, which was decent, a bit starchy in a way that's hard to avoid with gnocchi, and in a red sauce that was definitely edible, but tasted like I could have gotten in boxed at Trader Joes.\n\nOur waiter neglected to refill bread and water until he was asked twice. And all around us people had plates of gummy bears and cookies, which is apparently their cheesy fun thing they do, but we didn't get a plate, even when we asked for one.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-02-12", "description": "I am beyond disappointed in Michelangelo's, having just eaten here today, and having looked forward SO much to my meal here. I first started going to Michelangelo's back in the 1990s. Back then, the lines would often stretch 20+ people out the door - and that was on a week night. I used to get the Tortellini Michelangelo, and my husband would get their trademark Cioppino. After one of my meals, I even told our waiter, \"I want to marry the chef!\" The food was knee-crumpling delicious, and the place packed with people. \n\nSo my husband and I drove down from Lake Tahoe to meet a friend there for lunch on a Saturday (today). I seriously wondered if we'd get a table! Now I know why it was no problem. Only two other tables were occupied during the 2 hours we were there. \n\nFirst of all, it bugged me that the lunch menu is different from their dinner menu. There was no mention of this on their website at all. So the entree I had picked out in advance wasn't even on the menu. \n\nSecond, the food was beyond blah! It was actually a crushing disappointment. I was embarrassed to have recommended the place to my friend. Our entrees were delivered: 1.) Cioppino, thick, tasteless but fishy tomato sauce utterly lacking in any fresh herb or seasoning, rubbery seafood and shellfish, served with yesterday's stale garlic bread that had been nuked in a microwave so it was tough, chewy and stale. 2.) gnocchi with Bolognese sauce. I could just envision the chef having returned from CostCo with a giant sack of potato gnocchi, huge jar of Italian tomato sauce and 20-lbs of ground beef. The dish was served lukewarm with barely a spec of indistinguishable meat in a gloppy, tasteless sauce. 3.) farmed salmon (yes, farmed! And we only found that out because my friend specifically asked) 4.) penne pasta with a pale, gloppy pinkish tomato sauce. Ye gads. On top of which, when I asked our waitress if we could have some grated Parmesan cheese, she brings over a huge salad bowl of pre-grated crap - again, visions of an oil drum filled with grated cheese rolled right off the truck from CostCo.\n\nSadly, even our carafe of red wine was utterly without character as if it was half water, half wine. And for this, lunch came to $75. I can make better food at home - and that's after I've bought the ingredients at CostCo myself! \n\nC'mon guys, what's happened here? The food tastes like the chef (or microwave man) has utterly lost all passion for cooking. I would not only NEVER return to this place again, but I took time tonight to write this review so that others don't make the same mistake. You will save money if you buy a jar of Paul Newman's sauce, slop it onto your own pasta, and serve it with fresh bread and your own bottle of wine! \n\nAnd now I'm going to post the same review at Michelangelo's website (assuming their link \"Post Your Comments\" is not broken).", "author": "Tahoe Q."}

My husbands Caesar salad was  adequate but nothing special.    When the food came out all my food was cooked together. When I asked if my order wasnt possible (the marinarsa sauce literally tasted like tomato sauce)....which was very acidic.... The waiter grabbed my plates and huffed off and completely ignored us until the new food was done 15 mins later. Out he comes with 3 separate plates which he  put on the table and then walked off.  Very rude the rest of the nite.  My husband had tortelini which was good but small portion with no presentation. His teramasu was good too but no presentation. We left a small tip and left. If you eat here, dont have high expectations, dont have a food allergy and make sure you order directly off the menu. Any variations are not appreciated.", "author": "Dana B."}

For a Tuesday night, it was busy and me thinks that a few locals trudged up the street because Yuet Lee on Broadway was closed.  Service was efficient and quick.  The food was so-so, and I had the over-sauced tortellini.  It was a bit over cooked.  It seemed that since this place was packed, there was only one server, and he moved quickly.  Free bruschetta and after the meal, you get a plate full of Gummi Bears and almond cookies.  It is a nice touch.

I had not been here in quite a few years, and since we were in North Beach, we decided to stop in. The atmosphere was still the same, a weird cornucopia of all things kitschy Italian. I especially love the chandeliers! Started with the calamari, it was fricken awesome! Lightly battered, not tough at all, incredibly light for a fried dish, loved the marinara that accompanied it. Went on and had the veal parmigiana (natch..) and my partner had lasagna. The veal was very good, another dish that was fried, but still light enough to almost finish both cutlets that were served. Tomato sauce that it was marinated in was fantastic! One of the better veal dishes that I've had, not as good as Casa Orinda, but I've never seen a restaurant that was able to duplicate that. Partner's lasagna was perfect! The marinara, the ricotta, the meat, OMG! next time I am definitely having that dish, so good... Our server was Italian through, and through, he was always there when we needed him, and engaged us in quite a lively conversation. We really enjoyed him! Finally after all that food, we were served complimentary gummi bears, and cookies. I thought that was a cute gesture. We will definitely be back! Four Stars!", "author": "Anthony K."}

Wife ordered lobster ravioli's came out looking like a plate of pink mess.  So much sauce you couldn't even tell there were raviolis on the plate. Another ordered crab canneloni and same problem here. Just a bunch of pink sauce on the plate.  Very unappetizing to the eyes, really no other color on the plate.

We had the gnocchi (with 2 different sauces), spinach cheese ravioli and a chicken dish as well as 2 appetizers and 2 desserts - tiramisu and custard (both FABULOUS!).

The wait staff were extremely busy since the restaurant was packed the whole time we were there, but they did their best to serve us in a timely way and respond to our requests.

Husband and I hopped the bus to North Beach with the intention of hitting up a place we went a few months back with my parents, but then the \"host\" of Michelangelo's grabbed us on the street and talked us into a free glass of wine and some lunch.  We went for the prosciutto and melon app. and a bowl of gnocchi.  The appetizer came out looking like a heap of nothing more than prosciutto, so I actually asked the waiter if he planned to bring us the melon as well.  Silly me, it was hiding under a pile of meat.  Wierd...maybe, but we got our money's worth for sure.  The gnocchi came out a while later covered in a thick red tomato sauce.  A few were under cooked but most of them were just right, quite tasty and definitely one of the better gnocchi's I've had in North Beach (and I am above all else, picky about my gnocchi).  The sauce was nice and clean, appropriately flavored and piping hot.  So far, so good.  My only complaint was the service.  They had one poor girl helping a restaurant full of customer's which means we never got checked on and actually had to ask for our bill.  Not her fault, but still something to consider, head in if you're feeling like taking it easy and not in any kind of rush.
