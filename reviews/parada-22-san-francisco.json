I ordered the slow-roasted pork ($16.50) and a glass of the house red ($7). The red was very delicious and didn't taste like a glass of $7 wine at all. I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe slow-roasted pork came with mixed greens, rice, plantains, and a dipping bean sauce. Everything was cooked with full flavor and done very well. Making this dish at home would have taken massive effort so I'm glad I got to enjoy it here. The portion was massive so be prepared to take leftovers home. \n\nThis is great bang for the buck -- I highly recommend coming here for a casual dinner with friends looking for a hearty meal. \n\nDocking a star because it was pretty salty, and the plantains were really charred on the outside.

I went here on a Sunday for a late lunch. Lots of communal seating, but we chose a two-top. I absolutely love the decor; the beautiful bright turquoise paint on the outside and inside of the restaurant reminds me of the island, where all the buildings are painted in bright colors :) There were beautiful paintings and posters inside and a large, stunning glass pantry display with Florecitas, PR coffee, Goya goods, etc. It's an authentic, heart-warming environment. \n\nI ordered the pastelon (sort of a plantain meat lasagna) and my girlfriend had the bistec (looked like flank or skirt steak -- cooked about med-med well with sauteed onions). Authentic, good flavor, but everything could have been more flavorful. The red beans were the most flavorful dish. Most of what we had was on the greasy side, although much of PR food from restaurants is that way -- It is soul food after all...

When I'm homesick or sad, I head straight to the Upper Haight where the smell of Puerto Rican fried chicken fills the street. The place is tiny, with exposed brick walls coinciding with bright turquoise paint. Plenty of vintage Puerto Rican ephemera and tchotchke to look at while you're waiting for your food to arrive. And while they do have the greatest hits like Mofongo, Pastelon and arroz con gandules...I find their arroz con gandules bland. Lately, I've been coming here once a month and I order the same thing...the sampler.\n\nThe Sampler $15 | Chicharron de pollo (fried chicken), yucca simmered in mojo, pernil, maduros and tostones. \n\nTheir tostones are by far the best: so thin and crispy with none of the toughness so many other places possess. Add some of their pique and salt. But, I only got two pieces of fried chicken tonight in lieu of the usual four. Sad. But, their chicken is generously seasoned and because they cut it in chunks, the skin is extra crispy in every bite but the inside is juicy. The yuca is tender and acidic and the maduros are like little bites of custardy pudding with crispy edges. The lechon can range from dry to moist, but adding the pique helps lift it up. And of course, they give you a cup of garlicky mayoketchup for dipping. I know Ricans love that shit, but I do not.\n\nI love this place. It's better than Sol Food. I will fight you to prove it.\n\nThey do have a bathroom for customers, it's hidden. Seating is semi-comfortable for gordas. Parking is a crap shoot.", "author": "Illyanna M."}

I am a Boricua in Expat in the US and was surprised how much this felt like a typical fonda back in the island. An even more so, i was so proud to see this was the only restaurant in the block with a wait. That was a good omen, and a boost to my Puertorican pride. \n\nOnce you walk in you will see memorabilia from the beginning of modern Puertorican history, the 1979 panamerican games, and a huge \"chinero\" (china display) full of Puertorican staple foods. Everything from salted cod to florecitas are there. Also, salsa music fills the quaint location with an island flair that only a Puertorican born and raised in the island can understand.\n\nMake sure you open with the sampler. The pernil is jut like my aunts makes it. The tostones have oil and garlic in true Puertorican manner, and come accompanied with salsa rosa ( mayo ketchup we call it in the island). The yucca mash was dead on! This is one of my favorite foods and although it was undercooked for my preference, it was cooked by the book. The chicharron was the least authentic, but the breading flavor was there.\n\nAs entre we ordered the mofongo with pollo a la criolla. In puerto rico we would call that stuffed mofongo. The chicken was well cooked, in a creamy sauce of veggies. It came accompanied by spanish rice and white beens, but you could choose your sides. The cook on the rice was perfect, grainy, but \"sticky\" and with all the peppers and olives we use. That plate got a 4.5 from me. \n\nThe second plate we ordered was chicharron with Spanish rice and kidney beans. The beans were PERFECT. They were thick and smoky, just how I like them.  This plate got a 5, i loved the rice, the beans, and the batter on the chicken. \n\nThe ambience like I mentioned earlier was incredible and the servers, although busy, make the best they can to come say hi and check up on you. \nI highly recommend this place and would come eat here once or twice a week if I lived in the city.", "author": "Emmanuel T."}

So we order the slow roasted pork, with rice, plantains and salad everytime.  This is the REAL breakfast of champions!  We also have a small pitcher of sangria with everytime too.  That little flat bottle of orange stuff at the table is their homemade hot sauce.  It's a refreshing light hot sauce with a nice kick of heat- not your typical heavy hot sauce.  Besides, the scrumptious, satisfying food, the staff is friendly, and accommodating.  What's not to like about this place??\n\nIt's the better restaurant on the block!

The inside is pretty small but I don't think I've ever seen it terribly crowded. Full maybe, but not packed. \n\nI've only gone for breakfast, but would love to come back for dinner. My 2 friends and I all got their version of the breakfast burrito which came with a side of beans (red kidney i think or white vegetarian beans). \n\nThe negative was that they screwed up both my friends orders by putting in bacon instead of chorizo and for mine they didn't put avocado in mine which I requested as one of my add-ons. And that avo extra is not cheap. Yes it showed up on the bill but I just bit my tongue and paid because they did give us a discount for messing up the order. The nice lady came back and admitted she wrote down chorizo but then communicated it to the kitchen staff incorrectly or something like that.\n\nAnyways, shizz happens. They have bottomless mimosas I believe, so that's another great reason to come back. Food was tasty as heck too.", "author": "Kelly G."}

The portions are massive. I got the shrimp in garlic sauce and my friend got pulled pork. Both dishes came with rice, beans, salad, and plantains. The Spanish rice and black beans have ham, so opt for white rice and white beans if you don't eat it! We also tried the tostones (fried plantains) which came with a mayo based dipping sauce.

The steak with onion had so much salt and pepper I couldn't eat it. And the Tostones was the same not to forget the Yuca with onions. They put green Olives and other was watery. Now I am puerto Rican from NYC and all of the Puerto Ricans and Dominican in NYC or Puerto Rico's  restaurants I have never seen anyone put a lot of pepper on Tostones.

We were told they were on a wait, and to add our names to the clipboard which we did. After 5 minutes another group came (of 3) and they placed their names on the clipboard as well. A few minutes later, a group of 4 came.  Apparently, they didn't like that myself and the other croup were Puerto Rican, because they skipped over us and sat the group of 4.  So we waited. \n\n2. When we finally walked back in the hostess had quite an attitude, I'm sure because she was caught being messy. \n\n3. The food is okay people. After seeing some of these reviews I can understand why they think the food is authentic, but it isn't. Neither is the vibe. I even had to ask who in the restaurant was Puerto Rican, because although there were Latin people, they were definitely not from the islands, I'm guessing Mexican. I don't discriminate but coming from a Puerto Rican family we would have to have someone there if we owned a restaurant. \n\n4. The food has little to no flavor. Generally, our food is salty ( I must confess), but never lacks flavor. That could have been any rice Asian, Indian, Mexican.

Chicharrones de pollo plate - served with mixed rice and bean, tostones, a dipping sauce and salad\nThe chicharrones were literally the best I ever had as were the tostones. \nThe rice SUCKS - it's long grain (which is not traditionally cooked in PR) and flavorless. It tasted like there was no sofrito. The salad dressing is DELICIOUS. I can't even believe I'm raving about dressing - it was just very clean tasting and flavorful. The dipping sauce for the tostones were OK - it didn't really add much. \n\n2.) Plato vegetariano- served with white rice and beans, maduros, yuca, and salad. \nThe maduros were excellent as were the white beans. The yuca was pretty good but could have been cooked a little longer. Salad was great with the dressing.\nThe white rice was WAY BETTER than the mixed rice but the above still stands.\n\nThe pros:\nGreat spot, very nicely decorated, good music, nice service.\n\nThe cons:\nLimited menu (where are the pastelillos, alcapurrias, guisados etc?), REALLY bad rice. Most of the products contain pork.\n\nOverall - I'm eager to try the rest of the menu (aside from the rice). I'll definitely be back for the tostones, chicharrones, maduros, and that delicious salad!", "author": "Angel R."}

I ordered through the delivery site Caviar and the process was super easy. I'm a huge fan of Latin/Puerto Rican food, and happen to be having a craving, so I decided to order the Bistec Encebollado with some Maduros on the side. Back home, I'm used to eating super authentic Puerto Rican food, and the food from this restaurant just didn't cut it. \n\nWhen I received my order it did not come with utensils or napkins, which was pretty annoying and the food was pretty cold by the time it got to me, despite the fact that it didn't really take that long to get delivered. The steak was season well and cooked through, but the meat was so tough it was pretty impossible to chew through and it took a while to consume each bite. The yellow rice that came with it was overly seasoned and also very crunchy. The maduros were mushy and overcooked, they typically should have a crispy outside and a more tender inside. I also had a side of beans that came with it. When I went to take a bite of the beans I got a huge chuck of fat in my mouth. Needless to say, I was definitely turned off. \n\nDefinitely would not order from here again.", "author": "Victoria T."}

The line never got too long during our stay either.  I'm sure this place gets slammed on normal nights.  However if you want a special treat without the crazy come early week!  \n\nWe sat at the side bar height area with 4 of us and had that front window corner all to ourselves.  The waitress was delightful and helpful with all of the menu options.  And if you follow me in any way you know I'm a sucker for a menu that gets to the point.  I've said it before \"Do a few things well.\"  They strike an amazing balance between options and simplicity.  Not a 4 options menu but not 400.\n\nApps are a great way to start here.  Get your taste buds rolling with some sippers and dippers.\nThe food comes out pretty quick and hot off the grill.\nWe had a good sampling of a couple of things so let me walk you through some of them:\n-Plantain Chips and Yuka to start.  Simple and great dips and sauces to smother in.  Came out quick so we could order without any hangry folks in our party.  Smart work Parada.\n-I got the Cubano which was classic and a nice balance of flavors with salty goodness. I needed the dipping sauce that came with the yuka but it made it the perfect combo for me.  Not too big of a meal with a perfect side salad to cleanse the pallet.\n-Pernil Asado, the pork was a big win.  Perfectly cooked meat with a small side.  Simple but elegent dish.\n-Pastelon was like an amazing lasagna layer creation of goodies.  Heavy and a big serving but full of thoughtful flavor combinations.\n-Arroz con Mariscos, the winner of the night.  A giant seafood platter rice dish of magic.  Could easily feed two but really took the cake with flavor, color, presentation and authenticity.  All around a big win.  \n\nThis place was warm, welcoming, humid and thick with great smells and vibrancy for a cultural food you want to experience!  Make it a date or small group night.  But either way, enjoy this local small business as they have a lot to offer in a small space.\n\nI believe they have rotating desserts but we took advantage of being in the charming area we were and walked over to The Ice Cream Bar which is open late.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-21", "description": "I've had my share of authentic Puerto Rican food at several different restaurants around the country. The only dilemma is that they're tougher to come across than you might think. Especially in California where this state is literally flooded with Mexican restaurants. Well rest assured, if you happen to be in San Francisco, particularly in the Haight, I would definitely check out \"Parada 22\".\n\nLocated directly in the heart of the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood (between Shrader and Stanyan St's.), \"Parada 22\" is a tiny little building with a mint green exterior. In fact, you wouldn't even notice it if you're walking by quickly. And the inside is as small as you might expect with only 10 tables for dining. I had come here with my lady and our two friends on a Sunday evening around 7:00pm. Fortunately, there was an open table available as we were seated quickly. But I must warn you, because of the size of this restaurant, you may expect a very lengthy wait before you are seated.\n\nSince we are on the subject of the interior, you will find many Puerto Rican artifacts, pictures, and memorabilia that focus on their culture and heritage. I particularly liked how the owner focused on her roots by making you feel as if you're dining at an authentic restaurant in Puerto Rico. And because of the diminutive size, you feel much more cozy. Do keep in mind that you might be dining very close to strangers so don't let that deter you from eating here.\n\nOnce seated, the waitress took our orders in a very timely manner. In fact, the waitress not only waited on her customers but also was the hostess AND server. I was impressed as she helped every customer in the entire restaurant. As I glanced at the menu, I decided on ordering the \"Classic Cubano\" sandwich (for $11.50). This consisted of roasted pork, smoked ham, pickles, Dijon mustard, and Swiss cheese on a soft roll. It also included a side of mixed baby greens. As a side, I opted for their \"Habichuelas Blancas\" (for $5.00). This was braised kidney beans slow cooked in a chunky smoked ham sofrito with green olives. And to wash it down was a simple Coca-Cola in a bottle.\n\nOur meals come in in just 10 short minutes which was amazing considering how busy it was. My \"Classic Cubano\" sandwich was made perfectly; the bread had great consistency and texture while the pork/ham blend added a unique flavor that is not found in your traditional sandwich. The beans also tasted creamy while the ham added a nice seasoned taste to my appetizer. My friend ordered their \"Camarones A La Criolla\" which was sauteed shrimp; this tasted exceptional as well as her side of cooked plantains. I could tell that they keep the cooking as homemade as they possibly could.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend dining at \"Parada 22\". Aside for it being a wee bit on the small side and portions are a tad bit high for the amount of food you get, this is a great little spot that would wow locals and tourists alike. I would like to come back here on a future visit to try a different dish on their extensive menu. And they do have very generous hours as they're open Monday-Friday from 11:30am-10pm and Saturday-Sunday from 10am-10pm; respectively. Great Puerto Rican food with a excellent service and a fun dining experience!", "author": "Donovan H."}

The Mofongo came with a generous amount of rice, a small sofrito side (tasted like small pieces of hot dog in a light salsa/sauce), and best of all, some sweet plantains. I couldn't finish the meal but still went in to try the coconut flan dessert. The flan was on the lighter side, and not extremely sweet (not necessarily a bad thing). Overall the food was enjoyable and I liked the Puerto Rican style decor and the communal seating. One thing about the seating: the table was quite wide, so with just me and one other person it felt a little distant from each other.

We ordered and shared a half pitcher of sangria, the Sampler, and the Biftec Encebollado.\n\nWithin a few minutes of ordering, they brought us the sangria(which you DEFINITELY have to get!) and before we finished our first glass, our food was on the table. I immediately grabbed for the tostones and boy were they AMAZING. They were perfectly fried and when paired with the sauce they were heavenly. We're both still dying to know what they put in their mayo-ketchup (salsa rosa) dipping sauce to make it so tasty--we basically dipped everything in that sauce. The rest of the Puerto Rican fare did not disappoint! The steak portion was generous, so it was perfect to split with another person. The meat was tender and beautifully seasoned. My friend's highlight of the meal was the maduros, since she is a sucker for all things plantain.

It's a small place and they were busy but we were seated in 5 minutes.\n We each ordered a cold beer which came out in less than a minute along with a carafe of cool lemon water.\n We were given time to look over the menu and decided on Arroz gandules, Pernil pork, Mofongo, Chicarron chicken, Tostones and Platanos!  \n Our food was out piping hot in about 910 mins and we did not have to ask for a thing seen as our server, Danai, saw to our every wish and need !

If the wife and I ever had the chance to get away this place would be at the top of the list for food. This place is pretty small and I wouldn't recommend it if you had small children or babies as almost all the tables are two tops and one large shared or family table. We showed up at 11:30ish foe lunch and got the only other open table. Service was good or server was friendly, she seemed genuinely in a good mood and was able to answer our questions about the menu. I ordered the marinated roasted pork (sorry i do not remember the name of the dish). The pork was very good and really juicy, and what i will order on my next visit. The rice was flavorful and must have been cooked in a broth or stock and didn't dilute the overall meal like plain white rice can sometimes do. The white beans, not my thing. They were cooked with peppers or a green chili or some kind and not a flavor i personally enjoy. The salad had a nice and light but tasty dressing and the fried plantains were subtle sweetness that were a great finish to the meal", "author": "Chris m."}

I remember that my beans were really good,  and that my pork was good,  but lacking something.  This time around I have gained a new appreciation.  The beans were still really good and there's 's two versions,  a white bean/cilantro vegetarian stew and a kidney bean/ham chili. The mofongo was excellent both in texture and seasoning. Portion sizes are filling  and fairly priced.  My only knocks are the size of the restaurant, it's extremely tight,  and the take out packaging.  They ought to separate the salad from the main dish.

Not sure about the meat locker hanging plastic strips but I wasn't going to judge. Most people in our party  of 9 got the pork. Needs more salt and almost everyone went looking for a sauce to put on it. \n\nI ordered the bistec encebolado, the steak. Needs to be thinner cut, pounded more, marinated more, or something to make it softer. When the main dish is the last thing on the plate, you know it needs work.  Rice and beans are great. Maduros (sweet plantains) are tasty. Spicy orange sauce is tasty, perfect to spice up the rice or meat. \n\nLast issue... was looking forward to a Cuban coffee or equivalent afterwards.

Here's my pro-tip contribution to you: get the Maduro and Pastelon with a side of Rice with pigeon pea. That's all you really need. But really, you can't go wrong with anything from here. Come early, be ready to get cozy up into this tiny little joint and gorge on them sweet plantains. Pastelon to me is a puerto rican version of gluten free lasagna made of thinly sliced sweet plantain, layered with ground meat and snow pea. Like all other dinner plates on the menu, this also comes with their regular rice, bean, and salad, but to elevate your experience, definitely get the rice with pigeon pea on the side-so good.", "author": "Taffany H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-29", "description": "On Haight St, there are two popular restaurants to get Cuban/Latin American food: Parada 22 and Cha Cha Cha. The cool thing is they're next to each other. And I believe that they're also sibling restaurants too. And best part is that each one has its own unique flavor and atmosphere. Cha Cha Cha has like a Rain Forest setting, whereas Parada 22 looks more industrial and intimate. \n\nGiven the long line at Cha Cha Cha, we decided to check out Parada 22. Parking was plentiful because the restaurants were located in a residential area, and so we didn't have to fight for a spot. Coming on a Saturday evening, we expected a long line but were seated in about 20 minutes.\n\nFirst thing you'll notice is that the price is perfect. This restaurant is affordable even though Parada 22 has a bunch of pretty well known and popular dishes that can be pricey (Bistec especially). We got two orders of the steak (Bistec) with a side of plantains (Tostones). \n\nFood came out pretty quickly. We ran into a problem with the Bistec and it seemed like the waitress who was serving us thought we got ONE order of the steak, and so we started with one steak plate and plantains. First off the Tostones was AMAZING. Even though fried plantains are so simple, the mayo sauce they gave us was a perfect compliment to make our appetizer APPETIZING. \n\nBut we came for the steak and that's what we were betting our money on. For about $15, our steak plate was pretty big for what we were paying. The meat was cooked medium, and although we wished it was cooked a bit rarer, it was tender and paired well with a side of beans and with some onions. What the dish was lacking was some mushrooms and more caramelized onions. \n\nThe second steak plate took a lot longer to come out, and as a result we kind of lost our appetite for it. And thus, that piece of steak tasted not quite as great as the first one. But it was probably because of our lack of appetite from waiting.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience at Parada 22 with my friend. The wait wasn't that long, the food was decent, and the price was perfect.\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

Not sure how long it's been there, but if there is anything I love, it's a Cubano sandwich. Today, we went back- today I finally ordered the Cubano... simply amazing. Sure, is it a classic Cubano? No. But it is definitely delicious. They add that garlic aioli stuff they usually send along with tostones on the sandwich, the pernil is super tender and tasty, and the perfect cheese... so happy.

Huge portions here enough for leftovers. \n\nBut the flan....the flan!! It was creamy, silky and dense in texture, buttery and egg-y in the best way with a beautiful browned layer on the bottom, soaked in the caramel glaze that was sheer perfection.  That bottom browned layer made it like having a dessert within a dessert: Every spoonful was a dream, then you got to eat that brown layer at the end, with a smoky flavor and chewy texture. I finished all of it, and also the caramel sauce on the plate, that is how good it was! No leftover flan! \n\nThe interior is really cute, a tiny place with lots of character, exactly my kind of scene. They have a bar with stools on the side for those dining solo or on the go, and warm wood tables for those who have time to linger. \n\nDefinitely will be back, next time with friends!

Besides I was a near-toddler in the Summer of Love so what did I know of LSD and free love? Sorry to burst your bubble but nothing is free. Before I have a psychedelic hot flash, I should tell you about this casual Puerto Rican spot. It's on the same block as the longer-standing Cha Cha Cha but probably gets a lot of the spillover crowd since they cover geographically the same type of food. Parada 22, however, has a homier vibe focused on dishes you'd probably get at Sunday supper in San Juan. Stews and sauteed meats are the specialties here. The menu features nine entrees, five sandwiches (including a Cubano, of course), five salads and several side dishes (photo: http://bit.ly/1BPAaom).\n\nThat appealed to me since I am always up for comfort food no matter what the culture. I thought I'd have trouble finding a seat as a solitary diner, but as luck would have it, a small table opened up just as I entered the compact Caribbean-style premises. My eyes locked on the $12 Pernil Asado, a big hunk of fall-off-the-bone roasted pork marinated with garlic, oregano and their housemade sofrito (photo: http://bit.ly/1drI37O). It was honestly like having a half a pot roast to myself, and the bottle of seasoned dressing on the table brought a nice spike of flavor (photo: http://bit.ly/1RKlSYb). It came with a cup of their Habichuelas Coloradas, a hearty broth of red beans, a chunky smoked ham sofrito, green olives and a bevy of spices.\n\nAlso on the plate was a scoop of Arroz Amarillo, a Spanish-style rice with green olives, sweet peppers and smoked ham. I liked how they used the same ingredients in different ways on the same plate. There were some mixed greens and their Maduros, the buttery-tasting sweet plantains pan sauteed (photo: http://bit.ly/1RKlN6L). It was all quite tasty in a comfortable way that made you feel you were at some roadside cafe run by your no-nonsense aunt if you happen to be related to Ricky Martin and livin' la vida loca. In fact, I was feeling so much at home that I ordered the $5.50 Coconut Flan for a sweet treat (photo: http://bit.ly/1GUJFBS). It was a significant helping with toasted coconut shredded on top like a crown. Definitely a find for comfort food with a Caribbean accent.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...comfortable Puerto Rican comfort food prepared like you were at someone's home\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a bit of a tight fit here but find a space if you can\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...quietly authoritative\nTOTAL - 4 stars...maybe I should come to the Upper Haight more often", "author": "Ed U."}

I live in LA and there is one okay Puerto Rican restaurant. \n\nService was attentive and polite. The food is very authentic and cooked fresh. I ordered the Chicharon de pollo which is Puerto Rican fried chicken. Very crispy and tender flavorful chicken. I highly recommend this dish. It was served with fresh hot tostones which are flattened twice fried plantains. The yellow rice (Moro) was also very tasty. My only mini complaint was the amount of beans I got. I'm use to a ton of beans at other Puerto Rican establishments but it was a decent amount. I also ordered a Malta which is a soft non alcoholic malt beverage that not every can appreciate. It was a brand I was unfamiliar with but tasted just like Malta Goya. \n\nParking wasn't too bad, it was a busy Sunday afternoon and I was able to find street parking. I highly recommend this restaurant, it's small inside but definitely a delight. !!!!", "author": "Jordan M."}

The get down - hip roll - kind of boogie, where you close your eyes and just lose yourself in explosions of flavor.\n\nParada 22 is fantastic. It's intimate size makes it a little difficult for groups and they don't take reservations - but being that they're still fairly under the radar  - if you arrive early in the evening or are patient - manifesting a table shouldn't be a problem.\n\nEverything about Parada 22 is low key and accessible. They only carry one white and one red wine, they serve their wine in normal water glasses, and the descriptions of their food are straightforward.  I appreciate places like this. There's no pretension and all of the energy from the staff is directed into the food - which is both made and served with genuine love.\n\nThe majority of tables here are made for two people - so being a group of 4 we sat at a communal table. Our server was the sole waiter for the warmly lit room and he was exceptionally kind and helpful. He answered any questions that we had and he was quick to bring out all of our dishes. \n\nWe ordered the sampler plate to start the evening, as well as a pitcher of their sangria. The sampler plate is phenomenal and the perfect portion size for a group. It came with Pernil asado (roasted marinated pork leg with garlic, oregano & base sofrito ), chicharron de pollo (fried marinated boneless chicken with salsa rosa), maduros (fried ripened sweet plantains), yuca al mojo (cassava root with onions, garlic & olive oil mojo) and tostones (pressed fried green plantains with salsa rosa). We devoured the whole plate in a matter of minutes. The sweet plantains melted on the tongue, the fried chicken was some of the best I've had in San Francisco, and the pork was absolutely sensational and was the stand-out of the evening. \n\nFor my main meal I had the Pastelon  - which is sweet plantains layered with spiced ground beef. It reminded me of the homemade Sheperd's Pie that my Welsh grandmother used to make - with a Caribbean twist. The sweet plantains complemented the spiced beef well and the seasoned yellow rice was buttery and dreamy with it's beautiful intermingling of sweet peppers, green olives, spices & smoked ham.\n\nIn addition to the Pastelon, our table tried the - Camarones a la Criolla -  sauteed shrimp in a fresh tomato, onions & sweet peppers cream sauce and the eggplant sandwich, which came with jack cheese and a creamy cilantro-garlic dressing. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals.\n\nFor fantastic authentic home-style Puerto Rican food - you don't need to drive over the bridge - Parada 22 is a sure thing boogie.\n\nTrust.", "author": "Jessica T."}

Dry chicken that I didn't finish or like very much.  And let's face it: it is hard to disappoint me on some chicken.  \n\nSangria was also very good and we would probably come back...not with an \"oh!

Came here on a Saturday night and ended up with a forty minute wait. Its very staggered though and I saw many couples and groups of four walk in without having to wait at all so you might get lucky! They don't take reservations so its first come first serve.\n\nIts loud, its hot, and the food is so hearty and filling you're going to wish you had more room to finish everything. I read a random review mentioning how heavy the food is here and when I got my dish, I didn't believe it but half way through I had the very horrifying thought that they actually gave too many shrimpies but I powered through. I had the Camarones entree with the cream sauce, red beans, and spanish rice. You have to get the Spanish rice! It has green olives! Even the side salad had the best dressing. \n\nService is super nice. The two male waiters act like they've known you forever. Only complaint is we never got water refills and had to remind them twice before getting some. We noticed all the other tables had pitchers of water though so maybe they're not used to refilling water. Make sure you try the housemade salsa as well! They're in jars on random tables so you have to ask for it incase you end up in a table without one.", "author": "Tiffany V."}

To start with the good: The food we got was delicious. The red rice was amazing!! Meat was good quality, and portions were big. My only complaint was with the service. First, I asked if they could make a quesadilla even though it's not on the menu but they have tortillas and cheese. He said he couldn't ask the kitchen to make that. Mmmkkkaaayyy. So I ordered bread with melted cheese (for my kid) and they forgot it. They brought all the food, and 10 min went by and NADA, no grilled cheese. Husband asked them what happened and server said \"Sorry, we were just busy with online orders.\" and that they would get on it. Long story short, they never made it and my kid was left hungry. I think there is room for improvement in the customer service department. Also, the establishment is kind of small, not good for large groups or very handicap accessible.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-28", "description": "Adjacent to the more popular, though less cozy tapas bar Cha Cha Cha, Parada 22 serves Puerto Rican home-style food in a tinier, yet more intimate setting. Undoubtedly, there are similarities between the two neighboring restaurants in terms of cuisine, and that's because they have the same owner/founder.\n\nTo get the most bang for your buck at Parada 22, I recommend the main dishes, each of which consists of a protein, served with rice (choice of Spanish or white), beans (choice of red or white), salad, and maduros. These dishes are offered during both lunch and dinner, with same sized portion for both, but lunch prices are around $2 to $3 less than dinner.\n\nThe pernil asado (roasted pork) is slightly smoky and very moist, and the fork-tender texture is phenomenal. The pollo a la criolla (chicken and smoked ham sofrito) is very moist and juicy as well; the white meat chicken is grilled nicely and marinated well; the ham sofrito adds a lot of savoriness and saltiness. The chicharrones de pollo (deep-fried marinated boneless chicken) has a very crispy, but not too oily batter. The chicken, both dark and white meat, is very moist. Instead of being served with the usual sweet plantains, this dish has tostones (green plantains) instead. The delicious pairing of the salty fried tostones with the creamy, sweet and tangy salsa rosa is perfect.\n\nThe restaurant staff is friendly, and service is quick. The home-style comfort food and ambiance is a very different change from Cha Cha Cha. So, bring a large group for tapas next door, but bring a date to Parada 22.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

The most upsetting aspect is that it claims to be something that it is not. Any Puerto Rican or Cuban restaurant should at least offer pastelitos/empanadas as an appetizer. Anyhow, I let that go and decided to give it a chance.\n\nTo begin with, the sangria was served in a tiny cup and is not worth the price at all. Secondly, it was warm and the cup had no ice. However, my boyfriend's lemonade was good.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the pollo encebollado with white rice and he seemed to enjoy it. But still, how could a so called Puerto Rican restaurant only offer two tostones on the side?\n\nThe dishes I ordered were an insult to Puerto Rican food! My mofongo with cerdo resembled hash instead of an actual mofongo. The reviewer that called it mangu was being quite generous. This \"mofongo\" did not have the crunchy tower shape that I appreciate. Also, I was hoping to have crispy pieces of pernil in that so called mofongo, but of course- they were non existent. Additionally, I ordered a side of arroz con gandules. The texture was awful. It was extremely mushy! \n\nI understand that none of this is the waitresses' fault, but she noticed that I hardly ate my food. She could have at least offered to not charge me for the arroz con gandules.\n\nTo conclude, I felt compelled to write this review because I felt that this food insults Puerto Rican culture. I come from and live in a community that has excellent Puerto Rican, Dominican, and Caribbean food. I suggest that the owner should advertise this place as Latin fusion... Perhaps that is a stretch as well.", "author": "Maria V."}

They don't offer parking, for what you have to pay a meter parking of $2 per hour, Which its not bad taking into consideration you are in SF! \n\nThe place looks very nice and authentic, it has posters related to the Puerto Rican culture which made me feel at home! \n\nThey need to hire better waitresses and staff, they were NOT nice nor welcoming and she didn't seemed to know the menu at all. \n\nI ordered the mofongo relleno de camarones and it was delicious! Although... Not as authentic as they claim, but still very tasty and I loved it. It was weird the mofongo came with rice and beans, that is not how we eat mofongo with shrimp in PR. \n\nThe portions were very generous, so its worth the price! If I find myself in SF again I think I would cone again.", "author": "Alba C."}

I moved to San Francisco in January, after living in Puerto Rico for 25 years (my whole life) and it is such a nice feeling to have a place I know I can go into and have food just like my grandma makes it. It never fails to be great and just the Puertorrican fix I need to get me going.\n\nWhy four stars? The music. Every time I go they have a horrible music selection and sometimes it's too loud. The best salsa music comes from Puerto Rico! I wish they would play more salsa music and forget about their current music selection which is just plain awful.", "author": "Yamel F."}

The price is decent, the ambiance is fun, and the portions leave you very happy.\n\nJenga'd at the very edge of Haight-Ashbury and sandwiched between art-scribbled streets, this restaurant is a little warp into Puerto Rico. The walls are plastered with Spanish headlines and there's faint music in the background to wiggle your tush in your already wiggling table.\n\nI ordered the juicy pulled pork plate that came with fried plantains, meaty beans, and a modest little salad of course. Each table has a bottle of house-made jalape\u00f1o (?) infused sauce we both doused our food with. This is my first taste of PR, and I will say I feel we got an authentic experience.

The food is really good and being a Boricua from Brooklyn finding a spot with my peoples food out here made me happy. Last night they didn't have arroz con gandules which was a little disappointing because that is what I was looking forward to. However el arroz con red beans was good. El  pernil was also on point. So far, I have enjoyed the food here and would recommend this place to anyone who wants Puerto Rican food. Now I hope the owner or manager of this restaurant reads this because I would like to request that the flag hanging above from ceiling in center of the place be fixed. It is dangling in a way that looks like it was just thrown up there. I have gone there twice within a month and no one has corrected that. We Puerto Ricans feel VERY strongly about our flag, being that not long ago we would be arrested for flying our flag, the way it looks now is not pleasing. So if that can be corrected it would be greatly appreciated. Hey and if you need a new one let me know. Thanks!", "author": "Manny V."}

The pork was very tender and soft - you can break up the meat simply by scraping it with your fork! The yellow hot sauce that was at every table added a nice kick to the meat. \n\nMy boyfriend and I shared the Camarones salad (shrimp salad).

Our food came to us after a long wait the rice and beans that came with the plate was awesome however everything else was horrible. We found plastic on our spoon that was touching the arroz  con grandules ( aka mush from the microwave)when we told the server he just swapped out the spoon and went about his way. The server also failed to mention to us about the happy hour specials. when a group of girls came in that sat next us he decided to go through the whole introduction and recommendations.

Came with their yellow rice, beans, plantains, and a side salad. Decided to venture over to Golden Gate Park for a little lunch al fresco, and it was lovely.\n\nEverything on my plate (well, tin foil bowl thing) was awesome. I could eat a bowl of the rice on it's own. The beans were savory and filling. The plantains had a luscious texture, like if a baked sweet potato and a canned peach had a baby. The salad was the perfect light, acidic thing to break up the otherwise rich food (not that I'm complaining about how rich the food was).\n\nA warning for vegetarians/pescatarians: pay attention to what's in the sides. The rice and the beans both have ham in them, which I didn't know until I got them. A closer look at the \"sides\" on their menu will tell you what I cavalierly overlooked.", "author": "Julien I."}

I came here last night (Sat) at 6:30pm and snagged one of the last tables.  \n\nI ordered the Pastelon ($15) which came with rice (Spanish or white), beans (red=with pork or white=without), salad, and 2 pieces of fried plantains.  The Pastelon was served like a piece of lasagna - sliced plantains acting as the pasta, and a ground beef filling.  The plantains were perfectly cooked, the seasoning was spot on, and if you wanted it spicy you could add some of their homemade habanero hot sauce.  My only criticism is the ground beef was sort of tough, but that was such a minor point relative to the incredible flavor of the dish overall.  \n\nMy next favorite item was the Spanish rice - so flavorful and so vibrant from the saffron.  I saved this side dish for last, I liked it so much!  The fried plantains were also great - nice and crispy on the edges.  The red beans were also tasty and the salad was well-dressed.

The dish comes with rice (I choose spanish), beans (I choose the one with pork), maduros, and salad. The dressing they have for the salad is really good but a little spicy. I recommend trying a little before drenching your salad.  My boyfriend and I always get the pitcher of sangria to share. He drinks a lot so we get the large one. The food is really good, chicken nicely seasoned, tender, and juicy, the onions are sauteed and give a nice crunch to each bite. I am used to sour creme for the tostones. However, they use a different kind of sauce, almost like thousand island but better. It goes well with the tostones and maduros. I usually get an extra sauce because my bf hogs it. \n\nThe service is great. They are pretty attentive of you. They make sure you have everything you need at the table and refill when necessary. Quality of food is great and fresh. Definitely will be returning for the 15746168 time!", "author": "Gabrielle C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-21", "description": "Dear Parada 22, \n\nI've eaten at the restaurant several dozen times, but I am now an ex-customer.  I have put up with the absolutely terrible service at both dinner and brunch because I really love the food.  But I just can't do it again unless you can get your act straight.  I want you to know that I have been a regular.  I am recognized by the staff.  And it has taken a LOT of very bad service to bring me to the point of posting this rant to Yelp.  But I'm done.  The service is intolerable.\n\nLet me be specific:  the wait staff is friendly, but they are some combination of overworked, underpaid, or undertrained because they don't pay any attention to the customers:\n\n1.  No one pays attention when people walk in the door.  I mean, I see that they notice me.  It's a very small room, and I'm the only customer who's standing up, and 2 minutes have passed by.  Am I insane here?  I should not have to walk up to the counter and ask for a table as if I'm the first person that ever entered a restaurant.  One time I waited 5 minutes while the server chatted with a cook, only to be told that a private party was coming soon so no tables would be available for a couple hours.  Are you kidding me?  How hard is it to put a sign up?  Or to just acknowledge me when I walk in?  \n\n2.  After taking my order, no one ever any pays attention to me for the rest of the meal.  At dinner, my water is never refilled, and at brunch, my coffee is never refilled.  Several times now, I've eaten an entire meal - which takes at least 40 minutes - and not been offered a single refill.  Come on!  This is just serving 101.  Circulate with the coffee pot every now and then.  The worst is when I'm offered my first refill as the check is delivered.  Seriously?  Too little, too late.\n\n3.  No one ever notices when I'm ready for the check.  It's really not hard to notice when my napkin is crumpled next to my empty plate.  And I'm talking ten minutes later.  The whole restaurant has less than 10 tables.  Yet, almost every time, I need to flag down the server to ask for the bill.\n\n4.  Here's what really kills me:  I don't just sit there, I make direct eye contact with the servers.  I see that they see me.  And yet they don't come over!  It's incredibly frustrating and just baffling.  When I want the check, I actually have to tug at the server as they pass by or call out loud to them.  \n\nJust so you know, I have always tipped well, and I'm polite.  I know that when several different servers give this terrible service, the problem has to be the management.  I'm sad that I have to give up eating your tasty food.  Let me know if you ever get your act together.", "author": "Trip B."}

There were two other table seated and so when we walked in and only saw tables meant for 4 people and up and a 2/3 seater all the way in the back towards the cash register, I was a bit uneasy.  Not because the tables were all the way in the back but because we got to pick one out of the two. The one in front of the cash register.. was LITERALLY in front of the cash register. How awkward is that? The second option (which we opted for) sat two but one seat was facing an ugly wall (the table was up against the wall in a corner) and the other seat was facing the counter which had a small display of beverages. I seriously felt like I was sitting in time out.\n\nI couldn't understand why we only had these two options and I asked the waitress/cashier if I could switch. She said no because they might have a \"rush\". She did offer a couple times afterwards after she saw me pouting and complaining under my breath and looking super unhappy but being stubborn I refused to move just because I wasn't going to switch back to that seat after a \"rush\" comes in.\n\nfood was absolutely delicious. I don't even care to talk about it in this review just because of the horrible service I got that night. \n\nThe place is just dirty and the bathroom is all the way in the very back past the kitchen which I swear a health inspector should probably go see it. I dont even know how sanitary that place is but whatevs.\n\nWhat made me even more upset was two guys came in and she let them sit at the table that seated 8-10 people. what the heck. I'm not a diva or a princess or anything but this was seriously upsetting that we weren't considered as a priority or even customers for that matter. She never filled our glasses of water but filled theirs and waited on them hand and foot.\n\nService sucked. Go next door to Cha Cha Cha!", "author": "Lauren K."}

The food on the island is saturated with flavor and textures that are so satisfying and different that I always try to eat my way through the island. If you want a sampling of that island experience right now, then you must come to Parada 22, the food transports me back to the many well enjoyed visits and the many wonderful meals I have enjoyed there.\n\nToday I ordered the sampler because after staring at the menu for a long time, I knew that I wanted to try absolutely everything but I'll just have to keep coming back, so I went for the sampler plate to begin with.\n\n\"The Sampler\" features:\nPernil Asado rost pork shoulder marinated with garlic, oregano and traditional Sofrito\nChicharr\u00f3n de Pollo fried boneless chicken with salsa rosa\nMaduros Ripe sweet cooked plantains\nYuca el Mojo is cassava root with onions garlic and olive oil\nTostones traditional fried and pressed green plantains with salsa roja\n\nMind blown!

If I worked nearby I would stop by here for lunch every day, they also have sandwiches with late flavor profiles, that I intend to check out in the future (I was serious when I said I'm going to try everything on the menu).\n\nPlease do try this humble place, it will give yo a feel for who Puerto Rican mamas take good care of their families.", "author": "Bob L."}

We went for lunch, and the decor is very homey--similar to sol food. Lime green walls with black and white pictures. Bf ordered the Bifstec sandwich with avocado ($10.50) and I ordered the mofongo y camarones ($12). I almost always order the camarones criollos at sol food so I figured I should try them here. The mofongo came with camarones criollos so I ordered it with Spanish rice, spring salad and red beans--AMAZING. The shrimp had more of a garlic butter sauce rather than the tomatoey garlic sauce that I'm used to. Everything was amazing. The Spanish rice had chunks of chorizo and the mofongo had a really smooth texture. The steak in the Bifstec sandwich was well seasoned and thicker than I was used to, and it came with a spring salad. Their table sauce was a little creamier than sol foods but pretty good and tangy.

The fried chicken was so tender, perfectly crispy, and so full of flavor especially with the dipping sauce. The plate also comes with rice (get the Spanish!), beans (red or white), greens, and 2 plantain chips. Everything on that plate was delicious!

I ordered the penil (pork) and it was amazing and full of flavor and it came with rice and beans and platanos maduros (sweet plantains). BOMB! And guess what GF'ers????

I am not going to say that I am some kind of Puerto Rican / Caribbean culinary genius, but I have had a LOT of food from the region, as I live in New York and have lived in Miami dating a Puerto Rican for let's just say a really long time.\n\nI think this place hits the spot, thus I would recommend it.  But I cannot say that it is without its imperfections :-)  \n\nLets start with the GREAT parts.\n- The Pastelon really nails it.  Think of a Puerto Rican flavor profile crossed with a lasagna.  ($14)  I wanted MORE though... \n- Pernil ($14) was VERY well seasoned and VERY good .  Think of succulent roast pork with caribbean flavors (likely sofrito).  Delicious.\n- Tostones and side Mayo-Ketchup style sauce was very tasty.\n- Side salads on each plate were very tasty and a good complement to the PRican foods which are full of oil\n- The white rice was cooked to perfection (with a little bit of oil).  I love the way PRican rice is made... similar but tastes different from South and East Asian varieties.\n\nLeast liked:\n- Sangria was mieh.  Really mieh.  We drank it, but were unhappy with it.\n- The Mofongo con Camorones ($14.50)  was very liked but was missing a lot of the mashed plantains component, which we asked for and got more of.  I loved this dish, but want to put here so people know that when they order the Mofongo to ensure they get enough of the plantains.\n\nExcellent service (very attentive) and very friendly.  Will come back.", "author": "Andrew S."}

It's small and cozy, but the dining area is open and not cramped with tables. The high slatted ceilings make it seem even bigger than it is and together with the way the place is decorated and one full brick wall, the ambience is comfortable and totally inviting. The service was very friendly, helpful and quick. If you're not sure what to get, ask, and you will be rewarded.\n\nThe pollo encebellado (marinated boneless chicken sauteed with caramelized onions) was tender and juicy and came with your choice of Spanish or white rice* and white or red beans. The Spanish rice and small bin of red beans were also both well flavored and a good complement to the chicken smothered in tasty onions. A salad is also thrown on the plate with three maduros so you really get a full meal with a lot of different things to sample in one order. The chicharrones de pollo (fried marinated boneless chicken with salsa rosa & tostones) were also excellent, friend but tender on the inside and came with the same options except you get two tostones instead of three maduros.\n\nThe value is great and the food backs it up. Whatever you are doing in the area, Parada 22 is a nice spot to pop into to get a quick, tasty, authentic meal. Top it off with some flan and then get on your way.\n________________\n*Why you would choose white rice over Spanish rice at a place like this I'm not really sure.", "author": "Jonathan G."}

Bloomspot deal of $30 for $15 helped out as it wasn't too pricey to begin with. \n\n* Service\nThere was ONE server running the whole place and she remained stress free and always pleasant. Eg: we needed a table for three and there were only two tops available with maybe a 30 minute wait. One couple was at a table that we noticed could fold out for three and we offered to ask the couple if they could possibly move to one of the two tops but the server gladly asked them for us. \n\n* PERNIL ASADO - 3.5 stars\n(roasted pork, marinated with garlic, oregano base sofrito. $12)\nGood savory meat, great flavor and spicing. Based on other review the meat on this dish should be so tender and succulent that it just falls apart under your fork. While it wasn't quite close to that, I still enjoyed the meat (while it was cooking I kept smelling something amazing and asking what it was- it was this pork every time). Came with greens, plantains, choice of rice, choice of beans.\n\n* CHICHARRON DE POLLO - 3.5 stars\n(breaded and fried chicken thighs served with tostones and salsa rosa dipping sauce. $10.50)\nVery similar review to the pork - flavorful, and the breading on this one was good, but the meat could be more tender. I'd say the flavor was more poignant and unique on the pork. Came with tostones, greens, choice of rice, choice of beans.\n\n* ARROZ DE AMARILLO - 2 stars\n(Spanish rice. $4)\nPlain, not much flavor, only addition to rice grains was I believe peas. Texture was fine as far as spanish rice goes.\n\n* Rice special - 3.5 stars\nNot sure on name but this was much more interesting with lots of veggies and pork and good savory flavoe.\n\n* HABICHUELAS COLORADAS - 1.5 stars\n(homemade red beans in sofrito base sauce. $3.5)\nStrange sauce with weird flavor, and the beans were overcooked and too starchy.\n\n* HABICHUELAS BLANCAS - 3 stars\n(homemade white beans in sofrito base with potato, carrot, and calabaza (vegan). $4)\nMuch better than the red beans, liked the flavor and texture.\n\n* MADUROS - 3.5 stars\n(ripen sweet plantains. $4.50)\nReally nice, moist / soft / sweet.\n\n* TOSTONES - 2 stars\n(traditional fried and salted green plaintains, served with salsa rosa dipping sauce. $4)\nTasted dry, stale, and was overly salted. \n\n* FLAN (plain) - 4 stars\nGreat custard-like texture, good balance of being firm yet our spoons sunk right in.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

I found a deal online for Parada 22, and learning that it was Puerto Rican food similar to that of Sol Food, I needed to give it a try.  It was located in the Haight and not only is it a little shady, but the parking is terrible.

I really enjoyed the mofongo and the pork was nice and tender.  Both had larger portions than my chicken for about the same price.  Overall we enjoyed the meal, but for a meal we expected to be pretty cheap the price tag for the whole thing was a surprise and the total bill (including $20 discount/tax/tip) was $70.  At least we managed to catch a nice buzz by the time we headed out.\n\nParada 22 is no Sol Food, but it's nice to have something sort of similar in the city.

We gladly recommend the Pastel\u00f3n, Camarones a la Criolla, Biftec Encebollado, and Mofongo de Camarones. If you have the appetite for a side dish, have some Tostones, as well. The white beans and the Spanish rice are also great accompaniments. We've seen, but never tried, the Ensaladas and they are huge and look fresh and delicious with a large quantity of beef, chicken, or shrimp on the side. Easily a complete meal. \n\nThe ambience is casual, the walls lined with photos and other memorabilia from Puerto Rico, Caribbean music playing in the background. \n\nDelicious food, affordable prices, and a fun place to eat. Definitely worth a visit!", "author": "David K."}

And a great deal!\n\nI got the mofongo de camarones, pretty late at night (~9:00 pm?), and it was amazing.  I could have used a little more shrimp, but what was on the plate was fantastic.  The red beans had a bacon-y flavor... Don't know if it's from actual bacon or not, but it was tasty! Especially when all mixed up with those delicious mashed plantains and spanish rice. Yum.  I skipped the salad, just because I was so full.\n\nThe ambience of the restaurant is absolutely adorable--it's teeny tiny but the decor is completely charming.  We shared the family table with some other people, which was no problem at all.\n\nOh-- we also got the $25 pitcher of sangria, and honestly even between five of us we had trouble finishing it!  It was strong and there was a whole lot of it.  It also jumped up the price of our dinners by quite a lot.

Only thing keeping one from doing so is the steering wheel, or else they'd crash and hit some pedestrians in the process (duh).  I don't venture down Haight much.  My little sister, on the other hand, has more oft frequented the area than me.  Thinking she had some pointers to where to park, I asked if there were any secret spots.  \"Just drive around the side streets off Haight\".  Thanks little sis, high five for the big help.   \n\nI forgot where I parked exactly.  It was a few blocks away from the restaurant, and yes, it was one of those side streets off Haight.  I guess she deserves a real high five rather than the sarcastic one.  Looking at Parada 22 compared to the Goliath of a restaurant next door, Cha Cha Cha, anyone could easily sweep it to the side as another boring little restaurant.      \n\nTheir take on Puerto Rican contemporary rural charm enchants the restaurant.  We sat near the kitchen and could hear the traffic inside.  Oh the smell of Puerto Rico in the air...never mind...it was the server coming with our food.\n\nOUR ORDER:\n\n*Pernil Asado - Holy Cow!  I mean Holy Pig!  Pork isn't my first desired meat, but they really hit it out of the park with this dish.  Blindly picking the first dish on the menu worked out.  Lightly jabbing my fork into the moist meat, a nugget of astonishment had presented itself.  Coming right off the bone the pork held a lot of flavor.  The described spices and ingredients from the menu were noticeably infused.  Too bad you can't ask for seconds.  Poor pig, happy me, the life cycle continues.    \n  \n*Biftec Encebollado - Biftec means steak?  \"Holy cow\" would have been more appropriate here, yet I liked mine more.  Bun orders steak almost everywhere; her thought process goes a little like this.  When in doubt pick the steak.  On top of the steak were caramelized onions.  Easy going dish emitted an easy reaction from Bun, \"This is really yummy.\"  Absolutely correct is she, as Yoda would put it. \n\nBoth plates came with rice, beans, AND a plantain dessert.  Not to be outdone by their entr\u00e9e centerpiece, the rice and beans were absolutely delicious.  They got other items with a range of sandwiches.  As a novice to Puerto Rican comfort cooking, judging authenticity is obviously not my strong suit.  Nonetheless, the main thing is this.  If this is what authentic Puerto Rican food is like, I'm a fan.", "author": "Arnold T."}

Came here after having my eye on this place for some time. The place is hard to spot as it is very small next to cha cha cha, just keep a look out for its green storefront. Once inside the place is awesome, cool Cuban and Latin decorations inside which gives it an authentic vibe of being in a family kitchen.\nI came here for lunch so I'm not sure if the dinner is a bit different but there were no appetizers on the menu which I was throw off by, that's usually an essential for me but I decided to put it off and got a glass of sangria instead. It is very similar to cha cha chas, fruit in glass and chilled, tasty overall but not one of the best I have had. \nI decided to get the pork plate with yellow rice and white beans. The plate also came with a side salad and plantains but we did not end up getting our plantains till we finished our meal which was an upset. The pork was very good, tender and seasoned well with good spices. The yellow rice and beans also complimented the pork and made it a very filling meal for the small portion that it was.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-11-18", "description": "Amazing Latin American food with generous portions, affordable options, and friendly service! Love!\n\nMy friends and I popped into the small restaurant on Sunday at 11 AM to avoid the lunch crowd, and avoid the noon lunch crowd we did. We were seated at the long table in the back near the kitchen, with only one other couple at the table near the entrance. The waiter was prompt with handing us our menus and our pitcher of lovely spa water chock-full of lemon and lime slices. We didn't realize that lunch started at 11:30 AM (brunch starts at 9 AM), but the waiter said that the only dish that was still in the works was the Mofongo.\n\nAfter some deliberation, we decided to go family style and order 4 plates among 5 girls. The waiter was incredibly patient as we jumped around with our choices, and he was kind enough to bring out 5 clean plates so that we could more easily share the food.\n\nWe ordered:\n\nPOLLO A LA CRIOLLA: marinated boneless chicken sauteed with a hearty smoked ham sofrito [$9]\n- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/parada-22-san-francisco?select=erlTWYMCrpOJpBIT5yqT0Q#1uteoAZUnZ6eGncsW4eYKQ\n- Unlike the pork and the steak, this dish emphasized the paired flavors of the salty sofrito and the tangy chicken. The chicken was tender and juicy, while the sofrito was well-stewed but a bit salty. This was a favorite!\n\nPERNIL ASADO: roasted marinated pork leg with garlic, oregano & baswe sofrito [$10]\n- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/parada-22-san-francisco?select=erlTWYMCrpOJpBIT5yqT0Q#oXsiZGIX-tGuQZnsLuzBkA\n- This entree, along with the sirloin steak, was a dish that highlighted the meat over the seasoning. They gave us a huge portion of pork, although it was a bit dry and bland, especially in comparison to the other meat entrees.\n\nBIFTEC ENCEBOLLADO: marinated sirloin steak sauteed with caramelized onions [$11]\n- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/parada-22-san-francisco?select=erlTWYMCrpOJpBIT5yqT0Q#nPJnNbB3xSknOPsueyOZHw\n- The steak really was the highlight with its smoky undertone and hearty chew. This was another favorite!\n\nSAMPLER: pernil asado, chicharron de pollo, maduros, yuca al mojo & tostones [$11]\n- http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/parada-22-san-francisco?select=erlTWYMCrpOJpBIT5yqT0Q#mJZMnOJBmO5jIFUlOjdWMw\n- The chicharron de pollo was two pieces of fried marinated boneless chicken. At first we didn't think that they would be anything special, but all of us enjoyed it a lot! Yes, it is fried chicken, but the chicken is rich and juicy and its breaded coating is crunchy and not-too-salty. With the salsa rosa, it was perfect!\n- Maduros. I love them. Whenever I go to a Latin American restaurant, I have to have them. These beautiful fried ripened sweet plantains were absolutely scrumptious, like taking bites into soft carmelized banana chunks.\n- The yuca al mojo was cassava root with onions, garlic, and olive oil. I mistook them for plaintain chips, but they had a bolder taste that was much enjoyed.\n- The tostones were traditional pressed fried green plantains. It looked as if they were stewed with onions. They're very different from the maduros, as most of the flavor comes from the plaintains themselves. I didn't enjoy the taste as much, although I liked the texture. I think I was supposed to dip it into the salsa rosa though...\n\nAll entrees aside from the sampler came with a side of salad (with delicious dressing), side of maduros (love love love!), and choices of either white rice or Spanish rice and white beans or red beans. We chose the Spanish rice and red beans for all 3 dishes (thank you Yelpers!), and we couldn't have been happier with our choices! The red beans were cooked with ham and vegetables, giving it variety and flavor.\n\nAt $11.30 per person, tip and tax included, Parada 22 is delicious AND affordable. I would come back for the maduros, the Pollo a la Criolla for pairing of chicken and sofrito, and the Biftec Encebollado for the steak itself. Can't wait!", "author": "Adele F."}

I was quite surprised they had mayo ketchup as I requested it before at another Puerto Rican restaurant only to be given a blank expression. The pique was also very good.

I'm an aficionado.  If you know of a restaurant that serves a Cuban Sandwich as good or better than this, I'd be shocked. Every ingredient is generously represented.  A big portion of roast pork, thick planks of pickle... It is a fat, juicy, mustard-y, pickle-y sour, crunchy crusty, pork-y tender, cheese-y gooey, slice of heaven. The salad side has has just the right amount of vinaigrette and even though I wish I could have tostones sub in instead, the salad is gobbled up. The big bottle of hot \"sauce\" spikes up the sammy as much as you do or don't like. Wish I could offer you a picture, but as soon as I touched it, the juice was running down my hands (a four napkin event) and there was no way to stop and grab the camera.

Both meats were so tender...and the tostones, the best I've tried in a long time, other than the ones we make at home; so we asked for an extra order of tostones.\n\nMy husband ordered a red wine sangria. It's not the kind of sangria I'm used to, which is sweet & fruity, this was more like wine, but still good.\n\nBeware, finding parking in the area could be rough (we parked in a nearby parking metered spot). They have lots of Puerto Rican decorations and mementos, and the place is tiny, I think it can sit about 25 people.\n\nI found the customer service to be a little slow even when the place wasn't packed.

A cool menu full of sunshine, but my heart really goes to the Pastelon, a dish with sweet plantains layered with ground beef with olives, raisins, and peppers... OMG ! Yeah, it might sounds like a puerto rican version of the moussaka, but one thing is sure, it really feels like a great comfort food coming from the island, the kind of you expect to have on sunday in a local family, and that's great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-11", "description": "After hearing the ridiculous hour plus wait at the popular Cuban place next door, step right over to Parada 22, take a seat, and order a beer or sangria for the shorter ten minute wait.  There's a certain charm to this homestyle Puerto Rican restaurant - classic jars and cans, old photos on the walls, the open kitchen, and quaint community tables.  It's small, so some big groups got split up.  Either that, or the other tables were holding out on us when strangers were passing pitchers of sangria between tables.\n\nOf course, we started with a $12 half pitcher of sangria of our own.  Light on the ice, and heavy on the sangria, although there wasn't much fruit except for lemons.\n\nWe split the Sampler of pernil asado, chicharron de pollo, maduros, yuca al mojo, and tostones.  The stars were obviously the plantains - one pan-fried and the other deep-fried.  The chicken and pork were the same as the entrees, and sadly, I didn't get to try the chicken.  The cassava root was soft, gooey, and delicious.  For $11, the Sampler would have made for a great main course by itself.\n\nThe $12.50 Pernil Asado was a super tender chunk of roasted pork leg with garlic, oregano, and base sofrito.  The pork was tender and delicious, although it started tasting too salty about halfway through, so be forewarned.  (I would suggest getting the Sampler to try the pork and ordering a different entree.)  All entrees were accompanied with a small salad, maduros, red or black beans, and Spanish rice.  The pan-fried plantains and Spanish rice were particularly delicious, and well worth the visit alone... along with the sangria, of course.", "author": "Kevin W."}

On August 27, 2017 my friend and I decided to visit Parada 22 for a early dinner(my third visit). With much enthusiasm we went and asked to be seated at a table and was told by the waitress our wait time would be approximately 10-15 minutes. That's no problem and quite frankly an easy wait for Parada22. My friend and i watched as tables became empty, one in particular sits 4(the table by the window) we thought she would offer that table to us since it was the first table that became empty. A couple and son walks in and she gives them that table, fine no biggy! So we finally get a table and upon her arrival we decided to put our orders in immediately (Sampler plate and 2 chicharrones) since we were starving by them. I just want to mention that this was probably one of the least busy ive seen Parada 22, our appetizer took a long time, and when it finally arrived we were super excited and ready to sample, assuming our meal would come out a bit after. So we are eating our appetizer and my friend ask for additional side of sweet plantains. I notice a while after the plantains arrive but our main dish is still not here. We realize its been close to an hour that we've been here so i call over our waitress and ask her when will our food arrive. Her response, \"i just put in, i thought you guys were waiting until you ate your appetizer\" We were so confuse and puzzled we didnt say much! I didnt know you wait until someone finish eating their appetizer to put in an order for the main dish. Our food finally arrives and evem though we are super upset we decide to dig in. Complaining underneath our breath we notice a african American male walk im and gets seated not paying much attention to him. A few minutes later a couple walks in and gets seated in the same table, l didn't here what the couple asked, but her response, ' i dont know where he went.\" The young man walks in looking puzzled since he had already put in his order. Im not sure what was said but i saw him walk over to another table. Holding his head down, he kept looking back at his table and out the window. I felt so uncomfortable, sad and hurt. I was so upset, she has totally ruined our day, we are about to call management and report our experience.  I will never return, i can't believe in 2017 racism is still alive and well!!! She didnt give us her name but shes a Blondie, medium-built with tattoos. We also called to ask for the manager and she hung up the phone on me!!!!!!!!!", "author": "Kimberlee W."}

Street parking, lots of foot traffic with the many other restaurants & shops on this strip. We lucked out finding parking just half a block up soon as we got there; didn't drive around long at all, but might be different story for other nights.\n\nCUST SVC: Friendly & thorough service from the moment you walk in to the moment you get ready to leave with the 2ppl covering the floor! Food prepared & brought out in a reasonable time frame for all sitting patrons. Keep up the great service! \n\nRESTAURANT: In agreeance with other Yelpers, yes the place is small, but stays full. Walk through entrance doors, heavy rubber drapes (that keep the breeze to a min w/ ppl walking in & out) & immediately come to a dinning tables that likely have sitting patrons. Waiter/Waitress will signal you from where ever they're standing to let you know they see you, come over (or signal) to inquire how many #ppl in our party & take your name. Have to walk through their kitchen to use bthrm. Seems friendly for babies/kids, parties 2-4ppl, ppl various shapes/sizes; could be handicap/wheelchair friendly, but may be a hassle during heavy eating times.

BF-J & I both opted for the side of Arroz Amarillo, which was a tasty choice! Red beans cooked perfectly w/ sweet peppers, green olives, & smoked ham; really well seasoned side dish. The Maduros (sauteed plantains) were cooked & lightly seasoned; a suttle sweet compliment to each savory bite.

The boyfriend randomly declared that he wanted to try out Parada for a weekend lunch, and a quick glace at the menu was all I needed to get on board. Parada is a tiny spot-- I can only imagine how crazy it must be during peak hours. I think we came right at the end of brunch peak (1pm on Saturday) so we only had to wait 5-10 minutes for a table (although there was room for us to sit along the bar when we arrived.)\n\nThe service was very attentive from the get-go, which is always a plus. The two of us ordered a 1/2 pitcher of Sangria, which was a LOT for us. Seriously, it was a great portion for the the 1/2 pitcher. They didn't fill it with ice or too much fruit, so we actually received a good amount of sangria to enjoy. \n\nIn terms of food-- you have to get the plantains. Despite the fact that most dishes come with a few fried plantains, we ordered another side, because who doesn't love them? They were crispy and warm and sweet-- just like my grandmother used to make. \n\nWe were there during brunch, so I got their version of huevos rancheros, which came smothered in salsa, over perfectly runny poached eggs. I also got white beans (which is the veggie option) and rice, which made for an overly satisfying meal (but we still finished off the side order of plantains..) My boyfriend had the popular mofongo, which was a heaping plate full of yummy things that I don't eat-- but he enjoyed.\n\nI definitely will be back for more-- it might be one of my new (to me) favorites!", "author": "Bryan B."}

But no, it was delicious. It was by far the happiest Spanish-infused meal I could've hoped for. The place itself is really nice and unassuming too, quiet and on the smaller side.\n\nThe only nasty surprise is this: there's tiny bits of pig (ham, bacon, what have you) in freaking everything. But if you're mostly meat-less (and in this case, pig-less) and hungry like me, you'll eat around it, no problem. It's worth it.\n\nThe beans are good, the plantains are good (sweet or savory, however you get them on the side), and the fried chicken is fantastic. Even better, there's lots of everything.

The Cubanitas, are the most flavorful that I have had ANYWHERE. \n\nDenay is a a fantastic waitress that will provide excellent guidance, and ensures that everyone in this small restaurant are well looked after. \n\nOverall, it's a cozy feel, with a relaxing yet somewhat energized presence that makes one wish they could call it their regular joint.", "author": "Gabe D."}

I was in SF for a conference and since my brother lives in town I wanted to meet him for dinner one night too. He had just taken a trip to Puerto Rico over the summer and lives close to the Haight so he suggested meeting at Parada 22. I had to take the Muni from the FiDi, but the stop was a short walk to the restaurant. We were seated right away at about 6:30 on a Monday night, but the place is fairly small so you might expect a wait on the weekends. \n\nMy brother got the Chicharrones De Pollo, which is one of his favorites and I wanted to try the shrimp Mofongo since it was new to me. Both came with beans, rice, a green salad and your choice of sweet or crispy plaintains. Mofongo is sort of a plaintain mash with various types of meat and/or veggies mixed in. My shrimp were pretty tasty, but the plaintain mash itself had a few too many bell peppers for my taste. The salad, beans and rice were all very very good. If you can handle it try some of the hot sauce on the table, but beware it has quite the kick. It really jazzed up my beans and rice. My favorite part of my plate were the sweet plantains. My brother really recommends the chicken in the future and I would love to come back and try it. \n\nHe and I also split a half carrafe of sangria and it was absolutely perfect. Not too sweet but with a smooth finish. We both really enjoyed it, espcially with the spicy food. Some of the best sangria I have had in a while. Service was good, even though it was basically just one guy running the whole show. I went to use the restroom and you have to walk through the kitchen and it looked like there were just two guys there that night. I was impressed at all they did. Our bill came to less than $40 before tip, which is downright amazing for the quality of food and being right on Haight. I definitely need to take my husband back here the next time we are in the city sans kids.", "author": "Lisa H."}

Not a bad thing at all, I prefer a place where the cooks have the time to focus on your food, and it really preserves that eating-over-at-a-friend's-house feel. Their sangria is very smooth, like 'you don't know how much you've had until you stand up and the room spins' smooth. Their mofongo is excellent (and it's fun to say...mofongo!) and their pork is slide off the bone tasty. Their dinner plates are massive and will please even the largest appetites. Pecking eaters will likely have lunch for the next day.\n\nFinally, the staff really treats the place like it's their family kitchen and you're a guest. They were always quick to the table, checked on us often, and made sure we felt welcome. Parada 22 is tucked away a bit, so amongst all the other fanfare on Haight you might not know it's there, but if you don't, you're missing out.", "author": "Kevin B."}

So when we saw mofongo on the menu we thought \"hurrah!\".\n\nSmall, but cozy, we weren't greeted immediately but found space at the counter - then, eventually saw a table opening up so ran over to it!  It's always fun to go to a restaurant to find out almost no-one on the staff is FROM the region (we asked - only the chef is, they told us!).  We ordered the pastelon (think Puerto Rican lasagna - made w/ sweet plantains in lieu of noodles, and their spices in the meat!) and, of course, the mofongo, along w/ a 1/2 pitcher of sangria.\n\nSangria was KILLER - 1/2 more than enough for two in terms of strength!  But there must have been an ice shortage for both it, and our water.  \n\nPastelon: receives an A from the hubby (and me.\nMofongo: we've had it MANY, many, many times in the island, at all sorts of places - but never with a cream-based sauce like this one had.  Normally, its \"shell\" holds together until you forcibly cut it - this one crumbled.  Taste was good, just not the \"traditional\" mofongo we were looking for.\nThe other tests:\nRice - a bit oily for us, but not out of line.\nBeans - my hubby does them better ;-)\nOther - even tho' BOTH of our dishes were based on plantains, we had extra sides of sweet plantains served alongside - bit of an overkill, but done well!\n\nGiven the difficulty finding parking and the \"good but not great\", probably won't go there again.", "author": "Marie O."}

The ranch-y sauce they serve with it is delicious, and it's a great way to try all of their hit items. The pernil asado was really good and tender, the chicharrones were okay.\n\nFor drinks, I would skip the lemonade or sweet tea. My coworker said the lemonade was way too sweet and my sweet tea wasn't that great either.\n\nFor my entree, I had the pollo a la criolla which is a chicken dish with a ham saucey stirfry thing on top. It was delicious! I love how they grilled the chicken perfectly so it had that great grill-y flavor while still remaining its tenderness. I got it with the spanish rice and red beans (which are kidney beans with ham). I would recommend getting the white beans with this dish, because the red bean sauce tastes very similiar to the ham sofrito and they are both a tad too salty when eaten together. My coworkers had the pollo encebollado and it looks AMAZING! Definitely getting either that or the pernil asado next time.", "author": "Christina L."}

In general, there was too little garlic and too much salt, which is a bad combination. The pernil asado had areas that were far too fatty, and those which weren't were dry and tough. The sofrito in the pollo a la Criolla really didn't come together, at least partially because the peppers were not chopped finely enough. The yellow rice was notably bland and the habichuelas coloradas also suffered from the sofrito. The cuban sandwich was actually the worst I've had - a lackluster roll with dull ham, the same dry tough roasted pork, and not much else going on. The ingredients aren't premium and there's nothing bringing everything together. \n\nI will say that the tostones, while a bit nontraditional, were my favorite of all the ones I've tried, and the maduros were good too. The chicharrones de pollo did not have traditional Puerto Rican flavoring, but they were pretty tasty. So if you find yourself here, I would recommend ordering among those items.

Pretty small space, their are stools along one wall and community style seating. Luckily, my friends & I were able to get the corner table.\nI wanted my tostones fix, so I order the cubano wit tostones versus the salad. Yum, the sandwich is a lot smaller than usual cubanos but not a problem bc u end up pretty stuff. The salad is just a plain mixed green salad.\nMy friend got the pollo   Which came with a side of rice (Spanish or white),beans & maduros (sweet plaintains).\nFor the area, the prices are fair. Not sure why it's right next to cha cha cha's since they serve somewhat of the same style food. But the food is really good n I was happy to get my fix.

I don't have much exposure to Puerto Rican/Cuban/Latin American food so the review is based own individual preference rather than judgment of authenticity.\n\nService can almost get five. For some reason both the servers we had were new to the job, still, they managed to do a great job. The restaurant itself is quite small, a few slightly longer table plus a few more regular tables. Avoid busy hours if you don't want to wait. We sat at the kid's corner, with crayons on the table. \n\nCoconut Flan -- 5++ STARS -- If you love coconut and/or flan, you must try this. If you don't, try this and it might change your mind about either coconut or flan. The flan had great consistency, smooth and creamy, but not overbearingly thick. The bottom was a thin layer of shredded coconut. Really really sweet but so gooood. \n\nCamarones a la Criolla -- 4 STARS -- The dish tasted great, but I cannot say there's anything special about it. I liked the fried banana though :) I think there should be more sauce that come with the shrimp, which goes great with the coconut-flavored rice. Order the white bean instead of the kidney bean, much more flavorful and not too sticky. Also came with a salad. \n\nChicharrones de Pollo -- 3 STARS -- I didn't try the boneless chicken, but according to my friend, the chicken was way to try that she had to dip in the sauce to swallow it. Again, loved the friend plantain.\n\nIn short, worth the money because I had the Groupon and would totally come back to try more dessert!", "author": "Maggie L."}

Ordered the Cuban sandwich and I was really happy when it came out.  Per their menu, it is the Cubano Clasico - roasted pork, smoked ham, pickles, dijon mustard & swiss cheese (9.50).  I did order mine without the dijon mustard as I'm not into dijon and although I could be wrong, thought it might be more authentic without it.\n\nI discovered the sandwich on arrival to be so nicely made with fresh bread and excellent ingredients...finally, a place that looks and tastes authentic!  The roast pork and ham was very nicely done and it really hit the spot, exactly what I was looking for.  As always, more is better and the sandwich was so good that I wished it were bigger, but for what it was, it did just fine.  I'll take quality over quantity every time.\n\nTheir water pitcher had lemons in it which I thought was a nice touch...in a cute neighborhood place like this, it means that someone really cares.

We both had the red beans and Spanish rice.  We shared the coconut flan for dessert.  It was more gelatiny than custardy but I am not a flan expert.  It tasted great.\n\nWe would definitely come back.", "author": "Vicki D."}

The compostable plates and friendly staff with normal sized posteriors didn't seem that authentic though.  I agree with other Yelpers that the tostones are sorely missed.  However, on a coast where there is too much Mexican food it is nice to see a Puerto Rican outpost.\n\nChicharr\u00f3n de Pollo: That's Puerto Rican for Fried Chicken!  Could use some extra breading/crispness compared to it's light shell.  The meat though was nice and juicy.\n\nPernil Asado: A few slices of pork roast with a hearty bit of tasty fat attached to each piece.  Very tender meat and melt away fat.  Texture was spot on, but not as spice infused as pernil asado I've had in NYC and Miami.\n\nArroz de Amarillo: Was very Goya-esqe.  Yellow in color, though didn't particularly scream saffron so much as food coloring.  Some veggie bits.  More exciting than white rice at least...\n\nHabichuelas Coloradas: Surprisingly flavorful red beans in a stew base.  Enough spices going on not to miss the pork lard.  Might have been the highlight of the meal.\n\nHabichuelas Blancas: White beans in a stew base, not nearly as exciting as the red beans.  A tad bland.\n\nYuca al Mojo: Boiled, not fried, yuca.  The creamy onion mojo sauce worked very well to flavor the otherwise bland boiled tuber.  And to think, I almost didn't order this because it wasn't fried!\n\nMaduras: Came with the main dish along with rice & beans as any good Puerto Rican plate should have.  Sweet, though a little oily.\n\nRum Cake: Reminiscent of Italian rum cakes.  Light yellow cake layers with a very creamy rum custard in between.

I like how they added a small salad too with not too much dressing so it didn't take over the other wonderful flavors of the dish. \n\nHonestly, I had planned on putting half aside to eat later because for lunch, this was a lot of food but dang, I ate the whole thing!  My friend had the coconut flan for dessert & it was delicious as well.  Overall, a great value for the quality & amount of food you are getting. \n\nVery friendly staff and neat decor.  I like the choice of tables from high to regular.  The only reason I'm not giving it a 5 star is that it took a while to be served & get the check. They were very busy & there were only 2 women working.  They did a wonderful job & weren't ruffled at all.  I'll definitely be back!  What a great find!", "author": "Donna W."}

I don't want anybody to know just how amazingly delicious their food is!!!\n\nOk well the cat's out of the bag. I loooove Puerto Rican food and have been looking for a good place in the city. We drove all the way to San Rafael for Sol Food a couple of months back just to satisfy our need, but we don't want to to drive that far all the time. So happy Parada 22 is in the Haight, closer to where we live. \n\nFirst off, the place is so cute! It's small-ish. Maybe 10 tables? And a bar table along the wall for maybe 10 people, if one of the tables isn't free. As fas as I can tell everyone who worked there were Puerto Rican so yay points for authenticity. \n\nFood- we ordered the Sides Sampler (Pernil asado, chicharr\u00f3n de pollo, maduros, yuca al mojo & tostones).. wowsers wowoweee everything was sooo good!!! Probably one of the best tostones ever. The pernil asado was like magic, so tender and melted in my mouth. The chicharron de pollo  was dang good. Of course I love maduros, and the yuca al mojo not only looked homestyle, it tasted like it too. You need to get this dish.. we shared it as appetizer, but you can prob make a meal out of it. For my main dish I had the Mofongo de Camarones (mashed plantains and shrimp).. another great tasting dish. It comes with either red or white beans, white or spanish rice, maduros and some leafy greens. My partner ordered the Pastelon, which is like  lasagna but made with sweet plantains. We have been searching for this dish all around the world LOL.. it's one of my favorite ever. And their version is excellent. A must try! Again it comes with beans, rice, maduros, and greens.\n\nWe arrived later for lunch and was lucky to be able to grab a table. There was a steady stream of customers while we were there so they get busy. No surprise here.. we'll be back.\n\nPS.. just read some of the Yelpers and comment on service. We didn't have any problem with ours; it was fast friendly and efficient.", "author": "Vol T."}

Parada 22 is not just one of the hundreds of nooks on Haight street. Specializing in Cuban staples, they don't use grease to make flavor, but a mix of marination, fresh meats and simple grilling to make tasty treats.\n\nThe space is small but a huge lofted ceiling gives an airy and light vibe. Cuban music is in the air and a dramatic photo mural accents one wall, while a pantry filled with old-school Cuban condiments coats the other. Someone thought about this space. The lawn style chairs weren't the most comfortable, but used the space to it's max. A small and exposed kitchen whipped up an amazing Cuban grilled chicken sand which with avocado and sauteed onions (pressed, of course) and a side of the boiled Yuca was amazing. My friend got a side of grilled plantains (a personal favorite), a bean soup, so filled with flavored chunks of meat and veggies, it was almost a meal in of it's self. The chicken was juicy, the spices subtle and on point, and the waitress, all smiles!\n\nThis place is a little gem!!

Holy exquisite melding of flavors!  There is the option to add avocado if you would like to, and while I do add avocado to almost everything, I suggest not doing it.  Why would you want to mess with perfection? However, you must get at least a half pitcher of Sangria. I have roughly the tolerance of a six foot 235 lb. man, and half a pitcher between 2 or even 3 people is more than enough.  It's strong and it's delectable.\n \nI usually wander in at around 9pm on a Friday night and the place is always slammed.  It's already a cozy building, but filled to capacity, you're definitely making some new best friends or at least brushing shoulders, elbows, and knees with strangers.   Which is all the better because I like it when my dinner experience has that element of convergence.  \n\nI always run into the same two women working the register and running the food, who are both amazing.  Last time I ended up waiting around 10 minutes for a table, a modest price to pay for sandwich ecstasy, and they brought my friend and me a glass of sangria, and even remembered me from a previous visit.  \n\nThe ambiance is charming; warm lighting, a cabinet filled with pictures and keepsakes from Puerto Rico, and the sounds of laughter and happy people enjoying their food.   \n\nParada 22 is absolutely stellar, and you would be remiss to not go and savor a meal here.", "author": "Kimberly L."}

Did not get a great first impression because it was hard to get anyone to notice you or seat you. We did not get any service until we walked up to the very front  and tried to talk to one of the waitresses. The waitresses were friendly, but not very attentive. This place has a homey atmosphere, with wooden tables/chairs and a lot of wall art...but I didn't really notice the decor until later because i was too caught up in trying to get the waitresses to notice ust. \n\nThe food was good (though not mind blowing). I had the biftek (grilled steak) dish. The entree came with salad, rice (spanish or white rice), plantains (fried & sweet), beans (red beans that are cooked with ham OR white beans-vegetarian choice). The plate is 13 dollars. My friends had the pork leg and fried chicken..those were pretty good/flavorful compared to my beef. \n\nOut of everything in the plate, I like the plantains the most. It was warm,  crispy, and sweet...so good! Salad was fresh, the rice and beans were fine. They cooked their beans with vegetables/ham so it was probably better than beans you get elsewhere. However, the rice and beans I don't find anything too special about them in terms of taste...they were moist...so guess that part was good. The beef was a little tough, it was juicy enough...but tough. Tasted good with the onions on top,.but can't say it's awesome (it was a little on the bland side). Put the hot sauce on your steak!\n\nOne thing I like about the place is that they give you a pitcher of water with fresh orange/lime in it, it was great. My friend loved the water. \n\nAfter we were done, it took a while to get our check (a lot of waiting around and waitresses not noticing you at this place...). By the time we're done (around 8:30pm?) there was a 15-20 min wait for people who are coming in. \n\nOverall, good experience, but not awesome. Good dining atmosphere, but slow/inattentive service. Probably not a place for big groups because of the wait unless you come early (the place is small). Need to try their sangria next time.", "author": "Whitney W."}

So I can say with confidence that my palate is pretty refined when it comes to Puerto Rican food. \n\nAfter having discovered Sol Food in San Rafael and remembered why I love Puerto Rican food, I have been on the hunt for a PR joint in SF that can rise to the occasion and battle Sol Food. Thanks to Living Social, I was introduced to Parada 22. \n\nMind you, I usually mark places who get in on these coupon deals as struggling or a new place looking to get publicity and new customers. Thankfully, Parada 22 is new and did not fall into the struggling category (The established joints who need the living social's or groupon's of the world are almost always struggling due to SHIT service and even more clueless management who cannot for the life of them figure out how to fix the flow of the shit experience they offer- just sayin).\n\nThe waitress was so nice and very knowledgeable about the cuisine and menu, never spouting word for word explanations of the dishes or ingredients committed to memory from the menu. \n\nThe food and service was better than expected and could even rival Sol Food. Because of this, I go back to this spot all the time and am happy to pay full price- I cannot say this has been the same experience I have had with other Coupon Deals. Now, when I go back, the waitresses remember me and even suggest new takes on dishes I have been ordering or a couple changes/additions they make to certain dishes etc. I love that personal feel...and when you are eating in a place that is as small as Parada 22, it is even more fitting when you feel like you know the peeps running the joint. I have tried everthing on the menu and everything is delicious...ok, all the meat options.

Because I don't choose to eat pork, I appreciated having our waitress tell us that we had a choice on the rice and beans between the pork rice and beans side and the non-pork choices.\n\nI can't speak directly to the authenticity of whether the food was strictly Puerto Rican or not, because I've never been there. But having spent time eating more than my fair share of beans, rice and fried plantains in Spanish Harlem while I lived in New York City, I can definitely say this satisfied my craving for Caribbean-style food.\n\nI will say that by the time we finished eating, the salivating folks waiting for a table were ready to snatch up ours. I can imagine they get very busy here!\n\nDelicious food, coloring pages for the kids, attentive wait staff. I will definitely be back!", "author": "Susan L."}

Since moving to the Bay, I haze my boyfriend into trekking to Sol in San Rafael for my Borinquen fix. \n\nThe first time I chanced a taste here, my skepticism could have flooded the tiny space twice over. Months later, I've gone here at least once every two weeks since moving to the Upper Haight and while your average neighborhood go-to spot is usually hit-or-miss, I can't stress how satisfying this food is here and you get your money's worth. I've sampled a pretty diverse range of their offerings including the Pernil Asado and Biftec Encebollado. The Camarones a la Criolla is so delicious! The mofongo is kick ass; packed with flavor. The spanish rice is the way to go. I also love the maduros; they are made exactly how I'd want them. The tostones are great; the dipping sauce is truly something special. \n\nI've never waited longer than 10 minutes for seating and I have gotten my noms on within an additional 15min every time. Still, I'd suggest avoiding this place 8p onwards on a Saturday. It's literally a hole-in-the-wall, however cute, so it can get cramped on a busy night. Good luck with a group at any time. There are only two or three larger tables so 4 or 5 folks might best be your max. Overall, the service is above average; they have even gone as far as to remember my name and are quite friendly and accommodating. \n\nWhy four stars and not five? Every once in a while, something seems to be missing in the seasoning department. Usually when I've ordered for takeout. Not sure what that's about; completely remedied by the hot sauce in my cupboard though.", "author": "Aushlee C."}

It looked very different than most I had tried in San Juan but the flavor here was off the charts! We also tried the spicey beef layered with sweet plantain. This was actually the first thing I ate in San Juan and I was not impressed at all.

After glancing at the prices, I began to have second thoughts. It was over $20 for a pitcher of sangria so we opted for the half-pitcher ($12). When it came to the table we were surprised to find a full small-size pitcher of sangria. I had seen the smaller pitcher at other tables and thought this was the size of a full-pitcher. I'm glad we went with the half because for two people it was plenty, it was good, and it was STRONG.   \n\nFoodwise- Yes, yes, and YES!! We split a Pernil Asado (roasted pork) and something from the specials menu that was beef layered with plantains. Both came with salad, rice (we opted for Spanish rice), and beans (red beans for us omnivores. White beans available for vegetarians). The pernil asado came also came with plantains. Both dishes were fantastic, with the special beef-plantain-layered thing holding a slight edge.\n\nMy assessment: The food bears a mysterious lip-smacking I-can't-believe-I-ate-a-whole-plate --ness (You can't stop eating!) that reminds me of the Caribbean but without the humidity.\n\nIn short: Have some patience, get the sangria, trust the specials, and enjoy the Caribbean without the humidity", "author": "Loli L."}

I haven't had Puerto Rican food much, and this restaurant in the Haight is a bit far away, but it is definitely worth a stop.  They serve quality food at affordable prices.\n\nIf you're not sure what you want, I recommend starting with the Sampler Platter, which comes with both the sweet and salty plantains, yucca, pernil asado, chicharron, and a mixed green salad.  It is a good amount of food for $11.  I liked all of the individual items that were included.  My only complaint would be that the pernil asado can be a bit dry, but the meat's flavor was very good.  The chicarron was crispy, garlicky, and delicious.  And I loved the sweet plantains, but I think it would be hard to mess those up.\n\nOf the entrees, I've tried the sauteed steak, the mofongo, and a sauteed chicken special in a tomato sauce.  Each entree comes with a mixed green salad, a choice of white or red beans, white or spanish rice,and the sweet plantains. The portions are definitely very big.  For $11 or so, I think that the steak is a great deal.  It was cooked well and the texture and flavor were both excellent.  The mofongo (mashed green plantains and shrimp) was different from anything I've had before, and while it was good, I thought that it was a bit heavy because it was so starchy.  Finally, the chicken entree was savory, but extremely salty, so I wouldn't order that again.  Of the beans, the white one tastes like a salsa/soup whereas the red one tastes like a chili (I prefer the white).  The salad is good and the spanish rice balances out the meal.\n\nService was mixed.  It was good the first time I went, but they didn't really come over to check up on us or refill our water on my second visit (different waitress).

We left our names on the counter and went outside to wait because the restaurant is so very small and packed. We waited for about half an hour, finally a waitress comes out and acknowledges us and another couple and said \"two tables will clear up in about 5 minutes.\" She sat the other couple first, we waited for another 15 minutes outside, no tables or whatever. Another couple just walked in and got seated. The couple that was seated earlier stood up and left because they were ignored, and we thought \"oh, there's our table.\" But NOPE, the waitress moved another party of two that was sitting at the bar-like tables and sat them there. We finally figured that maybe she had forgotten about us, and it was confirmed with the look on her face when she saw us waiting inside instead. So, she made room at  the ends of the long table (that another party was occupying) to seat us.\n\nService aside, the food was pretty good. The Biftec Encebollado consists of very flavorful saut\u00e9ed steak and onions, although the meat was a bit too chewy. The mofongo was all the hype that I read; savory flavors and large shrimps, but whatever that was under the shrimps and onions were very salty. We had the coconut flan to-go and that was very good as well. The texture was kind of like a hybrid of pudding and custard.\n\nP.S. I personally liked (*gasp!* coming from a person who doesn't like beans) the white beans better, it had more flavor than the red beans.", "author": "Annie C."}

Pictures and trinkets adorn the cabinets...\n\nOh yeah, the food, you ask? \n\nIf you visit Parada 22, you will find yourself enamored with the food. There's just enough salt, pepper, and spice to provide you with a pleasurable taste sensations but there's hot sauce on the table if you need it. At first glance, when we received our food, I wondered if it would be enough because the presentation is clean and the food just looks too perfect. However, once you take a bite and start devouring the plantains, the Spanish rice, the mofongo, and guzzle all the delicious food down with a Citrus mint drink, you will be full for the rest of the day (and very content).

No problem. Hostess greeted us and said we would get the next table. We're the only ones waiting for a table at this point. Few minutes later another couple comes in, two chicks, not cute, at least nowhere as cute as me and my old lady. Hostess acknowledges them, tells them it will be a few. Table opens up and we are waiting for the hostess to clear it as the two non-cute girls ask if they can sit there and the hostess says yes. Strike one. I was annoyed but wasnt that bent out of shape cuz another table was opening up while this was going on. We get our table maybe 30 seconds later. So now were waiting to order. Another couple comes in, cuter than the girls but dressed like douche bags. They get a table. Now this is the part that finally made me decide to bad mouth the service, the hostess who is apparently the hostess /waitress /busboy /bartender, takes the two chicks orders, than the douchey couples orders, than after putting their food and drink orders in, comes to our table. Straight BS. Common courtesy and good customer service to take care of us first. Oh well. Food was awesome though, I had the pork and my girl had the steak. Pork was good but my girls steak was killer. Good food, good price. They just need more staff instead of making one person handle everything outside of the kitchen.

Although there was some concern about getting a table, we went early enough to grab 8 seats and had a really good time. The owner/waiter was great and kept us very happy.

While being in the Bay for most of the last ten years, I was one of the lucky ones to enjoy Sofrito in Oakland while it existed; to this day, I truly miss their Puerto Rican food.  I'm the type that, when in NYC, I will stop by in Spanish Harlem for some of that real Puerto Rican food; I've also been lucky enough to attend some Puerto Rican quinceaneras where I had the most amazing pernil, arroz con gandules, and tostones.  Clearly, I love Puerto Rican food! \n\nAfter some friends recommended this place, I decided to give it a try.  I was still holding out hope that I could find some of that legit Puerto Rican cuisine here.  After having the pernil and arroz con gandules here, unfortunately, this place just doesn't measure up anywhere near the Puerto Rican food I've had.  I gave it three stars because, while I wouldn't classify the food as Puerto Rican (it's more Cuban I think), it was still decent.  The pernil was tasty and juicy and perfectly cooked, however, it didn't taste like any of the Puerto Rican pernil I have ever had; same w/ the rice.  It may have to do w/ the spices used, or lack thereof here.  If I wasn't going in expecting legit Puerto Rican food, my rating might have been higher.  However, they advertise themselves as Puerto Rican cuisine and, from my experience having Puerto Rican food around this country, it just didn't measure up.", "author": "Abraham E."}

The rice was alittle overdone, the way it should be and the salad had a sweet dressing. I ate well for the value of the groupon and paid for some flan to go. Mmm...flan. \n\nThe restaurant is small and filled with warm wooden furniture. The decorations are Latin, geared towards Puerto Rican culture. Not sure who the photos are of the people posted but kinda wished it depicted more of how Puerto Ricans look with the wide variations in hair, skin and eye color.

As a \"real\" Puerto Rican, I can say that most of the food is very legit. This place was even loved by my traditional Mother who is very hard to please.\n\nThe best stuff to order is the pastel\u00f3n de carne (which is a pretty much a plantain lasagna) with rice and beans (go for the white rice and red beans). Another great favorite are the chicharrones de pollo. I'd say that the pork is the least authentic of all their dishes, but everything else is on spot.\n\nI've got a comment for all the angry vegans/vegetarians, seriously, as a Puerto Rican it offends me that you expect a Puerto Rican restaurant to have vegan options for you. First of all, this place is relatively cheap... it is not meant to cater to all of the different substitutions for your delicate diet.  Second of all, we Puerto Ricans don't eat things that aren't derivative of animals, we never even eat salads... we've never even seen gluton free things, or soy or alternative proteins. EVERYTHING we eat is filled with animal fat because of the way we cook things. So for you to be offended that the beans have pork in them seems like an absurdity to me, and of course... proof of your privileged first world entitlement. It is your job as someone with a strict diet to ask before you buy. The reason why those \"ingredients\" are not listed in the menu is because every single thing we cook has at least 20 ingredients in them and animal fat is as common as salt in your food. Learn before you buy, be careful of the things you say, don't expect the world to cater to you. If you don't like it, then chances are Puerto Rican food is not for you.\n\nAgain, best place ever. I lived too many years without good decent Caribbean food in this city until this restaurant came to be. Now I can have a piece of home with me in this great city :)", "author": "Alex P."}

In fact, EXCELLENT may be and understatement!!! I felt like I was in my family's kitchen eating authentic food.  This place definitely is AUTHENTIC PR food!!!\n\nI ordered the vegetarian plate which consisted of salad, rice and beans (I decided to order spanish rice with red beans. They also have the option of white rice and white beans), platano maduro and yucca.  It was nothing short of FABULOUS!!!!  My friend ordered the bifstek plate which was the same except she had beef.  We also ordered an extra side of platano maduros because who could only eat a few :)\n\nI came here on 10/1 for dinner.  My bday is on 10/4 and so my eating celebration was continuing :)  \n\nThe place had excellent decor with art work and family portraits all over.  They also had cool table ornaments of cans w/the utensils in them which I thought was totally cool.  It's in an excellent location in the heart of the height.  It's definitely a hole in the wall with not much seating at all but those are always the diamonds in the rough!!!\n\nI bet you're wondering if everything was so great, why the one star!?!? I'll tell you why!!!  The owner or manager of the place was clearly not of the latin decent.  She did not not speak any Spanish.  She was the one managing the register as well as taking the orders and bring out the food.  After arriving at 8pm we were seated quickly but shortly after the rush came in!!!  There were 2 people in the back cooking.  An older heavy set Spanish woman and a Spanish male.  I guess with all craziness going on, the manager (for lack of better words) had her come to the front to pass out the beverages and wipe the table down.  As the older lady came to our table to refill our water, I asked her if she was the one who cooked the dinner.  She indicated to me that she did not speak English.  Being that I am Dominican, I instantly spoke to her in Spanish and she was much more at ease.  I told her the food was great and that she did a good job.  Once my friend and I finished our food, paid our bill, we began to leave the place and we said thank you to the manager (a Caucasian girl I would say in her late 20s to early 30s).  Both my friend and I said thank you and we were at complete shock that she did not even acknowledge us, yet rushed passed us to serve another patron.  We thought that was odd so we just continued to put on our jackets and in the middle of the restaurant she proceeded to call the spanish lady stupid and slow to the customer.  I was APPALLED!!!!!!! I looked at my friend and we were both at a loss of words because I could not believe she would utter those words to another customer and out loud for every one to hear.\n\nFor that ladies and gentlemen, I will NEVER go back to this place.  I will not support an environment who speaks to their workers like that.  The poor lady had no clue because she did not speak English.\n\nParada 22 my advice to you is:\n***Either you find someone to man the floor who speaks Spanish and can converse with the workers or\n***Hire a translator\n\nEither way....that manager/person/who the hell that was, should be fired and no one should eat here!!!!!!!!!!!!", "author": "Sandra S."}

I had the Camarones a la Criolla, which I must admit is a delicious plate but not remotely close to anything you'll find in Puerto Rico.\n\nI've been to Parada 22 at least 4 times. The Pernil Asado and Yuca al Mojo are about the most authentic things you will find in the menu. Amarillos are good too, but come on, it's nearly impossible to get those wrong. To be able to call yourself a Puertorican restaurant there are 2 main dishes you absolutely need: Mofongo and Tostones. This is my main disappointment with Parada 22. I came in expecting at least one of those 2, maybe even some Medalla. Instead I found an americanized or cuban/puertorican infusion menu with mexican beers.\n\nIf one goes in to eat good food without thinking of its region, then I definitely recommend it - it is delicious. To those familiar with Puertorican cuisine, there's a LOT of room for improvement.", "author": "Ruben R."}

It used to be like, \"Oh, I want Parada 22.. oh wait, I don't have any cash, uggh..\". Now there's no restriction!\n\nAlso, to all who were saying they don't have Mofongo, well.. they have it now! I had no idea what it was when I went in, the lady suggested it. The description sounded good, so I ordered it... MAN it was so delicious! Stomach is growling right now just thinking about it.

The joint's got high ceilings and the walls are adorned with all kinds of memorabilia from Puerto Rico; food, photographs, decoration and such. There's even an old school, black and white television showing old Puerto Rican flix. Big plus for the interior. The waitress was really cool and helpful. In fact, the first time I went there we was chatting it up. That's always a plus for me.\n\nI've been to Parada 22 twice already and both experiences have been quite enjoyable for my tummy. I really dig the Pernil Asado, roasted leg of pork marinated nicely in a garlic and oregano based sofrito. All the main dishes come with Puerto Rican rice, red OR white beans, maduros and some greens. Believe me, it hit's the spot coz the portion is perfect. Not too much and never too skimpy. I've also tried the Biftec Encebollado and the Chicken Encebollado which is steak or chicken with caramelized onions. Their sandwiches are hella good too. I had the Classic Cubano, roast pork, sweet ham, pickles, mustard and swiss cheese. Oooooh weeeee.\n\nI always \"big-up\" the chef when I leave because, like I said, the food is real good and your order's usually come pretty quick. And if you're one of them particular types, you can actually see him cook because there isn't a wall separating the kitchen from the dining area.\n\nI'm coming back to try dessert next time coz I never have room for it.", "author": "Ivan F."}

But Parada 22 captures the essential flavors that make Puertorrican food distinguishable and unique. Their food is surprisingly good!!\n\nThe place feels like a \"colmadito\" or small store back on the island.

So, I was hoping that Parada 22 would be able to satisfy my craving for maduros without me having to drive anywhere.\n\nFirst, I have to say, that it was my mistake to assume Parada 22 was strictly Puerto Rican; they incorporate flavors and dishes from all over Latin America.\n\nSecondly, I was weary because the place was completely empty when I walked in (granted, it was 4:30pm, and nobody really eats at that hour).\n\nThe decor is very colorful and bright, the walls are covered in Cuban and other Latin memorabilia. The vibrant shelves are lined with a wide variety of vintage products, reminding me of home (sigh). I was a bit confused though, under the assumption that it was more \"street food\" and that seating was not to be expected. I got a completely different experience, I asked the server if she takes our order at the table or if we're required to order up at the counter...she seemed confused about this too and replied \"whatever you want to do...\"\n\nMust-try on the menu:\nCitrus - mint beverage: an in-house concoction of citrus juices mixed with mint and ginger. Great refreshing drink (non-alcoholic) for what was definitely the hottest day of the year in SF!\n\nSpanish rice - great flavors on it's own; BUT you should definitely follow my lead and pair with...\n\nHabichuelas coloradas - homemade red beans that are spiced to perfection. You get a mean red beans and rice combo that satisfies anyone's comfort-food-button.\n\nYuca y Aguacate al mojo - a rather large salad with cassava and avocado that is lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, atop greens that have been tossed in a garlic and onion vinaigrette.", "author": "Alyssa G."}

From the abyss of my brain I remembered reading an article about a Puerto Rican restaurant in the Upper Haight, so I wandered amongst the bong stores and crowded sidewalks until I found Parada 22.  \n\nI walk in and everything felt right, the music, the Goya Products on the wall, the Cafe Bustelo which spoke of mi abuela- and then I get ready to order. I am already salivating and happy to eat some good soul food; this Jew-Yorican knows that keeping my Borinquen half happy is hard in this city and any chance to eat some Puerto Rocking food is a chance taken.  I asked the woman behind the counter- \"You don't happen to make mofongo do you?\"  She looked at me like I had two heads.\n\n\"Mo, what?\"\n\n\"Mofongo.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Mofo- ah, nevermind. You're not Puerto Rican are you....\"\n\nI ordered some pollo frito- which was passable, and some maduros (sweet plantains) which were not maduro enough, and some rice and beans- which were great.  \n\nI will be the first to admit, that for Puerto Rican food, I am a hard judge- this would pretty much be the exact meal that I would eat if it were my last (made by moms of course)- so my standards are exacting.  What elevated the meal was the beans.  Seriously, they nailed the beans. Without the beans I would never go back, and the beans are the hardest part!\n\nSo, what I would say is if you just want to try some Puerto Rican food or are homesick- Parada can come through in the clutch, just don't expect mofongo, and take it for what it is.  Next time I am really jonesing for something vaguely resembling food I grew up eating, I will head to Parada 22; if I don't make it at home.", "author": "seth s."}

After I saw a Scoutmob for it, I took the opportunity to check it out with my brother.\n\nThe place is, indeed, quite small.  You sit wherever is open if you're dining in, which could be at a small counter or in the corner.  Luckily for us, the big table was clear so we snagged 2 seats at the end.\n\nAs always, my bro and I ordered 2 entrees to split.  He got the pernil asado and I got the mofongo.  The mofongo was the clear winner of the two, since the pernil was on the dry side.  The pork had great flavor, but couldn't quite make up for it being overcooked.\n\nThe mofongo dish, on the other hand, was fantastic!  The shrimp w/ the onion/tomato/pepper cream sauce (camarones a la criolla) was divine and not too too heavy despite the cream.  The mofongo itself was also flavorful.  I've never had mofongo before, but if this is what it's always like I'll make sure to order it every time I eat PR food!\n\nMy spanish rice was mushy and a bit bland, but the white rice was fluffy and tasty.  The red beans were ok but not great, perhaps a litttle heavy on the tomatoes?\n\nService was a little slow, but when there's one person running the cash register, grabbing drinks, clearing tables, serving the food, and taking phone orders, that's expected.

What you do get (aside from authentic Puerto Rican food, more on that in a second) is a ramshackle Latin street corner vibe (the place is named after a street in San Juan), complete with scattered photos from the old country, and a huge glass cabinet stocked with bags of coffee, cigars and assorted canned goods.\n\nIt's mainly a take-out spot, but there are some benches you can crowd over, and there's also a small drawing table (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TlBFKt2N2eSEBpN-UZmDBw?select=8Z7Xrj3Va8G1aWV3TuK8gA) for the little people to doodle at while waiting for the order. \n\nI tried the Biftec Encebollado, which came with onions, white rice, a couple of plantains, and white beans. The Camarones were another hit at our table, served in a fresh tomato and pepper cream sauce. My friend Sig N (http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZrLjXdfDlmcTwhZ9zTryuQ) is partial to their sandwiches, for what that's worth! \n \nI hear there's a whole fried fish you can order -- not on the menu -- that you can only order for sit-down.

Cash only...let's just get that out of the way first since this city is kinda 50/50 on that. \n\nAfter raving about the food in SF last night to some folks from Texas I decided to try Parada 22 out for lunch today. Was assuming that someone in SF would know how to make pretty good Puerto Rican food. I'm pretty glad that I rarely work from home because I would probably have that pork plate more than twice a week if I did. \n\nSo the pork plate was great. I got the red beans and rice on the side,  a little salad with the perfect amount of vinaigrette, and some delicious fried plantains - $9.50. Everything was delicious. Don't expect fried carnitas though, (I love how spell check wants me to say \"carnival\" instead of \"carnitas\") cause you might be disappointed. A few pieces of the pork were a tiny bit dry, but that's only if I'm being really really picky, and trying to find something to complain about. \n\nLiz ordered the chicken salad - $8. It was also amazing, but again....if I'm trying to set expectations for you like the carnitas comment....it was all dark meat (which we love), so don't expect some all white meat TGIFriday's chicken salad. Again, the salad had the perfect amount of vinaigrette. \n\nThe small touches make all of the difference, and the fact that they had two pitchers of water (one with limes and one with lemons) was awesome. We did order drinks though, which were also AMAZING. The sweet tea was the perfect amount of sweet (unlike the ultra sweet tea at Baby Blues), and the lemonade was incredibly satisfying - $2 each.\n\nThis might be one of the longer reviews that I've written, but Parada 22 was pretty f'ing amazing, so it was well deserved.

I have family in Puerto Rico and my some of my family members are Puerto Rican (I am Asian) so I do know a thing or two about Puerto Rican food. As soon as I stepped in (with Puerto Rican music on full blast) I nearly balled like a baby as it made me miss Puerto Rico so much. But let's be real here... our reviews our based on food not decorations. We went for lunch on a Wednesday afternoon so it was quiet as we were the first ones there. Our waitress was super friendly. My boyfriend ordered their mofungo with chicken instead (i'm allergic to shrimp) and I ordered the grilled chicken with onions (pollo encebollado). We were surprised at how big their lunch portions were. It  came with a side of beans, salad, rice and plantains. Their plantains were cooked a lot better and even tasted better than Cha Cha Cha's. Both are of our lunches were good; my chicken was made just right and the caramelized onions really added some kick to it. My boyfriend said his mofungo was \"everything he dreamed and more.\" Their prices are very decent ($9 for the chicken and $12 for mofungo) considering how big their lunch portions are. We noticed that the table next to our devoured their food in a matter of minutes (which to me is a good sign). I am def. coming back next time and will be trying their desserts.", "author": "selina n."}

It's small, cute with all the decor and wall of canned/pkgd goods and clean. \n\nThe Biftec Encebollado was tough, and way too difficult to cut with just a butter knife on the table. The onions were nicely caramelized, but the meat lacked any substantial flavor. The spanish rice was good, I'd recommend getting that with your meal, and the salad was lightly dressed.\n\nThe cuban sandwich was just alright. The bread wasn't pressed down like a panini and the slices of pork were kinda dry and not thinly sliced, so that made it tough to bite without the sandwich falling apart on you. I've originally had a Cubano in Miami and that was off the hook!!

We were seated on stool chairs in the corner by the entrance at a makeshift table that was literally two connected two by fours protruding out of the wall.  There wasn't much of an assortment on the menu either.  There were no pasteles or arroz con gandules for starters.  Puerto Rican food is more than just a few entrees.  They more than likely do this to cut cost and promote efficiency, at the expense of an unknowing consumer.  It's apparent that the owner gets away with it in light of the mindset of those in the area that just don't know what good Puerto Rican food is really about. \n\nI won't return.  Instead, I'll give my business to Nueva Frutilandia, a place in the Mission district that is by far better in every respect and the complete opposite of the above stated.\n\nOne more thing:  The bistec encebollado was really tough and the beans looked more like lentils than the real pink beans used by Puerto Ricans.  The rice was acceptably so so.  The dishes overall were cold and there were no refills on the sweet tea.  The malta India was good, but then again what can one expect from something that's already bottled elsewhere.", "author": "John Q."}

The pernil had all the right flavors but I would have appreciated some of the roasted skin mixed in there (called cueritos) to give it that extra bit of fatty moisture. The yucca was outstanding.

I'm half Puerto Rican and grew up eating many homemade dishes and I think this place measures up. It's great that they have a sampler; I especially liked their amarillos, chicharron, and pernil asado. For my main dish I had chicken which was pretty good but not great (it is not on their main menu because it was a daily special but it was my first time ever having this PR dish so I don't know the name). I was very bummed out not to see arroz con gandules, pastelillos, or asopao on the menu, but hopefully they make it on there sometime. \n\nThe restaurant is small so I would not recommend for large groups but I did like the decor a lot and the service was great. \n\nOverall I think the food and ambiance were good but not quite great. But I am still very happy that there is a Puerto Rican restaurant in the city since they are extremely rare in the west coast!

Delicious and fresh dressing, crisp fresh lettuce, dressed just right. My man says the tostones are exactly like the ones his Ecuadorian father makes.

Secondly, after my boyfriend ate most of his meal, he found a short black hair in his chicharron. We really didn't want to make a big deal of it but I thought they should know. I noticed the cook wasn't wearing a hair net or anything. I told the waitress and she told us that they would not charge us for that meal. We weren't even expecting that but thought that would make up for it. Next thing I know, the other guy working, (I am assuming he's the manager or owner) came with the check, two small glasses of sangrias, and apologized for the hair in our food. I thought in addition to not charging us for the meal that he was going above and beyond by doing that gesture. Then I noticed that he did charg us for the meal that had the hair in it! I was shocked after being told we were not going to be charged for it. Needless to say, that was gross! I wanted to throw up for my boyfriend. I wondered if I had hair in my food too but just didn't see it. I hope that's not the case. The cook needs to wear a hair net!

The service was friendly, the decor cute, and the restroom very clean.  I had the vegetarian platter, which included yellow rice, white beans, yucca, salad, and plantains.

The food is great, reasonably priced, and the staff is friendly. Yaay! It's a good place to eat. They have COCONUT FLAN, which can only be properly eaten with a big a$$ spoon ;)\n\nI have tried the following: Biftec Encebollado, Mofongo, Maduros, the sampler, Pastelon, rum cake and coconut flan. All are pretty good. My favorite so far would have to be the Pastalon, which is like a lasagna with the pasta replaced with strips of fried plantain (I know what you may be thinking, I wouldn't have thought so too, but it's REALLY good). When you get the choice between the white rice and spanish rice take the spanish rice it's very flavorful. Also red beans over white beans (white beans are like listening to jazz whereas the red beans are a little bit rock and roll). The red beans have a little kick to them. A lot of the plates are prepared with plantains so keep that in mind if you're considering the maduros it would be redundant to order them and a dish prepared with plantains. For dessert go ahead try the coconut flan, it's sweet not eggy like other types of flan. Do it, do it, do it!!!\n\nFinally, the place itself is pretty interesting, lots of pictures on the walls, and drawings from kids that have visited. There are only a handful of tables and some seating on the side facing the wall. Sitting facing the wall turns out be a better move if you're on a date since you're less likely to be affected by the staff moving around while tending to the other tables which are crowded together.\n\nGreat place for a great meal under 30 bucks :)", "author": "Jose U."}

My grandfather was the cook in our family and when he past he took those secrets with him to the grave. My grandmother is a good cook too, but is older and a little forgetful, so when I am craving Puerto Rican food I ask my mom, but she doesn't cook it that often so sometimes I'm SOL.  \n\nSo today I wanted Puerto Rican food was close to the Haight and thought I'd give it a try, and sorry to say it was Blah!  I had the Pernil Adoba with white rice and beans. Pernil (pork shoulder) is suppose to be so soft that you can cut it with a fork and it is suppose to have the cracklin on top. This was a tough piece of meat. I could taste the seasoning and that was good, if the meat had been a little softer it would have been great. My favorite part of the meal was the sweet tea and the boiled yucca and avocado salad.  That was fantastic. All the salad needed was a few more tomatoes and salted cod (bacalao).  That is how my grandpa made it and it is to die for.  \n\nIf I was in the neighborhood I might go for the tea and salad.  But would make the trip from SSF to here for the food.

The waitress was very friendly and quickly traded my red beans for white beans. \nThe restaurants itself is cute, bright and fun, but very small; I'd definitely not recommend it for a group of four or more. \nI came here because I received a scoutmob deal and yet I was still charged full price because the waitress who took note of my deal wasn't the same one who ran my card...annoying. Still, once I brought it to their attention the waitress who ran my card was apologetic and showed me proof that she had voided the transaction. However, 5 days have passed and the full amount is still posted on my account (I'll be following up with my bank shortly) In addition, my card was swiped again after I was charged the correct price factoring in my 50% off. \nOverall, my experience was decent and I might go back, but I'm not in a hurry to do so.", "author": "Natalie M."}

I blame this on the fake hippies bums that like to poop on the streets ugh specifically in the bushes in front of my house. Anyway, I always order the pernil (roast pork) with their yellow rice and white beans. My bf prefers the red beans but I think the white is more flavorful. Along with this comes a nice mixed greens salad with a simple tangy dressing. I also order the avocado, yuca salad which is soooo freaking good. I love yuca and avocado and they have their amazing dressing over it so it just works out really well. My bf gets the steak plate which is also good but I'm just a pork lover so I never sway. It's similar to Sol food in San Rafael, except Sol food is a lot better. Thats not saying that parada is bad its just that Sol food is AMAZING. Anyway, my one complaint is that since its a small place and we literally live a block away their take home portions have been getting pretty skimp.

This may be an understatement, as we were indeed blessed by these food angels to discover Parada 22 - the palace of delicious Puerto Rican cuisine, only because the Host with the Leastest at ChaChaCha was so darn rude when we ventured there first.  Aha! I exclaimed, I am taking this rude \"host\" situation as a sign to see what other restaurant is closeby. \n\nImmediately I yelped - lo and behold Parada 22 was right next door and though we saw they were crowded, with only 1 very busy waitress and 1 busier chef,  we entered.  We, 3,  shared one of the long tables with a family of 6, who were quite friendly.  We ordered two entrees of pastalone... because it seemed so different and we, 3, adventurous.  Wow! Pastalone is, in a nutshell, a puerto rican lasagna, the unusual combination of bananas, ground beef, olives, raisins... and more - i'll get the recipe perhaps later.  Even BF who is the most picky of eaters, wolfed it down with PR rice and beans!  Also ordered - yucca with onions - good!  We topped off our meals with flan - they were out of the coconut, so we got the plain - which we all decided was the best flan ever!  The busy waitress was friendly and accommodating throughout the evening, she took orders, bussed tables, served tables, delivered menus and checks, and took money, with a smile and efficiency.  The chef only looked up long enough to acknowledge his waitress and the thanks of the many happy patrons.

After we left I discovered that I had left my hat and glasses ($200.00 prescription) behind and ran back to the restaurant to retrieve them.  The manager, however, claimed she did not have them so we left and decided to check back with the restaurant in a few days to see if anyone returned them.  Lo and behold somebody did and the manager told me she'd leave them for me under the counter by the cash register.  A few days went by and I finally had a chance to swing by to pick the items up but decided to call first to make sure they hadn't been put away in a secure area for safe keeping.  The person who I spoke to informed me that the glasses and hat were not there and after checking with the manager informed me that \"I should have come by the day they were returned\".  I asked her if they had perhaps been put away in a secure area, maybe the cleaning people had moved them etc.. but was instead told that \"maybe I should check back again in a few days\"??? \nThe manager did call me back the following day and was told that she would check around and get back to me but I never heard back.  I asked her if it was common for people to steal things from behind the counter and she stated she didn't think so....\nI've dealt with a lot of flakes in my life but the management of this restaurant took the cake.  So I should have returned back to the restaurant the same night my hat and glasses were returned to ensure they didn't disappear again?\nVery bizarre experience indeed.", "author": "Shaki S."}

I'm Puerto Rican by the way.  And I'll start by saying most people should find something to enjoy here since it is different than the usual and not bad tasting food.  \n\nIt's basic and as simple as it gets.  I had the Pernil with white rice and red beans and maduros (sweet plantains) and it was average.  Pernil should be a juicy, stripped, and full of taste.  Mine was in huge chunks, dry and pretty bland.  The rice was fine but it's white so can't go wrong and the beans were good.  Maduros were also good but that's also hard to mess up.  Could've been less soggy and more crispy but they're made a lot of diff ways.  \n\nNo traditional Puerto Rican drinks or sodas which kind of sucks.  I had a bit of the Pollo encebollado and it was also average.  Just chicken and onions.  Didn't have the hint of specific Puerto Rican spices but it was fine. \n\nThe menus is limited and didn't even have Arroz con Gandules, which is arguably THE most popular Puerto Rican dish.  Hard to make right though.  Kind of like paella.  \n\n2 stars just because they didn't have a key dish or any traditional drinks.  Sangria is a generic cheap cop out for any latin restaurant if you ask me.  But I do think people can enjoy it as a cool little change up to the abundance of mexican/asian restaurants in the SF.   El Nuevo Frutilandia is better I think.  Not as cute in decoration but more authentic in taste.

So when we hear that one has opened up we RUN!!! to it in hopes of savoring some real down home cooking. So it was a little disappointing when I went to Parada 22 for my birthday Dinner with friends. There was absolutely no Puerto Ricans running or working in this restaurant and the decor although primarily Puerto Rican Themed had Yerba Mate on display & an old newspaper framed with headlines of Cuba, Cholula Hot Sauce & Mexican beer. One of the bigger disappointments was that they did not serve Tostones or Malta, which is as basic traditional everyday Puerto Rican Cuisine as you can get. Don't get me wrong, the service was good, food was OK, and it's not bad for a quick inexpensive meal, the place was clean and green in many ways. But Puerto Rican Cuisine ... not really \n\nThe Rum Cake was absolutely DELICIOUS, the Cubano Sandwich was alright & although the Pernil was fall apart soft ,it lacked the flavor of traditional seasonings. It was kind-of down hill after that. Yes rice can be difficult to master, but you had to search for the gandules & flavor in this rice, and granted the habichuelas had pieces of ham & potatoes, they also were missing something. The yucca tasted minty rather than garlicky and was over cooked, more like mashed potatoes. The chicharon de pollo was not, it was basically just a quartered fried chicken. The Bifstek Encebollado was delicious, but again not the taste of Puerto Rican cuisine, it lacked the Puerto Rican trademark vinegar marinade and the onions were really carmelized(not how we cook them).", "author": "I R."}

Bright colors, a glass hutch with cans and boxes of Puerto Rican food products, and exposed brick made this place look very appealing to me.  Also, it's around the corner from my house.  It had a lot going for it....\n\nHere's the rub:  the food was TERRIBLE.  A friend and I went for dinner about a month ago on a weeknight and we arrived around 9:00 pm.  I had the vegetarian combo. platter.  First of all, they were OUT of rice.  HOW can a Puerto Rican establishment be OUT of rice?  Isn't that a staple?  The platanos were very greasy and the yucca was gummy and congealed in a gelatinous-like substance that I presume to be the sauce.  I didn't want one of the items on the platter, and the folks had kindly agreed to substitute avocado, but instead they put extra platanos on the plate instead of just telling me they were out of avocado as well.  Finally, the beans just weren't good - the sauce was not particularly flavorful and the consistency was not right.  My friend, who had one of the meat dishes, concurred about the terrible quality of her food as well.  To enhance the experience even more, the waitress was downright surly, and she was obviously counting down the minutes until her shift was over.  She was neither helpful nor polite.  \n\nI am not one of those people who lives to write negative reviews nor am I a very harsh critic.  I can overlook a lot of issues.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-22", "description": "I really wanted to give Parada 22 five stars, but you know in movies how you always hear the saying, \"There's good news and there's bad news... Which one do you want to hear first?\" Well let's begin with the good news...\n\nI absolutely loved the food. I've watched a whole lot of Anthony Bourdain, Andrew Zimmerman and Adam Richman and every time one of those hosts visited Puerto Rico, I always heard them speak of \"mofongo\"-- some mashed plantain dish mixed with garlic, shrimp and more. I was sold the moment I got a glimpse of this mofongo on television and since then, I've been on a mofongo hunt. Sadly, I don't have any Puerto Rican friends who know how to whip up some mofongo (as a matter fact, I asked my Puerto Rican friend once and he gave me the raised eyebrow) and sadly I never even heard of a Puerto Rican restaurant in the city, despite the many times I've searched it on Yelp. The nearest I'd always get was one in San Rafael and I just couldn't seem to bring myself that far to try the long awaited mofongo.\n\nAnyway, long story short, my friend told me about Parada 22 and I was there ASAP. I ordered the mofongo and almost cried at the sight of such a beautiful dish. Everything about it was DIVINE. I don't even remember what else was served with it... some sort of shrimp, rice, beans... a whole platter to feed a fat little man like me! So I was happy. Probably the happiest I'd been all week until....\n\nHere's the bad news. And I'm talking about super bad news. The only thing in this world that can make a happy camper like me go sour over food would be... THE SIGHT OF A HAIR IN MY FOOD. Yes, sadly there was a black hair in my mofongo (I just did the gag reflex as I remembered that very moment) I know it wasn't my hair because it was buried deep in my mofongo. I'm talmbout I saw the tip peeking from the corner and when I pulled it out, it disrupted the beautiful mofogan hill and exposed the entire body of hair upon that pile of disrupted plantain. I tossed the hair on the floor and gag reflexed over and over. I didn't tell my two friends what I had seen only because... I just couldn't, but they knew something was wrong by the reaction on my face. You know how they say love is blind? Well I suppose hunger is blind, too. The food was so damn good, but it doesn't excuse me from complaining. I regret not complaining. I ended up eating more of my food, but did not touch the rest of my mofongo for the rest of my sitting.\n\nI'm really disappointed that had to happen to me, but some things like that aren't controllable. I plan on eating here sometime again, but I'm still slightly traumatized from that last time....", "author": "Ally C."}

I'm always looking for new places to eat because, to be brutally honest, I feel like the restaurants in the upper Haight lack a certain level of \"excellence\" so to speak.\n\nThis place was pretty good, I have to say.  My husband has been there a few times and always gotten one of the cuban sandwiches.  He likes them a lot, so we thought we'd try the place out for dinner.  He went with his tried and true \"classic cubano\" and was quite happy.  I got the roasted pork main dish and it was........good.......\nMy pork was only luke-warm so I asked the waitress if it was suppose to be that way.  She really didn't answer me, but offered to bring me another order of pork so I thought, well, hell yeah, giddy up!\nIt was still only luke-wark so, I'm guessing its the way it is suppose to be??\nThe white beans were out of this world good and the spanish rice was pretty good.

The chicken on the other hand was surprisingly good, not over cooked, but just right.  The salad I really did enjoy, a nice light dressing was ultra flavorful and very crisp.

I've only ever had the steak sandwich there and my friends have eaten the other sandwiches and left the place satisfied. I spied on the other dishes the other guests were eating and everyone seemed to be satisfied. My first puerto rican food experience was very positive and I'd definitely open up the door to this quaint and cute little restaurant a second time. It fits the neighborhood well, it's a cute, romantic, hipster hole in the wall. The restaurant probably won't do a good job of accommodating a large group, but will do great for intimate settings.

I mean it's 4 hours since I left and I am still full.  My friend had the Mofongo de Camarones and I had the Chicharrones de Pollo. Both were yummy and the portions were big with salad, plantains, your choice of  white or red beans (the secret behind J. Lo's badonkadonk maybe?) and rice (white or Spanish)! Charming decor abounds in this cozy and warm establishment, the kid sister restaurant of Cha Cha Cha just 8 paces down the block. Give Parada 22 a try--- it's a great place for meeting a friend, a cute date after a walk in the park, or a family dinner. Build a good appetite before coming because you get your fill.

My partner had the pork, which was better than the chicken. We also ordered an extra salad, because I wanted to try the dressing, but I think it was the same salad that was on my plate. \n\nWe will definitely go back - but I might just order rice and beans and a salad next time (I don't eat red meat or cheese and there are not a whole lot of other options there, such as alternate chicken dishes), and I think it would be more than enough. \n\nThanks Parada 22 for opening in the Haight!", "author": "Mara K."}

I mean just plain nasty. Drinks were in paper cups...WTF?  They had tostones and no mojito to dip it in (contrary to popular belief, mojito is NOT just a drink, it originally is a garlic dipping sauce). No one knew what I was talking about, but served up the minced garlic that you get in a jar from the supermarket..not a true mojito at all. Instead they served a mayonnaise/ketchup mixture that's supposed to be very puerto rican. NOT SO MUCH, My abuela would've slapped me had I served that! My friend asked for mofongo and it was made with shrimp..not the usual mofongo made with pork or beef..we didn't like it at all. For puerto-rican food, this was not good at all, and there wasn't a puerto rican in sight in the kitchen. Evidently the chef lives in PR and comes to train the cooks.  The only thing I liked were the beans. The roast pork (pernil) was not seasoned enough, the salad was limp. Ay Dios, don't waste your money.

The room is fine, but probably functions best as a place to pick up food-to-go, because it's small, loud, and offers only a few picnic tables for seating. The food is served on paper plates with the cheapest, flimsiest plastic utensils I've ever seen;  I've never understood how restaurant owners think they can cut corners that way without turning off the customers they need to make it in a tough business.  How much would it cost to provide real silverware to people who are eating in the shop?  The plastic junk they expect you to use to cut through not-inconsiderable chunks of pork seemed designed to frustrate would-be terrorists in the event of a hijacking.\n\nThat said, the food was delicious.  We tried the Cubano sandwich and the pernil, a roasted pork dish, along with orders of both red and white beans.  The sandwich was sublime -- smoky, sweet, and perfectly balanced, with slices of roast pork, ham, and Swiss cheese along with piquant mustard and pickles on a warm, sublimely textured, slightly crispy white bun.  It's instantly one of the best sandwiches in the city.  The pernil, in thick slices with a few shreds of caramelized onion, was slightly less impressive, being somewhat dry, a little stingy of portion, and not quite singing with garlic flavor. But it was good home-cooking style, and I would order it again.  It came with a couple of slices of fried maduro plantains, slightly crispy and caramelized, which were wonderful -- it might be worth ordering a whole side of those.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the beans.  The red ones were cooked with pork, the white beans with a vegetable/oregano sofrito, and both were exquisite: soft, savory, comforting, smoky-tasting.  Vegetarians should be very happy with an order of white beans, rice, and maduros (along with several other vegetable dishes we didn't order.)

With the exception of the bizcoche de ron (cake with a rum custard layer), it was nothing memorable.  Our server was extraordinarily friendly, and the place is beautifully decorated -- a lot of thought clearly went into the design -- but they are clearly having a lot of trouble drawing business and for the moment I presume they are relying on a trickle of people who get fed up waiting in line at Cha Cha Cha next door (same ownership group, I believe).  A place this nice deserves a better and more inventive menu; if they're going to stick with very simple comfort food and sandwiches, it needs a serious rethink.

If you want lighter fare, they have a long list of salads and the housemade vinaigrette is yummy.  I've heard that the eggplant sandwich is also highly recommended.  Don't be surprised if I become a regular.", "author": "Rochelle E."}

I love puerto rican food so i was already expecting to enjoy what they had. The pictures on yelp let me know it wasn't gonna be super fancy but nice. The food was great! Only problemas for the birthday boy and his mom were they were out of pork, so they instead for the shrimp dish and beef. The menu is small but considering had a good variety. The place is kinda small we got there around six on a sunday and it wasn't to crowded but the place was filled by the time we left.  I got the Yucca salad which was bigger than i expected and EXCELLENT. We shared a plate of sweet plantains which was our dessert. The other thing that I recommend is to not to sit by the door if you are at all sensitive to cigarette (or weed) smoke we had to ask them to close the door (it is Haight street, and there is a bar right next door) Once they closed the door it was all good. I would say its a slightly Americanized Puerto Rican good eat spot if your willing to spend a little extra cash.", "author": "W R."}

I had the bistec and carmelized onions with the Spanish rice and red beans.  Definitely recommend this dish.  We also shared the sampler platter, everything was delicious, especially the yucca.  Try the flan it melts in your mouth.  The service was good too, very attentive.  Can't wait to go back.", "author": "Mariel G."}

Had the pernil asado which could feed 2.  The plantains were prepared well, golden color.  Also had the plantain chips (YUM!) and yuca (tasty garlic sauce).  Very affordable.  Want to come back for the chicken wings.", "author": "win c."}

Also went there in the evening and had the biftek. It was like a homecooked meal! The sangria was very good, too. It is tiny so you need to be patient about close quarters.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

Of course, it's Puerto Rican food but not exactly knowing what that means, I went in with excitement at eating something new and refreshing. We shared our meals which is always my favorite way to go! The Pernil Asado, roasted pork, was tender and tasty, not spicy at all. Came with baked plantains, red beans and yellow rice. I'm not always a big fan of beans as they just seem so \"beanie\" but these were wonderful. Very tender, tasty, and larger than pinto or black beans. The plaintains were like dessert.  We shared the Berenjena, grill eggplant sandwich with a cream cilanto-garlic jack cheese. It was like a pannini and very tasty. Sorry to keep using with word tasty but my mind is rather tired and not able to branch out much these days! We ordered the Yuca Al Mojo, the cassava or juka root, which came out like mashed potatos. They were yummy (tried to avoid tasty), giving you that little bit of starch but in a way that made you feel like you were eating healthy and natural. What a fun place to go. Not real big in terms of seating but we sure saw lots of people coming in and getting food to go. Will definitely go back here!!", "author": "P G."}
