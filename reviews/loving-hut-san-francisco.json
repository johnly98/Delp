I ate here two days in a row due to the fact that it was a convenient vegan spot as I has a conference in the Westfield. \n\nThe food options are pretty good - sandwiches, apps, soup, hot entree options, even lots of dessert options!\n\nThe first day I ordered white rice with eggplant, noodles, and lemongrass tofu. It was all pretty good but the eggplant was just ehh to me but overall good. Nothing amazing but good. If you read my other reviews, you might notice by now that I love eggplant dishes lol.\n\nThe second day I ordered spicy pho and it was okay. It could've been better in terms or flavor but it wasn't awful. I still ate the whole dish lol. \n\nEverything was overpriced, probably because it's in downtown SF, but literally it was way too expensive for what you get. Also, their customer service is not great. They rush you and barely let you finish talking as you try to explain your order. Sure, it's busy, but relax...they stress themselves out more than we stress them out. I felt overwhelmed and flustered because they were in such a rush - I felt like I was running out of time or something. \n\nGranted, it's a food court...expectations aren't exactly high to begin with. Food is good, I'd go again if I have to be in the area and can't make it in time anywhere else outside of Westfield Mall. Also, I love supporting vegan companies. However, if I can spend less or the same somewhere else with better service and more bang for my buck, I most definitely will.", "author": "Gjenes B."}

I was really glad to have an inexpensive food option accessible even before leaving the BART area!  \n\nLoving hut has some nice options.  And, I always love a restaurant where I don't have to ask many questions because everything on the menu is vegan.  \n\nI had a meal with two sides.  I chose fried rice, mushrooms, and potato curry.  For a lower scale vegan experience, the seasoning was to be expected; nothing extravagant or new to my taste buds.  The food was not too greasy or oily.  And the portion size was generous for $10.50.  Next time, I need to try the vegan cheese cake.  Yes.  There is such a thing as vegan cheese cake.  It looked great!  And, yesterday was a bit of a food marathon, so I opted for no dessert :)\n\nMy helping critique for this place would be to better distinguish where the line should be.

Food tase was excellent and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Altogether spent around $45 for 3 people plus two kids. \n\nThe downside was the customer service. The counter lady was unfriendly. When we asked for extra empty plate she was so hesitant and did not want to give it. I have to ask her couple of times and she was staring at me. My friend asked for paper napkins and the lady was unwilling to give it either, she gave only a couple of them for 5 of us. I had to go to another food stall and get paper napkins. The other stall had it outside the counter so anybody can take it. I am not sure why these, Loving Hut, lady was hesitant to give extra paper plates and even reasonable quantity of paper napkins.

Anybody (not really, but still...) can produce an amazing plate of food for buckets of cash.  It's a sliding scale.\n\nCase in point, my 5-star rating for Loving Hut.  Yes, it's a food court.  Yes, the food is pre-made.  And yes, for $10.80 their veggie dishes are SPECTACULAR.\n\nThe eggplant teriyaki could be arranged on a pricey plate with half the serving you'll get here, and be sold for 2x the price.  Veggie fried rice is pretty great, but then it's just rice...ooh but it's gooooood!  The grilled veg is sauces to perfection, and they're very liberal with both portions and special requests.\n\nAnd for those of you reading from outside of San Francisco's epicentre and are doubting my view of VFM, let me put this in terms that'll make more sense...this is like finding a Chipotle-quality burrito for only $5!\n\nAlas, it's still a food court, so be aware - customer service is not included in this rating beyond speed and basically not being a d**k to customers.

It's Californian, hipster, and not particularly authentic, but the flavors and the concept I can really get behind! For lunch, I ordered the garden vermicelli bowl, which came with vermicelli noodles, lettuce, bean sprouts, crushed peanuts, fried spring rolls, and a chewy soy protein in dark sauce that was supposed to mimic a beef stir-fry. The fish sauce on the side wasn't particularly pungent or flavorful, but overall, this combination made for a nice dish of chewy, crunchy, and soft textures along with sweet, savory, and refreshing flavors. Complaints? The service was incredibly slow and I had to wait an eternity for my food (that being said, they do have a steam table of ready-to-go curries and stir-fries), and the price definitely wasn't particularly cheap for what you get.", "author": "David K."}

The ramen was yummy and very big. I'm kind of a ramen snob, so I can definitely say I've had better. Nonetheless the \"meat\" on top truly had a pork texture - which freaked me out. It's great how pink and significantly similar the texture was to ham I ate a couple years ago. The noodles were plentiful and I was happy that the amount of veggies on top were to my liking.\n\nThe fried rolls were good, but I didn't care all that much for the dipping sauce. I would rather a fresh roll or something else to pair.\n\nAll in all, I wasn't impressed nor disappointed with my meal. I've had both better and worse vegan options All the soy deters me, I would like to see some seitan or other meat textures used as alternatives. \n\nThere's a location near me in Sac that I want to try dining in and seeing how experience compares.

It's a shopping mall, so the set up was very different from what I'm accustomed. \n\nImmediately noticeable is the buffet-style set up (similar to Panda Express) showing most of their available items. There was mostly tofu, which I try to avoid, so I was initially disappointed. Then I noticed the menu board above; it was still very limited (compared to the LH restaurants) but there were soy protein options, which I prefer over tofu. \n\nI ordered the Queen Sandwich -$9.50. It came with soy protein, marinated in a caramelized sauce, vegan mayo and lettuce (I omitted the cucumbers and tomatoes).  It also came with small salad mix.  It was tasty and filling. \n\nThey had a tempting dessert case, which included 3 different cheesecakes.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to try any this time...

It was Friday, February 12th around 6:30pm.\n\nAfter looking through a bunch of pix on Yelp, I decided to get the Garden vermicelli ($9.95): noodle, lettuce, bean sprout, cucumber, herbs, fried rolls & grilled soy protein. I wanted to try their golden rolls anyways, so I figured this would be perfect. I wasn't sure what to expect as I don't really recall ever eating faux meat in the past. I was pleasantly surprised. The ingredients were fresh. The grilled soy actually fulfilled my red meat craving. It's not quite as savory and beefy, but it does the trick. Their sauce (I believe it's supposed to resemble nuac cham?) could have used a little more flavor. I like mine a little fishier. Added some sambal to give it a little kick.\n\nThey also have some (stir fried?) dishes displayed just like some fast takeout Asian restaurants. (Panda Express comes to mind.) That day, they were offering:\n\n*Vegetable chowmein\n*Fried rice\n*Spicy green beans\n*Basil mushrooms \n*Sweet potato curry\n*Organic tofu with eggplant\n*Red curry with vegetables \n*Sweet & sour savor\n*Steamed kale\n*Organic lemongrass tofu\n\nYou can get a one or two item combo.

I ordered my food (an order of fresh rolls with peanut sauce) with a female employee who asked if I wanted it here or to go. \"To go\", I said, and proceeded down towards the cash register. Upon arrival at the register, my order was found set upon a plain paper plate, placed there by the same employee who took my order. What happened to \"to go?\". I kindly (I felt, at least) corrected the woman at the register that my order was to go, to which this new lady looked very confused, annoyed, lost even.  She finally and unceremoniously tossed me a small Chinese take out box to package my rolls in, but, from looking at the contents of the plate relative to the box one would have (should have?) thought the observation would have clicked on her brain's \"this is not big enough\" button. But, alas, it did not. Apparently the whole stack of clamshell boxes sitting next to the stack of paper plates was invisible. Fine, whatever, I shrugged, but then motioned that there was also a plastic cup of peanut sauce that would require a lid. With the second lady lost and unmoving, again, the first woman took notice and, annoyed at my continued presence, shoved a lid in my direction.\n\nRoll eyes. I shuffled away to the side. The toss and shove was to be interpreted  as \"OK then, if you want it to go, then you package it yourself.\" Had my hands been clean (vs post shopping and touching random things) this would have been fine... but they weren't, so it wasn't. Nonetheless I had to oblige and proceeded to confirm my initial thoughts that, nope, the contents weren't going to fit. And/or, rather, I wasn't about to forcefully shove everything into the box so as to have the rolls' rice paper stick all into each other. Frustrated, I went back to the counter and showed them how the box wasn't big enough. I requested the larger clamshell container. This was met by glares from both women and their refusal -- I had a plate, after all, and a box already! Upon my refusal to leave, they angrily grabbed my little box of food away, said something not in English to themselves (while I can speak another language too, I would not choose to use it to talk behind others' back, especially in a business/customer-facing setting). In the shadows of their food preparation counter, they took out the peanut sauce container that I had not wanted to carry outside the box, closed it, and handed me everything with the peanut sauce container on top of the box. Sigh... if I was OK with carrying the sauce outside, then I wouldn't have intentionally put it inside the container -- I guess that my action was not obvious enough. I explained that I hadn't wanted to carry the peanut sauce outside (lest, I could have placed it outside too and been done with it, Einsteins), but as I still had to travel far before I could eat the food, it was an undesirable option. To that, they said you can pay 10 cents for a bag, and to that, I said no and left.\n\n\nLoving Hut, you profess to be borne out of peace, love, and harmony... your employees at this location, at least today, do not seem to be practicing what you preach. For your desire to not listen to your customers' orders well enough in the first place, and then to save a paper plate and not give up a clamshell box, you have lost a repeat customer.

Although a little\nskeptical, my post-flight craving for a pile of veggies lead me in Loving Hut's direction. \n\nThis restaurant is one of many located on the lower level of Westfield mall. They offer Asian-inspired vegan eats--a few salads, sandwiches, and hot options that you can use to create a combo. I opted for a plate of steamed kale, eggplant with tofu, and spicy green beans. The plate was satisfying and definitely beat an order of Kung Pao chicken, though still tasted pretty \"mall food court\" if you ask me. \n\nWord to the wise: if you avoid soy in any way, steer clear of this restaurant.

The food is great, well flavored, and priced right. \n\nWhile my tastes have changed over the years and I've strayed away from fake meat products, I was surprised at how well balanced the vermicelli dish was with the noodles, seitan, peanuts, sauce, spring rolls, etc. Essentially, throughout the day I described this dish as a spring roll in a bowl (with fried rolls on top). It was so good and light...I didn't feel like I was going to fall asleep at my desk at work afterwards, huge plus! Highly recommended as an excellent, decently priced lunch option.\n\nBelow is my original Happy Cow review posted on 09/15/2010 (HC is an excellent resource when looking for vegan places around the world):\n\nPosted on 09 / 15 / 2010\nThis location is situated in the food court of the popular Westfield San Francisco Shopping Centre. Normally I wouldn't be jumping up an down about food court restaurants, but I'm surely jumping up and down about this one. First thing, this is a great place to go to if you're traveling with someone that is not veg*n, as there are plenty of great choices for them within the food court and there are actually good options. This food court is also connected to the BART stop at Powell, so if you're coming in on the subway, walk on in.\n\nAs always, the employees at Loving Hut were very nice. One thing I noticed is that they didn't have the TV's broadcasting things from their religion/beliefs - although I don't have a problem with their TV station, I often have a hard time getting some friends to go to their restaurants because of it. The location is very clean, cute, and inviting as well and there were many people ordering food from here (a very good sign). I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak and absolutely fell in love - I'm not sure if I loved it so much because I hadn't eaten for over 14 hours, but wow! The sandwich itself was very flavorful, they even had a garlic flavoring on the bread, the flavor of the sauce was very well done, and the seitan was tasty and had a great texture. The sandwich also came with a side of cole slaw (very good) and two slices of orange. Overall, this place is great and I will surely be eating here at least one more time before I leave - this is also the train stop that goes back to the airport.", "author": "Christina M."}

I literally stopped mid-sentence when I realized the gravity of that statement. Yes, it's that good.\n\nYeah, it's vegan so obviously the soy protein beef isn't the exact same, but it's pretty damn close.

The noodles were standard so were the mushroom, tofu, and bean sprouts. The soy protein was interesting. I could've done with or without it. As for the broth, it gave me stomach pains.

It is definitely overpriced. \n\nI got the avocado smoothie, coconut noodles, vermicelli, cheesecake, and green tea. They overloaded the green tea cup with so much ice that my sister only got a few sips from it. It was pretty disappointing considering that our total came out to almost $40. The avocado smoothie was really bland. One would expect it to be a bit more tasteful than just tasting like straight avocado, but it really seemed like I was just drinking blended avocado with a little bit of sugar. I know that you may think,\"Well, what were you thinking.. You got an avocado smoothie!\" I thought it would be a bit more delightful and this is a personal opinion. I am a great fan of avocados, just not of this smoothie. \n\nThe vermicelli was amazing. I would eat it every day. This dish rates 5+ stars. Tastes like real meat. (Yes, I'm an omnivore. Don't kill me.)\n\nThe cheesecake was bland and tasteless. Would not order again. And to clue you in, I am not a fan of super sweet desserts, so me saying that it is bland should tell you something. I mean, I eat bowls of white rice unseasoned and celery raw. I like bland. Bland actually has my last name in it. (Lan is my last name.)\n\nMy sister got the coconut noodles and hated it. That's saying a lot for her because she hates wasting food but she did not finish it. Even her garbage disposal boyfriend didn't finish it.\n\nAll in all, this is a review coming from omnivores. Perhaps it's because our taste buds have been tainted and destroyed by meat. Perhaps we have not been eating enough GMO, grass-fed, organic, gluten-free products to build a loving for Loving Hut, but we did not enjoy 80% of our order here on our first try. The second time I went back, I actually forgot that I had already ordered the avocado smoothie before and didn't like it and made the same mistake again, then was WTF-ing myself all the way back to my sister's apartment.

After my initial disappointment that their name didn't signify that they sold aphrodisiacs and contraceptives, I tried to get over it and regale in the fact that it was a plant-based eatery smack in the middle of the Westfield Food Emporium. I've been trying to be very good about my diet only going out to places that provide vegetarian options. What I'm discovering is that just because a place serves veg-heads doesn't mean taste gets thrown out the window. Witness places like Gracias Madre and Thai Idea, restaurants that have figured out how to serve food you actually want to eat again. Sadly the Loving Hut is not in that camp.\n\nThe execution is quite pedestrian, and I made the mistake of ordering from their tired-looking buffet - two dishes with brown rice for $8.25. Unfortunately like most Chinese fast-food eateries, the food had been left in the warmers too long by 3:30PM, and it was scorchingly hot while lacking in genuine flavor at the same time. I tried a combination of their Eggplant Tofu - which indeed was eggplant and tofu, not an eggplant-flavored tofu - sauteed in that familiar brown sauce we all know from the dregs of the red egg & ginger parties. Added to that hot mess was the Szechuan Green Bean which also had tofu strips to make it substantial. Didn't work since it just drooped from the pool of garlic oil in my plate (see photo). Unlike Englebert Humperdinck, after the loving, I'm not in love with the Loving Hut.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...bad buffet\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...it's the mall, stupid\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...I honestly can't remember, so I'll split the difference\nTOTAL - 2 stars...when loving is wrong, nothing goes right", "author": "Ed U."}

As I continued toward the end of the area, it was then that Loving Hut hopped out at me. Vegetarian options? I'm game. I was feeling like I wanted something lighter, so I decided to try their heavenly salad. \n\nLet me honestly saw, this salad, paws down, lives up to its \"heavenly\" name. The salad has an absolutely amazing citrus dressing that is sweet and tangy and perfectly accentuates the flavors of the veggies and soy item. The portion is also very large and filling, but doesn't feel weigh you down. The salad is presented very beautifully and carefully which just adds another level of heaven for me. I can literally not stress enough, if you are here, GET THIS SALAD! I literally make trips to Westfield for this salad only, it truly is worth it. \n\nService here is always prompt and friendly, and while this is a food court restaurant, it doesn't have that cheap \"food courty\" feel to it.

I've sampled the fresh veggie rolls, the Rainbow Salad and also gotten the combo plate with two hot items and rice. Each time, I've been consistently pleased with the taste and quality of the food.\nTo begin with the Rainbow Salad is huge!! With the shreds of soy protein, carrots, cucumbers and shredded lettuce, it's quite a colorful and filling meal. The peanut dressing doesn't drench the salad and they give you a good amount to mix in evenly. For $7.95 or $8.95 (forgot which it is) it's a fresh and delicious lunch.\n\nAs for the fresh veggie rolls, those can be a meal in and of itself with fresh tofu, veggies, not-fried wrap and their wonderful peanut sauce accompanying them.\n\nWhen getting the hot items, I thought they were tasty and sufficient, although not blown away. It's decent food at a good price, but I'd recommend going with some of the fresher items like the salads or spring rolls. Overall it's probably a 3 star food experience, but I am bumping it a star for the quicker service and cheaper prices that are available versus other Westfield options.

I love pumpkin curry but have never come across a sweet potato version and have to say it was at least as good as any pumpkin curry I've ever had. Lots of perfectly cooked sweet potato, tofu and veggies in a well-balanced curry sauce and some fresh rice on the side. Their vegan cakes looked good, but the only other thing I had was their sweetened hibiscus tea, which not too sweet and made a nice change. Service was quite friendly too and the curry + rice was reasonably priced at $8.50. \n\nSo, 4/5 stars for quality and value, and I'm also giving the Loving Hut 5/5 green stars for social and environmental impact. First, obviously, a plant-based diet is clearly better than a meat-heavy diet for the planet on several fronts: better use of land for feeding the population, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, avoids the animal cruelty that comes with the intensive meat industry, and is better for human health. Second, I really like their business model: each restaurant is independently-owned and comes up with its own menu. For a chain restaurant with over 200 locations worldwide (about 40 in the U.S., four in the Bay Area) it's a great idea to not replicate the same menu in every restaurant. Each restaurant can come up with their own menu depending on what's available locally, and can also suit local dietary trends and needs. The idea of walking into a chain restaurant that has thousands of locations worldwide and knowing that they churn out these identical meals in huge facilities (and then waste energy shipping them all over the country/world) is really a repulsive concept. Finally, if you're vegan or vegetarian, it's nice to know that you can order anything on the menu without having to ask the staff for a history of the dish (like the chicken in Portlandia).", "author": "James K."}

I realize that this more of a luxury mall than I'm possibly used to, but not McDonald's or Taco Bell in sight!  And to top it all off - a Loving Hut!\n\nI opted for the the $8.95 meal with brown rice, some sort of mostly potato and a tiny bit of tofu pale yellow curry and what was presumably some protein nugget rendition of sweet and sour chicken.  It wasn't too bad, but I can't say I was really all that impressed!\n\nThe sweet and sour nuggets were a bit dry and very very fried.  This could partially be explained by the fact that we had descended upon the food court rather late during lunch time, and the lady scooping up my lunch didn't really have an immense reservoir left of the stuff to pick from.  It wasn't exactly hot - nearly cool.  It tasted all right, but it did pale in comparison to the food I've devoured at the Houston Loving Hut location.  The curry was decent, but more potato than anything else - a few tofu morsels here and there.  The flavor was quite mild.  Good ole sriracha saved me again!  For $9, it was all right, but the Loving Hut server/cashier was quite conservative with her scoops.  \n\nI tried my cousin's sweet potato fries and chicken finger analogue - I've had the latter before at the Houston location.  It was WAAAY greasier here, like holy heart attack!  And not as tasty!  The sweet potato fries were just fried and left unseasoned.  Boo!  I felt a bit guilty for encouraging my cousin, an omnivore, to give Loving Hut a chance and she'd ended up with a super fried pile of rather bland stuff.  \n\nI would really highly recommend you NOT opt for the $8.95 special or fried items and order from the made-upon-order stuff.  \n\nIt was all edible and not terrible, but I had high expectations and well, this just didn't meet them.

You can't walk a block without having access to all sorts of sandwiches, pizza by the slice, burrito-sized sushi rolls, and any food you can imagine pre-packaged in a paper or plastic box for easy transport back to your desk. \n\nIt was one of those days that I wanted something a little more filling than a salad. Following a vegan diet, most of what you will eat in this area is lackluster veggie patties, tofu prepared in a dozen sad ways, and meals that simply have the dairy or meat left off. So, I decided to give Loving Hut a shot. The Westfield Mall is one of those locations I forgot existed as a majority of the offerings are very carnivores, which is great for them. \n\nFor my first visit I ordered the Garden Vermicelli and was surprised how much food you got. I see a few people have complained about the price, well it's pretty on par with anything else in the mall's food court, and cheaper than many of the other vegan places the city has to offer. \n\nThe texture soy protein, or whatever they may call it, has a color and feel very much like meat. Those vegans that are totally against any food resembling meat at all will have an issue with this. I don't, as i'm one of those that think certain elements of the diet can be textured and shaped in a way that it makes it easier for meat eaters to give the cuisine a try. The \"all or nothing\" attitude many vegans have does not help the arguments very much. Sure, we would all love for people to just switch over, but let's be realistic. Anyway, the second time I went I tried the steam table combo. For $8.95 you can get two items, which is a good deal. The sweet and sour \"protein\" was ok, nothing I would get again, and the chow mien was good, but the noodles had that feel that they get after sitting under a heat lamp for too long.

I didn't know that it was a chain, so add this to the very short list chains I like. \n\nI had the Loving Hut sandwich. It could have used a bit more protein, but that just goes to show that the protein featured is really delicious because I am often unimpressed with soy protein (which, let's face it, is vegan \"junk\" food as it's super processed). And the bread... wow. I'm prone to hollowing out bread on my sandwiches but this French bread is out of this world. It may be toasted with a touch of soy margarine. It's almost like garlic bread. Another shocker: the side of coleslaw. Normally I wouldn't even touch coleslaw, but I'm glad I tasted this one because it's perfectly spiced and has just a bit of soy mayo. Scarfed the little side of it immediately and was left wanting for more. Yes, a good thing.\n\nThough not big into sweets, I cannot pass up anything pumpkin and I saw a cake with a sign saying it was pumpkin cheesecake. The girl informed me it was mocha, not pumpkin. When I later took a bite (took it to go), I realized it wasn't vegan cheesecake but regular cake.

You can do it Panda Express style and pick a side and entrees from the steam table or you can order from their menu. They also have several appetizers and steamed buns for the not so hungries, giant salad for the green-grazers, and DESSERTS for the sweet-cravers. \n\nFor desserts, they have cheesecake, mocha cake, carrot cake, and maybe something else that I missed because I was desperately trying to get the last piece of cheesecake before someone else grabbed it. I personally really-liked the cheesecake. It was creamy, moderately sweet, and very slightly tart. It was very similar to Vietnamese yogurt but with a firmer texture. It's definitely not as sweet or firm or savory as real cheesecake but still very enjoyable.\n\nTheir steamed bun was sort of like a Chinese BBQ Pork bun. The sweet-savory filling was a deep red. I couldn't really make out what it is made of because everything is mushed. I think I still prefer the veggie steamed buns from Out The Door because I don't like sweet fillings. But if you like the sweet-savoriness of BBQ Pork Buns, here's a vegan alternative for you.\n\nTheir salad is prepared to order. The Heavenly Salad...a bed of spring mix and shredded lettuce tossed in vinegarette sat on top of sliced cucumbers and tomatoes and topped with seasoned faux meat. And it's HUGE! The salad was pretty good. The veggies were fresh and crisp. The faux meat was well seasoned but really tough.\n\nService was great. The tall Asian middle-aged man was very friendly and always smiling like a skinny Buddha. The other girls seemed very nice and attentive too. They were giving other customers samples and helping them decide what entrees to choose. Even though they were busy, they asked me if I've been helped. \n\nThe wait was a bit longer than usual mall food wait because I had to wait for them to heat up the steamed bun and prepare my salad. All the tables nearby were taken so I was awkwardly standing at the corner kind of getting into other people's way as I wait.\n\nI really appreciate that they offer FREE water. You think that should be a standard already right? But usually places sell you bottled water and that's like the default even if they have free water. Here, they also have bottled water but they will give you a glass for water instead of charging you for the bottle by default.\n\nRating breakdown:\nFood quantity: Generous -- 4 stars\nFood quality: Average -- 3 stars\nPrice: Average -- 3.5 stars\nService: Great -- 4 stars\n*base on the consideration of this establishment being in a mall and my personal experience\n\nGood to Knows:\n- they don't take AMEX\n- utensils are located around the corner past the register and water dispenser\n- water dispenser is located to the left of the register -- so don't wonder why they gave you a glass if you asked for water\n- don't carry your filled water glass on the tray; it slips \n- after you finished eating, you can hand your tray to one of the food court attendants -- so don't leave your tray on the table or throw it in the trash", "author": "Jennifer L."}

When I spotted the PHILLY SANDWICH, I was excited. I was not expecting it to taste like a beef Philly but I imagined a big piece of tofu steak in delicious barbecue sauce.  \n\nFirst bite and I almost gagged. Awful! Terrible! Gross! The tofu filling for Loving Hut's Philly sandwich was slimy and had a really bizarre taste--not sweet, not spicy. It did not taste like barbecue sauce. My brain kept on saying \"you are eating cat food\"  and I had to ignore the voices.  After 3 bites, I took out the filling and ate the bun which was nice, crusty and warm, with the coleslaw which was actually pretty tasty. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/NoxxbgVp7ilvMm6O9FX9hA?select=Gwrrn_VFpIkHMNIl0dMBQg\n\nI am not easily grossed out by the taste of food.

I ordered with my brown rice:\n\nSWEET AND SOUR SAVORY: Vegan version of Sweet and Sour Chicken. The flavorings were nice and spicy.  This dish was not bland and pretty good for a vegan dish. (3.5 Stars)\n\nBEANS WITH VEGAN SHRIMP: If I leave the shrimp on the counter for 3 days then cook it, the consistency will probably be like the one at Loving Hut. Although it looked like real shrimp, it was slimy and not appetizing. The beans, though, were crunchy and nice. I did not eat the shrimp but finished my whole plate. (2.5 Stars)\n\nOverall:\nDo I expect vegan food to taste like the real meat? No.  \nHave I had vegan food in the past? Many times and I love most of them. My ultimate favorite is the vegan duck that my friend used to make.\n\nSome of the items at Loving Hut are actually tasty. Their meat substitutes are not only not good but not edible.\n\nWhy 1 Star?

What's wrong with you there, Ladies ??? I think you need to go back to elementary schools at least, or get some kind of degrees BEFORE applying for ANY jobs if you want to survive, especially in the U.S.\nEDUCATION comes first, whether formal or informal.  It's the foundation of  your success in life.  \n\n-  Food:  always SALTY.  Always COLD, even after their rewarming in microwave.  All \"fake\" meats  are made from frozen and processed food made in Taiwan, which you can find in most Asian grocery stores.\n\n-  Price:  very OVERPRICED for such a LOW-QUALITY food.  Much more expensive than in many other Asian restaurants nearby, even with their formal and full staff service (with waiters, busboys, host/hostess serving you at the table).\n\n-  Food SAFETY:  Watch out!  Some foods (especially the \"Banh Bao\" bun) is reheated in microwave with their UNremoved plastic wrap --- one of the causes for CANCER.  In fact, I did mention this to one of the serving ladies, but they chose to ignore it.  \n\nWill I go back to this restaurant?  You bet I won't .  (I already tried and retried several times and give them a chance to improve themselves, but to NO avail.)\n\nNow the choice is YOURS.  Good luck.", "author": "F. L."}

It's not necessary, and you can just put organic tofu instead.\n\nThat being said it's pretty easy to avoid the mock meat or just ask them not to put it on their noodle salads and soups.

Ananda Fuara and Golden Era are good sit-down meals, but Loving Hut is perfect for take-out.\n\nI've been here twice and impressed twice, demonstrating that vegan food doesn't have to turn you off because it's completely devoid of delicious animal products.  I've had the Grilled Philly Sandwich and the Queen Sandwich, which taste similar and similarly yummy.  The soy protein was so flavorful and juicy--I liked that it was light and didn't mock meat.  My only complaint is that there's not enough of it for all the dense, fluffy bread.  I would've liked more soy protein for a $9 sandwich.\n\nI enjoyed the milk tea beverages as well, but they were pricey at $3-4 or so.  Loving Hut is a welcome change from my meaty pace once in a while, but it's overpriced (what isn't in the Food Emporium, though?).

As a vegetarian, I have recently acquired a taste for veggie meat. While this is a fairly newfound love, eggplant has been my favorite food for a while. So, of course, I was in the mood for the eggplant for lunch. Lucky for me, after searching the empty Bristol Farms hot food bar, I saw the delicious Chinese eggplant at The Loving Hut. But, as soon as I had oohed and ahhed over the eggplant. My eye shifted to the tempting sweet and sour veggies and vegan meat. Finally, my eyes raced over to the steamed kale. The perfect lunch mix! \n\nWhile I usually run away like the Gingerbread man when I see the pre-made, terrible quality Asian food in a mall food court, the quality was far superior to the usual. While the Loving Hut is a chain, it seems that this location is slightly different presentation-wise as some of the actual restaurants don't offer the pre-made options. \n\nTaste. I first gobbled up the eggplant. It was a tiny bit overly mushy for my taste, but it still had a delicious salty, saucy flavor. It also came with perfectly chewy tofu. Fortunately, the brunt of the meal consisted of the eggplant. This led to a very busy and happy mouth. Next, I attacked the sweet and sour part of the meal. I absolutely love this sauce and would have liked a bit more sauce actually...The fake meat was a bit on the tougher side rather than one of the chewy brands. I clapped in delighted surprise when I tasted a piece of pineapple. I love cooked pineapple in Asian sauce--I could probably just eat an entire plate of this! There was a nice mix of veggies also. Finally the kale. Oh boy was it salty--but exactly what I was craving. I am a \"kaleite.\" It is one of my favorite foods and this was steamed deliciously. It had a tiny bit too much sauce, but was scrumptious nonetheless. It is not that easy to find steamed kale at Asian restaurants. \n\nAll in all, a few minor changes would have stepped the food up one more level. But, it was still a delicious and nutritious lunch. I would definitely return to try one of the many other tasty options that caught my eye.

In the end, I got the rice with two sides. I am seriously in love with eggplant tofu, so I had that and I also got this curry sweet potato dish.\n\nThe eggplant tofu was good! Nothing spectacular though. It has sesame seeds to top it off, so it was a nice touch. I do wish it had a BIT more flavor, but maybe I just have very bland taste buds. The sweet potato tofu curry was DELICIOUS... I debated whether to buy some to-go so I could bring it back to San Jose (which I didn't :[ ). The potatoes were so nicely cooked and the sweetness brought out the flavor of the whole dish.

Then I was given an order pager.\n\nThe pager activated, and I get to the counter and see my sandwich but not the smoothie. I asked about the drink, and the person handing me my food had no idea what I meant. She checked the order ticket, then rudely told me to go eat and wait to be paged again.

So the meat is not real, but then again I've often questioned the meat authenticity of mall food court joints that don't claim to be vegan anyways.  As a true omnivore I am not biased by the lack of vegan places which could cause some to inflate a food rating when a new one opens.  Instead, I judge on food alone and can say I was not impressed.\n\nBeef & Broccoli: Only a few flecks of \"beef\" amongst firm and barely steamed huge stalks of broccoli.  I'm all about veganizing meat dishes, but why choose a mediocre Americanized (in a bad way) Chinese fast food dish?  The \"beef\" did feel and taste like the real bovine deal so they accomplished that feat, though they should have added more of it.\n\nString Beans & Shrimp: ONE \"shrimp\" amongst some crisp string beans.  Seriously?  Isn't soy product cheaper than shellfish?!?!?  It was a tasty shrimp with a texture similar to fish cake rather than actual stringy shrimp.  The string beans were in a nice spicy sauce.  Though I was a bit too salty that they only gave me one stinking shrimp to enjoy this!\n\nLo Mein: The highest ranking of the dishes I tried, but that is a low bar.  The \"pork\" was spot on and the noodles were filling.  Just enough veggies to add a fresh crisp and texture without overpowering the starchy carbs.  As good as any fast food mall pork lo mein I've had without the animal slaughter.\n\nChicken Nuggets: No better than those frozen vegan chik'n nuggets at Safeway.  In fact, might have been the same ones!  Real chicken nuggets don't taste much like chicken so this was a good facsimile, but I expected more innovation from a restaurant like this.\n\nSweet Potato Fries: Standard, common, boring.  Seems like everyone does sweet potato fries nowadays.  Just like any other.", "author": "Adam B."}

The do not add mint to their spring rolls, leaving you with tasteless noodles, lettuce, and a chewy rice wrapper. There is a small sprig of cilantro and plenty of sauce to mask the fact that there is no zing of fresh flavor every good spring roll should have. I also ordered their fried roll - which did have way more flavor and came with a ponzu sauce. If you are vegan because you are living a healthy lifestyle I wouldn't recommend this place. If you are just trying to eat less meat then this could be a good place to try. They looked to have other food that is hopefully a little tastier then what I ordered.", "author": "Megan G."}

I'm sure I can empty a whole plate into my Buddah belly in 8 minutes flat. Also, this location seems a little more cleaner than the Chinatown location -- but I'm definitely not hating on them!\n\nI prefer the basil mushroom side. The sweet potatoe curry is pretty legit too. I like to add sri-racha for some extra spice, not because they are bland, but because I like spice. I also like to divvy up my lunch combo plate with two items ($9.04 with tax incl), with both fried rice and chow-mein. At any given time, they have about 8 dishes going on and a refrigerated case of desserts that I have not tried yet.\n\nMy suggestion: get your food to go. I think they pack the food into it a lot more than if it were on a plate. Also, if you plan on waiting a day to consume, decorate with hot sauce -- perfect amount of time for the food to marinate the spice and give it a good kick.

I've eaten there several times; I use to be a big fan because it's conveniently 'fast food'. I admit its not necessarily healthy, but its healthier than most other fast food chains. That being said, I would've give more stars if it wasn't for the bad costumer service. The first few times, were minor. Not giving me my receipt when I ask for it, or, giving me an incorrect one. Other times the cashier /server talked back to my father when he gave his order. Scenario: Dad: \"Id like the tofu eggplant and brown rice\" Cashier/server:\" You mean, white rice, yes?\" Dad: No, the brown rice please\" Cashier/Server: \"Why tell me now? huh?\" (rolls eyes) (dumps white rice out and annoyingly serves brown rice) etc... My dad use to work in the restaurant business, and he understands the pressure of work, he was forgiving about it...I wasn't to though. My last straw was when I ordered my meal and they didn't call me for over 15 minutes. (I ordered a salad) it seems like it was already done sooner but they didn't call me soon after. Its ironic because they give you these device that light up, vibrate and make noise when its ready...so, I'm not sure what went wrong there. Not to mention, I stood there wanting to ask them on the process of my order. The cashier and server both saw me standing, they turned around glanced at me...and believe it or not continued talking..as if I were invisible...fine I had to speak loudly at them to get someone's attention. The cook had to point them to me so that one could get my attention.. Overall it was uncomfortable for me so, as much I like the food. I had to let go of the bureaucracy. I can't stand unhelpful people there who treat there costumers like nothing. Come on \"Loving Hut\"?

Nothing against 'ya, but just not my thing...)\n\nSo when I saw this restaurant and saw the spicy eggplant and sweet potato curry, I thought \"Hmmmm?  Two of my favorite veggie!!!\"  I just had to try it. I'm so glad I did b/c both of those items ROCK!!!  VERY TASTY w/o having it \"sit\" in your stomach!!!  And add to that.... vegan flan!?!?!?!  NO DAIRY!?!?!  OMFG!!!  A FLAN that I can actually EAT w/o getting sick afterward in the bathroom!!!  And it still taste like flan... very light, sugary.\n\nAlso, it's at food court price!  Now... it ain't Greens!!!  It's NOT for the refined palate.  It doesn't have the nice fancy schmacy table service and certainly NOT the atmosphere (i.e. Marina Green, pretty boats...)  You'll probably been sitting at the food court with a bunch of SCREAMING BRATS and parents yelling back at them.  But having the vegan flan and other desserts where it doesn't have dairy to screw with my stomach trumps Green's dessert menu!!!  And if I really need to get away and sit at a nice area, I can always order it \"to-go\" and sit near the water sculpture at Yerba Buena Gardens and have a picnic!!!  :P\n\nCan't give a 5 yet... have to try the other desserts, the meat substitutes meals and that steamed \"fake pork\" bun.\n\nAnd yes, this place is too small and at too mainstream of a locale for those religious videos that the Loving Hut at Chinatown has.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-05-20", "description": "I was really excited that Loving Hut was opening in Westfield. Alas, the food was only mediocre. My husband brought home a selection from the buffet and, while the food was tasty, it wasn't anything special. It certainly wasn't of the same caliber of Golden Era or Enjoy Vegetarian (the top notch vegan Chinese restaurants). \n\nLast night, I tried again, this time getting their Philly sandwich.  The faux meat bordered on being too sweet but the real crime was the extremely hard \"French baguette\".  Why on earth they chose this bread is beyond me--it was way too hard to chew and wasn't worth it. Compared to the seitan Philly sandwich from Jay's Cheesesteak, it really doesn't hold a candle.  It was served with a coleslaw which was good--I used it to stuff the sandwich which thankfully softened the bread somewhat.\n\nThey also need a better way to call out numbers for those who are waiting to pick up. The voices of the cooks are very soft and don't carry. \n\nI noticed a couple of reviewers mentioned steamed buns. I didn't see any, but I definitely would have ordered a couple if I did! If any good, my husband and I would probably purchase them on a regular basis. (It's hard to find good vegan steam buns!)\n\nAnyway, I'll probably continue eating at the Westfield Loving Hut, as it is in a convenient location if you are out shopping or going to a movie and there's really not that much competition for vegan restaurants in that area.

I also noticed that most of the others had a queue as big as my hunger and Loving Hut had a very small one in comparison (obviously, not a good sign usually!) so I decided to eat there.\n\nI ordered the Garden Vermicelli noodles which was basically a salad with two spring rolls and a thai sweet dipping sauce which I guess also acted like a dressing. That was just a little under $9. The lady who served me struggled to understand my english accent and I'd also struggled to understand her \"?\" accent but eventually I worked out that what she was trying to tell me was that they didn't have vermicelli noodles and would replace it with rice noodles instead. As I was waiting for my food I noticed some guy had ordered an asian sandwich which looked amazing. That was a good sign so was looking forward to seeing how mine looked. I didn't have to wait long and when I looked down and saw the salad on my tray resting against my stomach I soon realised that it was actually bigger than my belly.... which is going some!! \n\nI am ashamed to say that I couldn't finish the dish but I was pleasantly surprised that for a food court restaurant, the food tasted pretty good. There were some sort of black coloured food item that didn't look all that appetising which ran along the middle of the bowl... i presumed it was mushroom but after tasting it i was none the wiser. Spring rolls were crispy and very filling and the noodles were fine. There was a lot of green salad leaves, lettuce, mint and coriander which I just couldn't eat in the end just because there was so much of it.\n\nI did feel slightly uncomfortable at the amount of people standing around my table, walking past hunting for an empty seat and trying to stare me out. This was very off putting but you have to expect that from a food court. In the end, I was happy with the choice but would probably suggest a takeaway or eat there when it's not lunch!!", "author": "Nigel L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-13", "description": "I go to Loving Hut at least once a week for lunch during my work week.  I've had the buffet plate, the sandwiches, one of the noodle dishes and both of the noodle soups.   \n\nFirst off, I absolutely love the lemongrass with tofu, basil mushrooms, noodle soup, spicy noodle soup, and the queen sandwich.  just for these alone i'd go back again and again.  they're tasty, filling, and the portions are huge.  it's rare for me to actually clean my plate.  Also, the freshly made lemonade is great.  My only complaint about it is that I never have enough.\n\nThe staff at this location is also very friendly and nice.  I enjoy my experience here.\n\nTwo drawbacks I'll point out.  The bread isn't to my liking.  It's not stale, but it's that day old stale where it's not soft and fresh, but it's not rock hard.  It's just at the turning point.  I don't know if that's the type of bread it is, or if they just don't use enough of it that they are using day old bread.  I really like my bread to be soft and fresh, so while I like the sandwiches and the fillings, the bread is a bit of a turn off.  I'll still get them occasionally, but not as often as the buffet or the soups. \n\nSecond, I find the spicing to be variable.  As in sometimes I'm expecting spicy and it's not, other times I'm expecting not spicy and it is.  For example, they have two noodle soups that are very similar in ingredients, except one has chili oil/sauce in it.  It's pretty obvious which one does, it's got an orange tinge to the broth. I've had both and enjoyed both, even though I'm not a fan of spicy foods.  One lunch, I decided I wanted the noodle soup but I was *not* in the mood for spicy, so I ordered the non-spicy one.  The amount of heat in the broth was so over the top, I could barely eat it.  It was even more hot than the spicy version I'd had before.  I wasn't very happy with that since I had ordered the mild one for a reason.  \n\nOverall though, it's still one of my favourite places to go at lunch time.

All of the master's employees  always appear to be quite kind and friendly.\n\nUnlike the Vegetarian House in SJ or the Loving Hut in Milpitas, there was no wise words of wisdom on a pretty pretty flat screen encouraging me to live simply and to be nice to the animals. Instead I just had to resort to staring at the Bloomingdale's window and fantasize about champagne wishes and caviar dreams.\n\nThere are a million choices in this part of town and in this mall. I still wholly recommend this place as one of the healthiest,  fastest, and (relatively) economical choices here.", "author": "Kitty N."}

The Pho in particular is a treat, because most Vietnamese places have only chicken or beef-based pho. Towards the end of the day, the broth is particularly rich and complex.\n\nRegarding the bashers - yo, look, every Asian place cooks with soy sauce. If you can't eat soy sauce, don't ever eat at Asian places. They have no obligation to create culturally bizarre dishes just for your health quirks.  These people are practicing Buddhism, not following a diet trend.  If you are on a low gluten diet and can handle soy sauce, which frankly provides a miniscule amount of gluten, then you've got some options. Things to avoid- wheat buffet noodles; some of the fake meat may have gluten base, and obviously avoid the bao buns. Go for the tofu dishes sauteed with veggies, plus brown rice.\n\nGenerally a nice small business, with good options, at a fair price.", "author": "R S."}

I wait, and my food comes in a timely manner. But for some reason, my food did not come in a timely manner and I have no idea why. Is it because they open at 10am and I was there at 11:30 and there was absolutely no one there? Did it really take that long to put my vegan Pho together, which by the way, was to-go? Did it really take twenty minutes for them to put broth in a take out cup and noodles, tofu and mushrooms in a container, too? I was not a happy camper, let's just say that. \n\nLong story short, I waited twenty minutes for food that I have to say that I didn't really like. I was excited at the prospect of something new and somewhat different in the food court at the mall, but then again, it's the mall. I shouldn't hold such high expectations. \n\nI am though, willing to try this place again. Perhaps I was wrong in trying to order soup. All I could think was that if it took 20 minutes to put this 9 dollar soup together, then it should be good (in all honesty, I didn't like the flavors). I'm interested in their salads... they have some hot foods available but when I looked at what they had, I noticed their rice had that \"hardened and sitting out for a while\" look to it. Wasn't exactly encouraging, but I am curious as to how their salads taste because the menu did look enticing. I'd like to update this with a better review at some point.", "author": "Caroline L."}

I'm not exactly sure what happened but it's like they decided their food too good for mall food.... and so slowly everything got greasier and more sugary to match with the rest of the veg offerings in the mall. I've gone here and thought I should've gone to Panda Express for health reasons. I felt sick to my stomach after last time I got a combo... there's just too much grease. The pho is suspiciously sugary... I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to taste as sweet as some of the Japanese candies I was eating earlier that day. The fake meats they add to stuff are pretty good and there's quite a variety but they amount the add has slowly decreased over time as the prices have stayed the same or increased. The vegetables seem pretty fresh which is one plus. Service is fast and polite. The lemonade isn't that good and is sort of just a pricey rip off... if you ask them not to stuff the glass up with ice first, they'll charge you a decent chunk extra. (I haven't bought a drink from them since.)\n\nIt would be 2 stars but fast service and being vegan earn it three in my book. (That and the fact I've rated worse places with two stars.)

I tried the kale, mushroom with brown sauce, i love the sweet-sour chicken it's delicious. if you want to add the 3rd thing you have to add $2 each item.\nanother thing i love is: garden vermicelli (delicious soy meat taste sweet + long bean sprout + white vermicelli + lettuce + mint/cilantro + cucumber + peanut crushed + 2 fried spring rolls + 1 bowl of vietnamese sauce ) , it's served in a big bowl, so 1 bowl makes me real full already! but this garden vermicelli taste very vietnamese, so delicious yum yum! 1 dish will cost like $8.25 +tax.\n\nthe service is not that great because everytime i come here, nobody in this place is ever SMILE. It's like they don't reflect this beautiful stall of Loving Hut and the compassion and loving symbol of Loving Hut, it's such a shame.

And not sneaky it-just-so-happens-to-be-vegan but in BIG letters on the side of the kiosk-space. I don't spend much time at Westfield but I am much more inclined to go and get a bite to eat at Loving Hut now that it's in the mall.", "author": "M M."}

I've eaten there twice this week and i will be back for more for sure!\n\nI ordered the buffet combo for $8.95 I believe, which is 2 items and a side of either chow main or fried rice. I got the chow main and the spicy green beans with curry today. the spicy green beans are no joke SPICY! you can taste the spiciness and the freshness of the beans. the curry with tofu and potato was YUMMY!!!!\n\ntheir food is not oily at all, and you can even tell its not real meat!!! hands down this is one of my favorite lunch spot from now on =)", "author": "Jenny G."}

Not sure why more than 70% of the reviews are giving this restaurant at LEAST 4 stars!?!?!? Not only is this place overly priced and the customer service is horrible, but the food is flavorless and not worthy of anybody's money. I have been to vegan Thai restaurants many times and this \"cheap, fast\" place is not even mediocre when it comes to compare... The food is buffet style and sits in warmers until you order, so you don't get that fresh taste of good food, and to make matters worse, they water down the chili sauce. I would never suggest this place to anyone. Two thumbs down.", "author": "Shadi R."}

If you were that weird guy eyeing my F21 bag like you were gonna steal that shit, or if you were the tiniest oldest hunch back-etiest elderly couple sitting next to me, I was the girl sitting in a giant blue windbreaker licking myself from forearm to fingertips as vegan mayonnaise and coleslaw dripped from the Loving Hut sandwich I was making out with, and I apologize if I ruined your appetite. Things got a little out of hand, but once I bit into that soft and crunchy French bread with the marinated soy protein and said vegannaise and coleslaw, I no longer cared that I was in public although strangely I remained clothed, as my neighbors unfortunately know, I prefer to eat in the nude. The sandwich was like $9, which is pushing it you guys. That, and the fact that I'm trying not to be a UberFatty as much anymore prevented me from trying everything on the menu. Also, I was greeted by pumpkin cheesecake which is my KRYPTONITE and I refrained from getting it for the fact that I'm trying not to be Obese Betty anymore as stated above. I guess I should feel good about the fact that I resisted the temptation and didn't trade 300 or so calories for fleeting happiness like my trainer says, but that skinny bitch doesn't know true happiness. Now I just feel sad and have to go back to   try the pumpkin cheesecake and then cry afterward. Also, from what I've gathered from reading reviews of their other location, the restaurant is run by some kind of PETA-esque cult? THAT IS AWESOME.", "author": "Joe T."}
