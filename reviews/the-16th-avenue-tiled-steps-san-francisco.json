Okay, before I get carried away... there's a difference between one of the greatest painters the world has ever seen, and a community public park in a San Francisco neighborhood. A project started by the residents... oh that creativity & passion! You made it happen! \n\nOnce again the serendipity card comes into play as I find myself in the area after visiting my old home on 19th Ave. It's amazing to know this work of working art is in my old neighborhood. In 2003, a grassroots effort led by residents to create a \"sea to stars\" themed mosaic art flowing up 163 steps began. Two years later it was open to the public for all to enjoy! The Gardens to the south was donated by Alice Yee Xavier one of the dreamers of the stairway to Heaven! And as beautiful as it is... it's still absolutely free to all... \n\nOn my visit I couldn't help but stop at almost every step. As many are now memorials for loved ones. Some dedicated to SFPD, to \"Mom\", to others in the community. Some tile art are of whimsical animals like frogs, fish, hummingbirds, snakes, and insects. Flowers seem a popular subject too. And the stars, yes the stars! The imagination ran wild here, and yes, in a very good way! I really enjoyed my walk! \n\nIn the end, I highly recommend The 16th Ave Tiled Steps for all to enjoy. It's a great spot for photo-ops and to just enjoy the day. Thank you neighbors! In a way, the residents of my old neighborhood just wanted people to reconnect with people. In today's world we sometimes forget the human element and the artist that lives in us all... \n\n\"Love many things, for therein lies the true strength, and whosoever loves much performs much, and can accomplish much, and what is done in love is done well.\" - Vincent Van Gogh", "author": "Eric R."}

Unfortunately, in true SF fashion, there was a lot of overcast so we weren't able to get that \"beautiful panoramic view\" of the city as many have mentioned in their reviews. Another couple told us it would clear up in a couple of hours but we weren't planning on waiting it out. \n\n163 steps sounded daunting but they were not intense at all. I wouldn't even consider it a workout. We even saw some elderly folks walking up - good for them! Including the additional side stairs, we breezed through this place in roughly 10 minutes.\n\nSure the tiles were pretty and we took some not-IG-worthy pics. I guess I'm glad to say been there, done that but it was so anticlimactic that I almost feel it was a waste of time! Maybe I'd sing a different song if we caught a sunset otherwise I would not recommend putting this on your list of things to check out.", "author": "Bee N."}

After each section of the stairs have been revealed and you take that last step at the bottom, you are finally rewarded with the beauty of piecing all the tiled section together to make one beautiful art piece!\n\nHighly recommend visiting this tourist spot.

The 163-step stairway is a very popular SF photo destination and the view from the top is absolutely spectacular on a day without fog. Thankfully these steps aren't as long as Filbert Steps and Lyon Street Steps (not to mention this is the only one out of the three steps with mosaic tiles) and we stayed here for about 15 minutes.\n\nFinally there is street parking and you will also see signs say \"Daytime car burglary zone - it only takes 20 seconds!! Leave nothing in your car\". We utilized ridesharing apps so this wasn't an issue for us.

Especially for those who love to scour street art like myself, I won't forget this gem. \n\nThings to know:\n*****\nI. LOCATION & PARKING\nIf you're using Google Maps, the location listed on Yelp should take you to the top of the stairs. So, as I pulled up in my Lyft, I started off by experiencing an incredibly gorgeous panorama of several San Francisco neighborhoods.\n\nRegarding parking, well, there are spots all around.\n\nII. THE STAIRS\nAs I noted above, they span several flights. So with that being said, be sure to use the railing while you ascend or descend since they're a bit steep. To view the full span of this masterpiece, you'll have to stand about 10-15 feet in front of the base. (Well, if you're using the camera on your phone.) \n\nI seriously urge you, art lover, you, to take some time and admire each individual step, too. Some may comprise of tropical fishes that seem to acknowledge every hue of the rainbow. Others may be more subdued, but coalesce to form a moon. And if you examine closely, some small groups of mosaic tiles even note the stairs' sponsors. (Fantastic.) \n\nIII. TIME\nI took about a solid half-an-hour to check out these steps, and, again, if you love street art and find yourself in San Francisco it's a worth-while trip. I would consider returning, most definitely. \n\nThe top of the stairs also falls only about twenty or thirty feet away from Grandview Park, which has a spectacular 360 view of the city. One of my favorite views of the city, actually.\n\nIV. OVERALL\nThe stairs definitely help beautify an already fabulous neighborhood. Take some time to appreciate this San Francisco gem.", "author": "Jonathan T."}

As I was wheezing up the stairs (I have asthma) we turned to see the different vistas as we went higher and higher.  My sister in law told us about these steps located by Morgana & 16th about 1/2 mile south of Golden Gate Park.  So what's the big deal?  The stair perpendicular to the hill slope & are decorated with beautiful mosaic patterns on the risers. As you walk up several flights of stairs you see beautiful intricate mosaic patterns.  The treads & landings have tan tiles with a grey tile about 6\"W at the nosing.  When you reach the top about 3-4 flights up, you turn around and see a beautiful panoramic of the city below shrouded w/low flying clouds.\n\nAt the top there is another street, to the right there is another short flight of plain unadorned concrete steps that take you up another level and another street.  From that point there are some wooden stairs that zig zag up to the top of the hill.  We were feeling ambitious so we started climbing up the stairs but it was so dam cold and windy with the clouds moving in  we decided to can the climb and come back down.\n\nSomething to be aware of, we were told that SF is the smash and grab Capitol of America so it's advised that you put anything of value in the trunk", "author": "Phil S."}

It was super easy to get to and street parking was easy enough to find - even on a warm Saturday afternoon. It was a little busy on the stairs and overlook point because it was Fleet week. A little difficult to take good pictures with people all around hogging the stairs, sitting, lingering and photo bombing your every attempt to create artistic looking hipster selfies. So I suggest coming on a weekday during an off time.\n\nOtherwise, the steps themselves are gorgeous. And if you go all the way up, you get an amazing view of the sunset district.

It's only a 5 minute walk between the two and the 15th Avenue Steps Park is certainly less crowded though overlooked I would guess since it's all under the shade of the trees and doesn't shine quite as bright.

Some took the opportunity to do a photo shoot (???) which makes it difficult for others to walk up the stairs and take their own pictures. But it was still a nice local spot and got a mini workout. We walked to the top (about 140~ steps) and enjoyed the view of the city. Quick tourist stop and a unique part of the city.", "author": "Haneen O."}

It's such a well kept secret though because when I mentioned this to my local friends, none of them had heard of it!\n\nThe mosaic is magnificent and a wonderful piece of artwork for the city! Different sceneries are depicted of the earth, the ocean, and as you ascend the staircase, you're traveling out to the moon and then to the sun-- maybe I'm reading too much into it, but I loved how it wove all of nature's elements together!\n\nThe stairs aren't difficult to climb and your reward at the top is a breathtaking view of the city!

Literally, walking up these steps was a struggle! Hahah just kidding, kind of. I loved the mosaic tiles and the picture it formed from straightforward viewpoint. It was colorful and vibrant in every aspect, not to mention very detailed as well. I've never seen anything like this so it was kind of a \"hole in the wall\" type of landmark. \n\nThe 16th Avenue Tiled Steps project has been a neighborhood effort to create a beautiful mosaic running up the risers of the 163 steps located at 16th and Moraga in San Francisco and I believe they've succeeded impressively. I love the value behind the tiles and how the community came together to fixate it into something more than just steps to run over. It could possibly symbolize much more than just artsy stairs to run up and down on.\n\nWhat's more beautiful than to experience art that was made by hundred of neighbors for more generations to find?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-07", "description": "Long ago in a faraway land called the FiDi I met a young man - more boy than man actually - who I considered a rube.  He had beefy pink, round cheeks, hailed from a faraway place called Idaho, and longed to return there after his limited but life-changing experience in Baghdad by the Bay.   \n\nHe left then, and returned again recently with a grown daughter in tow.  He was threatening to take her on a San Francisco tour of \"all the places I once lived\" before I intervened.  The 16th Avenue Tiles Steps was, both agreed, far superior to what he'd originally planned.  \n \nTucked away in a lightly traveled residential area, the 163 steps which make up this landmark seem like something only very well-connected people would know of.  As a result, you'll likely be startled to see the number of people actually there, climbing the stairs, posing for photos, and ascending higher, to the equally captivating Grandview Park (reached from the top of the tiled steps and up a lot more steps).  \n\nIn 2005 - with thanks to the SF Parks Trust, the 300 neighbors who helped make the tiles, and the 220+ neighbors who sponsored individual tiles - the tiled steps were opened for use.  Their popularity doesn't diminish their loveliness.  If you've not yet checked them out, consider doing so.  I guarantee it's more interesting than a tour of the places you once lived.  \n\n*  This area of the City is not as foggy as most people think.  Both times I've visited the views out to the Pacific Ocean have been breathtaking.\n\n*  The steps scale the side of a large hill.  If you have mobility issues you can view from below but the only way to get to the top is walking.\n\n*  Street parking in the area is free.  Be considerate.\n\n*  There's other tiled step projects in the City.  The nearby \"Hidden Garden Steps\" (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hidden-garden-steps-san-francisco) are complete.

From there, it was a short walk to the steps. The walk up Moraga Street was on a very steep incline to the base of the stairs. \n\nWe were the only people at the steps at the time and it was nice to be able to explore the entire place on our own. The steps were located in amongst a quiet residential neighbourhood and the atmosphere was very peaceful and relaxed. \n\nThe stairs are a community project (the history of them is interesting and I would encourage you to read up on it) and they were tiled beautifully in a variety of colours, patterns and designs, from the bottom to the top. The artwork was amazing and very impressive. This made for some fantastic photo opportunities, and I enjoyed admiring the work that had been to beautify these steps. \n\nThey were located on a hillside and were surrounded by lush greenery and vegetation, as well as houses. We began climbing. The stairs were on a very steep incline and hiking up them was a great workout! We finally made it to the top and were rewarded with gorgeous panoramic views of the expansive city surrounding us. It was breathtaking and the views were definitely worth the climb! It was incredible how far we could see, from the densely treed Golden Gate Park to the ocean and more. \n\nThe Mosaic Steps are off the beaten path from the typical tourist attractions and activities in San Francisco, but they are definitely a hidden gem! It was an incredible experience to admire and climb these steps and they were definitely worth seeing.", "author": "Brittany T."}

It's also an awesome place to watch the sunset! We came here just in time to watch the sunset and it was amazing! Parking is also pretty easy since the residential area isn't so packed and the streets are pretty wide.\n\nJust a warning: the stairs are a work-out. It's definitely very steep and you will be tired by the time you get up there! It's definitely a nice view once you get up there though. It's also a very nice view up there, so it's definitely worth working out those leg muscles! \n\nThe mosaic steps are also very nicely done. It's so pretty! I love that they included the names who probably participated in this project. Those who live by are so lucky! \n\nHint: there is also another copy-cat stairs down the street! I don't know the exact location. But if you're facing upward to the stairs, keep walking down the street toward the left! It's probably like five minutes away. Keep walking until you see an intersection and turn left! It'll be on the right and that stairs will be going down to a different street. If you get lost, do ask whoever that may be around. They'll most likely will know what you're talking about. They're friendly people.\n\nOverall, I definitely enjoyed visiting these two sets of stairs. Such pretty sight and definitely shows the community who put these stairs together. I highly recommend coming here for sunsets or just in general!", "author": "Wendy Y."}

Broken auto glass is everywhere.\n\nLong Version:\nThe police and City know about it, the locals have posted warning signs, and it's been in the news (just google \"Tiled Steps, neighbors fight back\"). In spite of all the attention, car windows are smashed here almost every day. Here's why:\n\n1. People don't bother to read the warning signs, and leave stuff in their cars.\n\n2. People don't think it can happen to them, in broad daylight, in a residential area, in such a short window of time. So they leave stuff in their cars.\n\n3. People try to hide stuff in the hatchback of their cars. These thieves are good at their job, and have been seen posing as students, tourists, etc. They see you putting stuff in the back, where the window is just as easy to break - and more expensive to fix.\n\n4. San Francisco doesn't prosecute the criminals! Even when the police are able to catch someone, the thief is back on the street in no time thanks to lenient apathetic judges and District Attorney George \"Glassc\u00f3n\" (co-author of the regretful Prop 47, which fueled the explosion of auto glass on SF streets). \n\nFun Fact: San Francisco had 29,500 smash 'n' grabs in 2015, according to the DA. That's about 80 per day, and the Tiled Steps area is one of the worst hotspots.\n\nIf you decide to go anyway and you're unlucky enough to be a victim, please report the incident using the info on any of the 27 nearby warning signs, so that your crime statistic can be used to influence City policy in the future.", "author": "Ward E."}

I like that the last few sections show a sun and moon. Every time I get to that point my thighs are burning and I want to die, but I think of Khal Drogo and Daenerys tragic love and it gives me fire and purpose so I power up the last few steps and do a hoarse Dothraki scream at the end. \n\nSometimes if I'm really feeling the fire I'll keep going because you'll find mysterious steps leading higher, shrouded in Poe-ish mist that'll take you to the top of a tree-hemmed hill where it'll drop 10 degrees colder and maybe even rain a little. \n\nBecause the world remembers too. \n\nMy moon and stars. \n\nDamn you Martin. \n\nIt's a great workout.", "author": "Jonathan Y."}

I was pleasantly surprised that although there were quite a few people on the steps, we ended up getting some pretty great photo ops. It was kind of nice to have some others there too so that we could trade cameras to get good group shots rather than several selfie fails. I did, however, feel a little pressure to climb the steps somewhat quickly, because of the others who waited behind to get pics without tons of people in them.\n\nThe stairs really were beautiful, and it was awesome to be able to see them close up on the way up and then get the opportunity for other pics on the way down. I wonder if the colors would've popped more at a different time of day.

But all the people crowding it makes it less beautiful. \n\nStory time: My friend and I started our walk at the bottom of the stairs. We wanted to take a quick shot of the stairs, but there was a girl having a full on photoshoot with two saps (her friends: one holding her bag and one taking her pictures), so we decided to go to the top first. We went up to Grandview Park and had a long chat (I don't know how long, just trust me when I say it was long). When we came back, the same girl was still taking a bunch of pictures. She laid across the stairs and everything. It was like she owned it (or tried to) I'm all for camwhoring, I guess, but be a little considerate, take a break, let others have a turn. We left, and the girl was still having her \"photoshoot.\"\n\nI had a negative memory from this place, but I hope others did/do not.", "author": "Stacy C."}

We really wanted to take pictures with no one in the background. That took a lifetime because they decided to take pictures and just random folks going up and down. \n\nThe steps were well maintained and the location was pretty easy to find if you're not a local. I just google mapped the address placed on yelp.\n\nMy boyfriend and I walked these steps and lets just say I needed a break. I was pretty tired. We tried counting the steps but then lost count half way through. I would say it was around 190 steps. Going down was much easier but a tad scary. Going down the steps isn't as neat as going up because you can't see the art work. At the top of the stairway you'll be able to admire how beautiful san francisco is. \n\nfree parking because you're parking in residential. i would recommend going here if you're visiting sf. it wouldn't take anymore than 30 minutes given the situation we were in [waiting around].", "author": "Lisa D."}

(Probably a metaphor for lofty goals in life, or something profound like that.) Many of the tiles have the embossed names of local people and businesses.\n\nWe left when a French couple arrived.

I knew a stairway to heaven existed!\n\nThese steps are the perfect spot for some alone time. You can get quite a view from here and an even better one right across the street atop Grand View Park. This is surely community art at its finest, with local business names painted each step of the way that contributed to the project.\n\nFor all you photographers, it's hard to get a picture without getting photo-bombed by the hoards of other people, but there are techniques to get around that. In some cases, you can put yourself at the highest step possible where everybody else is below you to get a single shot. Except you're screwing with the people right below you and you're getting less of the stairway in the frame. If that fails, you can do what me and my girl Chloe G. did and just ask the person that's in the way to take the picture for you. That'll get them out of the shot! It's a win-win.\n\nHope, inspiration, motivation, whatever you need, this place has it. It's a sweet escape from all the shit you're dealing with. There's certainly a lot of beauty to be seen and felt here. A must-see if you're in the city!!

But walking up you're distracted by the beautiful mosaics on every step. When you get to the top and turn around, oh my goodness, the view is breathtaking!! You overlook all of The Sunset and the Pacific Ocean. I went around 4pm, so the sun was still shining bright. I imagine going at sunset would be even more stunning. Simply beautiful.", "author": "Maleenee B."}

I have been to San Francisco numerous times to visit my brother, but I didn't find out about the mosaic stairs until about my 5 or 6 time visiting. I had already done the other touristy things, so I did a Google search for unique San Francisco and found the steps. I knew I had to see them and it was well worth the trip! The day I went there weren't many people there. The view is incredible! If you aren't tired of climbing up the 163 stairs, be sure to hike up a few more to Grand View Park. You will be able to enjoy amazing views of San Francisco, that is of course if the fog allows you too.", "author": "Virginia W."}

Located on Moraga between 16th and 17th Street, the 163 mosaic steps soar straight up to the base of Grand View Park (one of San Francisco's highest points). The steps paint a picture of the sea flowing into the sky. A colorful twist of water and sea life swirl up the steps to land with flowers, plants, birds, and frogs and ends with a beautiful sky with stars and even a massive sun.  \n\nThe project started as a community effort to beautify the steps and ended up a work of art known around the world. Started in 2003, the 16th Ave Tiled Steps Project along with hundreds of volunteers helped the vision become a reality. Artists Aileen Barr and Colette Crutcher created the unique design of the risers and over 300 community volunteers helped make the tiles and bring the project to life. \n\nThe steps aren't only known for their beauty. Many locals enjoy using the 163 as a work-out or a place to sit and reflect. The steps are located in Golden Gate Heights, a quiet neighborhood in the Sunset. They are easy to reach by Muni or by car with ample parking.", "author": "Alice S."}

Once at the top of the stairs we crossed the winding streets and took the path and stairs up to Grand View Park. I would recommend doing both at once as it's very satisfying and you feel like you're on top of San Francisco. There was plenty of FREE street parking at the bottom and the top of the stairs.

The only thing more beautiful than the steps themselves is the view from the top ... and definitely make sure you go to the right once you reach the top and take the wooden staircase to the top of Grand View Park.  That is one of the most beautiful views in San Francisco.  You can see Downtown San Francisco, as well as Mt. Sutro, The San Francisco Bay, Golden Gate Bridge, Marin Headlands and every bit of Northern and Western San Francisco plus the Pacific Ocean.\n\nNow let me counter some things that I've read by other people who have posted here.  I would like to dispel a misnomer.  These steps are not in The Sunset.  They are in Golden Gate Heights!!  Though the Sunset is only three blocks west, it's an entirely different world from here.  These steps are a great source of pride for Golden Gate Heights and the Inner Sunset.  This project was overseen by and is maintained in large part by the Golden Gate Height Neighborhood Association. Amongst other foundations.  Check out: http://www.tiledsteps.org/\n\nNext, let me correct those who say you need to rent a car to get here because it's not public transportation accessible.  That's completely untrue.  You can take the N Judah Muni Train to 16th Avenue and walk three blocks South to the stairs (the first set of stairs you encounter will not be the tiled stairs, but you will need to climb those to get to the tiled stairs).  Or you can Take the N Judah Muni Train to 9th Avenue & Judah, then catch the 66 bus that will drop you off right in front of the steps!  \n\nFinally, for those who say there is a shortage of clear weather here in which to see the great view. The foggy season is the summer only.  The rest of the year the weather here is the same as the rest of The City.  So if you are a enthusiast of the outdoors or a hiker or a stairway climber or a view seeker, get out here to Golden Gate Heights and climb these beauties to enjoy the view from Grand View Park.  \n\nAfterwards, make your way to our Inner Sunset shopping district on Irving (centered around 9th Avenue) for some great restaurant choices near Lincoln Blvd and the entrance to beautiful Golden Gate Park's museums, Botanical Gardens, Japanese Tea Garden and Conservatory of Flowers.

I found the Tiled Steps Project initially while surfing through the local flavour listings and after reading some of the reviews, decided I was going to set out to find these colourful mosaics.\n\nIt was a long hike from where I was housed downtown, but my route on my Yelp map didn't lead me astray. It just took me awhile to get there. There were a great many hills that I had to walk up. And that was to the bottom of the stairs. I'd recommend driving or hopping a bus to this point.\n\nAt any rate, the stairs are quite impressive. There's a plaque at the bottom saying that it was a community beautification initiative by the neighbourhood funded by a grant from the City. What a wonderful idea! Thanks for doing this San Francisconites. I thoroughly enjoyed walking up your beautiful stairs and reading some of the names of the families and businesses who helped tile them.", "author": "Wendy P."}

Beautiful homes overlooking the city, freshly paved roads lacing through the hills. Having ridden my bike from the Richmond District, across Golden Gate Park and through the inner Sunset; I eventually gave up and pushed my bike up the hills between 19th to Irving to Judah to Kirkham.  Soon, I gave that up to, and chained my bike at 15th & Kirkham, and walked to 16th & Moraga.  I mention all of this, as a suggestion to take the #28 bus, the N line or simply drive, there's tons of parking and the bus lets you off at the steps.\n\nThe steps are amazing; all 163 of them.  You will want to stroll and gander; read and contemplate the stories and creation of this staircase.  At the top; don't turn around yet.  There is more, and that more is well worth it.  But a couple of precautions.  The 'more' is not only cold, but very windy.  And here is where I want to help prepare those many peeps visiting our fair city by the Bay; this is NOT Southern California, awash in tan-lines and bleach blondes.  This is San Francisco, a city with a chill vibe, in more ways than one.  Always carry a jacket and a hat; no matter the day of the week, the time of the year-or for that matter, the time of the day.  In San Francisco, saying you don't look good in a hat, is like you saying you don't look good in shoes.  My only complaint is, so many hats, yet I have only one head. Staying true to my mantra of always supporting indie artisans, I go to Berkeley and buy my hats from the fantabulous Grace Love.  I have in fact, bought several of varying colors.  They are all handmade with natural fibers and extra love added.  I have an affinity for Grace, as we are both birds of a feather.  She is a single parent, who pays $248.00 per year, to set up and sell her handmade wares on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley. Check out her cool designs here: http://www.crochetnlove.com/ With hat and jacket, you are now ready to tackle the next set of steps, which will deliver you to Grand View Park. A most fitting name for a most grand view.\n\nThis final set of 143 wooden steps, gently slope and meander to the top of the hill. There are benches along the way, with plaques and notes.  The wind is substantially more fierce here and you will need your hat, but once you are there, the view is spectacular.  There is a bench at the top, where you can sit and watch the fog gently roll in and envelop the city.  Or on a clear day, the sun glints off rooftops in the distance.  Either way, the view is breath taking. And much like the hat, which has become a sort of art for me, so does this city seem to be.\n\nFor  a more in depth review, including history and photos, please visit our site at www.tnbta.com\nCheers!

The famous Scala steps in Caltagirone, Italy was one source of inspiration for this neighborhood project.  The designers are local mosaic artists, Collette Crutcher & Aileen Barr.  So, on August 27, 2005, the newly designed stairway was dedicated.  Children call it \"the magic stairway.\"  This info is all from the book mentioned above.  A walker quoted in the book counted 162 steps and a total height of 100 feet.\n\nThe stairway is indeed magical & amazingly beautiful!  The view from them is rather nice too.  As you can see from my profile, I went nuts & took lots of photos (that's not all of them, either).  \n \nWe easily found parking on Moraga, right down the hill from the stairs.

Look no farther. The view on top of this hill is just awesome. What you can see is from the top of the hill is Moraga street running all the way to Ocean Beach. The titled steps is another great reason to visit these stairs. There's different titles making up the sun, stars, and the moon. Another plus is it's a good stair workout place to hit.", "author": "Steven B."}

I've only taken 2 classes, but ask anyone who knows me....whenever I come across tiling, glass, or any other type of mosaic pattern, I go nuts.\nSo, you can imagine what occurred when I happened upon these stairs.  They are absolutely beautiful and every time I go, I stand at the bottom and stare up in awe.  I love the progression and the way the ocean blends into the sky and bright sun.  It is honestly one of the most amazing pieces of art in the city, in my humble opinion....\nNow, if only me and my laziness would climb up and down those stairs...", "author": "Jessica L."}

There are 163 mosaic panels starting with ocean/fish/shellfish tiles at the bottom and graduating to plants, sky and the sun at the top of the stairs.  The tiles are colorful and picturesque. There are sturdy handrails on both sides of the steep staircase.  A requirement for me to climb. \n\nAbout 300 neighbors created this with over 220 of them donating to sponsor the tiles (they get their names and businesses engraved on the tiles), including Arizimendi Bakery, The steps were inaugurated in 8/05.  There's a plaque at the bottom of the steps listing the names of major individuals involved with the undertaking of the project.\n\nWhen you get to the top, there is another non-mosaic steep staircase.  If you venture up that, you get to Granview Park (also known as Turtle Hill) where you can get a 360 degrees view of SF.  On a clear day, you can see forever......", "author": "Ry T."}

Have yet to see it on a clear sunny day. There seems to be a shortage of those here! Each tile is beautiful in itself but as you go up the design flows together. But wait there's more. Your not done yet. Cross the street and go up a couple more stair cases and your in a misty, foggy oasis of a park. Feels like your on top of the world. The views must be amazing on a clear day but again that damn sun shortage here. If your lookin for some exercise or just need to clear your head check it out.", "author": "Lauren N."}

Go see for yourself, you won't be disappointed.\n\n...And while you're at the 16th avenue steps you might as well walk a little bit further and go up to Grand View Park for some spectacular views of the city.  So once you go to the top of the steps you'll be on 15th ave.   Go right a little ways, then go up another staircase (don't worry it's not very long), then you'll go right again to the steps that lead up to the peak of Grand View.  Have fun, enjoy it.

I live nearby, and make a point to go by it as often as possible, especially around sunset.  the colors from the west gleam off the mirrored artwork that make it look surreal.  Try looking at the steps from the ground up, then go small sections up at a time and see how the colors of the sun and sky change off the mirrored artwork, depending on the angle.  The artwork itself is often an interpretation big sweeps of nature that surrounds the region--sun, surf, stars).  The views looking outward of the Pacific, the Marin Coast, and the Golden Gate Bridge are picture perfect.  I hope this doesn't bring the tourists here--tell them there are killer bees living in the succulents if you see them here.", "author": "Ken H."}
