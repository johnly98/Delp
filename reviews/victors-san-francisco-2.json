I always order the veggie super burrito or the mushroom and egg burrito with jalape\u00f1os. The spicy kick takes it to the next level. Sometimes I'll come for breakfast and get the chilaquiles or huevos rancheros. Their house salsas are great. The back patio area is cute too. Overall everything I've had here is good and service is consistent. The woman who rings you up will always without a doubt greet you with a hola guapa/o which completes the experience.\n\nCheese enchiladas are also good if you're having a cheat day. Rents in this part of town is pricey which explains their prices-don't blame them. With the other restaurant next door closing I'm afraid this will be next if we don't keep dining here.

Coming from a person who's guilty of overhyping mediocre restaurants, I know too well the need to have some skepticism. \n\nSure, I've come across a lot of places worthy of infinite praise (https://yelp.to/qTKq/gji3wdyUCP). But more often than not, I've found plenty of sour apples as well.\n\nThe most recent example comes from Victor's, a VERY popular Mexican eatery in the Mission Bay Area part of San Francisco. Despite a negative review from my girlfriend, I reluctantly stopped by a few days ago since I needed to pick up quick food after a volunteer shift. Long story short, I should've just gotten something outside my office at Focaccia...\n\nLocated on 3rd and Townsend Street, Victor's is essentially your standard Mexican food stop. This place served burritos, chimichangas, tacos, nachos, quesadillas, and several plates - all with the usual types of meat such as al pastor and carnitas. The interesting thing about Victor's, however, is that customers have some flexibility in the ingredients that go into each order. Kinda like with Chipotle, you can pick your salsa as well as the type of beans (if any). In terms of cost, I found this place to be pretty average; most items hovered around $8-$10 and for burritos specifically, they charged around an extra dollar for a super (has guac, sour cream, and cheese).\n\nWhen I stopped by, I picked up a Regular Carnitas Burrito with Black Beans and Spicy Salsa. Boy, I really wish I could get back my $10 because the experience was much different from what a lot of my friends had glamorized. First off, I felt like the ratio of ingredients was pretty unbalanced. They gave me a whole bunch of beans and rice, but very little salsa and pork. Secondly, the burrito felt really bland without any sauce. I would've appreciated getting guac or sour cream without paying extra. And most importantly, the pork carnitas was SO LACKING. Although the outsides were sort of crispy, I hated the fact that they came in such large chunks. I really didn't like that one of the cooks half-heartedly cut up the meat. And the flavor just wasn't all the way there, probably since the pork had been sitting there a while (they don't cook it in front of you). In a nutshell, it was more of a Chipotle experience than anything else. \n\nBeyond the bleh food, I can only think of two reasons why I'd have the heart to recommend Victor's to other people. The first being that the location was quite convenient. I mean there's literally nothing else nearby my office/Mission Bay except food trucks and chains (e.g. Tender Greens and Taco Hell). Furthermore, the service was quite genuine, amicable, and heartwarming. I loved that they had a bowl of chips and salsa at the counter where you could nibble on while waiting for your food, and they packed some with each order. Plus, the cashier was VERY friendly! She went on and on talking about her wonderful grandchildren. \n\nTl;dr Victor's to me is a place I'd go to if I had absolutely no other option in the area. It's not bad per say, but among all the Mexican eateries I've had this ranks pretty low. Meh food, but good service so I'd give it a \"Tolerable, sufficient for sustenance\" rating.\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

I didn't leave the assembly line and watched my SBurrito made, since this is my favorite Mexican food meal, I have had Burritos from many different places. The chicken in red sauce I ordered must be a favorite because she had to sift thru the sauce to find pieces. When it was not a lot, I asked the server to ad a little. Moving down, towards the cream etc..  I asked for some lettuce sprinkled inside my burrito (in all fairness, its not listed on the menu as included, nor as an extra ingredient) and when the owner, got my burrito, she actually remarked nice and loud.. \"Thats a BIG burrito, YOU can have TWO lunches, better SHARE that with someone\" Not once, but twice!! Seriously? trying to make me feel bad for getting, what a regular Super Burrito should look like? I have to admit, she got to me and I walked away feeling pretty bad about my food.\n\n\n\n3rd visit: This time, I figured, everyone deserves a 2nd chance. I will simply seek the owner out to talk to her. I got in line and curiously observed three gentlemen's, super burrito's assembly. Much to my surprise, theirs was nice and loaded with goodies. (The way it really should be), none of them had to ask to have some more ingredients added). This made me wonder, is this because I am a woman? \n\nThen its my turn and instead of getting the same treatment, I get the opposite. Near half the amount of rice and refried beans to start with and it continued from there on. I made a small remark about making mine the same as the gentleman before me, but then gave up since the server looked at me confused and irritated. On to the register, here is my chance... \n\nI figured I talk to the owner and the last visit's remark will turn out to be just a big misunderstanding, perhaps an apology, other explanation.. and if not, at least to have her let me talk and listen?\nBoy was I wrong! Here she is raises her voice. (and my burrito) \"THIS is a BIG Burrito\" holding it up like a trophy and facing the crowd behind me. Then she continues on with her rant, not letting me even get a word in and ends with. \"I feel sorry for you\", \"We dont need customers like you\" ,\"bye, bye\". Oh the theatrics! \n\n\nOverall, this somewhat dingy hole in the wall hosts a very dominant, proud, rude and loud owner peddling her overpriced, small Super Burritos.", "author": "Beatrix F."}

Fond memories of our trips to San Francisco remind us of Victor's - a true hole in the wall that can very easily leave a hole in your wallet if you aren't careful.\n\nVictor's charm lies in its simplicity.  Pick the physical form of your lunch, and fill in the blanks as your configuration passes by all of the possible ingredients on the line.  It isn't much different from a Chipotle or Qdoba, is it Zach?  But as any good agent would know, the devil is in the details.  A spicy, succulent devil.\n\nOn our last visit, we chose a burrito adorned with diced beef, pico de gallo, lime and a bit of tomatillo - just enough to cleanse our sinuses as we ate.  The spice factor for both salsas was just right.  The onions dance liberally in the pico de gallo, creating an intriguing twinge.  Why San Francisco can do this so well, and Washington so poorly, is truly a matter worth investigating, right Zach?  But that wasn't all.  The tomatillo proved to be an appropriate delivery agent for the fine beef.  The lime we opted into adding completed the full workup of our taste palette.\n\nPerhaps the enjoyment of this burrito was further enhanced with the friendly demeanor of the food crafters.  The end of our purchase was met with a \"thank you, guapo\", which may be a cheap pleasantry to give your customer.  But it more than worked and brought on a smile.  Nothing about this was suspect, was it Zach?\n\nPerhaps we should stop daydreaming on the subject and get back to the case.

Burritos are turgid and moist.  \n\nI've now become a bit more sophisticated.  I like burritos because of their turgid-ness.  And I also like quesadilla super suiza carne asada!  Power up.

The tortilla is grilled on that awesome grill which I hope has never been washed.  \n\nAnd I hate beans.  I just don't like it.  Is that unamerican of me?  I don't like beans and I don't like peanut butter.  Some days the legume can be more tolerable, which is why I still pledge undying love to the burrito.  But now I have a vibrational alternative that has no beans: quesadilla super suiza carne asada, power up!\n\nI love the salsa here.  There is only 3 kinda, but it gets the trick done.

It also had some sort of avocado-based spread inside.   Delicious, all of it.  Compared to other \"burritos\" I have had, this one was rolled well enough to not come unravelled upon eating, and the flat bread was sufficiently thick to not develop any weak spots or holes during my meal.

Nothing fancy here, but this is a family run joint which does a few things right and sometimes that's all that counts.", "author": "Vincent C."}

Then you go to the hidden seating are, and you see a corridor leading out to a very cool semi-hidden sermi-open air eating area in the back. It's super nice on a bright day, and they somehow manage to keep it warm even on the fiercest, chilly SOMA day.\n\nSo my Al Pastor burrito kind of sucked. The pork was bland and unflavored. That said, everyone else at my table loved their lunch. There was an order of a super Egg and Chorizo burrito, a veggie burrito, and a fish taco. \n\nNo beer :(", "author": "Nikhil B."}

I'm as easy-going as a roach when it comes to the mere appearance of a place, but when my iron stomach talks about the quality of food, y'all best listen.  The breakfast burrito made me throw-up.  As I ate it, I could tell the taste was off. Was it the bacon? Eggs? Was the cooking grease rancid? Were the preparer's bare hands dirty? I couldn't place my finger on it.  An hour and a half later, I'm spewing beans and cilantro into the toilet.  I could taste the grease on its way up.  It was off. Way off.\n\nPrevious review:\nNo amount of \"guapa\" will get me to eat here again.\nI LOVE Mexican food, and tortas and Al Pastor hold a special place in my heart.\nAt Victor's, a torta Al Pastor costs over $6 which is totally unheard of at other taquerias.  The moment I bit into mine, I realized they charge that much so no one will order it! The Al Pastor is a joke of stewed meat in watered-down sauce.  The bread was stale and doughy and they only filled it with about 1/8-cup of meat. LAME.\n\nI want to go back and try the mole, (even though someone in line called it \"mild\"--as if that's a good thing!), but even the salsa here sucked.  The tomatoes tasted canned, though I've been told otherwise. If they use fresh tomatoes, then my salsa fresca had been sitting in the fridge for a long while. I probably won't be back. On top of that, the lady assemblin' my samich used her bare finger to wipe the rim of the refried beans container and dropped what got on her finger back into the mix.  Why did I have to see that? (See my review of Truly Mediterranean for a similarly gross experience). Yuck!\n\nBetter Mexican in the area can be had on South Park. Go there.", "author": "N. L."}

If parking weren't an issue, I'd be there more often.  But anytime i'm on my way out of downtown near lunchtime I find a way to get in here, specifically for the carnitas.  Slightly crispy on the edges and relatively lean, it's the perfect burro filler.  The super friendly guapa at the register makes sure you're greeted with Hola Guapo(a) and feel at home.  Only downside is atmosphere, but the place is clean enough.  Glad to see mijita hasn't taken a bite out of the business.", "author": "Mike S."}

The staff has never been anything but friendly and nice to us, and the admonishments to keep moving are 100% appreciated by anyone in line behind you. \n\nI can't stop loving the nachos. The hot sauce is excellent, the beans are salty, the chips are substantial and stand up to whatever you order, and they will load up the jalapenos if you ask them.  Yum!  \n\nEating in the back seating area reminds of of being in Mexico. It's no garden and the seats are rickety, but it's authentic.  The drinks in the cooler are lukewarm.

They use a tortilla bowl, which is fine, but it tasted like cardboard soaked in grease. After filling the greasy shell with less than adequate portions of beans, meat, lettuce and cheese the lady asked me if I wanted sour cream and guacamole. All other taqueria's that make tostadas this style usually include those two things in the price. Here they are a dollar extra. Had I known, I would not have ordered it, not to mention the guacamole looked like green soup. The burritos are only slightly better. Really the only reason I think people go to Victor's is because of the lack of taqueria's in the SOMA/Southbeach area. Also, the proprietor is one of the most annoying people you will ever meet. Expect to hear her call everyone in line \"guapo\" at least 5 times and then bark an order at the next person in line. At any given visit you will most like hear the word \"guapo\" yelled 50 times or more. You may think the guapo thing is sweet the first time you go there but trust me, it gets real old real fast.

LOVE the staff, and just overall dig the vibe of the place. The price for a regular old burrito isn't to bad either. Granted I've had better burritos in my day, but thats okay, this place gets an A in my book.", "author": "Tony H."}

The cashier tried to convince me that it was a different kind of mole but there didn't appear to be any sauce on the chicken at all.  Perhaps it was a different kind of mole, but in the end it was either terrible service or bad food", "author": "Nathan H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-12-26", "description": "The only time I ever go to Victor's is if the line is too long at Primo's next door.  I agree with others that Victor's is a quick fix for Mexican food.  I think someone summed it up well...\"it is mediocre at best.\"  What compelled me to write a review was an incident on my last trip to Victor's.  It was late afternoon and I was starving.  For some reason I craved for a burrito with all the trimmings and other places were closed.  When I entered Victor's, the lunch crowd was obviously gone as there were only two women behind the counter.  Both were cleaning vigorously as I guess they were in a hurry to go home.   I asked for a super chicken burrito and one of them sprung to action in preparing my meal.  She tossed the old rag aside and proceeded to cut up strips of chicken and heated up the tortilla....all with her bare hands.  She did not wash her hands nor did she put on gloves.  She continued with the cheese, lettuce, and salsa.  I kept thinking that my stomach is pretty resilient so I should be okay.  Besides, I was really starved.  When she finished wrapping my burrito, she took my money and gave me back change....again with her bare hands.  How much money did she handled prior to making my food?  I walked back to my office anxiously waiting to feast.  When I unwrapped the foil, I took the first bite with some hesitation.  I couldn't believe that I would actually take such a risk to overcome hunger.  I got angry at that point....not so much at Victor's but at myself for allowing it to happen.  I stormed back to Victor's and demanded that I get my money back.  The woman had a poker face and refunded my money without protest after my brief venting.  I vowed never to go again.  However, if you must, make sure your food is prepared with clean hands.", "author": "Paul C."}
