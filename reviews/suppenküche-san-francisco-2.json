The space is quite tight and loud, which is fun but also difficult to have conversations.\n\nThe beer menu is great and I had a dunkelweiss. Unfortunately, due to the loud atmosphere the waitress got a couple beer orders wrong. My boyfriend didn't care for the one he received by mistake.\n\nAs for the food, I shared a Brezel with my boyfriend to start. It had some sort of beer cheese dip, which some people thought was like a pimento cheese. For my main, I had the sauerbraten, which the waitress said was really popular. I enjoyed the meat, but lovvved the spaetzel. It's like a combination of macaroni and cheese and gnocchi. This is a must- and if I try another dish that doesn't have it on the side next time, I'm going to ask to substitute.\n\nAt the end of the meal, the server brought out an apple strudel-type dessert for the birthday boy. He generously passed it around and I enjoyed my bite, with some thick whipped cream on top.\n\nOverall, the restaurant offers some delicious traditional German food, and the price is reasonable for the portion sizes. Would recommend for a lively night out.", "author": "Roya B."}

But the waitress had us come in and told us to wait at the bar and she'd get us. \n\nAt the bar, the bartender let me taste a few beers before deciding. The hubs ordered his beer and while signing the receipt/check, he accidentally broke his beer glass. A guy next to us seemed super concerned about his leg but I didn't see any blood or anything, but we of course apologized. The bartender quickly reassured us that 'it's a bier hall' meaning 'it happens' and not to worry about it so much. \n\nShortly thereafter, we were seated at the lash 2 seats of a 6-top. There were 4 women sitting there who kept looking at me as if they didn't know what I was. (??) Any way, I just looked at them and smiled, then when the waiter came by I asked for a bandaid for my hubs who apparently had a cut on his hand from the broken glass. He went to the bathroom to clean up and the waiter brought me a few bandaids (super nice).\n\nOkay, about the restaurant-- the ambience was like a bier hall: funky ceiling decor, loud with folks drinking and celebrating Friday, and an active service scene. \n\nWe order schnitzel and pork sausage with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut. Both were delicious. The schnitzel was amazing with the lemon... and at first the hubs thought he was gonna want mashed potatoes (I assured him I'd have some on my plate he can have), but his potatoes tasted better! \n\nOverall, despite the broken glass on our end, the restaurant was a nice stop after a show @ The Nourse. The service was kind and attentive (which is hard to say for many places that are busy on a Friday) and the food and beer were spectacular.", "author": "Roxane P."}

We recently spent a few nights in the city and decided to stop in.  We were glad we did!\n\nOur party of five started with pickled herring (Hering nach Hausfraunart ...) and German Ravioli (Maultaschen ...).  \n\nThe herring had a surprisingly creamy consistency which went well with the crispy apples, onions. The sour cream cut through any fishiness and allowed the flavors of the salad to come through.  Excellent.\n\nA first for us was the Ravioli.  This was an excellent starter and could be your meal if paired with a soup or salad.  Rather than pasta \"pillows\" with filling, these were \"blankets\" of luscious pasta filled with bits of beef, pork, and veggies that paired perfectly with the mushroom sauce! You must try this.\n\nFor entrees, we went straight to our all-time favorites: Schnitzel and Meatloaf.\n\nSchnitzel (one order was more than enough for two) is two large breaded and sauteed pork fillets, crispy and juicy perfection, served with roasted potatoes and salad.  Again, with a starter, this was a great way for us to start a night of fun.\n\nAs we remember, the meatloaf (Falscher Hase ...) was the best we've had.  Sorry Mom, this meatloaf is on a new level.  A large slab is served over buttery mashed potatoes drizzled in savory onion sauce.  This is an amazing blend of ground meats with sausage spices and bacon that made each bite more satisfying than the first.  I enjoyed this with a draft Kolsch.\n\nWe shared an apple tart for dessert, just a bite or two was all we needed to end an entirely perfect meal!", "author": "Albert Y."}

If you or your group of friends do not enjoy beer and/or wine, I would recommend staying away from Suppenkuche. Even if you do enjoy beer and wine, I would advocate eating dinner elsewhere and then coming here for drinks. This review is written from the perspective of a non-drinker.\n\nI dined here with a large group and had the breaded pork loin with potatoes and was very disappointed with my meal. It was something that felt uninspired, and unoriginal, not much different than diner or cafeteria food. While my friends loved the beer selection here, they agreed that the meals were very one dimensional. At $21, my dish wasn't expensive but if given the opportunity again, I would rather walk over to the many other excellent Hayes Valley restaurants nearby, eat dinner, and then come back with my friends for beers. I wondered in the past why there aren't many other German restaurants and after dining here understand that the simplicity of German food isn't well suited for the restaurant setting especially in a city like San Francisco that has so many other impressive options.", "author": "Andrew H."}

I am no expert in German food, but spaetzel is the most memorable German food to me because it is so nice and chewy.

Great beer. Generous portions of really hearty food. Definitely enjoy it everyone I come here. \n\nThings I've tried:\nGrilled trout \nThe pretzel\nThe spatzel\nThe wild boar sausage\n\nOther than the wild boar sausage, I personally find everything to be really good here. A little bland, but German food often is for my tastes. The quality is always superb and the texture/composition never disappoints. As for the flavor, it's nothing a little salt, mustard and/or some lemon can't wildly improve. The boar sausage on the other hand is really gamey and kind of inconsistently textured. \n\n2 more things to note: \n1. This place is pretty cozy - expect to share a communal table with  strangers if you show up on a popular night. \n2. While it looks fun to order a boot and heartily cheers/clank your boot with someone else's beers, the boots are fragile and if you break one, they cost $50 (+ the cost of beer).", "author": "Quinn Li O."}

The restaurant is not that big but they have lots of tables, which some are family style too.\n\nThe waiter was quite accommodating. We are quite indecisive so we weren't sure what to order.

And then their special pork belly appetizer. The skin was crispy but the meat was tender.

We arrived at the restaurant around 4.30PM and no lines were formed. As time gets closer to 5 pm (opening time) there were at least good 20-30 people. As the time past by 5.30PM you'll have a great chance to wait for a 1-hour wait! So make sure you come before 5.30PM.\n\nAnyway, let's get to the food itself. We ordered German mulled wine, aka, Gl\u00fchwein, (Mulled wine is a traditional warm beverage combined with different spices, red wine, citrus fruits and sugar). Their mulled wine is not overly sweetened and the aroma of the spices was great at the right level! Would recommend this drink to try it out during the winter. They will not serve this beverage during Spring and Summer time as what I heard from the waitress! \n\nWe also ordered the potato pancake. That is like one of the most order starters should be ordering! The saltiness from the potato, sourness from the cream and sweetness from the apple sauce all together have a harmony in your mouth. The balance is great and definitely a delightful dish! Would definitely recommend ordering this to share with friends/family (believed is 3 pieces of potato per plate)\n\nAs for entre, we ordered the pork shoulder and veal (veal is the special for that night or the season (not 100% sure). Personally, I prefer the pork shoulder. The pork shoulder is not overly seasoned and it's not too salty. The flavor is great and the meat was not overly cooked! As for the veal, I believed it's a bit underseasoned. But it was really tender.\n\nLastly, you cannot forget about the cheesecake! Their cheesecake is as good as it can be. Personally, I think it's better than the cheesecake factory.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this place for dinner and/or a place to hang out if all you want to do is to drink!

But surprisingly, it was delicious and yummy. Yes, it was a bit heavy and that's what I was worried with German food this early in the day but if you take it easy, it's amazing! \n\nI had the wild boar which came topped off with an egg and surrounded by delicious potatoes, peppers and a bit of ham. For less than $10, this could easily feed a person. What a steal! It's hard to find good boar in the city and suppenk\u00fcche delivers. \n\nWe also split the Kaiser Schmarrn (emperor's pancake) which came with raisins, plums and other seasonal fruits that made it quite different than the typical French or American style pancake you get at brunch places. It wasn't too sweet which I appreciated. \n\nFor drinks, if you want something different, you can go with their sparking raspberry water (the European in me appreciated the option) or if you want something alcoholic but lighter, they have a lot of beer cocktails such as the Raddler (helles and lemon soda).\n\nThe service was friendly, fast and great.

The slab of wild boar is huge and the two dumplings are the size of baseballs. This is a meal fit for at least three people. Sometimes when given large portions you tend to think that the quality is sacrificed. However, the wild boar was tender and juicy and the dumplings were not overly dense. \n\nBerliner Weisse (Woodruff) - It's a light sweet session drink that has a nice herbal undertone. A great drink to get to compliment all the heavy and savory dishes. \n\nSuppenkuche is a great place for what seems to be traditional German food and ambiance. I can't speak if Suppenkuche is \"truly traditional\" but the flavors do have a homemade comfort food feeling. The portions are large, the beer is good, and the meat is tender. The space is reminiscent of a post WWII Berlin restaurant. It's not large and has a handful of large communal tables where different dining parties sit together. Overall the space is stripped back and bare boned with little decoration. \n\nThe food carries a similar tone to the interior. It's very direct and there won't be any surprises diverging from the menu - what you see is what you get. What you get is very large portions of very heavy food. It's usually a combination of large slabs of meat and dense bread or a version of bread. I suggests ordering a Berliner Weisse which will add a nice refreshing element to the meal as the heaviness from the food does become a bit daunting. \n\nSuppenkuche is a great place to come to hungry.

But since it's in the popular area of Hayes Valley, there's plenty of bars around to hang out and wait. They were able to accommodate my group of 9 at a large table. We only waited around 20 mins to be seated.\n\nWe got the boot, which is a boot shaped glass that holds 2 liters of beer. Apparently they only have ~5 for the whole restaurant, so your whole table will have to share. It's only available in the Pilsner, Helles, and I think dark stout varieties. The price is 4x the size of the .5 liter draft. The beer isn't anything special obvi but you do it for the snapchat lol\n\nAs for food, I recommend the Wiener Schnitzel (breaded and sauteed porkloin), Sauerbraten (braised beef with cranberries), and Gegrillte N\u00fcrnberger Bratwurst (pork sausages). They're all around $20 and come with 2 sides. The spatzle was good and the red cabbage was vinegary.. which I liked.\n\nThere's only 2 bathrooms for men and women.. don't wait until you really have to pee to wait in line.", "author": "Sally L."}

If you have a large party of six or greater, than I would advise you to get a reservation because this place is small so the wait will be long (for sure over an hour). My favorite beer here is their bananaheizen (a mixture of hefeweizen with banana juice). It is so good! Smooth and easy to drink but each party is ONLY allowed to order ONE German boot. The German boot itself is equivalent to 2-liter of beer. As a petite size girl, I finished 1.5-liter of beer by myself so I would recommend ordering at least the 1-liter if you are a beer drinker. The servers here are excellent, and they will give you samples of draft beer upon request. \n\nNow, my favorite dish here is their Saut\u00e9ed Trout in Lemon Butter Sauce with Boullion Potatoes and Spinach. Something about their sauce just goes so well with the potato and fish. Their potato pancakes with homemade apple sauce and the Grilled Pork Sausage with Sauerkraut and Mashed Potatoes are pretty good too!

Overall, really good and brought me right back in Europe.\nI tried my wife's dish and the pork loin was a surprise (I expected veal) but very smooth and tender. The roasted potatoes were perfectly cooked (crisp outside and tender inside). Again a great dish, with the European level of quality I was expecting.\n\nThen, we had a sour sherry pie slice with whip cream for dessert that we shared. Very good too!\n\nAlso, the beer we each chose were served in the right glass - I am not a beer snob but I believe that if German and Belgium brewery created their own glass, it is because using them will deliver the best experience while tasting their beer.

For all other number of guests, reservation is not an option. If you get there early, once you put your name on the waitlist you can wait by the bar area and order drinks ahead of time. \n\nWe had ordered:\n- Pretzel with Obtazda ($8) - the pretzel comes out warm, it's toasty on the outside and soft on the inside. Really good bread!!! The obtazda is some type of curd cheese that's been soften? At first I thought it was a weird mixture but ended up liking it\n- Potato Cakes with Apple sauce, sour cream and chives ($12.50) - not sure how to eat this at first. We had ordered this because every single table there had this exact dish. After several different dipping process I decided that the best way to eat this is dip the potato into sour cream then coat it with the apple sauce. This was my favorite dish here tonight\n- Breaded and saut\u00e9ed porkloin ($19.50) - out of all the mains, this is definitely the favorite!! I'm not a big fan of pork but this is very well cooked. The meat is tender, tasty and crisped on the outside. \n- Saut\u00e9ed porkloin in mushroom sauce ($20.50) - although I love mushroom sauce, this was my least favorite dish. Everything is cooked very well, but for some reason it just didn't click with me\n- Grilled Pork Sausage, Sauerkraut and mashed potatoes ($19.50) - I'm not a big fan of sauerkraut so I asked the waiter if they can switch it out with a salad. Super happy that they obliged! Also not a fan of mustard so I used the apple sauce from the appetizer earlier and wow, it tastes really really good!!

I didn't have the best experience here, either with the service or the food. I've been wanting to come here for awhile, and I don't blame others for wanting to, but I wouldn't recommend it. First of all, make a reservation. They're available for parties of 6 or more. Unfortunately, there were only 3 of us, which put us at a disadvantage. We put our names down for dinner then went back outside to stand in the cold dark. Slowly, we saw large parties go inside and get seated. Low key annoying.\n\nWe were eventually placed at a communal table. It was loud and dark inside the restaurant, and generally I didn't care for the vibe. The wide beer selection was the best part, though our bartender was apathetic about making recommendations. So useless. For food, I ordered the pork loin in mushroom sauce. My boyfriend had the trout in butter-lemon caper sauce. I found both to be tasteless and dry. Also, the trout had too many pesky bones for me to eat enjoyably.\n\nThe portions were hearty, and I appreciate the limited, specialized menu, but the quality just isn't what I was looking for. I have my favorite German restaurants in San Francisco, and I was hoping to add Suppenk\u00fcche to that list, but it ended up being quite disappointing. Sounds like I'm being generous with my 3 stars, but honestly if it wasn't so busy and cramped, I would love to come back to enjoy some German beers.

First, the things to like: the appealing spartan decor and seating and the small, but well selected, variety of German beers.\n\nWhat not to like? THE FOOD. I had no idea when or how the food became an afterthought of this restaurant, but it was lacking. \nTasteless, no care or love in the preparation, combined with tough meats and an overall lack of freshness.\nBland and without distinction; Suppenk\u00fcche is not serving German food. The meals that my wife and I received were no better than what you might get at a smorgasbord like SF's Tommy's Joynt, but at twice or three times the cost. \n\nHaving lived and studied in Germany, I am well-versed in traditional German dishes. Merely slapping together a recipe which has a German name (J\u00e4gerschnitzel, Sauerbraten, K\u00e4sesp\u00e4tzle, etc.), but not taking the time and care to prepare it properly, and without proper seasoning, is NOT the way Germans prepare these dishes (at home or in restaurants). \nThere was no depth to the food here; no soul-satisfying taste to make it distinctive (as Germans pride their food to be), and there certainly wasn't a freshness to it (another hallmark of German cuisine). We were served our dishes about 10 minutes after they were ordered, Suppenk\u00fcche has become an assembly line of mediocre fare.  \n\nOne of the reasons I like to go our to eat is to have meals, well prepared, with distinction, by chefs who bring expertise and knowledge to their craft. None of that was present any longer at Suppenk\u00fcche. \nIt is disappointing to go out to dinner only to discover that you would easily be able prepare the same dishes at home, and that they would be far superior to anything Suppenk\u00fcche is offering.\n\nIf you have the misfortune of eating at Suppenk\u00fcche, please know that it does NOT represent actual German cuisine; it is just a shadow of it by using some of the ingredients combined with the German names of the dishes. \n\nSorry, but unless only for a beer, I won't be returning to Suppenk\u00fcche again. Instead I will be seeking out German restaurants in the Bay Area that know what they are doing and care about the quality and taste of the food they serve.\n\nThe service, however, was attentive and friendly.", "author": "Bryce A."}

The waitress was pretty on point and the food was good if not particularly memorable but the beers and wine were decent. \n\nWe were surprised when we got the bill cos it was about 30 dollars a head so we walked out after paying but later realised that someone on the wait staff had messed up and had billed the two tables separately and another friend had to cover the extra $250 that they hadn't given us on the first bill. Such a hassle. \n\nI'm actually really annoyed by this because they knew that the two tables were an entire party and the first bill I ended up paying stated the number of people in the party so not sure why they would separate the bill on the two tables but it was not a great way to end the night.", "author": "Eunah T."}

Traditionally, J\u00e4gerschnitzel is prepared by pounding the cutlets so they are thin, breading the cutlets, and frying them, then topping them with a mushroom sauce. I've had it at Suppenk\u00fcche before and this is how they prepare it. \n\nThis time, they apparently just pan seared a pork chop that was was cut in half and topped it with mushroom sauce. When I told the waiter I wanted to send it back and have it prepared the way J\u00e4gerschnitzel is normally prepared--just like Wienerschnitzel-- he argued with me and said this is the way J\u00e4gerschnitzel is always prepared. I informed that I lived in Austria for two years and it's not prepared like this, and in fact I've had it prepared the right way at Suppenk\u00fcche in the past. \n\nHe took it back and returned a few minutes later. The cook just took the same chops off my plate, fried them, and poured the mushroom sauce over them. It wasn't pounded thin. At that point I just gave up and ate it. \n\nAnother person in our party orders the sauerbraten and it was a tiny portion. He wasn't happy about that. \n\nI ordered a side of Kn\u00f6deln (a dumpling of sorts), something I very much enjoyed when I lived in Austria. These ones were heavy, pasty, and flavorless. \n\nOn the other hand the pork knuckle, potato pancakes, and gemischte Salat were all terrific. \n\nAs disappointing as this visit was I will give it another try at some point.

I found myself dipping it in mustard and wishing it came with some sort of gravy. I would substitute mashed potatoes next time to compensate for the dryness. Portions are large (2 pieces of schnitzel) and enough to share even though I finished it all with the exception of sharing a few bites. \n- My boyfriend ordered the grilled pork sausage and he seemed to enjoy it.

I'm a peace and quiet type myself, so Suppenkuche was not really my kind of place.\n\nI arrived early enough so it was busy but not packed. I got a seat in a row opposite the bar, facing away. The server kept calling me \"young lady\" even when I pointed out I have not been a \"young\" lady for a good many years (I'm 63). One of the specials was asparagus with hollandaise appetizer. Hollandaise is not classically German but I like it and asparagus is one of my favorite vegetables. Menu said it came with \"cured egg\". Asked server the difference between a cured egg and one that is still sick. He didn't get the joke. He said the egg was part of the sauce.\n\nSpeaking of sauce, it seemed all the sauces on the various entrees were cream-based which I don't like, so got schnitzel. Very generous portion. Meat was tasty, potatoes a bit dry and bland. Side salad was butter lettuce, with a good dressing. Ordered a glass of Austrian wine on server's recommendation.\n\nAnd the place got fuller and fuller. People who were waiting for tables packed themselves into the small space between the row of seats where I was and the bar. Made it virtually impossible to get attention of server, I felt hemmed in, even mildly anxious. And LOUD. A man directly behind me kept shouting right in my ear. Was this a restaurant or a baseball game?\n\nAsked for apple streusel cake. Very few desserts should be served ice cold. Even ice cream, especially if premium, should come out of the freezer for a few minutes. The cake was ice cold. I mean ice cold. It had clearly been plated directly out of a refrigerator. Streusel cake is best slightly warm. I know they were busy, but 1 minute in microwave would have made a huge difference. Ice cold crust was so hard I could not cut through it with spoon and had to pick up and bite. \n\nOK, I can now say I've tried German food.

It's hard to decouple it from the total rating though since I'm sure it was a unique situation, but here I go. \n\nI came to Suppenkuche with a fairly large party. They were great about letting us make reservations ahead of time and the process, though antiquated because we had to call, was relatively painless. When we showed up a bit too early, we just hung out at the bar and grabbed drinks, and then they let us sit pretty soon after.\n\nThe good:\nI thought the food here was tasty, as was the beer. It's pretty much what I would have expected coming to a German style restaurant. I had a delicious Pilsner, and the pork schnitzel with spaetzle. I loved that they let you swap sides, as the spaetzle entree looked delicious but I wanted a bit of protein with my meal. The schnitzel felt a bit dry to me, but I am no expert of German food and xchnitzel has generally always tasted dry to me. The dish also came with a salad that was surprisingly tasty. I don't even like leaves, but these tasted pretty darn good. Overall, I was having a five star experience up to here. The food was good, the atmosphere is great, and it's just a wonderful environment to hang out with friends over delicious food. \n\nthe bad:\nThey overcharged my party by around $50... that's no joke. If you overcharge by a drink... I could maybe let it slide. But $50?? They put two additional plates on our receipt. It was our fault for not detecting it and resolving it in the restaurant, but one of my friends called afterwards and the issue was never resolved... and that felt really shitty to me as a customer. I understand that mistakes get made, especially when you're in a really busy restaurant and there's a large party, but overcharging by such a significant amount of money is no joke. Our party probably could have been ore aggressive in getting the money back and calling them more, but it's just such a hassle and pain that it's almost not worth it.\n\nI don't think my bad experience will necessarily deter me from coming back because the food was so good and the atmosphere is great, but I guess my warning is more, if you have a large party, just remember to check your receipt so this doesn't happen to you!", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Our waiter told us they normally only allow one boot per table, but given the size of our group, he managed to squeeze in one more for us (much appreciated!). They hold onto your credit card in case any damages occur. I handled that boot like Cinderella's glass slippers and couldn't breathe normally until the busboy came by to take it away (thank goodness). I'm not much of a beer person, but I really enjoyed the Oktoberfest (and that's not because it came in a boot). \n\nThe food was heavenly. Had the sliced lamb chops in a truffle butter sauce that came with mixed veggies and potato pancakes (normally comes with potato au gratin, but substituted the potato pancakes in). The lamb chops were cooked on the outside and reddish-pink in the center - a perfect medium rare! Plus, I loved how they were served it with the bones so I could continue gnawing on them to get every last morsel. The truffle butter sauce only made the dish that much better and even made the vegetables taste divine! The potato pancakes came with a side of applesauce, a combination I am not familiar with, but that definitely rocked my world.

It's filling, warm, comforting.\n\nEqually good when on the menu is the roast chicken and dumpling. I want it back on the menu. Really badly. \n\nThe goose is also.... Well just woah. Where else can you get goose? Much less well done????\n\nAlthough I don't eat pork, I hear good things about the jaeger snitzchel, which comes with a creamy mushroom sauce. \n\nIf you're in the market for an appetizer, get the pretzel. The cheese sauce is cold, but savory.\n\nAnd you can't beat the beer selection. Just come here. You won't regret it.", "author": "Adriana A."}

It's my favorite drink now.\n\nI would recommend everything we got:\n\n1. Pretzel with Bavarian cheese - Bavarian cheese is a mix of soft cheese and either butter or cream cheese.  It's not everyone's cup of tea but it's delicious.\n\n2. Pickled herring with sauerkraut, beets, carrots, cabbage, butter leaf lettuce, and a perfectly soft potato.  The pickled herring was the perfect texture and the flavor wasn't too strong in any way.  I would highly recommend this.\n\n3. Roasted pork with sauerkraut and dumpling - To me, the dumpling was the STAR of this plate.  I thought it would be just like a plain piece of dough to serve as a side, but it's more like round meatball with many spices and herbs.  \n\n4. Marinated and braised beef with lingonberries, red cabbage, and sp\u00e4tzle - Beef almost tasted like it was braised in wine (which it probably wasn't) but it had the same depth that is both hearty and comforting.\n\nThe bartender helped us pick a drink based on a series of questions; I appreciated the effort.

I didn't know what to expect and didn't think I would be a huge fan of German food but I ended up really enjoying both the veal schnitzel and potato pancakes. The food is pretty heavy (schnitzel also came with potatoes) which depending on your take either helps to soak up some of the alcohol or simply prevents you from getting your buzz on. I was very fond of the cucumbers (pickles?) that came with the schnitzel - a nice and refreshing palate cleanser between all of the bites of fried tastiness.\n\nThe atmosphere is laid back but loud, and when it's crowded they will seat tables with multiple parties.

I'm talking 17 yrs of fierce loyalty including birthday celebrations, dinners with out of town guests, and the occasional brunch (cuz beer in the morning!). We schlepped our babies here once we moved to the suburbs. We get there at 4:50 for the first seating. We bring ear plugs for the kids now grown. But last week they let us down. We hadn't been since the summer (which is rare cuz we never miss the gluhwein in December). You see, we lived in Heidelberg, GE for a few years and when we found Suppenkuche we were ecstatic!  The only place we found that did schnitzel right, thin and crispy and as big as a plate. The germischte salat was perfect, the bread...dark with the crust that sticks in your teeth, the chive butter and the butter lettuce salad! All of it! Like stepping into the gasthaus we loved!  But then they went and CHANGED it. I should have known something was up. First it was the Bretzel, 1 not 2 anymore. Ok, no big deal, I like to put the extra cheese on my bread. I asked the waiter for bread, \"we are out of bread and we have to charge for it now\" huh? No bread?!  Ok, then the meal comes. The schnitzel is thick, like a pork chop (what the..?) the gravy on the jagerschnitzel was smoky (no!).  The last straw was when I asked for the abfelstruddel. The abfelstruddel that my kids literally fight over when they have to share it (I'm talking elbows flying and spoons wars). Waiter: \"We don't have it anymore\" Me: \"ok, what about the Black Forest cake\" Waiter: \"no, but we have a killer cheesecake\" Me: \"huh?! Ok wth is going on?!  The schnitzel is thick, no bread, I'm distraught!\" Waiter: \"well we have a new chef. I've been giving him feedback about the schnitzel\" \nI just sat their with my mouth hung open and tears in my eyes. No abfelstruddel? So I ordered another beer, cuz that's still good, and drowned my sorrows. It took me days to get over this. I guess this is what happens as you get older.

The interior is decorated and laid out quite nicely, but still leaves a comfortable and somewhat casual feel to it. My group had a reservation and was seated in a room towards the back where there were long wooden tables with some small candles on them.\n\nLooking at the menu, I really had no idea what any of the food was, but given that two of my friends knew the German language and the food/culture, I knew I was in for a treat. We started off the night with some pretzels to share. I thought the pretzels on their own weren't really that special, but with the addition of their mustard and creamy cheese, it was a delight to eat. The cheese had a very unique texture and flavor to it, being quite creamy and having a nice pungent kick to it reminding me of certain fermented foods.\n\nAfterwards, a whole lot of dishes landed onto our table at once. Without going through dish by dish, I would generally say that the pickled vegetables were the highlight of my meal. Most of the meat dishes come with it and they also have some salads with a variety of them. They have a nice acidic sour punch to them that makes them interesting. The starches of the meal were quite interesting as well. Their sp\u00e4tzel was on point. It looks like scrambled eggs from a distance and has a nice doughy consistency to them with a rather neutral taste. The potato pancakes had a nice outer hash brown like crisp to them and went surprisingly well with the applesauce served with it. Other than that, I thought the meats and fish were cooked rather well, but tasted fairly typical. It were the various sauces such as mustard and cranberry sauce that added to the meat to make them memorable.", "author": "Joshua M."}

First time I had a poor experience, and second time didn't get much better.\n\nFood: less than palatable. All the meats are soaked in salt, it seems. And if a place can't serve good meat why would you go there? \n\nService: very rushed, to their credit they do try to get to you in time but it's just too busy. The wait generally ranges from 10-30 minutes before they seat you on an average night. \n\nAtmosphere: it's dank, dark, cramped, and not pleasant to dine there. Somewhere between a bar and barn, this place isn't somewhere I'd take family, friends, or a date. There are far better places in this city. \n\nDrinks: they have a very good selection and mix them well. I had  a banana beer and it was the tastiest part of my dinner, which is why this review earns 2 stars. \n\nEach time I come here I have to navigate the menu to find something palatable. Usually my friends and I encounter a 15 min on average wait and expect a 25-40 dinner tag.

My boyfriend and I love German food, and we've had a couple other places scattered around the bay, but this place really takes the cake thus far. \n\nI don't believe they take reservations. There was already a line outside even before they opened! So, if you don't like waiting, show up early, because there might be a bit of a wait just 30 minutes after they open. \n\nWe passed on the beer, since we drank earlier at Japantown's annual Cherry Blossom Festival. We went straight for the food. After careful consideration, we ordered 2 specials--the bacon-wrapped asparagus with potato covered in a lemon butter sauce, and the roasted dumpling-filled half chicken with potato pancakes--the meatloaf, and the salad.\n\nStarting out with delicious complimentary bread and herb butter, we quickly filled up on the asparagus and half of the salad. The lemon butter that covered the asparagus was so good, we ended up sopping a bit of it up with bread. The salad consisted of lettuce topped with a variety of tangy cabbage, beets, shredded carrots, and potato salad. The tanginess of the salad really balanced out the flavors for the rest of the meal.\n\nWe thought we weren't going to be able to eat the entrees, but once the meatloaf and chicken arrived, it was bite after bite of amazing foodgasm. The potato pancakes taste like amazingly crispy hash browns. I was in love with the creamy mashed potatoes and the savory meatloaf--comfort food at its best. The chicken was moist, and the skin was crispy. I only got a bite or two in, because my boyfriend devoured that chicken dish so fast, he might as well had inhaled it.\n\nBookmark this place!

The j\u00e4ger schnitzel is not breaded for some reason, which is a disappointment, as that's what I'm here for. \nThe service is really good in general. The main downside though is that the tables are very close together. If you're only two you'll most likely sit near bar and it's not very comfortable- no leg room for tall people.

Or, well, I say it's hard, but a number of the ones we had actually came out slightly burnt and bitter.\n\n* Herring Salad - This one can probably be put on me, because the texture of the herring was a lot like that of sashimi, which I'm not really a fan of. Texture aside, the flavors of the overall dish weren't bad.\n\n* Meatloaf - I was one of those weird kids that liked meatloaf, so I have a tendency to try it when I see it on the menu. Good flavors all in all, but a bit too salty and plain to me: I mean, yes, there's a lot of flavor in the meatloaf itself, but all the plate is is a slice of meatloaf and a heaping of mashed potatoes, which'll run you $18.50.\n\nSo, the real issue here is highlighted by the last item above: it's not that Suppenkuche is bad, it's just that it's not good enough for me to justify going again, given the prices. If not for what I consider to be slightly poor value, they'd qualify for a low three stars instead.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - There's a large single step ledge at the entrance, which can be traversed with the aid of a somewhat narrow, portable steel ramp that the staff can bring outside for you. If you're not with a group of friends, I suspect you'd have to try your luck either flagging down a stranger to fetch an employee, or calling their main number to have them bring it out. The inside itself is a bit on the crowded side, and getting to your table may necessitate having to ask some people to shift around.\n\nBathroom - As far as I could tell, the only restrooms they had had incredibly narrow entrances, and were not accessible whatsoever.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Suppenkuche has oft been raved about by members of my crew, but I never even knew where or how awesome it was. The vibe is modern and chic, the staff is friendly and attentive. I've frequented the sister bar, Biergarten hella times, but was very excited to try the food at the restaurant.\n\nEamon B, Jeremy P, Ally S, and I arrived early and started on our first boot, dark bread and chive butter, and warm soft pretzels with cheese. The appetizer was super good, and we played the boot game were you can't set down the glass, can't have the toe pointing at you, and have to flick the glass before you pass it - very fun. I got splashed in the face and everyone got a good laugh. We even got an applause from the rest of the folks in the back room where we sat for embarking on such a large boot de brew.\n\nAlly S and I shared the Kartoffelsuppe (Potato Soup) which was comforting and delicious. For my main I had the Veal which I think was one of the specials of the evening. It was bomb digginty! My mom used to make my dad veal a lot when I was a youth, but Italian-style and over pasta with lots of homemade spaghetti sauce. But she and my pops don't eat meat no mo', so I must either learn how to re create this dish, or just head to Suppenkuche because their veal was off the charts. Served with a pickled cucumber and tomato salad and over a bed of roasted potatoes and lardons. Om nom nom. HUGE portions. \n\nI also tried the Potato Pancake from Jeremy's meal and some of the Roasted Chicken from Eamon's. The chicken seemed to be a real hit at our table with most of the folks ordering that. My friend Aaron W got the Falscher Hase mit Zwiebelso\u00dfe und Kartoffelbrei (Meatloaf wrapped in BACON and EGG!) with Mashed Potatoes, and we really didn't hear from him until he came back up from polishing off the whole plate. \n\nNeedless to say, it was an epic meal from beginning to end and I hope to be back soon.

The common comment amongst us though was that we found them a tad too greasy.  The apple sauce was nice though and, greasy or not, we finished them.\n\nI hadn't had wiener schnitzel since going to Leavenworth, the little German town in Washington, not the Fort variety.  The Suppenkuche version was Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein mit Bratkartoffeln und Gr\u00fcnem Salat ($19.50 Breaded and Saut\u00e9ed Porkloin with Roasted Potatoes & Green Salad).  It was also super crispy, like the potato pancakes, but what's it take to get veal anywhere?  When I make it myself from a legit recipe I found, I use a nice and tender veal.  The meat here could have been anything with a nice crispy breading.\n\nThe potatoes on my plate were diced so it was a nice change from the pancakes and the salad had a nice and light vinegar dressing a la Italian style dressing.\n\nThe restaurant was packed for dinner and the place got noisy.  We had 2 kids with us and apparently it was deafening for them.  If you want to take a date here and actually get to know one another, here's where an exception to texting might be okay.

At least that was the case when I came back home to the bay. We'd toss out some dinner ideas only to have them impulsively tossed back along with an \"I've had it before.\" haha \n\nAnd that's how I found myself here. My friend and I arrived about 15-20 mins after opening and Suppenkuche was already packed! Moreover, we were told the wait was an hour! I didn't feel like looking for another place so I decided to wait it out. \n\nWas it worth the wait?\n\nYou bet your sweet ass it was! The food was quite heavy and filling but that worked out perfectly on a cold December San Francisco night. My dinning companion was really feeling like comfort-food so she ordered the meatloaf and mashed potatoes ($18.50) which had bacon and egg and was topped with onion gravy. The meatloaf was super delicious and the bacon really came through. The mashed potatoes were rich and smooth. But it was the gravy that brought it all together.\n\nAs for me, I ordered the weiner schnitzel ($19.50) which were breaded pork loins with roasted potatoes and a side salad. Man, that was tasty. The pork had great texture and I loved the crunch on the outside but there wasn't a whole lot of moisture inside (though it wasn't dry). Then I realized that Suppenkuche actually gave me a couple lemon wedges! T'was buried under the pork loins haha. It worked out perfectly and brightened the flavor. The potatoes were rustic and I liked that they added substantial pieces of bacon. However, that side salad seemed rather half assed as it looked like someone cut a wedge of lettuce (just a wedge) and doused it with a simple dressing. We both thought that was funny.     \n\nAll in all, I am a fan of suppenkuche and I will be back at some point.

When you walk in, there's a velvety curtain that separates the waiting area from the dining area. The moment the curtains open, you are literally in the dining room. They have a small bar towards the back side of the dining room. They serve the full menu at the bar and the bartenders are all very fun and nice. Its busy, lively, vibrant, romantic and cozy. Communal seating is their thing. A table of 4 will seat 2 random couples, a table of 6 will seat a group of 4 mixed with a group of 2. This may be a little awkward but trust me, once you start drinking and eating, you'll forget all about this set up and might even make few new friends!\n\nFOOD\nReibekuchen mit hausgemachtem Apfelmus (Potato Pancakes with Homemade Apple Sauce). This is to die for!!! Super crispy on the outside and chewy with the perfect amount of salt on the inside. Their homemade apple sauce is amazing and goes so well with the mouth watering potato cakes! \nKassler vom Grill mit Sauerkraut und Kartoffelbrei (Grilled Cured Pork Chop with Sauerkraut & Mashed Potatoes) Its HAM cooked to perfection!. I'n not a huge fan of sauerkraut HOWEVER, i'll eat it here!. it has the perfect amount of seasoning and \"sourness\" where its not overpowering other things i'm eating with it. Mashed Potato is creamy and once you put a spoonful into your mouth it just melts. If you want, you can actually substitute the mashed potatoes for the Potato Pancakes.\nFew other things to note - their Sp\u00e4tzle is the BEST and Wiener Schnitzel is two thumbs up! \n\nDRINKS\nBeers Beers Beers! so many variety to choose from. if you're not too familiar with german / Austrian / Belgianbeers beers, ask the servers/bartenders. All of their suggestions has hit home run with me! Want something different ? try their BANANA BEER! it tastes just like a Banana Smoothie! I'm not a beer drinker but this! i'll always order when i'm here! They also serve their beers in a boot. Perfect for a large group to share.\n\nOVERALL\nif you don't mind waiting, check this place out ! it's definitely worth trying!

It's packed.' We entered anyway, flagged down a server, and she proceeded to walk us to a table with two other couples, and whadda ya know? They have communal sitting here! Comeuuup. We urgently accepted the seats and a minute later some random dude comes out of nowhere to bring us bread (Uh dude, were you watching us? 0.o). Impressive service despite how busy it was. \n\nMehr Bier, Bitte!: More beer, please! \n\nWe ordered a liter of a regional German specialty, Gravensteiner, (unfiltered, unpasteurized lager) for $16.00. The golden-colored Gravensteiner was smooth, crisp, and had a soft taste. Its brightness paired well with the rich and heavy flavors of our entrees. Shout out to our server, Stefi, for recommending this one. \n\nHau Rien!: Dig in! \n\nAgain, despite how busy it was our food came out ASAP. I went for the saut\u00e9ed Venison Medallions in Red Wine Plum Sauce with Red Cabbage & Sp\u00e4tzle ($22.00), while my significant ordered the Sauteed Trout in Lemon Butter Sauce with Bouillon Potatoes & Spinach ($17.50). \n\nTHE VENISON\n\nThe venison was lavishly drenched in its red wine plum sauce, which gave it a sweet and tart flavor. The meat itself was eh, kinda chewy, similar to a skirt steak. I favored the meat towards the center of the venison, as it was delicately tender, and less chewy than the surrounding meat. Unfortunately, I would rather eat a medium-rare rib-eye steak. :( The red cabbage that accompanied the dish was too sour for my liking. The fluffy pillows of chewy Sp\u00e4tzle on the other hand, were a splendid side for the venison. Similar to the texture of gnocchi, the Sp\u00e4tzle, was doughy and light. You could say that the Sp\u00e4tzle was an upgraded version of macaroni. The dish also came with extra red wine plum sauce, that I did not pour onto my venison, as the existing amount of sauce on the venison was sufficient. \n\nTHE TROUT\n\nThee underdog of all entrees served here, as most patrons overlook this one. Mmm those luscious Bouillon Potatoes though. The creamy and buttery potatoes reminded me of a slightly firmer mash potato side. I guess I got too excited about them potatoes though, because I almost forgot to commend the exquisitely moist trout. The skin of the fish was notably crisp and provided additional flavor. Squeeze the lemon all over the trout for a slightly fresher, livelier taste. \n\nWo finde ich die Toiletten?: Where can I find the toilet?\n\nThe result?

Sunday nights out could be pretty busy, so we anticipated that. We called up Suppenkuche to check how long the wait was, and the waitress mentioned that there were still open tables left, and that we would not need to wait. \n\nWe walked over there in a minute since we were in the area, but the host told us to wait about 20 mins (lol.. ok.). We proceeded to the bar to try some of their beer (from what we heard, the beer is good).\n\nMy boyfriend got a sour ale, which was super tasty, and a few of my friends got the porter with a coffee base. Overall, the beer was bold tasting, and good.\n\nWe got seated pretty soon, but the waiter told us how to be seated so that they can fit other people into our table too. First off, it's awkward to be told how to be seated, and secondly, we were a group of five that was squeezing into a table that was probably made for 4. \n\nAnother couple walked in and got seated into our table. Being seated in the specific positions our waiter suggested and having another group within our table made the flow of the conversation within our friends pretty awkward. We then politely asked the couple if they wanted to trade seats so that they can be closer to each other, and that our group can keep our conversation within ourselves. \n\nFrom there, the experience still did not get better. It took us forever to flag down a waitress. It took forever to get our food. I even asked our waitress where our food was. Towards the end of our wait, we were pretty cranky.\n\nAnyway, about the food:\n- Pork Sausage - This was good, but not outstanding. I don't know how to describe it-- it was limp. And not juicy. I did like the sauerkraut though.\n- Sauteed Porkloin in Mushroom Sauce - Pork was dry. Cuts were thin. I was still hungry afterwards\n- Salad (the one that came with my porkloin dish)- One of the best salads I've ever had. I think this wins, but it's freaking sad because I came here for German food, but their best item was their salad. *face palm*\n- Trout - Ok seriously though, the trout was better than the sausages.

We shared a table with some people who were, let's just say, less than ideal to become long time friends with, but it good go the opposite way, too.\n- Food and service were good. I wouldn't say either were out of this world, but good. I got the venison and my wife got the sausage platter. Hers was much better than mine, so maybe I just picked the wrong thing (wasn't a fan of the sweet cabbage, but that's probably just a personal preference).\n\nNot so great\n- The wait to get a seat. The 1.5 hour wait itself isn't their fault. In fact, it's probably a good sign. However, most places nowadays offer to take your number and text/call when a table is available. This would be especially helpful due to their bar being extremely small. There are tons of places in the area to grab a drink, so it'd be awfully helpful to be able to do so without fear of missing your table. It also seems like it would help the staff out as well. I'm sure there are instances where wait times are misquoted and people aren't there, then get upset when they come back to check and find out they missed their name.\n- Again, food and service were good, but not great. Maybe I just expected much more based on how everyone talks about this being *the* german place to go to.\n\nAfter my first experience at Suppenk\u00fcche, I much prefer Leopold's (which I've only been to once as well). I would say that Suppenk\u00fcche might be more fun if you have a large party and Leopold's if it's just 2 of you (smaller tables).

The staff and bartenders are very knowledgeable of what's on the menu. Here's proof:  my fianc\u00e9 didn't know what kind of beer he wanted. Our amazing server with an amazing mustache asked what the fianc\u00e9 was feeling for, which was \"dark and heavy, but not hoppy\". The server replied, \"I know what you want. Trust me.\" He came back with an Ayinger Celebrator Dopplebock and my god, it was delicious and on point what the fianc\u00e9 wanted. I had the Radler and it was quite refreshing.\n\nFood: \nAppetizer: Potato Pancakes with homemade Apple Sauce (Rating: 4/5) - crispy and delicious. The potato pancakes is a little saltier than my preference but luckily the apple sauce is there to balance it out.\n\nEntree: \"Sauerbraten\", Marinated and braised Beef with Cranberries served with Red Cabbage & Sp\u00e4tzle (Rating: 4.5/5) - NOTE: Portions are HUGE! My fianc\u00e9 and I shared this dish and without asking the server, he had requested to split our dish into two so we didn't have to share off from one plate. It was really nice of them to do that without charging us the split fee and each plate looked like a complete full plate! The beef was so tender and delicious with the cranberry sauce. The sp\u00e4tzle...oh the sp\u00e4tzle...is my favorite of all on this dish. The only feedback I would have about this dish is that there was a lot of red cabbage. If there were more sp\u00e4tzle and less red cabbage, this dish would absolutely perfect.\n\nLastly the service at Suppenk\u00fcche  - awesome. Period.", "author": "Kelly T."}

While it does get very busy on weekends and evenings, on my latest visit with a party of 3, we were sat immediately on arriving around 7pm on a Wednesday. \n\nThe wait staff here know their stuff and can recommend and describe dishes and drinks well. The food seems pretty traditional (to the extent of my limited knowledge of German food), and has always been tasty in my experience. The serving sizes are pretty substantial also. I've gotten the wiener schnitzel and meatloaf and have gone home with at least half of the dishes leftover. \n\nThey do the whole \"drink out of a big boot-shaped glass\" thing, but they also have a range of sizes, including a more petite pour. It doesn't feel like a touristy gag to me. \n\nA big bonus for me is the location. I love the Hayes Valley neighborhood and have spent many a perfect evening there with a good meal at Suppenkuche and a stroll around the block to peep in at the myriad boutiques (shoe store, cards/gifts, clothing, leather goods, travel, etc.) followed by a night cap or ice cream from Smitten.", "author": "Rachel Y."}

You might end up sitting with random people and you'll have to speak up because there is just so much going on in here. It seems like an excellent place to eat great German food or even grab some beers.\n\nWell, we ended up sitting by the bar and Craig was phenomenal with us. He has such great knowledge of beer and great attitude. He made our dining experience so much fun and introduced us to several great beers! My favorite was the Hefeweisen Dunkel. Craig truly made us feel welcomed. \n\nThe food was pretty delicious too! I was a bit sad that they only serve chicken schnitzel on Sundays but our experience here made up for it.

We had 6 people in our party, arrived a little past 5:10pm, and were seated immediately/took up a whole table. Woohoo! No wait. (I've heard waiting can take a while especially on weekends). If you have smaller parties, you may have to share a communal table with another party. So get friendly!\n\nWHAT YOU SHOULD GET:\n1) Pretzels (with cheese and red onion)--Freshly baked right out the oven. They are so soft and fluffy inside, eating it with the cheese is to die for already. Ugh...mouth is watering. In addition, adding bits of the red onion to the cheese & pretzel is the perfect component to cut the cheese/pretzel. Suppenkuche...you are already killing me here and I'm only on the appetizer.\n\n2) Potato Pancakes-- FRIED GOODNESS. Oh my god they are so incredibly crispy but soft inside towards the middle. That's all I have to tell you. Get this.\n\nNOW...the next couple things I'm going to talk about were SPECIALS for the day that most of my party got...so be warned, they might not be there on the menu when you go.\n\n1) Lamb chops with truffle butter, mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts. \nSimply freaking amazing. Lamb was cooked perfectly, not too chewy. MMmmm. And the mash was good with the smallest of chunks of potato that hinted that these potatoes were made from actual potatoes getting mashed, not the flakes that come in boxes (I always am hesitant on any dish at any restaurant with mashed potatoes).\n\nI got the:\n2) Roasted and stuffed dumpling and half chicken and chicken sauce with potato pancakes.\nSome of the chicken was a little on the dry side...but the semi-crispy, flavorful skin made up for it. The dumpling was so good...dense, almost like a matzo ball. Mmmmmmm....\n\n3) Bratwurst with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut: This was also a party favorite. The sauerkraut is perfect. Not that stuff you get in jars/they serve at hotdog stands. ACTUAL sauerkraut that wasn't too acidic. The bratwurst was good though, I can't even describe it. \n\nDRINK:\nI got the bananaweizen. If you're a fan of beer, prepare to drink up because they have a good selection. Bananaweizen is basically banana juice mixed with their hefeweizen (you can see banana pieces floating around! Yum!) This beer came out in a very tall glass...needless to say I'm not much of a drinker and this beer got me feeling it. If you don't drink beer/drink.....well, don't force yourself! I probably wouldn't drink another next time I come. The food is why I'll go again.\n\n\nSERVICE:\n\nVery attentive, friendly, and fast.\n\n\nTIPS:\n\nThe sooner you get here during opening hours, the better. \nCome hungry.\nTry out their daily specials.", "author": "Shannon N."}

I must say--even though I studied abroad in Germany, I wasn't particularly fond of German food, but Suppenk\u00fcche offered some of the best German food I've had. The restaurant offers a relatively small menu and somewhat loud atmosphere, and I visited with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday on a weeknight. \n\nOur group started by splitting two pretzels--while the pretzel dough itself wasn't all that memorable, they were served with mustard and a cheese dip that was strong and flavorful. We decided to split a bunch of dishes among us, and shortly after placing our order, they all came out at the same time--very quick and efficient service! We had the German mixed salad, which was an absolutely delicious amalgamation of potato salad and a bunch of different pickled vegetable salads including carrot, cabbage (like cole slaw), red cabbage, and beets. This was a fantastic dish that was fresh, savory, colorful, and diverse. We also got the pickled herring salad, which contained many of the components of the mixed salad, with, of course, the addition of pickled herring dressed in a creamy sauce. We also had the potato pancakes served with applesauce--while the potato pancakes were nice and crispy, I didn't find this dish to be particularly memorable. And then the entrees. The wild boar sausage (daily special) and the meatloaf (with bacon and egg) were both solid dishes, but the J\u00e4gerschnitzel (pork cutlet in mushroom sauce) I found a little bit on the dry side. We also had the delicious grilled trout, which was served with a creamy lemony sauce, and the standout of the dinner was the Sauerbraten, a braised beef pot roast. Interestingly, the Sauerbraten was not very sour at all, but it was fall-apart tender! Many of the main dishes came with the same couple of sides--salad, potato, and my favorites--braised red cabbage and spaetzle. The combination of all of these different dishes and sides made for an absolutely fantastic meal. In general, the dishes were not overly heavy (which can be typical of German cuisine), but creatively plated and seasoned.", "author": "David K."}

It was very good, everything good quality and hearty, and I loved the simple and authentic decor. I'd thought it would be kitschy/touristy, but it's pretty industrial (especially the bathroom - feels like a WWII era bathroom with all the barren concrete).\n\nSERVICE: Great, very friendly! They were efficient with our huge table of about 20 people.\n\nMUST-HAVES: Everything was solid and nothing disappointed. The one that stood out to me the most flavor-wise was the Curryw\u00fcrst mit Pommes Frites, and the pancakes are worth going for if you're craving something sweet. The potato pancakes are done really well and a good smaller side.\n \n* Bauernfr\u00fchst\u00fcck mit Gew\u00fcrzgurken (farmers omelette w/ potatoes, bacon & cheese w/ pickles & pork sausage. $12) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/suppenk%C3%BCche-san-francisco-2?select=ipZLUbIawjEnpl-2d21zFQ#lFSxUe8ubhCBSSBXWhChUQ\ncross-section: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/suppenk%C3%BCche-san-francisco-2?select=ipZLUbIawjEnpl-2d21zFQ#p6fgxqKazBcxt1nTw4ROHQ\nNice! The eggs were soft and this was a great filling dish. The sausage was a little hard if I'm being picky.\n\n* Ger\u00f6st Maultaschen mit Zwiebeln, Ei und Gurkensalat (sauteed german ravioli scrambled w/ eggs & onions w/ cucumber salad. $11.50) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/suppenk%C3%BCche-san-francisco-2?select=ipZLUbIawjEnpl-2d21zFQ#GdABLO_hwB2zQ39JawKvkA\nThis was really interesting. It looked like an omelette but had ravioli mixed in, so it was like eating a brunch item that was also kind of like a lasagna, but really egg-y. Also well done, and very big! I took half home.\n\n* Kaiserschmarrn mit Apfel und Pflaumenmus (emporer's pancake w/ brandied raisins, w/ apple & plum compote. $11) - 4 stars\nTried a bite of my friend's - even though it was cold, the pancake was still very soft & moist and the raisins with the compote went together great.\n\n* Reibekuchen mit hausgemachtem Apfelmus (potato pancakes w/ homemade apple sauce. $9.50) - 4 stars\nAlso tried a bite, great thick crisped outside, soft inside. The applesauce is a bit overly sweetened and a little watery, but works well w/ the pancakes.\n\nBRUNCH SPECIALS\n* Obatzda mit Brezeln (warm pretzels w/ bavarian cheese mix. $7.50) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/suppenk%C3%BCche-san-francisco-2?select=ipZLUbIawjEnpl-2d21zFQ#4RkNjC5sKL67vr1M4Oxv8w\nTried a bite, was great!

The pretzel has just the right texture so soaking it in the broth kind of ruined its perfect texture, making it too soft and causing it to lose its crisp. \n\n* Omelette mit Lachs, Spinat, Tomaten, Zwiebeln und K\u00e4se (special omelet w/ smoked salmon, spinach, tomatoes, onions & cheese. $12.50) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/suppenk%C3%BCche-san-francisco-2?select=ipZLUbIawjEnpl-2d21zFQ#H0tYWddAJoHpGppGUxCwCQ\n\n* 20 Cm Wienerw\u00fcrstschen mit Zwieblen Ei und Bratkartoffeln (20 cm frankfurter sausage links w/ 2 eggs & roasted potatoes. $11.50) - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/suppenk%C3%BCche-san-francisco-2?select=ipZLUbIawjEnpl-2d21zFQ#kj2jXeieitYkJ4o0_DptGQ\nStands out with the super long raw-looking sausages. Good meat but a kind of straightforward plain dish.\n\n* Gefluegelschnitzel mit Kartoffelbrei und Gurken Salat (organic chicken schnitzel w/ mashed potatoes & cucumber salad. $13.50) - 4 stars\nTried a bite and the chicken was tender and the breading crumbly and even. The mashed potatoes had a lot of good texture from chunks of potato and skin, and it had just a hint of seasoning.\n\n* Curryw\u00fcrst mit Pommes Frites (white chicken & pork sausages in tomato curry sauce w/ french fries. $11.50) - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/suppenk%C3%BCche-san-francisco-2?select=ipZLUbIawjEnpl-2d21zFQ#GqcYGzve4mk9YuBqEjHkcg\nThis was the most interesting w/ the most flavor.

Greg and I have been trying to explore new neighborhoods and determined that this past Sunday was going to be Hayes Valley's turn.  We were entertaining going to either Lers Ros Thai or Suppenkuche, and we basically coin flipped on which one we would end up at.  Looking back now, we should have just gone straight to here.  We showed up around 1ish and were pleased to see that we were going to make it for brunch (which goes until 2pm).  There was hardly a wait, and we ultimately didn't have to share a table for too long.\n\nI can't say I'm well-versed in German food at all, so looking at the menu, I was SO grateful for the English translations.  I also perused Yelp while I was at the table, really racking my brain on what I wanted to eat.  I ordered the organic chicken schnitzel served with mashed potatoes and cucumber salad, and Greg had the Bratwurst with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.  We both ordered the Schneider Weisse Hefeweizen; I had a half liter, while Greg ordered the liter.\n\nThe food came out fairly quickly, and much to my surprise, the chicken schnitzel was HUGE.  The chicken itself was cooked to perfection.  It was crispy, breaded perfectly, and wasn't dry at all.  That combined with the mashed potatoes was definitely a winning combination.

Sadly it did not come close to living up to the hype. The place was super busy and as with popular places there was a wait for a table.... Sadly the host was not in any way welcoming and there was minimal space to wait.\nWe shared potato fritters which were ok. I had the Pork chop for a main which was awful. It had the consistencies of a frankfurter, the mash potato was tasteless and watery. For desert I shared a strudel, which had nuts in that I was not informed about despite declaring my allergy. The waitress was rude & impatient.\nThe only saving grace for this place was the friendly, knowledgeable bar staff & wide selection of beer.", "author": "Barry O."}

Either make reservations days or weeks in advance or be brave and go around happy hour times before dinner.  Even then, you might be at a communal table depending on your party size.  Speaking of party size, the smaller the better in terms of increasing your odds.\n\nNow, I'm extremely familiar with Italian, Asian, Mexican, and American food.  What I'm a novice in is German food.  How often do you stumble upon a German restaurant?  There's maybe 1 or 2 in SF.  Leopold is technically Austrian but we'll let that slide and consider it German.  When you think of German food, you think of wiener schnitzel (not the hot dog kind), large beers, and sausages.  Suppenkuche has that and more...\n\nIf you're a beer lover (and you better be), you can order your beer in a boot.  It's several liters if I recall and it takes a lot in order to finish it.  Ask your server for beer recommendations because you don't want to be stuck with one you hate.  EG: A friend hates hoppy beers and somehow ended up with one.  Another item known to Germans is pretzels.  Now, it's not the Auntie Anne pretzels but the harder and salty kind.  It's the carbs to absorb the beer.  As mentioned earlier, wiener schnitzel is another famous dish.  Think of a tonkatsu without the tonkatsu sauce.  Still confused?  Think fried pork chop.\n\nOverall, the food is solid.  Bring beer loving friends and you'll have a great time.", "author": "Ronald L."}

You'll also need to be okay with communal tables.\n\nI don't think I'm a huge fan of German food, but I'm giving Suppenkuche 4 stars because it's such a fun and unique spot. My friend and I arrived at 6 PM on a Sunday night, and though the restaurant was quite busy already, we were seated immediately. We decided to order the pretzel with Bavarian cheese, potato pancakes with apple sauce, and pork schnitzel. We thought two appetizers and an entree would be just the right amount of food, but it turns out 1) their entrees are huge, and 2) German food is super heavy. I would definitely recommend splitting an entree if you don't want to take home leftovers (and actually, we still did). I can't say I was deeply impressed by anything I ate, but I thought the food was good enough for a solid meal, and again, the experience was fun. The only comments I have to make about the food are that the potato pancakes reminded me of thick hashbrowns (and definitely need the apple sauce), and the texture of the cheese accompanying the pretzel is kind of unexpected but worth trying!", "author": "Kelly R."}

We sat on a bench with another party of 6.\n\nI ordered the Sauteed Trout in Lemon Butter Sauce with Bouillon Potatoes & Spinach (19). I substituted the bouillon potatoes with mashed potatoes, and also ordered a side of Bratwurst. The food was good, but everything just felt so heavy. It was like everything was covered in cream or butter -- my spinach, which was under the trout, was just swimming in oil. I ordered trout because it seemed like the lightest item on the menu, but even then I had trouble eating it. I have also decided I do not like bratwurst, and have never eaten a bratwurst I've liked, and will probably never buy it again.\n\nBecause of this, I actually prefer the food at Schroeder's, which I find to be a lot less greasy.\n\nI also felt really claustrophobic here -- being seated next to a loud large party didn't help. We had a lot of trouble hearing each other talk, even though we were sitting right across from each other. We were also seated right next to the kitchen door, and people would run into each other all the time since the door swung open every 10 seconds.

Between the 13 of us, we got to taste a large variety from the menu, and everyone was impressed. \n\nA helpful hint for all those readers planning a large group gathering at Suppenkuche: the back room is reserved for large parties. It snugly fits 3 tables of 12. We had a party of 13 come for a birthday dinner, which required a reservation in advance. We were told on the phone that the max amount they could accommodate was 12 per group, due to limited seating, but if we squeezed, we could possibly fit 13. That was not a problem to us, and it actually turned out comfortable and fine, due to the tables having bench-style seating instead of individual chairs. Smart move, maximizing buttcheck space, Suppenkuche ;] So, if you wanna squeeze together with all your friends, it's very do-able, but the people at either end of the table might have a hard time hearing one another.\n\nOverall a great birthday dinner for my dear friend, with great service, to boot ;] I'm not one of those people who will say \"no pun intended\" when you KNOW they just said that to call attention to their pun.

You must be a beer lover and a tank if you want to or think you can drink all of it by yourself.  \n\nTip: When your beer is at the heel of the boot level, drink from the side rather from the front or back of the boot glass.  The air rises from the bottom up due to the way the boot is formed, so drinking it from the side of the boot, you won't have the rising bubbles pushed up against your nose or face when trying to chug the beer.\n\nWhat I recommend ordering:\n\n- Fried Potato Pancakes with Applesauce - I have never tried that combo together and it tasted great.  A part of the potato pancake that I bit into, however, had a little too much salt on it.  It is forgivable though.\n\n- Wiener Schnitzel!!! - It's delish!  Eat it with the sauerkraut and the creamy mashed potatoes that is on the bottom of the sausages!  I didn't need the mustard they provided on the side because it would cover the flavor of the sauerkraut and sausage. Every bite is so savory!!!\n\nBiggest booty beer size as a beverage! - Not only is it a challenge to finish the whole thing, it is a fun group activity during the whoooole dinner!  Must get!!!\n\nTheir steak dish was a good hearty meal.  I thought it needed more flavor to it and I found myself using the mustard from the sausage dish as a flavor booster.  Yes, steak and mustard goes quite well with each other. \n\nThe wait was extremely long for big parties, such as the number of people I was with (10), BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY WORTH THE WAIT!

All I wanted was the potato pancakes and the boot-shaped glass of beer but since Oktoberfest was happening, these were unavailable this particular evening. How sad ):\n\nWe ended up getting the half chicken, a pretzel, bratwurst sausages, mac'n'cheese and a side of fries. When the food came out, it all looked smaller than we anticipated for the four of us but the meats were all quite delicious. I usually like sauerkraut but for some reason, the ones that came w/ the bratwurst tasted a bit off for me.\n\nOn another occasion, I was nearby Suppenkuche during lunch time so we decided to go on in and give it a try. Why not? When else will we ever try German brunch? There was a general brunch menu and a daily brunch menu. This time, the potato pancakes were available so of course, we got it.\n\nPOTATO PANCAKES\nIt's like hash browns but with a thicker layer of fried goodness. It almost looked like fried ramen noodles haha but it was very good. It came with a side of cold apple sauce. I wonder how it would taste with hot apple sauce instead?\n\nVEAL + CHICKEN SAUSAGE SOUP W/ PRETZEL\nSlightly full from the potato pancakes, soup sounded just right. The sausage was tasty but the soup was a bit too salty. It tasted like chicken broth from a can... The pretzel was spot on with the crisp yet soft texture.\n\nSMOKED SALMON OMELETTE\nMy friend ordered this and it was insanely overwhelming in its salt levels. My first bite of it and I'm already doubting if I can even finish it. My friend didn't finish it... he left maybe 7 bites of it behind.\n\nSo now I know. German brunch is not the way to go. At least for me. I gotta come back to give this place a REAL try and order the wiener schnitzel with a side of potato pancakes.

Especially considering the last one I went to was at the age of 13....yeah, its been a while. \n\nAfter finishing assisting my agent friend with an open house somewhat close by, they decided to treat me to dinner here before I headed back to the east bay. \n\nThis place reminisces a little whole in the wall place that I can imagine would be similar to something you would encounter/experience in Germany.\n\nIt was a Sunday evening and when we arrived the place was PACKED! We went to the bar area where the hostess took our names and told us it would be like a 40 min wait. We decided to just of course wait at the bar and order a drink. I really was not much in a beer mode( this is a beer place) so I decided to order a glass of Cabernet off of their very small, less than appealing wine list. My friend ordered a beer. My Cabernet was just ok. \n\nWe were then seated with another group of people. It seems to be how the seating arrangement goes. It turned out to be quite fun. \n\nI then decided to order a darker style beer that I had a sample of at the bar being the wine just wasn't doing much for me. The beer was actually quite excellent tasting. For food, we ordered a bowl of Lobster soup to share. For my main dish I ordered Gebratene Forelle in Zitronen Butterso\u00dfemit Kartoffeln und Spinat which is Sauteed Trout in Lemon Butter Sauce with Bouilon Potatoes & Spinage. My friend ordered Grilled Cured Pork Chop with Sauerkraut & Mashed Potatoes.\n\nLobster soup was ok. I mean it was decent in flavor but nothing exceptional. It was also warm and not hot like fresh soup should be. \n\nDishes arrived excellently authentic and hearty looking. And excellently hearty tasting it was!!! Trout was grilled/sauteed to perfection, leaving a nice savory flavorful crust on top of the fish that was just superb tasting. The sauce was also quite delectable. Oh and the potato's were rich, creamy and tasteful as well. Especially considering I am not a fan of potato s in general. I also had a few bites of my friends pork chops that were too, cooked PERFECTLY and tastes wonderful.\n\nOverall, the ambiance is very lively, loud, and authentically entertaining.

Reviews by my party of three were mixed: I was fairy enthused, my wife was wholly unimpressed, and our friend split the difference. \n\nWe shared several dishes and, as others have pointed out, it's impossible to finish what you are served, so leftovers were inevitable.  We shared a composed salad that included beets, cabbage, carrots, potato salad, and butter lettuce with a lovely vinaigrette.  If you can accept \"simple\" as an adjective to describe your starter, this was great.  We also had potato pancakes, which were a bit less successful.  The exterior surfaces were nice and crusty, but the interior wasn't so flavorful, and the \"apple sauce\" was not what those raised on Mott's would expect, but, rather, a fruity syrup.  \n\nMy wife ordered the wienerschnitzel, about which none of us was too enthused. The pork was a bit tough, the batter unseasoned, and the promised green salad conspicuously absent.  Our friend ordered the bratwurst, which were very flavorful, but not what we expected: they were not plump at all, but, rather, about the form factor of a hot dog.  Once the surprise about their appearance wore off, we enjoyed these.  Finally, I ordered the meatloaf.  It was a bit dry, but, otherwise, it was lovely.  It had overtones of, I think, sage and a nice hardboiled egg in its middle, and the mushroom gravy was rich and delicious.  Sides included delicious roasted potatoes alongside the wienerschnitizel, mashed potatoes with the bratwurst and meatloaf, and a world-class sauerkraut added to the bratwurst.  There were leftover sausage pieces and meatloaf to take home.\n\nThe beer list is pretty long and appeared esoterically German.  I don't know enough about it to be aware of whether Suppenkuche covered all the bierkeller bases, but I found a really enjoyable cider that went well with the hearty food.\n\nNearly all seating is communal; luckily, we had respectful table companions.  Service is competent, with the bussers checking on us more often than our order taker; our order taker was very, very gracious about correcting a small error on our bill, so kudos to her for a good attitude.  Noise level is nuts, however; by the time all the tables filled in, we could not hear anything said at our table, so I downgrade a bit for that, as well.\n\nFinally, I am downgrading one star for this very specific reason:  Neither the person who seated us and handed us menus nor the order taker ever mentioned there were specials. We learned of them only as we were getting up to leave and saw some incredible-looking, big fat sausages on another diner's plate.  At that point, the bus person we asked about the sausages told us that they were on the \"specials menu.\"  The specials menu turned out to be a thing: it was left on each of the tables, but, at our table, it never left the side occupied by the other party, so we had zero awareness of it.  When we looked at it, we each decided that we'd have ordered something else than we actually had ordered, i.e., a salmon dish for my wife, the sausages (which were made from wild boar) for our friend, and a roast suckling pig dish for me.  The specials might be the only thing that actually gets us back to Suppenkuche.  The greeter and order taker need to do a much better job of pointing out their existence, especially if there is only one copy of that menu per communal table.", "author": "Mike R."}

From what a waitress told me, people reserved tables for a block period (6pm-8pm, 8pm-10pm) and if you don't have a reservation, you can be put in a wait list. When I arrived at 6pm, I was not aware that my friend didn't get a spot for us so I just added my name to the list in hopes we got a table. When my friends finally arrived, she notified the waitress about how she called earlier and tried to get a spot but couldn't. The waitress was kind about it and she found an open table for us to sit and dine.\n\nThe food I ordered was veal with potatoes and a salad. At the time, I thought veal was some German food sauce (had a dumb moment there) being added to the potato.

It was tender and easy to eat and the potatoes was really good. One of my friends ordered a 2 liter boot which is huge!

As for Jeanette:            \" Schuster Bleib Bei Deinen Leisten' ( a \"film producer career\" ????) \nMy dear Conejo Valley Americans who are swilling this food in honor of their German roots or Germany connections: Please don't take this as representative for German food!

They do not take reservations so get ready to wait. The environment is very friendly, loud, and overall fun! We waited at the bar with some beers. They have a wide selection of german beers (of course) and the bartender was very helpful. Since our wait was about an 45 minutes, we decided to order some food at the bar. If you get a good spot at the bar and don't want to wait, their full menu is available at the bar just keep in mind that there are no chairs at the bar. When we got seated, we shared a big table with another party. I thought it would be a little awkward since we were sitting so close but it was fun and we had a great time chatting with the party next to us! \n\nNow for the food: \n\nPretzel: so soft and warm! It was a perfect appetizer while waiting. \n\nPotato Pancakes: It was crispy, thin, and simple. \n\nPork Shoulder: DELICIOUS. This was my favorite dish of the night. I was a little taken back by how big it was. I thought it was going to be dry but don't let that deceive you. It was crispy on the outside and so tender inside!! I don't know about you but I love crispy pork skin! \n\nBratwurst with Mashed Potatoes: Delicious and full of flavor! This was also very moist. \n\nBoot of Beer: Huge! I personally probably wouldn't be able to finish it by myself. We ordered one for the experience and it was so fun! Probably wouldn't order it again just because it was already so full from all the food! \n\nWe shared everything between three people and it was the perfect amount.

My friend gave us two options- really good pizza or German food with beer in a boot!\n\nWhile the aroma of pizza captivated my senses as we walked past the first restaurant the idea of 2 liters of beer in a boot intrigued me more.\n\nI knew this place had to be good when I noticed the line forming outside half an hour before they were about to open. The restaurant is small but really nice inside and seating is communal. We were seated with 2 other elderly German couples which made the experience even better! The were fun, had plenty of recommendations and told us about some of the boot traditions. \n\nMost of the foods at Suppenkuche are rich in quality and flavor. We had:\n\nGerman Bread- typical german brown bread with a creamy, buttery, herb spread.\n\nReibekuchen mit hausgemachtem Apfelmus AKA... THE BEST Potato Pancakes EVERRR!!!! (with Homemade Apple Sauce) I don't know what they put in these things or how they make them but don't call them hash browns! You can order them as an appetizer or they are included with some of the entrees. These Potato Pancakes are $$$ and make me want to return for brunch just to have more and try other menu items.\n\nPretzel with Cheese Sauce- I don't know if I've ever had a pretzel this good before. Probably not. The pretzel was warm, slightly chewy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. The cheese sauce was an amazing buttery seasoned sauce that melted in the mouth.\n\nKrautwickel is ground pork wrapped in cabbage. The lady next to me said it was one of her favorites. It was suppose to be less rich than some of the other dishes and tasted really good. She was right! The sauce poured on top of the cabbage rolls was warm and savory. It was so good I could eat it with rice! The pork was flavorful and not dry. The side of mashed potatoes were creamy and smooth.\n\nThe Boot of Beer was quite a site. The boot itself was tall and really heavy. We ordered a dunkel which complimented all our foods well.\n\nFor being really busy service was excellent. The food came out really fast and waitress checked on us often. I'll be back the next time I'm in Hayes Valley in SF since the only German place in Sac so far is a sausage/beer place!

Bad planning on our part. So we came back that Thursday around 530/6pm.\n\nFairly simple decor, all your basic necessities are laid out on the table, low lighting and candles on the table. We were seated next to this other couple, who I want to apologize to at this time if we were rowdy and disruptive. But then again, once the place started filling up, I think everyone gets a bit loud; especially at the bar.\n\nThe waitress helped us select a beer for Das Boot; which we were eager to drink out of. You do have to put a credit card on file for collateral in case you break the glass though. And drink out of it with the toe face down so the beer bubble won't burst on you! \n\nSince none of us knew much about German food, we just ordered a bunch of things to share. The Lentil soup was hearty and I actually preferred it over the Potato Soup Special. Stuffed Portobello Mushrooms, Wild Boar Sausage and Skirt Steak were all delicious. Finished off our meal with Apple Strudel. \n\nI'm excited to come back to try out more items on the menu!", "author": "Jenn Y."}

They added an extra table or two in the back, in what was already a tight space. They questioned and initially rejected my drink order, when I told them I wanted a boot with a strong ale. It was my birthday celebration, I'm a huge guy, experienced, and was not driving. The food was okay, it was better six months earlier, the potato pancakes were a bit overcooked; but my entree was what I expected, nothing more. Our waitress was slow to take our initial drink order, provide bread, and one or two at our table got their food 5 or 10 minutes after the rest of us. That's an eternity for a big guy to be polite, wait, and stare at his meal! \n\nI realize they have only a little control over who their patrons are, but if your going to question the very large and expensive beer boot I requested, then don't over serve the tourists. There was a party of Europeans next to us with a group member, lets call him \"Denny\", bumping into us and passing out in the bathroom. Sure, they likely drank before, outside the restaurant, and the guy probably needed some food in him, but it was just one more thing and the boot thing really pissed me off! Oh yeah, they served him drinks, not a boot mind you, but still!\n\nSo, I'm a bit introverted and was really looking forward to birthday celebration with my family. I don't mind a bit of noise and watching people mess up a bit, but Suppenkuche was not what it once was. Perhaps it's gotten too popular, perhaps they have slipped, perhaps it was a really really bad day. It was the worst celebration in a restaurant I have ever experienced.

The bread was fresh and it certainly helped with soaking up the beer, but the herb butter was the highlight. It was so yummy! I tried to restrain myself from slathering the entire thing on my little slice of bread, it was that good. \n-Piping hot pretzels! A bit smaller than I expected but it was good.

BEWARE parking is hard and there are no big parking garages or lots like in other part of the city. After we found parking we had to wait about another half hour for our table which wasn't bad for a saturday night. We had the pretzel, the brat plate, and the meat loaf. All the meals were very good. Make sure you get a beer while you are there! It was hard to read the beer menu because there wasn't a translation on what they were. Make sure you ask your waiter for a recommendation.

Eating here definitely made me want to go to Germany soon.\n\nThe restaurant itself was small and pretty simple in decor. They have communal tables so we were seated with another party. It was really crowded and I had to yell for my friend to hear me even though she was only a couple of feet away. I was in a social mood that night so it was fine, but if you want a more relaxing environment to dine in, you should look elsewhere.\n\nOur service was really good, especially considering how busy the restaurant was. Our server also gave me a great beer recommendation.\n\nFor my meal, I had the wiener schnitzel with roasted potatoes and a green salad.

Though the hostess did spend a fraction of a minute standing and just looking at me and looking at the space around her before leading me to a seat. Which was... odd.\n\nOrdered the lobster soup, roasted half chicken stuffed with dumplings with potato pancakes, and the veal and pork sausages with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.\n\nSo, the complementary rye bread was dense, sour, moist and chewy. The crust carried with it a slight ash taste that I quite enjoyed, though the bread itself was bland, merely a vessel for the delicious green onion butter on the side.\n\nThe soup was more chowder than soup. It was very creamy and lobster-y. I could taste all the flavors of the crushed shells in the soup although it was on the slightly salty side.\n\nThe roasted chicken had the most wonderful crispy skin that contrasted so well with the moist and tender meat. I only had a piece of the dark meat that was very juicy, but apparently the white meats were rather dry. The potato pancakes were ridiculously crispy on the outside with the awesome texture of hashbrowns on the inside. Oh man, how I love hashbrowns. The only down side is that with the crispiness came a slight burnt and bitter taste. Trade-offs ya'know.\n\nThe sausages were delicious. Once I cut into them, juice just poured out of it like as if it were a soup dumpling or something. The meat inside was still very juicy and true to the original flavors of the meat. There weren't a ton of fancy spices added to these sausages, and that was refreshing to experience. The mashed potatoes were solid. Overall, this dish was very heavy. I didn't have my full appetite and felt slightly overwhelmed after 1/4 of the dish.\n\nThe strudel. Man, ever since I watched Inglorious Basterds five goddamn years ago I've been craving a damn strudel with a huge dollop of whipped cream on top. Do I seriously have to fly back in time to Nazi Germany in order to get me one of those???\n\nThey had an apple strudel special here tonight and I was thoroughly disappointed. Not only were there raisins, ew, in my apple strudel, there was zero laminated dough. It only had this one thin crust on top of some streusel, the rest was a mush of soggy apples.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-10-20", "description": "Simply put, disgusting and highly disappointing. As one time residents of SF, now living in lower CA, we have always fancied ourselves as Suppenkuche devotees, which is the why we have loyally been coming back time and again since their initial opening some 20 plus years ago, back when the Hayes Valley was a no man's land, safe only for prostitutes and drug dealers.\n\nThe key to Suppenkuche's success was simple: unpretentious, affordable and delicious authentic German comfort food lovingly prepared fresh and tasty, night after night, predictably good whether you ate there five times a year, or once every five years. No more, that consistency is gone, and so has the affordability.\n\nI had noticed that the quality at Suppenkuche had been slipping for a while, but it has hit an all-time new low, in my opinion. It is abundantly clear that the absentee owner and original founder of this one-time gem of a restaurant has just completely given up the ghost, has lost all interest in the customer experience and is just phoning it in. It's said success breeds complacency, and in the case of Suppenkuche, when it comes to the kitchen, I wholeheartedly agree. \n\nThe Nitty Gritty. \nThe kitchen is staffed with dubiously skilled cooks that excel at cranking out volume with little attention to detail or quality. When the restaurant first opened, the kitchen was populated with newish culinary school type grads under the direct supervision of the owner himself, nowhere in sight today. When I saw the \"pantry chef\" tossing my mixed salad with his bare hands, I was not sure if I should cancel my order or call the health dept. The service was totally de-personalized and in no time since I was old enough to eat in restaurants has so few words been exchanged with my waiter. He was polite enough but showed no interest in our dining experience.\n\nThe warmed over Wienerschitzel tasted as if if had been cooked hours before and reheated at the time of serving. \n\nThe mixed salad was a tasteless mound of mush and totally disgusting. In retrospect we should have sent it back to register our dissatisfaction but did not really want to make a scene. This was really sad because this dish, like the schnitzel, had previously been signature dishes.\n\nSadly I have to say with heavy heart, that after 20 years of dining at Suppenkuche, I am finished. With so many other well run eating establishments in the city that are passionately pouring heart and soul into what they are doing, why waste precious restaurant dollars on this dressed up dog food.", "author": "Jeff Y."}

In fact, the extent of my German cuisine extends pretty much to only bratwurst and sauerkraut.  Wienerschnitzel to me is still a hotdog joint and j\u00e4gerschnitzel.. well, is that made of j\u00e4ger?  \n\nNested in the cozy neighborhood of Hayes Valley, Suppenkuche is definitely no stranger to large crowds and drunk patrons.  Not surprising since this is one of the few places that actually serve THE  BOOT.  Not only do they have the boot, they also serve beer in 5 liter jug!  (Please do not attempt to drink this all by yourself!  Although I have seen people try...... It is meant to be shared and passed around the table without it actually touching the table.. or so I've been told)  Needless to say, they also have an awesome variety of German beer on tap - great for beer afficianados.\n\nThere were so many delicious choices on the menu, but I wanted to try a German favorite.  I was torn between the wienerschnitzel and j\u00e4gerschnitzel.  In the end, I opted for the j\u00e4gerschnitzel because I love mushroom sauce on everything and anything.  FYI, the j\u00e4gerschnitzel is a sauteed porkloin in mushroom sauce... kind of heavy but oh so delicious!  \n\nThe atmosphere is welcoming; the service is attentive but not overbearing; our food came out quickly; and the beer was just never ending.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my first German cuisine experience.  It's definitely not something I would indulge in very often due to my extremely food coma afterward.

This is a must for appetizers!\n\nMy significant other and myself had the lentil soup with bratwurst and the meatloaf with bacon and egg with mashed potatoes. The soup was healthy with the bratwurst. To me, the bratwurst tasted more like a German hot dog, rather than a bratwurst, but it was very delicious! My significant other actually was quite full from the soup.\n\nI ate most of the meatloaf because it was that darn good!

We put our names down, waited at the bar, and were seated within 15 minutes. So far, so good. We ordered the potato soup, which was tasty but over-seasoned (too much salt, and this coming from someone who loves flavorful/salted foods!). Then came the potato pancakes with apple sauce, which were okay. They seemed a little bland. Then the German Ravioli filled with pork and vegetables served with mushroom sauce showed up. This is a dish that I really wanted to like. I love ravioli and dumplings of any kind. This dish had so much promise, but like the potato soup, it arrived over-seasoned (too much salt!). If it hadn't been so over-seasoned, the German Ravioli would've been the star of the show. One thing that we did like were the warm pretzels, which were paired with what appeared to be a cream cheese/curry sauce. The pretzels were fantastic - chewy and salty, and everything you would expect. The cream cheese-based sauced could use some work, but offered an interesting perspective on the pretzels, at least. The last thing we ordered was another pork dish that was one of their nightly specials, and it came with a German dumpling and sauerkraut. They paired it with a sweet, salty sauce that was wayyyyy over-salted (again, this is coming from someone who loves well-seasoned food and LOVES salt!).\n\nOverall, this was a restaurant that me and my date really wanted to love, and their dishes really have some promise if the kinks were worked out of them, however, the food clearly wasn't the focus at this restaurant, and we don't think we'll be coming back.", "author": "Cameron N."}

We first stepped in while one of the buddies was looking for parking and they won't let us sit until all party arrives. Ok, fair enough. So we went to wait at the bar for few min and thought starting with drinks till we get seated. The barman was an anti-social rude snut (or maybe just had bad day or new out of town and stressed out with serving people making eye contact). From some weird reason they do not allow to take the drinks to the table and pay the whole round as part of the dinner, so you must pay before \"leaving the bar\" to the table 3 feet away. I asked what is the reason for this hassle, he responded in his unique irritated demeanor \"we are just this kind of place!\". Yes indeed you are. \nThen when finally seated - they have that so-called \"communal sitting\", just that the tables are not actual long benches for that kind of configuration. These are simply 4-person tables they randomly squeeze 7 around with strangers, making it super awkward experience.  And they don't even bother trying to leverage some space to give some sort of separation between parties. If you do communal seating - do it right. Not with cheap family-style tables. Luckily there was just a nice adult couple sharing our table so it was kind of Ok, but still, weird.\nTook ages for anyone to take the order, and yet same feel of impatience from any staff walking around. Like they just wish you take the simplest gig on the menu and get out already as soon as possible. Not sure why people who hate serving people are getting into restaurant business to start with. Service comes first, food comes second.\nAs for the food - meh. I am hard to be disappointed with German style kitchen,  but this one was just bland and not authentic.

Ever since then, I have decided that all future attempts at German should be confined to food and drink. No more linguistics (despite the fact that I have a degree in linguistics).\n\nSuppenkuche is a casual restaurant with a rowdy vibe.

The venison with (some berry sauce) is divine and carries the gamey taste well, serves with spatzle and sauerkraut. The lamb shank with dumpling was divine. It was braised to perfection, tender and collected the flavors of the wine. Their stuffed mushroom with roasted pepper sauce was very tasty. It was my first time trying German food, but a pleasant eating experience. The waiters are generally cordial and offered suggestions on the wide beer selection. \n\nMaybe it was just my server...but my only complaint was that our group had left more than enough tip for the night, though some friends paid their tip using card (having separated the check). The tip was enough, however, the waiter miscalculated the tip (in cash) on the table w/o counting the tip of the cards, and stood outside the restaurant to ask for more tip. our group didn't bother to sour the mood so just gave him more tip. My personal opinion was that its was rude of him to do that, knowing now that it was probably his mistake but eh. \n\nah well. the food was great. so i might come back again but I will definitely be more wary about making sure the waiter calculated the tip right.", "author": "Jenny Z."}

Parking and getting a seat at a table can be rough, however.\n\nThe first time we went here we didn't get off on a great start.... The hostess forgot about us, and we had been waiting for a few hours. When she realized her mistake, she had us wait in the front of the restaurant, practically right on top of people that were already seated. They were running low on boots, so the waitress tried to convince me that pint glasses were \"more ladylike\", which did not fly with me, and she tried to take my boot before I was finished. \n\nSecond trip went without a hitch, and there was much less wait on a weekday.", "author": "Lisa F."}

I didn't really expect much from German food having had it several times before and not being the biggest fan... but my god, the food her is SO flavorful and amazing! The weinerschnitzel here is great. I love how they give you a \"salad\" with your meal, too... it's basically a hunk of cabbage the size of your face. German food clearly does NOT excel in making \"salads\". \n\nYou also have to get the beer here. Their German beer selection is fabulous. I usually get a pint or two because the beer is just so good! I also did the boot once before... let's never talk about that night again.\n\nLast, the ambiance is energetic and fun, but also dark enough to be a little romantic. I wouldn't recommend for a first date because German food isn't exactly a cute or sexy food to eat... but maybe for a second or third? \n\nAll of this would merit 4 stars, but the 5th star is because of the consistency.

The bread was dark and had a very strong flavor I did not really like. \n\nThe banana beer ($7 for .5L) is a hefeweizen with banana juice. It's a golden yellow color and I was pleasantly surprised with the taste. It definitely tastes like bananas and was very drinkable.\n\nWe also ordered the soft pretzels. I liked these a lot with the cheese spread they came with. It's a stronger cheese which I am in to but I do not think my friend enjoyed it. The pretzels were soft and warm, so I liked them a lot too, but I have a soft spot for soft pretzels.\n\nThere's a little area in the corner with some stools, otherwise there are a bunch of communal tables.

Suppenkuche has broken my German food virginity with such perfection that I am craving for more as I type these very words. \n\nI ordered myself something simple. The pork sausages with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut, and an Erdinger for my drink. Every single item on my plate complimented each other so perfectly. It was like a 3 piece puzzle that magically fit everything. The mashed potatoes were my favorite part, because they were cooked so well. Just a hint of butter, and they were super smooth. I hate it when mashed potatoes have that \"wet sand\" texture, but there was none of that here. The sauerkraut had a strong taste that blended well with the potatoes. The sausage was actually pretty mildly flavored, which as very nice because it didn't get overwhelming at all. The Erdinger beer was very smooth going down and it had a slightly fruity taste.\n\nService was very nice and friendly. The cost of the meal was a bit much but considering the size and taste, it was worth every penny. I can't wait for the next chance I get to eat here!", "author": "Sean H."}

For any party less than 6 people, you can't make a reservation in advance. This is probably the friendliest atmosphere we've ever been in! At the bar, extremely tall people (they're all like 6'6) suggested an off-menu beer: banana and Hefeweizen. It was seriously the best beer I've ever had. It had a distinct banana flavor throughout the entire liter, but it wasn't overpowering and almost tasted like a bubbly juice. The pretzel was incredibly soft and the combo of the honey mustard and cheese was divine! It was really loud, which is perfect for parties and large groups, but probably not great for people on early dates. The sauerkraut actually tasted like authentic, slightly fermented cabbage (the best I've ever had), the sausage was delicious, and the mashed potatoes was perfectly creamy. The bread and homemade butter that's provided on the house is so dense and unique, it was hard to stop eating it. While eating, the table next to us sang songs in harmony and had neighboring tables joining with clapping and singing. It was a unique experience. We felt like we were transported to Europe!

We arrived at 5:30 prior to the crowds just for that reason.  The disappointment started the second we walked through the door.  We were a party of 2 and after hunting down the hostess we were directed to the shelf they call a bar table in the back of the bar.  I was confused, there were 4 open tables with no one at them?  I asked and was told those were reserved for parties of 6 or more.  OK, they have rules I get it.\n\nWe made our way to the bar area and I could tell it was going to be 2-3 deep in no time at all.  While we were the only one sitting there for dinner, our chairs were already being bumped and the crowd had yet to arrive.  It was obvious this was not going to be a pleasant relaxing enjoyable dinner. \n\nThis is why the one star.

This is hibernation food, I just conquered a new continent food, Rumpelstiltskin sleep for 1,000 years food. The portions are massive, but the flavors are very well balanced, it doesn't feel like the same bite over and over. There was a great mix of savory flavors, crisp vinegars and tartness from the sides like the sourkraut. \n\nI had the Pork Knuckle. It was about the size of small football. The crisp on the skin was amazing, like the best chicharr\u00f3n you've had, covering succulent tender pork. It had big chunks of fat on it, but you knew that when you ordered it didn't you? It's a pork knuckle, not a pork loin. Sides were great\n\nAlso had the spaetzle, the onion butter sauce was delicious.  Big enough to treat as a main if you wanted. \n\nBEER: Don't know what to say, broad selection, great quality, and ice cold. We drank from the boot, I felt like a man. \n\nENVIRONMENT: This is where the star gets taken off. It's jam packed inside. Wall to wall, with the entire standing area full of people drinking and waiting for tables. If you're drunk and willing to stand shoulder to shoulder in a brightly lit room, than it's fine, but it's a little off putting at first. Also, the wait is brutal, we sat down as a table of 5 with a 1.5 hour wait, and felt lucky. Seems like all the tables are communal, which is a toss up. The first group sitting next to us were pretty grumpy, and the second group we're nice. Don't want you meal to be ruined just because of the people next to you. \n\nPRO TIP: Get your team of 6+ drunk hairy pillagers together so you can make a reservation, the wait is frustrating.", "author": "Patrick T."}

We originally couldn't get reservations, but another group canceled so they called my friend at 3:30PM and said we secured the reservation.  We were told to be prompt or else they'll give our table away.  Upon arrival, I could totally see why they wanted us to be on time.  This place is soooo popular!  The entire place was packed with people holding pints and eating bratwursts.  I kid, there was way more food than just sausages.\n\nWe sat in the back room, which was pretty cramped, but we made it work.  The seats were actually benches and weren't the most comfortable, but we made do.  Given the instruction that we only had 2 hours to dine and drink, we hurried and scoured their drink menu for the appropriate beer of the night. Our waiter was awesome and brought out a couple samples of beer for us to choose from when we got a bit indecisive. I think we got a hefeweizen in their famous glass boot.  We were told that if anything happened to the boot, someone's CC would get charged $50!  \n\nI wasn't feeling that hungry so I ordered their lentil soup with an extra order of bratwurst.  I was a bit disappointed because it tasted like hot dogs in tomato soup...and it cost $10.  I tried my friend's beef dish and hers was amazing.  I also tasted the currywurst and that was good too.  I think i just got the wrong thing that evening.\n\nEveryone LOVED the potato pancakes that came with a side of apple sauce.  Each order had 3 pancakes the size of a palm and were about an inch thick.  They were crispy and golden brown on the outside and moist on the inside.  Awesome stuff...definitely craving me some of that right now.\n\nOverall, the service was awesome and friendly.  They don't have a large menu, but still had something for everyone to choose from.  I'd say their meat was a bit salty and I wonder if it's so people would buy more beer to quench their thirst.

I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. \n\nStaff was polite but seemed overwhelmed at times by the crowd. Service was a little slow at first, but our waiter became more attentive as the evening went on. We were told we had to finish eating by 8pm time because they were going to seat us at one of the party tables in the back, and they held true to that promise, promptly telling us to get up and leave at 8 on the dot to make room for a large group with a reservation. Gotta love that German punctuality!\n\nPretty decent selection of beer. The spread of food on the menu is pretty straightforward and expected: a handful of wursts and schnitzels, and of course a potato pancake with applesauce. The standard appetizers are pretty meh, but when we went, there were fresh pretzels and mustard on the daily menu which were better than expected and quite tasty. I wish I could remember the brand of mustard, it was so good I want to order some for myself!\n\nSome of the components in the entrees seemed odd, but the dishes were well received by everyone at our table. The sauerbraten was very tasty and though the sauce was a little lighter than I am used to, it was definitely a dish I'd like to eat again. Spaetzle was clearly fresh, made on-site, and very good.\n\nI am not a vegetarian, but one of the people in our group was and she was (unsurprisingly) underwhelmed/disappointed with her dinner of lentil soup. I personally wouldn't expect much in the way of vegetarian fare from a German restaurant, but being a restaurant named \"soup kitchen\", one would expect more selection of soups and maybe more interesting/better tasting options?\n\nDecor is very minimalist and basic, which I personally love. It was a relief to not see a permanent Oktoberfest theme inside. \n\nAtmosphere was extremely loud and though our party was not bothered by it, the communal seating may not be for everyone. The people who were at the table when we were seated seemed extremely put off that we were seated next to them. They were a party of two at one of the 12-seater tables! What did they expect?? If you are looking for a quiet evening or have personal space issues, this restaurant is probably not for you.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't say this food teleported me home to Germany, but it was pretty close!

Much like a peroxided drag queen from Atlanta, I am usually never tardy for a party. But, I didn't get this place. At all. I kept wondering if I were in the twilight zone. It must be me. Everyone else seems to love this place. Even one of my oldest (as in time known, not age) friends is a fan. What am I missing? Perhaps I should start by describing what I received.\n\n1.) Pushes and shoves. I get it. The place is busy. It's small. It's packed at all times. When my largish party arrived for our reservation, the place was in the weeds and they weren't ready for us. There's no waiting area to speak of, so we sort of just stood in the middle of the room. I know. Brilliant. The waiters, in an effort to, I dunno, actually do their jobs, needed to tell us to get out of the way or move us out of their way. I get it. Really, I do. But, rather than a scene out of Whip It, how about having a large table ready at time of reservation or instruct us to wait in a specific area? I left to wait outside. I couldn't handle the chaos. Whilst outside, I was greeted by a smell so foul The Stinky Cheese Man was, like, \"d@mn!\" This was not the fault of Suppenk\u00fcche. I'm just sayin'.;\n\n2.) A hair stuck to my menu. I have about as much hair as Natalie Portman with a Vendetta. 'twas not mine, but there it was, greeting me like the hostess I never met. A long scraggly hair stuck to a menu is not the best second impression to make.;\n\n3.) Pushy service. At one *point* in the meal, our waiter actually poked my friend. Poked! As in, extend forefinger and forcibly jab someone with it. WTH was I?;\n\n4.) Boring food. Sp\u00e4tzle can knock your socks off (see, Morso). J\u00e4gerschnitzel can make you moan uncontrollably (see my friend's mom's food). This... filled me up. I noshed on potato pancakes ($11!!!), chicken dish of the day and potatoes. \"Why would you order chicken?\" Because it was a special and I thought it would taste special. It was okay. The pancakes ($11!!!) were the highlight of the meal.;\n\n5.) Nausea. Drinking beer out of a communal boot might be one of the most horrifically nauseating dining experiences I can imagine. Swig after swig of backwash, germs, food particles from other people, sloshing around in yeast... I might be sick if I write any more. A personal hell.;\n\n6.) Good beer. The beer selections were pretty impressive (duh) and all of my (INDIVIDUAL BOTTLE) choices were delicious. As a bar, I could see Suppenk\u00fcche as a fun destination spot.

On the recommendation of a Yelp employee friend, we decided to check out the always busy, traditional German eatery Suppenkuche, in Hayes Valley.\n\nWe started off with several hefeweizens to try before ultimately ordering a 2 liter boot glass of something that I can't currently remember since it was that crazy a night.  The boots require a $50 deposit in case they break and the beer itself ranges between $22-45+ per glass.\n\nI went with as traditional a meal as I could get with the veal weiner schnitzel for $17.50.  It sort of reminded me of a huge chicken-fried steak and was served with potatoes cooked with bacon.  With just a shot of lemon juice over the steak, the flavors were intense and excellent.  The veal itself was very tender and the breading was perfectly browned.  While the portions weren't huge, I think that we were all perfectly satiated.\n\nUltimately our San Diego friend didn't show up to the party, but we had a great time of it anyway.  The atmosphere was super fun but the experience was certainly not cheap.  It's definitely worth checking out but make sure to go early because seats are very difficult to get.\n\nFood: 8/10\n\nService: 9/10\n\nPrice: $$$\n\nAtmosphere: 10/10", "author": "Joe M."}

Even though it's tucked away in a nondescript corner of Hayes Valley, it seems like everyone knows about this German gem. It is particularly crowded for Brunch which only occurs on Sundays. My most recent visit involved an unfortunately timed arrival when a stampede of people breezed past us. We were offered a seat at the bar immediately, which is actually a dark alcove behind the bar with bar stools and a thin slab of wood to place the food plates. After stewing there for awhile and contemplating how we were going to fit all our dishes in the limited space, we decided to generously relinquish our seats and keep waiting an actual table, which was also communal, but hey - at least it entailed more surface area. \n\nWe ordered Bananaweizen; this was the first time I had banana beer and it certainly won't be the last. The banana juice was very concentrated and left a sweet aftertaste. Just remember to stir it up because the juice tends to sink to the bottom. The beer comes in different liter increments and different vessels, including a boot of epic proportions. \n\nI ordered one of their brunch specials - a spin on their emperor's pancake, which came with banana and apple instead of the usual brandied raisins. The portion was generous and the pancake was crisp on the outside, not too doughy. I really liked the plum compote on the side, not so much the apple one. \n\nThe other entree we ordered was the schnitzel and spaetzle. I told them I wanted to trade the breaded porkloin for the sauteed one which came with the entree. They gave us the breaded porkloin, but covered it nonetheless with the mushroom sauce. They also gave us potatoes as a side instead of spaetzle, and ended up bringing us some spaetzle on a separate plate later. What a lucky mistake - the potatoes were the best home fries I had in a while. \n\nThe service was slower than snails. It took them nearly half an hour to take our order, but they were really trying to hustle, so I have to give them credit. It was still really awkward since we made eye contact with the waitress multiple times and she took orders from people sitting at the same table as us and promptly left, but I think they have a systematic system of serving who was seated first. We chewed on complimentary bread during this time. The bill came fast enough but had two overcharge mistakes. It was fine though because they rectified them before anybody got hurt.", "author": "Alice L."}

It was jam packed (literally standing room only) and insanely loud. Now don't get me wrong, I like the boisterous, friendly atmosphere and it's good to be around people having a solid good time, but this was pretty ridic. \n\nSo as soon as I walk in, I spot my friends near the bar and have to fight my way through the super dense crowd to get to them. We're waiting for our table for about 20 minutes and sweating bullets because it's just a mass of bodies. Two people in the group ended up getting the beer boots, which is pretty ambitious for one person to finish. (They have you pay a $50 deposit beforehand in case you break the boot.) We finally get a table and end up sharing it with some couple, but it's a good time and no one minds. \n\nThis place is just meat and more meat, with some paltry salad options, but definitely not vegetarian friendly. All the dishes we ordered were variations on mashed potatoes and slabs of meat, but it was all super tasty and satisfying. There's nothing to fill you up quite like a German meal! \n\nThe service was good and the staff was super friendly. I'm surprised they managed to get everyone's food to them without spilling, given how crowded it was. The line for the bathroom is pretty long, so if you're drinking a lot of beer, be aware! \n\nSolid place for a weekend dinner with a group (and the bigger the group, the better it seems!).

Everything from the Potato Pancakes to the Vesperplatte to the Jaegerschnitzel to the Sauerbraten and everything in between is awesome. They've hit a real sweet spot in their cooking. \n\nThe atmosphere is not for those who want a quiet evening away from strangers. There's communal seating and a boisterous atmosphere. They have a really nice beer selection. Nothing obscure, but everything is delicious. \n\nThere is only one downside to Suppenkuche: the probable wait.

Beers come in a variety of sizes ranging from a reasonable .4 Liters (everything is done in metric here in European style) to a WHOPPING 5 liter beer marathon. Last night I had the Salvator which came in a .5 liter mug roughly the size of an ogre's fist.  \n\nThe potato pancakes are AWESOME, super crispy and served with an unsweetened apple sauce. The cheese spatzle is a MUST-TRY, served with an incredibly creamy onion sauce. Suppenkuche is also well known for their soups, the mushroom soup is awesome!\n\nSuppenkuche is basically a home run, there are only two tricky parts. 1. It gets really crowded and the wait can get long even on week nights. 2. The seating is communal, and gets VERY jam packed.

This specific location, which I can't even pronounce correctly, was suggested by a couple peers after a morning of rock climbing in SF. Hours are limited at this location and only open their doors during the evening at 5pm. After arriving at the location roughly 30 min before opening, the line to enter was already starting to snake its way around the back side of the restaurant. Soon after being seated at the bar, we were quickly provided excellent service by a friendly bartender who knew much and more about the German food, beer, and culture of what was being served. We started off with a recommended beer that was ages away from disappointment. Very smooth to the taste that surprisingly accommodated a kicker of inebriation  to start off the evening. After the first round of drinks was served, we were given an appetizer of pretzels with butter and mustard to help wash down. This ultimately lead to a few more drinks and snacks which made the evening fantastically enjoyable. Bottom line is this place has great food, excellent service, and sets an environment that is both classy and enjoyable for people of all types to experience.

I had the jagerschnitzel with spaetzle and a bananaweizen. The food was fresh and simply scrumptious. The beer was a tasty twist on the standard hefeweizen.\n\nHowever... the reason this place is getting a 2 star is due to two glaring issues.\n\n#1 - the atmosphere is love it or hate it, I hate it. When you walk in there's no waiting area and it immediately feels awkward as you try and find the hostess while stumbling over patrons trying to enjoy their meal. It's also VERY loud, beyond what I consider acceptable for a restaurant. Hell, it's even loud by bar standards.\n\n#2 - the wait. Granted, I showed up asking for a table for 2 around 7PM on Friday so I'm expecting a wait but we were quoted 20-30min by the hostess. We came back 20min later to check on our position and the hostess gave me a puzzled look then chuckled and said \"did I say that? wow, I'm sorry... yea it's going to be at least another hour or so. Please check back every 20min with me.\" This may have just been an off night for them but none the less it left me with a poor taste for this establishment.

Fortunately this left plenty of table seats as well as the bar by the time I reached the door.  Equally fortunate, the Oktoberfest beers had arrived that day, allowing a rare draft of Weihenstephaner Korbinian.\n\nWhile waiting on my schnitzel I ordered pretzels, which came out unbelievably perfectly: hot, just a bit crusty and perfectly chewy, with a side of obatzda. Many restaurants provide tubs of the stuff like it's cream cheese for your bagels; Suppenkuche's is a small, rich dollop that nonetheless is more than enough for its two accompanying pretzels.   Between that and the Korbinian I was well on my way to being satisfied with my dinner.\n\nBut then the jaeger schnitzel arrived and further elevated the meal. Perhaps the best, succinct impression of the dish is that one could reasonably expect fried pork covered in mushroom gravy to be an absolute rock in the stomach. But it's not. Even after pretzels and beer I found myself cleaning the plate in a few minutes. Hearty, satisfying, yes, but surprisingly light for all of that.  The accompanying salad -- one in the asian slaw style, simply lettuce dressed with vinegar -- is a simple and excellent contrast to the pork, gravy, and buttery spaetzle.\n\nI had been told what to expect from Suppenkuche, and they still wowed me.

This place was packed, thank god we had a reservation---highly recommend it if you have a big party which we did, there were 10 of us. First off, the service was great. When we were running late, they were very accommodating and held the table for 15 minutes. Then as we slowly trickled in, we ordered the pretzels. Wow....one of the best pretzels ever. It comes with this amazing spread which melts in your mouth. Talk about yummy goodness. \nFor the entree, I ordered the venison. This was my first time trying venison so I was a bit scared. The first few bites were great---it was different. I loved the sauces it was in and the pasta like sides. I have to admit, after the first piece of venison (they give you 2 generous piecies), the flavor of the meat got very strong. A bit overwhelming for me, so I stopped there. I think I just didn't like venison but I ate everything else. All in all, good food, except I personally decided I don't like venison, great service, and a trendy spot to grab a drink. The neighborhood is very cute also--there are tons of other restaurants and boutiques nearby.", "author": "Regina W."}

I'm not sure who came up with that one but it totally worked and was pretty tasty. We both got a pint of each and were sipping in no time. We came on a Friday night and the place was busy but they were cycling tables pretty quickly so we got to seat in there in less than 20 minutes. \n\nThe place reminds you of a tavern or something where you go and sit together with all your friends on some wooden tables and just all hang out. The seating is like that, no individual tables, just a bunch of big tables that they seat everyone in where they can fit you so you won't get a romantic, intimate atmosphere from that. Our waiter was this guy with a heavy German accent and he explained all the beers and helped us find something we would like, I loved the choice he made for me. \n\nWe ended up getting the potato cakes which is almost a hash brown but really crunchy. It comes with an applesauce and the mixture seems weird but works well with each other. The crunch and starch of the potato mixed with the little sweetness of the applesauce complimented each other perfectly. Some bits were a little burnt so maybe an issue with consistency but it was tasty nonetheless. I then ordered the brats and my girl got the schnitzel that comes with a side of spatzel. The sausages were the best German sausages I've ever had. It came with sauerkraut and mashed potato and some spicy mustard and I was in heaven. It's essentially a sausage plate instead of putting the whole package on the bun but it was so damn good. I'm thinking about it right now and my mouth is watering. My girl's schnitzel was breaded well and cooked well but the sauce was just a tad on the salty side but I love me some salt but the girl was not a fan. The spatzel was also cooked perfectly and the whole package made me feel like I was in Germany during Oktoberfest or something. \n\nThe portions are BIG so we were so full after food and beer that we decided to pass on dessert.

But my partner spent a summer in Bonn & Frankfort. Based on our experience, the food at Suppenk\u00fcche is very authentically German, as was the hostess who seated us. \n\nWe've only been here once, for brunch, but will probably be back soon. My partner had the Kaiserschmarrn, a baked pancake that was fluffy and only very slightly eggy, sliced up and served with applesauce, plum compote, raisins, and bananas (it was a special; the regular Kaiserschmarrn doesn't have the bananas or the plum compote). The plum compote in fact tasted the way Czech povidla is supposed to taste but never does, and reminded me of my Czech-German grandmother's plum sauce: tart, tangy, full of plum flavor. \n\nI had the J\u00e4gerschnitzel (hunter's schnitzel), which I love and can only rarely find.  Classically J\u00e4gerschnitzel is made with a veal cutlet, sauteed or breaded and fried, served with a mushroom & wine sauce. I have had better in Vienna, but mainly because I like the heartier version with red wine and caramelized onions. Suppenk\u00fcche makes theirs with a white wine sauce and light on the onions--also sauteed without breading. It was tender, tasty, full of mushroom flavor and the delicate veal cutlet. The sp\u00e4tzle on the side were perfectly done as well, tender and slightly buttery. It came with a salad of butter lettuce with an oniony vinaigrette. \n\nSuppenk\u00fcche has an impressive selection of German beers, both bottled and draft. They also have a number of German soft drinks, including redcurrant and elderberry juices and sodas. \n\nThe only downside to our experience must be noted: at one end of the dining room was a table of about a dozen people, mostly in their 20s, who were louder than I have ever heard in a normal restaurant--loud to the point that people next to us were commenting on it.

The ambience is great -- though, I might add, it can be super noisy, so don't be afraid to raise your voice ha. The food was fun... I've frequented a couple other German restaurants in SF, and this was my favorite so far (doesn't hurt that it's in Hayes Valley).

I've heard about Suppenkuch because they serve the Das Boot (my gfs love to drink) but never knew they served such delicious food. Came here on a tues night and it was a packed house! We waited about 25 mins for a seat (make sure you let them know your entire party is there or else they will skip you). Not sure why but the hostess assumed my bf was alone so she didn't seat us until we followed up with her. Anywho, the seating is communal so you will share tables. I wasn't thrilled with the seating arrangement at first but it actually turned out fine; we had plenty of room, but I had to try really hard not to eavesdrop on other's conversations...\n\nOnto the food, the potatoe pancakes are SOO GOOOD. They were crispy on the outside and soft inside and not too greasy. They also went very well with the applesauce. I LOVE potatoes so I might be a little bit bias but the potatoe pancakes are a must get in my book, so good! We also had the sausage and pork chop dishes and both were very delicious, super flavorful and not too salty. I also really liked their sauerkraut! Wash it all down with some beer and you got yourself a super tasty dinner. The portions were hefty as well. \n\nService was kind of lacking but nothing to complain about.

I ALMOST give it 5 stars, but any German Restaurant is going to have an unfair disadvantage with my reviews... as my Mother-In-Law's Sauerbraten und Sp\u00e4tzle has set the standard - and it really cannot be touched! ;)\n\nThis place is a blast, though.  Classic Bavarian family style dining.  You're going to meet new people here, and eat along side them.  If that makes you uncomfortable, I recommend just ordering another fine brew... you'll loosen up! Ha!  \n\nFood is darn good. My favorite dish is the Venison (Gebratene Rehmedaillions) - it melts in your mouth & tastes unbelievable!  The Sauerbraten is okay - but tougher/drier than I like... just go with the Venison, you will not be disappointed.\n\nThe Potato Pancakes are good, but I actually prefer the Pretzel with that super yummy cheesy dip (forget the name - but it is SO classic Bavarian!).  \n\nEvery single dessert I have ever had here is Schuhplattler Slappin' good! Seriously - they will blow you away! The Black Forrest Cake is pure heaven.\n\nParking is a bear & this place gets super busy. My recommendation? Get there early for dinner - around 4:30pm. Go across the street for a Happy Hour Beer, if ya want (little caf\u00e9 has coffee, tea, beer, wine) & watch 'till they open the door.  Worked great - no wait time.\n\nTip #2 - Check their web site! Lots of fun stuff goes on there! Oktoberfest celebrations (9/21/13 this year), Gnome Week (how can you NOT love that??), and more!", "author": "Reena R."}

For the past 10 years this has been my all time favorite restaurant, until my last visit.  I've had great experiences here in the past, with a fun and social environment, great beer, good German food, what's not to like?\n\nWe recently tried to take an out of town friend here, and after years of explaining how awesome this place was to her I was truly embarrassed.  We waited nearly two hours to be seated after initially being told it would take only one, and continually were told it would be another 15 minutes when we asked an hour in.\n\nThe family style seating is one of the fun things about this place, but also its achilles heal.  Since there were 3 of us we continually watched party after party who had put their names in AFTER us be seated in front of us; as explained by the hostess this is because they filled the capacity of the table more efficiently.  Apparently their seating policy is to fill the table to capacity first, and secondary is the order in which you put your name in.  Fair?  Sure didn't feel like it to me after watching this for nearly two hours.\n\nThe food this time was good, but not great like it has been in the past.  I usually get the schnitzel which they do very well, but this time it was quite salty and not as hot and fresh as usual.  Potato pancakes were also not as hot and crunchy as they have been in the past.\n\nI'm not sure if I'll be back.  Perhaps if I get there before they open to insure I don't go through this again, I might try it once more.  I wouldn't dare getting here after 5:30 PM.", "author": "Derek W."}

And then we proceeded to knock back a couple more boots. Schroeder's is another favorite in my city, but there's something about the warm, cozy, (cramped, sweaty) atmosphere of Suppenkuche that makes the experience all so unique.\n\nThat said, logistically this place is a mess to get a reservation. I'd definitely recommend getting a group of 6 or more and making a reservation. Otherwise be prepared to wait around an hour to two hours for a table. Weekend nights this is definitely typical.

Not as cool once you translate in English. \n\nI came here during brunch and ordered the Emperor's Pancake with brandied raisins, served with apple & plum compote. It was rather yummy in my mouth. The pancakes was cut up and semi-drenched in the compote and with the apple and plum compote, it provides a sweet and sour taste. At first glance, it looks like old-people mushy food but go ahead and take a bite! After this meal, it might even convince you to eat more mushy food. Well...maybe.\n\nWhat makes this place neat and kind of not neat is the limited seating. With few seating areas, you can share a table with strangers. This is a fun way to socialize with the other guests because you may be seated next to an older couple who dresses quite trendy for their age (red-frame glasses and a faux mo-hawk!) or nearby a dude with the bluest eye ever.

(And I don't just mean the Urban Dictionary definition of the term...)\n\nI came here for brunch (no lines!) while my mom was visiting and, despite the warning from our server, way over-ordered. (He actually said \"no\" when I asked if I could order a 4th dish. He stopped objecting after that.) With so many sausages on their menu I had a hard time choosing. So I got them all! Well, most of them anyway. To make it a more balanced meal, we got some non-meat items too.\n\nBefore I get into the food I gotta mention their SAUERKRAUT. Suppenkuche makes my favourite sauerkraut I've had outside of Germany--not too acidic and soft without being mushy. (I'm not a fan of crunchy kraut). It just kinda dissolves onto whatever food you put it on. If you order it on the side it also comes with cubes of braised pork meat/fat, so it's NSFV (not safe for vegetarians). I gobbled up two orders of this stuff with all the sausages!\n\n*3 SMALL BRATWURST (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DGyoVB9PdI9_jw0CNi_OPg?select=-MpLUN6oyp7QmsUMFUJlEQ): These were small, indeed. (Imagine 3 long skinny fingers.) The texture wasn't as fine as I'd expected but they were still plenty flavourful. Perfect for pairing with their fantastic sauerkraut!\n\n*WEI\u00dfWURST - WHITE VEAL & PORK SAUSAGES IN BUTTER BROTH WITH PRETZEL (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DGyoVB9PdI9_jw0CNi_OPg?select=4d9SHiKni5ikl1HJ7NUljw): My favourite of the sausages. (And great with kraut!) The white sausages were plump and moist with a really fine texture. Milder in flavour than the bratwurst but the texture totally won me over. Very comforting--like the congee of sausages. I also enjoyed the way the casing \"popped\" as I cut into it. The pretzel was also very good but the butter broth was way too salty to actually drink.\n\n*20CM FRANKFURTER SAUSAGE: Ordered as a side, this didn't look quite as impressive since they cut it into two 10cm-long sausages. It was tasty, but nothing all that special. (Unless, of course, you eat it with the sauerkraut!)\n\n*BAVARIAN MEATLOAF WITH EGGS & ROASTED POTATOES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DGyoVB9PdI9_jw0CNi_OPg?select=Ju7PE1kvIRdFdPqU3xqdYg): Not quite a sausage but still a processed meat item. The meatloaf reminded me of spam (which I love) but more refined and with a finer texture. It had some bounce to it and tasted great with the sunny side eggs and sauerkraut. The roasted potatoes were pretty yummy too.\n\n*GERMAN RAVIOLI SCRAMBLED WITH EGGS & ONIONS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DGyoVB9PdI9_jw0CNi_OPg?select=We8wHUPgVxvWx0RiPFEmwQ): A very hearty and flavourful egg scramble with cut up pieces of ravioli and slivered onions mixed in. I loved it, especially topped with some kraut. The light and refreshing cucumber salad provided a nice balance too.\n\n*EMPEROR'S PANCAKE WITH BRANDIED RAISINS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DGyoVB9PdI9_jw0CNi_OPg?select=sCSMFRwBiRPiplCadbuuOQ): This comprised of cut up pancake pieces loaded with raisins and dusted with powdered sugar. The pancake was of a thinner variety but still very moist. The raisins added sweetness and the apple sauce was the perfect accompaniment.\n\n*APPLE STRUDEL WITH VANILLA ICE CREAM (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DGyoVB9PdI9_jw0CNi_OPg?select=-GG_djHCUlxStRWDVEVILA): This would've been a lot better if the strudel was warmed and the crust was crispy.

You definitely can't wait in there.\n\nOur party had reserved the dining hall in the back. Huge bench tables! With benches! A little bit inconvenient, but that is why you try to get the outside bench seats. Regardless, it is a little awkward because right behind you, there is a window where you can see the food being set out for the wait staff to deliver the food.\n\nOur waitress was really sweet and friendly and was ready to answer any questions and make good recommendations. We got the chicken meat loaf, and it was good! Juicy, soft, warm, and very satisfying! The shallot sauce was better than gravy for both the meat loaf and at the mashed potatoes. Portions are big, so rather than getting separate entrees, if you are very hungry then it's better to go with one entree and one appetizer, or just one entree. \n\nOne thing to note: most entrees are pork or beef. I'm not a huge fan of either (unless it's a burger or a hot dog), so if you don't like either meats, then be prepared to have a very limited choice in food.\n\nThe only complaint I have is that we weren't told until the last minute that the boots are restricted to four per table. My boyfriend had also ordered a boot, but he wasn't told that they would cancel his order if the boot quota was filled. It's ok though. I didn't want him to drink that much anyways.", "author": "Hayne P."}

The wait at this place can be quite long but not to worry there is a biergarten two blocks away that's associated with the restaurant so hop on over for a liter of beer or you can wait at the bar but that's gets crowded. Needless to say they have an impressive German beer selection. \nHaving a girlfriend that's German always helps when you go to a German restaurant or so they say. We ordered the herring for starters which paired very well with the apples covered with a yogurt dill sauce and farm fresh vegetables, the beets were delectable. \nFor the main course we were excited to try the various dishes so did family style. We got the Marinated beef with Lingonberries, red cabbage & Sp\u00e4tzle, the veal wiener schnitzel with potato salad, and the cheese Sp\u00e4tzle. For me the schnitzel was excellent as good as the ones you get in Vienna followed by the cheese Sp\u00e4tzle. The beef was decent but the red cabbage lacked the tartness and the plain Sp\u00e4tzle was too bland.

For a party of four, the wait was about 30 minutes (try not to get seated by the door, even though this is California, it still gets quite cold). Hubby and I sat down, each ordered 3 dishes.

Watching my friend finish the 2liter boot was the fun part about dinner,.  which he ended up throwing up at the end.\n\nI had a .5 liter of beer,. perfect size for me.  it starts with a K, dry and its similar to guiness?! it was good,. \n\nWe also had a noisy crazy loud table next to us,. which made the experience a bit difficult to enjoy.  I heard tables around us telling them to be quiet,. tables leaving and giving them stares,. creating a pretty hostile environment to be in.  The waiter acknowledged the loud noise, complaints and approached the loud table,. telling them that tables were leaving and they weren't going to serve them anymore. I was shocked, but very proud of the waiter for stepping up. \n\nWe also ended up leaving,. after we finished our food and booze.  \n\nDef a place you should try out once,. for the 2liter das boot,. but def not a great place to be at,. when there is a bunch of roudy drunks!", "author": "Chanel L."}

I haven't had an authentic Radler since I was in Germany!\n\nThe first thing I thought of when I was thinking of coming here was \"are they just going to have Wursts and Bier and call themselves a 'German Restaurant' because I hate that...\" -- The answer was NO.\n\nI was greeted by someone who sounded like she was German by her accent... and told that they seat you as you come and the tables are mixed. For someone who was traveling solo, this was perfect... and if I was in a group, it would have been fun too. (For parties of 6 or more you can make reservations).\n\nI was so tempted to get the K\u00e4sesp\u00e4tzle mit Zwiebel-Butterso\u00dfe (essentially a mac and cheese with an onion and butter sauce) as I loved this dish when it was made for me in Germany... and as much as I wanted it, I decided to go with the Wiener Schnitzel which came with potatoes and a side cucumber and tomato salad.\n\nEverything was SO good... and took me back to when I was living in Bavaria.

I looked at the menu and had about as much idea what it was as how to pronounce it, which was zero. My only other experience with German food was at a sub-par Gastropub where food was bleh and service was worse. I expected Suppenkuche to be similar but with better food and booze. I was so pleasantly surprised in every way.\n\nSuppenkuche is actually a small restaurant of two adjoining rooms. It has picnic-like wooden tables that were all lit with candles for a warm, cozy atmosphere. Although the hostess said the wait was 30-45 mins, my bf and I were seated within 5. They had a good selection of beer so that's what we started with - a dark Doppelbock for him and a sweet Hefe for me. I'd read great things about the saut\u00e9ed pork w/ mushrooms but neither of us were pork fans. My bf ordered the skirt steak from the Christmas Eve menu and I ordered the braised beef.\n\nThe food was amazing! I love that it was so savory and bursting with flavor. It had a different taste than what I'm used to with Asian or other ethnic foods. The braised beef was soft and had a slight alcohol taste as if were marinated in cider. It came with cranberry sauce and spatzle, which I think is sauerkraut immersed in a red sauce. The spatzle was good but I ate it sparingly so I wouldn't drown out the beef which was already drenched in its own sauce. \n\nThe piece I had of my bf's steak was also delicious, so flavorful that I'm sure it wasn't just cooked with salt and pepper. It came with a side of fried potatoes and bacon bits that was a trillion times better than grocery store-bought bacon. Although a little pricey at $18.50 a plate, the portions were so large that it completely filled my bf's hearty appetite and left me with leftovers. \n\nI still don't know how to pronounce anything but I do know that I've become a fan of German food. Things to order next time: potato pancakes, beer boot (2 liters!).", "author": "Thuy T."}

It's an oddball little joint that looks tremendously unassuming until you walk in the door, and into a Bierkeller that looks like it just happened organically on a San Francisco corner.\n\nBy way of warning - vegetarians, don't bother, unless all you want is good beer.  This is German food, not German-style, with all that entails.  Meat, meat, meat, cabbage, potatoes, spaetzle, and meat.  The saurbraten was a callback to my youth and dinner at my grandmother's, and the liter of Franziskaner Weisse I had along with it went down perfectly. My companions tore through the jaegerschnitzel and the venison medallions they ordered.\n\nWith three of us, we did a fair amount of damage to a gemischte salat (potato salad, slaw, red cabbage, pickled beets, pickled carrot) and a sausage and cheese sampler plate (head cheese FTW!) with cornichons, as well as a goodly sized chunk of apple strudel with vanilla ice cream.  \n\nIs this high cuisine?  No, of course not, but it's solid, enjoyable food in an interesting venue with good beer.  A decent value for an evening's meal in the City.

That's right only one more to go before I hit the big 100.\n\nI just have to say that SUPPENKUCHE is delicious! \n\nI came with a big group of about 10 friends and everyone enjoyed their experience here. The food, the beer, and the overall environment just summed up to an awesome night. If you have a slightly larger group I highly suggest calling in to make a reservation. They'll seat you in the back room where the tables are a lot longer and can fit more people.\n\nThe restaurant is casual and fits the name of the establishment which means \"soup kitchen\" in English. You'll see what I mean when you walk in and see the bench like tables.\n\nOur group started off with trying the Potato Pancakes with Homemade Apple Sauce (Reibekuchen mit hausgemachtem Apfelmus) as our appetizer. These scrumptous discs of joy are SO addicting! Any fan of hashbrowns will immediately fall in love with these easily. I know I did. The potatoes are shredded and are extra crispy when fried. The apple sauce might seem like a weird combination at first, but it works! \n\nFor my main dish I tried the Sauteed Venison Medallions in Red Wine Plum Sauce with Red Cabbage & Sp\u00e4tzle (Gebratene Rehmedaillions in Rotwein-Pflaumenso\u00dfe mit Rotkohl und Sp\u00e4tzle). I didn't taste much of the gamey flavor with the Venison so that was good. The meat consistency was a little tougher than beef, but aside from the meat being a little chewy it was still a great dish. \n\nThe Red Cabbage has a sweet, tart flavor that can be a hit or miss with people. I personally enjoy it so I didn't mind having it on my plate. It actually comes with most of the dishes at Suppenk\u00fcche. The Sp\u00e4tzle look like little pieces of noodles and works as the carbs of the dish.\n\nI got to sample some of my friends dishes so I know what I would like to order and not order next time I come.  The Grilled Cured Pork Chop with Sauerkraut & Mashed Potatoes (Kassler vom Grill mit Sauerkraut und Kartoffelbrei) has a really delicious and tender pork. It tasted like a chunk of ham. I would like to get this the next time I come.\n\nWhat I probably won't get is the Breaded and Sauteed Porkloin\nwith Roasted Potatoes & Green Salad (Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein\nmit Bratkartoffeln und gr\u00fcnem Salat). This tasted like Pork Tonkatsu and I wasn't a fan of the roasted potatoes. I'm a hashbrown person all the way.\n\nOn to the BEER. I'm a big fan of Belgian brews so I tried the Blanche de Bruxelles that comes in a 0.3 liter size. It's a Belgian White beer so it has a light and cloudy/hazy apperance, but it also has a bold flavor that I thought was stronger than the Hefeweizen. It didn't match too well with the Venison, but it was worth trying.\n\nWith all the beer and food I was totally ready to K.O. after my meal. The portions are huge and you'll get full unless you have the appetite of a monster!!\n\nI really enjoyed my experience Suppenk\u00fcche and I can't wait to come back again.\n\n== A MUST TRY! ==", "author": "Jason H."}

By this point we weren't as hungry as we were earlier so we ended up just ordering the wiener schnitzel with cheese spatzel, which was absolutely delicious and huge (two huge pieces of pork) and followed it with a black forest cake for dessert (also really good, and not too sweet).\n\nOverall the food was very good and hearty; perfect for a cold January night.

There is a bar in the center with several chalkboards on the walls with a list of German biers on tap.  Next to the bar is a slightly hidden cove which is an area that gives you more of the bar feel.

Pretzels aren't my thing, but people seem to like them with their beer, especially when topped with melted cheese.  My personal favorite German dish is the traditional Wiener Schnitzel - tender pork pounded thin, breaded, fried, and served with traditional potato salad.  I've had a recent obsession with spaetzle, so the J\u00e4gerschnitzel is perfect - mushroom sauce over pork loin and spaetzle.  They do pork well, including a pork chop and sausage, but they also have venison if pork isn't your meat of choice.  They also had a half roasted chicken that was super flavorful.\n\nThey have tons of beer, but I might be the only person who prefers the Gruner Veltliner (one of my favorite types of Austrian/German wine) goes better with the pork dishes.  Though they have red wines by the glass, I'm not sure how well they go with the food.  As for the beers, the list changes every so often, but I'm a hef fan (with a squeeze of lemon!) and they have plenty of draft options (and bottles).  For the most authentic experience, you have to try your beer out of a boot.  Surprisingly, they even have non-alcoholic German beer (umm I guess if you just like the flavor and don't actually want the EtOH...), but it's the same price as real alcohol (if not more expensive).\n\nFor vegetarians (and non vegetarians), I love potato pancakes with apple sauce.  Mushroom ravioli is on the heavier side but is also good for vegetarians.  Cheese spaetzle is like a better textured mac n cheese, but it's also on the heavier side (but that's why Germans are so traditionally well built, right?  j/k).\n\nI've never seen a place where the line for the men's bathroom is longer than the one for the girls, but I guess it's because all the guys are drinking the 2L boots.\n\nThey do take reservations for larger groups (max 20 people, must all show up on time).

I therefore feel entitled to comment with some authority about sausages/and/or Germany.\n\nThe first thing about this place is the overwhelming aura of hype.  Before I had even unpacked my apartment friends were asking if I had been.   Friends of friends were raving about the sausages.   Little birds sang out 'Sauerkraut, sauerkraut!' in the Hayes Valley morning.\n\nI cruised by several times, only to be dissuaded by the enormous lines wrapping around the corner.   I'm not waiting an hour for what amounts to mashed potatoes and a hot dog.\n\nOn my actual visit, I came just as they opened, and scored a prime table, and had the joint pretty much to myself.\n\nThe food is... well, it's okay.  There's a lot of it.   By the time you pile through a plate of sausage, sauerkraut and potatoes you feel heavy, listless, sleepy.   One wonders how the Germans almost conquered Europe twice eating like this.\n\nThe staff were indifferent, as staff tend to be at popular joints.   \n\nI did like the hyperminimalistic decor-- just wooden tables and simple menus-- every baroque extravagence stripped away with German engineering efficiency.\n\nThe net experience left me confused:  At the end of the day, the food reminded me if anything, as one of those places at a busy airport terminal:  Bland, non-offensive, designed to put you to sleep and sell some liquor.   \n\nWithin the 45 minutes my meal took, the place went from 'Just me eating alone' to 'jam packed birthday party celebrations' with loud clinking and cheering.   This is the opposite of an intimate place for a date or a quiet meal-- come here prepared for revelry and drinking.   \n\nDid not impress.

We began with a round of cold beers and the appetizer plate with ham, blood sausage, salami, and cheese.  It was delicious and diverse in pig parts (my favorite was the pate), but I much prefer the house-made salumi platter at Leopold's, which is not only bigger but cheaper.  We also had the pretzels, which I can't say were superior to Aunty Anne's Pretzels.  Yikes. \n\nI wasn't hungry, so I ordered an appetizer as my entree.  I selected the currywurst, an appetizer that wasn't much smaller than an entree, substituting potato pancakes for fried potatoes.  The currywurst was so unimpressive.  This is my favorite German street food, and Suppenkuche's version was just bland sausage in mostly tomato sauce with a hint of curry.  \n\nI was so happy with the potato pancakes, though.  Suppenkuche does them better than anywhere else, including Leopold's.  Here, they're crisp outside, soft inside, and packed with potato.  I especially love them with the homemade apple sauce as an appetizer.\n\nI also tried some of DF's wiener schitzel and MS's bratwurst and spatzle.  Their dishes were much better than my currywurst but equally heavy and unhealthy.   Where are all the veggies besides potato (sauerkraut doesn't count)?  How can a culture's cuisine be based solely on meat and potatoes?

I have been let down at most of my attempts so far, but Suppenk\u00fcche is about as good as it gets.\n\nWhen we arrived, within seconds we were greeted and had our name put down on a list. We barely were able to order a couple of beers (Hofbrau and Spaten, naturally) at the bar before our table was ready. Its all communal style, so we shared our table with two other parties of two. It was all good, nobody go in anyone else's space and it was rather comfortable.\n\nAfter getting seated and finishing up our warm-up .5 liter beers, we ordered my main reason for coming here: DAS BOOT! It seems to be more of a novelty stateside than it is in Germany, but still awesome nonetheless. When ordering a boot, keep in mind their policy is to keep a credit card on hand, as they will charge you $50 if you break the boot. So drink carefully!\n\nOur food came out pretty quickly, we shared two separate orders. One was two pretzels with a cheese dip, and the other was the 20cm sausages with eggs and potatoes. The food was good! And everything seemed authentic, even down to the spicy mustard and the snap of the sausages. I was used to bigger Bavarian pretzels but at least Suppenk\u00fcche got the lye right.\n\nAfter all was finished, naturally we ordered another boot. This time it was of Radler, a very tasty and refreshing mix of mostly beer (Helles) and some lemon lime soda. There is a precise skill to getting this mix just right, and the Radler we were served here was just as good as anything I had in Germany. I find Radler to be a good choice for the last drink, and I made sure I was pretty buzzed when I drank it in Germany and here too.\n\nI will definitely be coming back when I am in the city again, my only disappointment that quickly faded here was the lack of a TV. With Munich and Dortmund playing in the DFB Supercup, it was the only thing missing from the German experience here, other than the actual language.", "author": "Chris B."}

The boot requires a $50 deposit (in case you break the thing) and the cost ranges from about $5-$7 per .5 liter.  So a boot is 2 liters, so do the math.....total cost is going to be around $20-$24. You can also order smaller or larger sizes of all their draft beers. \n\nI have no complaints about the food or the booze and although it's family style seating, when you go with a group, it's not really an issue.

The pictures of my friends ordering large boot glasses, essentially 2 liters of beer, always really impressed me. If you were enjoying strictly drinks here, then I would give this place a strong 4-5 stars, but I was here for drinks and a meal to celebrate my friend's birthday.\n\nThe curb appeal of the restaurant is currently lacking because of the street construction but that's not really their fault. Once you step inside, you feel transported into a cellar like atmosphere. The walls are painted white and are nicely litup by natural light. It may be hard to spot at first because there are so many people and the atmosphere is lively, but the ceiling is decorated with wooden birds hung by hooks on the wall organized in flocks. It looks like the owners rearrange them for fun frequently because there are so many hooks all over the ceiling. The bar area is a key focal point as you step in and is really inviting.\n\nI really liked the selection of beer on draft and bottle that they had available. The bartender was really helpful too in asking how dark of a beer I wanted and pointing to the right selection. I had a Weltenburger Dunkel, which is a really dark caramel colored beer. It went down really nicely, and I brought it with me over to my table once my friends were all together. We decided upon sharing a Reibekuchen mit hausgemachtem Apfelmus (or Potato Pancake with Homemade Apple Sauce) to start things off. Unfortunately, I found a long hair strand in my portion. Not a very good start. Then the entrees came out. We ordered: two rib eye steaks (a special); two half chickens; one Wiener Schnitzel; and one Lentil Soup (for a Vegan amongst us). For myself, I had the rib eye steak and I was not blown away, but it was certainly good and cooked to my liking (medium-rare) with some nice truffle butter. This made up for the hair in the potato pancake. I tried some of the chicken, which I wish I had ordered instead. That was moist and tasty. \n\nBeing a special day, I pulled the waiter aside and let him know that it was my friend's birthday right after I ordered. Usually you don't think twice about it, but there was a long pause after all our entree dishes were taken away. I was waiting for the waiter to come by with the slice of cake for my friend, but instead he came by with dessert menus and asked if we would like dessert. Some friends who didn't exactly know either, just said, \"Oh its his birthday!\" The waiter then admitted he completely forgot! Classy move! So we waited several minutes as the waiter came back out with a slice of cake for the birthday dude.  Hoorah! This was the second hiccup of the meal. Although, these were personal things that I experienced as a diner and some of my other friends had less of a feeling towards this, I felt like the staff could have tried harder. \n\nThe meal ended up being around $26 for each person, not including drinks. You might add $6-8 dollars for a beer to that tab. I would say it was slightly overvalued, but being my friends birthday certainly good times. Another thing of note, the decibal level is off the charts, because of the acoustics in this restaurant. I was sitting about 2 feet away from my friend at the table and I could not hear what she was saying.

We were delighted to get a large table in the back and promised we would be out at 8pm as they had a large reservation. Our server was quirky and on the ball the whole time, promptly bringing us drinks (even when he told me I should finish my beer before ordering another) until we decided we didn't want dinner after all. \n\nWhen he found out we weren't going to order mains, shortly after seating, he told us that their policy is to allow drinks and apps at the bar.

To drive it home. On the fourth time, I told him that we told the hostess upon entrance that we were going to get snacks and maybe food. Maybe there was a miscommunication. Either way we got it. WE TOTALLY HEARD THE FIRST TIME. But to just drive it home even more, he had the hostess come over and explain the miscommunication.\n\nI went to the bar manager and spoke with him about the situation. His response was fairly nonchalant: \"Sorry, the German gruffness is hard to relate too.\" I pointed out that that wasn't the case at all. We had in fact heard the 1st time. We had even apologized to him for our mistake. What was the point of the server to tell us 3 additional times? I tried to explain that the gruffness wasn't the problem, the problem was the server was rude beyond nationality.Who wants to be belittled? Is that how you make people feel comfortable and want to come back? Or because you already have a customer base you can treat people poorly?

Now on to the important part: food and beer! Both were awesome. Don't come here if you're on a diet. I had the cheeze spatzel, and it was like beautiful german mac & cheese on steroids. Also tried some of the bratwurst - amazing saur kraut and the pork bratwurst had a really nice flavor.

Yeah, it's super busy, yeah, it took forever to get our table (even with reservations), and yeah, there was a super annoying laughing hyena all night, but the beer more than made up for it!\n\nThe bartender I happened to order from set me up with an awesome beer.  Honestly, I can't remember what it was, with all their beer names, but he was good at recommending me something based off a few questions.\n\nAll I had to eat that night was the cheese and sausage platter and potato pancakes.  The potato pancakes are basically fancy hash browns, but they were scrumptious nonetheless.  I really enjoyed the wide selection of cheese and sausage on the platter, but my friend didn't seem to care for it as much.\n\nAlas, DAS BOOT!

The website said \"Come on in! No reservation needed!\" So, we walked over and we happened to get there at the 5:00pm opening. We were the last in line, and thus had to sit at the area behind the bar.  Being hungry and excited, it was acceptable. \n\nThe bartenders were very attentive to their regular customers, and rather nice to us first-timers as well (since we had to place our orders through them). It was stuffy and cramped, and then got even MORE stuffy and cramped when the second wave of customers came in. It got loud, but you know what- this place made it seem so enjoyable. San Francisco charm plus European atmosphere. \n\nThe food was superb. On a scale of one to \"made-by-eine Mutter\", this was right up there with a home cooked meal. Everything we ordered was plentiful portions, meats deliciously hot, and cabbages perfectly pickled. The beer and wine selection was fantastic. It's a little slice of Germany.", "author": "Jamie H."}

The location is ideal, corner right in the heart of a flourishing neighborhood (Hayes Valley). The outside is subtle, with a very small sign it's pretty hard to miss. The inside is very cozy with dim lights and a bunch of family style wooden tables. They also have a bar but it is pretty small with about 7-8 seats. You HAVE to try the beer here it's essential. Amazing menu of authentic German beers with something for every pallet. The food was awesome. Started with the potato pancakes served with applesauce, filling and very savory with a good texture.

The reason why you only have a 2 hour limit is because people have made reservations which go from 7-8 weeks ahead. I would suggest bringing a party of 3-6 people because the place is very crowded especially with the bar in the first half of the room.

It comes in a 1.5L and 5L sizes... Good luck with 5 liters of beer!  FYI, you don't save any money buying the boot... the 1.5L beer is 3 times the cost of a 0.5L beer.  But hey, you drank out of a glass boot like some kind of drunk cowgirl Cinderella and no one can ever take that away from you.  \n\nThe reason I rate this place so low is how uncomfortable the actual restaurant is.

Once you find the host, be prepared to wait an ungodly amount of time to eat.  I think we waited 45 minutes on a weeknight.  Once you're inside, give up any hope of communicating.

How can you go to a German restaurant and not try their sausages, right? Best ones I've tried yet. Moist and well seasoned sausages which were paired with sauerkraut and mustard. Fresh salmon was served with capers, which gave it the perfect amount of sourness to it. Last, the lamb chops were perfectly cooked to how it was ordered: medium.

After a trip to London, and staying at a hostel with a large group of hot German guys, I became obsessed with all thing Germans, especially the guys hahaha.  So I decided to learn German and take a trip to Germany last summer.  But I then realized that I had never really had German food except bratwurst ( and even then probably not authentic bc I've always had them on buns).  So i did my research and decided that Suppenk\u00fcche was were I was going to fall in love with German food.  And guess what...I did!! Not only was the food amazing and the atmosphere cozy but they served beers in 2L boots?! Wunderbar!  \n\nOver the many times I've been here since last year, I've has the Potato Pancakes (the BEST I've ever had), the Pickled Herring (not a fan), Gemischter (mixed salad), Wiener Schnitzel, J\u00e4gerschnitzel, Sauerbraten, Gebratene Rehmedaillions (venison), Bratwurst (the way it should be served), and K\u00e4sesp\u00e4tzle (German version of mac and cheese).\n\nI have honestly loved everything I've ordered, with the exception of the pickled herring.  Every time i eat here though, I have to order the Potato Pancakes.  I slather on the extra apple sauce and it's pure perfection.  On my most recent trip, I ordered the K\u00e4sesp\u00e4tzle, spatzle smothered with a onion cheese sauce, because of my Lental obligations. I was glad i gave up meat because this dish was AH-mazing!

Now it wasn't a spur of the moment thought, it was a whole day of thinking where we should go to dinner and we both thought of this place before we even discussed it. Okay I bored you with this nonsense, on to the review. \n\nIt was CROWDED. And the meh part (and almost a minus) was there was no real waiting area other than the bar. Than I thought, \"WTF is wrong with that, Jamie?!?\". Whew where was my head that night. Now if you asked me what my boyfriend got me to drink, I couldn't say. I just know it was amber-like, delicious, and enough beer to inhibit my thoughts of silliness to my scorn of no waiting area. Pffft what a seating snob I am. \n\nWhat I loved about Suppen is their community tables which and bench sitting. I love that environment because I wasn't expecting an intimate double-date evening, but a celebration of visiting relatives and new engagement into my boyfriend's familia. \n\nI know we ordered appetizer, I think it was the Reibekuchen mit hausgemachtem Apfelmus or was it the Maultaschen in Pilzrahmsoe? Hell if I know because that is what happens when you have good food and company, you so do not pay attention to the details except getting to know the people around you. \n\nMy boyfriend and I shared the Gegrillte N\u00fcrnberger Bratwurst\nmit Sauerkraut und Kartoffelbrei, which is sausage (pork) served with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. I believe his cousin ordered the Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein\nmit Bratkartoffeln und gr\u00fcnem Salat  and his fiancee ordered IDK. I think I was more engrossed in the proposal story of my boyfriend's cousin then I was in the food. \n\nHowever, this is what this place does to you. Makes you comfortable. Makes you happy go lucky. Makes you wish you cleaned out your liver after sizing up the boot. Has you counting your pennies to the next time you can come in here and share a 4-liter of beer with friends/family or the people at your table. \n\nDanke and guten zeiten", "author": "Jamie L."}

The food is delicious! Everything we had was great and very authentic. \nThe only downside is that is very difficult to get into.

MmMm....the venison was very tender and flavorful (not salty). The red wine sauce was rich and had a depth in flavor; eminent that it was been sllloooowwwwllly reducing. Ohhh and the spatzle (fried noodles) was SOOOOO YUMMY! It was crisp on the outside and had a bite to it. *drool* \n\n2nd visit: After seeing people order the Pork Knuckle the first time I was at Suppenkuche, I knew I had to have it the second time around. Man, it's like a heart attack on a platter, but worth every bite. The knuckle is MASSIVE...probably as big as two of my knuckles put together. The skin is roasted to a perfect crackling crunch; similar to the chinese suckling pork...YUM! The pork meat is soft, tender, and flavorful. If it weren't for being in a public setting, I would have eaten it Fred Flinestone style! I wasn't too crazy with the bread dumplings as it tasted liked mushed up bread. But, who cares, when the star of the dish is the pork! \n\nSERVICE: This place is ALWAYS packed and the staff is always on the move, so expect to have to wave them down if you want something. But, they're very friendly and accommodating. \n\nAMBIANCE/DECOR: LOUD AND CRAMPED. If you're claustrophobic, don't even think about coming here. The place is always packed and you will be elbow to elbow with others esp if you sit in the communal wooden picnic style tables. Thinking of chilling at the bar to wait for your table? Forget about it, you might as well get a stick just to beat your way through to get a drink. Prepare to be yelling at the person next to you, just so they can hear you. \n\nDespite the drawbacks, the food at Suppenkuche is definitely worth it. Stomp on me, shove me, yell in my ear; but you can't keep me away from that damn heart clogging Pork Knuckle!\n\nAnd, oh, don't forget about them beer boots...hopefully, one day I will get there...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Thinking \"German Beer House\" I thought it would be more like a dark mead all or something...quite the opposite! Although it is small and can be very loud, it is light, airy and have wonderfully cute decorations! \n\nWe arrived around 7pm and there were people milling about outside and at the bar, but we were seated right away. Its family-style seating so we were at the end of a table with a family of four, I don't mind seating like that at all (especially if it means we get in quicker) but the woman at our table was weird...so 0 Yelp stars for her! \n\nI ordered the Potato Soup, which was delicious. Creamy but full of flavor! My BF ordered the Mushroom soup special and he liked it a lot. I thought it tasted like mushroom-water and needed more flavoring, but he ate it all so that was fine. \n\nFor diner I had the Goose Special which was so mouthwatering delicious! It came with some red cabbage that had been pickled (or something) and a potato ball, which was interesting, but the Goose was divine. I got a huge portion, expertly gazed, and sooo tender and juicy. It came with some cranberry sauce which further enhanced the great flavors.\n\nMy BF got the Wild Boar sausage and those were excellent as well, I think he gobbled them up in a matter on minutes. \n\nThe service was great, we had a female waitress who was nice without over doing it, and their bussers are efficient and keep a good eye on the diners and the plates.

My friend and I were given the choices to sit right at the door or to wait 20 minutes. We took the seats closest to the entrance just so we didn't have to wait. The other guys at our table were almost done but they were still have a grand old time. This was my first time eating German food. My friend told me that I should try Spatzle because it is one of those traditional German foods to try. I ended up getting the Wild Boar with mushrooms in cream sauce with spatzle, with the recommendation of the other guy sitting next to me. I tried some of my friend's beers and they weren't too bad, very deep flavors. For entrees, I felt there should have been more boar on my plate for $23. Sure the food was good, and I do love spatzle now, but I would say I got a handful of boar meat, few mushrooms and a ton of cream sauce. I thought that dish, like the others on the menu were priced very steeply for the amount that was given. It was really loud and crowded the entire night. There was a birthday party further into the dining room and beers all around. Suppenkuche seems like a nice place to come have dinner, but I am not that big of a fan of communal seating, especially because the party of guys that came to replace the remaining seats at our table were just awfully loud and annoying. It may also have been just me, but I felt that it was hard to get the waitress's attention since it was so crowded....\n\nIn the end though, I probably won't come back unless; there's a promotion, party, or I can't find another place with good spatzle.

I then said well, I am glad you decided to move back to the states before I was born.

Came back after 45 minutes, not wanting to miss our table....didn't get seated until 7:10 PM! Far longer than one hour. When we were sitting, it took about 15 minutes for them to take our orders, and the journey to the bathroom was harrowing. There were just way, way too many people inside. I feel like this place could get shut down by the fire marshal for overcapacity. It's so loud inside because of the overcrowding that we were unable to really have a conversation the entire meal. \n\nThe beer selection was great and delicious, we enjoyed being able to order beer in copious amounts, and the food was quite tasty. Thus, three stars for good food and drink. I had the potato pancakes (first night of Hannukah, how could I not?) and the asparagus appetizer, which were both delicious. My fiancee had the pickled herring which was surprisingly sweet but the pickled salad underneath it was incredibly tasty. My party shared the pretzels which were just okay.\n\nI'd come here on a week day night, or maybe for lunch, because the food and drink is worth the price. But the Saturday night vibe is not worth the cost of the food.\n\nI'll also add that my party of six was seated at a table that we found quite small for us, but then the hostess seated a party of TWELVE at the table identical in size to ours directly next to our table, and my jaw dropped. One of the people in their party was standing for a good 15 minutes before a waiter brought over a chair for him to sit in.

It's quite loud, but IMO that adds to that pub-like ambiance. If it gets busy you'll get seated with a random group of people. Not very touristy either, most people there were locals..huge plus.\n\nFood/Drinks: They started us off with a butter/dill spread with bread...quite yummy. We ordered the baked chicken and the meatloaf. The baked chicken had an amazing sauce, and I wish they gave more of it! Super tender meat and great potato pancakes, good enough to split between 2 girls. Didn't try the meatloaf, but my friend thoroughly enjoyed it! They also had quite a great beer variety...and they'll serve you beer in a giant boot cup if you wish!!\n\nService: Definitely satisfactory . Even though it was busy, food came out relatively fast. \n\nOverall: For german food, they definitely have quite a variety aside from schnitzel that all sounded very appetizing...too bad my group didn't come on an empty stomach.

If so, this is the place for you! \n\nSuppenkuche is a great place to come with a crowd. For those who appreciate high-quality beer, you will not be disappointed. For those who could care less, you will still not be disappointed. They have a German Black Lager on tap, which is so hard to find and by far one of my favorite types of beer!\n\nI have been here a couple times, always for dinner. A favorite on the menu is the potato pancakes with apple sauce-- totally where it's at. The combination of the sweet with the crunchy and yet soft pancake is amazing. The cheese spatzle is like a German version of Mac n Cheese -- incredibly creamy and delicious. I wasn't particularly impressed with their pork filled ravioli, but their pork sausage and sauerkraut is great. \n\nHighly recommend Suppenkuche if you're looking for a hearty, fun-filled night :)\n\nNote: if you're coming in a small crowd, they have communal tables so you'll probably have a chance to get cozy with others at your table.", "author": "Kimya P."}

It may not be for everyone, but I thought it was fine and it lent the restaurant that authentic beer hall vibe. (Tip: Coming in a small group of 2 definitely helps cut down your wait time.) My friend and I split a plate of the potato pancakes. He ordered the spatzle as a main course and I ordered the braised beef which came with spatzle. I purposely ordered that dish because I wanted to try the spatzle (cheesy pasta) but as other Yelpers have alluded to, it really wasn't very good. I found it to be rubbery and pretty bland. I did try my friend's though and his was pretty good--definitely a lot cheesier and flavorful. I'm guessing they make the spatzle sides and the spatzle main course differently. The potato pancakes were nothing special--I found them to be just like thick hash browns.\n\nI will say that the braised beef was excellent though--tender, flavorful and went great with the tartness of the red cabbage and sweetness of the lingonberry sauce that accompanied it.

The beer selection is amazing and the atmosphere is downright jovial.  \n\nThis could be the PERFECT date spot depending on who you're here with. You'll most definitely be yelling across the table about how awesome the food is and how much you wish you were German while drinking a beer you can't recall the name of. However, it's not the best place to take a date that you have any interest in getting to know better because you won't be able to hear much through the busy chatter and laughter of other guests. Without a doubt, this is the best place to go with a group of friends. \n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: get here at 5PM or after 9PM to avoid the dinner rush. Booking a same-day reservation is almost impossible. \n\nMy only beef with this place has to do with the service staff. I understand that they have a tough job feeding the masses but it's not that easy for us to put up with this place either. We make a lot of sacrifices; like having to wait for a seat and subsequently for our food, sharing a table with random people, sitting on uncomfortable wooden seats, yelling across the table to have a conversation...etc. I'm just saying you could be a little more friendly...I'm talking about the bartender too. \n\nBut, the food makes all of this worth it.

We were sat within ten minutes and shared a table with a young group of college students. \n\nWe immediately ordered potato pancakes (rated 9/10 by the group--really a must have) and mixed salad (very german with beats, red cabbage, carrots, potato salad, butter lettuce, and green cabbage). \n\nFor entr\u00e9es, I ordered a delicious salmon with buttery mashed potatoes (an amazing 10/10). The fish literally melted in my mouth and it was a great pairing with the mashed potatoes. My mother ordered sauerbraten, which she gave an 8/10 because the sauce was \"very good\" but it didn't melt in her mouth as much as it should for such a tender meet. My brother's entr\u00e9 was the biggest disappointment, however. He ordered a weinerschnitzle, which was brought without sauce.  Both he and my mother commented on how it was too dry and was \"missing something.\" He added lemon and ate it that way. \n\nOverall I thought it was a great place with lots of character.

Best German restaurant ever!!\n\nThe wait can be really long (1 hour and a half to 2 hours). What you should do is, send a friend or 2 to put down their names, they can walk around in hayes valley, explore cute little boutiques, chill in the park with some grocery bought drinks, or even sit at the bar in the restaurant to pass time. We'd always go put our names down, get some drinks in a liquor store and walk around/play in the park. Time flies when you're in good company.\n\nIt's not a very big restaurant, if you go in a small group (3-7), they can put you with another party at the same table. So probably not the best place to go if you're shy and going on a first date. I've always made friends with the tables around us/chatted with people sitting at the same table. It's a fun crowd, the people who go there are usually out-going, loud, and really friendly. \n\nBoot beer!! You need to get one. It's fantastic. The whole restaurant will cheer you on to finish the boot. \nThe service is as good as it gets, it's very very busy, you kinda have to try hard to get someone's attention but they're doing their best, and you have beer on your table, so try to be patient and have a good time. I've always had waiters/waitresses that are on top of their stuff when I go.\n\nNow the food. Everything is good. \nReibekuchen mit hausgemachtem Apfelmus $11.00\nPotato Pancakes with Homemade Apple Sauce -- It's delicious. It's crispy and sweet. It's perfect as a desert in my opinion. \n\nMaultaschen in Pilzrahmso\u00dfe $11.50\nGerman Ravioli filled with Pork and Vegetables served with Mushroom Sauce -- How can you look at this and not want to get it? It's creamy and yummy. \n\nWiener Schnitzel vom Schwein mit Bratkartoffeln und Gr\u00fcnem Salat $18.00\nBreaded and Sauteed Porkloin with Roasted Potatoes & Green Salad -- It's bready, thin, but delicious. \n\nJ\u00e4gerschnitzel in Champignonso\u00dfe mit Sp\u00e4tzle und gr\u00fcnem Salat $18.50\nSauteed Porkloin in Mushroom Sauce served with Sp\u00e4tzle & Green Salad -- This is really really tender and the mushroom sauce is amazing. I wish I could buy it in a jar. \n\nKassler vom Grill mit Sauerkraut und Kartoffelbrei $16.50\nGrilled Cured Pork Chop with Sauerkraut & Mashed Potatoes -- Nice thick pork chop, they know how to cook their pork. \n\nGegrillte N\u00fcrnberger Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut und Kartoffelbrei $14.50\nGrilled Pork Sausage with Sauerkraut & Mashed Potatoes -- huge pork sausages, good for group sharing.\n\nFalscher Hase mit Zwiebelso\u00dfe und Kartoffelbrei $14.50\nMeatloaf with Bacon and Egg served with Onion Sauce & Mashed Potatoes -- Only the best meatloaf ever. \n\nMy advice is, get a few dishes to share amongst the group, because you will want to try everything.

My friends were already there, so I called them and told them to order for me.  I don't hang around Hayes Valley, but it seems like a cool area (nice bars and restaurants).  From outside of Suppenk\u00fcche, I could see that there are two dining room.  The smaller room in the back looked like it was reserved for larger parties (two big tables), while the room in front looked like it could sit about forty diners.  My friends said they waited a while for a table, so come early.  The dining room is casual, but stylish (very welcoming).\n\nThey ordered me a 7oz glass of German beer which was really good.  I'm not really a beer drinker anymore (preference - whiskey), but I really enjoyed it.  I quickly wanted another one, but they ran out and served me a Pilsner instead.  I was good, but I enjoyed the first one more.  While we were drinking, a bowl of Kartoffelsuppe (potato soup) arrived (with two spoons).  The two people who tried it (I was still enjoying my beer), said it was really great.  Chris, this dude from Germany, mentioned that Kartoffelsuppe is a time consuming thing to make and not an everyday food served in German homes.\n\nOur entrees arrived soon after.  I had Sauerbraten mit Lingonbeerkonfit\u00fcre, serviert mit Rotkohl und Sp\u00e4tzle (Marinated Braised Beef with Lingonberries, served with Red Cabbage & Sp\u00e4tzle).  It was pretty good!  The beef might have been brisket and was tender (but a little dry).  It tasted best when eaten with the Ligonberries and Spatzle (a egg noodle dish - similar to macaroni) all at the same time.  I didn't notice the red cabbage, until I finished the beef (they're both very similar in color).  It tasted like a mild sauerkraut.  Tona ordered Kassler vom Grill mit Sauerkraut und Kartoffelbrei (Grilled Cured Pork Chop with Sauerkraut & Mashed Potatoes).  I had a bite.  It was perfectly cooked (very tender and flavorful).  It was a good smoked pork chop (which basically tastes like ham - which I am not a huge fan of).  Everyone enjoyed their dinners and beer.\n\nWe would all visit Suppenk\u00fcche again.

Soft, but not overdone and still a bit of firmness to it. A little bit sweet.\n-- spaetzle: dense, but still somewhat light, and not too firm or too soft. light flavor.\n\nBill came to $37/head with tax and tip, about $150 before tax and tip, with a beer for each of us.

First off, the group seating was tons of fun and the wait staff are downright cheerful but that's not the best part about this small german restaurant, the reason it is truly a gem has to be their incredible german cuisine. Their pickled herring was out of this world and came with a large variety of vegetables. Their homemade warm pretzels with bavarian cheese were exquisite and matched perfectly with our imported beers. However, their crowning achievement was our entrees. For myself, cured grilled pork with warm sauerkraut and creamy mashed potatoes and for my husband, venison medallions, sp\u00e4tzle and traditional shredded, red cabbage. We laughed and ate till our bellies were achingly full. Unfortunately this left us with no room for dessert, so dissappointingly, we had to leave doggy bag in hand without sampling their apple strudel a la mode. 10/10 will eat again!", "author": "Natasha W."}

I had the Erdinger Dunkel Weizen myself and was most pleased =D  \n\nOn the downside, the place is a bit cramped and the wait was quite long - so come early or plan accordingly for the wait.

Of course you know coming to Suppenk\u00fcche that the beer is why many people check this place out.  They have a good selection but my only question is, why do they have such a limited amount of boots?  They really should offer the option to buy the boot as well, and keep more on hand.  But maybe it's a liability issue to have people then leaving their premises with these huge boots ha.\n\nWe tried a good amount of the entrees and while big portions and nice presentation, not the best food I've had.  The suckling pig didn't leave me craving more--it was slightly dry and I didn't notice any skin for the crispiness.  The wiener schnitzel was good, except it completely reminded me of Japanese tonkatsu lol...so the whole time I was eating it I craved some tonkatsu dipping sauce.  And this was after the potato pancakes reminded two of us at the table of McDonald's hash browns--no offense.

Our waitress was super knowledgeable and more than happy to offer recommendations. \n\nThis was actually my first foray into German food, but as a meat and potatoes kind of girl I was not disappointed. Everything was so hearty, tasty, and generously portioned. Embrace the food coma, because it will come. I got a special they have now, the suckling pig with sauerkraut. It tasted a bit like carnitas to me (but unchopped). DELICIOUS. I also tried some of the pork sausage (DELICIOUS) and the portobello mushrooms stuffed with feta and spinach (DELICIOUS). I was happy to see that they had such a yummy vegetarian option, because now I am dragging my veg roommates back here.\n\nThe decor and ambiance are really charming and rustic as well.

The pretzels were alright.\n\nI had the Jagerschnitzel, which was pounded pork with a mushroom sauce which was pretty good.

From Katia in NYC to Speisekammer in Alameda, when the suggestion to go here in SF came up, I jumped at it. We lucked out on parking and found a spot only a few blocks away on a Saturday night after 6pm, which is obviously rare. The place inside is small but very German beer hall, with communal tables in the front and back, and the bar on the right side as you walk in. We only waited a few minutes before we grabbed a few seats near the front of the door (be warned, when it's chilly outside, you'll feel the breeze every time the curtain gets thrown back for people coming or going near the entrance--bring a jacket). The appetizer plate had tremendous meats on it. More bread would have been clutch though. I almost regretted getting this due to its girth; I could have just had this as my meal and been set. But who goes to a German restaurant and doesn't try their other fine fare? The braised beef is always a go-to, and I wasn't disappointed. Really flavorful and the lingonberries were fresh. The spatzle wasn't really anything to write home about, but I ate it nonetheless. And of course you have to wash that all down with a cold one, and the Belgian triple (at a German place? I know, blasphemy) packed just the right amount of hops for me to consider this a successful venture into Deutschland.

They do give you a lot of food, but in this case quantity cannot make up for quality. I tried the Brat, and I tried a little bit of friends' Wiener Schnitzel and Pork Chop, and I'd say they were all pretty standard. I will say that even though I don't like Sauerkraut, theirs tasted authentic and I actually enjoyed it. If you are going strictly for beer, then it does have a great selection and of course, the boot! But I honestly feel that ratings here may be based off some cloudy judgement.\n\nService: 2/5 - Given that it is almost always crowded as hell, the service can be slow to come around, and they are very quick with you and not attentive after that. While it's totally understandable that they are just trying to get around to everyone and that it's busy, it's annoying when you can barely even flag someone down, let alone get them to stop by on their own.\n\nAmbiance: 2/5 - Our group had a table to ourselves since we had just enough people to squeeze everyone in. Yet, as usual there were masses of people just standing around and crowding the hell out of the place. We were against the wall, but even then it felt crowded with the groups standing on the other 3 sides of us. \n\nValue: 3/5 - It's pretty low cost here for most dinner items, but at the same time it's really simple food. You get a meat of some sort, and then a large amount of mashed potatoes and sauerkraut in most cases.

Despite the crazy Saturday night rush - people packed in the benches at each table, people packed around the bar, people packed in the small area behind the bar - my two friends and I managed to snag 3 seats at the bar, thus avoiding the hour and a half wait we were told to expect when we first checked in with the hostess.\n\nWe had a great view of the entire restaurant (not that it's a huge space) to really get into the atmosphere and even better, a great waiter/bar tender who was entertaining and attentive. I was skeptical when we first arrived because I am NOT a fan of crowds and/or feeling uncomfortable while I'm eating but it turned into a great evening and we stayed for a couple more beers than originally planned. Oh and the food was great. I will definitely go back here, maybe later on a weekend night (9:00 or 9:30 when the crowd seemed to clear out a bit) or during the week.", "author": "Sarah S."}

This time I had the Kolsch, the Konig Pilsener, and the Korbinian. The former were lighter beers, not too hoppy, and with a pleasant aftertaste. The Korbinian was a dark, malty beer that I definitely should not have had last, because I was about to explode and the heaviness did not help. But boy, was it delicious.\n\nThe four of us split a pickled herring appetizer, which was delightfully fishy. I got the meatloaf with the mashed potatoes, and it was everything I hoped it would be. By the end of the meal, I was about to explode from deliciousness, fullness, and drunkenness.\n\nI keep raving about the food and the beer, but the service is what brought this up to five stars. My boyfriend ordered a chicken dish (which I can no longer find on the menu) and we noticed that the table next to us had also put through an order, shortly after we did. Not only did they get their chicken before the bf did, but the server came out and told us that they ran out of chicken! However, she immediately apologized, acknowledging that the table next to us got the chicken before we did, despite putting the order in later, and promised to comp his order, as well as our next round of beer.\n\nIf there was a way to handle it, that was DEFINITELY it. We drank so much beer and ate so much food that the bill ended up pretty steep anyway, but the free entree and round of beers definitely helped. Well done, Suppenkuche. I would gladly give up my first choice entree in exchange for a round of beers and my second choice, free.", "author": "Angeline P."}

Word of advice: if you're going to go, show up for an early dinner. The good news is that if you have to wait, you can head over to the bar and have all the delicious beer that you want while passing the time.\n\nThe food was excellent. I can't offer an opinion on the meat dishes since I'm a vegetarian, but my boyfriend really enjoyed his n\u00fcrnberger bratwurst, and said the sauerkraut was the best he'd ever had. That's a pretty huge compliment coming from him, since he's half-German and grew up on German food. I had the k\u00e4sesp\u00e4tzle, and it was awesome. Totally hit the spot since I'd skipped lunch that day.\n\nThe only reason I gave this place a 3 instead of a 4 or 5 is that our waitress and guy that cleaned our plates off our table were making it very clear that they wanted us to leave as quickly as possible. I totally understand that they stop serving dinner at 10:00 and they were tired, but you should never make your customer feel like they're imposing, especially because this place isn't super cheap and I'm not super rich.\n\nWhen we happily told the waitress that we were surprised that they got the food out so fast, she responded with \"Yeah, well, end of the night--  we try to get everything out as soon as possible.\" Then when I was taking some bites of mashed potatoes from my boyfriend's plate, a guy came over and grabbed the plate so that I had to put the fork down and stop eating. I got a \"Sorry, I don't mean to interrupt,\" but seriously dude, I wanted those damn potatoes.\n\nThe worst part was that it's not like we were the last people there, and we didn't lollygag through our meal. The place was still packed, and there were plenty of tables of people that were sitting there taking their sweet time to finish their beers before leaving (as they should). \n\nSo long story short, awesome beer, tasty food, but the wait staff should stop treating customers like obstacles to their shift ending.", "author": "Beth K."}

I need another sip.\" *sip* \"Forget the food, I know what beer I'm ordering!\"\nReal life: I'll have one of these! *Points to pint in hand* (again, I don't bother with the German, it's not like anyone will understand me anyway)\n\nMaybe it's the German side coming out in me (oh yes, I have a streak of German in me, it's true), but I didn't even have a need for water at dinner. Haha, maybe I shouldn't be admitting this, but my Schwarzbier was a wonderful accompaniment to the tasty and very salty German treats that comprised my dinner.\n\nBeer enthusiasts, I highly recommend this place for you! \n\nNote: Street parking is horrible on any night, so give yourself extra time. If you're heading to the Opera House after dinner for a show, and don't mind paying, I suggest parking in the $10 lot across the street from the Performing Arts Garage (on the corner of Gough and Grove).", "author": "Claire L."}

The Schnitzel was  perfectly breaded, juicy, and tender. The potatoes had a surprise! element of bacon mixed in to it and the cabbage was a nice touch of greens within the pork apocalypse . I envied the mammoth that was the pork knuckle, but i sadly had trouble convincing myself to try it after the waitress had to describe it as the  \"the cute little piggy's hoof.\" By then i connected the hoof to the animal, and the animal to a pig, and the pig to a cute smiling little face. Maybe next time cause it looked like yum all over the place.\n\nLast but not least, the beer! Great selection, even i was bombarded with an array of unfamiliar juices.

We came here on a Saturday night after the truly awful Oktoberfest at Pier 48.  Suppenkuche was just absolutely packed to the gills.  We came with 9 people and were seated within 30 minutes.  The service and ambiance was superb as always.  The star of the show is the food!  German cuisine is not the most celebrated or sophisticated, but those of us who grew-up with it appreciate it and crave it.  Truly good German restaurants are hard to find.  Schroeder's in the FiDi tries and is a good place for a beer, but the food lacks and it has become just ridiculously expensive since the big renovation.  Suppenkuche nails it.

I believe you can order up to 5 liters of beer in one glass if that's what you fancy.\n\nWarning: there's always a wait time. But who cares?

My personal suggestion is to order the potato pancakes with apple sauce as an appetizer (comes with 3 large cakes and a bowl of sauce), and split the wiener-schnitzel for dinner (comes with 2 large schnitzels and a side of dressed lettuce and potatoes).

Due to the noise and perhaps the famous beer served in a boot, raised voices are the norm.  I don't personally find that noise level relaxing though it may be authentic.  The quarters are very cramped and uncomfortable.  There are two rooms and we were seated in the one with dried flower bunches and wreathes.  I liked the wood floors and tables but everything else was uncomfortable.  The food is what you would expect - hearty.  Surprisingly, they also have a few vegetarian options.\n\nFor dinner they serve their standard menu and they have a page of daily specials.  During our visit the specials included an organic chicken schnitzel, salmon with a thick slab of truffle butter, roast suckling pig and braised lamb shanks.  The entrees come on large oval plates, average $16 and should satisfy even large appetites.  \n\nI chose the German ravioli ($13) which consisted of three large, misshapen sized dumplings in a creamy mushroom sauce.  The dumpling skins were thick and chewy - obviously homemade.  The delicious mushroom sauce was infused with deep mushroom flavor.  Each dumpling had a light dusting of toasted breadcrumbs and parsley.  I wasn't too fond of the pork & vegetable filling because the filling was so dense and not at all juicy.  \n\nThe service was okay.  They never refilled our water glasses and I don't think they brought more bread either. \n\nReservations are suggested but only accepted for parties of 6 or larger.

Everyone in the restaurant was just fine except the most important person involved in our meal -- our server.\n\nThe GINGER HAIRED GUY who is a SERVER there right now (Sept 30, 2010) is NOT a good server.\n\nI have been a server off and on for over 15 years and he did thing after thing that are big no-nos and just make you unhappy that you came at all.\n\nI have eaten here many times and have never had a difficulty being served a plate that they create made up of little bits of the veggie sides because I am a vegan and they have no vegan option on the menu.  They make up a reasonable price for this veggie plate each time I've come -- usually around 10 bucks.  \n\nNot so last night.  The ginger haired server was not accommodating or interested in this - a bit of a bummer, especially as another in our party of 4 is a vegan as well...... and came from out of town and was told all about this restaurant and how great it is.  So that's one thing.\n\nHe also seemed exasperated from the get go --- as he was taking our drink order and facing us for the first time!  When you're just so exasperated with everything around you in your world and you push that exasperation onto people you've never even encountered before --  that doesn't sit well with patrons.  It made me feel uneasy.  Had he been on a first date and done this sort of thing the person he was with would have gotten up and never looked back.\n\nWhen he served our plates he sort of tossed them down heavily and clumsily and sort of side-armed and not in any order or to the plate's eater.  That makes me feel unimportant and almost like he was the evil headmaster at the orphanage and we were the loathed children getting our gruel.  I shouldn't be feeling this feeling when I go out to eat - part of what I'm paying for is the service.  If I didn't want service, I could just make good German food at home.\n\nHe never checked on our table after he dropped our food off.  Not once.  \n\nWe actually needed a couple things during the meal -- for instance, drinks.  He just never came back and seemed not to notice any gestures from our table.\n\nHastily came with check though.\n\nActually scoffed and eye-rolled toward me in some sort of commiserative look when the father-figure of our group placed down a credit card that I guess was not accepted at Suppenkuche. \n\nAgain side-arm reached for the checkbook once an accepted card was placed AND with a hand that already held another table's just retrieved checkbook in it - stacking them up poker chips style - doesn't make you feel like a special patron, just like a representation of money for him.  Not a cool vibe, disrespectful.\n\nAlso, sighed when we needed a to-go box.\n\nWe were a quiet unobtrusive low maintenance table but he made us feel like he was serving a group of 4 Fran Dreschers when he did interact with us. \n\nI get that Suppenkuche is busy and servers might be stressed but I've worked in busier restaurants with crazy stuff going on behind the scenes and I've never treated patrons like this.  This just seemed a case of server having no restaurant etiquette OR maybe he's just naturally a brute in general.  Why would a restaurant hire such a person when there are so many people out of work in this city who have excellent restaurant skills?  Me included in this group.\n\nBummed.", "author": "Dizzy L."}

Although it was busy, it wasn't slammed. There was no excuse for the bad service, which was disappointing, as I had looked forward to trying this place for years.\n\nIt took 20 minutes to take our order, and we had to flag them down and practically beg our waitress to take it. It took about 45 minutes to get water.  Our bread arrived without bread plates, but we did manage to use napkins as plates. My iced tea didn't arrive with a spoon. \n\nOur food was cold when it finally arrived. It had good flavors, but it was cold. The thing is, while we were waiting, I could hear the kitchen bell dinging repeatedly (for pick up) and NONE of the waitresses even looked in the direction or made a move to pick up the food.  I'm guessing we were not the only patrons who received cold food.\n\nThe only remotely prompt service we received was when we asked for the check and even then, the check was incorrect and charged us for an extra entree (20 minutes after we had ordered, our waitress came by to let us know that they were out of one of our entrees).  At least the woman who I asked to fix our bill did that promptly. \n\nPity. The best thing about this place was the beer.", "author": "Audrey H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-13", "description": "Fantastic German food! This is as good as the real deal in Deutschland if not better! I've been to Germany more times than I can count and I became accustomed to their many traditional dishes. Suppenk\u00fcche's dishes are some of the best examples of my favorites...\n\nOk, before we get to the food, can I just get one thing off my chest here?\n\nOne MAJOR pet peeve of this place is the willingness to perpetuate an often overlooked American faux pa...the tragedy that is DAS BOOT. Hey, people, remember that German Film called Das Boot? Guess where it took place? In a BOAT!!! (Ok a Submarine, but you catch my drift.) Not a BOOT! Boot in German? = Der Stiefel. I know it's much more scary and foreign sounding than das Boot, but it's accurate...So even if you can't pronounce it right, it's much less ignorant & embarrassing sounding than drunk Americans getting schnamered while chanting \"THE BOAT! THE BOAT!\"  meanwhile drinking out of a glass boot. And we wonder why people see us the way they do in other countries?  \n\nWhat's more...couldn't the waitstaff at least be taught a word or two of German? Seeing as it IS a fully German place? I mean, for the respect of the country and it's culture and language? \n\nSorry, that's my rant...\n\nThe FOOD:\nHopefully I didn't completely lose you all there. It would do a strict injustice to the glory that is the 100% Authentic German cuisine at the Suppenk\u00fcche. I ordered the Holiday Duck. The duck was so succulent, so juicy that I was beside myself in bliss. It is SO rare for a duck to be cooked this perfectly, with no gamey flavor either, that I made sure to savor every last delicious bite! On the side was Kartoffel Kn\u00f6del which is basically a large potato dumpling. I find that sauces is really where German cuisine stands out and this dish was no exception. The Kn\u00f6del was so wonderful and fluffy. It has a gelatinous texture, I know, not appealing sounding, but trust me on this! It's like nothing you've had before and is one thing that I truly miss after not being in Germany for a while. \n\nThe DRINK:\nOf course, they have a nice selection of German beers to chose from to put in your...\"boat\" ;-) ...my favorite is Augustiner Helles, but it all depends on my mood...sometimes I prefer Weissbier...In which case, I chose Paulaner most times. You basically can't go wrong. Beer is what Germans do best. \n\nSo I knicked the one star for not only the Das Boot silliness, but the fact that they didn't have Apfelstrudel left by the time I ordered it. I know, pretty petty to hold that against them, but I really had my heart set on it. And If you're such a popular restaurant that has people waiting for 2 hours to get seated, couldn't you at least make sure you have enough food to feed their hungry bellies?! \n\nAll in all, wonderful dishes. Great Atmosphere. Just STOP IT with the Das Boot garbage already!!! It's embarrassing.", "author": "Kristin G."}

My anxieties were vindicated when I arrived and 4 people were in line in front of me. Turns out, there was no need to worry. We were the only tables in there for about 30 minutes. \n\nHere's what my table ordered:\n\n-Potato pancakes: CRACK. Like the best hash browns you've ever had. They were soft and fluffy on the inside and crunchy and golden on the outside. Served with applesauce. I don't even like apples and I doused mine in this sauce. There were 3 potato pancakes for a party of 4. The last one was eyed politely by each of us and we ended up splitting it 4 ways.\n\n-Roasted Pork Sausages scrambled with Eggs, Potatoes & Bacon served with a Cucumber Salad: Underwhelming. M least favorite dish. The scramble was just ok and the cucumber salad was underseasoned and soggy. \n\n-Grilled Pork Sausage with Sauerkraut & Mashed Potatoes: such a spot-on combination. The salty, savory, juicy meat + slightly sweet sauerkraut + velvety and creamy mashed potatoes. A definite re-order.\n\n-20cm sausages: I can't remember what these were served with but the actual sausages appeared like really slim hot dog franks, but tastier.\n\n-Pork sausages in a tomato-curry sauce served with french fries: the surprise hit of the meal. I was suspect about the tomato-curry combination but the pairing of the slightly sweet tomato and subtle curry sauce was fantastic. The saltiness/crispiness of the french fries were a perfect compliment to the juicy meat in the sauce.\n\nI'm a meat and potatoes kind of girl. And I like sausage. (that's what she said).

The place was packed to the brim, with every seat taken at the communal tables and the bar was 2 deep. Sundays at local restaurants in Dallas certainly don't look like this!\n\nI started with the Kristall Hefeweisen which arrived in tall draft form in a cool shaped glass. I found it to be crisp and really light, making it easy to drink and not super filling.\n\nWe started with the potato cakes with apple sauce and fried cambert. I didn't try the cheese, but I did love the sauce that went on the potato cakes! My trout entree was quite delicious and came in a huge potion, with the fish head still on the plate. The mashed potatoes were extra creamy, and when I mixed a bite of spinach, trout and taters it was the perfect combo.\n\nThe waitstaff is phenomenal here. Very personable, welcoming and attentive.

Yes, it is loud (and proud of it) and parking is a pain in the butt, well actually so are the lines and the regular throngs of fans that throw themselves here on every given night.  However, if you get yourself a seat at the bar in the back and don't mind being immobile for an hour or so and/or work up an appetite at 4:45 pm - you should be good.  The service is very friendly for being fast however I wouldn't go in expecting them to pull out all the stops.  I'm surprised at how good they keep track of you (and your water) for a place that is always so crowded.  \n\nNow to the food and drink - their portions are really kind and the food way past par.  Their venison is yum and so are their porkchops.  And of course if you have a hankering for some sausage and mashed potatoes - this is definitely the place to do it.  I've also had their trout, which isn't by any means authentic or anything but yummy nonetheless.\n\nIn short, just come here already and try it out.

Although I really wasn't sure if I would like it, they had beer, so I figured that I'd give it a shot.  \n\nWhen we sat down at our table, which has bench style seats that you share with other patrons, we were given the very expansive beer menu.  The menu is a little intimidating since they have so many choices of German beers that you have never heard of before.  I usually like to play it pretty safe (my favorite beer is Blue Moon), and I don't usually like really full bodied beers like Ale's etc.  I was pleasantly surprised that the waitress was able pinpoint my taste and recommend several beers which were right up my alley.  I tried two, and they were both fantastic, even possibly the best beers I have ever tried.  You can also get beer in really really big glasses, like the Das Boot!\n\nNext we started to go through the menu, which is all in German (with translated English below).  At this point I started to get even more scared.  They have things on the menu that I have never tried before (like blood sausage and goose), and everything is in German.  Luckily I'm the kinda girl that will try just about anything.  We also decided that we would try to order our meals in the authentic German names to make the experience more fun.\n\nWhen the food arrived, we realized we had nothing to fear, as everything was delicious.  We got the potato pancakes (with apple sauce) as an appetizer, which are the best I've ever had.  For my entr\u00e9e I got the lamb chops which were also amazing.  They came with yummy mashed potatoes too   Everyone else was very happy with the food as well.\n\nSince my first visit, I have gone to Suppenkuche several other times, and even once for brunch (also fantastic).  I always have fun here, and the food and beer are unmatched.  The only thing you have to look out for are the long waits.  There is generally at least an hour wait (I guess people know what's up).  Although you can make a reservation, you can only reserve for 6 people at either 6 or 8 o'clock.  You gotta try this place though.  There's nowhere else like it, and you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Liz L."}

Since it was Oktoberfest the menu was VERY limited.  I got the brautweirst that came with mashed potatoes and saurkraut.  It was pretty good, the kraut was supringsly flavorful and tender but the brauts were just ok and the mashed potatoes were pretty good but plain.  But it was $13.50 for 3 brauts, mashed potatoes and saurkraut.  Too expensive for what it was really and pretty good food.  I got wine, and it wasn't cheap for $8 a glass - a well balanced riesling though.\n\nService was good but not great.

Suppenk\u00fcche is as good as it gets, especially since the food is anything but a time capsule of culinary childhood reminiscences.\n\nTrue to hearty Teutonic traditions, the menu offers a good range of German fare such as Bratwurst with Sauerkraut, Wiener Schnitzel, the already mentioned Sauerbraten, and various seasonal offerings such as venison and roast goose (around Christmas time). But the chef puts a vibrant spin on these dishes that extend their appeal far beyond the nostalgic, making Suppenk\u00fcche a favorite destination for simply great food and not simply German food. All of this is, naturally, accompanied by a tasty selection of beers (I very much recommend the eclectic Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen).\n\nThe place has only a few drawbacks: (1) it fills up rapidly even on week nights, so arrive ahead of opening times, (2) the acoustics are horrible, expect to shout your conversations even at the closest table mates, and (3), options for your vegetarian friends are extremely limited and, in my estimation, a mere afterthought.

Don't get me wrong, the food is tasty and arrives to your table quickly.  But, as others have noted the place is lively, loud, and warm.  \n\nI came here with a date and joked about the communal tables as they generally aren't my thing (as I am an aloof, snobbish East Coaster still living with the remnants of a Valley Girl accent) but this place is all about conviviality.  That doesn't necessarily mean you're going to bond or even have a conversation with your dining table (one lady at our table studiously ignored the rest of the table and only made eye contact with her date) but you will soak up the atmosphere.  \n\nYou kinda have to be in a social (or more social than usual) mood to eat here, though I did see one brave soul who apparently REALLY wanted German food sitting alone at the end of a communal table with her head down reading a magazine the entire evening the party at the end of the table laughed it up.  Other solo eaters were at the bar happily bumping elbows with other spaetzle lovers.  I've never been to Germany but the atmosphere did remind me a bit of bars during the weekends in Spain.  It's super crowded but everyone is there to be in a good mood.\n\nThis is an *excellent* place to bring a date if you're being sneaky and want an excuse to sit up real close to your date and whisper mundane nothings into their ear.  I noticed most of the couples were seated corner to corner, I guess to facilitate hushed conversations amongst the mood-lit din.\n\nThe bar is a tiny, crowded island in the corner of the restaurant.  I was initially taken aback by the cluster of people radiating around the small bar but since most at the bar are waiting for tables then leaving we found a space pretty quickly.  I ordered the Bananweizen, the banana juice really did cut the bitterness of the Hefeweizen.  I'm not really a beer person either, I know, what the heck was I doing at a German restaurant in October?  Eating shnitzel, that's what! \n\nFor the food, I can't comment on its authenticity.  It wasn't as heavy as I expected but it was good comfort food.  One of the guys at my table was German American and commented on how many times he eats there a month. \n\nI'd go back again.

The bartenders are extremely knowledgeable about their German brews (no surprise) and if it's not too busy at the bar and you're not sure what to order, they'll ask what you like, offer a suggestion and then give you a little try first.  Sweet!\n\nIt's a great place to come with a group of hungry and thirsty friends.  Especially during Oktoberfest when they bring in a bunch of seasonal Festbeers on draft. \n\nThe only miss on this place is that the bar area is not really somewhere you go to hang but rather a stopping point as you wait for your table.  Too bad because on its own, it's a great place to chill with a half liter of hefeweisen or marzen for $6!", "author": "F. P."}

If the owners considered getting buzzers for their patrons to hold instead of them having to \"check in\" on their status, that would be a huge plus. The food is amazing and justifies the price of your meal. You will not leave hungry and will be saddened that you left so full you couldn't eat their dessert. Just a heads up... If you are going to this establishment with the intention of having intimate conversation, forget it! The atmosphere is loud and you will be seated at a communal table but that is what aids in providing you with a true German dining experience. The beers that are offered are awesome as we'll.

The menu was limited because it was special just for the occasion. Next time, I'm definitely trying the potato pancakes that everyone raves about.\n\nTIP 1\n- Grab a seat-- fast!  Seating is first come first serve, so be sure to scout out the area, let one of the wait staff know you're keeping your eye out for a table (in case they can help you) and grab the first available seats.  The sitting arrangement is a long row of a wooden tables and connected benches, so be prepared to get cozy and comfy with strangers.\n\nTIP 2\n- Get beer!  How could you not?  :)  The beer here is imported and delicious.  I'd recommend getting a huge thing of beer so you can enjoy it with your food.\n\nTIP 3\n- The food is awesome.  I'd say you'll pay ~$15-20 per entree.  My bf and I ordered a chicken dish and strips of pork tenderloin or steak ( I don't remember, but I know it was red meat ).  Both were so good and marinated in some kind of sauce that made everything moist and delicious.  I see a lot of people just order sausages too.  \n\nTIP 4\n- They have something on the menu that's a giant pretzel that comes with tasty mustard dipping sauce.  I'd recommend trying it out, but the pretzel is GIGANTIC and there's really only so much bread and mustard sauce one can eat.  Interestingly, I saw a ton of people sharing their pretzel bread with strangers because so many people wanted to order it but were intimated by its size.  So my suggestion is to ask for a sample of it from your friend (or whoever) or get one to share.  Some people ordered it as their entree (since it's the price of an entree (~$15?), but I'd suggest eating it as a side dish.", "author": "Sunny S."}

Suppenkuche is right on the corner is Laguna and Hayes and there's a door that opens and you're greeted with a large, heavy curtain. What? I open it up, and there are tables right there! i quickly turn away thinking I went in through the back entrance! Luckily I just spotted a coworker and followed him in the same way and was soon after greeted by a hostess (with a cool German accent!). \n\nThe spread for the night included:\nAppetizers:\n* Potato pancakes w/ apple sauce\n* giant pretzel w/cheese and beer mixture\n\nEntrees:\n* Cheese Spatzle\n* Jagerschnietzel\n* Wienerschnietzel\n* German Meatballs\n* Wild Boar Sausages\n* Braised Beef\n* Organic Chicken\n\nOther:\n* Das Boot (2L)\n\nEverything was just amazing! The waiter suggested we get the giant pretzel wince there were 9 of us, but now in retrospect, we could've done with the pretzel. Maybe then we could have finished more of our entrees. The potato pancakes are a must-get! They are deliciously crispy with the starchy taste of potato, not oil. \n\nThe entrees were all really good. I ordered the jagerschnietzel and finished almost all of it - although my stomach did hurt after a while. Other entrees I definitely liked was the cheese spatzle (tasted like creamy mac and cheese), the wild boar sausages (interestingly enough, not gamey at all), and the wienerschnietzel (can never go wrong with anything fried!). \n\nBecause we were all so full, we only got the 2L das boot - the the enormous 5L bucket. \n\nThis place is a great place for large groups and for friends to catch up.

So let me attest to the authenticity of Suppenk\u00fcche - this place is legit.\n\nFirst thing you'll notice is that seating is more often than not at large tables, and you may be seated next to total strangers.  In Germany, it is okay to take the empty seats at a partially occupied table if you ask permission from the people already sitting there.  So, wilkommen in Deutschland.\n\nThe food is great, and the beer selection is solid.  J\u00e4gerschnitzel is my personal favourite dish, but the Reh (venison) is also delicious.  As for beer - they are all fine specimens of their respective arts, so just choose a type of beer that you like and order it.  They do offer beer in a boot, but unless you know the trick to drinking them, I advise just to drink from a normal glass.  Your beer stays colder that way too ;)\n\nMinus one star for the prices though!  It really shouldn't be so expensive to throw a combination of potatoes/sauerkraut/pork/mushrooms on a plate, and maybe coat one or more of those items with flour.  Of course, price will also depend on how much beer you drink.

They totally make up for it with the quantity of food they slap on your plate, plus, the staff were super nice.\n\nRoasted Pork Sausages scrambled with Eggs, Potatoes and Bacon served with a Cucumber Salad: This was pretty ordinary, but then again I'm not a big fan of sausage. \n\nSpecial Omelette: Also quite ordinary, a vegetable omelette. Not really sure what I was expecting. Meh. The next few dishes is where they completely redeemed themselves.\n\nEmperor's Pancake with Brandied Raisins, served with Apple and Plum Compote: I was surprised that I liked the combination of fruit sauces with my pancakes. Typically I don't like putting sauces or syrup on pancakes because they get soggy, and I was disappointed that the pancakes were swedish-style. But the tart apple compote complemented the nutella pancakes perfectly, and they didn't get soggy.

They'll even let you taste little samples to make sure it's what you want.\n\nThe Food: BF and I are vegetarians and have eaten here once. We both suffered from acute cheese overload and I felt ill. I didn't feel ill because anything was wrong with the food...it's was just too much cheese/dairy. BF and I had the soup du jour: cream of asparagus, some sort of cheese ball appetizer that was the special that night (literally balls of fried cheese), a small side of cucumber salad and we shared the Spaetzle entree - which was huge). Don't get me wrong, it tasted good...it was just so rich. And to top it off with the amount of beer that we drank, we both rolled out of there afterwards.

My sister and I ended up grabbing dinner here last night after winning the lottery to see Wicked.  We arrived around 6:30 and were seated immediately.  I've had German food only 1 other time in my life, so I let my sister do the ordering - she was President of the German club in HS and had the pleasure of visiting Germany a few years back.\n\nThe complimentary bread was blah.  It was hard, dry, and sour.  My sister said that's how it is, so I guess I don't like German bread.  The herbed butter though, was quite  yummy!   \n\nJagerschnitzel - I enjoyed this dish very much.  The pork chops were thin and moist, and the batter was just perfect.  The mushroom sauce was creamy and full of flavor - it went well with the chop and the spatzle.  It also came with a side of salad (butter lettuce) with a vinaigrette sauce.  I cleared everything on my plate and was completely stuffed!\n\nMarinated and Braised Beef with Lingonberries - This was my sister's dish.  It had a very unique flavor and was very different from any other dish I've had.  The beef was really tender and the sauce was quite vinegary.  It came with a small side of cranberry sauce which is supposed to help balance the strong flavor.  I don't care for red cabbage so I can't fairly review that.  \n\nBoth dishes were excellent which I would highly recommend!  The family we shared a table with had the potato pancakes which looked delicious.  I seriously was going to grab one from them since their son wasn't eating any of it.  They also had the ravioli with mushroom sauce that also looked really good.  \n\nMy sister and I also shared a glass of beer.  I think we had the dunkel weiss w/ lemon soda.  It was nice and light, just enough to give my sis a good buzz.  ;D  \n\nOur meal came out to about $50.00 and the service was super fast.

The food is decent, with no major mistakes made but, I feel it is the atmosphere and novelty of ordering several liters of beer at once that draws most people. \n\nFood wise I always judge a German restaurant on its schnitzel recipe.  If they can't get this staple right, it's a telling sign of the rest of the menu.  Their particular recipe when I went smothered it in a delicious but overwhelming mushroom sauce.  Which in all honesty, I feel it is used to mask an inferior schnitzel.  Schnitzel should be able to stand alone (with the exception of a wedge of lemon) in it's greatness by having the perfect balance of seasoning, perfect amber golden color, and have a crispness you can cut with a fork.  This schnitzel wasn't even close.  But I will admit the seasoning of the sauce did a decent job of making up for it.  The entree came with a delicious and buttery side of spaetzle that in all honesty, out performed the schnitzel.  The spaetzle was cooked perfectly and seasoned just right.  The side salad of butter lettuce was good but not cut into small enough pieces.\n\nI also tried a bit of the suckling pig, with kraut and dumpling.  The pork was good, not great.  But the kraut was a major winner with that entree.  Seems to follow the same trend as my schnitzel.   \n\nIn all, I would definitely recommend this place to people looking for a fun night out and decent food.  Although the popularity of this place can definitely detract from making it a normal pit stop as well as the prices.  At almost $20+ dollars an entree, serious consideration should be made regarding value of meal vs. quality.  Our group of 5 spent almost $500.  Granted much of that expense was beer but imagine spending that much at any finer restaurant in the mission and it would not doubt be a incredible meal.

That being said, I would gladly wait for a table at Suppenk\u00fcche. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 had the potato pancakes, and they were perfection. Beautifully crispy outside, tender moist inside, and not greasy at all. \n\nI had the veal and pork sausages in a butter broth. They were very fresh, wonderfully spiced and yet mild. Quite similar to a British banger  but with a more mellow flavor. \n\nIf you are a Riesling fan like me, the wine menu will make you incredibly happy. \n\nMy friend had the sweet/savory pancake combination, and I only had one bite, but that one bite was a blissful explosion of tender cake, sweet-tart preserves, and savory egg. I don't know how he ate over half his plate. \n\nThe atmosphere is very like a tavern or pub - some of the tables are communal, and the minimalist decoration allows the sound to bounce all around off the walls and floor. Noisy, cozy, and cheerful. \n\nI especially liked the plain wooden tables and lack of formal place settings, which allowed the food to stand front and center. \n\nSide note -- the gentleman who sat us, either the owner or main manager, was a sweet, friendly man who acted as though we were visiting his home.

As always, with all the restaurants that have an extreme high number of reviews, there is a long wait.  If you want reservations for a Saturday night, you have to call them a month in advance, according to the hostess.  We put our names down at 6:30, we were seated at 8.  They do not call you if you're not available when the table is ready for you.  We had to share a table with two other people, that always makes it a lil more interesting.  \n\nThe d\u00e9cor makes you feel like you're in Germany, and somehow everyone around you looks German at this restaurant.

If you're waiting for an hour, and if Suppenk\u00fcche will probably be a once in a year/lifetime experience, do not miss out on the boot.   The buzz is so worth it, it makes the food taste even more delicious.  It's $28 if you don't break the boot, $50 if you do.  \n\nThe food - We got Gemischter Salat (salad), Reibekuchen mit hausgemachtem Apfelmus (Potato Pancakes with Homemade Apple Sauce), and this special - it was stuffed chicken, I can't put the name down here since it's not on the online menu.

I ended up adding the applesauce from the cakes to the pork to add moisture and make it more palatable. The salad that came with it had a sweet & sour dressing that was light and not overpowering.

We went out of town for her birthday, and decided on SF. One reason was that the only German food to be sought in our area is Der Weinerschnitzel. We looked on Yelp! for such a place, yet none was to be found. According to the reviews I saw on here, Suppenkuche had an exceptional reputation. And did it deliver! This place was amazing! The food was fantastic. The ambiance was communal. The place was packed to the hilt, but service was quick and responsive. I felt as if I was in a Germany itself, particularly in the Bavarian provinces. The wooden beams were an awesome touch, along with the wooden tables. Suppenkuche was very rustic and had the natural feel of being in an actual Biergarten. \n\nThe options for drinks were plentiful. My mom had the Riesling spatslese, a very sweet white wine. \n\nWe first had the dumpling appetizer in a mushroom sauce. The appetizer hit the spot, especially since it was getting chilly outside. The food was phenomenal. I had the Jaegerschnitezel; I found it to be perfectly cooked with the side of spatzel noodles. The schnitzel was delicious.  Not only did the food actually look tasty, I consumed it with a happy zeal! \n\nMy mom had wild boar sausages with spatzel noodles. The sausages were savory. There two on the plate and served in a mushroom sauce. Complimentary to the sausages and spatzel was the sauerkraut. Prior to that evening meal, my mom's opinion on sauerkraut was pretty low. After eating her meal, she now loves it. There were small chunks of ham in there as well. My mom's last words are: wonderful, tasty, delicious, big portions, and AUTHENTIC. \n\nThe dessert was exceptional! My mom and I shared the apple strudel with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. The strudel was laying in a pool of vanilla ice cream on the side. It was flakey warm and it gave you a sigh of contentment. \n\nThe only downside of this little place was parking. Like anywhere else in San Francisco, desired parking is lacking. We parked about 2.5 blocks away. So if you have plans to go to this establishment, give yourself plenty of time to get parking.  \n\nAs far as prices go for the food, Suppenkuche's entrees are in the mid range. Our meals were little less than $20/person. So keep that in mind.\n\nI would reccomend this little restaurant to anyone who has a yearning for AUTHENTIC German/Bavarian style food. I am glad to have read the reviews on here and am hopeful people will read this and have the same type of experience. Also be prepared to share a table with someone, we did and it was a good experience. It's loud, but an enjoyable place to feast on amazing food", "author": "Adrienne T."}

I'm not quite sure what to write that hasn't already been said. Definitely get here an hour before expecting to eat. The place is pretty small but if you find a spot at the bar, you will be set. Half of the bar allows for sitting while the other half is a free for all, stand wherever there is room.  We got here around 5:20 (place opens at 5).  There was already a 45 min wait!  I couldn't believe it.  Good thing we arrived early.  We started at the bar with a couple of beers and the potato pancakes.  The pancakes were super crispy. The apple sauce provided a great sweet flavor.  It's not like your typical apple sauce but maybe that's because it was lightly chilled.  The consistency was a little watery but it did not lack in taste.  I would probably start out with a pretzel next time so that you have a bit more sitting in your stomach while you are waiting.\n\nIf you want to make a reservation, make sure you have a large party.  Otherwise, no go.  I really wanted Das Boot but with such a great beer selection, I couldn't settle on one.  \n\nFor dinner, we got the Wiener Schnitzel and grilled pork and bratwurst (I believe it was on their special menu).  OMG I could eat this every day!  Everything was tasty and delicious.  The gravy on the grilled pork and dumpling was the best gravy I've had.  I could drink it.  They also provide a small plate of lettuce that looked really plain.  However, the dressing made this \"salad\" delicious.  I love the sour dressing they used.  We also got a side of the spatzle (German noodles) since I had to try it.  Of course I drenched the spatzle in the gravy and it was mind blowing.  I really wish I had room for dessert.  Next time Suppenkuche!  :)", "author": "Ken W."}

An impulse trip on a Sunday night turned out to be the best decision.  Our party of 4 was seated immediately at a communal table (this isn't everyone's cup of tequilla, I know, but the couple at our table was fun...and didnt get mad at me when I drooled over their dessert with lust in my eyes).  I think the crowd was more subdued on a rainy Sunday evening, but trust me the place was jammin' enough.  \n\nNow, I went  to Munich last summer (yeah  yeah, I know...how many people have stated this in the other 1,327 reviews of this place??)  and I have a little bit of a hard time with German cuisine.  I don't eat pork and Germans love their swine so my options are always limited.  I can hang though.  I went with the braised beef dish.  My fellow diners ordered the lamb chops, meatloaf with bacon, and the trout.\n\nThe beer selection is phenomenal.  They carry my two favorite Hefeweizens in the world:  Franziskaner and Erdinger.  I enjoyed a vase of each (yes, the smallest beer size here is \"vase\").  \n\nThis is hearty food that will really stick to your bones.  My braised beef was superb.  The dish has a sweet and sour flare with red cabbage accompaniments.  The sp\u00e4tzle (German egg noodle) that came on the side was the best I've had this side of the Atlantic.  The waiter delivered my friend's trout and as he set it down he said, \"You know, this looks over-cooked to me.  If you want to send this back, please let me know.\"  The trout was pretty charred, so he took the waiter up on his offer.  The next trout came back perfectly cooked.  As a former waitress, I really appreciate that sort of service.  \n\nThe atmosphere of this place is pretty rad too.  In comparison to Schroeders which is darker and more traditional, Suppenk\u00fcche is a more modern, hip scene that still remains loyal its roots.  Imagine a beer hall decorated by Anthropologie.\n\nCome to Suppenk\u00fcche hungry and thirsty and you will roll out of here sehr gl\u00fccklich!!!", "author": "Kerry D."}

We found this place on yelp and were forwarned about the cramped spaces, close dining quarters, loud atmosphere and large beer selection.\nwe walked into the restaurant through the curtains that made us think we entered through the back of the restaurant, but we were approached by a nice hostess that will wrote our name down. In the mean time, we waited by the bar with a nice cold beer. The beer selection was quite large, but the bartender was nice enough to give us a sample before we ordered. My friends got the pumpkin Lambic which was on special and I got the raspberry (pumpkin was a little too sour for my taste). About 15 minutes later we were seated at a large table and were sitting directly across from another party. A little awkward in our case since it seemed like the people across from us weren't up to socializing with strangers. the menu is in German with English written under so we had no issues with understanding. We got an appetizer, main dish and dessert to share. All of which came out pretty quickly.\n\nWhat we tried:\nGerman Ravioli in Mushroom Sauce: The raviolis were stuffed with some kind of meat that I can't remember, but it was very tasty. the raviolis were obviously handmade because each of them looked different. There was a scrumptious mushroom sauce that tasted typical but was good nonetheless. \n\nPork Sausage with Mashed Potatoes and Sauerkraut: it came with a hefty three sausages and a scoop of both sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. The sausage itself was quite tasty. The sauerkraut was less pickled then I was used to, and it was a little too soft for my liking. The mashed potatoes were almost a puree, they were very smooth and probably the best part of the meal. \n\nApple Strudel: The apple strudel came last and since the three of us shared all the items, we were more then ready for dessert. I'm not much of an apple strudel connoisseur, but i do know when we have hit the jackpot and we probably didn't hit the jackpot here. The strudel was decent, not to die for but definitely on par.  \n\nPros: \n-Very authentic German feel\n-Large beer selection with friendly bartender\n-Friendly servers \n-Old school yet innovative seating style\n\nCons:\n-Food only decent\n-Very loud, we were constantly yelling (we expected and were prepared for this)\n-On the pricey side (it wont break the bank, but definitely not cheap)\n\nIf I was to go again, I would probably opt to try more Germanish food like schinizel or spatzle instead of just sausage and mashed potatoes.", "author": "Betty C."}

And yeah, I will be back.\n\nFull disclosure: I don't like beer. \n\nGo ahead, jump to the next review, its not like there aren't enough or everything has been said before. But with that said, this place rocks. I mean two-liter glass boots of beer!?! Are you kidding me!?! That is pretty f***king awesome.  It may not be my drink of choice, but I can respect the boot of beer. Oh, and it comes in \"glasses\" up to 5 liters. Someday, I will come back with the rowdiest group I can muster and order like multiple 5 liters. Epic.\n\nAnd a rowdy group of old college buddies/bay-to-breakers teammates seems to be the ideal company for this place. With the comunal tables, and walls that absorb exactly zero sound decimals, Suppenk\u00fcche basically is designed for a guys night out. Except, for some reason it that wasn't when I went.\n\nDid we come at a weird time? I'm not sure, but whatever happened the place was full of families and little children. Ugh. Nothing ruins an atmosphere for me more that a crying baby or toddler throwing a sh*t fit when I just want to have a nice evening. Minus one star.\n\nBut back to the beer. the selection is great. I obviously didn't get to try all of them, but from what I did get, (and sampling from friends' beer at my table), its top notch. Good beer + kick ass sizes = two stars. \n\nAs for the food. I wish I can say it was all amazing, but it seemed more hit and miss. We ordered the potato pancakes since Yelpers have raved about 'em. Not too impressed. They seemed over-cooked to me. \n\nTo be fair, my meal was a win. I ordered the Grilled Pork Sausage with Sauerkraut & Mashed Potatoes. Perfect. The only critique I can find is with the mashed potatoes. I was raised in Idaho so I know a thing or two about 'em. While they are very good, I've had richer, creamier ones back home. \n\nThe other downside was the Wiener Schnitzel I tried. Again, it didn't blow me away. Maybe I needed more beer in me, but they seemed dry. \n\nFinally, kudos to the apple strudel. While some people at the table were disappointed that it wasn't \"traditional\" enough. I didn't really care b/c its amazing. Like I could have ordered another one amazing. \n\nSo, to sum it up, I'd give my experience 3 stars. If the food had better consistency and they banned children, I am sure next time I'd give it a significantly better score.", "author": "Jeff C."}

Of course, on numerous occasions people here in the U.S. will tell us of X German restaurant and claim that their German food is really good-- which 99.9% of the time turns out to be a complete embarrassment to the German culture. \n\nAnyways, that is not the case with Suppenk\u00fcche. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming. There are several wooden tables where the patrons eat together, often sparking interesting and neat conversations with people you would normally never have met (because all the cool people eat at Suppenk\u00fcche;). Often people will start singing with huge glasses of beer, or rather out of a huge boot(!) The ceiling is always artistically crafted and it's just a really lively place to eat. \n\nI would recommend getting there right at 5 p.m. when they open. There is often a line of people waiting and it fills up really quickly. If you miss the 5 p.m., then get there around 6:30 because that's when the first wave will start finishing their meals and paying. As for the food, love, love, love the German pancakes! They taste delicious. Also make sure you have it with their homemade applesauce-- I can't get enough of it. I always get the Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein mit Bratkartoffeln und Gr\u00fcnem Salat (Breaded and Sauteed Porkloin with Roasted Potatoes & Green Salad), but instead of their green salad, I order their red cabbage. Also, a little dish of their applesauce on the side. It's a pretty large portion and I always feel stuffed afterwards, but in a really fulfilling, I'm-going-to-sleep-well tonight, kinda way. The other food is also delicious. To be frank, we've never had a bad meal. \n\nThe waiters/waitresses are so completely kind.

Why yes, I would love to pick up food shortly and take it back home so that we may enjoy it languidly and in peace.\n\nThe only thing that could have made it more awesome would have been this: before I paid and took my treasure trove of sausage over delicious potatoes with bacon, topped with perfect sunny-side-up eggs, the waitress asked me if I wanted any beer with that. \"You mean I can take bottled beer with me? To go?\" My knees went a bit weak and I looked at the chalkboard listing more delicious draughts than I could comprehend in that moment. In a truly perfect world, the answer would have been yes.

Spaetzle and sauerkraut are good too. But the reason I come here, of course, is the beer. They have what seems like 20 imported german beers on tap which cover the whole array of german beer-making. The bartenders, when not ridiculously busy, are EXTREMELY knowledgeable, which is a help for fledgling beer snob wannabes like myself. \n\nOne bonus point goes to their Oktoberfest celebration. The first Sunday of the celebration has a huge party with an accordion player, music, Mas of beer for $3 and \"Das Boot\" being passed around from person to person.\n\nOne more bonus point goes to the decorations and artistic stylings in the place.

What a surprise that on a Sunday evening around 6:00 pm that it was so busy!  Clearly this is a popular spot with the neighborhood.  We waited about 35 minutes for a seat which wasn't too bad considering the great selection beer they had as well as the affable bartender.\n\nSince it was just two of us, we were seated at a table with 4 others.  That's a pretty common occurrence at Suppenk\u00fcche so be prepared if you don't like sharing your table space.  The one thing I was really excited to try was the potato pancakes as they're a favorite of mine.  I was slightly disappointed at how fried they were....I'm used to potato pancakes having a bit more potato texture and less fried potato.  The applesauce they were served with was delicious though.  For my main course I had the bacon wrapped meatloaf.  As good as this sounds, I was so unimpressed, I didn't eat it all.  That being said, I should know better than to order meatloaf at a restaurant as I generally only like my Mother's meatloaf\n\nOverall I'd probably not choose to come back here although I wouldn't be averse to coming back if it was with a bigger group.  I'd just set your expectations low for the food and if you're impressed, then you'll be pleasantly surprised.  The beer is definitely worth going to check out and the atmosphere is boisterous and fun.", "author": "Melanie N."}

It wasn't the back door, space is just kind of scarce in this place, especially since it was consistently jam packed through out the 3 hours I was there on a Friday. \nPerhaps not for those who have a serious need for personal space. \nThe beer was great, my group of 4 tried 4 different beers (one had the beer mixed with lemon soda, which she thought was interesting but in a good way.) \nNo one ordered a boot (to my dismay) but the boys drank enough over the 3 hours to have ordered a boot (which is 2 liters.) Plus they have a 5 liter cup (I keep imagining a straw must be necessary) , but I didn't see anyone in the restaurant order that. \nThe staff was super friendly. From the host, to the bartender, waitress and bus boy, well...bus man, they were all super nice. \nThe tables are, I hear traditionally European, I've never encountered anything like it before though. There were about 8 tables or so, some bigger than others, but if you have a group of 2, they WILL sit you with a group of 4 at a table for 6. This might seem a little weird, but the people we sat next to were really nice, awkwardness did NOT ensue. (Really.) It was an excellent way to chop it up with your neighbors.\nNow, my favorite part .... \nThe food. Good grief, was it delicious. I had the half chicken & dumpling (which is cooked INSIDE the chicken) and instead of potato pancakes I had spatzle. YUM! Everything was soooo delicious, it's hard to even explain it to you. The chicken was perfect, the dumpling inside was delicious, the spatzle was.. well gone pretty quickly. Others, got the trout & pork chop which they both liked. The portions were really decent. (That means they weren't paltry or obscenely large.)  \nOh! And the decor was adorable. It was really simple and darling, the ceiling was covered in a little tiny hooks that they had butterflies attached to. Very cute.  \n\nDespite the small spaces and crowds everywhere, I adored this place.\nBe forewarned, do not come here for a \"quiet\" evening because while I wouldn't call the bar crowd rowdy, they were loud (and cheerful!)", "author": "Ashley S."}

This is not where you should go if you want any elbow room.\n\nThat being said, I still adored the bar. The bartender, Craig, was one of the most helpful bartenders I've ever met. Not only did he really know the beers he was serving, but he knew how to recommend the beer that you wanted to drink. He was extremely friendly, and happy to have a conversation even as he was being swarmed by hoards of thirsty customers on all sides of the bar. Also, the beer was good. Really good.

Daphne A. ordered the (WeiBwurste mit Brezel) white veal and pork sausages in butter broth with a big fresh pretzel....the sausage was soft but she had a hard time cutting the casing...looks like she needs more muscle on her arms.

[Tip - if you come with a large group of like 6 try to get there earlier and try to get everyone there at the same time - they won't seat partial groups.] Good thing there's good German beer to drink while you wait. Also helps soothe your throat because it's get loud and you'll be shouting a lot. The food is solid. And in some cases sublime - like the meatloaf. So light and fluffy! The spaetzle is good as always but best with cheese as a vegetarian dish rather than plain as a side dish. I have to admit the allure of their spaetzle has gone down just a tiny bit since I made the effort to learn to make it at home (or rather got hubby to learn to make it). They were also nice enough to bring out a slice of black forest birthday cake (no charge!) which was the fluffiest cake I've had. I guess I have a thing for fluffy and Suppenkuche does fluffy well.", "author": "Jean K."}

Underberg (just say \"oonterberk\" to be extra German) is an medicinal, alcoholic, HEALING beverage that I had the pleasure of coming to know at the end of the meal.  Our server was kind enough to tell us how to drink it properly, and then show us how.  Twice.  He did two \"shots\" with us - and for that we loved him even more than we thought we could have.  \n\nTop-notch food, great service (thank you JOHN), outstanding atmosphere, easy-to-get-to location.

Another time I came with my brother to hang out at the bar, which was fun because he loves beer and he tried a couple of them.

The tables are wooden, like a typical European pub, and the menu gives you the option to order huge kegs of beer. We ordered the bacon wrapped chicken loaf with an egg on top, which sounds very rich, and flavorful which is exactly what it was. Although it was very salty, the chicken's sweetness evened it out. We also ordered the breaded veal, which was surprisingly light and tasty. however, the noise level at suppenkuche was a bit too loud for me. the sound of chattering people bounces off of the wooden walls and creates a very loud atmosphere.

It was crowded, so she asked if we minded waiting outside and she'd come get us.\n\nTwenty minutes goes by, then thirty, and we come back inside to find out how much longer she thought it would be, only to find her seating not 1 but 2 of the parties who came in right after we did. Both were parties of three, so it wasn't because they were smaller than we were or larger than we were. \n\nBut we're pretty easy going people, so we didn't think much of it at the time. We just waited to talk to her to find out if we'd be seated soon as well.\n\nShe saw us, made eye contact with me, turned bright red and then deliberately turned her back on us - ignored my friend when he tried to get her attention - and started flipping through her list of names. Again and again. She then walked right past us to talk to a couple who had just come through the door and were waiting behind us (who made a loud stink about having to wait an hour and a half, but ultimately decided to put themselves on the waitlist) and then she finally deigned to speak to us only when a waiter knocked into her and she turned to smile at him and wound up facing us. I kid you not. She tried THAT hard to ignore us. It was weird.\n\nShe told us she didn't have any tables available. When I asked how long it would be, she said about half an hour. I have been a hostess, so I know how hard it is, and I had absolutely no tone or attitude when I mentioned that she'd said it would only be ten minutes nearly half an hour before that and did she have any better idea of how long it would be at this point.\n\nThis is the part that pisses me off: the hostess snapped at me (SNAPPED at me) that she didn't know how long people would sit around at a table once they'd paid.\n\nA) She'd given our table away, obviously.\nB) She didn't have the decency to own up to it.\nC) She treated me like dirt when I asked how much longer she thought it would be.

So if you are planning on an intimate setting, you may want to consider an alternate location.\n\nBar- Small area dead center of the room, so you have to work your way past the tables to get there, but still a cool little bar.\n\nService - This one is a downer.  Friendly staff, quick seating, but don't expect a whole lot of attention since the place is so busy.  They are attentive, but do take a while to come around.  They will not split a check either even if you ask before hand.  Still ok though.\n\nIn the end a neat experience with some great food and drinks.", "author": "David C."}

He lives in Miami where there isn't such a wide variety of cuisines so he usually comes with a list of things he wants to try. This time it was Burmese and venison. When we searched 'venison' in yelp, Suppenk\u00fcche came up so we headed their way with low expectations - I wasn't THRILLED about the idea of eating Bambi. \nI was sold from the moment we stepped in.  The place is so effortlessly cool, I absolutely fell in love with the decor.  I wish they took reservations, but apparently they only do so for groups of 6 or more.  The wait wasn't that long though - about half an hour which we spent at the bar drinking beer and enjoying an array of cured meats. \nI didn't know that they were communal tables since they aren't that large, but we were seated in a table with four other people which felt a tad bit crammed but we made it work.  I think it would be a good idea to ask patrons if they mind sharing a table or would rather wait for their own - especially when you are dining with the parents. Sometimes you want a little more privacy. \nThe menu was FANTASTIC, at least for a meatatarian it was. WOW, I wish I could have gotten one of each! Everything sounded delicious.  My dad obviously had the venison which was good but nothing out of this world, my husband had the goose which was ridiculously good, my mom some other meat thing that was really good, and I had the meatloaf which I am head-over-heels in love with.  \nI will definitively be back for buckets of beer and meat soon.", "author": "Mrs. G."}

We had to wait forever for him to come by.  The meat was very dry and tough; I've had much, much better German food.  In Germany I actually had quite a bit of good vegetables as well.  Here, the salads were very disappointing, the cucumber salad was basically a soup of dressing with old, sick looking cucumber slices and the green salad was basically just lettuce.  I'm not into creamy rich fish, which is unfortunate as the fish was floating in cream sauce.   The spatzle and wurst was decent.  I know the bare, simple furniture and the old, scratched, dirty looking plates are supposed to be part of the charm, but it didn't excite me.\n\nAlso, I'm afraid I'm a bit of a spoilsport, and the whole experience had me down, but when people at my table got boots full of beer, I didn't see it as that exciting.  There are lots of places where you can get a 'yard' of beer, and that seems more like a Spring-break style novelty.  Unless you drink really fast, the beer gets warmer and flatter at the end.

I have eaten at suppenkuche a few dozen times over the last 6 or so years. I live in the neighborhood, and have always been amazed at the sort of perfection of their business. As testament to that perfection I have rarely eaten there recently since it is always crowded and waits on a tuesday have been 40 minutes at 8pm. Good on 'em. \n\nBut last night I felt lucky. it was monday and there was a spot for three at the end of a table. No problem. the little alcove was full of people and they were making a bit of noise but nothing too terrible at first. then our food comes, and the group in the alcove starts shouting at the top of their lungs, \"ausie ausie ausie\", or some crap like that, then cheering. I couldn't see what was going on, but I figured someone was drinking alot. \n\nOkay once, fine, twice, a little annoying, but it went on for an hour, louder and louder. I mean, this is a restaurant, and not a bar menu type place, but a good solid $20 a plate restaurant, with 70% of their costumer space dedicated to dining.  when the group in the alcove began we had just taken our seats, the only seats in the place available. by the time we were done eating the place was cleared out.\n\nThis San Francisco, and San Franciscans are polite, they say nothing, leave quietly, tip, but the place cleared out. the waitress was a on edge. it was just ridiculous.\n\nNow this large group of guys who came from some place where it is completely okay to yell at the top of your lungs in a crowded little restaurant over and over again (I know this is normal for some people, but really, are those normal people, or just rude effing a-holes who can't hold their liquor. seriously, what kind of backwoods hick hoots and hollers at full volume without regard to others in a restaurant) and this wouldn't reflect badly on the restaurant if it weren't for the joy and encouragement the bartender was giving the group in the alcove. He seemed like he was finally living his dream of working a shots bar in Tijuana. It is just a mentality I don't easily get. Really who thinks it is okay to yell next to people as they are eating and chatting to their friends. \n\nI did the bitching routine to the manager and got a lot of sorry, but \"you know it is a german style place\" no shit. so german means yelling over and over again in a tiny restaurant. So germans are idiotic loud bastards who can't hold their liquor? that seems unlikely.  and a bit of the excuse thing, that \"well this is how this place is. here is some drink tickets come early when it will be more mellow\" \n\nSo if suppenkuche is fostering as much frat/marina sports bar atmosphere as they can these days, no problem, I will gladly avoid the place like the plague.", "author": "harty s."}

I am a girl and I have a small bladder--the boot is 2 liters of beer.  There was no way I could have finished it.  I wanted to save room for the delicious food.  Everything that came out of the kitchen looked sooo good!  In our 1.5 hour wait, which actually turned out to be less than that, we decided on what dishes we wanted. We ordered potato pancakes at the bar, and within 5 minutes, it came out! Talk about quick service!!  Before we even finished our appetizer, our name was called for our table.  \n\nIt is interesting how they seat you with random people, but again... do as the Germans do!  We ordered the venison medallions, the holiday goose special, and the breaded red snapper to share as family style.  Since everyone raves about the spatzle, we all got sides of that.  The spatzle was just OK... nothing special.  It just tasted like pasta with no sauce.  Aside from the plain spatzle, all of our dishes were delicious!  The goose was interesting in that the texture was like pork, but had a poultry-like taste. The mushroom sauce that came with it was delicious.  The venison also had a good sauce, and was cooked nicely.  It was similar to eating steak and didn't taste too gamey.  The red snapper didn't taste \"german\".. it was a pretty typical giantic piece breaded fish that came with pickled tomato and cucumber salad.  The tomato cucumber salad was definitely the favorite of the night! \n\nOverall, the food is pretty good and comes in big portions--enough to share! The service wasn't too bad either.  The food came out pretty quickly for how packed the place was.\n\nWhat I really liked about this place aside from the food, was that this restaurant has got to have the most lively and spirited crowd... when it's someone's birthday here, everyone in the restaurant joins in on the celebration and pounds on the table.  It happened probably 5 times since I was in the restaurant either waiting for my table or eating my food.  I feel bad for the neighbors upstairs!  This place gets pretty loud.\n\nOverall, good food, simple yet cool environment, and good service. Would come back again!", "author": "Diane L."}

A great appetizer. \n\n- the lamb chop with truffle butter. Lovely cut and tender, nicely cooked (although on the bone, so avoid it if you don't prefer that). If I had it again I would order it medium rare, but still good cooked medium. Served with green beans that were not overcooked. \n\n- the jagerschnitzel, not quite as good as waltzwerk but still with a yummy, mushroom sauce.\n\n- the sausages and kraut, an ideal example of the old favorite.\n\n- the chicken with dumpling stuffing, a huge meal with tender, well cooked chicken, savory seasoned skin.\n\nI just wish it wasn't so incredibly loud. I was just guessing what my friends were saying to me, as we were all shoved and jostled by the huge crowd of people that were allowed to stand in every inch of floor space, drinking and shouting at each other.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-29", "description": "Suppenk\u00fcche was the scene of the most sacrilegious last supper I had ever been a part of.\nThe 12 of us sat at a long, birch wood slab table in the back of the cramped restaurant with decor reminiscent of a medieval banquet hall.  My coworkers and I were gathered together to hang out for good times and good food and to have one \"last hurrah\" before two of us switched to another team.  There were no wenches, no mead, but there was a GIANT glass boot of beer (more than 16 inches tall and four inches wide by eye-ball measurement) passed around from person to person.  Each took a gulp, wiped their lip, and passed on to the next.  The Catholic school girl in me shook her head at the bad kids and their bad communion, but the bad kid in me kept the good times going and passed it along.  I didn't take a sip though.  Beer is not always my thing and I was feeling more like wine anyway.  I ordered the sweet Riesling which was the BEST Riesling I have ever had.  I am no one's wine connoisseur, but I could actually taste the medley of grapes mixing and interacting with each sip. FABULOUS!  I had a taste of my co-worker's dry Riesling and it too was great, but not as great as the sweet in my opinion.\nTo start out the meal, our waiter brought out pumpernickel bread with a dill/onion spread.  The bread alone was a bit sour and definitely needed the spread for the taste.  We also sampled the potato bread with apple sauce which had a nice, light and crunchy texture.\nAs I scanned the menu for my main course, one of the items struck me: Oxtails?  Anytime I had had oxtails before, it was in Latin, Caribbean, or South American cuisine.  'What the heck did Germans know about some doggone oxtail,' I wondered... There was nothing else to do but order it.  Turns out, the Germans do in fact know what they were doing. LOL!  The meat was so succulent, it was falling off the bone.  It was drenched in a very salty reddish brown sauce (I had to move the oxtail out of the sauce and onto the side of the plate a bit to get it away from the saltiness toward the end) and served with buttery, delicious Sp\u00e4tzle.  It was a lot of food. I could hardly eat it all and gave a good portion away, but it was definitely the right choice.  The rest of my table happily munched along as well, so it seems that all the meals were crowd-pleasers. I was too focused on my own to ask.  For dessert, we ordered the apple strudel and dark chocolate cake.  Neither one was mind-blowing, but they were ok.  In the end, the entrees were the real show.\nFor all of you who claim they don't like German food (and there are surprisingly a lot in my circle of friends and acquaintances), I would say hold your declarations until you try Suppenk\u00fcche.  If any place can change your mind, it's here.\nPROS: large portions\n            delicious\n            authentic\n            great for groups (need a reservation)\n            fun and festive atmosphere\n            fair prices\nCONS: Food is heavy, so be prepared\n            Crowded and small (but worth the hassle if you have to wait)", "author": "Elsa M."}

I've been there a few times over the past few months with a party of 4 or less around 8pm and have been turned away at the door because they weren't taking names.  Considering they don't take reservations, that's pretty damn annoying.\n\nThe food is perfectly good German food.  I find it a bit on the bland side but you can always salt your food to get it where you like.  I do love the bread basket and the potato pancakes with applesauce.  And they make a great Radler.\n\nBut the crowds and the noise are just too much for me.  It's a great place for a large group of people, I suppose, if you can get a reservation.  But if it's just 2-4 people who want a nice dinner out to catch up on life, this is so not the place.  You'll never be able to have a conversation, though you might not have anything to say to each other anyway after waiting for 1.5 hours for your shared table.\n\nMy germanophile tastebuds and sensibilities prefer Schmidts hands down.  But Suppenkuche can be a cool experience, especially if you think that 8 people passing around a huge glass boot full of beer and taking a swig of Spaten and saliva is fun.  Five years ago, that was fun.  But I think I may have outgrown the place.", "author": "Courtney N."}

This restaurant is very LOUD and overcrowded.  Seriously, you can barely hear the person sitting across the table.\n\nThe process for waiting for a table is a bit unfriendly.  They'll quote you a wait time (say, an hour and a half), but they won't take your phone number or roll your name over if it comes up early.  If they say 90 minutes and your table is ready in 45, you're out ot luck.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-21", "description": "Couple things you should know before you head out here:  Parking is difficult so walk; the seating is communal, so you share a table with other parties, which can be fun or isolating depending on how extroverted or introverted you are.  Also it can get kind of loud.  The ambiance is chill and check out the ceiling art with birds and branches.  \n\nI recommend the potato pancakes with apple sauce.  I always screw up the sauce to potato ratio and end up with no sauce for the 2nd half of the potatoes.  The potatoes are thin, crunchy and hash brown like.  It is in the appetizer portion of the menu.\n\nFor the main portions, I always get the J\u00e4gerschnitzel porkloin with the mushroom sauce.  It's an excellent choice if you can't decide, though you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  There is plentiful mushroom sauce to go around with your pork cutlets and also comes with a side of Spatzle, which is like cheese or pasta...I actually don't really know what it is but sometimes I like it and other times its meh....\n\nHuge selection of beers; I always go for the Bitburger.

We went for brunch, knowing that it would be less crowded and thus, not as noisy and because they have our fave dishes on the brunch menu.

When we asked to move to the front or even to another table in the back we were met with attitude. \n\nHere's where our experience started to deteriorate.

The first time we brushed it off, but then he starting banging on the bell incessantly even when the waiters were all hovered around the counter waiting for the food.

It was like being in Germany (where I lived for half a year...) or as close as I think I could get...being in the USA.  \n\nThe stars are as follows:\n\n1. The menu actually contains German words and phrasing.  I'm not so fluent that I can tell if it's correct, but I know it was at least a better attempt than I could do.  And I don't just mean they included the words \"wein\" or \"schnitzels\" or \"bier\"...the whole entree was described in German...and then in English also.\n\n2. They have a radler! I haven't seen or had a radler in such a long time, it was very awesome to find one.  The beer selection is not large, but it is well varied, based on different beer styles, and served in special beer glasses for each beer (as they should be...).  The menu mentions a 50 dollar charge for breaking the glasses.  Don't come to get wasted! Also, 25% off of radler and radeburger for those who ride their bikes, and can prove it, to suppenkuche.\n\n3. Food tastes fabulous. \n\n4. Simple decor with German style seating.  It's like going to Munich and eating at the hofbrauhaus...a very miniature one.  There are long tables and benches to sit on.  Don't worry, there are some tables/chairs too.  But, if you sit at the benches, you will most definitely sit with others.  Another thing that was great, we entered right as they opened...and the entire place was full before we left.\n\n5. Great servers, who can squeeze though a crowded room with ease.  The room became full, and it's not a huge place, but somehow they maintained good service.\n\nThe only issue we ran into was that they can't split checks.  We had to calculate the value of our part of the bill, and give the split totals to the server.  Not such a big deal, the check was still split and everything was fine.", "author": "cyndi t."}

This was my reason for ordering the venison medallions in red wine sauce the first time. My friends couldn't believe I was going to eat Bambi. Bambi was delicious.

He is always in the restaurant and checking up on his guests to see if there is any little extra he could do. I had bought my favorite beer for my dad and when he tried it he mad a face, the owner saw it and offered to get him a beer he would like better. He asked him what kind of beer he liked and my dad told him, \"Coers Lite\" He smiled and got him something he said he had brewed himself.

Last time I went my friend Michelle was eating her when the owner came over and asked her if she wanted to try Nutella and she said it made them even more amazing.\n\nBelieve it or not this German restaurant is good for Vegetarians. I have brought a few who were apprehensive but are now regulars. Their egg dishes for brunch are amazing! \n\nNow the warnings. This is a very German restaurant, It's full of loud people having fun and enjoying conversation so if you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner, look elsewhere. Also if you are a small group you will likely be seated with other people at your table. It helps keep the line of people waiting down. Very German. I think it's fun.  If you get the right people sitting at the table with you make new friends. I like to talk to people, so if you get sat at a table with me and would rather not meet me. just ignore me and enjoy the yummy food. I'll get the hint.", "author": "Eric M."}

I came here when my bro was in town and we both loved it.\n\nExpect long lines. There isn't much bar space, but the bartenders are great and very attentive.  They have a pretty wide selection of beers on tap and we went with the special pilsner of the day which quenched our thirst.  They also have these giant boots that they import straight from Germany.  I wouldn't recommend getting one unless you can drink fast or you'll have yourself a whole lot of warm beer!\n\nExpect rich, hearty, delicious food.  This place is definitely not for the health conscious.  We got the potato pancakes, meat/cheese plate, porkloin and venison.

We were seated immediately at a communal table which was to our surprise since it was just after the Oktoberfest weekend fiasco...though we noticed we had just beat the crowd as people began filtering in shortly after we were seated.  \n\nI thought the ambiance and decor of the place, though it is small, minimalistic, and you're seated with strangers, was strangely welcoming and comfortable once seated and settled in.  It feels like a place where you can imagine a fireplace keeping you warm from the cold winter evenings with a bunch of friendly people dining and drinking beers.  The dim lighting is also pleasant.  The only thing is that the noise is a tiny bit overwhelming but given everyone is probably a little buzzed off of beer, it's not a surprise.\n\nI ordered the Jagerschnitzel (fairly thin cuts of pork floured and flash fried then drenched in a creamy mushroom sauce served with a side of Spatzle and a butter lettuce salad) which I thought was very good and hearty...though I haven't had much German food so I don't have much to compare it to.  The pork was very flavorful especially with the tasty, creamy mushroom sauce that it was drenched in.  The Spatzle I found to be somewhat more like gnocchi in its texture.  It was especially good with the mushroom sauce.  The lettuce salad though covered in olive oil, was refreshing to have with the heavy meal.  I also had a bite of the Weinerschnitzel which my colleague ordered.  It was a veal, thicker in cut, that was breaded and fried.  I thought it was okay but definitely not as good as my dish and much heavier.\n\nAfter our meal, I saw the giant pretzel and wished we had ordered that but there would have been no way to even get through a quarter of it given the portion of our meals were HUGE let alone the size of the pretzel was GINORMOUS! \n\nI will definitely go back again!", "author": "Jessica T."}

The menu is not large, however everyone with a decent palate will be able to find something wonderful to enjoy. The food is delicious and shows just how wonderful Germanic cuisine can be. Then feel free to wash it down with the wonderfully wide and diverse assortment of authentic German Biers! I also didn't think that i would enjoy sitting next to complete strangers but found it to be of no concern.

The volume is also a bit loud, so if you don't enjoy shouting while you are eating, this may not be the place for you. \n\nAs far as the food is concerned, I did not find it to be mind-blowing. I ordered something off the specials. Venison Sausage with red cabbage and spatzle. Spatzle is on the list of things to try, so it was a must have. I wasn't really sure what Spatzle is, it pretty much tasted like dry noodles... waht's the big deal? The sausage was okay. Maybe I'm just not into german food. \n\nNot really sure what the hype is.

Its sad because the staff is excellent and knowledgeable about the food and beer but you can see it in their eyes, \"Please Don't Ask Any Question's My Throat Is Worn Out...\"  Its the same look of panic i notice from cabin crew on airplanes when they are getting nailed by the Give Me Give Me crowd.  The restaurant throws the food at you as fast as they can is it because they want to be out of the madness or because they are fostering this environment and have gotten greedy? \"Keep it Loud and Fast and turn the tables\".  Anyway, not a very enjoyable dinner last night at all, the food was just warm and arrived so fast we didn't have time to enjoy a beer. The chef really likes his DING DING DING DING DING bell...

Very carb-y. Red cabbage- barely touched it - berries overpowered it. too sweet..\nAlso had a special for the night: Salmon with mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed spinach- Highly recommend this. Salmon was moist and a generous portion was given. Spinach was flavored with lemon perfectly. \n\nOverall:\nMost people come for the beer (you can order a 2 liter boot of beer but they require you give them a credit card to hold until they get their precious boot back.. They also have larger & smaller vessels..) and traditional menu. I liked the atmosphere best. The good service, friendly people, unique experience and generous portions make this a great place to try. The wait is long though. Come expecting a 2 to 2.5 hour wait on a Friday or Saturday.

Good selection of Bocks and Belgian Ales. I had a beer before dinner, and another one during my feast. While I was tempted to order the 5-litre glass of brew, I had to contain myself as I drove my expensive luxury automobile there.\n\nAs for the food, it was OK. Nothing outstanding and nothing really stood out. I liked their appetizer plate full of meat and cheese, but meat and cheese can be had at my local Safeway too..\n\nMy main course was the venison. Why venison? I guess I like to eat young things. It was tender, but a bit overcooked for my tastes. The kraut or whatever the red stuff was next to my young piece of meat was a bit too sour for me. Honestly, it was good, but not damned good.\n\nThe crowd was a bit rowdy and youngish.. Not that i'm an old man myself, but come on now..

I've had this type of sausage juicier and more flavorful elsewhere.\n\n-Curry sauce: there just wasn't enough sauce, and the dryness of the sausage just begged for more sauce.  The tomato-based sauce was sweet, but rather odd was that I could not taste any curry flavor at all, but as the meal progressed I could feel a raw curry powder aftertaste. (Maybe the curry powder wasn't mixed well or was added late and did not fully cook with the sauce?)\n\n-Potatoes: well cooked and seasoned.\n\n-Eggs: came out in a really small dish with two eggs, kind of cute.\n\nI also tried my friend's dish, which was meatloaf with potatoes and eggs.  The meatloaf was kind of like a better version of Spam--a big slice of it.  I like Spam BTW, so it's definitely not a bad thing at all.  \n\nNote on the service: I also really appreciated the fact that the chef (or I think it was the chef) came out to check our dishes.

I forget what we had, but the bartender actually took the time to ask us what kind of beer we enjoyed AND he also gave us some samples. When we finally did settle on a beer of choice, we were rewarded with these huge pint mugs. \n\nAnd because the rest of our party didn't arrive at the same time, we had to wait. That's the thing about the whole commune seating that I don't really like at all: you have to wait for your whole party to get there before you can get seated. We were going to get seated anyway, but the hostess informed us that if our party arrived after they would go to the bottom of the list and wouldn't be able to get seated. That was a bummer, and that called for more beer, but this time in standard Oktoberfest mugs!\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is so amazing, too! Everyone is really friendly and fun, though I guess that's due in part to the beer. But once we did get seated and once we got our hands on the boot (der Steifel, as the bartender had told us it was really called and not \"das boot\" ... the \"Hollywood\" term). Let's just say there was banging on the tables as each of us tried to chug that thing. People from other tables were talking to us. It was great!\n\nSo if anything, my message is to go here to have a good time. By the way, there is food here (haha), and that night I had the salmon. It was really tasty, and my friend had some sort of mac-n-cheese dish that was really good too. I would like to go back and have more of the food, but more importantly conquer the boot once more, and that thing that is huger than the booth. Oh yes... there is something bigger than der Steifel.", "author": "Caroline L."}

The good part is if you're not in any rush you can hang around the bar and try the many types of German beers that they serve in giant glasses or a German boot! \nBeer was refreshing. Food was hearty, rich and filling. My boyfriend and I both had the  Wiener Schnitzel that was a wonderful pretzeley-salty breaded pork loin. Meat was delicious and the potatoe pancakes cured my carbohydrate craving! My brother had meatloaf with bacon and an egg inside (sounds odd but great) , and my sister in law had the vegetarian eggplant that was served with some sort of delicious creamy tomato sauce with fancy cheese on top. \nThe part that made this place extra great is my heart broke when they ran out of the german pretzel served with cheese. When we received our check our server took off $7 dollars on our check for the pretzel. Don't you worry Suppenk\u00fcche,  I'll be back to try the pretzel. \nOverall great service and fun environment.

If you're not an onion fan, I wouldn't recommend this at all.  There really was nothing bad about the spatzle -the noodles were cooked perfectly and the texture was just right. \n\nI tried the Portobello Mushroom stuffed with Spinach and Feta and I wasn't a big fan of that.

It is on the small side, but that leads to shared tables, much like an actual beer hall. However, that means getting seated next to a nice, drunken guy that was waiving his boot (and later a coffee cup) around and coming quite close to spilling it on my head.\n\nWe started with the potato pancakes. I love these in general, so I think they'd have to be miserable for me to dislike them; conversely, I can't be impartial in evaluating them. But the apple sauce was very good...not too sweet and it tasted very fresh. Perhaps it could have been amped up with a squeeze of lemon.\n\nI had the pork knuckle. I thought this was actually pretty tough. But kudos for serving this. Anyway, I believe it was roasted, which doesn't serve a piece of meat like pork knuckle as well as a braise. However, the skin was so crispy. It was like I got bonus pork rinds! (Can you say chicharrones?) YUM. The serving was gigantic. But if you have leftovers the skin does not  keep well....so eat that part first! Also came with sauerkraut, which I can totally eat for a meal. The dumpling was really large (it reminded me of a meatball soup I had in Munich....clear broth with one gigantic meatball the size of my fist in the middle of the bowl).\n\nBF got the venison. Two steaks, seared, and served in sauce. A little tough. But again, it's nice to see venison on a menu. Red cabbage was on the side. yum. Spaetzle was meh. I wasn't impressed. It was \"different,\" but also bland...needed some kind of seasoning. They tasted like little gobs of noodle....nothing more, nothing less.\n\nAnd hey, if you're coming here for the food, get a beer. You won't regret it. Please don't be the priss that orders wine with dinner or else I will give you dirty looks. If you're going just for the company, you should still get a beer, because I still will think you're being a priss and will give you dirty looks anyway. And beer is good.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

Scared of even just leaving it on the not so sturdy and often inadvertently nudged picnic-like table that was jam packed, shoulder to shoulder, by our party in celebration of a friend's birthday, I downed over three quarters of das boot within the first 15 minutes. Also, just like how they explain in the movie Beerfest, when you are close to finishing das boot and are drinking it with the foot pointed upwards you need to turn the boot so that the length of the foot is parallel with the ground otherwise confront a rush of bubbles in your face from the air pocket that's created -- I experienced a mild version of this first hand just to test it out.\n\nAs for the food it was very tasty, quite authentic and reminded me of when I visited Germany.

Yet I think paying him back by taking him to Suppenkuche ended up being pretty win-win.\n\nOn a cold drizzly SF night like we had the other day, Suppenkuche truly hit the spot with an ice cold beer, friendly service, and, in all its glory, the bread ball smothered in a rich, thick mushroom gravy.  Since I don't want to gain 50 pounds I won't plan on next time just ordering three of these as my appetizer, main, and dessert, but I'll be tempted.  God that thing was so good.\n\nI don't know anything about beer except that I like what's cheap, so Mikey ordered for me.  Fortunately what I lack in beer snobbery/knowledge Mike makes up for and then some.  Whatever it was, it was crisp, somewhat light, and had a little spice to it.  Very tasty.\n\nI'm a carb whore, so I was also obsessed with the bread and butter.  The butter they serve the bread with is smooth, whipped, salty, and seasoned.  Despite only having four slices of bread we slopped up the entire butter crock.\n\nFor mains, I had the braised beef with cranberries and Mikey had the venison (sauteed in red wine plum sauce).  I wasn't crazy thrilled with either, but they were both very good.  The meat was super tender (I could pretty much cut it with a spoon) and seasoned to perfection.  It *almost* made me crave some veg, but Mikey was thrilled: http://www.myspacebrand.com/funny_pictures/quote-images/_img/quoteimage28.gif.\n\nThe dishes did come with gravy, spatzle and pickled red cabbage, though, which were delicious.  I'm usually not one to leave meat behind, but when it came down to it I scarfed up as much as the spatzle as I could stomach and let Mikey eat about half of my meat.\n\nFrom reading reviews, I think I'm going to go with chicken or pork next time--seems like those tend to be a bigger hit than the red meat at Suppenkuche.  And I'm definitely getting a bread ball all to myself.  Fatty alert!\n\nOur dessert was an apple strudel with ice cream, which was also very tasty.  Even Mike could barely finish it, which is an indication that I got my money's worth at this place.  Trust me, if this guy was full (http://www.summitpost.org/image/470993/155422/ice-step.html), they did an amazing job.\n\nMy main complaint was probably the wait and the noise.  For two, we had to wait 45 minutes to be seated.  We ended up going down the street to Place Pigalle (really chill bar with a decent beer selection when they're not sold out) for a few beers before having dinner.  Then, when we did get seated, we had to practically yell in each others' ears to have a conversation.  Don't get intimidated by the crowd, and just don't try to have a romantic date here--the food is worth it!", "author": "Kara R."}

I have never ever seen this on any menu anywhere outside of the street vendors of *Berlin*. Naturally, it had to be ordered. While it wasn't quite authentic Berlin Street-meat, it was still very yummy and close enough to the real thing be satisfying.  My fiance ordered the Meatloaf which was so delicious.. and I had the Cheese Spaetzle, which was RIDICULOUSLY tasty and filling. \n\nWe only had to wait about 15 minutes before we got a large table (for our group of 7) at the back. The service was quick, attentive and knowledgeable. Their beer list is incredibly extensive.. and if you are a beer lover you NEED to try 'Das Boot'. The biggest glass of beer ever! I just wish they had maybe a cider or two on the menu.. because if you aren't a beer drinker (like yours truly) your options are fairly limited.  But well.. What can you expect from a GERMAN restaurant, right? Oh well.\n\nExpect to sit at long wooden tables, next to people you don't know. It's very traditional german in that way. The benefit is that you're bound to make a new friend or two! Shared wooden tables, noisy, boisterous, glasses of beer everywhere, and big sloppy portions of food.

When we first got there it was packed got our names in the waiting list and went for a walk. The area is nice it has a lot of boutiques, something to do while you wait. We got in about 30minutes after we checked in and the service was great. The night we went was very live... Imagine; Beers banging on the table from a table of 7 then on the other side of the room there are a group of people taking shots with the waiter... the bar was always packed and everyone is just having a good time. Best way to end a work week where everyone can just let loose. When started to order we ordered some beer first and We didn't know what to get so the waiter asked us what type of flavors we like and he gave us recommendations to what drinks to get.

We all shared the Potato Pancakes to start; it comes with apple sauce. I liked it.\n\nI got a Wiener Schnitzel--that was really yummy! I also got to taste my friend's Spatzle and that was yummy, too. One friend got the Ravioli and another one just had dessert, Apple Strudel, I heard both were good. Another friend got the Pork Chop, that was the least favorite food on the table because it was too salty for our taste. Also, don't expect the typical Pork Chop, it's more like a big chunk of ham. So if you like ham and salty foods, then the Pork Chop would be a great choice.\n\nI can't wait to come back for Sunday Brunch!", "author": "Barbra C."}

Instead we just had to make due with our \"just as manly\" huge steins while eating our brautwurst with a spicy mustard and sauerkraut. \n\nThe only thing that I really didn't care for was my friends venison which was unfortunately prepared medium/medium well. Definitely overcooked for my tastes because it's such a lean meat, and fat is \"flavor\".

Luckily, we only had to wait 20min to sit down (compared to 1.5hrs at Nupa =_=). \n\nGot a drink at the bar first. I had a glass of red wine, which was decent...while my friend got the german beer, which is definitely a specialty. It's definitely the best beer I've ever tasted, even compared to the ones IN germany. Highly recommend trying the beer!\n\nThe atmosphere was very vibrant. It's pretty crowded and noisy, but also has an interesting ambiance because the rooms were still slightly dimmed with candle lights. If you want to have a nice and chill conversation, probably shouldn't come here, unless you want to lose ur voice, or if you're looking to a fun place to go to snack and drink and laugh with your friends.\n\nFood-wise, it was pretty decent. Between the two of us, we shared the LOBSTER BISQUE and PENTIL SOUP for appetizers. They were both pretty decent. I liked the veggies one more. I got the GRILLED LAMB CHOPS (friday specialty) while my friend got the pork chop. The lamb chops were pretty good...it came with mashed potatoes, which I didn't eat much of.

This is also the place to go if I suddenly decide I need to gain a few pounds - because I want EVERYTHING. \n\nIt's my hubby's birthday today, and I was deciding to go for either the fancy 'special occasion' restaurant, or try a place where the menu read like a favorites list. Yes, we went with the latter. No regrets here. \n\nI ordered the Wiener Schnitzel, but with spatzle instead of the potatoes. OMG - my tummy couldn't be happier right now. My husband ordered the marinated skirt steak special. Tender steak grilled to a perfect medium rare. Potatoes au gratin that I couldn't stop helping myself to. Fabulous. My entree came with a small salad with a creamy, sweet dressing. Delish. My husband's came with a cucumber type salad - not so fab. But that's ok. The veggies were not our priority tonight. \n\nFor dessert, we shared a warm apple strudel with creme fraiche and a small scoop of ice cream. \n\nI already know what I'm having next time, because there WILL be a next time. Bratwurst with mashed potatoes, and maybe the potato pancakes with apple sauce. \n\nReally nice service from our waiter. He was spot on in picking out an ale for my husband to try, based on hearing a little of what my hubby liked. Very attentive and helpful. \n\nOnly thing that caught us off guard in the very beginning... if you have less than 6 people in your party, be prepared that you will be seated wherever there is room at a table. We were seated with two other couples we didn't know - who didn't know each other either.

The main room is quite spacious, with several private and communal tables, as well as a bar that includes a darker niche in the back. There's also a back room with a larger communal table, where you can see the staff peel potatoes and chop vegetables during off-hours. The high ceilings are adorned with a three dimensional bird and leaf motif - unexpected but cool. \n\nYou can't make a res as a small party, so even during a Wednesday the bar was packed three-deep. No matter, because once you've fought your way to the front and secured one beer, you're set (assuming you can pronounce the name). Pretty sure the smallest glass amounted to a liquid dinner in itself...can't even imagine tackling the boot.\n\nIf you still have an appetite left, good, because the food portions are large and pretty rich. We split their specialty appetizer - the potato pancakes - to start.  Loved the pairing of homemade apple sauce, but we both agreed that the dish would've been better had it been served hot and crispy...our pancakes were on the greasy side.\n\nWe ordered Riesling to accompany the entrees; the sweetness was a nice balance to the heavier food. Never thought I would order (and enjoy) meatloaf with bacon and egg atop a generous mound of mashed potatoes, but it was hearty and flavorful - the ultimate comfort food. The other dish we split was my favorite: veal medallions in a plum sauce with cabbage and sp\u00e4tzle. I still don't truly understand what sp\u00e4tzle is - a pasta-gnocchi hybrid perhaps - but i am obsessed.  \n\nNot sure how there was room for dessert, but we had to try the bavarian cream. Topped with fresh berries, it took cream to another level - sounds weird, but you'll see what I mean. \n\nOverall, a great meal.

On the other hand, everything else about this place sucks.  Allow me to elaborate.\n\nWent here tonight with my girlfriend because we love German food.  We were seated relatively quickly, considering how crowded it was, which was a nice start.  The first thing I noticed, however, was that this place was LOUD.  Like, seriously the loudest restaurant I've ever been in.  And on a Monday night, no less.  They need to put some carpet down or some wallpaper or something to muffle the sound.... it's really, really bad.  The whole night I had to lean in and shout every time I wanted to say something, like I was at a bar.  Except I wasn't, I was at a restaurant.\n\nWe got two appetizers: the potato pancakes and the fried cheese balls.  The pancakes were delicious... basically little hash brown patties with some really tasty applesauce to spread on them.  The cheese balls were kind of gross.  They came out cold and were served with this cranberry sauce that tasted more like wine than cranberries.  So one good app and one bad; those even out.\n\nFor our entries, we got a bratwurst with sauerkraut and roasted potatoes and the bacon and egg meatloaf, which came with mashed potatoes and gravy.  The bratwurst was very tasty (although my girlfriend bit down on something that seemed like a piece of bone and almost chipped a tooth) but the roasted potatoes were meh.  The meatloaf, however, was really really good.  It came with a hard-boiled egg in the middle of it, which was a really nice touch.  The mashed potatoes on the side were quite good as well - certainly better than the roasted potatoes with the brat (which I was surprised by).\n\nI haven't even mentioned our service.  The service was downright abysmal.  We had some blonde amazon who was either the busiest a server has ever been or decided to dismiss us after we didn't order any alcohol.  The group next to us got their appetizers a good 10 minutes before we did, even though we ordered ours 3-4 minutes before them (and they got the exact same appetizer we did).  Our entrees took forever as well, which is fine, but once she brought them out, we pretty much didn't see her again.  One drink refill before the entrees came out, but none after.  We had to flag down a different server to get us a to-go box and to notify our server to bring us the check.  Of course, when we got the check, it had 3 items from the group next to us on it.  She fixed it after we pointed it out.... that is, after waiting 5 more minutes for her to come back to pick up our credit card.\n\nSo, in summary:\n- Food ranging from good to very good.\n- Horrible service.\n- Bad atmosphere due to how loud it is.", "author": "Chad H."}

Blew me out of the water.\n\nThe reason why I had to take 5 star flavors to a 2 star overall:\n\n1) After a long week at work, the last thing I wanted to do on a Friday night was be in a very stressful environment. They don't take reservations so we had to wait an hour (maybe a little more than that) to share a table with 2 other parties. Now, I don't mind the family style seating and getting to know the people sitting with you but it was just too rowdy for a restaurant environment.\n\n2) The boot. Now, the boot is cool. Essentially it's a huge glass of beer that's shaped like a boot. Now the downside of that (yes...there actually is a downside to that giant glass of goodness) is the crowd that it attracts.

It's a pub-style restaurant with drunk, merry people here and there. I love their boot style beers.. how clever! I didn't try any of their beers however because I don't like beer.\n\nI had the Meatloaf (with Bacon and Egg served with Onion Sauce and Mashed Potatoes). This entree appealed the most to me and I'm very glad I chose to order it. The sauce went very well with the meatloaf and the bacon added even more flavor to the meat.\n\nMy bf had the Suckling Pig which came out with Breaded Dumpling and Sauerkraut. Now, I am usually not a big fan of sauerkraut, but it was actually pretty good here! I ended up taking a lot of the sauerkraut on his plate because it went very well with my meal. :)\n\nOverall, I had a pleasant and unique experience at Suppenkuche.

They emphasize communal dining at Suppenkuche, which is a good way to meet some of the other folks in the restaurant.  If there's space at your table, you may eventually have some company.  \n\nThe food was good and hearty.  \n\nI had the Gegrillte N\u00fcnberger Bratwurst mit Sauerkraut und Kartoffelbrei (Grilled Pork Sausage with Sauerkraut and Mashed Potatoes) for $13.50.  Will had the J\u00e4gerschnitzel in Champignonsoe mit Sp\u00e4tzle und gr\u00fcnem Salat (Sauteed Porkloin in Mushroom Sauce served with Sp\u00e4tzle and Green Salad) for $16.50.\n\nThe sausage, all three of them, were served on a heaping portion of mashed potatoes and a generous portion of sauerkraut.  The sausage was good, but not great. The sauerkraut was a bit disappointing, it was a bit bland without the pungent kick that I'm use to.  \n\nWill's pork loin, though, was excellent - tender and flavorful and swimming is an abundance of rich, creamy mushroom sauce.\n\nWe started the meal with Hering nach Hausfrauenart mit Schmand, Zwiebeln, Gurken und Kartoffeln  (Pickled Herring with Sour Cream, Onions, Pickles and Potatoes) for $9.50 that was really good.  The herring was perfectly seasoned and set in a large portion of vegetables and potatoes that was a small meal in itself.\n\nService was kind of slow, they seemed in need of additional help in the front.\n\nIt's loud inside, but that's a good sign. We were there on a Tuesday night and the place was packed with customers, customers who were in a festive and happy mood.  They've got a great selection of German beers, they've got up to 20 beers on tap.  \n\nIt's a fun and festive place to go with friends to enjoy some German beer and hearty Bavarian food.", "author": "Clyde R."}

Here's why:\n\nI'm allergic to lobster.  If I eat lobster, within a couple hours I get extremely hot and I get these wonderful hives that are bright red.  Basically, if I eat lobster, I look like a lobster.  In my case, you really are what you eat.\n\nWhen I was looking over the menu at Suppenkuche, I noticed they had a lobster bisque.  Not for me.  The waiter suggested the pea soup and he verified that it was vegetarian, so I went with his suggestion.\n\nAaaand a couple hours after dinner, I started having an allergic reaction.  Frightening.  I'm assuming something sloppy was going on in the kitchen, and they were using the same utensils in the two soups.  I'm not terribly allergic, but there are plenty of people who are deathly allergic to seafood.  That warrants Suppenkuche's kitchen to be careful about what ingredients are getting in their dishes.  \n\nAdditionally, it's disrespectful to explicitly tell customers that dishes are vegetarian when, clearly, meat is finding its way into the vegetarian dishes.\n\nI'm appalled.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-25", "description": "When my friend and I were thinking of the place to go to for dinner, his suggestion seemed anything but pleasing. My friend described a restaurant that sounded serenely beautiful and inviting, but something didn't add up.  His suggestion was Suppenk\u00fcche, a small German restaurant at 525 Laguna Street in San Francisco. I was apathetic about the choice for several reasons.  I thought of parking, crowds, cramped spaces and more, but what really made me wary was the fact that the food was German.\n I will admit that prejudice and stereotyping had a lot to do with why I was hesitant to try the cuisine of the Fatherland.  The German culture of efficiency, hard work and stoicism seems better put to use in creating the finely tuned engine of BMW's M3, but not kindly tending to a delightful dinner with friends.  Sauerkraut and cabbage sounded as intriguing to me as a tour through an office park. But I had no other options, we were going to Suppenk\u00fcche. Also, the name translates to \"Soup Kitchen\"--no points added for creativity.\n With the decision made and the date established, we rounded up the girlfriends for double points.  We crammed into my Honda Civic Coupe, and we were going off on our dining experience for the evening. Scouring the streets for any resemblance of a spot, parking in the area was difficult as predicted, but we finally arrived.\n The restaurant was tiny and nearly invisible if you weren't looking for it.  I was getting claustrophobic simply thinking of the enclosed space. I noticed all the tables were full, but the tables were huge and most were seated half empty.  This is when my friend informed me that we will be eating with total strangers.  I panicked. I hate being on the near strangers at all, let alone being on a date with John Doe San Franciscan breathing down my arm. When we were seated, I chose the farthest spot from the nearest unknown hipster slurping down some soup.  My breathing back to normal, I started to look around, and up.  The place was really something else.  Tiny black paper birds flew around the void white ceiling, their motions captured in a single still instant. The sight was calming. I continued to look around.\n Behind the bar were taps of different shapes and sizes sprouting out of the bar and walls like mushrooms.  Glass boots were filled with golden ales and pitch black brews.  My shoulders loosened; I smiled for the first time since the car ride.  The conversation picked up in our small group, and we talked like no one else was there.  The waitress greeted us and asked for our drink order, but I had been so caught up in the scenery that I had forgotten to look at the menu. I ordered the first beer that I saw in the tiny bi-fold menu.  She came back so quickly it hardly seemed like she had left.  A big frothy boot was slammed down in front of me. I ordered the Franziskaner, a hefeweizen wheat beer. In the faint light coming through the windows, the beer glowed bright yellow and gold.  It was like candy and about half way through the enormous glass I had a strong buzz and was ready for a hardy meal.\n I really had no idea what I ordered, but I stung together a series of syllables as best I could, and what I got was Sauerbraten mit Lingonbeerkonfit\u00fcre, serviert mit Rotkohl und Sp\u00e4tzle.  It was braised beef with lingonberries served with red cabbage and Spatzle.  The Berries were something I've never heard of, but they tasted amazing. In fact, I haven't had most of the food before, but even something as foreign as spatzle tasted surprisingly familiar.  The egg noodles reminded me of an old recipe my grandma once made for my family. I am not German, my family is not German, yet German culture is so available to Americans that it's hard to make the distinction between the two.  The ingredients and spices weren't all the new to me; it was like tasting the predecessors to all the food I grew up with. The whole experience seemed archaic, like I was going back in time.\n I wanted to try more; I pulled a pork sausage away from my friend for a bite.  The sausage exploded with spicy flavors as I bit into it.  I ate more than I probably should have.  The meals were gigantic and I finished my plate, some of my friend's.  Each dish, heavy with meat and potatoes, was unique and flavorful.  When I finished, I was tired from the food, beer and the chewing. I was exhausted.  We had left we surprisingly little squabble over the bill and hobbled back to the car. In good form I leaned over to my friend driving from the back seat and exclaimed \"Donke!\"", "author": "Graham U."}

But my experience at this over-packed, extremely noisy restaurant was THE WORST I have ever had.  \n\nThey don't take reservations, so you always have to wait.  We (party of 3) decided to dine at Suppen Kuche on a Saturday. We knew it would be crowded, so we decided to get there early - 7 p.m.  We were very lucky to get a parking spot right in front of the restaurant, but our luck was soon to turn to disaster as we entered a very packed, loud restaurant.\n\nThe hostess told us it would be an hour wait.  We decided to brave the wait and enjoy some German beer at the cramped bar.  As we attempted to enjoy some great German beer, we kept getting bumped and stepped on by people cramming into the restaurant. At one point, a woman stepped on me and told me to move. I couldn't move anywhere, so she got pissy and flipped me off.  The hostess seemed overwhelmed by the crowd and was stressing out.  One of the waiters, trying to squeeze through the crowd to deliver to a table, got bumped and dropped and plate full of spatzel all over the floor. Everyone in the vicinity got it all over our shoes. Yuck!\n\nWell, an hour and a half later, we were losing our patience. The hostess, noticing we had been waiting so long, pointed to a table and told us that we could have that table as soon as the people there left. The people finally left, the table was cleared and we maneuvered through the crowd so we could finally sit down only to watch in horror as she seated another group of people who had been there half the amount of time as us.   I couldn't believe it!  With spilled beer on my shirt and spatzel all over our shoes, I finally lost my temper.  I tried to stay calm and asked the hostess why she sat another group who had only been there half as long as we had and she said something about not being able to sit the group at another table. Another guy with his date had also been waiting an hour and a half and was promised half of our table. He lost his temper too.\n\nOnce she realized that she screwed up so bad, she sat us at a table next to the bar. I had to sit right in front of a bunch of drunk people who kept bumping my chair while I ate.  It was so loud we had to yell at each other to speak. \n\nAfter such a horrible experience, it was hard to enjoy the food. It was ok, but definitely not worth the wait.  The only saving grace was our very nice waiter, Brian, who apologized and fed us.  Me and my partner ended up getting in a huge fight because he wanted to leave and not give our money to a business who would treat us like this. Me, on the other hand, figured we waited this long - we mine as well eat.  We went to bed mad at each other and didn't speak until the next day.  If a restaurant dining experience can do this, it's probably a bad idea to go there.\n\nThey really need to have reservations here - to at least help people know when to show up.  Reserve half the restaurant and have the other half for open seating.\n\nAnd the hostess!  Horrible. She never communicated with us, she didn't know how and when to seat people in order of their waiting time, she never apologized for giving our table to another group and she kept giving us excuses for why she did so.  But, I don't think she really cared about our experience. She seemed to care less about us.  That's the problem when restaurants get too popular. They lose the concept of good customer service. Who cares about 3 little people when the restaurant is always crowded.  It wasn't really that we had to wait an hour and a half. It was how we were passed up by a larger group - it was how she never communicated with us - it was her lack of interest in us.  It's kind of like when an airline screws up or a flight gets canceled and no one at the airline seems to care and they won't communicate with you.\n\nObviously, you'll never find me at Suppen Kuche again.  And I have been on the war path telling all of my friends about our experience. It's funny - I'm finding that a lot of my friends have had similar experiences here. Long, long, long waits, extremely noisy, and poor customer service.", "author": "Bubbles S."}

I've had better bad Chinese food.\n\nWe ordered the Schnitzel and it wasn't particularly good schnitzel either--it was more like some sort of pork meat that had been pounded too thin.  \n\nMy husband (who studied under a European sous chef and was stationed in Germany for two and a half years while in the army) said the mushrooms and sauce tasted like it came out of a can.  The spatzle didn't have enough butter and clumped together. It was a very dry spatzle.  He never had food like that in Germany! He also said that there was too much chicken on the menu - German menus had pork, beef, and sausages.  That's what they had back there...\n\nThe place was noisier than a Chinese restaurant, more on par with a baseball game.  It was like being in a successful bar.  There were many drinkers with big beers in hand in the middle of the room talking very very loudly. \n\nThe Schnitzelhaus has better schnitzel, and if we had wanted chicken we could get 1/2 a chicken for dinner and many more sides at the Chicken N Coop at about half the price. (A whole roasted chicken at the Chicken N Coop costs about $7.50--you could bring it home and enjoy it without the obnoxious noise.)\n\nWe went there ten years ago, and we realized last night why we haven't been back.  We obviously forgot that it wasn't such a great place.\n\nWhy the hell would we want to pay for mediocre overpriced food, share the table with complete strangers, and listen to \"bar\" noise.  \n\nMy husband surmises that the place is really a bar that serves a little food on the side.

Gotta love those staples.\n\nThis is a great place, food, service, and ambiance.  Our waiter was most friendly and even started talking classical music facts with the table next to us.  I recommend having a group of 3 or more so you can try more dishes or 6 to get your own communal table.", "author": "Aaron I."}

You can suck it snotty SF health freaks, it's all love in this joint. \n\nFirst off, be forewarned that Suppenkuche (how it's pronounced, I will never know) is packed every day of the week. Reservations are available for large parties only so you're pretty much stuck waiting on that much dreaded walk-in list. The upside however, is that you get to push your way to the bar in hopes of possibly tasting some of the best German beers in town. Reading other reviews, its understandable how the place can sort of have you wanting to bolt out that door as soon as you see the sea of people inside, but trust me, it's worth it. I mean, my MOM loves this places. So you don't get you're own table. So you sort of have to chit chat with other people who may or may not be a little bit odd. It's SF... suck it up.\n\nThe food is hearty in both quantity and quality. You will not leave hungry that is for sure. The wiener schnitzel and j\u00e4gerschnitzel are classic favorites and most dishes come with their excellent spatzle. Try them but if that doesn't float your boat, their daily specials are always spot on. The service is, I must say, a little hit or miss. Maybe they're channeling that age old German smugness but they aren't the friendliest bunch of folks. All that said, I have had countless great meals here and can whole heartedly recommend this place to you, yes you, the one reading this.", "author": "Jonny Bobby G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-09-19", "description": "NEW UPDATED REVIEW 7-16-07:\nWent back to Suppenkuche this weekend.  I made a reservation for a large group.  I had planned a birthday dinner there for a very special person.  The hostess was very rude.  We were 10-15 min late for our 6pm rez. When I approached her, she threatened to give up our table.  I mean, it's impossible to get 9 people to show up exactly on time.  Really.  Being that I was with the birthday boy and he really wanted to eat there, I was all nice to her and I told her I understand.  I then said the rest of our party were on their way.  Then she said that the rest of the group needed to be there in two minutes and even though we had a reservation, we'd have to get out by 8pm no matter what. ( Having worked in the restaurant business, giving two hours for a party of nine is ridiculous!  Near impossible.)\n\nI told her that I didn't realize that there was a two hour eating limit.  She then snapped back (as if I was lying about not knowing), \"well, I KNOW that if you spoke to ANYONE where who takes reservations they would have told you that.  Regardless, you have to be out by then.\"  \n\nNow, maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I don't like having to speed eat to please a hostess or the management of a restaurant.  I mean, I go to a restaurant to eat my food, relax and enjoy company.  it's not as if we'd be sitting there not ordering.  \n\nWe managed to get the whole party there in just a few minutes, and they seated us in the back, which would have been great except that the only way to access one side of the table was by crawling under it.  The hostess and waitress couldn't have cared less about this.  It was totally demeaning to have to crawl under the table to sit!  I mean, they could have tried to pull out the table or something so we didn't have to, but no!\n\nBy the way, we finished by 7:45, 15 minutes before the hostesses/\"restaraunt management's\" allotted eatting time.  On the way out, the hostess had the nerve to say to me \"good job\" for rushing through dinner.  I thought an \"I'm sorry\" or a \"thank you SO much for putting up with our HUGE egos and attitudes\" would have been much more appropriate.  \n\nOverall, the food is fantastic, but the staff's attitudes and the general \"you should feel SOOOOOOO privileged to eat here\" mentality of this establishment have worn on my patience.  Our birthday boy was unnecessarily stressed about his dinner being canceled by the hostess, he had to crawl under a table to sit down, we were rushed through our meal, and all without an apology or thank you.\n\nYes, we were 15 minutes late for our reservation, but everyone in the restaurant industry knows that large parties are late. \n\nI'm really disappointed that this place went from one of my absolute all-time favorites to a place I abhor solely because of the staff's attitudes.\n\nOLD REVIEW:\nThis is a favorite of mine.  It's hard to get a table unless you go early - even on a week night.  It's all German food and all delicious.  I wouldn't recommend eating here if you're on a diet.  The beers are fantastic and served in steins and boots!  \n\nI'm looking forward to my next trip back.\n\nUpdate - I went back after talking up the 2 liter beer in a boot to all my friends.  First item of business was to get the boot.  We were sadly informed that they only owned one boot and the boot was broken!  Boooo!  They need to work on getting another one (or several).  We managed to salvage the evening by ordering 1 liter steins.  The beer was great and the food was as good as ever.  Good enough to forgive them for denying me my boot.", "author": "Angie C."}

Instead, it does some things very well, and some things not well at all.  Bottom line:  this is a great place to drink beer, and a great place if you're looking for a lot of food.  It is not, however, a place to find good (or even passable) food.\n\nBeer:  great selection, with hard to find German beers on tap.  Reasonable prices.  I'm a big fan of places that have the option of smaller beer servings -- here, in .3 or .5 liters, which is the same as a half pint or pint -- so I can try more things or, you know, exercise moderation.  The beer menu is very helpful in breaking down the beer selection by types (and sub-types), though they don't tell you what the types are.  \n\nI found it remarkable that the hipster bartender corrected people's German pronunciation (it came off badly, too), but then the waitress couldn't pronounce words common to SF menus, like \"gnocchi.\"  At any rate, I'm sure you could ask questions, but far be it from the bartender to be gracious if you don't know the difference between bock and dobblebock beers.\n\nAtmosphere:  great.  Fun, communal.  Big shared tables, cute people.\n\nFood:  not great.  I'm not sure if the mediocrity of the food is because German cuisine is really just meat and potatoes.  The classic boring American food (meatloaf, steak, mashed potatoes, sausage) that has thankfully disappeared in the age of eating consciousness and global awareness has its roots in German cuisine (those were the big immigrant populations from a century ago), and Suppenkuche is does little to improve upon those dishes.  It is a faithful adherent to the form, and because of that it's nothing very new, and it's nothing special, even if calling the food German makes it sound somehow different than middle American cuisine.  \n\nThe meatloaf (highly recommended by the waitress) was flavorless, which is shocking since it was wrapped in bacon.\n\nThe trout was good, but conventional.\n\nThe venison medallions were completely inert.  I expect game to taste, you know, like game, but I tasted nothing because the dish was slathered in a thick red sauce that obscured any flavor the meat might have had.  \n\nThe appetizer sampler: -- a total joke.  Ordinary ham and bologna and pickles.  It was as though someone put an Oscar Meyer sampler pack on a butcher block and charged $13 for it.", "author": "Ben A."}

But, do NOT tell me and my party of 8 that just paid a BIG chunk of change for beer and sausage that we have to move.

Despite me hanging out with Wilbur in LA awhile back, I should've REMEMBERED... and not only that, how he always had to use his \"UCLA\" card bashing on my school... don't chu forget Wilbur! We still won the last game.. =D\n\nNow? The SF version... \nThe night started out HIM \"lying through his teeth\" stating how he had gotten me the smallest drink POSSIBLE, when to realize, that there was something BYFAR smaller... but, I eventually gave in, as I decided to chug down my .5L for his birthday, his belated birthday! *giggles * & *does a lady burp* (uh, im drinking beer?)\n\nSo basically yesterday, we texted each other the whole entire day on how I was a \"weaksauce\" in NOT planning to drink & how us rubberheads (TROJANS!) can't hang (ey, at least, we protect ya) and etc (uh HELLLLL~~~~~~~~~LO! Some people have work on NYE!) or NOT being able to keep up with an OLD FART'S status. \n\nUGH!\n\nSo, the last text was, \"Reservations 6pm @ Suppenkuche.\"\n\nI show up, ON TIME, when OF COURSE the Asians show up ASIAN time, not W, but just other people, when after 30 mins or so, we get this corner seating. We prolly looked like mini cockroaches sqooshed into the corner.. WHY? because... after grilling W, he states that no ressies were made. (slaps forehead) SHOULDVE KNOWN! boink\n\nWhat do I remember throughout this evening? Having to be called \"weaksauce\" the whole ENTIRE night.. HAHAH. Fun times tho! Took 2 fotos. (one of W's \"lovely\" stain on his shirt & the difference in the drinks. Mine's the one in the middle, and the left, well, it's called \"the boot\" and that's what he ended up getting. I wish they had a lady version of \"the boot\" or how about \"a stiletto?\")\n\nOverall, the place was super crowded, hella loud, which I think is a great charm, and def a low key, friendly, fun establishment. It's a family style type place where you can grub (the portions are sincerely generous) drink and share endless laughters..\n\nService: Took the guy a great awhiles. Literally had to GET him at one point. He was friendly and accommodating but hella slow.\n\nKey point: There's ONLY 1 restroom, one for the guys and one for the gals. (scratches head) ... ironic, IMHO. You're at a drinking place, and you only have one. Weirdos. (-1)\n\nSo we came with a few... \n\nDRINKS: Wide variety..\n-Franziskaner .5L $5 (so, this is MY drink, which W TRICKED me into saying that this was the smallest one they had).. it was good, not too strong, not too weak, and refreshing ... heck, it's GERMAN beer.. kudos to that. Took me back into time when I drank in Germany. They had some others but I only remember mine but they were relatively cheap) +1\n\nAPPETIZERS\nPotato Pancakes w/Apple Sauce $9 (too crispy, I don't seriously recall tasting the damn potatos! Argh.  Came out donkatsu style. You get 3 huge chunks)\n\nShrimp $11 (You prolly get like 10, and the minute it came, everyone was rushing to get a piece of the sucker. It was good, nice size.) \n\nENTREES\nSauerbratan Braised Beef $18 (so, this is what I got, and it's not as great. The meat was cooked too well, and a bit hard to chew, and a tad bit salty). It was like another Thanksgiving entre because they had cranberry sauce that came out with it.\n\nLambchop $19.50 (this was Wilbur's. Couldn't get my paws off his dish. It was soo good but luckily he was nice enough to let me take one chunk of his, which he prolly got a bigger profit out of MINE since he took 2. I got 3 chunks, but it just wasn't good)\n\nPork Chop $16 (this was good. very juicy.)\n\nMeatballs $15.50 (this isn't on the regular menu, it's on their specials. You get 4 huge meatballs and few chunks of potatos. I totally recommend this... if you've tried A16's meatballs, the only difference is, A16 is more with marinara sauce, whileas this is more soupy. The soup was good tho)\n\nBratwurst $14 (so yes, you're at a German place. You MUST get their sausages, right? Came out damn wrinkly.  You get 3 and it wasn't good at all, kinda rubbery too...)\n\nSauteed Trout $16 (fish was cooked and seasoned well but I would personally pass since I'm a meat eater, even though I heart fish)\n\nOverall, MY personal input? I'd say to get the meatballs, pork chop or the lambchop.\n\nDon't ferget! 18% gratuity will be added to parties of 6 or more..\n.\n.\n.\nDANKE Suppenkuche & Wilafur for the endless laughters!!

I asked the bartender what he recommended in the light to medium category and he immediately poured me 3 samples of stuff and after I picked one, he encouraged me to drink them up, cuz alcohol abuse is unacceptable at Suppenkuche! Haha, I hear that, brutha man!\n\nWe then found ourselves getting way too hungry to function and mingled our way to a seat in the tiny little bar area and to our relief, a couple left and we swooped in on their seats and took full advantage of the eating space. We wanted a plate of several sausages with a whole lotta mustard, much like the Red Lion does in Silverlake in Los Angeles (love that place!), but much to our chagrin, they didn't offer anything like that and so we settled on the potato soup with the wieners floating in it and the pork sausage with the sauerkraut and mashed taters. \n\nBoth were tasty and of course paired excellently with our huge beers. As for the crowd, just a really friendly and cool bunch. One group at the bar even acted as check passers for us which was cool and all around, this was just a really fun time!

But most importantly the food is awesome. \n\nNow I've never actually had German food before and could not pronounce anything on the menu, but I know a delicious combination os ingredients when I see them. \n\nI ordered the meatballs and had my mind blown. They were tender and flavorful and, for lack of a better word, awesome! See I'm the type of person that will savor a good meal and will go as far as eating only half of my meal simply to reenact the mouthgasm that I had the previous day. I made sure that I went home with half of this masterpiece.\n\nNow there was a semi scam going on. I mean I could be wrong it could have just been that particular night or maybe it a tradition that we didn't know about. So we finish our meal and the waitress brings us the desert right and she's all, \"So since I began my shift today there has been this weird things going on. My first table bought my next table's dessert and so on and so forth, so this dessert is yours from my last table. Feel free to join in if you'd like.\" So at this point you're stuck. I mean we HAVE TO buy dessert.... So we did. And by the way, the dessert was delicious so I wasn't mad. Then again i wasn't paying either so what did I care.", "author": "Brittany D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-06-05", "description": "Great, authentic German food and an extremely respectable beer selection.\n\nLet me preface the rest of this by saying that I've lived in Munich (the capital of Bavaria, which is totally the part of Germany with the best food anyway) for about 14 months. I've had lots of real German and Bavarian food over there, but not so much in the U.S.\n\nI've been to a couple of German restaurants in New York City before on a quest to find real German food and both times I've been extremely disappointed. Both places had only a very poor imitation of German food, despite the fact that they had pretty good ratings here on Yelp (I don't remember their names though). I remember having pretzels that were basically just normal bread roll dough shaped like a pretzel with salt on it (hint: that is not what a pretzel is).\n\nThis place finally satisfied me. From start to finish, everything was spot-on or near it. The bread they serve is pretty authentic, dense, chewy, slightly sour, dark, malty, German bread, complete with Kr\u00e4uterbutter (herb butter). We started with an appetizer of Obatzda (a Bavarian cheese spread made with ripe German Camembert, cream cheese, paprika, and one or two other spices including caraway or fennel seeds I think) and a giant pretzel. The Obatzda wasn't exact -- it had a bit too much paprika and was a little spicier than the real thing -- but it was very close and extremely good. The pretzel was perfect -- real and chewy like a pretzel should be.\n\nAt this point I'll stick in my discussion of the beer selection. There's a wide variety of German beers on draft, including lots of choice Bavarian beers from breweries such as Schneider (my suggested Hefeweizen out of the ones they have on tap) and Weihenstephaner. The available bottles further augment an already impressive selection with choices such as Schneider's Aventinus (a Weizenbockbier, strong, dark, spicy wheat beer), the rare (in the U.S.) Augustiner Edelstoff, and the delectable Weihenstephaner Weizen. The bottled beers should be enjoyed from a glass, of course, which they offer you on serving. The glassware and beer serving themselves get high marks. They have proper sized glasses (0.5 L and 1 L, in addition to the many ludicrously large glasses ranging in size up to 5 L which are great for groups), and they serve each style of beer in the appropriate style of glass (Wei\u00dfbier should be served in a different glass than a Lager, for example). Half the time the logo on your glass will even match the brewery of the beer you're drinking :) For reference, my beer selection was Augustiner Edelstoff, Weihenstephaner Korbinian, and Schneider Weisse. All of the draft beers were very fresh.\n\nNow on to the main course. The selection of dishes is good, and they seem to have specials which might change from one day or week to the next. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had Semmelkn\u00f6del (a delicious Bavarian bread dumpling which pairs nicely with just about any sauce), which I didn't see on the menu online. The main dishes give a good coverage of real, standard German dishes. My only complaint is that they should drop the salad that comes with many of the entrees and replace it with sauerkraut or blaukraut (rotkohl, red cabbage spiced, lightly sweetened, and stewed). I ordered the J\u00e4gerschnitzel (a tender porkloin sauteed and served with a rich, cream-based mushroom sauce), which by default come with Sp\u00e4tzle and a salad. I substituted the sides, however, for Semmelkn\u00f6del and Rotkohl. I also tried some of my friend's Sauerkraut. He (a German) and I both agreed that everything they served was very authentic. It was also all extremely delicious.\n\nThe prices are pretty decent for the quality of food. Entrees are all around $20, and the beers are all about $8 for a half liter serving (roughly 16.9 ounces). Even the ambiance inside was authentic -- it feels like any given Gasthaus in Munich. The only thing that wasn't authentic, luckily, was the service, which was also very good with friendly servers. We are definitely going back to this place in the future.", "author": "Josh M."}

I am pretty much always on a diet and I don't eat pork, so the real draw for me here is the PITCHERS of MIMOSAS. Well, yesterday they were ALL OUT. Yes. All out of one of their biggest draws. BOOOOO! Not helping things, they were out of three dishes on the menu ordered by our party AND they were out of two beers. For a place as notoriously busy as Suppenkuche (about one hour for a party of 7), you'd think they'd just go whole hog and stock up on the brunch essentials like o.j. and sparkling wine. Not to mention beer, which they are typically known for.\n\nThey managed to serve the party next to us first, even though we'd been there twice as long. Then they managed to dress my salad even though I asked for the dressing on the side.

My better half had a glorious bacon and potato omelette, and the helles with lemon soda (light beer mixed with lemon soda) quickly became my new favorite brunch beverage.

I think what caught my attention was the fact that they had great beer served in big ass glass boots. The place was loud, crowded, and there seemed to be a long wait to be seated. I'm told it's always like this.\n\nWe had attempted to make a reservation about 2 days in advance for 8:30, but they were already booked up. On a Friday night, I wasn't surprised, so this was our bad. However, they said as long as someone gets there around 7 to put our name in then we should definitely be seated by 8:30. My thoughtful girlfriend took it upon herself to be there at 7 while the rest of us were getting off work and making our way there. She had put a reservation in for a table of 6, but by the time I arrived around 7:45, we needed to add another 2 to the reservation, now totaling 8 in our party. We were told at first that 6 was the max they could seat, but once our table became ready the waiter told us that we could squeeze the other 2 in at our table. This was a relief because I was starting to think our last-minute additions to the party were going to have to wait for a separate table of their own. We fit comfortably at a table that had a booth on one side.\n\nI drank a lot of beer that night so the details are kind of fuzzy. I do remember everyone in my group loving the food and the beer, though. I ordered the Pilsener, which was excellent. The whole table shared a communal boot filled with a light Belgian ale. Next time I'd like to get the light Hefeweizen. I don't remember any of the actual names, but if you describe what you're looking for, the bartender and/or server should be able to recommend something, and we were also provided samples before we committed to what we wanted to pay for.\n\nAs for the food, we ordered two appetizers: Bacon-wrapped asparagus and the potato pancakes. Both were delicious, and for dinner I had the wiener schnitzel, which continued the trend of awesomeness this place provided. The only thing I would have changed was instead of the red potatoes provided with my entree--I wish I would have gotten the mashed potatoes instead. Just a personal preference, the potatoes were still great though.\n\nWe took our time sitting at the table BSing and never felt rushed, although I do feel like our food call fairly quick considering how packed it was and how big our party was. I honestly can't find anything to complain about. It's even close to Bart! I'll be coming back, hopefully sooner than later.", "author": "Brandon M."}

One of the few German joints in the City or at least one of the few well known ones. \n\nAmbiance (5): Very festive with long tables that I assume should be reminiscent of Oktoberfest. Similar to Schmidt's but much more crowded, which I think is a plus. However, one complaint, the wait for a table is outrageous. An hour and a half wait, ouch!\n\nFood (4): Food was similar to Schmidt's; lots of carbs and some protein. The mashed potatoes were solid and are a perfect vehicle for the sauce that accompanies the protein. In my case I had the meatloaf wrapped in bacon and with egg. The egg was not a plus, but the bacon took it to another level. My girlfriend had the pork sausage which was awesome, but I was surprised they didn't have more sausage selections like Schmidt's. Blutwurst, anyone? A buddy had the venison and he complained it was too well done. And finally, the potato pancakes were well executed; imagine perfectly crisp hashed browns discs with some apple sauce. The beer selection was varied and they have lots of size options, including a handy size chart with silhouettes and all...kind of like the old plane silhouette charts from WWII (saw it in a movie once).\n\nService (4): Friendly staff, prompt service, no complaints.\n\nValue (4): At first I thought the prices seemed excessive, but the portions are good and I didn't mind them at all in the end.\n\nOverall: Strangely enough this place is far different from Schmidt's. Sure, German beer on tap, long wooden tables, but the menus were vastly different. The carb-protein-kraut combo was the same but Schmidt's had more sausages and just seemed drier, if you will, compared to Suppenkuche's plates which always seemed drenched in some kind of gravy sauce. Not that that is a bad thing, but they are vastly different food experiences. You should try them both.", "author": "Alvaro H."}

Last time I had a Jaegerschnitzel and there was just too much sauce, also the Maultaschen were a bit mushy. the red cabbage is too sweet, but they make excellent Sauerkraut, got nice sausages, good Wiener Schnitzel and the ambiance with the beer benches is as close as you can get to Germany here.

It's loud and raucous, but that's part of the charm. They don't take reservations for less than 6, but I wouldn't really advise going with a group unless they're people you don't want to talk to - it's too loud to carry on conversation with more than one person. \n\nFor a romantic dinner for two, this place can be surprisingly awesome.  They sit small groups together at huge thick wood ikea- looking tables, which means you're sitting with strangers, but ask to be placed kitty-corner to each other, which gives you a surprising amount of privacy, ample space, and the ability to cuddle a little - after downing a few of their enormous mugs of beer. \n\nThe beer selection is great. I don't know much about German beer, but I bet many of the beers they have on draft are not widely available in SF or in the US, even. We had the Ayinger and Paulen Oktoberfest beers last night and they were smooth and really tasty. My Ayinger was even a little spicy! Last year they had hot mulled wine in the winter. \n\nThe food is unbelievably filling. The beet salad is a must-eat. Each ingredient is individually pickled or marinated and delicious eaten together. The meat dishes we got (sauerbraten and a pork special) were very tender, but I think the items that accompany your meal are the standouts - the spatzle and cooked red cabbage with the saurbraten, and sauerkraut and dumpling with the pork dish. Spatzle, for those who don't know (like me before I started going here) is a sort of boiled or baked dough like a noodle that tastes like it might also be sauteed in butter. Just wonderful.\n\nYou will leave here drunk, happy, and very well fed.", "author": "Alyssa S."}

Each boot consists of 2 Liters of fantastic, carbonated goodness.  Now don't get me wrong..... when I say this was a challenge, I wasn't referencing the quantity of liquid consumed, because I can more than hold my own in that department.  The difficult part is finishing it before it gets warm, because nobody likes warm beer. Yuckers.\n\nThe atmosphere is warm, casual and perfect for lively conversation.  The potato pancakes were clutch - crisped to perfection on the outside, soft and flavorful on the inside.

It had the feel of Europe, it is all in the details.  For example there was community seating.  Sitting next to complete strangers is definitely weird at first, but after a while I didn't even think about it.  The place is decorated with paper butterflies and dried flowers strung across the ceiling.  \n\nMy wife and I ordered the weinerschniztle, bratwurst, and goulash.  The goulash was NOT good.

They need to accompany it with a sauce or gravy.  Its a little dry.   The plus is they were willing to swap out the mash potatoes with potato pancakes.

Suckling pig and roasted duck from the Sunset for brunch, a fried chicken sandwich from Bakesale Betty's for late lunch, and a late dinner at Suppenkuche, which is, let's face it, glorified comfort food (but how very glorious...).\n\nThe restaurant is as cute as a button. Dried flowers, family-style seating (get ready to eat with total strangers), and whimsical things hanging from the ceiling abound. Service is always good, if a bit distracted. If you go for brunch, prepare yourself for some seriously orgasmic lingonberry jam. Dinner...well, no jam, but you'll fill up on the slightly bigger portions anyway. And the beer....Mein Gott.  I HIGHLY recommend the rauchbier, which is fun to order in an Eartha Kitt growl, especially if you are the type to enjoy a good applewood or hickory fire (it's smokebeer, ladies and gents). \n\nFood: everything is good. The menu is not huge, and my friends and I are gluttons, so I've pretty much tried everything there. Favorites are the jagerschnitzel, the trout with lemon butter sauce, and the veal medallions. If you think you can handle an appetizer (you can't; don't blame me if the seat of your pants burst like a comical burghermeister in a silent film) try the German ravioli. I know, I know, sounds like a bad \"fusion\" idea, but it's really just meaty, mushroomy deliciousness.\n\nThe only cons: the wait can be long and the parking difficult. Plus, the particular breed of douchebag that abounds in that area  tends to wait for their tables in the tiny bar room whilst taking up AS MUCH ROOM AS POSSIBLE with their stools and overly-groomed bodies. Honestly, folks, sit on your barstool like a normal individual -- this means no leaning back and splaying your legs out like a man who is about to be fellated or tattooed on the inner thigh -- and we can all fit into the tiny room comfortably. \n\nThankfully, reservations are available for parties of 6 or more, making Suppenkuche the perfect place for celebratory events. There's a smaller back room that is highly recommended for birthday parties an the like, so just call up, reserve the space, and set some Tylenol and a bottle of water on your nightstand for the hangover that will surely result.

After searching for a good 20 minutes, we didn't find anything so ended up valeting it (which, for $7, is not bad at all).\n\nAs soon as the rest of the gang arrived, the boys were ready for their beer...in the famous German boot. My brother and I scanned the menu for veggie-friendly food and to our luck we found something! I ended up ordering the Portobella Mushroom stuffed with Spinach and Feta Cheese served on a Pepper Sauce and a glass of red wine.\n\nWe anxiously awaited the boots that boys ordered and, when they finally arrived, cheering ensued. It was so exciting. I just kept thinking about the movie \"Beerfest.\"\n\nShortly after, our food arrived. It looked absolutely delicious. Other than my brother and myself, everyone else ordered pork chops or sausages. And everyone was definitely pleased. The food was really good.\n\nI think the highlight of the night, other than the food and the boys and their boots, was the tiny woman sitting at the table next to us who ordered the wheel barrel, which was a giant mug of beer, much larger than the famous boot. I couldn't believe she finished the entire thing.\n\nGreat food. Great company. Great times.", "author": "Jillian J."}

I've never really been a fan of sauerkraut, but at Suppenkuche it was amazing. The tanginess of the pickled cabbage paired perfectly with the sausage. The Wild Boar and Spatzle was alright - it tasted very meaty and hearty. It was my first experience with spatzle. I thought it'd be like mac&cheese, but it was more doughy and the texture reminded me a little bit of stretched out gnocchi. It didn't really have much of a taste on it's own but it was good with the meat and the sauce.\n\nMake sure you go with an appetite! Being a little thirsty doesn't hurt either - they have tons of German and Belgian beers on tap including Oktoberfest special Marzens that taste great with the food.\n\nWe showed up on a Friday evening at about 7pm with no reservation and the place was packed but we were able to get a table for two immediately. This would be a great place to grab a beer with friends, if you like loud, tightly packed places.", "author": "Cristofer P."}

It is small so you usually end up sitting with someone you just met.  Classic beer-hall style.  The decor is sparse from the bare wood tables to the unfinished hardwood floor.

I am not normally a meat eater at breakfast but base on our waitress' recommendation we both got the egg scramble with bacon, sausage, potatoes and onion and it also came with a cucumber salad.  It was sooo tasty and the portions were big enough to feed a very hungry giant.  I think each of us only made it 1/3 through the scramble.  \n\nAnyway, not only am I psyched to come back from brunch with the BF in tow (who adores all breakfast meat products) since spatzle is on the dinner menu, I cannot wait to come here for dinner -- OK, and I want to check out some of the beers on the menu.", "author": "Katie P."}

The host treated him like he was a homeless person off the street begging for scraps of wienershintzel.

I arrived at about 6:30 on Saturday night. The place was crowded. I didn't realize that German was trendy. I guess you can't blame them for that. We had a reservation for 6 people, but a few more showed up. The hostess was nice enough and brought us an extra chair and we squeezed in. \n\nThe place is so small that we could not sit anyone at one end of the table and we were pressed up against the wall and the table on the other side. The place is so loud. The walls are bare and the sound fills the room so that we had to yell to be heard by the person sitting next to us. They badly need to fix the acoustics in this place. \n\nOur waiter was nice enough when he finally managed to push his way through the crowd and took our orders. Service was less than attentive. I think our waiter was having difficulty getting back to us through the throng that was standing around the bar. \n\nMy food finally arrived. I had the Jaegerschnitzel. It wasn't like anything that I have had before. It was tough and dry. The sauce was overly thick and salty.

My cousin was craving for some German food so I did some research and found this place! Reviews don't lie! The Food was Great!\n\nTHE GOOD:\nFor the entire trip, My sister, My Cousin, and I would order different meals and try each others food. Great way to sample new restaurants. We were so Hungry by the time we got here (we literally walked from Pier 39 to here because the Cable Cars were PACKED). First off, the complimentary bread was good, but the butter was even BETTER! It had some sort of seasoning in it. It had this really unique flavor that I can't explain. Amazing. I ended up ordering the Wienerschnitzel. It was fantastic. It was lightly breaded pork that was cooked perfectly to a crisp. The presentation wasn't memorable but the food definitely was. I added a little lemon juice to the fillets and it was absolute heaven. My sister had the Grilled Pork Chop. Ohh that was amazing was well. It was a generous sized Pork Chop with appetizing grill marks served on top of some creamy mashed potatoes. OMG. Thank you to the pig who sacrificed itself to let me eat him.\n\nTHE BAD:\nMy Cousin had the Pork Medallions in Plum Red Wine. It was really good at first, but it was one of those dishes were you get tired of the flavor after a while. In my opinion the Plum Wine became a little too overwhelming that it killed the flavor. I tried their beer with the Chocolate, Caramel, and Molasses flavor. It wasn't anything exciting. I should've just gotten a boot. But the chocolate flavor in beer had me curious. Oh well. The waiter kept talking about how great the apple streudel was, but it really wasn't as great as she made it sound. The presentation made it mouth watering. It was a nice strip of apple streudel topped with Powdered Sugar and nice scoop of Vanilla Ice Cream. It was Good no doubt. But not Great.", "author": "Christian I."}

Just looking at the menu though made me very excited to see how things actually tasted.  From the start, the experience was good.  They have a nice selection of beers which is what you have to start with.  Nothing goes better with some hearty food than a nice cold beer.\n\nSo I came here with a few friends and we started with the potato pancakes and fried Camembert cheese.  Both were excellent. The Camembert was nice and crunchy on the outside and warm and melted on the inside.  It was served with a side of jam (forgot which kind) and fried parsley which went well all together.  The potato pancakes served with apple sauce were crispy but not too greasy.  I really enjoyed the sweet and savory style of both dishes.\n\nFor myself, I got the J\u00e4gerschnitzel which was awesome.  Two nice big pork cutlets sauteed over a nice mushroom sauce.   The only minus would be the Sp\u00e4tzle (for me).  I just wasn't a big fan of it.    It's probably made how it should be but it just wasn't for me.\n\nThe food is definitely hearty though so I couldn't see myself eating here more than once in every 3-4 months.  The prices are about moderate.  Not a cheap eat but not through the roof either.  I paid  $35 for a beer, sharing 2 appetizers, and an entree.", "author": "Steven H."}

Good thing a reservation was made, because it's very tight in there, and get's packed (body-to-body) by 6PM, and it opens at 5PM. The first time, we ordered potato pancakes (\"crispy-fried goodness\", a descriptive I took from a BFF Shannon, who coined it from her voice teacher down in Alabama, oh wait... maybe it was \"juicy-fried goodness\"!) which comes with a yummy bowl of apple sauce to spread over the potato cakes.\n\nThen I ordered the wienerschnitzel! Huge portion, but I ate every last morsel. Then we ordered the apple strudel, which was quite close to the strudel I had when I was in Fussen (which was back in the summer of '98, when I was SAF - Single Asian Female, backpacking around Europe before the Euro came along...). \n\nFriday we took my father-in-law, who was in SF for a conference, and we tried some new things... He ordered the skirt steak (WHOA, as Joey from Full House would say), and it was like butter. SO ordered the Bratwurst, and it also melted in your mouth and the sourkraut melted as well... And since my daughter loves chicken nuggets, I ordered the wienerschnitzel again. We had little tastes of each other's dishes.\n\nI can't wait to have another excuse to go back to the city to eat there! Oh ya, go there right at 5PM on a weekday. Seriously, or you will be waiting forever for a table... and it gets loud in there. \n\nFor those of you who have kiddos, there is a little park, just up the hill on the same block/same side of street. I think it's a community center, but they have an awesome play structure and a little merry-go-round.

I was so dang hungry that when Dave suggested German food I pretended like it was exactly what I was thinking. \"Great idea man, perfect...just what I was going to say, man no wonder we are such good friends, you and me are like two ants on a schnitzel\"\n\nI figured that the beer would rock, but I did not know what to expect from the food. I love ethnic foods (yes, Germans are an ethnic group); I'll go out of my way to try different types of cuisine but German food?...come on now...WW2 or Dachshunds have nothing to do with it. To be fair, the only things I know about Germany come from the history channel and the title of U2's seventh album, Achtung Baby!\n\nSo we walk into what feels like some ones home. It was a cold evening so the warm room, the long tables, benches and giant wreath made me feel like Christmas....not sure why, but it sure felt good. \nThe fact that you have to share tables with people you don't know is part of why I like this place so much. On the surface it seems like a minor event, but interacting with strangers makes people uncomfortable. When you choose to put yourself in this cituation your attitude changes. You act differently and you start to enjoy the contact, you become one with nature and eventually stop killing ants....\n\nMeatloaf and mashed potatoes. Get some.

We waited outside because the volume in the Suppenkuche was deafening. Once the hostess called us it was a challenge getting to our table. The entrance into Suppenkuche was blocked by 2 tables filled with people eating dinner.

This is probably why it is wonderful.\n\nSuppenkuche is one of the closest versions of a real Germany eatery I have seen in the US.  The interior is sparsely decorated, as it should be, tables are unvarnished wood of the long picnic variety and many of the tables just have long benches for seats, no chairs.  Various dried flowers hang from the ceiling and beer posters and tin signs dot the walls.  There could be a bit more dark wood on the walls (a small bar alcove in the back has that in spades though), but otherwise, very Deutch.\n\nThe food was classic Germanic fair, lots of meats, many of them encased, with various breath freshening side dishes that are heavy on onions.  The beer selection is pretty good, all of German origin of course.  No Bud Light here, just the good stuff from Heffewiezen to Dunkel.  \n\nThe service was quick and friendly and the food was simply presented.  My friend and I had the potato pancakes for an appetizer (deep friend with apple sauce) which were very good, crunchy on the outside and mashed potato-like on the inside.  We then split an order of pork sausages and venison sausages with sides of sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, and egg noodles.  The sausages were very good, not too rich but filling, and the sides were well prepared.  The sauerkraut was excellent.\n\nThe missing star is lost to the noisiness of the place.  The small, cozy setting creates a warm and folksy atmosphere (so cozy that when you walk in the door, it seems you are walking into a back corner of the restaurant, not the entrance), but also make for a loud dining experience.\n\nCertainly a great place to come with a bunch of friend though.

This place is as much a purveyor of drunken good times as it is a restaurant. So if revelry's not your thing, and if you're not into sharing large wooden tables with friendly strangers, then this place probably isn't for you. Check yer tude at the door. Needless to say, not a place for intimate conversation.

Perhaps no where else does this ring truer than the modest but cozy bar in the main room, where you can down glasses of fresh beer in comfort and merriment while you wait for a table (which could take quite a while on a Thurs-Sun).\n\nAs far as beers go, I recommend WELTENBURGER for something dark and the Franziskaner or Kolsch for something light. \n\nDinner, you say?

I've been here more than 5 times and every time I feel the same.....stuffed.  Partially due to the .5L of beer I drink before getting seated and during my meal.  \n\nIf you have yet to try this place and want to start of with something basic but oh so delicious, start with Wiener Schnitzel or the Jgerschnitzel. The Wiener Schnitzel is breaded where as the Jgerschnitzel is sauteed.  Even though the Wiener Schnitzel doesn't come with sauce, you can ask for mushroom sauce for only $1.50 more.  Also the Trout is highly recommended.\n\nFor all of you non meat or seafood eaters, tonight was my first night as a vegetarian going to the restaurant.  I thought I would have been disappointed since I ate the pork dishes many times before, but I was happily surprised with two veggie entrees and soups to choose from.\n\nI chose the Cheese Sptzle and the broccoli soup.  I was going to order the potato soup, but the kind waiter asked if I was vegetarian, which I hesitatingly said yes since it's only been 4 months since I started, and he told me there was bacon so I opted for the broccoli soup.  I would have had to return the potato soup if it had bacon, so I was happy that he warned me ahead of time.  Loved Cheese Spatzle and the soup.  Next time I am going to try Portobella Mushroom, which I am sure will taste yummy.\n\nIn regards to the bench seating with strangers, at first I thought it was awkward, but really isn't so bad.  You make small chit chat, if at all, and you get to see what your neighbor has ordered.  I am one of those people who like to see what someone else has ordered because it might persuade me to try something new.\n\nUnfortunately tonight my neighbor didn't order the Portobella Mushroom, but instead chose the Wiener Schnitzel and she ate it with a smile.\n\n4 stars out of 5 because of the wait if the restaurant is already packed.

Poor Schnitzelhaus was closed, so we headed out to Suppenkuche and we weren't disappointed.\n\nWe started with the appetizer platter...enough to feed four, but enough to make two quite giddy. The assorted meats, cheese, pickles and bread are seriously enough to get you through a happy hour with friends. I got the chicken schnitzel (bomb for me), and he got the skirt steak. We were SO not disappointed. The plates were huge enough to have leftovers for lunch the next day. \n\nI liked the communal seating, and when you're sippin' your lager, we're all friends. People here are rather friendly all around, from the staff to your new homies at the other end of the table. The noise can kill your romantic hushie hushie, but it's all good.

Nothing a little apple sauce couldn't fix, however.  Then we moved on to venison with red wine sauce and spatzle, and bratwurst with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.  Nothing remarkable about these dishes, and we felt a bit stupid forking over $13.50 for bratwurst and mashed potatoes.  Ironically, the bratwurst was better than the venison.  The venison was a bit tough and gamey, but I suppose that's expected with venison.  The beer was definitely the highlight.", "author": "JoKr M."}

To me I usually ignore the service aspect of a restaurant cause I'm going there for the food, not the wait staff, so I over look a lot of things that most would have issues with. However, this experience pushed me to my limit.  This place would have gotten a 5 star rating from me otherwise.\n\nThe food was awesome, our waiter was great, and in general we were having a blast. HOWEVER- while we were literally in the process of signing out check (literally some of our party were even putting on coats, etc), the hostess approached our table and very rudely told us that we must vacate our table immediately since the party behind us had arrived and this table was now their's. I was shocked. Now, I sympathize for every waiting table, as we have all had that annoying group that just won't finish and lags at the table. BUT I have never had someone from the restaurant come and rudely tell us to leave like that before - nor have I ever witnessed this before (even when I was the one waiting for a table for over an hour). It was not as if we were dawdling, we had just received our check and were passing pens around to sign the check. On our way out, I apologized to the people who were waiting for our table since the hostess made it seem like we had made them wait a ridiculous amount of time. The person looked at me and was obviously confused and said that there reservation for was at that moment (we had not held them up at all- the hostess kicked us from the table the second the entire party arrived). Needless to say this is when I got offended. \n\nThis event happened a few months ago, and self admittedly I'm still bitter over it. I thought I would eventually get over it, but I have found myself twice now chose to go to a different restaurant when this place is suggested, which is unfortunate because the food was good. However, in this city with great food literally on every corner it's hard to go back and support places like this, especially after being treated so poorly after spending a large amount of money (there were 9 of us at dinner).", "author": "Lacy T."}

The restaurant is located on a corner area and parking isn't too bad to find for those commuting. I've previously made a reservation (which I suggest you should, if you plan on having a party of 4 or more) but was late due to SF traffic. Fortunately when my buddies and I arrived the hostess understood our situation and was able to grab us some seats right away. My first impression was wow! This placed is totally packed for a Thursday night. It has a nice German ambiance but at the same time felt like I was in a very small restaurant having to squeeze my way into my seat because the place is literally cramped for space. We had to share a table with another group of 3! The furniture in the restaurant is definitely on the underside which looked like they bought them from Ikea but what made up for it was their beer and food. I ordered the the cured pork chop with mash potatoes and sauerkraut and a couple of the fine beers They really have a great selection of german beers and I think is the highlight of the restaurant. The pork chop was very tasteful but honestly looked like cured ham that was grilled more than anything but it did satisfy me and it lived up to my expectations. My friends order the meatloaf with bacon and eggs, the schnitzel, and the sausages platter. They too all thought it was good. We also ordered appetizers such as their pretzels which I think we're awesome and a sampler filled with sliced meats and cheese. Having never eaten german food before it definitely was a good experience. Although I didn't get to try the das boot it definitely looks like you would need to share it with another person as that thing is humongous! I wouldn't mind coming back here again but unfortunately german food isn't really my type but I'm sure this a good place to go if it is your first time or if you are a big fan.", "author": "Alvin T."}

It all started out about a month ago when my housemate returned home with one of the most delicious porkchops I have ever had. The german way of cooking a porkchop is pretty damn good. It did not matter if it was cold or right off the grill it was THAT good.\n\nSo last week we decided to make a trip up to the city and try it first hand.  We ended up arriving late no thanks to my housemates that decided to fall asleep.  It id not matter we still made it up there although it was almost 9 by time we did arrive. The place was packed and I mean packed. We entered through the curtain that hides the look of the crowd so as not to know how crowded the place really is. I enter to see a man on my left drinking from a 60oz Das Boot made famous in the movie Beer Fest.  I realy want to come back and challange my friends to a Das Boot drinking content just for kicks. \n\nWe checked with the hostess who was being asked every few minutes as to a place to sit and eat it was packed, so packed that she was not even taking names for another 20 minutes. NOt just to get a seat but would not even take our names due to the overwhelming response of people that were at suppenk\u00fcche that night.  I was not offended at all i was actually even more excited this place must be good I thought.\n\nYou can not go to a German restraunt and not enjoy the fine german beers to offer. Enjoy we did mmmmmmm they were good.  I decided to take my fair at the dobble bocks which were good. They had a few on tap and some in the botle.  I started out with a draft dobble bock which was realy good but my real treat was the dobble bock from the bottle (name of which I can not remember) that had a special process to be poured.  A pour and a swish and swivel of the bottle as this double bock is brewed in the actual bottle it was poured from, and that last little bit of yeast and beer in the bottle is the best part. Let it sit for a few minutes and enjoy. It was all the bar tender said it was going to be.\n\nWe ended up not being abel to get a table but found a nice place in the cubby near the bar which had bar style seating which honestly was perfect. ONce a large crowd that was squeezed in there left we made our selves at home with the candle list area to enjoy some good German Eats. I debated and debated on what to choose to only return to the savory porlkchop that had led me to want to experience suppenk\u00fcche for myself.  Right off the grill oh man I am about to make porkchops right now and they will be of no match to suppenk\u00fcche.  overall the food was tasty the beers were delicious and the bathroom which is always a part of the review was nothing special but was neither grand nor foul.\n\nThis place is on my list to bring my friends.  Next time i Need to remember to come a bit earlier so that we can really sit down relax.\n\nDue to being overcrowded and having to wait about 20 minutes is the only reason for not receiving 5 stars the beer was able to win me over here.

That being said, I absolutely love Suppenkuche.  This restaurant deserves all 4 Stars, aligned side-by-side with strict German precision.  German food, by nature, isn't delicate and it doesn't go to extreme measures to engineer new flavors like some high-end French or (brace yourself for the most over-used word in the history of dining) \"Fusion.\"  \n\nSuppenkuche is neither fancy nor pretentious.  It's a pretty small place and always crowded during peak hours.  You can only make reservations for a party of 6+ so make sure you do that a couple weeks in advance.  Otherwise, you're in for a 45+ minute wait for a table which for a change, isn't exactly a bad thing.  Squeeze your way up to the bar and take your pick from a dozen+ German beers on tap - the most recognizable brand being Spaten - so try something new.  Beer prices are pretty reasonable raging from roughly $5 for a pint up to $12 for a Liter.  Be forewarned though, this isn't your daddy's Miller Lite - real German beer packs a punch and you'll feel like doing the Vogeltanz (Chicken Dance) after killing a Liter Mug.  Just don't hop into a Porsche and turn up the Kraftwerk to volume level 11...\n\nYour table will be a bench (again: Hoffbrauhaus style).  Service is pretty prompt considering how busy this place can get.  Order some Potato Pancakes for the table...they are perfectly cooked and prepared every time.  If you want to get adventurous, try any one of their specialties which consist of a hearty meat served with a flavorful sauce (some fruit-based).  I prefer to order off-menu and get the Kasespatzle with a side of Bratwurst.  Make no mistake, you will not have room for desert and you will not be able to go out drinking afterward.  This is a place to go as a \"destination\" for an evening.  It will take you a couple hours and you will leave with a full stomach and slight buzz.  \n\nThe best part is Value here.  You can enjoy the full spread including beer for less than $40 per person.  Great for a group of friends....not so great if you really want to have a conversation with someone because this place is noisier than almost any other restaurant in the city.

In fact, I loved it.\n\nIt was last Friday when I got to Suppenkuche at like 8 pm. The place was packed with people, as always, whether it was outside of the restaurant or around the bar. Since it was so packed, we decided to walk around. When it was around 9-ish, the hostess came outside, apologized about the wait, and asked if we needed bread and water. I have been to much expensive places, but the hostess was one of the most sincere I have met.\n\nWhen the crowd died down a bit, we started drinking at the bar. With all other comments on yelp, there's no need for another one to point out the vast variety they offer. And the size they offer. AND the reasonable price. I have to point out how friendly and patient the bartender was on making suggestions, imagining he does that all night and every night.\n\nSo eventually, we are seated and what is more fun to sit with other strangers. Not ordinary strangers, but drunk San Franciscans, which requires no more elaboration. For food, we shared the lobster bisque and their famous potato pancake. I had their sole for main, which was a special. It came with spinach and boiled potatoes. It was citrusy, fresh, and creamy.\n\nAround that time, I saw that the hostess was about to go home.

We all sat sort of strangely in attempts to share our table, each person would have a corner seat.  It would be a great arrangement if you're all in the same group.  I heard monstrous waiting times and after coming here, despite beating the crowd on a weeknight, I can understand why.  It's a tiny space and way too popular for what it is and priced.  Had it been any other night, during peak times, thank you sir but no.  I'll go wait 45 minutes somewhere else.", "author": "A t."}

It's original and authentic from the atmosphere to the beers, German bread, and the various very hearty dishes. I can imagine the extensive beer selection draws a drinking crowd.  \n\nThe night we went, we adventured with the daily specials. Since my boyfriend is a major fan of potato gratin, he went for the skirt steak. To diversify our servings, I picked the organic hen, stuffed with dumplings, and a side of brussel sprouts. What a regret! There was more brick heavy dumpling stuffing to my hen than meat. The accompanying mashers and brussel sprouts were good, but I  still wound up picking at the pickled cucumber and tomato salad that came with the skirt steak and drewled out of envy over Eric tender cuts of meat. Oh, well, next time...With hopes it regularly appears on the daily specials menu.\nThe regular menu offers downright German comfort food: Wiener Schnitzel (breaded cutlets), spaetzle, pickled red cabbage and the like. The entrees are very generous in the range of $16-20.\n\nThe atmosphere was a couple notches too loud for my taste, which is the primary reason for the 3 stars total. Also, you are seated at dinner tables that fit 6-8 people. So, unless your party is big enough to occupy a table of its own, you will be seated with strangers. Perhaps not the best choice for an intimate/romantic dinner.", "author": "Kirsten L."}

I'm not an expert on Bavarian cuisine, but this is the third \"German\" restaurant I've been to and it is has proven itself to be the best so far. Standard fare with Schnitzels abound, and great potato/veggie/red cabbage salads as side dishes. The spaetzle is good enough to mention as well, tasty stuff.  I really dig the potato pancakes with apple sauce, you can make a meal out of those suckers on brunch days.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was the pure zeal and joviality that the staff displayed, especially while I was waiting to be seated at the bar.  The bartender walked my girlfriend and I through some brew descriptions and helped us make an informed choice.  I went with the current special, Hoffbrau Oktoberfest, which is a great medium bodied beer with a sweet bite of an aftertaste.  I'm sure you have read at some point about the 'Boots' of beer they serve here, so I won't go into it too much. If you're the last to drink from one, make sure you turn it 90 degrees at the end or face splash-back.\n\nI dig the atmosphere as well, which is usually loud and animated.  The seating is communal unless you have a large enough group to snag a whole table.  The only downside is that the place doesn't take reservations for under six people, so you need to put your name in an hour or two earlier than you intend to eat. \n\nDefinitely worth the trip, put in the time and check it out.", "author": "TJ D."}

What was fascinating was that folks of all types- hipsters, frat boys, nuevo-yuppie mom and dads and their babies, and SF old-timers were all gathered in the same German beer hall all at the same time, and often at the same tables. The noise level does make coversation a teensy bit hampered, but scoot close enough to your party and talking should be fine. \n\nMeals start off with some nice and dense bread and herbed butter (as well as some German beer from the bar while you wait). We ordered the potato pancakes (more finely shredded potatoes than latkes, but otherwise pretty similar) served with applesauce ($9). My friend ordered the meatloaf, which came with an egg secured on top and wrapped in bacon ($14.50). One of the specials of the night was suckling pig, which the waitress informed us was only served once a week and would run out by 8pm, so it made my own decision clear. The dish came with a good portion of tender pig, a huge bread dumpling, and a heap of sauerkraut ($19.50). Although we worked up quite an appetite waiting to be seated (about 30-40 minutes on a Friday night at 7pm), we were very well stuffed by the end of the night. A nice walk down Hayes will take care of the food coma you'll get at Suppenkuche.", "author": "Lydia C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-01", "description": "Started with the mixed salad.  A plate heaping and generous with lots of COLD & crunchy [well, not of course the potato salad] things to eat, served with tangy just slightly astringent dressings - it was nice to have extra salad in addition to those that came with the meals as I ate a lot of rich food and stripping down my palette and breaking things up with cold raw crunchy things from time to time enhanced my enjoyment of this amazing meal.  There were three of us and we also shared a plate of the fat well-browned potato pancakes, German ravioli, and two dinners: Wiener schnitzel and dumpling stuffed roast chicken.  I don't live in SF and don't get to visit as often as I once did so it's been awhile since I've eaten here but I am amazed that the quality of the food has remained constant, even seemed better with a bigger menu.  Maybe it's just that absence has made my heart grow fonder and fewer brain cells.  None of the meat that we had was dry.  Chicken that was not dry.  Un-dry meat, can you imagine?  The kitchen understands the importance of browning and can go well-beyond golden brown without burning things.  Gravies and sauces taste like the things they are served with, not drowning in, and are not obviously enhanced with stocks from cans, powdered granules, or things from squeezable plastic bottles.  Things are not slopped on your plate in indistinct homogenous mounds.  Fried things do not sit in nor ooze pools of oil once plated, nor do they reek or taste of stale grill grease.  Fried potatoes taste like potato and are browned to a deeply caramelized color on the outside maintaining the integrity of the potato on the inside.  Thank you for that - just that one thing is all about 5 stars.  The Wiener schnitzel wore a beautiful crumb coated jacket which had taste of its own and was perfect with the pounded-flat pork filet fitted inside.  There was really no room left for the desserts we ordered but given food quality and being with people I am crazy about required it and knowing I would not be disappointed - went off the deep end.  Gosh, someone cares about the food they make.  Things tasted so good I wanted to cry.  It was beautiful like a fireworks show.  I was irritated with myself that I had wasted an opportunity to have eaten here the night before [um, may I?  If you crave expensive-for-what-you-get institutional cooking served from warming pans - by all means have dinner at the Opera House].  There's a main dining room that's a big square with a combination of both communal and smaller tables.  There's another rear dining room separated by a narrow passage way toward one side of the building.  It's a simple un-fussy space but by no-means unappealing.  It feels as though it has a fireplace.  Ventilation is good.  I've never been to Germany nor known anyone with know-how who has cooked me German food and I don't know anything about beer, but I don't eat here because I'm looking for a German experience - I eat here because the food is so universally delicious and must necessarily be prepared by people who worship at the shrine of tasty expertly prepared food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-04", "description": "Ever since I had heard of Suppenkueche, I had been dreaming of schnitzel and spaetzle  and boots full of beer.  But I had never gone because, well, I had never really felt like my body could handle that much meat and starch without imploding and creating a black hole into which the rest of the world would be sucked.  I know, right?  You can thank me later.  But my dad was in town, and my dad is a meat and potatoes kind of man.  And my dad, the meat and potatoes kind of man, decided that he wanted to eat some meat.  And possibly also some potatoes.  And so I broke down and acquiesced to fill my body with Incredibly Tasty Things I Should Not Eat (ITTISNE).\n\nAt the advice of a friend, we arrived at Suppenkueche very early on a Friday night, and it's a good thing we did.  There was just enough space for us at one of the communal tables in back, and we wedged ourselves into the spots as best we could.  The decor is rather minimalistic, and the wood of the benches and tables isn't really even finished.  The silverware and napkins are stuffed into steins that are placed at intervals along the tables.  That, in my humble opinion, is hard core.  It says \"We don't need to worry too much about our presentation.  You're here to get completely drunk on food and booze.  You won't even remember what this place looks like when we get done with you.  Seriously, just enjoy the ride.\"\n\nAnd that assessment is really spot on.  In our hedonistic meat-starch-bingefest, we started out with the pickled herring and the German dumplings.  The dumplings were amazing - I loved the thick, chewy dumpling skin, the dense, porky-chivey filling, and the creamy mushroom sauce that was shmeared all about.  We also had the pickled herring, which came with a nice salad of all kinds of shredded, chopped veggies.  Amid all the rich food, it was the light and fresh relief my body needed.  The herring itself was also delicious, but sadly there was very little of it.  It would have been fine for one person, but with three of us sharing we each only got one bite.  The main course, for me, was cheese spaetzle.  Holy cow, I love cheese spaetzle.  and I love Suppenkueche's most of all.  The pasta was just doughy enough and just tender enough, it practically melted in my mouth.  Each piece was cradled in a mass of cheese and onion/mushroom sauce.  It was so rich, and so very worth it.  The only reason I didn't force the whole thing into my already-exploding stomach was because we decided to save some room for dessert, which was black forest cake.  I don't remember too much by that point in time, except that it was very large, very chocolatey, and contained cherries.  I remember liking this cake.  I bet by that point in the meal, you would also like such a cake.  Perhaps you would also like it even earlier in the meal.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly, though clearly very busy - that wasn't such an issue, as he was always there to offer us refills on our drinks; drinks being an important part of the Suppenkueche experience.  The downside, as a few people have mentioned, is the sound.  So.  Loud.  We were sharing our table with a large party of young folk who were kind of on the brink of screaming and, while I appreciate that's part of the fun of a German ale house, it just got a little old.

Sure, you can get the healthy veggie option - but then you're not really doing it up right, are you?  And this coming from someone who's really rather paranoid about such things.

I mean attempting to have a conversation with more than one person is well nigh impossible loud.\r\nBy the end of the meal I was exhausted, seriously, from trying to carry on a conversation.\r\nThat said, I thought the food was fairly good. My beef was OK, but my husband's venison was delicious.  I couldn't have beer, but those that did enjoyed it.

My girlfriend and I waited at the bar for a half hour before the hostess finally explained that it was \"family\" seating and that we would never have our own table. \n\nAnyway, we finally get seated. At this point the place is packed and very loud (definitely more like a beer hall). Our waitress seemed busy but attentive including when an old guy at the next table was bumping my chair with his butt. She asked him to stop.\n\nOn the positive, the beer selection is great! I had a dunkelweizen that I hadn't had since my last trip to Berlin. If you're familiar with the many beer styles of Germany you'll be pleased with all of the choices.\n\nOn the other hand, I found the food to be just OK. It seemed like a California light version of the real thing. Granted, its probably healthier than your average German fare, but I prefer the real thing.\n\nOverall, when I compare Suppen Kuche to my favorite German restaurant Walzwerk, I choose the more authentic, more cozy Walzwerk.

The food is fantastic and not for a person on a diet. The food is traditional German fair and is very good!!\n\n\nWhen you walk into Suppenkuche, it's a smaller place with a bar in the middle of the restaurant. They have tables for 6 people and if you're a party of 4, you will end up sitting with two other people as they need to fill in the wholes. I think this is a good thing, very reminiscent of a Bavarian Hofbrau house but with MUCH smaller tables. Being that it is October, we ordered a few of the Oktoberfest beers and some potato pancakes to get started. Both were KILLER!\n\nNow for dinner!! I ordered the Falscher Hase mit Zwiebelsoe und Kartoffelbrei which is basically meatloaf with an egg in the middle wrapped in bacon...that's right I said wrapped in bacon! (I think my heart just slowed a few beats remembering it) The other guys had the traditional Sauerbraten mit Preiselbeerkonfitre and Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein mit Bratkartoffeln.

For food, Suppenkuche is the most average.  4 of us went here on Christmas Eve and that was one of the few places that were opened so we gave it a try.  \n\nPositive Setting Comments: The atmosphere is nice in that they have a bar that you can stand around w/your friends while you wait and they have a lot of beer to choose from. \n\nNegative Setting Comments: Seating wise, we had to share a long table with 2 other parties of 2 so it felt a bit cramped.  Plus we were sitting right outside the door where the dishes were washed so it was alot of clattering sounds from the dieshes.\n\nPositive Food Comments: \n1) The schnitzel was very delicious.  Portion size was very generous and if you like large portions of meat, you should try this.  Schnitzelhaus and Walzwerk both have very delicious schnitzel too and they are all very good in their own way.\n\nAverage Food Comments: \n1) We also ordered the Goulash soup (special of the day), which seemed like typical beef and vegetable type of food, nothing extraordinary, nothing bad about it.\n\n2) The cold meat appetizer was good portion to share for a party of 4, maybe even 6, since the entrees are huge.  There was a variety of meats to choose from.  Caution - if you like your cold cuts more of the salty size, this dish may not be for you cuz it was a bit bland.\n\n3) Venison medallion - If you like game meat, try this.  It's hard to find venison. One complaint is that it was overcooked.  I wanted medium and it was more on the fully cooked.  It came with red cabbage and spatzel (this was not that good compared to the other 2 German restaurants I mentioned earlier).\n\n4) Sausage - Sausage is such a German thing, I would have expected something better.  This was very average.  Schnitzelhaus's was alot better.  This came with a big pile of mash potatoes.  I would probably not order this again here but it's certainly average, not bad.\n\nAfter the big entrees, we had no room for dessert.  Maybe next time.

That is not to say you cannot get some healthier options here, the Trout is very tasty. And the beer, the beer options are bountiful.

I was ready to suggest another restaurant when our German party member said this is The Place to eat real and authentic German food. Not only he was right but the environment and beer was phenomenal.\n\nFor a non-German individual, the menu can be very intimidating . However, safely I can say there is no way to go wrong. Out of the 5 main dishes we tried, ALL of them were great and not too fatty (as I was expecting). The beer selection is perfect with hard to find beers from all over Germany. The service was as good as a very crowded place will allow you. \n\nThe Bad: Waiting time, over crowded dinning room, very loud (I kinda like it like that tho)\nThe Good: everything else.", "author": "Luis G."}

If you're looking for something healthy, I would recommend running far away from Suppenkuche but if you're not too concerned than dig in! I've only come here with a big group of people but it's been a ton of fun. we've sat at a huge table and the relaxed feeling in there is great. I am personally obsesed with cheese spatzel (don't know if I spelled that right), but everything is really good here. The potato pancakes with applesauce are a great appetizer and the meat I've tasted off the plates of my friends has been delicious too. \n\nMy only word of warning is that you'll definitily be in a bit of a food coma when you leave so I wouldn't plan on going here before going to the club or something like that.", "author": "Lindsay A."}

Authenticity aside, and just eating food for food, I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here.\n\nAs many have noted, the ambiance is casual and fun. Long wooden benches and tables fill the dining areas, and beer comes in large, sometimes boot-shaped steins. Also, you order beer quantity in metric. That's hot.\n\nThe potato cakes were my favorite - deliciously crunchy and deep-fried, topped with applesauce. Yum. The venison in red wine plum sauce was the clear meat champion of the night. Hooray game meat! It was tender and the tang of the red cabbage was a nice complement. All the other dishes were solid as well, and was very pleased with the meal. Even their courtesy nod at salad was made with fresh leaves of butter lettuce and lightly dressed in a vinaigrette.\n\nNext time I find myself with a gaggle of men, I will happily come here.", "author": "Jen S."}

The salmon was cooked to perfection!  It was so moist and perfectly seasoned.  The cold cut combo was pretty great too.  There was an assortment of meats like pate, bologna, ham, and head cheese.  \n\nAs an entree I ordered the suckling pig served with beer sauce.  I was like come on!  Friggin beer sauce?

Perhaps the thing I love most about Suppenk\u00fcche is that I know when I walk out the door I will be filled to the brim with good food and good beer.  With a layout and atmosphere reminiscent of a German beer hall patrons are seated at wooden tables with strangers to maximize the number of people they are able to serve and to give people the chance to socialize.  \n\nThey serve the German classics like Gegrillte N\u00fcrnberger Bratwurst\nmit Sauerkraut und Kartoffelbrei (Grilled Pork Sausage with Sauerkraut & Mashed Potatoes) and K\u00e4sesp\u00e4tzle mit Zwiebel-Buttersoe (Cheese Sp\u00e4tzle).  My Personal favorite is the Bratwurst and Sauerkraut which is served with heavenly creamy mash-potatoes and spicy mustard.  When you mix all four together it provides for a delicious experience, and for me it is the ultimate comfort food.  Add in an impressive beer selection and good service and it is easy to see why the wait gets so long.  \n\nIn order to beat the line and a crazy wait time its best to get there just as they open and then take your time enjoying the meal.  Its the perfect spot for an early dinner on a Sunday night with family and friends.", "author": "Jessica E."}

I looked around and I spotted a little old man smiling his ass off in the corner. He was wearing a leather blazer and one of those visor beanies pulled down to his eyebrows. His face was leathery with features that remind me of the Teton mountains. He was squatting there bundled up on the bench joking with and goading everyone who would stop to listen. When his waitress stopped by he kept her there for 5 minutes laughing and flirting with her. \n\nThis was three days after Thanksgiving and I was feeling a little lonely because I did not get to see any of my family, but this squat old man made everything better. Sitting there I felt like I was at Bavarian family reunion full of laughing and smiling family.\n\nThanks Old Guy!

The food at Suppenkuche is a lot lighter than the German food that I have had in the past and I was pleasantly surprised. I love the brunch options, such as the Jgerschnitzel and the Kaiserschmarrn (type of pancake). Besides the food, I must say that the wide variety of beer has to be the high point of this restaurant. Even if you are not a beer lover (seriously, what the hell is wrong with you?) there are other drinks that I haven't seen in many places outside of Germany such as the radler, which is a combination of Sprite and beer.\n\nSo, for my third visit, I went to Suppenkuche for dinner instead of brunch. Once again, excellent food and beer. I had the Wiener Schnitzel which proportions were so big that I had to give the rest to my brother. So was it the Wiener Schnitzel or something else that had me kissing the toilet the entire night?? I wasn't the only one from my party that had problems, so I'll let you be the judge.\n\nDespite my last experience that makes me shudder when I think about it, I would still recommend this restaurant.

Reviews about sharing tables is absolutely true.  It's pretty cool because everyone tonight was friendly and it was a lot of fun.  The room is loud too but I didn't mind.  \nI started out with a Erdinger Hefeweizen.  It was a good start.  My friend's friend who lived in Germany for a few years told me that I should try Sauerbraten mit Lingonbeerkonfit\u00fcre,\nserviert mit Rotkohl und Sp\u00e4tzle.  (I just copied and pasted it from their menu.)  It was marinated beef with a lingonberry sauce in a small dish on the side, with a red cabbage that was pickled and spatzle (I thought it was some kind of pasta.)  I destroyed that meal.  Very hearty and delicious.  First time.  It was a great combination of foods served together.  The bread is good, only with the spread you put on it.  After dinner I had a Edelweiss (a suggestion from another friend- he said close my eyes and think about the mountains in the Sound of Music!).  I liked the Edelweiss better than the Erdinger.  My friend had a beer in the boot.  He just barely finished it and that was the small boot.  There is a big boot but we passed on that.

The prices weren't bad with the average price of a .5L glass around $6. For an appetizer we ordered the Potato Pancakes with Homemade Apple Sauce and it was amazing. The pancakes were big and crispy and the apple sauce was so good that I wanted to order more! \n\nThe bacon wrapped meatloaf is orgasmic. No, really, I'm not kidding. It is THAT good. My boyfriend ordered it so I only got to have a few bites (boo!), but it had me wishing I could trade dinners with him the ENTIRE meal! I ordered the sauerkraut and pork sausage which was good but a little underwhelming compared to the meatloaf.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-07", "description": "Having never been here before, nor having gone to a German restaurant, I wasn't quite sure what i was getting in to. Nestled in a not so great area of Hayes Valley, we nearly walked passed the little place in search of it.\n      As my girlfriend and I walked in through the monstrous  wooden door, and through the leather curtains, we were taken aback by how on a Monday evening, this place was crazier, wilder, and full of more spirit then most places are on peak hours on a Saturday. \n       The ambiance of this place is quite unusual, though, the word unusual seems to fit this place perfectly. There's hanging artwork of sparrows on the ceiling, a neat little coat rack in the corner for your big winter jackets, very simple, what seemed to be sponge painted trees around a plain white background. The place being so small, amplifies the noise level to a point that hearing a baby scream is something of a whisper. Walking in to this vibe, i was almost certain i'd be turned away or at the very least be forced to wait about an hour. The sweet hostess took the two of us right away to a kindergarten styled lunch bench where 3 other people were already sitting. This was unsettling at first, seeing as how i wasn't quite ready for it, but upon sitting down, realized, this is most likely how sitting down somewhere in Munich would feel (bring on the haterade). I was instantly welcomed by a birthday boy and his friends where they made us feel part of the party. This though was seemingly going on at every single table! Families, couples, businessmen, all sitting down with boots, liters, or steins of delicious high quality beer.\n        Upon looking at the drink menu, it's no surprise that there was not one person having wine, or mixed drinks. With around 15 German beers ranging from regulars like Spatten, to rare Belgian styled Tripple IPA's that i can't even pronounce on tap, it's almost a sin to not have one. This little nook is a place where you can find young and old alike, and even the occasional cute little brunette or blonde, drinking the same styled beers. Winning.\n       The waitress took my order and so went my adventure. how does the saying go, \"When in Germany, do as the Germans do\"????\n       As we ordered our food, we were given nothing but pleasant and intricat help in choosing a dish from the waitress. She spent what seemed to be very rare time for her since it was so busy, explaining to us Noobs (For all you computer nerds up in here) what dishes were must tries.\n       Our dishes came out in timely fashion. I had ordered the grilled Venison (i was feeling adventurous) with a plum sauce, stroganoff, and a candy flavored purple cabbage. My girlfriend ordered the chicken sausages with peas and pancake potatoes.  All i can say is wow. This was cooking surely made by the German Grandmother i never had. It was some of the best food i'd EVER had (and judging from my growing gut, that's a lot). My meat was tender, juicy, and not in the least bit gamey, which i've learned is now an insult to that style of meat. Her sausages were exploding with flavor (that's what she said), and for chicken, that's hard to do. Our veggies were delicious and our starches were right up there as well. \n       If you are up for an excellent beer this place is for you. If you want a high quality meal cooked to perfection, this is for you, if you want to go to a place where the service is spectacular this is for you. If you're looking for a place to take a first date, a place that's quiet and uptight, and you hate meeting new people, this is NOT for you.", "author": "Logan M."}

I just griped about Speisekammer, so I am going to make myself feel better by extolling the copious virtues of Suppenkuche.\n\nOh Suppenkuche. How do I love thee? The only thing I don't love about thee is the fact that I always have to wait forever. Damn you for being so popular because you are so excellent! Tip: bring a book or a really interesting group of people. Or come on, like, Tuesday when all of San Francisco isn't beating down the door.\n\nI'm not big on beer, but The Boot is a hilarious and brilliant group beverage. Make sure you're up on your Herpes exams, folks. Or at least taking Lysine! Seriously, though, there is quite the extensive selection of potables, beer or otherwise. My personal fave is the Gewurztraminer wine.\n\nI have eaten both the pork sausage with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut and the sauteed trout. Spot on. The sausage was nicely cooked, and the sauerkraut was tart and delicious. The trout was among the best I've ever had, and the lemon butter sauce was just lovely, and neither too buttery or too lemony. Wonderful balance. \n\nI love the decor as well. There are usually interesting things hanging from the ceiling, like paper butterflies or autumn wreaths, depending on the season. I have yet to experience Oktoberfest there, but I'll bet it woulk be fun. Hooray for Suppenkuche!", "author": "Mea H."}

And then just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, you go and pull a stunt like this ... AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF!!  And thus The Good Grub presents to you ... Suppenk\u00fcche, the \u00fcber-sophisticated, dimly lit, German gastro-pub, dishing out steins of German lager and plates loaded with sp\u00e4tzle ... side note, the double dots over the \"a\" stand for \"sweet-lederhosen! this is the freakin' food of the gods.\"  This was our second journey to this magical place thanks to our Grub-guide Grant M. and both times, as soon as we stepped inside, we were instantly hit with the sensory overload of elbow-to-elbow beer laden Grub-mates, a constant buzz of noisy excitement, and an energy threatening to break out into an all-out Oktoberfest at any moment.  And don't come unprepared, because Suppenk\u00fcche packs its bar with some serious brews on tap.  We played it safe and got a liter stein of our personal favorite, the Franziskaner Hefe-Weisse ... ahhh, just like our Great Uncle Franziskaner used to make back on the farm.  There aren't many things better than a nice big gulp from one of those beveled-steins-filled-o-golden-glory.  That is until you catch sight of the five liter stein up on the shelf... no typo my friend, five liters!?  It's so big I feel like it needs one of those warning labels you see on the side of buckets that read \"Caution! Baby could suffocate if unsupervised\"  ... but I want it ... badly.  One day it will be mine ... oh yes, it will be mine.  But for now I'll stick with my liter and focus on the amazing plate of sauteed pork tenderloin paired up with a side of sp\u00e4tzel, which is how German's do pasta ... if pasta was a plate of rich and creamy egg noodles, perfectly designed to soak up the beer about to enter your belly.  They've also got some veggie options which will change your view on all those \"shouldn't-we-just-force-them-to-live-by-themselves-on-an-island\" non-meat eaters.  Our veggie-mate went for the \"Champignon gef\u00fcllt mit Spinat und Schafsk\u00e4se auf Paprikaso\u00dfe\" ... and to save you about 3 years of German language lessons ... it's a portobello mushroom stuffed with spinach and feta ... then stuffed with love .... then covered in a rich, but not overpowering, red pepper sauce.  Finish it all up with a tiny vile of Underberg ... aka an after dinner alcohol that will definitely put some hair on your chest ... in a good way I think.  So grab a few Grub-buddies, prep yourself for a night of malty-goodness and German-delight, and check out Suppenk\u00fcche ... as Good as Grub gets.", "author": "Jeff B."}

We had a long-ass wait for a Wednesday night, and because of a little seating mix-up, our host comped one of our appetizers -- yummy potato pancakes with a nasty but avoidable applesauce dressing.  Everything tastes better when it's free.  \n\nThen, fried Camembert, a distant  and overpriced relative of that old Denny's favorite, the mozzarella stick.  Probably wouldn't order that one again.\n\nWe split some venison because I'd never had it before, and it was... fine.  Meaty.  Felt like something I'd crave if I were pregnant.  It came with a dessert-like cabbage side that complimented the game nicely.

So, the Saleslady and myself put our soggy brains together to find a quick meal. Most people would think the scallops, oysters and cheese would have been enough, but we need something hearty, savory. We needed some CARNE.  Ahhh Suppenkuche...thank you for your meat and potatoes.\n\nWe roll into  the wooden door on the corner of the building and are told that we could share a table with another party if we didn't mind. Belligerence was eminent if we didn't eat something of substance soon so we sat with a group of wonderful Latin ladies right next to the bar.\n\nThis place has an awesome selection of beers if you are into good beer. My absolute favorite is a German Triple Bock call Aventinus. A sweet rich wheat beer from Germany that packs 8-9% golden elixir in it.\n\nFirst thing is first we get a couple of cold beers and check the menu. The Saleslady starts chatting up the Latin ladies and we soon find out that one is the owner's wife and one is her Mommy. This is good.  The owner comes over and chats with us for a sec and I tell him how I had my graduation dinner here blah blah blah. Don't quite remember if he sent us a beer or not.\n\nSo, we order the Bratwurst which comes with potato pancake and sauerkraut. The Brat is salty and got hints of nutmeg and cinnamon. With a dollop of the whole seed mustard each bite is fantastic. The gooey in the middle crunchy on the outside potato pancakes are perfectly salty.  I've had these at other restaurants, but none compare to those made here. Sauerkraut is really not one of my fav things to eat, so no comment on it, but I hear its good.\n\nSo the with FULL bellies and alcohol coursing through our veins we venture in to the streets of Hayes valley.  I can't really remember if we went out after wards or not, but I know we had a memorable food tour.\n\nService is quick the scene is loud at this casual restaurant with wood table and wood benches. The food is hearty and savory, the beers are great. Its the kind of place I could go with the boys and eat and drink all night.\n\nThree restraunts in one night was a pretty cool experience.

Not that I don't like beer, because I'm not that kind of girl... but I was concerned about the food, because I've never been to a restaurant that serves only German food outside of Germany.  My mistake - I've been missing out!\n\nSo, I just moved to town, and when I tell people I'm in Hayes Valley, the first thing out of their mouth has commonly been \"Have you been to Suppenkuche yet?\"  Last night I finally went, and it really was as good as everyone said it was.  Potato pancakes - I need more of these in my life.  The beer was delicious, and my friends got boar sausage - great - and the weinerschnitzel - best I've had in the U.S.  I got the goulash, which could have been spicier, but still was pretty solid.\n\nFinal word: Go to Suppenkuche - the wait is worth it!", "author": "Rebecca S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-10-06", "description": "Caveat emptor!\n\nHm, I used to have fond memories of Suppenkuche - until last night. I lived in Germany for three years, so when it comes to knowing what authentic German cuisine tastes like, I'd say I have a pretty darned good baseline to compare against. What I experienced last night was disappointing.\n\nWhen I first discovered this place some years back with friends, I loved it, and the food was great. But last night, I found the food to be not only subpar and mediocre, but I simply didn't enjoy the atmosphere of the place at all. \n\nThe hostess seemed more interested in jamming people in at the bar to sell beer, with the subtle threat that if you leave the restaurant (where there was hardly room to stand) they may not hold your table. What a bunch of crap. So we stood at the bar, ordered a beer (which was damned good), and then were consistently bumped in the arms and back by servers and people trying to squeeze through the crowded bar. I wondered to myself if this kind of crowding was actually exceeding the capacity limit set by the fire marshall...\n\nWhen we did get seated, we were totally fine with the table-sharing; that's cool, no problem at all there. Most people around us seemed to be having a good time (thank the beer), so the mood was good. We ordered, samped the over-dry bread and bland spread, and waited for food. And waited. And waited. When it finally arrived, the server SPILLED some food on me when somebody bumped his arm... why? BECAUSE IT'S TOO CROWDED. I can't stress it enough.\n\nDuring the entire dinner, my SO and I were constantly bumped by servers and people being seated or trying to get to the bar or out of the restaurant. It sucked ass, and made the experience completely unenjoyable. I'm in a freakin' restaurant trying to eat food, not at Oktoberfest trying to squeeze my way to the bar!\n\nThe food was uninspired. The Jaegerschnitzel was just ok, but really didn't match up to expectations. The flavors were muted, and we both agreed that they'd probably pre-prepared it during the day and then reheated it for service. The porkloin I had was a thick slab of meat, and I'd have been impressed if it didn't taste oversalted and bland... I think that must also have been pre-prepared during the day and heated up for service. On the plus side, the Sauerkraut was really good.\n\nPrice-wise, for the quality of what we got, it was way too much - entrees averaged about $16-18, which we both agreed was about $5-6 too much per dish for the quality of the food we got. The quantity was great, but the quality was just not worth that much.\n\nI guess if you have no sense of what real German food is and don't care about paying too much for bland food in an overcrowded environment where you can hardly hear the person sitting right next to you, this is the place for you. But if you want solid German food that tastes great, is reasonbly priced, customers aren't jammed in like sardines and you can have a conversation at normal speaking level, then go check out Waltzwerk down on South Van Ness - overall that place offers an extraordinarily better value than Suppenkuche, which IMHO has lost everything that I used to like about it.\n\nMy recommendation, skip this place. You're being jipped and paying for a faded reputation this place no longer deserves.", "author": "Gregg G."}

It was probably 3rd July, and this place was open. Fabulous! (unlike another German restaurant that chose not to open that day..hmph but anyways..)\n\nThe restaurant was pretty crowded, and a lot was going on inside. We waited probably about half hour to get a seat, but in the mean time we settled down in the bar area and ordered some bier (obviously). Can't go wrong with bier, especially German bier.. but I'm slightly biased on that. What others mentioned about shared tables is true, although we didn't really share a table. We sat behind the bar at the countertop areas, so it wasn't really \"shared\" per se. \n\nNow I know German people tend to eat a lot of pork, and I'm not a big pork fan myself but I always seem to make an exception when it comes to German food. I ordered the bratwurst while my bf ordered the schnitzel. Both were quite yummy.. Again I tend to be a fan of the German sausage and beer...\n\nI'd say the only downside was that it was kind of dark in the room.. mainly candles if I recall. Also it was kind of hard to get some service. We had to go up to the bar to order our food. Maybe it's the norm but I wasn't used to doing so. Pricewise, I'd say the schnitzel for 16.5$ is ok, but sausage for 13.5$? Maybe I should have ordered a schnitzel too. You can get curry wurst off an imbiss for 2 Euros.

The restaurant is super crouded and very loud and definately not a place to have a quiet drink or a quiet anything.\nWe got seated after 30 minutes and had to pretty much scream to make conversation. Authentic so far :-)\nThen we ordered the starters. Onion soup (Zwiebelsuppe) for my friend and potato pancakes with apple sauce (Reibekuchen) for me.\nHUGE protions for under 10$ each. Wow. We were both pretty much stuffed after our great tasting appetisers. The pancakes were only lukewarm but super crispy and delicious and the onion soup was a concoction of rich, hearty awesomeness.\nThen the main course. My friend ordered the \"spaetzle\" (gnocci like cheesy pasta) and I had the meatloaf (falscher hase). Both was very satisfying and plentiful. I recommend to share a starter and maybe even a maindish between two people. Its loads.\nThen the absolute highlight of the evening. The black forest gateau (schwarzwaelder kirsch torte). Wow. Thats pretty much as good as my Mom makes it. Creamy, light tasting, chocolate-cherry magic. Definately a must try. Save room!\nOverall we got a lot of food at a very reasonable price. An enjoyable experience! And pretty authentic too.\nTwo thumbs up!", "author": "Sandra T."}

Most of the time we come to SK, we reserve a table ahead of time for ten in the back room (otherwise you need to put your name down and wait 1-2 hours).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-09", "description": "In a region with an above-average number of good-quality German restaurants that aren't hofbrau houses, Suppenkuche is a good choice for anyone wishing to indulge in Bavarian-style German food (i.e. bratkartoffeln, schnitzel,, etc.).  Having grown up with a German immigrant mother, it's a surprise we didn't go to this place when it first opened.\n\nSunday brunch is the best value for most of Suppenkuche's menu items (and is my preferred time to go, just out of a hesitation for paying SF prices for what is essentially homestyle food in Bavaria).  One can munch on the brotchen (bread rolls) with jam and butter while waiting for the meal.  If you're really adventurous, try the Grosse fruhstuck (big breakfast) with German coldcuts and a softboiled egg.  Other favorites are the farmer's breakfast, schnitzel, and lieberkase (which occasionally gets overcooked by the kitchen).  If beer at 10 am isn't your thing, wash things down with a apfelsaft schorle (apple juice mixed with sparking water).\n\nI can't speak for dinner, but if you're planning on coming for Sunday brunch, arrive early, as the tables tend to fill up around 11.

I don't think I can say that about any other place.\n\nWhen I was 16, I spent a year in Germany (Dresden, to be exact). The year was great, but the food left me a little cold. It was heavy, traditional, the kind of thing you'd eat dutifully at your grandmother's but never something I'd have paid to experience. \n\nOne decade later, we moved to the Bay Area and I was gradually led to Suppenkuche. I had low expectations. But the vibe when I walked in was different--hip, exciting, comfortable, all at the same time. Definitely not your grandmother's restaurant...or was it? All around, people were downing bottles of Underberg, which my German host-grandmother swore by as an after-dinner stomach soother. Hmm...\n\nI'll cut to the chase. The food is fantastic, but the vibe and the beer list contribute considerably. It is not unlike going to a beer tent at a festival--people sharing tables convivially, lots of parties and drinking out of enormous boot-shaped beer glasses, and great plates of warm comfort food.\n\nBecause I'm a creature of habit and don't make it up there, I usually order the same thing: Kassler (a cured pork chop that tastes more like ham--comes with a side of real German mustard) with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut (except that I always ask for red cabbage instead). I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Another winner is the Jaegerschnitzel (schnitzel covered with mushroom sauce) with spaetzle (little South German egg noodles) and a side salad. \n\nWash these down with a Koelsch, or a glass of Weizen, or, if you're girly, a Radler (half beer, half Sprite) or a Berliner Weisse mit Waldmeister. You will not make it to dessert.", "author": "Katie B."}

This helps one feel a little bit less like a sardine, because it's PACKED in there.  The vibe of the staff and customers was so pleasant that that didn't bother me at all.\n\nApparently, drinking 2 liters of beer from a glass boot is the thing to do if you're in college.

Though, weirdly, I have never had a problem with seating (mostly had reservations but even walked in with my dad once and we got a seat within a few minutes).

I don't even choose my beer for myself--I just tell the waiter to bring something good and it has always been excellent.\n\nIt's not really what I would consider a date place, but really is the perfect spot for a big group dinner.

I believe this was a special for the night, but the three lamb chops were cooked nicely and topped with a big ole' slice of truffle butter (YES) and sides of mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. The lamb + butter combo was sooooo good. The rest of my butter melted on the plate and I def used it as a sauce for my veggies and potatoes...best decision ever.\n- Apple strudel- The only complaint I had was that it would've been better if they had heated up the strudel.

WITH BACON.  and thick pieces too.  how amazing to eat these three together.  absolutely perfect.  i licked the plate.  i believe i was hungry.\n\ni went to three twins for dessert and bought a pint of lemon cookie.  i know that has nothing to do with the restaurant, but i advise you to do this, considering that it is the perfect finish to a meal here.", "author": "Robert S."}

The concept of \"soup kitchen\" (translating the name from German) is evident in such touches as wooden communal tables and simple menus. The wall and ceiling decor is something else, though, and has to be experienced for yourself.\n\nEvery time I've been to Suppenk\u00fcche, it's been busy, even on a Monday night. Keep that in mind if you are aiming to bring your posse for some Weihenstephaner Hefeweissebier and schnitzel. There's a little alcove off the bar area that can be handy for 2-3 people to eat in or just wait for a table while drinking some Korbinian.\n\nThe beer menu covers all the German styles, from Hefeweizen to M\u00e4rzen to bocks (with the exception of, perhaps, Roggenbier, but then that one is pretty rare). Last time I had a good H\u00f6fbrau Helles and my dining companion, Melanie N., opted for Mahr's Weiss Bock, which was delicious, if a bit yeasty. As much as I enjoy German beer, I can't necessarily say the same about German food. I mean, most of it is meat and potatoes and cabbage - or sp\u00e4tzle, I guess - in various permutations. Great, if that's what you're after, and perhaps my experience is limited, but I haven't had any adventurous or fusion styles in German restaurants here. Suppenk\u00fcche doesn't help in that regard. While its standbys like schnitzel (both pork and veal) are decent, the potato pancakes we got last time were terribly overfried, for example. All in all, I won't hesitate to come back here as a part of a group dinner, but it's not about to be my regular dining place.", "author": "Andrei Z."}

Thankfully a coworker from Germany turned me on to this place a few years ago. She said it was the best she'd had outside of home. I couldn't agree more. The food is beyond delicious and the assortments of German brews to accompany the meal is equally as good. The understated location can be a bit difficult to find, but its all fun and delicious food on the inside.

My questions were about the menu and the beer. The place was over half way full but was extremely loud.  The servings were plentiful. The beer was typical German temperature. One person who was patrolled the dining area kept asking if I had anything he could take away. I was barely halfway thru my meal and he kept coming back and looking at our table. Go take a coffee or beer break for Pete's sake. I had to waive the waitress down to get another beer. When we did finish our meal our check came as if to say get out.

The idea is people are mixed up in tables with different customers, which really makes it easy for the atmosphere to get crazy soon. I'm just sorry for the dating couple which had to sit at our tables for a while...I do not really believe this is the right spot for dates, although so many people seem to do it.\n\nI really suggest to try their bottled beers, which are almost impossible to find outside Germany and are really great. If you also strive to brew your own bottled beer like Germans do  (which I still don't really get...) you're on board.\nMy favourite ones are the Augustiner and the Weihenstephaner Dunkel. Please refrain from ordering Belgian beers - everyone will shout at you. \n\nAs for food, everything was amazing. We first shared their big Vesperplatte, full of various meats (including the blood sausage) and cheeses. Have it with that gorgeous dark bread and you'll feel happy like Heidi up on her mountains (although she was Swiss, anyway...). I then got the Jaegerschnitzel with Mushrooms: the mushroom sauce was really delicate and savory at the same time, and the spaetzle tasted the way only great German grandmas can prepare. The other three friends I was with tried different plates, like the Wiener Schnitzel, the Rehmedaillons and the Grill meat: everyone was supersatisfied.\n\nIn the end we had no more space for any dessert, especially after we each drank five among bottles and pints... good excuse to go back!", "author": "france d."}

Believe me, I'm not a beer drinker at all, but this place has really good beer on tap.  I have no idea what I was drinking and felt silly trying to say their names, but everything was really flavorful and smooth.  My favorite was their mixed beer.  It's either a light or dark beer mixed with lemon soda.  Diagnosis: Delicious.  Also, they have a large assortment of glass sizes, including small 0.2L for lightweights like me.  We were lucky to be around when they had their Oktoberfest brews, which were no doubt tasty.  But the thing that really attracted me to this place was Das Boot.  I think I'm going to have to build my tolerance first before i can attempt to conquer this 2L mammoth.\n\nAs for the food, everything was very rich and heavy.  I gave this place 4 stars only because I've never really had german food and I have no other references to how it's suppose to taste.  However, my boyfriend said that it's the best german food he's tasted thus far, and I trust him, he's a foodie and a cook.  There wasn't anything that I didn't like.  Well maybe the liver from the appetizer plate, but I don't like liver to start with.  I even liked their apple sauce, and I don't generally like apple sauce.\n\nIt's a good place to people watch, too.  Everyone's having fun.  Beware, this isn't a place to take someone on a first date.  It can be cramped and very loud.  It kind of reminded me of vegas clubs, with the restaurant dimly lit with candles and the bar crowded.

I had the cheese spatzle with cream sauce and my mom had the salmon filet with mashed potatoes and salad. To wash it down we ordered a Franziskaner beer which was very refreshing and tasty. The food was sooo good!! And yes it did get crowded really fast but c'mon people..its SAN FRANCISCO! Every good hot spot in the city is crowded. GO THERE!

Your options are to stand outside or wander around Hayes Valley and find a bar, which is what we did.)  And it was totally worth it.  The food was FANTASTIC.  They had fresh pretzels served with this delicious, soft buttery cheese, which we named \"butter cheese\".  Brilliant, I know.  I had the cheese spaetzle.  It was very good and the portion was big.  The beer selection was also really good.  I had a belgian beer that was quite tasty.  Minus one star for the service.  It kind of felt like after taking our orders, our server was MIA.

Also I would not suggest coming with less than 3 or 4 other people. The waiters/waitresses do not seem to care much for you unless you are with a large party of people and are interested in drinking copious amounts of beer.\n Such has been my experience. If you want to get drunk and eat some decent German food, and have at least 4 people with you, this is the place.

The food was excellent, I think the best Sauerbraten I've ever had. While we waited for a table, the bartender was super friendly and chatty. It was a Thursday night, and the place was absolutely packed. The only slight negative was that the service at the table was so-so, and there was a feeling of disinterest on the part of some of the waitstaff. The place was busy. I thought the service and set up (fish for your own utensils out of a mug in the middle of the table) could be a little fancier. Overall, the food and the beer wins out and it is a place worth going to. Did I say that the Spaetzle is super delicious too!?", "author": "Kerry K."}

The potato pancakes are an excellent starting choice.  The second, third, and (unfortunately) final time I came here was for boots of beer.  If you want to drink your beer out of a 2 liter boot the bartender will happily oblige you...but dont expect any service or consideration from the hostess or the waitt staff...\nthe first couple of times my friends and I cane here for boots we were a small group and sat at the bar with no problems.  The last time there were 5 of us looking for a night of drinking and appetizers.  When we arrived we were missing 2 people...i told the hostess we were here for drinks and apps and we wanted a table but were missing a few.  she asked us to wait.  so three of us ordered 4 boots of beer (about $90 worth of drinks) and found 5 seats at the bar.  when our additional guests arrived we sat for a few minutes then moved to the table, and ordered 1 more boot and 2 orders off potato pancakes.  we got our table about 550, 6 oclock, so the bar filled up while we waited for our appetizers.  When they came the waitress asked us what else we would like and we said nothing for now.  She was not happy with this and immediately let us know that we would have to vacate the table when we were done eating our apps...what?  we just spent over $100...and no one told us we had to order entrees to sit down when we came in or when they sat us.  \nI got up and went over to the bar...1 seat left.  I talked to the hostess and she said sorry but there wasnt anything she could do.  She wouldnt let us talk to a manager and apparently it was the sole discretion of the waitress to let us sit or make us go....\nNormally we would just finish the current beer we each had and leave but we had 4 glasses of 2 liter beer on the table (over 4 beers each)...and to make things worse, we had to put a $50 deposit down for each boot glass (in case it gets broken).  so now we are supposed to go stand at the bar and drink these massive glasses that we have $200 wrapped up in...\nWhen I pointed this out to the hostess she simply said sorry and walked away.  Luckily there were 2 guys at the bar who saw/heard this whole thing and vacated their seats.  The 5 of us spent the next hour polishing off 4 boots in 3 seats in the very crowded bar area.\n\nLike I said I used to love this place but after the way i was treated I will never go back again.", "author": "Kelesa S."}

Enough said about the food let's move on to their customer service part. \nMy family and I just got back from Germany and were craving German food and beers that come with US customer service. You know what I mean by US customer service if you ever been to Europe.  We got there about 30 minutes before they opened and were second in line. By the time they opened there were at least 40 people by their door. Once we got in, we found out that they are not going to sit us since we are missing one person and they consider this party \"incomplete\".  Conversation with their staff did not start on the good note either. Waitress was disgustingly arrogant from the get go.  When she was talking to me it seemed that she was doing me a favor rather than doing her job. It did not take long for her to start yelling at us which was completely unacceptable. We had no other choice but get up and leave. I have spent most of my life in Bay Area and I have never been treated in such an awful manner at any restaurant. \nIn my mind, something like this would never happen if:\n1) They would pick up the phone\n2) They would sit people with reservations first and then people who waited in line (based on who was in line first) \n3) Expand their premises to more than 7-8 tables where they tend to pack people like sardines\n\nTo summarize, I have been extremely disappointed with the way we were treated and if I would have an option to give this place negative 5 stars I would.

Some were great experience, and some were terrible.\n\nThe definite pros:\nCHEAP BEER. (I think they only have german selections)  \nDelicious beer cocktails.\nYummy appetizers.\n\nThe definite cons:\nYou can't make a reservation unless you have a party of 6 or more.\nSmall dining area, which translates to ridiculous wait time if you go on a crowded night.\nThere are almost no small tables.  You'll be forced to share a table with another party if you have 2 or 3 people.  A definite problem if you would like some privacy with your date.\n\nPersonal Opinion:\n\nUpon walking in, you're greeted with a rather run-down decor and dim lighting.  Along with the beige wood table, they convey the atmosphere of a cottage.   This place is probably better for a group night out rather than a romantic dinner.\n\nWell, my last experience at Suppenkuche was so bad that it forced me to create a yelp account and write a review.\n\n1. The Service.\nI love the potato pancakes with apple sauce and that's the one thing I keep going back there for.  Unfortunately, my friend wasn't that hungry that night so we decided to just order entrees.   However, I had a change of heart and told the waitor I would still like to get the appetizer regardless.  The waitor then questioned me, \"Are you sure you want the appetizer?  The meal portion is rather huge!  The couple sitting across from you only shared an appetizer and an entree and they are stuffed.\"  To which I reply, \"Yes.  I'm a big eater.\"  He said that he thought it was going to be too much for us.  I had to reiterate my choice before he went away unwillingly to put our order in.   I do not understand why I almost had to argue to get my food.  Even more ridiculous was that the waitor came back after he put the order in and said \"don't blame me if you guys explode later.\"    Okay, seriously, was that necesary?\n\nOh, another waitor took my beer glass away without even bothering to ask me if I would like another beer after I finished my first glass.  (which I was going to say \"yes, of course\")\n\nDuring the whole course of meal, our waitor didn't bother to come back to our table and asked if we needed anything (some water would have been nice). \n\nWhen we finished our meal (by the way, we cleaned the plates - not because it was great, but because we were hungry), we asked for the check, and he then sat down by the table next to us and started talking to another couple for at least 5 minutes, none of which was meal related - just plain chit-chat, before he went to the cashier and gave us the check.  \n\nUnacceptable.\n\n\n2.  The Food.\nDon't be fooled by the name of restaurant.  This place offers very limited selection of soup.\n\nI took a look at the special menu, and decided I would break the norm and try the cornish game hen with stuffed bread dumpling.   \n\nit was an utter disaster.  The chicken lacked flavor and was extremely dry.  The stuffing was also extremely sticky and dry, which made it really hard to swallow.  The vegetables served on the side tasted rather bitter to my liking. I'm not sure if I just got an overcooked hen or that's how they normally serve it.  I'd definitely recommend you not to get this dish.\n\nWith all these negative things said, I did have pleasant experience from this place before.\n\nAs I mentioned, the potato pancakes with apple sauce is to DIE FOR.\n(A bit on the greasy side, but I am a big sucker for fried food)\nSauteed Porkloin in Mushroom Sauce served with Spatzle and Green Salad is a rather enjoyable plate.  It doesn't look fancy, but it tastes great like a good home-made dinner.\n\n\n\nOh, they don't speak a word of German, so don't bother trying to order in German like my friend did.", "author": "Danny W."}

There are many reviews complaining about the waiting time for a table, arrive early and you're all set.\r\n\r\nWe had a really big beer, and mimosa with fresh grapefruit juice which was quite nice.  \r\n\r\nFor brunch it was the meat loaf with fried egg and potatoes, and the ravioli with scrambled eggs and cucumber salad.  Good stuff!  I imagine everything on this menu is really good as you can't go wrong with German food.  Schnitzel, potatoes, kraut. . .those are always culinary pleasers.\r\n\r\nI especially like the ambiance in this place and imagine for dinner it could be very cozy.  Group tables make for an interesting meal.  You never know who you'll be seated with. . .fun!\r\n\r\nThe last time I ate here was about nine years ago and it's still just as good!\r\n\r\nIf you're on a healthy eating regimen I say take a meal off and hit up Suppenkuche!  \r\n\r\nGute Zeiten!", "author": "James M."}

I had the Maultaschen and the Jaegerschnitzel but I could taste the underlying 'american' out of the ingredients and Ja, I was disappointed. \n\nSicherlich besser als manch anderer am Ort, aber ich habe auch schon an Deutschen Autobahnraststaetten leckerer gegessen. Nicht unbedingt empfehlenswert.\n\nupdate:\n----------\nJust went there again against better judgement and the food sucked again. This time I had the venison medallions and instead of juicy and flavorful I got two BURNT pieces of flavorless meat I could not tell what kind animal it was from. The red cabbage and the Spaetzle were okay but I'm still kind of shocked what they thing passes for venison medaillions. On top of that and what I forgot to point out the other time I wrote the review is you're going to be sitting at the table with strangers if you're less than a party of four and the place is EXTREMELY loud when it fills up.\n\nWerte Mit-Deutsche:\n\nMal wieder sehr entaeuscht, diesmal war das Essen verbrannt und bei der Schwarzwaelder Kirschtorte wurde dermassen mit der Sahne gegeizt, das ganze ist schon eine ganz schoene Frechheit, Ich nehm mal an die haben eben einen Amerikaner als Koch.

I can tell you it's more accurately named Bavarian Cuisine, but you'll have to read about its history on their website at www.suppenkuche.com because this Chinese dude would not do justice to its beginnings. Back to the brats. Jay had a plate of them served with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. This traditional German sausage speaks for itself. Screw your wimpy Oscar Maeyer wieners filled with pigs toes and horse hooves, this is a man's sausage with real meat that's big on taste. As for myself, I had the Sauteed Porkloin in a Mushroom Sauce served with Spatzle & Green Salad. I assumed the mushroom sauce would function to make up for a dry porkloin, but to my surprise it could've been served on its own without the sauce. The pork was not only moist and juicy, but the flavor just left you speechless. I say speechless because after the first bite I kept stuffing my fat face, and was reduced to mumbles and grumbles of affection for the fare. The mouthwatering flavor of the sauce with its variety of mushrooms in a German red reduction made for more pangs of enjoyment. On the side there was Spatzle which is a German egg noodle which is made like pasta except shorter and non-uniform. Upon serving, it is lightly sauteed in butter. This lends to the unique texture of the noodle which I would equate to a savory funnel cake. It also came with a small butter leaf lettuce salad in a light vinaigrette which balanced the meal nicely. But on to the most important side of all, BEER.\n\nBEER\n\nI've come to find that I know squat about beer but am willing to learn. The bartender overloaded me with a bunch of info, and the little I retained is that Suppenkche offers imported beers from several famous German breweries that aren't easy to get on tap. And these beers are so strong that a place like BevMo would categorize most of them as malt liquor. Hell, if you have a holiday centered around beer (Oktoberfest), you've got to be one of the best at making the stuff. I had a Hefeweizen Dark. Yep, a dark unfiltered wheat beer. No lemon for this bad boy, the taste of this dark but crisp beer stands on its own. The bartender also hooked us up with a few tastes of other beers. I got a half liter, but they serve beer in an assortment of sizes going on upwards to 1 liter mug, a 2 liter boot, or the gigantic 5 liter mug. \n\nSERVICE\n\nSince I sat at the bar, I got service from the bartender, Aaron, who was awesome. I hear the service overall is really good and friendly no matter where you park your fat ass. As I said, the bartender gave us the inside on the beers and a few samplings as well. He even gave Jay about a 6-8oz. sample of a beer on the house since he was drinking an iced tea initially (what a pansy!). And the thing that really got me was the lengths they go to to take care of you. The deal was that I left my Oakleys on the bar when I left. Jay and I got down about a block, when I hear this thumping approaching. It was Aaron running down the block to catch up to us to give me back my glasses. Now mind you this guy looks like one of those angry Euros that could rip your head off in a bar fight. It was just slightly weird for that reason, but very much appreciated.\n\nATMOSPHERE\n\nThe friendly service is what personifies this place. Traditionally (okay, I will include some history) this type of food was offered at the middle aged monasteries which were not only places of meditation and study, but also a place of shelter and food for travelers. This restaurant definitely continues the \"age-old tradition of gathering among friends in a place that is safe and warm.\" Although plain white walls and unfinished tables and chairs give a dull look, you soon get the feel of the richness of the tradition which the cuisine was based on. \n\nAnd if you happen to drop by, sit up at the bar where you get a great view of the establishment as well as a look at the fine selection of German brews on tap. Be sure to look for Aaron. He's gotta be the friendliest man sober, and I suspect a man you want on your side when he's drunk. I swear, us stupid fat Americans have beer bellies, whereas them Euros have beer arms. CHEERS!", "author": "Al L."}

(primer? stain, anyone?)\n\nas i got my bearings and surveyed the scene, i realized that the spartan tables and seating were downright opulent compared to the oddly stenciled - were those pine trees? - shapes high up on the walls, the line of little paper butterflies tacked to the ceiling like a kindergarten project long ago abandoned and thousands of bare hooks in formless patterns also on the ceiling. but first i noticed the serious fly convention that was happening just over my fellow diner's heads.\n\nwe got our drinks - and one star for the healthy beer selection. people left our tables, others came. finally one forlorn couple were seated directly across from me, seated side by side which made me sad. i've always been mildly creeped out when at a restaurant there's a couple seated at a four-top who, instead of across from one another or \"cornering\", they are eating side by side like recently de-conjoined twins. creepy. (strange since i don't feel the same way about couples eating at bars or lunch counters ... just dining room tables.) this poor duo was forced into this kind of awkwardness.\n\nthe service was a bit absent minded, but they were busy to be fair.\n\nfinally, the food. not bad just not great. i was actually annoyed by the jagerschnitzel - the version i make at home ala Joy of Cooking is much tastier. bright spot was the spaetzle, which i HATE making at home. i'd give it an extra 1/2 star for that if i could.\n\nwhen it was time to go, i still had about a 1/3 of my beer left, but we had to go - a fat lady kept pushing her chair into my companion's chair from behind.\n\nto sum up: if you've got a hankerin' for some german, it's not a terrible place, but not a top pick either. schnitzelhaus has better food and better ambiance. walzwerk also has better food but even creepier ambiance. or just come over to my house for some tasty schnitzel, you bring the beer.", "author": "RT G."}

His dream was realized in 1993, when he opened this small Hayes Valley dining spot. The decor is minimalist, almost forbidding in its starkness, relieved only by some artwork on the walls. Fortunately, the menu is more welcoming. Plump ravioli, stuffed with pork and vegetables, or bread dumplings, both served with a rich mushroom sauce, make great starters. I tend to order entrees that I would never prepare at home, so the sauerbraten with cranberries and sauteed venison medallions in red wine plum sauce - with their sides of red cabbage and spaetzle - are my most frequent selections. This is a place to eat early, unless you find loud, boisterous crowds of beer-drinkers and an unbearable noise level an atmosphere conducive to a pleasant dining experience and audible conversation with your companions.

Firstly,  I LOVE german food, so does my Swiss-German BF. I've been to Germany more times than I can remember and I cook the stuff at home, so I know great German food when I come across it...alas, Sppenkche does not fall in to that category.  Secondly, this review would have been three stars, except for two cardinal (in my eyes) sins. #1 - the noise level in the restaurant. Lots of loud, screaming, obnoxious folks. This isn't a cavernous beer hall where you can get away with that shit, so please show some respect to your fellow diners. It was so loud, that it was hard to communicate with the waiter, as a result, the order didn't come out as it was meant to. So minus one star for the cacophony. #2 - only one dessert was offered. WTF? To make matters worse, it was Schwarzwaldkuche which contained Kirsch - being an alcoholic, I can't consume raw alcohol, so there was no dessert for me and my chronic sweet toothh. Minus another star for that bollocks.\n\nAs for the food itself, average, average, average. Why this place is so popular when it serves such mediocrity baffles me. Sure, the Sptzle were nice and freshly cooked, but they weren't anything to write home about. The RotKohl lacked oomph, the venison was a tad dry and flavorless, the wild boar sausage was boring. As for the Kartoffelsuppe, I'm guessing the chef couldn't be bothered with it as it was Blandy McBland, served with what were allegedly Wienerwurst, though they seemed more like skanky American hot dogs to me.\n\nDo yourself a favour - if you want good German food, don't go to Sppenkche...try Walzwerk instead.", "author": "Dan L."}

So does Suppenkuche.  Get there early if you want a seat, or plan to eat at the bar or the cozy alcove behind the bar.", "author": "George S."}

OK-OK, mein deutsche sehr sheisse ist...but C'mon people.  Long story short, I've spent the last 10 yrs living just outside of Stuttgart, know Heidelberg well (the owner's hometown per the history page) and am quite familiar with Bavarian/Schwabisch cooking.  I didn't expect too much, but they lost stars for the following reasons:\n1- The waitress didn't speak german.  And no- I'm not talking conversationally.  She couldn't understand the menu.  If you're working in a place that serves a distinctly and marketed regional, if not national, food- then your wait staff should be able to understand the menu items.  They are, after all, written in deustch.\n2- I witnessed the kasespaetzle incident and frankly, it takes another 30 sec. to sprinkle the cheese on, add some toasted onions (if you're going schwabische), a tablespoon of the (I'm pretty sure) already prepared buttersose, and BAM!- it's done.  \n3- Tho my stuffed pork cutlet was divine, the lentils reminded me of those precooked ones you buy in a pkg at Trader J's.  And they were black.  Maybe that's what's available locally, but I've never had black lentils in Germany.  The Rotekohl, a little sweeter than normal, was still yummy.  The brussel sprouts, tho, were bland.  \nLast but not least- altho the website touted Warsteiner as available on tap ( and that set my mouth a-waterin'), I was told it was no longer served there, which was a bummer.  The Kur-Pee (Koenigs Pilsner) filled in nicely tho.  \n\nBottom line, if you've never been to the Fatherland this place'll work.  If you have, don't expect too much.  \nIch gehe zuruck nichts mehr...\nTchuss.", "author": "Afab M."}

And, truth be told, I was not a fan of the cabbage. \n\nI would recommend trying the ravioli.

Fine, we did wait in line for them to open at 5 pm, however, two out of our four party were circling around looking for parking. The host wouldn't seat us. When I plead her that they were already right down the street, she wouldn't listen and talked back to us with an attitude that I couldn't believe coming out of a restaurant host, \"it's a policy, what do you want me to do?\" Our third party soon showed up because her husband dropped her off due to her disability and told her what he wanted to order. There were two tables left at that point. It doesn't matter we told her that we know what he wanted to order, we would be quick to make the show anyway, she just didn't care.

But this way I'll remember that I came here and come back :)\n\nFirst off, I am a vegetarian. My husband really likes German food, so I took him here, recognizing that there might not be a ton of vegetarian options.\n\nWhen we got here there was a 1/2 hr wait. We stood at the bar and had some beer while waiting, which was fun. I had no idea what some of the beers even were (what is Helles??) so I let my husband order for me. It turned out I didnt really like what he picked though... oops. It was a franziskan weissbier (sp?) which I thought was kind of boring and plain. Anyways, they claimed they gave me a 0.5L, but it looked way bigger than that to me. By the end of the glass I liked the beer much better... hehe.\n\nThen we were seated at a table for 6. My husband and I on one end and a group of 4 on the other. They were nice and it was kind of fun to sit with strangers.\n\nMy husband ordered the bratwurst w/ mashed potatoes and saurkraut. He said the brats and saurkraut were better than at his previous favorite German restaurant, but the mashed potatoes weren't as good.\n\nI got the cheese spaetzl. As soon as I tasted it, I knew that although it tasted really good, it was way too rich for me to finish. Oh well. We had leftovers. The salad that came with the spaetzl was also good. It was some funny red saurkraut and carrots which were good. Also beets, but I don't like beets that much.\n\nFinal analysis: I like this place but there aren't a ton of vegetarian options. Next time I'll probably get the potato pancakes w/ apple sauce.", "author": "zoe b."}

Many beers that I haven't found in other restaurants even in bottles, much less on tap.  Plus a good rotation of even more difficult to find beers.  And where else can you drink out of a mass, boot, or 5 liter \"mug\"?\n\nGreat homey food -- heavy, but flavorful.  It's very good for this type of food, and better than any German food I ate in Germany (but I wasn't trying very hard).\n\nGreat boisterous atmosphere, you get to share tables with your neighbors.  This place has a great vibe that always leaves me happy.\n\nThe wait can be hellish, and the food is not mind-blowing (especially if you aren't downing a liter of delicious 7% a.b.v. doppelbock).

I understand that it's a very popular place, but it sucks that they won't take reservations for small groups. When I went the first time with my girlfriend, they told us it would be 45 minutes for a table, then 25 minutes more, then 15 minutes more, each time because \"it's moving slowly\". Finally, we left. We tried again yesterday and had a similar experience: 40 minutes, then 30 minutes more, again because \"it's moving slowly.\" Meanwhile, the hostess told another couple it will be an hour - even though it's clearly much more packed than when we got there, and she knows now it's moving slowly.\n\nThe food was great, but then there are a lot of great restaurants in the city where you don't have to wait so long (and where they can more accurately predict the wait).", "author": "David P."}

Complete with rude server, rowdy friends and fighting couples. With a SF touch of course... meaning, artsy graphic designs of painted trees and butterflies. Disco balls and tree branches- oh, how ironic! That being said, it was insanely crowded for a Monday night, so the servers were spread thin, and the food was awesome with a few minor glitches here or there.  \n\nMy trusty dining partner and I (aka boyfriend) shared the pickled herring appetizer plate. He was unsure about ordering it, but I assured him it would be a fun dish to try. And it was! The fish was buttery soft and sweet! It went perfectly with the pickle+cucumber salad, pickled shredded carrots and red cabbage. Also went perfectly with our big glasses of beer. I had the Dunkel Weiss (or something like that). For the main, I had the venison, marinated in a red wine sauce, with spaetzel and red cabbage. The venison comes in two pieces. For some odd reason the first piece was disappointingly dry that it could've been any kind of meat. But, the second piece was perfectly cooked- red in the center and moist. Must've been a mishap... I'll let it slide since the correctly cooked piece was delicious. My boyfriend had the pork sausage over mashed potatoes and saurkraut. The mashed potatoes were sort of bland, but that herb butter they serve with the bread basket did the trick. The sausage on the other had was bursting with flavor and when I return I'll probably have that for my main. The waiter said we ordered too much-- he had no idea who he was dealing with =) We finished it all, and were even willing to have dessert, except there was only one option-- German Chocolate Cake. Now, I love chocolate just as much of the next girl, but this cake looked like it came from Safeway. You know, super sugary thick frosting and little cake, which looked more like a milk chocolate than dark. Anyhow, I would come back. Probably with a big group of friends so I don't have to awkwardly sit at a communal table with one gay couple who barely touches their food and one straight couple who would go in and out of a massive fight every ten minutes.", "author": "Nina H."}

Sometimes, a person needs to eat an indescribable \"something\" to feel better when a bear hug just won't do the trick.  Lucky for us, we live in San Francisco and Suppenkuche serves up comfort in large, saucy portions.  It's not gourmet and certainly not pretty, but it's perfect for anyone who's in need of a hearty German meal and a sweet Radler (and wants to dress comfortably in stretchy clothes!!).\n\nI had Sunday dinner with a few friends, and our group was large enough to get a reserved table.  It was a tad bit challenging to squeeze my ever-expanding body into a long, benched table, but the benches and long tables lent greatly to the casual and warm atmosphere abounding in this restaurant.  Next time I need something with gravy, I may have to get some Jagerschnitzel to go...\n\nHere is what I ate:\n\n* Kartoffelsuppe (Potato Soup) $5.00 - the temperature was not as hot as I would have liked, but I enjoyed the rich bacon flavor of this creamy soup.\n* Wiener Schnitzel vom Schwein mit Bratkartoffeln und grnem Salat (Breaded and Sauteed Porkloin with Roasted Potatoes and Green Salad) $16.00 - I tasted a bite of this dish, and it was good ... just a little too simple for me to want more than a bite.  Don't forget to squeeze lemon on your loin.\n* Jagerschnitzel in Champignonsoe mit Sptzle und grnem Salat \n(Sauteed Porkloin in Mushroom Sauce served with Sptzle and Green Salad) $16.50 - This was awesome!  The Porkloin was not breaded, so I thought that maybe this would be a healthier choice that the Wiener Schnitzel.  I guess I was just fooling myself, though, because the mushroom sauce was very rich and creamy and soooooo damn good!  My spatzle was perfectly cooked through (not at all soggy) and went great with the mushroom sauce.  The green salad was butter lettuce leaves with a touch of dressing.  Simple.\n* Black Forest Cake.  Can't remember how much it cost. - Absolutely the perfect closer to my meal.  Needed something sweet (cherries) to wash away the creaminess from my palate.  It was moist cake layered with whipped cream and cherries.  Delish!", "author": "Jenny K."}

For instance the selection of beers; German restaurants only serve one brand; but this place has a selection that's stunning, plus bartenders that can explain all about it.\n\nFood-wise, it belies the notion that German food necessarily is unhealthy. It's not; Sauerkraut after all is one of the healthiest dishes out there, and they serve a few very lean cuts. Other cuts too of course, so if you want to have your helping of leg of pork they'll do that as well.\n\nOnly problem -- size of dishes.

German?\" I mean, the only German food I have ever eaten was a giant pretzel and an apple strudel. So being somewhat adventurous, I decided to try it out.  First off, the restaurant is tiny, (hey, the bar is a pretty good size!) but I figured we would get a good table.  All of a sudden, we are at the same table with another group: Suppenkuche does family style seating (At least we didn't get seated next to some old guy drinking five boot beers and showing us his fake teeth by the time our dinner was served).  Off the bat, we ordered some beers and the potato  pancakes.  The pancakes were very good and tasted like hash browns, but they were not greasy or heavy.  The applesauce they served with the pancakes was sweet and very yummy.  We then ordered the trout, Wiener Schnitzel, and saurbraten.  They were all very satisfying but not heavy and rich as I imagined they would.  We ended trading our dishes around (but not with our table neighbors) to get a bite of everything.  My fish was very light, and the potatoes and vegetables were fresh.  Overall, I was pleasently suprised with Suppenkuche, and I will be back (oh yeah, HAPPY OKTOBERFEST!)", "author": "Shannon W."}

My party of 3 showed up at 5:00 exactly and we ended up having to wait an hour and a half because the line was already down the block! It was worth the wait though and the shops nearby are fun to explore while you waste time. \n\nThe place was really crowded when we got in and there's only communal seating. Things started to calm down around 7ish though (on a Saturday) and the bar cleared enough that my mom didn't keep getting smacked in the back of the head by passing waiters like she did in the first quarter of the meal. Serve time was not the fastest but then again the place was packed... \n\nThe food though: Authentic! Delicious! The beer list was extensive and they had dunkelweizen on tap (my favorite). We all shared the potato pancakes with apple sauce. They were thicker than I like and deep fried instead of panfried... nice and crispy on the outside though and soft in the inside. The seasoning was really well done and the applesauce was the perfect consistency and sweetness to compliment. I had the jagerschnitzel with spatzel, and I substituted the rotkohl for the green salad. The rotkhol is some of the best I've had. The spatzel was burnt in some places like they had a big pan of it that overheated. The schnitzel was tender beyond belief. My mom chose the bratwurst (was very good when I tasted it); she had been thinking about having the sauerbraten but the waiter advised against it and said it's tough sometime because they store it out of the liquid over night. Thank goodness for honesty. And my man had the suckling pig that was definitely the star of the meal! So tender!!! \n\nWere there some flaws? Yes. But in total was it amazing to find authentic German food in the bay area? YES! I would definitely recommend this place to somebody craving German style fare that goes beyond the stereotypical wurst and pretzels (though they have that too!).", "author": "Katrina E."}

The waitress informed me that they do not do kaesespaetzle as a side.  Not true - they've done it for me EVERY SINGLE other time I've been there.  I was a little bitter about this, it's one of my favorites but god knows I can't eat a whole plate of it.  So, fine...no kaesespaetzle for me.  The venison was extremely dry and our friend had the chicken special of the day - which he said was very rubbery.  In the past, we've had the sauerbraten, which is not very sour at all.  My grandmother makes this dish every year for Christmas and has for the past 60 years.\n\nBottom line - totally over rated at this point and has lost the German flare it no doubt had when it was newer and still cared about the quality/authenticity of the food it served.

You can't fault a place for being popular and successful, but just once I'd like the place to myself (all the beer I can drink and all the Suckling I want). \nI've been plenty of times, and most recently a few weeks ago with three other people (about a 30 minute wait). Don't even try to bring a large group on the weekends, you will be waiting a LONG time. But do not fear, they have plenty of tasty beer on tap.

I didn't taste the bacon but did see and taste the hardboiled egg in the middle of my meatloaf. It was a little dry but the gravy helped. Not the best meatloaf I've had but it was good. The mashed potatoes are yumo! The people next to me had Weinershnitzel (I'm sure I spelled it wrong) You know the fried porkshop thing, it looked GOOD! I wanted some.

Looking from the outside, the boot in question did not seem too arduous of a task to complete. It was only 64 ounces of beer, paling in comparison to that of Shroeders' 84 ounce boot. However, this was my first time ever accepting a challenge of belch.. so I had no idea of what was to come. Our party of 16 was seated about an hour and fifteen minutes into our wait. I couldnt wait to drink that damn boot. When the boot came, we immediately started drinking. One of our brethren, nicknamed Warren G the sleeze, wanted to be champion as he was filled with hubris. He drank quite fast, and was several gulps ahead of me and bslut. As our night continued, we ordered a couple entrees to accompany our delicious ale. We ordered some german sausages, along with some fries and mashed potatoes (?) they were pretty damn delicious. Even if I wasnt drunk I would have easily rated this place 4 stars based on food alone. The meat was very tender, and the fries were very crispy. They were delicious by all standards. Anyways, back to the boot. Well, two amazon women at our table combined forces and finished the boot first... too bad it doesnt count because we were doing 1 boot 1 person, thus 2 person would mean 2 boots. whattup. heh heh heh. Just as me and Bsleezy were about to finish our boots, hoots decide that it wasnt fair that he was doing all the drinking, so he decided to feed some of that liquor back to the glass boot. Yah he yacked the shit out of that boot into that boot. I finished literally 1 second after Bslut, however because he had given a taste gulp to his gf, he was disqualified, crowning me as champion of suppenkluche sup sup supp. After my victory, Bslut bought a boot for one of our friends, and since no one, including her, wanted to drink the boot, it was only after 1 singular sip of the brand new boot before Bslut dunked all our combined monies into the beer. yahhh what a crazy night. thats what daz boot can do to a man -it unleashes his inner rage, making his hair golden and spikey as he goes super saiya jin 2", "author": "simon k."}

The salad was HUGE! I recommend getting a small one because this was piled so high with potato salad, cabbage, carrots, beets and other julienned veggies, we barely made a dent in it.  It was good, and more like  an assortment of pickled items rather than a \"salad\".\nI ordered the sauerbraten, my friend got the trout, and my other friend got the suckling pig with a gigantic bread dumpling (like a stuffing ball, kinda).\nThe best thing by far was the suckling pig!  OMG! It was so effing good, with crispy skin and tender almost confit-like meat. Whoa!  Yum.......... The other dishes were good, but the pig took the ribbon. Spatzle was tasty, cranberry sauce was good with the braised beef, but I didn't get the sauce in my doggie bag :0(   \nWe had no room for dessert, as the food is rich and heavy.

I suppose it's a German thing. I was going to order the sausage, but then I saw venison, and thought, \"When will get another chance to try venison? Probably not for awhile.\" So I got it. It seemed overdone, although I'm no expert in the proper method for cooking venison. \nOn the side was spatzle, which tasted like pasta made out of cheese and/or butter, and was delicious, and a pickled red cabbage stuff that tasted very cinnimony, and was surprisingly good, considering I don't really like cabbage, especially cooked or pickled. My boyfriend had a game hen which I tried, and it tasted delicious. The best part was undoubtedly the heffeweizen. We both ordered a half pint of some complicated German-named beer. It was amazing. They offer a wide selection of German beer in every shoe size.\nFor dessert I had a beesting cake, consisting of entirely honey-related ingredients, with a nice black coffee that I believe they brewed just for me. All of this and our total bill was about $67. The service was excellent so after tip it was almost $80. I wouldn't recommend it for a first, second, or third date. Wait until you don't have much left to talk about, as it gets crowded and loud shortly after opening. Or bring your German friend, as I plan to next time I go. Picky white American family members from out of town will probably also appreciate the familiar, safe, yet very well done cuisine.", "author": "Thea K."}

I lived in Germany for a year and since returning to the states I had been looking for a authentic German restaurant to fill my German food addiction. I stumbled across Suppenkucke about 6 months ago and the food and beer served here is as close as it gets to the type and quality of food you would get in southern Germany. If you have never had German food this is the place to try it for the first time! You will be hooked for life! Also, if you like to enjoy a good quality beer this is the place to go! \n\nJust a note for those of you not accustomed to the traditions of southern German dining. If you have a small party (2-3 people) you will probably be seated with other people you don't know. I mean at the same table. It is a little odd at first but you get used to it. You might even make some new friends. Other then that the Suppenkuche is very busy during dinner and brunch on Sunday so go early. It is totally worth it! Enjoy.", "author": "Bradley D."}

Tried the bratwurst, which came with sourkraut and mashed potatoes and my friend ordered the schnitzel, which came with some other variety of potatoes, which I also tried.  The food was really good and the beer selection was great. They actually had Leffe on tap, which is one of my favorite beers (from Belgium).  The seating was tradition German bench style, which wasn't very comfortable, but it makes for an authentic experience. We had to share one table with two other parties. I guess the only way you get a table to yourself is if you have 8 or more people as most tables fit about 8 people.

Sure, whatever, German food sounds fun. Little did I know that I was about to have an explosion of amazingness in my mouth. First off, the place is awesome, I loved the set up of the communal tables, just like breweries I had seen in Munich. The bar in the center is great if you have to wait for a table. Their selection of beers is really broad and the bartenders really know what they're talking about so use their expertise! We had a group of 5 on a Friday night and maybe waited 10 minutes which was great. The d\u00e9cor is really crafty and fun. I highly recommend the Sp\u00e4tzle, seriously a delight! The Gemischter Salat is amazing if you like a fun and interesting salad (think beets, \"vinegarized\" carrots and yummy potatoes). I can't remember what my dinner was, some sort of sausage dish with peas which was really good, but it was a special and I don't see anything similar on the menu.

We relaxed had a few beers and eventually ordered when our whole party arrived. Drum roll please.....It was delicious. Congratulations Suppenkuche, you are still my favorite restaurant in the city. I've ordered a wide variety of dishes here, and they were all better than the last. The wait staff is pretty knowledgeable about beer so if you tell them what you prefer they usually bring just what you are looking for. Obviously it gets very crowded and they don't take reservations for parties less than 8. I recommend getting there at 5:00 or having a little snack before you go.

With a side of fries or a pile of veggies, you'll think your bus took the wrong turn onto the Autobahn.   Their cabbage and \"Spatzle\" are deelish as are their roasted spuds.  Furnishings are very spartan -- even for a German place.  The tables and chairs are like pews and seating in a church - hard and unforgiving.  Even with my big ass I started getting uncomfortable before I had finished my schnitzel.  Prices are reasonable and the beers seem to be really popular (I don't drink beer, so can't really say I've tasted theirs).  The all wood environment makes the place really noisy and conversation across a wood table can be difficult but if you're stuffing your face with a wurst or slice of bread and better, who really cares, right?  :)  I think I've tasted everything on their menu and everything is good although I have to confess I tend to order the schnitzel a lot just 'cos I LOVE IT!  4 stars only because of the noise and hard benches.", "author": "Paul N."}

Bavarian like, we shared a table with another party and there was definitely a neat party vibe in the place.  For a starter, I shared with a friend the ravioli filled sausages which could have been a meal in itself.  For an entree, I had pork sausages with mashed potatoes and 'krout.  Although slightly disappointing that there was only one choice of sausage, the food was delicious and the mashed potatoes to die for.  I'd definitely recommend getting six or more friends together (they only accept reservations for six or more) and heading down for a couple of beers and a few servings of carbs!", "author": "A K."}

Who ever thought that someone could make German food hip and fun?  I've been coming here for probably the past seven years ever since I read about it in a United in flight magazine of all places  -  I think Robin Wright Penn listed it as a favorite restaurant or something -  and it has never disappointed me or anyone else I have brought with me.       Always crowed lively and friendly  with a great selection of food and an even better selection of beer - in huge glasses!  Get the Weinerschniztel if you are really hungry - and anytime there is a special of wild boar get that too.  Also - potato pancakes - and go for brunch too, the farmer's omelet with a heffeweitzen is a great way to start the day - hmm I may have to go there today as now I am getting hungry.  You may have to wait a bit for a table, but a liter of Spaten will definitely help you kill some time.\n\nOne thing kind of funny is that with the release of the movie Beer Fest, I have noticed a huge increase in the number of people ordering boots of beer haha - just remember to turn it to the side at the finish to avoid the air bubble or you'll look like a rookie...", "author": "Timothy S."}

The portions are huge and quality of food is actually good.  I wasn't hungover all those times I've eaten here so you can trust me. But if you're feeling hefferish, come here. Their Chicken Schnitzel is bomb, which isn't on their regular menu but when it is available, order it, you won't regret it.. But one thing you'll always find is those magical potato pancakes! They're basically hash browns with apple sauce but they do a damn good job at making these tasty. Apple sauce, you say? You must still be drunk. No, they compliment each other perfectly.  But If you're socially awkward then you might have a problem eating here because you're seated with strangers on communal tables. And if you're one of those people who solves their hungover-ness with more drinking, then you're set! They fill huge glass boots of beer so you can drink some more.

Don't go on a first date, or a fifth date for that matter. Save it for later on. You're usually seated at a table with strangers if there are only two of you, also. Kind of a mood-killer.\n- This place is loud as hell. Which, as I just mentioned, makes it bad for dates, but makes it great for birthdays or visitors from out of town who want to do some drinking.\n- There ain't much seating, so come early and don't come starving because you'll most likely have a wait for a table.\n- Overall, a fun joint with badass weinerschnitzel.", "author": "Elizabeth M."}

And I mean, come on, you have to have beer in a glass boot, just to say you've done it.  I went for a friends birthday--they wouldn't seat us until everyone was there, and once everyone WAS there, they didn't actually have a table ready for us...so we had to spread ourselves in an L shape between two tables with other parties sitting on the opposite sides of both the tables we were using.  The place is small, so it was a little awkward.  Not a huge deal, and eventually we were able to move to one table.  Speed of service was great and our waiter was super friendly, and the food was really outstanding.  The ambiance is pretty wonderful too.  The real downfall is just how cramped the space is considering how busy they get--and we were there on a Monday night.

Except that I've never been to Bavaria, which is fine by me because Suppenkuche is so much more accessible.   And also I'm thinking that the menu is just a little bit skewed to appeal to Californian tastes and I'll take that over slavishly authentic German fare any day.  \n\nExpect to wait at least 45 minutes for a table pretty much any night of the week.  If you can squeeze into a space at the bar, though, then the wait is half the fun.  It's loud and festive, with an impressive selection of beers and wines.  In December they were also serving up a popular hot mulled wine, which definitely put me in the spirit of the season.  \n\nBy the time you finally get a seat at one of the communal tables you'll be happy to know that the entrees are generous.  The sausages are great, and so is the spaetzel, of course.  I also recommend the appetizer salad.  It's substantial enough to be a meal, especially if you are lucky enough to be able to nibble off your date's plate a little too.  \n\nThe #6 muni bus stops at Laguna and it's just a couple blocks down from there.", "author": "Katherine G."}

We were considering taking our dessert to go but the hostess said she could seat us.  We got seated at 10pm .  We ordered three desserts a few drinks and a soup.  One minute later the hostess came back and told us that because we weren't really eating a meal we had to let the other parties still waiting have our table so they can eat.  We had to get up and wait for the next available table!  We just decided to take it to go since we already ordered and just had to wait for a table!  The desserts came out in 15 minutes while we waited outside.  The thing that really got me was the waitress came outside with the bill and the gratuity was included in the bill since we were a party of six!  I couldn't believe they had the nerve to include their tip since we were kicked out of our table as soon as we got seated and just for ordering desserts!!  I was so disappointed.", "author": "Jen C."}

It's incredibly difficult to have a conversation here.  I'm not sure what all the rave is about.  I guess it depends on your palate.  I had the potato cake with apple sauce for an appetizer, which was pretty tasty.  For the main course, I had breaded pork loins with some kind of potato.  The pork loin tasted like country fried steak I used to eat when I lived in Austin, TX, only the country fried steak had more taste.  This food is really bland.  I've had better comfort food.

We arrived and parked it in the little alcove of a bar.  At first glance, the interior seemed pretty drab & dull with white walls, until you take in the wintry feel they are trying to go for with the hand-painted tree line and all.  The alcove was cozy with candles and German photos & artwork on the walls.  I stuck to the Lambick beers (black cherry and apple flavors, not too heavy and freaking great) while the rest of our party when on a flavorful journey courtesy of German brews.  After a few, we were seated at a nice window seat, which happened to be the same window seat as 2 other patrons.  I asked them what they recommend, they said everything, and even fed me a little of their yummy veal schnitzel.  Needless to say, it's a communal type of place : )  So, we embarked on a culinary tour of Estonia: Jgerschnitzel- porkloin in mushroom sauce (I just knew anything with \"Jager\" in it had to be delish), Sauerbraten: braised beef w/ cranberries, the organic wild boar sausage special, and the skirt steak special.  As forewarned, everything was superb and right up my alley... diverse and delectable.  My favorite out of the group was the skirt steak... drizzled with some yummy sauce, tender, and served with a potato & carrot gratin.  Some other parts of the meal that helped compliment were the lentil soup (more like a stew), Sptzle (the german mac & cheese), and the homemade sauerkraut.  We finished off the meal with another beer... this time I wanted to share the LITER OF SPATEN with the bf... I mean, this is seriously the Big Gulp of beers!  I really didn't know what I was getting myself into.  The place got a little rowdier as the night went on... quite a few customers doing Jager rituals (banging little bottles on the table, putting them in their mouth, and holding them up there with only their lips until empty).  But it was just what we were looking for... empty glasses galore, a full stomach, and a memory.", "author": "Tara G."}

More importantly, it is a super fun place for dinner.  Once you step past the curtain covering the door, you are instantly transported to a beer hall in Munich.  The atmosphere is boisterous and happy, and if you squint your eyes, it looks like everyone is red-faced and wearing lederhosen.  The beer selection is awesome...it's a ton of fun to pick which size and type you want from their menu.  If you are drawn to all things savory, try the pickled herring appetizer (even though it sounds kinda sick).  Experiment with the different beers.  The best plate is probably the basic sausage and sauerkraut.  I had a surprise b-day party in the back room and it was a ton of fun, drank two liters of delicious beer and had a great time!

The service is nothing to rave about, but it's not bad either. The food doesn't come out that fast, but the complementary bread is a delicious way to tide you over. I usually order the potato pancakes to start (so tasty!). I'm a vegetarian, so eating in a German restaurant is potentially a bad idea. Suppenk\u00fcche offers a few excellent veggie dishes however, and I usually go with the Portobella Mushroom stuffed with Spinach & Feta Cheese over Pepper Sauce.

There are also NO other places that I can think of where I can get a BOOT of beer (2 liters - yes, I shared), enormous and crisp potato pancakes, wiener schnitzel that, according to my Austrian-born friend, is the most authentic he's had in the US and have several tons of delectable-ness left for the next day. Suppenkuche is definitely a unique and welcome respite for German-food seekers in the Bay Area. The space is too small to accommodate everyone, so it gets crowded, which only adds to its \"I'm in a real German beer hall\" feeling. The food is straightforward, plentiful, delicious and, according to many natives, very authentic. I actually have to commend the service for getting their job done efficiently and with a smile despite being obviously overwhelmed by the crowds. This is a must see joint.

I'm upset there's nothing like it I know of in NY because I would go all the time.  I came here for brunch and at first I was pretty skeptical about eating German so early in the day but somehow this place makes the perfect brunch meal.  First off, they didn't have any table space so we were initially hanging out at the bar and decided to order some beer.  These come in several sizes here, 1/3 liter, 1/2 liter, 1 liter and \"boot\".  I opted for the half liter of Radler and was basically finished with it by the time some space freed up at a nearby table.  This is the type of place where you share a large table with strangers but the table was big enough and we got the corner so it wasn't uncomfortable in the least.  Anyway, I was done with my first 1/2 liter and ordered another with my meal.  I don't remember exactly what I ordered (I should note that the menu is in German which is kinda cool) but it was a huge plate of some sausage/kraut/potato combination.  Long story short, I finished the entire plate, drank the second half liter of beer and left feeling completely satisfied.  I never would have thought I'd be able to eat so much food or drink so much beer for brunch but everything tasted so good I couldn't stop eating.

Lets just say, our intent was to have a few beers here and then head over to a nearby restaurant for dinner, but alas, it was not meant to be.  \n\nAs you walk in, the atmosphere at this restaurant is really warm and welcoming and I felt like every corner and table was filled with groups of friends having a great time.  The communal tables definitely promote this vibe, because our table of six was there for so long, we had two sets of couples rotate through in sharing our table with us and we had a few good laughs with each couple, of course being that we were getting louder and louder as the night progressed, we had a few more laughs with the second couple...or were they laughing AT us...no matter, providing entertainment to others is not a bad thing.  \n\nOnto the beers...I'm not going to lie, I know nothing about German beers, so yes, I looked up wikipedia to learn a little bit more before coming here.  (you are now thinking, \"who does that??\", I do yes, so get over it).  So I was armed with fresh knowledge about lagers, ales, and further about pilsners, helles, bocks....but when I looked at the menu, my sights were set on the helles with lemon soda...this was sweet and delicious!    My next choice was the black cherry lambic which was a fruity delight and I couldn't wait to order another (also comes in rasberry)  So what if it looked and tasted like snapple, I happen to enjoy snapple! The choices I selected were not followed by the boys, but their selections were just as good, especially the winter lager which was one of the specials that night.  We ended the night with taking shots of the 80% proof herbal concoction that came in tiny little bottles and tasted like a mixture of hennessy and jager.  Whoa did that burn. Apparently suppose to make you \"bright and alert\" and funny enough, I think it did!  \n\nBefore you think we spent four hrs of just drinking, let me assure you that I'm way too much of a lightweight for THAT type of night.  Actually, even with food, I'm somewhat of a cheap date.  I cannot do anything about my genetic make up, and no, I'm not bitter about it, obviously.  Here's what we had -\n\n1. Potato pancakes with apple sauce (large crispy golden cakes with a translucent and soft center because they make these with raw potatoes instead of frying them with fully cooked potatoes)\n2. Grilled pork sausage (crispy on the outside, really delicious, especially with a little bit of mustard and sauerkraut)\n3. Braised beef (this was flavorful, but a bit on the tough side)\n4. Veal weinersnitzel (really, anything fried to a crisp without being oily is generally good in my book)\n5. Meatloaf (scrumptious and moist, with bits of bacon scattered throughout).  \n6. Blackforest cake (uhh...yeah, make that two, thanks)\n\nAll in all, the food was hefty, with lots of starch on the plate and an appropriate companion to the beers.  And with the friendly waitresses, bartenders, patrons and at $30/head for 4 hrs of drinking and eating...I'll skip the poker game (for tonight) thank you.", "author": "Karen L."}

The bartenders were so friendly and informative, the host kept checking in with us. He had a large party that hadn't shown, only 4 minutes till they lost their reservation - would we mind taking their spot if they didn't show? Mind, heck no, in fact, super big thank you. I ordered the meat loaf with egg, bacon, mashed potato and onion gravy. Not remotely like the typical meatloaf and I'm glad for it. The egg white under to loaf was an off-flavor to the dish, yolk mixed in would have been better, but the meatloaf ingredients were fantastic. In fact, although usually the last to finish eating, I was the 1st! Hubby loves the venison w/plum jelly, family loves the Jagerschnitzel and venison. Can't wait to return to get the potato cakes and salmon. Thank you for a fantastic time and great prices and tiny but very cool atmosphere.", "author": "Rachel D."}

Good for groups of any size and level of pickiness, as long as you're cool with sitting nearly in the lap of a stranger. Seating is mostly shared wooden benches, but who even cares when you're busy shoving starches in your mouth? By the time I get seated I'm usually starving which is perfect because it's impossible to eat light. It's German food, what do you expect? I can't live without the potato soup. It's the perfect balance of thick and creamy with subtle smokey ham accents...which leads to an ever changing menu full of meat and potato based dishes. There are no wrong choices. A few times I've ordered one of the specials and they have been out, which can be disappointing, but my second choice has always proved to be delicious and satisfying and quickly erases the let down. Bonus, I live in the neighborhood so i can roll myself home and take a nap afterward. Even if I didn't though it would be worth a trip whenever I'm in the mood for a hearty meal in a fun environment that never fails. Everyone I've taken here from my parents to my 4 year old nephew raves about it afterward...isn't that enough?", "author": "ash c."}

I had the pork tenderloin in mushroom sauce with spatzel (sp?), my boyfriend had a special, brats with sauerkraut and potatoes. everything was delicious! For dessert we had the apple strusel that we devoured in seconds. The beer menu is amazing. for most draft beers they price by the half liter, I had the boot (2 liters) of paulaner marzen, and my boyfriend got a liter of dunkel, i forget which brewery it is from though. the seating is communal, so don't be surprised if you're sat at a table with strangers, it also gets very busy... even on weekdays, we went on a Monday around 7:30, no wait for us, but it got busier through our meal. it is a lively place, so if you're looking for a quiet peaceful dinner, go somewhere else. if you want a true german dining experience, without paying for a flight to munich, then stop in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-08-09", "description": "This is probably my least favorite of the three German restaurants I know about in the city (the other two being Waltzwerk and Snitzelhaus). The reason has been mentioned several times by other reviewers- it is a popular hangout of the Hayes Valley \"It\" crowd. The \"it\" crowd stalks from bar to bar, chugging liquor, talking loudly, picking up on members of the opposite sex, and breaking poor Suppenkuche's 5-liter beer boots (yes they have these and they are available for public use should you be capable of chugging 5 liters of beer). Honestly they should not let the well-intoxicated handle these things, although I hear there is a hefty recovery price to pay should you break one. As for getting your foot in Suppenkuche, come about half an hour to an hour before you actually believe you will get hungry. There is generally a huge wait, despite the fact that you will likely be seated in the \"German style\" = at a large, cramped table full of a bunch of strangers. You may be one of the many lucky individuals who gets to sit either up against the window or wall in the middle of the table (from which escape is near impossible) or, conversely, with your back close to some asshole at the bar drinking beer. But don't worry. There will likely be another group or two seated with you to share your pain... and awkward silence. Needless to say, this unexpected company might make for a rather strange date or romantic evening. But if you are the kind of person who likes to eat delicious cheese spatzle with some strangers, desperately try to talk over those whose voices are hipper than yours, and periliously try to flag down your waitress amid the well-intoxicated-with-good-beer crowd, then this is the place for you, herr yelper.", "author": "M J."}

The sausages and the sauerbraten are solid choices, as well as the gravlax if you go for brunch.  My only complaint about the gravlax is that it is literally a plateful of fish with a side of tasty mustard. No bread, crackers or other carbs to go with it, and I for one, just can't stomach an entire plate of cold fish even though I love sushi.\nEveryone seems to love the potato pancakes, but both times I've had them, I wished later that I didn't waste the limited space in my stomach with those.  To me, they are just super crispy hash browns that sink like a lead balloon into your stomach and make you too full to eat all the other good things you ordered.  I think I keep wishing they were more like latkes, and less like a deep fried potato hockey puck.\nThis place is good for a group of about 6 max (based on my experience of going with a group of 6 and also a group of 16).

However, if you like phenomenal beer, large portions of classic German food, and a lively environment Suppenkuche is possibly the most fun you will have dining out in San Francisco. The wait typically takes an hour or so on the weekends but that's part of the fun! Put your name down then squeeze your way to the bar and order yourself a liter of beer. When it comes to ordering beer I find it best to either order something you have never heard of or ask the bartender what they would recommend. If you would like to sample a few beers before committing to a liter you're in luck as they serve about 10 different sizes of beer ranging from a couple of ounces to the 5 liter stein. Forget giving props for serving a boot, this place will pour you a 5 liter stein!!! I have never seen anyone order this bad dog but it's worth taking a look at while you are there (it usually sits on the top shelf above the bar). After making a few new friends and downing a couple large beers your table is generally ready. The experience at the table can be rowdier than at the bar depending on who you go with or who you're seated next to. Again, it's part of what makes the place fun. What about the food? You get a ton of it and as far as German food goes it's pretty damn good. Let's face it, the Germans aren't known for their culinary prowess.

The Reibekuchen were huge balls of shredded potato and seemed to be deep fried within an inch of their life. Waaay to much fried outside, hardly any good potato inside. It's supposed to be a pancake with some outside pan fried bits not all oil. \nThe Kaesespaetzle was the best part, cheesy with sauteed onions mixed in. Soup was decent, maybe a bit to much cinnamon, but totally acceptable. Can't comment on the meat, but the BF said it was good. \nTotally coming back as the whole meal cost us 65 (with tip and beer).\nOh - and it is really noisy in there. Very authentic German beer hall loud, minus the smoke.", "author": "Chris V."}

I've been to a few places that claimed to be authentic (yeah, right!) and of them, this one really isn't too bad. The interior style is plain, hence the name Suppenkueche (soup kitchen), which was basically used to serve people during WWII. The beer selection is good and the atmosphere around the bar is similar of what you'd find in a german pub. You'll hear a lot of german which is indicative that the place is actually liked by their fellow germans. The menu features a small selection of german entrees and main dishes (Jaegerschnitzel being my personal favorite). Beware of the pricing. I find them a bit expensive (maybe that's just the cheap german in me talking), but hey they are in SF so I guess they get away with a lot. The best item on the menu, by far is their Blackforest cake..... My oh my, it is really darn good (they could add a tad bit more cherry liquor to it tho, again, just the critical german in me talking). They don't seve it every day, I believe Thursday's you might get lucky. It was a nice introduction for my boyfriend, him being from El Salvador it was a first eating german food. It was a nice intro too, especially since we ended up seeing my folks a few weeks later and he had the opportunity to compare the food he had to homemade german grub. The place is popular and fills quickly. One thing that might take some getting used to for some people is that you'll be seated with total strangers. It's real small and the space goes fast. It's not uncommon to see people waiting outside as early as 6:30pm. Parking in the area is a bit challenging. For some really yummy food tho, it's worth it.", "author": "Trinity X."}

Since there were 3 of us we shared a table with 3 others the first set of folks were ok the next tones of fun especially the one flirting with my mom.  We had a bread basket when we sat down with heavy brown german bread and a pretzel both were tasty.  I started with mishroom soup (may parents had lobster soup) both flavorful and delicious.  My dad and i shared a an oktoberfest beer .5 liter which was perfect and too much for one person with the bread and heavy food.  My enteree was venison with red plum sauce, red cabbage and spatzel. It was yummy and a huge portion I could only eat half.  My mom had the souerbraten and my dad the pork snitzel with a creme mushroom sauce both very tasty.  For dessert the 3 of us shared a piece of apple strudel which was falky goodness.  All in a ll a great meal in fun atmospere I will definitely go back here", "author": "Melanie -."}
