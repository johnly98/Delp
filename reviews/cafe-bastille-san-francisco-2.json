I'm not comfortable walking down and San Francisco back alley, but I'm glad I did in this situation.  \n\nThis just happened to be the place where my friend proposed to his wife, and the staff remembered him and treated us like royalty!  On top of that, the meal was top notch.  Even the bread they brought out was great.  I had a sidecar to drink..expertly made and delicious.   The steak au poivre was amazing as well.  Both of my friends had the filet and I was lucky enough to get a small taste....it melted in my mouth.  \n\nCharming service, great food and drink, nice atmosphere.  Definitely worth a trip down an alley to Cafe Bastille.", "author": "Bill T."}

The little alley that the restaurant is in is very charming with hanging overhead lights and the restaurant itself felt cozy and 'french' without being cheesy or theatrical. \n\nI've dined outside and inside now, and both times were great.

Such an interesting little corner of the city! \n\nSo, I had a living social voucher for Cafe Bastille for a prix fixe dinner for two. Went with the hubby and a friend who ordered a la carte. The prix fixe consisted of three courses, for each course you were able to choose between two to four dishes. I went with the French Onion Soup, the Coq Au Vin, and the Chocolate Mousse. The hubby had the soup as well, Boeuf Bourguignon and a raspberry mousse. My friend went for appetizers and chose the Foie Gras, Beet Salad and Escargot. We also sampled several of their cocktails.\n\nFirst off: We had an amazing evening. Service was wonderful, our waiter so very friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. The ambiance is sweet, you feel like you're in a little Brasserie in Paris, I kid you not! Downstairs ia additional seating, so the place is much larger than it seems at a first glance.\n\nThe food was OK. I had the feeling, the prix fixe was a bit lackluster. The soup had almost no seasoning and was watery, cheese was a bit burnt, main course was cold (and the beef tough to chew). The dessert cake/mousse options felt like store-bought dessert with store-bought sauce. \nThe Foie Gras was amazing though, I ate half of my friend's portion. Oops. My Coq was tasty (but again lacking salt - I never use the salt on the table in a restaurant, but this time I did) but unfortunately a bit cold. \n\nThe baguette in the bread basket was a nice treat. Warm, crunchy, super good!\nCocktails were very good as well, they were definitely generous with the alcohol. I especially liked the Orange Blossom cocktail.\n\nI will definitely come again and try the a la carte items. I feel like that's a much better choice compared to the prix fixe.", "author": "Alexa W."}

For dinner, I ordered the special of the night which was a filet minon with garlic mashed potatoes and green beans served with a red wine reduction. It was amazing! The filet was cooked to perfection (I am a medium rare girl) so it was nice and tender and juicy. The garlic mashed potatoes were nice and smooth and had a nice rich mouthfeel. The green beans were tender and not overcooked. It was a fantastic meal! \n\nI really wish at that point I would have had room for dessert, sadly I did not.

I recommend coming on a weeknight (the most recent time I went was last night- on a Tuesday) because it gets  little busy on the weekends. \n\nThey serve all of the normal, traditional dishes you would expect- coq au vin, beef bourignon, escargot, etc. alongside delicious bread and a very reasonable wine list.

I often take out-of-town co-workers here because the menu has a lot of choices, full bar, excellent service and for myself I know I can eat here gluten-free without issue.\n\nThe hostess, whom I think may be the owner, and I forget her lovely name, is quite observant about the party and will make excellent beverage and menu suggestions. The drinks menu features signature cocktails that change occasionally, which is fun. The menu is mostly the same year-round, except for specials, and most of the fare is naturally gluten-free or can be made so with some adjustments.\n\nThey can accommodate large groups with multiple checks, but please be kind to the lovely hostess and speak to her about this before you place an order so that she can tell you what she can or can't do in regards to the bill. We once had a party of about 20 people. She took everyone's order and then when it came time to pay the check she allowed us each to pay separately but we had to go one-by-one with her to the cash register.

We didn't have a reservation, but the concierge at the Ritz Carlton recommended Belden Place, the alley where the restaurant was located, and told us to show the restaurant his card to get seated quickly. The alley is pedestrian only and had a very European feel to it; it was wonderful to walk through it and feel like I was being briefly transported to Montpellier or Nice. There were a lot of cool looking restaurants nearby, and it looked like all of them had both indoor and outdoor seating. However, since it was a cold evening in December, most of the outdoor seating was empty.\n\nI was in the mood for French food so we picked Caf\u00e9 Bastille; it's a little way into the alley but there was a little lit-up sign that pointed to the door, which was handy. There weren't a lot of people sitting outside but the inside was busier. We also heard there were a few large groups downstairs that night. The hostess asked if we had a reservation, but we were seated pretty quickly after presenting the hotel concierge's card. The restaurant was very heavily decorated with colorful French posters and a French flag hanging from the ceiling. There was a very quaint, charming ambiance that I enjoyed a lot. The service was quick and attentive and I appreciated that my water was refilled quite frequently.\n\nAs an appetizer we got the beef carpaccio, which is one of my favorite French apps; it was very tasty here and even my coworker, who is not very adventurous, thought it tasted great and had half the plate. The complimentary bread was delicious and warm and paired well with the carpaccio. I got the lapin \u00e0 la moutarde as my entr\u00e9e; it was pretty big and came with a generous helping of veggies, including carrots and pearl onions, which were so juicy and flavorful. The lapin jus was also really tasty. The dish came with pancetta, but I found that to be mostly superfluous. The rabbit meat was very tender and fell off the bone nicely. My coworker got the trout and really enjoyed it, although he finished it really quickly and started eating more of the complimentary bread after, so it might not have been enough food. I found my dish to be more than filling enough.\n\nI really enjoyed eating here and am glad to have stopped by. For me the upsides were the flavor/quality of the food and the lovely European ambiance both inside and outside the restaurant. The bill, however, was hefty--for 1 app and 2 entr\u00e9es our total bill came out to be about $85 including taxes/tip (no dessert or drinks). The restaurant was conveniently located about 2 blocks from our hotel, and really close to a lot of other restaurants and cafes both in and out of the Belden Place alley.", "author": "Connie L."}

I first went there in high school and my time was memorable ... I don't think Yelp was around yet.  But now visiting Caf\u00e9 Bastille after a few years along with a trip to Paris under my belt - I love the restaurant even more.  The ambience, the food, and service keep it as a San Francisco gem. \n \nAlso, the location has a hint of romance tucked in Belden Alley and it is dimly lit.  Along the walls are colorful French signs with white marble tables.  I think this place would be a great first date or in my case multiple dates.\n \nDuring my most recent visit, I enjoyed their pork chop.  It was huge for one person, so I recommend sharing or if you're not that hungry - don't order this.  The sauce poured on top of it was rich and robust.  There was obviously a healthy amount of wine, but who's complaining?\n \nSecondly, I am a pomme frites fanatic.  So, per usual I ordered for the table and it is a MUST for any other first-time guest.  It comes with a simple aioli that is perfect with the thinly fried potato.  I recommend pairing it is ideally paired with one of their white wines.\n \nAll the food was delivered in a timely manner.  Just like my last trip to Paris, where I learned that the cafes and bistros allow you take your time eating.  Eating and drinking is a patient experience.  At Caf\u00e9 Bastille, they do not rush you and they ask you if you're ready for the next part of your meal.  It's not all brought out at once unless requested.  They want you to enjoy the food and experience everything they have to offer.\n \nBonne appetit!", "author": "Angela D."}

Does the food blow you away? Hardly. \n\nI came here for lunch with a new coworker on an impromptu visit, and while it took a little while for the waiter to have us seated with menus (they seemed understaffed at the time), that wasn't the reason for the A-OK rating. For me, it's always the food. \n\nChicken Cordon Bleu ($21, I believe): For those who aren't familiar with the dish that bears the same name as that one culinary school in the Bay Area, this is ham and Swiss cheese wrapped in chicken prior to being cooked. My dish in particular came out well-cooked for the most part, save for a few spots where it was still cold. The dish also came with cooked potato slices and a salad, which I enjoyed slightly more than the chicken itself. When one enjoys the sides more than the main part of the meal, that's not a good thing at all. \n\nService was a little long, but I've had worse experiences, so that's not a huge knock on them. \n\nOverall, while Bastille is a decent restaurant, you can definitely find a better French restaurant to dine in than this place.", "author": "Viet N."}

This was my first time trying it, and since I'll eat mostly anything I was excited to see what it was like. My first impression was that it was delicious! For those who have never had it, it has a pretty similar texture and consistency to a clam, and the sauce its made in is to die for! Highly suggest dipping the fresh french bread they bring you in the sauce because it pairs so well.\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e, I wanted to try something new, so I ordered the coq au vin. It definitely did not disappoint! I'm usually not a fan of ordering chicken dishes at restaurants because they tend to be pretty basic and I always feel like I can make it better myself, but this chicken had so many delicious flavors and elements going for it that made it special. The sauce was really potent, and you can actually taste the wine in it which I really loved. \n\nIt was also my friend's birthday a few days prior, so I let the waitress know and she was kind enough to knock off the price of the corkage fee for the wine we brought ($15), and in return told us to pick a dessert for her. We got the chocolate pear tart which was delicious! It had a tasty whipped cream on top, which was almost like an ice cream.

Very cute place. \n\nHowever, parking, be prepared to pay around $30-$40 for area garages if you're driving. It's to be expected downtown SF.

Good things, nice wine list reasonably priced, warm baguette and soft butter. The French onion soup did not have the depth of flavor that comes from multiple caramelization of the onions; just broth, onion, bread and some cheese. At one point I thought it tasted like dishwater-perhaps missing seasoning. The mussels are a huge bowl, probably over 3 dozen. I began to dig in and soon found that they were so small-the meat inside was about the size of a dime. Most were overcooked and disintegrated when I put a fork to them (I also didn't get a small fork so the salad fork destroyed them). Many shells were empty. I wonder if this is a bag of frozen mussels warmed in the broth. Usually I dig into mussel broth (ordered the white wine broth option) with bread, but again, no seasoning or flavor here. I left half the bowl. The fries were pretty good, though lots of salt. The desert on the prix fixe menu clearly had been setup ahead of time and refrigerated. It was ok but the plate and desert were too cold. The menu is full of your expected French favorites, duck confit, beef Bourgogne, coq au vin, steak frites, etc. the execution was poor.", "author": "Ginger B."}

Au-haw-haw!\"\nCrowd: \"Au-haw-haw!\" \n\nThat's how I feel when I go to French restaurants. Au-haw-haw. I haven't said a complete sentence in French since Miss Amble's class in high school. But somehow a place like Cafe Bastille makes me think I should talk like Celine Dion with a lot of wild arm gestures: \"Eet eez a pleazure to be here and I am sure a privilege for vous...since I am the greatest singer in the world!\" Funny thing was that I was with a full-fledged French person when I visited here last week, and her fluency and natural \u00e9lan made the dining experience so much better than it would have been had it been just me with a Berlitz food dictionary. Since my dining companion is a working mother of a toddler, I thought she might like lunch in a bistro from her days of yore.\n\nBut it wasn't all about her. I really wanted a reason to order French Onion Soup given the intense cold snap we've been having of late. For $7.95, they serve a warm little crock gooey with Gruy\u00e8re over toasted baguette slices (see photo). I have to disclose that the broth was a bit too watery to be completely satisfying, but the overall warmth did the trick. This was followed by the pleasing $12 Fris\u00e9e aux Lardons, a nice size bowl swimming with curly endive in a warm shallot dressing, peppered with hearty chunks of pancetta and crispy croutons, and topped with a breaded poached egg (see photo). Now that was delicious in that oh-so Parisian way that makes me think I am Ina Garten with her often absent Jeffrey at a sidewalk cafe. How good is that?\n\nWe shared the last dish, her recommendation of a $12 appetizer portion of the Quenelle de Lyon, a dish completely foreign to me but something she makes at home. Quite a nice treat as it was a quartet of fish dumplings in a nantua sauce, which is a B\u00e9chamel blended with heavy cream and crayfish butter (see photo). Decadent? Oh I'd say so but tasty as it was baked in a dish like a calorific lasagna. She mentioned that she had never seen it prepared that way, that most people simply pour the B\u00e9chamel over the dumplings without the final step of baking it. I have to admit I rather liked that final touch. Three appetizer-size dishes and we were quite satiated. So much so that I felt like singing... \"Neeeeear.... faaaaaar.... wheeeeere-evuhhhh you arrrre!\"\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...a weak broth marred an otherwise lovely bistro dejeuner\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...ah, it is Belden Place, so faux-Europe awaits here\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...hearing the French dialogue between my companion and the server with no subtitles made me wish Miss Amble was there to hit me with her lesson ruler\nTOTAL - 4 stars...been a long time since my last visit to the Bastille but I'm glad I came... au-haw-haw", "author": "Ed U."}

This is our favorite cuisine, but the balance and skillful technique don't exist here. Sooo close...but in the end, a miss. This is not Gaspar or Chapeau, sadly. We had:\n\nSoup du jour, supposedly potato-leek. I use the words \"supposedly\" because it tasted more like cauliflower-leek to me. Spouse found it salty and thin-tasting, even though it was creamy. \n\nFris\u00e9e aux lardons, one of my favorite salads...but not here. Caf\u00e9 Bastille's version had old fris\u00e9e that was chopped, and way too much cider vinegar. The only good part was that the egg was at the right temperature. This salad is quintessentially French -- balance is everything. Although I love pork, there were too many lardons, making this a salad of excess instead. Not the worst Salad Lyonnaise I've had, but far from the best.\n\nMerguez with cous-cous. We were happy to find the merguez the traditional thin, chewy, gamy sausage we love. Many restaurants have switched to the D'Artagnan brand, which is fat, fine-grained, and so ridiculously mild it could be mistaken for a beef knackwurst instead. The cous-cous was fine, mixed with dried fruit. \n\nRoasted marrow, a generous dish of three long halves. Liked the spicy bread crumbs, appreciated the unbuttered croutes. Marrow is so rich it needs no additional fat with it.\n\nBlanc noir (blood) sausage. Good, but the sauerkraut was ridiculously salty with too much bacon. \n\nDaily special: wild halibut in white wine-butter sauce. Fish wasn't fresh, was pan-browned too long with too much black pepper on it, it wasn't salted at all, and had a strange mushy texture on the inside. The sauce was light on the lemon but too heavy on the butter. It made the dish over-the-top, cloyingly rich. A terrible combination with a mushy fish whose crusty exterior was so tough I had to use a steak knife to saw through it. The portion was generously sized, but the quality and execution were third-rate at best.\n\nCrepes Suzette. Perfunctory tableside service, sloppily performed. The orange sauce is already in the pan. The waiter pours the liqueur (Cointreau?) over and then lights it. The flame is low and weak, not really enough to properly warm the sauce. Little or no butter. \n\nBastille in the end was sadly average, meaning mediocre French. We liked the merguez and the marrow, but neither dish requires much thinking or training from the kitchen. When it came down to actually executing a balanced array of flavors in a Gallic bistro standard, Bastille's kitchen gets a \"D\".\n\nService was very good and efficient, but they weren't crowded on a Thursday evening.", "author": "Jean K."}

I must say, I was super excited and went back to bed excited for the many congratulatory compliments from Yelpers around the world.\n\nThen I woke up.\n\nIt was a dream. When you begin dreaming about Yelping then you know you have problems. And given that it's been nearly two years since my last ROTD it's obviously been on mind.\n\nI blame Cafe Bastille.\n\nLast night was one of those rare warm San Francisco evenings, so we made plans to meet up with friends in the City hoping to take full advantage of the beautiful weather and dine al fresco. Belden Lane was on top of our list and upon arrival found plenty of open seating at Cafe Bastille. Our hostess seated us at a nice table close to the entrance. It was just after 7:00 and with the temperature still hovering around 72 degrees, we were very happy to score such a great table.\n\nThe service was good and our server was helpful with suggestions. My wife and I started by charing the frisee salad which we both loved. The crusted soft boiled egg with plenty of bacon bites made this dish very enjoyable.\n\nI was torn for my entree and solicited our server for his thoughts, he suggested the Beouf Bourignion which is one of my all time favorite French dishes. I ordered a side of French fries, but our server was nice enough to point out that my wife's dish came with \"unlimited\" fries and that there would be plenty of fries for the both of us. Gotta give him props for that.\n\nI am sad to report to my dish didn't really live up to my expectations. The beef was a little dry, the carrots were not cooked enough and the sauce not at all flavorful and lacked even a remote hint of red wine. I didn't hate it, but probably not something I would get again. But with this being said, there are plenty of other tasty options to be had here and would definitely come back and check those out. \n\nThe French fries? They were a hit and the bernaise dipping sauce was perfect. \n\nWe sat at our table for over 3 hours and never felt rushed.

I went to France last year so I was looking forward to good French food. After I read the reviews on this restaurant, it seemed that most people liked the beef bourguignon, so I ordered that.  To my disappointment, the beef was so dry and overcooked.  In fact the beef pieces were burnt on one side.  The French Onion soup was also a disappointment, not enough cheese.  If you want really good French Onion soup, go to Perry's or Liverpool Lil's.  Fortunately, the only good course was the cream brulee dessert.\n\nEven with the Groupon coupon (which barely covered the price of the meal and wine), the price of the unsatisfactory meal was overpriced.

Cute little restaurant, with I'm guessing what is another dining area downstairs for bigger parties.  I liked the outdoor seating (though it was too cold to sit outside).  The tables are really close together inside though, a little too close for the American lifestyle!  \n\nI ordered the Croque Madame since I've always wanted to try this French sammie staple, and she ordered one of the daily specials, a sun dried tomato & mushroom quiche with frites.  Both of entrees came with a side of salad.  And of course we munched on a baguette with butter.  The salad needed more dressing, it was very faint tasting, but maybe that's Euro style?  My Croque Madame was yummy but a little rich for me.  Loved how the yolk ran when I pierced it.  Portion sizes were just right.  We both loved her quiche though, it was very tasty, I think I found a love of sundried tomatoes after trying it.  The frites could have been a little crispier though.  \n\nFriendly service & real Frenchies working here (at least a couple of them were).  The food wasn't OMG great but not bad either.

They had reservations online until 11pm so I assumed a reservation at 10pm, an hour before the last available reservation, would be fine. When I arrived there were still a few tables eating dinner, but I wasn't greeted as I walked through the restaurant. I had to walk to the back to find someone to ask about my reservation. The waiter I first spoke to was very kind and explained to me that their special valentine's day menu was about 80% sold out so they only had a few options left. This didn't phase me at all and I understood it was late and they were running out of supplies. As one can expect at 10pm on Valentine's day in SF. But as I was speaking to the waiter, who profusely apologized they did not have the whole menu, the other staff mentioned multiple times to me that I was \"the last table of the night.\" As if to remind me of how much of a nuisance I am for making them stay later to serve me even though they had reservations open until 11. The whole staff stood around and listened to our conversation to see if they would have to stay and serve me or if they could peel out early because I changed my mind. The male waiter gave me a menu and put stars next to the remaining food options which was very helpful. I explained to him I was going to step outside and ask my party if they were still interested in eating there with the limited menu, as some of the party was vegetarian and the altered menu left little options for this. As I was on the phone, with the menu of the available options in my hand, a second female waitress walked out and interrupted my phone call to remind me that 80% of the menu was gone even though she had witnessed the first waiter explain this inside. I said \"yes I understand I'm speaking with my group to see if they're still interested in eating here.\" And then she preceded to interrupt me to ask \"are your friends going to show up?\" She was clearly hoping to sway me from eating there so she could take the rest of the night off and go home by interrupting me. She insisted on reminding me about the menu and pestering me about whether \"my friends\" were going to show up. This whole traumatic experience caused me to leave promptly and go to the restaurant Sauce a few doors down which was open until 1am and had amazing service. Long story short, the staff bullied me into not following through with my reservation so they could all take the night off. A suggestion, don't provide reservations late into the night if you don't want to stay open past a certain point.

For a Thursday night, I was surprised how quiet Belden was, so we ended up getting a nice table outside under the heat lamp and great service from our waiter. They were doing Dine About Town, but we decided to order ala carte instead since the DAT menu was limited. \n\nThe three of us shared the bone marrow gratine, the ratatouille, the ahi tuna salad, the duck casoulet, and the normande mussels with all-you-can-eat fries. This was my first time having bone marrow; I was pretty excited! The cut the bone into three pieces for us. One friend got the piece with the most marrow. The other two pieces had less marrow and was mostly breadcrumbs which overpowered the subtle taste of the marrow. The flavor was still good and went well with the complimentary hot bread. This was also my first time having salad nicoise; the seared ahi tuna was fresh and delicious! \n\nOur server was great and staggered our courses so we had time to finish each course before the next one arrived. The duck and mussels arrived piping hot, just the way I like my food! I normally would order the white wine mussels, but my friend wanted the cream one so we got that. The cream broth was so good that we got spoons to drink the soup :) With Plouf next door, I was surprised that their mussels were deliciously plump and fresh (I later read that Bastille and Plouf are owned by the same people). They also weren't kidding about the all-you-can-eat fries, we were getting full but got another half order since the fries were so good.\n\nThe only dish that I didn't really care for was the duck confit cassoulet. I confused cassoulet with casolette (having tried a tasty baked fromage bacon cassolette in Paris recently), so I was surprised that the cassoulet was a white bean dish. The beans were flavorless while the duck was salty (usually the case with duck confit that I've tried). I ended up eating the duck with the ratatouille, which tasted better than the beans.\n\nFor dessert, our server recommended the ile flotante (floating island) or the creme brulee. I was actually looking at the new key lime mousse, but went with his first choice of the ile flotante since I've never have meringue. My friend, who said she was too full to have another bite, ended up loving the dessert. It was ok to me since I'm not a fan of the candied almond foam, but I enjoyed the soup. \n\nAll in all, Cafe Bastille was a wonderful French dining experience, and I look forward to returning, esp. to try the beef bourguignon. I'm not sure if their website is up to date, but it shows a 3-course prix fixe for $30 which is cheaper than Dine about Town and with more options.", "author": "Diana B."}

The location is cool with plenty of outdoor seating.  It was cold when we arrived for dinner, though, so we opted to sit inside.  There was a crowd at the bar, so it was very loud.  It would've been nice to talk over dinner, but we could barely hear each other.\n\nThe best thing about Cafe Bastille was the baguette--toasty warm, crunchy, chewy and totally reminded me of France.  We had to try really hard not to fill up on it.  Here are my thoughts on the dishes we had:\n\nMesclun Salad - Pretty standard, nothing special; actually tasted pretty bland to me.\n\nFrench onion soup - Only dish I really enjoyed besides the bread; the broth was very sweet from the onions and seasoned just right.  My major issue was in addition to the toasty, cheesy bread on top, there were also pieces of soggy bread underneath.  Seemed like a ploy to give you less soup to me.\n\nBoeuf Bourguignon - Beef was tender; potatoes, mushrooms and pearl onions cooked just right; carrots were on the crunchy side though and the whole thing was pretty bland.\n\nCassoulet - Had a couple bites of this; sausage tasted good, duck was okay; overall, lacked flavor.\n\nDessert - Looked like stuff I can get at a mediocre bakery in China Town.\n\nWith an order of the 1/2 Carafe Red, we paid a total of $85.  Given the food and service, $85 was a bit much.  If we paid the full price of $115 (without the coupon), I would've been annoyed.  Service was subpar.

Cafe Bastille has outdoor seating in an alley. Its a special urban experience to dine al fresca in the shadows of the Financial District. There were several other restaurants also tucked in on Belden. \nThe service was slightly slow. The pace felt \"European\" which was fine with us during an early weekday supper with the exception of having to wait for a second glass of wine. We had a Cabernet Sauvignon from Napa by the glass which was good but not exceptional. There were several pages of bottled wines and I can guess there were much better wines there than on the by the glass menu. \nI ordered the Risotto. I don't see it on the online menu and will try to recall what was in it. First, it tasted fantastic with clean flavors that blended very nicely. Crab and asparagus were there. The risotto itself was green, likely from fresh herbs. I feel completely inadequate in describing this dish but it was wonderfully creamy, fresh and balanced. With protein and veggies in it, it was a complete meal. \nMy companion ordered the baked chicken which came with mashed potatoes, gravy and asparagus. (I also don't see this on the online menu.) He said it was tasty and just the right proportion of carbs and protein.\nWe split the tiramisu which was nicely sized, very moist and delicious.

The nice light dressing in the salad and the tart and light sweetness of my creme brulee were perfect.

Our main course was delish too - there was so much chicken, I couldn't finish it all.   The rabbit with the creamy sauce was really good too.  Dessert was a fail though - I was looking forward to mousse like pudding but it was more like a cake with a thin layer of mousse on top.  The passion fruit & mango did not go well together though.  I love sweets but I had only a few bites of this one.  \n\nOverall, great place to eat.  Its in Belden Lane near downtown and there are other great places to eat nearby as well.

Can kind of ruin a meal depending on who you sit next to. Anyways, we ordered our food.  I ordered a salad and rabbit entree and my bf got the french onion soup and blood sausage. We also got the two different desserts at the end as well.  We both LOVED our entrees.  My rabbit stew was so tender and had no gamey taste to it.  I loved it so much.  I had some of my bf's meal too and it was sooo good.  The blood sausage paired with some stewed apples were a great combo.  Very rich and hearty food that's done very well.  As for the dessert...I dont' remember much of it but it did come out partially frozen (not fully thawed).  \n\nOverall ambiance and meal here are great.

I don't think anyone on the twilight cast would approve of the bloodiness. Then to make matters worse, they took the steak back, cut it up into slices seared it and then it turned into well done.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-13", "description": "I am a former customer who loved your restaurant years ago, before I had a bad experience on my birthday in 2007. I wrote a poor review then, and just today came back to see if things have improved. What I found surprised me. My post from 2007 is still posted at the TOP of the list, as though YELP is continuing to hold Bastille to task, either for not improving, or possibly for not \"buying down\" the placement of my poor review from 9 years ago!!\n\nI call FOUL! on Yelp for holding Bastille hostage in this manner, but I see that there's a way to sort the reviews by date, to see how people are reviewing more recently. It's obvious that recent complaints continue to note poor service and food, while many people also have great meals and dining experience. So what gives? How can anyone know whether Bastille's food has improved, or if the wait staff is still unfriendly, and motivated by curb appeal, convenience or profits rather than providing an excellent experience, as we used to enjoy at this cool location that we still have fond memories of.\n\nSo the obvious question for Bastille is: Why not RESPOND and improve?! I invite and encourage the owner/management to actually reply/answer each lousy review and DO SOMETHING to show you care about happy customers and a positive dining experience! Silence is not a good option, and it's obviously working against you! Train your staff to be more thoughtful and friendly if they are being dismissive!! Believe and take seriously these reviews and attempt to address the issues expressed. I'm amazed that isn't already happening.  I have no idea if management is connecting with recent unhappy customers, but if they had done so with me, I would feel heard, reassured by that effort to make things right, and consider removing my bad review, which as of today before my update, was still lurking at the top of Yelp's default review sorting. I care enough about this restaurant to shout out to Bastille's management, and if you're listening, reply! If you give great service, focus on the food, and respond positively to food complaints, you don't need Groupon, you'll regain my and other friends happy return to Beldon Alley. \n\nZero Stars for Yelp, for keeping my old review at the top after 9 years. That's just LOUSY and reminds me of Yelp's sleazy practices of yesteryear, seemingly alive and well today. For Bastille, I'm upgrading to give you another chance. going from one star to two, because I LOVE FRANCE AND I WANT YOU TO IMPROVE! but that only happens when you attempt to fix the dissatisfaction of unhappy customers, rather than treating them like they don't exist or don't matter. \n\nMy review is below, and will remain until someone from Bastille connects with me to show they care about customer experience. I'm not holding my breath, but I do believe in second chances. Someone in management has ignored this best business practice for years, and should wake up or be replaced.\n\n6/13/2007 \nWe've been going to Cafe Bastille for years, and love the food there. We also like the atmosphere, which takes us back to our trips to France. \nThe waiters and Maitre'd are another story. On our last visit, a cool night, we had a reservation (my birthday) yet when we arrived, they immediately insisted there wasn't indoor seating, and proceeded to seat us outside, where we could be seen by passers by as happy customers overflowing to the outdoor seating. We were so uncomfortable outside that we asked for an inside table again, and were reluctantly led inside ... into a relatively empty restaurant!! \nAmid an abundance of empty tables, we were seated wedged between the only two occupied tables in the area, so we were all bunched together overhearing each other's conversations. I have no idea why they do this!! \nAlthough our meal was wonderful, as usual, I left feeling very disappointed in their handling of the customer experience, which seems to take a back seat to self-promotion and convenience for the staff. We hate to say it, but we don't plan on returning anytime soon. I hope they'll reconsider their priorities and return to a customer-oriented approach.

In fact, I think each item on the regular prix fixe menu and the Dine About Town menu would add up to whatever it should be so it's not much of a deal to get the prix fixe. I definitely love the atmosphere here because I'm a sucker for the European-styled side walk cafe and outdoor dining in general. I love the chatter of the dinner crowd and the cool night breeze. I had made a reservation beforehand it was a good thing I did because this place was packed. We nabbed the last table outside. The service was good and we stayed there a long time.\n\nWe started out with the crab cakes and they were definitely not what we expected because they were little fried balls rather than the flat cakes I had imagined. Still, it was good because you can definitely taste the crab meat in it. It was a little dry, but the dipping sauce it came with was super good and thick. I could definitely spread that on anything. I also had the french onion soup which was one of the better ones I've had because it was not salty and the bread pieces were still intact, not broken down mush at the bottom of the bowl. The cheese was not crusted hard on top, but quite melty. I had it with the ratatouille and chicken crepe, but a little sad that there was not so much ratatouille in it and was more like a light tomato sauce. The chicken was a bit dry too. I tried the boudin noir, which was really good. The mashed potatoes were creamy and the caramelized apples were still firm. The blood sausage was very loose and far from processed. The hacis parmentier was super cheesy and hearty. I was a little disappointed by the dessert menu because they had a lot of cakes on there, but I shall for sure try the floating island next time.

A classic french combo and hella good!\n3rd course: Its called \"Floating Island\" which is pretty much meringue floating on a sweet cream soup. I liked the meringue.  Nice and fluffy\n\nOverall great experience at my first real french restaurant in a while.  Service was top notch and the atmosphere was relaxing.  \n\nI dunno if i would be a regular here.

We got seated in the patio section (wished they had informed us of that prior, thinking they had room for 50+ indoor per the opentable site), but luckily it was a nice enough night for January.   The seats were rickity, and on uneven pavement, so the table was tilted a bit, and so did your chair. It was canopy, and they only had 1 heater on the restaurant side.  \n\nThe menu looked great online, however, the food was not.  I got the prix fixe menu - and got the french onion soup, coq au vin and mango mousse (open table advertised their fixed menu at $25, they really charge $30)\n\nFrench Onion Soup:  The cheese was good, it came out nice and hot and the cheese and bread was tasty.  However, which you actually tasted the soup, it was pretty bland.  Not very much flavor at all. \n\nMy entree was the Coq Au Vin ~ and was I very disappointed. Egg noddle, was fettuine noddle, and the chicken was so dry! I hoped that dipping it in the sauce would make it better, but the sauce was mediocre. My sister makes coq au vin and she does a better job than this restaurant!  I had coq au vin at many different places and this was the first time I was disappointed at a restaurant for something like this (which I thought was a safe choice!)  Not good and like previous reviewer said before, tasted like they used same stock and massed produced this! Our table of 12 had 3 order of Coq Au Vin and all the chicken were dry ~ the beef bougnion I sampled from my friend tasted of the same sauce they used for the Coq Au Vin ~ the vegtable (potatoe, et al) was still hard in my dish!  \n\nMy sister's entree: the lamb chop - my goodness, that was the worst lamb I ever had! It still tasted so game-y and the seasoning was ehh.  The green bean was super oily.  \n\nThe dessert made the meal tolerable. Great dessert, simple mango mousse cake wtih raspberry puree.  \n\nGood bread, soft butter, so that was good.  \n\nService was good and bad. When the first half of the party arrived, we got attentive service, but when the birthday girl and the rest of the party arrived, our server disappear, no water, no explanation of the menu, etc. \n\nThey did refilled our water a couple of times, but they kept hitting up against some of the guests wicker chair and causing that person to bump the table.  \n\nDislike that we where we were seated, we could smell some of the employees smoking!  Their chairs were super UNCOMFORTABLE. And godforbid you have long hair, it will get stuck in the chair.  Half of the table was cold since they only have 1 heater on the far side of the wall. \n\nWould not recommend for group or anyone who wants AUTHENTIC french food.

I was pleased with the way this dish turned out-- the sauce was light and the texture of the pasta and vegetables were all on point, not soggy or undercooked. The chunks of (parmesan?) cheese on top really added extra flavor, which I personally liked. With the $14 pasta dish and very pieces of their hot, toasty bread, I was full and content. \n\nI'm tentatively giving this place 3 stars because the pasta was good, but not special.

When all the restaurants on that street are open it transforms into a lively city secret.

When a restaurant accomplishes the point of it's staging you know it's gotta be good. They offer bread at the tables and it's amazing baguettes. Crunchy, and cloudy soft in the middle. They also give you a SOFT butter. I could sit there and just eat the bread all day.\n\nFor the menu it's filled with many traditional french options. I have had an amazing steak there.

The rabbit is just okay.  Not bad but not so good that I want to eat it again.\n\nMy wife had the mushroom crepe.  I liked how the crepe tasted but thought the cream filling was not creamy or buttery enough.\n\nIn conclusion, not a bad place to lunch every once in a while but not a regular nor a destination spot.", "author": "Willie L."}

You think you are saving money on the meal but by the time the tax, automatic 18% tip (for a waitress who didn't do anything except take our orders!), and previously unmentioned 4% SF mandate are through, the meal is very expensive and NOT worth what you paid. I would have paid the $39 for that meal but the additional $30 worth of charges was really frustrating. \n\nOur waitress sucked! She took our orders after we waited like 15 minutes and then we only saw her once after that and then again for the check. The bus boy/water/bread/food server guy did EVERYTHING except take the orders. He was very hard working and I am sad he wasn't an overall waiter. The food itself was just averagely good, definitely not worth $79. My boyfriend and I both got the French onion soup which was just okay. The broth was too sweet for me, not savory enough. I got the chicken tarjine which was actually really good, bf got the beef bourginoune (sp) which he said was pretty good. I wanted the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e mousse for dessert and the waitress gave me some weird lecture about how they don't have it and only have this triple chocolate mousse cake... It was weird because she was trying to lecture me that they had creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e mousse and not actual cake (which I knew), but then I discovered they didn't have anything remotely close to creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e! It was literally 3 layers of chocolate mousse, not the dessert I was told I could get. Not to mention it was a little rude for her to lecture me. Bf got raspberry key lime pie which he enjoyed.

With the groupon, I'd say what we paid is barely fair for what we received. We paid $39 for the groupon, then over $20 for tax + the tip they calculate in. \n\nThe mussels were the only thing of real worth- I got the ones in white wine. Solid flavor and barely any grit - can't complain. Would have paid the full $20 price for that one,...but then there was the rest of the meal. \n\nNo one here has quite explained why the French onion soup is \"bland\" though many have described it as such. Let me explain for us all: there are hardly any onions in the soup, there seems to be little to no seasoning, and the broth tastes very watered down. The bread and cheese on top was fine. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the duck confit dish which would have been nice if they hadn't put so much salt he complained in the car about his tongue feeling a bit numb (and I think we've all eaten that meal with too much salt that left us with a similar feeling so simply think back and decide not to order this if you go here)\n\nThe desserts were both overly sweet, and only tasted any good if you put the two together.\n\nThe service was pretty solid, but it should be if you are the only couple in the place for over half the meal. One star for the mussels and the other for service. The three missing stars for the sad choice of either overly salted / sweetened or empty of flavor dishes and the silly pricing.\n\nOh lastly, heads up for those trying to impress. The place looks a little run down, so not very visually impressive. Not relevant to the review, but worth to note in general I think.", "author": "Melissa C."}

She dismissively told us to sit anywhere because we had chosen to sit outside. She then yelled from inside that we can only sit in the green chairs. From the get-go, it just didn't feel professional. Unfortunately, she was also in charge of my table. She took our orders and we didn't see much of her throughout the dinner. \n\nI had ordered the French Onion Soup and Beef Stew, while my friend had ordered the Mesclun Salad and the Duck Confit. We both ordered the Chocolate Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e Mousse for dessert. I felt like the French Onion Soup was a bit on the sweet side, and the Beef Stew was a bit too salty, but the beef was so deliciously tender. I had to use the bread to balance out the saltiness of the beef. I had a bit of my friend's salad and that was absolutely delicious. The dressing was perfect. The duck was a bit salty yet tender as well, but the white beans were SO good. I was disappointed with the dessert. I thought I was getting an actual Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e because the menu didn't say it was mousse, but regardless, I found the mousse to be bland. It was just okay, nothing special, but not disgusting either.\n\nMy friend and I waited ten minutes for our check after our dessert plates were taken away, and she continued to be short and curt with us. It just gave us such a horrible vibe. We were also surprised at the 18% automatic gratuity charge for a party of 2 (because of the Groupon).\n\nOverall, the food was average, service was great because my water and bread basket was always filled, but the customer service was terrible because my server was rude and inattentive.\n\nBelden Pl is beautiful, but I would skip Cafe Bastille.

It was the most perfectly cooked and tender chicken, with the right amount of flavor. So, when I ordered the coq au vin at Cafe Bastille, I expected just that. Unfortunately, the chicken was on the dry side. The flavor was good, but with coq au vin, the chicken has to be right, too. Because I was distracted by the texture of the chicken, this dish was a 2.5 star rating.\n\nI also had a cocktail--Lola's French Kiss, recommended by the server because I didn't know what to order. I like chocolate, so I thought this would be a good drink. I'm sure the cocktail was delicious, but for me... Chocolate and vodka don't mix. Or maybe, there was more vodka flavor than there should be. I wish I had followed my intuition and just ordered the regular French Kiss. \n\nNow, you see that I've rated it 4 stars, though. Why? The service was great! The servers were super nice (and some were good-looking ;)...). And, also, the baguette they serve is the best baguette I've ever had. That really was the highlight of the meal. It came out fresh, and had the right balance of crisp on the outside and soft & dough-y on the inside.

The restaurant is located on a side street with several restaurants and the seating is mostly outside.  A bit cramped but ok.  The coupon gets you a 3 course Prix Fixe menu of soup or salad, limited main course choice and a desert.  This was for $49 for two people excluding tax, tip and drinks.  I had the salad which was ok.  My wife had the French onion soup which was ok.  They really let us down with the main courses.  My wife had the Coq au vin.  Very unflavorfull.  Boring.  My beef Bourguinon likewise lacked flavor or character of any kind.  The deserts were good, especially the chocolate one.  However, this was not enough to rescue the experience of the poor main courses provided on the Prix fixe menu.

I remembered a hilarious Mr. Bean sketch from my youth where Bean can't afford anything but steak tartare and is horrified when he finds it's raw. I guess that restaurant probably just made it terribly, or his English sensibilities didn't allow it. Because man, the tartare here was delicious. Soft, cold and delicious, with a bright rich flavor and a very pleasurable texture. It had lots of herbs, capers, onions and some citrus, I think lemon juice.

Not too overbearing but we weren't neglected sitting outside.  We started with the escargot which in comparison to Gamine which I had recently, I enjoyed much better.  The garlic oil that it's cooked in was delicious, something I wanted to keep dipping my bread in but I had to save myself for my meal.\n\nI had the mussels in the white wine sauce with the unlimited fries.  The mussels were tender, the broth it was cooked in was amazing, with a mix of bacon and mushrooms, very very good.  Also, in my opinion, better than Gamine.  Serving them with fries was I guess something very french, which I appreciated.  I definitely couldn't take advantage of the endless fries because I was so full but they were tasty, with a mayo to use as a dipping sauce.\n\nS had the duck confit while J had the Casoulet, both duck dishes but prepared differently.  I thought the duck confit was more tender and flavorful than the Casoulet but different preparations and personal taste.  Couldn't go wrong with either, plenty of duck to get full off.\n\nOverall, a great French experience for a reasonable price.  Couldn't really beat the food, if the parking and location was more convenient, def where I would go for my French fix.", "author": "Brian C."}

This was a delicious meal, but didn't hit the spot for me, hence the 3. Let me elaborate.\n\nFor starters we ordered crab cakes ($12). I heard they were good here from you guys. But...um...Though I appreciate their new take on crab cakes in the shape of crab croquettes or crab balls (maybe this is super French and I just don't know) this was very unexpected. The crab cake was only okay. It tasted fresh enough, and Amy remarked that she could really taste the crab. But I'd prefer to taste the crab with more herb flavoring (thyme for example) and did not. The crab cakes also came out with a smokey remoulade (sp), which was delicious, and a fennel salad, which was far too citrus-y for me.\n\nOriginally coming here for Dine About Town (DAT) the DAT menu stank compared to the menu itself. The menu's cheapest item is a crepe ($11), and most expensive item is steak (I forget, ~$30). I wanted something in-between. I chose the blood sausage since I never tried it before. It was crumbly, tender, OK. It tasted like meat yes... It was characteristically dark yes...But it was not \"omg delicious!\" The mashed potato-blood sausage-caramelized apple combo was pretty good, but after a couple of bites, flavors dulled. I much preferred Amy's dish, which was practically shepherd's pie (just made with ground beef instead of lamb). It was cheesy, hearty, and delish. Jen's crepe with ratatouille was surprisingly hearty and filling as well! My single taste left me with a good impression. It only cost $11. If I had to hand out a recommendation however, I would recommend ordering the shepherd's pie.\n\nNotes:\n**They also offer pate, but their pate is not homemade as we found out. Boo to that. Get it at a specialty grocery store yourself.\n\nSetting reminds me of NYC's Little Italy, except rather than all of the hosts being male (NYC), they're female (SF). Interesting difference... Moreover, everyone is bunched together in a tight space with both indoor and outdoor setting. Servers are zooming in and out, pouring water, collecting dishes. Everywhere outside of your meal is controlled mayhem! I personally prefer more space between tables (the table next to us was def eavesdropping!), but they don't go for \"space\" in an alley. \n\nThe dessert menu was \"eh.\" There is definitely room for improvement in that department.

Walking down the path having people ask me if I've selected a place to eat already.  Why, yes, I have, I'm going to Cafe Bastille.  \n\nThe Food  \nI'm particularly fond of the muscles there (the one in the bacon and creme sauce of course).  It's a good staple for me after a long day of dealing with graduate students and the clinically insane.  One night, I also had the bone marrow (to die for).  For desert, if you're a fan, i recommend the Creme Brulee. A m a z i n g.  \n\nThe Service, etc.  \nEvery time I've gone, my friends and I are greeted with that kind of warmth that makes you feel you're going to be well taken care of.  The decor is cute.  I like that they have a downstairs section.  I may even have my birthday party there.  The staff is attentive, especially the waiter I seem to get every time I go there, Anton.  My friends even make it a point to tell me that they thoroughly enjoy the service when they go there at other times as well.  \n\nI gave it five stars for the complete experience of the night.  My friends and I always arrive happy, and leave delighted and full.  There's no question whether I'll be back or not, the only question is how am I going to find a way to afford to eat there as often as I do being a student and all.", "author": "Nht N."}

It's not the coziest and I don't care for sitting downstairs or even even outside (except for those rare warm SF evenings), but the place still works. It's been pretty much the same the last 20 years and is probably the most authentic French cafe in this country, even down to the wait staff (although I've noticed a few \"foreigners\" , i.e. non-French, waiting on me lately). For years, the menu barely changed but in the last few there have been tweaking going on. For crepes, they are the best. My friend always orders the croque madam, always top notch. However, the most popular item for years, the chocolate mousse with orange peel shavings in it, was taken off the list a few years ago.

First off, it's reasonably priced with average portion size (despite unnecessarily large plates/bowls). We had a delicious salad with a deep fried poached egg as an appetizer. The egg was poached perfectly with a light, crisp exterior. We had the Pasti Prawns and the Boeuf Bourguinon. The prawns were delicious and the bourguinon was incredibly tender. We also had a chocolate pear tart which tasted as decadent as it sounded.\n\nDrinks! Cafe Bastille has a large selection of beer, liquor, and wine. We chose to go with the cocktails. I had the Speedy Gonzales which was very tasty! Despite made with tequila, it tasted surprisingly similar to a mojito. We also had a Le Parisien which was perfectly sweet while still feeling light.\n\nService was great- our server checked in on us regularly, was patient, and answered every question we had about the menu. The servers and staff were all extremely polite and helpful. We ended up staying about 25 minutes past closing, but they never interrupted us or hinted for us to leave.\n\nMy only negative critique would be the volume. Although having a fair amount of indoor space, the way the restaurant is laid out forces every table to be very close to each other (6 inches apart).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-13", "description": "I recently came to Cafe Bastille for my birthday dinner. I made a reservation for 12 and that evening, my sisters and a few of my friends arrived first and were seated at the table... which was on the patio. While making the reservation, I assumed that with such a large party and a large indoor dining area that we would be seated inside; however, I was wrong. I guess that's why people say that assuming makes an ass out of you AND me. If you're wondering if there were heaters, yes, there was ONE heater directed at our table which was sufficient for the first four members of my party, but as for the rest of us, we used our napkins as blankets. The pavement was extremely uneven causing the tables to be slanted. Not only that, but I felt like I was sitting on a rocking chair - that was a problem, particularly because I was in pumps. The restaurant was supposed to non-smoking, but we kept smelling smoke from the servers who were taking smoke breaks... I guess \"non-smoking\" must only apply to the inside of the restaurant. Anyway, that was strike 1.\n\nNow, for the food. The server brought us bread and butter, and the bread was cold and rock hard. The other tables in my party had softer bread, so we ended up stealing their bread until our food was brought out. For my entree, I ordered the lamb chop and to say the least, I left the restaurant dissatisfied and hungry. When the dish was brought out, it didn't look or smell too appealing. I learned that you should never judge a plate by its cover, so with that in mind, I cut into it and wish I had gone with my first instinct. The fennel on the plate was larger than the actual lamb chops, and there were so many green beans that it looked like it should have been the main course rather than the side. Both lamb chops were extremely chewy, dry, and gamey. The green beans were slathered in oil, and after taking a bite, I had a layer of oil on my lips. Needless to say, I was quick to toss the dish aside - Strike 2.\n\nFour of the people in my party ordered the Coq au Vin because I've had the dish at other restaurants and it has never failed me. Unfortunately, I was again, wrong. The dish came out with fettucini noodles when the menu stated it would be served with egg noodles which I found odd. Anyway, the chicken itself was dry and the sauce did not help that issue. The only good thing from that dish was probably the mushrooms, which is sad.\n\nThe service was also mediocre. The server kept reaching over my head and running into my chair which resulted in the two hind legs of my chair being lifted off the pavement and me bumping into the table.. constantly. I mean yes, I'm a petite girl, but reaching over my head without a saying \"Excuse me\" was just completely rude. Oh and my friend who ordered the mussels and bottomless french fries requested a second basket of french fries which came out AFTER the bill had already been given to us... um, okay? I guess we should be happy they still gave them to us. This was strike 3.\n\nThe vast majority of my party drove from San Jose and had never tried French cuisine before, so it was unfortunate that this was their first experience. I was already pretty embarrassed when I discovered that we were sitting outside on an uneven pavement when we were expecting a nice restaurant so needless to say, I was even more embarrassed when they described the food as \"interesting\" and left dissatisfied.

SCORE! Since the other restaurants next door were either packed or required us to sit outside which we did not approve of we came knocking on the door of Cafe Bastille.\n\nWe got seated in a hidden corner of the restaurant. It was such a tight spot that the hostess had to pull the table out allow us to sit and push the table back...um CLAUSTROPHOBIA?!?!\n\nAn Asian waiter soon came speaking something in French gibberish. We ordered our food 3 Madame Monsieur and the Quiche of the day (blue cheese & ham). I had the Quiche. The bread came cold, nothing special. The food took a while. Everything looked delicious. The Madame came with only salad whereas the Quiche had fries and salad. Although we thought the Madame also came with fries. My Quiche was decent very blue cheesy, I love cheese don't get me wrong by the cheese was too pungent for my taste. I still scarfed it down, don't waste food!\n\nMy coworkers thoroughly enjoyed their Madam Monsieur even though the contents would probably require a triple bypass shortly after-- it looked amazing. \n\nThe service was exceptionally slow (we blame it on the European) we waited probably 20 minutes for our food and another 15 minutes for the bill to come even though we flagged down our waiter. When you're in a rush to get back to the office, this is a big no no.\n\nOverall the food was decent but I've had better, cue Cafe Claude.

In fact, when we get those rare days where it's going to be nice in the evening in SF we nearly always go here.  Not anymore.  The details:\n\nAppetizer: Mussels...not great.   The sauce was bland.\nBread: OK, but closer to the stale side (good for sauce dipping though) than the \"good\" side.\nSteak Fritte: Not good.  The meat itself had almost no taste and was tougher than it should have been.\nDuck confit: Pretty good actually.  Very small piece of duck, but in terms of the finish...it was pretty good.  The swiss chard side was very good.\n\nService: They were pretty busy, but the service quality was not reflective of their business.  A quick example was ordering sauce on the side and having it served on the steak.  I like a lot of water...so on the positive side...the guy bringing the water was awesome and kept my glass full.\n\nGood wines as well...\n\nAll in, Cafe Bastille will not be on our \"nice weather in the evening in SF\" list anymore.

We were a group of at least 12 each time and elected to do the prix fixe menu - $46.95 for a 3 course menu with unlimited house wine. I love the french onion soup, moules (mussels) with white wine sauce, and the poulet au cidre (braised chicken with pearl onions). I must warn you though - their house wine is strictly limited to chardonnay and shiraz and while it is constantly flowing, it is either poor quality or watered down or both, because after many rounds, we were sober. \n\nAMBIANCE:\nCharming, and classier than the other joints on Belden Lane. Affordable French, and louder, so good for lively groups. I like sitting on the patio, but that gets claimed early on, so get there on time, or specify it when making the reservation. \n\nSERVICE:\nThere was definitely a stark contrast between our experience the first time - giving us reason to come back for dinner this time around and this past Friday. I don't know if it was a brand new group of servers and managers but it was a joke. Normally, most restaurants staff their A team on a Friday night because of the dinner rush and we arrived beyond the dinner rush (at 8:30pm) and it was not crowded. Our group was comprised of the most laidback people I know, and it was a common sentiment experience across the board. For starters, we requested the patio, and the hostess conveniently left it off the reservation notes, and they weren't very accommodating about it. There was tons of confusion and our group of 15 was definitely not their first priority. We were seated downstairs, but that resulted in being ignored for the first 15 minutes. Drinks took forever, the server was rude and not flexible on anything, and definitely did not know how to explain menu offerings. She also didn't let us know what was available/not for the evening. C'mon lady - the menu is not THAT large. \n\nOVERALL:\nThere were many periods of delay and the service was not a smooth one. Getting up to run upstairs to ask for refills is not how I wanted to spend my dinner. And the rudeness throughout our meal will give me reason to really think twice before returning. Pricing was fair (but I think it went up recently) for the amount we drank, but the quality was subpar. This was my best friend's birthday dinner with family members that traveled long distances to come celebrate, and I wish I had chosen another restaurant.", "author": "Tammy H."}

Before my mom and I got there we accidently went to the one next to it which smelled weird but as we were directed to the real cafe bastille we chose to sit outside as the interior of their cafe was sort of dark and tacky. The prices are pretty over average but for god sakes it's wonderful French food where you didn't have to fly to France but just travel downtown! All in all it was great for somewhere to eat once in awhile.", "author": "Mermaid K."}

The glass of champagne was flat, and had to be sent back.  One of the entrees was a mushroom fettuccine that was striking for its mediocrity.   The meager sauce was flavorless and in lieu of many mushrooms, there was spinach thrown in, for no apparent reason.  (Color, perhaps? Not good enough.)  The other entree was a filet mignon, which was fine, but it was supposed to be accompanied by truffled potatoes rissole.  The potatoes didn't appear to have been near butter, oil, or truffles, but instead were hard, dry and diced.  The service was graceless.  A knife had to be borrowed from another table but then instead of adjusting the place settings, we were questioned about it.  The bread basket was moved hastily from the side of our table that almost conjoined another and plopped  thoughtlessly atop the rim of bread plates so another couple could sit down because they'd squeezed the tables too closely together, (but then the other couple decided to eat inside anyway).  We were repeatedly asked if we had finished when we clearly still had food on our plates. The only thing this restaurant has going for it is that it's in Belden Place, and you can sit outside and feel that you're having a Parisian cafe experience.  However, five minutes into the food and flat champagne, all you've got are the legendary rude waiters to make you think of Paris...and even they are never so graceless as these.", "author": "Margaret S."}

Oh yeah, our discovery!!\n\nSo we wanted to go grab lunch and catch up and I threw out sushi. But as anyone who works in the Financial District knows, there isn't exactly a huge array of tasty sushi options around. Pssst, Financial District, get on that! And so after checking out one place but finding it had no seating, we decided to change gears and search for something else. \n\nAs we walked down a street looking at random signs, we both happened to look to our left and whoa, what was that? Is that Paris? Is that New York? Is that a siesta in Spain? Whatever it was, we were going! And so we walked down the alley to this adorable little outdoor cafe area! :) \n\nLucky for us there was a table available and so we grabbed it and checked out the venue. They offered up a prix fixe menu with an appetizer and main meal and a glass of vino and can you say, sold? :) I can. I went with the French Onion soup and it was pretty amazing. i really liked that it wasn't too salty and not super beefy tasting. I usually order this soup at most French restaurants and you would be amazed how many places fail to deliver the goods. Bastille, did a nice job.\n\nI also ordered the Croque Madam, because there clearly wasn't enough cheese in my soup (sheesh, haha, pig). When it arrived, oh my, what a large sammich of cheese and ham and a fried egg. When i cut into it, it was good, but I have to say the Croque Madam at Foreign Cinema trumps this one any day! THAT is a CM, while this was more like a cm. Get my drift ;)\n\nThe other Stephanie ordered the goat cheese salad and it looked deelish and upon her urging I tried a little piece of the bread that came with hers and it had not just goat cheese on it, but butter to boot and how are you really gonna go wrong with that!! She also ordered the prosciutto sammich and that looked good as well.\n\nAll in all, it was a delightful lunch with the other Steph and I definitely enjoyed our time together :)", "author": "Stephy S."}

My boyfriend, who is French, is often surprised by my constant desire to try French restaurants here in the city.  We've had some good experiences, but I think that we've also had some mediocre ones.  I am always hopeful.\n\nI had never been to Cafe Bastille prior to my spontaneous \"date\" with my boyfriend. I thought it would be great to sit with my authentically French boyfriend and share authentically French food and drink.  \nHow wrong I was.\n\nFor 2 individuals, the total, after tax, but prior to tip was $94.12.\n\nFor this amount we got:\n1- kir royale type of drink (le parisien) = $11.00\n1- french onion soup for my boyfriend (lots of cheese and breadlike topping, but very LITTLE soup).  = $7.50\n1-Mixed green salad (dripping in disgusting, oily, flavorless salad dressing) = $7.75.\n1 duck breast main dish for my boyfriend (tasted gamey) = $22.00\n1 NY steak with peppercorn sauce (too much sauce with too much PEPPER...they ruined a perfectly cooked piece of meat) = $23.00\n1 glass of Cabernet = $8.50\n1 chocolate crepe (could have gotten a much better one at SOPHIES CREPES in Japantown, of all places) = $7.00\n\nIn addition, we sat outside around a cafe table that was precariously perched on a downward incline.  So, I was worried that my food would slide off the table.  Unfortunately, the lopsided table was the least of our worries b/c we watched as the disorganized wait staff mixed up a multitude of orders while we were forced to inhale smoke from locals smoking right next to the cafe seating partition.

After scouring over yelp reviews, I decided that Cafe Bastille would be my best bet.  The experience overall was pretty good.\n\nThe AMBIANCE:\nA friend of mine was in town so I wanted to take her somewhere interesting.  Also gave me a perfect opportunity to cross another restaurant off my bookmarks.  The alley was very quaint and reminiscent of Europe.  Im always a fan of bringing something different or interesting to my dining experience.  \n\nThe FOOD:\nWe weren't that hungry so we decided to share the Prix Fixe Lunch and the mussels that were raved about so much.  For the Prix Fixe, we ordered a French Onion Soup and the Croquet Madame.  \n\n- I thoroughly enjoyed the FRENCH ONION SOUP.  Often times, french onion soup is too salty IMO, but it was great here.  \n- The CROQUET MADAME was delicious.  I was a bit skeptical when I read about what it was.  Am I really going to pay that much for a Ham and Cheese Sandwich, EVEN if they give me an egg?!  Its definitely not your run-of-the-mill ham and cheese sandwich.  I enjoyed it and definitely would come back for it.  \n- The MUSSELS were a bit disappointing.  Very small mussels.  The size reminded more of clams.  The sauce was good, but I was expecting more given the hype from the yelp reviews.\n\nWe opted to share dessert last minute and ordered the special Nutella Crepe they were offering.  The first time the crepe came out, it was missing Nutella!  The same thing happened to the table next to us.  However, they were very kind and gave everyone a free glass of port.  It went very well with the nutella. \n\nThe SERVICE:\nService was great.  Very polite and hospitable staff.  I have always been fond of French accents.  Haha maybe its just me, but every girl I know that speaks with a French accent sounds exactly like my girl cousin from Belgium.\n\nOVERALL:\nDefinitely would come back here.  The food is not mindblowing, but its good and its a cool place to go.  Makes it a nice place to take a girl you want to \"hang out\" with.  You know... the point before a real \"formal\" date.  Have a nice friendly lunch in a place that is nice to have a long conversation with someone.  Maybe I'm just biased because I was in good company.", "author": "Bert N."}

Then, the bartender upstairs started to play horrible French house music (remember, this is a restaurant, not a club) and neglected to realize that the speakers downstairs, where we were eating, were turned up exceptionally loud.  It was absolutely miserable and almost twenty minutes later when our waiter decided to grace us with his presence for only the second time after about an hour, we had to ask to turn the music down because he apparently couldn't tell that it was atrocious.\n\nThe food: so-so at best.  To start, by boyfriend and I had the escargots de bourgogne, which was ok and not nearly as good as that of some of the neighboring French restuarants (I won't name names).  My mother and boyfriend had the steak entree.  My mother's was fine but my boyfriend had to send his back because it wasn't cooked properly (it was completely purple and cold  inside, when he ordered \"medium\").  I had the Coq au Vin.  The presentation was awful (messy, and drenched in sauce).  Taste was ok.  Quite simply I've had much, much better.  And the desserts were good, but nothing to report home about.\n\nI guess overall the restaurant is a good representation of authentic French cuisine, which from my experience is typically simple, without all the bells and whistles that French Restaurants in the US use (which I happen to enjoy).  If you are looking for a place that is \"very French,\" has a Parisian atmosphere (think house music, coupled with outdoor seating and poor service), and so-so food, then this is the place for you!  I don't think I will ever go back.  There are way too many good french restaurants in the city to waste your time on this one.", "author": "Lauren W."}

Very nice ambiance outside; heated, live music (violin & accordion); not too loud. \n\nThe food was pretty much the single best French cuisine I've ever had. We had scallops as an appetizer, lightly seared & perfectly cooked. \nFor the main course I had salmon with small potatoes & spinach. My girlfriend had the filet mignon with scalloped potatoes & cremini mushrooms. Both dishes were seasoned perfectly to let the flavors of the actual ingredients be the main elements you taste. \nFor desert (obviously) creme brulee; so delicious. Very rich & creamy on the inside, the top was perfectly crispy with a raspberry. 1 is enough for 2 people, but you have to get it - even if you're too full.\n\nThe only semi negative I would say was, the outside seating was a little crowded, but the inside was fairly empty which had normal seating/spacing. If there isn't a lot of people sitting outside at the same time the seating is fine. The food more than makes up for the tight quarters & with a couple glasses or wine or beer you'll make friends fast. Good food always makes everyone friendlier.", "author": "Rohnny J."}

A decently stocked bar. No unnecessary decor, a few amusing pop art posters. Little stairs that go to who knows where. Most of the seating is outside in the charming patio aka the alley, which is brightly lit with hanging lights. A secluded world in the midst of the financial center, a sparkling bubble that lets you know that you have a cozy place to escape to in the middle of fake money-waving formality.\n\nI hate pretentiousness with a passion, and there's no room for it here. It's good bistro fare with no pretending or pressure. Take a smoke break between courses, enjoy an amusingly cheesy named cocktail, it's about the society, and loving it with food. No formalities, and that is a very welcome luxury I long for. \n\nThey serve good foie gras terrine, and the blood sausage entree with roasted apples and potatoes was very heartwarming.\n\nWith my personal tastes, I can see myself enjoying a fun romantic date here far more than any 5-star restaurant where they fold your napkins for you every time you get up from the table. This place is not for the common diner, but for someone who loves a quirky atmosphere that one finds in the least expected places.", "author": "Daria J."}

Might I add this is my first Yelp review.\n\nFirst, let me begin by saying that by no means did I expect stellar service on a Friday night on Belden Lane, but certainly I expected more than what we got, which was NOTHING!\n\nOur server was completely absent and didn't seem to give two sh**s about us, as his tables around us enjoyed all their courses and continued to leave as we sat there still waiting for our food to be delivered. Water didn't even get to the table until after we placed our order! Our first round of drinks arrived, but then our glasses sat empty until almost the end of the meal. He never checked in with us to see if we needed anything or to see if we even liked our food (which was mediocre, at best). Our busser was the most attentive one, as he refilled our water and re-marked our table for main courses.\n\nFinally, I was fed up and irritated. I walked up to the front desk and asked another employee to please send over a manager to our table. About 10 minutes passed when someone finally arrived. I explained to him how disappointed we were in the service, and he simply mumbled an apology and walked away, never to return to offer anything in reciprocation. Nothing. Totally unacceptable.\n\nWe finally asked for our check and, much to our surprise, nothing was comped off the check. We left paying the full check and a small tip (my friend took some pity).\n\nNever, never, never again. This is San Francisco, dammit!

Started with the onion soup, which was delicious and had a sweet flavor from the onions actually being carmelized instead of just tossed into the broth. Main course was beef bourguignon, and let me tell you, it doesn't get better than this. The pieces of beef were so tender they melted in your mouth, and the array of vegetables that come with are all perfectly cooked. The best part is that the cooking sauce (made with red wine) is distinctive, but subtle. So when you're eating a carrot, it tastes like a carrot. When you're eating a mushroom, it tastes like a mushroom. All with the undercurrent of the red wine sauce flavor. Most places cook everything together for so long it all tastes the same. Not here. We were huge fans! Desserts were tasty (I had the key lime raspberry mousse, which was a little too tart but still yummy enough that I wanted to lick the plate). The service is impeccable and the staff super friendly. We had a lengthy chat with the host (a Parisian) about our many trips to Paris and the foods we love. He even took time to talk about the other restaurants on Belden Place and recommended others to try. I honestly felt like I was back in Paris (my favorite place in the world).

I absolutely could not decide what to order- everything from the savory crepes to the grilled steak sandwich to the hot dog in a baguette made my mouth water. \n\nI decided on rock shrimp sauteed with fresh vegetables over a thin pastry with a balsamic reduction. The asparagus, zucchini, and mushrooms were perfectly cooked to a crisp, sauteed with large rock shrimp. The sweet balsamic reduction complimented the shrimp and veggies seasoning perfectly.

The setting is fairly cozy though, with a long bench on both sides of the room, tables pressed against that with chairs on the outside and a attractive looking bar anchoring the entrance.  Lighting is soft, music is more the 'this is what Europe must be like' sort.\n\nWhile I am quietly poking fun at the inauthentic authenticness of the place, I really have to say I enjoyed the dish I got a lot.  Don't bother with the expensive $20+ items as they didn't seem to be all that impressive based on my observation (granted, I didn't order one, just gandered at other people's dishes) but stick with the $14-20 items.  I got the Mussels, which were $14.25.  Based on the place, and the menu price scale, I figured I'd get a small dish with about 8 mussels on it.  Wrong.  The dish was HUGE and had dozens of mussels, all nicely prepared sitting in a tasty broth.  A side of french fries was also included (real French, I'm sure).  \n\nFor that dish alone, I give this place three stars.  Like I said, the decor was nothing to get excited about and lost points for trying to hard to be Epcot Center at Disney World.  The service was pretty good, but I really give most of the credit to the bus boys for that as they were constantly filling my water glass and were quick to clear the table.

After getting the brash hard sell from the hostess at Brindisi, and seeing all the heavy pasta and meat dishes at the other restaurants, I settled in at a small table at Cafe Bastille.\n\nTheir menu is nice but looked too heavy for a hot night.  Blood sausage and the other offerings were just going to be too much.  The waitress approached and I wistfully told her that due to the hot weather I had just been looking for a simple salade nicoise, which was not on the menu.  And having lived in France I wasn't sure that the chef would happily whip something up on the spot that was not listed.\n\nWell, my dear waitress said - they serve it for lunch, let me ask the chef.

Oh, don't forget the adorable little cornichons.  I did my very best to polish it off but the serving was huge.  I left absolutely satisfied and happy, feeling perhaps even a bit like a celebrity because they made a custom dish just for me.\n\nThanks to the staff at Cafe Bastille for accommodating my request.

We both ordered the french onion soup.  She had the crouque madame and I had the special pasta with blue cheese sauce.\n\nThe soup was not good.  It certainly didn't taste like any other french onion soup I have had here or in France.  It was bland instead of a rich broth.  Outback Steakhouse' was much better.  I finished mine, but she hardly touched her's.  I was disappointed that the server who cleared the soup bowls didn't notice that her's was barely touched.\n\nFor our entrees, her sandwich was very cheesy and there should be more ham.  The only complaint I had with my pasta was that it was too cheesy, but that is easily remedied.  We paid about $55 total (including tax and tip) for lunch.  The money could've been spent better.", "author": "SF P."}

Having no need to go down to this part of town anymore I had no clue where we were going. I then realized it was THE Cafe Bastille. That was surprise #1.\n\nSuprise #2 came when the hostess who was about to seat us said OH HEY! Upon close examination I realized it was a girl I had known since the age of 2, gone to school with for all \"13\" grades, had a falling out of sorts with, heard things about her post HS life, and not spoken to or seen in 4 years. Awkward? A bit. We said hello, and caught up for a few minutes then the managers sent us complimentary drinks because we knew someone who worked there.\n\nSurprise #3 the food. Very simple but nice french food. I ordered the salmon, which is not normal as I don't usually go for it but something called me. It was nice, flaky, not fatty, but still moist. I have a goat cheese problem, which made the pastry puff wrapped goat cheese part of the draw.

The decor is cute, very cozy with whimsical posters and pictures covering the walls.  They had outdoor seating, which would be perfect for a warm summer night.  We were seated downstairs since we had 10 people in our party.  We occupied half of the downstairs eating area.  Our friends had a little toddler and requested a hi-chair.  But, they only had one available and the table next to us was using it.  The waiter told us they were leaving soon, so we could have then. \n\nIt was also Dine about Town, so I went with their 3 course menu.  For my first course, I had the salmon tartare.  This was OK, nothing really memorable or exciting.  My hubby got the french onion soup and it was a bit salty and not cheesy enough.  For the main course, I had the duck confit cassoulet.  It came with sausages and white beans.  What a disappointment!  The overall dish was so salty that I couldn't taste anything else.  And it wasn't just my dish, everyone else that had the cassoulet complained about the overwhelming amount of salt they put in the dish.  My friend said it was so salty it stung his chapped lips.  LOL. Hubby got the coq au vin and was so excited about it, but oh man, what a disappointment.  The chicken was so dried, it reminded me of the leftover meat (that no one eats) from my mom's soup that had been cooking for 4 hours.  He couldn't even finish his dinner and kinda picked at it with his fork all night.  Finally, our dessert came and I either had the chocolate tart or creme brulee.  I tried both and they were fine and probably the best part of our dinner.  On a positive note, we had a drink at the bar before dinner and the bartender was really nice and even made my friend's drink stronger because it was her birthday.

Tomato and mozzarella is like a 2 legged tripod without basil.  Or maybe it's that tomato, mozarella, and basil is one those ultra ultimate combinations.  Either way, there was no basil on my salad.\n\nSo I wrote what I would consider a pretty mean review for me - yet you're probably wondering why the 3 stars?  Well, we were a party of 20, and the waiter still put up with us with a smile, that deserves 3 stars all on its own.", "author": "Audrey T."}

The food is nothing to get too excited about, but is still very good none the less. Once you smell the bread, you know that it will be delicious. The appetizers and entrees are good, nice taste, but not amazing. The staff seems nice enough, the bar is really lack luster and not too many choices.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-12", "description": "I love Belden place.  It really feels like Paris to me.  I chose Cafe Bastille for my birthday a couple years ago, and I was not disappointed.\n\nI don't think that we had a reservation, but it didn't matter, because I think it was a Thursday night, and it was only my husband and I.  Would have liked to dine outside, but this September was without Indian Summer.  To my surprise, we were lead in side to a table near the bar to see a small jazz combo setting up.  They were very good, and thankfully not so load as to inhibit conversation.\n\nThis was also a birthday of firsts.  This is the first place where I learned to love Walnuts.  We ordered the lovely cheese and fruit plate as an appetizer, which is one of the things that sticks out most in my memory.  There was this creamy and wonderfully tangy goat cheese that paired very nicely with their candied walnuts, which were a far cry from the dry almost rancid ones that have always kept me from liking them.  I got the Grilled Salmon (which is different from the version on their menu now ... no prawns) which was perfectly cooked and was in every way comparable to the salmon I had in Paris.  My husband ordered the fillet Mignon with foie gras and frites.  This was also the my first time trying foie gras, which always sounded gross to me, but it was smooth and velvety, almost like the goat cheese, but more savory.  The steak was juicy and flavorful.\n\nVaguely remember ordering dessert ... flourless chocolate cake for me, and a colonel for the guy (lime sorbet with vodka).  I'm sure it was tasty, but it was two years ago so ... Ooops.  Maybe I will go back, and try again.\n\nOk ... here is my obligatory plug for us flourless folk.  French food is always a little difficult to navigate, since they want to give you a baguette with everything.  However, looking over their current menu, I see a few things that seem safe.  As usual, ask for no bread, and inquire about the thickening agent in sauces, and avoid pasta.  My dinner here was before I knew for sure that I couldn't have Gluten products, so I didn't ask.  If I ever get the chance return, I will certainly update this review with staff responses/attitudes upon being asked.", "author": "Karly L."}

One of my bfs took me here for a very late birthday dinner last night.   When we arrived, there was only outdoor seating immediately available so we sat right next to their heat lamp.  The host and waitress were both very gracious and assured us a couple of times that if we got too cold, they would move us in right away.  \n\nWe started with two appetizers: foie gras and the escargot.  I wasn't...well never was....a fan of the escargot.  I can't feel happy knowing I'm eating snail.  The foie gras is highly recommended.  It was a nice generous portion and it was very good.  It was served with candied walnuts and pear with a port reduction. YUM-O!  I selected the salmon as an entree and friend had the coq au vin pasta.  My salmon probably could have been more moist but the sauce and the mushroom were amazing.  Friend really enjoyed the coq au vin...I had a small piece but can't really remember it.  The service was great.  The waitress and host checked on us numerous times and made sure our water was filled.  The location itself is really small and crowded.  I can assume it's pretty happening on a Friday night.  \n\nWe discovered from our waitress that the owner of Bastille also owns Plouf an B44.  I'd like to try the other places.

It was prepared a little differently than I  learned it; I make it open faced on one piece of bread, they put the ham between two pieces, and topped it with the egg and white sauce.  But I'm going to assume their way is right.  In any case, it was nom-nom.  The salad that came with it was pretty meh, but I could care less.\n\nBonus points for making me believe everyone that worked there was actually French.

We arrived a half hour early for our 6 pm reservation and since  hardly anyone was there  they said they would seat  us,,,even though there were several tables empty indoors  they insisted that we either sit downstairs alone or outside in the patio where only one other table was occupied.   we asked to be seated at a table for four (even though there was just two of us)  since the place was empty and the tables for two were quite small. NOOOO  they refused again , I mean NO ONE was there,  That to me indicated poor service  and we had not even received water..  With the Groupon we were allowed to order from the 3 course prix fixed courses  Both of us ordered the French onion soup  which was quite nice  and i ordered the rabbit  and my dinner mate ordered the Duck confit with sausages. Both entrees were very enjoyable  but  extremely rich  that was hard to finish.  Another couple arrived  and they tried to seat them  at a table for two right next to our table , kind of ridiculous since the restaurant was still empty  but the couple refused and they moved them to another table. For dessert  i had the Brulee and my dinner mate had the key lime mousse  both  were enjoyable but not memorable.  Finally another table was occupied about that time.  I was still confused as to why were no allowed to eat indoors  as not one table was occupied the entire time we were there...very strange.  The entire experience was over shadowed by very poor service...we had to ask for a bread plates.  The hald carafe of wine for $18  was  din other words boring.  When the bill arrived i noticed we were taxed on the entire $70  and not the amount of the coupon $39..I expected to pay a tax on the  $39 plus the cost of the wine.

I'd been here once before for a friends privately held 30th birthday, but never for a real meal, so i suggested we walk no further and 8 of us sat down for a lovely meal. We were sat outside on a gorgeous night at a table big enough for all of us within 5 minutes which i found to be a sign that we had chosen wisely.\nAll of our entree's were cooked to perfection.  The medium strip steak was perfectly medium.  My roasted salmon was cooked medium rare per my request, and was served over these amazing polenta squares and topped with a goat cheese puff pastry that left my sweet tooth satisfied so when the time for dessert came around i didn't need any.  I also had a bite of the scallop pasta of the day, the portabella mushroom, as well as the duck....all of which i would have been happy with had they been my meal.\nWith wine, dessert for the table, and all of our entree's we left there lacking the huge hole in my wallet i had expected.

I don't like to give bad reviews but I've had much better French food in SF and in France where I've spent many months. We used a Groupon for the three course meal. The salad dressing was uninspired; the onion soup just okay with a slight burnt taste. The cassoulet was tasty (and probably the best thing we had) and the fresh warm bread was divine. The Boeuf Bourguignone came as an ample portion, tender beef and a flavorful sauce but it was not the richness I expect - perhaps not enough fat or salt for my taste. It seemed like a nutritionist had adjusted the recipes to be lower fat for heart health, which is not what I'm looking for on an occasional dinner out. The desserts were deceiving. Chocolate Creme Brulee and Raspberry Key Lime Mousse were actually squares of cake with some a mousse layer and were sweeter than dessert you'd find in France.

It was the worst french onion soup that I ever taste. Even a place like Tony Roma's makes a better french onion soup than Cafe Bastille. Even the frozen ones from Costco taste better than this. I only had two spoons of the broth and decided not to bother with it. The broth was bland, no taste and I could barely see any cheese on top. For a good french onion soup, Chez Maman at Potrero Hills still on top of my list. For main course, I ordered rabbit stew. This is the main reason I choose Cafe Bastille from Plouf. What a mistake! I am still wondering whether they served me rabbit instead of chicken. The meat tasted like chicken white meat. Dry. The creamy sauce was lack of flavor. I read the other review mentioned that the rabbit stew was too rich. Made me wonder if I came at the wrong night. Most likely since the restaurant was empty on Monday night.

I have to say that the wait staff is not accommodating, but then again---they're French! The food is good, and when I say good it's not because there isn't any other way to describe it, but because it's not mediocre and it's not flashy and will not grab your attention but you will want to eat it again. I like coming here because of the seating arrangements. Being able to see the people walking into the street of Belden to see what restaurant they want to eat at brings an atmosphere reminiscent of France itself. Just be sure to be confident of your order and treat the servers as they treat you and all will be fine. The attitude of \"get your order out because I have others to wait on\" is fine by me because they get the \"I don't care how you serve me because I'm paying and you know it and I'm American\" attitude. \n\nBe prepared to spend for your foie gras and pinot gris because unlike France, this place can be a little pricy. I mean this because even the cheap bottles of pinot gris/pinot blanc in France are good ;-)\n\nOh, and don't order the chocolate crepe. Get a Tawny port instead.", "author": "Vince C."}

There were 10 of us and we got seated fairly on time and our outdoor seating preference was honored. The waiter we had seemed quite impatient though when we asked for wine recommendations and just in general. Also, a couple of us decided to share so after placing the orders, two of us switched seats. When the food came out, the busboy got confused for a minute and instead of asking for our help and remaining calm, he rolled his eyes and was quite annoyed.\n\nThe wine was OK but I expect that at French restaurants as I've got more of a California wine palate. I split a salad with my roomie and it wasn't bad but nothing super exciting. I can't even remember what was in it - that's how memorable it was...then we split an entree as well as the lamb shank they advertise on their website wasn't available and it's what I wanted. I think we split the scallops? Gee, I can't remember what the meat was but that there were carrots and steamed new potatoes involved. Somehow scallops rings a bell...just for the record I wasn't drunk or on drugs and this dinner took place a little over 3 days ago...the only thing I remember clearly is the unfriendly wait staff and the ambiance which was awesome.

Although it was a nice night, we asked to sit inside because it's quieter, warmer, and doesn't smell of cigarette smoke like it did outside. The waiter and waitress were a little hard to understand because of their French accents. We had a party of 5 and four of us ordered the pre-fixe menu which came with soup or salad, an entree, and a dessert for $25. \n\n2 of us had the Tomato Basil soup, which was nice and creamy. 2 had the French Onion soup. The soup was a little lighter than usual soup, and had more cheese than usual. I ordered the crepe with ratatouille and chicken, which was pretty good. It had a lot of vegetables, which I like. My friend ordered the crepe with chicken and mushroom, which came with a cream sauce, but I liked mine better. Tip: The crepeps come with a little side salad on the plate, so you can order the soup and still get a salad with your entree! Two people had the beef bourgeouine, which just looked like a beef and vegetable stew. I think they said it was pretty good.\n\nFor dessert, two of us ordered the strawberry tart, which was delicious. It was light and drizzled with nutella. Two people ordered the flourless chocolate cake, which basically tasted like chocolate ganache.\n\nMinus stars: Since the downstairs is a little narrow, it was a tight fit with the table on the other side. They seated a table of 13 directly behind us and the waiters barely had enough room to squeeze between my chair and the chair behind me. Which led to the constant kicking and bumping of my chair while I was eating. If they knew the party of 13 was coming, they could have sat us somewhere else. We were the only 2 parties in the entire floor. \n\nAlso, they had the little tealight and candle holders from Ikea. Which probably sets a nice atmosphere, but is probably a fire hazard. There were about 3 times when the waiter/busboy was pick up plates that I swear his sleeve was almost going to catch on fire.\n\n\nAll in all, the food was pretty good, but the cramped space and constant bumping in an otherwise available room hurt their rating.", "author": "T C."}

He gave us a beet and goat cheese Napoleon on the house which was \"to die for.\"  A stack of beet slices layered with the cheese.  I had the marrow bones on toast points.  The bones were about 4 inches long, sawed down the middle.  The marrow could easily be spread like jam.  Rich, but oh so good.  The huge bowl of mussels mariniere  with French fries (came extra crispy as ordered) were fresh and succulent.  I ordered the Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was good, but my wife had the standout winner chocolate pear tart.

Pretty sad for a French restaurant.  then after watching everyone who came in after us receive their meals, I finally had to call the waiter over and ask why a salad was taking so long.  He apologized and went upstairs and came back down immediately back with our meals.  Too little too late.  We asked for them to be packed up to go because, well we working class people only get 1 hour for lunch. (Imagine that!)  We then went back up stairs to the living and paid the check.  Another set back, very expensive especially for the terrible service.  I was handed my salad in a bag, which was boxed and not even closed, and was told to have a nice day.  Really?  Seriously?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-04-04", "description": "Here's my theory on all the restaurants lining the little alley of Belden Place in San Francisco.  This is a San Francisco version of the International Food Court at any suburban mall.  Cafe Bastille came recommened with the promise of the \"essence\" of Parisian sidewalk dining.  Ok, it has tables on the sidewalk and it does serve French food.  But it is overpriced, service is sloppy, and the food is not first rate.  And, if one bothers to walk inside, it looks far from clean!  Read:  tourist trap.  Cafe Bastille might work for a warm afternoon lunch if you happen to catch an entree that was carefully prepared, but don't go out of your way.  Much better places in the neighborhood to try.", "author": "Billy Dee R."}

I had been a long time customer of theirs from my teenage years when I'd visit my mom during her lunch hours away from her banking woes.  \n  Alas, I went to France, had a taste of the real thing, and didn't return to little ol' Bastille for some time.  Its flavor had dwindled and dishes there seemed over played and its flavors underdeveloped.  For a time, I avoided it and would go to Claude (still a place I'd recommend over Bastille any day regardless of giving them the same rating).  However, recently all has seemingly changed.  \n  Maybe they hired a new cook or the old one got smart but the last time I went Bastille redeemed itself in my eyes.  The onion soup was back to its old self and, out of the blue, you offered Coq au Vin.  I took a chance and never regretted it.  It was wonderful, the chicken was excellent and the dish well thought out.  I was wrong about Bastille, but it took them time.  I hope to eat there again and again in the future!", "author": "Scott N."}

The drinks are not that special.\nAmbiance- Cozy and colorful\nService- Yummy french server : 9\n\nJoie de vivre:\nBelden Place is just lovely. I'm enamored by European (especially French) culture, and this little alley is the closest I'd get to being in Europe (for now). My dining experience here was amazing. I made a reservation for 10 for my 21st birthday. We were taken to a cozy private room downstairs. The decor on the walls were appropriately French.\nThe drink menu wasn't all that appealing. I didn't know what to order as this was my first legal drink, and ended up with something I didn't enjoy. Poop. But that's okay because the food was amazing! I shared the Onion Soup ($6) with my boyfriend and it was a concoction of cheesy goodness. For starters, we had the Dungeness Crab Cake ($10), the Escargots ($9.25), and the Mariniere (mussels) ($13). I didn't care too much for the crab cakes but the escargot and mussels tasted fresh and delicious. My boyfriend and I shared the Grilled Atlantic Salmon served with a Risotto Cake and Sauteed Mushrooms ($16.50) and the Grilled New York Steak served with Sauteed Garlic Potatoes ($18.50). I had the steak medium rare and it was so tender and juicy. Some of my friends had the Andouillette with Mashed Potatoes ($12.75) and weren't fans. : (\nBecause it was my birthday, our server brought me a complimentary slice of flourless chocolate cake. It was yummy but way too rich. It was perfect though because I shared it with all my friends. And he gave me an Eiffel Tower keychain! Yay, twas a bon anniversaire, indeed. \n\nI'd definitely recommend this place. Bon appetit! Ciao!", "author": "Phoi B."}

IMHO, Plouf (three doors up) wins in both categories, so go there instead.\n\nThe bread was a little bit stale, but then, it was a hot and dry day (by SF standards).\n\nI ordered the soup du jour, Cream of Cauliflower.  It was heavy and starchy.  It lacked depth of flavor.  Black pepper helped, but I held off on adding more salt.\n\nI ordered the house special, Hachis parmentier, which is the french take on shepherd's pie (made with ground beef, not ground lamb).  It was served in its own casserole dish, but was disappointingly tepid.  The hachis was covered in a thick layer of plasticized broiled swiss cheese.  I had never heard of Hachis au gratin, and in my opinion, the cheese makes a botch of the dish.  I also prefer it when the ground beef is stewed in tomato sauce and rich with peas and diced carrots- also missed.  The dish, overall, was dry and plastic, and I could not finish it.\n\nThe side salad was good- I liked the imperceptible mist of oil&vinegar dressing.  Very light.  Very french. \n\nMy friend had the moules marinieres.  She said that they were worse than at Plouf.\n\nWe shared the flourless chocolate cake garnished with creme anglaise and dark chocolate sauce.  Not bad, but not special.  Could have been from the gourmet freezer bin at Trader Joe's.  It didn't taste house-made.\n\nI had a glass of pinot noir that was served at a pleasing temperature.\nThe decaf espresso was also very good.\n\nThe atmosphere was really nice- friendly waiters (although not attentive enough).  Belden Place is magical on a hot summer evening.\n\nI've eaten quite a bit in France and find that the food here compares well with what you would find in a highly touristic area.

Not only do they speak French, they also tolerate my attempts at one of my favorite romance languages.   The prices are decent for what you get but I will pay big $$ for good grub so my opinion may not be the best on this topic.  I like that the menu is in english so people I take there do not feel intimidated to order from the very traditional brasserie fare.  I had the moule frites and the green salad.  The salad dressing was boring and not Frenchie enough for me so I'm docking one star.  The mussels were cooked in a wine and cream sauce with bits of garlic and onions swimming in it.  Although the serving size was just right for Cali standards it made me pined for my days in France and the kilos they would bring me when I ordered moules frites.  The fries that came with the mussels were average for my standards but I'm spoiled and I'm writing this review after a great meal at Two last night where I had the fries, so good.

In hindsight, I think maybe our experience would have been better had we ate outside, but we ate in the basement as a private party.  The amount of attention we got as a group was not satisfactory, asking for bread, ketchup, or even a steak knife (for my steak?!!!) barely were recognized, and I even borrowed a friends steak knife.  They had some 70s porn soundtrack or a reasonable facsimile playing at a volume too loud, I lost my voice just trying to talk to my wife across the table.  As for the food, 4 folks wound up returning the sausage dish, as the taste and smell was brutal.

Granted, I was hesitant to make the reservation at Caf\u00e9 Bastille after reading all the food-related reviews (it had been years since I last ate here, just for logistical reasons).  I am happy to report that everything we chose was fine and even very well executed.  As far as my entr\u00e9e (moules mariniere), I was in heaven.  When the waiter took our orders, I grilled him:  \"If I order the mussels, will I love them?  I mean, I don't want to be disappointed.  The broth needs to be simple but tasty and the mussels should be first-quality.  The last time I had mussels, I was sorely disappointed (Bistro Jeanty).\"   He laughed, \"Well, we own Plouf down the street and mussels are their specialty.  They get deliveries every day.\"  I decided that for $13.50, I could take the chance based on this information.  And am I really glad I did!  For weeks, I was craving good French bistro mussels.  Mine were perfect, plump; and the broth was so delicious that not a drop was left.  The soup of the day was honest and flavorful, too.  When one of us got her cr\u00e8me brulee, I was pleased to hear the tell-tale happy cracking sound which can only happen if the recipe and the scorching are done properly.  As far as stews, well...how can a restaurant-made stew compare to something made in your own enameled cast iron?  Once I learned how to make them myself, I never order stews or cassoulets anywhere other than my own kitchen.  And back to atmosphere.  It's like a postcard of a European outdoor bistro scene (sans US$-Euro disadvantage).  So make the trip to Belden Place.", "author": "Amelyn C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2005-05-09", "description": "Belden Place is a small piece of France in SF, and Cafe Bastille indeed feels authentically French, more Montmartre than Bastille.  The atmosphere is sultry and a little hushed (I went there fairly early in the eve); tile mosaic floors and French liquor posters boost the ooh-la-la factor.  The food, however, was anything but.  I was really craving steak frites, but I had to order the steak and substitute the frites for mashed potatoes--what self-respecting brasserie wouldn't have steak frites on the menu?!  Furthermore, what self-respecting Francophile establishment would offer quesadillas and chicken satay?!  Americans tend to dismiss the French's unwavering pride in their culture, but Cafe Bastille seems to have made too many concessions to America; at least they do have hachis parmentier, boudin noir, and moules frites on the menu--otherwise, the menu would look too nondescript, kinda like Dream Cafe in \"Seinfeld.\"  My steak was alright: it hadn't rested enough after cooking that when my knife sank into the meat, juices flowed too freely.  The frites, too, were acceptable but not fantastic.  The steak frites came with blue cheese butter and creamy black pepper sauce--I got both on the side.  The bearnaise-ish black pepper sauce was delicious as a dip for the frites.  I'm slightly allergic to blue cheese so I didn't try the butter.  Perhaps Cafe Bastille can pull off other items they offer, but I wouldn't trust a brasserie who doesn't get right the cornerstone of its traditional menu.  I was too disheartened to drop more money on dessert.  For the price I paid, I could have made my own steak with dessert and a bottle of cheap wine.  I think the best bet at Cafe Bastille is to linger over drinks at the bar and enjoy the atmosphere, but no more.", "author": "maiko h."}

I always eat muscles and I have never had problems with the muscles at Plouf; I don't understant how its sister restaurant can mess it up--the fries that came with it were absolutely the best.  The bread that was served was awful.  It  tasted stale even after I asked them to bake it so that the baguette would be crispy.  The steak was bland, I think that this could have been remedied had they placed the steak directly on the sauce and the fries on the side as oppose to the way they served it with the fries on top of the sauce (making fries soggy) and the steak on top of the fries.  I asked the waiter whether the duck had crispy skin and made it absolutely clear that I would only order duck if this could be done.  Well when i got my duck the skin was not crispy at all, when the waiter asked how was everything I told him.  He went to the kitchen to tell the chef and came back to send me apologies from the chef.  I still had to pay for it.  I think that they should have taken it off the bill or at least offer a complimentary dessert--SOMETHING!!!  The crab cakes were delicious though the sauce that came with it was not to my liking.  I would give the food one star and the service two only because the hostess was not very warm.  The waiter was VERY attentive, but did not do anything to help with the duck situation.

If you're craving a good old European tourist trap experience, complete with menu hawkers spinning long yarns to entice the unwitting tourist to part with their precious Euros, Belden is your place, sans the Euros.  Bastille is perhaps the least offensive of the bunch, their meals are fine and the prices not entirely over the top.  It makes a great lunch spot on a warmer day, and if the servers are on top of their game it's a fine experience.  Sadly they're not always on top of their game - like Friday when I brought our 3rd business lunch to Bastille.  You'd figure with 8 staff running around right next to us, one of them would take our order within the first 20 minutes, but perhaps one of us forgot to leave the notepad of invisibility at the lab and we only decloaked when we put them away.  The other reason for a 3 instead of a 4 is the french onion soup.  French Onion soup is a childhood favorite (mmm, the thought of crispy cheese on the edges of the mini crock pot), but alas no crispy goodness here.  Just a wad of cheese in an overly thick soup with lifeless onions.  Oh well.  3 stars for you dear  Bastille.  Work on the service a bit and I'll forgive the soup.", "author": "San B."}

This after finding out that Flor EDe Lise was closed and maybe too dressy for we guys in slacks and genes and t-shirts.  We also pondered recommendations on Facebook and looked on Yelp.  Determined to satisfy his French craving, I suggested this gem of cagfe.  Despite having only a 3.5 star rating on Yelp, there are a lot of good reviews.  Having not been down Belden Place before, I was delighted at what I saw.  It is amazing how this small, long ally packs a plethora of restaurants complete with outside dining and hosts and hostases ushering you into their cafes.  Anyhow, once at Cafe Bastille, I loved the host, who may have been the owner with his peppy, nice personality.  The only downside was that the dining room was hot, my cousin and I sweating.  Otherwise, it was an unforgettable experience.  The last time I had French food, was at the Hotel Sofatel in Redwood Shores when I was five or six and too young to appriciate it.  Fastforward to now, it was an eye opening experience.  The palm frites are crispy and greasless with a wonderful mayonesse or mustard sauce that is not overpowering.  The butter nut squash soup is smooth, rich, and naturally sweet.  The blood sausage with apples and potatos is heavenly; the sausage so tender it breaks into pieces when trying to stab it; the apples cooked just right and firm, not overdone and wilted; the potatos lightly crispy with a wonderful light sauce that cannot remember exactly what it was.  I ttried one of my cousin's pink peppercorn crusted scallops; it was light and tender, melt in your mouth with a mild, yet spicy or zesty peppercorn sauce crust.  For dessert, we swapped a little bit of each other's desserts; the crepe Sussette is sublime with light, fluffy crepes with a sweet plethora of whipped cream, citricy orange juice, and sweet chocolate.  The crembrulae is excellent with a hard, crispy caramel shell and wonderful custard filling.  Round it off with an Amstell Light for your meal and Bailey's Irish Cream with decaf coffee with dessert which is sweet and robust and you will not be disappointed.  I also must that the service is very attentive with plates always being cleared, water always refilled, and the waiter checking back not too often, but not forgetting about you.  So, for top noch French cuisine in a charming atmosphere which transports you to Paris at moderate prices, Cafe Bastille cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}

We were greeted right away, and shown to our table to get settled and our waitress arrived shortly after to take drink orders. Our waitress was wonderful. She was very friendly and attentive and did well with such a large group. The menu looked so promising, that we were surprised to find that the food was really mediocre. The french onion soup was watery and had almost no seasoning, the escargot had almost no garlic or salt, the mussels were drenched in Pernod but were otherwise dry and underseasoned, and the dessert (a meringue) was huge but tasteless. The only exception was the beef bourguignon which was tender and savory and a perfect compliment to the french bread.

Note: these are especially important when youre on a date, and belden place can be a cozy romantic spot... albeit with a modicum of hard-ish city edge to it (come on... how hard of an edge can san francisco have!)     after the intial impression, and putting aside the somewhat effective affected ambiance, cafe bastille is a hit and miss proposition.  the bread was cold and hard, and could have been a day old (miss).  the waitress was cute and sexy   (hit!)  the cut of filet mignon wasnt up to snuff.  i ordered it rare, but with a truly good piece of meat, prepared correctly, a rare steak should cut smooth, you should not have to saw a steak (miss).  the waitress spoke with a french accent (hit!)  the neighbors roasted halibut looked stiff, and wafted fishy (miss).    the waitress leaned over our table to read us the nights specials, spilling out of her low cut black b.r. linen top (hit!!)  i think our waitress had hairy armpits (miss).  our waitress had a great smile (hit!).  okay... you get the idea.  im a perv with a palette.  dissapointedly, ive reached the end here w/o much conclusio", "author": "Curtis Y."}
