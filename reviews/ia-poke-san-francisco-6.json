I've tried poke before many times so I mostly know what I want in my bowl. But I thought this time I'd try something different. I ordered a Sushi Burrito. \n\nService was quick and friendly. Didn't feel\u200b like I was rushed into ordering.  The workers who serviced and helped me out (Audrey, Joni, and Kayla ) suggested me if I wanted to do something daring, I could order everything on their shirt \"Salmon Love\" into a burrito. And that's what I did. Have to say...I was surprised how poke would taste so good wrapped up. Haha Portions were good, half of the burrito was enough to satisfy my hunger.", "author": "Robert L."}

Finally had a chance to go after an appointment and I have to say I was not disappointed. The shop is a bit on the small side, so it's probably better for to-go.\n\nI opted for the classic poke bowl with ahi tuna and salmon with classic shoyu sauce. I do have to admit the portions are larger than what I had expected. There is a bit too much rice for my liking but in terms of fish and toppings there is more than enough to satisfy you. Usually I can finish a poke bowl but this one, felt like it was so much that I barely finished. Ingredients are fresh and I do love it that if you are too lazy to build your own bowl you can order a pre-set bowl which is what I did.\n\nParking isn't horrible during the daytime but I can imagine that night time wouldn't be great. Next time I am in the area, I'm more than willing to come back here for another poke bowl!\n\nTotal for 1: $13", "author": "Stella J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-21", "description": "I've been eating a lot of poke lately and in my opinion, I'a Poke is an average place in SF for poke. The reason being is that the price is slightly above average and the scoops are very average (not as generous as some reviewers say). For instance, my friend who ordered a poke asked for salmon and most of the salmon pieces fell out of the tiny scooper as the employee was scooping so he only got one piece of salmon. The fish wasn't extraordinarily fresh or large. There are some pretty cool toppings and I like that it's unlimited for the large order (~$12.95). However, many poke places have unlimited toppings regardless of the size of your order. If you order a small poke bowl, you are only allowed a limited number of toppings. \n\nPersonally, I enjoy other poke places in SF more such as Poketime (Inner Sunset) and Coast Poke Counter (Embarcadero) so I probably won't come back just to eat here.", "author": "Nicole J."}

The closest place was Poke Bowl in Daly City and they're as consistent as...lets just say, your gag reflex will be tested: http://bit.ly/1UYyBwE. \n\nThe Poke Gods have heard our prayers because just in the last several weeks, three poke bars have opened in SF; and two more are slated to open in the next several weeks! I just hope it doesn't get overly saturated like the boba shops in SF; we have like 50+ now? We, San Franciscans sure love balls in our mouth! \n\nI've been anticipating the opening of I'a Poke for months - driving by everyday like a stage 5 clinger stalking her ex-boyfriend. \n\nAs of this past weekend, l'a Poke is finally open! \n\nl'a Poke is located in the old Chile Pies location and is currently soft opening this week from 12 pm - 7 pm (check their fb page for updates: https://www.facebook.com/iapoke/).\n\nJust like all the other poke eateries (Pokeatery, Poke Bowl, Poki Time, and Limu & Shoyu), it's a chipotle-style, build your own poke bowl. They only have one size for $12.50 (4 scoops of protein). \n\n(1) Choose your BASE: white rice, brown rice (not available during soft opening), and/or kale;\n(2) Choose your PROTEIN: tuna, spicy tuna, salmon, albacore, shrimp and/or octopus;\n(3) Choose your SAUCE: sesame shoyu, ponzu, spicy mayo, and/or miso mayo; and\n(4) Choose your TOPPINGS (unlimited during soft opening): cilantro, cucumbers, edamame, onions, pickled ginger, seasoned seaweed, radish sprouts, wakame, surimi, tamago, green leaf, white onions, green onions, masago, furikake, jalapeno, sesame seeds, fried onions, wasabi, and avocado (+$1). \n\nThey also have sushi burritos available. Cc's accepted. \n\nl'a Poke is more of a to-go spot since there's limited counter seating. Parking can be an issue during the weekends but I was able to find a non-metered spot several doors down on a weekday afternoon. \n\nYesterday, I ordered two poke bowls: one for linner (late lunch, early dinner) and one for lunch today at work. One bowl I ordered with half rice and kale, and the other with all kale (for today's lunch which held up well overnight). I ordered half tuna and half salmon for both bowls with spicy mayo and miso mayo plus all the toppings except cilantro: http://bit.ly/1T1yayk. \n\n:: P R O S ::\n*Super friendly service.\n*Beautiful presentation; the poke bowls are nicely assembled and sh*t is not sloppily thrown together like Poke Bowl in Daly City.\n*Eco-friendly, compostable to-go containers made from plants. \n*Rice is actual seasoned sushi rice and is not served scalding hot so it doesn't warm the fish by the time you get home. \n*Really fresh fish, veggies, and toppings.\n*Great topping options; I love that they offer seasoned seaweed, radish sprouts, and tamago which are not available at other poke bars. \n*Surimi (imitation crab) is counted as a free topping and not as a protein (I hope it stays this way). \n*Delicious and flavorful miso mayo sauce.\n\n:: R O O M   F O R   I M P R O V E M E N T ::\n*One of the employees forget half my toppings for my all kale bowl (cucumbers, masago, tamago, furikake, fried onions, etc) but I think he was just nervous. \n*The kale was really dry; they should lightly dress it with some vinaigrette before placing it in the to-go bowl. \n*Fish was cut a bit too large so you only get 2-3 or so cubes per a scoop (they use mini ice cream scoops).\n*They could be a little more generous with their veggie toppings. \n*Veggies/toppings could be cut more smaller and thinner. I received several whole slices of white onions and thick slices of jalapeno.\n*Instead of giving customers with one large quarter of an avocado, they should cut it into cubes so it's easier to eat. \n\nI have been eating poke bowls weekly as they cheaply satisfy my raw cravings. l'a Poke is off to a great start for their soft opening and is currently my favorite poke bar place in the SF Peninsula area after Pokeatery in San Mateo.

It's extremely close to the bart station on chruch (I think) and it's on the way to dolores park from the bark. You really need to go in and get your own sushiritto. If you don't like the sushiritto at other places because it's their set menu, then go here. I have never been to a place like this one where they allow you to make your own sushiritto,  it's amazing. \n\nThe workers are really nice. The inside is modern and cute!

I think next time, I will probably try to build my own burrito because there were some other possible toppings that seemed tempting like sprouts and fried onions (crunch!).\n\nI came for their soft opening and it seemed like the process was a little bit less than smooth.

I love that for the poke bowls, if you get a large you can get as many different topping as you want. They also have a pretty good selection of fish to choose from! \n\nAs for the sushi burrito however, I felt like of the toppings that were available, my burrito really could have used something crunchy (like lotus or taro chips or something) to break up the mostly soft texture of the entire thing. Honestly it just tasted like a poke bowl wrapped in nori to me (which, yeah, I know that's basically what this was). I think what makes sushirrito better is that the ingredients they picked to put into theirs makes a really good combination of flavors and textures, but with what's available at I'a Poke everything sort of ends up tasting pretty much the same.

Seeing that I'a doesn't boast anything particularly earth-shattering (or should I say tsunami-inducing...for Hawaiian food?), I will be concise in my run-down:\n\n(+)'s\n- Tamago!! Perhaps the highlight of my visit. It's a little dry and rubbery, definitely not as refined as tamago of upscale sushi places, but nonetheless a nice addition to a poke bowl. (Also very happy this doesn't cost extra, given we are in a city where fried eggs on burgers are typically an additional ~$2)\n- A variety of toppings, including a creamy delicious crab salad. I shamelessly and greedily asked for all the toppings except guac :3\n- Sushi burrito options: I opted for the bowl, since the burrito is rice only without the salad option. Plus, in pictures it looked significantly smaller than sushirritos.\n- Charming whole-in-the-wall with aesthetic decor, including IA POKE in hip brass letters and patches of plastic grass. Though SF purists likely condemn this shiny new poke bar as a product of gentrification\n\n(-)'s\n- Fish quality is alright. I would not call myself a sashimi expert, but in my opinion it seemed seemed too fishy and not as fresh as other poke places I've visited. Also, the store and Facebook page mention nothing about sourcing, which makes me question their philosophy and how they ensure quality. My favorite in the Bay is Aloha Fresh, which flies in their fish from Hawaii!\n- Sauce could use more kick. I could hardly taste the wasabi in the wasabi shoyu, while at Poki Time the wasabi sauce (delightfully) set my pants on fire. The side of wasabi seemed diluted as well. \n- Kale. Not sure this is optimal for poke, as it's a little rough and clumpy. I think mixed greens would blend in better. \n- Pricey-ish. They only have one size, $10.50 burrito with 3 scoops, or $12.50 bowl with 4 scoops (and it's small scoops by the way). I guess anything under ~$20 is reasonable by SF standards, but ~$14 for a grab-and-go... seems a bit high for a cafe/fast-food meal. \n\nThe verdict? Not bad!

It's a bit on the pricey side ($13) but the bowl is large, and you do get a lot of toppings. Something in my bowl tasted not-so-fresh, but I couldn't identify what it was; possibly the shrimp.

I got my bowl with salad rather than rice, and there was so little sauce (despite choosing 3 of the sauce options), that I ate most of the salad, fish, and toppings completely dry! I asked for soy sauce packets so I could at least dip in soy sauce and wasabi, but that's not how a poke bowl should be eaten!\n\nOne of the best things about poke bowls is the sauce. The items are usually tossed in the different sauces, so that you're enjoying a well-blended combo of fish in that delicious spicy mayo or ponzu. I understand some people may like less sauce if they're being health-conscious, so if you're trying to cater to them, maybe offer a heavy, medium, or light option.

They have great protein options and add ins, including tamago that I don't see too often, if at all. \n\nMy bowls are usually pretty generous and I end up saving some for later. The sushi burritos are good and cans get pretty stuffed, but my preference are for the bowls. My daughter is big on the burritos however, so I know this will be her preferred poke place over all the others right now. \n\nStaff are pretty nice. I only wish they had more space for seating.

The location is a small nicely decorated little shop with a few table tops for eating your poke. Like most Poke spots, they have a Chipotle-style make your own bowl/burrito bar, or you're given a list of signature burrito combos to choose from.\n\nWe both opted for making our own bowls and found the process to be a easy going, although the glass is hard to quickly skim thru options as you're ordering. On a whole, we loved the bowls, the protein was very fresh and coming from Seattle, the avocado portion was great for the additional dollar. We did think the whole bowl itself was more on the expensive side by a few dollars, but the quality of the bowl made up for the price premium. I did notice that it was hard for them to maintain protein portion control with their small ice cream scoopers. They also have a huge portion of rice for their bowls in comparison to everything else you receive, as we only ate half of the rice in our bowls before finishing all of the toppings and fish.\n\nOverall, with a few small changes, it's a great poke spot and we will definitely be back for more before we head back to Seattle.", "author": "Henderson N."}

Here's where it came short for me:\n\nI ordered a half salad half brown rice bowl. \n- Very small amount of sashimi in the bowl -- the guy who made the bowl didn't really put in the effort to fill each scoop fully, so for each scoop I got maybe 3-4 small bite size chunks\n- Brown sushi rice was overcooked and over seasoned. It was too sticky to be considered sushi rice and had too much rice vinegar in it\n- Salad was really tough. While I appreciate the salad being a power greens mix (kale, chard, etc.), the kale was not massaged or destemmed so it was difficult to chew. Super tough and dry. Just go with spring mix!! \n- Avocado or guacamole is $1 extra -- then don't list it on the list of free options!\n- Sure, it's a \"bowl\" but having it in a bowl makes it really hard to eat. Half of my toppings fell off while I was trying to eat it\n\nThe fish quality was ok.

I love the crunchy texture that the fried onions add, which you can't currently get at Poke Delish. And I love all the add-on options, which are plentiful. I always add avocado for an extra dollar (standard price city-wide, it seems), because it really enhances the meal.\n\nI do think they are a little more generous in terms of amount of fish/proteins in each meal compared to the new poke places I've tried. The fish tastes fresh and is seasoned well in the sauce options. Of course, the bowls and fish are not at all as good, as plentiful, or as authentic as the kind you get in Hawaii -- but, you're not in Hawaii. It's an unfortunate reality for all of us.\n\nI lean towards the sushi burritos here because they taste so filling and the flavors meld better in this giant \"burrito\" roll as opposed to a bowl. But, with the bowls, you can get the option of less rice by choosing half-rice/half-greens, which is healthier. But, with the bowl option, I get to choose octopus as one of my protein options, which has a chewier texture that's suited better as a bowl than a burrito. The add-on sauces seem to be the same as the new poke places. I like to get a mix of a mayo-based sauce and the shoyu sauce.\n\nSeating can be cramped if it's busy, but people seem in general to do take-out. I like sitting at the window.

The restaurant is small but the ambiance is cool and casual, the food is fresh and tasty, the staff is eager to help. \n\nI like that you can customize your poke bowl ingredients and you have lots of choices of ingredients so you can design a bowl that's just right for you. I like my poke bowl with a bed of white rice, 2 scoops of Spicy Tuna and 2 scoops of Tuna, miso mayo sauce, pickled ginger and topped with edamame, green onions, sesame seeds.\n\nTheir Grand Opening will be in a couple of weeks so they will be open a bit later than their current 11am-6pm \"pre-opening\" hours so this will be an ideal place to pick up dinner to bring home. It's a great value and I know it will be a hit in the neighborhood.", "author": "Dean J."}

I ordered a poke bowl and couldn't decide between rice and salad so I asked for both which they nicely complied. Fish was fresh, I got spicy tuna and regular tuna w their sesame shoyu dressing and they had all my favorite toppings: wakame, kaiware, masago, avocado and green onions with a dash of furikake. Thank you I'a for getting the Hawaiian flavor right with your shoyu sesame dressing. I for sure will be back as this local island girl needs her poke fix on a regular basis!

I ordered a large sushi bowl, it was awesome because I got to get 4 scoops of the protein, and I was able to get 4 different types of protein. The overall poke bowl wasn't too bad, but nothing too overwhelming. I ordered the ponzu soyu to go with my bowl and the flavours weren't bad.

Parking is tough during peak hours, they take all forms of payment. Bowls run about $13-15, if you are hella hungry you can definitely finish one yourself, if not it can turn into two meals if you wanted.\n\nYou get up to 4 scoops of your protein of choice, white/brown rice/ salad. I got the white rice option but thought it was a little too mushy for my liking, for the fish I did choose 1 scoop premixed spicy tuna which I didn't fancy much, tasted like tuna in bland mayo, than I chose just plain tuna and salmon tossed in their Spicy Mayo sauce mix. That mixed came out a too watery and a bit on the saltier side for me. liquid to mayo ratio was a bit off (I personally like it balanced where the mayo is thin enough to coat the fish and not run off the fish...if that makes any sense)  \n\nFavorite part is adding whatever topping and as much as you want on your bowl, and they'll top it off with sesame seeds or Furikake flakes. I feel like they deserve an additional half star but unfortunately yelp doesn't give us that option so we'll have to settle with this.

I waited a few hoping they'd work out the kinks and then made my way over after work to grab dinner. Concept is terrific - build your own \"poke bowl\" or poke burrito (like a sushi burrito). Tiny clean spot and good menu with just enough preset options so you don't have to make too many decisions. \n\nHere's the thing - it just didn't taste good and because I want to love it and want the business to thrive and want to come back I'm going to tell you what you need to fix ASAP. Please read this and make these modifications ... Because I'm afraid I won't be the only one dismayed by the shortcomings of your current execution of this great concept.\n\nIssues:\n\n1) salmon had no flavor -- despite your adding the wasabi shoyu and even some extra spicy mayo. Just super bland. Maybe the pre marinaded tuna poke is better but the salmon was \"blah.\" Not bad quality but really totally bland. \n\n2) the rice was bad -- you need to make sure it is cooked through evenly and has enough rice vinegar and salt to come alive. \n\n3) the burrito construction was poor -- look, I don't know how to do it but I know sushirrito figured it out and I'm sure it's not patented. Get some of their burritos and figure it out. Mine completely fell apart. \n\n4) the seaweed was bad -- come on, the nori wrapper is important. Don't get the cheap, thin nori with holes because it cannot sustain the pressure and will just bust open. It happened to me and it will happen to others.\n\n5) the burrito concepts are too bland -- just had the salmon and hate to extrapolate but my burrito just didn't pop. Needed something -- spice, seasoning, heat... Maybe more flavorful ingredients could help. If you're trying to save money by sourcing cheaper product you will make more money near term hut ultimately cost yourself customers... \n\nThere were some good things too - the guys were nice, it was easy to pay with square and the add ins (seaweed, cucumber, tomago) were all fine. \n\nMake the above changes and you'll be off to the races guys. Will give you another shot soon. Good luck!", "author": "dr r."}

When we came on a weekday for lunch, there were only 2 other people there, so we got to order right away.\n\nThe menu consists of Chipotle-style PYO poke bowls, plus some pre-made options. They also have some poke burritos if you wanna eat your poke on the run. They have both small and large bowl sizes - the small is more of a snack IMO and you're limited on the number of toppings so it's worth it to get the large (as many toppings as you want!). With the large, you get 4 scoops of protein, which is nice in terms of variety, but the scoops are actually quite small so you may want to double up on some scoops. For your base, you can pick brown or white rice or mixed greens (or a combo), and for sauces they have ponzu, shoyu, spicy mayo, etc. For the toppings, they have the standard ones for poke bars (masago, seaweed salad, edamame, etc).. plus tamago and crab.

It made me feel really uncomfortable and honestly, I just wanted the burrito. I like the food but not enough to watch the employees get talked down to.", "author": "Jessica H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-29", "description": "I've been here a number of times since they've opened and I think their ingredients were fresh and the pokey bowls were tasty. The only reason I would minus one star is because the price is a bit steep for what it is at $13. You get to select from 4 proteins and I often choose salmon, Hamachi, spicy tuna, with regular tuna. I like to have that with ponzu sauce. While most all other toppings are free, I tend to skip the lemon as it can get acidic. I highly recommend the furikake topping which goes at the end. It completes the bowl.", "author": "Peachie Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-07-29", "description": "I just got completely freaked out by their unsanitary practices around raw seafood. They were rolling up burritos with unclean materials, fish was spilling out and they were stuffing it back in with their gloved fingers. Then the next burrito (mine-which was vegetarian only because I was worried about the fish quality) had its tofu come spilling out onto the same unclean mat where the fish had just been and then they used the same gloves to stuff my tofu back in. Then, they sliced my burrito in half with the same knife they had just used over and over with raw fish burritos, only casually wiping it off on a towel beforehand. I could see the residue still there after the towel wipe with my bare eyes. I'm worried about getting food poisoning from the contamination and everyone else should be too. They need much more rigorous training for their employees about safe food handling. On the upside, my vegetarian sushi burrito tasted pretty good.", "author": "ere r."}

O have had fresher but for a casual takeout place it was pretty decent. The rice isnt regular sushi rice and I think the bowls would be better if they were. I got the ponzu sauce which was great, next time I will try the mayonnaise. My three topings were edamame, pickled ginger and tobiko/masago. The edamame was a bit on the smaller portion, and they give one spponful each. I asked if I could get a double scoop of the tobiko and they obliged, which I am very happy about...however their tobiko was a bit stale. When it popped in my mouth the flavour wasnt the sweet fish roe flavor i usually am served at sushi restaurants. I am very happy about the fact that the fish was plentiful, it could have been used to make 3 or 4 sushi rolls or more. WILL BE COMING BACK! I think theyre prices are pretty decent and the customer service was friendly. New to go spot!", "author": "Natalie Charlotte W."}
