Walking is a great way of exercising; especially if you have a busy schedule. I'd start from Kearny and Market St. and take Geary until I arrive at Japantown and go up Fillmore to cross over to California from there. It takes me between 1 hour & 15 minutes average (give or take a few minutes) to reach her work depending on my pace. \n\nReaching Peet's is like a landmark since I know I am close by, and I usually get a boost of energy....in a form of either a Javiva Coffee or a Cold Brew. \n\nWhat I also like about this location is they have a front entrance and a back entrance. They have a parking lot in the back, and most of the stores here have back entrances so it makes it convenient to go in and out of this place. If you happen to see someone you don't want to run into, you can get a quick getaway using the back entrance.\n\nJust like any Peet's location, they're consistent and that's good enough for me.", "author": "John G."}

I sweeten the brew with honey & usually add some almond milk.\n\n1st taste not good, scary in fact. It tasted very acidic, and very oily. At first I thought it could be rancid milk. After a few startled sips I returned to the counter to let the server know. I asked for a small taste they dispense in those tiny cups. I asked it that was a bottom of the barrel serving etc. He told me it was fresh, he then gave me a new cup. It was the coffee, it wasn't as bad as the original cup but it was definitely different than what I'm used too. Maybe the vat was only longer than it should have been. Who knows? I've drank of enough of this stuff to know that it's off.\n\nI then put in double the amount of sugar & milk I'd normally use. It made the proceeding ok; but I usually don't roll that way with my drink if that's what I'm having. All in all, no drama and that makes me happy.", "author": "Henry K."}

It was pretty empty, especially compared to the large Starbucks down the street. The staff was nice and my matcha latte was fine, though maybe a little foamy. But the reason for the three stars is because the bathroom was in really bad shape - very dirty and stained floor, sink and toilet. The floor in the shop could have used a good sweep and mop too. I probably wouldn't have really noticed it, if not for the mess in the bathroom which made me feel unclean at the start, so it made me notice the spills, trash and sticky/empty simple sugar and milk station.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-30", "description": "This is where I get my beans on a Sunday morning in the rainstorm after my gal who made the coffee the PREVIOUS morning and had me run a buttload of shopping errands for her said nothing about us being out of coffee!! Ok rant over!!\n\nSo I jogged over to my Peet's in Laurel Village on a wet Sunday morning still half asleep.  I love that the ATM for Wells Fargo is right there (especially when you weren't expecting to have to go out in the rain and had no money in your wallet).  There was no line this morning because of the weather but when there is, the have a separate line for just beans where you have it ground to order.\n\nWhen you buy whole beans you also get a complimentary cup of coffee or tea.  Not interested?  Get a rain check card for the future.  Of course I got a cup as my gal can get up and make her own coffee after making me schlep in the rain.\n\nNow let me address some other comments made here. Before there was Starbucks with fancy names like Baristas and their half-caf mochachinos, there was Peet's.  Legend has it that the two founders were even partners but everyone tells a different story and I don't want to debate it here. Read about it on Wikipedia.\n\nPeet's is San Francisco when it comes to coffee like Double Rainbow and its-it is to ice cream and Boudin is to bread.  True San Franciscans are snobs about those three things and will prefer them over the latest trends (Blue Bottle, Bi-Rite and Humphrey Slocumb) and commercial stores (Starbucks, Coldstone, and Haagen-dazs).  Peet's and its employees do have an attitude.  It is laid back but more polite in some ways and rude in others.  As an old employee there once told me. Some people aren't awake yet, and the last thing they want is for me to be in their face with sunshine and smiles!  Also if you want to sit down for 3 hours and have a cup of mediocre coffee and do your homework and rudely occupy the seating area, you can go to the other end of Laurel Village to the 24 hour Starbucks which resembles more of a University Student Union in traffic and noise.\n\nThe two stores are a dichotomy and I'm told they are the two busiest for each chain in San Francisco (in fact some say this is the oldest store in the chain). They serve each clientele appropriately.  Today was definitely a Peet's morning.  I said less than 10 words, got my pound if coffee and free cup as well and was out in a few minutes and back reading my soggy Sunday paper in front of the fireplace.  My girl of course comes down and wonders why I didn't make her coffee already and upon seeing that I'm wet and already have a Peet's cup in my hand then asks if I got her a scone or ordered her a latte!

When the barista puts the pitcher of milk under the steamer and goes off to do other things, the foam loses quality- doesn't get dry.

My review is for this Peet's mainly and my experience at this one, not so much the quality of coffee.\n\nI walk by SB and Peet's everyday on my way to work. If I have time before work I grab a mocha or latte. It used to be SB for the idea that it is a quick in and out place. Nope! Not a chance. Several times I have spent 30 minutes waiting at 6am for a mocha. No bue\u00f1o. \n\nShortly after I discovered the glorious that is Peet's coffee, I realized I liked it waaaay better then SB and they are fast. Boy are they fast. I have been in line behind 10 people, 745am, and been out the door Large Mocha in hand in 5 minutes or less. And service with a smile. \n\nThe staff are pretty fantastic. If I would be more awake I'd name names, but at that time of the day, I'm a zombie. They get me up and running almost every day and out the door quickly! For my money that is what I look for in my local coffee shop. They hit the mark.\n\nThe place is always pretty clean even during peak hours. Coffee orders are more then always perfect and accurate. Even when I slip and ask for a Grande or Venti. Blasphemy I know, but hey, \"I'm conditioned, even my condition has been conditioned.\" They smile and take the order just the same. \n\nEven as I drop my head and slowly move away from the counter.", "author": "Benjamin W."}

It has the absolute best service with a friendly attitude shared by the customers. I have lived in Mill Valley for thirty years and I always wait until I go to SF to get my package of coffee at this Peet's. In a pinch I go to the Peet's in Corte Madera, which is also great. The Peets near where I live in Mill Valley is the worst, which has an unfriendly and rude group of customers and an arrogant ,indifferent attitude delivered with your coffee by those who work there. Morning, noon or evening the best Peets is in Laurel Village.", "author": "monjett g."}

Their coffee rocks, and can keep me awake through my 12 hour days.  My first time in, I almost walked out due to the L O N G line, but it moved damn fast.  I actually enjoy all the different folks who come through here, the runners, the mommies with strollers, the cops, students, and hospital folks.  I just wish they had more room to park those strollers and laptops.  I figure they make it really uncomfortable so that people will just grab their coffee and go.  The should definitely offer similar hours to that other coffee joint on the corner.", "author": "Christine H."}
