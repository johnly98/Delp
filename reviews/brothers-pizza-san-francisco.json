Good food and wonderfully friendly service in a pleasant setting.\n\nMy husband and I popped in on a Sunday afternoon with our 4 month old after a walk along the ocean.  We enjoyed an order of the tandoori chicken wings, which were flavorful.  I really liked my slice of Indian vegetarian pizza which was fresh and delicious.  My husband thought his tandoori chicken sandwich was decent.  Both the pizza slice and sandwich were quite big, and smallest wings order size was 10 pieces, so we had leftovers to take home with us.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and helpful!  We had sat down at a small table, and they encouraged us to move to a bigger table so we had room to spread out, which was thoughtful.  There was space to park out baby's stroller next to our table, which was convenient.  They seemed to genuinely want to make sure we had a pleasant experience, which we appreciated.\n\nThe space is simple, clean, and comfortable.  The walls have old photographs of San Francisco on them, which is pretty cool.\n\nOverall, this was a nice find!", "author": "Barnali D."}

I checked the reviews and it seemed fine so I gave it a shot. I ordered a veggie pizza and chicken Alfredo pasta. \n\nAs I began to serve my boyfriend and I, I noticed the pizza underneath was extremely wet.. the entire inside/middle was soggy. I was confused and had no idea why. We continued to try it because we were both starving but it was so soggy I couldn't take another bite. I opted for eating the crust because I didn't want to waste it/ I had just paid all this money for a pizza. And to make matters worse my pasta had absolutely no flavor and the chicken was missing...\n\nI wanted to let the restaurant know about my experience so that it won't be happening to others. They told me that my pizza was soggy because I ordered the \"veggie\" and that's what happens when's you make a veggie pizza? I have never experienced that in the past. I kindly asked for a refund since I barely ate any. The women on the phone even asked if 90% of the pizza was left and I said yes. She then said she asked the owner about the refund but his response was \" a 7 dollar credit for my next purchase\" It's 11 pm now and I'm tired so I didn't feel like arguing my way into getting a refund so I kindly said ok goodnight. \n\nI am a broke college student who paid $30 for a meal I didn't eat. It's not acceptable to send a soggy pizza and pasta that has missing chicken and no flavor. I won't be using my 7 dollar credit because I won't be ordering from here again. \n\nHope this doesn't happen to anyone else, don't order the veggie ;)", "author": "Nikki A."}

Do not order Pizza from this business ever!\nThis evening I received two X-Large pizzas, one garlic and black olive, and a pepperoni and sausage that arrived from a driver who must have slammed the brakes at every stop sign on my route. The toppings, sauce, cheese on both pizzas had oozed, leaving naked crust over 1/3 of the garlic and olive pie and left a large mess of goo in the box, rendering about half of the pizza edible. The sausage and pepperoni pizza did not fair much better. Most of the pizza slid off base crust into the box, leaving me to get a large kitchen spoon to back scoop it back on part of the crust, because my youngest had just finished a soccer match, and was \"starving\".\n\nI called immediately back to Brothers, speaking to guy who I ordered from, asking for a cell number so I could send pictures of both pizzas, so I could get refunds if asked about the pizzas later. The person on the phone said he was too busy too talk, but that I would get a pie on the house, and they would get back to me when it calmed down. Later they texted me saying they wanted a \"whole picture of the garlic and olive pizza\". I sent a text back saying I sent you one, only to be told that it wasn't a the entire box. I asked if there was a problem.\n\nI called back then the owner got on the phone. If you ever have to deal with this guy, don't. He told me he would offer me 20% off my next order. I explained that the person on the phone quoted me at least one free pie because of the shape that my pizzas arrived in. He said that he was the owner, take it or leave it.\n\nI spent almost $50 on two pies that arrived in garbage shape, called back immediately, i would have loved for them to cook me up two new ones, not offered, too busy, then sent them good quality pictures to show how incredibly poor quality the pizzas arrived in, only to be told that I did not take a large enough photo of the outside of the box, then, my next free pizza was taken away, to be offered a whopping 20% discount on my next purchase!

I've been going to this place for sometime now. They never acknowledge you or care that you drive an hour and 15 minutes to eat here. I love good customer service but I make the exception for this place because their food is fantastic and it's walking distance to Ocean Beach. \n\nLets talk about their menu! \n\nLike I said I've been going here for 12 years now (even when I didn't live in Bay Area I would stop by here every chance I got) \n\nEvery time I've been here the cooks have always been Indian . Their menu is traditional Italian with a twist of Indian infused flavors, along with a traditional Indian menu. \n\nYou have your traditional Italian flavors , food and pizza like the meat lovers called the Brothers Pizza, veggie pizza, spaghetti and fettuccine however then they have these amazing flavorful random pizzas that are completely 5 STARS with good quality ingredients. \n\nI don't know the history behind this place and how they know how to make such amazing Italian food along with Indian food but it sure is good! The employees lack interpersonal skill and they are not very approachable to actually strike a conversation and find out the history but I've always been curious. \n\nSome of the pizzas I've tired and absolutely love .\n\n*Tandoori Chicken Pizza -\nChicken breast marinated in Indian spices, cilantro (yogurt, garlic, ginger, lime juice, cumin and cayenne) and mozzarella cheese. (5 Stars) \n\n*Chicken Tikka Masala Pizza  - \nGaram masala, spiced tandoori roasted boneless chicken breast and mozzarella cheese. (BEST) (5 Stars) \n\n* Indian Style Vegetarian Pizza -\nSpinach, broccoli, sun dried tomatoes, garlic, mozzarella cheese and Indian gravy.\n\n*Seafood Pizza -\nShrimp, roasted garlic, clams and mozzarella cheese.\n\nThey also have a Tandoor Clay Oven so they make the traditional Indian dishes as well . They had this tandoor sandwich I had one time under daily specials,  it was so flavorful and the best Indian style sandwich I ever had . \n\nThe Italian food bursts in traditional Italian flavors. You can taste the oregano, parsley,  garlic, thyme and all the flavors that make a good Italian dish. This place is always generous with the spices and ingredients. As far as their Italian food , I've had the fettuccine and eggplant parmesan. You can taste how fresh the eggplant is. So good ! \n\nSide Notes :\n\n* they make everything fresh to order , so yes there will be a wait \n\n* hole in the wall , tiny not so clean looking place \n\n* they have a few tables but majority of the time it's full \n\n* I always place my order 30 mins before arriving, regardless if I'm eating there or getting it to go. \n\n* waking distance to ocean beach \n\n* sometimes I take it to go and we eat at the beach , if your doing this , take hand sanitizer, bunch of napkins , ask them for paper plates and plastic silverware. Be prepared , ocean beach is windy !!! \n\n* they are not customer service oriented , your not going here for customer service  , your going here for the food. I have accepted they are not very customer service oriented. \n\n* super casual , leave the Jimmy Choo's and Louboutins at home . Again whole in the wall.", "author": "Regina S."}

I called the restaurant asked if maybe I'd gotten the wrong order, confirmed it was the right order, so I asked if I could bring it back. By the time I got there the cook had tried the tikka sauce and confirmed it was unintentionally extra-tomato-y, offered to make me something else(I passed) and gave me a refund. I decided to eat the rice that came with the order when I got home and call it a night, because while still kinda hungry I wasn't really hungry enough to order take out from a whole new place. \n\nI open the rice and laying right on top is a very very long hair.

Out of all pizza in the area, I truly believe this one reigns king for the quality of their ingredients relative to the surrounding pizza joints... eat here!", "author": "Shaun C."}

It could either be terribly assembled or reasonably assembled. It's not that the pizza is bad, it's just that they don't know how to construct it properly. Here are a few ways you could improve it : \n\n1. Make your toppings smaller so you can better distribute them throughout the pizza. Each individual topping DOES NOT need to be the size of a thumb or larger. Maybe cut it down to 1/4 of that size. This also prevents the situation where you pull half of the cheese off the slice when you bite into it.  \n\n2. Don't put so many toppings on the pizza. Especially when there are 2 or more toppings. Figure out a nice balance for the toppings. You don't want the pizza to be too top heavy. Also, too many meat toppings adds to the grease factor, which makes the center of the pie soggy and difficult to hold/eat. \n\n3. Put some freakin' sauce on the pizza! It's not just you, nobody knows how to do this. \nIt's pizza, not cheese bread.\n\n4. Slice a full pie into reasonably slices. I can understand an individual slice being larger than normal. But that doesn't mean the full pie slices need to be the same size. I would say, cut each slice once more down the middle. \n\n5. This might be a hard one. But if you can figure out a way to cook the pizza so that you can pick up a WHOLE individual slice from the pie without leaving most of the center end in the box, that would be great.  \n\nHomework :  \n\nRe-evaluate the construction of your full pizzas. I will check back in a month. Make me proud.", "author": "Hank K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-02", "description": "I've always admired the work of some of the greatest artists way before our time.  A few of them particularly stood out to me amongst the many.  There was Raphael whose most famous work was frescoed on the walls of some Vatican rooms known as 'The school of Athens'.  Then there was Raphael's rival Michaelangelo known for his famous sculptures of David and Piet\u00e0.  Also Leonardo, the creator of the masterful piece, Mona LIsa, known for its striking realism at that time, which eventually set the standard to portrait painting thereafter.   We can't forget about Donatello, with his famous sculptures that highlighted human naturalism.\n\nThey were all Italians from the renaissance period who expressed their thoughts and ideas through painting and sculpting.  Italians... how fitting for a pizza review right?  I love how art can speak to us about their masters and their time of existence very much like the way food does.  Pizza itself can be an art, some would surely agree, but the pizza that painted my heart of utter love for mozzarella didn't come until I was around 7.  Somehow, the 4 great artists I mentioned, reincarnated themselves into turtles.  Yes... turtles.  Green turtles... born, mutated, and raised in NYC by a rat who went by the name of Splinter.  Although born as Americans in their new reincarnated lives, a part of Leonardo, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Donatello stayed Italian.  They not only painted and sculpted much of my childhood which inspired me to learn ninja skills, fight evil, do good, and grow a shell on my back... but they also created my undying love for cheese and pizza.  After developing and maturing my mutated cravings for pizza, I was so lucky to have Brothers Pizza just a walk away from my home then.\n\nI knew at a very young age that being a ninja turtle required lots of courage because I found it very scary and difficult to put gummy bears, chocolate, peanut butter, and other weird things on my pizzas.  I thought I started off well as a little kid though.  While other kids were going for the usual boring pepperoni or plain cheese, I went straight for the garlic clams which eventually became my signature move even better than my jump kick.  The guys would've been proud of this young pizza loving ninja.\n\nAn extra large garlic clam back in those days went for 9.99.  I'd take 11 bucks from my mom and vanish like a black belt to go pick up my deliciously gooey cheesy ninja life source.  These days it costs just over 30 bucks after tips for delivery but it's just as amazing and stringy with a generous amount of moz like it was over 20 years ago.  My tastes and courage has improved to other things now like a cheesy pesto sun dried tomato mushroom sausage pizza finished off with parmesan and chili flakes... sometimes even dipped in a creamy ranch sauce or a drizzle of Tapatio.  They are still generous with the cheese and toppings after all these years.  \n\nMy changing ideals of the perfect pizza really goes to show how time changes everything just like how these Heroes in a Half Shell went from their love of renaissance art to their modern day love of italian pies and fighting crime.\n\nI'm not much of an artist like the 4 of them once were, but I can surely devour a good pizza from Brothers and give my napkins a beautifully abstracted oil painting any day while dishing out high fives as our home teams score.  \n\nSurf's up dudes!

I'm sad to say that I probably won't be giving them my business anymore. \n\nThe recent shift in quality has roused my curiosity ... Management shift? Careless late-night staff? Irritating Riptide customers provoking Brother's Pizza to make their product with vengeance? I'd like to know, because there's gotta be a reason why their pizza quality  has changed in the last couple of months, and has become less than satisfactory.\n\nMy problem has been that the dough is too soft on the bottom and the crust is overdone. The toppings just sort of cascade off the pizza, so you either fork it or cram it in your mouth like you're trying to hide it. I also feel like many of the toppings have been older, perhaps prepared the day prior. \n\nTheir front counter customer service has always been terrible, which usually doesn't bother me because, in the past, their pizza has typically pretty damn good. I've worked in various areas of food customer service for the last 9 years and no one really wants to smile and greet strangers and feign interest all day long. Some people are better at it, others are not, and the latter category have found work at Brother's.\n\nPerhaps it's because I usually order pizza after 9 or maybe they really just despise making a Hawaiian with jalapeno.

It was all my idea though, so noone else to blame :)\n\nWe came late-afternoon wanting to get something quick, and I couldn't help but notice that they had a menu option called \"JUMBO hot sandwiches.\" It was cold that day, so immediately I picked out the hot chicken parmesan sandwich. The wait for the sandwich was quite long, but after seeing the TRULY JUMBO size of it and feeling the burning warmth through the tin foil, I could tell they spent some time into making sure it was really fresh and legit for us.\n\nThe sandwich was large enough to be split for two people, although the bf finished the whole thing. I just had a few bites. The cheese and the chicken was a great mix, but I wasn't too fond of the tomato sauce. It was like a pizza made into a sandwich, which sounds pretty good, but the sauce was a bit too much for me. \n\nAlso, we ate it right after it was made, and it was definitely too hot for my mouth. But it was good nonetheless. Next time I'll be sure to try the pizza, because you can actually see them work the dough and take it out of the oven. So it's guaranteed fresh.

You know the kind - the ones who eat at the same 2 places for 40 years.\n\nAfter one slice i feel as though i still might have to run full throttle to the bathroom to hang my head over the throne. \n\nThe ultimate fall of this pizza - that which killed all possible positive aspects, was that it was soggy.  All of the dough was drenched.  Not with grease - more as though it had been dipped in water.  It was so soggy in fact, that the whole bottom of the pizza box was wet as well.  It was horrific.  I have worked customer service before, I understand that occasionally people have terrible days.  Maybe their boyfriend or girlfriend broke up with them.  Maybe they are waiting to hear back on an abnormal biopsy or some godforsaken thing when they really-should-have-been-able-to-call-in-to-work-but-life-in-california-is-too-expensive.  \n\nBut honestly, this pizza was horrible.  I would call to complain to see if they would remedy it, but really, if you have to wait 40 minutes for a pizza and they can't get it right the first time is it worth the try?\n\nI'm not one to go by first impressions.

There is an Asian gentleman who usually works the counter and is quite rude. In all the times I've dined there, I have not seen him smile once.

I don't).  Seriously, the cheese slides off under the weight of a simple mushroom and olive topping.\n\nBut the cheese is A-OK.  Three stars!", "author": "Andrew C."}

The tables are too small for the chairs to fit very well underneath, there is a toy-grabber game that makes a lot of noise (but that I've never seen anyone actually playing), and it's too dark. They need to have napkin dispensers- normally they only give you a couple of napkins with the pizza, and it's annoying to have to ask for more. There is an old lady who comes in and sits around- she's almost always in there when I go in, and it seems like she just wanders in and hangs out since she has nowhere to go, and it's kind of depressing to see her asleep at a table when I'm trying to eat. \n\nI like the variety of toppings, especially the potato pesto, and the plain cheese is already really good.

We threw away almost half the pizza away and the other half is still sitting in my frig hoping they will call me and make us a new pizza and a full refund.\n\nI didn't get tummy ache but I had an empty stomach when I went to bed.\n\nI think I'll order Chinese food next time.", "author": "Rich W."}

The dough is made pretty thin, pizza taste is good. But they do tend to put a Lot of oil on it.. so that's a downside. A slice with a topping or two will run you 4 dollars. The reason why I gave this place a two star is because of the young employee that works that. I believe he works full time and probably even overtime, so everytime I'm there, so is he. Young asian male. He is the rudest restaurant employee I have meet thus far. I won't go into details but I'll just generalize. He is rude, ill-mannered, never smile or look at you, and just take your order and says, \"Next!\" You have to see it to believe it. I cannot even speculate how many customer he alone had driven away.", "author": "Eric H."}

I have been a customer of theirs since May 1987 - I have a Brothers' Special combination - but without the onions and bell peppers; I have sliced black olives and anchovies substituted instead (without extra charge). Thay use sliced fresh mushrooms, make their own dough, their Italian country sausage is just right, salami and pepperoni is evenly and generously distributed over the surface of the pie. Their green salad is $4.50 and the fancier ones are a dollar more - and the portions are very generous. I don't recommend buying by the slice - it loses its magic - get the whole pie and have some more later, or the next day at home (cold pizza in the morning is absolutely terrific - especially if you have a hangover). Football, Japanese beer (Asahi), and Brothers Pizza is the supreme combination..! Whenever I crave comfort food I call in a pizza from Brothers.

The owners are like family to me, as watched me and my brother grow up.  This place is an excellent pizzeria.

Though the Special is a great value, their quality can be a hit or a miss. The pizza crust can be incredibly fresh, bready and delicious; yet, other times, it's flat and bland. The dough gets ridiculously soggy in the center from the heat of the sauce, cheese and toppings. Not sure if they make their own pizza sauce but it ranges from being flavorless to overly sweet. They don't seem to use shredded mozzarella cheese; so, when you bite into a slice, you'll be chewing on  thick, chunky layers of cheese. Nothing more appetizing (or not) to see crimson red oil from meat toppings pooling in the center of the pizza. And if you get meat slices like pepperoni or Canadian bacon, they throw them on top of one another in the center of the pizza, preventing the bottom layers from browning.

Placed a order for the Chef's special add garlic and waited for it to show up while watching the game. I arrives fairly quickly i would say 40 min's tops. So i bring it up and dig in with a friend.  First off when i open the box i see the pizza and its a bit watery in the middle which is so not what i consider good pizza. So I'm already not as into the pizza prior to delivery. Of course though I'm going eat it. Well it was ok, not bad, decent, I've had worse haha. Overall it was a fairly average. You would expect more from a pizza called the Chef Special. I can say next pizza craving will probably be North Beach who are also a bit cheaper.  I would however give them a extra half star for fast delivery.

Tonight we tried Brother's Pizza.  \n1.  Delivered in under 45 minutes\n2.  Food was hot\n3.  Order was complete\nSweet!\nThe pizza was actually pretty good, a little on the thick crust side for me even though they called it thin.  It was hot and the sauce actually had flavor.  My boyfriend really liked it.  I asked for ranch and got a full 8 oz plastic tub of it.  The ranch was tasty so I am looking forward to eating it on tater tots tomorrow and something else the next day.   I also ordered minestrone soup which was just like my mother's...a can of progresso.  I LIKE progresso minestrone, which is what I always had growing up, so I really didn't mind at all!  Having worked in countless delis and pizza places in my earlier years I know very few of these types of places make their own soups and just appreciate that it isn't the Smart and Final brand or something.\nAll in all...Brother's pizza, I will call again, even when I'm not hungover, which means it was great!!", "author": "nicole p."}

The pizza itself is pretty good, it's better than dominos, that's for sure.", "author": "carlos r."}
