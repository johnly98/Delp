I'd probably fall into the latter category, though I wouldn't mind being in both. One of my quirks is an admittedly irrational aversion to saying such words as boing, plop, bomb and Filbert. Luckily, Yelp is text based, so writing the word Filbert isn't an issue for me. Therefore, I'm able to write this review without counseling and medication. The Hanalei Island IPA at my elbow isn't medicinal, I consider it my muse. \n\nWriting a review about a staircase seems a bit... daft. Why not review the escalator at Westminster Mall? No, not the one by Cinnabon. The one over by Victoria's Secret. Seems more alluring, somehow. Or I could write a review about the elevator at Cafe Coyote in Old Town San Diego. So damn slow!\n\nNow, there is something about the Filbert Steps that does set it apart from other staircases, stairwells, escalators, elevators and handicap access ramps. It's freaking gorgeous! Does that sound too.... flamboyant? Not that there's anything wrong with that!!\n\nBasically, it's a staircase leading up to Coit Tower atop Telegraph Hill. Parking at the Coit is available, but almost pointless. May as well perform a self-vasectomy with a rubber mallet. There are other ways to get there, but Filbert Steps is a trek through a dazzling, lush garden, tended to by the residents who live astride the path. It is a bit steep, so can be strenuous, but take it at a leisurely pace, enjoying the foliage and the views overlooking the bay. It's a bit of an unknown secret to tourists. I highly recommend Filberting up to the Coit!!", "author": "Michael H."}

Expect lengthy steps (took us 15 minutes to get to Coit Tower), various public gardens (including Grace Marchant Garden which named after a resident who dedicated her time to beautify the wooden Filbert Steps back in late 1940's), hidden residential houses, and wild parrots (I didn't get to hear any of them). I was surprised by how lengthy these steps were, but hey at least it was an excellent work out. These stairs also have handrails, so you can grab them if you have some fear of heights.\n\nUnlike The 16th Avenue Tiled Steps and Lyon Street Steps, you won't have too many opportunities to take bird-eye scenic pictures on Filbert Steps due to surrounding trees. Even if you reach to the designed viewing area outside of Coit Tower, these same trees prevent you from taking breathtaking 360-view pictures (I feel like someone did this intentionally so that visitors are forced to pay and go up to Coit Tower for panoramic pictures). \n\nOverall a great steps for exercise and gardens, but there are better steps for better city views.\n\nP.S. - Greenwich Street Stairs are in parallel with Filbert Steps.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-08", "description": "I've been on a few \"step\" walks around SF and I would rate Filbert Steps as one of my favorites so far.  It has views, gardens, flowers, lush foliage, a nice mix of sun & shade, quaint homes, isn't too crowded, and is a nice workout.  Check, check, and check.  \n\nWe made the uphill trek from Sansome & Filbert all the way to Coit Tower.  As you walk the steps, you'll see lovely views of the Bay and the Bay Bridge.  We frequently passed jogging locals and tourists, but it wasn't overly crowded (on a Saturday afternoon).  It's a pleasant walk, considering most of the area lacks any traffic (no car access) and there was a nice mix of sun and shade to the path.  There was at least one lovely garden and you certainly notice the lush foliage along the path - one might forget and think you're in the tropics and no longer in SF.   The wooden steps added to the aesthetics as well.  \n\nTips:\n-If you're walking along Embarcadero/piers, it's about a 6 or 7 minute walk from Pier 19 (you head West).\n\n-If you want to walk uphill, start at Filbert & Sansome.  If you prefer to go downhill, you can start at Coit Tower and head East.  I'm not sure if parking will be an issue; and, for the directionally challenged, it could be hard for you to find the path to Filbert Steps from Coit.  I noticed several trails going out of Coit Tower.  As an alternative, you can start at Montgomery and Filbert as well (if you want to avoid Coit Tower parking and have a shorter walk).  I think you can also park further West of Coit on Filbert if you want a longer descending walk (see Google Maps).  \n\n-If you're relatively unfit, this may be hard for you (going uphill).  I saw one lady who seemed to struggle not too far into the walk.  Our group's fitness level ranged from below average to average and we did OK on the hike.  It helped since we stopped periodically to admire the scenery, which allowed us to rest.  Bring water as there are a lot of steps.  There are handrails for most of the path for those curious.  \n\n-The start of the steps (near Filbert & Sansome) is minutes away from Levi Plaza.  Levi's Plaza has their company HQ, a Levi store, a man-made waterfall, and benches.  The main building which houses the store does have bathrooms inside by security (if you need to pee before or after your hike).  Right across Battery Street is Levi's Plaza Park that's a small, clean park.  \n\n-If you'd like to stop & picnic before/after your walk, you can do so at Levi Plaza Park (bottom of the hike) or at Coit Tower (top of the hike).  Along the hike, there were a few spots to stop off and rest or admire the views, but nowhere to really sit or do a proper picnic.", "author": "Laura C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-14", "description": "If you feel like you've completely exhausted your San Francisco to-do list (believe me, it can happen quickly whether or not you actually live here), there's always the stairways. While searching through different lists of \"off-the-beaten\" things to do in the city, I came across the Filbert Steps. Filbert Steps is one of 8 different stairways that can be found throughout San Francisco (see more here: http://www.sftourismtips.com/stairways-of-san-francisco.html). Basically, due to the hilly nature of SF, there are going to be some opportunities for architects to use their creativity and construct beautiful steps that carry people from one street to another. The steps on Filbert Street is one such creation. \n\nFilbert Steps, as indicated by the name, is located on Filbert Street perpendicular to Sansome Street. The really amazing thing about this stairway (as well as the other 7 in SF), is that it really does serve a purpose. Essentially, these steps allow direct access from the bottom of Sansom Street, to the top on Montgomery Street. And so they'll be TONS of people going through Filbert Steps each day, whether for commuting purposes, working out, or even for tourism...\n\n...and the last part is definitely true because Filbert Steps is GORGEOUS! My girlfriend and I decided to venture out and explore the steps as part of our whirlwind tour through San Francisco's lesser-known landmarks. If you have any desire to come, I highly recommend you take public transportation, as parking can be REALLY bad. Filbert Steps is located close to the Pier/Union Square and so chances are you may have to pay. There are some free spots (free on weekends) next to the base of the steps, but they may be taken up. \n\nLet me preface by saying that Filbert Steps is truly a workout, especially if you don't exercise. Because remember, you're climbing up one of the steeper hills in San Francisco. Especially during the first part near Sansome, you are going to be climbing very high. I'd tread slowly if you have a fear of heights because it may get gnarly. But, the view is WORTH IT. It's not even that you get a great view of the Bay. Once you are in the middle of Filbert Street, you can get a glimpse of all the beautiful gardens and greenery that residents on the hill maintain. Yep, people actually live on Filbert Street. It's pretty cool! \n\nThe end destination of Filbert Street is Montgomery Street, where Telegraph Hill begins. This is actually a really nice area both because Coit Tower is there and also because you might see some parrots (https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-parrots-of-telegraph-hill-san-francisco)!!! \n\nOverall, I give Filbert Steps an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this\" rating. It's such a tranquil and transformative experience, both mentally and physically. More often than not, this area will be very quiet. And so it's a great opportunity to work out those legs and enjoy the view that San Francisco has to offer!\n\nHave fun and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

Looking up, the trek looked formidable; I took some NSAIDs for my bum knee. But much to my relief, the steps had numerous lookout points at short intervals where you could take a breather and enjoy the gardens. \n\nThe gardens themselves are definitely instagram worthy. Think more country cottage than manicured  grounds. Try to see which varieties you can name. Nasturtium, angel trumpets, and foxgloves for me. Multiple varieties of roses and some fruit trees as well.\n\nWe also got a cool sighting of the famous Telegraph Hill parrots. They chattered and swooped above the amazing architecture and settled into the palm trees.\n\nOn a Friday afternoon, we only bumped into a handful of other people.

The noises of a busy city fall away as you climb higher. We didn't hear or see the parrots though my daughter hoped every chirp and squawk she heard meant they still live here. Once you get to the bottom of Coit Tower, you can visit the landmark or head downhill into North Beach . We did both. This is definitely worth a visit especially since you can treat yourself to Italian deliciousness as a reward. \n\nTie on your sneaks, bring a water bottle, and dress in layers.

I told her, \"Let's climbs some stairs\" and to my surprise, she agreed. \n\nI placed the directions on the Waze app and drove here and found parking easily since it was on a Sunday. \n\nWe looked at the stairs and thought, \"How bad could this be?\" since we are hikers. Well, the first part of the stairs is a pretty steep incline and by the time I got to the top part of the concrete steps before the wooden stairs begin, I was huffing and puffing like a dog in heat. We had to stop and catch our breaths and was surprised with the difficulty we were having. \n\nAs we ascended the wooden steps, there was a nice garden on the left called Grace Merchant Garden named after a resident who lived on Napier Lane, a woodplanked road along the steps. She started cleaning up the place as that part of the steps became on informal garbage dump and the garden was named in her honor. It's a nice area to enjoy the different plants and flowers (as well as a Banana tree) and if you're lucky, you'll run in to the resident cat. (That cat is the friendliest cat I ever met and such a sweetie.) \n\nAs we came upon Montgomery, the wooden steps ended and the concrete steps began all the way up to Coit Tower. We stopped there to catch the view of the Bay and the Transamerica Pyramid on the left. Who am I kidding, we stopped because we wanted to rest and catch our breaths again. As soon as got our wind back, we made our way up to more stairs leading to the back of Coit Tower. \n\nIt took us about 20 minutes and some spare change to make our way to the top and we were both winded. We did enjoy the view on top though and had to the descend back down the stairs, which is not my favorite part. It's easier for me to walk up the stairs than climb back down due to my knee surgeries.\n\nFrom that day, Wifey said she wanted to return to the steps to get back in shape and we have been doing so after work for several weeks now. We don't go everyday, but sometimes I would walk there to meet here as we had made it quite a routine. From 20 minutes, I made improvements to 15, then 9, then 8 minutes. My current fastest is 7 minutes and my goal is 5 minutes. I don't know if I can break that marker, I might have to jog up the steps in order to achieve that, but I'll keep trying. Heck, there's even an Asian lady probably in her late 50's who goes up and down the steps like it was a piece of cake for her. \n\nIn a nutshell, Filbert Steps is another one of those local spots that you can get a workout on while enjoying the great view of the city and the bay.", "author": "John G."}

The ascension is wonderful, so why not take your time.  Beautiful art deco houses adorn both sides of the steps, the gardens are colorful and well tended and there are turns, nooks and crannies along the way. The great thing about the journey is that world famous Coit Tower, one of San Francisco's most cherished landmarks is the final destination.  If done properly, you can knock two landmarks off your 'to do' list at one time. \n\nI would recommend bringing some water, and maybe lunch for a \"bench picnic\" on your stair adventure.

Then you look east, and you see a view of San Francisco Bay that gets better the higher you climb.\n\n\"Climb\", that's the operative word.  These are steep stairs, and are not for the out-of-shape.  It is not recommended as a shortcut to Coit Tower unless you know you can make it up even one block.  Or you can do these stairs *because* you are out of shape;  do this 2-3 times per week for an only-in-San-Francisco aerobic exercise.  You'll be in shape before long.  Be extremely careful on the way down, it's easy to lose control.\n\nThe Filbert Steps are quite a jaunt from the Financial District.  But I've done it.  A totally Ron story:  I left my job on Market Street for a lunch break, grabbed my lunch sack, and walked to the Filbert Steps.  If I remember right, it took 20 brisk minutes, and the road is mostly flat.  I went 1-1/2 blocks upstairs, until I had a gorgeous view.  Then I sat down, enjoying the peace and quiet, grabbed my sandwich . . . and found that I had grabbed somebody else's lunch.\n\nThe Filbert Steps are the best way to get to Coit Tower while getting your exercise.", "author": "Ron L."}

At first, it was a bit difficult to find-- the key being to to follow a small doesn't-look-like-a-side-street side street that roughly connects with the Coit Tower walkway that pours onto the street. Then, follow the street (I think it's Darrel) across another street and down a few flights of stairs, and then you're there. The streets are actually nicely labeled on Google Maps, though the Steps are not. The locals also don't know what you're talking about when you say \"The Coit Tower Steps,\" so use correct terminology if you find yourself there and lost.\n\nWe came because the place is supposed to be endogenous to parrots. Though we heard them (or some other birds) screeching around in the canopy, we didn't see them. Still, the Steps are awesome because they are lined with houses (don't try knocking-- based on the signs we saw, they don't much appreciate entertaining curious tourists), and dotted with street signs. Proceeding down the steps leads to a beautiful garden right off of Napier Lane. The Steps end with a long staircase that leads from the brush into a small street that connects to a plaza with a Levi's store.\n\nWould definitely recommend starting on the Coit Tower side and working DOWN the steps, as the final staircase is pretty long and steep.\n\nIt's awesome that it is free and it seems so randomly placed, adding to the quintessential quirky San Fran experience.

Alas, we stumbled upon the heavenly peaceful and well-manicured gardens that surround the Filbert Steps. As you descend the steps (400 of them according to what I have read) you are greeted by the sound of chirping birds, friendly house cats, and a peek into the Eden like front gardens of some charming homes. Trumpet flowers, lilies, fruit trees and vines all grow in abundance that you almost believe you are no longer in the city.

The steps were constructed so Italian fishermen and dock workers could commute on-foot to the wharves from their North Beach homes.  Recently, Telegraph Hill has been populated by a loveable flock of wild South American parrots.\n\nWe searched in vain for the parrots, as we climbed past charming homes and colorful gardens.  At the top of the hill, we all but forgot about the birds as we admired Coit Tower (closed for renovation), and sat mesmerized by the view of San Francisco Bay.  Suddenly, we heard a loud shrill squawk, and then witnessed an impressive fly-by of about one hundred olive green parrots with cherry red heads.\n\nThe Filbert Steps star as a beautiful passageway to the top of Telegraph Hill.

You can come down from the Coit Tower via Greenwich steps, which would lead you to the North Beach or Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf area.

Climbing or descending the Filbert Steps is a must do in San Francisco. Obviously, San Francisco is known for its steps and hills and this climb is absolutely beautiful.  The stairs rise in three separate sections which is great because you can pretend to take pictures while resting at the top of each section. The ascension is wonderful.  Beautiful art deco houses adorn both sides of the steps, the gardens are colorful and well tended and there are turns, nooks and crannies along the way. The great thing about the journey is that world famous Coit Tower, one of San Francisco's most cherished landmarks is the final destination.\n\nI would recommend bringing a sandwich along and stopping midway for a mini \"bench picnic.\" It goes without saying that you should bring a camera because the views of the Bay Bridge, Treasury Island, Coit Tower and Levi Plaza are spectacular.", "author": "Chocoolate I."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-14", "description": "I have serious baggage about stairs.  It started as some kind of phobia and has escalated in weird ways over the years.\n\nA bit of background: I grew up in Chicagoland, where I was exposed to the terrifying(!) spiral staircase into the Egyptian exhibit at the Field at a young age.  I remain panicked whenever I have to walk on open-grate fire escape-style stairs, even now.  And stairs with an open riser make me SO nervous.  What's supporting those things?  Why aren't YOU scared?  And then ten years ago my wonderful white-haired super-sweet grandmother died by falling down stairs.  Yes, I expect to have a bit of stair-induced panic for the rest of my life.\n\nSo the fact that I planned to walk to Coit Tower from the Embarcadero area showed huge progress in my stair-related hangups.  I didn't walk up the Filbert Steps - I walked up the flight one street over (don't have me look up the name, please!) - but I walked down the Filbert Steps.  And let me just say, I'm glad I didn't walk up them, because that open tread wooden step picture that another Yelp user posted is giving me the heebie-jeebies just staring at it right now.\n\nAnyways, it's not an awful walk down the Filbert Steps, even for the stair-phobic.  For the most part, it feels very solid, and it's pretty incredible to be surrounded by all that foliage in an urban area.  And when I was walking them it wasn't particularly crowded, so I could generally treat it as if I was climbing down the Half Dome cables and grip on to both handrails for dear life without feeling like a fool.\n\nBut I just about lost it on the last major decline.  You see, that part is suspended over some kind of abyss.  I'm pretty sure it was probably a 10-30' drop, not an endless gaping cavern, but to my eyes it was over the Grand Canyon!  And all I could think was \"I bet this wouldn't survive an earthquake.\"  And of course at this point I passed someone taking the stairs as a workout and felt really sheepish on top of it.  She gave me words of encouragement, and I think those words kept me from being a huddled mess that refused to go up or down the last bit of stairs.\n\nHere's the crazy thing: I'd totally take it again.  So if you ever see a gal curled up in a ball crying near the Grand Canyon abyss, offer a word of encouragement.  I'll need it.", "author": "Leigh G."}

The climate is very balmy since it's shielded by the hill.  The lushness makes it feel so secluded.  I am really envious of these homeowners.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-07", "description": "Some stairways are easier than others; some more well known than others. The first staircase we are going to meet, are the stairs to Coit Tower, which traverse the Telegraph Hill and North Beach area. I would say that these stairs are moderate in difficulty-about a 6 on a scale of 10. The stairs are in great condition and easy to climb, but, it is a climb.\n\nYou can start at either end of the stairs, ending at Fisherman's Wharf or North Beach.  We chose the latter, beginning at Filbert & Sansome Streets.  There are only about 600 steps on this staircase, and they are broken into three basic sections. The first are concrete stairs, meandering up the side of the cliff on the east side of Telegraph Hill, past secluded, idyllic homes, with beautiful foliage, flowers bursting in bloom and the scent of jasmine wafting through the air. The public garden, known as Grace Merchant Gardens,  is spectacular.  It is said that this area used to be an unsanctioned garbage dump. People would abandon broken furniture, trash and debris on the side of the hill.  In the forties, Grace Merchant, moved to this area at the corner of Filbert and Napier, and began a thirty year labor of love; removing the buildup and replacing the trash with flowers. She asked the city for a permit to burn the trash, and the story goes, that the fire burned for three days. Take time to smell the roses and keep spring awake in your heart. Take your time, look back over your shoulder to watch the Bay Bridge come into clearer and clearer view.  Along the route, you will probably encounter some wild parrots, which leads me to tell you about a wonderful documentary,(available on Netflix), called The Wild Parrots of Telegraph Hill.  It is the story of a homeless busker, (street musician)who finds new meaning to his life when he befriends the wild parrots of  Telegraph Hill.  It is a slice of life that most of us will never see.\n\nAt Montgomery Street, there is a little median with a short staircase.  The third, (and final section) leads you to Coit Tower.  Once at the Tower, you can experience unparalleled panoramic views of the city.  Breathe in and enjoy. We chose to descend down into the fabulous, trendy North Beach, where at the bottom of the hill, you enter onto Grant Avenue, the heart of North Beach. 101 Music lines two corners, and although it is a bit pricey, it is well worth a look for buried, unique treasures within.  Being a fan of all pubs Irish, we wandered into Maggie McGarry's at 1353 Grant, indulged in a perfectly chilled pint and finished our perfect afternoon.\n\nIf interested, you can check out my entire review, history and photos on my blog: The Noise Beneath the Apple (dot) com.", "author": "Heather J."}

Find it on Darrell Place.\r\n\r\nSecond most unique thing you find along the steps are, of course, the \"secret\" gardens.  I am guessing the residents maintain these and boy! what a great job they do of it!  They're lush and green and when I was there many of the flowers were in full bloom.  The residents are creative using rock formations and picket fences.  Everything is just aethstically pleasing!\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the residents, their houses are unique in their own rights.  I love SF architecture with the Victorians and ornate buildings.  You will find Spanish inspired abodes here... painted in a faded orange.  I'd imagine it to be great fun living here and although space is limited, they make up for it in height.  If you do pay a visit, please respect their privacy.  Hikers, tourists, parrot watchers, and bored girls on their lunch break do frequent the steps... they must get annoyed of strangers on their front steps.  ;)\r\n\r\nWhen you admire and visit quietly, really observe everything around here.  The steps are unique, but there are several other oddities to be noticed.  Those annoying parrots are everywhere here and fun to watch.  There are short pathways to kind of poke your head through. \r\n\r\nIf you descend down to the Greenwich St Steps, be wary that these are very steep and may not fair well for those with height phobias.  My kneees buckled a few times as I crawled down.", "author": "Chris T."}

The kind of money required to buy something like this and hold on to it is won or inherited. Okay maybe they do work for a living if it was inherited but I highly doubt it. They probably run the family business, also inherited. And\n2. Do not own cars because god knows parking wouldn't be worth owning one. They probably have a car hiring service. See attribute 1. And because of 1 & 2, they have\n3. Great legs\n\nNumber 3 I am ABSOLUTELY sure of because all through college I walked up hills/stairs like that and still have a smashing set.\n\nSo to the residents of the Filbert Street steps, I am highly jealous of you since your view is AMAZING. There are no words for what you are able to see out your window every morning. And the idea of waking up to the parrots sounds wonderful.

There's only one thing should stay in your mind, to conquer the steps.  \n\nThere are gorgeous plants and flowers along the stairs which make the Filbert Steps so enjoyable to walk.  From time to time, you will see people jogging up and down the steps as if they are walking in the park.  Some of them are so focused that they forget to acknowledge that you are there.  Also, tourists are no stranger to the steps as you will see them stopping at the middle of Filbert Steps and taking pictures of the view or for the elderly tourists, taking a break.  Close your eyes and you can easily hear at least three different types of languages flowing in your ears.  Ahhhh...the beauty of melting pot.\n\nOh...by the way, after reading this review, if you happens to see a guy with a longboard going up or down the Filbert Steps, be sure to tell him that you read about his review on Yelp and I'm pretty sure he will acknowledge you and introduce himself to you.

My favorite is when we start in the Embarcadero and churn our way up the Filbert Steps to Coit Tower.  The first time I ran these steps I thought I was going to seriously hurl a lung.  But the more you do it, the stronger you get and I now look forward to attacking this climb (kinda of).  Once you reach the top you can take a quick gander at this glorious city before heading back down to street level.  We typically head towards Fisherman's Wharf where we can mock the fat sea lions lounging in the sun, and if they're not there, we'll make do with the fat tourists waddling through the Wharf.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-06-02", "description": "The first stretch of the Filbert Street stairs, rising up off Sansome, follows the steep, exposed rock hillside of Telegraph Hill, serving as a reminder of what an architechtural feat San Francisco really is. After the first few flights, make sure to turn around and check out the Bay Bridge, Treasure Island, and Oakland across the Bay.\nThe stairs then enter a paradise of gardens that are so lush and sweet smelling it feels like you are walking through the Garden of Eden. It is easy to catch a glimpse of the famed Parrots of Telegraph Hill here; they are easier to hear than see, so listen for their raucous squawking. \nThe final stretch of the stairs up to coit tower go up an island of vegetation that has been restored to (some) native vegetation. You will be rewarded with views on all sides, a cooling breeze, and of course, Coit Tower itself. \nThe Filbert Steps continue westward, dropping you straight into the heart of North Beach.\nThis is definitely a good trek to show off the city to out-of-towners, or even just friends who've never done it.", "author": "Kathleen B."}

I walked the Filbert Steps without even knowing it that night. We decided to walk from the Embarcadero to Vanness rather than waiting for the bus. It was a gorgeous night for a stroll. Little did we know that we would be huffing and puffing up those never-ending steps. I knew we were heading in the right direction (for the most part), but decided it would be nice to know how much more trekking uphill it would take. I stopped a fella' who was walking down the steps and asked him how much longer until we'd reach Vanness. He just chuckled and said once you get past this, you're almost there....you can do it.

I love walking up these stairs and looking at all the historic houses, the beautiful gardens and views of the city.  At certain times of the day (almost around 1P), the Parrots of Telegraph Hill show up and is that a sight to see. Good sights, good exercise, good atmosphere, and again, good for the soul.  I've been dying to rent a place here, anyone reading this that lives there, you want to sublet! :)", "author": "Meghana A."}

You will be rewarded with great views of the Bay and Coit Tower at the end of your hike.  It's a steep hike, but you can take breaks along the way.", "author": "John c."}

I try to go daily, as part of a long and lovely walk we take from our home in soma through north beach and back home. The stairs are the highlight. I've been there at all times of day and night and through all weathers. Every single time is magical. Completely corny to admit but absolutely true. If I ever leave SF, I will probably miss these stairs and their surrounding guardens the most.", "author": "Rebecca P."}
