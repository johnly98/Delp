With that being said, the busyness of the place seemed to be an indicator that good things were in store.\n\nThis is probably the first Korean BBQ restaurant I've been to where they change your grill often without you asking. I never thought that would make that much of a difference, but I've been enlightened. Bonus points for that; this is especially impressive during busy hours, when they're still diligent about changing your grill.\n\nFood wise, it's solid. Nothing mindblowing about their meat, but it's pretty good especially for the price ($26.99 per person if you want bulgogi and some other meats). The side dishes were pretty substantial, and I actually really liked the glass noodles. I wouldn't hesitate to come here when I have cravings for KBBQ, because I know that each experience will be consistent in terms of food quality. \n\nAnd again, service was prompt. Really impressed with how often they change the grill, and also with how they'll sometimes come to your table and help you cook your food if they see that it might be burning or not cooking thoroughly.\n\nIf you need your fix for KBBQ, Yakiniq can help with that more than sufficiently.", "author": "Calvin Z."}

You can probably expect a wait of about 30 mins if you come during a busy night (but its not bad if you just put your name down and walk around japantown). I would recommend getting the deluxe edition for that awesome bulgogi! Their more specialty cuts of meat are awesome (like the cheek and tongue). I wish their sauces were better, they are pretty bad and honestly I just need a little bit of salt, pepper, and sesame oil for a sauce.\n\nNot the best kbbq you can eat, but will satisfy any of your cravings. A lot of the complaints on service are meh, the place is a madhouse at times and the waiters are running around. Just ring a couple times or flag them down, its not a big deal.", "author": "Taylor Z."}

Personally, I only go to AYCE Korean BBQ for the meats, but for others, they do sell other sides if you were interested in any one of them. I found the staff to be fairly attentive to our needs and was always checking up every couple minutes which I really appreciated despite it getting busier by the hour\n\nOut of the meats I would definitely recommend the bulgogi, beef brisket and beef rib finger. Definitely not the worst place I had, but definitely not the greatest either. By the time we left, there was a line literally out the door so come early!", "author": "Timothy D."}

We had reservations for 16 people. We were allowed to sit with 13/16 people present, but our two hours began then. The chairs have a storage unit so you can put your bags in there. \n\nLocation: It's right in Japantown. It's a close walk from the tower and is on the main street. \n\nAmbiance: Most people there seem to be young working professionals who gather to eat Korean after work. It's casual and family friendly. Lighting is dim, but you can still see people. Ventilation is okay, but it's not great when you see the smoke going in a direction that is not up.  \n\nFood: We went for the $26.99/person menu because it includes bulgogi. That is a staple meat platter at any Korean place. The banchan was not as extensive as other Korean places I've been to. You get bean sprouts, mashed potatoes, seaweed, salad, and kimchi. Two sauces, a mustard and a spicy pepper sauce, are prepared for you. \n\nHighlight meats were the bulgogi, gal-bi, spicy pork belly and the pork cheek meat. These were the more fresh tasting meats and probably the most tender meats I've had. The beef top blade and beef brisket came frozen and tasted frozen. Not fresh at all. The steamed egg was pretty good, not too much depth to flavor, but was smooth. \n\nService: There's these cool doorbells on the walls by your table you can ring and a waiter will come to you. My friend rang the bell and I literally saw a waiter run from one end of the restaurant to us in about five seconds. Now that's service.

I've been here quite a few times over the years with various groups of friends and always have a good time. It's my go to spot for AYCE kbbq in the city.\n\nIf you can scrounge together 7 other people, I would highly recommend making a reservation as it does get crowded. I've only been here with a reservation, so I'm not sure how long wait times are normally.\n\nOrdering is pretty straightforward. You either choose the $22 or $27 AYCE menu and then can order whatever you want from the respective menu. The main difference between the two is that bulgogi is included in the more expensive option. You can also order one serving of kalbi, or beef short rib, per person in both menus.\n\nI've never had a bad meat here, but my personal favorites are the steamed eggs and the kalbi, wrapped in the rice paper. SO GOOD!\n\nThey also have a good variety of alcoholic drinks you can order. We always go for the grapefruit soju, and on my last visit, tried the grape as well.\n\nPro-tip: their seats open up so you can actually stuff your jacket/purse into them!

That phone call and the smell made us know there was only one place in the city we were having dinner on our second night. \n\nWe arrived around 10 PM. To my great surprise they were still busy and a line at the door. This time we waited. Great crowd once again. There were large groups, small groups and bday parties. As the guest get up to leave a crew comes out to clean the tables and everything is clean and tidy in what seemed to be about 60 seconds. \n\nWe were seated and our Servers name was Moses   What a great spirit and server.

I opted for the $21.99 one and this place satisfied my KBBQ craving. Pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe Galbi was so delicious! The meat was soft and well flavored. However, each person is limited to one serving. I thought the serving size was very fair (but I've been told I don't eat much). \n\nThe brisket was also a highlight. They were thinly sliced and cooked fast while also packing a nice punch, especially when paired with the spicy dipping sauce provided to you in the beginning. \n\nThe pork belly, when cooked for a long time, is perfect if crispy.

Despite being an AYCE restaurant, the waiters will stop you from ordering more food, citing a \"time and order limit\". I have always been able to fill myself up quite easily at YakiniQ but your mileage my vary, especially if you have a bigger appetite. \n\nThe location is pretty good, located in SF Japantown facing the main street, the location is very nice and easy to find. You will want to either take a car or a taxi to YakiniQ though as although the walk from the nearest BART stations are possible, it is not very close and will lead you through very rough parts of SF.\n\nYakiniQ is yet another restaurant on my list of \"decent or good food, subpar customer service\". While I understand that a business's top priority is to make a profit, the service at YakiniQ is distasteful. Across every single visit I have made to YakiniQ, my experience has been consistent with the staff trying to rush you out the door as soon as possible, repeatedly asking whether it was your \"final order\". The restaurant also implements an \"order limit\" that is not mentioned to you despite being an AYCE restaurant.\n\nOpening hours are quite nice, leading late into the night every day of the week. You might have to wait 10 - 30 minutes depending on the day and time that you arrived at. Large parties are common, reserve a table if you have a lot of people.\n\nTL;DR YakiniQ is a nice AYCE KBBQ restaurant in the heart of SF Japantown with competitive pricing and adequate food unfortunately impaired by unsatisfactory customer service and questionable business practices. It is worth a shot if you are able to overlook the service and instead focus on enjoying the food but personally, YakiniQ will stay on my list of \"last resort\" restaurants.", "author": "Anh N."}

No matter how many times we called them for meat, water, grill problems, refills, etc...they always got to the table quickly w a smile (we were right next to the kitchen tho, so that probably played a factor). And they did a great job remembering what we needed. We probably ordered 10 refills of the potato dish...hey it is good stuff. \n\nThis place is the BEST value you will get for kbbq in SF.

The one downside is that bulgogi (usually included in most base menus) is gonna be in the upgraded menu for $26.99. Darnnnnn. And they do not have sesame oil seasoning, very surprising. \n\nFavorites:\nOctopus: 10/10! So flavorful, soft, and fresh! I can't handle it that spicy tho, so I was rinsing some of their marinade off before grilling it (sorry YakiniQ!).\n\nGalbi: meat was marinated well! Too bad this is a one call limited option.

To make things worse, we actually waited 45 minutes to dine here. Service was absolutely atrocious too. \n\nWe knew we were in for a mediocre meal when we tasted the banchan (side dishes). Limited options and the flavor just wasn't there. Everything tasted watered down slightly which is such a shame since banchan is one of the best parts of KBBQ. I don't even want to talk about the quality of the meat. It's that bad. It comes to your table completely frozen and it just tastes old. The best part was the pork belly but even that was super fatty. We couldn't even cover up the taste of the meat because they don't have all the basic dipping sauces you find at other KBBQ restaurants. Oh, and apparently rice isn't complimentary here. That is just blasphemous. How can you even call yourself a Korean restaurant?\n\nOn top of everything, the carpet and tables are pretty dirty. Their air vents also don't work at all so the smoke will be hitting your face the entire time you're eating.

Decided to venture out to Yakiniq. This place is in the heart of Japantown so expect little to no parking. We got lucky and found street parking right outside. Not sure about the usual clientele here but it was super loud. \n\nPROS: \n- if you show up early, wait is about 30 minutes, which is fine for a KBBQ restaurant\n- boneless Galbi \n- SERVICE -- service was outstanding. they have the button to ring for a server to come over, which was prompt every time. we got our sides, meat, and grill changes quickly.\n\nCONS:\n- no parking\n- no waiting room, therefore crowds of people hovering at the front, on the staircase, and almost peering over you as you eat....\n- salad looked really sad.\n- this may not seem like a big deal but this is the first time I've seen carpet at a KBBQ place. making the atmosphere was kind of dark and dingy... like we were at someone's house.. minimal lighting as well\n- NO SESAME SAUCE. and their brisket sauce just tasted off\n- 21.99 for MINIMAL selection for AYCE. tofu soup was extra. shrimp was extra. beef tongue was extra. everything was extra (-: And 1 order of galbi per person? uh I think that defeats the purpose of AYCE....... I could have gotten this same selection in Orange County for $15....\n\nOverall not my favorite. I would rather make the trip to San Jose and wait at Gen. Or even QPot.", "author": "Genevieve M."}

For paying ~$27 I would love to see more seafood choices like squids and shrimps. I have been to different kbbq places, and I'm surprised that they don't include those must-have soups in the AYCE menu (kimchi tofu and soybean paste soup).

They called after 30 mins of waiting (party of 4). \n* For the ambiance, I would say I felt suffocated lol! I think the vent for our table is broken, it did nothing to suck in the smoke. If you don't have a chance to shower right after dine in here, good luck with the smell for the rest of the day. \n* I really like their bulgogi and short rib (limited 1 order per person. Wait! didn't I just pay for AYCE?) Tender, juicy and flavorful. We also called: pork belly, beef brisket, beef top blade, chicken gizzards, butter chicken, octopus... These are pretty good, but not my favorite. \n* Service could be hit or miss, it was difficult to track the server. They forgot some of our orders and took forever to refill the water.

This almost always seems busy, and you will not be seated unless your whole party is there. (Which sucks when you have 5 of the 6 people there.) But other than the wait, I'm a big fan of every other part of the experience. \n\nYakiniQ just recently changed their menu. I'm not sure if they've updated the huge menus that sit beside every table, but it's pretty much the same (with some small food changes). I've tried almost everything on the cheaper AYCE menu. The servers are great, and there is a small button under the menu you can press if you have a request. Last time I was there, a server recommended we try the new meats on the menu, and actually helped/showed us how to properly cook the new meats (in addition to the intestines we ordered).\n\nMy personal favourite is the pork that's limited to 1 order per person at the table (Boneless Short Rib). Definitely order it to start (until you can't order anymore) so that you don't mistakenly fill up before being able to have it! Great social restaurant, with hype music to help with the food adventure you're about to go on. Always order one of the \"pitchers\" of beer, and usually some soju.

The sign didn't really say clearly. So I decided to try out this place today. It's \"ALL YOU CAN EAT\" type of place. I ordered Gal-Bi, Beef Brisket & Steamed Egg for 3 choices they give for $21.99. I also ordered separately Soybean Stew and a bottle of Korean Raspberry Wine as I always drink dessert type of wine like port wine for before, during & after meal type of drink when I eat out sometimes. Most of side dishes were very salty for my taste. As I was complaining about one of the dishes to use for my Soybean Stew for not being clean, I suddenly noticed \"74\" health dept. score. It was placed way in the back instead of being in the front where everybody could & should be able to see it. It caught me by surprise b/c I have never seen such a low score before. You wouldn't be able to catch the sign unless your seat is way in the back, perhaps only 2 or 3 tables could see it if you pay attention to it. I hope they improve on that. Other than that, I could see how young people with full of appetite for meat could enjoy this place, not for a small eaters like me though. Especially for me, I cut off ALL fat part of meat before consuming. Their meat had full of fat for my standard. Price was very reasonable for the quantity and the staffs were extremely friendly. But it's not really my taste type of place, I might give it another try though in the future.\nAnyway, for the young people with full of appetite for meat, I highly recommend this place.

I'm comparing YakiniQ to Gen (San Jose), Jong Ga House (Oakland), and Blue House (Sacramento).  All AYCE places average from $20-30.  I was mostly shocked that Bulgogi was not offered on the $22 menu bracket and that radish papers are $2! That's not fair LOL.  Good thing they offered rice papers as a part of their menu though. \n\nWent in around 10:00pm on a Saturday night and thought the wait time wouldn't be too long but ended up getting seated around 10:50pm, which was fine.

The wait was roughly 40 minutes. There were two AYCE options: $21.99 for the basic set of meat options and $26.99 for the expensive set. Like many others said, it is overpriced for what you're getting. While the banchan (side dishes) was free and refillable, they nickel-and-dime you for practically all dishes other than meat (rice, lettuce, etc...). On top of that, you can only order one meat dish per person at a time. It did not make for a great AYCE K-bbq experience. \n\nThere are usually two things I look for in K-bbq restaurants: fresh meat and fast grill-changing service. The former was mediocre. Some of the meat looked and tasted as though they had just thawed it. It wasn't as tender as I hoped for after grilling it. I would't recommend ordering the beef brisket or the spicy chicken as they tasted rather bland, but would suggest going for the galbi (limit to 3 servings/person), the miso pork belly, and the beef belly - all of which tasted rich and savoury. The grills aren't oiled so keep that in mind when you cook the meat. Avoid cooking heavily marinated meat first (especially the spicy pork) as the grill burns very easily and would require a change almost immediately. Most grill-changes were done promptly upon request, but I would've appreciate more pro-active service on this part since the ventilation appeared to be old. \n\nWhat annoyed me was that there was no flexibility in the payment method. Parties up to three could only split the bill up to two-ways and parties of four and more could only split up to three-ways. Considering this is an AYCE restaurant charging by the number of individual guests, they should accommodate and allow for each guest to pay his/her portion.

Danger\" as my geriatric arms go flailing in a panic with all the Asian hipsters hanging out in front completely focused on their smartphones. The warning signs were clear that this would be a place for the young and the restless, not the old and the hungry. If you come around 6PM like I did, chances are pretty good that you won't be waiting long for a table. I didn't, but I did get a fair amount of small-mouth for being a solitary diner in a restaurant that doesn't really accommodate them. Begrudgingly I was led to a table with my own grill and four stools. I was directed to stuff my jacket and backpack into one of the stools presumably to avoid picking up the odors from the grill smoke.\n\nI seriously didn't realize this was an all-you-can-eat BBQ spot until I read the menu and saw all the meat that was being offered for $19.99 (photo: http://bit.ly/1OeHqiQ). But first the banchan including a scoop of potato salad (photo: http://bit.ly/1GDjsvj). I even get a huge bowl of cabbage salad to myself (photo: http://bit.ly/1XGym82). Actually it was all pretty good and probably a meal onto itself, but who am I kidding? Give me meat. As a YakiniQ virgin, I started with their standard Beef Brisket and was amazed at how much was provided on a platter. The server plopped most of it on the grill where it sizzled almost immediately (photo:  http://bit.ly/1Se1f8J). I followed that up with the Miso Pork Belly, again another hefty amount of carnivery but fully marinated in the miso (photo: http://bit.ly/1MyCSnn).\n\nI have to say I preferred the pork because the flash-grilling technique appears to be more accommodating to meats with marinades. That's not to say that the beef was at all bad. It was quite tasty but you really have to monitor the beef carefully to avoid overcooking it. I then tried the Beef Intestine which came surprisingly intact (photo:  ), but it was somewhat temperamental on the grill refusing to get tender no matter how long I kept it on the heat. All of a sudden, a bowl of steamed egg arrived for no obvious reason except to provide a break from the grilling (photo: http://bit.ly/1MyCTaS). Answering the age-old question of what came first, the chicken or the egg, it can be revealed that the egg came first since I had the temerity to order the Garlic Butter Chicken.\n\nMy belly must have been at capacity because I was having trouble making a dent in the poultry. I also found it challenging to grill since the pieces were so thick (photo: http://bit.ly/1jYAlqf). What I needed was a good mallet to pound it into submission. I was stuffed and rather amazed how much could be digested at one sitting for a reasonable price. A month later, I decided to bring Jamie W., so we could snag a booth. Same routine except we tried the Spicy Pork Belly and Spicy Chicken this time (photo: http://bit.ly/1M2dpgv). He agreed with my assessment - good value, passable service and way too much to eat but who's complaining? This place appears to target fresh-faced Korean BBQ lovers with absolutely no metabolism issues.

The atmosphere was a unique experience with the loud Korean music playing and wooden style furniture. I had a lot of fun trying this AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant out for the first time. \n\nI liked how organized the menu was that was posted on the wall. A down side is I feel like there's so many little limitations and perks to the menu. For example, many AYCE places that I've been to has a set price per person no matter what meat you get. But at this restaurant, 1) You only get one order of galbi (Korean short ribs) per person and if you want more, it's +$4.99. 2) There's a $19.99/person option which is for AYCE for the first portion of the meat menu and $24.99/person option which is everything in the first portion of the menu plus the last 4 meats on the menu. I wish they would just make it short and simple and do one set price of AYCE of any meat. (It was just a turn-off for me knowing that the most basic and well known Korean BBQ meat, GALBI, requires an additional $4.99 to order.)\n\nDespite of these little limitations, the food is amazing. My favorite is the galbi, of course, and the beef brisket. All the meats have a different taste to it which is pretty awesome, keeping in mind that many AYCE's I've been to uses the same marinade for all their meats. You can only order 3 meats at a time. Our goal was to try everything on the menu so we just went in order of of the menu, 3 at a time. PS, the spicy squid is pretty darn spicy (the 3 chili peppers next to it on the menu is no joke, lol!). \n\nThe side dishes were delicious! Kimchi was to-die-for, delicious, sour, and pungent! Steamed egg is a must (especially since it's AYCE!). The jabjae was delicious as well. Very nice variety in side dishes. \n\nLastly, the service is wonderful! These guys were just so friendly, helpful, and they were all ON TOP OF IT! We were very satisfied with the service and really appreciate how many times they stopped by our table.

So, come early if you can.\nThe marinated meat is the way to go.  Our favorite was the spicy pork belly, the Kalbi, marinated pork rib. The steamed egg is good for variety.  The beef brisket was really thinly sliced, but since it's not marinated, it's kinda tasteless.  Which brings me to the condiment.  For some reason, they don't give you gochujang.

I understand this concept, but still the guy calling out names did it in a really messed up way to another group yelling, \"Don't even waste my time if your whole group isn't here!\" Although it didn't happen to my group, that kind of remark makes me take off 1 star.\nWe were seated on stools with no back support, but we were able to put our jackets and bags inside of them.\nThe place really reeks of smoke from all the grilling inside. Ventilation is pretty poor for the most part.Service isn't bad. They rush to bring out your meats and your drinks. We pretty much got water whenever we needed it, and meats were brought out pretty timely. \nThe grills cook pretty evenly and we were all able to eat and actually get full!\nThe brisket was probably my favorite. The included rice wraps were good enough for me, but my friend insisted we pay extra for radish wraps. Radish wraps just ain't for me.\nWe all did end up smelling like smoked meat when we left.\nWould I come back here? Yes, I would if I can get a reservation. I can pretty much always get parking in the paid lot, or \"the hood\" a few blocks down.", "author": "Mike O."}

We had potato, seaweed, bean sprouts and kimchi and that was it. And not just the side dishes but if you wanted lettuce, you have to pay extra ($2 per portion)\n- Prices have done up. As of Nov.1st, 2016, they raised the prices on their menus by another $1. Still not the most expensive KBBQ out there but not that great considering their selections\n- Their portions are REALLY unclear. It's not like other places where if you other Galbi, you know how much you're getting. Each dish has very different portions. For example, when we ordered octopus, we legit got one tiny octopus. Yes, one. For a group of 7 people....\n\nAs a plus though, the steamed egg is actually amazing. I almost ate more of that then the meat dishes.", "author": "Cassie Z."}

She then took our orders which took about 15 minutes to come out while other parties that arrived after us were already grilling their second round meaning she didn't really take out order and forgot. She never came to check up on what we needed and focused mostly on the other parties. Because she was such a poor server we had to ask the guy server to take our orders. The manager and the guy server were kind and generous and brought our orders for the rest of the evening.

I've been wanting to come here for the last couple months, but never found the right time to until Sunday night.\n\nThis place is located in Japantown across from Ichiban Kan. Parking is all on the streets and metered till 6pm and if you can't find street parking then there is the parking garage, but just be warned that it can get expensive. I parked my car there from 7-11pm and it cost me $10.\n\nMy friends and I came here (a group of 5) around 7 on a Sunday and we immediately put our name down on the waiting list. Be aware that there are 2 waiting lists and you put your name down depending on how many people are in your group. After hearing stories of how long people have waited before at YakiniQ, I was seriously worried that the wait would be over an hour, but to my surprise we only waited about 15 minutes. \n\nImmediately after we were seated, we started looking over the menu. The $20 deal include a good amount of selections and if you spring for the $25 deal then you get about 4 more choices. I guess it depends on what you really want. The $20 deal was good enough for us since it had brisket, pork belly (miso/spicy/regular), and a bunch of other things. I was bummed that they ran out of the rice paper wrap, though. My friend got lettuce in place of it and it cost $2 I think. \n\nService isn't super friendly, but they are sort of speedy. They're quick to come back to your table after you ask for more sauce or a changing of the grill. A little slow with the meat coming out, but I think that's cos they try to get all the meat you order to come out at the same time. \n\nI'm easily satisfied with food and I can tell you that I could've just lived off of the brisket alone. But the fire squid and pork belly were good, too. And so was the short ribs (limit to 1 per person). The sauce and oil they provide for dipping is good and I can't wait till I actually come back here again. \n\nOverall, yeah, I wanna come back. Omg.", "author": "Venus L."}

We were seated promptly and proceeded to start ordering from the three items at a time menu. Service was prompt and polite. Since the menu said only one kalbi a person, we had to start with that. Also got a serving of spicy baby octopus (they ain't joking when they say it's spicy) and small intestine.\n\nFor the second round, we got spicy pork belly, chicken gizzard, and pork skin. Ended with steamed egg.\n\nAll of the meats were really well seasoned. I thought everything was super tasty, and loved that they were cool when asked for just a little of the pork skin to try it (they brought out one piece and yeah...way too fatty and rich for us so it is good we didn't eat more). Had no need for the sauces on the table and the banchan was delicious as well.\n\nAnd while it says they will charge you for leaving food behind, they actually didn't. Then again, we just left behind two small pieces of meat.\n\nWe'll be back since it's only $21.99 a person.

The prices are average if you're ordering less special kinds of meat it'd be $19.99 for a more variety it'd be $25.99. Also it's extra for the short ribs I think as well as some small side dishes. \n\nBEFORE when I say before probably a couple of years ago they never really had a time limit.. but now they actually watch the amount of time people eat. I think it's because it's a pretty popular restaurant that it gets pretty packed by the end of the night. There's a list where you can put your name and phone number down where they call you, which is pretty nice considering you can walk around in Japan Town and wait for their call. \n\nParking you can either try to find parking on the street or in the garage in Japan town. The timing are charged differently, I think that if you park pass 5-6pm it's ALOT cheaper for future tips.

They were even accommodating when the party size changed.\n\nFor the price, there are a decent selection of meats.  It's a fun way to try different options.  The  favorites were the marinated beef and, of course, the pork belly.  The spicy octopus was also a hit if you can handle the heat!  Grills are in the table, and you can swap out the grills if they get too blackened from the marinade. There are no extendable vents from the ceiling to suck up the smoke, so the place does get smokey - but they have storage in the stools so you can throw your coat/purse in there if you don't want to bring the smell home with you.\n\nHowever, Yakiniq falls short in a few ways:\n- Getting the attention of a server is difficult.  Only *some* tables have a yogiyo button to call them over.  Without one, I ended up literally raising my hand, like you do in kindergarten, until someone came by. \n- The service can be slooooow.  I asked for lettuce wraps 6 times, and they brought them out about an hour into the meal.  Banchan refills are rare, and you have to follow up.  Ordering a bibimbop can be a challenge too.  Overall, they get the meats out first (which I get is priority), but leave you hanging on any of the side dishes.\n- The sauces.  What?  I just moved to the Bay from Seoul, and these were just off.  One tasted like a thai peanut sauce!  They don't do bean paste, rock salt, or sesame oil.\n\nI still think it's a good choice if you're hoping to fill up before heading to belt out some tunes at noraebang, but I'll be interested to see how they keep up with the competition moving into the neighborhood.", "author": "Kelly E."}

Before I even talk about how good the food was, I want to point out how much FUN a place like this is. There were happy people everywhere, the atmosphere was upbeat, and if you're with a bunch of your friends, what more can you ask for than drinking a few drinks and cooking your own meat right in front of you? We had to come in and put our name down and wait for about an hour (we walked around Japantown) but it was absolutely worth it. When we sat down we were greeted by our server and given a rundown of the menu. \n\nYakiniQ has an AYCE deal for around $20/25 so this is a major plus for the restaurant. We started off with a couple beers, the marinated bulgogi and the beef brisket. They immediately blew our minds accompanied with the sauces and it was large portion right off the bat so we had it for a while. Before moving on to our second meats, we sampled all of the sides. The potatoes, egg, and cold noodles were especially tasty (my girlfriend freaked out on the cold noodles she liked them so much). Unfortunately, what will keep me from giving this place 5 stars was the pork. We got the pork belly and the spicy pork belly next. There was just so much fat on all of the meat. I understand pork is a fatty meat. My girlfriend and I do a lotttt of pork but this was a little too much for us.\n\nFortunately we were able to go back to the marinated bulgogi and end the meal extremely happy and full as can be.

Expect a wait of 30-60 minutes (more if in groups of 2-3; less if in groups of 4-6). Unlike many kbbq places in the country (except LA), they have rice noodle papers! Also unlike other places, a lot of 'free' add-ons are not free.... such as lettuce for wrapping or tofu soup. Steamed egg is still free though it can be bland and less fluffy. Quality of meat is pretty bad... beef brisket is not sliced thin enough, galbi is too sweet, pork belly is the cheapest cut available. We went for the upgraded menu and the pork neck is my favorite of all the meats on the menu -- the beef rib finger is cheap and too sinewy.\n\nFYI -- their 'house red wine' is boxed Franzia.", "author": "Jennifer M."}

At $19.99 AYCE you can't really beat that. Service was pretty good - have read reviews about really bad service so not sure if it's because we were at a table right by the kitchen or because we had a party of 9. \n\nTheir reservation rules are horrible though. They require a minimum of 8 for a reservation which is reasonable. We had a party of 9, but when they called to confirm the reservation, they said that if one person doesn't show or is more than 10 minutes late, then the whole group loses the table and we're put at the end of the queue for walk-ins. I've never heard of this before - I mean, I get that your whole party should be here before being seated, but it doesn't matter if it's a death, stuck in traffic, trying to find parking a block away, whatever reason someone in the group is past your reservation by 10 minutes, you lose the table.  Seems pretty extreme... \n\nIf that's the case, everyone should be seated exactly 10 minutes past our reservation. If they're being super picky about the customer upholding their end of the reservation, then they should uphold their side too. We didn't have a problem getting our table, but reading other reservation reviews, some tables had to wait 50 minutes before their spot opened up. \n\nOverall, I don't know if I'd go back just because of the hassle with the reservations. I'd rather pay more money and not deal with the extra bullshit.", "author": "Mandi W."}

I'm guessing that the weekends are much worse so plan accordingly - they do take reservations but only for a party of 8 or more. \n\nThe minute you walk in - be prepared to smell strongly of bbq for the rest of your day/night - the ventilation is not that great and there are limited windows. The menu is simple - you have 2 options - the $20 package or $25 which is pretty much the same but it includes marinated bulgogi. We opted for the $20 as the kalbi is what we were there for - they limit you to 1 kalbi serving a person but AYCE everything else. \n\nThe kalbi was good - tender and flavorful - the portions were decent for our group. We didn't try any of the chicken but the spicy pork belly wasn't bad - not the best but not bad either. The beef brisket was good - not much flavor but not bad either if you use the dipping sauces. The fire squid was ok and the pig skin was just a weird rubbery texture - not good. The steamed egg was very bland - no salt at all - the rice soup was good but lacking rice - bowls of rice are an extra 50 cents each. \n\nThe banchan is decent - the japchae, kimchi, seaweed, mixed cabbage, potato salad, and bean sprouts. Orders of lettuce and other side dishes are extra. The kimchi fried rice was ok - lacked a bit of flavor and greasy.\n\nOverall, for the price - not a bad AYCE option near the heart of SF. Service was quick and prompt - the owner I'm assuming was super friendly and nice. Very hardworking servers so cut them some slack - there's a button at each table and the staff are usually very responsive.", "author": "Brenda L."}

For those times, there's YakiniQ BBQ.  \n\nFor $19.99 per person you can get a whole lot of stuff here but anything more than that stuff will cost you.  Want a bowl of rice?  Add 50 cents.  Want lettuce to use as a wrap?  You'll pay for that too.  How about tofu soup or dessert?  Yep, those are add-ons.    \n\nWhat $19.99 buys you here is unlimited refillable banchan and all you want of the proteins that they're offering you at that price.  Want Bulgogi?  Sorry, that's a different price.  Get the picture?  \n\nBeef short ribs are included in the $19.99 price but only 1 serving per person.  Make sure you get every serving to which you're entitled (this is the only \"limited\" item on the $19.99 menu); the beef short ribs are delicious.  You can also get a fatty brisket, too huge chunks of differently spiced levels of chicken, fire squid, pork belly, and a whole mess of things that fall into a category I'm not fond of (intestines and the like).  Interestingly, a soft cooked egg will be delivered to your table whether or not you request it.\n\nThe table-based grill is swapped out frequently which is wonderful.  The minute these things get dirty they start spewing smoke and, if you're positioned downwind, you'll likely start hacking away.  You'll end up leaving here smelling like a George Foreman Grill regardless but it's nice to leave your lungs out of the equation.\n\nService is efficient and the place is lively and bustling.  A big pitcher of water is placed at your table.  The waiter comes around frequently, not just to change the grill but also to ask what you next want to try.  For one grill they'll bring you three orders at a time and they'll track those short-rib orders to know if they should also start tacking on the Benjamins. \n\nYakiniQ is up a steep flight of stairs, popular (1 hour wait on a Saturday evening),  and the opposite of fancy.  I read here that they limit the time you have to consume your AYCE meal but, assuming that's accurate, it didn't affect me at all.  \n\nLike every other KBBQ joint I've ever been to I left here feeling well satisfied.  There were a mess of proteins I didn't sample but that didn't mean I left hungry.  Quite the opposite.  I ate no more here than I would've at a non-AYCE joint but sometimes it's fun to pretend I might.", "author": "Tracey A."}

People were hovering over the wait list and it looked like a madhouse but they have our table ready and we were seated without much of a wait.\n\nGreat selection of meat and cuts.

First off, ventilation is extremely poor. When you start cooking, the smoke goes everywhere except for straight up into the vents. However, it doesn't really matter, because regardless of which meat set you get or what you order, everything is so heavily marinated that it's soggy upon arrival. When you try to cook spicy pork belly or brisket or galbi, it is either super charred from a bad grill or basically boiled from a new grill that doesn't heat up well. Banchan consists of seaweed, sprouts, kimchi, and potato salad, none of which seem housemade. If you want lettuce or radish wraps, it's extra. Some of the service buttons on tables are also broken, but it doesn't matter because they don't cook for you. In all honesty, all this place does is empty your wallet and make you miss LA.", "author": "Danny C."}

YakiniQ BBQ is located upstairs from the similarly named cafe, and I was actually surprised that my friend and I could be seated immediately for a weeknight dinner. I think the key is to keep the group to four people maximum. There are a few tables that seat more, but they all seemed full when we went.\n\nI like that there is a menu at every table glaring brightly at customers because who likes their menu taking up space on a table full of meat? My friend and I got the $20 AYCE special which was REALLY good in terms of variety. Fantastic marination job. We started with their brisket (which is pretty fatty) as well as a pitcher of beer.\n\nOur waiter was hilarious and gave us recommendations for what else to try. I rarely see spicy squid on the menu and never beef intestine. He gave us a little of both to try, which was great because I didn't want to waste food if we ended up not liking those dishes. Would recommend the fire squid (not so much the intestine) but it really is HOT! The ban chan and steamed egg were so-so.\n\nI would definitely come back here again.

That's never happened to me before. \n\nThe bulgogi was too sweet. When we asked the server to bring us specific quantities of meat (to speed things up, plus it's all you can eat) he scolded us by telling us \"don't tell me how much to bring out, just tell me which meat). Um, okay. He brought out enough meat for each person to have 1 piece (we were a group of 10) and then we had to flag him down again. \n\nI like the large selection of meat, but didn't get to try everything since service was slow. I get it, that they are busy  but if they bought out more plates each time I would be a happy camper! It's probably their protocol so the business doesn't lose money.

Next you get seated in a booth or the community tables. We got seated in the community table where we are sitting next to a table of two, which is like right next to us. \n\nThere are plenty of tables, so don't you have to worry about a long wait well not at least on a Thursday night. The vibe i brought in here was, i was starving! i was so excited to have my first experience of k kbbq in the city and it was ayce! Well before coming here i was craving some kbbq so after researching here was a good choice since i wanted to go to Daiso! \n\nFood \n\nAYCE KOREAN BBQ! 19.99 vs. 24.99 \n\nThe 19.99 doesn't come with bul go gi, pork neck, beef tongue, and beef rib fingers. But comes with a big list such as pork and chicken and etc. \n\nThe 24.99 comes with bul go gi, pork neck, beef tongue, and beef rib fingers and all the 19.99 list. \n\nWell i was just going to stay with the 19.99 but then went ahead and did the 24.99, its like eat good or don't eat!  I was adventurous on the menu at first and try a lot of the items but then started repeating the ones I like the most. They even offer a spicy chili dip and sesame oil with salt for dip. The chili sauce went with everything. The sesame oil, I used it for the grill so the meat doesn't stick to it. The sesame oil is great for the beef brisket because its not marinated and the salt and sesame oil gave it flavor.  Above is a list of my favorites. \n\nFire Squid - marinated in a spicy sauce and it was a whole squid! The taste was great, but not too spicy, it was easy too cook too. I liked it and I think this my most favorite dish. \n\nBeef brisket - This was so yummy! At first I didn't order it, then I saw the table next to us ordering this multiple times, so here I order one. After trying it I got hooked but was too full already to make another order. It was easy too cook and its well done in seconds. \n\nBeef tongue - I heard they made an improvement on this dish, by slicing it into thinner slices compared to before. It was very lean, and not much fat attached to it. I liked how it is not too filling but light on the meat. Also in some pieces I can taste a bit bitter if it isn't cook well done. So leave it on a little bit longer after its done cooking. \n\nBul go gi - Big chunks of beef! For sure you wont be asking where's the beef at? The did a good job in marinating this, the meat was flavorful and tender too. We had like 3 to 4 dishes of this. Man did I felt like I was a pig after this meal. \n\nBanchan - They had the beansprouts, Kim chi, cabbage salad, scoop of potatoes salad, seaweed. The banchan were basic and average tasting. I do like it because these are mainly the veggies we had with the whole meal. My mama taught me always eats yo veggies. The Kim chi were kind of meh, not good but not bad. My favorite banchan was maybe the beansprouts; I had refills many time since that tasted the best of all. \n\nService \n\nAttentive service, checked on the drinks and the meat we needed refill. Make sure you speak louder because they had a hard time hearing, eventually I had to shout. \n\nParking \n\nGood luck with parking in the city. Free parking on the streets after 6pm but after circling a few rounds, we decided to park in the japan town garage. It cost 2.50 an hr. just fyi.\n\nOverall I ate until I couldn't move but need some one to roll me out of there. I had a great experience and I loved all the meat and seafood they offer here. The banchan weren't my favorite but it was needed to balance all the meat I ate. There is no rice so carb free worry. Great service and quick on bringing the stuff we ask for. A con would be the parking. Great casual environment for a family or friends catch up type of environment. \n\nAlso if its yo bday, you get to eat free with an adult purchase.", "author": "Alex T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-06", "description": "So I confess... I've been here 3 times over the last 2 months. I'm a meatoholic, a carnivore, a meat-eater, a black hole for meat, whatever you want to call me. I just keep coming back like a moth to a flame. But to meter your expectations, it's NOT because YakiniQ has the best KBBQ in town, rather because it's the only AYCE KBBQ in town. (Please do correct me if you know of any others in SF.) And I'm just an addict for the periodic consumption of magnificently massive amounts of meat. \n\nThe MENU is broken down into 2 price tiers. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lfF7v4ZsesCnTXwp8N7IXg&userid=6YEnpx-qloIfFX-L9uyfbQ\n\nThe $20 price tier includes the following 13 proteins: \n- Galbi Boneless Short Rib (limit: 1 serving per person)\n- Beef Brisket\n- Pork Belly\n- Spicy Pork Belly\n- Miso Pork Belly\n- Spicy Chicken\n- Garlic Butter Chicken\n- Pork Skin\n- Sweet Pepper Chicken Gizzard\n- Fire Squid\n- Beef Honeycomb Tripe\n- Beef Intestine\n- Beef Big Intestine\n\n+ Rice Soup\n+ Steamed Egg\n+ Rice Cake Wraps\n\nAnd then upping it to $25 will give you everything listed above plus:\n- Prime Beef Tongue\n- Bulgogi Marinated Beef\n- Pork Neck Meat\n- Beef Rib Finger\n\nAlcoholic accompaniments will cost you an extra $7-8 for beer bottles, $13 for a pitcher, or $13 for a small carafe of soju. If your dining companions are anything like mine, your final price tag will end up around at least $40. Yes, this is leaning towards the pricey side for everyday dinner + drinks, but for a group outing or periodic splurge, it's worth it.\n\nTIPS TO EFFICIENT EATING: \n(1) Make a reservation. While weekdays won't be as crowded like weekends, there's nothing worse than showing up starving + then having to smell the meat while you wait forever-long for a table. They're pretty good about honoring reservation times so it should be no problem having meat (or at least banchan) in your mouth within minutes of arrival. \n(2) YakiniQ enforces a 2-hour time limit from the moment you sit down + won't let you order until your whole party is present at the table. So if you have someone in your party that's lagging, don't sit yet. \n(3) Before you're seated, already have planned what your first 3 meats will be so you can start off the binging immediately. \n(4) Fill up the grill with as much meat as you can reasonably cook without burning it + don't stop cooking. It doesn't matter if 1/2 the grill has raw beef + the other 1/2 has cooked pork. Yes, the tongs are touching both, but it'll all get cooked anyways. \n(5) Cut the meat once the outside seems mostly cooked so the chopped pieces will then cook faster. \n(6) Order your next 3 meats even as you're still finishing cooking the previous batch. \n(7) Repeat again + again until the waiter tells you it's your last call. Many of your group may be full at this point, but even so... order more meat. The waiters know to portion out the last plates with smaller sizes + now is when you can actually take your time to finish it all.     \n\nThe 4 stars I'm giving YakiniQ in this review comes with a big meaty asterisk. So while this place is indeed worthy of carnivorous praise by SF standards--because here is no other competition with which to create a higher standard--if I were comparing this to my old haunts in Ktown Los Angeles, I would be giving YakiniQ a solid 3 stars. ... Why? That darn time limit. As someone who has a 2nd stomach for foods I like, 2 hours isn't enough time to cook + consume everything I want to hoard like a squirrel gathering nuts for the winter. And secondly, the quality of the meats is fairly average. Characteristics such as the tenderness of the meat, the fat ratio of the fattier cuts (like pork belly + brisket), the flavor of the marinates, etc are all very average. Some of the proteins like the Pork Skin + Sweet Pepper Chicken Gizzard I actually wouldn't recommend due to their super chewiness, but that could be personal preference as well. \n\nAll in all, if you've made it this far reading this review, I'm sure you'll have a good time. If not, you didn't drink enough beer/soju + should hit up one of the karaoke places within walking distance away. :P", "author": "Janelle Q."}

He would keep on walking away without letting me finish what I want to order. I understand that this is a busy place, but aren't the customers your first priority?

I generally visit Jang Mo Jip (a hole in the wall for bona fide Korean BBQ--IMO ) Santa Clara, but now that I reside closer to SF, this is a convenient choice. Arrived 7:40 pm with my significant and homeboy on a Saturday, and we did not get seated until about 9:30 pm. You may only call for reservations with a minimum party of 8. Fortunately the Kintestu Mall is nearby to explore while you wait. \n\nYou may opt for the $19.99 per person, or the $24.99 per person menu options (see menu). We generally select the $19.99 menu option, unless we really ache for the beef tongue, bul-go-gi, pork neck meat, or beef rib finger for $5 extra. The sides are nowhere near memorable and are limited compared to other places. Do order the $13 pitcher of OB and $10 Chum Churum (Korean Soju 19%). #rage\n\nHere, the brisket is highly revered (by me, especially)-- the luscious amount of fat on the brisket imparts mouthwatering flavor and aroma. Be sure to dip your meat in the salt-sesame oil sauce! The cut of the pork belly here is so thick, so it does not cook to crispy. Be sure to cut up your pork belly slab while cooking, so that the pieces can crisp up a bit. The 'spicy' pork belly was not spicy, but peculiarly sweet due to the unappetizing sauce it was coated with. Sweet Pepper Chicken Gizzard was eh tolerable. The steamed Egg was watered down. Be sure to recurrently order Rice Cake Wrap, or you'll run out during your extensive fat kid session. You can only order 3 types of meats at a time and be prepared to cook your own meats. \n\nThe service button at every table is the only reason why the servers are so accommodating. Beware though, as the servers endeavor to memorize what you ask for, so they always fail to bring you everything that you requested.  All good, PUSH THE BUTTON. You'll need to ask for a number of grill changes (average 3 during your visit).", "author": "Merica S."}

We then ordered from the $25 menu and the bulgogi was better because it was marinated. All of my friends really enjoyed the beef tongue. That is probably the best thing on the menu. The chicken dishes are pretty okay as well. The beef fingers were super frozen and tough to eat, again, not great quality. \n\nThe banchans were alright. Nothing too special. The eggs were also a little flavorless and I had to add soy sauce. I'm not sure if they're supposed to taste like that, but I didnt like it.\n\nTips: Ask for a smaller portion of the meat so that you can try more and not get stuck with so much! Wear clothes that you won't mind smelling like BBQ!\n\nThe service was pretty alright especially for an AYCE place.

It was pretty good but since we came right after closing at our store it was nearing their closing so it wasn't too bad other than the last call for meet 30 minutes prior to the restaurant closing. Which is understandable. I had tried the rice paper wraps and that was the only thing I wasn't to thrilled to eat that night. The consistency was on the thicker side (want to say almost like an uncooked wonton wrap kind of feel). But other than that, it was okay for my first time.\n\n2nd visit..\nCame here with my dad and sister since we've been on the search for a good Korean bbq place and they loved it. For the price it was worth it. The only downside about this visit was we were seated by the stairs leading to the bathrooms and out fire kept going out due to the draft that was coming in. I think we had out fire restarted about 10-15 times that night alone and it was becoming a running joke with the staff. One minute we would be cooking our food for maybe less than a minute and next thing you know the fire went out. This was the only downside to this visit. So whatever you can do, DO NOT GET THE BACK RIGHT TABLE NEAR THE STAIRCASE!\n\n3rd visit...\nWe went back again earlier today for dinner. Tried to call if I could do a reservation but was received with an \"We don't do reservations\". Okay, that in my mind can mean only two things... 1) You're busy so it's understandable that you can't take any more reservations for the night but it would be nice if the customer was just told something sorry we can't take any more reservations for the day because we are booked. Now that'll be something more less harsh to hear. 2) you can't take reservations of parties less than X number. Unless it's written somewhere on your website or a page then it'll be easier to call ahead for reservation in you have X amount of people. \n\nOverall our visits were good but we were surprised to find out that there IS A TIME LIMIT to eat. I have not seen any postings anywhere about how long you can sit and eat.

I practically felt like we were on a double date and I wanted to just grab their extra side dishes that they weren't eating... \n\nMeat - There are tons of options here! But for me, I'm usually just a fan of bulgogi and galbi. I'm not into all the extreme stuff like intestines or tongues. Which is unfortunate because that means I have to pay extra just to eat bulgogi... Anyway, I did not have enough room to try galbi today but the bulgogi was delicious and I wish I had room for another round of it! Brisket was my second favorite. Spicy pork belly & miso pork belly had good flavor but I'm not a fan of the fatty meat. And in last place would be the rib finger and tongue...I tried a little but my boyfriend finished all of it. I just wish they gave smaller portions for a party of 2, that way we could try more things. \n\nSides - I really liked the jobchae, rice paper, seaweed and potato salad. They also had a radish/jalape\u00f1o side dish that I asked for a refill on, and the server said it was a Sunday special so no refills. Then he came back with one anyway. Awesome! \n\nOther - The salad dressing on the salad is simple but really good! Also, I wish they had some other dipping sauces. I'm not a sesame oil fan, and their other miso based sauce was way too spicy for me. I didn't even touch the steamed egg, it was nothing special to me. \n\nService - They seemed to check on us just enough for our visit. We got done before the big dinner rush so that probably helped. They have service bells too, but not at the smaller tables that we sat at. I found the bell sound annoying - and that was when it wasn't even busy yet.. But other than that, all of the servers checked on us, suggested meats, refilled sides, and changed our grill. \n\nIt's not my favorite Korean BBQ restaurant but then again, it was my first visit.

So just like other recent updates in some of the other Barbecue restaurants, they have limited it to one \"galbi\" per person which upon receiving, it is mistaken for other meats since it doesn't even look like short ribs and lacks the traditional bones. The atmosphere, is quite cramped, which being in San Francisco is quite normal, and the setup of the establishment itself doesn't feel handicap friendly. We did also order spicy pork and chicken, which the chicken did easily stick to the surface and I wished we had recieved a new or clean grill more often to help with cooking items that stuck. The flavors I'll admit were quite good and the appetizers delectable but for how busy the establishment was, i wish they would hire more staff or check up with patrons more often.

First thing we sit down and waiter asks us what we want to drink. We say we want to do sake bombs and he had no idea what we were talking about. He just kept repeating \"bombs\" ... which was super frustrating -- so we just decided to order a pitcher of beer. \n\nThe meat was mediocre, some looked kind of old.... but the kalbi was the best one there. It was very tasty and they gave us a super huge portion. It literally covered the entire grill! We also tried intestines (which I never do).. but now I know why, cause I did not enjoy it LOL, but maybe its just me.\n\nLike all KBBQ restaurants, they have a \"call\" button for you to push when you need anything. We would push it to order more meat or sides that needed to be refilled - and someone would come that wasn't our waiter and ask \"have you told you waiter\" and in my head... everytime he said that I would think.. \"umm no... that's why we pushed the button...\" but everytime he would just go get our waiter for us to repeat everything again.. which I think kind of defeats the purpose of the button.\n\nAnother thing -- my friend really wanted to try one of their steamed egg so we ordered, didnt come for 15 min so we ordered it again.. didnt come for another 15 min and when we about to leave after an hour and a half they come out with 3 saying we ordered this much... when all we really wanted was one and gave us a pissy face. \n\nI'd much rather drive down to SJ or even fly back down to SoCal for KBBQ before I come back here.", "author": "Carrie L."}

After our first round of food, they tell us last call on our second round 30 mins before closing time, even though we should have had fill service until their 11pm closing time. They also refused to let one group order more than 3 items for our last call, which now doesn't make this all you can eat. No more meat, no more sides.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-16", "description": "Option of two AYCE menus- the $20 and $25. I want to start off by saying why in the world is the bulgogi on the $25 menu?!? I have never been to a KBBQ place where the bulgogi is not on the least expensive menu. Beef tongue was also on that menu too, but that's not as surprising. Moving on...\n\nI like how the menus are electronically displayed on the wall by the table, makes it easy to look at your options for ordering. Definitely come on the earlier side if you don't want to wait here forever. Place gets packed already at 6 PM, and this was on a MONDAY night. I don't even want to imagine what the wait looks like on a Friday or Saturday.\n\nAfter we got seated, immediately started ordering. The table really liked the pork belly- I can't personally speak on it but they all said it was delicious. One of our servers was kind of on the stingy side at first but then slowly warmed up to us, I don't know what that was about. The other servers were a lot more friendly and quicker to serve us. So I would say service is hit or miss. Really liked the guy who was helping us out in the second hour we were there because he was really on top of it.\n\nThey actually make you finish cooking all your meat before ordering the next round, I guess everyone else at my table has only been to this AYCE place before that were confused by my frustration. Most places I go to, you can already place the next order after you receive your first order. Yeah, I understand they're trying to make sure you're not going to waste the meat, but bruh, there's six of us and I'm hungry. \n\nGoing to use the brisket as my basis for measuring the quality of meat- it was okay. Not the best brisket, not the worst. I think it gets the job done when you're craving Korean food. They actually have a lot of chicken choices on the menu (two is a lot at KBBQ, trust me) and one seafood option (the fire squid which is hot, hot, hot). Otherwise, typical pork and beef options, a limit on the galbi orders too btw. \n\nTypical sides- potato salad, sprouts, kimchee (which was already cut smaller), and lettuce salad. Easy to ask for more. Steamed egg and steamed rice abundance. Also, someone at our table ordered the kimchee rice which came with a fried egg on top. Unfortunately, she doesn't eat beef and they didn't specify that it would have beef in it (which is traditional, but I guess she did not know that). \n\nThe mango soju cocktail was one of the highlights of the experience- it tasted like juice. \n\nOverall, I'll stick to my KBBQ places in Ktown. However, if you want some AYCE KBBQ and you're stuck in SF, I don't think you have any other options.", "author": "Arezou A."}

The coupon had a minimum order of $100, so I made sure to spend this amount.  After we ate, he would not honor the coupon.  So, I lost the amount of money that I had paid for the coupon, and was in the hole for over $100.  The owner was extremely unprofessional and unwaivering.  We decided to bite the bullet and pay the bill, but made it clear to him that we consider the tip included (the amount was way over what it should have been had he not backed out of honoring his own coupon).  Being that he unabashedly committed an act of false advertising (which is illegal), I now am concerned that he will not give the waitstaff their fair share of what we paid, even though I clearly instructed him to do so.

Perfect for the younger crowd though. \n\nWe did the $19.99 buffet and ordered a large variety of the top menu. Short ribs are limited to one per person, but not everyone in my group liked the taste of them as much so the rest of us got more. One of my friends recommended cutting the meat after it was cooked and it worked wonderfully. There was only one variety of chicken (garlic miso) and several varieties of pork belly (spicy, miso, regular) . I didn't care for the pork belly very much, however, because it's basically  50% fat and 50% meat. \n\nThey ran out of rice wraps, and the steamed egg was mediocre. We were downing water like crazy because there were no rice wraps to balance out the intense savory flavor on the seasoned meat, but we didn't want to spend extra on the rice. My favorite was the unseasoned meat--the beef shank--which was tender and did not have much fat/tendon attached.

There is a light up menu conveniently posted on the wall at every booth. We were immediately served those little Korean side dishes which were alright. They included kimchi, bean spouts, pickled veggies, mashed potatoes, and a salad. I thought the side dishes lacked variety. I've had much better selection at other kbbq spots. \nThe menu straight up sucks. The $20 AYCE basically mostly included the more unusual items that people rarely order like beef intestine or  pork skin (?). The only good/normal options they had (in my opinion) was the brisket, pork belly (not good AT ALL and way too freakin salty), and short rib. Mind you, the short rib is limited to one order per customer, which is dumb cuz it's supposed to be AYCE. Because of that, I felt like I could only order the brisket. \nAlso, most bbq places give you free garlic and jalape\u00f1os for the grill. This place charges for it! Like why.

First time experience and I'm traumatized. Ok... I'm being a bit dramatic but geeeeeeeez!!! From the moment bf and I walked in, it was hell lol. Im not that picky. I didn't mind the wait nor did I mind the noisy level or how busy it was, but WHAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF WAS CUSTOMER SERVICE! The food was average but can't complain since Im not a picky eater. I've never experience any type of Korean bbQ or whatever. Seeing all these pics from friends instagram/facebook going to yakiniQ, looked like they enjoyed it and looked fun but naaaah my experience sucked :( I guess I can't really blame the staff cause they are super busy but at least be nice and apologetic. Customers would understand better if staff was nice and humble. Guy up front at check in was a little rude at first but in the end when we were called up to our table, he was nice. Bf and I started cookin and I guess we didnt really know how to use the grill. One server walked pass and pretty much looked down on us and gave us shit like \"you guys need to know how to cook because you guys are burning the grill\". Like whaaaat wtf? Ok maybe we didnt know how to use the grill since it was pretty much our first time. Still! Server should've treated us with respect and gave us guidance. I'd love to have some sort of instructions to make the experience more fun or something. He quickly change the grill and walked off. He didn't even show us whats best. Bf and I felt so embarrassed and ashamed so the next server who walked past us, we asked him how do this. He kindly helped by telling us which meats to cook first. It was a relief but it still didn't make up for what happened. Anyways, after that.. I felt so bad that I didn't have appetite, ate a little bit and just wanted to pay quickly and get out. \n\nVery disappointed!!!

Served as a triple feature of decoration, lighting, and menu of course! $20 ayce yes please! Kinda bummed that bulgogi wasn't part of the deal but you can have it for $25! \n\nThe boneless galbi was soooo good! Except you can only get one serving per person in the ayce menu.. Sad but at least they let us have a taste. All the meats were good: garlic butter chicken, beef brisket is nom esp if u let it get crispy, pork belly was sooo good too! Really thick piece nom nom my mouth is watering just thinking about it...now I'm craving more kbbq! Also they have kinda weird meats like intestine and tripe.. I tried tripe (i love tripe just don't know how to cook it) but the piece that I kept on the grill the longest got soft and yummy! Def try it if you are feeling adventurous! Next time I wanna try the intestine! \n\nSides were great as well we had kimchi (so good crispy on the grill with the rice), and bean sprouts on the grill too! There were also some type of mashed potato that was good, japchae was okay (would be better if it was cold or hot not luke warm), and there was some sort of leafy side which was also good. Their salad was delish and dressing was good too better than ones I've had before. Has a more coleslaw-y taste. Ooh and they also gave us steamed eggs... Even thiugh we didn't order it...but we aren't complaining lol.\n\nWe got seated really quickly which Made us really happy because we were starving. We came before 7 and the place was busy but not too bad. About 15 min later the place got super busy with lots of people waiting to eat. The servers did a wonderful job trying to please everybody. They were very busy but everytime we asked for something they helped us with a smile. Also I liked how they switched our grill plate everytime it gets too burnt! \n\nOne bad thing about the place is that there's not a lot of ventilation esp not above the grills which caused the smoke to go to our face.\n\nOther than that...def can't wait to go back sometime!\n\n4.5 stars!!!!", "author": "Sunshine M."}

Each time before I come here, I always have a huge excitement and anticipation. $19.99 AYCE is a good deal. This place is good for a large group (4+). They tend to give big portions of each meat dishes. If you planning to go on a dinner for two, I recommend asking the waiters to give you smaller portions on each item. That way you can try out different selections of meat. Their ban chan dishes are ok, but a good start off if you're hungry. They only allow three dishes at once, so pace yourself. \n\nMy faves are the spicy pork belly, brisket, beef big intestine, beef tongue, and pork neck meat. Anything fatty goes well in my book . The tripe is ehhhh...just really dry. Gizzard is ok too, not too exciting. \n\nService is good.

We were fortunate to get there and seated early, even after waiting for another person for 30 minutes, as the line petered out the door in no time.\n\nConsidering how there's limited options in the Bay for some decent (let alone good) AYCE KBBQ in comparision to KTown (off the top of my head, I can only think of Bob Sang, Jong Ga House, and the newly opened Gen Korean BBQ in North San Jose), YakiniQ serves its purpose well. \n\nWe all opted for the $25 option, which included prime beef tongue, marinated bulgogi, pork neck meat and rib finger (basically finger sized rib pieces), on top of the meats listed in the $20 option. Some of the highlights included the short ribs, bulgogi, fire squid, and butter chicken. The only one that I felt wasn't up to par was the neck meat, as it was too fatty. They also provide sesame oil and chili dipping sauces, both of which are excellent options to enhance the meat. \n\nTheir banchan is limited to Cosmo brand kimchi (the one you can find at Costco), mashed potato, salad, bean sprouts, japchae, and seaweed, which was a bit disappointing as I felt they could have offered fish cakes (my personal favorite) at the very least. In any case, it still felt a bit lacking.\n\nYou're better off acquainting yourself with good ole Cha Mi Seul (that's a brand of soju), than going for a flavored soju, as the syrup isn't mixed very well. Oh, and it's $11 for a small bottle, so you might as well save your money and buy it at the nearest Korean mart later. \n\nFinally, I was kind of irked by the fact that the establishment started to time us RIGHT when we walked in at 5, even though we were seated at 5:30. But I guess that's because it was a Friday night and people wanted to get their grub on also. \n\ntl;dr: Satisfactory place to get your KBBQ fix.", "author": "Viet N."}

Location is great, the kalbi beef is good (but limit one, you'll have to pay for additional orders), rest of food is really bland, sauces are weak, and waitstaff crew is entitled AF.\n\nNot once did they tell us we had a limit on how much time we could spend eating. Although it's not unheard of, they could've specified at the beginning of the meal. Near the end of this unspoken time limit, they rudely told us it was the \"last call\". We were surprised (and honestly, kinda pissed) because we took our time talking and catching up. If we knew there was a limit, we would've ordered steadily to make the $20-$25/person cost worth it. \n\nIt's AYCE, so I expected some regulation but they were stingy. Each person probably got about 2 meat dishes (small) through the entire meal. Granted, we took time eating/ordering, they purposely delayed coming around to take our next order. Other than the boneless short ribs, everything else was either bland or way too saturated with sauce. Honestly, I think the meat itself was poor quality which is why they covered it up with some cheap mix as marinade. Not only did it taste horrible, the dipping sauces they provided did not alleviate the pain! I can't even identify what it was. I've been to many KBBQ places and I've never tasted a damn sauce that resembled the atrocity that this was. \n\nAgain, no one came around. OK, fine. Time's up, finish the food and pay.\n\nWe paid the bill and tipped well given the service we were provided.

But we all were pleasantly surprised that it was a less than 15 minute wait for us to be seated - albeit we got there at about 6pm so it was a little earlier than the rush hour for dinner it seemed because as soon as we were seated, a flood of people came in.\n\nI ordered the spicy chicken and my friends ordered the spicy pork belly and the brisket - all of which were absolutely delectable. We also ordered some spicy kimchi fried rice (a favorite korean dish of mine) and some bibimbap (which I had never had before). We also somehow got two orders of steamed egg which none of us ordered so we assumed it came with the rice and/or bibimbap. But we were wrong because when we got our check, we saw we were charged extra for it. Grrr! But hey, they were delicious so it was okay really.\n\nSpeaking of the check, for 3 people, the price we paid was beyond reasonable and for the amount of food we got, it was definitely worth it. (I've recently gone to the Juban Yakiniku place in Burlingame, CA, and while the meat there is far superior in quality, the portion sizes did not match the prices.)\n\nSo why does this place not get 5 stars? Because as my friends had pointed out, it was not that great of a place compared to some previous places they had gone to. For one, there did not seem to be any vent above our table (or it was broken and we just couldn't see it) which made sense since one of my friends got the pleasure of being doused with an endless stream of smoke straight into her face. Her eyes were watering for the whole experience. Even more so, we had a lot of trouble with our grill, which went out 3 times before one of the waiters realized that it was broken. He fixed it and all was well. Yay him and yay for peaceful eating after that!\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this place and have been telling people how much I want to take them there and go back!", "author": "Hannah D."}

At around $20 per person, YakiniQ is one of the most affordable options in the Bay Area and for $5 more, you can get more choices of meat.

Never seen anything short on banchans at a Korean joint. Where are the caramelized potato, radish, anchovies, etc??? This was a downer for sure.\n\nThe meat was decent. Not very up to par great...

At first sight, the worn out carpet leading upstairs to the restaurant leads you to a relatively neat and aired out space.  The meat aromas tickle your nose.  Another set of stairs reminds me of a run down city home.  Only one stall in the women's restroom was working, and presentation was not so decent.  Remember that you cannot be seated until your entire party arrives.  Each front desk person has different rules.  One let us sign up as we waited for our party to arrive.  The other said \"NO.\"  It would help if the front desk people used their manners.  It's easy to see through to their frustrations.  It's definitelyn ot a place to bring your friends who are new to K bbq, espceially AYCE, because this place defnitely is NOT AYCE.  At first, we got denied an extra seat because the booth was suppose to fit us all comfortably.  It was fine but having people reach over each other isn't comfortable.  Then we were only allowed to order three dishes at a time (this was during the start of the 2nd hour they were open on Sunday; there were a handful of tables left).  Our plan was to cook and stuff ourselves.  Once one person orders something from the second tier, the whoel table pays for the price of the 2nd tier (ok, reasonable).  Their goal seemed to be to serve you slow and toward the end of your unstated 2-hours they ask you \"do you need anything else?  anything else?  (x3 more times)\" hoping to get you to order lots of food that you won't be able to finish, and thus would have to pay extra for.  That's when the eating really began!  Finally, we didn't get anymore steamed eggs (we got two for a party of five) because they were running out of bowls, as if we were the ones hoarding it all, when we had just one (an empty one).  Definitely felt a little targetted when they said we were here the longest (@ 1 hr 20 minutes, and we understand that there are lots of people waiting, and the food was still cooking), rushing us to get the bill ready, and explaining everything to us to a tea.  The servers finally decided to shut us off, claiming that we HAD our last call, and that we ate too much?  I've never felt so embarrassed to take my friends out to eat: to a place with enough options ideally to make every meat-eater's stomachs happy.  Speaking of happy stomachs, one of us ended up puking that night from food poisoning.  Don't know why, don't know how.  Unfortunately, the rude few left a lasting impression compared to the nicer, accommodating half.  It would be a lot easier if they had a Sign of Rules somewhere to heed warning.\n \nThe customer is definitely NOT right, and it is apparent that they do not like it if you don't do things their way.

I mean, yea it does need to get clean, but once you get to the dining area, all you smell is that good smoky bbq. They had a waitlist on the counter and I put my name and phone number. They call your phone number when your table is ready so you wouldn't have to wait any longer.\n\nThe table was already prepared with the small little Korean dishes they had. I don't really dig those things, I only tried their cabbage salad and the cold noodles which were both really good! \n\nSince it was our first time there, we didn't know how ordering works. Our waiter simply explained to us what to do. First we choose which menu to order from; either the $20 or the $25 one. We chose the $20 one. Oncee you've chosen which menu you want, you can only pick 3 meat choices at a time. I kinda liked this because it really doesn't make you waste any food. \n\nAt first, I thought that they had really bad service before me and my friends kept raising our hands to get their attention when we needed more meat or we needed a new grill. Then we eventually saw this little button on the wall that rings our table for the waiter to let them know we need service. After we started using the button, the service got a lot better and we were not ignored anymore lol.\n\nAll their meats were really good. The ones that I absolutely loved were the spicy pork belly and the galbi. Our table got their spicy pork belly so many times cos it was so good. The galbi was excellent too.

We went early to beat the crowd which was a good plan because there weren't that many tables inside, which would be a problem if you had a big group of people. We were seated to the left as you walk in which I enjoyed because we were able to sit by the window.\n\nThe menus are located on the wall which is super convenient and they have the PUSH CALL BUTTONS!! They are little grey buttons located on the wall, and when you press it a waiter will come and help you out, whether you need more meat, banchan, water, etc. I haven't seen these call buttons since I lived in Japan so it was a pleasant surprise to see them. Definitely make use of them, it's easier than trying to flag down the busy waiters!\n\n$19.99 per person and you get a great selection of meat. We ordered the brisket, fire squid and pork belly. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed the brisket, it was thin cut and tasted awesome with the spicy sauce on the side. The fire squid wasn't too good, it was very tough and SUPER spicy! The pork belly was a HUGE slab of meat (or fat). I couldn't believe the size of it and wasn't sure what it was at first when the waiter brought it to our table. Make sure you cut it up before cooking, otherwise it will take forever to heat up. \n\nThe banchan were decent, the seaweed, cabbage salad, and bean sprouts were our favorites. Kimchi was solid but the potato salad lacked flavor.

I didn't get to eat the spicy chicken this time around because I think the waiter misheard our request and brought the spicy pork belly instead...didn't try that because it looks like bacon or it is bacon and I just don't like bacon at all. \n\nThe hostess's attitude is another reason for a minus star.

At 6:30 we were trying to cram ourselves into busses that were packed which was nearly impossible for 19 people, so we called in to give the restaurant a heads up. They seemed nice and extended our time till 6:45. Okay so we sent one person onto the bus so she could go get the tables on time because it was for sure that all 19 of us were not going to be able to go onto the bus. When our messenger got there, the hostess told her she couldn't get the table until the WHOLE party was there. Okay so she told the hostess that we'll be here soon, and he said to her that we only have till 6:55 or else our reservation would be pushed back till 9:30. The other 18 of us heard this so we split into groups running around the city like we were doing the Amazing Race just to try to get to the restaurant by 6:55. We all literally had to run our asses off for at least 1.5 miles. Majority of us (15/18) had arrived to the restaurant before 6:55 so we told the hostess that most of us are here and a few are just lagging behind a few blocks, but he said we could not get our tables until the other three laggers arrive. But c'mon 16/19 of us were already at the restaurant and your tables were already empty, just let us sweaty starving customers sit and eat.

The only place really around in SF that does this, ok let's go.\n\nCame here on a Sunday night with the boy and our two friends to have a \"Pre-Thanksgiving\" meal.\n\nWe waited over an hour and half to finally get seating. Multiple times we had to ring the bell and wait on our orders. We were essentially competing with our orders getting prepared after large large groups. Our main waitress and random waiters clearly ignored our table multiple times that our grill at one point for over 15 minutes burned to oblivion with no food on top that it had to be changed when our orders finally came out.\n\nWhat made the experience a little more disappointing was that the main person at the cash register saw our table not being serviced but made his way to the table behind us with clearly 3 drunk girls to have fun chats with them. Even when he eyed our table, which was right in front of him, he didn't even seem to want to approach us until my friend had to call him over and ask where our order was.\n\nI will say, huge shout out to the one waiter who made his way to our table to personally apologize and reassure us that our orders were coming out. I don't think he even had to be anywhere near our tables but he not only once, but multiple times came through to help us out. \n\nAside from this, a few tips:\n\n* Only tables of 8 or more get reservations\n* If you're a table of 4 or 2, good luck, you're fighting for the same tables \n* Minimum 2 people must eat here... sorry for my independent folks out there!\n* Only one order of galbi per person (and somehow, we asked for 4 since there were 4 of us and they only gave us 3)\n* Oh right, only 3 orders per round\n* Brisket, fire squid, galbi, spicy pork belly - these were our go tos\n* Don't expect great side dishes, we only had some sort of cole slaw, potato salad with raisins in it, kimchi, seaweed, and japchae\n* Have patience\n* Be prepared to ooze kbbq smell from your pores.\n* Be prepared for so high speed up beat music, I forgot the genre but I hear it's supposed to make people eat faster. Who knows, just drown it out.", "author": "Leslie L."}

It was shortly after my dinner @ YakiniQ, but I ate way too much and passed out so here I am a week later.\n\nNo joke, this is my 3rd review of YakiniQ, in like 45 days.  What can I say? I had the KBBQ itch and if it ain't broke, why fix it?\n\nSo YakiniQ, here I come.\n\nDear YakiniQ,\n\nYour brisket never disappoints, your Bulgogi beef was well-marinated and extremely flavorful, and your Korean short rib was, for the lack of better term, speechless. It's now Sunday evening and I'm still burping out awesomeness.\n\nOh, and this \"Spicy Pork Belly\" thing on your menu - something I've never had before - was truly life changing.  I have to say, you're pretty darn creative. I mean, \"SPICY BACON\" is about as close to food porn as it gets.  If I had the option, I would put spicy pork belly a.k.a. bacon with my scramble eggs and a bowl of rice for breakfast.\n\nDespite all my love, I hate you for the food coma, I hate you for changing my post meal plans from a night of debacle on Polk Street to \"I'm just gonna go home\", I hate you for the self conscious Saturday morning weigh-in at the gym, I hate you for the extra cardio workout I have to do just so I can go back soon, and I hate you because I didn't eat again until Saturday afternoon.  That whole \"EAT MULTIPLE SMALL MEALS IS BETTER\" idea? Went right out of the window.\n\nLastly, I do want to thank you for the 64oz Hite cervezas.  My fellow KBBQ soldiers and I have never seen or heard about this Costco-sized bottle of greatness. Although this mega-brew was not your creation, you get the credit for \"putting the 64oz Hite on our map\"!.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKBBQ Fan.", "author": "Dave K."}

The service was incredibly fast and efficient.  Within minutes of pressing the call bell there was a member of the waitstaff at the table.  If you ordered more meat, it was brought within minutes.  The value is pretty great too considering the price of meat these days.  I love to be able to cook my own meat at the table.  So for me that is a huge plus.  Most of the meat tasted pretty good.

We waited for close to 2 hours before we got seated. The service here was decently good considering how busy they were. Each order could only be 3 different things off the ayce menu.\n\nWe got:\nBeef brisket: this is my favorite since I like unmarinated meat. I felt like this dish was inconsistent because we would get plates that were fatty and plates that were super lean.\n\nSpicy pork belly: This was really good, lots of flavor and the meat was very tender from the extensive marination. \n\nGalbi: This was superrrrrrrrrr flavorful. A bit too flavorful imo. Especially since they RAN OUT of rice paper wrap T.T keep in mind we were one of the first people in here. So this means they ran out after the first round of diners. :/\n\nGarlic Butter Chicken: We ordered this in the first round and the server dumped this entire plate on the grill when he set it down. Mistake #1. Since chicken takes a long time to cook, it was another 15 min before we got to eat anything. It was pretty good though, but not worth the time you spent waiting for it to cook..\n\nAfter maybe an hour or so, the server told us we were on last call :[ I didn't feel like we ate that much but we got kicked out..\n\nOverall, I am not sure it is worth the long wait.. the food was not exceptional but not bad either.", "author": "Seliya G."}

Located smack dab in the middle of the city, it's fair game for anyone to come and check it out.\n\nThere are two choices you can select from: $20 and $24. The only difference between the two is an additional four types of meat on the $24 list: prime beef tongue, bul-go-gi, pork neck meat, and beef rib finger. All of my friends and I opted for the $20 list because we didn't care for the \"unique\" meats with the exception of bul-go-gi.\n\nI came here with a group of 12 so we did the smart thing and made reservations earlier in the day. I highly, highly, HIGHLY, recommend making reservations if you have a group of 6+. When we arrived at our table, the ban chan (appetizers) were already set out for us. They provided us little bowls of jap chae (glass noodles), seaweed, potato salad, kim chi, marinated bean sprouts, and cabbage with a creamy salad dressing. Though limited, they were pretty tasty. \n\nThere are about12 choices of meat on the $20 menu but we stuck to the basics: pork belly, beef brisket, spicy chicken, and fried squid. The pork belly was a bit too fatty for my taste but the beef brisket and spicy chicken were delicious. We also ordered several orders of the steamed egg and rice rolls. I recommend ordering the rice rolls to eat with the meat! It provides a little bit of a cooling sensation so the sizzling meat doesn't burn the root of your mouth.\n\nOverall this place is 3.5 stars because the owner was so sweet and accommodating. I could tell that the waiters were a bit aggravated at times but it's understandable. I'm sure working here can be stressful, especially since customers are constantly asking for refills and whatnot.", "author": "Annie S."}

It was Friday and we came at around 730 PM..if you have a smaller party you'll be passed up by the people with 8 or so people, until a table for 3-4 opens up which will extend your wait so keep that in mind.  The wait was at least an hour and a half, so if you don't mind you should probably get a drink or two from the bar..it would be nice if they had a better staging setup there..\n\nThe place is extremely crowded, smokey, there is Kpop blaring loudly throughout the restaurant, and the waitstaff appear extremely busy and understaffed.  If you need something there is a bell on the wall under the menu that you can use to ring an attendant, or you really need to flag them down to get their attention..this is the Korean style..making direct eye contact won't work here..\n\nI briefly read through some of the reviews and it seems a common complaint is the wait staff..first off let me say that Korean Koreans can be very blunt, upfront, abrasive, brash, etc it's part of the culture..(I'm Korean in case you didn't notice), combine that with the transition into another language/culture and something gets lost along the way.  But as an Americanized Korean I can tell you it is still off putting to me and it can most definitely ruin your night..so please try to forgive them and don't take it too personally..they really don't mean to be that way..one of the waiters asked if we were Korean and let us have a few off the menu items so that was definitely a perk..\n\nThe banchan was basic at best, but you're here for the BBQ right?  They charge you extra for lettuce leaf, which you should get if you get Samgyeopsal (pork belly), I had to ask for the garlic slices, and they did not have enoki mushrooms, or Perillo leaves (this is all standard fair in Korea)..they also do not give you rice unless you ask for it..ill just presume the average person doesn't expect to see those things there..the gochujang was pretty good, as well as the salt and oil trays..Most of the meats were very good (samgyeopsal, pork neck bone, galbi, bulgogi meats) and some were just ok (mostly the spicy meats were ok), but I did enjoy the spicy squid, tripe..the spicy items weren't as good..\n\nHonestly, 4 is a fair score for the food, but the wait was terrible, and the staff could be a bit friendlier..especially after finding out we were Korean, they were a bit nicer, but not by much..I would rate the service at 2-3..but looking around the room there were many loud obnoxious, demanding people so I can see how a person would just into auto pilot mode and try to just finish out the day..the price is also very reasonable considering you get unlimited banchan, meats, and a single Korean dish will cost about $15..", "author": "Brian S."}

I came here once on a saturday and waited for 2.5 hours!!! I don't think I've waited that long for any other food. \n\nI think one of the reason why people enjoy coming here is the affordable price. 19.99 for all you can eat (basic stuff, kalbi, bulgogi, chicken, pork belly, etc) and 24.99 for extra beef tongue (amazing) and intestines. But they are very smart. Although the all you can eat is cheap but they charge everything else, such as lettuce wrap, pickle daikon wrap, rice, soon doo boo soup, etc. They are still a bit cheaper but I just can't believe they charge lettuce wrap! That's basic KBBQ essential! So instead, I just eat it with the rice paper wrap, which is very yummy and it comes with the all you can eat.\n\nMy favorites are:\nbeef tongue\nspicy octopus (very spicy)\nkalbi (they limit how many orders you can get, I believe it's 1 per person, an order comes with 3 pieces)\npork belly\nmiso pork belly\npickle daikon wrap\nsteamed egg\n\nIt is pretty annoying that every time you order, they only let you order three things. For example, you can order steamed egg, more salad, beef tongue, then you have to wait until the waiter/waitress comes back next time to order 3 more things. It is definitely a lot of work for the waitress and even I feel annoyed by asking for stuff a hundred times. \n\nIt is super smokey here. Sometimes it's hard to breathe. Don't make plans to go out after because you smell like bbq.

But let me tell you, all these other Yelpers are right! I've come back twice more since writing my initial review, with both experiences more disappointing than the last.\n\nThe second time, we came as a party of 6 and got the AYCE. Yes, we ordered alcohol. Yes, we got rice and lettuce and all the other things they nickel and dime you for here ($2 for 6 leaves of lettuce is a bit pricey, right?). But still, they stopped us after 3 orders of galbi, even though each person is entitled to 1 order of galbi each. They claimed they had run out, but it was 9PM and we saw several other tables still receiving their galbi. There were several times they brought out rounds of meat for us and nearly threw it at us without as much as a word of acknowledgement. We had to wave furiously and at several people to get anything to our table. And best part? After 90 minutes, they came over and told us \"last call\", before coming back with the bill.\n\nThe second time I returned, we called to ask about the wait for a party of 2, and the owner told us we could get seated right away. When we got there 5 minutes later, the owner refused to sit my boyfriend and I in a booth, despite the fact that it was 9PM on a slow-moving Tuesday evening and there were 5 booths open. The funny thing? He seated a Korean coupe who had been right before us in the queue.\n\nYakiniQ has pretty much taken advantage of the fact that there is little competition for KBBQ in SF.

The cheap prices and all-you-can-eat format attract lots of younger folks, so longish lines are the norm; they will take your mobile # to ease the waiting pain, but it's usually windy outside so you probably won't venture far. As stated in multiple other reviews, there are two levels, 20 bucks, and 24 bucks with the latter having the highly marinated and ubiquitously popular beef bulgolgi. But if you are adventurous and can subside with the more exotic parts of the animal you may be fine on the lower level. Btw, don't miss the steamed egg, we ordered 3. The banchan apps are decent but more filling than beautiful. Overall a fun experience, and would go back, but as my Korean go-to I prefer more menu variety, better banchan, and slightly better ambiance, although I do love the blaring K-pop videos here.

We got to the place maybe 40 minutes until closing time. \n\nInitially service was very attentive and very fast with our orders and cleaning the grill although they completely forgot our drinks. By our third round of meats, service started getting less attentive. The grill wasn't changed as consistently and so our food would burn and stick which made it harder to cook.\n\nA little after our third round, we were told the kitchen was closing and that they would be taking the last orders. Most of the time, I leave KBBQ places stuffed to the brim but I left feeling a little more than content. We definitely felt rushed.\n\nWe decided to go for the $19.99 deal each. Food wise, we ordered 4 rounds of about 3 different meat plates each round. These are the meats we chose:\n-Brisket: pretty good meat wise, but not necessarily flavor wise\n-Spicy pork belly: 2nd juiciest choice but I think this had better flavor although spicier than my usual preference.\n-Garlic Butter Chicken: pretty good flavor wise but I more annoying to cook because everyone worries about how well-cooked it is.\n-Spicy Squid: really huge cuts of basically calimari steak. Hard to determine done-ness of this too because none of us have ever really cooked that. Therefore, not really ideal to get on our part. \n-Pork skin - GOOD...but only if you cook it to a certain point. I prefer it crisp and that's hard to cook it on the grill and heat they have there. Ends up being more chewy and not really good texture. \n-Beef Honeycomb tripe: I don't really like tripe so I didn't eat this one. Everyone else loved it. \n-Beef Short Rib: My favorite because it is juicy and had enough flavor for me. \n\nAfter we ordered our first set of meats, we wondered where our rice was so we asked our waiter. We didn't realize that rice was not a complimentary thing here which is pretty off-putting for an AYCE KBBQ place. \n\nWe were also given a steamed egg dish without asking for it so we all assumed it was complimentary but we were charged for it later on. I didn't like that.

So i was disappointed by that but for San Francisco who has few to none AYCE bbq places its definitely a step in the right direction.  \n\nWhen you pass the big ominous wooden doors you enter to a set of stair welcoming you.  The carpets are a little dingy so dont dwell on it for too long.  A the top of the steps there a lot of tables and a couple good big tables that large parties can use.  We sat over by the kitchen which wasn't that bad.  We were left pitchers of water, which I'm always grateful for since i drink a lot of water.\n\nThe meal is about $19 for the standard AYCE bbq except that the galbi is not ayce. BOO!!  Its limited to one serving per guest.  WTF!!! and bulgolgi is only on the premium ayce which is $23.  The premium only adds like 4 additional meats including bulgogi.  I think it'd be better if they just move blogogi over to the standard and moved galbi to the premium and let those guys who pay the extra $5 eat all they can of it.  The sides were good but we only had about 5 sides.  I'm used to seeing like 7 or 8 different kinds.  Overall though the food was good.  The highlights were the galbi, miso pork, and the very spicy squid.\n\nThe service was pretty fast and we received our food refills pretty quick although more than once they forgot to bring out a meat that we requested, so they needed to be reminded.  Our grill were changed often and quickly without us asking.  We ate our fill and was very content.  We drank a lot of beer hey had 1.6L bottles of HIte. \n\nOK so overall it wasn't that bad.  They could improve both on service consistency and foods choices.  I've been to many different korean bbq spots in both norcal and socal and they need to step up their game if they want to considered one of the best in norcal.  \n\nThis is for management who might read this:\n\nThis maybe one person's opinion but I really think you should consider the menu change i mentioned in this review.  Honestly there is really no bonus to get the premium bbq. For the extra money all you get more is bulgogi, beef tongue, pork neck and couple other random stuff.

I guess you need like 10 or more to do a reservation, which kinda sucks because if you're really hungry (like I was) all you wanna do is be seated ASAP to start eating ASAP.

My favorites are the Garlic buttered chicken thighs, brisket and pork belly. \n\nQuick Service; when you ring for a waiter they bring you (most) of the items you requested. \n\nThe Owner; he is such a character to watch. This 5'5 guy has a walkie talkie at his side always as he directs all of his staff. He was barking orders so fast and so loud that it felt like I was watching someone kinda shot caller ordering his gang members around or if Han from FF3 had a Korean BBQ place. Lol\n\nThe Staff is courteous; Even the owner thanks his customers. They change your grill when they see it's turning a tad too black from cooking. Black bits = burnt tasting food. \n\n\nThe Cons:\n\nIt's Busy; not only is it a popular restaurant, the restaurant is SMALL. It's only one floor and many people love coming here to eat and drink. The wait staff are hustling and bustling to get everyone's orders and sometimes they don't give all that you ask at once because there are so many others who need them as well. But don't worry, they eventually come back and bring you your items. \n\nIt's Smoky; There are no windows.

For an extra $4 you get beef tongue, pork neck, and bulgogi. Since I MUST have bulgogi the $23.99 is a no brainer. Had no complaints about the meat quality. Banchan selection is more limited than what I expect from Oakland AYCE KBBQ spots. I don't understand why they charge extra for lettuce (sheisty much?). And they don't serve Yakult or that sweet rice drink at the end of the meal either. \n\nSERVICE.\nOur servers were attentive and we were never without meat, which is the point of AYCE, right?\n\nAMBIANCE.\nYoungins--mostly 20 somethings. Loud with music playing and a big screen tv. Definitely a good place to celebrate.\n\nRESERVATIONS. \nYou need at least a party of 8 to make a reservation. We were able to make a reservation the day before on a holiday weekend. \n\nTip: The stools open up for you to store your coats/purses. Space efficient and lets you leave with one less thing that smells like grilled meat.", "author": "Kristine W."}

So here's some tips, courtesy of my coworker, who planned a fantastic group trip to pig out on KBBQ:\n\n- If you can, make a reservation. This place gets busy, and you probably won't enjoy standing around waiting while your senses are bombarded by the scent of grilled meat.\n- Everyone in your reservation needs to be there in order to be seated, so make every effort (aka, nag people) to make sure people get there on time.\n- Lower some of your standards when it comes to the ambience. All the grease and smoke doesn't really translate to a super clean place (the floor is fairly gross).\n- But be pleasantly surprised by some forethought in the choice of chairs: You can take off the seat of the chair and put your jackets/bags inside the hollow chair so things won't smell like BBQ when you leave!\n- Drinks: Order enough soju and Hite beer for everyone to have a good time\n- Meat: Go with the $19.99 per person AYCE option. Eat the less flavorful meats first (beef brisket, pork belly) and then finish off with the more flavorful meats and the gal-bi. \n- Side dishes: I think the steamed egg is delicious. The rice paper is also fun to wrap around the meat and rounds out the grease nicely.\n- Keep ordering and eating meat!\n- You think you're full? Think again. Order and eat more meat.\n- Sleep really well because you're full of meat and soju. Hope that you can wake up and make it to work at a reasonable time the next day.", "author": "Brittany C."}

If you're frugal like I am, then you know I won't be paying for rice when an equal object is given away for free. \n\nAnother thing that irks me: lettuce is also a thing that gets charged. If I have to be charged for lettuce, can't you upgrade it to perilla leaves?  At least then my money will be worth something. \n\nKalbi is limited to two pieces per person. If I could, I'd only eat kalbi. I notice the other kbbq spot I go to is doing this as well. \n \nLastly, I don't care for the sauces they offer at the table, I always ask for ssamjang and the mix it up with the chili in the sauce plate.

We had to ask multiple times before that was even brought to us. \n\nSecond, the food wasn't as great either it was only sub-par and each time we ordered the portions kept getting smaller and smaller. There was also quite the amount of fat on most of the plates.\n\nThird, this angry waiter guy comes to us and tells us to remove one of our drink bottles that we brought with us. Of course we were respectful and moved it off the table and we just weren't aware that we put it on the table because we did just get seated. The waiter then continued to just stand there staring at us for quite awhile and we were just so lost wondering why. Then, in an angry voice he pointed at one of our water bottles saying \"That too\" with a really bad attitude. Like okay, I understand the other drink but you're going to get upset at us because of a water bottle? That's just not okay. He could've told us in a much nicer tone. \n\nFourth. At the end of our meal we paid the bill and got up to leave. As we were walking down the stairs the same waiter came after us in a loud voice saying, \" Don't come here if you guys don't have money\" and he made it sound like we didn't pay our entire bill. Apparently he got upset that we didn't tip him more than we did. He also went on a short rant about us not appreciating his service and what not. Tips are suppose to be a courtesy and the amount you receive reflects the service that is given. I understand that some food service workers need the tips to fill their pay but, this waiter's service was neither good or well-mannered.", "author": "Sean W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-01-17", "description": "The galbi, spicy pork belly, and brisket was great, but the service absolutely ruined my night.\n\nI wanted to like this place since it was the only AYCE KBBQ place in SF. After living in LA and having access to a million AYCE KBBQ places for 5 years, I was hoping this place was just half as good as some places in LA. Boy, was I disappointed.\n\nWe never felt so rushed to eat, ever. About an hour into our meal, they kept asking us if it was our last plate so they could close our tab and cut us off. Well...by that time, we only had 3, maybe 4 plates of meat at most. Their kitchen was horribly slow when it came to bring out meat. Our first plate came out quickly, but everything else took at least 10 minutes after we ordered. At one point, we were sitting around for 30 minutes wondering where our meat was. Turned out our waiter did not put our order in.\n\nOur food came out so slow that we had to get our grill changed with every order of meat. Worst of all, our waiter kept telling us that we couldn't order our next plate of meat until we finished what we had. Sure, I get that if the meat comes out quickly, but if it takes 10 minutes....it becomes a problem. Our grills kept getting charred up because the meat took so long to come out. Twice, we had our grill replaced before the meat came out, but the meat took so long that all the oil burned off before the meat even came.\n\nAlso, they don't explain how the galbi portions work. Our waiter told us that one order of galbi fulfilled the one portion per person, which turned out to be a lie. When our check came, it showed that we only got one portion of galbi. After reading Yelp, it seems like you can get one order per person, so we should have been able to order four plates of galbi for our table of four, and not one.\n\nAt the end of our meal, none of us were close to full. Not even content. I don't think I'll ever visit this place again, and I will do my best to tell my friends to stay away from this place like the plague.", "author": "David F."}

From the waitstaff to a number of fellow patrons to the quality of meat they provide you, this place is plain ASSHOLE.  The pricing is OK, but the meat quality and selection is pretty shitty: the beef had little to no marble but huge strips of fat, and the pork items were just... fat fat fat instead of layered meat and fat as proper pork belly should be!  Then the chicken was drier than a witch's tit, and the panchan were blander than beige.  The flames on the grill weren't hot enough so everything just kinda simmered in its own fetid juices until well-done instead of achieving a tasty char that is the whole point of Korean BBQ anyway.  \n\nThe waitstaff were horrible: they brought no settings, no beverages, were pushing us to order before we even took our jackets off, were unavailable when we needed anything, didn't bring 3-4 items we ordered, brought 2-3 items we didn't, then kept on pushing us to order towards the end when we weren't sure if we needed more food or had enough to eat, and never changed our grills until they were pitch black (we had to ask) and without this attitude like they were getting their teeth pulled while being sodomized by a Cadillac.  And everyone single one of them had the same raging bitch face of combined fury/disgust/sodomization the whole time.  Not a single one of them could be reasoned with: whether it was asking how long the wait for a table could potentially be, to telling them to wait before attempting to turn off our grill because we were still eating, they all demonstrated the intelligence and common sense of a paramecium... or a self-conceited millennial.   \n\nThen there were a bunch of downright bizarre patrons standing in the middle of the walkways, yakking their heads off in something far greater in magnitude than simple outdoor voices, blocking waitstaff and other patrons from getting/to from tables and the bathrooms with their vapid and idiotic human equivalent of Brownian movement to match their equally microbial intelligence.  Who the hell congregates in the walkways in a restaurant?  I swear, people are losing more and more common sense everyday!\n\nHaving lived in LA and Orange County for a some time, I can tell you this: an alligator fuckhouse like YakiniQ wouldn't survive more than 2 weeks there.  With the poor quality of food, service, facilities, this place would be packing pronto.  But y'know what?  This place thrives because it's in San Francisco, a bloated, self-aggrandizing, shitbox of a city that should be embarrassed of itself but is instead so unabashedly wrapped up in the glory of its own proverbial incontinence that a microcosmic shithouse of a restaurant like YakiniQ not only survives, but thrives!  And before you get your panties in a twist, remember this: I'm San Francisco-born and raised, and the this City has taken a HUGE nosedive in the last decade and has become a haven for smug asshole culture and is really much more provincial and dysfunctional than anyone would admit in their delusions of grandeur that exist for the mere fact that they live in the so-called \"Greatest Shitty in the World\".\n\nSpeaking of all matters fecal, this place gave me the runs too.

We had 7 in our group, and fortunately we only waited about 15 min on a Saturday night.\n\nAlthough the selection here is small and doesn't even come close to what you can find in L.A., they make up for it with the quality. $20 per person got us spicy pork belly, spicy chicken, garlic butter chicken, spicy octopus, tripe, galbi, lots of beef brisket, steamed egg, and rice cake. Everything was really well marinated and was some of the best tasting KBBQ I've had in a while. \n\nNote: Galbi is restricted to only one serving per person, so save the best for last. It's rich in flavor and will be a nice sweet end to your meal.\n\nThe most noteworthy is the spicy pork belly, which is very tender and barely spicy, but retains all the aromas of the sauce. Garlic butter chicken, although simple, is also delicious. If you can't handle spicy, AVOID the spicy octopus. It's on an entirely different level of spiciness.\n\nOur waiter was top notch, which is typically unheard of in a KBBQ restaurant. We had one vegetarian in our group, and he instantly hooked him up with a huge bowl of delicious looking veggie bibimbap. He kept the Chum Churum and Hite bottles coming, despite his initial disbelief that we could handle 3 bottles of soju as a group. Good sense of humor and let me practice my Korean with him. I think I only had to ring the call button once. \n\nVentilation could use some work, but I've seen worse. Definitely wear something you won't mind throwing in the laundry right away, because you will reek of meat. \n\nIt's your average AYCE KBBQ joint with good quality meat, K-Pop videos, exceptional service, and plenty of soju-fueled debauchery. I will be back for sure.", "author": "Dmitriy S."}

Wasn't able to try the marinated beef since I didn't want to bump everyone around me up by $5/head (group of 4)\n\nI mainly only got the brisket since I wasn't interested in the other meats, but the most disappointing thing was they don't know/have Brisket sauce at all. For the price... I was expecting they would but they just don't. The brisket is pretty tasteless imo, though you do have hot sauce and oil + salt dipping sauces. For me, brisket sauce is make it/break it deal for me... so I am pretty disappointed in the place. \nThey do check on the tables and change the grills pretty often before you even ask, which is good. The sides are ok/good enough, nothing wrong with them.\n\nGo here if you are willing to eat all the other kinds of meat YakiniQ offers and if you are around the area here I guess. \n\nPersonally, my recommendation is GEN in SJ if you have ability to go and deal with the wait.

(Off by 1.5 dollars & what we gave them was the rest of our cash). The waiter brought our change + tip back and went on a tangent about how everyone else in the restaurant usually gives over 20% tip and that our tip was disappointing to them. \n\nHe said usually when people tip the way we did it was because the waiters did something wrong, so I kindly explained to him that my boyfriend and I had simply given them all the cash we had for tip and that they didn't do anything wrong, yet he STILL kept telling us how we didn't meet the over 20% that everyone else was giving them. I used to work in a restaurant so I completely understand how important tipping is especially since waiters work so hard during their shifts to make sure their customers are given the best experience. \n\nBut they should know that tips are SUBJECTIVE to customers and coming back to tell us that we didn't meet their over 20% tip expectations was rude and disrespectful.", "author": "Jennifer B."}

Their banchans were okay and a good change of pace from eating all that meat.  Their two dipping sauces weren't that great.\n\nAs for the food the menu items to get are the:\nGalbi (although it's only one portion per person), beef brisket, spicy pork belly, fire squid, garlic butter chicken, spicy and steamed egg.  \nThe rest of the items are try it if you want to just try it and keep in mind spicy isnt spicy at all.  Sriracha has more heat than any of those items with the chili icons next ot them.\n\nI sort of get why it is twenty dollars ayce since theirs not much variety so I'm not taking away stars from that.  The reason I'm taking 3 away and giving them 2 stars is because after we started eating past 45 minutes they started to give us smaller and smaller portions.  The eating time limit was 2 hours but at a little under 1.5 hours the male servers told us that our next orders would be our last.  Sorry but with a group of 5 and decreasing the portions with each order call we were a bit angry.  We ended up asking for another order in which they reluctantly but warned us over and over that if there were any food left they would bill us for it.Our real last orders had portions that were even smaller than the ones before than and we all ended up still hungry and smelling of smoke.\n\nTl;dr-For 20 dollars, you cant expect much meat variety/quality.  Vents didn't really work that day.

If your gonna run a all you can eat place the last thing you wanna do is give off the impression that you are stingy with your food. Read on. Let me start with How dirty this outfit was. \n\nThe plastic pitchers stained were from years of smoke and oil. Vents were permanently coated in a disgusting layer of dust and dripping oil. The silver cups were oily even though it was \"clean\". I have been a professional Asian for 26 years and I have visited a lot of bbq places in my life. I understand things get dirty in these joints but the places I visited had at least tried.\n\nFood was alright. Less than alright. Tried a couple of beef cuts and ordered chicken. They literally give you enough chicken for five people while the beef plates were the size of a 10 year old's fist. What? They all tasted like terrible cuts of two month old beef.", "author": "Otto T."}

The food is delicious, the price is decent, and the staffs are incredibly nice. I couldn't imagine myself working for hours in this kind of noisy crowd and still be nice, seriously! So by saying that, I really appreciate your efforts.\n\nThough the noise here is my biggest concern and I feel the need to let you know. Usually before, when I came, I booked a table on the list and either wait for 30 mins or went elsewhere for a cup of coffee and be back. But last night, Saturday, my friend and I were too hungry and tired so we waited in the line for 2 hours then got to our table for around 1hr and a half. I noticed the loud noise but I didn't think it would affect on me much. When I came back home, my ears got buzzed. At first I thought maybe because I was sick (which I'm not), so I went to bed early. Yet when I woke up today and up until now, my ears hasn't stopped buzzed yet. I googled to know what happened and tried some traditional methods but nothing has worked so far. I'm worried.\n\nOn my effort trying to be funny, 3 hour clubbing or 5 hour rave are not a dime comparing to the 3 and a half hours here in YakiniQ. Hence my parents no longer have any reason to stop me from going to these fun exercises. \n\nBut please take my review serious. If you are customers, be aware what's up. If you are store owner, please fix this. Maybe because of the structure of the restaurant? Maybe because of the loud music so people have to speak louder than they should which make such a noisy mess? Maybe both? I don't know but I know it's not hard to determine once you care.\n\nAnd now, if you are nice enough, please take a momentum of five seconds or so and pray for me that I won't have to go the hospital. \n(Amen)", "author": "Tran N."}

The Kalbi is only one per table and the Bulgogi is in the higher priced meat bracket for some reason.

We had a reservation at 6:30 and when we got there they told us they cancelled our reservation because I didn't pick up their confirmation call about 20 minutes before the reservation time. I completely understand a call for confirmation but we didn't understand why a call would be made so late, especially when we were focused on driving safely to the location. We ended up waiting about one hour for a table. They seated 8 of us at a table with one grill, when I specifically called when making the reservation to make sure we would get two grills. It was the main reason we chose to eat here and we saw two other parties of 8 get two grills. Then later on in the night we were told the 2 hour limit still applied to us, even though we had one grill to feed 8 people...\n\nFood wise, the meat was so so. Some plates came out and the meats had ice on them.\n\nAll in all, it wasn't a good experience but I do have to give 2 stars for the way the manager understood our situation enough to get us seated within an hour even though there was a long wait time.", "author": "Toby M."}

The variety of meats is pretty great for $20, including short ribs, chicken (spicy too), pork belly (spicy too), spicy squid, tripe, beef briscuit, steamed egg, and a few more. There is a $25 dollar option, which includes a few more items like beef tongue and Beef Bugolgi, but not too many more. The marination of the meats was really great quality. All of the beef and short ribs were super fatty and delicious too.\n\nThe pickled appetizers were also great, including kimchee, chop-chuy (which I call vermicelli?), seaweed, potato salad, bean sprouts, and salad. These were a yummy way to start and end our meal, don't forget to eat all your veggies! Otherwise you'll be crying on the toilet the next day.  Throughout the meal we kept asking for more of these appetizers, and the staff was happy to give us more!\n\nWe must have done around 7 rounds of meat. We asked the waiter if he thought we ate a lot, and he said, \"You guys eat like birds\" HAHA. Not sure if he was playing around or what, but we all laughed at that one. The staff is attentive, probably because of the neat doorbell option they have on the corner of each table. Definitely a plus!\n\nOnly complaint:  kinda sucked having 9 people share a grill. But I guess SF venues are small, and you can't expect to have luxurious space like in Socal. \n\nCome right after going to the gym, with stinky clothes and and empty stomach.

The difference between $19.99 and $24.99 is just 4 plates of meat. So unless you REALLY want those 4 other items, stick with the $19.99. I would also hope they consider adding some more \"non-bbq\" items to the AYCE menu.\n\nNow to the meats, they have boneless kal-bi but, it's only 1 portion per person, unlike other places where AYCE really means AYCE. I had both the regular and spicy pork belly. Both were good, but the spicy was too saucy. Make sure it's the last thing you bbq or else you'd have to switch grills right away. All the sauce burns on the grill and makes things super smokey. \n\nWe also had the brisket and garlic butter chicken. Stick w/ brisket.\n\nThe non-bbq items we got were the rice soup and steamed egg. This is the blandest steamed egg I've ever had at a korean restaurant. Please add some salt for taste. \n\nThe service was good though. We felt taken care of and never went too long w/o meat on our grill. \n\nLast thing, my fiancee and I both felt sick after dinner last night.

No reservations for parties less than 8 so we had to wait about 30 mins for a table. We ended up waiting upstairs to watch the kpop music videos :D but if you left the place, they would call your phone to let you know there's a table for you which is nice! Also love listening to all my fave kpop songs while I eat :) \n\nAs for food, 10/10 recommend the Marinated Pork Ribs. It was juicy and tender and had a slight sweetness to it mmmm. The beef brisket and beef belly were pretty satisfying too but they came kinda frozen and clumped together (freshness??). I was disappointed that the Gal-bi was limited to one serving per person but I guess it was a good starter. The steamed egg and rice cake wrap was part of the All You Can Eat and we had it as like a palate cleanser halfway through the meal. We also tried the Fire Baby Octopus. Two baby octopus  came in a tiny bowl covered in bean sprouts and we were confused for a moment. But after grilling it, it tasted pretty good! Difficult to share though so only two of us got to try it. Definitely spicy as it had three  next to it on the menu. The Garlic Butter Chicken was A++++ but took some time to cook. We tried the Pork Skin but wtf..we did not know how to cook it so it just tasted fatty and bland. The pork belly was super difficult to chew, not sure if it was because we didn't cook it long enough. \n\nOverall, pretty decent I guess.

(YakiniQ == Yakiniku == Japanese word for grilled meat) I highly recommend making a reservation (minimum of 8, maybe 6) or going during non-peak hours as the wait can be as long as 90 or 120 minutes. If you walk in during dinnertime you will find a crowd of hungry patrons waiting for a table in the dimly lit staircase. The mere fact that people are willing to wait that long is clear indication of YakiniQ's popularity.\n\nIf you're not familiar with Korean BBQ the concept is simple enough--  you get a small grill at your table and they bring you raw or marinated meats. At some places an employee will come to your table and cook it for you, but you're responsible for your own meat here. Make sure to cook your pork and chicken thoroughly, but don't order the chicken. Chicken is an inferior meat. Side dishes are complimentary and delicious. Sometimes this includes a bowl of steamed eggs. Although this is an all-you-can-grill buffet, you can only order a few servings of meat at a time as to prevent waste. You'll also want to change the grill pan every few batches. Anytime you need assistance, just press the red button and a server will be there shortly.\n\nYakiniQ is a typical KBBQ. At night it's full of loud and drunken patrons, they blast K-pop over the speakers and play K-pop music videos on the displays, the air is thick and smokey, even with the ventilation units above each grill. While the food quality isn't the best, it is of fairly high quality.\n\nTL;DR - Unlimited KBBQ at a fair price. Try to avoid the long wait.", "author": "Daniel W."}

The selection of meat is great- our favorites being the pork fingers and bulgogi. *TIP* they only let you order 3 meats at a time, so know what you want beforehand because you might not see your waiter for awhile lol. Also, order a side of garlic and jalapenos for your meats. So good. AND order the rice wine (unshaken), and drinks this before you eat and in between and well, just drink this intermittently.

Unfortunately, that isn't saying much. But overall, this place is well-known for its all-you-can-eat meat. There's two choices you can pick from. One option covers the basic meats and the other is a slightly more extensive list for just a couple more bucks.\n\nThe wait to get a table is insane. Out of the various occasions I've dined here, the average wait time is normally 30 minutes to even 1.5 hours. 2 hours if you ARRIVE at dinner time, which is around 7PM. And eventually, the list cuts off and they cannot accept anymore people to sign up due to the long wait.\n\n Whether it's for a party of 2 or a large group, even if you make reservations, the group technically cannot be seated unless the party before leaves. Also, expect to have everyone in your party present. Otherwise, you will not be seated. With the enormous amount of people waiting, they'd be prioritized before you. \n\nThe meat quality is decent. It's not bad, but I've had authentic Korean barbecue in Korea enough to know that the meat served here is certainly not of the highest quality.  Personally, I think their marinated bulgogi is a little bit too salty and kind of drains the water from your mouth. \n\n\nNow, the service... The servers are quick on their feet. However, since this place gets so packed and it gets so cold outside, everyone stands inside. Thus, this results in immense traffic and slowing down of their work. They honestly do try very hard to fulfill the needy demands of the customers. And trust me. Working in a KBBQ restaurant is probably on of the MOST demanding and strenuous jobs I've seen thus far in the food industry. \n\nBut come on. What young, college student doesn't love KBBQ?

It's one of the better ones in my opinion, however the place is very popular and service is sometimes a bit slow. \n\nThe spicy pork and beef brisket were my personal favorites. I would skip the chicken here as I usually do at most KBBQ places. The squid was also very good, although a bit salty. There is a lot of banchan (small appetizers) to fill you up! And of course, they serve soju and yogurt soju. \n\nI've had mixed experiences with the service here. I don't think the servers are intentionally rude or bad, they're just so busy that they sometimes drop certain orders/requests which can be frustrating. But for the most part, I've had pleasant experiences here.\n\nNot my favorite AYCE KBBQ option, but one of a few in the Bay Area, so I'll likely be back.", "author": "Greg J."}

The second time I went there was no wait at all and they could seat me within seconds, but that was due to the fact that I came in on a weekday night. Despite the waiting times, the service was fast and the workers were friendly.\n\nIf it's your first time, one of the workers will come by and help you out with the grill and handling the meat. The man who runs the front desk helped me out the first time I was there with my friend and her family and he was really patient and super nice to us. Also, the workers keep an eye out for grills that need to be changed and come by to switch them out quite often (a lot more customer service than calling for a server and trying to get their attention).\n\nOH! I also received steamed egg on the house! Which I thought was really nice :)\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:I recommend getting the spicy pork belly :) It's soooooooooo delicious and my boyfriend got a couple orders of that. Keep in mind they charge for wasted meat, so only order what you can finish! I advise to order one or a couple plates of meat at a time so you don't end up with leftovers.", "author": "Monica P."}

Hope you like smelling of grilled meat. \n\nCame on a Tuesday evening and got seated right away. The place was fairly full but there was always an empty table somewhere so nobody had to wait. Guess the weekend is a different story. We went with the $23.99 menu mainly because that's the only way to get bulgogi beef and c'mon... what's Korean BBQ without some bulgogi? I'm glad we did because the extra menu included the pork neck and beef tongue which turned out to be unexpected hits. Other yummy items included the beef brisket, the short ribs, and the miso pork belly. We actually did a follow up order of the latter because we liked it so much. I would avoid the pork skin and big intestine next time. Don't get me wrong... I love both but I think they need low and slow cooking techniques of which a Korean BBQ is not one. Decent banchan including kimchi, glass noodles, and bean sprouts among others but the choices are limited. \n\nCoupled with two pitchers of beer, we were looking at around $40 a person for the three of us including tax and tip. That's a decent deal for 2-hours of all you can eat meat-grilling action washed down with big-ass bottles (pitchers) of Korean beer. On top of that, service was really cordial and attentive. They replenished our food quickly and brought us refills of banchan and sauces when requested. We were ready to admit defeat when they came by the last time and they were nice to remind us that this was the last order for our 2-hour limit anyway. We were stuffed. All in all, good times at YakiniQ BBQ. Don't know if I have the patience to wait in line for hours on the weekend but I'm totally down for a repeat of some weekday gluttony.", "author": "Jon L."}

There is no competition so they charge you around $30 after taxes.  Pretty ridiculous pricing.\n\nMy advice is this.  Go to a Korean grocery store get as much gogi as you want, get some cabbage, and whatever spices you desire.  Then go to the most ghetto Chinatown you can find and get some rice cake and you have home made DDUKBOHSAHM!  The dduk won't be tiny little pieces either.

This is a dangerous restaurant to dine at. It's a cook-it-yourself bbq and I understand they have to swap the bbq plates so you won't have so much food residue but they have to come up with a safer method of picking up the hot plates and transporting them back to the kitchen. What the wait staff will do is use this hooked handle and pick up the hot plates and walk  (around and over the seated customers) with the plates exposed through other customers who are waiting for their tables. \n\nThis waiter was carrying about 3 of those plates and the hot greasy oil dripped onto my daughter's thigh. Of course it burned her and the waiter just said \"Oh sorry\" and rushed off. It was as if some water dropped onto my daughter's thigh instead of BURNING HOT GREASY OIL. Now my daughter has a blister the size of a dime. Then after dinner, I see my Toms canvas shoes had about 3 oil drip stains on it. Ruined a new pair of shoes.\n\nIf the food was good, it may not have made the evening such a disaster but half of what we ordered wasn't marinated and was just bland and chewy.", "author": "Rosemary L."}

Telephone number is not correct on the info page. Their telephone number is 415-441-9292.\n\n\nFor the price of $19.99 for AYCE Korean BBQ, this place is ok. Yes, most of the meat items have a lot of fat but what do you expect when you want cheap Korean BBQ and it is all you can eat! I am a bit disappointed that the kalbi is one order per person. \n\nThe rule of thumb is to order all of your shares of kalbi before ordering everything else. Kalbi itself is expensive to get, so make sure you get all that you can from the one order per person!\n\nBeef Brisket: Fastest to cook and has fat on one side of the slices given to you. Not as filling, but can be used as between fillers for the fatty pork and kalbi!\n\nSpicy Fatty Pork: I liked this better than the plain fatty pork because I didn't have to dip any sauce into it. \n\nFatty pork: After eating so much plain fatty pork with the hot sauce and sesame oil, you get kinda tired. I am glad they have Miso fatty pork and spicy pork to also choose from. The meat was really good, but not comparable to other Korean bbq places I have been to. I feel the quality of the meat isn't as good here.\n\nGarlic Butter Chicken: Shocked that I didn't order this sooner! This was really good! Chicken wasn't dry and the flavors was fantastic. I think they need one for one of the beef or pork dishes. My friend asked us why we didn't get this dish, I said \"I don't know, maybe cause it isn't worth the money.\" He ordered it anyways and it didn't disappoint.\n\nLA Kalbi: ORDER ALL YOU CAN ORDER! This is my fave dish of all time. I make this at home too! But for some reason their kalbi is extra fatty than what I get, so be prepared with clogging arteries! Marinade on this dish was good\n\nTripe: We did not add anything to this tripe, but it was HELLA salty! like I couldn't believe how salty it was. Didn't order more cause it just wasn't good.\n\nSteamed Egg: We didn't order this, it was automatically given to us. Very refreshing after eating a lot of meat. It is pretty good, just simple steamed egg.\n\nRice Wraps: I love wrapping my meat with rice wraps. The wraps I got was not dried out, very moist and good.\n\nSalad: I think of 5 people, I ate most of the salad. It was good for helping me eat a lot of meat. \n\nOverall, the food was ok for the price. The dishes we ordered was good. The side dishes was ok. The service was also ok. Most of the time all of our service calls were answered quickly, but after asking for more servings of meat... the service got slower (or it just got busier that they couldn't be as attentive as earlier) **shrug**.

The waiters are basically providing  you with meat selection and ensuring that your side dishes and drinks were filled.  This was not the case.

Just for a fact - We did get our first round of drinks in a timely manner, after this round, we continuously had to flag our waiter down.  We were a party of 8 that felt like a party of 20 with only one waiter that was un-attentive. Horrible service with \"kid servers\" that did not understand the meaning of customer service.  The tip for this service amounted to $52.  Should never have paid this.  I get better service at a local cafe.   They had the audacity to rush us after so they can seat more people.  \n\nThe meat was okay.  There so called pork belly looked like a large bacon.   Not sure what the rave was about their galbi, beef brisket and pork bellies.  I've truly had better.  Buttered chicken was something to write home about.  And the beef finger that you paid 5 extra dollars for were tough.  Stick with the $19.99 menu.  Their bachan - side dishes noodles, Korean potato salad, kimchi, seaweed was good. I just wished they refilled without asking.  Their Sojo cocktail was just wine cooler.   $13.

All other food items are unlimited.\nService is mediocre. Takes a while for the waiters to bring out your meat and it was hard for me to flag them down during our meal. However.... it seems that my Korean speaking friends can call them over every single time...which resulted in them getting more food than I did so I was pretty jealous about that.\n\nThat being said... their gal-bi is DELICIOUS!

Same with drinks (which are a tad expensive here).\n\nAmbiance:\nThis place is actually pretty nice. It's clean and looks pretty classy, except for the barrage of k-pop playing on the big screen televisions lol. Overall, not a shabby place to take for a date or a classy outing.\n\nCustomer Service:\nAwesome! Everyone was really friendly and attentive. I'm pretty socially awkward and I hate that sinking feeling of trying to get a waiter or waitress's attention only to not be seen. Instead, even if one of servers is doing something else, he or she will always be looking around seeing if anyone needs anything. I never need to worry about being looked over here.\n\nFood:\nNot bad at all. If you haven't tried Korean BBQ before, do it! They bring it out in plates for you raw and you cook the meat yourself on the grill so you can perfect it to your own liking. It's all you can eat - which is awesome and they provide you with a few free sides as well. Try the Beef Brisket and Garlic Butter Chicken - my 2 favourites of the bunch. The Galbi shouldn't be looked over either.\n\n---\n\nThis definitely isn't the best Korean BBQ in San Francisco, but it certainly has value considering it's AYCE. When it comes to AYCE KBBQ in San Francisco, I'm going to have to say that YakiniQ serves it the best!", "author": "Clarissa Y."}

One for the quality of the foods and the other one for the manager (owner?) works there because the service is horrible especially the tall, skinny waiter.\n\nWe made the reservation at 730pm and were seated right away. We have been this restaurant many times and know the drill what to do, order order and order.\n\nWe had group of eight guys so basically we didnt care much about service and at the very least, I normally dont make complaint unless its reallllly bad which was the case few nights ago\n\n1) while we were trying to order more, he pointed at one of the dishes with few pieces of meats saying we had to finish them before making any other order. what!? its all u can eat and we had a group of 8 GUYS. I think we can \"kill\" that dish in 10 seconds easily again, its all you can eat and I fully understand if we had full table of meats not eating at all, we shouldnt really order anymore by all means. but there was only ONE  small dish on the table.\n\n2) the same waiter came to turn off the grill out of nowhere without any explanation WHILE we were still cooking. it was completely rude and shocked. com' on. all u can eat doesn't have to mean poor service, right? the entire dining experience was completely ruined because of that waiter. as he tried to turn off the one in front of us (we had two grills due to the size of our parties). I stopped him, \"hey, we are still cooking and eating!\". He finally explained to us, \" the grill is all burned and would catch fire if it remains on.\" HELLO, I don't live here. Would it be better to at least explain to us before doing it or changing the new grill!\n\nI had to complain to the manager and he apologized to us many times. again, one star is for the manager who is willing to accept comments and the other one is for the foods. service experience has gone done pretty bad.\n\nI may still go back but will be concerned the customer service.\n\ngood luck.", "author": "CHARLES H."}

I love the idea of cooking food at restaurants- I think it's because I love having my food a certain way and I have a control issues haha. Came here on a Thursday night with a couple friends and since I'm a big time foodie, I was pretty excited to try it. Haven't had Korean BBQ since I was in LA, so I was juiced. Plus the prices were great! 20 bucks for AYCE! \n\nWe ordered beef brisket, pork belly, spicy pork belly, garlic chicken, pork skin (don't order), and a steamed egg. Everything was good minus the pork skin but we ate that like we were contestants on Fear Factor and all ate a small piece at the same time. Anyway, the sides were good. Service was mehh- but we were at an Asian restaurant what else do you expect? But there was one server who was really helpful and helped us cook our food because we were still trying to get the hang of it. Plus we were getting splattered by oil- not sure if we were cooking it the right way. One thing they could change or maybe my friends and I were blind, but the short ribs (limited to one person per serving) was above a dotted line that we overlooked. And their $25 menu is under a dotted line as well/ So after we turned off our grill and were totally stuffed we saw it. But we all agreed to try it- and man that was bomb! \n\nOverall, I liked my experience here at YakiniQ. I'm already craving it again so I might head back this week.", "author": "Dara S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-02-02", "description": "This place got a lot of foot traffic for being the only AYCE Korean BBQ place action in town.  But man, this place is a pathetic riot.  It can definitely use a more organized and systematic wait system.\n\nMe and my son got here at 7:00 pm on a Saturday night after calling first to ask if it was busy.  The guy (owner) who answer said that only about 10 -15 minute wait.  So off we went and little did I know that it was a 10 - 15 minute Korean time wait.  He had 2 lists going on - one for 1 to 4 people and another for big groups.  So I placed my name and phone number on the small group list.\n\nWe scooted our way on to large top-padded tin can converted seats and just absorb the atmosphere.  Awesome aroma of grilling meats wafted everywhere and to the beat of non-stop Korean rave music.  I finally realized I am way past my prime to even considere that crap music.  It's pure psychedelic noise really.  So back to the wait.  By now, we are well into an hour of wait and were beginning to get cross eyed from hunger.  Me and my son took turns checking our spot on the list and were so close to leaving but decided otherwise since we are well into it already anyway.  Good thing I check my phone at 9:00 (2 hrs. into the wait) and saw a call from YakiniQ.  The call came in at 8;50 p.m. but who the hell will hear a phone ring with all the noise not to mention the psychedelic CHooG CHooG CHooG ChooChoo CHooG CHooG CHooG. Damn, I hate that schit!\n\nI dashed to the the counter and told the guy that someone called me from the the resto's number. Lo and behold he already scratched off my name thinking we left.  Mr. Owner apologized and said I'm next.  At exactly 9:15 p.m., 2 hrs. and 15 mins of wait, he gave us a table, one that I actually was hoping for - far end to the right next to the kitchen.  I told myself, \"Cool, far from the madding crowd, next to the food depot and definitely away from CHooG CHooG CHooG ChooChoo CHooG CHooG CHooG. Damn, I hate that schit!\" Servers were prompt and did not need to get waved over.  AYCE $21.99 pp rules are choice of 3 items at every round with only a one order limit pp for GAL BI, really ( -1 star).  So off  we went with round one.  FIve minutes into our grilling action, the nightmare began, The burner dies for the first time.  I waved one of the waiters over and it was relighted.  Then off she went. Thirty seconds later, it dies again.  This time chic waitress waves dude waiter over to fix the problem.  Dude waiter apologizes and relights the fire.  This constant on and off again went on the entire meal (Must have been about 20 times) until finally one waiter finally sat next to me and held the gas valve while we ate.\n\nOne good thing that made up for the crappy experience was the attentive staff. The food also hit the spot since we were very hungry.  As for the owner though, as a gesture of goodwill for the dysfunctional burner and the more than 2 hrs. of wait,  I would think that he would at least have given us some discount.  Nope. No siree! It was still full price.  Pay up sucka!!!\n\nThere you go.  This is the place for anyone really hard-up or dying for AYCE Korean BBQ. No repeat for me.  I'll just bottle all my craves for when I swing down to LA's Korea town.\n\nP.S. Be prepared to do laundry or get the Versace to the cleaners after your dining adventure at this place because you will be walking and smelling like a Korean BBQ chimney.  This is most definitely not the place to go if you have plans of cozying up with your significant other after dinner unless you dig Korean BBQ flavor on each other.", "author": "Marc F."}

I dont eat pork, so my recommendations are the brisket, the short ribs, and bulgogi (chicken always takes forever to cook). To get bulgogi, it's an extra $5 a person and you can't get it individually, so if your friends aren't down, ditch them~ Speaking of extra charges, rice is an extra 50 cents per bowl which they don't mention and mandatory gratuity is 18% for parties over 6, so watch out! You also need a minimum party of 2 to eat here.\n\nOut of the three I recommended, the brisket isn't marinated, but goes well dipped in either their complimentary paste which is sweet/spicy or the salt and sesame oil. They also give a lot of appetizers and they're refillable!\n\nThe reason for my review, though, was an unexpectedly great waiter we got the night of 9/23! Service here normally is minimal with people stopping by to ask if you want more meat, but this guy kept refilling our appetizers without us asking. He also helped us out with knowing whether stuff was cooked and actually attempted to have a conversation (he laughed when we had trouble with the beef intestines lol). He had glasses like this other guy working at the time, but he was shorter. I really wish I got his name! Only downside is the pricing of the place. Other than that, love it!", "author": "Nikki R."}

Unfortunately, that's where the BF and I were seated tonight and practically neglected the whole night we were there. LOL! The crowd that was seated in that section, which took up two tables were getting drunk, and well you know drunk people and crowds you can assume there were some loud chatters go on.  We rang the door bell to try to order meat three times, and was only visited once.  We just kept tapping any server that would visit the bigger party after being ignored for awhile, NO biggie.  I, of course asked for tripe anytime they could get to us and the BF ordered spicy pork belly, spicy chicken and galbi. I normally leave extremely full, with the exception of tonight, as I am actually kinda hungry, but I believe I'm full enough to get by through the night! \n\nI guess, I just didn't expect them to be that busy on a Wednesday...  The BF actually wanted sushi, but we found good street parking and as we were walking to head to the plaza, he asked me \"you want to eat at Yakini Q, don't you?\" Haha...

The more expensive option offers beef tongue, bulgogi, pork neck, and beef rib fingers that the $19.99 option does not. The meats they serve are all marinated pretty well, very flavorful without it being overly sweet like some other KBBQs. My favorite meat here was probably the Galbi, they have a limit on how many times you can order this meat before they start charging extra, so be sure to keep track! My friends and I ordered a side of radish wrap. It was good, added a different texture and taste to the meat. Unfortunately, refills are not unlimited on extra sides. \n\nThe service here is PHENOMENAL! They have a service bell available at each table. A server or even occasionally the manager would come over and assist us immediately.

Parking was a breeze since it was later in the day, but I'm sure it would be TERRIBLE earlier. (Bring quarters, y'all.) So when you walk in, you'll meet some stairs and once up, you'll be greeted by a smell of kbbq. YUM. The place isn't too large, but its a great size and there are a few tables that hold large parties.  I really liked the overall location & food was delish. \n\nSo why the 3 stars? Yes, the food is awesome. Yes, $20 for AYCE KBBQ in the city is such a steal. YES, location is great.... But service was so mediocre. When we got there, there was a host/waiter at the front who was ringing tickets up or something & he literally didn't greet us for 10 minutes. He finally told us put our names on the clipboard, no said wait time. As we were waiting to get seated, there were about 2 or 3 empty tables that would seat our party of 4, so we just patiently waited since we were thinking maybe there were no waiters set up for those tables?   BUT long behold, 5/10 mins later, we were sat at one of those tables anyways... Super dumb because while we were waiting the waiter & another worker were just chatting it up for some of the time. The rest of dinner was just ok.  It seemed like all the waiters were in rush (which I get...dinner hour), but they would leave when we weren't even done ordering. Even with the fancy schmancy call button, it still took them a while. It just left a bad impression & although by the end of the night we left with happy tummies, my friends and I couldn't help, but talk about their service. I'll just give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that we caught them on a bad night.\nCheck it out for yourselves though--maybe you'll get a better experience.", "author": "Julie Ann B."}

We arrived around 6 and ended up having to wait for about 30 minutes for a table for 5. Not a big deal, since we expected it and were able to pass the time across the street in the mall. It was nice that they gave us a phone call when our table was ready.\n\nThe menu includes your choice of grilling meats, including some additional meats including Bulgogi for extra. The meal includes Korean side dishes as well as some dipping sauces. We ordered the bulgogi, Miso pork belly, beef brisket, and spicy squid. I thought that the bulgogi was definitely the most flavorful (I guess that's why they include it on the premium menu). The service was pretty attentive (push the button on the wall to order more food or change out your grill).

It seemed we had arrived at a good time cause the restaurant quickly filled up after we were seated.\n\nMenus were posted on the wall and we quickly ordered a few plates.  $20 for three plates at a time and $24 for some extra meats. We quickly realized to just lay off the chicken and go with the beef and pork options. The quality of meat was pretty low and at times the amounts given to us were kind of random. We had ordered some tripe and they returned with a plate with only one piece of tripe. \n\nAfter our first three plates it seemed the restaurant was slammed. I had to ask multiple times to get a new pair of chopsticks and sometimes remind waiters about our orders. I'm not going to fault the waiters here for delivering poor service because honestly with a full restaurant it's hard to manage. The waiters definitely helped as much as they could and answered questions we had about the menu. They were especially attentive if we needed a new grill and that wasn't too much of a problem. \n\nI do wish they had told us before we sat down that there was actually a time limit and last orders. Towards the end the waiters almost seemed like they were rushing us. For our last three plates of meat the waiter just dumped everything on the grill without asking, which I thought was a bit rude.\n\nOverall service is kind of subpar during rush time, although it's not for a lack of trying. The meat and quality of food is also kind of low. I had expected a little bit more, considering for similar prices I was used to better in Seattle.

The first time was after a service event for Circle K (a community service organization) back in February, and I was with friends looking for a good, fairly-priced place to eat KBBQ. Given that it was Valentine's Day weekend that we went, the place was packed and there was a line outside the door. By the time we walked up the stairs and got seated, I was starving.\n\nTheir menu is a screen on the side of your table and tells you that $20 is for this selection of meats and $25 is for the same selection of meats as the other one, but with a few more. And then there are additional side dishes (lettuce, for example) that cost a dollar or two. My table decided to get the $20 one and I would say it was worth the price. Majority of what we ordered were the beef brisket and the short ribs. Now, the short ribs have a catch. They limit one serving per person to the table. Say your table has six people; that means your table can only get six servings of the short ribs. That made me sad because that was my favorite dish. But nonetheless, we ordered many servings of the beef brisket and steamed eggs to carry on. I also really love the cole slaw that they have. I had a good first experience here, which is what prompted me to come back with some of the same friends that accompanied me the first time.\n\nThe second visit was basically the same as the first one, except there was no line (YAY!) and one of the staff members was very cordial to us. We sat down immediately and soon enough, we had plates of pork belly, short ribs, and beef brisket. One of the staff members advised us on how to speed up the cooking process of the brisket. I don't know why, but I thought that was really nice and I took a mental note of it because he was so helpful and kind. Eventually, it was just me and Mickey as the last ones stuffing our faces. Frankly, I still felt like I had room for more even when I finished, but I had to make sure I could walk afterward.\n\nYakiniQ is my KBBQ place in SF, so if you're ever in the area, this is a great restaurant to visit.", "author": "Bunny M."}

Yes, your clothes will still smell like Korean BBQ afterward, but that's all part of the experience, right?! Just come prepared by wearing casual clothes you don't mind throwing in the laundry, and it's all taken care of. Be warned, this place does get pretty smokey on a crowded night. \n\nThe last time I came here was with a big party -- table of 12! We all wanted to sit together, and guess what -- they actually accommodated us and squeezed us all into one table! They gave us a choice as to whether to split up or stay together, and we chose the latter. I really thought they wouldn't allow us to pull up so many chairs at one table for fear of blocking the aisles, but surprisingly, they were cool with it. Because there were so many people at one table, we were always waiting for food since there was only a single grill. But no worries, we ordered plenty of Sapporo beer and side dishes! Also, keep in mind the birthday person gets to eat freeee (just show ID)!!\n\nYakiniQ has a pretty good all-you-can-eat menu, but of course getting the marinated beef (bul-go-gi) is pricier ($4 more to be exact). We just got the basic AYCE, which satisfied us. One of the my favorite dishes on the menu (and perhaps why I'm giving this place such a good review) is the steamed egg! No other Korean BBQ place I know of serves an unlimited amount of piping hot steamed egg. MMMmm. I think I ordered at least 10 of them and ate 5 all on my own. Also to note - there's a limit of one order of galbi (beef ribs) per person, but that was enough for us anyway. \n\nThe other reason why I really like this place is that there's a button you can push to call the waiter/waitresses over at all times. Any waitstaff that is free will then come over to help you, which pretty much ensures immediate service. In a crowded place with constant, unpredictable orders, it can get pretty chaotic. Usually at a Korean BBQ place, you can never get anyone's attention because they're always rushing around anywhere. This convenient button they have saves you from having to stand up, yell, wave your hands, or all of the above to catch a waitstaff's attention. Brilliant idea.\n\nOverall, we had a great time and filled our stomachs to the brim. I need to come back for the steamed egg!", "author": "Audrey L."}

Here you can get your protein binge on for 20 bucks especially for all the body builders out there... this should be heaven.  You can also pay 25 for extra types of meats like beef tongue and bulgogi (marinated beef).  I'll pass on that though.  Their beef tongue is never sliced properly so it's always crazy tough to chew.  Bulgogi... quite frankly should be on the 20 dollar list of choices but of course bulgogi is the easiest way to get you paying 5 extra bucks.  \n\nThis spot is perfect if you have a few or a group of friends ready for a night of food and drinks.  BBQ and soju go hand in hand when it comes a Korean's way of life so don't hold back.  It's gonna be a fun night every time!\n\nTheir service is pretty good here.  The 3 stars is for the lack of quality in the meats and the way they are cut.  Many times the meats come out way too frozen causing the meats to be dry and tough after being grilled.  The beef tongue always leaves me baffled.  I enjoy good tender thinly sliced beef tongue that comes out fully defrosted like that of Yakiniku just a block down at the Japantown mall.  The beef tongue here are thickly cut and usually frozen... if you want to workout that jaw line then you want order a few of these for the night.  I promise it'll do better than chewing gum.\n\nPersonally I'd rather pay a little more at a couple of other locations for a more authentic and quality experience.  Hard to find a great spot around here for Korean bbq.  For the real deal you'll have to head over to Santa Clara, Oakland, or LA.  For a great time with some friends though you can't go wrong here!  It's worth the 20 bucks... possibly 45 with drinks tax and tips.", "author": "Colin M."}

We wanted the bugolgi so we all got the $24 option. \n\nWe had the short ribs, garlic chicken, steamed eggs and bulgolgi of course, and a few of us tried the spicy octopus and pig intestines. \n\nThe only reason we tried the pig intestines was cause the tables near us had a huge fire going on and we wanted the same entertainment on our grill. We asked the friendly server to bring out whatever it was that made the fires and he gladly brought out some pig intestines! Even though we made it clear it was for entertainment purposes only!

I decided to give them a chance anyhoo and went in with an open mind. That chance given to them was given in vain because they made me regret it within the first 10 minutes.\n\nThe male servers were pretty nice, even though there were many things they refused to do for us, I understand that they are just obeying policy, even though they're stupid policies... When we ordered meat, they will only bring out three things at a time and would not bring us more until we were done with what we had. I get it.... they don't want us to waste food. But come on... i like to eat with a little more variety than that! But whatever.. \"policy\" right? They also limit you to one order of kalbi per person and later on in your meal, they start bringing you less and less of the meat. What kind of \"all you can eat\" is that!?\n\nAfter an hour, a very rude waitress comes by and tells us to put in our \"last call\" order because we're nearing our two hour limit. I tell her that we've only been here for an hour but she gave us some BS about how putting in our last call now gives us time to cook and eat it before the two hour mark. WTF!? i mean.. we were a table of 5 and it takes a while to cook some of the meats, ie chicken... esp with ONE TONG! (I also read that even if you request it, they won't give you an extra tong to cook the meat so I didn't even bother trying, we just grabbed an extra pair of chopsticks and utilized that instead.)\n\nThere was no use in arguing so we just put in our last order for pork belly, spicy squid and some garlic butter chicken. When the order came to our table, I didn't know whether to laugh or be angry! The sight that sat before was a flipppppin joke! two measly pieces of pork belly, one squid in a bowl and small scraps of chicken were presented to a table of 5.. seriously guys, what were you thinking? were we suppose to proportion out the goods in an orderly fashion as if to feed peasants!? this was suppose to be an ALL YOU CAN EAT! \n\nAfter getting over our disbelief, we wave over one of the male waiters and to tell them about the obvious problem. He quickly brings out a reasonable amount of what we ordered and then comes back later on to ask us if we put in our \"last call\" yet. When he asked, it was at least a reasonable time.. unlike our first time. We tell him about what happened with his female associate and he doesn't even apologize for it. All he was able to muster was some BS about policy and the 2 hour limit, which no one explained in the beginning anyhoo. \n\nGuys and Gals....save your time and your money. The food was pretty good but I mean.. its meat that you yourselves have to cook, so it's not like it can be that bad. If it were undercooked or overcooked you only have yourselves to blame! But the \"policies\" that this establishment stands by and the lack of customer service here will never have me coming back.

It's not often you can find a place that gives so much in return for the price, however as of my past couple of visits this place seems to be on the decline.\n\nMy breakdown:\nPrice & Quality- The regular meat buffet is $19.99 per person and for the amount of meat they give, it's well worth it. The meat is always super delicious and a treat to be honest. Plus they give you a bunch of delicious side things like Kimchi and delicious sauces.\nService- The service is better than you would expect at such a busy buffet place. Pretty attentive, can't complain.\nVibe- This place is always full which adds to the vibe here as they always have korean music videos playing on the monitors and what not. The vibe is above average here.\n\nWill I come back? Probably not in a while. They used to have private booths however they remodeled and while they did add nice screens showing the menu, the privacy you could have with you and your friends is gone. Furthermore, they have started doing this thing called last call which in essence kind of makes this buffet a timed buffet as they need to sit more people at your expense. In other words, you get to eat all you want for about an hour and a half and then you kind of have to go. The remodeling and last call thing have me trying new places now. Regardless. YakiniQ is still a good place to get your Korean BBQ fix.", "author": "Moises L."}

I'm kind of proud of ourselves for sticking out for that long. We got there at around 7:15 and were seated at 9:45. When we initially put our names down, he said about 1 hour. So we put down our phone number and went walking around Japantown. After an hour, we made our way back thinking that we'd get seated soon. But in that hour, barely any other parties had been seated.\n\nThey've got it pretty well figured out, though. They don't want to tell you how long the wait is because they don't want to scare you away. And they don't like you asking how long it would take for a seat, which is really annoying. They definitely gave everyone attitudes when they kept asking how much longer the wait would be. It also doesn't matter to them if you just leave if you get fed up with waiting too long because they still have an endless line of other people that's willing to wait. They don't feel obligated to be nice to anyone in line, so that service was really off-putting.\n\nBut after we were finally seated, the service was very nice. All the waiters were very friendly and relatively prompt. The food was amazing. I mean, it'd have to be after we waited so long for it. I wouldn't say that it's especially cheap. I come from the land of $10 Korean barbecue ($15 for select meats), so $20 is a little pricey. But considering it's one of the only Korean barbecue places in San Francisco, I'm willing to forgive that. \n\nBrisket is my favorite, so we ordered that three times.

If it's your birthday, you'll be happy like I was when my family came here for my birthday. The beef short rib that is limited to an order per person is the best thing on the menu, which, to me, was followed by the spicy pork belly and the spicy chicken. Everything else is negligible and can be overlooked. One of the beef platters, the beef brisket, was very cold, wet, and seemed like it just finished thawing. If you order intestines, you will only get one chunk at a time. If you order the regular pork belly, it came to us as two one inch thick slabs of frozen belly. Something about frozen meat at a bbq place doesn't sit well with me. The banchan that you have on your table consists of bean sprouts, kimchi, seaweed, japchae, and mashed potatoes. You will have to ask the waiters to have them refilled every and all the time. This goes for the cabbage salad as well. We would ring the bell and eventually have to ask our waiter again because he had not brought us our refills. My advice to people who haven't been and want to try is try all and everything you want, but ask the waiter if you don't know what it is that they placed on your table. After getting the check, we saw that they charged my family for the $24.99 menu when we stuck to the $19.99 menu. The outlier was the prime beef tongue. We didn't order it, but apparently we ate it. I wish the waiter would have told us what they were serving us at each time they placed the meats on the table. For an \"all you can eat\" buffet outside of LA, it is alright. Though once you have gone to an LA Ktown all you can eat, YakiniQ doesn't even compare.

If you guys know of others in/near, let me know and send me a message! :D \n\nI lalaloooooove korean bbq! If there's one thing my bf probably doesn't like about me, it's always wanting to go eat it. He smells like korean bbq after work all the time, so he's not really a fan of always going to eat it....but this was an exception -- meeting my mom for the first time for dinner (or second?) and pre-birthdayyy! \n\nFor $19.99, you can get AYCE, but for $24.99, you can get the premium version that includes prime beef tongue, pork neck meat, marinated beef (bul-go-gi), and beef rib finger! Honestly I prefer AYCE for K-BBQ cause it's cheaper than ordering dish by dish at non-AYCE places. For two people, the bill can be around $50 for YakiniQ, and $80+ at non-AYCE restaurants. \n\nFor an AYCE place, this place is good (since it's the only in SF...I think). This place is located in Japantown, right across the mall plaza. Parking is kinda hard in the area as it's metered but there's residential not too far (on Laguna). The quality of food would be an 8/10 for me. I love to order the galbi, beef brisket, bul-go-gi, and spicy pork belly. For the galbi, they limit to one order per person, but I like to bring 2+ people with me, so it's all goood. \n\nI haven't came to YakiniQ probably for a few months now, and coming in the day before my birthday, I have noticed quite some changes.....changes that I don't like. \nChanges: \n- There are no more blinds in between booths (it made it feel more intimate, so idk why they removed it).\n- Seats (no more chairs with a back for you to lie on, it's now a stool)\n- Grills (went from rectangular to circular. I find the circular version harder to grill stuff). \n- Lighting (it's more lighted and \"spacious\" now I guess)\n- Menu (It's now LED...it can be quite blinding) \n\nAs for some of the stuff that remained that remained the same, there's the old, sticky carpet that's disgusting, the bell for each table is on the wall or on the side of the tables, and the long waits if you come here around 9 pm. \n\nThe night I came, the service was good. The servers would change our grills quite frequently, they were quick and attentive when we pressed the ding dong bell, and the wait wasn't long for my party of 6 (30-45 mins around 8 pm). If you're waiting, get ready to get pushed or cramped up because the waiting area is basically at where the stairs are. \n\nAs for food, like I said, I normally order the galbi (limited to one order per person), beef brisket, bul-go-gi, and spicy pork belly. I think the galbi and bul-go-gi are marinated quite well, so ya'll should try it! If you grill it, I highly suggest cutting the galbi when it's half cooked or something. More pieces for more people! The night I came, my bf made me try the prime beef tongue and it didn't taste that bad..if you cook it right, I think it should taste kinda chewy/crunchy lol. Just don't think of it as beef tongue if you get disgusted by the thought (cause I did)!! Side note, they also sell drinks (including soju!) and side dishes. \n\nI never planned on writing a review for YakiniQ, but I thought I should to make notes on the changes. \n\nOverall, YakiniQ is a good place to eat for AYCE in the area, with long wait (depending what time you arrive). I will come back again, and again maybe! \n\nP.S. They also charge 18% gratuity on parties of 6 or more.

It's super busy towards Friday/Saturday so I do suggest coming earlier if possible. If not they have a wait list you can write ur name on. Honestly me and family/friends like this spot so much we'll wait the hour/hour and a half if it's busy . Food is good, from the beef brisket to the spicy pork. I also like their steamed egg, it compliments all the meat and rice. Everything you get on their menu is all pretty good. 20$ all you can, and I believe there's a few more items added on if you get the 25$ all you can eat. It's all worth it. They also have beer and soju as well! All around great k bbq !", "author": "Victor S."}

They bring you plates and plates and more plates of meat, and you grill it yourself in front of you.  \n\nIt's a great deal, and you get a huge selection of meats, ranging from the normal stuff like pork belly and kalbi to stranger stuff like pig skin and intestines.  The marinated stuff is the best - sweet, tender, smoky.  There's also octopus, chicken, and banchan - including kimchi, steamed egg, salad, seaweed, japchae, etc. - for you to order and re-order to your heart's content.  Banchan selection is a bit limited, but at the same time, it's alright since it's unlimited.  All-you-can-eat is seriously the best!\n\nBeer and soju are about $10 for a bottle.  You can also opt to add on side dishes for a few more dollars.  We decided to just stick to the $19.99 AYCE deal, and that was definitely more than enough because it's endless food.  \n\nService is great too!  The waiters and waitresses were helpful, and they came by very often to change out our grill with clean ones.  The food came at a great pace.  We were there for almost three hours, and it was very chill and relaxing just eating and drinking at a leisurely pace.  That's one of the best things about these AYCE KBBQ joints - you control the pace!\n\nIt was a Saturday night too, and the environment was incredibly lively and hoppin'.  At times it's hard to hear the person sitting across from you, but I didn't think that was really an issue because I think the awesome liveliness is one of the things that makes this experience great. \n\nYou can sit there for hours, cooking and eating your delicious grilled meats and banchan, drinking your soju and beer, and laughing as the smoke billows around you.  Cooking and eating together.  It's tasty, it's social, it's everything that I love about food and community.\n\nOh, but just remember to wear your old clothes.

After my dinner tonight, I don't think I'll be coming back. The prices raised from $19.99 to $21.99 and I know that that's only a $2 difference, but I don't think it's worth it, given the quality of the meat and the service. The servers were nice, but not that attentive. We had to ask them for water, to change our grill, and to pick up our plates. Usually, servers are supposed to do those things automatically. Also, there is no more of that sesame oil/salt dipping sauce. That sauce was what made the meat nice and salty. Tonight, I was eating bland meat. The thing that solidified my decision to never come back to YakiniQ was the way the host treated my friend. We had made reservations for 6 PM and were waiting on the rest of our party. It was five minutes past 6 and we had told the host that the rest of our party was trying to find parking. The host said something to us and due to the music and the sound of other people talking, we couldn't hear him, so my friend kindly asked him to repeat himself.

So I have pretty high expectations for good AYCE KBBQ.  That being said, I was not impressed with YakiniQ.      \n\nLocation - In Japantown.    \n\nRestaurant - The huge wooden door is deceiving.  Instead of walking into the restaurant, you are greeted with 2 sets of stairs.  Going up the stairs was disgusting as each step would squish into the dingy, sticky gross carpet.   Ewwww!  And trust me, upstairs wasn't any better.  As you get to the restaurant level, the d\u00e9cor is dark wood and has a casual vibe.  They have K-Pop music videos playing on TV and lots of booths and large party tables in the middle.      \n\nFood - We had 5 side dishes - soba noodles, bean sprouts, potato salad, kim chee and seaweed.  I appreciate that the steamed egg in a clay pot was included.  They had the standard fare for meat - spicy pork and chicken, miso pork, brisket, etc.. FYI - bulgogi is NOT on the standard menu.  Rice paper was AYCE, but you have to pay for a bowl of rice per person.  Wack!  I tried the Pork Belly but couldn't get past the texture.  The highlights were the brisket and spicy pork.     \n\nSad face - well more like angry face.  You have to pay EXTRA for Bulgogi.  Seriously?  Bulgogi is usually standard in most Korean BBQ restaurants.  Wait, there's more..you are also limited to ONE galbi - shortrib per person.  (yes, you read that correctly)  I'm sorry, but when you say All you can eat...it should be All you can eat.  \n\nCost - $19 per person for the regular AYCE menu.  $23 for the prime AYCE menu which includes bulgogi (I know right?) and other random meats.  They add 18% gratuity for parties of 6 or more.   \n\nService - The servers were friendly, quick with our food/drink refills and checked on us for the most part.  When we flagged them down, they were always patient with our orders.  Initially, they brought 2 big water pitchers to our table of 7 - nice, although I hate it when there isn't any ice in the water.  They were always good about grill changes.\n\nMisc - Parking is tough, but there is a parking garage across the street - it's not free of course.  The restrooms are downstairs towards the back of the restaurant.  There is a caf\u00e9 across from the bathroom area.\n\nKid friendly - The restrooms do not have changing tables and high chairs are available.  Watch the kiddos around the stairs area.        \n\nWould I come back?  No.  They need to add bulgogi to the regular AYCE menu as the premium charge should be for the other random meats.  This place also needs to install new carpet.", "author": "Connie C."}

The quality of the meat was very good. I loved the beef brisket and the pork belly. Service was excellent too. We were attended to quickly and frequently.

If you don't know Southern California has the best Korean BBQ for the best price! So for a long time my friend and I have been disappointed time after time at all these spots around the Bay Area. Either the food was bad, or they were missing a dish we loved, or the place was extremely over priced.\n\nSo we've been hearing about this place and decided to try it out hoping we would finally come across our very first go to spot for Korean BBQ in the bay. \n\nAs soon as I walked in and up the stairs I was already in a vibe I loved. Crowded restaurant, but not too crowded of course, everyone smiling having a good time drinking and eating! \n\nSo since we made a reservation, which was an awesome idea due to the long line of mad hungry people, we got seated really quick. Right when we are seated, we are already staring at the wide variety of korean side dishes. Our server was extremely nice and patient with us. We ordered brisket, short ribs, spicy chicken, steamed egg, and rice paper. About the rice paper; it's a necessity that my friend and I NEED with our Korean BBQ and this is the only place in the Bay Area that includes it in their AYCE menu! Other places either don't know what the hell we're talking about when we ask for some or charge you up the ass for it! So we were so happy we had unlimited rice paper! \n\nThe food was amazing, service was friendly and fast, loved the whole vibe, and they have RICE PAPER! The only reason SoCal Korean BBQ is still my favorite is the price. If you are unaware, LA has 10$ AYCE Korean BBQ spots! But sadly we don't live in LA so the 20$ menu up here will have to suffice...

We've travelled all the way down to Sunnyvale looking for something similar to the LA style AYCE Korean BBQ experience, and have always left disappointed and about $60 poorer for it. This place has 2 tiers of AYCE meats, with the maximum price arriving at $23. We stuck to the $20 option and we were still very satisfied. \n\nThe cons:\n1.) The place is a little loud, between the music and the drunk people. \n2.) Wait staff seems a little overwhelmed--but they mostly make up for this for being friendly and mostly attentive. \n3.) You can only get 1 serving of Kalbi per person--but, this actually isn't THAT bad, considering 1 serving is actually 2 ribs. So, between the 2 of us, we got 4 slices which was plenty after all the other meats you're downing. \n4.) My steamed egg had a slight taste of dishwashing fluid which was a buzzkill. \n5.) The carpet at the entrance was ... sticky. O_O\n6.) Yes, they do charge for rice--but they give you PLENTY. I'm really into eating a lot of rice, and I didn't even finish my bowl. \n\nThese 6 things together took the overall experience from being a 5-star one, but I will DEFINITELY come back multiple times over. The meat is high-quality, tasty, and plentiful. Also, the pork belly was thick and delicious, and they have the rice paper wraps which was always profoundly missing from any other Korean BBQ place I've been to in the South and East Bay.

They are either a hit or miss. Dont waste $13 on something nasty.\nI recommend the KIWI flavor. \n\nPros:\n- I LOVE the mini dishes they serve as appetizers and the fact that they are refillable.\n- They have a large lit up menu and a button to call for service at every table besides the tables in the center. \n- Their Bulgogi (marinated beef) and Galbi (marinatef short rib) is to die for! Yes, id eat this if I had to pick my very last meal on earth. \n- Rice is necessary when indulging in the juicy meat. $1 for 2 bowls! \n - Love the salt and oil mix with their chili sauce. \n- Very friendly and attentive manager who helps work the floor when his staff is behind.\n- They are opened until midnight on weekdays and 1am on weekends\n\nSo why not 5 stars?\n\nCons:\n- The servers are usually really busy speed walking back and forth and they always seem a little impatient. Ive been here maybe 8 times and every time I order I feel like there's a ticking time bomb, as if the waiters are trying to push the words out of my mouth faster so they can get to their next task. \n- Whenever we cut our meat with the scissors, this one server would always come up grab the scissors out of our hands and cut it for us. So I'm getting mixed feelings. I guess it was suppose to be nice and helpful but I felt a little intruded. He could've offered by asking \"May I help you cut your meat?\", which at least gives us a second to react instead of coming up behind us and grabbing it out of our hands. \n- When there's a wait they tend to clean up our table too fast as we still havent finished some of our food.", "author": "vivian s."}

But I am sad to say that this was the only redeeming thing of my night. \n\nWe arrived at the restaurant an hour before they closed, but the host was trying to convince us not the eat there because, according to him, the kitchen closed in 10 minutes. We found out later that we had a half hour before they closed from our server. The entire time we were being rushed by the server, the cooks and the host. One server turned up the heat on our food to move us along but it ended up burning our food.They started vacuuming while we were still eating. And the thing that made me the most upset is when the host brought us our check and tried to tell us when we should show up to the restaurant. I had to inform him that I didn't get off work until 10:30, but I really shouldn't have to explain my reasons for when I like to eat. \n\nI felt so disrespected and rushed and almost uncomfortable being there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-14", "description": "All you can eat sides and meat ($17.99 and $19.99 option). Good variety of meat (LA Galbi, Bulgolgi, Pork Belly, Spicy Pork Belly, etc). They limit the LA Galbi to the number of people. Ie. if you go with 3 people you can only order the Galbi 3 times throughout the entire meal. I just didn't like that they would give us a LARGE T-bone Galbi. I prefer the spicy pork belly over the regular pork belly because of the marinade and for some reason tastes more like marinated pork meat instead of the fatty belly. Some of the sides include steamed egg, potato salad, bean sprouts, and of course kimchi. Some grills may not cook evenly; as our grill burned quicker on one side. \n\nThe service here is decent. They actually respond to the bells. Some waiters are better than others, especially the female ones. While I was waiting to be seated, one waiter, being polite, said \"thank you for visiting\" to a customer near the cash register. Turns out that customer was waiting to be seated. The owner, I presume, was so embarrassed and just smiled. The waiter, of course, felt even more embarrassed, and scurried away. I couldn't look at the waiter the same way throughout the dinner. \n\nRandom: They also take reservations which may be a good idea especially on busy Friday and Saturday nights. The Korean music playing does not match up to the Korean MV's playing on the TV screen.\n\nOverall, YakiniQ is in a convenient location (located in Japantown). One of the downsides is that there is no free ice cream after your meal. So if you still have room for dessert Sophie's Crepes is across the street! This may be the only AYCE KBBQ in SF that is mildly comparable to K-town in LA, of which there are TONS of KBBQ places for $10-$15 of better or equivalent quality.", "author": "Kathy W."}

The only reason that I'm giving this place a 2 star because the price was cheap for an all you can eat BBQ in SF. \n\nFood:\nDefinitely not the best in the world. I've had way better BBQ other places. Some of the meat were tasteless.The spicy chicken is waaaaaaay too thick, takes forever to be well cooked. Like seriously, it was like one of those chicken breast bundle you'll get in Costco. Pork was okay. \n\nEnvironment:\n\nLoud, very loud. People were yelling the entire time and so does the owner and the waitress/waiter. They were yelling across the hall. Also, the cooking fumes was tooooo strong... hate to say, but I have long hair, and that means it takes me hours to wash the smell off of my hair. Yea they definitely need better air circulation. \n\nService:\n\nOkay, this is the part that gets rediculous. You can only order 3 dishes at a time per table. I mean it's understandable when you only have 2-3 people, or even 4 people. But we had 6 , and it was still limited to 3 dishes at a time? Uh.... yea, so you guessed it. Half of the time we are waving our hands asking the server to bring more food. We almost devour everything once it's on our table. Because the dishes honestly were not that big. (You get 4 pieces of chicken breast per dish) I think we called the server at least 6 or 7 times, and it became very annoying since sometimes they'd just walk by without helping us. And also, a waitress was pretty rude . The All You Can Eat is only for 2 hours, and it was written on the menu etc.  But as we were asking for more food, a waitress told us \"Just so you know , the All you Can eat is only for 2 hours.\" We were like \"Uh.. okay? We've only been here for less than an hour and a half\" She made it sounds like she didn't want us to stay there any more ( or maybe just wanted us to stop eating). And we decided that's all for today since we didn't want to \"over stay\".

Every time I leave I always says \"Ugh I'm never coming back here.\" The food is okay...the service is terrible...but someone always wants to come here. I was there again this past weekend, and again left with a bad taste in my mouth, literally and figuratively.\n\nI called Friday night to make a reservation for 8. I know that is the minimum required and we just happened to have that many. The guy on the phone goes through the usual \"if you have less than 8 we will cancel your reservation\" blablabla. So we show up at 6:30pm, which was our reservation time. We had 6 of our 8 there. We checked in and the manager guy said \"We need you all here. We will hold your reservation for 10 minutes.\" Wow thanks man great customer service right there.\n\nAfter some back and forth with him they let us sit down. This place always go out of their way to make you feel like THEY are doing you a favor by letting you eat at their restaurant. So some K-Pop Star looking douche waiter comes up to us and first thing he says is \"Where is the rest of your party?\" We explain to him they are running late. We even called them and they said they were on their way. So Mr. K-Pop Star explains how we are going to be charged for 8 people regardless of if they show up or not. We said fine we are here and just want to eat.\n\nSo we eventually figure out okay, our other friends are not coming. It's okay, it happens. We ate and talked and tried to enjoy our night. Multiple times during our visit, Mr. K-Pop would come over with an extremely smug look on his face and say \"So...where are your friends?\" like he actually gave a crap. If I had a sarcasm meter, if you have blown up multiple times that night. At first we insisted they were still coming, because we thought they were. Then when we realized they weren't, we told him they weren't. Either way, he would always smirk at our response and then walk away. We already agreed to pay for 8. We don't need a constant reminder that 2 of our friends flaked. Does this guy not have friends? Do Koreans always show up punctual 100% of the time?\n\nThen when the check comes, we pay $100 in cash then the rest in card. My friend's card is swiped and she gets a receipt showing that they charged her the full amount. So wait, where's our $100? Oh, Mr. K-Pop accidentally put that $100 towards another table, full of guys visiting from Korea that seemed to be pretty buddy-buddy with the staff. Pure coincidence I'm sure. So enough about the crappy service, what about the food?\n\nThe food quality seems worse every time I come. Brisket was obviously frozen and just thrown on the plate in a big clump. I remember years ago the short ribs used to be unlimited, now you get 1 order and have to pay extra for more. Spicy chicken was bland, not spicy at all. For $20 it's okay. I wouldn't mind if the service wasn't terrible.\n\nI understand this place is always really packed and busy. The staff has an attitude where they don't care if you are happy, because there are others willing to take your place and pay. I'm sure if they read my review, they would think oh well screw this guy, we have tons of other people to wait in line and eat here. Good for them.

Rarely paid any attention to our party of 6 when it came to refilling the pitcher of water, changing the grill, or bringing our orders of meat and salad even though we were all sharing one grill in a small booth. Sometimes we would have to ask twice or even three times in order for them to bring us anything. On a side note, the music is also always way too loud. As for the food, they serve lower quality meats compared to let's say Gen in San Jose. The menu didn't have a whole lot of options and the only thing decent was the Beef Brisket in my opinion. When we finished our meal and gave the check back we realized we hadn't put down enough cash, and sure enough, a waiter came back to our table a couple minutes later and let us know we were a couple cents short. During the time he let us know we were a couple cents short and stood waiting at our table for the rest of the cash, I was talking and laughing with my friends and turned to him when he let us know, and for some odd reason, he leaned in and said to me, \"Is there a problem?\" I hadn't done or said anything to him to prompt what he had said, so to end this review, I just want to say this place sucks and to just spend your money elsewhere.

They were too frozen and not very fresh, making it tough to chew. Their menu contains a wide variety of items, but their bulgogi was on the more expensive menu, which disappointed me a bit.

I don't complain even if I waited 4 hours there for seat on a Friday night. Unfortunately, I have to make this complain today so they will train their new waiter on some basic manners and common sense because he really lacks that.\n\nWe were eating and having a good time and this fat and tall waiter asked if we need more food and mentions that we will be charged for any left over which we already know because we've been there many times. When we are done eating, he asked us why we didn't eat those fat, so we told him those are fat and we don't eat fat. He said that you are suppose to eat everything including the fat or I'll charge you. Oh boy, can you believe that? I've never met a waiter in my entire life that would tell me to eat fat. Have you? That's really extreme and out of ordinary. Even though he didn't charge us extra for not eating the fat, it really ruined our happy mood. We asked a waitress to see if we are suppose to eat fat, she said it's okay to leave the fat and not eat them. We told her about the tall and fat guy who told us to eat the fat and she apologized several times which still doesn't make us feel any better because this never happened to us in our entire life. He really lacks basic manners and common sense.\n\nIf you dine there before, then you would know their beef briskets have a lot of fat, so it's normal to get rid of the fat and put them on the side. If you are going to eat there, you should watch out for that fat and tall waiter. if he tries to make you eat the fat too, don't eat it because you are not suppose to.", "author": "Chloe W."}

When we got to the restaurant at about 8pm there were a bunch of people waiting!!! We put our name down and had about 10 people in front of us and the guy said we should be seated in about 30 minutes. Either all these people filled up the place in less than 30 minutes or he just lied to keep us from going somewhere else. Then we didn't even get seated until more than an hour later. My friends were very hungry and annoyed, which I probably would've been too if I didn't have such a late lunch.\n\nBut our waiter was great! He was really fast and attentive, which is necessary at an all you can eat place with a lengthy wait to get seated. The food wasn't really good though and on the bland side. For the short ribs you can only order 1 order per person, which defeats the purpose of ALL YOU CAN EAT. Which consisted of mostly fat and the other meat choices were very dry. Plus they charge you for rice. I have definitely had better all you can eat Korean BBQ elsewhere. \n\nFor my review above I would have gave it **2 STARS**\n\nA couple days later, my friend posted on Facebook that he FOUND A COCKROACH UNDER HIS PLATE more than half way through his meal!!!

Not that you'd order them, because you could vend them for a quarter the price at the mall nearby.\n\nMenu: Its an all you can eat, cook yourself style menu, which can be a lot of fun. Can be. The entire place makes it known that they don't want you to order a lot of food. There's a variety, and for 20 a head, you deserve to order whatever you want. The drinks were outrageously stupid; six or seven bucks for beer. \n\nFood: We ordered Pork Belly, Beef Brisket, and short rib. The less seasoned the meat was, the better. I grew so tired of the taste it's no wonder people order more, searching for a new flavor. If it wasn't seasoned prior, they select terrible quality meat. You get a heaping of sides to create your own salad or noodles to pile meat on, But none of them were above the quality you'd get at a carry out grocery store section.  Just blah. Half the menu is stomach or tripe, but the regular cuts were so blah all sense of adventure was eradicated.\n\nWait staff: the male waiter was nice. Our main waitress, was obviously not pleased that we dare not be 40 year old Asian business men. She was short, eager to rush us, and in our face. When she decided we weren't eating our meat to her portion liking she took to coming to our table and cutting our meat in front us without us consenting or asking. If I wanted to cut it, I would've use the sheers so obviously sitting in the bucket on the table. For an empty place, on an empty night, you should want to be tipped. She was just far too cool for us to be seated in her presence.

He swiftly walks away. I was like \"WTF?\", and we checked our cell phones to make sure... My girl came in earlier and had called me just as I got to the door, hence we knew for sure how long we've been inside thanks to our phone logs.  So, we ignored the nincompoop who probably got his tables mixed up, and decided to continue enjoying our dinner.  Not 5 minutes go by and another waiter tells us we need to hurry up. I told him there must be a mix-up, since we've only been here for 40 minutes. He gives me an uncomfortable look and apologizes. A few minutes later, ANOTHER waiter comes and tells us there's a plate limit and we've exceeded it, so please finish up and leave. I'm getting extremely annoyed now [a buffet with a plate limit = FRAUD], so we finished up quickly due to disgust at the sorry excuse for what this place calls \"service\". I was about to raise a scene, but my girl did not want to ruin the night for the other customers. We believe the manager himself must have wanted to free up more tables to drum up the business of the parties waiting in line. How else can three different waiters coordinate so well to harass us?  We were the only party of 2 coming before the rush that they couldn't fit into the smaller booths, so we were seated in the areas where tables could be combined.  Other larger parties directly next to us were here longer than we had been, but they were not harassed.  \nBUT OH NO, IT'S NOT OVER.\nWhen we got the bill, we saw that they DOUBLED everything we ordered (several dishes we ordered only 1 of, yet every line of the bill showed 2 or more plates of the dishes we got). It's both sad and impressive that they would go so far as to manipulate our bill just in case we argued that we didn't get the chance to eat enough food - there's no other point to it since they don't get more money the more dishes we ordered. \nThey do get one extra star since the meats grill nicely, even if you're a novice, since YakiniQ has nicely greased gas grills. Our usual place is Korean Bar-B-Que in San Bruno, but my girl was of the opinion that charcoal was \"dirty\" and burns the food [I call it extra flavor], and wanted to try YakiniQ. However, she now regrets the suggestion of ever substituting Bar-B-Que with YakiniQ despite of my protests. After getting out the door, she confessed that dealing with YakiniQ's dirty attitude and shady ways is way worse than eating char-coaled food. If there's anything at all in this fiasco to be grateful for, though, it's this - YakiniQ finally gave me one argument where my girl would say I was flat out right and no buts about it. Her win streak is finally broken. Thank You, YakiniQ!\nBUT WE'RE STILL NEVER EVER COMING BACK.  \nSeriously though, my girl feels bad that our date night dinner was such a disappointment. She felt so bad she fought me for the bill and paid for dinner. That's how bad she feels. It's bad. This place is bad. Bad to the point that YakiniQ would make the top 5 under Urban Dictionary's definition of \"bad\".

Add to that a few big bottles of O.B. and some soju and you have the makings of a pretty decent evening.\n\nOf the meats, the spicy pork belly, kalbi, and spicy baby octopus are stand outs.  The pork skin, spicy chicken, and brisket are ok, while the tripe hasn't been great the two times we ordered it.  The banchan is limited to 5 kinds, but it's all fairly decent.\n\nSo there you go.

I made up for lost time.\n\nMy group and I experienced some of the BEST restaurant customer service here (for a not-too-expensive restaurant). In our group of 7, six of us did the AYCE for $20.  One was vegetarian and our server was so cool about it!  He fixed our friend up with a veggie bibimbap and did not fuss.\n\nOn the basic AYCE menu, you have a choice of almost 15 meat items.  I think we tried almost all of them and had our fill.\n\nLOTS of beef brisket (cooks fast, devoured quickly)\nA few pieces of short rib galbi\nSpicy pork belly\nSpicy chicken\nGarlic butter chicken\nSpicy baby octopus - definitely spicy\nTripe\nSteamed egg\nRice cake\n*The spicy items can be a little tricky to cook due to their natural bright red sauce color.  All meats were tasty :)  \n\nLike I said, the waiter was on point!  He made sure we had plenty of soju and Hite to go around.  ;)  A+!  He never made us feel uncomfortable with the amount that we were ordering, replaced the grill when needed, and refilled our banchan when asked.  The guy had a good sense of humor and always service with a smile - what a fun night.\n\nA few things that could be improved:  \n- The ventilation.  I found it REALLY hard to breathe with all of the smoke coming from the grills at nearby tables. Again, our waiter did his best to minimize those discomforts.   \n-  Banchan/sides.  We had less than 10 banchan varieties, when there are typically more.  But what lacks in banchan makes up for in meat! :)  I guess I'll settle.\n\nTip:  Seating is separated into groups larger than 6 vs. those smaller.  Our larger group got seated a lot more quickly compared to the others.\n\nNot a bad place to eat KBBQ and get your drink on in the city!", "author": "Kathleen W."}

However, my experience yesterday was just OK. \n\nWe got there around 11pm, and the place was pretty empty except for 4-5 other tables. They took our order immediately since it was an hour before closing, and we got the galbi, spicy pork belly, and the brisket. The galbi was SO friggen good- I think it was probably one of the best that I've had in a while. It was just marinated really well and super juicy still! However, our spicy pork belly and brisket were both cut in a really awkward thick way. It ended up being REALLY chewy and tough which is disappointing since I really love pork belly/brisket! \n\nFor our second order we got the fire squid, garlic chicken, and honeycomb tripe. I've never actually ordered tripe before at a KBBQ place so it was nice to change it up a bit. However, the tripe was really rubbery after cooking (although I'm not sure if I'm just not accustomed to eating tripe this way.) The garlic chicken was super yummy, but also really thickly cut so it took forever to cook since we wanted to make sure it was completely cooked through! The squid had a nice kick to it! No complaints.\n\nAll in all, I think this place's saving grace was their galbi. I really haven't had that good of galbi at a KBBQ place for a while.

The chicken takes too long to cook and just isn't worth the time and effort when the taste isn't realy all there (garlic butter chicken basically tasted like chicken with salt)\n\nanyways, what should you get?\n\nPork Belly: granted, the pork belly here isn't as great as Oz in Sacramento or places in SoCal, but it isn't too bad and still has that nice fat bacony taste\n\nGalbi: Sadly, you are limited to 1 order per person which is absolute garbage but i guess you gotta deal with what you have. Best dish there imo, they definitely prepare it well.\n\nBig Intestine: Im a sucker for big intestine. It reminds me of really good eggplant for some reason except fatty. If you are a foodie, try it out\n\nSmall Intenstine: a smaller version of big intestine but more chewy and less fatty, worth a try if you are into intestine or want something different.\n\nBulgogi: Can't go wrong with the marinated beef! It has that juicy and sweet flavor you'd expect and will disappear before you know it!\n\nPrime Beef Tongue. Oddly enough, this was pretty good. It was nice and thin and had a lot of flavor surprisingly.\n\nPork Neck Meat: I didn't expect this to be as good as it was. After cutting it up from this thick piece of meat, it looks like your regular chicken but the flavor is much tougher, saltier, and juicier. I never had pork neck meat before but I am a firm believer now!\n\ndownside of this place: unfortunately you won't be as satisfied going here after going to socal or trying better places, but it isn't a bad replacement. service is pretty good and the employees are generally pretty nice! \n\nI recommend having a friend go early to put your name down as the lines can get crazy, or to figure out something to do around japantown if you decide to just go on a whim at night.", "author": "Dylan T."}

The variety of food is excellent and it's not sitting out buffet style, so the meat looks much fresher than Palace's does. I came here with a group of 6, and we all got the $19.99 AYCE. \n\nThe kalbi is limited to one order per person. One order = two short ribs. You should know that you want to get every single order of kalbi you're allotted. For us, this meant 12 short ribs, and we finished every last bite. The marinade KILLS, it's so good. The bones fall right out, and even the bits around the bone are delicious. Seriously, stock up on this. This is the tastiest thing on the $19.99 menu.\n\nBrisket is good. It comes thinly sliced and curled up, and cooks very quickly. Good quality meat; not too fatty.\n\nSam gyup sal (pork belly) was also tasty. Bonus points for having the sesame oil/ salt sauce that goes so deliciously with sam gyup sal. I just ate it right up. \n\nGet the octopus! It comes in a metal pan that takes too long to cook, so we just dumped the contents onto the grill. Delicious sauce, and juicy to boot! Well flavored. We had to get two orders of this because it was irresistible. \n\nWe tried the tripe, and it was mostly flavorless, but the texture was spot on, just as tripe should be. I think the tripe would greatly benefit from some type of marinade.\n\nGyeranjjim was tasty! (that's steamed egg dish) I'm glad I could have gotten seconds, but I didn't because I was too full from eating meat. Also they have nurungji, which I'm not a huge fan of, but it was tasty from the spoonful I had of someone else's. \n\nSauces were great; we weren't served the doenjang sauce + jalapeno + garlic side right away, but asking for it was definitely worth it. I can't eat Korean BBQ without the orange sauce and some grilled garlic. I also really like that they serve the rice noodle wrap, but I don't like that they charge for lettuce. \n\nWe came on a rainy Wednesday evening, and it was pretty empty. We had most of the restaurant to ourselves.\n\nJust as a sidenote: Leave your jackets and other things you don't want smelling like meat in the car (or at home!). Or stuff them in your purse.

The quality of the meat is basic and cheap. \n\nWhat is worse is the service. For some reason, the last couple times we came here, they had no rice cake wraps because they ran out. Today, they just did not have it because the delivery did not come in.  So we asked if we can just replace the rice cake wrap with one of the $24.99 items without getting charged the extra. The server said, \"yes\" and brought two pieces of the pork neck meat and a few slices of the tongue. We were under the impression that the server understood us and so we refrained from ordering anything else on the $24.99 menu. \n\nInstead, when the bill came, we got charged the $24.99 menu and the bill was manipulated to look as though we had ordered 4 servings of the beef tongue and 2 servings of pork neck. Which is funny because I did not have a single piece of pork neck and the beef tongue was not that much better than the brisket that I'd eat 4 servings of it. And by the way, it was only my bf and me. When we asked why we were charged $24.95/pp, suddenly the waiter feigned ignorance. We tried explaining but instead, they just smirked and laughed at us, telling us we should have looked at the menu. One of the waiters said, \"The rice cakes are little. Why would we give you meat for that?\" Maybe because you included an item on the menu but actually do not have? But fine, say no! Do not say yes and then charge us behind our backs. And with that waiter's logic, if we had known we were paying $24.99/pp, then why wouldn't we order bulgogi and more dishes from the $24.99 menu??\n\nIf they had said no to the replacement in the first place, i would have been absolutely fine with it because I've had beef tongue and pork neck before and i was not particularly craving it. But their condescending responses and smirks were on another level. And then after much argument, the waiter brings our check and said he paid the difference. We, of course, declined to take his money and paid our $24.99 each. \n\nToo bad this is the only AYCE Kbbq place in the City. If this was in So Cal, this place would not survive. Unfortunate because I really wanted to give it at least 3 stars since the manager had welcomed us so warmly in the beginning. I do not take service lightly.

Like many have mentioned before, it's very weird that they limit the Kalbi meat you can order.. In our case it was 5 slices of meat.

Yeah I don't even think it was lettuce.. I'm not sure. I didn't eat much of it. Japchae is our absolute favorite & it was part of the banchan where you would usually have to buy it separate at other places. It was okay but I wouldn't have minded paying extra for a more flavorful kind. \n\nThe meats we tried:\nBrisket -- it was okay. Not as flavorful as I'm used to\nKalbi -- very yummy but limited\nPork belly -- not bad when cooked very crispy \nSquid that's supposed to be extremely hot -- not really that spicy actually & my tolerance isn't THAT amazing \n**kind of disappointed they took the baby octopus out of the menu because we were excited to try that. \n\nThe service was odd.

I thought this was a little ridiculous to have this limitation on what they advertise to be an all-you-can eat place. I then thought the more expensive price would include all-you-can-eat kalbi for the extra money, but nope, same restrictions. The extra price only includes an extra three different kinds of meat you are able to get. I think it's also a little ridiculous that they charge for lettuce at an all-you-can-eat place. REALLY??? You're gonna be skimping on LETTUCE and charge an arm-and-a-leg for it?? \n\nThe good is that they do have a variety of meat you are able to get. They also include in the all-you-can-eat the steamed egg, which I am a big big fan of, even if it is a filler food. I like to eat it between meats. Instead of lettuce, they give you unlimited rice-noodle-wraps, so I satisfied myself with wrapping my meats in that instead of lettuce (still not a happy camper with the lack of lettuce though......). Their selection of banchan was decent - nothing amazing, nothing horrible. They also change the grill very often without us having to ask, which is much appreciated it.

It's not a bad deal considering there are many more places where all you can eat is significantly higher in cost. \n\nThe banchan that comes with the meal isn't amazing. Kimchee, Korean potatoes, japchae, seaweed, sprouts. It was rather limited. There was this additional banchan that was a Sunday special, so it only came out once? My family devoured it so I didn't even get to try it. \n\nThe $19.99 menu comes with beef brisket, galbi, pork belly, spicy pork belly, miso pork belly, spicy chicken, garlic butter chicken, fire squid, tripe, intestines, rice soup, steamed egg, rice cake wrap. The $23.99 menu comes with all those items plus bulgogi,  beef tongue, and pork neck. Rice isn't on the menu but we didn't get charged for it when we asked for it. Also, for galbi you only get one order per person (odd, isn't it AYCE? but they do have it in fine print on the menu on the wall). \n\nAll the meats were really tasty, heavily marinated but delicious IF you don't overcook it. And obviously, if you do, it's your own fault! Is it just me or the rice cake wrap pieces were super thick? The thin ones are the best and these were just thick and hard to peel apart without ripping it completely. \n\nAfter reading a couple yelp reviews, we apparently got the best waiter of the bunch.

As a matter of fact, I've recommended this place to a lot of my friends. Finally, a cheap Korean BBQ place where I can eat til my heart's content(for 2 hours). Yesterday, I came here with a group of friends to celebrate graduation and to be together before my friends go out of the state/city for college. We ordered the beef brisket first. Of all times I've been here, I've never seen them bring out plates of frozen meat. They just brought out a plate of frozen beef brisket and dumped it all onto our grill. Frozen meat isn't that bad. I guess you get what you paid for. \n\nMy friends and I proceeded to order plates on plates of food. Our favorite of the night happens to be the steamed egg. We got the steamed egg maybe 5-6 times? It made up almost half of what we ate. It has a smooth consistency that is probably very easy on the stomach, unlike all of the meat we also ate. Sadly, we were mortified when we were eating our last order if the steamed egg..I had discovered what seems to be RAT POOP in our steamed egg. I took a spoonful and saw something that didn't appear to be a piece of green onion; it was dark and was in a pellet-form. I examined it closely and I am 110% sure that it resembled my pet hamster's poop.\n\nMy friends and I brought it to the attention of one of the waiters. He didn't even bother to apologize. He just looked at it and said \"oh..\". He also asked for the napkin that we had placed the rat poop on and took the steamed egg from us. The napkin and steamed egg were then thrown into the wash bin. I think he later told the manager because they were both glancing at our table. By then, my friends and I were too disgusted and mortified to order anymore food. We ate what was left in out plates to avoid the 18% fee for any unfinished meat. As it was nearing the 2 hour mark, the waiter brought us our bill. After paying the bill, the waiter really had the audacity to bring us a seperate receipt with the tipping percentages. He basically forced us to pay tips even when he handled our problem unprofessionally. We were going to just leave without paying tips, but we're nice people so we at least payed 6% as tips instead of the 9% that they \"recommended\" (aka forced upon) \n\nI'm sorry Yakini Q, you have lost yourself a loyal customer and several other customers. An apology would still be nice. This is the first time I've gotten the runs from eating here. My friends & I will never eat here again. Please take care of this problem so that others won't get sick .", "author": "Calvin Y."}

Just ditched this place for good. I've been here multiple times in the past, including for my birthday, and have even frequented their San Jose location when I lived there. Never in my life have I felt threatened by the host or manager EVER. I came up to write my name down, the host aggressively crossed out my name, and quickly flipped to the 2nd page to signal me that one side of the page is for parties for less than 5 people, and the other for parties with more. Through this whole interaction he made no eye contact and didn't say a word to me. He then proceeded to banging on the table and throwing a receipt behind him. I then asked how long he thought the wait was, he IGNORED me. Im also in the service industry as well and so I thought... Okay maybe he's having a bad day, it's a busy Friday, etc etc. I then asked where the bathroom was and he IGNORED me again. Why I even thought to consider your feelings, I have no idea why. Maybe I'm just human like you. But the fact that this business could care less about a paying REPEATING customer, and the host thinking it's perfectly okay to make me feel threatened and ignored, is more than enough for me to never come back. I'll also never return to the San Jose location since they could care less about their customers there too.

The side dishes are of the best I have ever had at a Korean place. Service is fast and extremely prompt and willing to refill any empty dishes. It never ceases to amaze how they can remember everything we order.\n\nThe first time I went here I was not impressed with their food quality. Their meat was originally a bit dry and chewy. Everything I ordered was either bland, too spicy or just unappetizing.\n\nThe meats now are well seasoned and tender. The side dishes are fresh and the steamed egg (my personal favorite) is made to order so when it comes to me, it's piping hot!! Delish!!\n\nThere's a limit of Kalbi but I can see why. Once you eat it, you reall cannot stop. If they did not restrict my intake, they would immediately go belly up.\n\nTried everything , pork neck is fatty! Porridge is like soup. Most of the menu is very heavy so you can really only try it once or twice before you move onto the rest.\n\nInsider tip #1: There is a frequent buyer card as well. For every bill, you get a card that gives you something like 2% of what you spend. Once you reach $10, you can redeem at your next visit. Isn't that amazing ?\n\nTip 2: Free meal on your birthday with 4 paying customers!\n\nTip 3: BRING your GRANDMOTHER?? We got VIP treatment when Grandma was there. She was given the utmost attention! Yakini really knows how to treat the elderly.\n\nTip 4: finally, they have good fresh Korean music that features beautiful and skinny girls. Don't watch it.

If you don't have the coupon, I would say the $19.99 menu is way more worth it unless you really love the exotic stuff like pork belly, beef tongue, and intestines.\n\nWe were immediately seated and brought a variety of sides, as per usual in Korean restaurants: mashed potatoes, bean sprouts, kimchi, and salad (waaayyy too raw oniony for my taste).  They were nothing great, but nice to munch on anyway.  We also got a steamed egg (yummy!) and rice paper, which we ate with the meat.\n\nWe tried the beef brisket, beef boneless short ribs, marinated boneless short ribs, beef tongue, pork belly, and spicy octopus.  We loved the marinated boneless short ribs because of the sweetness and tenderness of the meat, and if we came back, we would pretty much focus only on that.  The rest of the meat is just okay, although it was nice to be able to try a variety.\n\nAs expected, with no veggies and so much meat, we felt absolutely disgusting at the end of the meal (at no fault of the restaurant!).  Our server recommended ending the meal with the rice soup, which is basically just overcooked and very watery white rice, but it was the perfect thing to sooth my angry stomach.\n\nThe bright spot of this meal, however, was the service.  The people are extremely friendly, energetic, and attentive here.  It seems like they really want you to enjoy your time here and take full advantage of the all-you-can-eat.\n\nOverall, interesting meal, but I personally probably would not come back.  It was a great experience, but unless you absolutely love meat and absolutely nothing but meat, you probably won't be a regular here.", "author": "Carrie C."}

One asked what we wanted and the other came a little later and asked if someone had helped us already.\n\nSo remember people!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-18", "description": "An AYCE Korean BBQ restaurant is very hard to find in the Bay Area, so I have to give this place three stars for offering AYCE alone.\n\nUnfortunately, the quality of the meat is subpar and if I had to compare to a Korean BBQ place in SoCal it would definitely get 1 or 2 stars. However, it's a fun experience for those of us who are deprived of kbbq in the bay area. The environment is fun and is good for large groups, but you must come at 5pm or a little earlier if you do not want to wait for at least 2 hours. Our group of 9 people was able to come in on a Saturday night at 5pm with no wait at all despite not having made a reservation. \nHere's the breakdown:\n\nFood:\n-I think it's definitely stingy that they only offer 1 order of Korean ribs per person, ribs are often the staple of kbbq and they charge you if you order more than that. When a restaurant claims they are AYCE, they should really stick to that principal. \n-We stuck to the brisket for the most part because it cooked much faster and each portion they gave was quite large. Unfortunately, when we first grilled it all the meat stuck to the grill because they are definitely not buttered down or oiled properly. Meat only began to unstick when the grease the other meats on the grill finally loosened it up.\n-I'd advise you to stay away from the pork belly, the cuts are about 1 inch thick and it would definitely take a very long time to cook (which I'm sure they intended). Pork belly is usually cut thin in Kbbq restaurants, but the fact they give you such big cuts to deter you from ordering more meat is telling.\n-The other more \"exotic\" meats like the chicken gizzards, squid, and tripe are also a hassle to cook on the grill because they often got stuck. I wouldn't recommend getting too many orders of these because they take awhile on the grill and just are not as filling as tasty as the regular meat.\n\nService:\n-Definitely not great service, the waiters are very busy and you really have to flag them down if you want something. They also seem irritated when you ask, but they should expect this and should be more accommodating because at an AYCE place of course there will be customers constantly asking for things. I know an 18% tip is included for parties of 6 or more, but have they ever thought people will be willing to tip even more than that if there's great service?\n\nPrice:\n$20 for AYCE is not bad for SF, but they charge you around $24 if you want higher quality meat such as tongue and ribs. If I was just with one other person I may get the higher deal, but if you're in a big group and you want the $24 deal everyone else will have to pay the higher fee too.\n\nAll in all, I may come back if there's a special occasion and I'm really craving KBBQ. But I would not make this my go to spot because the quality of the meat is lacking and service definitely needs to be improved.", "author": "Sara W."}

This is not a negative by itself, as a restaurant with good business will always be busy during popular dinner hours.  However, it seemed like there were always at least 2 tables open at any given time - sometimes up to 5 open tables - and these were not filled for 20-30 min each.  Even if these were reserved for party reservations, there should be a time limit on how long these tables can be reserved before being open up to the already-waiting parties.  I'm not a fan of how they handle their table seating.\n\nThen, there are tables which take forever to finish their dinners and seem oblivious to the outside world.  One table seemed to have finished at least 3 rounds of food when I arrived, and when I was seated, they were still eating.  By the time I was done, they were debating how to split up the bill.  While this is not a fault of the restaurant, it does take away from the whole dining experience (at least for me).\n\nThe food itself was quite decent, given the circumstances.

Let's think about what all-you-can-eat means: it means you theoretically should be allowed to eat as much as you're capable of. So when I heard we were going for AYCE Korean BBQ, I ate a single apple that day for breakfast to prepare myself. \n\nSo we show up at 5pm, which is when they open, and we tell them we have a reservation for 7. What's that? You don't have our reservation? You're trying to say we might have called the wrong place even after we show you when we called your restaurant on our phone? The place is completely empty, since they just opened, but after some back-and-forth, they say they can seat us as long as we're done by 6:30. Uh... have you met me? Have you seen how much I can eat? Add to the cooking time and I could only begrudgingly agree. \n\nSo you get the menu and there's a $19.99/person options or a $23.99/person option. You get a few more choices with the $23.99 option, but we figured we'd be content with the first choice. So you can order three items at a time, so we started off with the galbi. The banchan comes out, it's not bad. The meat comes out and we start happily grilling away. A 'pitcher' of Hite beer goes well with the meat. Then I start finding out that this AYCE situation is really nickel and diming you for every last cent. Want some lettuce to wrap up that meat and rice in? That's extra. Want some rice? That's extra. Want some rice wrappers? That's extra. AND THEN I FIND OUT THE REAL KICKER: YOU ONLY GET ONE ORDER OF GALBI PER PERSON!!!!\n\nW.T.F.\n\nHey, I'm not trying to eat a whole side of beef here, but the galbi was the best option by far, and knowing that we would only be getting a few pieces per person was a straight up insult. Actually, I'm getting steamed up as I write this. The other stuff they serve up is not that great, so I would have just kept on ordering the galbi if I could have. Instead, I'm left to grill chicken, some poor quality beef slices, and chewy pork skin. No. No. No. And since you can only order the three items at a time, once they get busy, the service definitely takes longer and longer to bring out the orders, which means you're wasting precious time sitting around and not eating. So 6:30 rolls around, they're dropping the big hints that it's time for us to leave. Gladly. \n\nPossibly one of the first AYCE places that I've ever walked out of still somewhat hungry. The quality of the food is decent, but for real... not worth it in my opinion. You might as well find a reason to head down to Sunnyvale and pay a few extra bucks for Palace BBQ and actually be satisfied with all-you-can-eat.", "author": "Saunders C."}

This language reflects the vibe of this joint. The music was so loud that we had to shout, and repeat our order to Mr. Waiter guy.  Korean music videos goin on the flat screens. Maybe the music is loud cos people are so concerned about stuffing themselves, talking is not an option.  Food was average, a bit salty.

Price: $19.99 for AYCE and with the $24.99 AYCE, you get some extra meat including beef tongue and bugolgi and some others.

It was way packed, but I got seated on time.  However, I was disappointed that there was one grill to 8 people and tried to ask my waiter if it was possible for two grills. My waiter literally told me all the reasons why 2 grills wouldn't be necessary....... \"8 people was just here before so this should be okay for you.  Also, you only have two hours, how much can you really eat?  I would want to seat you in a bigger table too, but can't so yeah.\"  I just thought it was rather rude to tell me how much my party can eat and I had a few bigger (yes, as in size) people in my group, so I was literally asking about comfort as well.   We were crammed in the small table where my mom had to get up multiple times for the waiter to get extra chairs during our meal.\n\nDespite this beginning, we ordered the kalbi and it was delicious.  Well-marinated and good quality meat.  It was very tasty!  My only issue was that they only give two pieces per order and only 1 order max per person.  It was a bit deceiving since these meats weren't the largest pieces, but it's okay since they are the good quality meats?  The brisket was good though, but some cuts had a lot of fat, but what's kbbq meat without some fat right?   The chicken gizzards were also really tasty and a good texture.  Not too chewy.  The garlic chicken was OK, nothing that special about the marinate, but it was good quality chicken.  We also ordered the Miso Pork Belly, which was alright, I didn't taste much miso.  However, I think the Spicy Pork Belly was the best on the menu!  Good thick slices and not too much fat.  It was well marinated and had just the right kick, but not too spicy.  Overall, the marinated meats were very tasty.\n\nSide dishes - they were all pretty good, but I was REALLY disappointed that they \"ran out\" of rice paper and rice rolls that early at 7:30PM.

However, AYCE comes with unlimited steamed egg.\n\nService  - our server came back and forth with us using our buzzer bell and asked us if we wanted more meat and such.  It took rather long for our meats and sides to come for refill though. This was the disappointing part.  Also, when we asked for a portion of meat, they seemed like they were really skimping.

Initially, I was somewhat reluctant to come because reviews seemed to criticize the service. I was a bit worried that, being a  first timer (with the impressionable parents!), it would've been awkward for us in the bustling korean bbq scene. \n\nUpon arriving, I was anticipating perhaps a 30 minute to an hour wait (as reviews had suggested), but, to my pleasant surprise, we were seated almost immediately at a booth. \n\nAlthough they give you a limited serving of gal-bi, I think the portion size was enough to satisfy that gal-bi crave. My regret is getting so much chicken, though. When I ordered spicy pork belly, they accidentally gave us spicy chicken, which we've already eaten enough of.  When I tried to re-order, they said that they couldn't give us anything else until we had finished what we already had at our table. That irritated me. \n\n So, 3 dishes of spicy chicken later, I was too full (and sick of the spice) to even try their spicy pork belly and pork belly....  I guess moral of the story?

While the wait can be long, about an hour during peak evening hours, it is a great late evening place. There are four criteria I use to assess Hot Pot and Korean BBQ joints - 1) quality and selection of grill-able ingredients (and broth if Hot Pot), 2) quality of dipping sauces, 3) price, and 4) atmosphere and service.\n\nSome may say better quality and a larger selection could be found elsewhere, but I have absolutely no complaints.  On the contrary, you won't see me get my Korean BBQ fix anywhere else in SF.  I don't enjoy paying an arm and a leg for over-rated fair elsewhere in the city. \n\nAt this price ($20 a person), the quality is pretty darn good, and the selection is just fine.  Sometimes less is more.  Do a few things really well and people will love you. The kimchi and steamed egg are also quite good.  But what I really appreciate is the dipping sauces - they bring you two types, hot sesame oil and the other to satisfy your spicy cravings. No need to for me to bring my home-made Thai dipping sauces with me, unlike most mundane sha-bu sha-bu and other K BBQ places in the Bay area. \n\nLastly, the service is friendly and efficient, and the place has a great after-hours hangout feel.

For a Korean BBQ place, it's 2 stars based solely on food quality.  But for being AYCE for around 20 bucks, and a fun place to eat with a group...it's 4 stars.  So I gave it a rating of 3 stars.\n\nBeef Brisket - quite good and not far off in quality from a regular good Korean BBQ place.\n\nKalbi - I see a lot of complaints that they only allow 1 per person. To be honest, I love kalbi and I don't even order my 1 portion sometimes. It is NOT their best. The meat quality is pretty poor (way too much fat) and the marination is a litle too rich.\n\nPork belly - Not as good a cut as you'll get at another BBQ place but hard to go wrong with it. \n\nSpicy pork belly - Pretty good.\n\nBaby octopus - this is actually pretty good.  Ask for more of their spicy sauce and pour on top after you throw on the grill for extra kick.\n\nChicken - frankly, not worth filling your belly with.\n\nThen you can add certain cuts for 3 bucks more:\n\nBulgogi - everytime I've had it, they've marinated it way too heavy and rich.  You'll be drinking water every 10 minutes for the next 24 hours.\n\nPork neck - now this might be the best cut. I recommend paying the extra 3 bucks and going with this instead of pork belly.\n\nPork Skin - I never really developed a taste for it but some people love it.  According to Korean urban legend, it helps your skin tone. Could be coincidence, but every girl I've seen eat this actually did have very nice skin tone.\n\nSome additional notes:\n\n- You can ask for rice cake wrap. It's included.\n- You can ask for a wrap made from thin slices of Korean radish. It's not included but good.\n- You can go the traditional route and ask for lettuce to wrap as ssam.\n- Their jjigae stews are not that great.\n- Their nengmyun (iced buckwheat noodles) is pretty decent if you're a fan of them. \n- Try throwing some kimchi and garlice slices on the grill. Dip the grilled garlic in the spicy sauce and eat. \n- They give you sesame oil. Add some salt and pepper to it. Dip unmarinated meats into it.\n- So yes the grill is not completely flat and it does have holes in it. However, we have on occcasion asked for rice, sesame oil, kimchi, and pepper paste and thrown them all on the grill and fried them together at the end with leftover pork belly pieces.

No stars if I could. Don't go here if it's only a party of 2. We came in early ready to eat some BBQ. He seated us in the middle where the seats don't have a back rest and the middle portion is for a party of \"2\" or if it's a large large party. He seated us so close to another party that my partner didn't feel comfortable. I asked him nicely that we wanted a booth and that my partner has lower back problems so he needs to rest his back on something. He refuses and says \"sorry but we cannot bcus it's only for bigger parties of 4 people.\" WTF this host is racist bcus I can see two Japanese people in a booth and I EVEN POINTED AT THEM. His response was \"oh they will be done in 15 mins\" wtf? What kinda service is this. So upset that we had to leave, I'll rather give business to a place that deserves it.  You don't deserve my money if I can't even sit comfortably with my partner. Let me tell you if you're not serving what the customer wants you will lose business. This was very upsetting and dumb so we left. It's funny how they couldn't give us a booth when there was so many booths open... \n\n\nLet me back track. So the very first time this happen was a few weeks back. We waited till it opened and we were seated all the way in the far back for party of two in the middle section and I said the same thing and got the same response back but I let it go.. This was still upsetting but I let it go. DOESNT IT MAKE SENSE BEING THERE EARLY MEANS OPEN SEATING? And there was no line at the door. Still got seated in the wrong seat. To happen a second time?

Who needs a reason for succulent, all-you-can eat Korean BBQ?\n\nThe cuts of the meat are excellent.  The meat's really good quality, and they slice it thinner so that it cooks faster (nothing is more annoying than meat that takes forever and a day to cook.)  Whatever they lack in side dishes, they make up for in the selection of meat.  You can order 3 types of meat at a time, and when you're ready for more, simply press the button at the side of the table, and voila!  A friendly, polite server arrives.  The service at this place is great--they're very attentive, but at the same time, they don't pop in and interrupt your conversation every five minutes to ask if everything's okay.  \n\nThe place is usually busy, and if you're not in right when they open, you'll find yourself waiting ten or fifteen minutes--not too long.  Once me and my friends waited sixteen minutes (the hungry don't count the time), and the owner (or manager?) made sure to come to our table every so often, to cook the meat, or offer other food that didn't appear on the bill.  It wasn't necessary, but it sure was appreciated.  \n\nThis place can be loud, but not overwhelmingly so. There is also several flat screen T.V.s playing Korean music videos, which me and my friends get a huge kick out of.

None of the kids ate more than half a bowl of white rice. \n \n2. My friend have a $50 coupon from restaurant.com that she gave to the waiter at the end and he said he can't honor it because she should have gave it to him in the beginning. Basically he can't adjust the bill, it's too late. He then told us that he comp the alcohol and when we checked the bill it wasn't true. Each bottle was accounted for.\nFinally my frustrated friend talked to the manager and he honored it with a frown. \n\nIt seems to me that they try to get every buck from you by charging babies for food they barely eat and lying.

There's two flat screen TVs inside that are playing nonstop k-pop music videos and nonstop k-pop music playing. The music playing doesn't match the music videos playing though. Ventilation in this place really sucks when it gets packed. There's a thick feeling of smoke that just weighs you down. The wait time for a party of 6 was about 15 minutes. One word of warning is they don't take reservations unless the party is 8 or more. There doesn't seem to be a time limit for eating also.\n\nThere's two all you can eat options you can pick from. One is 19.99 and the other is 23.99. The difference is the 23.99 has 3 extra different meat choices, which are bulgogi, pork neck meat, and beef tongue. One down side is the kalibi short ribs is limited 1 order (it comes with 2 pieces) per person. If you're not trying to eat your fill in kalbi short ribs, then it's all good. With some many choices, there isn't really a reason to be stuck on just kalbi... there's a lot of other meats to try.\n\nGood choices to try are the beef brisket, kalbi ribs, bulgogi, spicy chicken, and the garlic butter chicken. Beef brisket, kalbi ribs, and bulgogi are usually the common choices in kbbq places and this place did not disappoint. The meat was tender and well marinated. The bulgogi is a bit different from other places as it was a long strip of rib eye beef instead of small chopped slices like some other places. The spicy chicken and garlic butter chicken stood out also with their well seasoned marinates. \n\nService-wise, it was really good. There's a button to press to call the waiter/waitress to have them help. The wait time was less than 10 seconds for someone to come. There was waiters going around also to exchange the grill for new ones without asking when it was filled with charred stuff. \n\nOverall, I would give this place 3.5 stars. It's a pretty good place to have an all you can eat kbbq. I would've rated it higher if it wasn't for the badly ventilated room.", "author": "Steven B."}

It's great for parties & big groups, but not everything is All You Can Eat! As mentioned by other reviewers, the only con to this place is that the Kalbi (Marinated short ribs) is limited to One per person!

Dress casual if you don't want your \"nice clothes\" to smell like endless Korean BBQ.\n\nKimchi fried rice was $3.99? and came in a cute little bento-like container.

Can you have a little more common sense? Why would I order one item at a time? \n\nAnother time, I asked for the galbi. It was limited to only one order or something, i know. I knew we didn't order it yet so we asked him for it. That same server yells, \"YOU ALREADY ORDERED IT NO MORE.\" So, I asked the manager for it, lol. And bam. The galbi came. \n\nOf course, that server's attitude turned a whole 180 degrees when I asked for the check. Wow. It was incredible. He stopped yelling and asked \"was the food okay today? Is there anything else I can get for you guys?\" Maybe take a self assessment about your attitude, that'd help. \n\nI wanted to leave tips for the other servers since they were really nice. Then I thought about how they'd split it with him and automatically took back all the tips and left them a smaller one.\n\nI work in customer service. I know sometimes, you may be having an off day.

That said, it doesn't hold a lick to AYCE Korean BBQ joints in Koreatown LA.\n\nAs is the service for any buffet or all you can eat places, YakiniQ servers are pretty slow to come around and bring you more side dishes or fill your glass especially at peak dinner times. It's hard to fit more than 6 people at one table since there's only one grill. The meat is good, but more on the fatty side though. They've got your standard set of meats: brisket, pork belly, short rib, marinated beef, marinated chicken. And also some out of the ordinaries with pork skin/neck, octopus, and intestine if I remember correctly.

The South Bay or even Oakland have always been better choices. YakiniQ doesn't do anything to change that fact, but I always welcome more options. \n\nWhat you get here is meat. Lots of it. Sometimes you wake up with a craving for ridiculous amounts of protein and this place satisfies that need. It definitely doesn't reach the same level of quality or taste of even the second tier AYCE places in socal, but you also get to save a 5.5 hr car ride to get there. Set reasonable expectations, order a cold mool naengmyun (noodles) at the end of your meal to wash down all the meat, and you'll find that even mediocre Korean bbq is still pretty friggin good. \n\nIt's more expensive than a place you'd find in socal, but socal places subsidize their food prices with the sheer amount of liquor that's ordered, a business model that doesn't work quite as well in SF.\n\nIf you are a drinker, YakiniQ is a great place to drink makgeolli, aka Korean rice wine, and they serve it in cheap metal bowls the way it's supposed to be.\n\nThe place loses stars not for the food, but the spotty service. Come here on a Fri or Saturday for dinner and expect long waits between visits from the waiters and waitresses. I think I saw 3 very overworked servers for the entire place and a lot of empty grills.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-05-11", "description": "Let's review!\n\nThis is YakiniQ, whose name is derived from YAKINIKU, the Japanese term for \"grilled meat\" and often used to refer to Korean barbeque. Indeed, this place is a KBBQ place (no worries, I've confirmed it).\n\nAs per the usual rating scheme (which is still a work in progress), the breakdown for those who are interested in specific aspects are as follows.\n\nDecor: 0.75\nEfficient tabling with booths and regular table stacked in rows. One petty objection I have is how close the other tables are. I don't want their smoke over on our side. When it got later into the evening, they turned down the lights. Maybe for ambiance? I'm always suspicious of places that do that because it feels like they're trying to obscure the prices under the influence of the dark and alcohol. In any case, it didn't bother me, and it's probably a nice touch.\n\nThere's a TV constantly playing Korean music videos, with the Kpop sometimes matching it, maybe. That was nice.\n\nFood: 0.75\nWelp. If it were the animal world, it would have been a grotesque Armageddon of seven rabid jaguars (after somehow ending up at a domestication farm) ripping apart cows, pigs and chickens. We got plates of fresh meat that turned out great. To me, the marination didn't seem too thorough. I noticed the quantity of black pepper specks on the kalbi were not nearly enough to indicate it was fully basted (ideally over time but who can expect that for an AYCE place).\n\nThe meats we tried on the menu (kalbi, beef brisket, spicy chicken, spicy and regular samgyupsal) were satisfactory and I recommend all. Though it depends on who the grillmaster/grillmistress is, too :)\n\nI didn't like the intestine, but I'm just biased against eating non-muscular mammalian organs.\n\nIn any case, expect some morning-after bloating.\n\nPrice: 0.5\n$20 (rounded up) for AYCE is on the borderline of too expensive, especially when kalbi is limited to one order per person. Palace BBQ for $22(?) dinner on El Camino seems like a better deal with no limits and a cornucopia of side items. But it was a very special occasion for us, so the price was probably not a big deterrence. Most likely people would come pig out (more like pork in (to your mouth), m i rite) here for infrequent occasions. Also, I can always blame it on its S.F. location.\n\nSoju bottles were $11 each. Wow! This section was almost reaching 0.75 but nnno, not anymore.\n\nWe weren't warned of the 18% gratuity either. As mentioned, our group was 7 people.\n\nToday's price/portion ratio: Technically approaching 0 when disregarding the kalbi limit. The sky's the limit, and by \"sky\" I mean how much you can take in.\n\nService: 0.75\nMost of the employees were very friendly. Smiling and acknowledging when I (as the ordering person) ask for x orders of such and such meat. They changed the grill as it blackened and became unusable. They noticed when I seemed ready to order additional portions. They allowed us plenty of socialization time before laying down the check. One person dumped the leftover meat on my plate for some reason when changing the grill. That was a little off-putting.\n\nBonus: 0.25\nEh, I vaguely remember someone IRL or a Yelp review telling me this was the best KBBQ place around. I also had a good time interacting with my associates in close quarters for about 4 hours.\n\nOverall: 3/5\n1 star: not recommended\n2 stars: recommended\n3 stars: recommended with a nod\nIt's expensive in absolute terms to go often. But taking into account the above factors, I recommend this place as a whole. I imagined myself doing so with pursed lips and raised eyebrows, you know, the kind that causes a wrinkled forehead--I don't even know what to call this; please respond if you know the proper term, and I will send you a reply back thanking you.

The booth seating is pretty private- they turned down the lights after we were seated, I think it was the time of day (My friend joked that they did this so we don't get embarrassed by how much we pigged out haha.)

I may be spoiled by all of the dirt cheap K-BBQ restaurants in LA and my go-to place in the south bay, but I felt that there weren't enough sides and found myself getting bored of the food and not caring about getting my moneys worth for AYCE.  Sides you get are japchae (korean vermicelli noodles), salad with a creamy type of dressing, kimchi, some sort of seaweed salad, and potato salad.\n\nThere are 2 set menues of AYCE. First one is about $19 and the second is about $24 with the addition of bulgogi. Add ons such as lettuce are an additional cost.  \n\nAll of the meats were just ok to me, but the one that stood out the most was the garlic buttered chicken.  I couldnt get enough of it! Moist and flavorful chicken wrapped in a noodle roll with a piece of kimchi was the highlight of my meal. Oh yeah, sesame oil and a delicious type of hot sauce is set on the table for each individual. If you like spicy, make sure to smother your meat in that hot sauce and it'll hit the spot!  \n\nService was hit or miss. Ring the bell when you want something refilled and appears either a guy who doesn't smile and seems to hate his job or a friendly woman who seems like she's doing her dream job.  Don't plan any plans with people who didn't eat with you as you will make them hungry from the smell of kbbq lingering on your clothes and make sure to make reservations as the place can hold maybe 12 parties at a time.\n\nYakiniQ is an OK place to go to if you haven't experienced KBBQ yet but if you're a KBBQ connisouer, you may not be impressed. 3 out of 5 of us hadn't had KBBQ before and liked it.

The beef brisket is great for the \"wraps\".  I wouldn't eat it alone, because you'll complain that it's too dry.  Get a rice paper, smear some hot chili sauce, a piece of kim chi, maybe some add'l bon chon sprout or seaweed, and then a piece of meat.  That is the real filler here!\n\nBy all means skip the tripe.  Bland and tough.  And no matter how long  you leave the pork skin on the grill, it won't ever crisp up like you think it would.  And the big intestines is waaay too tough to eat.  They may serve it to you regardless because seemingly no one orders that.  Kinda gross to see it moving and shrinking once it hits the hot grill.  Plus that's where the poop comes out.\n\nThe steamed egg is delicious although you really have to keep requesting it.  it could be because it takes awhile to prepare or they lose track of the order.  Chop chae runs out fast... weird, that's usually so easy to prepare and they could just keep in some sort of big warm pan.\n\nThe service is actually quite efficient and very friendly in such a high demand type of restaurant.  Korean restaurants often have a doorbell to summon the wait staff and they're quite prompt to each call.  Korean restaurants also mean a lot of drinking and when patrons get more and more rowdy, the more patient and light hearted the wait staff have to get.

I'm a meat lover and plate after plate of meat for one price is just a genius idea. I've been to numerous Korean BBQ places, and nothing I've ever had in Northern California even comes close to the ones in SoCal. \n\nThat is, until I ate at YakiniQ. The service is infinitely better than any Korean BBQ place I've been to, and even rivals a lot of upper class restaurants. The only reserve I had about the service is that they don't always refill your drinks without you asking, which is my biggest pet peeve when being served, but they have a call button and are fast to respond. The servers are also very friendly and welcoming which came to as a pleasant surprise from my experience at the SoCal Korean BBQ joints.\n\nThe food is of a lot higher quality than any other Korean BBQ places as well. I ordered the least pricey of the courses, and it was delicious. Also, I did not have that clogged oily feeling I usually get after gorging myself on multiple plates of meat. The chicken was actual cuts of chicken, not the random assortments that are usually served, and even the quick and cheap cuts like the pork belly and beef brisket had a lot of flavor.\n\nYakiniQ has become my new standard in measuring Korean BBQ joints, and I highly advise any fans of Korrean BBQ to try it out. Especially if you're one of those who are used to those $10 dollar joints, the price maybe twice as much, but the quality and the service is well worth it.\nGood luck finding parking though.", "author": "Kevin F."}

All you can eat goes for $19.99 and you can supplement an additional $5.00 for the bulgogi and kalbi.  The food, meaning the meat, is pretty good.  Well marinated and fresh.  Stick with the pork belly (DELISH) and the kalbi.  The pork belly was chewy, but in a good way, and really lovely to the palate.  Everything else was decent but not really worth mentioning.\n\nMy biggest complaint was the service.  I get that the restaurant gets busy but I felt so neglected and forgotten.  Our group literally had to remind the servers two-four times EACH time we ordered a dish.  It really slowed down the momentum.  Then, by the time we ordered it again, the original server would finally show up with the dish, thus resulting in duplicate dishes.  A bit frustrating.  Nonetheless, a good experience.

Especially when the rice paper (I think it's rice paper...) comes out and you wrap your cooked meat with it!\n\nMy only complaint is the lack of proper ventilation. I love the smell of meat grilling on a hot plate, but towards the end of the meal when the All-You-Can-Eat turns from a challenge to a recovery from bloated and stuffed stomach, the smell of BBQ on your clothes doesn't help. \n\nEven so, I think YakiniQ is one of the best Korean BBQ places in the city that is extremely reasonable in cost!", "author": "Jeremy L."}

Definitely make a reservation if you have large party and eating dinner.\n\nI enjoy seeing some of my favorite K-pop idols on the television, however the songs they play don't go in sync with what is shown on the television...  But yeah music is a plus.\n\nIt's 19.99 per person and \"all you can eat\", you will see why I put it in quotations as you read on. But there is a special menu that just includes 3 more items and it costs about $23+. The concept of this place is to order meat and cook your own meal at your table grill. They will bring you condiments like bean sprouts, kimchi, potato salad, and a bowl of diced cabbage. \n\nAs for the meats, they have: Kalbi (one order per person), garlic butter chicken, spicy chicken, octopus, large intestine, small intestine, brisket, honeycomb tripe, pork belly ,and etc. \n\nI don't recommend the tripe since it's flavorless, the chickens will take a while to cook and the taste gets boring, brisket and pork belly are a good start since they cook fast, yes try the octopus since it's not everyday you can eat it, and try the intestines if you really want to try something new. Intestines are tough to eat but they don't taste bad. \n\nAs for service, it seems decent. Sometimes they will forget to bring your order and you'd have to push on the cool service button to alert them to your table. OOK now I will tell you why I quoted \"all you can eat\". My buddy, brother, and I were there for just a bit over an hour. Eventually the waitress came and told us that we have to make our last order because I guess we've been there for too long? I don't see them rush the people who got here way before us. So I deduct from service because they rushed us, yes there are people waiting to eat however, we paid for our food and we're still customers. They need to learn some courtesy.\n\nOverall it's not special, but just ok. Definitely not a place I'd eat at often, just maybe once a year or come back in a few years.

I was able to bring a cake earlier w/o an extra charge, and they helped me hide it from the birthday gal. \n\nWe had a table of 8, and got the $19.99 AYCE option, which includes:\nbeef brisket, \nbeef short ribs (kalbi) - 1 order per person,\nspicy chicken,\npork belly,\nmarinated pork belly, \nspicy baby octopus,\ntripe,\npork skin,\nbig intestines,\nsmall intestines,\ncabbage salad,\nsteamed egg,\nrice soup,\nrice paper wraps\n\nThe $23.99 (or $24.99) included beef tongue, bulgogi, and one other meat. The kalbi was everyone's favorite..marinated very well! There was only 5 different kinds of side dishes tho.....wish there was more! Lettuce was an extra $1.99, and a side of kimchi fried rice was $3.99. Soju cocktail was $11 a bottle. But this is the only restaurant that I know in SF that has the rice paper wraps like they do in so-cal! \n\nEven tho they were super busy (the whole place was packed..with people waiting) we were serviced very well! They changed out cooking plate a few times so it wouldn't be messy. The owner of the place came by numerous times to check to make sure we were satisfied as well. Best of all, he was able to take the cake out to surprise my friend with the cake we brought.\n\nI also did notice after the fact, that the sign on the outside says the birthday person was free (minimum 4 people).

We stumbled upon this place and decided to go in because for one, It was a cold November night & secondly, my boyfriend and I decided to eat at YakiniQ, put our name down & wait was at least going to be an hour, so we needed somewhere warm to stay for the next hour or so.  Its a very cute cafe  for the typical college student, very quite atmosphere with soft background music playing.  Spacious area but seating is limited of course, my boyfriend and I ended up sitting at the community table. \n\nWe got greeted right away by the friendly staff. There are also a bunch of yummy snacks, desserts and drinks that you can order from but we were saving our appetite for the Korean buffet (that we had to patiently wait for).  The awesome staff recommended the honey tea ($3-$4) which is by far, the best honey tea I have ever tasted!!

I love going to a KBBQ buffet because you can basically eat there for 2 hours and chat and drink and have a good time.\n\nAnyways, this place is located in Japantown so good luck finding parking.  My kbbq standard is extremely high simply because you can't fake meat quality. \n\n Their kalbi was no good.  The meat quality was no good plus their flavor is not sweet enough.  They have the 3-bones short ribs or the boneless ones, but both weren't very good at all.  Secondly, they didn't use the right cut of meat for their spicy pork.  I was extremely disappointed by then.  Pork belly and briskets were okay because it doesn't require marination.  Another bummer, they show a huge variety of meat choices, but half were \"out of order\" when I went.   \n\nSide dishes were minimal and lacks variety.  But they do give you unlimited refill on that steamed egg *I love steamed egg*.  \n\nIn the end, I could enjoy the briskets and pork belly.  Service was really good though.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-03", "description": "My friend Alice Z. and I came here after walking down Fillmore Street. She heard from a friend about an unlimited Korean BBQ place. At first we thought it was a buffet of some sort but we could not find the restaurant on Yelp for the longest time. We just started walking on Sutter towards Ichiban Kan since we planned to make a quick stop there. Half way from the doorway of the mall to Ichiban Kan, I spotted a white banner hanging that read grand opening special and be damned that that was the \"buffet\" we were tracking down. But first we made a stop at Ichiban Kan to browse snacks. \n\nThe menu is pretty straightforward. Peter L. covered the menu extensively, but if visuals is your thing check out the pictures I uploaded. There isn't anyone to greet you at the entrance but you have to go up the stairs and then you see the dining room. Sit in a booth where you get a good view of the servers because it can be hard to get their attention. The server we had was super friendly and welcoming. We didn't catch his name but he's in his 20's and speaks a bit of English. He went over how the unlimited BBQ works recommended we start out with three types of meats first to avoid wasting food. The small cold plates came out first though, along with a big pot of steamed egg. \nSee Alice's review about that. \n\nWe went with the beef briskets, beef short ribs, and spicy octopus for the first round. I like my meat medium rare so cooking the meat didn't take long. I didn't notice the time and forgot to flip the meats over and by then one side was already well done. Always designate one person to pay attention to the cooking (it gets tiring so switch off). The server was nice enough to do some of the cooking for us, which definitely helps us amateurs. But if you feel like a pro, just tell them you will cook it yourself. The spicy octopus wasn't spicy at all really but that's not so much a problem. The beef briskets were not that great, I've had way better. A lot of the pieces were more fat than edible meat and when overcooked, looks like burned bacon. The sizzling fat makes the appearance all the worse. The best part was the boneless short ribs. They were just the right bite size and were effortless to cook. However, if you're a flavor fanatic, I suggest you go with the marinated version. \n\nThe second \"refill\" round we opted for the spicy chicken, marinated beef boneless short ribs, and beef sirloin. The spicy chicken takes longer to cook but was delicious and just the right amount of spicy. The marinated short ribs are to die for!!! The beef sirloin is a red light. It's way too thick even though the pieces were small enough. Maybe it was just our luck. Don't forget, rice (in the silver bowls) is complimentary. I wish it was rice cooked in the claypots. We also opted for another round of steamed egg and the kimchi & rice soup. The soup was more like a starter, equivalent to Russian borscht. \n\nOn our third round we got one big intestine, beef brisket, and more marinated short ribs. Alice ate the big intestine with the salt & sesame dipping sauce included and she really liked it. But beware, limit your intestines because it's absolutely fattening. Then again, all Korean BBQ carries some form of integrated fat. Be careful cooking the intestine too because the sizzle sometimes \"explodes\" and hits your skin and it burns. In my case, my cheek, ouch! \n\nWe were pretty bloated by the end of round three. I was able to finish my rice with a lot of steamed egg, kimchi, and spicy dipping sauce. The water was able to wash down a lot of the flavor. We just sat there and enjoyed the atmosphere for a good half an hour or maybe even an hour. The music playing overhead is pretty upbeat and certainly modern. I heard Usher and a bunch of Korean pop groups I don't know since I don't follow Asian music. There's also a TV that plays Korean music videos and news but reading lips is hard, especially for someone a) not facing the TV; b) not knowing the language. The restrooms are accessed by the downward stairs to the right of the kitchen and to the left. It's small so go when there aren't many people needing to unload their 'business'. Don't forget to wash your hands thoroughly! I see this place as an up and coming late night crash spot since it's open until midnight on non-peak days and until 2am on Friday and the weekend. Go try for yourself while the promotion is still running. (They've been opened for three weeks now.)", "author": "Dominic T."}

All you can eat Korean barbecue, in fact.\n\nSo the 5 of us took advantage of a $50 off $100 coupon and decided to use it as a group. Given the fact that we ordered the $23.99 option, we knew we'd be paying a lot more than $50 total. We ordered a variety of dishes: the kalbi (of course), the bulgogi, the spicy baby octopus, the garlic chicken, the pork skin, pork belly and the beef tongue. All these were A-OK.\n\nThe highlight of the menu, however, is the rice wrapping. They charge you extra for the lettuce wraps but why would you go for lettuce wraps when you have the rice wrap? If you go for dim sum and you get the cheung fun, it is similar to that except you wrap delicious korean barbecue in it.\n\nI've got to give a shoutout to the shoju cocktails - while they did run out of the yogurt flavor (fail...) we got to sample the mango and the kiwi both of which were very very tasty. It was the alcohol that sent us over the edge in terms of pricing. \n\nMy biggest gripe: maybe I'm picky but the ventilation fans did not seem to be doing their job. While I expect to be smelling like Korean Barbecue when I go for Korean barbecue, I did not expect to be SMELLING as if I personally have been smoked on the barbecue.

You don't have many options at the $20/person and you have a limit of 1 plate KoreanBBQ Ribs per person. We had a party of 6 and we figured we'd get 1 plate every round. By the third round, they said we were done! They said each plate had 2 servings. They didn't explain that part to us before. \n\nThe waiter/waitress' took forever and we had to ask for them to replace our grill. \n\nLimited options, limited Korean BBQ, and not the best service.

And then if I want unlimited Bulgolgi, I have to put down an extra 5 dollars?  Grrrr...\n\nI came with one other person, and with our monstrous appetite, the little side dishes did not satiate our cravings.  Speaking of which, the side dishes are of average size and is minimal compare to the 'Korea town' in Oakland (Telegraph) where they flop out with like 20 little plates.  So with 5 side plates, it's not impressive at YakiniQ at all.  My friend and I were both insanely hungry, so YakiniQ didn't know what hit 'em when we came in and left 3 hours later.  That's not to say we didn't care for what we ate...I assure you--it was tasty, but it just *didn't* hit the spot (I know, I know, we tried substituting quality for quantity, and ended up consuming more and more in trying to fill that quality void to no avail).\n\nThe quality of the food is not too shabby at all.  It was definitely good to eat, but it didn't have anything new to bring to the table.  I feel that it's on par and met the expectation of a standard Korean BBQ restaurant that I can find in a lot of places.  It was average, and I want to say I'd dine in again, but because I really like kalbi and bulgolgi, then limiting the amounts of kalbi served or just letting me know that I have to pay more for the bulgolgi option is a bad marketing scheme.\n\nMaybe I'll invite more friends and trick everyone into family style so I can devour their kalbis when they're not looking, but most (if not all) of my friends believe kalbi to be one of the better meat served at any Korean BBQ joint and will most likely inhale it as quickly as I...so that plan is out...Hm, I guess that's why we're friends, right? ;)", "author": "Dararith L."}

I really didn't want to eat korean bbq just because I don't know, wasn't feeling it. But I promised my friend and he really really wanted to go so here we are.\n\nThe service this weekend was kind of slow and I didn't see the server that served us there! I was a little sad because he had really good customer service. Maybe it was busy tonight, almost full house, so the servers were kind of slow. But don't worry, there is the button that you can click for service. It was kind of scary at first, but later kept clicking that thing like there was no tomorrow!\n\nThe marinated beef short ribs are the best here! We had a total of 7 orders of the marinated short ribs! We also had spicy baby octopus, beef sirloin, pork belly, rice, hot pepper paste stew, spicy chicken, and steamed egg. I might of forgotten something. But the marinated beef short ribs are the bomb! But tonight it was kinda sliced too thin for my taste, but still yummy! \n\nThe side dishes were also yummy. Ate lots of kimchee, bean sprouts, seaweed, and potato salad. We stayed here for a good 3 hrs the last 45mins consisted of us just sitting there chatting and resting from sucha full meal!

There are service buttons to press when you need or want something, and staff are quick to be of service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-07", "description": "I'm no expert on Korean food, let alone Koran barbecue, so take this review for whatever it's worth. Came here the other week with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday - said birthday boy got to eat free, which was nice! - and it's really the first time I've EVER eaten at a place like this.\n\nFirst off, if you're concerned with the \"All You Can Eat\" rules, know that there are a few limitations:\n\n(A) everyone in your party pays the same price, so if someone wants something from the $23 menu EVERYONE has to pay the $23;\n(B) you can only order 3 items at a time, but the rounds are unlimited;\n(C) kalbi is limited to one per \"head\", so a party of nine only gets up to nine, no matter who eats them.\n\nIt's not clearly lined in the menu outside, but all of us wanted the bulgolgi so the $24 price was somewhat expected. Unfortunately, sides aren't included and cost extra. No big deal since they give you little side dishes (panchan?), rice, and threw in a few rounds of steamed egg.\n\nMost of the items we tried were alright. By far the most popular item among us was the bulgolgi and kalbi, which were awesome. Some of the other meats - both the garlic and spicy chicken, as well as the brisket - were disappointing though, and slightly lacking in taste.\n\nService was nice and quick in the beginning when there weren't too many other groups, but as the place started to fill up we repeatedly had to flag down the staff for water refills (there was never enough going around) and more rice. They probably need to utilize more than 2-3 waiters, as it got extremely busy on a Friday night.\n\nI did like the atmosphere of the place, as it matched the slightly high price in that there was a bit of an elegant design, with low lights and nice furniture. Sure, there's a metal grill in the middle of every table and it gets smokey as hell when it's busy, but it at least looks fancy.\n\nOverall, YakiniQ's a decent place to eat, even if you're unfamiliar with Korean food, though it is NOT a place for vegetarians/vegans, so if you're not a meat-lover you'll want to avoid a trip here at all costs. Otherwise, it makes a good place to kick back with a group and grill some meat.\n\nPS: Parking around Japantown is pretty messy unless you go for the parking lot a block down the street, so come early if possible.", "author": "Will C."}

As Korean BBQ goes, they pull out all the stops to make the experience delicious and the service attentive.\n\nI was particularly impressed by the selection of meats available. In my opinion, the short ribs and the beef intestine were the best, although the octopus was a highlight.\n\nThe side dishes are also worth noting. They have kimchi, a vegetable medley and korean mashed potatoes. A word from the service will tell you in an instant which side goes well with which meat or you can just freestyle it.\n\nIf you're out with friends you're not gonna be disappointed at this place. There's enough beer and Soju to float an oil tanker and enough good meat to satisfy even the hungriest stomach. \n\nIf this is what the restaurant looks like at 2 weeks old, I'll be coming back for more.", "author": "Jay C."}

I didn't like how we asked for water, and they didn't give us any till we asked for it the second time around, and then when they went to refill the water, they would forget to bring it back half the time. Not to mention they forgot our steamed egg. They were very nice however about refilling our salad and our ban chan. \n\nThere was also some confusing with the number of times we ordered the kalbi, it's 2 pieces per order per person. When we went to order our last order of the kalbi, they told us we already ordered over the limit, but we explained how the first server brought 2 pieces, then the next server brought 3, so we have not ordered our last piece of kalbi since we had 3 people. The server then went to discuss this with the guy in charge and they were debating and what not, and ended up giving us another 3 pieces. hehe. \n\nWas also kind of disappointed that you needed to have 4 people in order for the birthday person to receive a free meal. But we joked with the guy in charge how our friend has just turned 21 and it's his first time in San Francisco, and so he gave us a free bottle of soju.

Dont expect the complete best of service as this place is an absolute madhouse. Servers were running to and fro the entire night.

Be ready to walk out of their smelling like a kitchen staff with all the smoke and beef juice splattering all over you.  The steam egg was simple and surprisingly comforting...needed a bit of soy sauce though.\n\nFor extra 4 dollars you could have all you can eat bulgogi and beef tongue, which was worth it.  Stay away from the pork neck bone, it is basically strips of fat.  The unlimited side dishes was also a plus.  The service was friendly and efficient.

It was time for BBQ at YakiniQ again.\n\nI tried something new this time.  Spicy pork belly and spicy chicken.  Both items were very good.  It was spicy (mild) with a bit sweetness. The spicy meats were great with rice, lettuce wrap, and rice cake wrap.  There was a $1.99 charge for lettuce wrap but pork belly was great with lettuce wrap. \n\nWith a happy and full stomach, I declared \"BBQ pork belly craving satisfied\".", "author": "Wei C."}

When I was about to get seated I asked for a booth and the waiter said they're trying to close the booths, then later as more customers came they were seated at the booth. We ordered bulgogi and they gave us galbi instead and would not take it back (they charge you extra if you don't finish your meat). 20 minutes later a waiter comes with the correct order and proceeds to pour the WHOLE plate of meat onto the grill and takes the plate back. At this point we were just tired and done with their service. Would never come back here ever again.

There are two menus, one for $19.99 and the other for $23.99. Both are AYCE, but the $23.99 includes the $19.99 meats  + bulgogi (marinated beef), beef tongue and pork neck meat. Since I've been spoiled with great AYCE KBBQ places in LA, I thought the prices were actually a little on the pricier side of the spectrum. But, considering the lack of AYCE joints here in SF, the quality of feed was pretty good.\n\nPros:\n- Quality of meat was good - not too fatty\n- Service was excellent. The staff was very attentive and changed our grill frequently.\n- Atmosphere was great - it wasn't too loud and but it also wasn't so quiet where you would feel guilty if you were speaking too loudly.\n- The galbi and bulgogi were marinated SO WELL!\n\nCons:\n- You leave with your hair and clothes smelling like meat (it's a con for all kbbq places unfortunately)\n- The bulgogi was on the $23.99 menu (along with two other items, I normally never order)\n- Parking!!!!!!

The dirty hall area and bathrooms could use some renovation too but they fail to make those improvements.  The most disappointing is the food.....$19.99 is a very affordable price but I feel like the selection was lacking!  It's not really considered AYCE if you restrict only one slice of Galbi meat per person.  I was expecting at least one dish but one slice is ridiculous!  I also I don't like that they don't marinate their meats at all and did not provide any kind vegetables for the grill.  The beef brisket was the only item we ordered the most because it goes well with their chili sauce and it cooks fast.  The rice soup is literally bland brown rice water.

For an AYCE kbbq place, this is probably the go to destination if you want to satisfy the kbbq craving within.  Since all the grills are about the same size, it's best to go sit in the booths that can hold up to 5 or 6 people?  That way you can order as much as you can and actually have enough to eat instead of sitting in a table of 7 or 8 people eating one piece of meat each round. lol. The downside is that you can only order one galbi (short ribs) per person in the table (e.g. 4 people, 4 orders of galbi).

It was an ALL YOU CAN EAT, so I figured that there would be a cap and it would be much more reasonable that the bill from Benihana.\n\nWe were so happy that they took us without reservations but they put us in 2 separate tables next to each other which kind of did ruin the family gathering a bit. It was impossible to talk to someone at the other end of the separated table. The people that sat at the ends had their backs to the other table the entire meal. It did not make sense that they seated us like that because the large table across from us was empty. She said it was reserved. OK?? but as the night wore on, it was separate parties of 2, 3, 3, that filled that table... What's up with THAT? OK.. after all the reviews of no tables with or without reservations; we had sat down gratefully without pressing the issue. We were confused by the $19.99 and $23.99. Apparently, whatever you decide on, EVERYONE on your table must also order the same price. So, we went for the $23.99... but only one serving of Kalbi each??? To avoid waste, they only bring 3 orders at a time. Then ring the bell. I was squeezed in with the 7 heavy duty carnivores. It was awkward ringing the bell again and again. Since there were so many of us piled around the table, you would think they could bend the rules a bit at least in the beginning of the meal. My sister supervising the other table did not understand that they could keep ringing the bell and everyone ate sparingly at an \"all you can eat\"??? I was too busy cooking and trying to get my fill at my table to notice that they didn't know what they were doing... Yeah, they speak and read English. Two of them had doctorates at that table....

Usually you see people hustling, not here! They take their sweet little time.\n\nThe banh chans were not good. The kim chi looked old and very unappealing. The only one that I liked out of all them was the mash potato like one and the seaweed. The rest, they could have just taken away.\n\nThe kalbi marinade was a bit too sweet to my liking. Even my other friends thought it was too sweet. The spicy chicken mix wasn't that good either. It was alright but all their marinades seemed too sweet.  We got the beef brisket and I thought you can't usually go wrong with beef brisket... apparently you can. The brisket was a bit rough and chewy to my liking. Even dipping it in their sauce didn't help much with the flavor. Got the octopus, nothing special about it either. We tried the beef tongue because one of my friends said it was good... it WAS NOT. The tongue had this weird taste to it and it was chewy. I swear I was chewing on that sucker for 5 minutes. In the end, my jaw got tired and I just swallowed it.  Tried the garlic chicken and that was okay out of all the marinaded meat.  We tried both versions of the pork belly and it was alright. It was either lacking in flavor or just not that good. The cut is also a bit thick as well compared to other places that serve pork belly. \n\nService was a bit slow as well. Rang the bell multiple times and still nobody showed up sometimes. It also really does get smokey in there after a while... my eyes started to burn near the end of the meal because of all the smoke. I've been to korean bbq places before and I never smelled as bad as that place... it was so bad that my cell phone smelled like bbq the next day! It's cheap and I guess one of the only all you can eat korean bbq places in SF... but I don't think I would be coming back since the marinade either was way too sweet, not good, or the meat was just chewy or rough to eat.

Another re-order for us), and salad (unfortunately it was really oily with no flavor...sad...)\n\nWe did a double re-order for the brisket (okay), marianted short ribs (this was so underwhelming, it needed more days of marination instead of minutes..cause I couldn't really taste anything), pork belly (mmm...bacon flavah...and super fatty), and spicy chicken (THIS was the only flavorful meat selection we ate). I would have done spicy octopus but our group was protein-ed out.\n\nService was spotty and I think it's cause they were short-handed and it was a full house on a Saturday night.

Maybe I've been spoiled with the good all you can eat Korean bbq places in the East Bay. But I've paid the same price or less and have gotten a lot more variety of food. If you get the $20 one, it has the usual korean bbq such as galbi (limit 1 order per person at the table), intestines, chicken, etc., but you don't get the bul go gi unless you pay for the $23 one. There are the typical side dishes (around 5 or 6 only) and steamed egg. They don't charge for rice but lettuce wraps are extra and so is the tofu soup. Their salad was really good though - I loved the dressing. Service was kind of slow cause it was Saturday night and they were busy so it took a while to get refills.

I had a group of four and me and my bf got there first, so while we waited for the other half of our group, we started eating the kimchi they gave us (which happened to be the best thing we ate that night). So we finished the kimchi and asked for \"another bowl of kimchi\" the waiter looked at us as if we said something outrageous then said \"ok\" and came back with an empty bowl... O_o so we told him again... And he gave us more kimchi. Our friends came and he gave them about 2 seconds to decide what they want. They got short ribs we got the brisket. The brisket wasn't seasoned and it was rubbery. It took forever to finish it. The short ribs were good. They were marinaded and nice and sweet. My friends ordered one mango soju and the waiter brought them a mango and a strawberry even though they didn't order it. When they sent it back they kept looking at us like it was our faults. So we finally finished round one and then I ordered the pork skin, thinking it was gonna be like a chichiron type of thing but no... It was one curly piece of gelatinous mess. It took forever to cook. My friend ordered the garlic chicken. It didn't look to appealing, and they didn't finish it either. I then ordered the pork belly, not only did it cause flames to shoot up and nearly burned my hand off it had no flavor and I ended up not finishing the two pieces they provided. After we told the waiter we were done we sat there a while waiting for the check. We had to ring for them to return and asked for the check. While waiting I started feeling really sick and my lip started swelling up a bit. Needless to say, once I got home... I wasted $19.99. I don't think I will ever be back which is sad because I work in Japantown. \n\nThe two stars are only for the bargain of the all you can eat $19.99.

But during a recent visit about 3 days ago, the service was downright horrible. After being seated we got our first order just fine. When it came time for the second order, the waiter took so long that the grill started burning off the oil. He also left us unattended and another waiter had to come and ask us again for what we ordered. During our third order of meat, as the waiter was changing out our grill, we requested a fourth order and the waiter bluntly tells us to \"hold on, one thing at a time.\" How hard is it to change out a grill and take one order? Anyways, when we were about done with our fourth order, one of the waiters comes up to us and tells us that we had one last call for an order of meat. How are you gonna advertise all you can eat and then tell the customer that they've eaten enough?! So I kindly asked him why it was last order already and the waiter tells us that there is a 2 hr limit to eat. The problem was that we'd only been eating for 50 minutes. Not even an hr into our dining experience, everything went sour. I feel like they just try to rush people out of there so they can seat more customers in order to maximize profit. So as a customer, I just want to warn those who've never been to yakini Q that this may happen to you as well. Cheers and I hope this review helps out.", "author": "James Y."}

As a result, there will be no preamble to this review, just a concurrence with Simon K.\n\nMy good  (translate that) Simon planned a grand fiesta that would assemble factions of warring parties to discuss bid'ness at YakiniQ.  A forewarning is that parking is quite hard around this area (Japantown), especially around dinner.  Another warning is that there is another restaurant called YakiniQ inside the Japantown mall that is Japanese food.  Having no idea, I had a back in forth exchange that went something like this:\nMe: Party of 14 under Simon\nHostess: No, there is no name for Simon\nMe: No, please look again...Simon, S-I-M-O-N (I ignorantly spelled it out)\nHostess: No...we don't take reservations here\nMe: *stammering* o...is this korean bbq by any chance\nHostess: No\nMe: humblest apologies....(somehow put the blame on lil twist even though he was not there)\n\nFinally making our way to the correct YakiniQ with 80% of our party in tow, the manager said that we would not be seated if our party was not whole and that our reservations would be given.  I believe SImon K. wanted to chide him but the logic was that 14 people for AYCE = instant profit.  I don't know where his senses went but they returned to him and he quickly retracted his statement and ushered us to the table.  From there, we were given a quick rundown of the rules aka 20 LIMITED AYCE, extra 4 bucks for the TOTAL AYCE and also, how to press the button to call for service.  It is a complex concept where one points their index finger and jabs a raised circular growth from the table.  The waiter explained that the $20 AYCE meats, WHICH DIDN'T EVEN INCLUDE BULGOGI.  You have to upgrade to the $24 where you can choose from no longer a 3 meat menu but a rather long list of meats that go from ordinary to exotic like tongue, intestines, etc.  They delayed giving us food until are whole party was there until we insisted that we wanted food first.  They slowly gave us our ban chan.  The salad was watevs, the mashed potatoes was weird however, the egg soup thing was decent.  The meat came out very slowly; they have a rule of an order of galbi per person, but due to there being so many of us, totally skimped us.\n\nThe reason I give this place 2 stars is their service.  While they are very nice and listen politely as you request more rice or more meat, it goes in one ear and out the other.  Yah you look cool with your headsets, but the ear piece is blocking vital information from becoming a synapse of information to your brain.  We waited 30 minutes between platters of dish and another 10 minutes for a refill of rice.  We would jam the button much like our thumbs did playing marvel v. capcom during our glory high school days, however, instead of a thumb callus, we'd get index finger callus.  I know they heard us, but was probably directed by their overseer to ignore us.  \"Tis is the code of most AYCE.  Every platter they brought was scarfed down in a matter of minutes and soon, my friend's forearm was looking mighty edible.  However, he is a member of the wolfpack and I could not commit fraternal cannibalism.  The meat itself was pretty low quality.  I felt that it had not been marinated well and the cursory glaze was given right before it was delivered to our table.  They gave us like 12 pieces per plate and skimped on the portions, knowing full well they would not be back for another half hour.  \n\nYakiniQ abides by the ancient laws of AYCA in which food is replenished as slow as possible.  While the price was relatively cheap despite a $4 tack to get some actual Korean meat, I will never frequent this place again.  There is no point to go to a restaurant to starve...imagine a platter of meat given, cooked and a party of 3 or 4 mouths plucking 3 pieces each and not given a refill for another hour.  If you do go here, I suggest you go with a small party so that you can have more pieces to yourself.  In essence tho, screw this place.", "author": "Brian V."}

He told us it will most definitely be less than an hour. We end up waiting an hour and a half until I finally go back and ask how many more parties are ahead of us. He ignores me COMPLETELY and walks away. I check back in at 5 minutes and the owner finally points down at the list and says \"these many people are ahead of you\" I look at the and I see random names crossed off not in order.

So eat your heart out guys! \n\nWe read that the line is usually long and the place is packed even late on week nights, but when we got there at 6:30PM on a Wednesday night, the place was calm and we were seated right away. Sweet! \n\nWe decided to do the AYCE for $19.99 per person. Since each time we could only pick 3 items on the AYCE menu, we went with some pork belly, briskets and Korean marinated short ribs (galbi) to start and for our second round, we had spicy baby octopus, pork intestine and more briskets. The pork belly when it's cooked well done, it's crispy like bacon, now who wouldn't like that? The pork intestine cooked over the flame takes a little longer, but when it's done, they turned crunchy and really good. By the time we reached round 3, we opted for more baby octopus and some beef honeycomb tripes.  \n\nAll the meats were good, fresh and the short ribs were nicely marinated with Korean spices. Our meal also come with unlimited refill of Korean side dishes like kim chee, saut\u00e9ed vermicelli noodles, rice cake wrappers, bean sprouts, seaweed and steamed egg that comes in a small black hot pot. Oddly enough they also gave us some cabbage cold slaw and mashed potatoes, which aren't really Korean, but who cares, they were good. We got 2 kinds of dipping sauces, one is a salty clear sauce and the other a homemade spicy chili sauce, which I think is better, but be aware, our server told us the spicy chili sauce contains peanuts so if you have an allergy against peanuts, you might want to shy away from that. We also asked for sliced garlic and jalapenos to go with our meat. By far, the pork belly and spicy baby octopus were my favorites. The other meat items we didn't try were the spicy pork belly, butter garlic chicken or spicy chicken because my gal pal told me she had those before and they were salty. \n\nYakiniq is a casual Korean style BBQ place where you come to socialize while you wait for your meat to cook over the fire at your table. Yes, for once, you have to pay to cook your own food, but if you haven't experience such dining method, you ought to give it a try. It's a lot of fun. They also serve all kinds of Korean shochu (rice wine) and beers. We like everything there and as you can see we had multiple helpings of most of the things on the menu and there were only 2 of us girls. I left Yakiniq with a full stomach, didn't break the bank for this meal and went home happy and smelling like BBQ from head to toe so that I can use the BBQ aroma to make my man jealous when I give them a big hug upon walking into the house. Alright, I will take him there next time around, if he behaves.", "author": "Gourmet Princessa L."}

Pay like 4 bucks more for some added meat (like three or four extra kinds of meat) in which I thought was not worth it but that is just me. The limit on three plates at a time is kind of a set back but expected. However, portions are very small  so one star off for that and it sometimes take the servers a while to get to you because they are too busy and seem quite short handed when their busy so one star off for that. Parking can be quite difficult at times so you can always park at the japan town garage. Overall a good place to goto if your in need of meat but don't expect quick service.

When restaurants.com recently had a 80% off promotion and YakiniQ was on the list, I purchased a $25 GC and figured I would give it a try sometimes.\n\nI ended up taking a couple friends there for a birthday thing on a Thursday night. I called them the day of for a reservation and unfortunately they wouldn't take reservation unless it was for parties of eight or more. We got there at 8pm and the place was just about half full. We were seated promptly. When I took out my restaurants.com GC, the waitress who barely spoke any English said they didn't accept it anymore. Not entirely understanding what she was saying, I asked for the manager. I could see the waitress was whispering something to the manager while covering their faces with the big serving tray. Then the manager basically gave me the crap about how they no longer had an account with restaurants.com and they wouldn't honor it. At this point I was a bit annoyed and quite frankly didn't really care for his lame explanation. Anyhow he eventually accepted the GC and we finally ordered.\n\nThe quality of the meat was quite good. The best things we had were the kal-bi, beef tongue, pork belly, and spicy pork belly. I didn't care for the bulgogi and don't ever order the pork skin. It was just chewy and not flavorful at all. The service was actually really good and attentive after we got the whole GC mess out of the way. They changed the grill often and were always refilling our water.\n\nI will definitely come back here again even without the GC. Although this is still not on the same level with LA's korean bbq, this is probably as close as it gets without trekking all the way to Outer Richmond.", "author": "Winnie A."}

I came a long ways because I heard this place was good and I was craving Korean bbq. I was with my girlfriends having a nice night out before they left and just wanted to have a fun dinner. First the wait was 2 HOURS. The guy said it would be an hour and was very rude about it. We waited and waited and started to get mad because we were hungry at 7 and finally ate at 9. When seated we ordered and the waiter was rude and demanding. The food was so so, it only tasted good because we were starved. Once we were done we tried to pay separate tabs and they wouldn't let us. One waiter was very rude and talked to my friends and I like we were stupid and illiterate. I demanded to speak with a manager and he said he was the manager? If he was the manager why was he serving us? Then I said okay well this is my concern and he LAUGHED in my face and WALKED AWAY to HELP OTHER CUSTOMERS. Customer satisfaction is key and if they can't give that then they need to be put out of business. I asked another waiter if that guy was the manager and he said no. So the other \"manager\" LIED to my face. I walked up to the cash register to pay so we could finally leave and I asked for the manager and I spoke with a man who claimed he owned the place. I told him my concerns and also pointed out the earlier gentleman asking if he was the manager and the owner said no. Then I said that he claimed to be the manager and the OWNER LIED to my face as well. THEY DO NOT OFFER GOOD SERVICE WITH A BAD SYSTEM AND NOT VERY GOOD FOOD WITH LYING POORLY TRAINED STAFF.

At the same time, I expect decent service worth the 18%.\n\nI came here with four friends (making the party five) and we were immediately seated. Given that we were seated, I immediately thought that our server was going to be annoying (in a good way) by constantly checking on us. That thought would fade six minutes later when we finally get asked our drink orders. We asked for five waters and a pitcher of beer. A few minutes later, our beer pitcher (which was actually a 1.5 L bottle) came but it wasn't the right beer. The serve apologized and said he would return with the right one. A few minutes later, he came back with the waters and took our order. My friend asked if the beer was coming and the server forgot about it and said he would be back with it. Long story short about the beer, it finally arrived as we were midway through eating. I really don't understand why it took so long for it. I understand the place is busy but if you say three times you will be back with it and always return without it, something is definitely wrong.\n\nMoving on to the food, the portions were very small. Again it is understandable since we did order all you can eat. However, when there are five people and you only bring three piece of each meat ordered, how is it fair for the other two people that have to wait the next round to try what they missed out? Not to mention that they only gave very little banchans (side dishes) that was barely enough for two people. With a party of five, they could've at least done two rounds so we could portion it better as opposed to one person eating the fish cake and the other eating the tiny green onion piece.\n\nLooking over the experience the five of us had, none of us were too pleased especially given how much we had spent for very little food that I grade a C. The fact that my party had to pay an 18% gratuity for everything we went through doesn't balance out whatsoever especially since we only had FIVE people. I didn't bother with disputing this with the manager since I would probably have to wait 30 more minutes.\n\nAs an out-of-towner, I suggest others like me find another spot for Korean BBQ since San Francisco is a big city with more restaurants that have potential.", "author": "Daniel K."}

After reading numerous Yelp reviews, I do agree and disagree with many. \n\nPros: Food is delicious! The food and experience of barbecuing it with friends was fun (if you're new to it, or totally lost like we were, the waiters can help!). For $20 you actually get quite a bit of food. Even though there is a \"limit\" on the short-ribs, each order of it (1 order per person?), is at least 4-5 pieces. Although the short-ribs are limited, my party couldn't even finish all our orders, because we ate a variety of other foods. The rest of the food is unlimited. Service: pretty friendly, some of the waiters don't speak English as well, and there may be communication errors, but it really isn't a big deal.  Also, I don't know why you would need to \"flag\" servers down as other reveiws say. Each table has a button that you may press to call for service.\n\nCons: You can only order 3 different foods at a time, must finish all the orders first before ordering another 3. The dilemma my friends and I ended up in, was ordering something that was totally disgusting (pork skin, if you care about your blood vessels...don't order this), and not being able to finish it. \n-It's Korean bbq, so you're going to smell really bad and there really isn't any AC or anything so with 15ish bbq's going on at each table, the whole place gets really smoky. \n-After about 3 rounds of orders, our proportions of each order started to shrink! We had about 5 pieces for 2 orders of short ribs and on our 3rd, they gave us 3, and compensated it by giving us a bunch of egg soup and chicken instead. When water was refilled, it was only refilled halfway and we were asked 3-4 times if we were done. \n\nOther: -The side dishes they provide are also part of the all you can eat, and you may request more.\n-For 3 more dollars you get 3 more kinds of food. \n-If you arrive at like 6-7ish, you probably won't have to wait.\n-For parties 6 or more 18% gratuity is added to the total.\n\n\nRecommendation: Short-Ribs! Spicy Chicken, garlic chicken, beef brisket, steamed egg, octopus \n\nThings I will not order again: Honeycomb tripe and pork skin.\n\nOverall: pretty good experience! had lots of fun and would very much like to go back!

They don't seem to know how to accomodate 15 people. The food was fine, but the service really, really needed to be worked on. If it's an all you can eat place, having to order off a menu at 3 items at a time was ridiculous. We had to get the attention of the staff numerous times just to get an order in. We had to ask to get our food, like we were getting permission to do so. \n\nThen the napkins...oh, man, the napkins. Previously you could only find quality like this at only the finest lowlife cafertaria you can find in the city until now. How cheap could they get. Since you need to use your hands quite a bit to eat you'll be requiring an entire package of 100 in just one sitting. Did I mention we had to keep asking for the waiters and waitresses to give us a few flimsy napkins? \n\nThen there was the music. The music was so loud we couldn't hear ourselves talk. Four of us had to ask the waitress/waiters at different times to turn the music down. Speaking of music they couldn't figure out if they wanted to cater to the 20 year olds that weren't present or the older set. Either way, it was far too loud for a restaurant.

Asking for water and asking for refills.\n\nAgain, overall, the food was decent.

Not a pleasant experience and my son wasn't happy that we went there. If you don't mind waiting for the staff to acknowledge you and don't mind asking for everything that should come automatically, then definitely check this place out. \n\nOverall, we'll never go there again.\n\n++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\nUpdate: 5-30-12\nI haven't been there since this last time, but my parents and other family members have and they absolutely love the place now.

We use to drive to Sunnyvale to Palace BBQ but the long drive got tired quick. A friend told me about YakiniQ and so glad I took his advice. After reading all the yelp reviews, I decided to call ahead for resos and ask about the kids menu. Fyi - they only take resos for a party of 8 and over, and kids are charged $9.99. We got there at 5pm and already noticed a line outside. Glad we got there early! They opened the doors and seated us right away. We opted for the $23.99 (each for adults) all you can eat since that menu offered the Bul-go-gi. It did not disappoint. My kids loved it too! Service was excellent. They have this little bell that you ring if you need anything. It felt awkard ringing it but since the other customers weren't shy about it, we tried not to be either.  Your clothes get really smelly due to all that smoke, so thank goodness our next destination was home. They also have flatscreens that play Korean pop videos and that kept my 3 year old entertained.

The only other all you can eat korean bbq place I've been is Oz, in Sacramento, but YakiniQ doesn't quite come up to par.  I was really excited to try it, but if you're not too adventurous, it may not be the best idea.  My absolute favorite is the bulgogi, and the kalbi short ribs.  The sides are good too, but nothing AMAZING to me.  The bulgogi is put on the more expensive menu of course.  I'm definitely a fan, but think it could be better.  I was quite dissapointed with their garlic and butter chicken, when I tried it, it came out still a bit frozen inside, and was a whole piece, not cut into strips or anything.  The waiting staff is a bit different than most restaurants.  There are little buttons at each table that you use to call the waiters over.  The button makes your table number appear on a box and that's when they'll come.  Since the restaurant is a decent size, and there's only so many waiters working all the tables, it gets a bit frustrating when you want a refill of water, or more meat during their busy hours.\n\nI go to school in Stockton, so when I have the chance, I would rather drive to Sacramento for Oz, rather than wait to come back to the city to have YakiniQ, plus Oz is cheaper!", "author": "Michelle L."}

I happen to be eating beef jerky all thruout my outing upward and MAN I had a mean craving for some Korean BBQ.  Shooting down a few pegs & intersecting convos, finally it was time to go eat.  We entered into the Little Tokyo section of SF (pretty small community).  YakiniQ was happily a Korean bbq joint with drunk-ass Koreans/Asians everywhere.  All sweet and cordial, we sat down with a super-cute waitress and ordered the AYCE Korean bbq plate.  The restaurant spot was very spacious and open.  Providing a nice booth for our party, we snuggled in with the warm stove in the midst.   Their salad and \"ban'chan\" were offered promptly.   Service was quick and staff were friendly.  Salad was not good in my opinion.. ill take \"pa'muchim\" any given day if they had it.   Only ban'chan Ill talk about is their bean sprouts, and mac salad (both not bad).   Everything else needed some Korean grandma to lock in and make it better. Their kimchi was not good... I was only capable of eating it via grilling it on the grill (which made it o-so-good ;)\n3 soju bottles and 3 pitchers later, we were quite stuffed with beef briskets, short ribs, octopus, and my favorite pork belly!!   Their meats were delicious especially the short ribs.   As for the pork.. mm'Hmmm baconized to my liking.   Octopus was a surprising element that made my soju go down like it was water from the fountain of youth.    We finalized with some Kimchi-jigae (get the doenjang-jigae instead), steamed egg, and rice porridge.

We chose not to opt for the extra bulgogi at 23.99 because the other two options that came with it didn't sound very appetizing (tongue and intestines). We were happy with the 19.99 meal but did not realize only 1 order of the gal-bi per person was all we could have of it. The gal-bi is not all you can eat, but everything else is. I guess that makes sense since that is probably the only dish everyone would order. The gal-bi was marinated very well. Juicy, soft, just the right amount of sweetness. The sides are also all you can eat. We also didn't realize the buzzer right below the menus on the wall until half way through our meal which didn't really matter because the servers are very attentive and were walking around to check on tables constantly, which I really really appreciated (Especially at a place where you need constant service because you are constantly ordering food).

Perhaps we came on a good and not so busy day but the service really made the meal, not to mention the oh so yummy food.  The kalbi was among the best I've ever had, and being from Hawaii, I know my kalbi!  All of the food was excellent and the sauces were to die for!  Next to the kalbi was the beef tongue.  I've actually had it before and I wasn't a fan but here, OMG!  It's a good thing it was unlimited!  I must say that was the best service I've had in all of California.  We will definitely be back and recommend it to everyone!  PS, the soju was a great pairing!", "author": "Yoshi Y."}

However, it was requested for four people when I became it at the time of accounts. Streamed down what I confirmed on the telephone before going, and we talked with the which was an owner, but I said and insisted on it ing charge normal with the no charge when I did not say. Even if there is difference in words between absoluteness, I am too too terrible. Will not a girl of 6 years old be unreasonable with the rate setting same as an adult? A manner to say when there is not today does not understand us while declaring that it is eaten 13 kinds of roasted meat in the shop. Without forgetting that I say when it is the worst shop where you should be careful about enough to going people from now on in families. Finally former Korean House was much more delicious. It is the  worst shop.", "author": "Kz Y."}

Was expecting buffet style was surprised to find they actually bring you your meats and cook it for you.  My first time drinking So Ju.  Stuff hits you quick!  Pretty tipsy and extremely full on the way out.  Word of advice avoid the pig skin, very oily and tend to pop while cooking.  My wife got snipped by a popping skin.  Service was friendly not stellar not bad for $20 a person.  FYI you can only order spare ribs once.", "author": "Steve L."}

I liked the way they marinated the chicken but I didn't like the chicken itself because it tasted kinda mushy or something . The spicy pork belly was pretty yummy . The gal-bi was my favorite . It was super yummy . Too bad they limit the gal-bi to one order per person ... that was rather heartbreaking . The spicy octopus wasn't even spicy and failed to impress me . The rice cake wrap was no good ... it tasted hard and kinda stale . The honeycomb tribe was no good either ... it lacked flavor . I came here with my friend and I found it kind of dumb and annoying that you can only place two orders at a time . I kinda wish they cooked everything for you because I'm lazy . But anyways , be sure to cook everything thoroughly or else you might end up with a stomache like my friend . Also be sure not to burn your food ! This place is usually pretty busy but I like the ambience here ... it's great for groups . Will probably be back again sometime .", "author": "Eileen L."}

Anywho I have been looking for an ayce thats as good as cham sut gol in socal or better, so far no luck. My friend's friend was having a gettogether of about 15 people. They have two different AYCE selections. One is 19.99 and the other is 23.99 which gives you 3 more selections of meat. I mean the food was decent, but not what I expected. They didn't have wasabi radish wraps, which made me sad bc that is my favorite thing to eat with the meat. I did try some baby octopus which was interesting. The service was okay, but the restaurant was pretty busy. One guy was really attentive, which was nice since we would ask one of the girls and they would forget about us. Oh and it is really smoky in there so bring an extra change of clothes and air tight bag for your smoky clothes. Overall I would rather just go to Wooden Charcoal Korean BBQ even though its not AYCE.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-28", "description": "Get here on the early side if you want to be seated - when we left there were over 20 people waiting in line! The food was awesome - we opted for the $25 AYCE, which came with beef tongue, bulgogi, and one other dish, but we ended up eating mostly off of the $19 menu, so i will likely go with that one in the future. Loved their mashed potato side salad - it was the perfect balance of sweet and savory! The coleslaw, Kimchee, sprouts, vermicelli and seaweed salad were solid sides as well, and they refilled everything on request. We loved the marinades they used on their meats - definitely some of the best I've tasted at a Korean BBQ restaurant to this day. Some standout meats included the fire squid, which we all raved about, the bulgogi, and the galbi, and the pork skin. The \"prime\" beef tongue was so chewy that it was literally inedible, but I'm not Korean so I might need to get used to what is an acquired texture. Pitchers of beers washed the BBQ down fast. Unlike the other meats we were served, the pork belly wasn't marinated so I found it to be flavorless and boring - which is a departure from my usual passion for this cut. Overall solid place, and remember to arrive early if you want to avoid a long wait!", "author": "julia k."}

So I thought for 20$, it was a good price for unlimited bbq, but to our dissapointment, they changed the way the business is run. We were limited to how many times we can order our food. They said you were limited to either how many times you can order food by how many people you have. So since we have 7 person per table, each table were only able to order 7 times. They were quick and fast at first helping us change grills as it turned black, and eventually, they told us we were limited to how many times we are able to order more meat and the time limit was 2hr, which ever hits first. In the end, they just threw us a check in a rough manner as a way to tell us pay now and get out. They didn't even bother changing our grill when it's pure black while we still have like 3 plates of meat to cook. Their waiters seem to be impatient when listening to what meat we want to order. The order is rather small and it seem to be no longer unlimited bbq. I'm a fairly skinny guy and don't usually eat alot, but after that dinner, I was still hungry. Usually I don't do food reviews, but this restaurant have really ruined my friend's birthday party with the way they run their business. I will definitely not be going back to this restaurant.", "author": "Jun L."}

Was it worth the extra $4? Not really.\nBulgogi was delicious, but I can live without it. The beef tongue on\nthe other hand... wasn't the best I've ever had.  The first order was\ndecent, but the second order was quite chewy and was not the \nbest cuts of tongue I've ever had.  Another item on the 23.99 menu was pork neck, that was pretty good too, slightly less fattier version of pork belly.  But it wasn't flavored and seriously, you can just get a plain pork belly instead and probably taste the same.\nI thought Kalbi, spicy pork belly and beef brisket were pretty good.  I tried intestine and large intestine, best to avoid them.  They weren't prepared right and the whole thing was really chewy and just stinky.  Kind of annoyed that the lettuce was extra (though it was like $3 or something).\nJapantown Korean restaurants are expensive, and this place is definitely a good alternative if you are hungry and don't want to spend a lot of money on eating out.", "author": "Mary T."}

My friends and I ordered all-you-can-eat BBQ for $19.95 which included 15 different types of meat. Because it was a second day after opening, everything seemed to be settled down. The wait staff was friendly and nice. The orders came out on time without missing any meats that we selected. The quality of meat was excellent. They were all fresh and delicious. I also loved the side dishes served with meal such as steam egg in a small stone pot and the hot bean paste stew. The day we went, Kimchi was served which was so delicious. Chili and garlic were also served by request. \nWe also had Korean rice wine called Mokguli which enhanced the flavor of meats twice. \nOverall, Food and atmosphere of restaurant were awesome. I strongly recommend this place if you are looking for a decent place to enjoy Korean BBQ and drinks with friends or family.", "author": "Carol H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-05-17", "description": "Let me start by saying that the people who work here are a bunch of jerks, especially the manager Bruce. This is by far the rudest bunch of people I have come across in my years of living in San Francisco. If it were not for my Korean friend who loves obviously loves Korean BBQ and her last day in SF before she went back to Korea, I would not have gone here.  I just had a root canal and a cavity filling and could not chew any kind of meat. Note: I had checked out the menu before I went, and seeing that they had a side of fried rice and soups, I was fine going there to have my friend enjoy her last BBQ in the city. We were seated and I asked for a order of a SIDE of fried rice. The server had the nerve to demand I pay $10 for it instead of its listed menu price of $4.99 since I was unable to get the All You Can Eat.  Nowhere in the menu did it say that I have to pay double the money for a SIDE dish if I cannot get the All You Can Eat. I asked to speak to the manager.  The manger, Bruce was even more rude and disrespectful than the server. I calmly pointed out to him that this change of price is nowhere mentioned in the menu and I should not be charged $10 for a side of fried rice. The manager arrogantly asked me why I had not called in before coming in to ask the price of a side dish! Was I hearing this right...thought to myself, this is guy is a F****K'N A$$ and looks like a clown might I add!!! He did not once apologize to me for charging me double the price or trying to explain to me the reason for this insaneness. Refusing to succumb to the helplessness of ordering a mere side dish for a price that was demanded by them at the last minute, I did not eat a morsel and the staff and manager cared less that they had a hungry customer in a restaurant full of food! I came here with 7 other friends...I mean weren't they robbing my friends enough that he could not let me order a side dish for the price listed on the menu! Not wanting to spoil their dinner I painstakingly waited for my friends for more than an hour to finish eating what they called MEDIOCRE and UNSATISFACTORY KOREAN BBQ!  In addition, the restaurant had no problem adding 18% gratuity to our bill.  For a mere side dish he lost a valuable customer who would have bought their business repeated customers, instead the manger chose $$$$ over pleasing someone who pointed out the facts about the shitty limited menu and unfair on the spot price changes. For me it was NOT A MERE $10, as it was for the fact that I would never support a business who chooses money over satisfying its' own customers. I highly recommend trying other Korean BBQ places in San Francisco who offer way better quality of food with fair prices and definitely value their customers, rather than settling for a less than satisfying Korean BBQ and feeding these money hungry leeches with no respect for their customers. My Korean friend was embarrassed by the Manager and Staff's  (who were all Korean) attitude. None of my friends who came here tonight including me will ever go back to this place! Horrible food and service period!", "author": "Ferhen M."}
