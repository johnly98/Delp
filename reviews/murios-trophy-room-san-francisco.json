Luckily, I found Murio's. And in this fine establishment, my World Cup experience this past month was everything I had imagined.\n\nMurio's has three large televisions. Two of them were along the bar, one on each side. Great for if you have a seat along the bar as you can chat up the barkeep about the current state of modern football -- that is when she isn't super busy dealing out $5 Modelo's. The largest TV is off to the side, for the viewing pleasure of the lounge area. This area is furnished with large L-shaped couches, ideal for group sizes between 4 to 10. When occupied, it gives that fervent energy one looks for in a sports bar, combined with the rare comfort of personal space commonly forgone during a sporting event.\n\nThe bar was a little too intimidating for me. I feel like if your Manchester United jersey is not advertising vodafone, you may not be ready to appreciate the subtle intricacies in the \"pitch\" as many of the bar side stalwarts would. I'm sure they're all still very inclusive, I just don't wanna answer with \"FIFA\" to when they drop that friendly - \"I'm a left wing back. Whaddaya play, mate?\"\n\nMy buddy and I spent most of my 90 minutes plus stoppage time in the lounge area, enjoying the World Cup in the only way we know how --- directing troll comments at the world class athletes as they flash across the screen.\n\n\"Damn does Toni Kroos spend his offseason at Vegas DJ-ing?\"\n\n\"Yo the Croatia jersey reminds me of the checkered wax paper from Golden Boy's Pizza\"\n\nThe more beer, the less tact.\n\n\"Breh Modric looks like Steve Nash without sunlight.\"\n\n\"Oh wait watch-- wait-- ah damn! I thought Suarez was gonna bite him from the back right there!\"\n\n\"Let God save the Queen, Pickford you save that goal\"\n\nThere will be a point in alcohol consumption when the indecencies from our mouths are assuaged, if only by its incoherency. Instead of becoming a nuisance, our recent loss of intelligible speech becomes a welcomed excitement added to the bar. We begin to exchange high fives with new found friends.\n\n\"ALL ABOARD THE LUKAKU TRAIN!\"\n\n\"It's ha-mays. HA-mays. HA-MAYS Rodriguez.\"\n\n\"MBAPPPPPPE!!! That boiiiiii fast\"\n\n\"RaHEEEEEEEMMM\"\n\nJubilation in the air, beer dripping freely from our chin, and flashes of thumbs up to the bartender who still manages to find time to clear empty glasses from our den. It did not matter if a jersey had three lions, or if they looked like pizza wax paper. Everyone was just at Murio's to have a good time, and a good time was there to be had.\n\nIt only happens once every four years. Thanks Murio's for making it count.", "author": "Ringo M."}

I wasn't on the barstool, but had my hand resting on the seat and my foot on the footrest to lift myself up as I if I was getting on the stool to sit down. After one drink, I wasn't dunk, and though I was feeling a little impatient, I wasn't doing more than what I do when I get on a stool for any other reason. \n\nThe doorman got a little closer than I generally expect unless someone is trying to get aggressive about something, he shouted like he thought I was deaf, and got in my face, refusing to back off. Basically, agitated bully behavior. So I turned my back on him, announced to my friends we were leaving, and we all walked out. I was the one that invited them there in the first place. I bought a replacement drink at the next bar for the one friend who had not yet finished his, but my other friend and I had been waiting with already empty drinks for the bartender's attention.\n\nI can understand why you might want a doorman who doesn't mind getting in a fight, but one who walks into the bar after a guy and makes up excuses to harass customers is not a wise choice. After going here for six months, never again. Crocodile Dundee, you are a shameful excuse for a doorman.

So doing the math (7x3= $21) so why was my bill $30?!?!? \n\nTo top that off, I asked my friend as he was ordering drinks to get me a glass of water. He ordered drinks too.. But no, this red head bartender dared to be so extremely rude to say \"water? That's it.. Water\" (... He just ordered 3 drinks from you BTW) and that wasn't the last, she then continued to say \"well, you better babysit this because I ain't filling another glass\" ... \n\nIf you are too good to serve a glass of water along with cocktails, then have a self serve area for water. What if the person dehydrated, what if that person was a drunk and needed to sober up. Completely unnecessary rudeness and poor service, that we decided to just finish our drinks and leave.", "author": "Tiffany N."}

No one was demanding her attention. Two more minutes passed, and there was a loud thunk that could have been a top heavy bar stool hitting the floor. Nope. It was a top heavy patron who had fallen backwards off his stool, landed on the back of his head, unconscious (his eyes were unblinking, glazed and open). It took four guys to get him up while My husband hovered over the phone ready to call 911. Once he was up, we decided to leave since we hadn't even been glanced at. As we do, we overhear the boozy bartender lackadaisically slur, \"is his head ok?\" No. No, it's not.

I like this bar.  It's a good bar.  It still feels like a neighborhood bar, in spite of its shiny new decor.  The cocktails are unpretentious and tasty, the beer selection is always good.  It's so good, in fact that a friend and I came here on the last day of SF Beer week 2014 to get a taste of the coveted Russian River Pliny the Younger.  It was also among the worst experiences either of us have ever had at a bar.  \n\nWe knew that Monday was when the keg was going to be tapped.  My friend had the day off and got there around noon to see when it was going to happen.  6 was when it was supposed to happen and my friend hung around, alone at first, until I was off work and met her at around 4.  We both spoke to the bartender about how crazy Pliny tapping is, how annoying it is when everyone's asking about it, even when the sign out front says \"Pliny tapping at 6.\"  We joked and agreed with her about how overhyped this beer probably is, but that we've had yet to try it so we just wanted to cross it off our list.\n\nI've often been in when Alma is tending bar, and she's been a capable enough bartender.  We bantered a bit that day, and at the point I arrived, she knew my friend's name and understood why the two of us were there.  We were having a great time joking with the others who'd been sitting at the bar for hours hoping to claim the same goal.  By the time 6 hit, the bar was packed, with hands waving in the air, everyone trying to get a taste from the pony keg the bar had been allotted.  \n\nIn any situation such as this, one would think that the 'tender would do some serious triage, attending to those bar patrons who've been sitting at the bar for a few hours first, then taking orders from those who clearly pushed their way upon the bar in only the last few minutes.  It was the exact opposite of what happened.  She made two meager sweeps of the bar, passing up several of those sitting at the bar in favor of others who had just arrived, often without even the mildest of acknowledgment.  Both times she came by our end, I flagged and waved, asked for two servings, got a nod, and... nothing.  The second time she cam around, the same, only this time our neighbors helped out, telling her that my friend and I had been waiting to be served.  She, looked, nodded and... nothing.  She returned to the tap, began serving others, again.  Seconds later, reaching for more glasses to serve other patrons... Foam... \n\nThe Pliny was gone, neither my friend nor I getting served, while several others around us, who had pushed and crowded around, were given 4, 6, 8 servings.  Many of the people sitting at the bar didn't get served.  Even after mentioning, \"Hey, what gives? We've been here for hours,\" all we got was a hapless shrug and the most insincere of apologies.  To be fair, it was gone, but to have been so blatantly ignored was bordering on gross incompetence.  \n\nAgain I like this bar, I'll go back, but I'll either walk right out if I see Alma behind the bar or insist for another tender to help me.  You should, too.  If you see a short, olive-skinned woman with long black hair behind the bar, leave.  Wait for other bartenders to be there, they're far better at their jobs.", "author": "Lewis M."}

There's one pool table and a sign up board where you can put your name down to play some pool.  They have music playing and there's plenty of places to sit.  They do have dollar beer night, which is awesome, and the drinks weren't too highly priced either.  It wasn't horribly packed and there were random people walking in at different times during the night.

Roy is right that Murio's really was the last excellent dive bar in that area and definitely had its own vibe to it. Now it may as well be any bar, but I don't necessarily think that's a bad idea.\n\nFirst, the bartenders still kick ass. They are funny, nice but still have a biting sense of humor and know how to mix you a drink.\n\nSecond, bathrooms. Ok guys let's be honest--how many times did you go to Murio's because you had too much to drink at Magnolia or somewhere else and you really needed to pee? I think in 1999 that's how I actually discovered the place in the first place. Well now you can do that in three very clean bathrooms in a bar that's still kind of cool even if it's no Zeitgeist.\n\nThird, they have Pliny on tap. That definitely means something.\n\nFourth, the pool table is still there and I have tons of memories attached to that thing.\n\nAnyway, if you didn't go back in the day you'd probably think--oh this is just a nice mostly clean, dark-ish bar. If that's how you approach it good for you. But for me it'll always be Murio's even with the new facelift.", "author": "Paul C."}

Their happy hour lasts from noon to 7 and they, the good people of Murio's, will provide you with a well drink or beer of your choice for just three dollars. You say, \"Why thank you, Murio's!

NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nFirst the GAP, now this.  I remember during the dot com era when all the window displays were so perfect, like a wannabe Chestnut street.  It was a scary time in the Haight, but slowly, history prevailed and the landmark Haight perservered.\n\nWTH did you do to my beloved Murio's, the last real holdout of trashy historical dive bars left in the upper Haight?  It was a toilet, it was a drunktank, it was edgy, it was freaky, it was real...I loved it!  I miss it.  In the words of Sally in the Peanuts Halloween episode where they cut up the pumpkin in preparation for carving, \"You didn't tell me you were going to KILL it!!!!\"\n\nI should have known something was up when I first saw all that wood covering the front recently.  I figured they were doing some minor changes or exterior mods, but never in a million years expected this.  Have to admit though, they did an amazing job!!!  Honestly, the first time I saw it, I did a real double-take.  I literally took a step back and looked at the outside to make sure I really was at the right place.  Visually, it is pretty darn impressive.  Whoever handled the re-do more than accomplished what they were paid to do.  Hell, whoever did it was a G.D. magician!  This place looks so nice inside.  The makeover is gorgeous and had I been blindfolded and brought in, I would have sworn up and down that there is no way it could have been the same place.  And yet, with all the cleanup and upgrading, we lost a little part of ourselves along the way.  The crowd is obviously very different now and the place looks and feels nothing like what it had been, both good and bad.  \n\nI have countless memories of drinking here over the years, in the day and the night, fun times shooting pool with wild alcohol abandon.  There must be a ton of lost souls in the area...where will they all go now?\n\nA cynical friend of mine said that if he had wanted to go to a place like this, he would have gone to the marina (or perhaps Martin Mack's) and that there are plenty of places like this already, so why kill a historic dive?  Personally, I  really like how it looks in there, but only wish it had been anywhere else on that block.  I also have serious doubts if the customer base in the area can support what the new decor of this establishment aspires to be.  Curious to see which way all this will go once the place finds itself and the customer base finds a natural level.  What type of crowd will frequent this place?  Only time will tell.\n\nLike they always say, change is inevitable and there is nothing as inevitable as change.  As to whether it actually can be considered progress remains to be seen.   Popped in here for a quick drink the other night, but didn't stay long since I was too shocked.  I still have mixed feelings so will keep my review rating exactly where it is until I go back a couple more times.  \n\nLike I said earlier about Sally in the Peanuts cartoon...\"You didn't tell me you were going to KILL it!!!!\"  What next?

The interior has been gutted, the ceiling lifted, and the walls replaced with very modern looking wallcoverings.  There are fancy light fixtures and a loungy area in the back to hang out.  That said, it is still a BAR, and a place for cocktails.  \nYES, as reported, the Pliny the Elder is no long on tap.  HOWEVER, the bar does have Blind Pig IPA on tap still, which is also made by Russian River Brewing Co.  This gives me hope that the dearest Pliny will return in the near future (Haighters, you can find Pliny on tap at Tornado and at the Page).  \nFrom a price perspective, it does seem as if it is a little bit more expensive.  The first time I went we drank some Blind Pigs, and I believe those were in the standard 4-5 dollar a pint range.  But I was, um, not sober when I walked in there.  \nI went last night and had a few Manhattans while my wife had red wine.  The wines have been upgraded it looks like to decent brands--$7 a glass with a nice pour.  My Manhattans (using Bulleit bourbon) were also healthy on the booze and clocked in at $7 per drink.  Seems like a bit more than I remember paying at the old Murios, but still not bad at all...\nFor now, the place seems to have kept its roots while upscaling a bit.  I will keep an eye on this one.", "author": "Blake W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-07-18", "description": "With my mug, I don't have any delusions that pretty hipster bartenders will fawn over me; however, on the dreary afternoon that my associate and I skulked into this establishment, we were met with a murderous glare akin to that of a menstruating honey badger. The bar was nearly empty: one patron at the bar, and a table of four near the pool table, quietly conspiring. The bartender peeled her gaze away from her cell phone, looked up expectantly, and when it registered that we were not who she hoped we'd be, the change in her features was audible; you could HEAR her hopes crash to the grimy, wooden floor. She grunted a greeting. My friend and I saddled up and ordered two Pabst drafts, she pulled them, threw the coasters down on the bar, and slammed the two pints in front of us. Then, she went back to manically texting.\n\nThe bar itself was unremarkable. It could have been a bar on the southwest side of Chicago. Or Milwaukee. Or Boston: dark wood, Christmas lights, mirrors, artwork scrawled on napkins by patrons over the years, signs issuing various warnings (don't be an asshole, \"Tip the Bartender, Bastards!\"). For this reason alone, the atmosphere was friendly enough.\n\nI grew up frequenting the bars of the southwest side of Chicago that Stuart Dybek wrote about in his stories in Coast of Chicago - the places that offered bowls of hard-boiled eggs and peanuts at the bar, the places that Polish, Italian, and Irish families spent Sundays commiserating with friends and family. I base the quality of an establishment like this by how quickly I can engage in a friendly conversation with the bartender or patron upon entering (usually about local sports, but not always), and I've applied that litmus test to neighborhood [read: \"dive\"] bars I've visited in all other cities throughout the country. For example, at Mr. Bing's on Columbus where we went the night before, Bruce, the Bartender, greeted us warmly and invited us in to watch the Giants game within 10 seconds of us walking in. We paid a LOT more for drinks that night, but stayed much longer... Hmmmmm... I bet you are wondering why...\n\nMeanwhile at The Trophy Room, the jukebox was playing Radiohead's Kid A in its entirety, and I proceeded to try to convince my comrade that, despite his issues with any music recorded after 1975, this album was a damned good one. My efforts proved fruitless. Our conversation went from music to the temperature of the beer in drinking establishments (he commented to me that he felt his Pabst was warm. He bought the beer that day, so I had forfeited my complaining rights). He remembered hearing from a friend of his in Amsterdam that, on bottles of Heineken, there is a suggested temperature that the beer should be chilled, and that if it is any colder, it compromises the flavor. He asked the bartender, who at this time was busily chatting up a friend who had entered bar and took a seat near her at the end of the bar, if she might grab him a bottle of Heineken -that he wasn't going to drink it, but only use it for reference; however, in the middle of his explanation, she cut him of, \"Yeah, yeah. I get it! I GET it!\" She grabbed the bottle from the fridge and slammed it down in front of him.\n\nNow, another of this bartender's friends had arrived, a ratty-haired, hipster chick with old school punk band patches neatly sewn or ironed onto her Gap jean jacket. She was cheerily served a 24 oz. can of Pabst Blue Ribbon - for $2, I should add. The prices, even for the middle of the day, were enough for us to subject ourselves to the bartender's abuse for one more pint. The young women chattered merrily, glowering at us, disaffected, whenever our conversation became a bit boisterous, as conversations are wont to do in gin mills.\n\nWe finished our beer, paid up, tipped the bartender much more than she deserved, and went across the street for a veggie burrito.\n\nMy overall impression: I spent the late 80's and early 90's mostly being ignored by hostile, hipster chicks with punk band patches on their jean jackets. I dated a few: not as special as they fancied themselves to be. I don't enjoy paying good money for that memory. Maybe I'm too old.", "author": "Daniel R."}

It is also a place where you will have beer spilled on your Christian Loubotains (wear non-designer here), you will be asked to flash your breasts, and if you're not careful you can be speared in your boney hips by a pool stick by a drunk guy who blames the assault on you instead of taking responsibility. What else to expect from a drunk wielding a four and a half foot stick? It comes with the territory here.\n\nAll of the downfalls considered, Murio's also happens to rock, even in the opinion of a girl who prefers wine bars and designer shoes (and bags. and clothes. and makeup...oh god!). I like to come here with the merry band of alcoholics I like to call my best friends. Probably because when one is drunk, one tends to think EVERYONE is their best friend. This should give you some idea of how much time we spend inebriated. I can come here and have my ass kicked at pool by Amir, drunk cry with Drue, and watch Starla charm the pants off of boys. Oh and smoke outside with two of the three mentioned above. It's gritty, it's greasy, and the bathroom is filthy. But all in a good way. Go there. Drink. Play pool.

I got to play some Cramps on the night I learned Lux Interior had died. I even chatted briefly with some fellow about the Cramps.  At that point I decided that knowing a little bit about/having seen the Cramps should probably be a requisite for entry into a certain type of dive bar.  \n\nThrew a few dollars in and added on some Modern Lovers (and Kevin did too! Good taste, my friend!) as well as Radio Birdman.  \n\nNow, I don't know about you guys here in SF, but in Michigan, Radio Birdman is not exactly found on every jukebox.

That would be a dirty nasty dive bar crawl. \n\nStop one on the crawl would be in the back of the bar with a few strong drinks for a game of pool, since the daytime drinkers here are much more serious about verbally abusing each other over 10 or 12 cocktails than playing a game which requires some level of coordination. \n\nStop two would be on the mismatched bar stools where you could down a few more drinks while engaging in conversation with people who will make you think you are visiting a circus sideshow rather than a bar. The upside is that the regulars, along with the wide array of Christmas lights, will cast a healthy glow on you that will make you look beautiful and not the least bit wasted!\n\nStop three would be the restrooms, which I recommend visiting with drink in hand. Since you are going to, at this point, be getting drunk enough to spill this is a prime place to do it for disinfectant purposes.\n\nStop four on this crawl will take you to the counter across from the bar where you can ceiling gaze before your vision becomes double and you can no longer appreciate the fine art caricatures, the large tennis racket and hidden trophys this place has provided for your viewing enjoyment. \n\nStop five? The tables by the front door. By this time it should be getting dark out so this should be celebrated with a tall boy of PBR as you watch the hipsters and nighttime riff-raff take over the bar. \n\nThe final stop on this dive bar crawl will undoubtedly be the floor, hence the term \"crawl\".

So we were having a great time wandering the streets,had a look at what my Wife thought was Joplins old house, bought a couple of t-shirts had a bite to eat looked in a few shops,you know the thing.....As we were reaching the bottom end of Haight St we decided that a drink was in order.As luck would have it this decision occured just as we were passing by The Trophy Room.Now from the outside the place didn't look too much,but this isn't meant to put the place down,in my world not looking much is a good thing,i'm a Metalhead, if my feet don't stick to the floor I feel uncomfortable (My feet didn't stick to the floor here so don't worry!!)

But not here,straight to the bar, 2 bourbon and cokes and away we go!!....After a while we got chatting (accosted) by a guy called Raymond who was from Boston (if he still hangs there there say hi from me). Who likes to take the pee out of us tea drinkers : ) Now, by means of witchcraft Raymond managed to talk us into supplying him with a couple of Long Island Iced Teas (without the Gin). This is when things took a turn for the odd/weird/Haight District...*disclaimer* Lee\"Bio-Zombi\"Z in no way endorses being in Rome and doing what the Romans do!!..My wife and Raymond got to talking about herbal cigarettes. And in no time at all a trip to Hippie Hill in Golden Gate Park had been organized and certain medicinal items were procured and enjoyed......In the 2 weeks that we spent in San Francisco we enjoyed 3 really good drinky sessions, one in Whisky Thieves,one in North Beach who's name escapes us.

The PBR Tallboys are like $4 or something and always served COLD.  Even if the novelty of drinking tallboys in a bar has worn off for you, pints of their delicious tap beer (including one of my personal favorites Red Tail Ale) come in at about $3.50.  And yes, they have a full selection of booze for all you non-beer drinkers.  \n\nYeah the layout is a little weird; if you get stuck in that middle \"bridge\" sort of area you'll definitely be getting jostled but so far it hasn't been hard to find a decent space on either side of the place.  \n\nThe jukebox has a good selection of punk rock and rock n' roll, which I know seems a little \"typical\" for SF dives, but personally, I'll take that any day.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-01-29", "description": "I love this place, and I wish to hell I knew about it in the years I lived in the City.  A few years ago on a visit, I was trying to work off a hangover and trying to work up the energy to do my usual 2-3 hour CD/DVD binge at Amoeba Records next door.  Caffeine, food, lots of water, and a trip to the beach still didn't sooth my aching regretful soul.  So time for a small hair of the dog to smooth things out, as it were.\n\nSix blissful hours later, I decided to save Amoeba for another day.  2-3 kick ass spicy bloody mary pints, several Red Hook pints, and a few Jameson's shots took care of any shopping plans I may have had, and I felt a hell of a lot better.  I wasn't even broke.  It's one of the cheapest bars in San Francisco, and utterly without pretension.  It was the Thursday before St. Patrick's Day weekend, and I watched at least 7 groups or pairs of obviously underage people try to get a drink there.  Being right where Haight Street hits Golden Gate Park, there's a fair amount of runoff as far as the tourist trade goes.  I must say, short of booting them to the street, the bartender did the most efficient, amusing, and occasionally polite job of getting rid of the teen drinkers.  It's been years so I forgot the name and the face, but the bartender was a cool guy that had been employed at one point doing repairs on the Golden Gate Bridge, had moved up to the Pacific Northwest somewhere, and had just moved back to SF a few weeks before my entrance into his dark, divey part of heaven.  Let's put it this way, the bar was fairly dead since I was doing some early drinking (walked in around 10-10:30) and this guy was a genuinely interesting person to talk to.  He even got me into watching the NasCar race on TV, and I freaking hate NasCar.  Loathe it.  Racing to me is the most boring sport on the planet.  This guy had enough facts, trivia, and stories about races he had either gone to or watched, that his commentary actually made watching the monotonous race interesting.  And again, totally nonpretentious.  Non-hipster, non-scenester, and just down to earth.  Kind of like a neighborhood redneck-ish dive transplanted somehow into the Upper Haight.  \n\nI avoided the Upper Haight for the most part when I lived in SF, mainly due to the abundance of hippies and dreadful (no pun intended) pseudo-hippies/trust fund wannabe people.  Murrio's is as non-hippie you can get for the Upper Haight, in fact there's lots of good punk represented on the jukebox, including the fairly obscure early 70's punk band Radio Birdman.  \n\nMost people who I've met here were really cool.  On another daytime visit I had programmed a Poison Idea song and a Hard-Ons song on the jukebox, and was working on my pint.  A punk lookin guy and his girlfriend (?) walked in and sat a couple seats down from me.  When the Hard-Ons song started (I think it was \"Girl in the Sweater\") the guy said, \"Alright, the Hard-Ons!\" and started bobbing his head to the music.  Once my Poison Idea song started \"Just to Get Away\" the guy looked straight at me: \"Did you play this?!  This song RULES!\"  Needless to say we talked for awhile.  I know this has nothing to do with the bar itself, the beer, or the prices, but 50% of a bar's appeal IMO is the crowd that hangs out there, and Murrio's is fairly douchebag-free due to its lack of pretension. This guy's girlfriend was wearing a Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 pin, so that maybe gives you an idea of \"my crowd\" or whatever.\n\nThe Haight Street tourism/crazy person spillover does occasionally result in some lameness, but sometimes to amusing results.  My favorite was the Jim Morrison wannabe-looking guy with the snakeskin cowboy hat, who seemed like he had sampled a fair amount of 60's style psychedelia, if you catch my drift.  Literally the second I'm thinking to myself, \"Does this guy wanna be Ian Astbury from the Cult?\" he TAKES OFF HIS SHIRT FOR NO REASON, muttering dopey poetry-like nonsense, and CHANGES INTO A CULT T-SHIRT AT THE BAR.  At this point, I'm thinking, is this Ian Astbury himself fallen onto hard times? Or is this guy in some (God forbid) Cult tribute band?  Either way it was a fuckin surreal mindbending moment that could probably happen only at Murrio's.\n\nAnyway, the point of this rambling review is that Murrio's is a reasonably priced, fairly pretension-free place if you want to go have a few beers in a non-meat market type environment.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-01-04", "description": "A few years ago, a Murio's patron Yelped the now-defunct dive as being the \"John Lovitz\" of bars.  Crude, classless and in poor taste, both Lovitz and the old Murio's had character.  Sadly, the new iteration of this long-time Upper Haight landmark lacks any of the Lovitzness that previously drew me in.  In trying to lounge-up the place with cheap and tacky decor (square white cow hair seats and light fixtures that were seemingly a high school shop class project), the owner (who, speaking of class, has been known to dress as Adolf Hitler for fun) has simply put lipstick on a pig (or tried to shine a turd, as we say in Oklahoma).  Rather than throwing gobs of money into this renovation, he should have focused on ridding the joint of the most unsavory aspect of the bar: its lame tenders.  Nick's boorish misogyny and racism have driven off more customers than they've attracted and the relatively new female tender lacks even a modicum of charm.  That said, male patrons will be relieved that they no longer have to sneak into the women's restroom to drop a deuce, as was the case previously.  As for me, my boycott (begun when Nick demanded fellatio from a female patron as a precondition for entry a year ago) will continue and I will spend my money down the street at Alembic, where both the drinks and bartenders are thoughtful.", "author": "siegfried s."}

Lately, I am less than satisfied with the service of the bartenders. Militant group members have more hospitality than the bartenders at this place. As much as I like being ID'd at my age, I feel as though this task has some baring on the hostility exhibited by the employees. There was also the request to listen to a recent sports game, that, as the bartender explained, would cause difficulty for him monitoring the dozen patrons (who were also watching the game) and so proceeded to put music on the jukebox. Before this incident, I paid for a mixed drink that had too much tonic and no alcohol and asked to have it strengthened. The bartender responded rudely to this and stated that he couldn't add more to the drink, but would have to make a new one, much to his chagrin. Now, as much as I appreciate a new drink, I do not feel like wasting a drink that would have been perfectly acceptable on it's own. \n\nThe list of frustrations continue with this spot; most including the service.
