I've been going to the Haight Street one for years and been coming to this location for the past 5yrs on a monthly basis, usually when I'm at The Make Out Room across the street. Both locations are slightly different but are more so the same.\n\n If I'm up for two slices I usually get a meat slice, usually the pepperoni and follow up with a pesto. I have never been to NY so I can't compare to NY pizza but this place is one of my favorite pizza places and I am someone who knows pizza well. I also like a variety of pizza places so all I can say is for you to try it and see how it goes. Judging pizza is almost like judging a burrito. Not one place is the best. It depends on the day of the establishment and depends on the establishment you're in the mood for.\n\nSo I say give it a try. Also the staff here has always been super cool. \n\nPS even though I don't come all the time I always carry their punch card!", "author": "Majid S."}

After years of enjoying escape from ny pizza, I've decided to end our patronage. What started off as a love affair with the *you say potato* pizza, an awesome happy hour at the downtown location, and super tasty salads has become a series of super disappointing delivery experiences. The last three times we've ordered pizza from here the pizza has been subpar: either sloppily made, poorly transported, burnt on the bottom, or made with clearly expired dough (see pic). I realize businesses change and the closure of the location in the Castro was very disappointing but paying close to $100 for pizza to be delivered only to get pizza that is embarrassing to serve to my guests was the last straw.

There's a subtle sweetness to it, which I liked. \n- Good crust-to-toppings ratios for both of our pizzas.\n\nTHE GREAT ESCAPE: Pepperoni, mushrooms and onions. \nhttp://bit.ly/13uhjPo \n- Medium 14in = $22.20\n- Large 18in = $27.70\n- Extra large 20in = $30.45\n**Additional toppings will cost you $1.75 (med), $2.25 (lg) and $2.50 (x-lg). We added olives to our large pizza. \n\nYOU SAY POTATO: Roasted sliced potatoes, whole roasted garlic cloves, topped with pesto sauce.\nhttp://bit.ly/13uhnP6\n- Medium 14in = $20.75\n- Large 18in = $25.95\n- Extra large 20in = $28.85\n\nWhen my friend suggested this pie, I thought he was crazy. The thought of having potatoes on pizza sounded unappetizing to me. \n\nI freakin' loved it!!\n- The potatoes were sliced thin enough so that the taters were nice and crispy. \n- The roasted garlic cloves were so soft and sweet, delicious! \n- My only complaint was that there wasn't a lot of the pesto, I wanted to taste more pesto in each bite. \n\nThey also have gluten-free crusts avail. But it's only avail in medium/14in crusts, and will cost you an additional $4.\n\nThese hours are for the Mission location only:\n- In-store hours: Sun-Wed 11am-12am, Thurs-Sat 11am-2am.\n- Pick-up & Delivery: Sun-Wed 11am-11:45pm, Thurs-Sat 11am-2am.\n\nThere's at total of 5 locations in SF: \n- Mission\n- Soma\n- Haight\n- Polk\n- Downtown: Think this is the only place that has happy hour from 4pm-6pm. $2.50 per slice and draft beer is a steal!\n\nThanks a bunch, Escape From NY!

Second time I got one of the BBQ chicken pizzas, which I think was put together by someone stoned out of their mind because all the bacon was heaped in one corner, and the chicken in another, so some slices didn't even have toppings on them. Also strangely the toppings were cut into enormous pieces, kind of unmanageable. \n\nWhat I will say though is the delivery guys for this place are awesome. They are so friendly, above and beyond really, also accommodating as I asked them to call instead of ringing my doorbell so my dog wouldn't bark.

This escape is a disappointment.\n\nTechinally half of the customers that do go here are probably smoke way way too much J's or drunk way way too much to remember what great food taste like.\n\nThe only pizza dish I could say was great, was the Potatoe and Garlic. It's sometimes call 'You say Potato'.What's with the silly names: 'U say Potato' should be known as Garlic and Potato Pizza. There are others such as 'Elementary My Dear Watsonville'. That pizza is a Artichokes and Tomatoes. What's wrong with calling it, an Artichokes and Tomatoes Pizza?What's a 'Andy Warhol', do I really want to find out? Isn't Andy Warhol known as the guy who got shot by a crazy drug addict model girlfriend? What's with these stupid gimmick names?! If you call it a different title, couldn't they have thought of a easier name than that. Why are they calling their pizzas, pies? It's confusing as hell.\nThe pesto pizza is dry.Pesto Pizza based on the menu are not found in New York, huh?Normal cheese pizza might be undercooked.

The soda 12.oz can for 1.15 is a rip off. \n\nNow the location: there is a lot of 'celebrity' autographs and photos on the wall, that looks cool. The guitar in the case is tight.

My cred: I grew up in a college town near Chicago, where pizza is a religion, and I was a very dedicated disciple. Serrano's is not intentionally hip. *Hip people may go there,* but it's just a pizza place that is doing everything right. Jesus, I've had *way* more pretentious pizza in this town - Pauline's, anyone? - but Serrano's? No. In fact, they were so unhip, they went through a phase of handing out little cards that pushed a real estate biz one of the owners had on the side. Yeah, if you closed a deal with him, you got like $300 worth of pizza or something. It was hilarious. Did I give a shit? No. Their pizza is classic and perfect.\n\nI was happy with Serrano's being the only pizza place in this neck of the woods. I considered myself fortunate.

Don't do it unless you want a big hassle.\n\nThe ordering interface is actually very user friendly but it was the follow up that really sucked.\n\n- The morning of the ordered delivery I called to confirm that the pizzas were going to be delivered on time.  At first they couldn't find my order and only after searching for a while did they find it.  I hung up feeling pretty sure that if I had not called to double check my order would not have arrived.\n\n- During the confirmation call I asked if they could deliver a little before noon (the time I had requested for my online order) they said they would try, but they were sure they would make it by the noon delivery....They showed up after 12:30.\n\n- I ordered three pies from their specialty combos on their menu.  One of those combos was their vegetarian.  After the delivery guy left we realized they gave us cheese pizza instead of the vegetarian.  The receipt reflected that I was charged for the veggie not the cheese\n\n- When I called to let them know that they sent me the wrong pie they offered to send a new one.  That was a great gesture but I had folks I needed to feed in a certain time frame, there was no time to wait for another delivery so I asked them to remove the charge from my credit card and they said it would.\n\n- Later that day I checked my credit card statement and they charged me for the full amount.  I called them and the manager told me to call and talk to a different manager tomorrow....", "author": "Jinenne S."}

I don't care how many times I've tried Nizario's, Marcello's, Serrano's, or Blowjo's - this is my favorite. \n\nThe ingredients are fresh and the potato-garlic-pesto is so good, I can't not get half the pizza to have it when I order.\n\nTip for ordering in person by the slice: scan the pizzas that are there for the taking.  Order the one that glistens the most.  It is the freshest and greasiest and will taste the best.", "author": "Christian H."}

I was ordering 2 slices and was more than $5 dollars. That's for sure. I told the cashier or server or whatever I have not enough cash. She says I can use the ATM there. I am not going to pay extra fees just for two slices of pizza when other places take credit cards or must pay a certain amount instead of CASH ONLY ON SLICES!!!

This is strictly because I've stopped by three times and got slices to go and the pizza tastes totally different than when you get home delivery.  They reheat it and it looses it's awesomeness.  It's way better delivered.  And they don't have to-go boxes. They slap on another paper plate on top of your slice and put it in a paper bag.  I'm telling you, order delivery., and if ordering online, ask for the WHOOODEEEHOOO instead of the knock or door bell.

And I would be back in perfect time for my pizza. When I came back, my pizza was done....or so I thought. They had burnt the pizza. The guy at the front was very apologetic. And we only waited for another 10 minutes for our new pizza. He apologized again, let us keep the \"burnt\" pizza (we figured we could pick off the top and the crust) and gave us 4 free slice vouchers (probably a $15 value!). This was much nicer than what Celia's did to us. They once delivered us a half burnt pizza like it was nothing.
