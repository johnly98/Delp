It's a great neighborhood sushi spot that's family friendly. They have a broad menu for such a small place and some interesting unique items too.\n\nThey also have a great happy hour menu before 6pm on weekdays.\n\nHighly recommend the hamachi carpacio if you like a little spice, tempura (breaded well, not too thick), and the 10 piece omakase is a pretty good deal.", "author": "Sharon L."}

And after I grabbed her new ones, he came over and tried to scare me that she'd get lots of splinters from them and get hurt sticking them in her nose or eyes. Um, maybe this is a problem for some kids, but you're not her dad, and my daughter is actually a sushi pro at this point. She actually uses her chopsticks and it's one of the things she loves about eating sushi.\n\n3) Sat us at a sticky table, and when we moved, chastised us for moving without asking for permission. He explained that it's sticky just because it's old... But the table we moved to wasn't sticky. So why did he sit us at the sticky table to begin with? When your restaurant is empty, maybe use the good tables first?\n\n4) Bought two lunch specials, each with salad, but only brought out one salad. Why?\n\n5) We asked if they had any juice. His answer was simply \"No\". Not \"No, sorry, but we do have x, y, z...\". Just \"No\".\n\n6) We had to share a soy sauce dish. Because apparently kids don't like soy sauce? Or deserve their own dish?\n\n7) Never came by to check how we were doing... We needed plates to actually eat on. I had to get up and go ask for one.\n\nBTW it's not like anyone was watching, but my daughter ate all of our nigiri, all of our gyoza, half of our rice, half of our maki, plus some of her soup and tempura. For a little one, she chowed down. Sushi is her favorite food. It's what she always asks for when I ask her what she wants.\n\nI do think this is a fine place for mid-range sushi if you're a group of friends or a couple. The quality of the food is quite good. Before I had kids, I really liked coming here. But now that I do have kids, I don't think this place is a good fit.", "author": "Jon E."}

People are constantly asking me where to go for lunch in the Castro and now that I know that Takara serves it, I've added it to my list of suggestions.  \n\nIf you're in the Castro, seeking well-priced Japanese food for lunch, here's your place.\n\nI understand that Takara does a bustling business at night which might account for the tired look of it during mid-day.  The tables were worn and the place looked bleak enough that I had a moment of hesitation on whether I really wanted to try their raw fish.  The moment passed, I overlooked the interior, ordered, and crossed my fingers.\n\nTrust.  I was rewarded.\n\nFor around $10.50, the lunch menu offers a Bento box as well as a combination sushi lunch which I opted for.  Miso Soup, and my choice of two maki (Hamachi Nega Maki, Spicy Tuna Roll), brought out well crafted fare that was light, fresh, and satisfying.  A steaming cup of green tea reinvigorated me almost enough to step back out into a day of rain.\n\nIt's nothing fancy during the daytime but their offering is satisfying and I've no doubt I'll return.  Takara Sushi?  Nice to finally see you.", "author": "Tracey A."}

Two of my friends and I ordered from the lunch menu and the price is decent for a Japanese restaurant but I have to say that the portions are a bit on the smaller side. I got a bento box with 2 items; salmon shioyaki and tempura. It was good but nothing spectacular. My tempura came with a small slice of eggplant, small slice of zucchini, a piece of broccoli, a slice of sweet potato (I think), and one tempura shrimp including a small salad, rice, and miso soup. \n\nHowever, one of my friends ordered their tempura udon and that looked so good! I was immediately regretful of my decision and wished I had ordered that! She said it was very delicious and would recommend so my guess is that you would probably get more of a bang for your buck ordering the udon. \n\nThe waiter was very kind and helpful though! I think I would try this place again for the udon but probably wouldn't go out of my way for it.", "author": "Christina C."}

Small, cozy spot for dining in, but they also have delivery/take-out.\n\nMy friend and I called and ordered take-out from Takara. Our order was ready really quickly (but it was also just sashimi so it was pretty simple/easy). The restaurant looked small and intimate when we went to pick up our order. It wasn't too busy for lunch on a weekday, but I can imagine potentially a wait for dinner or on weekends.\n\nWe ordered the CHEF'S CHOICE ($40), which consisted of 18 pieces of assorted sashimi, or 3 pieces of 6 different sashimi. I'm honestly not great at identifying sashimi, so I'm not sure what everything was. There was the usual salmon, hamachi and two kinds of tuna, and then two white cuts of sashimi. My favorite was one of the white ones, which was incredibly buttery and creamy in texture. The salmon was very good as well.\n\nThere's also other items you can order here: nigiri, rolls, teriyaki and other meat/fish entrees, udon, and hot/cold appetizers. Prices are pretty typical for sushi/Japanese and the sashimi is good quality. Would definitely recommend if you're looking for sushi in the Castro area!", "author": "Jessie L."}

At 7:12pm restaurant confirmed the order and begun to prepare the food, and the food wasn't be able to pick up until 8:16pm and finally got our food at 8:24pm. Almost an 30-min delay. Okay let me assume it is not the restaurant's problem but rather the delivery service itself; but the food was mediocre.\n\nTonkatsu: C.\nOkay, probably delivery of fried food was not a smart idea (foiled paper was used and a hole was cut at the lid preventing damping fried food with moisture), but it couldn't have been that bad? Very hard to chew.

The eggplant barely had taste in it.\n\nSpicy Tuna Roll: B.\nDecent, spicy tuna was with okay freshness.\n\nX-Roll: B-.\nIt's some salmon+tuna-topped roll with mayo. Fish freshness was average.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-05", "description": "Even though I had a passing curiosity about its previous identity as an intimate Asian fusion restaurant, I never made it here when Sumi ran this spot. It looked attractive, but I heard mixed notices about the food. When she retired six years ago, it completely fell off my radar, and when it changed names, it might as well have entered the witness protection program. Then one night, I was at Curry Boyz right across the street and glanced over. Suddenly it looked inviting to me. It only took ten years. Par for the course for me. Anyway, Jamie W. and I finally made it here after checking out the new rainbow crosswalks at 18th and Castro.\n\nThey just opened for the evening, so they were just setting up for dinner. Naming the place Takara didn't help me remember me since it's a pretty common Japanese name. There's even a restaurant in J-Town with the same name. It's kinda like naming a place Sam's. Anyhow, it's mainly sushi though they have standard Japanese fare if you prefer something that's been near a stove. Our meal began with a $5.95 plate of Gyoza which were pretty well grilled and provided a satisfying start (photo: http://bit.ly/1xyaZmn). We segued into a $4.95 plate of Grilled Eggplant slices sprinkled with chopped scallions and accompanied by a ponzu dipping sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1tL62XB).\n\nGood, not mushy though a tad lukewarm. The sight of Ankimo on a menu always makes me excited like a little girl wearing her first training bra. So for $8.50, a plateful was in order, and it was just as fresh a piece of monkfish liver as I could hope for, nicely sliced and also accompanied by ponzu sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1IjkSpm). That was gone so quickly I'm surprised Jamie still has fingers. Then our main sushi order arrived on one plate. To accommodate Jamie's taste, we had the $5.95 King California Roll which contains real versus imitation crab, a worthwhile dollar surcharge for the real thing (photo: http://bit.ly/1xzGk7N).\n\nNothing really to say about the roll except that it was put together as expected and tasted fine for a California roll, I suppose. I ordered the $12.95 X-Roll, an elaborate creation with yellowtail, avocado, tuna and salmon, drizzled with an aioli-like spicy sauce and topped with tobiko (photo: http://bit.ly/1s0bMM3). It was a bit like a rainbow roll with mayo. Not a bad thing if you ask me. The last was the $14 O-Toro Nigiri, fatty tuna wrapped around rice with tiny shrimp in another sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1xzGqfP). That was quite good but I was finding it hard to justify the price in my head, just my belly. They do sushi well here, and it's well worth a try if you're in the mood.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...sushi well executed...and they have ankimo...score!\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...tiny spot crowds easily so come earlier to avoid claustrophobia\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...attentive enough but a bit aloof\nTOTAL - 4 stars...probably your best sushi option in the Castro", "author": "Ed U."}

I ordered the hamachi nigiri, the tuna tar tar, and 2 different rolls. The best item I ordered was the hamachi nigiri because it was relatively fresh. The rolls were very basic, but I felt like it was my fault because I couldn't really see pictures of the rolls online. The tuna tar tar was good but it could have been better if it was spicy.

However, this time I decided to make a reservation at Takara in the Castro neighborhood. I had heard great things about it, and while I am always skeptical about restaurants in the Castro I threw caution to the wind. Well the wind blew it back in my face.\n\nI decided to go all vegetarian, and luckily Takara has a very nice selection of vegetarian options. The Cucumber Sonomono was the first disappointment. The vinegar tasted as if it has been diluted with water, most of the cucumbers had not even been dipped in the vinegar let alone soaked in it. I actually had to pour soy sauce over it, to be able to eat it. The vegetable gyoza was the next item up, and they were perfectly prepared, golden and crisp on one side and the vegetables inside bursting with flavor. For my rolls I ordered the oshinko maki, and the vegetable dragon roll.\n\nThe oshinko was crisp and perfectly pickled, unfortunately the nori that it was wrapped in was stale and tough. The dragon roll was probably the highlight of the night. Well prepared, the nori was fresh, and the avocado and eggplant prepared with perfection.\n\nNow comes the worst experience in my restaurant life. The wait staff appeared to be on speed. I have never in my life felt so rush at a restaurant. No sooner did I place the last piece of food in my mouth, they were there snatching away the empty plate. I was in and out of the restaurant in 30 minutes. I left stressed and completely unnerved by the overly hyper staff.\n\nIt was the first and last time at Takara Sushi. Take a lesson from your four-legged world traveler. Don't go here. There are so many better places in the city to get really fine sushi and to do so in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere. Keep walking my friends, keep walking.\n\nWith love from my dog bowl to yours...happy eating.\n\nshatasdogbowl", "author": "DJ S."}

Up until the most recent order, I would have given this restaurant 5 stars.  The food is very good.  The guy who delivered it was always prompt, polite, and prepared.  \n\nMy last time ordering from here was, unfortunately, the last time.  I placed an order with Eat24 (as I always do), and at the end delivery was estimated at 50-70 minutes.  After 80 minutes without any delivery, I contacted Eat24 and they let me know my food had left the restaurant 20 minutes prior, and it was on its way.  Another 20 minutes passed, so i contacted Eat24 again and they told me the same thing. \n\nI live less than a 5-minute drive from the restaurant, so this was unusual.  Whenever I order, I post my phone number twice to make sure it's on the receipt, but I never got a call.  \n\nFinally, after waiting 2 hours, a new delivery guy showed up.  He looked very...  Dazed and confused, to put it in a non-incriminating tone.  I asked what took so long.  \"Well, um...  I, yeah, um...  The people before weren't happy with their order, so I had to get a new one.\"  I shrugged it off and waited for my receipt to sign.  \"I...  um...  I don't have a pen.\"  Before I could offer to go get one myself, he left with my unsigned receipt.  Did he forge it?  Wrap it around white sage for a cleansing ritual?  That unfortunately was left a mystery.\n\nThe food was completely cold when I opened it, and my agedashi tofu was missing its sauce.  I decided to call the restaurant to let them know I had an issue with the delivery. The woman I spoke with cut me off mid-sentence, \"So we are very busy tonight.  That's why it took so long.  Ok?  Thank you.\"  \n\nNot that I'm anyone special, but since I'd become a regular of this restaurant, and always tipped 20% (although in SF maybe that's a pittance), I was expecting the courtesy of a phone call that my order would be late, a delivery person who was lucid, or at the very least an apology from Miss Busy.  \n\nSo I won't be patronizing Takara anymore.  Maybe it's better when you dine at the restaurant, but I suppose they've gotten too big to care about the little people who order their delivery.  At least it's an opportunity to find other great Japanese food in the city.", "author": "Navi Y."}

I felt the price's were a bit steep and the portions to be underwhelming. I was planning to ask for a menu for another set of rolls, however the Dinosaur roll didn't increase my appetite. The fried crab was too dry and had very jerky-like texture to it.

Live Sushi Bistro has been my go to place for years, but the last few times, the quality has definitely gone downhill. So I started looking around for another sushi delivery option.  Thanks to Yelp, I found Takara.  \n\nFirst order was great!  There's an easy online ordering process, it said food would be delivered in 45-60 minutes and it came at 52 minutes, and the sushi was very good.  half expected my hotate salad to show up soggy, but the mixed greens were great, with cherry tomatoes, slices of scallop, and there was just the right amount of yuzu vinaigrette.  The sake and hamachi nigiri were generous in size and also very fresh, and the 49er roll was perfectly fine (although a little boring).  Plus delivery was free with $30+ orders.  \n\nI'll definitely be ordering from Takara again!", "author": "Vivian W."}

She offered to bring it back, but it was fine. Didn't realize this would be indicative of the entire meal.\n\nFor our main meal, a friend and I both ordered bento boxes with cooked food. These came out 40 minutes after we ordered, and everything was cold. Our friends ordered sushi, so I bet they just timed the food wrong and let it sit in the kitchen. \n\nWhen I let our server know the food was cold, she asked us if we wanted to reheat or remake the food. We said remake. When she came out with the food 10 minutes later, it was clear that the salmon teriyaki and saba shioyaki were reheated, and they didn't even touch to the cold tonkatsu. Why bother asking if you're not going to do what is requested? I was so mad I told my friend I wasn't going to eat the cold tonkatsu. The server overheard me saying this and asked if I wanted it reheated. Why didn't you just remake the entire thing the first time I sent it back? If i'm sending food back a second time, there's no way I'm going to eat it anymore. I told her no thanks because I was starving.\n\nAt that point, I guess she felt bad (or that her tip was in jeopardy) so the kitchen sent us two fresh tonkatsus \"on the house\". Too little too late - 1) why didn't you just do this the first time the food was sent back!?!? and 2) the only reason they gave it to us \"on the house\" (oh thank you for your generosity) was because the server felt bad the second time, not even the first time. Kudos for feeling bad, but seriously, I've never been to a restaurant who tried so little to make up for a bad experience.\n\nThe owners/chef/server/whoever clearly didn't care about doing it right the first time, so this place clearly seems to me not to care much about the customer. It doesn't cost much to remake two portions in the grand scheme of things - I was a server for a long time before and during college, and I would have never treated my guests like that. I'm not asking for much, but just to have things given as ordered. I just hate that I felt like a second chance wasn't enough, but that I had to give a third and a fourth. Lucky them my friend was still nice enough to tip 15%. I'm not stingy, but people don't typically tip under 15, and if they do, it's because something needs to be seriously reconsidered and made better, whether that's food, service quality or both.", "author": "Joanie W."}

This place must be rating themselves or they wouldn't have fallen so flat. The sushi and sashimi was nothing to be amazed about. In fact, it was utterly disappointing. This place may try to look fancy but it is not up to par compared to other Japanese restaurants in the city. \n\nFirst, who sears O-toro especially when I ordered sashimi. If I wanted cooked fish I would order it. But I ordered sashimi and I expected a piece of raw fish but instead I end up with half cooked fish. Is there something wrong with it like maybe it was about to spoil thus you cooked it? After I ate my order of O-toro I began to wish I had not ordered it at all. It gave me a bad after taste and I felt it might have been spoiled because of the strong fishy smell, but not the good kind. Besides the O-toro I ordered Uni, which again is disappointing because the Uni looked pale yellow and is doused with soy sauce. I actually like my seafood nice and clean so the only garnish I really put on my raw seafood is a small dab of wasabi and that is IT. No soy sauce. So I was disappointed to see that the chef had put soy sauce over the uni. Another disappointment was that instead of one or two large pieces of uni placed over rice, I had small little bits almost what I consider the leftovers scraped off the bottom of the container stuffed on top of rice with some type of edible paper wrapped around it. It was utterly sad and I cannot start to describe the despair I felt when I saw it. But down the hatch it went and yeah, it really tasted like the dried up stuff scraped from the bottom of the container. \n\nBesides the disappointment I felt with the O-toro and the Uni there were a few items I was satisfied with. The third item I ordered was Amaebi. This looked a lot better and unlike other sushi restaurants the raw shrimp does come with the fried shrimp heads, which we felt unless they give you the fried shrimp heads with this dish then you are missing out. The shrimp heads were perfectly fried but of course they have trimmed its whiskers so there wasn't a lot of that to munch on. Our fourth dish was the Baked Mussels and is good and pretty standard compared to other Japanese restaurants with the exception of Sushi Zone, which does the Baked Mussels perfectly and above standard, well worth the wait. Our final dish was the raw oysters from Japan, the Shigoku oysters. These were good and I do recommend trying these. The oysters were clean, fresh, and sweet. They were garnished with a special sauce, fish eggs, and green onions. \n\nOverall, I will NOT be coming back. This is not my type of sushi restaurant where they mask the real flavors and colors of the seafood. If you liked sauced up sushi and half cooked seafood that your parents won't be too afraid to try then this is your place. But if you are into the raw, clean, and REAL sushi then go else where.

On top of the really awesome food, our service was friendly and prompt.  The sashimi options looked really good as well. If you're a vegan/vegetarian, I highly recommend this place! There aren't too many options, however, the ones on the menu are so worth checking this place out for.  It was pretty affordable, too, around $50 for two people (including beer).", "author": "Rachael J."}

I had hoped this year unlike the other 2 years, we'd hit gold at Takara's, but, nope, it's strike three :( . At $18 a bowl, you'd think my mom would have at least liked something about the dish, but she disliked everything about it. She said the rice wasn't the short grain sushi type rice, and she got the tail end of the unagi with lots of bones and burnt bits on the edges, and not enough unagi sauce flavoring throughout the dish. Sigh...this pretty much sucks.\n\nMy caterpillar sushi roll on the other hand was tasty. I like how they use the bigger tobiko eggs instead of the tiny ones. I would have liked more unagi sauce drizzled on the bottom. It was rather skimpy, kinda like their unagi portions in it too. The good part is the fresh avocado on top. Very nice.\n\nJolene L. ordered 2 Aloha rolls specials...her favorite by far. It had sashimi tuna poke, and that's as much as ingredients I can remember...we also ordered the green tea ice cream served in a giant martini glass. I usually like green tea, but I thought it had a weird aftertaste finish, like eating a mouthful of lavender flowers. Yuck. At least my mom and Jolene L. ate it all. \n\nThe wait staff was efficient, friendly and helpful which earns the extra star. They consistently gave great water and tea service. Parking is metered streets.\n\nI am now in my mom's black list books... I can't go through another year giving her meh to blah unagi rice bowls for her birthday, I mean, what does it say when she'd rather eat unagi out of a tin can!?", "author": "Pauline L."}

Mama Ji's is overpriced and bad, and this place is no different.\n\nI got the Tokyo Breeze, which had pretty good reviews on Yelp. It had avocado and lemon with tuna on top. They also season the roll with sesame oil and salt, which I thought was interesting. It tasted really weird though. The tuna was fresh, but the lemon just completely threw off the taste of the roll. It was incredibly sour. My friend had a bite of mine and made a weird face. It's very unexpectedly sour so beware. \n\nMy friend got the chicken teriyaki dinner plate. It was very meh. Just a ton of chicken with rice and a side salad and miso soup. No cooked veggies or any kind of garnish.\n\nWe also got beer-- they have Asahi Black!!! If you've never tried it before, you have to get it. They poured it into this long fancy cup which looked nice. When we were done, we each asked for another one, and the waitress only came out with one beer\nand strangely, she poured half into each of our cups and walked away before we could ask for another one... This was super weird. It's as if she was trying to restrict our alcohol consumption or something lol. We definitely made it really clear that we each wanted another beer... why would we want to share one???! On top of that, she immediately came out with the check which made us uncomfortable since we just got our drinks and wanted to enjoy it. And then 5 minutes later (we hadn't paid yet), she came back to our table and was like oops sorry and took the check away and then brought it back a couple of minutes later. I assume she forgot to add the beer in there or something.\n\nAnyway, this was a super weird experience and a pretty mediocre meal.

My favorite Japanese restaurant closed in 2013 (was in the Mission) and I've been searching for one to take it's place ever since.  Quality and consistency of food, service, neighborhood and environment/customers are all factors.  \n\nDined at Takara on four occasions in the past 90 days - twice alone and twice with friends.  Each time I had a mix of sashimi and nigiri.  There are definite trends of strengths and needs-improvement.\n\nStrengths:\n\n1. Quality of food - yummy!  This includes sashimi and nigiri, plus food from the kitchen and sushi rolls, which my dining companions ordered and I tasted.  \n\n2. Friendly staff - warm, welcoming and not overbearing (more on this below)\n\n3. Environment - the feeling in the restaurant is always relaxed, fun and unpretentious\n\n4. Price - totally fair considering all factors\n\n5. Takes reservations - recommended, and totally appreciated by me.  (I believe strongly that San Francisco restaurants not accepting reservations are taking advantage of their diners in order to 'gin up' hype about popularity by artificially creating long lines, and/or are just lazy. Really - accepting reservations in the age of cloud services, such as Open Table, is inexpensive and requires minimal IT infrastructure or no IT knowledge.)\n\nNeeds-improvement:\n\n1. Sashimi and nigiri portion size - fish is cut consistently too small; considerably smaller than it should be, even considering the fair price.  \n\n2. Uneven service - either too much or too little attention.  And surprisingly, some of the staff provide inaccurate information about the fresh fish available on a given day from the Sushi chef, or the number of pieces in sashimi and nigiri portions.\n\nI do hope management takes action on the items needing improvement.  I will update this review if things get consistently better in both areas.   Until then, the search continues....", "author": "Sc. S."}

And I finally got to one afternoon, when I went for lunch. And sadly, it will be my last visit to Takara Sushi because it's just not worth a return visit.\n\nMy objection is not to their fish, which is the best I've had in the neighborhood. It was fresh and generally delicious. But they are stingy! \n\nTheir rolls are cut very small, so that each individual sushi peace is about a centimeter shorter than what is standard. I've noticed lower-end restaurants do this so that they can still give you six pieces, but they save on sunk costs by using less fish. But Takara is not a lower-end place: one roll was $6 and their special rolls were in the $9-$14 range. Their special rolls are also not much larger than a standard roll, so I have a hard time accounting for the price differential.\n\nFinally, this place lost me because I left hungry after spending $35 for lunch. While their fish might be better than their local competitors, they give you so little of it that I'm not sure it's worth the trade off.", "author": "P Z."}

The fish was delicious, tender and fresh.  It melted in our mouths!\n\nSpicy tuna on crispy rice: I LOVE this stuff.  This is one of the things I miss most about getting sushi in LA and was very pleased that, not only does Takara make this, but it makes it well!\n\nYellowtail and scallion roll: Fresh and delicious!  Very simple, but quite good:)\n\nMy only gripe is that the portions are small compared to the price.

My boyfriend and I love sushi and in the past year and a half have been to about 20 sushi places, so when we were planning our first night I tore through multiple reviews trying to find a great restaurant to try. \n\nThe fish was very fresh, possibly the freshest sushi I've ever had. Once you develop a taste for sushi you can really tell the difference in the quality of the fish and learn how much that matters. That was the biggest selling point and one of the reasons I'm giving them a 4 star review. \n\nThe service was good, but in the tradition of Asian restaurants it was very hands off. They brought what we needed when we flagged them down, although they might have been more attentive if we'd come earlier. We were the last customers to arrive so they were closing down as we ate.\n\nThe flavors of the rolls weren't the most creative I've ever had. There could have been more variety and more flavor. That's really what lost them the last star and was the major drawback.\n\nCastro is always a great neighborhood to wander around before and after dinner, very cute and entertaining-as long as you're open-minded.\n\nI'd suggest it, but not worth a trip specifically to Castro if you wouldn't enjoy the area.", "author": "Alicia C."}

I was seated across the aisle from a table of about eight twentysomethings who were inordinately loud and who spent 'way too much time discussing who had vomited and passed out on New Year's Eve.  If the servers had asked this table to keep their voices down a bit I would have been grateful, but that may be asking too much.   Unfortunately, it did not make for a pleasant dining experience.\n\nTakara was a mixed bag for me.  There were two servers, a man and a woman, who seemed to alternate at my table.  I ordered sushi and miso soup.  I began to become uncomfortable when I had to remind the waitress twice about the soup.  After a long wait in which no one appeared to give me more tea or bring my soup, the sushi finally arrived.  I reminded the male server--this is three times now--about the @$!! miso soup.  He produced a bowl quickly, but I should have just canceled it.\n\nThe sushi was good and the presentation was lovely.  It is, as others have observed, on the price-y side.  Both the tea and the soup were very watery--the tea so much that I would have taken it for hot water if I hadn't seen it poured.\n\nI'll be back, particularly since I live two blocks away and I would love dearly for Takara to tighten things up a bit.

I've eaten here about 4x now, and I've enjoyed every meal! \n\nSashimi is always fresh, and they have a pretty good selection of food options to choose from. Here are some of the items I've had:\n- Volcano Roll (5 stars): Eel/mango/tuna/salmon with some crispy flakes. Yum! Doesn't look like a traditional roll, but under all the crispy flakes, you'll find the delicious pieces of sushi, don't worry.\n- Summer Roll (3.5 stars): A bit plain, but I like it when I'm trying to go for something simple and lighter since it's wrapped with soy paper and doesn't have any extravagant sauces on it.\n- Dinosaur Roll (4 stars): Soft-shell crab goodness! Sometimes the soft shell crab is prepared better than others, but overall a solid roll.\n- Spicy Tuna Hand Roll (5 stars): Good tuna with a perfect amount of spiciness.\n- Eggplant Special (5 stars): Super delicious combo of scallop/eggplant/shrimp! Spicy miso sauce gives each bite a nice kick.\n- Tempura Udon (2 stars): I got this via delivery since I was craving noodles so might not be a right indicator of the actual dish. But it didn't taste like anything special, and I would've liked a better assortment of tempura.\n- Salmon sashimi appetizer (4 stars): Very smooth, but I usually let the bf eat all of this since it's his fave type of sashimi.\n\nAdditional pluses: I've never had to wait for a seat, and the prices are decent (prob can get out of here paying between $15-20/person). The restaurant provides free edamame beans before your meal (love it because I always feel cheated when places try to sell me a tiny plate of edamame for $5), and the waiters are super attentive in refilling tea. Seriously, I don't think my tea cup has ever gone empty... they definitely have some magic tea radar up in here.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

They look like food that would cost a lot more than it actually does. They are not stingy about the Uni and other expensive seafood are used in the sushi. The seafood are super fresh all the time. You could tell by eating them without any sauce.  They still taste sweet.  The most important thing is the creative ideas and unique combination of the food in this restaurant. I have been so disappointed with all other Japanese restaurants in Bay area. \n\n If I am paying the money to eat at a restaurant, I am not just expecting to eat rolls, noodles and teriyaki chicken or a simple smoke salmon rice dish. Right, they do tastes good and are very filling but these are the cheapest food which don't require fresh seafood and expensive ingredients.   You can easy make these at home and get pretty decent rolls from Safeway.  Why not save your money?   Everything with the japanese Mayo which has lots of MSG, and Unagi (the preservative eel) will never taste bad.  If I am paying to eat at a restaurant, I am looking for fresh seafood and special food.  If you want to try Japanese food at a different level, i highly recommend Takara Sushi.", "author": "Angel Y."}

Now I'm not saying Takara was bad, but it just didn't quite match up to my expectations. \n\nTakara kinda reminds me of your girlfriend's hot younger sister. She's banging. She dresses better. She's spunky and has a bubbly outgoing personality. You like everything about her... physically. But at the end of the day, you'd rather go back to your girlfriend because you realize she's way more amazing than this spunkier new thang. Not only does she provide more sustenance, but younger sister just doesn't quite have that \"je ne sais quoi\" that you're so crazy about and have been accustomed to for the past 3 years. And that's basically how I felt about Takara. The interior was banging. It definitely was trendier than my favorite Japanese spot, not to mention their sleek and modern looking bathroom. I must've spent 20 minutes in there not because of bodily malfunctions, rather because it was so chic with it's dim lights, slow flowing facet and dark granite walls. Talk about total sophistication! \n\nHowever when it was time to eat, that definitely was a different story. Sustenance lacked. I'm crazy about cheesy tonkatsu, however theirs didn't quite have that oozy gooey cheesy perfection that cheesy tonkatsu should have. Rather they skimped on the cheese, leaving my tonkatsu shameful. I also ordered \"The Bomb,\" which definitely was a bomb of crap in my mouth. The flavors of the different fish and sauces just didn't quite compliment each other. The excess raw fish laid on top of the roll along with a clump of mystery sauce felt like a pile of mush in my mouth. However, despite the dissatisfaction I felt towards the plates I ordered, I did enjoy pieces from my lover's bento box, so I'm not 100% completely mad at Takara. I will only venture back at Takara if it's not upon my behalf, other than that, back to my favorite Japanese spot.", "author": "Ally C."}

I hope they figure things out because the staff seemed like very nice people. \n\nThe evening started with the host confused about where we should sit.  After looking at his watch and glancing at his supervisor, he moved us to the other side of the restaurant; no big.  \n\nWe ordered a King California roll, two spider hand rolls, a spicy tuna hand roll, two bowls of miso, and two glasses of water.  The crab in the King California roll had a strange texture and didn't taste that great.  The spicy tuna hand roll came 10 minutes after the first part of the meal.  We thought they forgot it, and when it came it had too much batter to actually taste anything.  The spicy tuna roll was ok.  The miso was good.  Finally, the water never came :(. \n\nThe overall experience was awkward at best.  The interior of the restaurant is nice, through it seemed a bit too rigid.  The wait staff seemed to have no clue what was going on.  After the lead wait staff person asked how our evening went, I explained the issues.  If anything, I hope they can improve.  It has the potential to be a cool place to eat, but they need to improve some things.  I ended up eatting only one of the pieces of sushi and a bit of the spider roll to taste it;  I am still hungry.  Two stars for now, but I will try again in a couple of months if the restaurant lasts. \n\nThe positives: free green tea (yummie), free edamame (it was warm but good), and the bathroom was very clean.  \n\nThe best part is the host delivered our check with a quiet \"I am so sorry.\"  \n\nBest of luck to your new business.", "author": "Brian S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-12-20", "description": "There are three things I look for in sushi: perfect rice, fresh fish, slices that are decently sized and sensitively shaped.  In this regard, Takara is a failure. Sadly, for I like the neighborhood (it's mine), and the sitting space has its own funky charms. Details?  The rice was old, flavorless, clumpy and dry; it should have been moist with evenly cooked grains gently sticking to each other.  The  fish itself was half fresh, half a bit leathery and quite dull looking.  Worse was the slicing, which was amateurish: The fish came out chunky and uneven and in one case butchered (parts of a white fish were dangling like broken limbs). As my dinner companion noted, the preparation was \"disrespectful to the fish.\"(For another day--can I be respectful to fish and eat them at the same time?)   Adding to the disappointment was the miso, which had little flavor except for an inauthentic bitterness. Was it powdered miso? And the bowl that it was served were beaten, cheap and scary.\n\n\nWhy then didn't I give the place one star?  Well, some of the sushi pieces were fresh and the sizes were generous. Also I was there on a rainy night so I got warm sake for a buck. Even for mediocre sake, you can't beat that.\n\nAdded note: I often to to a restaurant believing yelp reviewers who tossed around, no doubt too casually, the word 'great.\"  There as nothing great here, but it leads me to wonder what  leads them to write that way.

While you can't swing a dead cat around the Castro without hitting a crazy queer or two (don't be offended, I'm one myself), all the swinging pussy in the world won't hit a truly good sushi joint here.  Nevertheless, Takara was a welcome addition to the neighborhood since it's rolls make the competition look (and taste) like cat food.  However, after my experience tonight, I can post nothing else.  This party of one (my, myself & ...) drop in for a quick spicy tuna roll & a Sapporo before I head home to be domestic.  I ordered & waited.  ...  After about 5 minutes 2 guys sit at the table next to me & order a few rolls (including a spicy tuna roll).  I know this not because I'm an eavesdropping weirdo, but because the tables are close together.  (The rating has nothing to do with this, as it actually adds to the charm of the atmosphere of this small but cute establishment).  So, long story short, my roll goes to the other guys.  It's written on my server's face that she knows this (and the fact that she is telling the chef to make a spicy tuna roll very quickly kind of gives it away too).  Nonetheless, instead of just coming over to explain what happened, she avoids me trying to buy time.  Eventually I became fed up with waiting more than 20 mins for a spicy tuna roll (especially as I was watching someone else eat my roll).  So, I canceled my roll, paid for the beer and bounced.

The gyoza were a normal sized portion, but alas, they weren't very good-- a bit dry, lacking in fresh pork flavor, and no sesame oil. The rolls were also average in taste and VERY tiny. The one thing that was outstanding at Takara was the quality of the sashimi. Excellent! But unfortunately, the fish was sliced incredibly thin and you are served only four of the thin pieces per $10 order. It's really too bad because they DELIVER as well!
