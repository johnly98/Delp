There were several parties ahead of us and we had to wait at the lounge for 30 minutes for our table, but the atmosphere was pleasant and we enjoyed the time. When our table is ready, a lady server led us to the table. It was a booth facing the sea view. It was good but since I saw there was a table open next to the window, I asked her if it is OK for us to have that table of six instead. She quickly checked with the manager and gladly gave us the table! The view was gorgeous.\n\nCurtiss was our server and he was courteous and very detailed to share with us the menu items and open to us about his recommendation without imposing on us. We had a whole garlic crab, a pescatore pasta, and the famous clam chowder on review. The crab was not big but the taste is good and cooked just right. The pescatore is super delicious with scallops, prawns, mussels and clams. Although it is a little pricey. The clam chowder was very good. The taste is right, not too salty like most restaurants would have it, right amount of clams and potatoes, not to thick or thin. We all feel we want more of the chowder at the end. We had a very enjoyable evening. We like the place, the atmosphere, the view, the people, the service and the food. This is a place I would enjoy coming with friends regularly.", "author": "Ed C."}

I had heard and read stellar reviews of the restaurant so I was really looking forward to it. I think 3 stars is right on, as I wasn't necessarily disappointed with my experience, but it's wasn't anything to write home about either.\n\nThe best parts about the restaurant are the wait staff and the views of the bay. The staff is extremely friendly and accommodating, and the large windows in the dining room ensure most tables have a great view of the bay and golden gate bridge. This is a great addition to the touristy area of Pier39, and I would say probably the best restaurant in the area. However, even for a \"tourist trap\" area, I was still surprised at some of the prices for the entrees, especially for A) the portion size and B) the quality. I wound up ordering the muscles and fries off the appetizer menu as an entr\u00e9e, and have definitely had better in the city, even at non-seafood restaurants. I sampled the crab cakes and seafood sampler from others in our party and they were just a-OK. All in all, a great place for apps/drinks and to take in a view when you're in the neighborhood, but nothing I would make a cross-town, weeks in advance reservation for.", "author": "Kathryn P."}

We ordered our food fairly quickly as well. \n\nWe hardly saw our server after that. One of our guests ordered the crab which was delivered (by someone other than our server) with no way to eat it. It took close to 10 minutes for us to be able to flag someone down to get the correct utensils. \n\nOur beverages remained empty from before our food was delivered until we left. Never once asked if we wanted another. Never asked if we had everything we needed. Our server never even stood at our table long enough to get a drink order in after taking our original order.

I had the crab risotto and it was delicious and creamy, the scallops were cooked well. \n\nFor the price of this meal, I was severely disappointed in the service we received.

Some type of authentic ethnic food (i.e. Italian, Chinese, Thai, Soul, etc.) or you think of seafood! This time around, my co-workers said SEAFOOD! Although Fog Harbor is pretty commercial and crowded, they do an excellent job with their service, food, and handling the crowds. There wasn't any point in time where I felt rushed or felt like they saw me as \"just a customer.\" \n\nAs you can see from the pics the portions where significant, it had great flavor, and you could tell the seafood was fresh. Of all the seafood places I have been in the Bay Area, I would put Fog Harbor at the top and I would definitely go back. \n\nA word to the wise, if you go around dinnertime, plan accordingly, you are going to wait minimum 30-1 hour, so be prepared. \n\nThanks Fog Harbor, really good food and service!", "author": "Damion W."}

Our request was honored and it was a beautiful day so we had a nice few of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\nWe started with a bowl of clam chowder and some bread and butter. The chowder was really tasty. I just recently started eating clam chowder so I don't have many points of reference. But the flavor was nice not too heavy. We also had margaritas they were ok not really  strong tasted mostly like the mixer. \n\nWe ordered the Fried combo and the seafood platter for our meals. The seafood platter was a nice serving of crab, shrimp, mussels, and clams with potatoes all topped with lots of garlic butter. Talk about an explosion of flavor. Seasoned really well plenty of garlic in the butter. The platter was so good I wanted more. \n\nThe fried combo did not disappoint either. The calamari was fried nicely as well as the fish and shrimp. Of course the prices are on the higher end, but it was worth every penny.", "author": "Ty S."}

Since a friend and I were going to be at Fisherman's Wharf, I suggested doing a seafood dinner at Pier 39. I made a reservation through Yelp for a party of two about a week prior for Thursday, September 27th at 7pm. We showed up a few mins early and had to wait for a little bit. We were seated about 10 mins after our reservation at a table by the window, so we had a nice view.\n\n*Red Chili Garlic Shrimp: Red chili paste, onions, peppers and garlic ($16)\n*AWARD WINNING CLAM CHOWDER ($9 Bowl)\n*Garlic Roasted Whole Dungeness Crab: Served with vegetables and roasted fingerling potatoes and butter ($45)\n*Ultimate Dirty Martini: Tito's Vodka, dry vermouth, olive juice and a blue cheese stuffed olive ($14)\n*Barrel Aged Manhattan: (Up) Bulliet Bourbon, Carpano Antica Formula Sweet Vermouth house aged in 5 liter oak barrels ($14)\n*Duckhorn: Napa Valley, California '17 ($50)\n\nI wanted the crab and clam chowder. Since my friend and I always over order, we added the shrimp. The clam chowder was nice and creamy with a good amount of clams. A little thicker than I prefer, but still a good bowl. The crab was a little disappointing. There wasn't enough garlic flavor. Plus, the best part of the crab, the head, was missing. It was just an empty shell for decoration. If a restaurant states a whole crab, I think that should include the head. The shrimp were okay. Had a nice heat, but I didn't really like the sauce. A little too sweet for me. Dinner came with complimentary Bread & Butter, which was good for soup dipping.\n\nService here was nice and friendly. They were busy cuz there was a convention in town, so there were times when we had to flag down our server. The wine was good and paired well with our food. Both cocktails were okay. A little light for my tastes, but at least the pricing wasn't too bad.\n\nA nice dinner for a touristy spot, but the food was a little underwhelming. 3 stars.", "author": "Elena N."}

Not much else. I can see why they won their awards, for the sourdough bread bowl was fantastic (even my father-in-law loved it), and the chowder was excellent and well-balanced, rich with flavor and clam and just enough other potato and other veggies to keep it from being simply soup. The sourdough bread was a great starter, too. Will have to try the other seafood meals here later!\n\nAnd the view of the pier and water was great.

No doughs about that. Our server was amazing and super awesome. I forgot her name but she was so attentive despite it being a full house. \nThe food itself was a letdown. We ordered the clam chowder, half dozen orders and the seafood platter with add on lobster tail in herbs and butter. The entire meal was pretty much a miss for me. Let me explain fish by dish:\n\nChowder - they added bacon to it. I love bacon and yet bacon couldn't save this dish for me. It just tasted weird like they added lemon to it or something. It had a sour undertone for a cream soup but it didn't taste spoiled.\n\nOysters - these were pretty fresh and local according to our server. No clue what they were though but they were tiny. Decent though and my fave for the night.\n\nThe seafood platter was huge and came with dungeoness crabs, mussels, clams, jumbo shrimp, and fingerling potatoes, plus one lobster tail add on. \n\nThe lobster was pretty bad. The texture was obviously over cooked and very dry. The crabs while a lot (and usually I'd be jumping with joy) was pretty dry and overdone. So we're the clams. Only the mussels and shrimps were cooked just right. Maybe it's because they baked this dish and over did it but I think steaming it would have preserved the sweetness and juiciness of the dish. \n\nTax and tip came out to be $170 USD. Really not worth it in my opinion. Not because of portion because we were full but because it just wasn't very tasty. We wanted fresh juicy seafood in SF and instead got over cooked dry seafood that could have been previously frozen for all we know. \n\nThis might have been a one off experience but being out of town, this was our first and def our last experience there. Again, great vibes and service just not IT for the seafood experience.", "author": "Rainie L."}

It contained just six large shrimp, tossed with thin slices of onions and bell peppers in an intense chili sauce. Although I enjoyed the spicy flavors and tingling heat, I didn't find that it was the best value.  I also couldn't help but try a cup of their award-winning clam chowder ($7), which was so creamy and had large meaty clam pieces. Yum, this is a must!  \n\nFor my entree, I went with a lighter plate, being the Seared Pacific Cod ($28). The fish was seared perfectly with a golden brown, slightly crisp top. It was served with white beans, chorizo butter, tomatoes and spinach, then finished with a dab of garlic shallot aioli. The aioli added an extra layer of flavor to an already savory plate and I loved the white beans as an alternative for a starch. With the Cod placed on top of it all, it was truly the highlight of the dish. Two of my family members ordered the Mixed Grill, which was a combo of salmon, cod and shrimp served with vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. They enjoyed their entrees as well.\n\nThis was easily one of the best seafood meals my family had in years. \nThank you to Fog Harbor for such a memorable dinner to start off our visit to San Francisco on the right foot!\n\n4.5 stars.", "author": "Courtney L."}

I yelped the highest rated place and BOOM! Fog Harbor Fish House was just the right place. I believe the bar is the only area where you can order the happy hour specialty items \n\nWe had the crispy lemon calamari, New England clam chowder in a bowl, and two glasses of wine. The calamari was perfectly cooked and tender with a crispy exterior. I devoured the clam chowder--abundant amount of clams in the soup and the bread was kept warm due to the soup. I love sourdough bread so this was a perfect addition to our meal.

I've had the opportunity to dine formally and at the bar at different locations. FHFH is on the second floor and you'll see it from the central location of The Wharf. When you walk up the stairs you'll see an outdoor waiting area with a fireplace where you can wait for your table. You'll be able to check-in with the main host there as well.\n\nIf you're looking to skip the line and simply want to grab a bite to eat, as well as, drinks then walk on in to the bar. The bar area is open seating and it's first come first serve. You can enjoy the full menu of FHFH at the bar so that's always a win! No need to worry about a dedicated bar menu.\n\nWhen you're deciding what to eat make sure to take a look at their seasonal menu.\n\nI have to tell y'all though...\nIf you don't grab a bowl of their clam chowder, then you're doing yourself an injustice. Their clam chowder is so good you'll be licking the plate clean. You have to add crab meat to the chowder which takes it to the next level. You get such huge chunks of clam and the crab meat for $7 is A STEAL. Pretty sure you're getting way more for your buck without the messiness of opening crab legs yourself.\n\nAlthough I didn't order this due to the limitation of available space in my stomach (you can only loosen your belt so much) I have ordered their Signature Shellfish Tower which is served cold but includes lobster, dungeness crab, shrimp, and oysters. A great appetizer to order for a party of 4 alongside some of their other apps.\n\nThe few dishes I've had there have all been great, but the service is what keeps me coming back for more. Although you may be situated within a highly trafficked tourist area, they don't take advantage of you. They treat each table with pride and they take the time to make sure you have a great dining experience.\n\nSadly every time I've gone I've yet to learn my lesson to make room for dessert when they bring around the dessert presentation.

I've been here so many times with my family because we really do enjoy eating here. It's our to go restaurant whenever we are adventuring around the Pier or craving clam chowder. I'm from Stockton and yes, we really do drive to SF sometimes just to eat here lol!\n\nI've tried countless of restaurants in SF that serves clam chowder, and I think Fog Habor have the best ones! + adding crab meat makes it extra delicious! Is definitely worth it to get the shellfish platter or tower if you're into seafood! A great variety and nice portion. The salsa dipping sauce that came with the Shellfish Tower was to die for. It's mixed very well with the touch of crab meat too. I love crab meat as you can tell lol! I love French fries as well, so I decided to try the Mussel Fries starter and I think the most tasty thing of it wasn't the mussels and fries alone, it was the creamy white sauce they used with it. Very different but I like. \n\nThe servers here are sooo sweet and friendly. They're the ones to lit up the atmosphere of the restaurant. I never once experienced bad service here. \n\nI think the only con here is the waiting. It's usually very busy on weekends and especially during dinner hours, which is when I'm usually here lol.

I've celebrated many birthdays, anniversaries, and valentine's days here. I've always sat near the windows for a beautiful view of the water. My absolute favorites on the menu would have to be the award winning clam chowder.  The calamari is one of the best I've tried, and I'm a huge sea food lover. It's paired with fried onions and jalape\u00f1os. The dipping is a creamy aioli sauce that truly brings out the flavor of the calamari. For the entree, I usually order the linguini and clams. The amount of clams that's served is unbelievable! If you aren't in the mood for something super heavy, I would go with this dish to satisfy any seafood cravings. It also comes with a slice of garlic bread that pairs really well with the sauce. My family is a huge fan of the shellfish platter. Although it's a bit on the pricier end, it encompasses all the seafood favorites that anyone can ever wish for in a meal! Mussels, clams, shrimp, and half a Dungeness crab. \n\nPrice & Portions:\nClam chowder: I usually go with a cup, but for an additional $2 you can get a large bowl to share between 2-3 people!\nCalamari: I would say for a $15 plate, it can comfortably serve 3-4 people as a starter dish! \nLinguini and clams: Not a lot of pasta, but still quite filling. $20\nShellfish platter: ~$50 for a sizable amount of seafood\n\nOverall opinion: \nIf you're ever on Pier 39, this is a must-try, not only is the food delicious  but the ambiance is one of a kind.

Wowza, I could see why! Forget Boudin, this is the winner right here. They give you so much variety and freshness of seafood in this bowl of goodness right here. Plus, no need for a bread bowl when they serve complimentary sourdough bread for the table. IMO, dipping the bread and soaking up all the chowder flavor is much better than having a bread bowl. Mmm!\n\n* Jumbo Scallop & Crab Risotto ($35) - SEASONAL ITEM. Wow again. These were some of the best scallops I've ever had in my life. They were so buttery and juicy and perfectly seared. The risotto was creamy and the crab made it even more flavorful. The dab of pesto was a nice touch. \n\n* Cioppino ($34) - Ok to be fair, by the time this came out, I had stuffed myself silly with sourdough bread and the above two dishes. This was still amazing though. Very flavorful and wonderfully decorated with an abundant of seafood. No tough pieces, everything F R E S H.

Don't let the high number of reviews misguide you like it did for us.  My girlfriends and I were in town and wanted to check this place out.  The seafood platter looked AMAZING in pictures so thats what I had set my heart on.  We were seated at a table when we noticed another table right by the window was vacant.  We wanted to move tables so we flagged someone down who said he would go talk to our server or hostesses for us.  We waited and waited when finally the hostess walks in and seats another family at the table we were eyeing for 10 minutes for.  When she turns around to walk past our table, she stops and smiles at us and simply says, \"sorry girls, I know you wanted that table.\"  Okay?  If you KNEW we wanted that table and we were seated first, wouldn't you think the kind thing to do is to seat that family at the vacant table behind us and move us to the table by the window?  I mean... we did ask, we did wait.. and after all that, all you can do is smile at us with a comment like that?  Alright then.  That literally ruined our mood for the rest of the meal.  Shitty customer service to start off our experience right.  Anyways, our server FINALLY showed his face and took our order.  While we were waiting for the food to come out, ANOTHER table by the window opened up.  It needed to cleared still but we kindly asked our server if we could move to that table instead.  All he said was that we needed to ask the hostesses.  A good server would go ask for his table but nope, he wanted us to go instead.  If you dined here before, you know how big this restaurant is.  He can't just go ask for us?  I've been a server before and if I knew my table wasn't given a table by the window the first time around but another one opened up, I would've gone and asked before they asked me.  Well, we didnt go ask.  When it was clear that he wanted US to go instead, we said forget it.  This place sucks, lets just eat and leave.  It would've been slightly better if the food was AMAZING but it was merely just mediocre at its best.  Nothing wow-ed us and definitely wasn't worth the price or our time we spent here.  Our server forgot to give us the tools to open up the crab legs and barely checked up on us to the point all three of our water glasses were completely empty.

We got the crispy calamari to start along with the jumbo shrimp cocktail and clam chowder. The crispy calamari had good flavor, but the fried batter came off the calamari very easily and was a little difficult to pick up. The batter was also a little too thick and hard, not quite airy and crispy. The shrimps seemed pretty fresh and it was tasty with the sauce, but I noticed that a couple shrimps weren't deveined very cleanly and had bits of black left. The chowder was decent. It had a lot of ingredients, but it was a bit too salty and thick for me. \n\nThe most disappointing dish, however, was the main. I got the scallops and crab risotto that was on the seasonal menu. I love all of those so I was very excited about it. However, I'm not sure if the scallops weren't fresh, if it was the type of scallop used, or if it wasn't prepared properly, but it had a very strong fishy taste that was very off putting. The scallops also looked like it had been seared so I was looking forward to that texture, but they were just wet and soft.

Sweet!\n\nWe got to the Pier and realized it was on the 2nd floor of the little shopping area, but luckily there was an escalator (and we found out later an elevator) to get my kiddo's stroller up there.  Traveling with kids makes things a bit tricky sometimes, but getting to this restaurant is manageable.  They do ask that you park your stroller outside in their pretty little sitting area though and the hostesses will keep an eye on it for you.\n\nWe didn't have a reservation, but were seated right away and it seemed like we came in right before the dinner rush.  Perfect timing as always!  The restaurant has big, beautiful windows and our table looked out into Pier 39.  Now THIS is the way to enjoy the pier without having to deal with the wind and cold, folks. It was a cold, cold day and the warm restaurant was a welcomed reprieve.\n\nThe menu offers a solid seafood selection with specials featured on a separate menu.  I ordered the lazy cioppino (recommended by our waiter vs. the regular cioppino) which was an added $5.  I really wanted seafood and I figured this is the best way to get a taste of a little bit of everything!  My husband went with our waiter's suggestion as well -- the Alaskan Halibut which came with pearl couscous, angula pesto, and a balsamic glaze.  Apparently it's only available 1 month out of the year.\n\nOur food came out quickly and from the moment we dug into our meal to the very last bite, we were ooooo-ing and aaaahh-ing.  Getting my cioppino \"lazy\" was totally worth it.  I didn't have to spend time trying to break the crab legs and digging the meat out which often times is frustrating for me.  I just want to eat!  Lol.  The scallops were cooked perfectly, the crab delicious, and all the flavors married well.  I'm more of a white / cream sauce type of girl, but the tomato broth was really delicious and had a bit of a kick to it as well.  My husband absolutely loved his dish.  He noted that it needed a bit of salt, but concluded that it was the best fish he's probably ever had.  As a cook himself, he can sometimes be critical of restaurants, but not this time.  Our bellies were full and praises were sung.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised and impressed with our experience.  Our waiter was so attentive and never left us waiting or wanting.  He came out with the dessert menu, which is actual examples of the desserts arranged on a tray, but I was full and content.\n\nI would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to try fresh seafood with a great view!

The exterior of the bread was still nice and crunchy and the inside was soft like marshmallows. The clam chowder had chunks of potatoes, bits of chopped clam and also had a rich tasting cream broth. The juices from clams and cream were in perfect harmony which provided that sweet and savory component to the dish. I very much enjoyed since I am a huge sourdough fanatic.

The accompanying fries, however, are some of the worst I've ever come across.  You may want to think twice about the old fish and chips option.\n\nI will give them kudos on one thing.  Someone at our table had an allergy and they went above and beyond to ensure her safety.  To the point of reading the ingredients of the ingredients.  So thank you for that.\n\nService is always good and the majority of the tables ensure a good view of the water.", "author": "Nicole L."}

The butter was perfectly salted and room temperature which I love. I ordered the half soup/salad. I got the Cesar salad with clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. It was more than filling I wasn't able to finish it all. Good thing I had my husband there to help me out. \n\nMy husband ordered the Ahi Tuna entree which he let me have a little of. The Ahi tuna was seared and coated with sesame seeds but rare on the inside. It had great flavor and melted in your mouth. It was served with rice with an amazing soy/lime sauce that had a yummy smoky flavor. It was also served with vegetables. \n\nMy friend got the mixed grill which came with salmon, cod and shrimp along with grilled vegetables and mashed potatoes. \n\nWe all left very full and satisfied. \n\nThis restaurant has tons of yummy seafood options.

A tad salty but it did the job for me. They had a great selection of cocktails as well. I opted for fresh pisco sour which I thought was perfect for the sweet and salty flavors I was getting from both oysters and cod. The service was great too.

Great views, nicer decor and service (i.e., not a fast food joint), and serves seafood. Crab roll was average and the clam chowder was a disappointment. \n\nFog Harbor is everything you're looking for in a touristy trap restaurant. I've been told most locals tend to avoid Pier 39, and I was here with my partner who had never been to SF before, so we did the touristy things anyway. Going to Pier 39, I wanted to take her someplace that had seafood (we're literally on the ocean after all), someplace that wasn't a fastfood-y type of establishment (see flash fried everything), and something with good views if possible. All of this was found perfectly inside Fog Harbor. What you won't find here though is mind-blowingly good food, however. We ordered the crab ceviche, \"Award winning\" clam chowder, and a crab roll. \n\nI don't particularly like crab ceviche in general, so I won't review it. But the \"Award winning\" clam chowder was a huge let down. As we were waiting in the front of the establishment for a table to open up, they proudly displayed their award for \"Best clam chowder\" in fisherman's warf. Makes me wonder what the competition was like. But it was a bit thicker and more flour-y than I typically like, and really lacked any real flavor beyond general salt and pepper. Wished it was more creamy with a more pronounced clam flavor. The crab roll was served a giant grilled roll which was soft and buttery. The crab filling was rather generic with VERY shredded crab that was mixed in with seemed like mayo (menu said it was an aioli) and some celery. Served cold, it did go well with their fries which were solidly above average.\n\nInside the restaurant, the decor was very upscale casual, in that it was very upscale without making me feel I was underdressed in my khaki shorts and t-shirt. More impressively, most of the outward facing walls were primarily windows, and seats not up against the windows were elevated, so that every seat in the place could get a decently good view of the bay. All in all, the location itself provided everything a tourist may look for when prioritizing the experience over the food, and it does it well, hence the 4 * rating.", "author": "Wells L."}

We ordered the Fish & Chips and their specialty Clam Chowder in a Bread Bowl + added crab. \n\nEverything came super hot and fresh, smelling super delicious. Since we told our waiter that we were sharing, he graciously split it into two plates for us already.

We can't remember the last time we came out here but decided to go enjoy the fresh seafood San Francisco has to offer. Fog Harbor Fish House was the top of all the Pier 39 restaurant lists that I saw and that's where we stopped for lunch after checking out the aquarium. \n\nThe restaurant was located on the second floor, across from the aquarium exit (how convenient). It's also next to the California Welcome Center so stop by there as well to get a one hour free parking validation and coupon book. The coupon book included a free garlic blue cheese appetizer with purchase of any entree that you could use. Fog Harbor also provides one hour of parking validation for the garage across the street.\n\nAt a little after 11am on a Sunday (on Pride weekend too), there was no wait. You can make reservations ahead of time online but it's limited. The restaurant actually saves most of their tables for walk in guests. The restaurant did get pretty crowded by the time we left and there were people waiting outside for their table. \n\nWe had a table by the window and had a great view of the pier and Golden Gate Bridge. Their menu is pretty extensive but I had a chance to look on Yelp ahead of time to plan out what I wanted to order.\n\nFor a party of 4 adults and 1 toddler, we ordered the following items:\n- crab cakes\n- calimari\n- 2 bowls of the clam chowder (+ added the Dungeness crab)\n- shellfish platter for 2\n- whole garlic roasted Dungeness crab\n\nThe freshly made sourdough bread was warm and delicious. It tasted even better when dipped in the garlic butter from the shellfish platter or roasted garlic Dungeness crab. Overall, everything tasted good considering this is a touristy area. The shellfish platter and Dungeness crab are good picks for said fans. Like I said earlier, it's the roasted garlic and garlic butter  that makes the difference and I'm not even a seafood fan. While the clam chowder was nice and creamy, it was pretty heavy and filling as well. I wouldn't opt for their bread bowl since you're already given sourdough bread. The only disappointing item we ordered would probably have to be the crab cakes. I wasn't a fan of the crab filling.\n\nOur server was friendly but kinda left us alone after our main entrees came out. We had to ask about our appetizers towards the end because he forgot about them. Luckily, it didn't take too long before they came out.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty child friendly. You can park your strollers out front, they have highchairs for toddlers, changing area in the restrooms, and crayons and coloring sheets for the little ones. That alone distracted my toddler long enough to enjoy our meal. \n\nWhile I'm probably unlikely to come back again unless I'm showing out of town visitors around SF, I would recommend others to come here if they're looking for somewhere decent to eat around Pier 39. For what you pay for at Fog Harbor, you get fresh seafood, great views, and a nice dining environment.", "author": "Steph F."}

In the past, I haven't done my research and had less than awesome experiences here. Just because they all serve fish doesn't mean they all do it right! \n\nWe liked the menu and the establishment looked upscale so we decided to give Fog Harbor Fish House a try for dinner. We arrived without reservation (Thursday) and we had a 20 min wait. We decided to wait at the bar and my buddy tried a new type of whisky (Balvenie 17) per the bartender recommendation. He was stoked with it!\n\nThe table was ready soon after and we decided on the menu items. We shared the crab cakes starter, I had a bowl of chowder, and then the Seafood Mixed Grill. My buddy had the bread bowl chowder with crab as an entree. Let me tell you, everything was delicious! The crab cakes were cooked to perfection and had many levels of flavor. The chowder was among the best I've had, and the mixed grill was superb! The least favorite part was the mashed potatoes which were not quite creamy how I like best, but I was more than full by this time so it didn't matter much. \n\nThe service was excellent from bartender to server to farewell from the staff upon departure. I highly recommend Fog Harbor Fish House if you want top notch seafood at reasonable prices. Nothing to complain about here. Check it out!", "author": "Nathan L."}

My husband and I were probably the only two in the restaurant who were not tourists given this is located at Pier 39. We went last Friday and it is Lent, so I don't eat meat. The hub searched for seafood places and came across this place on Yelp with high ratings. It did not disappoint, and as a local, I'm glad. \n\nThe menu said that the clam chowder was award winning, so we had to try it. It was delicious --thick, creamy, flavorful, with big chunks of clam, not like other places that use extra potatoes for filler. $7 for a cup.\n\nMy husband had the Shellfish Platter (half crab, mussels, clams, & fingerling potatoes -$39 for one) and added a lobster tail (5-6oz, $24). He enjoyed all of it, but says the one thing he'd dock a star for is that the crab was a little dry. I had the Grilled Shrimp Brochette (sauteed spinach, butternut squash, garlic mashed potatoes, $22). The shrimp were a good size, it was flavorful, but a tad oilier than I like. \n\nYes, we had dessert! For him: Apple Crisp a la mode. For me: as if I'd have anything other than tiramisu. They were both very good. $9 each. The tiramisu was probably one of the best I've had-- creamy and not over-soaked w/ espresso & liqueur like many others. \n\nI'd give this probably 4 stars, however our server, Brianna (assuming that was her name-- it was on our receipt!), really made the difference. Add another star just for her. She was welcoming from the start, friendly, not pushy, and kept checking on us. What gave us a good chuckle was that as we were leaving, she she wished us a nice \"rest of your vacation,\" assuming we were tourists. We had a nice, quick chat w/ her and made our way out.

The chowder was rich and flavorful, the clams fresh and not rubbery, and the bread -- LORD -- the bread.\n\nOnce we came down from the high of the soup, I moved on to some of the best Fish & Chips that I have ever had, before or since.  The fish was fresh and flaky, the breading was thick but not greasy, and the tarter sauce was light and citrousy -- a great balance to the fish.\n\nThe culinary adventure continued on to dessert where we went with the Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding (fresh Boudin's sourdough bread, baked with banana and chocolate, topped with vanilla bean sauce) and it was OUT OF THIS WORLD!!!

Based on the plates passing by our table I knew I had to save room for my meal so I tried to show restraint.\n\nI ordered the Scallops with crab risotto. The scallops were large, fresh and perfectly seared. The lemon and white wine sauce they rested in was phenomenal. The risotto just wow. Risotto is easy to ruin but this one was creamy and flavorful. The sprouts in top gave added texture and the grape tomatoes provided the acid. The crab inside the risotto was from the claw which is my favorite. This crab was very fresh and not over cooked.

The decors were nice also, made it feel very cozy and christmasy. \n\nI really wanted to be blown away by the seafood here, and while most of it were pretty good, the crab (my fav part) was so disappointing.  We came in near closing time and the waiter asked if we wanted the crabs taken out of the shell for us, to make it easier/faster (either it's called \"lazy\" or \"lady\" version crabs) So i thought ok, so we wont be here all night cracking crabs! Big mistake! The stuff they put on top of the dish (crab meats) were not tasty at all, crushed my SF crab dreams. \n\nThe waiter was also extremely annoyed with our party (of 5). The entire time, we were sure he wanted to kill himself or us. Not the best service, but I can understand a little being it was late in the day/shift. But having been in the industry, you just dont give attitude of any sorts when you're serving others.  \n\nI'd just come here for a light bite or a coffee/bear, would go elsewhere for food/service.", "author": "Christine J."}

It was no rubbery because it was cooked to perfection. I also got one of their signature drinks, I don't remember the name, but it was a beautiful drink. My husband ended up getting the steak & lobster which he enjoyed as well as his drink of choice. We had room for dessert and I got the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and he got the tiramisu. \n\nThe service was fairly good, the waiter seemed like he didn't want to be there very much, but he was attentive to our needs.

The BF has had many bowls of clam chowder but I insisted that the best clam chowder I ever had was in San Francisco.\n\nSo when I was planning our trip to the bay, I had FHFH on my radar. Once we got to Fisherman's Wharf the BF and I waited for the place to open and were one of the first people there that day. Our server was super sweet and helpful. We ordered a bread bowl of clam chowder as well as the fried combo which came with fish, calamari, shrimp, fries, and cole slaw. Between the two of us the food was just the right amount of food to get us full. Our server was also kind enough to have the kitchen divide the fried combo into 2 plates for us. I paired my food with a glass of pinot grigio while the BF had a beer.\n\nI was so happy that the BF thought the clam chowder was delicious! Now, he will be biased against every bowl of clam chowder we encounter because it will never taste as good as Fog Harbor Fish House's. The fried seafood was also yummy! We want to try the rest of the menu if we get another chance to go. The view from our table was also grand. Getting to eat with a view of the harbor is serene and adds to the experience here.

However today I was deeply disappointed with their service. We had a few things to try and it was all pretty good. We had the award winning clam chowder, Dungeness crab cakes, raw oysters, jumbo scallop and crab risotto, and the ahi tuna. The clam chowder was definitely great, it was not too heavy but just enough, it had a great portion of bacon and all the good stuff. The crab cakes were good as well. I liked the scallop and crab risotto as well. But the service here, was just terrible. Our drinks were never refilled or asked if we wanted another drink. We had to ask for everything, straws, etc . Our table was never cleared at anytime either. All of our plates were just sitting on the table. I was stacking plates one on top of another to open up space. Even after we moved on from the apps to the dinner items everything was left behind, app plates, the empty app plates, the oysters, everything. The oyster dish was sitting on our table even when we left which we finished fairly quickly after they were dropped off at our table. The ice turned into water and the oyster shells were floating around in the dish. \n\nAfter paying $170+ dollars is this what I should expect? By all means I have no issue spending money on food. But it really just hits a nerve when I get crappy service and I'm paying for it.....\n\nI would go else where if your thinking about The Fog Harbor Fish House.", "author": "Mike N."}

Could have used a little more flavor but that's probably just me lol.. next time, i'll just ask to add garlic butter over the top.\n\nThe second time I sat towards the back of the restaurant, \"upstairs\". I ordered the Garlic Roasted Whole Dungeness Crab (ask for extra garlic butter, if you like a lot like me), which came with veggies and small roasted potatoes. That was definitely a plus because at any other restaurant i've been to an ordered a whole crab, it just comes with the crab.. nothing more!

The ambience, food and drink menu truly deliver a memorable experience. I recently spent a romantic dinner for one here while traveling alone in San Fran for work.\n\nThere are so many dining options in the area, that it's nearly impossible to choose just one. I walked around for nearly an hour before selecting Fog Harbor, which I decided upon because of its sustainable seafood menu, gluten free menu options (thumbs up for Celiac-friendly dining!) and scenic view (which I unfortunately didn't get to experience from my table).\n\nThe hostess suggested I sit at the bar since I was alone, but I requested a table. Who says you can't have a nice dinner by yourself? Seriously though, self care is important.\n\nThe main spacious main dining room offers scenic views of the Bay; it was crowded when I arrived, and I was seated in one of the side dining rooms. Unfortunately my table didn't offer any views, and the room was brightly lit with tables crowded near each other. I would have preferred a table with a better view in the main room, but I arrived late and was dining alone. You can't win them all!\n\nDuring my dinner I experienced excellent service, and my wine glass was never empty. The menu offers a diverse variety of seafood, and they bring you a pre-dinner bread basket (which I had to pass on, thanks to Celiac Disease). Since I was traveling and on a food tour of the city and had been eating all day, I selected a lighter option: The California Crab & Avocado Caesar Salad. I love fresh crab and this salad was loaded with toppings, dressing and the works!\n\nFor all you winos, they have an extensive wine list with local CA varieties and imports. I've been on a Malbec kick lately, so that was my drink of choice for the evening.\n\nDespite this restaurant being located in touristy area (next to freakin' Bubba Gumps -- so kitschy), Fog Harbor offers upscale dining, good wine and awesome views. Check it out the next time you're in town!", "author": "Stephanie S."}

You hit the mark.\n\nI don't dish out 5-stars lightly, but I'll give it to you. If the prices were like $5 cheaper and the seats a little farther apart you would be perfect, but hey I understand.

It's right down the street from our entertainment, SF Dungeon.\n\nWe made reservations for 5:00pm but our show ended much earlier (3:00pm). Instead of walking around or hitting a bar for 2 hours, we went to the restaurant to see if we could get seated early. When we mentioned our reservations, the lady at the front desk was all \"Soooooo you came now...?\" Obviously? But there were TONS of open tables. Who eats at 3:00pm??? But I bet if we actually arrived at the time of our reservations, we would've gotten a table by the window. Kinda disappointed about that but not the restaurant's fault.\n\nA coworker and I went directly up to the bar to order drinks because we wanted the drinks on a separate tab. I got the Lipstick Lemondrop and he had the Alcatraz Escape. Both were great. Couldn't taste alcohol at all but definitely felt it. I LOVE that.\n\nI got the Cioppino. At first I thought about getting the Lazy Cioppino (no shells), but part of the fun of seafood is eating with your hands! The scallops were HUGE! Do you see the chunk of white on the right of my picture?? That was one of the scallops!! The crabs were already cracked so it was easy to get the meat out. They provide the cracker and a tiny fork but I didn't need it at all. The fish they used was SALMON, my favorite! The tomato soup was DELICIOUS with chunks of tomato in it. $34 for all that? I'd say it was definitely worth it.\n\nI also tried some of my coworker's Lobster Tail, which I was also contemplating but my Cioppino was DEFINITELY the winner. The Lobster Tail was way smaller than I expected, and kinda dry. The melted butter didn't help very much with flavor.\n\nWe wrapped it up with dessert. I thought the way they present dessert was VERY smart. They have all their desserts brought to you on a tray, then they introduce each one. I asked our waiter what he recommends personally and we ended up with two: House-made Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee and Strawberry Shortcake. The brulee was good, but the shortcake was better IMO. Super soft shortcake with whipped cream and fruits drowning in syrup. Not SUPER sweet either.\n\nThe only thing I regret now is my coworkers knowing how much I eat...", "author": "Athena C."}

Our waiter was energetic and eager to get us started on the right foot. The menu stays the same regardless of lunch or dinner... although I was kinda in the mood for something \"brunchy\". But not to be discouraged.. I went with (well, the three of us) the clam chowder- when in Rome!! My sister and I both added the crab meat to our dishes as well. The chowder was everything we wanted and more. Full of seafood and not too heavy. Paired with their fantastic house-baked bread... I'm drooling as we speak. \n\nI would have liked slightly more options for a midday treat but overall, a great spot. And the place is huge!!", "author": "Jessica P."}

There's so much flavor & mashed potatoes & asparagus to \nAccompany the seafood. Their mussel fries are a MUST DO, so much deliciousness in a bowl & make sure to get extra bread to dip in the broth afterwards. We basically lick our plates clean.

The wait on a Saturday afternoon was about 45 minutes. They take your name and will text you to start heading down to the resteraunt because your name will be called soon. When we arrived back someone tried to take our seats. They pronounced the name wrong so it was hard to recognize but I went up anyways to double check. Be careful and pay attention seems like some people are just rude and try and say they are that person unless your slick enough and pay attention then you won't get missed. Glad they were able to seat us anyhow. The people that tried to take our seats I  believe they brought them back.\n\nThe food was excellent. I felt bad because the guest I was with had hair in their food and had to get there food redone. I was surprised with such a fine restaurant they didn't automatically send over a manager to apologize. Instead they remade the food. We didn't get to enjoy our dinner together by the time they remade it. That was a bummer. Most resteraunt I've been to that messed up they actually care about there guests and there experience. Especially our tab was over $160 for only two people. You would think that management would of at least comped a desert. We said nothing at this point. I wasn't there to tell them how to run there restaurant and tell them what good service is thus far. \n\nWe ordered clam chowder, shrimp cocktail, side of lobster tail, lobster tail plate and the seafood mix they were offering that day. The guest  I was with didn't really care for the shrimp on the seafood plate. I was shocked because he's a huge shrimp lover.\n\nIf you arrive at resteraunt they only will valet up to one hour for parking. We parked on the street. Usually we park in the parking lot. But parking can be like 13/ hr up to 48/day or on street you might luck out for $4.75 an hour. We seen one parking lot was like flat rate parking $35.\n\nI'm sure we will be back. If it happens again I will assure you  not keeping my mouth closed and this will surely not be a 3 star review. The food was worth it granted they didn't have hair in there food.

It's outdoor waiting area is relaxing, spacious, and modern. It felt like I was sitting on a daybed in Hawaii and my parents can second that. \n\nFancy? Yes. Pricey? Sure. Food content? As Yelp suggests, it is A-Ok.\n\nI took my parents and siblings out to eat and only waited for 10 minutes to get seated. For a Monday afternoon, this place was already busy. Our host led us to our booth overlooking the pier and boy was that a treat. \n\nThe menu was extensive - there was so much to choose from and it really was hard to make a decisions of what to order (Oh, decisions, decisions)\n\nSteamed Clams - A plate of clams with yummy red sauce and corn. It was a little salty for my taste but my parents loved it!\n\nClam Chowder - Cup vs. Bowl - What should you get? Well, my sister and I ordered the cup size, which really is a size of an espresso cup. It was good enough to fill that clam chowder craving. My mom had the bowl. We all concurred that the chowder tasted pretty bland. Our waiter even forgot to give us crackers - whomp! \n\nSalmon - Yes, you've read that right. The plate is called Salmon. My dad enjoyed it and could barely finish it. He gives it 4 stars.\n\nCioppino - Oh what a small name for a mouthful of food. So there was crab, fish (not sure what kind), shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels, stewed in a seafood tomato broth.\u00a0It was a little salty for my taste  and needed so much water to wash it out. 3 stars\n\nShellfish Platter for two!: Mom and sister had to share this one out. They barely finished the whole plate. This platter actually tasted better than the Cioppino. The garlicky flavor was great and it kept wanting me to eat more and more of it each time. 5 stars.\n\nSurf and Turf: Brother wanted some meat so he settled for this. He demolished his steak and lobster but says his veggies and mash potatoes were gross. 4 stars.\n\nDrinks:\n\nThe  \"Perfect Hibiscus Margarita\" was really perfect. It was beautifully decorated and STRONG. My dad even tried it and got tipsy with this look deceiving drink. 5 stars. All that for $13.50? What a steal.\n\nMy dad's Lombard Lemonade was a refreshing drink. Again beautifully decorated and well worth the price.\n\nLarge portions, beautiful plates, and bomb drinks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-03", "description": "We recently took a road trip up to San Francisco to celebrate my husband's birthday. Since he's the planner in this family, I gave him the task of finding a  restaurant that had strong reviews. We wanted something that was unique to San Francisco with a heavy emphasis on seafood selections. We don't eat mammals and our diet that is pretty much that of a pescatarian/vegetarian. \n\nWhat baffled us was that we booked our reservation via OpenTable a couple of months in advance. What we noticed was that their reservations were booked ahead of time and that we needed to secure a spot right away. So we set it up for the two of us a couple of months before we even arrived.\n\nFog Harbor is located at Pier 39, right off of The Embarcadero. It's on the second level of the shopping district, at the top of the stairs. This is an ideal location because it's right at the entrance to Pier 39 so you can't miss it. There are other restaurant chains there but when you travel, you want something different from what you already have back home.\n\nAnyway, I didn't know that my husband's coworker would be joining us for dinner. So I called Fog Harbor and asked if it would be ok if I added one more person to the reservation. They said that it was alright. However, I wasn't aware that his coworker was also bringing his mother and brother who were visiting from New Jersey. Now we were faced with a situation!!!  The initial reservation went from 2 to 3 people and was now at a total of 5 people. So I explained the situation to the hostess and she gave me that look that a teacher gives their students. It wasn't good BUT she gave us the option of waiting for a table to open up OR be seated at one of the elevated tables away from the window. We were hungry so we went for the second option. As it turned out, we still had a nice view of the water as well as The Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe menu has a heavy seafood emphasis which was right up our alley. I was tempted to try to swordfish fish but I was more intrigued with the Pacific Sole. It was served on a bed of spinach and fingerling potatoes. This was one of those cases in which the food tasted as good as it looked. The sole was delicious and melted in my mouth. The texture and flavor were ON POINT!!!! Everyone else at the table had high regards for their food as well. \n\nMy husband's coworker stated that he's never had swordfish before. With this being his first serving of swordfish, he said it was amazing. He's now hooked on it and won't pass it up when it appears on any other menus in the future.\n\nI really appreciate how flexible the staff were at Fog Harbor. I was nervous about showing up with 3 extra people, given that we had to make this reservation so far in advance. Our entire experience was pleasant and I can see why this place is popular with locals and tourists. It looks like we've got a new favorite location to visit when we're back in The Bay Area!", "author": "Michelle T."}

First of all, I was traveling with a vegetarian. Mind you, we were aware this being a seafood joint, but our plan was to order her a pasta dish and omit the meat. Usually this is just fine. So she ordered the chicken and vegetable penne without chicken. What she got was watery pasta, with mostly raw green beans, red onions, zucchini. No sauce, no cheese, absolutely no flavor. What self respecting cook didn't even think to caramelize those veggies for some flavor, add garlic, or serve it with some type of sauce. Sent that disaster back and they did take it off our bill. \n\nI had the cioppino- it was ok but the sauce tasted overwhelmingly like dry herbs- think prego pasta sauce. \n\nThird friend got the fish n chips.

The coleslaw is a bit tangy like reviews said- but it didn't bother me much. Plus the server was nice to tell us and said we could swap it out if we wanted. The clam chowder was good- a bit on the salty side- but a cup of it was just enough. Also tried the garlic butter roasted crab, which was great- pretty meaty.

We were able to eat and watch the sunset at the same time. It was a memorable experience. The service was also excellent. The waiter was extremely attentive and accomodating to us. We decided to order everything together and share between us. We got 4 cups of clam chowder, 1 baked oyster, 1 mixed grill, 1 cioppino and 1 linguin clam. These were enough to fill us up cuz the portions were pretty generous. In short, I liked everything we ordered but I think everything was over-seasoned here.

Had to knock down a star for some service issues.\n\nDue to traffic, we barely made the 10-minute cutoff for being late to our reservation. However, we sat for a good 10-15 minutes ignored by at least 3-4 staff members, including who we would find out to be our actual waitress. Just a little after opening, it was busy but not chaotic, and we got one of the last booths in the middle facing the water. However, no one stopped by to offer water or anything for these 10-15 minutes. When our waitress finally came to get our orders, she was a little sarcastic in her tone when we asked about possibly adding linguine to the cioppino, saying she had to check on it before she walked away. Ooookay? However, her attitude adjusted quickly when she came back, and was extremely accommodating and polite afterwards.\n\nAs for the food, like I said, it was heavy. We order the mussel fries to start, which were quite tasty. The broth was rich, but good when you dipped it in the sourdough. I wish the fries were served on the side or something, as well as the aioli put on the side rather than drizzled on top. We couldn't squeeze the lemon on the mussels before finishing the fries first. But everything was cooked well.\n\nFor my entree, I got the clam chowder and Caesar salad combo, but could barely finish half of the clam chowder. My family enjoyed the cioppino, ahi tuna, and seafood penne. I picked off their plates, and the seafood penne would be my favorite! The tomato cream sauce was hearty but not overwhelming and the dish had a lot of seafood in it. The cioppino was slightly too salty for me, but anything goes with that delicious sourdough you get for free! The sourdough isn't too sour, but has a more subtle flavor than most sourdough breads I've had in SF. Pretty good! When in doubt, DIP THE SOURDOUGH IN YOUR FOOD.", "author": "Sarina J."}

Very good food, but I do believe there is ample room for other seafood restaurants in the area to surpass it. I ordered the seared pacific cod, which was served in a chorizo butter sauce. Very delicious, as the fish was very flaky and had a perfect crisp to the crust. However, the white beans that were served alongside left much to be desired. Fingerling potatoes would have completed this dish in a much more satisfactory manner.\n\nOur waiter, Jeremy, was great. The service was impeccable, as our waters were always filled, and the bread basket was quickly replaced.

We visited during our layover from Hawaii to Atlanta, looking forward to some of that famous San Francisco seafood.  This restaurant was my choice and I chose poorly. \n\nOne bright spot- the super nice hostess seated us at a terrific table overlooking the water. There are some gorgeous views to be had here so make sure you get a good table. \n\nThough not very crowded there was a long wait for everything.  A long wait to order drinks, to get drinks, to order food, to get food, to get check and on and on.  We almost had to go wander around and find our server to even pay our bill. Our server had a habit of stopping for long chats are many tables in her section.\n\nThe food was disappointing as well. We ordered a combo that had salmon and cod.  I don't normally care for cod (my husband does and we were splitting) so I was planning to eat the salmon.  It was so bad though!  The cod was perfect, with a very nice sauce.  The salmon was super-fishy and drowning in sauce. \n\nNot a horrible place but not a place we'd return to when there are so very many options in the area.", "author": "Kristie W."}

The drink itself was extremely sour, and I can't believe it had egg whites in it bc it typically cuts any sour flavor.  No one ever checked to see how the drinks were, so I finished it begrudgingly.

Prefer to visit places off the beaten track. Of course, there are certain exceptions. Pier 39/Fisherman's Wharf is one of those exceptions, a place I have loved since I first visited in 1975/6. During a recent trip to San Francisco/Monterey, we visited Fog Harbor twice. Once at the beginning of the trip. Once at the end.\n\nOur first visit came at the end of a long day of travel. We scored the last booth in the place, ordered a crisp white or four and a mess of sppetizers. Calamari, a spicy shrimp app. Everything was outstanding and delivered with a smile. We really enjoyed ourselves and the trip got off to a very nice start.\n\nOur second visit was on the fourth of July. Pandemonium was the name of the game. Out on the Wharf and inside the restaurant. We waited forty five minutes due to an odd snafu with Open Table that isn't worth getting into. Our table was very nice with an outstanding view of the water and passing squadrons of Brown Pelican. We ordered more nice white wine, apps, crab salad and fried shrimp. Again, everything was delicious.\n\nMidway through our meal, a family with two small children were seated next to us. While one parent played on his phone, and the other strolled around the restaurant looking to charge up her phone, the two kids screamed, blocked passers by, nearly tripped servers. One kid ran around clutching a butter knife. The little pisher then wacked my wife in the back of the head. In a perfect world, these people and their obnoxious children would have been hustled to the door and told never to return. But I'm quite sure the Cornell School for Hospitality frowns on that.\n\nA hard working manager tried to stop the insanity. I did also but alas, these folks spoke no English so the man with the purple face(me) had little to no effect. What a nice guy, that manger. Wish we could have chatted more with him in a calmer environment. A true gem.\n\nFog Harbor provides good eats in the midst of a bustling tourist area. We like it very much.", "author": "David B."}

After a 5 hour stay on The Rock, we were hungry and decided to grab a bite since we were in the Fisherman's Wharf area. I fired up the Yelp app and searched for some seafood restaurant recommendations. \nWe entered Fog Harbor and immediately noticed the beautiful view. The sun was setting so just imagine an amazing cotton candy sky. We waited approximately 5 minutes for our table even though it was dinner time. Walking through the dining room the plates looked promising.\nWe ordered the bread bowl of chowder topped with crab, calamari, fish & chips, and sourdough bread.\nThe food was just fine. The calamari was good. Fresh squid and tartar sauce that tasted from a bottle but I could be incorrect. The fish & chips were tasty. Big portion of fish with bagged frozen fries. The bread bowl of clam chowder was also ok. I wish it would've had not crab. The bread bowl wasn't cut that deep but the upper 2/3 of the bread bowl was filled with chowder.\nThe service was good. Our 1st waitress was nice. She continuously brought us bread and filled our water glasses without giving us a second look. Unfortunately she had to leave mid-service. Our 2nd server was just as nice. \nWhat really left a bad impression on us was that a f-ing MOUSE ran into the dining area.  YES A F-ING MOUSE!!! The thing scurried in and was less than 3' from us.

To keep it short and simple, the oysters we're not prepared well. Salty like it was never rinsed or cleaned out. Oysters were TINY. No flavor other than sea water. Not good to the pallet. Had small shell bits inside. \n\n3) Ordered a $7.50 non alcoholic berry drink. You would think they would put a little more effort for that price point. Basically a flat Sprite with some dried blackberries. I'd much rather drink a can of sprite had I known any better.\n\n4) Asked the waiter for parking validation. He said be right back with it and came back with the bill - no validation. I ended up having to ask another and he got for me just before I got up to leave. My original waiter comes back and drops a second validation on my table and walks off as he probably saw my 12% tip ( which I felt thoroughly justified for the lack of presence and honesty about the food).\n\n5) Here's the kicker. CHECK YOUR BANK STATEMENTS. I clearly wrote $130 on the $117 tab, giving them a $13 tip which I was even reluctant to give in the first place. What do they do? Charge me $140. This is theft. I clearly, in big and clear numbers wrote $130. And no, this is not about $10. It's about the integrity of this restaurant. So naturally, I called in, and the host said he would check and call me back right away. No call. I called in 6 hours later, same host picked up. Explained to him the situation once again, he put me on hold, and then hung up on me. Never called me back again. This place is a sham. Check your bank statements. Especially if you tip them less that the 18%, they will pull a fast one. I'm sure I'm not the first and definitely won't be the last.

I had assume it was presented as a whole crab, but instead our server requested the kitchen staff to split into 2 plates without asking me. The presentation lost its \"WOW\" factor and I was super disappointed in that. \n\nOtherwise the crab was very good. Great garlic flavor. Good chunks of crab meat. \n\nShould really give this place a shot. Great seafood dishes. Except if you get a whole crab, make sure they serve it whole and not split between two plates.", "author": "Alan L."}

DOWN.\"\nYou'd think I would be saying that about some monstrous burger in a dive bar somewhere, but no I was ravenous for some high class seafood.  I had my napkin in one hand, fork in the other - that's how you know I was ready to chow down...on the clam \"chow\"der that is.  I did not predict that the clam chowder would survive for very long, and my hypothesis was proven correct as the chowder was completely out of sight within minutes.  Though that is pretty much the same song and dance for everything that was placed in front of my fiance and I here at Fog Harbor Fish House.\n\nWhether it be the fried scallops, the chili shrimp or the clam linguine, nothing was safe from consumption.  There were no survivors, but don't worry - they died quickly.  There was no suffering for any of the shrimps or clams or scallops.  Speaking of scallops, the ones we ordered were seasonal, but if you ever catch them when they have the fried scallops on the menu - GET THEM!  It's the best fried food ever.  And the chili shrimp is equally as amazing.  The clam linguine, you ask?  Also ridiculously amazing...and our server split it into 2 bowls for is since we were sharing.  \n\nBy the way, sharing is the way to go here - that way you are reducing the out-of-pocket costs per person, unless of course you decide to split the food so you can try more of it...in which case you'll still be spending a pretty penny.  I would recommend splitting the appetizers and entrees here because it gives you a greater opportunity to try more menu items!  So, split all the seafood but get dessert for yourself - I guarantee you won't want to share it, especially if you get the chocolate banana bread pudding!  Also the best bread pudding I've ever had!\n\nWhat's even better is the view of the harbor while you're dining in.  I went during the daytime, but I can only imagine how beautiful it is to dine here at sunset.  The decor itself is quite elegant and beautiful - truly, everything was done perfectly here, including the service by our waitress.

Located on Pier 39, which has a lot of shops to check out while waiting for your name to be called for dinner. Wait for dinner wasn't long at all - maybe 15 minutes in total without a reservation on a Saturday night at 8pm.\n\nWe started off with the Mussel Fries ($16), which I HIGHLY recommend just because I'm a fry person. But also because it's actually delicious with the sauce and mussels. My boyfriend and I also split a clam chowder bread bowl ($11), but I recommend getting a regular bowl and using the complimentary sourdough bread to dip since you don't want to get full off of bread. For the main course, we ordered the lazy cioppino ($41), and our server split the dish between my boyfriend and I without us asking. It's too much if you eat alone. We also ended up sharing a dessert plate with chocolate cake and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, very light & delicious even when you're full. \n\nParking isn't bad... there's a parking garage that's located right across the street from pier 39 which is super convenient because we didn't want to waste time looking for street parking. Again, it's not a bad price...IF YOU DON'T LOSE YOUR PARKING TICKET. I cannot stress this enough. The parking ticket is your GOLDEN TICKET. Each hour is $10, with a max at 5 hours. You can get your ticket validated and get the first hour free. Our ticket would've have cost $10 since we only stayed for 2 1/2 hours, and we wouldve gotten the ticket validated.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-06", "description": "After a second visit today, Fog Harbor Fish House is now firmly on my list of seafood restaurants to go to when in SF. Its location on Pier 39 might initially be a turn-off if you are really just trying to scratch a seafood itch and don't relish the idea of wading through all the tourists milling around the shops. However, the food is worth it. Luckily enough, the restaurant is located on the second floor of one of the buildings closest to curbside, so not much wading is involved. \n\nI would describe the interior of the restaurant as \"modern\". The seating options are a mix of booths and standard tables, as well as space at the bar, which I think was for walk-ins. Large windows facing the moorings for the Blue & Gold tour boats lets lots of light in during the day and makes for a nice view from the window tables.\n\nThe menu is definitely geared towards seafood aficionados, though there are some non-seafood choices. As I understand it, Fog Harbor is part of the Simmons Family Restaurants group, which has several types of seafood restaurants in and around Pier 39. One thing to bear in mind is that this is the more \"proper\" of the group's restaurants, and is pricier as a result. \n\nYou will be hard pressed to find better seafood for the price though. On both of our visits here, we ordered the cioppino (seafood stew), the clam chowder, and the bay scallops. The seafood is all fresh, tasty, and generously portioned. The main courses I ordered were the lobster tails on our first visit, and the scallop and crab risotto the second visit. Both dishes were phenomenal.\n\nOne thing worth mentioning is that the servers we got both times were very attentive and friendly. Our second visit was actually for a birthday lunch, which I made a note of on my reservation, and our server (Kayla) gave us a dessert on the house, complete with a candle in it! It was the tiramisu, which is definitely worth saving space for. \n\nIn short, I am already looking forward to my next visit to Fog Harbor!", "author": "Adrian A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-23", "description": "Average sea food restaurant!!!\nAfter reading a few of the rave reviews I was hoping to be the next critic to sing their praises, but in my honest opinion, it was just an average dining experience. Fog Harbor is your typical sea food joint with all the usual cuisine reinforced by sublime views of the bay and Wharf below. \n\nUpon arrival I was seated fairly quickly (considering it was Mother's Day and very crowded) at the bar, of course, which I'm used to since I typically dine alone. My meal consisted of battered fried cod filets and three, maybe four decent, but certainly not jumbo sized shrimp---as I was expecting, a side of coleslaw and fries. The fish and shrimp tasted fine; nothing spectacular, coleslaw was bland. I prefer mine creamy and sweet. Maybe it's the Floridian in me, lol. On a positive note, the vignette wine soda is definitely worth a try, for non drinkers who want to put on a spin on things. It's like drinking Chardonnay without feeling the buzz. I will say that the staff was friendly and accommodating, although, the guy who was waiting on me did disappear for awhile, but they were super busy, so it's understandable. \n\nIn summation, Fog harbor is a classic sea food joint, safe and reassuring, but nothing outstanding. The local Red Lobster, in my opinion would meet the same expectations for slightly lesser the price.", "author": "Kyle B."}

For the price, location, and food selection we had decent expectations. We started with alcoholic beverages which were decent, but didn't taste like much alcohol was in them. We ordered appetizers of Calamari and Clam Chowder which was quite delicious. No complaints there. However, our entrees came out and that's when our experience took a nosedive. The table ordered the recommended dishes such as the Seafood Penne and the Fish and Chips. The battered fish was bland and tasteless, and the Seafood Penne Pasta left more to be desired. The sauce was so thin it slid right off the pasta leaving a plain noodle. The service was awful, and I'm pretty sure the server was high the entire time.

Rated four stars by over four thousand people, this place seemed awesome, not to mention all the mouth watering pictures. \nI went to another seafood place (less fancy tho) the day before and it was amazing. So I got to this place with full of expectation. The lady at the host stand greeted me and my mom with a smile. We got seated right away. Our table had a nice view of the harbor. I was still excited up to this point. \nThen the waiter came by, didn't introduce himself or whatever, just asked if we wanted to get started with any drinks. And, probably because I said I wanted a few more minutes to look at the menu, he suggested a few items. I love it when people give me recommendations. We then ordered a seafood platter for two with an additional lobster tail, and a caesar salad.\nFrom this point on, the waiter seemed to avoid talking to us. He used body language. Yes, body language. And only when he needed to, or else he would disappear or wandered around other tables he was serving. I started to feel weird. At first I thought he might be a foreigner, that would explain why he didn't really talk to us and used body language. But he joked with the table next to me. That was when I noticed other waiters did introduce themselves to whomever they served. \nOh boy, whatever. It's not like I need his attention for anything. I don't really care about how you serve people, as long as you are polite and the food is good. \nThe seafood platter was good. Full of clams, mussels, shrimps, crabs and potatos. They were all fresh. The lobsters were bomb. I loved the potatoes. But I didn't like my caesar salad. It was a bit more sour than and caesar salad I've ever had. And you know what was funny? It had full romaine lettuce leaves. Is that art? Because it doesn't make the salad taste any better. My mom and I had to actually use the knives to cut it up. A romaine lettuce leave can be as big as my hand, so of course I'm never gonna put that whole thing into my mouth. And we had three croutons made from sourdough bread on top of the leaves. Not my favorite, but it's just my taste, I'm not complaining. \nI don't have any picture of the salad cuz I wasn't going to show it to anyone. I only take pictures of pretty dishes. I didn't even think about writing this review. But the waiter gave me a final strike. \nThe moment I dropped my fork, didn't even finish wiping my hand, he appeared out of nowhere behind me asking if I've finished or was still eating. Shortly after cleaning up our table, he came with our check. I felt like he was trying to kick us out cuz customers were lining up waiting outside. He circled his name, Samir, and wrote \"Thank you!!\" \nCUTE. I love notes!\nOur bill was about $140, so we were supposed to tip $22 which was 18%. I knew it, but I didn't want to because he didn't deserve that much. Remember his greeting style, body language and all the ignoring? After paying for our dinner, my mom happened to put a $10 bill on the table and the waiter saw that. He turned and showed us the suggested tips written on the bill. And I actually followed what he said. We tipped him $22 as he wanted. \nHe picked up the check before we left, and threw us a \"xia xia\" (thank you in chinese). Excuse you gentleman, if you see this review, it's time for you to learn that not all Asian is Chinese. Now I think I understand, he might think we were Chinese and wouldn't understand English, so he didn't talk to us or want to have any interaction. We sat there for like a minutes afterwards thinking we were stupid to tip him that much. \nThe food is not good enough to get me back to that place to be treated like that.

This place had us sold when we read award winning chowder!\n\nIt was a tough choice since Fishermans Wharf is basically filled with a ton of great chowder places but this spot still won us over. You walk into a beautiful entrance with a seating area and fireplace. Past the bar and into the dining room. We got lucky and we were seated next to the window. It was on overcast chilly day but the view still looked spectacular. The chowder defiantly helped us to warm up before our bike ride to the bridge. The chowder was warm, thick and flavorful. It was not salty which is my main issues with clam chowders. They didn't skimp on any of the ingredients you see the huge chunks of clams. It wasn't watered down or runny. The spices really did come through nicely. We added extra crab meat for $7. I wish the crab meat was warmed before placing it on top of the chowder. I had to mix it into the chowder to warm it up. Then we ripped off pieces of the sourdough bread bowl to dip into the chowder. It was delicious just what we needed. We also had their complimentary sourdough bread and butter before our meal came out. Can't get enough carbs! Especially good sourdough! Calamari is another tricky dish that can go wrong. But not here! The hot plate of freshly fried calamari was so good! Lemon aioli was served instead of tarter sauce. The lemon aioli really made a huge difference especially with a freshly squeezed lemon over the calamari. The surprise kicker was the deep fried slices of jalape\u00f1os to give you a surprise kick of fire. I didn't even notice it until my BF pointed them out. I tried some of the smaller pieces of jalape\u00f1o and calamari dipped into the aioli ohhhh it was the best combo. \n\nService was wonderful, server was on top of everything.

The Calamari we ordered was lightly breaded and seasoned, still had an excellent crunch and the accompanying sauce was as perfect. If you're watching your salt intake this is a wonderful choice. We each had an order of half a crab (topped with chopped roasted garlic, butter and lemon). For people struggling with opening crabs these come pre-cracked and they provide a disposal bowl and wet wipe. Our waiter was attentive even when the restaurant filled up. We arrived around 1115 and it was perfect because by 12PM there was a wait line and the entire restaurant was full.", "author": "Brittanie W."}

Like seriously, a seafood restaurant in Pier 39?  Being a native of the Bay Area I always associated Pier 39 with overpriced parking and totally tourist trap restaurants.  Value, flavor, and good service in this area historically was very hard to come by.  \n\nBut alas, my wife was craving seafood and we were already on location so I said - why not?!   So my wife and I shared a shellfish platter for 2 and my kids shared the sliders appetizer.  The dinner also came with delicious warm sourdough - which was absolutely delicious - and went along perfectly with the shellfish platter's garlic/butter sauce - like a delicious slice of warm garlic bread MMMMMMMMmmmm...\n\nThe shellfish platter portion size was very generous, and the crab meat was tender and sweet.  I am a big fan of shellfish - and I felt the mussels and clams were absolutely wonderful!  Shrimp were on the smaller size - but still nice nonetheless.\n\nThe star of the show however was our waiter - Jose.  He was amazing in his attentiveness - he even brought out a live \"condemned\" lobster to cheer my crying daughter up.  He totally went the extra mile to make our experience incredibly memorable.

She recommended the oysters and they did not disappoint but......I ended up ordering a cup of the clam chowder TOO (adding crab to it) - YUM! The complimentary sourdough bread combo'd perfectly with the chowder.\n\nFor the main course the choice was the trio of the salmon, swordfish & shrimp that came with mashed potatoes & grilled asparagus. DOUBLE YUM! It was tough to pick a favorite but I'd give the swordfish a slight lead over the other two; the asparagus was grilled & seasoned perfectly too! The potatoes were not bad but didn't stand out.\n\nSoooooo.....this was already plenty of food and most people wouldn't bother considering dessert .....until the options were presented!

The only place I could find with two dollar signs that served both seafood and steak was the Fog Harbor Fish House. They were concerned about it being too touristy, and were also put off by the fact that we couldn't get a reservation, but I wanted to give it a chance.\n\nWell. Sure, it's at Pier 39, but it's not \"touristy\" in the typical sense. It's elegant, and very San Francisco. It has a wonderful view of the bay, and our window faced the lovely sunset over Mt. Tam.\n\nThey really do reserve most of their tables for walk-ins; we were nervous about walking up at 6 p.m. without a reservation, but we only had to wait 15 minutes.\n\nThe food was exquisite. I had the seafood penne, which was to die for. The mussels are HUGE! Others had the mixed grill, the seafood platter, and the Fog Harbor burger. Everyone loved their meals, and our waitress, Ashley, was very kind and attentive.\n\nAs for the price, it's a bit more than two dollar signs. But graded on a curve, I'd say that it is less expensive than other places that serve similar fare. Each dish could have easily cost $5-10 more elsewhere.\n\nThis would be a lovely place to bring visitors from out of town or a local date just the same.", "author": "Kelsey S."}

We were called and seated in a booth (as requested) in less time than anticipated - less than five minutes.\n\nOur waiter was very friendly and highly efficient.  \n\nMy wife ordered a fried seafood combo plate - Shrimp, fish and calamari served with cole slaw and fries.

I had a dish of clam chowder (exceptional even by frisco standards) and fried Scallops served with a garlic/jalapeno Aoli.  \n\nAll dishes were exceptionally well prepared, flavorful, large enough in quantity to either require a take home bag or leaving some on the plate uneaten.  The hot sour dough bread that arrived before our meal was fragrant and crusty - so delicious.\n\nEach time I've been a guest here, I have been impressed with how this restaurant handles the high volume of customers without making them feel as though they're in a production line.  Everyone is seated quickly and service is comprehensive and thoughtful. It leaves you with a feeling of a fine dining experience with great food and service.", "author": "Len M."}

I was no disappointed!\n\nFirst off, the view really makes this restaurant. If it wasn't for the view, I do not think it would be as popular as it is based off the food alone. The food was good, but in teams of seafood, there are much better places to eat.\n\nWe sat at the bar and loved every second of it. The bartenders working were both awesome. Two older guys who had huge personality and top notch service. We tried a few different things off the menu, but the clam chowder was the best hands down. Even though it's not the best I've had in the city, it did a pretty damn good job. The fish I had was tasty but everything else they threw on the plate really took away from the protein itself. My roommate had lobster, which he said was incredible. The drinks we ordered were are very sweet but tasty nonetheless. \n\nThe line is insane.

When we came across this place on yelp we were impressed with what they had so we gave it a a go.\n\nFirst thing is that if you're coming for lunch on a Friday or weekend for that matter, expect to wait a while. I think we waited close to 45 min to be seated. No big deal as we just sat at the bar and killed time there. The only thing I regret is forgetting to request a window table to enjoy the view of the water. However looking back we probably would have waited longer and we were too hungry lol.\n\nI had the garlic dungeoness crab... even though I ordered the half size, the waiter must have misheard me and got me the full order ($45). Fianc\u00e9e had the mixed seafood which included grilled shrimp, grilled salmon, grilled swordfish. The crab was actually amazing! Well seasoned deep into the meat! And the crab was actually pretty meaty despite the size of it! The mixed seafood dish was really good especially the swordfish! We also shared a sourdough bread bowl with clam chowder, but nothing really too crazy about it IMO. \n\nService was great, Despite the miscommunication about the crab. I didn't make a big deal about it because honestly I didn't feel like I had to. The food was great regardless.\n\nOverall this place was really good and we would definitely be back! I would still have had the half crab because it was too much food for the full crab, but if you're going with a few people it probably would be good to share one whole crab.", "author": "Brian J."}

Great view of the bay and Alcatraz, located at Pier 39 so lots of touristy things to do within walking distance. Of course, with the tourist location comes tourist prices but it's not that bad. In terms of food, their award winning clam chowder is quite good (particularly with the added crab) 4/5. We usually come for the lobster (5/5 very fresh) and Dungeness crab (5/5 the garlic is seriously good! This is their best dish!); we have had some other dishes here and there that were reliably good but nothing that springs to mind 1-2 years later. Service is usually quite good and you can get seated usually within an hour even if there is a wait - no problem there's lots to do while you wait!\n\nThis time around we got the clam chowder again as well as the seared pacific cod and the mussel fries. The mussel fries were fabulous (5/5); being a seafood house you might not expect their fries to be top notch but they are, and the cream sauce was delicious. The Pacific Cod, which was the dish recommended by our waiter, was honestly our least favorite dish that we have tried here. I generally prefer for my cod to have that juicy, oily mouthfeel and the cod was a little dry, maybe due to the thickness of the fish (don't know if you can tell from the picture but it was about 1/4 inch thick when it arrived on the table). However our waiter was fabulous at everything else, including getting our check to us early as we had lost track of time and had an upcoming appointment.\n\nMy brother usually comes with us and always gets the burger because he doesn't like seafood. It's alright, but really why come to a seafood house for a burger? It does comes with those delicious fries.\n\nTl;dr: great views, great service, great area, generally great food. Get the clam chowder, lobster, mussel fries, and 100% get the Dungeness crab. Don't expect too much from the non-seafood options. Expect tourist prices given it's a tourist location; to me it's worth a few extra bucks a dish if we are going to be hanging out at the piers for the day anyway.

It was basically your typical raw oysters - it wasnt specified what type of oysters they were. $34 for 12 oysters. \n\nAhi Tuna Poke $18 - Loved the flavors in this! It was very fresh tuna served with some chopped mangoes. I thought the mangoes were a nice touch to balance out the flavors. Great appetizer to start out our meal with.\n\nClam Chowder w/ Crab - got the cup size to try ($7), to add crab was an additional $7, but well worth it! Had to really get that seafood experience, right? The chowder was good on its own, but the crab added an extra umph and texture. I enjoyed it. Their chowder was also rewarded best in SF! \n\nSeafood Penne $23 - The sauce for this was really favorable, but it didnt exactly \"wow\" me. The overall portion of the dish looked to be large, but once you get into it there was not a lot of penne within the actual dish. However, there was definitely a decent amount of seafood to compensate! For a small girl, i found that this dish was just enough for me. \n\nAlaskan Halibut $34 - This was part of their seafood menu. A bit of a disappointment. Although the fish was very soft and fresh, it lacked flavor. We are more so people who enjoy more flavor in our dishes. Had to use sauce from the pasta so the fish wouldnt be so bland. \n\nApple Crisp $8.50 - We came here for our anniversary, so they gave us a complimentary dessert. So nice of them! At the end of your meal, the server will come out with a tray of desserts to choose from - you select the one you want and they will prepare you a new one from the back. I was silly and was about to grab it right off the tray. The Apple Crisp was delicious. Not too sweet and served with vanilla ice cream.

I have had many staff wait on me and many different dishes however this is my FIRST review of it! I came today, Saturday probably the busiest day for them I'm guessing. I did not make a reservation For our group but I don't ever mind having a drinks with the bar first and then heading to a table, usually takes less thank 30. This staff is run around though! You can see how bustling it is when your waiting!!! We sat by a window this time which is always nice! The server we had today is hands down the best server I've had since coming here!!! Even though she was SO SO busy!! A lot of tables here don't speak English and they accommodate that well with photos (I bring clients here a lot in the day) however it can busy with everyone waving down your server. Our server Shawna was amazing! Girl never broke a smile the whole time!! Although I had been there my table guests had not so she went though the whole menu and how it's best to work it. We shared family style and everyone was impressed with every single thing!! Shawna had amazing attention to detail, always knew when we needed water, extra sauces, etc, also although it was so busy we didn't feel rushed at all! AMAZING SERVICE!!!

We all sat down ordered a bunch of drinks and appetizers, at first I feel like the waitress was a little annoyed and wanted to rush us out of there but then later she did end her shift while we were still there so I'll give her the benefit of the doubt on that one. This was hands down some of the best seafood I've had. The calamari was delicious and perfectly cooked. The oysters were the most fresh delicious oysters I've ever had. The whole table tried an oyster even the people who aren't oyster lovers. We ordered the sliders which had such a delicious sauce on them which made them absolutely amazing.

Although the 40 minutes wait was quite long, it was totally worth it. The food, service and view were superb.\n\nWe were seated by the window, which we like, and could see the pier and ocean. We ordered the special -- which was a combination of lobster tail and steak -- plus the linguini & clams pasta, a dozen fresh oysters, and clam chowder. To go along with all the seafood, white wine was a must. The oysters were fair in proportion, yet not large enough to \"wow\" you. The clam chowder was delicious in particular. It had enough ingredients for the three of us. My personal favorites would be the clam chowder and lobster tail + steak special. The steak was cooked medium rare, and it was quite a unique experience switching off tender, moist beef with tougher, lobster meat... We devoured it. The linguini & clams pasta was decent, but not the best.\n\nOur server was kind and very attentive. He was clearly busy running around, yet addressed our needs and always wore a smile. The restaurant was packed, without a single empty table.

I thought initially it would be a good idea to make a reservation because I thought it would be busy but when I called the lady on the line indicated that the only times available would be around 10:00 pm and that if I arrived early there would be plenty of seating. So, I arrived around 7:00 pm and waited in line briefly before being met by the hostess. When I finally asked about a table to hostess told me it would be about a 30 to 45 minutes wait for a table!!! At this point, I am so disappointed in having to wait because I was initially told that there would be tables available.\n\nI give my name and phone number to be notified when my table will be ready. I then proceed to take my seat and wait. The system that they have here is that the will text you or call you when your table is ready if you are not in the area. One nice thing is that the staff said that the wait may be shorter than the estimated time that they provided which I found to be a bit comforting. As I wait I take a few pictures admire backdrop of the bay and the sights at the Pier. After 45 minutes go by I proceed to the hostess and ask if my table is ready. She then asks for my name and then looks through the names. She then says that she does not see my name. Then she proceeds to ask me who took my name and number and tell her that she took it. Apparently, according to her, she called out the name earlier and someone took my spot. WHAT!!! My next question is did she check the ID? I get a blank stare and no answer, figures! What is the point of taking the name and phone number if you are not going to verify this information, come on man!!!! At this point, she apologizes and says it will be five minutes. At this point, I am just infuriated and disgusted by the madness of trying to get a table. \n\nEventually, I am seated and ready to order. My server Adam was the best! He is the sole reason why this rating is so high. He was absolutely phenomenal. His recommendations were helpful and made my meal decision a whole lot easier. His timing to check-in was right on and the dessert tray was incredible. Unfortunately, I did not order dessert because my food was so good and I was stuffed. But, had I ordered a smaller meal I most definitely would have gotten a least one or everything from the dessert tray. \n\nOverall, the food was great but getting inside was just so much of a hassle and a pain. It is a good thing that servers like Adam work here because he really made the visit here worth it. I cannot say that about anyone else. \n\n#GoodFoodLongWait", "author": "Robert F."}

We were seated at a table with a beautiful window view of Alcatraz and the ocean, due to the busyness of the restaurant it was loud but besides that restaurant was clean and everything went good. For starters, our waiter served us warm tasty bread with a nice warm butter on the side as you put it on the bread it melted and was so delicious! For appetizers my fianc\u00e9 got crab ceviche in which the only problem was they don't give that much chips to eat it with but my fianc\u00e9 enjoyed it with the chips and also on its own. The second appetizer we got was half of a garlic crab, this restaurant is very classy as my waiter took out a bib like plastic and put it on me before eating the crab. The crab was very good, squeezed lemon all over the crab which added a nice touch to it. Our main entree, I ordered a peppered steak with mashed potatoes and vegetables in which the steak and potatoes were flavor flavorful and they cooked my steak to my likings but the vegetables I was not too much of a fan of due to it having some type of sweet taste which to get paste it I had to put quite a bit of salt and pepper on it. My fianc\u00e9 ordered salmon with vegetables, when we ordered this we thought the vegetables would be on the side like usual but we were surprised to see the vegetables under the salmon besides that the salmon was good and has a nice flavorful seasoning. Our bill came out to be around $150, two sodas, two appetizers and two delicious main entree was worth the price.

The restaurant itself is impecable and has good views facing the ocean and Alcatraz island. The customer service is a 10/10. The waitress who was helping my family and I was named Jessica and she definitely was very helpful and made the experience better. The wait time is sometimes a bit long, but I'd wait. It's definitely worth every minute. Not to mention desert. The desert presentation is to die for. 10/10 overall", "author": "Cassandra M."}

I had the clam chowder, lazy Cioppino (lazy means meat is taken out of shellfish), and blackberry press. The chowder has great consistency and pairs well with their freshly made sourdough bread. The freshness of the seafood really came through on the Cioppini. I almost regret mixing in the tomato sauce and taking away from the seafood, but that's just a matter a preference and I'd still order the dish again.", "author": "Don G."}

The wait was around an hour and a half which we didn't mind because the restaurant was recommended by a friend. My fianc\u00e9 and i walked around for a bit while we waited for the text saying our table was ready. Once we got back we were seated immediately and the waitress approached us extremely quick. As an appetizer we tried the clam chowder only because we noticed that it was \"Award Winning\" and let me tell you, it was amazing. The creaminess and taste were unbelievable. Anyways, other than our waitress being so very friendly and sweet, the rest of our food was also amazing. I can't remember what my fianc\u00e9 ordered, but i ordered the ciopino. I had NO idea what that was but decided to order it anyways. Once the food was almost out, the waitress proceeded to put on the plastic bibs which was an excellent idea, because if it wasn't for that we would've got very dirty lol. Let me just say, the ciopino was amazing. I will now compare every ciopino i eat in the future to the one i had  that night. Amazing service, amazing food, great ambiance. The lights were dim which created a very romantic feeling. It was a bit loud in there, but not really anything to complain about.

It's a nice place to dine away from all the tourist and birds flying all over the place. The crab roll we ordered was tasty on top of a perfectly toasted bread. We noticed all the other food options available that was being eaten and they all looked good. You definitely can't go wrong with eating seafood here.

There are so many opportunities and places to check out. After a lot of searching, decided to check out this place based on a large amount of positive reviews. This is an institution that serves fresh seafood and gives off a scenic view of the Pier. The dining experience and views of the Bay Area and Golden Gate Bridge attracts visitors and tourists to visit this restaurant at least once. There appeared to be a half hour wait due to how busy it was. Not a problem. The wait seemed to go by immediately and suddenly we were already inside the restaurant. Fog harbor is said to serve 100% sustainable seafood which could be a bias to anyone who hasn't tried it. The menu offers a great selection of food. Customers get to enjoy complimentary sourdough bread that is baked in house. To start off with the appetizer, we decided to go with a dozen baked oysters that consists of spinach, bacon, and creamy Parmesan sauce. These oysters were incredible. It felt like they popped right in your mouth and had so much flavor. I decided to also get the award winning clam chowder bread bowl! This was amazing as well. For the entree, I decided to go with the mixed grill platter that is made with grilled salmon, pacific cod, and shrimp, citrus beurre blanc, saut\u00e9ed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes. Food was prepared instantly and did not take long to bring out. The waiter was really friendly but did not bring out water drinks immediately to begin with. Had to give him a reminder. No problem. For a beverage, I also went with the 8 oz flint and steel Sauvignon that was recommended by the waiter. This wine pairs well with fish and had a stronger taste. I would give this restaurant 5 stars based on the food. Price is a bit on the more expensive side but you get what you pay for. Amazing views depending on where you are seated along with fresh seafood right near the pier. Definitely would go again!", "author": "Hai L."}

There's also a cozy fire pit/ waiting area in front of the restaurant where we could chat and look over the menu. Obviously the restaurant was packed, but our service didn't suffer at all. I wish I could remember his name because he did such a phenomenal job. I told my sister (not even directed at the server) that I would share my added scallops with her and when the food came out the scallops were already split between our plates! After my boyfriend was unsuccessful in convincing any others at the table to share a calamari appetizer, our server somehow made an individual order happen. And when I raved about the sourdough bread basket for probably the tenth time, a second basket just somehow appeared. Incredible. Not many servers are that attentive and proactive. The special I ordered, and the bites I stole from everyone else at my table, were all delicious. The clam chowder was really good but unless you are having that as an entree I wouldn't suggest the bread bowl- save room for something else!

But the waiting time is not bad considered they are busy. The clam chowder are in bread bowl and taste is good just not the best for me. The non-alcohol drinks are interesting and taste good. The main dish and is the Bomb for me is the seafood platter. Everything in seafood platter are great, the clams, the Mussels, the Shrimp, the crab legs and the Flavored that come with it. You can also add lobster if you'd like and I think it's great to have this option. \n\nOverall this is a great place if you were to stop by Pier 39!", "author": "Vanda E."}

After walking by multiple mediocre looking places we finally decided to consult yelp and I am so glad we did! I saw the reviews for Fog House and knew we had to go there. We initially put our name in for the table but after seeing the bar was full service we sat there instead. We ordered the clam chowder bread bowl with crab on top as well as the crab roll with fries and both were amazing! Hands down the best crab roll I've ever had (well worth the price) and I had never tried clam chowder before and this was a great first experience. Having been ill earlier that weekend it was very comforting. We had great service from the bartenders although beers were a little expensive. All in all a great meal- we can't wait to come back to San Francisco and have it again!", "author": "Alyssa H."}

We selected Fog Harbor after looking at reviews, location, and menu. We were impressed by the view of the Bay from our table, the cleanliness of the restaurant, and the service. We started with the crab cakes with buerre blanc sauce and mango salsa. They were perfectly crispy and the mango salsa really complimented the sweet crap. Did not taste \"fishy\" at all. I ordered the shrimp and chips- came with 8 huge butterflied, panko crusted shrimp, fries, and a coleslaw with a horseradish kick. It was all very tasty and prepared well. My husband ordered the fried combo with fish, shrimp, and calamari. It all was great, crispy, fresh. Again nothing \"fishy\" tasting. We ended the meal with creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Nothing new here- it's a popular,common dessert...but it tasted great. So many seafood restaurants in this area to choose from but this one was one of the better ones.", "author": "Tara M."}

We actually went online and the only available reservation was for \n10pm that evening which was so not \nhappening so, we took a chance at just walking up and surprisingly only had a 20 minute wait.\n\nUpon sitting down we immediately decided on the Blue Cheese garlic bread for an appetizer and a few beers to start. The bread was perfectly crispy and I was pleasantly surprised to find that they did not skimp on the delicious Point Reyes blue cheese. \n\nI settled on Linguine with Clams and my husband went for the Flat Iron Steak. The latter of which, I must admit, I was hesitant about given the location and abundance of wonderful seafood options. However, I was extremely happy to be wrong; the hubs claimed this to be the best steak he's ever tasted and I do believe, my dish may have been as well. Not only were the clams obviously fresh, the seasoning was perfect and the sauce, nice and light to showcase the delicious seafood. \n\nThe service was absolutely phenomenal and the views of both Alcatraz and Golden Gate Bridge from our table absolutely could not be beat.

Great place to enjoy a meal with a view of the calm waters outside the restaurant windows. \n\nStarted out with some sourdough bread as well as the Blue Cheese Garlic Bread. As if their complimentary sourdough isn't fresh and delicious enough, the blue cheese garlic bread takes it to the next level. Some of the dishes that stood out to me during this dining experience were the lobster tail, oysters, and famed clam chowder. The lobster tail was extremely fresh and sweet. Add a little dash of drawn butter into a cut of it and it's absolutely to die for. The oysters were a acceptable size and one dozen for 30 dollars is a steal. They were so delicious that I ordered two dozens! I can also see why their clam chowder is famous. It was creamy with the proper texture and contained fair amounts of clams and potato. I probably wouldn't order the extra crab and sour dough bowl again. Not worth it since the chowder was delicious on its own without those two additions. \n\nThe crab legs and clams, however, were not as great as I expected. The steamed clams that we started off with tasted flavorless and contained bits of sand. The crab meat in the Shellfish Platter was quite bland as well though the meat looked fresh and intact in the legs. I will probably go with getting an entire Dungeness crab next time. I don't want to imply that the Shellfish Platter was poor in taste since the mussels and shrimp particularly were very appetizing. \n\nThe service was great and the waitress checked in periodically to make sure everything was okay.

I already had Fog Harbor in mind since the JW Marriott concierge highly recommended it when we had arrived, although I almost changed my mind when i saw how many people were waiting for a table! Took me almost 5 minutes just to get to the hostess to put my name in, and was told it would be at least a 45 minute wait. We decided to grab some drinks from the bar while we waited and luckily, a couple of spots opened up right at the bar!\n\nThe bartenders were all very professional and friendly. I started with a glass of prosecco then switched to syrah; hubby started and ended with syrah. We ended up ordering way too many drinks and only the crab cake app to share (delish!), but it came with some warm sourdough bread and butter - perfect for soaking up all that wine we consumed!\n\nGreat vibe overall, and we were definitely impressed with the efficient and friendly service, especially since we sat next to an older, much drunker and rowdier couple, and the bartenders were able to handle them extremely well without any sign of irritation. Sad that we weren't able to try more of their food - will have to go back the next time we're in SF!", "author": "Jen M."}

I ordered the seafood platter with the crab legs.. man were they terrible.\n\nThe crab tasted like AMMONIA. At first it wasn't bad at the opening of the leg but as you got to the meat, the chemical was so bad I had to spit it out. You could taste a little pine-sol. We immediately told the manager and they went ahead and brought us a new crab. Once again, the ammonia/chemical smell was prevalent. The manager told us that it's normal and that some crabs have it due to mating season (yeah ok).\n\nI did my own research and apparently the ammonia smell is a byproduct of the decomposition of seafood. Possibly the crab was kept in a filthy tank. Crabs excrete ammonia instead of urine. \n\nSo there you go, they kept a disgusting batch of crabs and still served it to customers. They gave us half off the dish which I don't think compensates for the time and tastebuds wasted. I will never come here again or recommend", "author": "Lorna Q."}

Apparently he doesn't know the authentic clam chowder is much thinner, and there are many versions of i\n3-The person who was serving me at the bar never once asked me how was everything, never bothered to see if I needed anything else. He didn't give me a bowl for the shells so I used my soup bowl, didn't give me a wet napkin until I asked for one. And the \"best\" part? Not even a \"thank you\" as he took my credit card and nothing when he gave me the bill to sign, and nothing when I left. Nothing. I thought this is just what staff who is working the bar does.

I live in a city where I have to drive everywhere and come from a city where I walked 80% of the time, so we opted out for a walk. \nThe restaurant's decor is rather fancy, though I was dressed pretty casually, I did not feel out of place. Everyone here seems chill, no judgmental stares. \nAs far as food, the Huns had NY steak with veggies and mash, I opted for a bread bowl with crab (I was told I MUST have chowder when in San Fran, so I took this as an opportunity to do so). Our waitress asked if we wanted a bread basket while we wait, we did. By the time food came out, the Huns had almost all the bread. I wasn't going for bread since I was going to have plenty in my meal. Even though food took a little while, it was delicious! The streak was spectacular, it had the grilled taste Huns looks for. My bowl was delicious as well, with crab stacked on top. It doesn't originally come with crab but you can add it for $7. A little messy since I tried to rip off pieces of the bread bowl. \nDrinks were great too. I tried the Alcatraz since we were coming from there (corny, I know). It could of been stronger but it was still good. It was also my second drink and I was a little buzzed from the first. I usually don't feel the alcohol in my second drink as much. Especially since my first had tequillaaaaaaa (you have to sing it and shake your shoulders, it's a law). \nI give 4 stars because our waitress was pretty bland. It felt like she had an attitude up until the end, when it came to a tip... then she turned into a Chatty Cathy, asking us about where we are from and telling us she has to pay $1,000 worth of tickets tomorrow... mmhhhhhmmmm, right... I saw her do exactly the same thing to a table next to ours. Oh, and when their drink spilled, she stood on the side allowing other servers clean it up and grinned.

We were excited because all the photos looked delicious. Well, let me just say that the food LOOKS better than it tastes. My bf had the cioppino (dont know if that's the correct spelling) and he was not impressed. I tried it, and it was SO. FREAKING. BLAND. Like seriously, has the chef ever heard of seasoning? It was literally just really great tasting fish drowning in a sad watery tomato sauce. The food has so much potential if only the people cooking it knew what to do. Maybe we came on an off day/time but I dont think we will be returning. Our waitress (pretty blonde girl, didnt catch her name) was very very friendly and attentive and the manager checked on us a few times which was nice. So, the restaurant has great staff,  they just need to learn how to season their food. I get that the restaurant is right on the water with a nice view but the prices are ridiculous. $20 for a boring pasta dish is just a joke.", "author": "Juliana F."}

The crowds were decent and we expected long waits regardless of where we decided to dine so we settled on splurging a little. We put our names on the wait list and after hearing the party before us (party of 4) get a 45 minute wait time we were estatic that our names were called within five minutes of putting our name on the waiting list!\n\nThe hostess seated us adjacent to the window overlooking the bay! SCORE!!! It did take about seven minutes for our waiter to come take our orders but we used the opportunity to review the menu and decide our options. We ordered a half dozen of oysters and the garlic cheese bread as appetizers with cioppino as our main entree, although my wife had hers prepared the 'lazy way', they shell the crab for you. The oysters were a little on the smaller side but were fully prepared for enjoying with the accompanying lemon, sauces and garnishes. The restaurant had already separated the meat of the oyster from the shell, a nice touch. I also ordered their 'Ultimate Dirty Martini' since it was a nice dinner and we didn't have to worry about driving. I'm not a big drinker but I ended up having two more...suffice to say I enjoyed them.\n\nOur main course was delicious. There was plenty to fill the bowl, large chunks of fish, mussels, a couple clams, and a set of large crab legs reaching out! My bowl had a large 'knuckle' that was packed with meat. As I deshelled the crab legs I observed I had amassed significantly more meat through my labor than what my wife had been provided in her 'lazy style' bowl...in other words 'don't be lazy'. The broth was equally delicious although I would have preferred a little more broth...regardless I was still able to splash some on my coat.\n\nWe were too full to take a look at the dessert menu as the cioppino left us with a full belly and a big smile. Very happy that we were able to enjoy a very nice dinner with an incredible view and hardly any wait.\n\nUntil the next meal,\n\nDavid", "author": "David R."}

A guy, I assume a manager, although friendly, asked if I absolutely needed to be at a window. Umm...yes. \n\n25 minutes later I'm back, and I'm at a window seat.

I came across this restaurant on Yelp for many years now and decided to finally come. We came on a Tuesday evening and they were pretty packed. We asked for a table for two and they told us it can be up to 40 minutes, but they will text us possibly to get our seats sooner. So we were fine with that because we walked around the Pier and watched the \"sealebraties\" \n(The seals) ha ha. We got our table in about 30 mins and it was a window view table which was gorgeous, but it was night, so you couldn't see much. It's okay because it was still gorgeous with all the lights. \n\nOur table had cute candles set up as well a beautiful ambience inside the restaurant. They brought us out warm oh so warm bread with butter and water pretty quickly. We then ordered garlic spicy shrimp, clam chowder and I added crab, and my bf got the fish and chips- keeping it authentic. Our waiter was super nice, he had a good conversation with us and even asked if we were celebrating something special. Everyday is special for us, but last night was of course our Christmas outing. He was kind to bring out a dessert platter at the end and we tried the pumpkin banana bread pudding and wow! It was deliciously scrumptious. It came with a nice homemade cream not too sweet and we poured a nice sauce over the bread. It wasn't a white chocolate, but it still had a similar taste. Very yummy. \n\nService was great, food was delicious, wait time was good, our view was amazing, restaurant was clean and beautifully set up, and lastly they are very quick! In and out in no time.

The food here was excellent and the service. We ordered a few dishes and the seafood here was exquisitely delicious!\n\nOrdered: 2 clam chowder bowl, fried scallops, seafood platter, the seafood tower, dungeness crab ravioli, and a mussel with fries (forgot the name but it was soooo good).\nThe clam chowder was really good, best one I've had. I really enjoyed the fried scallops, it came with a mustard jalepeno dipping sauce that made it taste even better. The seafood platter for 1 was so delicious. They was alot of melted butter and garlic underneath it that made everything better. I think this was the best one, it's enough to share with 2. The seafood tower was a bit disappointing because it wasn't a tower, they just put it in 2 plates and stack it on top with a thing that holds it together. We all pitched in for this one because it was almost $70, we don't think it was worthy because it didn't have alot of seafood on here as the platter & it wasn't a tower. :/ I got the dungeness crab ravioli, it was really good but disappointed that the dungeness crab wasn't inside the ravioli, it was on the top. The ravioli was stuffed with the ricotta cheese only. Then the mussels with the fries also the best dish here. The sauce was like a garlic mayo aioli that was drizzled on top of the dish, then the bottom was a coconut sweet sauce. \n\nOverall the food was still very good and so fresh it made everything go well together.", "author": "Susan L."}

It had both!\n\nAlmost all of the seats had spectacular views of the wharves, piers, boats and bay. Ours was not on the window, but one off the row which was in fact better. The wait service was impeccable. \n\nWe came early which is about the smartest thing you could do if you don't want to wait for a hugely popular place to get a seat. Starters was the best old fashioned I've had. I don't like them \"muddled\", but the mashed fruit with the maple syrup was quite unique and quite enjoyable.\n\nI started with a cub of clam chowder. It was very, very good. Not the best, but enjoyable. Lots of clams and bacon. Maybe too much bacon, but I will never say such a sacrilege out loud - \"too much bacon\". Just rip my tongue out before that happens. \n\nWe split an appetizer portion of their scallops. They were fried in almost a Callabash style. No, I can't describe it, so Google it. I worked at a seafood restaurant on the South Carolina coast and this tasted like that. Very well cooked and very tasty. Lots of them almost like lightly battered popcorn shrimp. \n\nI like sampling things, so I went with the mixed grill. Had a little bit of everything. The asparagus was spot on. I'm not a tomato fan, but they were ok. The mashed potatoes were wonderful. Not mashed enough to be smooth, so it had a great texture and taste. It came with three of the most AWESOME grilled shrimp that I hoped I would come back some day just for the shrimp. It also came with a  fabulous piece of salmon. That too would have made a great meal. Finally a piece very superb swordfish. I started going into mental overload thinking which I would have as a dedicated meal if I ever came back.

As I entered their front door, the atmosphere was very remarkable and elegant as I welcomed there. The concept is much like visiting to a first class seafood restaurant with a spectacular view of the Pacific Ocean especially the Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge not too far away from the restaurant. The interior is very clean and fancy both inside and out.\n\nThe employees from servers, hosts and cookers especially chefs and bartenders are doing a fantastic job for accommodating the customers like me a sensational service despite the busiest summer environment. This server named, Samir was such a great male server. He gave me some good recommendations and suggestions especially asking a request for water refills too! No cons at all.\n\nNow onto the food! Since I was in the middle of my budget visit, I ordered their signature soup of: the Fog Harbor's Clam Chowder. As I ate that chowder (in a small bowl), that soup was tasty and outstanding. Much bolder and flavorful than my homemade clam chowder! The ingredients were fresh and new as I did feel the taste of potatoes, clam bites and the smoothness thicker broth of the soup. Such a great soup at all!\n\nParking at Fog Harbor Fish House can be difficult to park. You can park at the nearest surface street parking nor the parking garage if it's available. Otherwise, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, public transportation, valet parking or ride sharing transportation easier without the hassles and headaches.\n\nTo conclude, Fog Harbor Fish House is the most absolute extraordinary local seafood restaurant that I've ever visited right here in San Francisco! Perfect for date nights, anniversaries or friends and family gatherings all year long! A well received visit! My rating: 4 1/2 stars.", "author": "William L."}

This guy made the best Belvedere martini I found anywhere in Fisherman's Wharf.  Once we found Nelson, my wife and I had happy hour here everyday during our vacation. I even had another bartender at Fog Harbor make the same drink when Nelson was on break, and it wasn't nearly as good. A great bartender makes all the difference. They should actually put that drink on the menu and call it The Nelson. Really nice, personable guy too. Always made us feel welcome. For food we generally had shrimp cocktail, calamari and oysters. All good.  Worth a visit if you're in Pier 39.\n\nForgot to add - if you want The Nelson, it's Belvedere martini, up, touch dirty, blue cheese olives.", "author": "Justin R."}

The tuna poke was also very good and had good flavor.  They also give you fresh sour dough bread - I'm not a fan of sour dough but everyone was killing it!

It was a late lunch and dinner basically. We decided to tour Pier 39 first and when we got here we were starving. It was the first place we came across that looked descent so we decided to dine here. The menu looked nice as well as the restaurant itself. We liked that you could view the Bay while eating. We were greeted by the hostess and had no wait. Our waiter was nice and asked us if we had any questions about the menu. Overall the staff was very nice and welcoming.\n\nWe first started with drinks. I ordered the Strawberry-Basil Nojito and he ordered the Maple Old Fashion. My drink was non-alcoholic. It was very good and fizzy and had the perfect blend of strawberry, mint and basil. Nothing was overpowering. Very good. My husband's drink was strong and he enjoyed it. Old Fashions are way to strong for me. \n\nNext we started with appetizers, side salads and bread. We decided to split a Calm Chowder Bread Bowl and we both ordered our own side salad. I ordered a Mix Green Salad and he ordered a Caesar Salad. I'm not a big fan of Clam Chowder but I'm willing to try most things. I honestly don't care for soup but Clam Chowder is just to creamy and weird for me. My husband was more so wanting to try this and being a team player I did. Now our salads were amazing. Yes they were simple but very good. My mixed Green Salad had the standard Balsamic Dressing but this dressing was thicker and a dark orange color. Very tasty. I didn't taste my husband's salad but he did mention that his salad was one of the best Caesars he has had in awhile so I take it that it was good. Lol. He's the one to order all the fattening (don't worry he works out and is skinny) stuff when we go out and I'm the one to make sure we get our greens. We ate all of this with their standard Sourdough Bread. It wasn't anything special, basic Sourdough. \n\nFor our lunch/dinner I ordered the Pacific Sole and he ordered the Lobster Tail. My dinner came with a Spinach and Red Pepper mix with Fingerling Potatoes. My husband's meal came with Mashed Potatoes and Steamed Broccoli. My dish was AMAZING!! The fish was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The butter sauce was amazing as well and probably one of the better ones I have tasted. I personally don't liked saut\u00e9ed spinach so this part wasn't my favorite. The only cooked spinach I like is creamed spinach. The red peppers added a nice touch to the fish. My only complaint about the dish is that the Potatoes could have used more seasoning or could have been crisped or something. They were just plain and put on the plate. I'm sure they were roasted but there was no crispness about them or flavor at all. My husband liked his Lobster Tail. I didn't try his lobster as I don't like the texture of lobster, but I did try his Mashed Potatoes. They were definitely a lot better than my potatoes and good. \n\nOverall, the Fog Harbor Fish House was a good place to eat. Decently priced food and drinks that are good.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

I was served the two deep fried pucks with yellow and the picture on the right was taken off yelp from a patron of this restaurant, which is what I was expecting.

Number one of course was the spectacular view on that perfect sunny Saturday. It was just perfect! Service was also phenomenal!\n\n\nWe ordered the mussel fries as a starter and clam chower bowls with crab meat. I am not a fan of mussels usually because I feel they are more on the dry side as oppose to clams, but THESE mussels were so moist and tender I've never had mussels like these before. The aioli sauce drizzled over the french fries were absolutely delicious! Sounds like a weird combo, but trust me, it is soooo good! The clam chowder I felt was a bit too thick, but it was still nonetheless delicious especially with the crab meat!\n\nMain entrees we had the half garlic roasted crab, and penne seafood pasta. The roasted garlic crab came out perfect. Everything just broke apart perfectly, no need for any utensils to open up the crab legs. It was almost like a soft shell crab in a way. The tomato cream sauce in the Penne seafood pasta was perfect! I am not really a fan of tomato sauce pasta, and cream only sauce is a bit too heavy for me, so this was a perfect combo for it was not too tangy nor heavy. \n\nOur drinks were filled constantly and our waitress checked on us very often to make sure everything was good.\n\nPLEASE give this place a try! WILL BE BACK!", "author": "Katrina Y."}

I wanted to take us out to a nice dinner and I chose Fog Harbor Fish House. \n\nIt was very easy to make a reservation. Visit their website, pick your party size and an available time. Easy and done. I called after doing that to nicely request a great table because of the special occasion. Parking is at the Pier 39 garage. Take your ticket with you to get validated (1st hour is free). Cross the street and go upstairs. Upon arriving, our reservation was ready to go. The table was at a window and that was great. I did see some others I would have rather had but oh well.\n\nI ordered the Lobster Tail and the better half ordered the Mixed Grill. When I got my plate it was barely warm but luckily the food wasn't cold. It looked amazing and the lobster tail was huge. I enjoyed my plate, it came with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. \n\nThe better half though, hers wasn't as appetizing. The salmon, swordfish AND the shrimp was dry. She was not enjoying her meal and that's frustrating because I am trying to make sure she has a fantastic meal! She gets embarrassed when I complain so I held off this evening. But I am kicking myself that I didn't say anything. She ended up putting half of her swordfish and salmon on my plate for me to eat, I couldn't even do it. It was very disappointing. \n\nThe service was not great, I'm not saying he was horrible but it felt rushed. He got our drinks, he took our food order, he delivered our food and he brought our check. I realize it's a busy restaurant but we are spending some money here, I don't want to feel rushed out of my table. He never told us his name or made any attempt to make the experience personable. Same with the host when we checked in, no nice welcome and no smile. \n\nOne last thing. Know I am not holding this against the restaurant. Remember I had called ahead and mentioned it was for a 5 year anniversary. Shawn who answered the phone said he would note it, I was very appreciative of that. I definitely don't expect anything from the restaurant but I was hoping for at least some recognition. An awesome 2 chair table (instead of 4 chairs), one of those corny desert dishes with a message or even a simple \"Happy Anniversary\". We got nothing.. I work in hospitality and have been a customer service professional for many years. I gave them an opportunity to shine and it wasn't taken.. Had they attempted to take the service up a step, I might have seen the experience differently or been able to look over the mistakes.

Touristy area, more than I thought it would be, but this place seems to be the spot. Not much to say, great food, clean restaurant, reasonable prices, happy hour draft specials ($5 for local drafts), and attentive service. I sat at the bar, enjoyed the decor and view of the water, and enjoyed the ambiance. They give you crispy sourdough bread with the meal as well.", "author": "John D."}

I was also looking for a restaurant near the cruise terminal. I was completely surprised by this perfect restaurant.\n\nFrom the outside it doesn't look like anything special and could be the same as any of the other tourist restaurants, and yet the small outside seating area where you wait before going in gives a slight hint.\n\nI was lucky to sit at one of the tables by the window and was able to watch the sunset and look at the water/boats.   The inside decor is nice and pleasant. Not run-down, so I knew someone still cares. The place was full, but not extremely full and it was a Thursday. I could tell there were tourists with a few locals.\n\nThe food is wonderful. Seafood is the main substance and our waiter didn't hesitate about suggesting a different side vegetable when he found out my dinner companion couldn't eat the side vegetable that was normally provided with her entree. I was extremely happy with the crab cake, grilled shrimp and fish & chips. Save room for dessert as that is good too. No dessert menu, but a sample dessert tray is brought to your table so you can choose. The drinks are large.\n\nWill definitely go back again.", "author": "Janice O."}

Anywho nothing was special about the clam chowder, alot better at joes crab shack. It was blah.\nAnd the salad had 4 croutons, 4 grated cheese and drenched in cesar dressing.

It was the best bread during our stay in SF because it was so warm and soft.  \n\nI then ordered the Caesar salad which was dressed nicely, had a nice salty taste from the anchovies in the dressing and had killer garlic croutons that I could've eaten like popcorn.  The salad was plenty big enough to share with my eye candy.  I also ordered the Ahi entree which was a hefty ahi tuna steak encrusted in black and white sesame seeds and cooked to perfection and rare inside.  The was sitting on top of a bed of toasted and seasoned rice and an array of saut\u00e9ed vegetables including bok choy which was so tasty.  \n\nMy husband ordered the sole which was saut\u00e9ed and served in a caper sauce and atop of vegetables and fingerling potatoes.  \n\nWe were both very satisfied and full at the end of the meal.

But, I was satisfied when my award winning clam chowder was served.  It was piping hot and the clams tasted so fresh and the chowder was rich, creamy, and very flavorful.  I had it with the sour dough bread that was given at our table.  What helped with the long wait was watching the beautiful sunset turning from orange to pink and the sun finally setting.  My group of 5 all stood up to get some pictures.  \n\nWe eventually all got our entrees another half an hour later.  My Salmon \"Club\" Salad was very good.  The portion of salmon was prepared just right.  It was moist and flaky.  The lemon vinaigrette mixed in the salad was nice and tart and the lemon ranch dressing on top of the salmon enhanced the already freshness of the fish.  I enjoyed the onions, cherry tomatoes and bacon bits throughout the dish.  This dish was pricey for a salad, $20, but well worth it.\n\nNext we were waiting for our check to come.  It was a long wait.  Our waitress apologized for our wait and her Manager decided to give us complimentary desserts for our time.  He also came to apologize for our wait.  We all ordered blondies to go.  I actually wanted to get the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9 but that wouldn't be practical to take out.  \n\nSo, I gave our experience a 4 since we had great service recovery, and the meal and scenic view was fine.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-27", "description": "So while in San Francisco I thought I would walk the Fishermans Wharf and check out the scene. After walking around for a while I was getting hungry. With so many choices I became flooded with indecision. But upon perusing the local listings this place caught my eye.\n\nI opted for a bar seat and was not disappointed. The bartender on duty was very polite and helpful. As I have never really been a seafood restaurant before. I was steered towards the combos to get a variety of seafood to try, and decided on getting a clam chowder cup, with a strawberry lemonade. And for my main course I got the fresh grilled combo. It comes with sword fish, salmon and shrimp.\n\nUpon receiving the strawberry lemonade, it was lightly sweet with a hint of sourness. A little watery, but ok. But the chowder was a real treat. It comes paired with a loaf of sourdough bread. The bread has got a nice soft, fluffy interior with a crunchy bite. By itself it is flavorful, and aromatic; but when dipped into the chowder itself it becomes a force to be reckoned with. When matted with a plat of butter the strong flavor of the sourness is apparent and the saltiness of the butter evens it out.\n\nThe chowder is smooth and creamy. Not salty nor fishy, but got a rich milky taste to it with a strong flavor of clams. Overall it is worth the money, it would be nice to see a lobster bisque offered at a place of this caliber.\n\nNow on to the main entree, the sword fish is a nice white fish. I have never had anything other than cod and halibut before so this is new. But it is very tender and mild in flavor. A slight tuna taste to it with a buttery bite. Overall a mild fish and subdued flavor.\n\nThe salmon is also extraordinarily tender, with a light crunch to the exterior. Also a light buttery taste, and more pronounced fish flavor. Which should be expected of a pink fish.\n\nAnd the shrimp is very good. Coming with a strong shrimp flavor, nice a fresh and hot. It has a light initial crunch, and a medium bite to it afterwards. There is a subtle butter, lemon taste to it, that compliments the shrimp flavor.\n\nThe sides that came with it is sauteed veggies and garlic mashed potatoes. And I opted to get some french fries instead. The garlic mashed potatoes seems to be a fresh variant as it has lumps of potato in it. And is fairly moist and creamy. Although In my opinion it is always well paired with a country gravy to further make the texture creamy and rich. The french fries are crunchy with a fluffy interior. A little on the salty side, but again not bad.\n\nSo in this honest reviewers opinion, the soup paired with the bread is fantastic, the lemonade is ok, the main entree is also fantastic, but the sides are a bit waning compared to the rest of the meal. So between the service and the attributes listed I would give it a solid 9/10 for the price class it is in. Compared to higher end restaurants could bump it down to a 7.5/10. But for the money it is well worth the time to come here.", "author": "Brock E."}

We got the Clam chowder bowls with crab. It was really good with a nice stack of fresh crab on top. The mixed grill was also good. Had to add some salt though. The Scallops and crab risotto was pretty good as well. My friend got the Lazy ciopinno which looked good added rice instead of bread. And last but not least the Garlic roasted whole dungeness crab with fingerling potatoes only it was not a whole crab just two claws and some legs. Which is why a star was lost. Would've liked to have gotten the whole crab...but otherwise a successful meal. We were too full for dessert. And had a ton of leftovers. :9 great company always makes things amazing. Good times!", "author": "Kat K."}

And after sitting down, it took forever for the waiter to take our orders. We eventually ordered the house's special clam chowder and garlic crab. What a disappointment! The chowder was too starchy and under seasoned. The crab was just okay. I will say over all food is 3 stars. But since the wait was terrible and the food was overpriced, I would not recommend. Even boudin has better clam chowder.", "author": "Yihua X."}

First off, this place really does have the best view of the water. We were seated at a table right in front of the window and we could enjoy watching the hustle and bustle down below. The view is what is bumping up the rating of this place from a 3 star to a 4 star place because the service and food is average. Warm sourdough bread is complementary! I love restaurants that still offer bread service. This is a surprise these days with most places making you pay for bread and butter. \n\nWe ordered the clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, the crab salad sandwich and half a dozen oysters. The oysters were fresh but the typical common variety so nothing special. The clam chowder actually had bits of clam in it and went really well with the bread. But next time I would just order the clam chowder without the bread bowl and save $2. They serve fresh sourdough for free which I found out after ordering. The filling in the crab salad was good as well but the fries left much to be desired. I wish they had the option of a salad or veggies with the sandwich because there's already a lot of bread so its certainly not a balanced meal.\n\nService was subpar. She was rushed, unfriendly and unable to answer my question when I asked her what variety of oysters were being served.", "author": "Jenny C."}

That we did, and decided to stop by this establishment due to the menu. We had the shell platter, cioppinno, calamari and the clam chowder. I have to say none of the dishes disappoint. You could tell the freshness of the preparation, due to the texture and taste. The sauces were exquisite which complemented all of the dishes (the shell platter and the cioppino) but of the two, we found the cioppino the best. Maybe we should have opted for the lobster tail with the platter, but we were full due to the required eating while walking pier 39. To top all of this off, we had an excellent cocktail (made of tequila) and a blondie, which is reminiscent of the pazookie, but with a chocolate nut brownie instead of a cookie, Yum!! The only balance to all this is the damage to your wallet. Depending on your order, it can be on the pricey side. Honestly speaking, i was thinking of giving it a 4.5, but our server Mel was too good that it had to become a 5. He made dinner feel like a visit to a relative that had a lot of guest. Accomodating and always mindful, it top the experience like whip cream finishes a great dessert. In not so many words... if your in the area, like seafood and good service, stop by and say hello.

In addition we ordered the blue cheese garlic bread because checking in on Pier 39 comes with an awesome yelp special for a coupon book!  I must confess to being satisfied but not overwhelmed, the bread rocked, the chowder was thick and warm but needed something else to make it pop, what I am not sure.  The crab roll on toasted sourdough was also well garnished and stuffed with crab meat but just didn't wow us!

We mentioned that we didn't like tentacles so they hooked us up by not serving us any of those. They were fried perfectly. I had the Dungeness Cheese Ravioli (seasonal special) - cheese ravioli work Dungeness crab meat on top. I'm actually surprised at the amount of crab that was on that plate. It was way more than I expected. It tastes so fresh and delicious! Highly recommend that plate if it's available when you go. My husband and I shared the clam chowder soup (regular bowl, not a bread bowl) during our second visit. It was delicious! So creamy! I loved dipping their bread into it. \n\nPricing: They can be expensive but it's a higher end restaurant, so that's to be expected.\n\nStaff: The first waitress we had was amazing. Unfortunately, I can't remember her name. She was friendly, bubbly, and super attentive. She had a smile on her face the entire time. The second waitress (named Melissa or Michelle, now I'm getting confused) wasn't as attentive. She kept attending the table behind me and didn't notice that I was trying to get her attention for quite a while to get a soda refill. She took a while to bring us the check and then a while longer to finally take the payment. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place for a nice dinner. The restaurant is right by the water so any table you get includes a nice view of the bay and marina.", "author": "Lissette B."}

They gave a pretty decent amount of clams in their soup. I'd still give it a 5/5 :) cause it was good. Not too salty , which is great.\n\nBaked Oysters (5/5) \nThe best baked oysters I've had in a LONG time ! That cheese ricotta-like on the oyster was so yummy. I'm not sure what kind of cheese they used but I'm guessing it's ricotta . I didn't read the menu for it lol. I just saw baked oysters and I had to try It. They're small oysters, so it's super yummy hehe. I recommend trying it. \n\nSeared Tuna- 2/5 \nThis entre was too salty.

Our waiter was always checking up on us, and we even had service from the District Manager Neusom, who came over and checked on us as well.

Upon closer inspection, it's actually very nice. The waiting area outside is a tiled patio with couches, a fireplace, and a painting above the fireplace, so it feels more like a cozy outdoor living room. \nThey take reservations on Opentable, which is probably a good idea for a tourist-heavy location.\nThe menu includes a variety of seafood dishes and quite a few fried items. For a seafood restaurant, there is a good amount of land dishes for those who don't eat seafood. We had a cozy table by the window and enjoyed the waterfront view during dinner.\n\nCrispy Bay Scallops ($13) - panko breaded & fried, w/ roasted jalapeno aioli:\nI was hoping the scallops would have a light crunchy panko crust, but the tiny bite-sized bay scallops were completely coated in breading and unrecognizable as scallops. It was my mistake. I should have guessed panko breaded meant covered in panko. It was too much breading and a little too oily for me to enjoy them as scallops. If I knew they would have that much breading, I wouldn't have ordered this dish. It's not bad for a deep-fried snack. The thick, heavy jalapeno aioli added a little bit of a kick.\n\nShellfish Platter ($38 for 1, $59 for 2) - 1/2 crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, oven roasted w/ butter, garlic, herbs:\nThe shellfish massacre presented in front of us was seasoned nicely and tasted quite fresh. The crab legs were sweet and meaty. The mussels and clams were nice and springy. The shrimp at the bottom of the plate soaked up all the buttery juices and herbs. It also came with some corn on the cob and garlic toast. \n\nBread Pudding ($8.50) - topped w/ vanilla ice cream, vanilla bean sauce, dusted with cocoa powder:\nDinner was a little salty, so I wanted something sweet. I'm fond of bread pudding, so that was an easy choice. It was served warm and gooey and the edges were a little crispy.\n\nWhile we ate, we enjoyed watching the sunset over the water.

The oysters were great, hard to screw those up if you have a good purveyor.  I ordered the mixed grill (salmon, swordfish, and shrimp) and once again was underwhelmed. There was no seasoning and the lemon buerre blanc was runny and had little flavor. Regarding service...I was not offered bread at any point even though every table around me received some. My water glass was empty more often than it was full. I'm\nNot sure how this place has so many great reviews other than they must be tourists and/or have low expectations.

The only disappointing thing was that there was no crab inside the ravioli, only on top. For dessert, we tried the mini creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e and flourless chocolate cake combo and the blondie with ice cream. Actually liked the blondie much more than the chocolate cake, and I'm a huge fan of chocolate. Well done. \n\nService was okay, not stellar, but nothing really to complain about.

For the area, this restaurant gives a decent value with nice views in what is decidedly a tourist-trap area. If you'd rather skip the Bubba Gump's and Hard Rock's of the world, this is a solid option. However, our dining experience had a few gaffes. \n\nFirst, our utensils & glassware consistently required changing (lipstick on wine glass & dried on food on two soup spoons). These were however met with apologies & swift changes. \n\nSecond, there was a shift-change during our visit. Upon asking what the side dishes that came with the cod were, I was informed chorizo & white beans. Mmm, delicious. Unfortunately, I was served blah green beans & garlic mashed potatoes. Apparently they had run out of the normal side but not informed our server. I was offered another dish or a complimentary side. I begrudgingly chose another side. \n\nLastly, the cod portion was very small for the price. It was delicious and I wanted more! With the understanding that we were eating in a touristy area in an expensive city, cod is a fairly cheap fish. However, my wife & I both enjoyed the quality of our food. \n\nSolid, albeit not great, restaurant in an area filled with chains & meh tourist traps.

The open door policy and greeting at the door was very inviting. The hostess was friendly and showed us to a table for two by the window. My wife faced the bay and I faced the tourists walking the Embarcadero, perfect. The bird droppings on the window didn't detour us from ordering a wonderful lunch. Edgar, our waiter, did a fine job of serving us. The restaurant was almost empty when we entered but became packed by noon. Our menu: my wife started out with the fabulous baked oysters, with a cocktail of a Hibiscus Margarita. The clam chowder cup was perfect but I added a pinch of salt to bring in the true sea flavor. I had a really good Prosecco which cleansed the pallet for each new flavor. We split a Cal crab Caesar for $30.00 and this is why this rating is NOT a 5 star. The lettuce was really \"off color\", seemed bagged and had a strange if not bland taste. We separated the lettuce from the wonderful crab, bacon and croutons which made it perfect. The main course of Scallops was perfect with crab and just a touch of cheese in the Risotto.

Our server, Kayla, was excellent, very attentive and quick. They serve a non-alcoholic wine beverage, which was great news since I'm pregnant. We started with the clam chowder soup and couldn't resist adding the crab. It was so creamy and flavorful and paired perfectly with the sourdough bread. We also shared the fried calamari. It is served with fried onions and jalape\u00f1os which was a great combination since I love calamari and my husband doesn't. The dipping sauce for the calamari was the best. I had the mixed grill for dinner and my husband had the scallop and crab risotto (a special that night). The risotto was creamy, cheesy and full of crab. The scallops were seared and buttery. The mixed grill fish and shrimp were grilled perfectly and the mashed potatoes and green beans were flavorful. We requested a seat by the window when we made our reservation and had a wonderful view of the sunset.

We took the cube out and found there was very little actual Manhattan left in the glass. I paid $14 for that?

But it's right at the front, on the upper floor so you can mostly dodge the tourists quickly.  Great harbor views and if the sea lions are in the harbor you can watch them too.  Liked the large windows and the nice white table cloth covered tables.  The staff was efficient and friendly.  The best part of the decor is you are not \"squished in\" like at the crab house just a few doors over.  Their menu is obviously focused on seafood but they also have non seafood menu items like steak and sandwiches.  We went so I could get my crab fix because I absolutely love Dungeness crab. We got the clam chowder. It was good and satisfying.  The hot sourdough bread was yummy too.  My hubby and I shared the seafood feast for two.  Steamed and then with garlic and butter.  I would have liked more garlic and butter.  Used the sourdough at the end to sop up all the garlicky buttery goodness.  I would have preferred more clams and less mussels but it's a nice mix of crab, clams, mussels, shrimp and fingerling potatoes.  I wanted the whole crab, but at $45 for nothing but crab, I feel like what we got was a better value.  The whole crab price is kind of the going rate... sigh... I don't know why it's so expensive when it's local, but I guess demand drives the price.  All in all it was a good meal and a nice atmosphere.  I'll go again.

Food was ok, but not as great as you would expect. \n\nWe chose this place based on overall rating. When we first arrived, I asked to look at a menu before deciding to be seated. At front, they're friendly and really trying to get you in. As we decided to dine here, I requested a table by the window. They said they'd get as as close as possible. When we came in, they originally were going to seat us in a booth near the back. There were several tables by the window, so I asked again if we could sit there. The hostess from the front had to come and she said most tables were reserved and others were for larger parties. Ok, fair enough, so I ask for a table one row off. \n\nWhen we were finally seated, our server came. She spoke in a monotone, very quickly, and seemed very serious. No smile, no welcome, no how are you doing. She asked if we had dined there before and after we said no, there was no follow up. So there was basically no point in asking. She wasn't a bad server, but for a place that is located in a tourist location, I would think servers would be friendly and welcoming. \n\nThe complimentary bread was average. It was nice to have to dip into the clam chowder, but on its own is average. To eat we ordered a bowl of clam chowder, Shellfish platter for 2, and the crab roll. The calm chowder was probably the best part of the meal. It didn't have a ton of potatoes, which was good, and overall I liked it. The crab roll was bland. It definitely needed flavoring added. The Shellfish platter for 2 wasn't as much as we had expected for the price. We decided to get dessert elsewhere. \n\nIf customer service was better I would have rated higher. For food, I would definitely recommend the clam chowder.", "author": "Ros A."}

There are many great spots for clam chowder in San Francisco, but I've never had it topped with Dungeness Crab!! What a great way to start our meal! (Check out my pic)\n\nAlso mind blowing was the seared Ahi Tuna. It's perfectly seared \"rare\" and topped with a delicious ginger soy glaze, accompanied perfectly with a garlic jasmine rice. My mouth could barely contain this flavor flurry.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Mixed Grill: grilled salmon, swordfish, and shrimp served with a citrus beurre blanc over garlic mashed potatoes. Had I not eaten so much delicious sourdough bread prior to our food arrival, I would have eaten more of his food too! \n\nDid I mention there's also a beautiful view of the wharf?? It was the perfect birthday dinner! Definitely coming back next time we're in town!!", "author": "Liz G."}

Of all things at the bar, we ended up with two non-alcoholic drinks. However, they were probably two of the best non-alcoholic drinks I've had. The strawberry nojito (clever right?!) is legitimate.  The bartender even made us a complimentary ginger lemonade. \n\nWhat I really want to talk about are the mussel fries. I normally like mussels but these made me fall in love all over again. The mussels were plump and fresh, which is expected because the restaurant is literally sitting on top of water. But geez they were delicious floating in the rich white sauce with cream and onions. I took sourdough and soaked all that flavor up before the wait staff decided there wasn't any left and took my dish away. Get this!", "author": "Quoc N."}

They still let in a lot of light. The windows were open and the breezes were wonderful.\n\nThe waiter was very helpful and attentive. I ordered the clam chowder and the cioppino. I was asked if I wanted extra crab added and I said yes. I was surprised when the clam chowder came with a huge serving of crab meat right in the middle. I was expecting the crab in the cioppino. The crab was a nice addition to the soup, but it was crab, which distracted from the taste of the CLAM chowder and it was not warm, which made the soup not so hot. I thought that was odd.\n\nThe cioppino was good, but not great. It was heavy on celery, which is not my favorite. It was a bit underwhelming.", "author": "Scott N."}

Still I feel I have to write about this amazing place on Pier 39.\n\nFog Harbor has just spectacular bay views. But what's really spectacular is what goes on in the ktichen.  First, they let you know what's fresh - for example if crabs aren't in season you'll know beforehand they were frozen, although that doesn't seem to impact how darn good they are anyway.\n\nSecond, even though it's on Pier 39, don't think about this as a tourist place, even though I'm sure there are plenty of tourists. Instead, think sustainably harvested fish, appetite-inducing appetizers, a menu with so many options you can have analyis paralysis, and a staff that from top to bottom works to ensure you have a great experience, not just a great meal.\n\nSo yes, I do know the management team... but if you're near the wharf and you like seafood I can't imagine a better place for dinner.\n\n'Nuff said.", "author": "Mike K."}

He settled on a location at Pier 39?!?! My past life in SF told me \"Seriously?? Pier 39?!\" But to my surprise we gave my friend a call and she said that she thought the exact same thing but they have the best clam chowder ever.  She was right. \n\nWe got there put our names in for a table about 30 min wait but they text you when the table is ready which is great since you can then wander around Pier 39.  But we ended up scoring a seat at the bar within about 5 mins so we just ate there.  Awesome staff, we ordered a few rounds of cocktails, a clam chowder bread bowl with crab, a clam chowder and caesar salad combo, calamari and some oysters.  \n\nTab price wasn't too bad and it was a gorgeous restaurant, good service, great food and gorgeous views!

I wanted to have some clam chowder and whatever other seafood was available. I visited this place with my family so we got to order quite a few things and shared everything.  We tried some clam chower bowls, seasonal lobster ravioli, seafood penne, their mixed grill, and fish and chips.  I thought that everything tasted really delicious and fantastic.  My brother who lives in San Francisco, said he's had better clam chowder so I guess it's preference.  \n\nWe visited on a friday night, so it was very busy and lively in the restaurant. Service wasn't bad, it would've been nice if the waitress had checked on us a few more time because we ran out of beverages and had to try to flag her down.

After the samples, I decided I had to try out their restaurant at Pier 39. \n\nWhat did I discover after my visit to Fog Harbor?\n\nI could come to Fog Harbor everyday for their fresh warm complimentary bread and a giant bowl of their clam chowder! Their clam chowder was the best I have had in the west coast. The crab cake entree was also a hit with my taste buds. The ingredients tasted fresh and the final product came out with a perfect texture. \n\nService was excellent too. Our service staff took great care of us and tended to all of our needs. The only aspect of the meal I was dissatisfied with was the $4.50 lemonade. Half the glass was filled with ice, leaving little room for the actual lemon juice.

I was pleasantly surprised!  The food was delicious and the service was great...the meal started with warm sourdough bread, then we ordered the mussel fries, calamari, steamed clams and jumbo shrimp cocktail appetizers. All were very good (I'm still unsure of the combination of mussels and fries but the mussels were awesome and the sauce with the fries were tasty). Then for dinner I had the crab roll which was good, 8/10. At our table we also ordered the soup and salad-Cesar salad and clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl, the flat iron steak, and the shellfish platter. Everybody was satisfied when we left; a bit touristy and, because of that, a bit more pricey but overall a good meal and experience.

I've heard and read good things about the Fog Harbor Fish House and the oh so convenient entrance from the parking garage (located in between The Embarcadero and Powell St) made going to this restaurant so easy. There's a little pathway/bridge from the parking garage that takes you right up to the dock on which the Fog Harbor Fish House is located. No worries about the wait there might be to be seated. They created a super cosy waiting area with seats in front of a fireplace to keep you warm. \n\nThe Fog Harbor Fish House is bigger than it appears to be from the dock. This is where you want to go with family and friends, or even a date (!) for an upper casual dinner. Upper casual because at night they create a nice ambience with the lighting, but wearing jeans and sneakers is definitely not a crime. \n\nAmbience: \nGreat! A perfect 'I'm going out for dinner and I can dress up a little' vibe. You can be seated right next to the water which also adds something special to the overall ambience.\n\nFood: \nGood selection of different types of dishes. Salmon, swordfish, calamari, shellfish, fried fish... name it and they have it.\n\nDrinks: \nWe all ordered cocktails but none of us really enjoyed them. The Moscow Mule was good. I'd suggest to stick wine.\n\nThe Fog Harbor Fish House is a place where you cannot go wrong. I feel anyone would enjoy to eat here while having a great night out.", "author": "Kirstin G."}

My sister and I came in when there was a 1.5 hour wait on Sunday night and decided to opt for the bar instead. Luckily, someone left so we grabbed two seats with a view to watch the Olympics, score! We ended up staying for more than just drinks and oysters and Jason N was excellent every step of the way. I always expect some witty banter and jokes from the bartender but Jason went above and beyond to ensure we had a great dining experience, which we did. It was more than just ensuring our drinks were full and cold, he always checked in with us and did it with a smile on his face. What really put him at 5 stars for me was how well he handled an issue with our meal. We brought up the issue not thinking much about it, but Jason went above our expectations, brought it up with his manager to help ensure we could really enjoy our meal and dining experience. I rarely get such wonderful service and definitely wanted to mention it because it made all the difference for us! \n\nAs far as the food, I enjoyed the oysters very much! Really fresh and perfect start to our meal. I ordered the mixed grill plate with was a great way to try out their shrimp, swordfish and salmon with mashed potatoes and vegetables. I'd say the shrimp was my favorite with lots of flavor from their rub. My sister ordered the linguini and clams and enjoyed that as well. I also tried out their two signature bourbon cocktails which were wonderful, although the old fashioned was a bit too sweet for me.\n\nOverall, my dining experience at Fog Harbor at their bar was wonderful! I would definitely recommend others to try them out.", "author": "Crystal R."}

I like to be comfortable when I eat! Of course, we said yes because the sooner we ate the better, but this is now  probably contributing to my rating of the place due to my discomfort. \n\nAfter we were seated, I noticed the plates that were already placed on the table for bread weren't even washed. We had to replace all of them because there was dry food and even wet food marks on all of them. The table cloth's exposed area that would be grazing our legs was either very stained or just unwashed.\n\nThe service wasn't very welcoming. And the food itself was hella bland. I ordered the Crab Roll $19...I asked to substitute the french fries for sweet potato fries but was told they don't serve sweet potato fries even tho pictures on yelp indicated that they do...Whatever, man haha.

There are locals here as well.  For despite its location Fog Harbor is anything but a tourist trap.  Rather it is a goodwill ambassador for San Francisco being as good as it is.  Simply put Fog Harbor has great food, great service, a beautiful location overlooking the water, and the food is priced right.  Let me enumerate.\n\nOn arriving at the restaurant forty minutes early for my reservation I asked to hostess if it would be possible to seat me.  With a cheerful \"Yes\" she got me seated at a great table within five minutes.  A nice welcome is always appreciated.\n\nOn being seated my outstanding server Luana cheerfully greeted me and provided water and a loaf of wonderful sourdough bread.  Luana was very helpful in going over the menu with me thereby helping me order an outstanding meal.  For health reasons I have to limit my salt intake.  Luana let me know exactly what plates and components of plates had salt already built in or where salt could be held back.  And just when she had my main course ordered she went to the kitchen to remind the chefs to restrict salt where possible. You could go to any of the best, top-tier restaurants in San Francisco and not find better service than was provided me by Luana.  \n\nMy first course was a bowl of clam chowder to which they added crab for a quite reasonable surcharge.  The chowder may have been a bit too thick but it was filled with clams; and my goodness the crab atop the soup was sweet and well portioned.  Fog Harbor provides ample portions of very good food at a very fair price.  \n\nMy main course was seared pacific cod which came with white beans, tomatoes and spinach.  Normally when you see the fish atop something it is the less expensive components of the plate.  Here the cod was served atop more cod.  The cod was perfectly cooked and pristine.

I wasn't blown away by any of it. I tasted all 3 plates and I felt as if the price we paid I could have done all of it at home. ( my brother and boyfriend even said it)\n\nOur waiter was pretty attentive he made sure to say hello as we were seated and let us know he would be right with us.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-16", "description": "I would give the Fog Harbor Fish House 3 1/2 stars because it's a little better than just OK. We had a good experience and the service was impeccable, the restaurant was clean, and the view was perfect. For food, we decided to go with a selection of appetizers, which included the red chili garlic shrimp, the mussel fries, and the Dungeness crab cocktail. We also had two Moscow Mules. All were fairly priced, relative to similar establishments in the area. By far, our favorite was the mussel fries, which we thought was an inspired idea (we since learned that it seems to be a common dish in the Bay area). The shrimp were large and well-cooked, and the crab was wonderfully tasty. And the Mules were well-mixed.\n\nOur biggest complaint here was the overall lack of zest in the sauces. In a word, they were mostly boring. Serviceable, but boring. For example, I think serving run-of-the-mill cocktail sauce with that delectable crab meat is a mistake. I would go with something much more subtle but enhancing, such as a delicate lemon-saffron sauce or even a lightly spiced creme fraiche. Sure, offer the cocktail sauce for those who may want it, but this app screams for something more daring to help it stand above. So offer a selection of sauces. With the mussels, I didn't taste any garlic in the garlic aioli and sadly there was not enough of the cream sauce to truly enjoy it. And the sauce that accompanied the shrimp was ... eh. Could have been a lot more spicy.\n\nAs I said, our experience was good and maybe if we had gone with full-on meals rather than a sampling of apps, I might have rated it higher. I will add that for what we got, we left with satisfied appetites - I even left with some of the crab meat. If I get to the area again, I would return to Fog Harbor.", "author": "Ralph M."}

A lot of the food seems to have super heavy creams involved the way banquet dinner meals are. That kind of thing is fine at first but after 6 bites it's just too much. \n\nI got the mussel fries since it was one of the only handful of items on the menu under $20, and thought the fries were great, the mussels were terrible. Of the bowl I had, FIVE of the shells were empty and one of the was still very sealed shut. When it came down to it, more than a 3rd of my mussels were duds and the ones that were actually in their shells were pretty awful. They had this strange taste to them that was a tinge foul and paired with the sauces, wasn't good. \n\nIf you go and you're on a budget, I think the soup in a bread bowl and salad combo is the way to go. It's enough food for 2 people given the heaviness and the bread (sourdough, of course) was darn delicious. \n\nI could see where it'd be a cute date spot for an older couple who's touristing, but I don't think I'll see myself back again.", "author": "Candice G."}

At about $14 you get a small salad with a huge bowl of chowder in the most delicious sour dough bread bowl. I dare you to try and finish any of it. Have I had better chowda? Puhlease, I'm from New England. I've had better chowda. This was the generic cream based New England chowder. Plenty of potatoes and clams, but it could have used some pancetta or some renegade ingredient to spice things up a bit. Have I had better salads in my day? Yes. This was some romaine lightly dressed. I opted for the $6 crab add on (shredded crab) and I highly suggest you do not follow my lead. Not worth it and did nothing to the flavor of the salad.\n\nMy friend was a little disappointed in her mussel fries which basically consisted of some mussels - most empty and closed and fries in a white creamy sauce. Again at $14, not so bad, but not the best bargain around. Most of the entrees start at about $30+ and sandwiches at about $15+. * The complimentary sour dough to start was delicious and a great way to fill up a little if you decide to go light.\n\nGreat views of the pier, friendly service albeit a bit too friendly, sometimes a gal likes to be left alone to eat, solid food makes this a pricy power lunch that filled me up throughout the day (no dinner needed).

At one point I tried to get the attention of a busser setting a table across from us.  I said excuse me 3 times and was totally ignored.  He did hear me because he came back later and asked if I needed something.  We asked for our check and the server walked by again and again before bringing it.  When I was returning from the bathroom he handed me the check in the hallway.  I took it back to the table and put the card in it and then watched him walk back and forth looking at it several times before actually picking it up.  \n\nI've was a server and I've waited on the owners before.

If only it weren't in such a touristy area, but I can get over that. You have a spectacular view of the water and Alcatraz. This place is perfect for before/ after any boat tour or Alcatraz tour. The only reservation I could get was for 11:30 a.m-- make one when you know you will be coming, this place books up QUICK! \n\nDelicious everything. Everything.  I probably had the best clam chowder that I have ever tasted here. At first I ordered a cup, but then decided to order another bowl for my meal with some shrimp. OMG the shrimp was heaven. So succulent & fresh. Big shrimp too, none of that skimpy, shriveled garbage. \n\nYUM!!!!!!!! This is a must when visiting.", "author": "Jenna H."}

It was only moderately busy around noon on a Monday, so I got immediately seated next to a window with a view of the water. \n\nThe server was attentive and suggested I try one of the specials that just started this week... More on that later. \n\nI had the clam chowder with sourdough on the side to start. I've had a lot of clam chowders in my day, and this by far is one of the best if not best I've ever had. Not too dairy creamy... Tons of clam meat... Not overloaded with potatoes and seasoned just right. The hot sourdough bread was also very tasty... Served piping hot and fresh. \n\nNow for my main entree I had the king salmon special. What can I say? Pine nuts, avocado, orzo, locally caught king salmon, fennel, and a nice salad... Talk about explosion of flavor. Besides the salad/orzo combination being amazing by itself, the king salmon was cooked to perfection... With a delicate texture, nice seasoned crust and that bright red color... All in all a very good piece of fish. \n\nThe only downside to this place is the cost, but you get what you pay for.

There is also a cozy fireplace and couches if you want to wait outside the restaurant. Service was great. As for the food we ordered the seafood mix, Cioppino, fresh oyster appetizer, and muscle frys appetizer.... I will tell you the Cioppino was good I have had a few places cook it a little better but that doesn't mean that it was not good, the seafood mix was amazing I loved the fresh butter and kind of garlic herb taste it had, the oysters were good and fresh (but if u just want oysters go somewhere else this place is more for a full meal dining experience) the muscle fries I wasn't a big fan of I think it had a little bit too much truffle but that's just me personally. For dessert we got the Blondie brownie which was amazing! I loved how they had a tray of all their desserts prepared for us to see and choose from.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-25", "description": "My bias: Pier 39 a tourist trap, mediocre food, not birthday worthy food, but my niece and nephew wanted to go here, and I couldn't refuse them. We had no reservations, 6 of us on a Saturday night, they were packed, yet we were seated in half hour--impressive. I was blown away with the ambience inside: cavernous space, floor to ceiling windows, sweeping gorgeous views of the water, picturesque boats docking, sun glistening, charming landscape. We were seated on the more intimate and quiet upper level, white tablecloths banquette. Our server was energetic, warm, sweet, eager to please. Throughout the meal he was engaged and responsive, proactive, came back to check on us several times and was endlessly patient, e.g. my niece and nephew had an attack of paralysis over the dessert :-) The food: holy sweet mother of God, WTF are these people doing in the kitchen? They're rocking the shit out of it, is what. For starters: shellfish platter and caesar salad. The complimentary bread are rolls, mini sourdough dutch crunch bites, but with a dense, toothsome texture.  A basket of these with soft consistency butter. Gluten-free be damned, I scarfed down 2. The caesar is whole romaine leaves, dressed with a tangy anchovy/egg based dressing, a beautiful balance of tart and creamy, simple yet beyond. The shellfish platter is a sight: half crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, fingerling potatoes roasted with butter, garlic, herbs, lemon wedges. The remarkable thing: it's more than the sum of its parts, not disparate items arranged on a platter. Everything is a symphony. The fish screams pristine FRESH ... this is what SF should be and damn if I wasn't proud to be a local. I got the Seared Pacific Cod,  white beans infused with chorizo butter, spinach, topped with garlic  aioli. This dish left all of us agape--it's an ode to hearty flavors of smoky white beans and wilted spinach, tiny bits of tomato, the broth a rich base. Fyi, cod doesn't usually excite me, but because of the freshness and charred seared cooking technique, I'm a convert. My husband had the cioppino: salmon chunks, clams, shrimp, scallops, mussels stewed in a tomato seafood broth, which was the perfect consistency, not overly thick and not watery either, with a kick of spice, more like lingering heat than a kick to the palate. Neither my niece and nephew, nor my brother had tried cioppino before, and it was unanimous: they loved it. My brother had their crab meat topped filet mignon with a demi glace, garlic mashed potatoes, and spinach. He likes his meat medium well, and they cooked it within an inch of perfection--melt in your mouth tender, yet done all the way through, flavorful with the crab finishing touch, and again the dish came together like a music riff. My sister in law had their fish and chips, and while she loved the fish, the fries she prefers to be thick and soft, rather than skinny and crunchy, but that's not a cooking thing, it's more of a personal preference. My niece and nephew ordered their lobster mac n cheese, and while it's clearly full of quality ingredients, it was a tad dry and not creamy enough. Did I mention that I had their non-alcoholic ginger beer, soda with a strong ginger punch, pieces of fresh ginger over crushed ice. After our entrees, our server, whose name I wish I'd gotten to applaud him publicly, came over with a dessert tray, and asked me to pick out whatever I wanted. We settled on the chocolate banana bread pudding, made with Boudin's fresh sourdough bread, baked with banana and chocolate and topped with vanilla bean sauce. I usually hate bread pudding, it's an oxymoron--\"bread\" and \"pudding\" cancels each other out, right? NOT! Bittersweet chocolate, fresh banana, spooned into creamy decadent consistency, delicate vanilla sauce. 6 of us lunging for that plate was not a pretty sight :-)  Our server came over to take out photo and sang happy birthday, all of them so obviously enjoying being there and taking pride in doing their job well--thank you all of you, and I promise when I return, I'll make a point of getting all your names--you deserve a public shout out :-)  Hours later, as we wound down our dinner, it was dark outside and fireworks exploded outside, massive coronas of light, yellow and red in bursts of sunlike spirals ... it was a gift out of nowhere, a spontaneous  celebratory bang and perfect ending to the meal.", "author": "Ranjan P."}

Are they the best I've ever had? No.\n\nThe restaurant is clean, cleanly bathrooms, and you're likely to get seated promptly as I was.\n\nThe staff is not friendly. I don't think they like single diners. The frown the hostess made when I asked for a table for one, then as she took me in back she verified that I indeed wanted a table and not the bar. She eventually sat me at a table reluctantly. My waiter was not pleased to see the table just being me. No smile, no nothing. Just \"are you ready to order?\" He did attempt to upsell me. I said I just wanted a soda and a bread bowl chowder. I let him know I'll be running to the restroom, there's fresh drinks on my table, and I see either a manager or a busser trying to clean my table. Mind you, it had my things on it and a jacket on the chair. My drink is wrong, I have it corrected. I get my food, finish, and my waiter asks if I want dessert after I just asked for the check.\n\nThe soda is $3.95. That's about 40% of how much the chowder costs. Pricey.\n\nI still tipped Samir over 25%. Not because I thought he deserved it, but because I didn't have change nor did I feel like waiting on a couple bucks in an establishment.\n\nI get it. Waiters need bigger tables for more money, but if you give single people like me great service, we usually tip a bigger percentage contrary to our bill. We also are easier to get in and out. I stayed for no more than 30 minutes. Having a bad attitude about serving single person tables just makes it for single people to not want to bring family and friends.\n\nNeedless to say, my craving has been taken care of. I do not foresee myself coming back to this establishment with any of my family or friends. Staff is just unfriendly. And yes, when a table of 2 got seated behind me, Samir was all smiles and upbeat friendly...you get what you give out. Give people bad vibes, they are more likely to return the favor. Rather than tipping poorly, I'm just writing a negative review on their bad attitudes towards lone diners.\n\nDo yourselves a favor and hold in your contempt and disdain until we are not in your face.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-19", "description": "What is it about Fog Harbor Fish House that I love so much that every time I am in the Pier 39 or North Beach area whether with tourists or friends this is the one place I take them to? Maybe its because of their amazing clam chowders and tasty crab cakes, or for the fact for as long I always known about this place the wait is never long, as there seems to always be plenty of room to get a table or a place at the bar even during the prized Happy Hour.\n\nAnd that's the best part of Fog Harbor Fish House, the food is fresh and nicely prepared and, for the most part, is an affordable option in the tourist mecca that is Pier 39. They represent the perfect kinds of seafood dishes that San Francisco has to offer. For the most part they are always filled at Fog Harbor, thanks to their stable of dishes from seafood to meats. \n\nMy friend and I were hungry, so I knew for this trip the Happy Hour menu would be perfect for us as we had another place to get to after our early meal. So when in doubt after perusing the Happy Hour menu, which is very short for a Happy Hour menu, as it only has four dishes total, we simply went with everything on it: fried calamari, red chili shrimp, chicken wings, and garlic fries. Their cocktail menu is actually really thorough, especially for Happy Hour and for some reason I always go with the tried and true, the Lombard Lemonade with its SVEDKA Raspberry vodka, black raspberry liqueur, and fresh squeezed lemonade, it went down like juice, smooth with a hint of sourness. And at 6 dollars for the drink for their Happy Hour price, it wasn't exactly a 50 percent off discount, but it was a reasonably enough priced drink that made me want to drink some more!\n\nAs for our dishes, the garlic fries, as always are solid, the perfect Bay Area treat if one could call it that, the crispy lemon calamari served with lemon aioli was nice and crunchy and tasted better than most. The chicken wings were tart and tasty but I felt that a real miss with the Red Chili Garlic Shrimp with its red chili paste, onions, red peppers and garlic, it featured only a handful of shrimp but plenty of an oily red sauce that enveloped the entire dish. With one toasted piece of baguette bread for \"dipping\" the meal left me wanting something more filling, Thankfully, Fog Harbor offered complimentary warm sourdough bread with butter without asking. Another benefit to sitting at the bar is that Fog Harbor also offers complimentary usage of their portable cell phone battery chargers for those who need a charge but forgot their cords or can't find an outlet. A place that provides an affordable meal and an iPhone charge? We really are in the 21st century aren't we?  \n\nI really do like Fog Harbor, it's really the only place I regularly go to in that touristy area. But be forewarned it,,like many other places in the area, can get pricier the further you look down their menu. Besides going for Happy Hour my best recommendations would be the crab cakes in the appetizer menu, which always taste hearty and fresh and are under twenty dollars as well as the award-winning clam chowder which in a sourdough bowl clocks in at 10 dollars which is quite reasonable. I've been to Fog Harbor when they're slammed and when things are slow, it's the overall quality of food and service that always makes me come back for more each and every time.", "author": "Jason F."}

We arrived and were taken to a non-window table.  We saw that there were some available and asked if we could sit there instead, but were told those tables were for people with reservations.  We said we did have a reservation (which we already informed the host of), we were taken back to the front and had to wait about 20 minutes before we were finally seated at a window table.\n\nService was decent, but not great.  The food was also decent, but not great- crab legs were overcooked and tough, and the food was lukewarm.  The wedge salad and creme brulee were the best parts, to be honest.

There was about a 30/45 minute wait so we walked around the pier. They have a lovely gas fireplace out front with seats to get warm while you wait. We started off with a waiter(older gentleman, bald and short) who seemed up tight, no smile and not friendly. He ended up leaving before our food arrived and we had a waiter named Daniel. As soon as Daniel was introduced to us, the 5 start service began! Daniel was OUTSTANDING!! He provided us the BEST service i have ever received at a restaurant in my life! He was knowledgeable, enthusiastic and professional. He checked on us frequently and made us feel like we were a priority. He gave us great recommendations on the desserts and they were mighty delicious! The food was great but Daniel 's service is what made me give this place 5 stars. He is a great representation of this upscale waterfront restaurant. I will be returning to San Fran and I will make sure to visit this restaurant and ask for Daniel as my waiter.

Fog Harbor was very busy - sporting a 30 minute wait at 3:00 p.m., we were given the option (party of five) to sit at the bar area tables.  A good choice, since we were just snacking and going.  \n\nFirst up:  the obligatory sourdough.  Oh my...it could be a meal by any other name.  I dreamed of all the things I could put on it to make the worlds most amazing sandwhich....oh wait, I digress!  \n\nWe ordered a sampling of items - the fried calamari (crisp, appropriately prepared), the mussels with shallots and garlic and fries - outstanding and to top it off their best in San Francisco (their claim) chowder.

The waiting area is nice because there was a fire place to keep you nice and warm. I would say that we were seated at the 45-minute mark, so the hostess gave a great estimate. \n\nThe restaurant has very dim lighting which is great because it accentuates the light setting across the bay and ferries as you look outside. Our waiter was great! He took our orders whenever we were ready and was very prompt in delivering our drinks and food. I ordered the \"skinny\" version (148 calories) of the Cucumber-Basil Gimlet ($11.50) and the Short Rib Pappardelle ($24). While waiting for our food, he gave us fresh, warm bread which was absolutely delicious. For a party of 9, we devoured the bread instantly. Oops! \n\n- CUCUMBER-BASIL GIMLET ($11.50): it is a refreshing drink! I couldn't really taste any alcohol at all, so don't expect to get drunk off of this drink. To be honest, if you've eaten pho, this drink totally reminds me of it because of the basil, but I'm not complaining! \n\n- SHORT RIB PAPPARDELLE ($24): boy oh boy, this dish looked completely appetizing and smelled amazing when it was placed in front of me. I instantly dove straight in to eating it because I could not resist. As I was eating it, I did realize that this dish can be pretty salty, so prepare to drink lots of water! However, the short rib was tender, and the noodle was cooked perfectly. I would recommend that if you are interested in ordering the dish, you should order more bread because the sauce taste fantastic with the bread as well! Carb overload! \n\nThis restaurant was great as we enjoyed our time here because each one of us enjoyed our food. On top of that, since we were celebrating my birthday, the waiter brought out a Creme Br\u00fbl\u00e9e for me which was absolutely delicious.", "author": "Susan V."}

We looked on Yelp and that's how we found Fog Harbor Fish House. The restaurant was busy; very ambient, fun, and family friendly. We got seated immediately though and the view was very nice. We could see the Golden Gate in the distance, the restaurant was right by the sea so on one side you could gaze out into the sea and on the other you could people watch and see the city itself. The food was delicious and is the biggest reason I'm giving four stars. We got the clam chowder in a bread bowl and wow both my girlfriend and I agreed it was the best clam chowder we've ever had. The chowder was thick, creamy, and had just enough seafood and the bread bowl was very complimentary to the chowder. My girlfriend got the Swordfish and she said the fish was cook very well and the sauce enhanced the fish. I got the Seafood Penne and the mixture of pasta, fish, shellfish, and tomatoes was perfect. You could taste everything and nothing took away flavor from another. Overall the meal was delicious and although pricey I would say being seafood and the location the price was fair. The only reason I'm giving four stars instead of five is because our waitress didn't seem to happy to be there while rest of the staff seemed happy.

The gentlemen that escorted us to our table (not sure if he was a manager helping out or what) but he wasn't friendly. Basically just sat us at our table and handed us the menus. No \"welcome to fog harbor...such and such will be with you shortly\" so we just all sat staring at each other until the waitress came over. It took her awhile but thankfully she was sweet. Her name was Sarah. We ordered the Hibiscus Margarita (really good) and the other blAckberry drink. Had the clam chowder. Pretty good choice. Also the calamari was reallly reallly good! My son enjoyed the sliders also. For our next course we had the garlic crab and the lobster. Both were great choices. Other than the blah hostesses, everything went well!", "author": "Chloe C."}

Tyler was a fantastic, attentive and helpful server. He even brought my daughter a birthday dessert and sang happy birthday with us . I didn't think this restaurant did that kind of thing (and we had 3 little kids with us BTW) . The food was great.  Wonderful raw oysters, yummy clam chowder, and you have to try the clams linguine.

That clam chowder is remarkable among all the dishes there and I will only be going for that in the future. The ambiance is just right and adds an extra layer to this great place.

So you can bet that I'm a food snob with a need for good atmosphere. It should also say a lot that I'm writing this review three days later back in my home state.\n\nI also want to start by saying I have always been turned off by fish. My dad had made fun of me my whole life for disliking fish since it's mostly what my family eats except for me. \n\nI ordered the pacific sole (their fresh caught fish of the day) and it was delicious as all heck! It inspired me to eat more fish in the future. \nIt was well cooked, So the meat had been tender, flavorful, and moist and well seasoned to cut the fishiness. The choice was suggested by our waiter who had been patient even when I had been a little rude and loud - a typical college kid with too much freedom. The greens that came with the fish was well balanced with the fish and steamed well too. \n\nThe sparkling ginger lemonade had been refreshing after a day of touristing the area like a chicken with no head or direction. It had a nice zing of ginger, but well balanced with the sweetness of the lemonade. It also helped soothe my headache. \n\nThe calamari was a bit pricy for the amount you received and didn't seem too special. It was tender and the skin was crispy though. The sourdough bread was fresh baked and helped soothe hungry stomachs waiting for their entree! \n\nOne of my cousins ordered the clam chowder and drown it down quickly. She believed it was the best chowder she has ever tried, and she's from Southern California. \n\nThe waiters and hostesses were professional, polished, and extremely welcoming. They can make you feel fancy while you sport your big hat, Hawaiian print shirt, and fanny pack (my cousin's literal attire when we are here). They never once showed frustration or struggle  navigating through the small aisles of the eating area, and carried themselves very well. They were always on time, and they were extremely courteous. Even when my cousin had to ask her where the bathroom had been three times. \n\nThe view of the ocean was lovely, and also calming. The air wasn't too hot or cold. The decor was tasteful and crisp, and there's not a bad thing to say about this establishment. They are a perfect staff to visit with great dishes to try if you're new to the Bay Area! It was a star attraction on my whole trip to San Francisco.", "author": "Karen L."}

We were originally seated next to a large table with some very loud children, I mean LOUD. We joked about it to the waitress, who proceeded to mention it to the manager. He not only reseated us to a quieter area, but comped our desserts and was extremely apologetic, even though it wasn't his fault. \n\nOnce we were reseated, they switched our server. Mel did an awesome job for us. He was friendly and attentive. Our service here could not have been better. Many of the restaurants have the waiter take the order and then others do all of the work. Not here. \n\nAs far as the food, it was fantastic. We had the cioppino and the filet. Both were just delicious. The desserts that we ended up getting for free was the chocolate cake and tiramisu, and apple with walnut. They were also delicious. The cake melted in your mouth. \n\nWe eat at a lot of excellent restaurants and I would definitely put this one up with the best of them.", "author": "Lee K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-01", "description": "Very ambivalent about this place. First downside is that they don't take reservations so when we (locals) wanted to go here at 7 PM on a Saturday night, we knew we'd have to wait a while. It ended up taking about 45 minutes.\n\nPROS\n-Amazing views! We got seated in the area right on the water. The sun was setting right behind the GGB. It was great. \n-We couldn't decide which bottle of wine we wanted so the waiter let us all taste both! They have a pretty good wine selection.\n-For apps, we got the ahi tuna poke and the baked oysters. Both were delicious! The baked oysters were great in an interesting way... Spinach, bacon, and cheese, yum!\n\nCONS\n-Once we decided which wine we wanted, it took the waiter a realllllly long time to actually bring out our bottle (at least 20 minutes).\n-Our mom had been craving a salmon salad with bacon since well before dinner so when we saw a Salmon \"Club\" Salad on the menu, she was ecstatic! Unfortunately, when our food came out, they brought the wrong salad... It was lettuce lightly dressed and a piece of salmon on top. When she told the waiter that it was the wrong salad, all he did was take it back and add bacon. So disappointing.\n-I had the half garlic roasted dungeness crab. While it was very good, there was nothing with it. I was, at least, expecting some butter to dip my crab in.\n\nAgain, really ambivalent about this place because the food was pretty good but there were just a few blunders. It's also pretty expensive here.", "author": "Julia M."}

Usually bread bowls are heavy, sodden blocks of gummy goop.  Not this one!  It tasted fresh baked, still warm, crisp crackly crust.  The chowder was thick and creamy, and the $7 supplement for crab was worth it.  \n\nZero stars for everything else.  Service was ridiculous.  From having to hunt down our own silverware and napkins, to finally resorting to taking the plates off another table so we could eat.  Or server was not to be seen the entire meal.  \n\nZero stars for the junky crab cakes with nary a flake of crab inside - they tasted like pre frozen, discount pucks of subpar stuffing.  The salad on the side was inedible.  How do you mess up a few leaves of lettuce?  I've never tasted this particular variety of lettuce, so chewy yet limp. \n\nZero stars for the chilled Dungeness crab appetizer with cocktail sauce.  Actually, the cocktail sauce tasted fine, but again we had to hunt it down even though it's half the description of the dish.  The crab was dry and the shell was incredibly dirty, caked with spongy greenish brownish muck that fell off and mingles inextricably with the few dry bits of crab I was able to pick out.  \n\nThe server finally acknowledged us as she brought the bill, smiling warmly and asking if there was anything we needed.  Well, yes there was, but we took care of it ourselves already.  We still tipped 18%, the lowest amount marked on the bill, but we will not be coming back.", "author": "Alex L."}

We also had several salads with clam chowder in bread bowls, all of which were nicely turned out. I'm a jaded SF diner, but this place was really good!", "author": "Rob N."}

Ran into a bartender on his break (wish I got his name) after having a terrible experience and walking out of Eagle Cafe next door; he asked us what we were looking for, we said a bar, he warmly invited us to try Fog Harbor's and we are so glad we did. We snagged 2 seats at the bar and were quickly greeted by Tony who got us some waters and whipped us up 2 fantastic cocktails (a manhattan and a margarita). We decided to sit outside by the fireplace, so cozy! A gentleman came over and let us know that should we get too warm, let someone know and they'll adjust the fireplace accordingly. After a crappy experience at Eagle Cafe, Fog Harbor was a wonderful reminder of what great service really is about. Thanks FH team!! Will definitely be back for dinner.", "author": "Denique B."}

We arrived at around 6:30pm to the restaurant and the wait was approximately 2 hours. We were seated at about 8:30 pm last night. Our kids were so pumped up to see the fireworks at the pier so we petition for a table near a window since fireworks were to start at 9:30pm. Our waiter came to get us started with our drinks and then came back to leave them and take our order. We asked a few questions which he was unable to answer. During our dinner he never came by to refill our drinks. Our kids were so excited about the dessert because they saw their Platter with the dessert plates being offerred to other tables. Our waiter never came by with it. Food was okay. My son ordered the chicken tenders with french fries. He is not a fan of french fries but he ate them and only ate one of the chicken tenders. He said they were not good. My daughter had the grilled cheese with french fries and she only took a bite of the grilled cheese and left it there too. We had the cesar salad with the clam chowder soup. It was okay. For our main dish we had the shellfish platter for two. It was not good. Our waiter dissapeared for a long time we wanted to beat the crowd. He finally showed up and we asked for the check I also ordered a chocolate chip cookie with ice cream to go. The restaurant was beautiful with a nice view of the fireworks but service and food was not good. My husband asked how much I wanted to leave him for tip. I said nothing, I did not like my waiters service. We had better service and food at the in n out a few blocks down. Waiter came to leave our dessert we grabbed our belongings and we walked out the restaurant. He came out the restaurant chasing us that we did not leave him a tip. I felt embarrased, people probably thought we had not payed our bill. My husband felt bad and gave him five dollars. I was upset. When you have good food and good service we do not hesitate to tip our waiter or waitress but this was just rediculous. To top it off I had a bite of the chocolate chip cookie dessert not knowing it had walnuts on it. Im allergic to them, but since the menu did not include desserts I did not know the ingredients. Im just glad my allergies did not go crazy or ended up in the hospital because of this.", "author": "Tania C."}

Once seated, we were lucky enough to have a nice beautiful view of Alcatraz with the window open about 20 degrees, almost too perfect.

Annoying yes, but it was beyond our and restaurants control.  \n\nI actually went away from seafood (weird, right?) and ordered a flat iron steak, my girlfriend ordered fish n chips and her sister ordered clam chowder in a bread bowl.  The steak was amazing! For a seafood place, this was so good.  I ordered medium rare and it came out just like that. Great flavor too with the peppercorn sauce.  My girlfriends fish n chips were good, same with her sister's chowder.  \n\nService was okay.  They seemed really swamped with the amount of people that were in there.

I've been in the mood for creme brulee so I get it. Surprise surprise! Each tiny little dessert is $14! I end up paying over $100 for a C- night (the service was great and the view is good).

Pretty good deal in my opinion. The food is yummy and portion sizes here are HUGE. Definitely more than a normal person should be eating in a single meal.\n\nThe restaurant is on the second level of Fisherman's Wharf and has a decent view of the pier. I was expecting a very touristy atmosphere given the location, but it was surprisingly nice. Casual, nothing fancy.\n\nOur waitress was super friendly and attentive. We were given some complimentary warm bread and butter, and the restaurant manager started off our meal with a small amuse-bouche since we decided to go with the Restaurant Week menu. Food came out quickly and the manager even brought us our check himself, along with a biscoff cookie for each of us to take home. The bill had a coupon for the Biscoff shop at the pier as well.\n\n==============================\n\n*** APPETIZERS ***\n\n-1/2 GARLIC ROASTED DUNGENESS CRAB (normally $19) - 5/5\n[Roasted with garlic herb butter, served with corn on the cob and fingerling potatoes]\nPretty sizable portion of crab and could probably make for a small entree. The crab meat was super soft and delicious with the herb butter! The crab itself was pretty easy to break open and eat, but definitely still very messy (they even give you a bib anticipating the mess)\n\n-AHI TUNA POKE (normally $16) - 5/5\n[Marinated raw tuna, avocado, mango, sesame-soy sauce and wasabi aioli]\nPretty light and fresh with a nice sweetness from the mango.\n\n\n*** ENTREES ***\n\n-GRILLED SWORDFISH (normally $26) - 3/5\n[Served over ratatouille and roasted fingerling potatoes, with pesto aioli and chimichurri sauce]\nJust alright, not particularly memorable. I like really soft, flaky fish and the swordfish was a little overcooked for my taste.\n\n-SEAFOOD CIOPPINO (normally $30) - 5/5\n[Crab, fresh fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels stewed in a tomato herb broth with pasta]\nHUGE portion! This could definitely feed two people, but I managed to eat pretty much the whole thing by myself because it was just THAT good. I really liked the crab and scallops in the dish - great soft texture. The shrimp was a little chewy and the fish was a little overcooked but still good. The broth was AMAZING. If you're not afraid of carbs, I'd recommend dipping the complimentary bread in it.\n\n\n*** DESSERT ***\n\n-VANILLA BEAN CREME BRULEE (normally $8.50) - 4/5\n[With caramelized top and Biscoff cookie]\nSuper smooth and creamy with a thin caramelized top. Not too sweet, but definitely pretty rich. It's made in a larger shallow dish so there's more of that crunchy caramelized sugar, which I personally like more than the actual custard.\n\n-PUMPKIN BREAD PUDDING (normally $8.50) - 4.5/5\n[Topped with creme anglaise]\nSOOO GOOD!! I was already incredibly full from the seafood cioppino and wasn't planning on actually eating so much dessert, but ended up having zero self-control with this bread pudding. Warm, gooey and flavorful. And probably had an entire tub of butter in it :( In fact, it looked like it was sitting in a pool of melted butter, which scared me a little.

As a born-and-raised NorCal kiddo and lover of all things seafood (shoutout to pescatarians), I gotta hand it to the crew at Fog Harbor. Y'all were ON YOUR GAME that night! I'll be recommending this place to anyone looking for the quintessential San Francisco meal with a romantic, classy, and worthwhile dining experience. \n\nThe service from start to finish was undeniably amazing. We reserved for an early dinner around 4PM, but couldn't make it (coming from South Bay) until 7:30PM for many reasons. But even though we were told that we would have to wait about 10 minutes, before we knew it we were seated after only 3 minutes! We were seated at a booth on the lower level a distance from the panoramic windows, but we loved having the grand space for our dining experience. Our server was very understanding, cracked a few jokes here and there, and was just the right amount of \"leave us alone/serve us.\" I gotta give props to the manager of the night who personally went around to all of the tables to offer an amuse-bouche...we thought it was because of SFRW, but he literally went around to all of the tables! \n\nThe food!! MAN!! That deserves its own rating. The four of us ordered all of the starters, entrees, and desserts (since there were only 3 selections, we double'd on the chocolate cake...best decision ever). FOODGASMS to the max, y'all. Even though our server said their Seafood Cioppino was the most famous dish, I think the best ones were the baked oysters (gone too soon, sadface), salmon dish and indeed the cioppino. I recommend going with the Anchor Steam to complement your entire meal! By the time desserts rolled around we were all delightfully satisfied, but loosened our belts for the BEST melt-in-your-mouth-chocolate cake and surprisingly yummy bread pudding! \n\nFog Harbor is not a joke.

To be honest the food was just all right (the shrimp cocktail was pretty good though) but it was nothing really amazing. The service was definitely attentive which is why I left 4 stars despite the food being all right. We left very happy that we started our trip on a good note. \n\nI would probably go back just to see the view again and to try other things on the menu.", "author": "Gaita H."}

Having dined at the Waterbar the night before with great scenic views, the food at Fog Harbor was hands down the better choice.  We found it via Yelp and thought the crab roll would be the option to choose.  Well, after the Crab Ceviche for an appetizer and a spicy shrimp boil for the main, as well as a seafood Alfredo... we were hooked (pun intended).  The Alfredo was packed with seafood. Literally more seafood than noodles.  Great flavors and wonderful crab, shrimp and scallops.  The spicy seafood boil was amazing.  Lobster, crab, shrimp and scallops.  Nice heat level and a broth you just had to sop up with the delicious sourdough rolls.  It all was wrapped up with a bow with an amazing waiter in Curtis. Very honest and open about what was good, great and average on the menu.  Steered us in the right direction and a great, helpful personality.", "author": "Drew F."}

My boyfriend suggested we stop here for an early dinner, as he had visited before with out-of-town family. I was a bit dubious, thinking that it wouldn't be that great and just another tourist trap on Pier 39. I was 100% wrong and I can absolutely recommend this spot if you want to splurge a bit and play tourist in your own city. Splurge is even a stretch because prices for what you get were very reasonable, but more on that in a bit.\n\nTo begin with, the outdoor patio/waiting area was festively decorated for the holidays and featured a cozy fireplace, some decorative fountains and comfy seating. Fortunately for a table for 2 at 4:30 we only had to wait a few minutes. Nearly all tables will feature a fabulous bay view and from our table we could see a bit of Alcatraz, the Marin headlands and the Golden Gate. The interior is classy and sleek but still cozy on the chilly pier-visitors from outside the area will be impressed. \n\nAnthony, our server was wonderful and brought us some freshly made, warm sourdough bread. Trust me, it's absolutely worth the calories-it's made on the premises and the best restaurant bread I've ever had. For my meal I opted for the roasted tomato penne. Normally this comes with chicken but they left that off, since I'm a vegetarian. They added broccoli, spinach and the dish came with fresh mozzarella. Portions were impressive and I came home with leftovers. My boyfriend got the seared ahi with garlic mashed potatoes and his portion was also very generous for the price. We thoroughly enjoyed the meal, the service and the ambiance. This is not at all what I expected from a seafood restaurant on Pier 39 and will definitely come back when we feel like treating ourselves. Definitely give it a try if you're looking for a restaurant with view that doesn't charge outrageous prices. Completely a win.", "author": "Jennifer N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-24", "description": "Chilling winds mixed with brisk temps had us searching for warmth, shelter and clam chowder.. I mean, we're in San Francisco, am I right?!\n\nWe ended up at Pier 39 / Fisherman's Wharf not long after our gruelingly mediocre Bartlett Hall experience. We didn't have much in our stomachs by high noon, which meant the immediate need to fill them with grub hit us in full force. \n\nFog Harbor Fish House appeared to be THE SPOT.. mainly because we were right below it.. and our desperate attempts to eat were dwindling down to a either: wait patiently for a hearty meal or begrudgingly snack on munchies along the bay. We laughed at the snack idea and proceeded to head upstairs towards Fog Harbor. The hostess upfront / outside took our names, then informed us it'd be around a 25 minute wait. Within seconds after our groups arrival, the line became that of a Black Friday sale at Best Buy. We were lucky enough to snag a spot in the little patio section by the front bar, fireplace by our sides, and amusingly watched fellow tourists shiver in those chilly northern California temperatures. \n\nAside from the crowd outside, the folks inside seemed mild mannered and less talkative than I'd imagine a spot like Fog Harbor would be. We were sat at nice corner table with easily one of the best views in the house that was accompanied by a pleasant server. And though I couldn't verify this, because our spot was visually stunning.. it seemed most seats within the restaurant gave a decent glimpse of the surrounding Bay and Pier 39. The decor itself was almost on the classy-scale but in far too touristy of a spot to be labeled this. \n\nIt looked like every single table had at least ONE bowl of clam chowder sitting atop them, and because it was on our minds prior to our arrival, it was a dish we'd all be ordering without even looking at the menu. Strategy in mind, we ordered regular bowls of Clam Chowder WITHOUT bread as the bowl.. because, you know, most restaurants provide COMPLIMENTARY BREAD.. so all that excess yeast is simply unnecessary, folks. Unless.. bread is yo' thing. Then do whatcha wanna do, baby. \n\nAlong with the clam chowder (and free bread) I ordered the Mixed Grill Plate - Grilled salmon, swordfish & shrimp covered in a (buttery) citrus buerre blanc served with sides of sauteed vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nThe mixed grill plate was phenomenal. I'm a fan of blackened fish, the taste of the grill and proper seasoning.. and everything on the plate was that exactly. Moist yet partially charred swordfish & succulent salmon had my taste buds tingling and the healthy sized shrimp smothered in butter turned my face into a pure gold. Garlic potatoes were creamy and on poooint. I was shining vividly, and it was obvious to everyone in our presence that I was thoroughly enjoying this section of my meal. (My grunts, smiles, giggles, muffled speech, or if I look drunk without drinking, etc.)\n\nThe clam chowder was, for lack of better terms, doo-doo. Just about every bite had sand in it. Strange.. it appeared there wasn't much clam in my bowl.. which made the sand ordeal a somewhat mind-boggling. Because of this, I didn't enjoy nor finish their 'Award Winning' Clam Chowder. I would've dipped my head into the Pacific if I wanted to taste as much sand as that.\n\nA thin line between a 3 and a 4, Fog Harbor Fish House (through my eyes) may not have the best clam chowder as claimed.. but was boosted in a positive direction due to solid / attentive service, views truly pleasing to the eyes and all of our food (aside from chowder) was tasty and fulfilling for our once empty stomachs.", "author": "Ryan B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-09-04", "description": "Visited Fog Harbor this past weekend to celebrate a friends birthday and our experience was just okay to say the least. We started with the 1/2 dozen baked oysters, along with the blue cheese wedge salad and a cup of clam chowder. Salad was very good and portion was more than enough, along with the chowder which had a great taste and was served piping hot. However, as for the oysters, they were very tasty and seasoned very well, but they were lukewarm and almost miniature sized. For 18$, I can get a dozen and 1/2 oysters at the grocery store, and twice the size of those in which they were serving. So that was a bit disappointing, especially at a restaurant right on the wharf. \n Our server, I'm not sure of his name, was nice at the beginning and then he virtually disappeared after we received our entrees. I ordered the mixed grill with salmon, shrimp, and swordfish which was good. However, the swordfish was a bit dry, my salmon portion looked like it was supposed to be on a kid's plate, & my shrimp were a little small as well, considering this is a fish house. My friends ordered the swordfish and fried fish combo, which they said was satisfying but nothing to rave about... \n\nFinally, remember I mentioned we were there celebrating a friends birthday. When we first arrived, we notified the server of this not once but TWICE, and he said she would receive a complimentary dessert at the end of our meal. Well at the end of our meal, the dessert never came and neither did he. We sat for almost 30 min after we finished our meals, only to flag our server down who walked by us numerous times, not once asking how anything was. Which sucked because, I work in the food industry myself and love to tip my server more than 20% when receiving great service, but our experience unfortunately lacked the luxury of just that. \n\nPros: Setting, ambiance, and beautiful view of the wharf which is great for tourists who've never visited SF. Also, great cocktails...hibiscus margarita and the lipstick martini were sooo good. \n\nCons: Overpriced, average seafood, and mediocre portions. And the service matched my food....dry and almost non-existent. \n \n-I may return only on the condition we get that complimentary dessert which was promised.", "author": "Whitney C."}

I usually won't eat cream sauce, but this one is great, not to creamy but flavorful enough to make the seafood great! Love the fish inside. Clams are so fresh in the seafood penne as well. Penne are well cooked, not too soft or hard. Tried my friends salmon and clam chowder. Clam chowder tastes creamy, despite a heavy flavor of corn starch but i somehow enjoy the corn starch taste, remind me of childhood. Sourdough is cool as well! Try the bread before meal, if you like it, then clam chowder in a bread bowl is a safe choice, if you think it's too sour, then you might need to consider not having the soup in a bread bowl, because it is the same type of bread. Also tried the salmon, salmon is a little bit too salty for me, but still taste fresh and tender. Definitely worth going when you are at pier 39. Love the garlic shrimp as the starter!

The ratings below will NOT change.\n\nSERVICE: 95/100\n\nWe made a reservation at 8pm. Our server, Mila, got us seated early at a table with a decent view of the Bay and Alcatraz. We were immediately seated, but drinks were not brought out within 10 minutes. Once drinks were served, we were given another 5 minutes or so to look at the menu and order what we want. Mila was super patient with us and just an outstanding server! Thank you!\n\nFOOD: 95/100\n\nWe ordered quite a bit, actually, so let me break this down. \n\nThe starters were:\nClam Chowder in a Bread Bowl, \nCalamari, \nTuna Thai Salad, \nAhi Tuna Poke, and\nCrab Cakes\n\nThe Clam Chowder was just delicious! A nice, thick soup that didn't water up the bread, but still got absorbed by the (fresh) sourdough bowl and packed nice flavors in a very aesthetically pleasing manner. \n\nThe Calamari, although not as aesthetically pleasing in terms of how they plated it...splendid! Crunchy outside, tender squid on the inside. The lemon and aioli complemented the dish well. \n\nThe Tuna Thai Salad was...above average. Yes, fresh. Yes, flavorful. Yes, presentable. But...it's a salad after all. It's nothing to be excited about. The tuna just added to the dish. \n\nThe Crab Cakes...oh my God! How do you start this? Crispy on the outside, yet soft and flavorful on the inside with LOTS (and I mean LOTS) of REAL crab! This is an appetizer I definitely recommend!\n\nThe Ahi Tuna Poke was very aesthetically pleasing and flavors were just on point with this one! Fresh tuna and avocado with a Wasabi aioli all add up to create a party in your mouth! I would ALSO recommend this app!\n\nThe main courses I tried are as followed:\nSurf and Turf, and\nAhi Tuna\n\nThe Surf and Turf was some of the best lobster-and-steak I have ever had! A beautifully cooked medium 10 ounce New York Strip and a lobster tail so large and delicious, you'd think it's more a mermaid fin than a lobster tail!\n\nThe Ahi Tuna had a light sear on the outside, keeping the inside rare. The sesame seeds added some needed 'CRUNCH' to the tuna, which was already flavorful! Sear was excellent, and the Wasabi aioli just complements the dish even further. Aesthetically, the dish was BEAUTIFULLY presented! Overall a well-executed dish! \n\nDessert gave us a whole lot of options to choose from.\n\nIn this instance, my sister decided to choose the\nTiramisu. Wow. Just wow. Words escape me at how perfectly executed the tiramisu was! \n\nNice, large, and square; it was large enough to feed our party of 5! The flavors inside were a nice bitterness of, what I assume, is coffee and a sweetness from the whipped cream on the side and the filling inside. Very moist and flavorful, so, overall, it's a great dessert that EVERYONE should try at least once in their lifetime!\n\nVALUE: 90/100\n\nThis is not your typical workday lunch break restaurant. Is there a better way to put this into words? Hell, I doubt it.\n\nOVERALL SCORE: 93/100\n\n-----------------------------\n\nTL;DR - A lovely restaurant with excellent food, service, atmosphere, and views on Pier 39! A bit pricey, but you honestly can't beat fresh seafood straight from Fisherman's Wharf!", "author": "Elbert N."}

It was good quality fish - given the fact that the restaurant is right on the pier. The biggest problem was how it tasted. It was extremely under seasoned. We had the clams, ahi tuna, shrimp, salmon and swordfish. All of which I've had far better tasting versions even in joints like red lobster.

We started off with some clam chowder, blue cheese garlic bread, and calamari all of which were excellent. Our mains consisted of lobster, steak, and grilled/fried shrimp. Everyone in my party who ordered the seafood dishes was very happy with their choice. I, on the other hand, didn't find the steak to be too tasteful which is why I docked a star off my review. I realize that this is a seafood place but a little flavor on the steak (even only salt and pepper) would have been appreciated!\n\nThis being said however, I would definitely recommend this restaurant!

We split the crab cake four ways (because there were four of us). Mines was good. While halfway through, one of the girls found a short, black curly hair mixed in with her crab cake. We caught the attention of a server and told him, he said he will get his manager. \n\nThe manager came:\nWe told him what happened, showed him the hair. He said nothing to us, did not apologize, then asked \"do you want another one\" .

One of your workers fucked up and dropped hair into our food. Why the hell are you acting like you couldn't be bothered with us and give us your shit attitude? We declined another crab cake. The shit manager grabs the plate of the girl with the hair crab cake and the main plate and walks away with nothing else to say. No apologies or anything. \n\nWhat came out next:\nGarlic crab and fried combo. \nThe whole crab meat was mushy, kind of like the crab was already dead when they cooked it. The crab was also cold, so maybe that crab was ready to serve the moment we ordered. The crab was on a bed of potatoes with broccoli on the side. The fried combo came with 1 fish, 2 shrimps on a bed of calamari with Cole slaw and fries on the side. It was just alright. The fries tasted better than everything else on that plate.\n\nOur linguini clam never came out. Server must've forgotten about it. \n\nTowards the end, we felt really dissatisfied with our meal, so another girl and I decided to try their clam chowder. We ordered the clam chowder on the bread bowl.\n\nIt came out right away. With the remaining crab meat we had from the whole crab, we put the meat into the clam chowder and ate it that way.

Personally I think this is the best clam chowder I have ever tasted in SF, and I have had a LOT of clam chowder in SF. \n\nI also ordered the linguine with clams ($18) which has garlic, olive oil, and tomatoes. This might actually become a regular item for me, if I didn't want to try everything else on the menu at some point. It's fresh, creamy, and very filling. \n\nEven their bread comes straight from the oven, hot on our table. Their selection of cocktails is worth taking a look at as well. I'm just in love with every aspect of Fog Harbor. Make sure to call and reserve a table ahead of time to avoid a long wait!", "author": "Stefanie C."}

The fog harbor burger, clam chowder in a bread bowl and crab rolls were the favorites. I am from Cape Cod so I'm very discerning when it comes to seafood and it was definitely fresh here. The service was exceptional too. Very friendly and attentive staff. We were on vacation so I had an envelope with $200 cash in it that I accidentally forgot on the table and one of the wait staff chased us down to return it. He could've kept it and I never would've known so I feel like that's a testament to the quality of people they employ.

Fog Harbor doesn't hold back on the cheese either, as each bite was an explosion of flavor.  For my main dish, I had the Cioppino, a bowl of tomato sauce filled with a variety of seafood from fish to crab to mussels.  One thing I appreciate was the option to order the Cioppino \"lazy style\" meaning all the shell fish was de-shelled before serving.

Awesome crunchy batter with that flavor you get from only the finest fresh swordfish.  The texture was dense as I expected yet came apart nicely in my mouth.

My husband ordered the salmon, which was a special that night, and he couldn't save it like he claimed. For dessert we went with creme brulee which for us was a delight in itself. Perfectly coated on top.\n\nOne big con is the dress code that I wish we would have considered going. I definitely felt out of place.\n\nRecommended? Absolutely no doubt. Enjoy the food and the not seemingly crowded restaurant.", "author": "Amy F."}

I couldn't give a 5 star, because our original server didn't have the best customer service. However, for some reason, a new server Morgan took over and our time here became almost perfect. She was very kind and always had a small on, and had great customer service for a high quality restaurant. She checked up on us as much as she can, and really changed our time there. I highly recommend asking for her if you want great customer service.\n\nAs for the food, the seafood was high quality and everything was absolutely delicious. We had the crab and avocado salad, clam chowder, and the crab ceviche to start off. All of the flavors were upto par and super fresh. I recommend trying their whole crab, their mixed grill, and their shellfish platter for a variety. You can order for 1-2 servings with the shellfish platter. All of the seafood was very fresh and seasoned well. \n\nOverall, I will definitely be returning for their quality seafood and the customer service we received in the end. One tip: make reservations for the view because the view really makes it much more special. Thank you Morgan for a wonderful Christmas Eve dinner with my family!", "author": "Christina L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-07", "description": "After walking around Pier 39 for a few hours, my husband and I were hungry for lunch. We stopped at Fog Harbor since our Aquarium of the Bay ticket allowed us to get 15% off the bill. Additionally, since it was on the second level, the view of the bay was fantastic. The inside was very nicely decorated and had plenty of seating. \n\nWe were seated right away and our waitress was quick to greet us and answer any of our questions. We had a tough time deciding what we wanted to eat, but our waitress had some good advice and offered her favorite dishes. For drinks, we both ordered the Alcatraz Escape. This drink was super tasty and my husband is still raving about how delicious it was. The drink was very tropical with orange and pineapple juices with grenadine, coconut rum, and a float of dark rum. I would definitely order it again. \n\nFor lunch, my husband ordered the whole dungeness crab with garlic. This thing was huge! It was really tasty, but honestly, it was a mess. I watched my husband crack open the entire thing and this literally consumed all of his time. By the time he was done cracking, I was almost done eating my meal of seafood cioppino. This came with crab, fish, scallops, clams and mussels in a tomato herb broth. It was delicious and hit the spot. I eyed the dessert tray, which looked delicious, but we were both stuffed from our meal. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this place for a seafood fix. It was a little on the pricey side, but I felt it was justified with how delicious everything was, the great service, and the great view. Next time we visit Pier 39, I would definitely come back here and try the other items on the menu.", "author": "Nicole B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-11", "description": "While planning my trip to San Francisco, I really wanted to go to a seafood restaurant and I'm so glad I found Fog Harbor! This place was so great! We came around 3pm on a Sunday afternoon and there was still a 25-30 minute wait for a table for two. \n\nAMBIANCE: \n- We were seated right next to the window and it was such a lovely view of the water and the sea lions on the pier! \n- The sun was coming in (3pm) and it was kind of hot but the waitresses were very helpful and proactive in asking whether we wanted the sun shade put down over the window. \n- The restaurant was filled with people but it wasn't too loud. \n\nFOOD:\n- Clam Chowder: So delicious!! It was perfectly hot and it really is so comforting eating this after being outside in the cold windy weather. There are generous chunks of clam and the clam meat is really tender and delicious. I didn't really taste the bacon bits, which was fine because the clam taste was fantastic. It paired really well with the warm sourdough bread and butter they provide you. \n- Roasted Garlic Dungeness Crab: I opted for the roasted garlic rather than the regular Dungeness crab and I was not disappointed! The crab really held the roasted garlic and butter flavor making each bite that much better. There is so much extra garlic and butter that you can dip pieces of crab meat in it for more flavor! The crab came with sides of steamed broccoli and roasted fingerling potatoes potatoes that also had the roasted garlic and butter flavor. The crab was fresh and the vegetables were so delicious. If you enjoy garlic as much as I do, I highly recommend you choose the roasted garlic crab over the regular one! \n- Surf & Turf: This entree had the Maine lobster tail and steak. The lobster tail was super fresh and the meat was just so delicious! I wasn't expecting the steak to taste that good but it was fantastic as well; it was tender and juicy. \n\nSERVICE:\n- The service here is really wonderful. When we first arrived, we had one waitress who was covering for our actual waitress until she finished her break and both waitresses were super friendly and welcoming. They were constantly refilling our water and asking if we needed anything further. \n\nOverall, I am sooo happy with my decision to eat at Fog Harbor over other seafood restaurants around the area. Everything from the service to the food was outstanding! Highly recommend this restaurant to everyone in the area :)", "author": "Tiffany L."}

The ambiance was great, dimly lit room, large windows overseeing the harbor and boat. The servers were very nice, but could have been a bit more attentive. Seems like they could have a few more servers for the amount of tables in the restaurant. \n\nNow lets get to the good part! I'd give the food overall a 4 out of 5. The clam chowder is supposidly world famous so I gave it a whirl. It was definitely great, but nothing amazing. Wish it had more flavor to it in general. The mussel fries I would not order again. They provided mussels that were the most plump and large mussels I have ever had. I fantasized whether they were given growth hormones because they were so large HAHA. It seemed like a gourmet dish over freshly baked french fries. I was not a big fan of the mussel and french fries combo. It was a good appetizer, but personally I just did not like the combo. I ordered the surf and turf which is a lobster tail and 10 oz NY steak. I'd definitely say this is a great deal if you want both the lobster tail and steak ($15 difference if ordering the 2 items separately). It's hard to go wrong with the lobster tail, but they removed all the meat from the lobster perfectly, leaving nothing behind in the shell. The NY steak was cooked as asked (medium rare) topped with capers. The broccoli side was rather bland, but the mashed potatoes where great. \n\nThe sparkling ginger lemonade was tasty, had actual slices of ginger infused, but was way too sweet for me. \n\nWould I come here again? YES definitely!", "author": "Andrew S."}

As already noted, this is a typical touristy restaurant but I'll highlight a few of the positives:\n\n-Fresh and free sourdough. With that being said, skip the bread bowl with your chowder and use the free bread.\n-Good views of the water from almost any table. The whole place has wide windows that ket in natural light.\n-The table cloths have paper on them, I have no shame and asked for crayons. Who doesn't love doodling before dinner?\n-Friendly staff\n\nOverall I have had better chowder and the $16 ceviche was pretty average. Oh and it came with literally five tortilla chips on the plate. Five...not to be negative but I was not sure if that was the restaurant being fancy or cheap.", "author": "Miriam M."}

As we were exploring Fisherman's Wharf and its various Piers, we decided to grab dinner in the area. Fog Harbor had a ton of rave reviews, so it made for an easy decision. I would definitely recommend reservations in advance if you have a larger group but we were fortunate enough to be able to walk-in for a table for 4 on Friday night around 7 PM. \n\nThe ambience of the restaurant is so beautiful. Gorgeous bay views and we got there just in time for sunset. The natural light is absolutely amazing. We were seated at a booth directly facing the windows. \n\nThe service alone at this restaurant deserves 5 stars. Our waitress was friendly and very attentive - we spent around 2 hours at the restaurant and she never once let our table fall to the back of her mind. She even complimented the fact that we were having lively conversations the entire night, apologizing whenever she \"interrupted\" because she usually just sees people on their phones. Her attitude was awesome and refreshing. \n\nFood... incredible. Of course our table ordered seafood entrees. I went for the swordfish and was blown away by the huge portion size. The fish was perfectly cooked and paired with a mouth-watering aioli sauce. I also loved the ratatouille that is served with the dish. Even though I was stuffed halfway through, I forced myself to finish because it was so delicious. The shrimp skewers (\"brochettes\") that others ordered also looked delicious. \n\nDon't skimp out on dessert either - they bring around a tray to you and I challenge you to say no when all of that is right in front of your face. Everything looked amazing but we ended up picking two to split between us: the strawberry shortcake and one of the specials: a chocolate fudge cake paired with a mini creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The shortcake was so light and airy, and the fruit tasted fresh. The duo was also great - definitely rich and sweet but not overpowering. \n\nThis was one of those rare dining experiences that was honestly perfect in every way and one I will remember fondly. Great prices, great menu, great food, great service, great ambience. What more could you ask for?", "author": "Margaret Z."}

What the No1DP asks he gets, I just happen to be the lucky woman to tag along. I had another restaurant in mind that was a little less touristy but after some research and consideration we ended up eating here instead.\n\nVENUE: We went on a Sunday night, just as the sun was about to set. The host put us in a table right next to the window. The No1DP and I were able to watch the people walking around Pier 39 and people just getting off the ferries. While the No1DP and I weren't able to secure a window that overlooked Fisherman's Wharf we weren't too far from those windows and we could look at the massive amount of tourists walking the wharf. \n\nSERVICE: Service was excellent, as expected from a fine seafood establishment. \n\nWINE: Both of us had white wines. Although I don't remember specifics on the grape varietal, I remember my wine was a little sweet and went well with my dish.\n\nFOOD\nThe Yelp check-in gets you blue cheese garlic bread. The blue cheese was a bit strong, but it's good for anyone that really likes blue cheese.\n\nWe got bowls of their famous clam chowder. One of the better clam chowders I've tasted, and the No1DP agrees. It may look watery when you're served the bowl but don't let that fool you. Instead we were treated to a quite creamy (and not starchy!) soup with good amounts of CLAM. They were quite generous with the clam but they better be considering how much you pay for a bowl!\n\nNo1DP got one of their special dishes lobster mac and cheese. As a New Englander, he has a right to be picky about his seafood, especially his lobster. His dish was \"quite comparable to an equivalent dish I'd be served back home\". Lucky him. I tried it and it's quite the rich dish - the cheese is RICH and one big bite can make you significantly fuller than before... No1DP ate less than half of his dish. The lobster was to his liking.\n\nI got another special dish: 0.5 lbs lobster stuffed with dungeness crab. I thought this would be an excellent dish as this would combine two of my great seafood loves - lobster and dungeness crab. When I was served this dish the tail part was the lobster while the head was stuffed with the crab. The crab was quite sweet, I'm not sure if this is supposed to be how the crab naturally tastes, but the sweetness took away from the crab. Lobster was excellent, soft and buttery yet I could taste the lobster. Spinach and mashed potatoes were good sides yet were not too rich to overpower the seafood. \n\nDessert consisted of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. The sugar was hard enough that I can crack it open with one swift tap of the spoon. Custard was creamy yet not too rich. The speculoos cookie they put on top was a nice touch and gave the dessert a subtle ginger taste if you eat it. \n\nThough Fog Harbor can be considered a touristy restaurant to some, the food was still excellent. Thanks to the No1DP for another excellent eating adventure!", "author": "Isabella B."}

Our son had a house salad and grilled salmon. I had the NY steak and a glass of the house pinot noir.  My wife had a bowl of clam chowder and fish and chips.

I would definitely recommend making a reservation through OpenTable because it was packed on a Saturday evening.\n\nOur table was started off with complimentary sourdough bread and butter, which is always appreciated.\n\nFor the appetizer, I opted for the AHI TUNA POKE, which is marinated raw tuna, avocado, mango, and a sesame-soy sauce and wasabi aioli (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Y5MO3qA68Z4v6MvKgGl9ZQ). It's normally $16 for their full serving, though we only got a poke pile rather than the poke slices shown in other pictures. The tuna is decently fresh, the mango is refreshing (though not very ripe), the avocado is smooth (also not very ripe), and the aioli ties it all together.\n\nMy friend chose the BAKED OYSTERS as her appetizer, which came with 4 fresh shucked oysters topped with spinach, bacon and a creamy parmesan sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ). Each oyster is normally $2.50, and she enjoyed the rich flavor of each one.\n\nFor entrees, one friend decided on the SEAFOOD CIOPPINO, which is crab, fresh fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels stewed in a tomato herb broth served with pasta (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#2AAhYWe5iBS33VciM-7V5g). It's a hefty portion normally priced at $30! She said that her favorite part of the dish was the crab. Her boyfriend ordered the CREEKSTONE NY STEAK, a 10 oz steak grilled and topped with whisky peppercorn sauce, served with garlic mashed potatoes and saut\u00e9ed vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#3MgOxfwSYmu_cBpmwqcQnQ). It was also a generous portion, normally priced at $27.\n \nI chose the GRILLED SALMON, a fillet served on a bed of roasted corn, arugula, red peppers, fingerling potatoes, and tarragon with a citrus beurre blanc (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#Of8IrIHQdLcfmBdpixj99A). Normally $28, the salmon dish is worth it. I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised by how juicy and moist the salmon meat was, especially given how often I've been underwhelmed by salmon dishes. But, goshdangit, Fog Harbor did it right. *snaps*\n\nAs our desserts, we each ordered something different:\n\nThe VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE, a smooth, creamy custard with caramelized sugar top and a Biscoff cookie, normally $8.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#n77J_bT5cjGss76X1FdSPw). My favorite, hands down. I tend to avoid cr\u00e8me brulees because past ones I've tried have had sugar tops that were way too thick and overpoweringly sweet and sticky. But the sugar coating is delicate, allowing the custard to really shine through. If you're a fan of egg custard, especially subtly sweet custard, you'll be a fan of their cr\u00e8me brulee.\n \nThe MOLTEN CHOCOLATE CAKE with a rich creamy chocolate center, served warm with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream, normally $8.50 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#W-e5gxE978hMPMfp1k7nDA). Many reviewers have complained that this isn't a true molten cake because the inside doesn't ooze melted chocolate, and I would have to agree--it's just a warm, gooey chocolate center. The vanilla bean ice cream is tasty, and I liked that the chocolate cake wasn't overly rich since it paired well with light, fluffy whipped cream.\n \nThe CHOCOLATE BANANA BREAD PUDDING, a huge square of Fresh Boudin's sourdough bread baked with chocolate pudding, served warm with cr\u00e8me anglaise and vanilla ice cream (most similar to the pumpkin bread pudding, normally $8.50) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=dgr5LlguS0E84w2KQoXqYQ#dYa4c4vsHCPEF7PxSyRxjQ). I asked for the cr\u00e8me on the side because I didn't want it to soak the bread (not a huge fan of soggy bread). The cr\u00e8me itself is very light and was fun to dip, and the banana and sourdough undertones make for an intriguing combination. However, the chocolate is so rich that it overwhelmed even my sweet tooth...ridic.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend the GRILLED SALMON entree and the VANILLA BEAN CR\u00c8ME BRULEE dessert. Don't forget the 15% coupon!", "author": "Adele F."}

I am not sure if she was having a bad day or what but working with the public she needs to work on her people skills. \n\nWe put in our food orders and beer. After we got our beers we were delivered fresh warm sourdough bread. The bread was what dreams are made out of. I knew this place had promise.\n\nOur food came out in a decent amount of time. Meaning I still had one slice of bread let to enjoy with my meal. The greedy monster didn't completely come out. I ordered the salmon club salad and it was good. I was surprised not to be asked how I wanted my salmon cooked as I normally order it rare. It was tasty but not worth the cost.\n\nMy husband ordered the fried combo that included fried fish, calamari and shrimp. I had a taste of the fish and calamari which was decent. However my husband wouldn't part with the shrimp because they only gave him two. Wtf??? The two sides were the traditional fries and coleslaw. \n\nOverall the food was decent but seemed overprice.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-10-31", "description": "I really, really wanted to love this place, for a few reasons, but mostly because I'm visiting San Francisco and had a focus on cuisine while visiting.  I wish I could be more polite, but the truth is that I am disappointed that I wasted an evening here.  Across the dock from Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., we instantly noticed the mistake we had made by coming to this tourist trap area.  Face-palm #1.  \n\nOur server was not unfriendly at all, but I felt rushed from the moment we were seated.  We made a semi-late reservation for a Monday night (Halloween!) and we had hoped that would give us a bit more leisurely pace for our meal.  I like those European style meals that take a couple hours, a few drinks, and heavy sighs of satisfaction at the end.  What we received was more like a calculated and rushed meal you'd expect at a mid-grade chain restaurant.  \n\nWe started with oysters and never received any utensils to dress them with, so we poured the condiments on with reluctance.  Next came salads, which didn't dazzle us, but neither were they intolerable.  I ordered the \"fall special\" of Pumpkin Curry Salmon, face-palm #2. My partner requested the \"Jumbo\" Scallops for his entree. My pumpkin curry salmon tasted more like salmon soaked in PSL at Sbux than curry, but I probably shouldn't have ordered this dish as I don't care much for pumpkin spice, and am rather fond of curry.  Not very impressed at this point, as nothing I've eaten was blowing me away and the service made me feel like a nuisance instead of a treasured patron.  My partner's meal?  Delicious.  BUT!  and this is a major one, the scallops were nothing close to \"jumbo\".  They were quite small, although tasty.  The photo illustrates the size of the scallops in comparison to a dinner fork.  I would probably have a different attitude if the scallops were touted as sustainable and local instead of being labeled jumbo.  \n\nI might have a more sunny outlook on this spot if I could have seen the view it's known for, but we had already lost the sunlight for the day and could only see the nighttime lights.  I wish I had tried the chowder they're known for, and maybe I would have been more impressed.", "author": "Taylor G."}

After reading numerous reviews on Yelp, we decided to try this restaurant. Let me tell you -- it did not disappoint. Really beautiful place. The view is to die for! We ordered the clam chowder, baked oysters, linguini and clams. Everything was delicious! I have never had such decadent clam chowder in my life. It was buttery, smooth, and not at all oily. The flavors were vibrant without tasting 'fishy'. The sourdough bread was a fantastic complement to my soup. You know a restaurant is good when their bread is delicious. It really was. It was soft on the inside, and slightly crisp on the outside. This is how bread should be. The baked oysters were an explosion of flavor; just delicious. My mother commented they were the \"best oysters\" she has ever tasted...and trust me, she's had a lot of them. We also ordered the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e -- perfect, just perfect. The strawberry tres leches cake was also very good. I've made that type of cake before, and this one was rich in flavor and light in texture. Not to mention, the service was great; overall, very sophisticated and accommodating. We will definitely be back!", "author": "Camilla L."}

Google the quote for more information like I had to since I am from the east coast. Then we paid tax on the food bill subtotal + Sf Emp Ord 4% for a total bill of $93(rounded). Fog Harbor bill includes a suggested gratuity amounts. The suggested gratuity excludes this controversial tax, as it should. It does not feel right also for a tax to include this Sf Emp Ord 4% either (taxing a tax); a double tax situation. \n\nControversy aside, the food is very good-unequivocally. The Wedge Blue Cheese Salad with bacon was perfect with the sourdough bread. We had the fried combo(calamari, fish, & shrimp), 2 orders. I prefer the squiggly ends of the calamari. My companion likes only the rounded pieces. We traded and ate the pieces each of us like since each plate had some of both. Forgo drinks, if you want to be frugal. Our food came to $52, not bad considering this is SF, Fisherman's Wharf & on the pier. The view is tax worthy. The ambiance of Fog Harbor & the pier area in tax worthy. So freak, perhaps taxing patrons directly for employees health insurance is okay too, just as long as the employees get all the money and none of it magically improves Fog Harbors bottom line.  The folks making all the wonderful food appear deserve health insurance. That is not a controversy for me. \n\nWe were seated at a window table for 2 looking at Pier 42 from Pier 39.", "author": "Esther Z."}

A group of men who were directly in front of me and had 15 in their party were seated immediately while several other tables waited.

The bar servers were quite attentive, but weren't great at recommendations, they just did what I asked.  \n\nBest dish was the clam chowder.  The menu boasts it as a favorite and I was not disappointed.  The carb cake dinner however - yikes.  My crab cakes tasted as if they were breaded with Jiffy cornbread mix.

We sat at the bar to avoid a wait however the  service we received at the bar was impeccable.  Our waitress (Morgan M.) was warm and attentive even though she was very busy.  Now for the food - excellent!!! My husband had the mixed grill and the fried calamari.  The calamari was tasty and he loved the added kick of the jalape\u00f1os that were fried and mixed in.  The aeoli with the calamari was good also.  I had the crab cake app - it was fresh and tastey.  I had the shell platter for 1 which was very good.

I always check Yelp reviews before checking out anything new to me, and sometimes, I end up totally disagreeing with the high reviews. But not this one! I was worried we would have to wait a long time because we were a party of 8 and when I called one week prior, the reservations were already filled up, so I couldn't make a reservation. But we were really lucky and ended up waiting only a few minutes for the perfect table next to the window. I was surprised how busy the place was at 4:30...it just shows how good it is! Our server, Samir, was great and even sang Happy Birthday to me since it was my birthday. The food...oh, the food...soooooo yummy!!  I loved every bite.

My name was called, they then walked is to a nice quite corner that had a beautiful view while the others that were let in before us got a nice seat in the middle of the restaurant. Well played. Well played. \n\nBeing on vacation I was happy anyway but looking at the menu made me even more happy! They had a great selection steaks and seafood with beautiful combinations, just thinking about it makes my mouth water!! I had the steak with blue cheese sauce with Spinach on the side. Rare. Always rare. Man this was the most AMAZING steak I have ever had in my life! It melted on my mouth like it was sugar. The taste of the fresh beautifully cooked meat was like non other! I can't remember the exact name of the steak cut but it was the most expensive one around $36 but oh man was it worth it. \n\nThen came dessert. They bring you a platter of fake desserts so you can actually see what you are about to order. I thought it was very bizarre seeing it happen to other people around the restaurant but when it came to our turn it made choosing much easier. Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-27", "description": "My plans for an afternoon meal by the wharf were tragically shot by a lack of proper foresight. Little did I know that the place I'd been mentally hyping up for the past week isn't actually open for three out of seven days of the week. The dread of pulling on Sammy Aloha's closed doors could only be summed up by the patronizing voice in my own head, bitterly muttering: \"ya done goofed, kid; no poke for you, fool.\" I had ZERO plans of hopping back onto the Embarcadero before I got my seafood fix, so naturally, I shuffled over to the nearest semi-decent sounding place within a 6-minute walk.\n\nFog Harbor is a pretty hoppin' Pier 39 spot, so it's no surprise that it's constantly flooded with hungry tourists during weekend lunch hours. Luckily, classic Bay Area traffic brought us in a little after the lunch rush, closer to a quarter past two. We were seated in no time at all. The restaurant is situated in a pretty clutch position, smack dab in the middle of the tourist-centric marina and a stone's throw away from the sea lions (aka the only reason people actually want to go to Pier 39). Pretty prime ambience: a table by the window gets you gratuitous sunlight and a great waterfront view. That alone makes half of the dining experience here. Notably, they nab their seafood from sustainable local suppliers; regardless of whether or not that's a cause that you actually care about, it guarantees fresher fish: net to plate.\n\nThe food is solid but kind of delivers just a notch above what you'd expect from an upper-mid-scale tourist trap. I grabbed a ginger negroni to start, and it was perfectly adequate. The swordfish was a great dish: expertly cooked, wonderfully fresh, tasty blend of flavor. While I was a huge fan of the pesto aioli drizzled on top, i think the amount of chimichurri may have overwhelmed the plate a little bit. I snuck a few bites of the fried fare and wasn't wowed: the fish was fresh, flakey, and well battered but was generally super bland. Easily fixed by a shake or six of salt, but the dearth of seasoning left me wanting. The menu also has non-seafood options... though I'm not sure why you'd come here looking to eat anything else; legit all of it's fished out of the sea within the last 24 hours. If that prospect doesn't at least mildly excite you, you need to reevaluate your core life values.\n\nConsidering that I was originally hoping to grab a $10 bowl of poke, this was a splurgier alternative. But when it comes to travels, good food comes first: frugality (and diet) be damned! The service here is solid and speedy to the point that it can almost come off as snippy, but considering the nematode-like hordes of hungry travelers they have to deal with on the daily, I don't blame 'em. Bottom line: they still offer up a great bayside dining experience. This is one tourist trap that I wouldn't mind getting caught in again.", "author": "Rei R."}

The Tuna was huge and seared perfectly. The sauce was your typical mayo Japanese sauce drizzled over it. It was served on top of rice and veggies.

They didn't explain which oysters were which. And the tower only comes with half a lobster tail and a claw which I thought was rubbery and overcooked. \n\nThe cioppino was not good.

Chock full of tender clams and super creamy.  I'll come back just for that!  My husband and I both ordered the Crab Rolls, which were very good.  The bread was amazing and they were very generous with the crab.  The desserts looked amazing, but we were too full to partake.  \n\nI've been disappointed with many of the restaurants we've tried in the area of Pier 39, but this is a winner.  Prices were fair for what you are getting, expect $40 or more per person after drinks.", "author": "Kim L."}

My husband and I were looking for seafood near our hotel at the Warf and were a bit worried that the Warf restaurants would be a bit too touristy. Although the area was filled with tourist (him and I being 2 of them) there was some great people watching and excellent food at Fog Harbor to be had! We settled on the Cioppino and Salmon for entrees and made it a fat night by adding the Calamari & a cup of Clam Chowder for appetizers. Typically fired calamari is almost always the same, but the addition of friend jalape\u00f1os & onions and homemade dipping sauce made all the difference!

We spent all morning walking the pier and surrounding area trying to pick the best place for lunch. We ended up here because it was one of the highest ranked seafood restaurants on yelp. I am do glad we did!! \n There was about an hour wait but they call you so you can quickly pass the time shopping in the surrounding stores. We were not seated right next to the window but I think almost anywhere you sit in the restaurant you have a great view of the bay. Service was amazing. A manager walked by to check on us, took an order for another round of bar drinks and quickly brought them to our table. The food was AMAZING!! The clam chowder was the best I have ever had..anywhere!!!

Their clam chowder was so good, I decided to come back to try out their other foods.\n\nI had a TERRIBLE experience and I didn't even get to order.\nMy boyfriend and I (both asian) came on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. It wasn't very busy and the groups that were there were either getting their food or finishing up. We got seated by the window, which was lovely, and were given our menus. We were given bread and butter... mmm!\nOur waiter introduced himself and asked us if we were ready, we said \"no, can you give us a few minutes please?\"\n\nI didn't know a few minutes meant to never come back to our table.\n\nMore groups were being seated around us and what I noticed that they were non-asian. I don't want to be calling this waiter a racist but I did feel weirded out given the lack of service we were given and how different we were treated.\nThere was a couple who sat at the booth next to us who received their waters and other beverages before us. This couple came in about 10 minutes after us.\nEvery time our waiter would walk past our table, his back would be towards us and he never made eye contact with my boyfriend and I. He would check on other tables, especially the tables that came in AFTER us but never us. We made a point to stare at him whenever he was walking towards us but he never would go to our table.\n\nI would think, usually, if we stare down a waiter and try to get that eye contact, the waiter would come to our table to see if we were ready to order or better yet, get our waters or drinks in. But no. We sat there for 30 extra minutes as we watched our waiter take orders from the couple next to us and the group behind us. We sat there patiently in hopes that our waiter could come and take our orders because I was really excited to try out the other foods.\n\nNOPE. MORE TIME WASTED.\n\nAt this point we were frustrated. We saw the manager and explained our situation.\nThe manager apologized and said that the place got really busy and that there was only one server.\nOne server or not, it does NOT matter because you are obviously making an effort to ignore us. We don't mind if the service was slower but our waiter just never came to check on us even to get us our drinks! Instead, his back was always faced to us when he walked past us. I don't understand. It took us having to talk to the manager for the waiter to finally look at us. \n\nIf you didn't want to give us your service, don't waste our 40 minutes and just tell us to leave next time. I probably would've left happier.\n\nWe went down to the Charthouse after and had the best service with delicious food in a more beautiful setting. Go there instead guys!!", "author": "Christine N."}

First off if you do have to wait they have a great covered outdoor area with a fireplace and seating that's comfortable. Place was busy which I expected since it's at Pier 39. But it's a big place. I waited at the bar with some drinks. Serve staff was very knowledgeable about whiskey which was what I was looking for. Great drinks, great service there. Thank you. We get seated and our server was Lydia. Wonderful Italian woman that helped us choose what she thought we would like based on what we told her our tastes were. Everything from apps to our dinners were amazing. Didn't get to try dessert because the portions were pretty big and I just wouldn't have enjoyed it as much. I will definitely go back. The Manhattans are solid. Mussels spot on. Sword fish, salmon and tuna amazing.

There are plenty of seafood spots in Fishermans Wharf to choose from, BUT, we'd been walking all day and this place was less than a mile from our hotel, so Fog Harbor FTW! \n\nA new challenge presented itself when we told the waiter--shotout to the ever-so-handsome, fun, young waiter Curtis--that I'm vegetarian: no seafood, no fish sauces, no chicken or beef or fish broths, etc., like REAL, super vegetarian! Curtis didn't bat an eye, and went to place our orders. I was skeptical that they'd have anything, and Chrissy even suggested we go somewhere else, but our tired feet told us to stick it out! Usually you tell a waiter you're vegetarian and they bring out a giant plate of under-seasoned, sauce-less, bland steamed vegetables...blahhhhhh. BUT Fog Harbor FTW AGAIN!! Chrissy's crab dish was phenomenal, and I had the best mushrooms-in-white-sauce pasta dish ever made...and when I write ever, I mean like I'll take my meat-loving husband here next time just to be in its presence again! It was perfectly seasoned and had a delicate balance of savory flavors and decadence. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic and cozy, and people were dressed everywhere from tshirt and jeans to dresses and blazers.

Reyes blue cheese and herbs which was fine but 'fine' is my 4-letter word to describe it. There just wasn't anything special about it. When I think of San Francisco food I think of innovative and fresh and the menu stated 'fresh sourdough' but if they had served me a loaf from the grocery store nearby I wouldn't have been able to tell you the difference. \n\nThe second menu item I ordered sounded amazing so I was hoping it would redeem the fact that the bread was just so sad. Crispy Bay Scallops - Panko breaded and fried served with a roasted jalapeno aioli\n\nWhat I had imagined were these beautiful scallops that you were able to taste the freshness of the sea with a slight crisp and a pop of this gorgeous aioli, what I tasted however were these knuckle-sized deep fried greasy bites served with an equally greasy jalapeno mayonnaise rather than a bright aioli. The restaurant had so much potential to have their food set them apart but I felt I was eating out of necessity, not enjoyment so I wound up taking my food in a doggy bag and giving it to a local homeless man who would hopefully enjoy it far more than I would.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my glass of wine, a 2013 Argentinean Malbec, as well as the view when it wasn't filled with tacky office groups asking for the fruitiest drink on the menu.", "author": "Jessie E."}

We're aware they do have call ahead seating and other services.  \n\nWe put our name down at 8:50, and were quoted a 30 minute wait but to check back sooner.  I checked in after 20 minutes to check status, still about 6 parties in front of us.  I think checked at 30 minutes and was told just a while longer.  Finally we were seated after about 40-45 minutes.  That alone had my wife pretty irritated.  Its fine to wait, but numerous 3-4 party tables went ahead of us.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were greeted rudely by a our server.  I'm not going to name him because I don't like throwing someone under the bus if they maybe had one bad night.  My main issue is that he was a dick and had attitude to us for basically selfish reasons.  He was pissed that we had a kid 1, 2 that we weren't drinking, and 3 combine those 2 and you have your answer.  It's been a while since I've eaten at a place where the server was just flat out rude to this manner, it honestly caught me by surprise.  My kid was acting perfectly fine, no noise, tantrums, or any difficulty to deal with.  \n\nI'm giving the 2 stars instead of 1 because a few of the food items were good.  I thought the calamari was good, so was my clam chowder.  The mac n cheese was good also.  \n\nFor $10, I ate one of the worst wedge salads in my life.  \n\nAfter being treated like we were, and there being so many different choices to dine at in SF, I wont be going back here.  \n\nIf you have kids or aren't going to drink, don't dine here.", "author": "Ryan A."}

I must say that the food here is extremely tasty and good. The clam chowder was on point and it was very filling. I also had the mixed grill which was delicious, salmon, shrimps and swordfish. I tasted many salmons before in my life and this one was really fresh. Cooked to perfection. Vegetables on the side were okay. My gf had the Penne pasta and it was delicious, not a lot of cheese which was perfect. Our server was very friendly and very helpful. The place was crowded but we managed to get a great sitting in a corner overviewing alcatraz and the rest of fishermans wharf. Eating here has been a great experience to anyone who wants to try seafood and something original from San Francisco. Prices were okay, not cheap but if you like eating quality food then price are a bargain for what you get.", "author": "Daniel C."}

I don't care if you've already had 15 clam chowder bread bowls in fisherman's wharf yesterday. You're ordering the clam chowder here. Like other reviewers mention, the chowder isn't heavy or creamy. It's more broth-like. I thought I wouldn't like it as much, but I was pleasantly proved wrong. It was really delicious.

We could see only the peak of the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance, but there was a really good view of Alcatraz. \n\nWe started with the blue cheese garlic bread and scallop appetizer. Of the two, I preferred the scallops, which was a very good portion for sharing. The jalape\u00f1o aioli dipping sauce paired well with scallops also! As a Caesar salad lover, I ordered the crab and avocado Caesar salad, which also had tortilla strips. Not the traditional Caesar salad but I loved it! My friend ordered chicken pasta and substituted the penne pasta for linguini. She wasn't thrilled, more so content. She expected the pasta sauce to be creamy and it was not.

The location of this restaurant is very convenient because it is visible right as you enter Pier 39. As I entered the restaurant I liked how it looked, simple yet elegant at the same time. Looked clean and somewhat spacious. \n\nService:\nFor me, not only is the food important but as well as the service. When I was greeted by the hostess, she did not smile and eye contact was barely given. I just assumed it was a busy day and let it go. Our server was nice although it seemed as if he was always rushing and I constantly had to get his attention whenever I had a question or wanted to order another dish. The only time he came to our table was when he served our food, he did not check up on us on his own unless I waived for his attention. \n\nFood:\nBefore any of our food arrived, complimentary sourdough bread was served. It was actually super fresh and delicious and I couldn't stop eating it. For appetizer we ordered the Crispy Lemon Calamari which was pretty good and the lemon aioli sauce it came with was delicious. Also we ordered a cup of their \"award-winning\" clam chowder which was really good and I can see why it is very popular. For the main course we decided to try the Mix Grill and Seafood Penne. Both dishes were decent, nothing too amazing. All of the dishes we ordered arrived fairly quickly, didn't have to wait too long which is good because I get \"HANGRY\" easily haha. \n\n\nOverall, the restaurant itself was okay.

Don't get me wrong, food was great, came to the table piping hot. It's the host in the front that made the day off to a bad start. Attitude is what greeted us. Trying to sum this up: made reservations at 11:30 AM , while in the car, out of courtesy as a customer I called the restaurant and informed them that we are currently in the vicinity and we hit a bit of a traffic (even though we left our house at a good time to try to avoid stuff like this since we know it's a tourist spot). Well, the host said we can only hold your reservation for so long or else we will give your table away. Never did she say there's a 10 minute hold from the original reservation time.\nAnyway, I'm travelling with my dad who was on a wheelchair, so the rest of the family took my dad to find an elevator while in the meantime I went upstairs to check in, as far as I know, I looked at my watch and I stepped foot in front of this hostess at 11:45 AM, you would think she wouldn't give away our table right? well, she said your 20 minutes late! there's a 10 minute policy! (mind you she never said that to me on my courtesy call to them!) I gave away your table, I can give you the high table since your table is gone.. I'm like, well you know I have a person in a wheelchair and I don't think my father can sit up there. She said, well you will have to wait another 30-40 minutes! At this time, I was livid! Obviously, she won't sit us at all so we waited and waited, my sister asked again after 30 minutes or so, \"yes, the table should be ready, they are paying..\" - still with attitude. \nThen I noticed she disappeared, and out comes the restaurant manager whom dealt with us and sat us and made sure we were served promptly! The manager knew that we were waiting for quite sometime, he was very apologetic. I told him your hostess needs a attitude check! He said that he will be the one to take us to the table because the hostess said that we were acting MAD, really? of course were irritated, you gave our table away!! I'm sorry, my family does not shout at anyone, she made it sound that we were causing a scene!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-18", "description": "In early April-2015 when I was in San Francisco, my first experience of the local clam chowder was Boudin on Market Street. I was fortunate not to have started with one that set the standard too high or low because it would have complicated my experience of all others.\n\nMy second was Fog Harbor at Pier 39. This is a big and lovely beautifully maintained restaurant. I was dressed casually (and probably with \"tourist\" painted all over me) and underdressed for their fine dining establishment, but the hostess and server were still very friendly and helpful. Going in right at 10:30 AM when they opened, I was basically the first one in and had the run of the place.\nI highly recommend going early and having a relaxing, quiet, meal, upstairs and away from the throng belong. Also, you are guaranteed a window seat if you like beautiful water/harbour views.\n\nI was just there for the clam chowder and nothing else -- I had aimed to chowder my way down Fisherman's Wharf, or at least as much as my appetite would allow.\nFog Harbor had an \"award winning\" chowder, or so their menu claimed. But when I asked my server, she had no clue. She did come back after asking the manager to convey that they won #2 place as the People's Choice. After my visit to San Francisco, I did some digging online and came up with the 2014 winners of the Fisherman's Wharf clam chowder cookoff:\n\nPeople's Choice\n1. Blue Mermaid Chowder House\n2. Fog Harbor Fish House\n3. Pier Market\n\nJudges' Choice\n1. Blue Mermaid Chowder House\n2. Pier Market\n3. Lou's Fish Shack\n\nIt was strange that throughout my trip I hadn't seen this chowder cookoff advertised more, especially by the winners.\n\nClam Chowder ($8 bowl, no bread)\n- Fog Harbor does make a really tasty clam chowder.\n- Compared to Boudin's, this is thicker, creamier, and felt richer.\n- Price is also good at Pier 39 at just $8, though you will probably end up paying $10 after tax, tip, and employer mandate.\n- The under-$7 price of Boudin on Market Street still can't be beat, but at Fisherman's Wharf, the Boudin outlets charge over $8 for their clam chowder.\n\nI should have been more diligent about finding out the winners of the clam chowder cookoff, but at the east end of Fisherman's Wharf, you can't go wrong with Fog Harbor for clam chowder.\nIf your opportunities to eat in San Francisco are limited, go early and just have the chowder.\n\nDining at Fog Harbor also gets you 30% off coffee at Biscoff Coffee Corner, right at the entrance of Pier 39 -- look at the bottom of your bill.\n\nAlthough I am giving them 5-stars, keep in mind this is based only on my specific experience of clam chowder only and going early enough to be the only customer and therefore having the run of the place and its beautiful views, on top of having a server who didn't need to run around tending other tables.", "author": "Simon S."}

They are famous for their clam chowder and that was a must have!  We ordered:\n\nSoup and Salad Combo (($14.00) Caesar salad with chicken & clam chowder in a bread bowl.  Probably the best clam chowder I've ever had!  There were lots of clams in it and the soup was not watered down.  I love eating soup that you can actually chew!  Very creamy, buttery, and full of goodness!\n\nFish & Chips ($16.00)- Hand dipped in \"Anchor Steam\" beer batter with cole slaw.  The best fish and chips I've had as well! Super crunchy and full of flavors!  Definitely fills you up!  If you get this, maybe order another dish so you won't get sick of it!  Sharing is caring ;)\n\n\nMixed Grill ($23.00): Grilled Salmon, Swordfish and Shrimp, citrus buerre blanc, sauteed vegetables, and garlic mashed potatoes.  This was just an okay dish.  I tried to be healthy and order something that was in that range but this dish was just kinda blah.  The swordfish and salmon were kind of dried but the shrimp and mashed potatoes were phenomenal! Buttery!\n\nThis is a very busy restaurant so make sure that when you get your bill, check it!  Our waiter actually gave us the wrong bill so good thing I checked it!  After the bill comes out, you get some kind of gingerbread cookie!  Very delish!\n\nOverall, this place was good!

Well, Fog Harbor just raise the dining points in Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nThe restaurant is big and with a lot of seats that has amazing view--AMAZING VIEW as in you can see Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz or the seals/sea lions in different combinations or even all three! It is big enough that on a Saturday we didn't have to arrive early or make reservation to get a perfect view. But the restaurant does get full. \n\nOne thing I especially like is that the restaurant is pretty generous on table space--most tables are for 4, and they let us (a group of 2) seat at a 4 people table so that both of us can face the view. \n\nEnough about view, we ordered Shellfish platter for one, a cup of chowder and a Fish&Chips. Shellfish platter is delicious! I was debating between it and Cioppino, but in my experience the latter is always saltier than I like. Shellfish platter was very flavorful and yet not overly spiced, so I can still taste the clams were fresh. The crab was also very plump and full. The fish&chip was also good, the cole-slaw was very refreshing and not drench in sauces. \n\nThe price was in deed on a higher end, but consider its location, it's seafood, and the view it has, I would say it is reasonable, especially for a special occasion.

We ordered fried calamari, Cesar salad added crab, mussel fries, 2 bowls of clam chowder and half a dozen oysters for appetizers. \n\nWarm sour dough was brought out first. It was good but nothing to brag about. Then our appetizers came. The calamari was good, it only comes with tarter sauce though. The mussel fries was really good.

Clam chowder was good, it was amongst one of the best we've bad. Here's the bad... I order half a dozen oysters expecting it to be decent size.. But it was superrrrrr tinyyyy!!! And they only gave us 5. We pointed it out the server and she gave us an extra one but it was superrrrrr tinyyyyyy! Like m&m tiny.. Not worth it for $15!!\n\nEntrees came. It's probably safe to say my dad's entree, the cheapest was the best, linguine and clams. It came with only 5-6 shelled clams and some canned clams. But he seemed to enjoy it. \n\nI ordered the salmon entree. The fish was cooked perfectly but the flavor was just everywhere. Salmon was sitting on top of potato fingerlings, corn, salsa, red bell peppers (which was sour) and some greens. It was too much going on. It was hard to enjoy.\n\nMy husband ordered the ahi tuna steak.. He said the same thing I said about the tuna. Too much going on. It was hard to enjoy the fish itself even though the fish was cooked well. \n\nLastly.. Took my mom here to celebrate mothers day early and she loves crab. She ordered the shellfish platter for one. It came with half a crab, mussels, shrimp and fingerling potatoes. She was super disappointed as it lacked flavor of any kind. There was empty mussels shells and super small shrimps and the crab was tasteless. It was disappointing because she was really excited about this dish seeing other patrons order it too.

She made sure we had everything we needed and came over several times to see how we were doing. She even helped us open the towelette packet and put on our bibs. The manager, I believe, noticed we needed something and immediately helped us and thanked us for being patient. My scarf fell off my chair to the floor and a different server noticed and picked it up for me. The entire staff was top-notch. Excellent service all around. Very impressed (and I'm not usually that impressed by service).\n\nDecor: Dark and intimate. Very fancy and upscale atmosphere, but the attire ranges from casual to fancy. Although it is fancy, nothing about this place screams snobbish (being tourist friendly helps). Even the bathrooms are clean and nice. Definitely request to get a seat by the window. The view of the bay is incredible. Where else can you go fine dining and look out the window and see the boats glistening in the water up close? I felt like I was on the Titanic.\n\nFood: I loved how the Darigold butter was slightly warm and melted, which makes applying it on the sourdough bread much easier. The garlic roasted dungeness crab was superb and was my absolute favorite dish here. It comes with roasted fingerling potatoes, corn on the cob, and garlic oil sauce. Absolutely delicious. After having the perfect dungeness crab as the first dish, it set the bar so high that no other crab dish could really compare. The crab clam chowder was good and rich, and also another favorite. The swordfish and crab linguini alfredo were good, but personally not as impressive. The chocolate lava cake was to die for. It wasn't runny in the middle like other lava cakes, but the instant you put it in your mouth and your tongue touches it, it melts into liquid chocolate. What kind of witchery is this? Seriously. It was like MAGIC. It looked like a regular chocolate cake but it melts into chocolate in your mouth! I still can't get over how amazing and mind-blowing it was. It was very rich like a brownie and the vanilla ice cream pairing was the perfect complement to it. The whipped cream was also sweet and flavorful, and definitely not from a store-bought spray can. I was so fascinated by the lava cake that I immediately googled recipes so I can attempt to make my own cake-that-turns-into-chocolate-the-second-it-enters-your-mouth.\n\nI am dreaming (& drooling) of the day when I can come back and have another taste of the heavenly dungeness crab and lava cake.", "author": "Vicki L."}

The wait was not too bad considering it was Valentine's Day weekend (we waited for maybe 20-30 minutes during lunch time, which was not bad at all). The reason for the 4 star is because the service was ok. I forget who our waitress was but she was so slow and she lacked energy.

My girlfriends ordered the seafood penne, new york steak, and the seafood cioppino. We all took a sample bite of each other's orders. Their clam chowder was good, but not as \"award winning\" as id expected. Calamarie tasted mediocre.  I actually only ate about three pieces, they werent very appetizing for some reason.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-04-12", "description": "When I lived in the Bay Area, this was my go-to spot for clam chowder. My wife and I ate it once a month, and each time it was perfect! My last time here, I was on a trip to the Bay Area from SoCal, so it was a highly anticipated spot for us. \n\nFood: Before this last time dining at Fog Harbor Fish House, my wife and I probably came here 15+ times, and every time, we enjoyed their clam chowder and random other dishes. The clam chowder did not meet our expectations. I could see it after my wife took her first spoonful of clam chowder; her expression was confused. I took a bite and was very disappointed. I've had lots of clam chowder before and can say it was still better than most, but when you have high expectations, the disappointment when they're not met just makes the meal that less enjoyable. That was the beginning. I am partly to blame for this flub (since I didn't read the updated description), but we ordered the crispy calamari, because we loved it so much before. I don't know any other restaurant that puts \"crispy calamari\" on the menu, and then gives you a plate of fried jalapenos and onions, and some fried calamari. There were like 4-6 pieces of calamari on the entire plate for $12?... I wanted so much to enjoy my meal here. I even brought two friends on my trip to the Bay Area and raved about how great this restaurant was. Disappointment to the maximus. Overall, the clam chowder was decent but lost its WAM BAM deliciousness. The calamari just made me angry. +1/2 stars\n\nService: The service was good. our server was very friendly and pretty quick with our orders. +1/1 star\n\nRestaurant/Ambiance: The restaurant feels upscale. It has a great view and is really bright from the sun rays. I really like the feel of the restaurant. +1/1 star\n\nWould I go back? No. 0/1 star\n\nTotal: 3/5 stars.

Everyone goes out of their way to make sure you are happy and comfortable. Which I was. \nThe only reason my rating is so low is the food. Of course since I didn't order the entire menu I can only speak for a few things. \nThe Clam Chowder - delish, honestly the only thing I had there that I can say I have zero complaints about. It was the perfect consistency, plump and meaty clams with a smokey flavor and potatoes. It was great! \n\nThe Mini Sliders - ordered by my best friend. She asked for veeeery well done. But they came out just over medium well. Which was her only complaint. Also her fries were brought out stale as if they were sitting for a while and reheated BUT the manager who was checking on everyone fixed that in an instant and had hot fresh fries out to our table in no time. Which were delish. \n\nThe Salmon Club Salad - this was an interesting dish and as tasty as it was it just seemed so...misplaced.  Smoked Salmon is just so better off served with romaine lettuce and shouldn't be served with the softer greens, but that's just a personal opinion. I also much admit that while the clams from the clam chowder I had earlier had a perfect smokey end taste, the salmon left a taste that made me feel like it wasn't from the freshest of waters, and lastly my tomatoes were old and browsing which wasn't so great. All in all the salad was lacking. It was good...but lacking. I think they should definitely try a romaine lettuce with it. And use fresh tomatoes. \n\nFor dessert we had the fudge brownie a la mode with whipped cream. The brownie I guess isn't a brownie but more like batter? Because it was super soft and almost like a soft grain pudding. \n\nOther than that, I'd say the views are beautiful. Like breathtakingly beautiful.

Anyway, we planned on doing a pork bun crawl in Chinatown after so we wanted a nice nomnom gig early so then we could get on our way. Showing up at 1130, we had already decided on the chowder, baked oysters and garlic dungeness so our order was already locked down but we were very tempted by several other offerings- this is a REALLY well thought out menu.\n\nGreat food is one thing but it's pretty hard to find and keep good people in the service industry... I know because that was my world too. A great experience starts with prompt, professional (and please....no canned training cheese lines) and just heads up effort. We were lucky enough to get Susan as our server/host. Clearly, a savvy veteran of the craft and exactly what we were hoping for.  I'm not saying anybody else is a letdown because clearly the service level, presentation and attention to detail is evident- but I mention Susan and the quality operation not only as a heads up for yelpers but a  bravo to Fog Harbor.  This isn't some chain trying to flip tables. We had that perfect table too- watching the sea lions, the  craft and Alcatraz... just awesome. \n\nThe food was perfect. I chef a little myself so I'm pretty damn picky. The chowder served with fresh HOT sourdough was epic. My wife and debated on whose was better between them and Pike Place... but it's THAT good.

I realized that I'd actually eaten at Fog Harbor Fish House during my first visit to SF exactly 7 years ago!  I was not disappointed at all by my second visit. \n\nIt was a beautiful and clear (not foggy at all!) day in San Francisco and the tourists were all abuzz in the pier area.  Though Fog Harbor Fish House is a huge tourist attraction, it's definitely not a tourist trap.  I really enjoyed the service (very nice!) and also the selection of foods.  I was stuck between choosing the seafood platter or the seared ahi tuna.  In the end, I went with the seared ahi tuna, and it came with this amazing wild rice and seasonal vegetables!  The tuna was a very decent portion and it came crusted with sesame seeds and a ginger glaze.  So delicious!  \n\nTo top it off, I got a bowl of clam chowder (their chowder is amazing here!) and a pina colada on the side. \n\nWe had such an excellent view of the bay - the Golden Gate bridge was in view, as was Alcatraz island.  \n\nWhat a lovely visit to SF!

And warm baguette alongside if you need more carbs to dip.  Yaaaaas.  Delicious!  Great for sharing, and expect big fat mussels and lots o' fries.\n\nMixed Grill - they split this onto two plates for us, which was very nice.

Others prefer to break-open the goodness, but I decided against a messy meal.\n\nMy wife had the mixed grilled seafood consisting of grilled salmon, swordfish and shrimp, citrus buerre blanc, sauteed vegetables and wild rice.  My daughters went with the crab cakes and pan-seared chicken breast.  All plates completely cleaned-out.  \n\nThe most notable 2 dishes that stood-out from the rest that you ABSOLUTELY must try have to be the following:\n\n1) Mussel Fries\n2) Clam Chowder (Best I've tasted in San Francisco)\n\nOur waiter was Scottie- He was the most knowledgeable, funny and down to earth server.  Very attentive and made great recommendations.  Well-deserved tip for this guy.\n\n       *****Read below when reserving a seat with the hostess outside the entrance:*****\n\n(Knocked-off 1 star for this)\n\nIf you happen to go here during lunch on a weekend, the hostess will take your cell phone number down and send you a text if the wait should be horrendously long.  You can tell if many people are lounging around the outdoor seating area.    \n\nKeep an eye out on your phone because the text message is a confirmation whether or not you still want your reserved table.  The text is NOT, I repeat, NOT a message telling you your table is ready.  I learned this the hard way by reading my message 10 min. late and then responding 10 minutes later.  The hostess had thought we no longer needed our seats and gave them up to the next party on the list.  When it told her that I read the text message late, we had to wait an additional 20 min.  Our entire wait ended up being over 40 min.  She apologized and said there were too many people even after I told her that my wife was sitting at the couch next to her the whole time.

I wave my hand to flag the young bartender with short brown hair down.  He looks away.  Someone else waves at him, and he goes over to help them.  So I see waving does work for other people.  So I wave at him again after he finishes with that customer.  He says he'll be right with me.  He does something else, then another customer waves him down.  He goes and helps that customer immediately.  WTF? Then he helps yet another customer.  Then he walks off. So I went to Crab Shack in front of Pier Market and got a crab cocktail, crab roll, and crab cake all for the same price as just one crab cocktail here.  Forget this place!! \n\n\nThe rest of the staff did seem friendly and competent, so +1 for the first of them.  Just the bar is lazy and poorly supervised.", "author": "Jay E."}

We told our server that we were sharing, and to our surprise, they split it for us in separate bowls, easier for us to just dig in when it arrived at our table rather than asking for another plate and separating it ourselves, likes what I expect at other restaurants... Anyways, the plate was good, not worth $18 in my opinion.  \n\nFor Dessert, we got the chocolate cake and vanilla ice cream and the Tiramisu.  \nThe chocolate cake was semi-sweet, and was light, fluffy, and melted in my mouth.  It was to die for.

The food was worth about 1/10 of the price and the service was just as bad. We had a reservation here for our \"nice\" family dinner while on vacation in SF. We had high expectations because of the good ratings (which I'm really confused about now) and because we ate at Alioto's as few years back in the same area (and it was fantastic). This place, however, was a sad, mediocre excuse for a seafood restaurant. Our waitress, though polite, was literally looking at other customers and around the restaurant while taking our order. It soured our experience from the start. The menu is limited and there is nothing special on it. I had the fried shrimp because I really didn't want anything else on the menu, and it was as good as fried shrimp at Sizzler. My daughter had the Linguine with clams and I was actually angry when I saw the microscopic size of the clams. The linguine seemed like it was just boiled and put on the plate. White wine sauce? Hahahaha - you must be joking! What a sham! My husband had the Ahi Tuna and it was less than stellar also. We left feeling fleeced. The carpet was filthy also.

I expected something more shack like and when I first saw the restaurant I was afraid it was gonna be a tourist trap, but the food was amazing! \n\nI ordered the jumbo shrimp cocktail and the sourdough bowl chowder. The shrimp (which I think was expensive for 6 large shrimps) tasted very fresh, the cocktail sauce had an unexpected kick as well. While I would order it again, I think $16 for 6 pieces of shrimp is very pricy. \n\nThe clam chowder was excellent as well. The soup came in a hot toasted bread bowl and was piping hot as well. Very well seasoned with lots of pieces of clams. The clams were no overcooked (which can be a problem when mass producing clan chowder) and it was very filling. It was also a good price as well,  I would have no problems ordering the bowl of soup again since it was about 2 cups of soup for $10. \n\nThe service was meh, they were obviously busy but I didn't think they were packed and yet our waitress who was very nice and polite never really came by. We had to our our drinks from someone we flagged down and we did so for the rest of the meal. \n\nBoth the high price point on the shrimp and the service contributed to the 4 stars instead of 5 stars but I would highly recommend this restaurant to those visiting the pier.", "author": "Janice C."}

We are so happy we chose this place out of all the places on pier 39 because it was delicious. \nFirst off, when we went to put our names in, there was an hour wait. Normally we wouldn't have stuck around but since its located on the pier there was a lot for us to do to kill time! A little before an hour passed we got a text that they were ready. First impression when we walked in: 'We are not dressed appropriately.' Lol! It is so beautiful inside and we were all in sweat shirts pretty much, but anyway, gorgeous view! I can definitely see why its voted best view. Service was great and quick. Its a nice restaurant but the prices are fair. \nI originially was going to order the fish n chips but I went with the chowder instead. My boyfriend got the fish n chips so we could share. The chowder was good, but it was very filling. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I didn't eat much of it yet I felt full. The fish n chips were amazing! I wish I would have ordered those instead. The batter was perfectly crisp yet not too heavy and the fish was so tender. The tartar sauce? Yeah that was bomb as well. I wish I lived closer, but now each time I travel here I know where I am coming for dinner!", "author": "Nichole B."}

We arrived after the lunch crowd but before the dinner crowd so the restaurant wasn't very busy. We were seated right away at the back with a nice view of Coit Tower to the left and the bay to the right. \n\nWe were given fresh sourdough bread and butter. What I ordered was simple, fried shrimp with fries and coleslaw and hubby had Seafood Penne with fresh fish, clams and mussels in a tomato cream sauce. The food was fresh and hot, good but nothing special. The shrimp was medium in size and fried to a nice golden crisp but unremarkable in taste as was the fries and coleslaw. Per my husband although the seafood was fresh the seafood penne was bland. The service was average, our waiter was more interested in the 3 girls that was seated at the table next to us and totally abandoned our table.  Even when he was at the other table we couldn't get his attention and he pretty much ignored us, we had to flag down another waiter to get our check because our waiter disappeared. \n\nThe food was fresh and the views were really nice, definitely worth a 2nd visit but would order something totally different.", "author": "Vikki J."}

My girlfriend and I just decided that we wanted some clam chowder, and they happened to serve it.\n\nThey claim to have the best clam chowder in all of San Francisco, and I can vouch for them on that.

It was a chilly day in the city, and to be able to sit down and eat something warm was perfect.\n\nI do have to praise their level of service as well.

My wife and I both had chowder, and she ordered the fried shrimp platter - I ordered the combo platter. The chowder was excellent, the shrimp very good, but the fish and calamari were below average - dry and seemed likely to have been recently frozen.  \n\nI also had a Fog Harbor draft beer, and my wife had a margarita. The beer selection is a bit scant, but I enjoyed my beer. My wife stated her margarita was excellent. \n\nThe server was efficient and attentive, and the view of the bay was very good. \n\nOf particular note, was the addition of a 4.75% surcharge, which apparently the restaurant adds onto each bill to cover their fees to the city for mandated health insurance coverage for their employees. I find this practice to be particularly \"distasteful\" (pun intended).  It is this restaurant's choice to display this fee on each customer's bill, instead of either absorbing the cost into their overhead, or including the fee in the menu pricing (which is where all other overhead resides). However, I guess it is consistent:  consumers pay the servers' salaries directly in the forms of tips, and now we are also paying their health insurance directly in form of the surcharge.  \n\nIn summary, I deducted one star for the healthcare surcharge practice and one star for the food quality.", "author": "Dave W."}

Fog Harbor had some really good reviews, and one of my colleagues mentioned wanting to go, so we did! \n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant. The view was really nice, and it was quiet on a Wednesday afternoon. Service was a little slower than it should have been, but it was OK since we weren't in a rush to go anywhere. We ordered the spicy shrimp, calamari and the blue cheese garlic bread for appetizers. One person ordered the clam chowder, since the menu called it out as being \"award winning.\" He confirmed it was in fact deserving of the award winning tag.\n\nA few of us ordered the Chipotle burger, and we all agreed it was great. I asked for the sauce on the side, and was glad I did, since I wasn't a big fan of it. Others ordered salads, or fish n chips. I heard the fish n chips weren't amazing, but were just fine. Portions are pretty large. \n\nAfter our entrees we were enticed by the dessert tray. MMM! Who can pass that up? We ended up getting some creme brulee, warm chocolate cake, and the cookie brownie thing.

I've been living in San Francisco for almost 4 years, and I usually avoid pier 39 like the plague. However, today my yearning for sourdough bread drew me to Fog Harbor. \n\nWhen I entered, I was pleasantly surprised by the cozy entranceway with the cascading waterfall. I especially liked that the water was running super fast, much faster than normal... But anyway, my name was called within 20 minutes (845 pm on a Wednesday night), and I was seated by the extremely cute host. I sat and was helped by my server, Meron, right away. I have to say, even within the first 5 minutes, I knew that she was the best server I have ever had. She asked if we wanted bread, and brought it out extremely quickly. I ordered the blue cheese garlic bread, clam chowder salad combo, and chili shrimp appetizer. This was all we ordered for me and my friend and she did not make me feel pressured at all to order more, which I appreciated.\n\nWe ate the bread in 5 seconds flat , and asked for more. Meron was a mind reader and knew right off the bat that we NEEDED two extra loaves. When I commended her for her foresight, she simply stated \"well, it's amazing to dip into your shrimp sauce.\" UHHHH HOLY CRAP. ITS LIKE SHE HAS LOOKED THROUGH MY EYES AND INTO MY SOUL AND LEARNED ALL THAT ANYONE COULD EVER LEARN ABOUT ME IN 2 MINUTES OF TALKING TO ME. I love her. \n\nAside from the amazing service, the food was way more phenomenal than I would have ever thought for the area. That chili shrimp has perfectly cooked onions, the bread was warm and fluffy and delicious. The clam chowder was good, but I wouldn't say it was my favorite. It was extremely creamy and buttery. I'm sure that it would taste amazing to most, but just didn't fit my preference that well. \n\nOverall, amazing restaurant. 10/10 would come back. Thanks for the yummy night!!", "author": "Step H."}

We almost ended up at Scoma's but I'm so glad we didn't! Fog Harbor exceeded our expectations. Starting off with two delicious cocktails (Manhattan and dirty martini) at the bar, we were given great recommendations from the bartender. After being seated at a window table with a wonderful view of the wharf and \"Happy Anniversary\" adorably scribbled on it, we began to indulge. \n\nFor our entrees my husband ordered the seafood cioppino which was chock full of large shell fish and a broth that lit up our tastebuds. He's literally still craving it 2 weeks later. I on the other hand decided to be difficult and create my own dish that was not on the menu. Our waiter Richard who was phenomenal and beyond accommodating, brought me exactly what I was craving (lobster and Dungeness crab pasta in a cream sauce) A-mazing!!\n\nAfter dinner we were gifted with a large and decadent dessert (a warm walnut brownie with ice cream) for our special occasion. All in all, Fog Harbor made it a very memorable night for us and we thank Richard and staff for the awesome service.", "author": "Tia G."}

Boyfriend got the fried combo and I got the pan seared chicken; both were delicious and we had leftovers due to filling up on the free Boutin bread.

As others may have mentioned in other reviews, their fish and chips lack flavor.  I know it sounds weird, but it really had no taste.  I felt like it could have used some salt and pepper before they dipped it into the batter or something.  However, the cole slaw that came with the fish and chips were good.

Not too bad so we decided to go for it. What seemed like 30 minutes later in the cold and numerous small and large partiesbbeing called in we decided to see how much longer. We were told 15 minutes. 20 minutes later we ask again and was told a few minutes. 5 minutes later i get a text saying to check in with front desk. I do so and they say table will be ready in a few minutes. Aight cool. 10 minutes pass and still nothing so we ask again and they table will be ready in 10 minutes. The hunger is real and we decide if it ain't ready in 10 minutes we'll just leave. Finally table is ready. Restaurant was super busy and was thinking this better be worth the wait. We get to our table and immediately meet our waiter Pedro. He gives us our menus and gives us a quick rundown of the specials and drinks. This is where our experience takes a turn for the best! We order our drinks and food. Our drinks, kids food and appetizers come out quick. Calamari appetizer with that garlic aioli was dank! Wife and ordered a lazy cioppino which came out next and came in 2 bowls. I told my wife we only ordered 1 unless this was split. I ask Pedro just to make sure. He replies back. I had them split it to make it easier. Wow! Very attentive. I'm impressed! Cioppino was excellent! The sourdough bread starter was excellent. Pedro was on top of his game throughout our dinner. I honestly have to say Pedro made this dinner and very enjoyable and memorable experience. Thank you very much Pedro! You are the man!", "author": "Giovanni G."}

The place is very nicely decorated and we were seated next to the windows. We got a very good view of the ocean and the activities outside! To top it off, our waiter was also very pleasant and gave us some recommendations of what we should order too. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n- Blue Cheese Garlic Bread: so good! It's a must-order starter. Definitely could of gotten full from this alone. \n- Fried Combo: Consisted of fried fish, calamari, shrimp, french fries and cole slaw. We could not finish this. It was huge. \n- Seafood Cioppino: We added the pasta with the crab, fish, shrimp, scallops, clams and mussels in the stew. This was amazing and definitely my favorite. I loved the crab and scallops; both were very fresh. We tried to finish this, but we couldn't either. \n\nThe portions here are huge. Everything was worth the price. The three of us could not finish our meals. My SoCal friend really liked this place. We really wanted to order dessert, but we were stuffed. \n\nAll of us definitely full and were happy to walk off our meal afterwards by the bay.

Paid $38+ for a bowl of cippiono that only had 2 clams 2 muscles and 2 shrimp. That's pretty shady if you ask me.It also came with crab and fish that I have no complaints about. Overall I've had way better cioppino. Sauce taste like ravioli sauce. Also ordered the clam chowder which was decent but again small portion for the pricing. My wife ordered calamari and filet mignon. Calamari was pretty good except for a few pieces that were a little bit chewy. She asked for medium for her steak but it turned out well done.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-02-09", "description": "This is your typical touristy restaurant in the Pier 39 area, which decent tasting food and a nice view, but inflated prices. Make sure you check in on Yelp to get a free Blue Cheese Garlic Bread appetizer. I came for my friend's birthday (Kellie C.!) since they have a separate room for large parties in the back of the restaurant, and were able to accommodate a group of 18 on a Thursday night. We came in around 8:15pm, and the table was ready, so we were seated right away. Although the table sat 18, we could've used a little more room. However, it worked out fine, and I got to try:\n\n-Blue Cheese Garlic Bread (Fresh Sourdough, Topped w/Garlic, Pt. Reyes Blue Cheese, Herbs, $8): Just ok. The blue cheese overpowered all the other flavors, and you couldn't taste the garlic. The bread was also too crunchy for my liking. Skip!\n-Oysters (Served w/Cocktail Sauce, Dozen $26, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw): The oysters were fresh, but the cocktail sauce and mignonette were just ok. I wish they had given us some Tabasco with the oysters. Skip!\n-Crispy Lemon Calamari (Seasoned w/Lemon, Served w/Lemon Aioli, $12, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#3lMGE6tFW3afyze8HNomkA): Yuck.. the calamari rings were chewy, and the batter was soggy. This is one of the worst fried calamari dishes I've had, and they should really re-look at their recipe. Skip!\n-Ahi Poke (Marinated Raw Tuna, Avocado, Mango, Sesame-Soy Sauce, Wasabi Aioli, $16): Ok. The tuna tasted fresh, and I liked the wasabi aioli. However, the sesame soy sauce didn't have much flavor, and the dish overall was bland. Skip!\n-Crab Louis ($22, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#_pzD387ZKQjuxDPLN0KIFA): They didn't skimp on the crab, and it tasted really fresh, which was great. However, there were pieces of cartilage in the crab, and the salad itself was bland. I wouldn't order this again.\n-Crab Roll (Fresh Crab, Celery, Shallot Aioli, Served on a Buttered Roll w/Sweet Potato Fries, $19, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#FyzyT_3ZvIESH5I0qp6APg): Pretty good if you like mayo, and I liked that they toasted the roll nicely. The sweet potato fries were also really good. Recommended!\n-Fish & Chips (Hand Dipped in \"Anchor Steam\" Beer Batter w/Cole Slaw, $17, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#EuuXw-pZ356IX--lG1jksA): They give you a huge portion (2 large and 2 medium sized fish sticks, fries, cole slaw), but the fish was just ok. I didn't like the taste and consistency of the batter- it tasted bitter from the beer, and was too crunchy. The cole slaw was also just so-so since it was very bland. However, the fries were done nicely, and the tartar sauce was delicious.\n-Award Winning Clam Chowder (The Best in San Francisco, Bowl, $8, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fog-harbor-fish-house-san-francisco-2?select=lXj3u1ALp1qyMLuGKOuoBw#s7bQ8LaMVBCTTvrlIYQd4Q): This was a pretty good version of clam chowder! It was rich and creamy, and there were big pieces of clam in the chowder. Recommended!\n-Apple Crisp a la Mode (House-Made w/Granny Smith Apples, Walnuts, Butter Crumb, Served Warm, Topped w/Vanilla Ice Cream, $8.50): Ok. I liked the butter crumb, but the apples were a little hard. I wouldn't order this again.\n-Warm Chocolate Lava Cake (w/Creamy Chocolate Center, Served w/Vanilla Ice Cream, $8.50): Just ok, nothing special. I wouldn't order this again.\n\nThe best dishes from here were the Crab Roll and Clam Chowder, and the fries from the fish and chips. Although I don't think I'd come back for those dishes again, I would recommend ordering them if you are dining here. The service was good up until the end- it took them a long time to bring the dessert and our check. Make sure you ask them to validate your parking ticket if you parked in the structure across the street.  \n\nOverall, there are so many better restaurants to eat at in SF, and it's not worth coming here unless you can expense your meal, or if you really want a view of the pier area.", "author": "Amy D."}

The fish was even more heavily battered than the calamari and the batter seemed almost burnt.  She removed the batter and it sat piled up on her plate while she tried to enjoy the tasteless fish which was covered by the batter.

It really doesn't take much to make seafood taste great.\n\nService was good but nothing special.\n\nI did expect the cost of the meal to be on the high side, considering the fact that the restaurant is located an Pier 39 and that was the only thing that was as expected.

I thought that was odd and made another reservation at approximately the same time. The day of my reservation I got a call from the restaurant asking if I really wanted two reservations or was that a mistake. I said I only needed one but my open table reservation had been cancelled and so I made another. The woman on the phone said the original reservation was on their books even though it wasn't on my open table app. As soon as I hung up the phone-my 2nd reservation was cancelled as well! So I ended up not getting the open table 100 points. I just thought that was strange but the experience at the restaurant made up for losing my 100 points. We were seated at a table in the bar area that I chose because it was pretty warm in the restaurant and this area was the coolest place.

I send more drinks back than I drink. \nWe ordered a crab Louis salad as an appetizer and it was HUGE and delicious. We didn't expect it to be as large as it was. House made dressing was the cherry on top of this perfectly made salad. For my entree Ron suggested  the Ahi Tuna $26\nSeared \"RARE\", sesame seed crust, ginger soy glaze, wasabi aioli, stir fried vegetables and garlic jasmine rice. I prefer medium rare so I ordered it that way and it came out perfectly. I keep using that word but I am serious when I say-I am a hard to please diner and this place was just hitting it out of the park. My husband and daughter couldn't believe it. My husband ordered the Cioppino $33\nCrab, fresh fish, shrimp, clams, scallops and mussels, stewed in a seafood tomato broth, and he was very happy-he called it the best he's ever had.  It was a huge portion and that always makes him happy as well. \nOur 16 year old daughter did not find anything on the menu that she wanted so I encouraged her to order the clam chowder and caesar salad plate. She loves a caesar salad but she did not like the clam chowder. When Ron noticed that she basically hadn't touched it he commiserated with her about living in San Francisco and not liking clam chowder. He took it off the bill even though we told him not to since she had eaten the salad! In the end she ordered the  Blondie Sundae $8.5:\nChocolate chip style brownie square with walnuts, topped with vanilla ice cream, biscoff cookie crumbles and a biscoff sweet spread drizzle. Dessert is always her favorite. Juan the manager came over and asked us how our meal was and we told him how amazing it was and how accommodating our server was. He then told us that he wanted to comp our daughter's dessert because she didn't like her clam chowder. I was shocked. I mean they had already took it off the bill and then gave her a free dessert??? We didn't ask for any of that. I am truly impressed with their commitment to making their diners happy. I can say that I will recommend this place to anyone going to the San Francisco area!", "author": "Lisa D."}

Our theme was seafood for our San Francisco stops, since I personally have never been to the Pacific coast and really wanted to test out what's so great about their seafood.\n\nWe reserved via OpenTable and had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a window seat, but we did get a seat eventually and were promptly served.\n\nOur dinner included the \"award winning\" clam chowder, dungeness crab cakes, garlic roasted crab, wild salmon, lobster tail, and the lobster mac and cheese. Well, the first thing we realized was we ordered way too much. I understood America and their big portions, but the portions were not just big, they were huge. The garlic roasted crab had to have been at least 5 pounds, and I was actually completely shocked my mom managed to finish the whole crab (although she didn't even touch the corn cob and potatoes). The lobster tail also tasted very good, and that we were actually able to complete. The award winning clam chowder definitely lived up to its name: Creamy (but not too creamy) soup with plentiful clam chunks and easy on the potatoes. The wild salmon was also good, however once again it was so large on portions we couldn't finish it. The lobster mac and cheese was baked and was probably the disappointment of the meal as it really didn't taste anything special, especially when comparing the other orders.\n\nService started brilliantly, and quite frankly I don't really blame the waitress that much for the slightly worse service we got as we were finishing our meal, since the restaurant closed at 10 and we were still eating at 10:45 (I did say the portions were huge!!!). We finally left around 11 and were the last customers departing the restaurant, having finally experienced seafood in the west coast...miles better than the east coast.", "author": "Calvin S."}

Although the exterior isn't much to look at, once you go upstairs and even to the waiting area, it's a really nice fine dining experience. \n\nA few friends and I were really in the mood for oysters at around 11am and found fog harbor through yelp. The view from the inside is amazing as you can look out across the pier and see all the boats and tourists wandering about. \n\nMy gf and I shared a dozen oysters ($25), a clam chowder bread bowl ($10) and a Dungeness crab roll ($19). I just had to order a crab dish as they just started their crab season just the day before.  \n\nThe oysters were freshly shucked (they shrunk as I added lemon juice) and very sweet, definitely did not disappoint. The clam chowder was very creamy and had lots of clams, although a bit lacking in the amount of actual chowder but its a novelty item so I didn't mind. The crab roll was overflowing with their crab mixture which had good amounts of crab that you could taste in a nicely toasted butter roll. \n\nAt the end of our meal, our server notified us that they were doing a promotion in which you rate your experience on your smartphone on their website and you get a complimentary dessert!! And they aren't the skimpy \"one ice cream scoop\" desserts. Actual full fledged desserts like a 5\" Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, huge slices of tiramisu, bread pudding. We got the cranberry and apple crumb cake with vanilla bean ice cream. A great way to finish off the meal. \n\nOur meal for the two of us came to about $75 because we were also ordering a few beers. I would definitely come back here again. Service and quality of food was spot on.", "author": "Justin L."}

I get it, it's annoying to get asked that question a million times a day, but hey guess what...it's your job. \n\nFood: I came here just for their \"award-winning\" chowder and it was far from award-winning in my opinion. The bread was a little too chewy for my taste. I prefer it to have more of a crispy exterior. The chowder was just chowder. My child's pasta had no flavor. It was like eating just cooked penne. Mussel fries were literally mussels topped with French fries, no wow-factor favors.

This reminded me of a 10x better version of the fish in McDonald's filet-o-fish (I'm a huge fan of that fast food sandwich). It came with a generous amount of fish, french fries, and cole slaw. \n-Crab Roll ($19): The sandwich was a bit smaller than I expected, but it was amazing! The bread part reminded me of the outside of a grilled cheese, and the crab part was kinda like a dungeness crab salad. It also came with a side of sweet potato fries + more crab.\n-Clam Chowder in Sourdough Bread Bowl ($10): Comparable to Boudin's but I might like this one even more.\n-Garlic Roasted Crab ($19): I didn't try any of my dad's entree, but I'll include a pic of it. He said it was very tasty.\n-I also loved the free bread that we got before our meal. It was still super hot, fresh, and crispy right from the oven.

We were advised to not eat at Pier 39 since it's a tourist trap, low quality food with a hefty price tag. Even though we were advised not to eat at Pier 39, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try anyways. We turned to yelp and saw that Fog Harbor had very good ratings based on their 1,000+ reviews.\n\nFor lunch on a Saturday, expect to wait. The wait wasn't too long considering how busy they were, we were seated within 20-30 minutes. Since my boyfriend and I love seafood we decided to order the Shellfish Platter for two. The platter comes with corns, shrimps, clams, mussels, and 1/2 a crab. While waiting for our order the waitress brought out fresh sourdough bread for us to enjoy and it was delicious.  \n\nWhen I placed the Shellfish platter order I was excited for my seafood lunch, but when the plate came out I was hugely disappointed. The amount of seafood that was provided did not seem like it was meant for two people. The mussels were very tiny, so tiny that when I ate them I couldn't really taste mussels. My boyfriend and I established that they could've been cove mussels since they were so small. Some of the clams were missing the actual clams, we were served with just their outer shells. The crab was very delicious, I wish we had more! Butter is used as the sauce for the platter, but we opted out of it and the platter tasted fine. Just drizzle some lemons (which were provided) and you are set, a much healthier and tastier alternative. \n\nI also ordered a cup of the clam chowder. I am a fan of clam chowder and I had to try their \"award winning house clam chowder\". The chowder was good, but compared to other clam chowders I had, it was a little bit saltier than I preferred. It was still good since I ended up finishing the cup! \n\nOverall, for the price you are paying the quality and quantity of food was not worth it.", "author": "Channy M."}

In the end, my lunch was a bit expensive (~ U$ 45 without dessert), but it was worth it because of the entire experience: the food, the place, the view from the window close to me - I got to see the pier, boats, the sea and Alcatraz as I enjoyed my meal.\nI ordered clam chowder as a starter, and my main plate was the Ahi Tuna (also very delicious). To drink I chose the Juice Press (berries, lemonade and sparkling water), which was refreshing.", "author": "Bruna Z."}

I'd been craving clam chowder for over a week and I wanted to see if this place really had the \"best clam chowder in SF\".\n\nI booked a reservation for 6:15 and called to change it to 6:45 and the lady on the phone was fairly accommodating and friendly. When we arrived, we were immediately seated at a table by the window (probably because I had mentioned that we were celebrating a birthday on our reservation) with a spectacular view of Alcatraz and the seals! Our amazing waiter, David, came by and introduced us to some special dishes on the menu. He also knew it was my birthday and told me they would prepare a chocolate dessert for us. When he came back with our drinks, we just ordered two bread bowls (we weren't crazy hungry because had sundaes two hours earlier). I knew about the Yelp check-in offer for the free appetizer but didn't now it only came with an order of an entree, but David was so kind and said he would bring us one out because it was my birthday. \n\nThe bread bowls were fairly large and definitely met our expectations. It was presented nicely (it wasn't messy like most bread bowls we order from other places) and not too salty or bland. Perfectly creamy. Had a lot of clams and potatoes too. Clam chowder is my favorite soup (and arguably one of my favorite foods in general) and I'd have to say this was the best I've ever had. Our only complaint would be there wasn't enough soup. The actual bread the soup came in was HUGE, but I'd say there was only about two cups of soup in the actual bread bowl. I was alright though (my friend was still a bit hungry but luckily we had our free appetizer!) because I was stuffed when I finished. I couldn't even finish the bread! \n\nOur waiter came by many times to ask us how our dishes were and how we were doing and even sang me happy birthday when he brought us our free chocolate dessert! The chocolate cake was a bit too sweet but it was extremely rich and went well with the scoop of vanilla ice cream next to it. \n\nOur bill only came to about $24 only because we had ordered two bread bowls, but it was amazing considering the fact that we got a free appetizer and dessert.\n\nOVERALL:\nClam chowder bread bowls - Best I've ever had and I'm a local! Not too salty and not too bland either. Only wish there was more soup and it was less pricey.\n\nBlue cheese bread appetizer - I love garlic bread and I love cheesy bread but this wasn't that good. I've never really liked the taste of blue cheese so this definitely wasn't my favorite. But it won't hurt to get it for free if you check in on yelp!\n\nService - absolutely amazing. The waiters were all extremely nice, especially David. \n\nAmbiance/View - has one of the best views of Pier 39. If you happen to get a seat on the left of the restaurant by the Bay, you'll be able to see Alcatraz and the area where the seals are. I specifically chose a reservation right before sunset and the view of the water was breathtaking. If it's too sunny they have blinds they'll be happy to pull down (or up) for you. Restaurant wasn't too loud and the restaurant was pretty busy (esp. for a Wednesday night). \n\n**they'll also validate your parking ticket for up to 4 hours if you came by car\n\nI'll definitely be coming back again!", "author": "Sharon C."}

We ordered one of their appetizer specials, risotto and crab fritters. We didn't like it but didn't complain. Our waiter asked how we liked it and we were honest. So he said we could order something else on the house. Who does that!? Plus he didn't hover and wasn't distant. We gave him 20% tip.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nClam chowder - delicious!\nCrab mango ceviche - yum\nCrab risotto balls fritters - okay\nLobster tail - yum\nSeafood Cioppino with pasta - yum\n\nI would have ordered dessert if they had cheesecake.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back.

Fog Harbor takes the cake between the two in my opinion.  \n\nFirst off, the complimentary bread was fresh out of the oven and heated!  I swear the bread was like crack!  I just couldn't stop eating it.  Despite being on a mission to lose weight and 'low carb' it, I couldn't help myself.  The bread served deserved 5 stars on its own!\n\nThe salad was refreshing and tasty!  They use mixed greens, unlike the other competitor with their iceberg.  \n\nThe clam chowder was outstanding!  It had a real good amount of clams in it.  It was very hearty and filled me up.  Mama dukes had it in a bread bowl and I ordered the regular bowl, which was fine because they serve more than enough complimentary sourdough bread.\n\nThe crab & shrimp sandwich was a little too bland for my taste though.  I think it needed a little more flavor to it.  Perhaps salt?  \n\nOur server was a sweetheart.  Kept checking up on us and he looked like Liam Hemsworth.

Our party ordered various items from a seafood variety plate to sliders, curry shrimp, calamari, oysters, crab, and fish. Everything got rave reviews. The pasta dishes were good too, but definitely not at the same level as the rest of the food.\n\nOne star off due to the service being extremely slow. The restaurant was very busy but so are a lot of restaurants around the area and they manage to get people in and out in a timely manner. We were there for about 2 hours and didn't even order dessert. Well worth the wait though.", "author": "Honest R."}

My family and I dined on a weeknight, nice crowd...but we were seated right away.  We chose the famous Clam Chowder w/crab as our starter and oh boy did it live up to the hype! Amazing clams and full of crab! It does not disappoint! \nWe ordered our entrees. Seafood platter for one, Choppino, Crab cakes, Shrimp po' boy and Seafood Penne. Everything was seasoned to perfection and nicely portioned.  Ok so here's the really good part, we noticed that there is a photo shoot behind us, they were taking pictures of this fabulous seafood tower. The manager walks up to our table and says, hey they're almost finished, the platter hasn't been touched would you guys like to have it? Wha??? Of course we would! From Dungeness Crab, Shrimp to Lobster claws! It was perfect! What a wonderful experience! We loved the food and the hospitality at Fog Harbor.

The lobster was cooked perfectly with the welcomed addition of crab to give two distinct flavours. The crab cakes were seasoned well, had a nice crunch to the shell and were a good size for the money.

For while they might have nice presentation they have nothing forcing them to make an exceptional product. \n\nAfter waiting 30 minutes we were brought to a very nice dinning room area that overlooked the water. Ordering the calamari to start with a coupon that is provided by the visitors center and to eat my son got the Mac and cheese, my wife got a custom designed linguine with garlic crab dish and I ordered the crab ceviche (avocado, mango and fresh pulled crab meat).\n\nThe calamari came and I was worried about the other items we ordered. It was not awful, but tasted like any other frozen squid with breading and very little seasoning which was a little over fried. I even sampled the \"aioli\" which is really become just a new way for a restaurant to put mayo in a ramekin and call it something cooler. That being said it did not help much and I was not looking forward to the meal.\n\nThen the waitress came with a basket filled with sourdough bread and it was exceptional. Did not ask for it, but the timing was perfect and just as we enjoyed our first piece the good bread... The food arrived-\n\nMy ceviche was amazing! The quality of the seafood is evident on the first bite and I felt like the combination of flavors that was more than I expected. The avocado was very flavorful and the mango was such a mild taste that all together it was a perfect mix. I cannot say anything bad about this dish except it was an appetizer and wish I ordered two.\n\nThe linguine was cooked with garlic, sun dried tomatoes, spinach and garlic crab meat. It was actually from the chicken penne pasta sub crab and linguine. This was a great way to try some fresh crab meat and the way it was pulled and placed on top of the pasta you could have some crab in every bite. The sun dried tomatoes played a great supporting role of adding color and a great finish to every few bites that were lucky enough to have some in it.\n\nLastly was my sons Mac and cheese. I never find it worthy of saying much about kid items, but this macaroni and cheese was gourmet and the steamed broccoli about as fresh tasting as can be.\n\nThis was a great final bite on our visit to San Fran! We will be back!!!", "author": "Vincent V."}

Fog Harbor was listed on my parking garage ticket for validation and 2 hours of parking for free. I had a dozen choices to choose from and, have to admit, Fog Harbor was the first place I walked up to. And from that point forward I was just amazed. Walked up the stairs to a very elegant and inviting establishment. The hostess smiled and was very courteous. I sat a little bit before heading in to sit at the bar to eat where I found more friendly and smiling bartenders. \n\nThat's where I learned about \"Carl's Fog\" that rolled in at sunset. \n\nOrdered my favorite Patron margarita with a splash of pineapple juice (no salt) and wasn't disappointed. Kind of odd that it was served in a tall pilsner glass but, hey, it was super tasty so I didn't question it. While in San Fran one must sample the clam chowder which I did in their sourdough bread bowl. Along with a shrimp cocktail and another margarita I was thoroughly enjoying the first portions of my dinner.\n\nThe only negative was that my main course came out in the middle of me eating the soup and shrimp. I told them to bring it back out when I call for it. When I did call for it I was pleased to find my linguine in clam sauce was very warm and fresh. And it was fantastic. I kept some of the sourdough bread from my bread bowl and used that for the meal along with the small piece of bread that came with it. \n\nI, normally, do not eat dessert when I go out to eat but I thought, what the heck, the meal was amazing so far why stop so I ordered the raspberry and apple crisp with vanilla ice cream.

I had the shrimp, it had some fancy name that I don't remember but I know it was on a skewer.  And there were mashed potatoes too.  The portions seemed generous, and although the prices were somewhat high, the quality of the food was quite good.  I almost forgot about the clam chowder!  The menu says it is the best but then I asked the waiter and he said \"perhaps second best.\"  Without attempting to rank, I would say the clam chowder is good but perhaps not worth the $6 a bowl.

I am a service business owner always observing hospitality at other businesses. We dropped off a friend at the airport and because of a horrible accident, the traffic was grid locked. We decided to stop at pier 39 for dinner not knowing where we were going to eat. My daughter frequently visits SF and had never been to this restaurant before, the wait was about 10 minutes. By the time we ordered wine at the bar they were seating us. That sat us at a window where the sun was shining in but the view was amazing. As we sat for a moment, it started getting hot and we asked to be moved. They said we could sit at another table but I really liked where we were sitting. I, always feeling on the warmer side, was noticeably hot and the waiter, Michael, asked if I wanted the window open. I felt instantly better. He was so accommodating and knowledgeable. \nOur food was so amazing. Clam chowder add crab was so delicious. And we had the fried scallops. Mmmmmmmm. For main meals. My daughter had the Pacific Cod, so flavorful and I had the ribeye that was so darn good and also so so flavorful. The seasoning was indescribable. I chose not to have it blackened. \nService was impeccable from the hostess, bar tender and manager. They were just bending over backwards for us and we just felt extra special. \nMy steak was s bit undercooked but they willing make me a whole new one or take it off my bill. I was full already and said it was ok and would take my undercooked steak to go. When they brought me my food to go, I noticed they made me a whole new one. The reason that this so long is I can't even explain all great experience that we had. \nMichael, our server was so nice and accommodating and not tried to rush us. Anyway.

I read the online reviews and thought this restaurant is worth for a try. \n\nWhen I arrived the restaurant, I was asked to wait for my seats while there are plenty empty tables in the restaurant. It is ok. After waiting for the like 30 mins, we were greed and bought to a table with window view. However, it was the time for a sunset. Their blind could not block any of the sunlight. My eye was directly tortured by the sunset. I was hardly seeing anything after I was seated. Fine. It is nothing the restaurant that could control.\n\nAfter waiting for over 30 mins, there was NO service provided. No water or anything. I was dumped at the table with a menu that I have read over and over during my waiting time. \n\nWhen the server came, she did not even bother to explain the menu and introduce the daily special items. OK. I ordered what I wanted from the menu. Then the server asked if I wanted to have the crab shell off. I was like, why not. The sad thing is, when I get the bill later, a $4 service charge was charged to getting the crab shell off! $4 is nothing, but it has to be communicated to customers when the server proposed that service. I have the right to refuse paying this charge. I was totally blindsided!\n\nFine. Only $4 bucks. If they do a proper job, I don't care. But the fact is, they make the crabs like shit. It has no favor. It served as tiny little pieces just like piece of crap. I could not tell those are crab meat at all!\n\nTo me, it is totally unacceptable for a restaurant specialized in seafood. \n\nWhen the food came to the table, I told the serve that I will be sharing the food with my friends. Everything ordered will be shared. The server just left, without giving us dinning plates and utensils for two people! The sad thing is the serve then left to nowhere. We could not find anyone that we could get extra utensils! The restaurant floor was totally empty!!\n\nWe ended up have to take turns to eat and share the utensils!\n\nNot to mention, there is no one refilling water for the entire evening!\n\n\nOn the food, it is disappointing.

There is really no skill to serving an oyster.\n\n- bowl of clam chowder: under seasoned and served luke-warm.  \n\n- salad wedge: sent back but still got charged. Literally a non-rinsed, right out of the shrink wrap, warm, wilted, bargain bin, iceberg lettuce. 1/2 of a cherry tomato. And barely enough blue cheese dressing. Maybe a tsp portion. Careless preparation. The dressing was barely that, it was very pasty. \n\n- garlic dungeoness crab: served luke-warm and over-cooked ! Ton of garlic, under seasoned. not a pinch of salt. The meat was dry inside and crumbled out. We spent 42 dollars for this garbage! We left 1/2 of it.\n\n- chiapino: this was ok, but still served Luke-warm and under seasoned. The broth was bland. It was more of a boring tomato soup with garlic powder, and a pinch of red pepper. The fish inside was ok, but there just wasn't enough. There was some good vegetables inside too. This was nowhere close to a great chiapino. This was just average. I can get way better in chi-town.\n\n- house cab: 14 dollars a glass  for what tastes like and probably is Barefoot brand.\n\nI would have sent most of this back and walked out, but I didn't want to make a scene. \nHopefully this review is seen by people who know food. \n\nUpdate:\nThe manager reached out to me to get feedback.\nHe was polite and seemed to care.\nI added two additional stars", "author": "Aric L."}

It was my mother's last day visiting me in the city so I took her to the most touristy spot in SF, and treated her to a nice dinner out. We got a whole crab and chowder in the bread bowl to share. The waiter was good about bringing us two of everything (soup soon, crab bibs, little crab clamps) so we could really share the food. It was so much food! We barely finished and had to waddle out of the restaurant because we were so full. The chowder was chock-full of clams, which is always a plus in my book. Apart from the good seafood, the view is hard to beat. We didn't get to sit right next to the window but were still able to see the beautiful sunset while we ate. All in all, it's worthwhile to come here at least once, and a perfect place to take someone who is visiting SF. It is expensive though, so I wouldn't come here just for chowder unless it was for something special like a last meal in SF for my mom!", "author": "Emily H."}

My service however was very disappointing. I waited at least 15 minutes before I was given a menu, then the waitress who seemed annoyed at something else had an attitude.

Service was good, and when we asked for desserts, they came out with a tray of desserts (which I've never seen before). We got the creme brulee, which is never disappointing because creme brulee is so good. Bill was around $100 plus tip (boys and girls, if your server does a good job, make sure you tip accordingly!).

We shared the blue cheese garlic bread starter, and it may have been because we were so hungry but the both of us were stopped in our tracks by the deliciousness (at this point I remarked \"Don't come here on a date\"... Bad breath for DAYS but totally worth it). I ordered the sustainably harvested swordfish and mom had the grilled chicken. I'd never tried swordfish before but I am certainly a convert. Grilled to perfection atop a bed of roasted potatoes and vegetables, I didn't want it to end. But I also didn't want to miss out on dessert.

My glass of riesling was a bit on the skimpy side though.  My husband's clam chowder soup and crab roll were delicious as well.  My son's mac and cheese consisted of very-overcooked pasta (and I usually like \"overcooked\" pasta) with way too much butter, which completely seeped out and puddled when I opened the leftovers box the next day.  And although the sourdough bread that they served was hot and fresh with a nice crusty exterior and great flavor, I have to say that they completely squish their bread by cutting it wrong. Whoever is cutting it needs to learn 1) use a serrated knife and 2) saw back and forth.  Otherwise you are killing the good efforts of the baker to make great bread.\n\nOverall, not bad.

I didn't have to worry about annoying others who were on very romantic dates. The food was INCREDIBLE and the service was stellar. We were so comfortable and it didn't even feel like we were near the crowds outside. We watched the fog roll in on the golden gate, and all of us were fully satisfied with the food. Thank you!

My mother and I ordered the seafood platter for a two and though the portion was plentiful enough for us some of the shellfish on the platter did not seem very fresh. I was also disappointed with the serving size of clam chowder that comes in the bread bowl. You are better off getting a cup of it without the bread bowl. The meals come with complimentary sourdough anyways. Normally you get what you pay for but not here.", "author": "Suzanne M."}

After driving 2 hours to come to dinner here with my son, I was greeted by the worst hostess ever. The first thing I asked for was a table by the window. It was a slow night, lots of available seating near the massive Windows, I thought to myself, SCORE! Dining with a view tonight. What I got was totally opposite of that! Readers discretion, I did have my toddler with me, who by the way was actually a saint tonight, even though, I thought a slow night, not a lot of stuck up kid hating people, shouldn't be too bad. Well... Too bad so Sad. Here's what happened: So we first get sat in a booth facing the window. The hostess must of not had a lot of experience with children because as she walked off, I had to call her back and ask for a high chair, she looked at me with puzzlement and semi annoyance, and says: \"well you can sit here with a high chair?!\"...DUH!! I could have told her that. So, naturally I think, well they're a couple 2 and 4 tops (tables) in plain site next to the window where we can replace a chair with a high chair, no problem! Think again, she sticks me in the far back of the restaurant, farthest away from the window!! WTF!! By this point, my own enjoyment was out of the question, I have to feed my kid and I'm starving, not worth the fight anymore because this \"hostess\" was obviously discriminatory towards anyone with a kid , and or was just plain clueless about what she was suppose to do. \nFood was ok, had the Salmon BLT, which was cooked well. I was looking forward to desert, but the waitress either got busy or was tired of dealing with a quiet table and just dropped off the check. All the while, I saw her offer Desert to the other tables in her section. Apparently my money is not good enough for this restaurant.  \n\nIf you're looking at this restaurant as a possible place for a great dining experience with excellent service and is family friendly...skip it. Go to the restaurant in the front of the wharf.  Or take a short trip to SCOMA's or Woodhouse fish co. Both are fantastic! Great service and food.\n\nDear management, please train your hostesses to care and show them how to seat your patrons, I saw another lady actually throw a fit and ask to speak with a manager because of said hostesses tonight.. Seems like I wasn't the only one tonight .  Please don't waste your time or money here.", "author": "Clifford C."}

Creamy, thick, but not too thick, decent proportion of clams without any sand (as it should be!).   That was all we ate, but we did have a few drinks as Jason was hard at work answering all our curiosities. He got our drift and noticed we were the typical \"on the cocktail list\" drinkers and made a bomb Manhattan (with the best whiskey soaked black cherries) and orange citrus old fashion.

We asked to sit near the window and they were able to place us near the window. Loved the view of the pier/ocean/alcatraz. Restaurant is very nice and looks elegant.The girl that greeted us at the front door was nice. Our server was a sweetheart. She has a very cute accent. We ordered 2 cups of clam chowder. It was okay. It had a lot of big clams, very thick and creamy but tasted bland. The sourdough bread they provide was delish. Our favorite was the baked oyster with parmesan and sprinkled bacon. It was so good and addicting. My husband ordered the fried combo which came with the fried shrimp, calamari and fish and fries and coleslaw. We both liked the calamari a lot. I ordered the Pacific sole with fingerling potatoes. I didn't like it at all. It had no taste. My Pinot Grigio from Lane CA was good. Wished they had more wine choices by the glass. Husband had a Coke to drink. Our parking lot ticket got validated which was nice. Bill came out to about $85 which I don't think this place is a $$..more like a $$$ & this was lunch time.", "author": "Sara L."}

Sat at the bar and were dished up great service and food. Their clam chowder is on point. Of course, I wouldn't expect anything less given Fog's location and the area's claim to fame.

Around 9pm on a Saturday night, we ended up waiting a little under 30 minutes for a table. Service was great; from the hostess to our server. On to the most important part and the reason why you're reading this review... The food: \n\n- Oysters: Fresh. Fresh. Fresh. I am not the biggest fan of oysters, but I had to try them. They are the cleanest oysters I've ever tasted. I could've eaten half a dozen by myself.\n\n- Ahi Tuna Poke: Decent size chunks with avocado and I believe it was mango as well? The Sriracha drizzled around the plate adds a kick of spice if that's what you're looking for. Down side to this plate was that there was only 3 wonton chips to share! \n\n- Clam Chowder: You can't come to SF and not have a bowl of clam chowder. You won't regret it! So rich and creamy, you can actually tell that there are clams in there! (Also had clam chowder from Nick's Lighthouse... Fog Harbor blows them out of the water) \n\n- Garlic Roasted Dungeness Crab: YUMMY. So glad we went with this over the steamed dungeness. It had so much more flavor to it and was way more juicy than we expected, which is a definitely plus. (Tip: Dip the corn into the garlic/butter... Also, if you prefer mashed potatoes to the fingerling potatoes, just ask your server to substitute it for you)\n\nOverall, we had a great experience. We also ordered 2 drinks from the bar to go with our meal which brought our grand total to ~$108 (excluding tip). Will definitely be back again!", "author": "Elizabeth N."}

There was so much on the menu it was hard to decide LOL. I ended up ordering the Fried Combo (fish, calamari, shrimp, fries, cole slaw). Everything was delicious, and it's a big dish. My partner ordered the Cioppino, which was truly amazing. So good! I wish I had ordered it also. We ordered 2 cocktails each but maybe we're raging alcoholics because we thought they needed more alcohol LOL. Next time we'll order wine instead. \n\nAnd yes we'll definitely be back.

Overall, very high marks. First, the view is lovely, and the restaurant itself is very nice and well-appointed. A nice place for a relaxed lunch, date night or a special occasion. Second, the food:\n-I ordered the ginger coconut cocktail, which was generally very good and tasty, but I felt had a bit too much coconut. It was kind of offputting in mouthfeel but did have a delightful ginger/lemon/spritzer type of flavor. I was torn between loving it and hating it and in the end only drank about half.\n-The chowder. Oh my god, get some.Some of the best chowder you will ever have. Thick, creamy, silky, delicious. Think cup, but go bowl. You're welcome.\n-Poke. I do love tuna, so poke is a tough thing to ignore on a menu that isn't in Hawaii. This particular poke is mixed with fresh avocado and mango, with a small amount of seaweed like you'd find in a seaweed salad. Light, gingery, soy-ey (??) and really yum.\n-Salmon. I got the salmon entree, which was just delicious. Cooked perfectly, with a med-rare center and beautiful grill marks on the outside, set over a creamy sauce with spinach and potatoes. A beautiful piece of fish and a huge portion!\n-Tuna -- perfectly cooked again with a nice big rare center. Served over a great hash-like mix that included these delightful bits of bok choy. SUPER yum.\n\n\nIn all the food was really excellent. We didn't have time for dessert. Our server was good, helpful and composed.

Get a table further inside if you can; you'll have a nice view next to the water.\n\nMy family and I came here for dinner and we had a good time. We started off with complimentary sourdough bread and a calamari appetizer as well as clam chowder. A trip to SF isn't complete without some clam chowder! The bread had a wonderful crunchy texture and the clam chowder was delicious without being too heavy.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered swordfish while the rest of my family ordered ahi tuna and the seafood spaghetti. While the food was a little on the salty side, it was pretty good. I actually liked the swordfish the least out of all the entrees because it was rather dry. The tuna was surprisingly generous in portion and I liked this entree the most. The seafood spaghetti was pretty good too, and that's coming from someone who typically doesn't like seafood. I tried their rose wine soda, which was non-alcoholic. It was yummy! It just tastes like a light fizzy soda, haha. They should just call it grape soda, but I guess they just want to make it sound fancy.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend this place if you're in the area and looking for a nice sit-down restaurant.", "author": "Michelle N."}

We had a waitress who was helpful at first until I asked how much the \"Surf Turf\" was because it had said market price. She then sarcastically suggested the Lobster Tail which was \"only $39\". After that, she passed us off to another waiter who told us he was taking over for her because \"her shift was over\". Yet, we kept seeing her help the table behind us (loaded 60+ yr old guy with a very young wife/gf and small child) and another new table that was seated. \n\nSo we ask our new waiter, \"hey, I thought her shift was over\". Then he told us without telling us that she passed us off to him because she assumed we didn't have money because I asked how much the surf turf was. It was obvious and plain as day. When she brought our appetizer out (oysters and shrimp) she didn't prep it like she did the other two tables (and this was right after I had asked about the market price item and the last time she talked to us/came over to our table).\n\nFor the price, I've had better seafood. This place is slightly overpriced but the food was alright. So if you want average seafood that's a little overpriced then this place is okay. The view from inside the restaurant is nice too. But that waitress should know that just because someone is Black and just because they ask about price does not mean they don't have money for the food or to give you a generous tip afterwards. You missed out.\n\nFor a liberal place, San Francisco has a lot of hidden and subtle racism. Was not surprised that the only Blacks in the restaurant was seated right next to the camera (pointing down at our table and next to the waiters/waitresses register) and was passed off because it was assumed we had no money because I asked about a price. Our new waiter enjoyed his 30% tip and I hope he told the chick about that (who would probably do anything if you threw enough money at her tbh...was one of those vibes...especially with the way she was all over the loaded old dude next to us). And it is disappointing that this happened because I overall had a nice trip to San Francisco and we were served great at Everett & Jones in Oakland the night before. But Fog Harbor won't be seeing my business again. I'll check out the numerous other seafood choices around there when I make a roadtrip to SF from LA again rather than come back to this place.", "author": "Nial E."}

My friends and I were lucky and got seated right next to the huge windows with a great view of the water. The inside is dimly lit and would be great for a romantic, fancy dinner. I loved the ambience and the fact that it's on the water and as my friend said, I suppose you're paying for the view as well as the food, which is why it's pricier.\n\nApparently their clam chowder is very good, and I almost ordered it but instead, I went with the curry mussels, my favorite seafood. The mussels were really soft and soaked in the delicious curry sauce. I was relieved that the curry wasn't spicy at all, although it had a nice small kick to it and was slightly sweet and creamy. I really liked the sauce and I also dipped the complementary bread they serve into the sauce. The amount of mussels they served in the bowl was worth the price, especially for a fancy place.\n\nService was okay, nothing bad but nothing stood out either. I would like to come here again sometime though, for both the food and view!", "author": "Kailin H."}

Fog Harbor took us in as walk-ins and once they found out it was our anniversary they gave us the best table in the house, a corner where we could see out onto the water in 2 directions. Our waiter (MEL 382) was very polite and conscientious of our special day and we were treated like royalty. The prices were very reasonable for the freshness and quality of the food; we purchased two clam chowder bowls in fresh house-baked sourdough bowls at $10 each (very reasonable) and shared a plate of fish and chip so fresh the fish could have leaped from the Bay into the pan just minutes before it arrived at our table. The clam chowder was not too thick and perfectly balanced; you could taste the different elements, clams were soft as butter. We wrapped it up with a fine dessert of chocolate chip & walnut cake with wonderfully dense ice-cream on top. The whole time we looked at the water and fishing boats and enjoyed the warmth of the restaurant. \n\nThe only problem with a dinner like this is that every other meal we've eaten out now seems lesser by comparison. We can't wait to go back and experience another dinner at this establishment.", "author": "Steven S."}

Male host at the host stand was less-than-inviting in his facial expressions and interactions with our party and other guests, but the food and service we had later more than made up for his lack of hospitality. Our walk to the table showed just how big the restaurant is and how great the view we had of the Pier 39 area.\n\nDue to the wait for the table, we were able to peruse the menu prior to getting our table. We both eyed the Fried Combo (fish, shrimp, calamari with fries and slaw) priced at $22. We expected the high price due to the touristy nature of the area, but the price felt more deserving once we received our food (which was very quick considering the lunch rush). The portions were HUGE! We both ended up taking half back to the hotel due to being stuffed after eating. We really wanted to try the dessert duo (creme brulee and chocolate cake priced at $14), but we were too full. Maybe next time.\n\nThe highlight of the meal, though, had to be the phenomenal service we experienced with our server Madison. As I mentioned earlier, we weren't the most hopeful after our interactions with the host, but Madison went above-and-beyond in answering any questions we had and ensuring we had an amazing experience. Her warm and inviting personality made our lunch one to remember. Her service was top-notch, and I will definitely ask to be in her section the next time we eat there. \n\nThis is a great restaurant in an excellent location with awesome service and huge portions.

Located right at the pier's edge and where a lot of the Blue and Gold Fleet cruises dock.\n\nCrab? Check! A whole menu entirely dedicated to the local Dungeness crab. Fresh and a multitude of preparations, making it very hard for us to choose a single dish.\n\nJoe and I were in the noshing mood, planning to go to Fisherman's Wharf for dinner (post to come!). We shared the 1/2 lb crab, stir fried with onions, peppers, in a spicy red chili garlic sauce. NOM! Turned out a lot better than I thought it would be. The shell was super soft, making it pretty easy to crack even without the crab cracker, and the garlic sauce was nice and spicy! The highlight of the dish: the fresh crab meat waiting inside the shell. Sweet and juicy. Should have ordered a second crab dish in my opinion!\n\nOur other dish: an ahi tuna poke. After having amazing poke in LA, we've been looking around for a good poke. A trip to Hawaii next perhaps? Anyways, the dish was beautifully presented with crispy wonton chips with white and black sesame seeds, a wasabi aioli, an unidentified hot sauce, seaweed, and the ahi tuna marinated in a sesame soy sauce with avocados and mango. Yum! The mango made the dish it's own and added to the refreshing taste.

Our waitress was a bit surly and seemed like she would rather be helping any other table but ours (could be due to having 2 teenagers with us). \n\nI ordered clam chowder to start and after a taste of sand and grit, sent it back. The daughter had seared ahi and loved it, I had a combination platter that had salmon, mahi-mahi and shrimp. It came with mashed potatoes and green beans. The fish was cooked perfectly, but the cook seasoned everything with cayenne pepper. Since another in our party had the same dish (hers with garlic fries), and the fish on her plate was without this seasoning I asked the waitress if mine was a mistake (I am not the too spicy fan), the manager came over right away and claimed my dish was made with the pepper by mistake. \n\nI really appreciated the kindess of the manager (who also comped our desserts), the really good cosmo I had and the company I was with.

The overall atmosphere in the restaurant is pleasant and the view is amazing. For a party of three on a Sunday, the wait was minimal which was a plus. \n\nFor the food, my table ordered the seafood cioppino, seafood penne, fried calamari appetizer and the Moscow mule. Seafood cioppino was above average. More of a soupy tomato cioppino vs a stew like many places. Generous helpings of properly cooked mussels, clams, crab, scallops, shrimp and fish. Just wish the flavor was a bit stronger instead of resembling a tomato based seafood linguine. I'd say sotto mare was better. The seafood penne was very well done. Fish was perfectly cooked and the sauce was perfect, paired extremely well with the sourdough bread which was some of the best I've ever had. Soft center and flaky crust with chew. The calamari was well fried and flavorful, but the lemon aioli was very plain. The Moscow mule was watered down like crazy and might as well have been ginger ale mixed with water. \n\nThe service for this restaurant was disappointing considering its a tourist trap. My server failed to give me plate/silverware, bread and water refills requires multiple requests and drink came 15 minutes late. Expected a lot more and there wasn't even an apology for lack of plate and utensils. \n\nI would probably not return based on the overall dining experience but the food was definitely some of the best of pier 39.", "author": "Matt P."}

We started with fresh west coast oysters and found them to be as good as any we ever had from the east coast, which we generally prefer. The Seafood Penne I ordered was rich and flavorful and included ample portions of delicious fish and shellfish, all of which were fresh and tasty. The Sole which my wife ordered was plentiful and wonderful and also as fresh as it could be.

The ahi was underwhelming: quite bland, in part I'm sure because it was overcooked. To be fair, the presentation of the fish was pretty well done (heh). It was dressed with what I'm assuming was supposed to be a wasabi paste which, though already weak, was completely overpowered by the pickled ginger  scattered liberally over the fish.\n\nIf I were to come here again, I'd give their \"higher end\" dishes a pass, I think, and go straight for the fish 'n chips, which looked much more promising once I'd seen it.\n\nIf you're a one-plate kind of eater, this can be a $$ restaurant; if you tend to get a starter *and* a main, like I generally do, you'll quickly find yourself in the $$$ range, especially when you add a few drinks to the equation.", "author": "Haak S."}

We ordered the crab cake and clam chowder in a bowl for appetizers. Crab cake was delicious but not work the $19 for only 1 crab cake. The chowder was also good. We then ordered the swordfish and shared. We were so full we couldn't finish everything! The swordfish was WAY too salty that I wanted to send it back but didn't. Also when you pay don't be alarmed that you are charged 6% or something for San Fransciso employees tax. Overall I would eat here again but would have sent back the fish because it was wayyy too salty. The only reason why we didn't was that we were short on time.", "author": "Jenny D."}

Our server was top notch and paid attention to detail and incredibly helpful and friendly. We made our reservation via Open Table and that made it easy to get a table but they also gave us a nice amuse bouche to start our dinner. The atmosphere is loud - lots of noise and clanging - so don't plan on an intimate dinner here. \n\nScott started with the Award Winning Clam Chowder. He rated the soup a three star and he is quite the clam chowder aficionado. We split the Beet & Blue Cheese Salad - red and golden beets, organic mixed greens tossed with blue cheese dressing topped with walnuts - which was utterly delicious.  The server had the kitchen split the salad which is a detail often missed. The hot from the oven sour dough bread was very tasty that came with our appetizers. As a side note, I wanted the grilled artichoke but the server said the item was not available. \n\nThe food fell to a low point with my entree the Salmon special. It was very dry and served on their mashed potatoes which appeared to be instant or potato pearls. It was not very tasty and I mostly just ate the vegetable on my plate. Scott had the Whole Dungeness Crab with a spicy Thai sauce. He loved this meal. The crab was cooked perfectly and the sauce, although messy, was really good. Had my seafood been as good as the crab I would have bumped them to a four star.\n\nA fun place to try if you are in the mood for a Pier 39 restaurant.", "author": "Wendi G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-07-08", "description": "Back in Maryland, where the Chespeake churns and the Old Bay Seasoning flows, the crustacean of the day is the blue crab. Here in San Francisco, the crab of choice is the stout Dungeness, a veritable wrestler versus the comparatively dainty, ballerina-esque blueies we have back where I'm from. Having had my fair share of crab in my life, devoured mostly with mallet and mini fork in hand mind you, I was ready to give the Dungeness a try.\n\nAfter a long day exploring Fisherman's Wharf, a nice plate of crab cakes, some fries, and slaw just felt right. The restaurant was quickly becoming crowded so I felt lucky that my two friends and I managed to snag a window table. Tired and hungry, we were all happy to be greeted by a basket of steaming hot San Francisco Sourdough and softened butter. I've always appreciated the tart bite and hearty crust of a good sourdough in sandwich service, so the pure unadulterated experience of quality bread led us off on a good start. Hey, it's the little things in life that count. Soon thereafter, our food came out. I was greeted by a surprisingly ordinary plate of two smallish pan fried crab cakes, fries, and slaw. Unfortunately, the \"ordinary\" aspect seemed to be a theme as I began to eat my dish. \n\nStrike one was that the crab cakes were merely warm and didn't seem terribly fresh. Furthermore, while I was hoping for delicious lumps of sweet crab, I instead got a pretty bland interior which tasted more of filler than crab. Whether or not it was indeed filler and breadcrumb I was tasting or it was the way the strangely finely minced crab was prepared that threw my tastebuds off is up for debate, but it was disappointing. While crisp on the outside, the inside was mushy and pasty. Luckily or not, since they were small, I didn't really have much to go through before it was gone. A truly great crab cake should highlight the quality and flavour of the crustacean that honorably served in its preparation, not of bread and onion. The fries were also a disappointment. While they were hot, they were devoid of seasoning. Unsalted fries are a sin! Why why why would you ever serve unsalted fries? Finally, the slaw and remoulade were inoffensive, which is to say, pretty unmemorable. \n\nMoving on to the service and space, I should first point out that getting to Fog Harbor can be a little tricky. You must access it from the upper balcony level of Pier 39. Once inside, you're greeted by a nice dining space. It's open, the servers are dressed professionally, and if you get a window seat, you will be greeted by a beautiful view of the bay. Service was also good. Our server was quick, friendly, and readily agreed to split our check. \n\nSo why the two stars? Well, while the service and space were very good overall, I was disappointed by the food. My dish was bland, uninspired, and got literally beat out by bread and butter. In addition, later that night, my stomach really did not agree with what I ate. Considering I ate toast for breakfast that day, I think my cakes are the guilty ones here. I hope that I maybe caught Fog Harbor on an off day since others seem to really like this place. Unfortunately for me, it just didn't hit the mark.", "author": "Philip T."}

The wait was minimal on a Thursday night in the summer, which was nice.\n\n2. The restaurant seems clean, upscale and has amazing views if you are willing to wait for them. \n\n3. The drinks were amazing. Mixed very well, creatively concocted and delicious. \n\nThe minuses:\n1.  VERY LOUD AND NOISY. There are way too many tables squeezed in the space available. Normally I wouldn't knock a place for this, but given everything else that was bad, I thought I'd list.\n\n2. The service. It is very apparent that each server has too many tables to handle. Service is extremely slow. We were told 4 times our oysters and crab cakes were on the way however the actual time to receive was approx. 30 minutes. If they sent actually on the way, just don't say it. Again, I wouldn't necessarily knock a place for this however the oysters are raw (easy to plate) and the crab cakes were obviously pre-made and just dropped into a fryer. Also, it would have been nice to get or even be offered bread, when everyone seem to have it. Lastly, when we tried to joke or have any conversation with put waitress at all, she immediately became defensive and didn't get the banter. \n\n3. The food. Crab stuff lobster ... Should include ... Lobster. Additionally the dish should not be sitting on top of boxed (at least that's what they tasted like) mashed potatoes. Or in my opinion not for $36 bucks. The swordfish had a very odd square shape, tasted at one point frozen and was dry. \n\nIf you're visiting, hungry and need a place to eat on the pier, choose someplace else.

Then get off and walk to the F Street car, pay $2.00.\nYour other option is to cab there for $12.50 each way.\n\nOn to Fog Harbor Fish House: \nGood value for large parties.\n\nWe did the prix fixe,  for starters every four people were served a platter of yummy calamari perfectly deep fried, cheese toast with fine blue cheese and a small plate of prawns sauteed in a spicy hot marinara (V. good). Next, you get a salad of a few leaves of high quality romaine lettuce with creamy blue cheese or, you can have a white clam chowder. The main entree is either salmon, new york steak, or braised chicken, comes with sauteed zucchini's and pearl onion. Mashed potato's and a dessert of lava cake or tiramisu. $38.00\n\nI had the NY steak, cooked medium, it was tastey, if a bit skinny at 1/2 inch thick cooked.  The excellent romaine salad comes with four pieces of lettuce with a creamy blue cheese dressing; it was perfection. The mashed potatoes and sauteed zucchini were ok.  \n\nFor dessert, I chose their lava cake: it was very chocolately,& moist n' sweet on the inside; it was served with a side of vanilla ice cream drizzled with more chocolate. A sprig of mint leaf added to the sensation.\n\nMy friend had the salmon and it looked phat, well over an inch, about 6 inches by 6 inches. She said it was delicious.\n\nTheir coffee was very good: black and delicious. \n\nDecent appetizers, entrees and desserts. I just figure you are paying a very reasonable $33.00 for the food and $5.00 for an excellent water front view, fine linen and silverware. I had to ask for my coffee to get refilled. Ditto for water.\n\nBathrooms: clean and modern.\n\nCustomer service: a bit slow.\n\nAmbience: very nice, trad. American.\n\nTip: from the BART at Embarcadero, walk upstairs and look for the train tracks and hop on the F Street Car, to Pier 39. Just $2.00\n\nTip: due to the deluge, we cabbed from Pier 39 to CalTrain at King/4th, it was $12.50 without tip.", "author": "Bert K."}

Many natives have told me that Pier 39 is overrated. I say this place certainly is not and may be slighly underrated. It met my expectations and at times exceeded! \n\nI took my girlfriend here and we both loved the place. We got a window seat that overlooked the bay and the golden gate bridge in the far back. The service was great and on top of that, we checked in to get free garlic bread. The staff are great and again, impeccable service when we were there in February.\n\nNow let's talk about the food. Their sourdough bread to start was perfect.  Definitely recommend the clam chowder IN a bread bowl, and the Crab was amazing. This place has some of the best seafood I've had at a reasonable price for the area. Oh and I forgot to mention their drink menu, amazing. They have amazing mixed drinks and wine selection. I personally even liked their \"fruity\" drinks that most describe as \"feminine\". \n\nDo yourself a favor and stop by this restaurant if you are looking to sit down and enjoy a nice meal whether alone or with company.", "author": "Steve X."}

LOL so we made sure to tip our servers even more. :)\n\nnotes: make sure your party is complete or they won't seat you! it's normally really packed around dinner time on the weekends (but surprisingly it wasn't for us on a friday night). your server will give you more biscoff cookies if you ask them to. it's definitely a nice restaurant to bring your date here, especially when the sun is about to set. though the noise level might be a bit too loud for you guys to hear each other talk.", "author": "Sylvia H."}

It has an excellent view of the harbor. Expect long wait (45-60 min) during rush hours. I would rate the price as $$$. A family of four can easily go upwards $100 plus. I would rate the food 3 to 4 star.  The linguine and clam pasta portion is on the smaller side.  The flavor is more on the mild side.  My wife actually makes a better seafood pasta. The crab and avocado salad I think you get a decent portion but at $27 I think you get the value. The drink was excellent especially strawberry nojitos. The service I would rate 4-5 star.  The complimentary bread is nice and you can fill on that if you do not mind the all the carbs. They are famous for the clam chowder which is very good. Love the bread bowl.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-11-10", "description": "Came here last week for dinner while entertaining an out of town visitor. Venue is nice - big and touristy. We started with the crab and risotto fritters. These were slightly disappointing, was hoping for crispy hot fritters and received this lukewarm, kind of soggy conglomeration of crab and risotto. Also got a moscow mule and bowl of cioppino - the moscow mule was standard (a little weak), and this was my first venture into ordering cioppino, after tasting others' at different restaurants and really liking it. This one was very solid in quantity of seafood, with lots of crab, scallops, shrimp, clams and mussels, which made it a delight to eat. However, I think the seafood might have been cooking a little too long, because the scallops were near disintegrating and the crab tasted straight up like the broth. So, the seafood was fresh and plentiful, but the seafood all tasted the same, as if it had been boiling in the broth together for a long time. Shrimp and mussels were the highlight, they seemed to be have cooked properly and still had some firmness. The broth was simple and tasted like tomato soup, though some salt and pepper brought out the flavors well. Also, wanted more than a small sliver of garlic bread! Waitstaff was friendly.\n\nOverall, very much enjoyed the meal, but there were a few things that stood out as pieces that could easily be improved upon.", "author": "Sarah B."}

You're paying for the view, the service, and a decently cleaned bathroom. \n\nMy date and I were seated at a table with the view of Alcatraz with a very friendly (and cute!) waiter. I wasn't extremely hungry, just tired and wanted a clean bathroom (which can be hard to find in the tourist zone), so Fog Harbor Fish House isn't a bad place to be at. \n\nI ordered the soup and salad combo for $14. Definitely not worth it, considering how I get the same stuff as I would at Boudin. Salad is better than Boudin's though, slightly larger portion and with fresher ingredients. I've experienced wilting lettuce at Boudin before. The clam chowder wasn't spectacular. That's probably because no clam chowder in the Bay Area can top the best chowder I've had at Seattle's Pike Place Market. The one here was very generic. I do love my breadbowl though. Yes, that was the deal with this combo, your breadbowl is at no extra cost. If you order a regular bowl of soup and a house salad, it'll just be $14 as well. \n\nMy date had this burger with fries, nothing too amazing. I didn't like their fries just because it was too bland. My date loved it though, he doesn't like his fries too salted. So that's just personal preference. \n\nTMI material, skip this paragraph if you need to. I wasn't sure if it's because I had coffee in the morning, or their food wasn't prepared well, I had a major stomach ache shortly after the meal. Another good reason to have a clean bathroom. \n\nInstead of giving you a dessert menu near the end, your waiter will carry a huge tray of desserts to tease you. They are at portions to share. All looking very rich, but I'm not sure how long they've been sitting out. Nonetheless, good tactic.", "author": "Connie C."}

The piece of salmon was decent and grilled well, but the rest of the salad was pretty bland with mostly green leafs and little else in the salad.

When we saw the menu had \"Award Winning Clam Chowder in a Sourdough Bread Bowl\", we immediately asked for a table. \n\nThe boyfriend and I split a Cioppino (delicious), my friend got a swordfish steak, and my boyfriend's friend got calamari. Everything was delicious but I think the clam chowder took the cake. It had big chunks of clam and the soup was the perfect consistency. I notice that a lot of other places put in too many potatoes in their chowder, but Fog Harbor doesn't overpower the chowder with too much. Bread bowl was amazing. My boyfriend is on a no simple carbs diet - but even he could not resist a freshly baked sourdough bread bowl. Crispy, just a little tart, and warm. Hrmm. \n\nPrices are reasonable. Food was delicious. Service was awesome. Would definitely come here again.", "author": "Sonia Y."}

I got the clam chowder in the bread bowl for my entree and I was expecting a mind blowing experience but it lacked in flavor...maybe I expected too much because they claimed to be \"the best in San Francisco.\" The bread was AMAZING though.

We came here for Dine About Town 2014 and made reservations about a week in advance to secure a spot for dinner. We had parked in the Pier 39 garage where Fog Harbor would validate 2 hours of parking when after 6pm. We came here on a Saturday night and boy, the whole restaurant was packed! There were even people waiting for seats. When you first enter Fog Harbor, you'll notice that they have a really cozy fireplace area for those who are waiting. We were seated in one of the booths near the window with a nice view of the bay. I wish we came a bit earlier when the sun was setting though.\n\nFood-\nRed Curry Steamed Mussels: The PEI mussels were steamed in garlic, onions, peppers, and a coconut curry broth. The coconut curry broth was not too flavorful. I could barely taste the curry flavor. However, these mussels were REALLY fresh. YUM. Definitely, the freshest mussels I have had compared to all the other restaurants I've been to.\n\nSeafood Cioppino: The cioppino comes with crab, salmon, shrimp, clams, scallops, and mussels stewed in a tomato herb broth with pasta. What I thought was really cute was that Fog Harbor provides you bibs so you won't get food on yourself! A plus for me since I can be a pretty messy eater when it comes to seafood. The tomato herb broth was really flavorful. I ended up taking the complimentary bread and dipped it into the broth. So delicious. My cioppino came with 3 pieces of crab, a good amount of salmon, shrimp, clams, scallops, and mussels. All the seafood were really fresh and in good quality. There's no fishy taste to them. My seafood cioppino also comes with pasta too. Originally, they had forgotten to include it into the dish, but the manager on duty quickly apologized and provided me a bowl of the pasta. Regardless, the seafood cioppino has really BIG portions. They are not skimpy with their seafood. \n\nMolten Chocolate Cake: The cake was served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. The cake was REALLY sweet. The ice cream definitely complemented well with the chocolate cake. Unfortunately, the cake didn't have any melted chocolate in it when I cut it open in half. :( \n\nOur dinner lasted for almost 2 hours! That was pretty surprising but in a good way. :) At the end of the meal, they also provide you Biscoff cookies. Per our waiter, he stated that they are quite delicious when dipped in coffee or milk. The overall service was excellent. The waiter and the manager on duty really made sure that everything was going smoothly and checked up on us.

What happened today was I planned on having a nice relaxing meal with a friend here that just went downhill. We arrived and were seated at 4pm. The waiter took our order within 15 minutes. No complementary sourdough bread was given until 20 minutes later after 4pm. Our food did not arrive until 4:45pm. When our food finally arrived, my friend asked the waiter and manager why there was such a long wait for our food. They looked the other way, ignored us like we did not say anything and gave us our meal which was very lackluster in portion and taste (I had burnt skewered shrimp that had pure char on one side turned upside down so I wouldn't notice it at first) and it was upsetting that they did not apologize or even acknowledge the long wait we had, the manager instead gave us a 20% off of our bill while he kept insisting that the food only took 10 to 12 minutes to cook, yet my friend and I saw other non minority people get their food first who arrived and were seated after us. \n\nAll in all, don't go to this place expecting to be treated fairly if you aren't white.

Arrived around 530pm so we could sit at the bar first and have a couple happy hour drinks. There was a heat wave in sf, and this place was insanely sweaty hot. As I sat at the bar sucking down a cold drink, I looked around at the people sitting at the window seats, where I was going to be sitting soon, to see them all using their napkins to wipe the sweat off their forehead. Nightmare status. NO AC! \nThis was a dinner for my birthday, and I was hoping to not have to rush through it just to get outside for some fresh air. \nBartender was super nice, don't remember his name, but when we told him we were gonna go get seated so we wanted to pay for the tab, he offered to make us another round of drinks and bring to our table at the happy hour price (which was about $5 cheaper). Awesome. \nTold the hostess I would rather die than sit at one of those window seats where the other customers were stewing in their own sweat. So she sat us in this room off to the side of the main dining room, right next to a window that just wasn't in the sun and the window was propped open a bit. Perfect spot!!!!! So thank you so much for being accommodating!\n\nNow for the food!\nStarted with the calamari, lightly battered/fried rings, a nice lemon aoli type dip (very light). \nChili shrimp - woah. SOO good! Spicy! But flavorful!! Used the fresh sourdough bread they give you complimentary to dip in this spicy broth \n1/2 garlic crab - good garlic flavor! Tender meat, have to crack it yourself  \nDungeonous crab cocktail - decent portion of shredded tender crab meat served over ice with cocktail sauce on the side. \nThink that was enough? No. \nDinner was a whole Maine lobster with a side of mashed potatoes and a grilled corn on the cob. The lobsters tail was over cooked and chewy, but the claws were tender. Kinda sad about the lobster tail, but I guess that happens when you get a whole lobster? \n\nDessert was complimentary cause it was my birthday, I was just brought out a dessert the waiter, Rudy picked. It was some sort of warm chocolate rich almost lava melty cake with vanilla ice cream and house made whip cream. Really decadent. \n\nGood service, lovely ambiance, and fresh seafood. Fun birthday dinner ;)\nThanks Fog Harbor!", "author": "Sarah U."}

Methinks not\" definitely sums it up...\n\nThe in-laws took my husband and me here for his birthday since he wanted seafood at Pier 39 and Fog Harbor had the best Yelp reviews...this is the first time Yelp has steered us oh so very wrong.\n\nAs far as the service goes, they started out on the right foot by saying the wait for a table was 45 minutes to an hour and we were seated in 30...it's all downhill from there. For being a busy Saturday night, none of the wait staff had any sense of urgency; the speed with which they walked was like they were window shopping at a mall. The 20 minute wait for water and the 90 minutes we waited for our dinner were testament to that. Also, the waitress was really inefficient and/or did not have a good memory. Any time I eat out I like to ask for anything we need all at once so the waiter/waitress doesn't have to make several trips...our waitress literally brought us one item at a time. Her favorite line was \"I'll be right back with that;\" yeah, you'll be back in another 10 minutes. Perfect example: the food had finally come out and we asked for drink refills (water, hot water with lemon, and coffee), ketchup, and a crab cracker (which, for some reason, didn't come out with the plate)...3 trips and 20 minutes later, we had everything but the ketchup. It took her so long to bring the cracker for the crab that my mother-in-law ordered that she started breaking into it with her hands, and I never did get ketchup for my fries. Our table did have a nice view, but one of the staff opened the window shade too early and it blinded my father-in-law. He asked if he could lower it again and the guys response was, \"It'll just be bright for a couple of minutes\" and then walked away. Pretty much all the guests had the same response to the bright light, so a manager lowered them, saying rudely it would just be another 30 seconds and it should have been fine, then proceeded to stand near the table while keeping an eye on his watch. The same guy as the first time came around to open the blinds again and was making rude comments as he worked.\n\nMoving on to the food, I'll start with the good...the clam chowder, shrimp, clams, mussels, and whole crab were actually tasty. Not worth the price-tag they slapped on it, but at least tasty. The calamari was ok, kinda chewy, honestly the lemon aioli it came with was the best part. The salmon and swordfish were overcooked, dry, and bland and all of the vegetables that came on the sides were undercooked (seriously, undercooked fingerling potatoes?) except the spinach, which was overcooked. I ordered the crab roll (sandwich) and the best part about it was the bread, which was a good thing since there was a lot of it.\n\nJust considering the food and service we had while dining here, none of us would rate Fog Harbor very highly...once you throw in the $180 we spent for this lovely experience, we will not only never go back, but would recommend everyone to eat anywhere but here.", "author": "Jennifer G."}

The crab cake fritters were amazing as well. It was so much food so we shared the fish and chips. Fries were good, but the fish was underwhelming.

We were seated by our sever John who was probably one of the best severs we've ever had! He was professional, sweet and helped us pick out something for appetizers since we both couldn't decide. I ordered the garlic roasted Dungeness crab (it was crab season) and I don't quite remember what my boyfriend had to eat but it seemed like a fried seafood platter of some sort. The garlic crab was SOOO good and it was big enough to satisfy me even with how hungry I was. Unlike other restaurants the garlic flavor could actually be identified while eating the crab meat and not just laying around on the shell. My boyfriend loved his entire plate and finished every bite. For drinks since neither of us are 21 yet, we had the iced tea and the ginger lemonade. OMG I wish I could have that ginger lemonade right now, it was quite strong but combined with the mint and lemon it was a perfect drink paired with the strong garlicy crab. For appetizers my boyfriend ordered the fried calamari since I had never tried it before. It was pretty good even though I know for some people it's an acquired taste but I liked it as soon as I got over the texture :p All in all we had a terrific upscale experience even during lunch hours and customer service here was outstanding so we will definitely be returning.

First on her list was Fog Harbor, so we decided to give it a try.  \nI saw a long wait list and wasn't too thrilled about that.  To our surprise it was just a 15 minute wait on a Saturday evening.\nWe were seated and perused the menu to see what I would like to feast upon for dinner.  Our server Khaiman took our drink and appetizer orders.  \nWhen he came back I asked him what was the popular item on the menu.  He immediately said the shellfish platter is a popular item as well as their mixed grill and a couple other items.  I ordered the shellfish platter and my gf the mixed grilled.  Khaiman recommended she get it Cajun flavored for the fish and he was right, but more on that later. \nWe were given some fresh sourdough bread with our appetizers and it was amazing. We had the Dungeness crab, mango and avocado ceviche and while good, it wasn't amazing or to die for.  \nWe also decided to each get a cup of their clam chowder.  This is a definite must have and something I would get again. Nice flavor with a good amount of clams.  It's not overloaded with fillers like potatoes that other restaurants utilize.\nNow for the main course.  The Shellfish platter came with 1/2 a Dungeness crab, mussels, clams, shrimp, and corn.  All of those was drenched in a garlic and herb oil that put this dish over the top.  I love garlic so it was like this dish was made for me.  Everything was fresh and cooked just right.  Price was fair considering what was included.  \nThe mixed grill my gf had was amazing.  The Cajun flavoring wasn't spicy or over powering. It complimented the salmon, swordfish, and shrimp well.  Something I'd recommend to order if you prefer fish over shellfish. \nWe opted out of dessert cause we were quite stuffed and couldn't possibly eat another bite.  \nWhen Khaiman brought out our bill he included some biscoff cookies to enjoy at the show.  \nI should mention I ordered a Moscow Mule to sip on during dinner.  I'm picky since I make my own mules often and they did it right.  Perfect balance of ginger beer and vodka which made it a refreshing beverage. Of course it was served in a copper mug which every mule should be. \nWe have a wonderful experience at Fog Harbor and will be back once we visit Frisco again.

If you don't mind the tourist everywhere then this is your place for good seafood. Service was excellent. I ordered a cup of their clam chowder. Man this was phenomenal. No overpowering thyme taste as I mentioned in my review for Capurro's. Clam chowder done right here. Make sure to have reservation as this place is right on the pier where crowds of people are looking for places to eat so they get packed quickly. I had their Fried Combo platter. I love love loved the flakey white fish perfectly battered. The shrimp however that came in my platter was just \"ok\" really nothing special about it. The Calamari rings were also good. Did enjoy the coleslaw to cut through the richness of my dish. Wash it all down with their house merlot was a perfect dinner minus the mediocre shrimps.", "author": "Mary A."}

Normally not a fan of blue cheese but it was definitely tasty.  Quick highlights of what we ordered:\n\nCrab cakes\nMixed (seafood) grill\nClam Chowder\nand the fried seafood platter?\n\nAll in all, everything tasted excellent and was very fresh BUT the glaring issue with this place is the SERVICE! Understanding it was a saturday evening in tourist central (Pier 39), I kept my patience but when the table behind us that got seated after we did got their entrees first, we had to complain to the waiter.  I know it's not his fault but in the words of the ESPN NFL countdown crew, COM'N MAN!!! At the beginning of the meal, our waiter, Khaiman, recommended we write a review after I showed him my Yelp check-in that earned the free garlic bread so things looked promising too.  The big save was that this place validated up to 2 hrs parking if you parked in the garage next to pier 39.  \n\nIf you're looking for a full service restaurant in touristy Fisherman's wharf, then you could definitely do worse than FHFH but I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to eat here.  I don't know the SF area that well but I'm sure there's plenty of great seafood restaurants in town.  In fact, I'll do a quick search on Yelp to prove it!", "author": "David Y."}

The service was friendly, but incredibly slow.  It took about 15 minutes to get my one glass of champagne, and I could literally see it sitting at the bar for 5 minutes.  It was a busy Saturday night, but the service was just so slow it was painful.  When my steamed crab finally arrived, it was mediocre quality and it took another 5 minutes for them to check in so that I could tell them that they didn't give me crab crackers.  Despite request, I never got a small fork to actually get the crab out.  \nI would not recommend it.  I'm sure there are other nice places to try.

I generally stroll down Pier 39 just because I love the pier/ocean view, and I've always see this restaurant.  Truth be told, I thought it was one of those upscale, dress up like a douche type restaurants.  I was wrong.\n\nI was coming from San Jose, and was planning on having dinner before I go back home.  I was craving for sea food.  You come to San Francisco, you gotta have some sea food if not steak.  Anyways, I was looking for seafood, and found some reviews that shows this place was pretty good.  I didn't know how reservations were, so I had made reservations via Yelp.  When I did it on Yelp, my reservation became at 9:30PM. Meh, lame. \n\nSo we came to Pier 39 walked around a bit, and said screw it.  Let's just ask them how long the wait is.  If it's longer than expected, we've already made reservations anyways.  So we walk up to the restaurant and their layout is quite cozy and warm for those who have to wait.  They have a nice little fireplace that will keep you warm because everyone knows Frisco can get quite cold.  So anyways, I ask the young woman at the podium about the wait time, and suggested I would like a window view.  I didn't expect it to be available considering it's around 6-7ish.  She took me by surprise and said, we are currently cleaning the table right now, and it's window view.  We sat down for like literally 2-3 minutes boom, here comes our waiter--let's go!  Omg, the view was amazing, I mean of course, I'm a sucker for scenery, but damn.  We sat towards the back, window view of the hills and the bridge, to the left was Alcatraz.  Perfect. \n\nOur waiter was Shawn, absolutely amazing.  Very fast pace, generous, and helpful on the suggestions.  My brother thought differently, felt although he could have been more helpful.  So.. Maybe I was more excited on eating than service. Who knows!\n\nOK, food:  Quite expensive if you ask me, but was it worth it? Yes and no.  Some of the items, you can go out to the fish market and get it for cheaper.  But how it was cooked, well.. Stay tuned.\n\n1/2 Oysters:  Mini oysters was what it was really.  The sauce they had made was delicious, I don't remember what it was, but I have pictures. Haha! Foodie!  It was placed over some ice to keep it cool, which everyone should place raw fish over ice, if you don't... Ugh...\n\nCrab Cakes:  Oh my, these were so good.  They were going for $16, only two pieces, which I felt kind of ripped off.  I cannot deny it, they were bomb!  Once in a while, yes worth the $16. Lol, I'm all for cheap eats.\n\nBread Bowl:  Personally, I feel although they were better than Boudins.  I had Boudins down the street where you had to get it via cafeteria style and I am not a fan. This bread bowl was much smaller though, but you could taste the clam chowder better.  Not too much breading either, just enough to distribute.\n\nFog Harbor Burger:  Made was Angus Chuck Patty was quite amazing.  Definitely cooked to perfection without asking.  Medium rare, but not too rare that it made you feel weirded out to eat it.  They got it down as far as burger goes.\n\nFog Harbor 1/2 Lobster/Crab Meat:  Ok... This was quite disappointing.  This was their current specialty on the menu, and I honestly felt like I should have just gotten a full damn lobster tail.  The crab meat was just baked crab.  Nothing special about it.  They charged me a little more than just the lobster tail.  I prefer the lobster tail so much more than to order this again.\n\nFish and Chips:  Fried to a golden texture, very delish.  On point  Not much I can really say, I didn't really eat it.  My boyfriend ordered it. :P Sorry guys\n\n\nOverall my experience was great.  The best part was that I got to see the sunset, and oh yea, even if you're not facing the window, there are mirrors so you can reflect the image.  I sat right in front which had the perfect view.  I loved it.", "author": "Nhu-Quynh N."}

If this restaurant is in your list to go visit, remove it from your list right now. Bad attitude staffs and very low quality food. At first when we walked up to the host to order they asked us what the name is like they were trying to fight us. I know at that time we should've walk away just because of that but we said to give it a try. We went in and we praised the view but but we actually didn't know what a horrible horrible food we are about to experience. First when we ordered the drinks I specifically asked the server for a cold glass of beer. And she came back with a really worm glass and when I told her she was likee awwwww really? Like she felt bad for me and there is nothing she can do about it. We ordered two lobster tailes for $39 each with mashed potatoes, when they brought us the plates as soon as I smelled the food I wished that I would've go eat burgers instead of this low quality small and stinky dish. I eat lobsters all the time and let me tell you this was really really gross and unpleasant that it almost seemed like they boiled it in water. And the most sad part was the mashed potatoes that litterly seemed like they took the potato powder from the box and mixed it with water. THE WORST FOOD EXPERIENCE EVER! the whole dish didn't been worth $10 and a $10 meal would've taste much better than this. And guess what my bill was ? $139.00 for the most disgusting plate in the world. Save your money guys and don't absolutely give you business to this Jack A..es that don't even know anything about cooking food or hospitality skills. They littarly should be shut down.

Without us asking they offered to open the window. He even put a napkin on the chair before he stood on it. Our server was very knowledgeable about all the specials and he suggested so many different options. His vibe and energy were so welcoming and if you end up coming here I definitely suggest to ask for Michael. We ordered the clam chowder and we added crab to it all I can say is phenomenal! We also ordered the fried scallops and they were so moist. For our entr\u00e9es we ordered the ribeye that was on special and the Pacific cod. The Pacific cod came out so flavorful I really enjoyed it.  Unfortunately the ribeye came out a little too rare. But the manager walked over and noticed we were eating it. He was so nice and was willing to take it off the bill or get us a new one. The flavor was so good we just decided to take home our same steak and reheat it. When we looked inside of our to go box it was a whole brand-new steak. He also offered us a complimentary dessert which I thought was also very nice. The manager was very hospitable!

The atmosphere was really nice, air was fresh and it was warm enough.  The bartender was really nice but it did take a long time for him to ring us up but that's because he was making the drinks for everybody in the house and NO ONE was helping him.

He tells us out waiter didn't know he had the section we were in.\n-Our waiter served a table that was seated after us and still don't stop by our table which was four feet directly across from their table\n-We didn't get water after 20 minutes and that's after asking multiple times \n-Our waiter didn't acknowledge us for over 15 min, didn't say hello or apologize for the wait\n-We had to ask for bread\n-It took 50 min to get our food\n-We had to flag down our waiter to get boxes and the check\n-The general manager didn't even ask how everything was even though it was obvious we weren't happy and were looking all over the place for our waiter throughout our entire time there\n\nI cannot stress how bad this dining experience was. How could a tourist restaurant be so poor in customer service? It should be the exact opposite in my opinion. I will not be returning here and will tell others to not go here. The food was mediocre. We ordered the blue cheese garlic bread, clam chowder bowl, crab roll, and the mixed grill. Nothing memorable besides the food was rather bland especially the mixed grill plate. Don't waste your time and money going here. The view of the water and Alcatraz isn't worth it, trust me, the ambiance isn't worth it.

Just the opposite, she really cared about making sure we had a good experience. We began with cocktails that were unique and delicious, then shared a large crab salad, one of the daily specials; great flavor, (on romaine, not the most interesting of greens, but did provide a good crunch). We also shared cioppino, a delicious seafood entree. (I would have given 5 stars, but the shrimp in this dish was overcooked and not good. Since there were only a few pieces and the rest of the seafood was tasty, it wasn't worth mentioning or sending back.) We had planned to order another entree, but were informed that the portions of these two items were pretty large. They were! It was good we didn't order more. We finished with desert. 10 stars for service, 4 stars for food.", "author": "Pam C."}

I know there are lots of similar restaurant options nearby, but they either lack in food or interior or attentive servers. I tried to nitpick and find things I don't like about this place, but honestly I couldn't (again, apart from having to deal with major tourist crowds, which is no fault of the restaurant)\nJust be sure to check out tourist brochures and/or yelp check-in for modest discounts or freebies. In fact, most Wharf/Pier39 restaurants have some form of promotion. They also validate parking so make sure to take advantage of that.\n\nMy party had clam chowder, cioppino, crabs, shellfish platter along with some white wine and dessert.  Clam chowder wasn't the best I've had around bay area, but they were above average. Seafood was fresh and prepared right.\n\nThis probably isn't the best place for family with small children, but for more adult-oriented crowd or date nights, I would highly recommend.", "author": "Christina P."}

You can honestly get better chowder by walking down the wharf a little bit and getting it from one of the stands.\n\nI also got a seafood pasta dish which was good but definitely not memorable (probably why I can't even remember exactly what it's called).\n\nI think I spent like $45 total with a beer on top of those 2 dishes so this place is definitely not on the cheap side.\n\nIn the end, it's basically one of the touristy spots, and you should only expect as much.

We ordered the ahi tuna poke which I really enjoyed and my friend had the crab dip which absolutely loved and devoured. When the main meals arrived my friend had the chowder and said it wasn't really all that special and was just ok. I ordered a plate of clams, mussels, shrimp, crab and corn. The dish was absolutely COVERED in Garlic....there so much garlic everywhere and I had a hard time scraping it off. The clams were ok and there wasn't too much to the mussels. The corn was ridiculous as you couldn't really bite into it but if you scraped it with your teeth you might actually get a little bit.

So I went to Yelp, because I did not want to chance ending up somewhere not so good on my SF Fisherman's Wharf seafood adventure!\n\nI was looking for a nicer dinner place, not just a clam chowder hut, so Fog Harbor caught my eye and with good reviews, we decided to give it a try. I am *so* happy we did .... best meal on our entire vacation!\n\nWe had problems figuring out where to enter the place! lol. I saw the Fog Harbor sign on the wall, but finally after walking around some, we realized we had to walk up the stairs and enter from above! :)\nIt is a very touristy area, but we didn't have to wait to get seated. It's a good-sized restaurant, also with options for eating at the bar, so the capacity for customers is quite good.   They escorted us to a nice table where we could oversee the ocean, Alcatraz and the Pier 39 traffic below while we ate. Loved it.\n\nWe started off with some clam chowder.  While waiting for soup, we were served nice fresh sourdough bread, it was so delicious! Nice and smooth and not \"too sour\", it was perfect.  The clam chowder was wonderful.  Full of clams!! (As a clam chowder should be, but you'd be surprised at how often you can count the clams in a chowder on one hand ....).  We mopped up every single drop with the remains of our sourdough bread, that bowl was clean and ready for service again by the time we were done with it.\n\nFor dinner, I had selected the swordfish. It was served atop ratatouille and fingerling potatoes and was accompanied by pesto sauce and chimichurri.\nThe flavors were amazing, I loved the combination of all these vegetables and sauces along with the swordfish, it really brought the fish \"to life\". I love swordfish, but it can be a little bland if served with the wrong sides.  \nThis vegetable/ratatouille blend along with the sauces really did the fish justice, I loved every bite!\n\nMy husband decided on the crab cake dinner. \nNow, I'm very picky when it comes to crab cakes.  I'm picky on seafood overall actually, but especially food involving crab.  If it is fishy tasting at all, I won't have it, so most crab cakes never pass \"the test\" ;-) \n\nI'm very happy to say, the Fog Harbor crab cakes DID pass the \"Laila\" test with flying colors!! They were so smooth and delicious, I even reached over for a couple of extra bites and luckily my husband is good at sharing ;-) \n\nAt the end of the night, when our bill came, we actually did feel we got our moneys worth ... between the food, the service and the beautiful view, it was totally worth it and it was exactly the San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf seafood experience that I had dreamed about!! :-)", "author": "Laila R."}

I came here with my boyfriend and some of his friends. We were starving and took a while for our waitress to greet us. We weren't even offered bread to begin with until after we ordered. We all shared the fried calamari which was pretty tasty. My boyfriend's friends ordered their famous clam chowder and thought it was really good with the sour dough bread. I ordered the fog harbor burger and it was so delicious. The carmelized onion was perfect and it came with a generous amount of fries. I tried and couldn't even finish the burger. My boyfriend had the fried combo, which included fish and chips along with calamari but he thought that the fish wasn't crispy enogh and could have been better.

My mother and I visited San Francisco over the recent holiday and spent one afternoon strolling from the Ferry Building down to Pier 39.  There were already good reviews of this place, so we made a reservation through Open Table (which was nice and easy on a Sunday afternoon) and did some souvenir shopping while we waited for our late lunch.\n\nThe hostess seated us at our reservation time to the minute, and we had a great window seat looking directly out on the pier, the Rock, and the beautiful bridge.  Our server Barry was excellent; he was friendly and attentive without hovering, and he got everything right the first time with no hesitation.  I think I overheard him say that he just moved to San Francisco.  I mention this because it sounded like he was trying to play down a heavy British accent - don't you know us American girls (well, at least me and my mom) love that sort of thing?!\n\nAll of our dishes and drinks came out perfectly.  We had an appetizer from the specials list - the Dungeness crab and spinach dip - which was delicious, and mom had the \"Escape from Alcatraz\" cocktail, which she loved.  I had the Gewurztraminer, which is impossible to get by the glass in Florida, so I was thrilled.  For the main dish, I had the Halibut special with quinoa, pine nuts, and arugula, and mom had the garlic whole Dungeness crab.  Both of our dishes were wonderful - perfectly cooked and seasoned, and everything was obviously fresh and carefully prepared.\n\nThe meal wasn't too expensive, and certainly worth the price both for the quality and the volume of food we received.  It is definitely a worthwhile spot to relax, refresh, and refuel while seeing the sights!", "author": "Ramona T."}

First off, we were seated and patiently waiting for our server to greet us, as most Restaurants do nowadays. We had another server who greeted us, so unprofessional. He stated that our server for the evening was actually not him but someone else and he was currently on break for the next 20 minutes! Who says that? We asked for a round of water to start with before ordering our drinks and appetizers. This server brought out glasses of water with no ice nor straws, luke warm water on a pretty hot day in City, not to mention how greasy/dirty did the glasses look. Where is the great customer service and best quality of customer care you can get from a moderate expensive restaurant? I totally get it if this was from an Apple Bees but no from this kind of restaurant. \n\nThe food was \"ok\" not to impress with the quality of food, I could have eaten a better meal somewhere else and much less expensive. \n\nFinally our so call server came back from break, he greeted all of his tables except for us, seriously? We had our meals and didn't even bother to intorduce himeself until towards the end of our meal course. He didn't even check on us, to see how our meals were, if he can get us anything else, perhaps another soft drink, beer, or a cocktail - no refills were given to us throughout the whole evening. I was very dissapointed. Like I said before I could have recieved a better treatment somewhere else. \n\nSometimes a plain-o-fancy restaurant is not all customers need - customer service is a must and ALWAYS! The best quality of food is also needed! \n\nIt must have been that it was located at the Pier and in a very touristy area as well. \n\nOverall I will give them two stars because I was truly dissapointed with the customer service provided but their food was \"OK\" not terrible but probably not worth that much.", "author": "Daisy Z."}

I'm not a fan of ginger at all, and did bite into a few tiny pieces, so perhaps I'd ask if it could be prepared without the ginger.  \n\nPeople with reservations get seated at the window tables first.

We were enjoying our time, but then one of the employees started cussing right next to us. He dropped the F-bomb at least 3 times. We asked our server if we could talk to a manager. When the manager came he asked us what the problem was, and just when we were about the to tell the manager, the employee was standing nearby making it very obvious that he was listening to our conversation. I decided to tell the manager anyway. He was very friendly and apologetic. He told us that he would handle the situation and that he does not allow unprofessional behavior from any of his employees. For the rest of our stay the employee glared at us from a distance. He even glared at us as we were leaving.  I walked out with confidence. Dinner was delicious!", "author": "Esther C."}

Fog Harbor is well worth braving the tourist masses.\n\nFog Harbor is located at the front of Pier 39, upstairs on the left side. There is an outdoor seating area with a fireplace and comfy couches. Once inside, there is a small bar just to the right and tons of table seating, all with great views. We sat in the back right area of the restaurant, where we had a view of both Alcatraz and the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nOur server was really helpful and friendly.

Be sure to ask for them the next time you're dining at Fog Harbor.\n\nOurs was a big party - two full tables - and we were seated in the back of the restaurant, which had lovely views, but no air circulation. As the sun went down, the room became entirely too stuffy for comfort. I had to get up to walk outside several times just to clear my head. The bar and main restaurant areas were a good 10-15 degrees cooler. That said, it was really nice outside; the wharf is a beautiful place to have dinner.\n\nThe fried calamari is an excellent way to start a meal at Fog Harbor. Crispy and expertly cooked, they were absolutely delicious.\n\nIf you like sourdough bread, then you'll love the stuff here. People at our tables also raved about the clam chowder, the tuna and the garlic-roasted crab. \n\nThe red chili prawns are flavorful, and pack a decent zing, but the steamed clams lacked flavor. Stick with the more highly spiced dishes and you'll be fine.\n\nDesserts were A-OK as well. Nothing too fancy. Our table had just about every dish offered, and I tried most of them.

This IS a tourist trap! \n\nFor three people, we each got the clam chowder bread bowl, a salad, the tuna ahi poke, calamari and two cocktails. Total before tip comes to about $95 dollars. Not worth it for appetizer meals. \n\nAlthough the chowder was good, nothing about it was outstanding from the rest of the chowders. I wish it contained more or cost less. What makes up for the price is the view of the bay; but depending on where you were seated it wasn't much of a view.", "author": "Christine N."}

To celebrate, she and her husband planned a lunch at Fog Harbor for their family and about 20 of their closest friends. I was really impressed by the way For Harbor was able to accommodate such a large group with such ease.  We were each allowed to order from the regular menu; no pre-fixe menu needed.  Huge plus!  All of the food came out at the same time and nobody's order was incorrect.  On top of that, the food was definitely delicious. Don't miss the calamari, clam chowder, and crab roll!  I'll be coming back to eat those dishes again. As for the prices, they do run a little on the steep side, but it's not totally unreasonable for a seafood restaurant in one of San Francisco's busiest tourist spots.

We ate here last December 2014 and the food was really superb. Unfortunately this time, Oct. 10, my issue has something to do with the way the frontliners queue customers. This is the first time i have experienced this policy of \"we cant seat you until your entire group is complete\" in any restaurant i have ever been. This is despite the fact that we told them we already got their items they wanted to order in advance. I was thinking they might have a full place inside and tables will not be available, but when we were able to come in, I counted at least 8 tables that were vacant and ready for customers. This policy is ridiculous. If you are planning to eat as a group here, beware of this crazy policy before you decide to go.", "author": "Frederick R."}

Beautiful view, good food and nice atmosphere. Only one thing marred my experience, our waiter Pedro. He was condescending and rude, chuckling at any questions we asked about certain items on the menu. (in particular laughing at my father) \nWe had to ask for water, then for bread for our table after a pretty long wait, while other tables in his area were getting water and bread shortly after being seated. I don't know if he didn't feel he had to go the extra mile for us because we are hispanic or what his issue was with us. (all his other tables were non hispanic customers, and when my father asked me a question about the menu in spanish, he chuckled to himself.)\nNot sure if we will be dining here again, though If I were to return to Fog Harbor, I'd make sure not to be seated in Pedro's area.", "author": "CLauDia V."}

Not necessarily bad, just clumsy and very very heavy in the end. \n\nThe bread they offer you is complementary though-- many places sneak a large charge in with bread so this was a nice surprise. \n\nWe had their namesake lager which was unremarkable but definitely nice, and a lagunitas ale which was lovely. \n\nAll in all, probably one of the nicer places on pier 39, it's all expensive since it's a super touristy place, and you'd be best off walking three blocks away and cutting your bill in half. \n\nBut the view was lovely over the water, and we could see the sea lions.

We came here in the afternoon and enjoyed sitting by the fireplace outside and listening to the waterfall while we waited for our table. The restaurant has beautiful bay windows with panoramic views of the wharf. It's worth asking for a table next to the window where you can actually see the seals below! \n\nBeing in SF I really wanted fresh baked bread so I was delighted when a bread basket of warm, freshly baked sourdough bread arrived. To kick things off, we enjoyed the Crispy Lemon Calamari ($12), which was delicious! The calamari was seasoned with lemon zest and delicious on it's own even without the lemon aioli. For lunch, one of us enjoyed the award winning Clam Chowder in a Bread Bowl ($9) and the other had the Soup and Salad Combo ($14) with a Caesar side salad. The soup was served in a fresh baked sourdough bread bowl.

The complimentary bread came out next... *happy dance* (I love bread, I love bread!) For our meal we opted for a variety of appetizers. We had the calamari as many yelpers recommended -- it did not disappoint. Next we had the clam chowder in a bread bowl -- yummy as well. Next time, however, I will not get the bread bowl. Although the bread bowl was good, the complimentary table bread that came out at the beginning of the meal was just as good (maybe even better). Being the bread connoisseur that I am, paying for a bowl of bread when the complimentary bread is just as yummy -- well... I won't be doing that again. For our final appetizer, we got the mussels with fries. That also did not disappoint. The mussels were cooked in a tomato base with what tasted like a coconut broth -- yummmmm.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-11-05", "description": "As of now, I see that the overall rating is at a 3.5 stars, and I think that is what I would give it.  I'm deciding to give it a 4 stars though, because I think if I had to go .5 star higher or lower, I would go higher because the overall experience was pretty good.\n\nThe warm, fresh sourdough bread was fantastic.  It really made me wish I got the clam chowder to go with it though.\n\nAs a starter, my hubby and I got the calamari.  I have to say, the only reason why I would give it a 3.5 stars is because of the calamari.  I'm no cooking expert, but I've heard when things are not fried at the right temperature, they absorb a lot more oil.  The calamari was SUPER UBER oily.  I didn't even feel like I could taste the calamari, just the breading and oil.   It was on a bed of lettuce and there was tons of oil on the lettuce.   It was pretty ick.  Did I mention it was oily???\n\nMy hubby ordered the lobster tail, which was pretty good.  He let me try some of his plate.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly, not mushy or anything.  The mashed potatoes were....regular.  They were too mushy and the taste wasn't that spectacular.\n\nI wasn't THAT hungry so I got the tuna tartare.   That was pretty damn good, so I would highly recommend that.  The ripe (but not mushy) mango and avocado were so good with it.  I do miss that and hope to go back for that and then probably get the soup to go with the yummy bread.\n\nThe other thing is that I didn't get to sit where there was a view since it was too crowded, but it was one of those times where it seemed everyone else had a nice view except me.  Oh wells, overall, it was a nice lunch.  I'm not going to blame them for being too busy to seat me with a nice view, but I'm sure that would have added to the experience.  I MIGHT have given a strong 4 stars. ;)\n\nSo, I guess after writing this review, I realized I don't like mushy things that aren't supposed to be too mushy...\n\nUPDATE...\n\nThe manager contacted me and apologized to me that I did not have a great experience and for the fact I did not get a window seat.  Well, it totally wasn't their fault I didn't get a window seat, so I definitely don't blame them for that at all. I just knew it would have added to the experience.  Anyways, the reason why I felt so compelled to give an update is because I admire the fact that the manager contacted me and was not defensive at all.  And he also said he would let the whole team there know about my experience.\n\nSO, I will take my family there and try it another time and see what my experience is.  I might take one for the Yelp team and even order the calamari again to see if it's super uber oily or fried to perfection and let everyone know.  \n\nI'm sure with that kind of attitude, the restaurant will continue to improve.  So, we'll see what my next visit is like!  In the meantime, I think they deserve 5 stars though.", "author": "Katy K."}

I'll definitely order the Ahi Tuna for myself next time!", "author": "Anna Z."}

So I was very curious what to expect and I have to admit that I wasn't disappointed at all!\n\nAfter the lady on the front desk remarked our reservation (directly from Yelp via Open Table) we got straight to our table. Our server, I dont't remember his name, arrived promptly and showed us the menu and explained the specials of the day.\n\nTo me I felt fine from the first moment so I ordered as a Starter the Tuna Carpaccio, which I normaly wouldn't cause I don't like fish that much. Nevertheless it was delicous and very nice presented. As a main course I had a very tender and perfect cooked steak which hasn't to fear any compare to a traditonal steak-house. Also my financee was very happy with her choice, altough I can't remember exactly what she ordered.\n\nAfter the Entrees our waiter presented us the desert-list in original on a tablet. It looked so delicous that even I couldn't deny and went for an Irisch Coffee as well. All in all, I was kindly surprised what this restaurant had to offer.\n\nBesides the very good food and the overwhelming charme of our waiter, it was the atmosphere of this place that I liked about it.

The server (I think she said her name was Clementine, maybe?) was there promptly to take our drink orders and had our iced teas and water out in a flash. We ordered 4 clam chowder bread bowls ($10 each, not bad for a nice restaurant on the wharf) and we had those in less than five minutes, so so so so so yummy!

We were seated rather quickly on a Friday night but our table was awkwardly positioned under a beam of some sort, right next to the waiter area (where the waiters gather, put their orders in, etc).  It was VERY warm, so much so that I almost left midway to cool off outside.   I ordered the clam chowder, which I usually DON'T order, as I am not a fan of cream soups, but I actually enjoyed it a lot.  I didn't order a dinner, but got the red chili garlic shrimp appetizer and a salad.  I think the waiter was a bit confused, but didn't make too much of a fuss over it.

So when I tried Fog Harbor at the Yelpin' La Vida Loca Party, the Crab Ceviche, the Ahi Tuna - I wanted to come back. I received a coupon for a free appetizer with dinner at the Yelp event, but it was the food that kept me thinking about trying it out. After having a touristy boat ride on the Bay, me and my friend went over to Pier 39 for an early dinner.\n\nDon't be fooled by the novelty of the Pier, Fog Harbor is a nice classic seafood restaurant. Nice big booths with great views of the bay to Golden Gate Bridge.  The place is huge and would be ideal for a Holiday Party, dinner party or event. They have a nice big bar that serves up anything you want, although they have quite a few custom cocktails.\n\nI ordered myself a Bloody Mary, I can appreciate a good bloody mary outside of normal brunching hours, especially if I'm enjoying some seafood.  Since we were going for the full tasting experience, we ordered the: \n\n*Ahi Tuna on a fried wonton and Cajun seared with cayenne aioli  ~Absolutely delicious. I tried this at the yelp event and had to order it again.\n*Red Chili Garlic Prawns: Red chili paste, onions, peppers and garlic ~Spicy and so good, the sauce and peppers had so much flavor, I added a couple spoonfuls to my bloody mary. Yeah, it's THAT good.\n*Garlic Roasted Crab: Roasted 1/2 crab with a garlic herb butter ~At $15.00, I could eat this every night. Served with hot butter, I sat there happily cracking my crab and tasting every bit of that garlicky buttery goodness. If you need a crab fix, I highly recommend this dish. \n*Salmon BLT: Served on a toasted french roll with a pesto aioli. ~ Really great, probably one of the best salmon sandwiches I've had. You know that feeling when you take a bite of someone's sandwich and you want more. If I wasn't so entertained cracking my crab, I'd be all over this sandwich. \n\nWhen they came up with the dessert platter, I didn't know if I could possibly do it...but there was the cr\u00e8me brulee. Just tempting me. It was just as good as expected, creamy with that sugar glazed candy crunch top.  I had my dessert with an Absolute Lemonade cocktail, very refreshing. \n\nI really enjoyed my dinner at Fog Harbor and will definitely come back.  The service was excellent, the food was incredible, affordable for the quality and the whole overall experience was worth coming down to the pier to try out. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!", "author": "Rebekah T."}

We were given a bowl of bread which was so good and I almost ate all of it until I remembered that I was also getting bread with my meal.  The view was gorgeous outside our window.    \n\nMy boyfriend ordered a chardonnay, and I want to say that it was the floor manager who helped him pick one out.  He was very knowledgable and helpful, and knew exactly what he was talking about.  We ordered the calamari for an appetizer.  This was a FULL plate too, it wasn't just a few pieces.  They really were generous, and it was delicious.  Our food arrived about 10 minutes after we got the appetizers.  Of course the bread bowl was delicious, and my boyfriends salmon was amazing!  The salmon wasn't dried out, and the crab was fantastic.  \n\nThe service is also good here.  The waiter checked up on us and had no problem when I gave him the coupon.

The red Chilli sauce was the regular sauce you get with Chinese food. Once I cracked open the crab and mixed the meat with rice and sauce, the whole thing tasted too salty and way too cheap Chinese food like. The lobster tail was good so were the mashed potatoes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-19", "description": "My wife, daughter and I took the ferry from Vallejo for my daughter's birthday celebration in SF.  We had eaten at the Fog Harbor once before and decided to take her there for her birthday lunch.  \n\nWe got there fairly early - about 11:30 AM, and got a wonderful booth that was raised above the window tables across the aisle from them, and had an outstanding view through the large picture windows.  You can see the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and all the sailboats riding on the bay.  It is truly a spectacular view.\n\nBut on to the restaurant. The first time we were there, we had a great waiter who was not only personable but efficient.  This time, we had someone who's level of service is equal to the finest of the fine dining restaurants of which we've partaken.  Her name is Madison, and she was beyond belief, especially since she has just turned 21 - her service is well beyond her years.  \n\nWe're a military family - I'm ex-Navy and my daughter is married to an Army LCOL.  Madison is married to a Coast Guardsman - if you are lucky enough to get one of her tables, ask her how she met her husband - it's a great story. Actually, I'd suggest you ask for her if she's on. You'll thank me later.  \n\nNot only was she personable, and her service excellent, but she truly wanted to give us an exceptional experience.  We were there fairly early, but the restaurant was still pretty full (it was packed when we left, with people waiting outside), but she still found time to tell us the story of the restaurant and Pier 39, as well as talking with us quite often.\n\nBut her service was top-notch.  She constantly came by our table and asked us if we needed anything, and then spoke with us for a few minutes just to make our visit more enjoyable. She is a gem. \n\nOK, on to the restaurant itself. I ordered the crab roll, which was fantastic.  It's served on a brioche rather than a roll - the brioche is split and butter-toasted, and it is filled all the way to the bottom with a crab salad.  The crab tasted fresh, and considering that it's not crab season, must have been flown in from Oregon or Washington.  My wife had the lobster fried in their special Anchor Steam beer batter, which she said was one of the best lobsters she'd ever had.  Our daugher had the beet salad and a cup of clam chowder topped with crab.  All of our food was excellent.  \n\nOne thinks of restaurants on the water as being touristy and not fine dining. Not the case with Fog Harbor.  This place has incredible food, top-notch service (especially Madison), and a view that cannot be beat.\n\nThe only down side (this is funny) is that the food came out of the kitchen so fast we didn't have time to enjoy the view before it was there. We had just ordered (or so it seemed). I wanted to go to the restroom before our food arrived, so I got up and started out. I saw a waiter coming down the aisle near us with some plates of food, so I waved him by.  He gave me a puzzled look, and then said, \"These are your meals, sir.\"  \n\nOops.  I've never had food served that quickly.  I sort of wish that they'd taken their time so we could enjoy the view a little more and settle in, but no one rushed us out of the table or made us feel like they were hoping we'd leave so they could turn the table.\n\nI can't recommend this restaurant enough. As last time, the manager came by to ask us how everything was, and we told him honestly that it was fantastic. But the shining star was Madison.

The food was very good, I had the Shellfish Platter with 1/2 crab, mussels, clams, and shrimp. Very good portion, but pretty pricey. The other portions (not specifically sure what the rest of the fam got) were quite small though. Not worth the money they said. The service was...ok. I wasn't able to get a refill on my ice tea because my waiter didn't come around to check enough. Waters stayed empty for most of the night.

So what, The restaurants in these locations can't be good?\n\n They should be amazing considering all the people walking in off the pier from all over the world, however FOG HARBOR- doesn't cut it when it comes to food. Great location, beautiful views, great staff but OK food. \n\n The bread is warm and delicious. The bay shrimp cocktail is very fresh and tasty. \nCrab Cake platter- ugh. Cakes were mushy and lacking flavor, slaw was warm, maybe from being under the lamp too long? Fries nothing special. Left half of my entree on my plate, including a whole crab cake!!!! Not good. \nMy husband ordered shrimp scampi and our waiter made it happen even though its not on the menu.(excellent service).  It Needed more garlic but it was ok. \n\nBEST PART of THE MEAL?

Being from San Francisco originally, it's always fun to come back and visit my parents and see the city. Because they live across the street from Pier 39 it made sense to walk over and find a spot to eat. Typically I'd avoid a place so filled with tourists but they raved about Fog Harbor's views and so off we went. The views were indeed lovely! We looked out across the bay to Alcatraz and saw lots of boats sail past. \n\nThe food was by no means bad but I think because it's a large restaurant in a heavily trafficked area, some quality gets lost in the mix. There must've been at least 60 other people dining at 3pm. The interior of the space is beautiful, the staff was very professional and polite and the food was good. Nothing wowed me but if you're from out of town and you want an affordable option that's not divey or cheesy, Fog Harbor is perfect. \n\nExpect seafood options like clam chowder in a sourdough bowl, crab cakes, shrimp louie, and even lobster. Other options include salads, sandwiches and lots of seafood pasta. Definitely something for everyone!", "author": "Katy H."}

We had better food at other places that weekend -- but I do think that Fog Harbor is a nice way to cap off an afternoon/evening of exploring Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nEdited to add: My boyfriend had the clam chowder in a soup bowl, along with a glass of red wine, and I had a Caesar salad and the calamari appetizer as my dinner.", "author": "Kristan H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-02-22", "description": "Our waiter was amazing. I feel like a bad customer because I don't remember his name and he told me twice! I really wish I can give him a shout-out, so here is the best I can do: he's from Hawaii, looks Filipino-ish, has family in Los Angeles and is probably the best, most polite, most sociable waiter I've ever had (without being obnoxious!) So there Fog Harbor Fish House, give him a well-deserved raise!\n\nMy boyfriend and I walked all the way through Pier 39 and no other restaurant was calling my attention. I finally spotted two restaurants upstairs, and right when I read the menu for Fog Harbor, I was convinced. My cheffy boyfriend is very picky as well  (though he'll never admit it) and I knew it was a good choice for the both of us.\n\nThe crab menu was super impressive. The crab season is about to end and they offered a page worth variety of crab entrees if you're into it. I ordered the crispy calamari before we sat down by the window with a great Golden Gate Bridge view, and it came out within 8 minutes or so. It definitely did not disappoint! They served it with a delicious aioli and the calamari were thicker chunks with light and crunchy batter.\n\nWith me being prego, and already having had my 3rd 6oz low-mercury dish for the week, I unfortunately had to go with a non-seafood option. I only say \"unfortunately\" because Fog Horn looks like they can serve up a mean seafood dish. I chose to go with the Chicken breast sandwich with shallot aioli, bacon, avocado, lettuce and tomato. It was perfectly juicy and flavorful and the aioli brought the sandwich together, setting it apart from what a Chicken BLT w/ avocado would taste like.\n\nTony ordered the Fog Horn Burger medium rare, with a half glass of red wine. The Fog Horn came with caramelized onions and Tony asked to substitute the jack cheese for blue cheese instead. It also had 1000 Island Chipotle on it and he seriously savored every single bite. The blue cheese swap definitely made a huge difference. I had one happy chef man sitting in front of me!\n\nAll in all, we spent $50. With the presentation, the wine, the amazing service, the freshness of the food and the promptness of the food arrival, I was impressed and beyond satisfied. I would recommend this place and I would definitely come back.", "author": "Aileen P."}

A priority for me), amazing view of Alcatraz, nice decor, and a tasty sounding menu. However, many of the items we ordered were mildly disappointing. \nOur starters, chili lime shrimp salad and (on special) crab ceviche with mango and avocado, were bizarrely similar just with different protein. The ceviche was served on lettuce, drizzled with the same salad dressing which was mildly mustardy and didn't go with the dish. Also, while the amount of crab was decent, it actually seems skimpy on the mango, avocado, and lime. Definitely missing a ceviche sort of flavor, but it was a tasty pile of shredded crab meat. Both starters also had the same house made tortilla chips, just in different shapes. \nMy husband liked his crab roll sandwich, and the sweet potato fries that came with it were good. If I had realized my salmon sandwich came with fries, I would have upgraded to sweet potato. Blackened salmon was a nice option. Half my sandwich was leftover and still good the next day, cold. \nOur drinks were just okay. We didn't stay for dessert. If you go, insist on a seat with a view.", "author": "Karin W."}

It came on a bed of fingerling potatoes, grilled onions, peppers and capers. The pesto aioli was perfect, and the fish seriously melts in your mouth.\nThe sourdough bread is pretty awesome, too.\nHowever, looking around at the plates of my fellow diners, I can see why some people would be disappointed.\nMy husband got the crab melt, which I tasted.

When a waitress brought the clam chowder it was in a bread bowl. By the time we realized and said, \"Excuse me...\" she had just dropped it on the table and left rather abruptly. They later brought the bowl that we ordered. When the salmon blt arrived, I looked and noticed...hot dog, no salmon wtf?! I was borderline insulted by this and asked the waitress, \"What is this??\" She was nice and was surprised as well and took the order back. The cook manager (?) eventually brought the salmon blt, but by then I was sort of full eating some of my wife's fish n chips.

The place did proceed to get very packed very quickly so it would seem we got lucky with the seating.  Luck or not, I'm giving this place extra points just for the fact that they could accommodate us.\nEdit: We went back two years later and the clam chowder and calamari were still great. My wife had the linguine alla vongole and enjoyed it very much (it was loaded with clams). The fish and chips my son had were only OK.

Don't get me wrong, I believe the food here is great and the quality is phenomenon. But the food just doesn't make you crave to remember. The place has a nice view, it's located on the pier, and the decor is very lovely. \n\nI had the oysters and I believe they were from fanny bay if I could remember. Only 1 selection. The condiments given could have been better. They are a seafood restaurant so I expected to have a larger oyster selection. The ceviche with crab was very delicious, but I felt the chips that were given to compliment it were just thrown on there. It felt a little stale to me. The ceviche could have been a bit more sour as well. I split the cioppino with a friend and because I'm a girl it was an okay amount. I didn't leave feeling full. The seafood in the cioppino tasted a bit dry and the mussels I had did not taste so fresh. I've had better cioppino with much more seafood in it before. We had the Alcatraz escape and the drinks were well made. It tasted great and it wasn't too weak. Instead of giving mints they gave a biscoff cookie, which I thought was weird. Overall, its's an okay place. Not great but definitely not something you must try. I tried to like the place, but I can't still. 3 stars because it's not a bad place.\n\nMy friend had the lobster stuffed crab. He enjoyed it.

I know they were busy and i didnt mind the wait for an 1 hour and a half. Luckily there was a lounge so my boyfriend and i were able to rest. When we were seated we thought we got the best seat because it was at the corner near the windows. We can see the fisherman wharf but on my right, people from outside can see us which was awkward. So the waiter was very sweet and was kind to take a picture of my boyfriend and I. Since I LOVE the picture so much, i had to give him a tip. So anyways, 1 star for the service. Food....however....\nWas HORRIBLE. My boyfriend order the Surf and Turf, medium rare. Nope. It was well-cooked. Then he ask the waiter for a recommendation for a heavy wine. My boyfriend thought it was all right. Wasn't heavy for him, but everyone is different.\nSo for my food. I order the Caesar salad (idk the full name but it's close to it). Maybe it was me, but I have never really experience not having my lettuce cut so i had to cut them myself. I asked for chicken too but they only gave me like 8 small pieces and 3 croutons.....I was upset. I had way better salad at other places. Other than that, if you love oysters, you gotta try the baked one. IT WAS DELICIOUS! +1 Star. If i knew it was that good, i would have ordered three instead of that salad -_- but nope.

I was looking for a delicious restaurant that didn't have a strict dress code. (I'm 8 months pregnant and don't have the widest variety of formalwear) ;) \n\nWe decided to try several appetizers, and then split a dinner instead. It turned out to be an excellent decision. The meal starts out with a perfectly prepared sourdough bread, it was so delicious. We had the calamari, I really enjoyed the dipping sauce and found it the batter to be delightfully crispy. My fiancee, didn't agree with the breading, as he prefers the light crispy kind. We also split the steamed mussels, they came in a delicious broth that was savory and delicious. We both agreed, these were absolutely amazing! We followed it with an order of raw oysters, and they were so fresh and delectable. They were a bit small, but the freshness and taste really made up for any shortcomings. We also shared a cup of clam chowder (how could we not?), and via others suggestion used the free sourdough bread in place of the bread bowl. We noticed a bar patron eating some amazing looking sweet potato fries topped with blue cheese, which you NEED to try because they are to die for! Upon further questioning with our waitress, there is a little happy hour bar menu that you should ask for if you happen to get the chance! For our main course, we split the cioppino. It was stocked full of delicious fish, crab, mussels, and shrimp, and featured a savory and thick tomato broth. It was really delicious, my fiancee found it to have too strong of a \"fish\" taste for him, but that's what made it awesome for me. For dessert we had the creme brulee, and it was perfectly caramelized on top, and creamy thick and fabulous... they really know their way around the dessert area! \n\nThe entire meal only set us back about $150 which was pretty awesome for location and the amount of food we ordered. Make a reservation and ask for a window seat, the view is beautiful. If we happen to make our way back to the San Francisco area, we will definitely be back!", "author": "Lauren Y."}

The hostess sat us at the windows overlooking the Pier and at first I was resenting it because we couldn't get the HH specials, but I'm sure glad she did.  The sun was just setting and we had the most gorgeous view minus the smell and bird poop outside.  \n\nWe got the fish & chips and calamari to split and when we told our waitress, she was so nice to ask the kitchen to put the order onto 2 plates.  She was extremely pleasant and helpful checking in on us, and even getting us 2 different choice of dipping sauce for the calamari when we didn't like the mayo aioli.  \n\nThe food itself wasn't memorable and they serve large portions that we couldn't finish.

A trifecta!\n\nHowever, my recent visit this weekend left me slightly disappointed due to the service. First, we were seated at a table too small for our party though we made reservations weeks in advance. The sun was glaring on our table and made us uncomfortable, so we ended up changing tables. However, once we changed tables, we ended up with a waitress that was extremely grumpy. Maybe she picked up an extra couple shifts? She was tired and lifeless and was not keen on interacting more with us than possible. There were plenty of servers and waiters around on a Sunday evening when only 30-40% of the restaurant was filled, yet our service was so slow. Our waters were too often completely empty. It was also a birthday as stated during our reservation, but we had to remind the waitress a couple times to get a candle... When the desserts came out, low and behold, candleless... and then the waitress brought out another dessert with a candle 20 minutes later. She then, charged us for the extra dessert and we had to ask her to take it off. Sloppy... and off... \n\nThe food was quite good and well-priced, as usual and the view was nice, though slightly too sunny during sunset (they didnt lower their shades over the offending windows). Enjoyed the mixed grill, clam chowder, crab ceviche, and seafood cioppinos. Don't know what's wrong, but service is getting sloppy.", "author": "Farrah N."}

My dinner companion thought they were delicious.  Now the best part of the meal. .... dessert.  I happened across a chocolate cake.  I don't normally go for chocolate but it was the best dessert option.  You know the fudge inside a molten lava cake?  That's exactly what it tastes like!  The entire thing and it doesn't have a cake texture,  more like a thick pudding.  Worth every calorie and more.  I honestly believe it's the best thing I've ever eaten,  in my life!

I wanted to treat my little girl to her favorite meal of fish and chips at her favorite place in the City, Pier 39. Since my daughter was famished, I stopped by the first restaurant that served a kids portion of fish and chips. It was Fog Harbor Fish House. What a big mistake that was. Our waitress, who acted like she had some sort of hearing impairment, seemed like she was on 'something'. I had to repeat my order four times. Yes four times. But whatever. Maybe she was having a bad day. We ordered the kids fish and chips, curry mussels, and the cheeseburger. After waiting for about ten minutes, my daughter started to complain for that she was hungry, and was there any bread for her to nibble on before her fish and chips?  Looking around for our waitress, she was no where to be found. Finally the double doors to the kitchen opened and out came our deaf waitress carrying our mussels. She sets  it down and I start digging in. I offered my daughter some. She refused, she just wanted bread. The mussels were fresh, but didn't taste curry enough (probably the freshest thing that we ordered) and  the curry sauce just sat at he bottom of the dish. It was like the mussels were steamed separately and the curry sauce was just an afterthought.  I looked up to ask for the bread, but the deaf waitress disappeared again. She not only forgot our bread but also a bowl to put my shells. I told my daughter to simply drink her cranberry juice that she ordered. She was quiet. I asked her what's wrong. She just looked at the juice. I grabbed the juice and sipped throughout he straw and to my horror that juice was SPOILED!  Half-way through eating, the double doors flung wide open and out comes our deaf waitress. I practically shouted for a bread basket. And as quickly as she came through the doors she quickly disappeared through them again. But too fast for me to request a bowl for my shells and to fill my water cup. Sigh. She comes out 5 minutes later with warm sourdough bread and butter. My little girl was finally in food heaven. After 10 minutes, my daughter's long-awaited fish and chips and my cheeseburger finally came. I finally asked for a bowl for my shells. Our waitress noticed that the cup was still full of cranberry juice. I politely told her that it was a bit rotten. She stated she'll take the juice out of my bill. My burger looked awesome. But at the first bite I noticed the burger was a bit tough and the bacon old and leathery, liked it was MICROWAVED :( NOT GOOD. The fries were okay, nothing spectacular. I was thirsty and asked my daughter for a little of her water, since i drank all mine and the deaf waitress was now where to be found. Then I looked at my daughter's fish and chips. I asked her why she was just picking at it. She didn't say anything. I asked her if she wanted a to go box for it. She said, \"No box, please\". She NEVER says this. I took a fork full of fish, that $hiT was COLD AND HARD! OMG. I quickly looked around for our deaf and invisible waitress, but she was no where to be found. I finally saw her robustness and asked for the check and two boxes (hey, I wasn't going to waste food. My dog hadn't eaten and could use the cold fish and hard burger). The check came and as I was about to sign it, the manager came up to me and inquired about our meal. I made a face and rolled my eyes.  He said that wasn't a good sign and to tell him what happened. So I proceeded to tell him about the fish and chips and cranberry juice. I was about to tell him about our lack of service, but he grabbed my check and went to fix my bill. He took out my daughter's meal and gave me an extra 20% off.  He even offered to fix my daughter another meal. Nice gesture, but it was too late. This place already gave me indigestion.

We were seated right away, our waiter was right there.  When I said I wanted to leave to feed the meter, he suggested holding our orders briefly, which was brilliant.  All we had was the clam chowder with a side salad (it was early and again, I wasn't expecting much), a glass of wine and a Shirley Temple, but it was all DELICIOUS.  Truly, some of the best clam chowder ever - with bunches of actual lovely, meaty clams.  The sourdough bread was amazing.  My husband's ranch dressing on his green salad was delicious, and my caesar salad was great.  The prices were reasonable, and the food everyone else around us had looked amazing!  My husband is already plotting to go back, just for the chowder, but I'm excited to try something else with it!  But on top of this, the whole place was a class act - fresh flowers in the bar, waiters who were well groomed and attentive, a gorgeous view, even the bathroom was exceptionally clean and well-serviced.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-12-20", "description": "Looking for a restaurant in the Wharf that wasn't a total tourist trap, but would satisfy my lady's desire for seafood, I found Fog Harbor through Yelp. We weren't disappointed.\n\nThe food was excellent, and service was stellar throughout. Our waitress was attentive without being a hovering presence, and took care of everything from corkage (it's only $12; you might do well to bring your own bottle) to dessert recommendations (more on this later--holycarp). When we asked for more lemon, she brought a plate of six nicely arranged wedges. \n\nWe started with the clam chowder in a bread bowl, which we shared. It was, as others have noted, creamy, full of clams, and not too salty. Of course you must not only dip the small wedge-shaped bread top, but also eat as much of the bread bowl as you can handle without jeopardizing your ability to put away dessert. \n\nNext came a half-dozen oysters, raw on the half-shell, with cocktail and wasabi sauces. Despite being an aggressively openminded eater, I'd somehow never had oysters before. Without the benefit of further experience, I think it's safe to say this was a good place to start. The oysters tasted very fresh, nice and briny, with a much more pleasant texture than I'd imagined.\n\nFor the entree, I got the special salmon (stuffed with crab) and Em had the mixed grill (salmon, swordfish, and prawns). Again, everything tasted absolutely fresh. All the fish was cooked perfectly--my salmon was just opaque, tender-firm and flaky. The swordfish, which I don't normally like much, was juicy and delicious. If I must pick a gripe, I'd take issue with the mixed vegetables--they were overcooked (to my taste; some of the zucchini strips were completely soggy) and unimaginative, though still a step up from the simply steamed carrot, cauliflower and broccoli you'd find at many common seafood joints. \n\nThe dessert tray offered some interesting selections alongside a couple old standbys. In addition to the expected creme brulee and apple crisp, there was a pumpkin bread pudding, some kind of individually baked chocolate cake, and a pumpkin cheesecake. My girlfriend is currently obsessed with pumpkin to what's likely an unhealthy degree, so we got the cheesecake. Moreover, our waitress said it was to die for. She never lied--eating it was like biting into the spiced flesh of an angel, only sweeter and less sacrilegious.  \n\nTwo appetizers, two entrees, corkage fee and dessert came to just over $100. You can easily pay more for less in the heart of San Francisco's #1 tourist trap. If you're not on a budget, and you want to enjoy some well-prepared seafood with minimal frills and gimmicks, you might give Fog Harbor a try. We left thoroughly stuffed, and very happy.\n\nPS: Parking is $7/hr in the nearby Pier 39 garage, but dinner will get you 2 hours free if you remember to validate (NB: I did not remember to validate).", "author": "Luke R."}

Thank goodness they have shades they can pull down or this would have been a deal breaker. Susan was our waitress in the beginning. It took a little while to get drinks, and even longer to get some yummy SD bread. We decided to order some appetizers so we went with the Crab Cake $19, and Calamari $12. Well, the bread, and apps all came out at the same time, followed by the entrees way too soon after. It's all about the timing, which you would think this place would have down by now. The SD bread was hot and yummy, as was the Calamari with Garlic Aioli. Now in most restaurants you get 2 Crab Cakes per order, especially when they're charging $19!!!! It was ok, we've definitely had better for that price. For our entrees I got the Shrimp Brochette which was good but not incredible for $22. My husband got the Surf & Turf $58, which he did enjoy.

I also received a gorgeous red rose  courtesy of the restaurant. \n If you're thinking about it...just go. I def recommend it. Plus the views are stunning. Try to go arouind sunset time.

Being a foodie family, we tried many excellent restaurants, but Fog Harbor was FAR AND AWAY the best meal of our vacation.  So so good.\n\nWe started with the grilled artichoke appetizer with the crab dip and it was... amazing.  Then our meals came out.  My dad ordered the Mixed Grill dish.  He said that everything on it was excellent but the salmon blew him away.  My mom had the fish and chips and it was a solid, well-done version of fish and chips.  My brother ordered the garlic crab which was outstanding... as was everything else on his plate (like the corn and potatoes).  I ordered one of the specials - a pesto halibut that was phenomenal.  Great flavors.\n\nIt was such a wonderful meal that we were nervous to get dessert, fearing that we might end on a clunker.  Our waitress assured us, though, that the desserts where worth trying and so we ordered the chocolate banana bread pudding.  The waitress was so right... that dessert was... INCREDIBLE.  It was so good, we were trying to figure out if we could go back there and get another one as an afternoon snack before we leave town.  \n\nOh, and the atmosphere is lovely, the view is pretty nice depending on where you sit, and the service was fantastic.\n\nSeriously.  If you're on Pier 39... go here.  It is a divine blessing.", "author": "Beth G."}

But the area has the highest concentration of crab serving restaurants.  Based on a recommendation, I found myself staring at the Dungeness Crab menu at Fog Harbor Fish House.  I tried the crab cake sandwich and garlic roast crab with popcorn shrimp appetizers.  The shrimp was super tender and hot (Yum!).  The crab cake was delicious and filling and the garlic roast crab was as good as you can find on the wharf.  The views are my favorite and the service was attentive and kind.\nParking is easy at the garage across the street and you can walk your meal of on the pier.  A great place for crab with a view!", "author": "Pablo R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-07", "description": "My wife and I had dinner here the other night because we had a coupon for a free appetizer. It turned out to be serendipitous.  We live in the North Bay and come to the City often. When it comes to restaurants, we are nothing but a bit jaded. That said, we had a splendid meal at Fog Harbor. Instead of a main course, we ordered several items listed as starters because that gives exposure to more dishes especially when there are only the two of us dining.\n\nWe started with the fried calamari which was served with a lemon aioli for dipping. The dish was all rings, no tentacles. The batter was light, something like you would expect to find in a very good tempura bar. We also had the sliders, the crab cakes and the red curry mussels.\n\nThe sliders were great. Cooked perfectly (medium rare) and smothered in caramelized onions. My wife loves crab cakes and pronounced them as good as any she has ever had. I'm not much of a crab cake lover, but I thought they were good. I will never love crab cakes, so don't take my word as gospel.\n\nThen I had the red curry steamed mussels. I am a mussel fanatic. I've eaten them over half the world, particularly in Belgium (where mussels is the national dish), and I can honestly say that these are the most delicious steamed mussels I have ever had. These are not the red curry mussels you will find in Thai restaurants. You are going to have to try them to see what I mean. By the way, although listed as a starter, there were enough for a main dish, especially when accompanied by Fog Harbor's terrific sourdough bread which is made on site.\n\nI asked the restaurant manager for the mussels recipe, but he couldn't comply. I then emailed the company and was sent the recipe by one of the senior execs. That is service above and beyond.\n\nBy the way, we were there during happy hour, and were able to enjoy a very good house Pinot Grigio for $5/glass - an added bonus.\n\nFog Harbor is located at Pier 39, a venue most locals associate with tourists and would not normally think of as a place to go for fine dining. Wrong.  Fog Harbor is considerably better than most of the famous places in the Fisherman's wharf vicinity. To make matters even better, with the appropriate coupon (available everywhere in the City) you can park free, a huge benefit in San Francisco where parking fees are equivalent to winnings in the Powerball lottery.", "author": "Michael B."}

We all really enjoyed meals. I had the tuna which was cooked to perfection and came on a delicious bed of wild rice.

We were starving and read all the excellent reviews so we settled in here. We're San Diego natives so we're no strangers to fresh, delicious seafood. This place was neither. We ordered clam chowder, fried shrimp & a shrimp & crab sandwich. Clam chowder was mediocre at best. Fried shrimp was good. Sandwich was alright. The spoon that came with my soup was wet with a brown colored substance. I smelled it and it was unmistakably coffee. Not sure I even want to think about how that happened. Nothing, besides the dirty spoon, stood out to us. I kinda felt like this restaurant thinks it can just serve anything simply because it's on pier 39. Not impressed. The fact that my spoon had coffee on it did this place in. I just can't get past that.", "author": "Lisa B."}

Fog Harbor is one of the few exceptions!  If I find myself on Pier 39 with friends or family I go to one of two fabulous restaurants.  If I want something a little fun and casual, then Wipeout Bar and Grill fits the bill.  When I want to dazzle and impress, Fog Harbor is the place.  \n\nMy husband and I had lunch at Fog Harbor last week as we had a friend from Germany in town visiting.  We wanted something nice, and Fog Harbor was the first thing that popped into my mind.  We walked in without a reservation (next time I would make one, just to be safe because they were pretty busy) and were greeted by a friendly host and also by the bartender who was also busy with guests at the bar.  Within minutes, our sever came over to say hello and offered us drinks.  \n\nWe decided to order several appetizers because we love everything on the menu and thought that would be the easiest way to share a variety of things with our friend.  \n\nThe ceviche- to die for\nThe poki - fresh, delicious and beautifully presented\nThe clams in a choizo broth - Cooked perfectly and I soaked up every ounce of broth with the hot, delicious Boudin sourdough.\nThe prawns - yum! (if no one was looking, I may have licked the plate...)\nAll the desserts are made in house and are fabulous.  \nSeriously, everything is fresh and delicious at Fog Harbor.\n\nBetween the friendly service, the consistently scrumptious food, and the stunning view, Fog Harbor is not only a great place to take friends from out of town, but also a great excuse for San Franciscans to play tourist for the day!", "author": "L L."}

After seeing a lot of local fare on tv a few weeks prior and with my boyfriend not being much of a fish person thus meaning I get to eat it so infrequently, I figured I'd seek out one of the better restaurants on pier 39 to have a delicious fish dinner.\n\nWe sat by the window and had a gorgeous view of Alcatraz and the harbor, and most of the restaurant has this view even if you're not sitting at the window, so this is an excellent spot if you're a tourist and want the whole experience while you dine.\n\nI had the swordfish with chimichurri sauce. I'm seeing some photos here of that dish served with mixed greens in addition to the wild rice, but my vegetable was broccoli mixed with pearl onions and that was it. I love broccoli, but for such a delicious fish it seemed really lackluster in comparison, and the pearl onions didn't really do much to help. I would have much preferred asparagus, or at least for the broccoli to be anything other than steamed. I dipped it in the garlic sauce from my friends meal, big improvement, sad it wasn't better. \n\nThe swordfish steak, however, was perfectly tender and seasoned. I haven't had swordfish in years and after having read that their menu is sustainably caught I had to try it. It didn't disappoint!\n\nWe also got a sampling of their seasonal dungeness crab menu by trying the mango and avocado dungeness crab cocktail. The portion could feed one person as a meal it was so huge, and between the two of us we were concerned we wouldn't have enough room for our meals (but not in a bad way, we were loving every minute of it!). This appetizer was packed with crab and really showcased the ingredient in a deliciously fresh way.\n\nMy friend ordered the seafood platter which had clams, mussels and crab legs and claws in a garlic butter sauce. I'm not much of a shellfish person, but thanks to Fog Harbor, I now know it was simply because I hadn't had them done well, and these were so delicious I'm seriously wondering where garlic mussels have been all my life. If I were to return I would order this item in a heartbeat, and if you're a garlic lover, you'll absolutely love this!\n\nI look forward to returning and trying more from their menu, but given that their seasonal dungeness crab menu is for a limited time, I'd say definitely try something from that list if you go in the next few weeks, it all looks good!", "author": "Nicole D."}

Unfortunately, tickets to the prison were sold out so we made a day of it at Haight-Ashbury instead.  I made a reservation at Fog Harbor earlier that day and requested to have a window seat (after all, I heard the place overlooked Pier 39, so why not take advantage of the view)?  \n\nThis restaurant is definitely more of a tourist attraction than an authentic fish house, but we still thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  Our waitress was the sweetest older woman you'd ever met, and she went out of her way to make sure everything was spot-on.  The location of our table added to the romantic, special experience. \n\nTo start, we had the crab cake, clam chowder, and a salad.  The cake's consistency was perfect--dense with crab meat, lightly seared, accompanied with a red pepper aioli.  The clam chowder was thick, rich and..well...clammy (in a good way), and my boyfriend said the sourdough bread was divine.  I was bummed to hear that they were out of baby spinach...but the portion of romaine more than compensated for this. \n\nWe chose the whole dungeness crab for our entrees.  Ladies, if you're wearing a nice outfit, I'd opt for a different dish instead of this messy treat.  The seafood cioppono looked tasty, as did some of the cuts of meat.  We were bibbed for the big event and spent a good 15 minutes hacking away at the shells prior to digging in (our plan of attack:  shell all the meat before feasting).  The waitstaff kept our area clean, even as the shards of shell flew around us.  \n\nI wish that there had been more veggies on the plate, and the potatoes were a little runny for my taste.  We spent a good two hours enjoying our meals and each others company, never once feeling rushed to leave.  It was a good, solid meal for to conclude our adventure in San Fran.

Tried adding salt and pepper to make it better but still wasnt very good.  \n\nThe waiter was less than attentive, our glasses remained empty most of the time and never got a refill until same time we were getting the check, and had to ask for the refil.

I ordered the crab cake burger and it had a lot of bread crumbs and very little crab meat. They also added a lot of vegetable within the crabcake to fill up the crab burger. This was a really big let down. However, their clam chowder is amazing. It was a little thick and the flavor was perfect. I wished I ordered the sourdough bread bowl instead because the girl on the next table finished the whole thing. Also, I guess we were lucky because we had a table with an amazing view.

I may be kind of a food snob but I don't think I'm wrong here. Anyway we were in the area and starving and I saw that it had surprisingly good yelp reviews so we decided to give the harbor a try. It was quite a good experience. \nLet me start by saying that the waiting area is really nice. We had to wait a bit to get a table but it was an enjoyable time spent sitting on the couch by their fireplace outside.\nInside there was a really great view of the bay and Alcatraz. \nThey have a really great selection of seafood and I had a really hard time making a decision on what I wanted. I ended up getting the swordfish. It was cooked to perfection. I also loved all the seasonings and sides that came along with it. Though I have to say that on the menu it said that it came with a chimichurri sauce (which I was amazed to see paired with a seafood dish) but what was actually on it was nothing like a chimichurri sauce. It seemed like more of a parsley oil mixture. While it is probably for the best that they did not pair a intense sauce like that with a mild flavored fish, I think they should change the name on the menu.\nWe actually ended up getting charged for someone elses (much more expensive) bill, which was a pain. But the management was very nice about it so it all worked out in the end. \nSo if you end up being a tourist in SF and feeling hungry after hours of hanging out with the sea lions this is the place to go!", "author": "Ashley R."}

We needed dinner, and picked this place.  Good choice, all things considered.\n\nI ordered the Fog House Burger.  If you are going to put your restaurants name on it, it had better be good.  To be honest, I was expecting to be underwhelmed.  Let's face it, this place is in a tourist area and serves fish.  How good could it be?  Fortunately for me, this burger came out as ordered, with a perfectly toasted bun, caramelized onions and bacon on it.  The fixings (limp piece of lettuce, two slices of tomato and a couple of rings of onion) were ok.  The fries were hot and crispy, and they have malt vinegar (which I love on fries).  Overall, this was a well-executed burger, which surprised me.\n\nMy wife had the prawn ravioli.  We were expecting the prawns to be inside the ravioli.  However, the ravioli were cheese ravioli - tasty on their own.  The prawns were perfectly cooked, and the spinach was tasty.  The sauce was sweeter than expected, but very good.  My wife was mopping up the remains of the sauce with the supplied San Francisco sourdough (which was way too strong, as is normal).\n\nIf you find yourself down at Pier 39, you can do a lot worse than this place.", "author": "Adrian H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-15", "description": "My date and I came here for Valentine's Day. What I was most impressed about was how fast they were to attend to our reservation despite the fact that it was a full house, they were on schedule for those reservations (clearly I've had bad experiences with reservations in the past). The place was clean and had a nice environment. It was a place that you'd expect to look like since it was right by the sea. Our waiter was very nice, and the service was on point for the most part, however at the end it was kind of lagging. We received our food quickly from when we ordered our food, so that was really nice. I didn't expect it to be so prompt since it was a full house. Now onto their food! We ordered Choppino, clam chowder in a bread bowl, and fried combo platter. The Choppino was good, I found it to be a little salty, and was disappointed in the fact that the waiter didn't mention there was an extra fee of 4 dollars for having the crab without the shell (nor did I see it in the menu). I also was disappointed that in the Choppino, I only had two shrimps, and it was loaded with fish (probably to cut out on cost), but seriously for $28 you'd had better give more of a variety of the seafood. My dates fried combo was pretty good, but I didn't find it to be excellent. The fact that she only received two butterflied shrimp was ridiculous, and just to make the volume of the plate look bigger they load it with calamari, which if that was the case, my date stated \"I should've just went with the fried calamari and chips.\" The breading on the items on the plate was nice and light, I didn't find it to be overpowering and you could taste the seafood which was nice. Now for the best part of this experience....the clam chowder bread bowl. This was the highlight of the night, the clam chowder wasn't too thick nor was it too liquid, it was just right. The soup had the right amount of saltiness, it wasn't overbearing. I found that there was a lot of clams in it which was a huge plus, so they didn't cheat you off of that. The bread was delicious, crispy on the outside, nice and soft in the inside. If I go back it'll probably only be for the clam chowder, but overall experience was just alright, nothing to really go crazy over since the prices were pretty high for the kind of seafood they would serve in their dishes.", "author": "Justin P."}

Unfortunately, that place was already booked (place is called Navio located in Half Moon Bay; attempted to book reservation two weeks ago; no luck). Anyway, I must say that I'm so grateful to have found Fog Harbor Fish House.  This restaurant was going to be my backup plan B; however, should never be considered a plan B. This restaurant is the real deal. \n\nI booked a reservation at 9:15pm (used open-table) and right below reservation time I stated under special requests...this is my first time for the restaurant and personally wanted to see if any staff representative can label \"Happy anniversary\" on the table nearby a window for viewing and personally requested to buy a cake and have the plate labeled in icing \"Happy Anniversary Day\". Little did I know that they would actually do this; well turns out they granted all requests. My server was Pedro; hands out provided the best experience for my girlfriend and I. Thank you Pedro for a job well done.   \n\nMy girlfriend and I sat down at exactly 9:15pm as stated, anniversary in coloring on the table and a great view of the bay. Atmosphere like can be a little noisy, but that didn't bother me at all. Service is excellent and the food is superb. It's the real deal. My girlfriend got the lobster plate stuffed with crab for 35 dollars; it's worth every penny!!!! I got the halibut for 32 dollars; best tasty fish ever!!!!! They both are seasonal.\n\nMy girlfriend was speechless when she saw the \"Happy Anniversary\" in coloring on the side of the table. Toward the end, Pedro closed it by bringing a tiramisu cake, candle on top and with \"happy anniversary day\" labeled in icing for my girlfriend chanting Happy Anniversary Day. She was blown away!!!!!!!!!!  Even better, while I expected to pay for the cake (as listed on my special request through open table), I realized that the cake which was 8.50 was reimbursed as a manager compensation. I can't believe this tremendous service, outstanding food, gorgeous view of the bay and last but not least experience exceeded beyond my own expectations. Plan to come here more often.

No waters, no bread. Finally the server shows up.  Got our waters and ordered appetizers. Waters showed up and nope can't order main yet so our server can get a couple of people out of there first...Ok then..alright, he's back so we ordered our main courses just in case we don't see our server for another long while.  Kids get clam chowder bread bowls(they miss these since we did live in Monterey) and burgers & fries.  Hubby gets the linguine with crab added on top as recommended by our server.  I get the shellfish combo also recommended by our server. Appetizers showed up-poke & sliders were really good. Baked oysters-nothing special. Glass of Sauv. Blanc. maybe thins will get better? Finally had to ask for some bread & butter (SF sourdough should make up for something). Another family of 3 gets seated next to us.  \nAt this point, I'm envious of the table of 8 in front of us whose server is checking on them constantly.\nAppetizers gone, kids & I start to draw w/ the crayons they gave...waiting...waiting...\n\nand now The Ugly: family next to us got their food before us?  I watch another server take our food (had to be because that table were already ordering desert) to the table in front of us then walks away..Our server returns and asks,\"You guys ordered the bread bowls right?\" I say \"yes, but she went to the wrong table-the one in front\".  The poor girl apologizes to our server.  Not her fault she was given wrong directions.  Hubbies linguine arrives-no crab added so server asks the girl to have the crab added.  My shellfish plate arrives-I try a clam & mussle, oh great-it's cold.  Server takes it back saying well the bottom is warm..ok..girl server comes back with another bread bowl?  uh, not us.  Our server puts the bread bowl in front of me to start with until my plate is fixed.  Taste the chowder--oh my how much I miss my Monterey Old Fisherman's Grotto. The 14 year old eats it instead. BTW, the kids were starving after a long drive and golden gate bridge adventure.  Hubbies linguine comes back with crab on top all right.  They threw a pile of COLD crab on top of hot pasta?  Yuck.  Hubby is starving so he decided to just mix it all together to warm the crab. Shellfish mix shows back up-and now it's hot since according to our server he watched just come off the grill. I look down at what was my original plate just reheated so now the food is over done. Clams, crab and mussles are dried up. The shrimp were overcooked so they were tough-I gave these to the hubby.  The best part of this $35 plate-the corn on the cob.\nConsidering the price ($196) is about the same as our family usuals-Sardine Factory, the Whaling Station, Old Fisherman's Grotto, Saporo, etc., we were all very disappointed.", "author": "Josefina L."}

Luckily, two seats opened up at the bar. our waitress was great, super sweet and took really good care of us. i can't remember her name but she works at the bar and has great make up :). so we ordered drinks, i had chardonnay and the bf had an IPA. we ordered calamri as an appetizer. th e calamari was good but the main event was the shellfish platter for one and the bfs surf n turn. needless to say it was more than delicious. my boyfriend absolutely loved his steak and i was in heaven with the fresh shrimp and awesome crab. the little corn on the cob that came along with it was great also. i'm by no means a professional when it comes to eating crab. i get all messy and stain my shirt but i don't care!!! needless to say it took me a while to eat the crab but it was sooooo good and i had fun. our tab came out to 150 but it was sooo worth it! the service was truly great. \n\nsince this place is super busy on the weekend, i strongly recommend reservations. next time we hope to get  a table by the windows. also the best parking has to be the pier 39 structure since it directly connects the third floor to the restaurant and they validate. \n\nall in all, it was a great day in the city by the bay!", "author": "Cecilia G."}

It looked beautiful, but not even close to the best I've ever had.  The bread left a lot to be desired and the soup was just ok.  The service (sat at the bar) was good and so was the ambiance, but I would say if you're looking to show off the bay's famous clam chowder fare (like I was trying to do to my husband), head elsewhere.  We did enjoy a couple of other bar bites that were alright- I do recall a Shrimp app that we enjoyed, but it was definitely way spicier than what the average Joe could handle.\n\nThe real estate and drinks are what bumped up the rating to 3 stars, but in a city with tons of amazing eateries, this one is better left to the tourists who don't know any better (obviously none of which are Yelpers).", "author": "Gina S."}

We chose this restaurant because they advertise that they can make most of their dishes gluten free (we have food allergies in our family) and have marked those dishes on the menu.  \n\nThe first time we went I was served wine in a (very) dirty glass.  I told the server, and about 15 minutes later he brought me a new glass of wine.  \n\nThe second time we went was on the Sunday of a holiday weekend.  My wife and I both ordered their warm spinach salad, but the server told us that they had run out of spinach.  Really?  On a holiday weekend?  Seems like poor planning, but not that big of a deal.\n\nNo worries, we ordered some other dishes, and waited for our food.  And we waited, and waited, and waited.... After 40 minutes our server told us that the chef had made a mistake - I had ordered a gluten free dish, and the chef made prepared it improperly.  So I had the server bring the rest of the dishes and sat there and watched my family eat for 15 more minutes while they made my dish.\n\nFinally, after almost an hour, I got my tuna.  Admittedly, it was pretty tasty... but by that point I was hungry and in a bad mood, so anything would have tasted good. \n\nFor our trouble, the manager offered us 30% off during our next visit.  When I told him I was in the military and we were moving overseas and we wouldn't be back, he simply said, \"Okay, well, we'd still love to have you back.\"  Didn't offer to take care of our appetizers or take the 30% off of our bill that day... would have been a nice gesture.  \n\nThe view is nice, the food is above average, but the service is terrible.

My starter course was a cup of their clam chowder. Even better (I'm drooling thinking about it now). It made me wish I'd ordered the chowder in a bread bowl. For the main course I had the lemon sole with steamed veggies and mashed potatoes. I stuffed as much of it into me as I could, while savoring every bite.

Fog Harbor is a classy restaurant with gorgeous views in the middle of tourist central. I mean seriously, you can't get a better view than this! It also helped that after a gloomy summer, even by San Francisco standards, we had an epic weekend of beautiful weather!\n\nTo start we ordered the Red Chili Garlic Prawns and the Ahi Tuna 2 ways. The prawns were succulent and tasty and this dish definitely took me to the outer edges of my spice tolerance. The Ahi Tuna appetizer was sesame \"poke\" style with fried wonton and Cajun seared with cayenne aioli. The tuna on the crispy wonton with the creamy sauce was a cool and creamy antidote for my taste buds which were still recovering from the red chili garlic prawns.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the Salmon BLT served on a toasted french roll with a pesto aioli. I almost never finish an entire entree, but I couldn't put this thing down! Bacon truly is the miracle meat that goes great with just about anything. The sandwich came with fries and it was an extremely generous portion, I didn't come close to finishing all of them.\n\nMy dinner companion ordered the Garlic Roasted Crab, it's a roasted half crab cooked in a garlic herb butter. I didn't try this dish as I'm not much of a crab eater, but it was a sight to behold. It looks like a lot of work, but she is a gigantic crab fan and actually loves the whole process of cracking the thing open and pulling out every last tasty morsel.\n\nUsually at this point, I'm stuffed and dessert is out of the question, but we were in a mood to take it to the limit so we ordered the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was creamy, crackly and a perfect way to end the meal with a cup of coffee.\n\nNo complaints out of me when it comes to this place. It was such a beautiful day, the view was spectacular and the service outstanding. It's my pleasure to give credit where credit is due, these people work hard and I would seriously consider eating here the next time I hang with the tourists.", "author": "Nate R."}

The restaurant itself is beautiful--definitely a place to wine and dine someone special with a beautiful view of the bay (*hint hint* guys!). The servers are friendly and attentive, and they made sure my water glass was never left empty.\n\nI had the crab cakes and ahi tuna to start off with, and the crab cakes were by far some of the best I've had in San Francisco. They were moist, creamy, and had a great balance of breading and crab. The ahi tuna was okay--I didn't really care for the seared tuna; it was a little dry but the sesame poke with the wonton chips was delicious to snack on. \n\nI had the Mixed Grill with the salmon, mahi-mahi, and prawns, and I was worried that the fish would come out dry, but surprisingly, the fish was quite juicy and flavorful. I didn't care too much for the prawns though.\n\nFinally, I had the lava cake for dessert, and this is where the 5 star acclaim comes from. The chocolate lava cake was the BEST cake I have ever had. Drizzeled with a heap of warm gooey fudge and served with vanilla ice cream, each bite was a taste of what heaven should taste like. They could have served me dirt for the main course and this cake for dessert and I probably would have still been happy. \n\nAll in all, this restaurant was a pleasant dining experience. The prices are a bit steep but a seafood restaurant at the wharf with a view overlooking the bay will cost you a shiny penny.", "author": "Winnie T."}

I recommend you sit at the bar .. they were so cordial and down to earth, so \"san fransisco\" and so very helpful with drink selections... their seasonal drinks were recommended by Shanna and let me tell u she was spot on !

We actually left a $50 tip but he TOOK OUT all of our receipts and ADDED it in front of our faces and said we didn't tip him! That is rude and I've never had a waiter do that to me. We didn't want any trouble so we tipped another $50 because he was basically crying about it. I still can't believe he did that. I was dumbfounded.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-27", "description": "Well this was a pleasant surprise. After pounding the pavement all day as a tourist we just wanted a decent meal before heading home. I figured any restaurant on Pier 39 would be, more or less, a tourist trap and didn't expect much from Fog Harbor Fish House.\n\nWe had no reservation so they quoted a 45 minute wait. It was actually really nice lounging by their awesome outdoor fireplace and sipping drinks from the bar. But after an hour, we still weren't seated and I got cranky. When we finally got seated they plunked us down at what is clearly the worst table in the place: poor view, low to the ground, and uncomfortable seating. When the waitress asked how we were doing, I couldn't help venting a little bit, and she handled it politely and professionally.\n\nNow's where the good stuff starts. A few minutes later a guy comes to our table and says \"please follow me\". Apparently the waitress told the manager of our displeasure and he took matters into his own hands by moving us to a totally rad table with a killer view. We shot the shit with guy for a while since he once lived in Santa Cruz and suddenly we were in a much better mood!\n\nThe food was all fantastic. I think they make their own sourdough here as it was hot and fresh. I ordered the garlic roasted dungeoness crab which was huge and delicious. I think the kitchen will clean it for you for an extra charge, but I donned the bib and did all the work myself which was actually an entertainment of its own.\n\nFor my 7 year old daughter, they were happy to do a simple mahi over rice instead of fish and chips which was just perfect.\n\nIn retrospect, walking into a nice restaurant on a warm Saturday night in SF without a reservation was a dumb move on my part. They should probably be trying to overestimate the seating times rather than underestimate them, but people make mistakes.\n\nThe main takeaway for me is that 1) the staff here clearly gives a shit about their patrons 2) they communicate well enough to do something about it when someone's not happy and 3) the seafood here is awesome.", "author": "John S."}

One of my friends ordered lobster and lost her appetite bc I think she said there was lobster poop.  Lol.  I'm not a regular lobster eater so I wasn't sure if that was really what it was.

Crab Cakes: crunchy on the outside, so soft and moist on the inside. Its good for the appetizer and for the regular meal as well.\n\n2. Ahi Tuna: a BIG chunk of tuna (Seasoned on the outside of course). It was laying on a bed of wild rice and sauteed vegetables with this light soysauce/teriyaki flavor that just added soo much flavor to the tuna. if you are a tuna fan, you will LOVE IT!!! \n\n3. Fog harbor burger: My first \"sweet\" burger ever. This burger is so juicy and tender (i usually get it medium rare). the caramelized onions add such a bursting flavor into my mouth... and the saltiness of the bacon balances the taste.\n\n4. Prawn ravioli: i usually get this w/CIOPPINO (type of tomato sauce) sauce on top. I've noticed that the raviolis change in size once in a while from small to big-- but no matter what the size is... this dish will forever be my favorite pasta dish at Fog Harbor.\n\n5. Seafood Cioppino: This dish is VERY flavorful. I see alot of tourists trying out this dish but for me personally, i wish i could've just had all the seafoods out of its shell. I didnt even bother eating the crab legs because i didnt have tools to crack them with.. but everything else was easy to eat :) \n\nThe service is fantastic and the hosts are super friendly! :) :) \n\nOh and before i forget--- \nDessert recommendations: Lava cake and tiramisu!!!! I love the creme bruele.. but the caramelized topping can be often too chewy for me.\n\nENJOY! hope this helped!", "author": "Hanna K."}

We didn't even get a chance to ask for anything else. Maybe we should have left at that point. \n\nRegardless, we endured the way less than sub-standard service and waited 10 minutes for the check. To no avail I should add, we had to find the check. I left exact change for the appalling treatment I never had experienced before. We chose this place because of YELP and only reading the overall star status. We should have read ALL the reviews. I informed the \"manager\" of what happened just so he would have a knowledge of a horrific experience it was. I thought maybe that could be avoided for other customers.\n\nBoy was I wrong!!!!! Turns out the manager was the assistant and was stand offish. He would just nod his head and smirk like it was funny. Not one bit of sincerity on his face. I would recommend this Fog Harbor Fish House if you WANT to ruin your night. Thank you for ruining ours.", "author": "M G."}

We had crab cakes and clam chowder as an appetizer. The crab cakes were full of crab meat and not to much filler and the clam chowder was nice and thick, but not to thick.  I had the shellfish platter, my friend had the scallops, and my husband got the pacific sole. The food was all outstanding.  I was definitely having a hard time finishing my meal. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was for the service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-06-11", "description": "I usually only read review on yelp, this is my first review since I am so disappointed at such a highly rated restaurant.\n\nIt's our wedding anniversary last night and my husband want a special dinner for me. After reading so many positive yelp reviews, we decided to give it a try.\n\nFood - we ordered seafood cioppino, fish n chips and Garlic roasted whole crab. 2 out of 3 are disappointing. The only dish which is really GREAT is seafood ciopino. The shrimps, scallops are very fresh. You can feel its original freshness even with the strong flavor soup. Highly recommended.\nFor Fish n chips, the chips are ok but the fish is obviously overcooked and very very oily. The MOST DISAPPOINTING dish is our MOST PRICEY dish- garlic roasted crab. Once I cracked the shell and trying to take out the meat, from the meat texture, I could tell it's NOT FRESH. My husband verified that since he only tasted the garlic and butter from the crab NOTHING MORE! For me, it's even worse, it's completely tasteless, maybe with a little bit of garlic flavor. But we shouldn't pay $37 for garlic and butter!! We had crab several times before from Nick's Lighthouse food stand. We can tell the difference. Nick's crabs are so fresh and with minimal processing, no garlic no butter, the meat alone is already so tasty. Our conclusion is NEVER get CRAB at FISH House. Even the crab in the seafood cioppino is tasteless. From meat texture to taste, you can definitely tell the crabs are NOT FRESH!\n\nService- we are surprised to have ALL our dishes coming out AT ONCE. I don't know if that's standard practice for seafood restaurant or not. But to us, this is SO WRONG. After we finish fish n chips(the most time sensitive dish), the rest were already cold as ice. Besides that, the service is ok, not very attentive but will do when you ask. \n\nAmbiance- the view is unbeatable, 5 stars.\n\nOther- this's the first time I saw \"SF Emp Ord 4%\" from my bill.we paid anyway. I have no clue what the heck is that. After I google it, I felt like being scammed. Why should I pay for the restaurant employee's health insurance?!That should be the restaurant's responsibility! Does that mean they treat their employees like dirt so customers have to do what they don't to keep their employees live a normal life? They don't pay insurance, customers are obligated to pay for them. They pay waiters poor salary, customers have to pay a large sum to cover it(I DO think tips are necessary for rewarding good service, just don't like it when it become obligation even for poor service) And if that really helps the employees get better health insurance, I feel better with that. But according to Wall Street Journal, mostly are just scammer and go to restaurant. I don't know about this restaurant.\n\nConclusion-It's very unlikely we will return. If we do, we will NEVER order any crab again", "author": "Kolen C."}

The food was very fairly priced and generally did not disappoint.  We ordered cocktails, clam chowder, crab cakes, lobster fettuccine, Salmon, Tuna, and a steak.  My husband ordered the steak, and requested medium and it came barely pink.  That's generally OK because most places will happily prepare another steak, to your preferred doneness.  This is where things got a little odd.  The waiter happily took back the steak, but another employee came over with a photo of my husbands steak on their cell phone, asking if this is how he wants it done.  The photo made the steak look more red than it did in person (lighting? filters?) and we're like \"sure, that looks better.\"  Then this employee says, \"well, that's your steak, and that's how we prepare medium.\"  That was such a ridiculous and bizarrely unprofessional way of telling the customer that they are wrong.  Just make the steak, ok?  \n\nOverall, the service was friendly and fun.  However, another strange moment was when our server brought us our check.  He placed the check on the table, and made sure to point to the bottom where it states gratuity percentages.  Reading out, I kid you not, each percentage, each amount of money, along with a note as to how he might have earned each percentage.  Like, \"15% if I..., 18% if I...\"  I was almost embarrassed for the waiter who thought that this was a proper thing to say to guests.

They should've comped us more for having to wait as long as we did and not tell us there's no wait without considering parking time and walking to the restaurant.", "author": "Shivs B."}

I went with four guests on a Sunday night. We were seated in about 40 minutes when we were told 20 minutes and after we ordered it was over an hour before our dinner arrived. The waiter and the manager came over to our table several times and apologized. We were starving and were not offered bread and my drink from the bar was never refilled. When our food finally did arrive my table mates ate very quickly and were done before I really even started on my pasta which turned out to be cold and flavorless. The 1/2 crab on top was divine, however. The three other plates were cleared before I even touched my food as I was waiting for our waiter or manager to come so that I could tell him. The manager apologized and brought me a chicken ceasar salad as I requested because I didn't want to have my table mates sitting watching me eat which would have made me feel very awkward. The manager ended up taking my meal off and giving us a discount because it took so long. My dinner the next day was great because I had the crab that I would have had with the pasta the night before. Everone else said that the food was good but they couldn't really tell because they were so hungry! The entire experience took about 2.5 hours with probably 5 minutes or less being taken to actually eat. \nI will be back to try Fog Harbor again and I hope that I won't be going on a busy night.", "author": "Janelle R."}

Most of the food at Pier 39 is greasy tourist crap, but this place is actually pretty good. Overall the seafood is fresh and tasty. I wouldn't go so far to say that this is the best seafood I've ever had but it's been my go to place for seafood in SF. You want to make sure to book a reservation a day or two in advance unless you're ok with having dinner at 4:00. The reason I took off a star is that although the staff is friendly they're pretty inexperienced. They're going to forget to bring you water. And bread. And that extra lemon you asked for 15 minutes ago. It's a fact. No matter which server you get. But if you're patient and persistent enough you will eventually get those things and your order. Last time we were there I told them on the reservation that it was our anniversary so they decorated the table with flowers, a candle, and they wrote happy anniversary on the paper table cloth. It was really sweet and I enjoyed that extra care.", "author": "Elizabeth R."}

We usually just eat at the crab stands at Fisherman's Wharf.  We move out of state and just happened upon this place on one of our visits because of the free parking validation (lol 2nd time that happened to us).  We were actually looking for the Crab House, but found this place first.  When we got there, it had a cute entrance with a lil fireplace and seating out front.  We were seated right away and got to sit by the window overlooking the sea lions.  Our waitress was very nice and it was a beautiful day in The City so the window was opened and we could feel the nice Bay breeze.  I ordered the lobster tail with fingerling potatoes and broccoli and hubby ordered the crab pot.  We ordered crab cakes for appetizer and they were so huge and so delicious!  Hands down best crab cakes I've ever had.  I was expecting our portions to be small, but my lobster tail was as big as my arm and so tasty.  Hubby devoured his crab, potatoes, and corn and said it was more than enough for his big appetite.  The check was reasonable too, it was a very good dining experience and will definitely return next time we are back in the Bay for my hubby's bday next weekend :)  When we left there was a 15 minute wait because it got so packed, we were lucky we got there when we did.", "author": "K M."}

I chose the steamed method with just saut\u00e9ed vegetables. If you enjoy the inside of the crab, let your waiter know that you would like them to steam it whole and not to break it open and clean it out. The best part of the crab is inside. It reminds me of crab bisque. Grab a spoon and dig in! A tip to the kitchen: if someone orders it like this, serve it with the legs up and do not crack open the body shell so the \"soup\" doesn't drain out. You can also dip your crab meat into it for a luxurious flavor. The drawn butter is good too just like with snow or king crab legs. The crab was steamed to perfection and the meat is sweet and juicy. Fog Harbor receives crab deliveries every day, freshly caught off the California coast, transported in ocean water filled tanks, held until you order it up. You can't get anything fresher than that! The vegetables were saut\u00e9ed to perfection -crisp with a wonderful butter flavor. Add a little salt and pepper and you're good to go. Thumbs up, way up!", "author": "Chelsea M."}

We left the window slightly cracked so the breeze blew in. We had the sunset and the views and on top of that some amazingly fresh seafood. \n\nThe waitress was even so sweet to give me an extra glass of wine on the house since the wine I first requested had run a bit low and she couldn't get a full glass out of it. Try getting that just anywhere! The meal was wonderful, the view was wonderful and the service was outstanding. \n\nThis was one of those places that living in Texas, I really could appreciate because we don't get those same views. Nice views from certain places, but completely different. I didn't even mind hearing the seals outside.

We had a lifeless server who seemed to have way too much going on for her to handle. In the end she did not deliver our food  or for that matter bring us our check.

My husband had the Fried Combo, which includes fish, calamari, shrimp, french fries, and cole slaw.  It was like fried seafood heaven!  I tried some of his calamari and it was perfectly cooked, not chewy at all, and lightly breaded.  Yum.  My father-in-law had the Seafood Cioppino (crab, fresh fish, shrimp, scallops, clams and mussels in tomato broth, with or without pasta).  They even offer to crack the crab for you, for a few bucks extra, which gets you more crab meat.  It looked fantastic!  And lastly, my mother-in-law got the Fish & Chips, which had an incredible beer batter.  Also, I must highlight that the coleslaw was fantastic:  crunchy cabbage and not overly creamy.  The views of the bay are also beautiful and we enjoyed snapping shots of Alcatraz from our table. It also has a classy, relaxed atmosphere that was even nicer than I imagined from the reviews and price range designation.

Gloppy, gritty, and devoid of any authentic flavor does not define greatness. The crab cakes were atrocious -- almost all filler and no nice crust from a proper own fry -- the purveyors should be embarrassed to offer those. The lobster in the lobster mac n cheese was overcooked. Hint: if you fully cook a lobster and then put it in hot mac n cheese and then put it under the broiler, it will turn horribly chewy.

A group of 20-25 of us came to eat here while we visited San Francisco.  They sat us right away in the bar section,  but since we had a 1 yr old we could not sit in the high table and chairs we had to sit in the booths right next to everybody else.  We were asked to leave our strollers outside since they said strollers were not allowed inside the restaurant.  The waitress named Jack served and was very nice but we asked her for a high and said they had NO high chairs.  We opted to leave and go to another place but we roughed it out and had to sit our son on our laps and just take turns holding him.  Since my son was getting fussy we asked Jack again, \"You really don't have high chairs or even a booster seat?\"  She proceeded and said No they have none and she didn't know why.  \n     I then needed to take my son to restroom to change him and approached the hostess and asked her if they had changing tables and she didn't know since she's never used the restroom here and she also asked her nearby coworker and she didn't know either.  So I had to walk outside,  downstairs and wait in this long line just to change my son.  \n    When we got back our food was served and while we were trying to enjoy our food I see a man walk right in the restaurant with a stroller.  I never saw that stroller e brought out.  So I told my husband I was going to the restroom and as I was walking to the restroom of of the restaurant I saw a child in a high chair and a stack of high chairs near the restroom.  \n    I was very angry and very hurt that I felt we were treated different and my son got and us got cheated out of a good experience.  My husband talked to the manager who was very nice and apologetic and explained that they do have have high chairs but just not in the bar area since its a fire hazard.  I totally understood that but that wasnt was told to us and we weren't even given the option to move to a different table where high chairs were permitted.  We brought a lot of business that day and all we got was an apology and that's it.  It doesn't take back from our horrible experience and the fact that we didn't get to enjoy our food because we had to keep passing our son back and forth so we can eat.

Our last experience at Fog Harbor featured the best seafood and the worst service we've had in all of those years.  The food was simply outstanding.\n\nWhen we were seated (after a 15 minute wait despite our reservation) there was a window open at our table (the table was immediately adjacent to the window).  Anyone who has been to Pier 39 knows how strong and cold the wind can be there.  The wind was so strong that it immediately blew both of our menus off the table!  It was so cold that we were flapping our arms for fear of numbness.  The waiter's response when I explained that we needed to shut the window: \"I'll check with my manager.\"  The cretin who she referred to as a manager came to our table and told us that he needed airflow in the restaurant and could not close the window.  We asked for an \"indoors\" seating and were given another table.  Sure enough, 10 minutes after we sat down at the new table we looked over and found that all of the windows had been closed.  So much for \"needing airflow\".  At our new table, the waiter took our drink orders and then forgot about us (she literally never returned).  After 15 minutes, I flagged down another waiter and asked what happened.  Ten more minutes of waiting produced a 3rd waiter with our drinks and an explanation that our first waiter was a \"floater\" who was used only to substitute for other wait staff when they were eating their own meals.  I have to stop this review now - there were more service problems, but just recounting them is making my blood pressure too high.\n\nDespite the great food, I would never recommend this place and would never go back --there are so many other good restaurants at Pier 39 that know something about service.", "author": "Martin M."}

She cut me off a few times, didn't bring crayons out for my daughter to color and when she brought out the \"birthday dessert\" she told my guests \"uh aren't you guys gonna sing?\" because apparently the waiters don't sing. She also promised my husband that the dessert would be on the house but they charged us for it which I didn't realize until we already left and it was too late. Also she was rushing us when the bill came and said \"I need to know how much is cash and how much is card\" and was hovering over us until I told her to come back and wait until we figured that part out.

I also regret not complaining to her manager but I didn't want to make a big deal in front of my guests.  \n\nI would've given a higher rating if the food was good but I ordered the lobster and I was not at all impressed.

It was a nice touch and probably nets them a fair bit of business. \n\nI liked the  atmosphere with staff in crisp white shirts and aprons and a simple, classy decor. They had a nice little happy hour menu with appetizers and drinks, but I was in need of a full lunch. So they sat me at a table with a very nice view (which wasn't difficult - except for a few seats at the bar, every table in the house seems to have a good view). \n\nThe waitstaff was very pleasant and efficient, especially Monica, who was friendly and attentive. I'm not normally a big fan of clam chowder but I'd heard good things about Fog Harbor's, so I gave it a try. It was very nice - buttery, creamy, and with just the right amount of potatoes and clams. San Fran sourdough was simple but good, especially with the soup. I could've eaten the chowder, bread, and beer for lunch and been perfectly content. But I was keen to try the seafood, so I got the mixed fried seafood plate. It seemed like the best match for the Anchor Steam I was already drinking. The fish, shrimp, and calamari were good (but not great or special). And my one complaint about this place is proportions. One would think a combo plate of three items would have the items in roughly equal proportion, not one piece of fish, two fried shrimp, and a giant mound of calamari, so that was a bit disappointing. \n\nTwo managers stopped by during my meal to ask if everything was good, and while I toyed with registering my minor complaint, I decided I'd prefer to enjoy my meal rather than raise such a minor quibble.

Some of us ordered the crab melt. The crab was delicious and the fries were hot and crispy. The bf ordered the crab louie...it was huge! He ate the crab and said it was good. My niece ordered the fried combo (shrimp, calamari and deep-fried fish)...another big portion. I didn't try any but everyone else did so it must have been good.\n\nAll in all a pleasant dining experience. Great service. Good food. Great view. The best company.

When the waitress came she was abrupt and pretty rude.  We ordered our wine and the oyster appetizers.  The oysters were small and I've had better quality at the super market.\n\nFor dinner my bf ordered the rib eye and I had the seared prawns over linguine with the house salad to start.  When the salad came it was WILTED spring mix, two cherry tomatoes, one slice each of red onion and cucumber, and super stale croutons.  The food took a long time after that.  The steak was ok, nothing special and my pasta tasted worst then a noodle roni dinner.  I've had much better frozen food from Trader Joes.\n\nWe didn't order dessert bc we didn't want to waste anymore time or money.

The atmosphere is very nice. A great place for a date. Because we made an online reservation, we were treated to a complementary amuse bouche which was very good. For an appetizer, we had the crab cakes, which were amazing. The main course was a little disappointing. To be fair, perhaps ordering a crab melt and fries at a restaurant of this sort was my own fault, but my thinking was that they must be able to have an interesting and fancy take on this relatively lower class meal. I was wrong. It was just a regular greasy crab melt that I could have got anywhere on Fisherman's Wharf. It still tasted fine, but I was disappointed. My companion's meal was a much more classical fish dish, and looked quite scrumptious. Taken all together, I'd say our evening here warrants the 4 stars I've given them.", "author": "Stephen C."}

Being California, there's always some nonsense like this going on that people are forced to deal with. I will leave it to you to investigate the origins of this surcharge, but the bottom line is that restaurants are not, in fact required to apply this charge, and their reason for doing so amounts to a political temper tantrum at customer's expense.

It arrived in a plain white bowl garnished with some parsley that did not seem very fresh.  On the menu it said that the chowder was award winning but my guest and I did not feel that it was great.  The soup was not hot enough when it came out so I felt that it was slightly older.  My guest commented that he had a couple pieces of clam where that was sand.  I however did not come across any sand.\n\nThe second appetizer was the crab cakes.  I felt that the crab cakes were well made and had a good flavor.  I felt that the crab was fresh which is very important, especially for a restaurant located on the pier.  With that said, I'm not sure about the salad that accompanies the crab cake.  The salad had a good dressing that was somewhat tart and a little spicy.  It was very good but overpowered the natural flavors of the crab.  By itself, the crab cake is good but I would suggest pairing it with a salad that has a lighter dressing that can enhance the flavors of the crab more rather than over power it.\n\nOur final appetizer was the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail and it was actually our favorite.  The shrimp was fresh and large.  It was served in a martini glass filled with cocktail sauce and the cocktail sauce was perfect!  It had just the right blend of horseradish in it and it was delicious.  I would definitely order this dish again.\n\nEntrees:\nMy husband ordered the whole lobster and it was served with two sides - mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.  He said the corn on the cob was very good.  The mash potatoes were good also but compared to the corn, it wasn't as memorable.  The lobster was fresh and \"sweet\".  It was a little on the smaller side but adequate since we had a few appetizers. \n\nI got the shrimp scampi.  The shrimp was in an oval dish filled with oil, garlic, and parsley with tons of shrimp.  The rest of the plate was filled with wild rice and fresh vegetables.  Instead of the mash potatoes and I requested wild rice.  \n\nI was extremely pleased with the wild rice because I felt that it went very well with the shrimp.  The vegetables were abundant and I was only able to eat about one third of it.  Now onto the shrimp - it was delicious and nicely flavored.  The shrimp was cooked just right and was very crisp.

It was my husband, my 22 year old son, 18 year old daughter and myself. My son was late for our reservation as he got stuck in traffic. We checked in with the hostess 10 minutes before our reservation time and explained to her that he was going to be late. She suggested that we wait in the lounge area for him and let her know when he arrived. Beautiful lounge area, nice couches and fireplace! We had a cocktail and really enjoyed sitting by the fire.\n \nWhen he arrived we were seated at a nice table with a view of Alcatraz. We sat there for a very long time before we were ever acknowledged. When our waitress finally came over to our table she took our drink and appetizer order and tried to get us to order our meal at the same time. I had some questions and hadn't decided what I wanted yet. I asked her a couple of questions and also asked what she recommended.  She was very vague with her answer and went away without really recommending anything. From that point on the only time she came to our table was when she had something to drop off. She took our dinner order when she brought the calamari (which was the highlight of the meal by the way). She never came by to check on us our ask how our meals were. 3 of us had leftovers that we wanted to bring home and when we finally got her over to ask for boxes it was obvious that 3 plates still had quite a bit of food left on them and she asked if 1 box was okay!  She never offered us dessert (and it was my birthday! Although she did not know that, and she also did not know that my daughter had baked cupcakes for me that were waiting at home). I saw her and the rest of the wait staff bring a large tray of beautiful desserts to other tables to see and decide what they wanted to order. I really wanted to see the desserts up close but we were not given that opportunity.\n\n It really didn't appear that she was treating her other tables this way, she seemed much more attentive to her other tables than she was to us which left us feeling that for some reason she just didn't like us!\n\nThe food was good, not spectacular, but the poor service outweighed the food by a long shot! We would not go back here for a meal but would definitely go back to the lounge area for cocktails and appetizers as it was very warm and inviting!", "author": "Vickie S."}

We ended up with the crab salad and fish and chip combo plate.  All of the seafood was EXTREMELY fresh and by far the best calamari I have EVER had.  Although we had a couple of hiccups with the order, the staff went over and above to make sure that we received the best experience.  Not only did the server Rudy say to us several times \"We strive for perfection at Fog Harbor\" but the manager came over to us and personally apologized for any problems with the meal.

It was on such a Saturday that we discovered Fog Harbor Fish House.\n\nHaving grown up around here I have a fairly typical disdainful attitude about 'tourist trap' type places, I have to tell you, I was pleasantly surprised by my experience here.  The prices were not nearly as bad as I expected (about $30/person with drinks but without dessert) and the food was actually quite tasty.  It was here that I had my first experience with oysters, and raw ones at that! The cocktail sauce served with them had just the right amount of sinus clearing heat, the oysters themselves were very fresh and delicious. \n\nBetween the three of us we had the seared tuna salad, a pasta dish and a burger, we were well satisfied with our meal.  The wine list had several pleasant options and the view was, of course, spectacular.  It was one of those rare days when the sun was shining, the sky was clear and the water was sparkling, the perfect day to enjoy a table by the window, which we did. There was a bit of a miscue at the beginning of the meal, we hung out in the bar while waiting for our table and despite being there for about 15 minutes never did manage to get one of the bar tenders to take our drink order.\n\nWhat made our experience though was our server, Jay, apparently it was his first weekend there (though not his first weekend as a waiter), he was quick, attentive without hovering, friendly and funny.\n\nWhile I don't often spend time in this part of town you can bet that the next time I have visitors we'll make our way back here.", "author": "Renae H."}

I ordered the crab melt and my hubby got the fried calamari.  Half way through my crab melt, I started tasting vomit in my mouth.  The vomit taste was so real that I seriously thought maybe I vomitted in my mouth and I just didn't know it.  So, I ate few more bites and the taste got worse so I had my husband taste the crab melt and he said the seasoning tasted bad on the melt.  I also got a stomach ache from the crab melt that afternoon.  My hubby couldn't finish the fried calamari because it was way too acidy.  I am very disappointed at their food.  Our waiter never came back to check on us after bringing the food to the table nor did he refil our water and drinks.", "author": "Chris R."}

This place is upstairs at Pier 39 and one of the first restaurants as you enter.  The prices are reasonable and the food was more than satisfying as well as plentiful.  We shared a shrimp cocktail, served in a good sized martini glass.  There were a few  European lettuce leaves on the bottom (for color but it still tasted good covered in sauce!) and a ton of bay shrimp in cocktail sauce.  That alone with bread could be a meal for me!  Dale ordered a beer and the Fog Harbor Hamburger.  It was huge (Niman Ranch 1/2 lb patty) bacon, jack cheese, carmelized onions and a tasty Chipotle Thousand Island Dressing.  I had the Fish & Chips, three big pieces of fish (I think it was Cod) moist on the inside with a beer batter cooked to perfection - nice crunch with every bite!  We both got a mess of fries with our meals and I got some coleslaw that tasted homemade.  The coleslaw had red bell pepper that gave it a nice sweetness but I thought it had a little too much mayo.  Our server, Marilyn was the best and made sure that we had whatever we needed at all times.  She remembered everything like when I asked her for mustard for my fries when we ordered.  It's servers like her with a confident and positive attitude that make dining more enjoyable.  Overall, we had a nice lunch with a great view.  Also, they have a very nice fireplace and sitting area outside.  I'm sure that area is for people waiting for a table but I wouldn't mind sitting there to have a drink - not sure if that's allowed tho!", "author": "Ruthie V."}

My boyfriend ordered the crab cake dinner and I got linguine with clams. My boyfriend's crab cakes were burnt and cold when they came out. The menu description for my linguine should have said \"small portion of linguine and a couple clams.\" For $18 it was way overpriced for pasta and literally like three clams.

Very good service, lovely view and the dungeness crab cocktail and ahi lomi lomi appetizers we had were excellent. The halibut on the special that night, however, wasn't. It was perfectly cooked, moist but rather tasteless. Halibut is a fish that can soak up sauces and be flavored as the chef determines. This was just cooked with a few tomatoes on top and some quinoa underneath neither of which added any taste. When we told the waitress that we had had better halibut she was quite nice about it and a minute or two later the matre de was at our table asking what we didn't like about the halibut. We told him, he thanked us for our feedback, adding that usually the halibut is the most praised item on the menu, and comped us a dessert of our choice.

Fog Harbor seemed to be a yelp favorite so we decided to take the short 3-5 minute walk from Pier 33 and try it! The crackling fireplace at the entrance was warm and inviting and the floor to ceiling views of the marina were gorgeous. The fried calamari was the BEST we've ever had... that's saying a lot since we ALWAYS order calamari when dining out. My sister loved the fish & chips and said it was 10x better than Gladstone's in Malibu. So why the four stars? They dropped the ball on the clam chowder :- ( I'm not much of a fan for an overwhelmingly clammy aftertaste nor do I jump for joy for undercooked potatoes.

Couple of snivels; comes served with a piece of sourgough on top that is over-oiled and gets soggy in the sauce right away.  I would discourage this presentation technique.

Then, we split the Chili Lime Shrimp Salad and the classic clam chowder in a sourdough bread bowl. It was the perfect amount of food for two people. The salad was delicious - the shrimp were prepared perfectly and there was just enough of hte dressing - and while the chowder in the bread bowl wasn't knock-your-socks-off, it complemented the sourdough bread perfectly and really allowed you to taste the bread, which was the best I had while I was in San Fran. \n\nWe only had about an hour to eat, which we let our server know in advance, and we were done within 50 minutes.

I was on business and stopped in for a nice meal but apparently they don't think a single person is worth any attention. I was seated right next to the door so whenever people were leaving or entering (which was every few minutes) a cold gust of wind would hit me. The waitress, Brenda, also did not seem I was good enough for attention so she barely provided service. I received my salad first, which the romaine hearts were brown at the tips so I had to cut them off. Then the wine that came several minutes later had visible lint around the whole goblet. The water with lemon I asked for never came. The main dish was okay, but the fish was dry around the edges. Not the food I expected right on the water. After asking 2 more times for water and already halfway through my meal, a manager stopped by and asked how my meal was. I told him that I was still waiting for the water I asked for 3 times. He quickly brought out water and I was grateful. After another few minutes, I finally see Brenda with a glass of water (no lemon) and she scowled as she saw that there was a glass already on my table. She took my water to someone else and I heard her ask very loudly if anyone else would like water....really? With an empty water glass in front of me, Brenda drops off my check - which I had not yet asked for. I really wanted to leave no tip because I felt so unwanted by Brenda but my guilt took over and I left her a around 17%. When I got up to leave, Brenda stood there and said nothing to me (not even a \"have a good night\"!) As I was pushing the door, I looked back to see Brenda opening the check book in front of my table to see what tip I left her. At that moment I really wish I would have left her nothing and should have asked for a discount based on horrible attitude and treatment from Brenda. Truly despicable. I am never going to return.

My husband and dad both got the swordfish, which they raved about. I got the special, which was a gumbo with vegetables and rice topped with a filet of salmon and grilled shrimp. The salmon was like butter on the inside, and had a deliciously seasoned and seared outside. I also had a fresh squeezed lemonade with ginger. Not overly sweet like most lemonades, just perfect.

I think this is the first meal I have ever had at Pier 39 (aside from maybe a breadbowl of chili from a Boudin cart when I was a kid).  We were done up all cute and knew we stood out like sore thumbs, but so what.  We're local and we can play tourist if we want to.  In all fairness, we were in the area to see a show across the deck, but I'm really glad we stopped in to Fog Harbor for dinner first.\nThe views ARE great - we looked out onto the boats at the pier and Alcatraz in the distance.\nThe service was a bit crap - absentee and completely non-engaging or interested; Lizzie noted that the other tables were getting much friendlier service.\nThe food was solid.  Is it expensive?  I dunno, the prices seemed pretty standard for SF prices to me, especially given its waterfront location - everywhere with views is a little pricier.  If I recall it was almost $90 for the three of us - we didn't order that much food, but did have wine.\nThree of us split a bottle of Pinot Grigio and shared our food.  Originally, we were all going to order the exact same thing - the halibut with herb butter, wild rice and veggies, which is why I had to branch out a bit.  I ordered the chili garlic prawns which were fight over worthy.  We must've eaten an entire loaf of the nice hot sourdough bread they give you just sopping up all the broth to be sure we didn't miss any of it.  I also got the spinach salad which was totally skippable.  \nLiz did not like her fish, rice or veggies and left a bit unfulfilled.  Mel and I however seemed more into it.  I actually thought it was pretty damn tasty and ate all of my share with no problem - the fish was cooked perfectly, the rice was a good texture and the veggies weren't swimming in oil or butter and were also cooked well.\nI would absolutely eat here again and I really think it's an excellent bet for any tourists in the area.  Just keep in mind that entrees are $20-$30 - McDonald's pricing it is not, but it's totally in line with SF and a waterfront property at that.  Also, try not to have a heart attack at the 3.5% health surcharge which is much higher than most other spots in the city.", "author": "Jennifer D."}

I was on a Tour Bus with 50 senior citizens, some with handicaps and walkers.  They paid in advance for the bus, the theater and the restaurant.  They had a reservation and when we got there the tables were still empty.  The bus,because of heavy traffic, was late by about 10 minutes and the management refused to honor a reservation for this party that was made months ago.  The people did not have time for lunch and this restaurant did not even try to compensate these people when they refused to honor the reservation after many of these old people walked up the stairs and were tired.  At least they should have asked some of the elderly people if they wanted water or a piece of bread etc before they sent them away with no food and no recommendation of a place where 50 people could go at 5:20 pm.  They were told via phone that the bus was late due to traffic and when got to the restaurant and the tables were still empty and we sat down to be served.    We were told we had to leave and they would not serve us.  This is totally unacceptable behavior for any restaurant management to take and commit to serve a part y of 50 and then refuse because they come in 10 or 15 minutes late. .  Do not go to this restaurant.  There are 100's of excellent restaurants in San Francisco.  Leave this off your list.", "author": "Estelle K."}

Also, I was away from the table when the food was served but my party noticed the coleslaw had hair in it and sent it back.  Sadly there was no apology but new coleslaw was bought.  Finally I had to flag down a bus boy to get ketchup since none was delivered with the fries and the server never came back.

I am local to SF Bay Area, and I am usually unusure about seafood restaurants located on a touristy spot like Pier 39.  I read the Yelp reviews, and I am glad we went.  This restaurant is excellent - from the courteous/helpful team that answers their phone reservation, the food, their wait staff, and chefs.  The view is fantastic with Alcatraz and the East Bay right across.  They even provide you with a free 2-hr parking on the Pier 39 Garage!   The food - everything is good.  Their fish is cooked properly so that it is still juicy.  My daughter had the Filet Mignon, and she said it was excellent and properly cooked.  My 83 year old mom and 91 year old Father-in-Law loved their mixed grill seafood dish.  The only minor improvement is the asparagus needs to be a bit more crunchy (i.e. not too soft).   The desserts are awesome (we had the creame brulee and Tiramisu).   I also think their price is quite reasonable given the quality of their food, service, and location - I hope it stays that way.  This place has a great staff who are really attentive to their customers.   A special shout-out to our wait staff, Veronica, and the front desk hostess team (especially Ashley who helped me with the reservation)!

Then when our waiter took our order, he failed to ask if we wanted anything to drink besides the water that finally showed up, so he lost a sale on that.  Then after he took our order, we never saw him for another 10-15 minutes.  A long time between the chowder and the main meal.  Never brought us the famous sourdough bread he promised.

I like how they give customers a sample of wine without asking or anything, which I guess is a form of marketing. The clam chowder s really good, creamy and chunky, although there isn't really anything about it that makes it particularly any better than other places. Their baked oysters look really good, on a bed of sea salt, but it tasted slightly weird. I didn't enjoy it as much as I had anticipated. For the entree, I had the cioppino, and I have to say, it was really, very good. I like my foods more on the acidic side, so the tang of the tomatoes were perfect for me. There is a lot of crab meat, the serving size is fairly large, and the celery in it was dynamite. The fish in the cioppino was alright, some pieces better than others, so the consistency wasn't always there. The crostini that comes with the cioppino was kind of small, but was rubbed with great herbs and spices.

When you arrive you are greeted by a host or hostess and are told you can wait for your table in the outdoor patio area. This area is a great lounging set up complete with a table for your drinks and a beautiful waterfall for ambience. I was promptly seated even though the pier was quite busy and it was mid evening. One of the big attractions is a wall of windows that face the bay. This offers A great view while you enjoy your dinner. Our properly dressed waiter introduced himself and offered to get drinks and an appetizer for my family and I. We quickly received our refreshments and a wonderful bread basket accompanied with soft butter. Our calamari appetizer arrived shortly after that. Both the bread and calamari were excellent starters for our dinner. Our empty plates were taken and exchanged with our entrees of the night. My girlfriend had ordered the clam chowder bread bowl, I ordered the swordfish plate. The bread bowl lived up to its name, a classic San Francisco must. The sword fish was wonderfully cooked and served with delicious potato fingerlings and saut\u00e9ed shallots. Both plates expressed a wonderful presentation of placement and color. Unfortunately we were in a hurry and did not get to experience dessert. The staff at fog harbor seem well dressed and organized. I did not see many dirty tables waiting to be cleaned and reset. Our waiter promptly brought us our check and offered to validate it since we had used the parking garage. There was a problem with our ticket and it took longer than usual.

The mango salsa which came with it complemented the white mahi-mahi well.

I got the linguini and clams which compared to bistro boudin had much more variety. There were bigger clams and sun dried tomatoes in it, along with a piece of bread on top with red pepper flakes and regular pepper. It also had parmesan cheese already mixed in instead of on top, and it was very delicious however the parmesan on top tasted much better. Along with the clams in the shells, there were also smaller clams not in the shells spread around, and these clams were not crunchy, which I like. This place is great and highly recommended. Quick tip: the restaurant looks tiny from the outside but is gigantic on the inside, and it looks under staff compared to the size, so get there early or else you will definitely have to wait a very long time for the food, but it will not be a long wait at all for a table.

I love crab and this is crab had that underlying sweetness that only fresh crab has.  The sour dough bread was spectacular.  It was from Boudin across the street, they get it half baked and then they finish the process in their kitchen.  I had eaten at Boudin and they surprising serve their bread cold,  as a native San Franciscan that is not the way the bread should be served in a restaurant.  My husband had the half of garlic crab that he enjoyed to.  I look forward to going back. I think their prices are normal for the type of food they serve which is upscale.", "author": "Deanna M."}

There were many other people in same position as us and the manager was aware off situation was he came out many times to see hostesses.

My husband was in a mood for a \"broiled seafood\" type of dish and since they had something similar we decided to go here.  We ordered the calamari for appetizers-not good and I would not recommend it at all.  It was \"soaked\" in oil and we started feeling sick after the first bite.  We asked the waiter if we could order something else and got the \"Red Chilli Prawn\" instead.  It was an appetizer with a lot of gravy-it was tasty though.  For entrees, I ordered the mixed grill which has grilled salmon, mahi mahi and prawns.  The salmon was tough and overcooked and there was too much salt on the mahi mahi.  I ordered the cr\u00e8me brulee for desert which was descent.  Overall, I was very disappointed with this place.", "author": "Zainab T."}

OMG we could actually have a conversation without shouting, and it felt really clean. We are locals, so exploring new (tourist? oh my!) 'hoods has become a weekend adventure. We were drawn to the outdoor coctail area, and will now count it as a must for out of town guests' breakfast, as well as ours.  Yep, you can have an Irish Coffee for breakfast! Good place to rest feet and have a drink, too, if enjoying the waterfront area. We will try it for other meals as well.\nParking across the street at the grungy Pier 39 garage.

The greet and wait staff seemed somewhat chilly to our party of 3, and the food was hardly a \"wow\" that we had experienced before. The chowder that I was looking forward to was very thick and soon had a thick skin over the surface of the bowl that was a bit unappealing to me. The crab cakes were okay, although nice and crispy on the outside. The mashed potatoes were blah -- seemed obviously from  a box and could have used a healthy does of garlic. My husband enjoyed his fried platter, although he said it was hard to tell the difference between each seafood item's taste. My friend enjoyed her fried calamari, saying she could still taste the fish in spite of the fried exterior. While the views and the inside decor is impressive, I don't think we'll be coming back to this one. =(", "author": "Danielle P."}

We started off with the Lemon Calamari - YUM!!! Best calamari ever! The other people in our party had the clam chowder and crab cakes.  They absolutely loved the crab cakes, but were not blown away by the chowder.  The sourdough they give you is delish - it was gone in minutes.  The fish and chips looked amazing! HUGE portion of fish and it was thick and really good according to my sister in law.  My husband and I both had the crab roll with sweet potato fries.  The fries were amazing, but I wish the roll had chunks of crab, instead of the flaked kind.  It was just a little mushy, but good flavor.  If I had to do it over, I'd probably get fish and chips.  The table next to us had a little of everything - and we were drooling watching it come out.  They had the lobster, which looked divine and oysters looked good too.  We saw someone else with the whole crab and it was HUGE! But, it was late and we were too hungry to be hassled with tearing apart a crab to eat.  Service was great and the view was really nice.

I went to fog harbor with my girlfriend because we wanted to try somewhere new and kind of nice, and she had a 20 percent off coupon that she received from working at her hotel. So we decided to give it a shot. The views seemed pretty good, but heck if I know, because we weren't asked if we wanted to sit near a window, despite the obvious fact their were many open window seats. Strike one. We asked the waiter if it was okay to drink our own wine and whether their was a corkage fee (their wine list was overpriced), and he didn't know. There was a twelve dollar corkage fee. Strike two. We told him as soon as we got our waiter that we had a coupon for 20 percent off, which he took to put on the tab, but never did. Strike 3-5. He neglected to remember our waters: twice. The food was pretty good, but certainly not better than many other nearby options. We decided to look at a desert menu, which apparently is one of those fossilized versions of the food itself there. My girlfriend had to pee, and the waiter gave me shit for having to wait with the menu until she returned. The next day, when we realized we had been overcharged the 20 percent that should have come off when he took our coupon, we called and tried to get that money refunded, and were refused very shortly. If you're looking for any kind of service normally associated with fine dining at an expensive restaurant... don't go here! I would never recommend this place to anyone.", "author": "Alexander W."}

We happened to stop at Fog Harbor.  Manager came out and spoke with us as we were looking over the menu.  What we were seeing looked okay, but the manager's sense of humor and friendly personality is what sold us.  We were immediately brought to our table.   It was nice to look at all the people on the Pier and to see the different boats pull in.  Our server greeted us, he was hard to understand, but seemed friendly.  Unfortunately as time went on we saw less of him and his friendliness seemed to go away as well. He told us about the Fresh Market Fish of the Day...sounded great...salmon stuffed with crab, etc, etc.. for $20.  After looking at our menus, two of us decided on the salmon with stuffed crab..I was craving crab and for the price it seemed decent.  After taking our orders...we waited, waited, waited, and waited...and waited some more.  During the time I saw two businessmen come in, order, eat, and pay their bill.  I saw 3 ladies come in, order, and eat.  And two old ladies come in, order and eat...all while we were still waiting.  After about 40 minutes our food was brought.  BTW, during this time we were waiting for drink refills..hardly ever checked on, etc.  The food arrived...all looked great and was very excited to eat!  We start to eat... hmm...the \"salmon\" tastes okay, kind of bland...  I said to my dad..I don't think this is salmon.  So, we ask the waiter again what he said the special of the day was.  He AGAIN said salmon stuffed with crab...we then POLITELY and RESPECTFULLY said that we didn't think it was salmon and that it tasted good, but it's not the special.  The waiter then said he would go and double-check.  Come to find out...he was wrong!!!  That was YESTERDAY'S SPECIAL!!  He said that he could get the salmon for us though...no apology or anything.  Too bad we weren't checked on until 20 minutes into our meal though.  By that time half the meal was gone, and we didn't want to chance waiting another 40 minutes for our food.  We were very polite about the whole \"mistake\", which you would have thought the waiter would have been even extra nice.  No such thing.  He never refilled our drinks.  Once it came time to get a box and check...that tooks another 20 minutes!  When he brought the check, he stepped on my dad's foot and didn't say a thing.  Overall...the food was good, but the ONE waiter needs to be switched out.  The other waiter that had to start picking up his slack was great.  Wish we could have had the OTHER waiter.  Got the bill, thought we would maybe be compensated for at least one of the \"salmon\" bills since I barely even ate half, but all was full price.  Would I go here again?  NO.  Didn't expect a lunch to take 2 hours!  BTW, the waiter's name was something like Lubo.", "author": "Melissa H."}

Problems started from the moment we were seated. We requested a table near the window which the host granted us but then as we sat down, the manager came over, leaned over over the host at our table and admonished him something to the effect to check if the table was reserved in the future. During the course of our lunch, we noticed the manager being all over the staff, as discreet as tried, about every little thing. It was just horrible mgt and the place was horribly run. Our waiter, while a very nice man, was very inexperienced (which he admitted). Towards the end of our lunch, his inexperience became outright annoying as we had to raise our hands or flag down the staff for every need. We ordered clam chowder (very good), crab linguini (very rich, creamy, and not so good..you have to crack the crab to get the crab meat), and a crab sandwich (very greasy). Overall, the food was mediocre but the crab linguini was very disappointing. To top off our lunch, we were presented with the bill where they charged us a %3.5 surcharge to help the place cover their staff medical coverage. WTF? I've never seen this before. When we asked about this, our waiter said it was a new law which was complete bull crap. Anyway, save your money and go elsewhere.", "author": "nik t."}

One thing I first must mention in a positive way, this restaurant is a bit more upscale than alot of the burger/cafe-type places in the area, which is nice.  Perfect setting for that special occasion, or to impress an out-of-town guest.  The staff all seem sincerely helpful, prompt service, friendly, fill empty glasses, confirm your order when it is placed, etc.  The prices are what I would call \"competitive\", and given the atmosphere, nice view, cleanliness of the restaurant,  I would say the prices are very fair.\nI ordered the salmon entree - DELICIOUS, best salmon I have had in a long time, very fresh, prepared perfectly, and the wild rice was nice and flaky with bits of fresh herb also.  My partner ordered the Mixed Seafood entree, and that was great too - the calamari was delicious, deep fried, but not too greasy.  Their portions are generous - I was almost tempted to order the sourdough blue cheese/garlic bread, which sounds delicious, but I didnt, because I knew I would get stuffed on that before the meal came - I got stuffed on the entree alone!\nThe views are great from this restaurant, and I really dont think there is a \"bad\" table in the entire place.  The bar area looks nice too - we ate lunch at the Bar one time, and I remember the nice Coffee Drinks they have.
