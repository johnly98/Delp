A series of trails runs across the length of the park and connects with surrounding neighborhoods. Trails range from easy to moderate in difficulty and are dog-friendly (on leash).

Maybe this place isn't so much a hidden gem, but it's not too crowded either. You can be by yourself for quite a long stretch on the trails. Came here for the first time today with my dog and we loved it!\n\nThis place was hard for me to find using Google Maps, which doesn't take you to the entrance. You have to look for the Glen Canyon Rec Center. I think there are various other entrances like Christopher Playground and some other side streets (up towards the top of the hill). I entered from Bosworth St where the Rec Center is, and parked on a small side street. There aren't many spaces, you have to parallel park, and making a U-turn to get out can be a bit tricky if the cars are packed in there. Maybe the other entrances have better parking, but I'm not sure. \n\nAnyway, once we got to the trails, it was beautiful! Lots of trees so it's quite shaded for a good portion of the \"something-creek\" trail, which is supposed to be the easy trail. Once I got towards the top, I headed on a different trail (Crag's trail?) and saw some big rocks near the Christopher Playground area. Some paths here can get pretty narrow, so watch out if you're walking with your dog. \n\nLike I mentioned earlier, this place is great because it's fairly quiet and desolate, so you can get that lost-in-nature sorta feel, even though you're right in the middle of the city. It never ceases to amaze me the beautiful nature we have here in the Bay Area. \n\nGreat day hike, probably only takes a couple of hours. Saw plenty of dogs, I'd say most are off-leash but they're well-behaved. I thought that even the \"hard\" trails were pretty tame and walkable.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

I just don't love snarling, bark-happy dogs that lunge at my chest. \n\nAnd it does chap the hide a bit to see the numbers of off-leash dogs in the park. I am not afraid of dogs, but imagine those of us who are having to contend with the many, many off-leash doggies of various sizes and breeds while traversing GCP. These folk are not going to want to visit GCP, and they should feel just as able to use this space as the rest of us. Leashing your dog, as stipulated in the park rules, would do well toward making the phobic feel less uncomfortable. So for the uninitiated park-goer or those regular users willfully in denial, Glen Canyon Park is a dogs-on-leash-only space. Ample 'free-range' doggie areas are to be found at McLaren Park. Please, take your four-legged friend there for off-leash pleasure.\n\nThis evening while walking in Glen Canyon Park an off-leash dog (medium build, rottie mix in appearance) lunged at me, encircled me, his muzzle making repeated contact with my raised forearm. There was little to no attempt by the owners to call or collar the dog those 10 seconds, or so, before he attacked. \n\nThe lead up to the attack was this: I was walking on the main dirt trail just before the Silver Tree day camp area, when, suddenly, I hear a chorus of rather insistent barks. I don't see where the barking is coming from straight away, so I keep moving forward. The dog barks again, and this time I see him. I stop walking and ask the owners, who are about 15' behind the dog--both they and I are about equidistant from the dog--if their dog is barking at me. 'I don't know' was the reply. I stayed still and hoped that the owners would call to their dog, or come and retrieve him. They did neither and that's when the dog let out another chorus of loud barks before running at me in an attempt to seemingly bite my chest. As the dog made contact with my raised forearm, I kept trying to spin away from him, moving back and forth while saying loudly, 'NO!' At one point the dog stopped lunging, and that's when one of the owners moved him away. A tepid 'sorr-eee' was uttered before they all made their way up the wooden staircase, moving toward Christopher Playground. I sat down to collect myself before walking home. \n\nWhen I return to the park, I'll be armed with pepper spray. Although it would be very unfortunate if a dog were to be injured, I'm really not keen on becoming Fido's chew toy.\n\nPS: Wayne Kappelman, park supervisor of Glen Canyon Park, is aware of the off-leash dog problem. I recently spoke with him and he mentioned that signage stating park rules is continually being illegally removed from GCP, so that those 'not in the know' may actually think GCP is an off-leash space. Fair enough, but you've read it here, folks---it's leashed dogs only. Additionally, he mentioned increased patrolling of the park as one method of fixing the problem. Increased patrol would result in warnings and/or fines to those dog owners who do not obey, no pun intended, the rules.\n\nIf you've also had difficulties with off-leash dogs at Glen Canyon Park, then contact Mr. Kappelman and let him know! \n\nTel: (415) 355-0455; Email: Wayne.Kappelman@sfgov.org", "author": "Bea B."}

Glen Canyon, although nowhere near the size of Golden Gate Park, is a fairly large park located in the middle of SF.  There are hiking/walking trails for all skill levels, with some of them shaded, fairly flat and well groomed.  The trails marked as \"challenging\" are rocky, involve stair climbing and exposed while the ones deemed as \"moderate\" may include some short spans of stair climbing, narrow, shaded trails surrounded by foliage, moderate inclines and walking over fallen tree trunks.  The parts of the trail marked \"easy\" are wide and include low or no inclines.  There are trail markers throughout the park and maps at the trail heads to guide urban explorers.  \n\nI took the trail from the Recreation Center, past McAteer and up to Portola and ran into a handful of walkers, trail runners and dogs on the same path.  The entire trek took me approximately 25 minutes with periodic stops to enjoy the views. \n\nRecent improvements were made to the Park and are still ongoing.  I found the park to be clean, well maintained and safe.  Families with young kids, seniors and sports enthusiasts were all sharing the park on the day of my visit.

As a volunteer for One Brick and the San Francisco Rec and Parks Department Natural Areas Program I've had the pleasure of spending a few weekend mornings with other environmentally-conscious volunteers in helping to clear overgrown brush and weeds from a couple of the natural creeks which run through this beautiful urban City park.  This work allows the water in the creek to flow more naturally instead of sitting stagnant at some point in the creek.  The work aids reproduction of the flies and insects that help to nurture the unique grasses and flora that are found in this park.  It gets downright dirty scooping debris out of the creek channels, but take a walk along the trails and the footbridges of this park and you'll appreciate the work.\n\nGlen Canyon Park is one of my favorite parks in the City.  Not heavily used by the general public this park gives me the sense of being somewhere a lot further away than the City.  The trails are usually pretty isolated used mostly by dog walkers who live in the neighborhood and bird watchers out looking for some of the unique species of birds who nest in the park.  On my most recent visit I learned of the rare yellow-flowered grass that grows in one of the natural marshes and was reminded of enjoying the subtle beauty of the glistening leaves of the poison oak from a distance.

The park incorporates free-flowing Islais Creek and the associated riparian habitat, an extensive grassland with adjoining trees that supports aviary breeding, striking rock outcrops, and arid patches covered by \"coastal scrub\" plant communities. Elevations in Glen Canyon Park range from approximately 225 feet (above sea level) at the south end of the park to 575 feet at the north end and along the east rim of the canyon.\n\nFormal recreational facilities in Glen Canyon Park are mostly located at its southern end. These facilities include a community recreation center, ball fields and tennis courts, and playgrounds. The park is also well-used by local rock climbers. A lonely looking building about halfway up the canyon near Islais Creek serves as....?\n\nThe park is easily entered at its southeastern corner (we walked to the end of Chenery Street). Somewhat further north, there is a wooden stairway leading down into the park (the Sussex Street entrance). There are also trails leading into the park from the Diamond Heights Shopping Center. \n\nGayle and I also noticed that it was warm in the Canyon, while it was cool below in the Glen Park business district, and cold and foggy \"upstairs\" on Portola. We were also surprised as we walked back down along O'Shaughnessy on how much elevation we had climbed, as the hike up was so gradual that it almost seemed flat.", "author": "Eric B."}

There is an old gym at the entrance.  But keep walking, and soon you forget that you're in the middle of San Francisco.  Basically, except for the gym, it's just hiking trails through a forest in a canyon.  Because of its inconvenient location, not too many people use the park, and that's part of its charm.

We searched and searched, trip after trip and one day we found them, really. They are high up on the left side of the canyon about halfway into the park stating from the Glen Park entrance and heading up the creek. I spotted them with binoculars. They are not so easy to see, at least back when I was searching. \n\nThey are not limestone caves but rock caves formed by huge boulders, kinda like Pinnacles Park. They required a bit of climbing through thorny brush but it was worth it. Some beer cans and grafiitti showed that we were not the first to rediscover the robbers caves since the 1860s. \n\nMy little boy was off the hook excited. After many searches, we had finally found the fabled \"robbers caves\".  When he wasn't looking I tossed a few coins into a cave area a bit tight for me but easily accessible by him.

A childhood dream realized.\n\nThe park has a scenic small creek running through it . I saw no fish, not even mosquito fish,  but it has aquatic life in it. I saw salamanders, frogs, and some gorgeous blue dragonflies hovering around. \n\nThere are wild blackberries growing in certain areas and you can eat your way along a trail in the early  fall.

It's surprising how few people know about this oasis in the city or take advantage of it. I myself certainly did not know it existed until my children started going to pre-school there. Yes, there is a co-op pre-school right smack in the middle of the canyon. In the summer it's where the city runs Silver Tree camp. Since cars aren't allowed, everyday, rain or shine, we had to hike in. People have already written about the the breathtaking views and abundance of flora and fauna. But there are some things that a casual visitor could easily overlook. \n\nFirst off, owls. I think they've been identified as great horned owls. Even someone with no interest in birds would find it thrilling to see great big owls sitting four in a row on a branch less than fifty feet from you.  The owls usually hang out in the trees by the trail closest to O'Shaunessy Blvd. I haven't been back since the Fall, but I hear there are now baby owls. So, as you start down the path behind the rec center, look into the gloom the the trees overhead to the left and you should see them. Better yet, just ask any toddler walking by. And you might feel silly 'who-ing' like an owl, but they'll answer you back!\n\nBirds less elusive and more numerous in the canyon are red-tailed hawks. You can usually see them circling lazily overhead, looking for their next meal, or resting on the branches of eucalyptus trees. One day we were lucky enough to see a hawk swoop down and catch a rodent and fly off with it's prize.\n\nIf you rather look down as you walk, there are banana slugs that usually hang out under the leaves by the trail. Some of them are quite huge and they seem to be present all year round. There are also all sorts of snakes. They like to sun themselves on the path, so be careful where you step, though I don't think any of them are poisonous. \n\nIf you want to take a bit of nature back with you, you can always find a caterpillar. Children find it fascinating to watch a caterpillar form a cocoon, then come out a butterfly. Just be sure to give the caterpillar fresh leaves everyday and provide a stick or something for it to attach it's chrysalis. \n\n The canyon used to have huge bushes and thickets of blackberry bushes. Some of them has been cut back for the park service to replant native plants. You can find them along the trails still and if you forget to bring food, they make a nice snack if you don't mind a few scratches.\n\nAnd if you find yourself on the trail towards Diamond Blvd, go all the way to the top. There is a very nice community garden up there.\n\nThe only reason I took a star off was because of  irresponsible dog owners. Some still do not pick up their dog's poop though there are several plastic bag stations. Some also do not bother to train their dogs yet allow them to run around off-leash. A dangerous situation when you mix in little kids. I've seen dogs barrel full speed down a narrow a trail with steep drop on one side and knock kids down while the owner was far behind around a bend. However, I have to say, most dog walkers at the canyon are regulars and look after their dogs when they know school is starting or letting out.", "author": "Kara P."}

Yet I'm doing it.\n\nI'm lucky to live mere blocks away from this peaceful stretch of nature in the middle -- well, the lower part -- of the city. I'm unlucky in that I can't let my dog run around off-leash on the grass and the paths and the sides of the canyon, but we can at least skirt the edges. (How I wish that I didn't have to vigilantly watch for people with off-leash dogs who don't have voice control over their canines.)\n\nThe parks has lots of different kinds of areas, from a sports field to a recreation center to trails along a stream to trails on the side of the canyon. Birds chirping and flying around, even red-tailed hawks. Lots of different kinds of plants and vines and trees and bushes. Blackberries at the right time of year. Yay!", "author": "Tara M."}

Walking through the trail was the best part. The first time I was there, I felt like I was in a movie looking for a secret land or something. Its very peaceful, I enjoy it very much. This secret path has really motivated me to do more outdoor exercise. The only thing I dont like is ppl off leash their dogs. They should have some consideration for ppl who are scared or dislike of dogs, even though their dogs might not be aggressive.", "author": "The Black Cat C."}

Blink twice and you would never know its there, but once you cross the threshold, its as if time and space folded onto itself to create a place that is much larger than you would expect, complete with all kinds of vegetation. \n\nOn one side: rolling hills with yellowish dry grass. On the other, lush forests with fallen over trees, little overgrown shady patches of foliage carving out secret hideaways, wild blackberries, and a trickling stream. Past this is another day camp-like building and some picnic tables (another access point into the park), and then past this, rocks jut out from nowhere creating bizarre craggy rock formations that you can climb (the rocks were clearly marked with chalk so I'm assuming that people come here to practice climbing or bouldering), or if you are like us, a great place to sneak away, have a picnic, and enjoy the view.\n\nWhile I love the public parks in the city, some are just too overcrowded  with dogs and people and kids and families holding birthday parties. It's not that I mind that, but Glen Park Canyon is a great place to go when you want to feel rejuvinated by nature, and dont feel like driving across the bridge to Marin.  It's rarely ever crowded, and even if you see people, its easy to tuck yourself away.\n\nNote: I wouldn't suggest this as an ideal place to go trail running, although I guess it could be done. It's more of a place to go on a nice mini-hike on a warm Sunday afternoon.", "author": "Sabine S."}

Like down in the peninsula, and some parts of the east bay, they warn of mountain lions, or rattlesnakes or what have you, but rarely if ever have I ever seen one the aforementioned critters. That was not the case Saturday March 6th, oh no sirree Bob. \n\n\nWe walk into the park and they are signs that clearly state Coyotes have been seen in the park but I being somewhat of a pessimist pay no heed to warning. After all Coyotes are elusive creatures and what is the chance that a coyote is going to sit up on top of a rock and yelp for a half hour? \n\n\nWell turns out the chances were pretty good that day as we were walking along the trail we heard what sounded like a dog yelping and then howling, I didn't think to much of it at the time and evenly joking said to the wife \"that's a coyote\" and then laughed out loud as I just thought it was a dog that was uber excited by the plethora of playmates running excited and not bound by any fences or leashes. Of contraire mo fraire! \n\n\nWe come out and continue the hike a little up this hill and sure enough perched on a rock about 50 yards up looking down upon all the excitement was \"Wiley Coyote\" hooting and hollering and obviously howling because of the fact that the Roadrunner had once again thwarted his attempts. \n\n\nImages of the Coyote howling in complaint to his defunct acme rocket had my imagination going into and out of an animated reality that I experienced as a kid on Saturday mornings in front of the boob tube watching \"Looney Tunes\" \n\n\nNeedless to say it was cool to see the coyote to say the least. I am at the office right now and forgot to bring the photos but they will be posted this evening or tomorrow. \n\n\nAnyway I was really happy to find this park and really happy to catch a glimpse of the first coyote I have ever seen that was not in a zoo. We will be back for sure.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

I needed to get some fresh air so headed up the hill (it's actually a hike _getting_ there!). \n\nWalking through Christopher Playground, you look out into a deep gully and have to brace yourself for how steep it looks at first. Luckily the paths generally sweep wide and aren't too drastic. Also, there are some steps that make those few parts more manageable if you're concerned about that. \n\nIt isn't a huge chunk of land compared with other areas to hike around the bay, but it's easily accessible and provides flat walks on dirt and wooden paths, hilly climbs, rocky mounts, and dense brush areas that are semi-blazed. It's well-populated with people and dogs which could lead to some frustration if it gets crowded since the paths are pretty narrow.\n\nOne of my favorite parts was the variety of environments you find. The wind was strong as I entered from up high. As I climbed down into the canyon, I noticed the wind dying and heard more birds. I was surprised to find (first by sound) the brook at the bottom of the basin. As I climbed back up, I heard the reminders that I was in the middle of the city.", "author": "Chris C."}

The word \"canyon\" conjure visions of cliffs, rushing water and scenery from the Grand Canyon, but, alas, this was not the case at Glen Park Canyon; evidently when you use \"park\" as the precursor to \"canyon\", it changes everything.
