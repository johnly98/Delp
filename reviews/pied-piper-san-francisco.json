Loads of business men in their suits, quiet conversations, cushioned banquets, dark hardwood on the walls, nuts on the tables & the iconic mural over the bar~\n   Nice mixed drink selections and healthy pours (which did surprise me for sure!!!!) the food menu looked interesting however this was strictly a libations stop b4 dinner for us. We arrived about 4:30ish not to full, however by the time we left it had a consistent influx of thirsty business people.\n    All our cocktails arrived timely and one of the best observations was we enjoyed conversation (there were 5 of us) without having to strain our voices/ears.\n    Expected to be back in SF in August and we will be back for sure!

The blueberry Manhattan (blueberry infused Makers' Mark, sweet vermouth, benedictine, peach bitters) and Last Cocktail (Bombay Sapphire gin, lemon juice, organic pear juice, rosemary syrup, prosecco) were quite tasty and sufficiently strong.\n\nService was engaging and professional, and there are also light bites if you want something solid with your drinks.

I just got off working a 12 hour shift and unfortunately Per Diem had a 1/2 hour wait and I was starving for a decent sit down meal.  So Pied Piper it was.  \n\nMy partner ordered a burger and I wanted to eat a healthy salad after stuffing my face with chocolate and Fritos chips (needed to appease my guilty conscience). \nMy goat cheese salad arrived and I was pleasantly surprised to see a beautifully dressed salad garnished with a colorful array of flowers. It was a shame the lighting in there was dim because it was a sight to see! I took the first bite and marveled at how fresh it tasted. The goat cheese, heart of palms, soy beans, quinoa, spinach and endives all merried well with each other. It was like a functionally productive eco system I thought as I hurriedly inhaled my salad. \n\nThen I took a bite at the burger and I was floored. I couldn't believe I lived a block away and never tried this place!!! I don't know if it was my famished, delusional stomach talking but it was one of the best burgers I've had. What gave it an edge was the bacon!! Super abundant and super crispy like a potato chip.  The meat was tender and thick and the buns were solid. \n\nOur server was prompt and efficient, came by just enough to make us feel we were not in want of anything. \n\nDefinitely coming back, this time I'm getting the salad and burger all for myself :)", "author": "Sarah K."}

Did not love the anything but $3 million dollar service we received.  Before I completely disband this bar's reputation, I have to say that the ambience of the bar was spectacular.  The feet long painting, with all its vibrancy, was the shining star, the focal point, of the bar and it definitely kept me mesmerized while sipping on my drink.  The dim lighting and all the high-backed upholstered seating was also quite lux - there's nothing not love about the atmosphere here.  \n\nThere is likewise, nothing not to love about the cocktails here at the Pied Piper.  You'll find many cocktails that are understated, yet very bold - perhaps this is why the bar is named one of the best in San Francisco.  I enjoyed a Fully Monty while my fiance ordered the Charlie Chaplain.  Mine was sweeter (though not too sweet) whereas his was slightly more bitter.  We had also ordered a beer to split between the two of us however, I don't recall which one it was...I only know that it was strong enough to make me feel significantly more tipsy.  \n\nThe trouble is this: we loved our drinks, but the service was horrid.  We had been given two drinking vouchers as we were Starwood hotel guests here at the Palace Hotel in which the Pied Piper is located.  Yes, we were able to use these but not without great attitude by the staff.  When our waitress was present she was rude, but otherwise she was nowhere to be found...and even when catching her attention she never came to our table except to take the order...someone else even dripped off our drinks.  When we'd ordered the beer  (from another staff, mind you) we drank it and waited 25 minutes to pay.  We tried flagging people down and had even gone to the bar to ask for our waitress, and no one ever came over so with that, we left.  It wasn't our intention when coming in, but it was ridiculous.  It's the service being ad terrible as it was that makes me say this is anything but the best bar in San Francisco.", "author": "Lauren K."}

I ended up getting the two Obans neat. The pours were average and the price as well. I think my friend enjoyed the old fashion. I'm not a huge fan of fernet, so I didn't like that addition. He also got the martini and seemed to like it. My other friend got the charlie chaplin which was more up my alley, though I only had a sip for tasting. He also got the pour of cragganmore. When sitting at the bar, they also give you what looks like an Asian snack mix with peanuts. Good for snacking if you need something salty with your drinks.\n\nI actually liked the vibe and decor of the bar. It feels a little old school with all the dark wood, but there's a hint of extravagance in it. And even though it was busy, it didn't feel too crowded or loud. We were able to enjoy our drinks and have a conversation. Our bartender was nice and attentive.

It would be a stretch to say pleasant, but they weren't completely impassioned.  We asked one bartender about the liquor they had in a glass case.  He informed us it was Louis XIII, in the most expressionless way.  My man didn't hear him the first time, so the bartender then practically barked it at him.  Much in the same style as when we first sat down, & the bartender gave us the bar snacks so haphazardly that he may as well have thrown them at us.

I think they were strong but I really couldn't tell at this point in the night. It was our last stop and well past midnight so I think they had also stopped serving food. And another friend ordered the St. Germain cocktail. I had a sip of it and it was delicious. They use like an elderflower liqueur and I think it tasted like lychee. Mmmmm. Would like to come back for HH, food, and more drinks!", "author": "Alison W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-09-09", "description": "I was never sure if I was supposed to call this place Maxfield's or the Pied Piper, but I used to come here often in the late 90's when colleagues needed a place to congregate after work. But I hadn't been back for at least a decade when Jamie W. read in a blog that someone anointed their burgers as the city's best. Really? I mean, I just went to The Original Perfect Hamburger in the Tenderloin, and I thought they had the city's best. Actually I didn't think that, but I do like the ballsy name of the place. On the other hand, calling a place the Pied Piper makes me think I will be led down the proverbial garden path to no good end. Yes, I know it refers to Maxfield Parrish's 1909 painting which is finally back behind the bar after a long-term restoration. Truth be told, I never liked that picture anyway since its overly fanciful tone borders on the creepy.\n\nI forget that Maxfield's is divided into two parts - the always-crowded bar in front and the cavernous ballroom that acts as a dining room most nights. We made a beeline to one of the big booths, and both of us ordered the $20 Pied Piper Burger, medium rare, with Swiss cheese, a couple of strips of Applewood smoked bacon and fries (photo: http://bit.ly/15L9l5a). The beef was quite food in quality but still a tad dried out for medium rare, and the fries were downright arid. Better were the $11 Bacon-Wrapped Scallops using the Applewood smoked bacon again around a half-dozen plump scallops (photo: http://bit.ly/15L9kxS). One nitpick - we hated the mini-jars of mustard and ketchup, the same kind they use on business class, because hey took forever to unseal and open (photo: http://bit.ly/1ajid07).\n\nRegardless, we liked the quiet ambiance so much that evening that we returned a few weeks later. On our second visit, we saw a mini-stage was set up for a jazz-swing ensemble to perform (photo: http://bit.ly/18Oivc6). Oh dear, it's swing dance night, and the senior regulars came trickling in with their natty duds and talcum powder for the soles of their shoes. But before the jitterbugging began, we shared the $10 Crispy Confit Chicken Wings, a pallid pile that wasn't enlivened by the Fresno Chili Sauce or the Pt. Reyes Blue Cheese (photo: http://bit.ly/17OVsg4). For his entree, Jamie ordered the  $19 Chicken Club Sandwich, which was lackluster hotel fare with roasted chicken breast, bacon, tomato and red pepper aioli between crusty focaccia (photo: http://bit.ly/1euPeZQ). Served with fries, it tasted like room service food left in the hallway a bit too long.\n\nMy dish was easily the better one, the $25 Fulton Valley Roasted Chicken with roasted potatoes, blue lake beans and salsa verde (photo: http://bit.ly/17Ks3ri). As we tapped our toes to the band, we held court with a couple of the house specialty cocktails at $12 each. Jamie had the so-called Last Cocktail, which was a mix of Bombay Sapphire gin, lemon juice, pear, rosemary infusion, and prosecco (photo: http://bit.ly/1cXy8SD). I had the Market Gimlet, an intriguing blend of organic cucumber vodka, fresh lime juice and tarragon-infused agave (photo: http://bit.ly/1euOGTH). Both were tantalizing enough for us to consider cutting a rug, but I was in no mood to be Fred or Ginger that evening. Clearly there is an ideal customer for Maxfield's who wants to have the comfort of old-style American food while tripping the light fantastique.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...nothing too exciting and adventurous on the menu if that's your cup of bland\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...old-style dining room with a bit of swing on some nights\nSERVICE - 3 stars...old-school, sometimes disappears for long stretches\nTOTAL - 3 stars...stodgy but quiet and spacious on any given night but expect hotel-grade food", "author": "Ed U."}

After many years of enjoying its cozy charms we have finally given up on it. What is the management thinking?\n\nFirst they ruined its lovely and iconic painting by overshadowing it with two huge TV sets that play non-stop sports. Classy?  I think not. Next, they removed the historic photos from the walls and replaced them with large, oddly-shaped images of the hotel.  Their awkward placement hides the lovely wood walls, and we assumed they were temporary, but alas they seem to be here to stay. Finally, they have changed the lighting from the warm light of the chandeliers and table candles to the harsh blue light of what seem to be fluorescent tubes behind some of the ceiling glass.  This leaves most of the tables in gloomy darkness, and the rest of the bar as harshly lit as a laundromat.", "author": "Alison P."}

Very classy, beautifully decorated, feelings of old luxury, gorgeous historical painting over the bar (hence the Pied Piper), live music with a very talented band (maybe only certain days of the week, we were there on a Friday). \n\nFOOD/DRINKS:\nCocktails: they boast about their \"signature\" cocktails. I tried the Ralston Cocktail which was Absolut pear, passion fruit puree, and peach bitters, topped with sparkling wine. I noticed that a lot of their cocktails used cheaper/mid-range alcohol, yet the drinks were $14. They also make a pretty mean Manhattan. I'd say the bartenders are talented. The Market Gimlet also seems to be pretty popular. \nFood: I was absolutely surprised that the food was so good. Pricey, but delicious. The salmon ($29) was cooked perfectly and served with brussel sprouts (YUM), butternut squash puree (YUM), potato hash. The trout with couscous was also good. I would also recommend the burger. It's huge! The spicy shrimp salad looked meh. The bread basket was also noteworthy with the biscuits and the olive bread. \n\nSERVICE: very nice, prompt, quick. The waiter even noticed the kitchen forgot to put the sauce on the trout so he took it back for us. \n\nEverything was pretty on point, but it is pricey. It's a good place to go for a date or a business meeting with some drinks, something were you need to be intimate but don't mind the background music of a live band.

In fact, it took my friends and I 10 minutes to find a table where we could perch our thirsty bods.\n\nThe interior sort of reminded me of the House of Prime Rib (lots of leather chairs, wooden tables, a long bar, and servers dressed up in formal attire). I don't know what it is, but there's something about the setting that made me want a martini. While my friends opted for a glass of bubbles.

The Bar itself was once the Buffet Room, and the Restaurant was formerly The Grille, a gentlemen's Dining Room (men and women had separate DRs in the Gold Rush days!).\n\nThe recent remodel has fully upholstered the high-walled booths (which are moveable); they are delightfully comfortable if you can get there early enough to snag one. \n\nThe food...well, it's corporate. But still, the portions are large, and a couple of dishes were actually quite good. We hate the current fad for heavily battered chicken wings, so we loved Pied Piper's simple flour-dusted, extra-large, generous portion of wing parts. Comes with two dips: a very good blue cheese (real cheese, mashed with milk, not blue cheese dressing from a jar), and a simple but tasty hot sauce.\n\nThe 1909 pork schnitzel special had overcooked pork, but was otherwise excellent, with delicious red cabbage and nice chewy buttered spaetzle. The pork cutlet was actually two cutlets, so if you get the wings, the schnitzel should be shared.\n\nThe lamb shepherd's pie was excellent: simple, but very tasty with a fine gravy, and again, rather larger than we thought it would be.\n\nThe old Swiss pastry chef has retired. The new pastry chef is talented, but her desserts are a bit too sweet. Sized for sharing by two. Coffee is okay, reg so-so but the decaf is low-acid and surprisingly good.\n\nThe food at the Pied Piper Bar & Grill was exactly the level we expected. Again, this is not a destination restaurant, unless you just want to appreciate a gorgeous old-style dining room. It's B-level food, approaching a B+ only at brief moments. \n\nBut the dining room is as beautiful than ever, and we'll probably come back for at least one more visit, for lunch next time.

Actually that's not true. I don't do any of those activities. But I DO like to pretend I'm a titan of industry and drink fancy cocktails at fancy hotel bars. \n\nAs the house bar of the Palace Hotel, I'm fairly certain this bar has seen it's fair share of the 1%. The walls are covered in photos of guests from yesteryear, ranging from John F Kennedy to James Beard. Combine that with the ornate history of the hotel in general, and it's all very The Shining. And I love it. I also especially love the huge mural of the namesake flutesmith. At once epic and whimsical, it reminded me of a Thomas Hart Benton paining, of whom I'm a big fan. \n\nThe cocktails are fancy, and I particularly liked the Charlie Chaplin, an absinthe and rye whiskey concoction that tastes delightfully old school. The specialty list is small, but they can make any classic drink no problem. If you're only a beer drinker, I wouldn't suggest a visit here. The list was quite limited. Also, keep in mind that you pay a premium, as one cocktail and one beer ended up being like $22 or something. Still, it's worth it to feel like such a baller.", "author": "Matt E."}

There is simply one but very compelling reason to visit, and that is Maxfield Parrish's masterpiece, and bar namesake, which hangs above the bar.  I had the privilege to bask in the light of this amazing painting while visiting friends whom were staying at the Hotel.  The staff was not warm but they were attentive and unobtrusive, albeit reserved.   My advice, bring your own company, do not expect the bartender to be your chum.  The drinks are expensive but not by landmark hotel standards for a top metropolitan area.  Great whiskey and cognac selection.  If you have to ask what Louis XIII is, maybe this is not the spot for you, especially given a glass' $240 price tag.  I would recommend the Market Gimlet, and you can actually find Yamazaki single malt for less than certain spots off Embarcadero.  Free savory snacks offset the high cost.  That said, even with high prices and cold staff, the price is well worth it to be able to closely study Parrish's amazing work.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-29", "description": "Okay ... like others have mentioned, The Pied Piper mural is missing from behind the bar. The hotel tried to sell the painting at auction hoping to get $5 million for it. The city of San Francisco was outraged by this, as were guests who expected to see it there because the painting was actuall done by Maxfield Parrish SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS LOCATION! This goes beyond even the concept of the Louvre selling the Mona Lisa because that is just where the painting ended up. To sell a work of art that was made for the location behind the bar ... that's just hard to believe.\n\nAfter all the negative backlash from the city and customers, the hotel decided to take the painting off the market and replace it. Before they do replace it, they are having it cleaned and restored a bit. So, likely if you go within a month or two of this review ... you won't be seeing the famous painting because it is in NYC being cleaned.\n\nIt is a curious thing ... to have a painting worth $5 million dollars or more in a hotel bar that contains around 20 tables. Some restaurants/bars do a one million dollar rennovation and brag about it on their website. Very few bars have $5 million+ worth of art hanging there. But while I am sure the hotel is a little miffed about not being able to have $5 million more, customers to the bar will be relieved to see this painting in its originally intended location for years to come. 2 stars off for the big, ugly empty blank wall I had to stare at while I was there a couple weeks ago. The mounting brackets for the painting and the discolored wood panel was visible!\n\nHaving said that ... this is seriously some of the best food you will find in San Francisco. Just about any cocktail here is overpriced by double what it should cost ... and the amount of liquor in them is almost non-existant. To pay $35 for 2 drinks and not catch a buzz is criminal. $7 beer and $40 bottles of wine are where the value lies here.\n\nIn regard to the food ... I've always figured bar food is pretty much a bad idea anywhere you go. Greasy, cheap cheeseburgers and dry chicken sandwich on cheap hamburger buns are what I expect from hotel bars. NOT SO AT THE PIED PIPER! The shrimp salad is huge and comes with fist sized shrimp on it. The chicken sandwich was seriously one of the most appetizing looking things I've ever seen.\n\nThe food literally looks like the food from an adertisement here! And it is fresh and the quality is great. Seriously, if you have a few days in San Francisco ... you should do at least one lunch or dinner here. Its restaurant quality food in a bar. What could be better?\n\nOnce the mural is back in place, this will be a great spot. The only thing other than the weak but expensive signature mixed cocktails that I don't like is the fact that the bar closes so early. I think the last time I was there on a weekend, last call was at 11:30 p.m. on a Saturday night. There were still plenty of people in the bar at last call ... another two hours and it probably still would have been packed because heading out in San Francisco after dark is never a good idea.\n\nAnother suggestion ... I'd love to hear some music playing at night. The televisions with Sportscenter on make it feel like a cross between a classy hotel bar and an Applebees.", "author": "E T."}

Within moments a waitress put two containers of snacks on the table and pointed out the drink menu. She was back quickly to take our order and handed us food menus too (available from 1700). I ordered the salmon and my friend the burger, which was big! We had lightly fried calamari for a starter which was good as well. Despite a full house our server and the other staff were on top of things and friendly. Seemingly a popular after work spot as well as for hotel guests. Prices are on the high side; we got out for around $100 which was perfect as that's just how much I had as a credit for being a hotel guest (and booking through American Express' Fine Hotels and Resorts Programme). The decor was soothing too. It looked like \"old money\" with it's dark panelling and leather seating, but felt fun and youthful being so busy.", "author": "Ben S."}

My friend who came with me, not so much.\n\nMaxfield's Pied Piper Bar has a strange name because they basically branded the name of the bar after Maxfield Parrish's famous oil painting that adorns a 6X16 length of space above the bar.  The painting is currently worth upwards of $2 million.\n\nThe bar is very, very old school.  Meaning it is made with heavy, dark wood, dark interior lighting and chandeliers from the 1930's.  There are pictures of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower on the walls to give you a clue on the old factor.  I felt like the bar was really beautiful but I like those types of places.\n\nNow for the issues.  The cheapest glass of wine is $16!!  WTF.  The house wine is only a couple of dollars cheaper.  I would say stick with a cocktail like I did which \"only\" runs $12.  I had a dirty martini and it was really nice.\n\nThe food at Maxfield's is very average.  I had the tuna tartare and it was okay.  My friend had the deviled eggs but she hated them.  For the price the food should have been better.

Well it was an awesome recommendation and a fantastic bar.  The first thing you notice is the \"Pied Piper\" by Maxfield Parish hanging prominently behind the bar.  Its not everyday you get to see an original Parish, usually you only see them in books or prints.  I am a huge Parish fan ever since my days back in art school in New Jersey.  An absolute treat to get to see this painting, in fact at first I couldn't believe it was the original.  I came to find out it was commissioned by the hotel back in 1909 for $6000 and now is estimated to be worth around 5 million.  Now that's an investment...\n\nThe room is beautifully decorated (it does have a bit of a speakeasy look to it) and has excellent ambient lighting.  Since it was a Sunday afternoon it wasn't too crowded nor too empty, the sound levels are good and you can carry an easy conversation with no problems.\n\nSo how about the drinks...they were very good.  I had a White Mandarin Cosmo and a Market Gimlet and both were solid drinks.  Free unlimited senbei snacks were provided and it was an overall good usage of a few hours time.

Now, I'm a man who can appreciate a good vodka, so 3 of us tried the 'featured' vodka and then i think i had another one after that was through.  So we're there long enough for me to have 4 drinks (not drinking very fast) so they bring us the check (for about 6-7 people) and its $300!

We got a half bottle of wine to supplement the meal.\n\nWe split a half bottle of wine and made our selections.  The appetizers were a little above average, the entree was excellent, I had the Kobe beef, but there was only one dessert to split.

(Done through duck tours, highly recommend it) An event must have taken place earlier at the hotel because the bar was full of men in suits and ties and women in flowing dresses. They were, although sharply dressed, a bit rowdy and noisy. This isn't enough to make me subtract a star from the review; it created a dissonant ambiance but I suspect isn't a common atmosphere for the bar. \n\nMy party of 4 slipped into a corner booth furthest from the bar, we were instantly greeted by a waiter who brought us a bowl of spicy/salty snacks for us to munch on while deciding what to drink. The drink selection is great- very interesting concoctions, ones I haven't seen in other bars. I ordered a hot apple cider drink with Tuaca (our waiter informed us this is an Italian liqueur, vanilla/citrus). The cocktails are a bit pricey ($12) if you want to be there all night, and though they are absolutely delicious, they are wavering on the small side.\n\nThe bar is absolutely massive which gives a very impressive feeling, there are wood panels on all the walls with beautiful vaulted ceilings. The walls have images of old time celebrities who have stayed in the hotel, and of course-the famous pied piper mural is brilliantly displayed behind the bar.\n\nPersonally, I am a fan of establishments with lower lighting, and if they are as vast as this bar- they are designed in a way that allows you to feel cozily nestled in your particular space. The Pied Piper bar feels too open and bright (and on this particular night, too loud). The people watching isn't as interesting since there is an upper-crust air to everything. The bar was perfect for what we accessed it for- a place to rest for a bit, grab a warm spiked drink and close our Sunday night conversations. I wouldn't think to go back since it didn't have an ambiance that pulled me. And at 12 dollars a drink, I'd rather go to a place with a bit more life, some interesting music, and a more dynamic atmosphere.", "author": "Tawnee K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-03-30", "description": "Despite it's downtown location, it's residence within The Palace Hotel, and it's pristine display of yesteryear's opulence, the Pied Piper is all but unknown to most long time residents and born-here locals.  Because of this, it's a cool whistle-stop to bring a done-it-all, seen-everything date.  I like to spring it on people at the end of the day, usually after a day of hoofing around North Beach or hanging out around Union Square.  We'll be heading home....then right around the base of Montgomery I'll keep walking past the BART station.  When my sidekick asks where I'm headed, I'll gesture across Market and reply in a mischievous tone, \"C'mon....We're going somewhere\".\r\n\r\nThe two over-sized doors of the Palace Hotel face New Montgomery Street, and walking through them takes you into an elegant lobby.  Take the 1st right down the marble floored hallway, and the entrance to Maxfield's is an unadorned passage about 50 feet down and to your left.\r\n\r\nStep inside and you're greeted by a room that oozes with old-guard swank.  This isn't the sheet-rock, Masonite, and trendy lighting swank that you'd expect to attract the tawdry likes of Brittney Spears or Paris Hilton.  This is well-lit, old-growth hardwood from top-to-bottom swank that might have hosted the likes of Harry Truman, Winston Churchill, or F.D.R.\r\n\r\nThe crowing attraction is the Pied Piper itself...an over-sized painting by Maxfield Parrish that consumes most of the wall in back of the bar, and is reputed to be worth somewhere around what you'd expect to shell out on an all-you-can-eat pizza party for the entire state of Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nThe scenery is nice, but the suit-and-tie crowd is usually dull as dirt. The pick-up scene is non-existent, the music is soft and very old-guard, but sports are usually on the corner TV during the daytime.  The staff and clientele are usually dressed to the nines, but nobody bats and eyelash if you pop by a-la-tourist in blue jeans or shorts.  Don't expect to find one-dollar PBR's at happy hour....Though beer prices aren't anything that'll break the bank, they're understandably higher than what you'd expect to find at your average neighborhood pub.  But woe to you if your date likes good wine....they don't serve two-buck-chuck here, and if you stick around for more than one round the resulting bar tab can begin to drain your resources at an alarming rate.\r\n  \r\nIf you're in the downtown area entertaining a local who's seen it all, just mention Maxfield's...if she flashes you a puzzled look, take the lead and make your way to the corner of Market and New Montgomery.

Its history is rooted in the Gold Rush and, as such, its story is one of entrepreneurs, adventurers, outlaws and other people who played on the fringes of society. Today, it's no different, really. We're still an outlaw town, in many ways. We still inhabit the fringes. Only now our frontiers are in technology and cuisine, as well as energy, social and environmental activism. San Francisco maintains an abiding respect for its heritage because that back-story justifies who we are today. And so our eating and drinking establishments are as likely to allude to the city's colorful past as they are to pay tribute to what's current, fashionable, or avant-garde. So when it comes to bars, the first thing I always notice is whether some place is \"old\" San Francisco or \"new\" San Francisco.\n\nThe Pied Piper is decidedly of the \"old\" San Francisco. Dark wood adorns the bar, a checkered tile floor, large oil painting above the bar, and the classiest cocktails you can find. Not to mention, it's set inside the opulent Palace Hotel in the city's historic financial center. Servers sport ties. You could imagine bankers of the early 20th century doing business over scotch and cigars. \n\nGrabbing a drink at the Pied Piper makes me feel stylish and, I must admit, damn important. You know you're experiencing something special. But it avoids exclusivity or priggishness; everyone is welcome at this bar. Of course, be prepared to pay dearly for the drinks :)", "author": "Andrew K."}

Some rougher around the edges* as well as some that are the exact opposite...meaning the Hotel Bars. Normally, due to ill formed preconceived notions of the patrons of both, the denizens of one do not usually cross-over to the other side, i.e. the groups and bars are normally mutually exclusive. I think this is a shame because both are really missing out so...this is where I come in.  I feel at home in both worlds and so I believe I can help both the Dive Bar Dweller person (\"DBD\") and the Hotel Bar Haughty person (\"HBH\") by putting forth reviews like the following for Maxfield's.  Call me something of social silly putty that wants to bring people together!\n\nAt Maxfield's:\n\nThe HBH crowd is just as self absorbed in their own groups or their drinks as any party or patron of any DBD's bar.  Meaning they have the same interest to take a load off from their day off meetings or work and are just happy to have a good drink with some friendly peeps.  So what that most are dressed in suits and cashmere...many are not too.  Often I found some of the wealthiest people I know are the most casually dressed...therefore...anybody actually fits in and doesn't feel ostracized.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is straight up what you'd expect a top notch hotel bar.  Great wood.  Comfortable seats.  A strikingly beautiful bar with the signature painting overhead.  There are both small tables and plenty of bar space.  The area can hold a lot of people!  Essentially thing a very well designed tall roofed rectangle.  Just beautiful.\n\nThe drinks...well..I always get Grey Goose or Belvedere rocks..so impossible to mess up.  For $10 I get a very large drink.  I'll take this any day over the Sutter Station $8 for same that is half the size!  So you'll get a generous drink...now I've been with people who got house cocktails and they were neither impressed nor disappointed.  So I'd say hit or miss there.\n\nThe intangibles: nice to see only two small TVs...I'm here to chat w/ my peeps or to have a nice drink out with a good friend ...not to watch TV.  The service is spot on.  It is always easy to get someone's attention and they are crazy courteous.  You may need to schmooze a little to get a table if it is busy...but whatever.  Lastly, I love the snacks.  Three choices of munchies that are definitely worlds better than popcorn!\n\nSo, all in all, the only real differences for the DBD visiting the Hotel Bar, and specifically Maxfield's, is that it is brighter, cleaner, and has better munchies.  The people are essentially the same but just in different outfits.  Diversity in any environment is the most desirable quality.  So I encourage the Dave's, Sutter Station, Louie's, Dada crowd to mix it up a bit and grab a drink here...you'll get the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the classic Hotel Bar that SF has to offer.\n\n* Please see my Yelp review of Sutter Station at http://www.yelp.com/biz/sutter-station-san-francisco#hrid:mqmRKdeq50egjP11cmZlYg", "author": "Chris D."}

I think this restaurant takes the cake for the worst dining experience I have ever had in San Francisco!!!!\n\nWe arrive and waited about five minutes before we are seated.  The waiter passed us a few times and did not even make eye contact.  I thought we were invisible.  Our waiter, Carlos, finally seated us without saying a word.  He basically just pointed to the table.\n\nWe sat down and were not given enough menue.  The menus followed five minutes later with a slap to the table.  Carlos came to take our orders, still unable to make eye contact.  We asked for a wine list.  He disappeared without a word for at least another ten minutes.  The food is expensive, the salmon (at $29 a pop) is farm raised and the atmosphere felt cold and uninviting.\n\nCarlos had his hands full and seemed to be the only server on the floor.  The entire time we dined he never connected or made eye contact, all the meals, drinks, the bill etc were all thrown on the table instead of being placed and we had to wait a hella long time to order, to get our wine, to get the wine glasses etc.\n\nAt over $50 a head you would think you would get some service.  Carlos never refilled our waters, we had to pour our own wine, he handed us our to go boxes to prep ourselves and he did not even ask my husband how he wanted his burger.\n\nThe food was good, but ordinary.  The only positive was the meals were large and there was plenty of food.\n\nMy mom enjoyed her farm raised salmon but I am guessing she could make it better herself at home. The chicken seemed plain and came with not much more than steamed broccoli etc.\n\nMy husband enjoyed his burger - thank goodness he likes it medium rare. I like mine well done so I would not have been pleased.\n\nAll in all is was a PISS POOR dining experience.  Crappy atmosphere, the worst service I have ever gotten at any restaurant, extremely high prices for average food and an overall horrible dining experience.\n\nI left covered with white lint all over my black pants.

Prices are on the high side, but about what you'd expect for a place of this caliber. \n\nAs an added plus, the bar at the Four Seasons (another of my favorites) is within easy walking distance.\n\nIf you're looking for a hot, fun crowd with \"a see and be seen\" attitude, this is not the place.

A mixture of mandarine vodka, a splash of cranberry, fresh squeezed lime, and some type of dried berries at the bottom of my martini glass. I could have drank 10. But I moved on to the Anjou pear martini which BF had started with and was prepared with pear infused vodka, a dash of vermouth, organic pear juice and had a slice of fresh anjou pear floating in it. It was light, refreshing, not too sweet but not too vodka-y and basically the perfect martini. \n\nBF got overly chatty with the bartender and we learned that the famous Pied Piper painting was recently appraised at around 5 million. Geez! Needless to say BF was super impressed and happily accepted a postcard of the painting from the bartender. It was at this point I could tell the martini's were beginning to take some serious hold on us- be warned, they are big guys! (And better be at $12 a pop.) And we still had to get through dinner with BF's mom at a nearby fancy pants restaurant, so I dragged us out of there while we were still on the up & up.\n\nIf in the neighborhood I would most certainly return to this classy joint for drinks and snacks. It would also be a great place to bring the folks visiting from out of town. A peek at the bar menu revealed raspberry brie wontons with devonshire creme as well as an heirloom tomato salad w/burratta cheese, sea salt and saba vinaigrette. YUM!!!", "author": "Callie K."}

A Maxfield Parrish book in the window caught my eye, and I mentioned that he was my favorite all-time artist.\n\nMike: Well then you must be at Maxfield's all the time!  I think it's even close to where you work.\n\nMe: What's Maxfield's??\n\nMike:  OK, let's go... \n\nWe hailed a cab and made our way to the Palace Hotel.  He didn't laugh at me (much) along the way, but admonished me gently for not knowing about this gem.  He also shared some of the hotel's history with me as we made our way back to the bar.\n\nWhen we got to the door, I was actually afraid to go in.  We must've stood in the doorway for at least 10 minutes, admiring and analyzing the miracle that is Maxfied Parrish's work from afar.  Mike finally convinced me it was OK to go in, and we grabbed a table toward the end of the bar so that we could sit and stare some more.\n\nThe server came and took our order, and brought our drinks pretty quickly.  He was a bit of a smart ass, but he was hot and had a sexy accent, plus...I WAS SITTING NEXT TO A MAXFIELD PARRISH PAINTING!!  Even having football on the tv couldn't diminish my joy at finding this place.\n\nNow I'll admit, I'm no art buff - but I happen to love Parrish for his treatment of light: the way he used color and light made his subjects seem to glow, and I've always been drawn to his work.  The Pied Piper is by no means my favorite of his works; he created so many other wonderful pieces that touch me: Ecstasy, Daybreak, Aquamarine, Morning, Reveries, Enchantment...the list goes on.  But this is the only one I've seen in person, and damn...it's exquisite.\n\nOh, but I think the drinks are expensive.  To know for sure, you'd have to ask Mike.", "author": "Madeleine K."}

(The food was pretty bad.)\n\nThe most \"adventurous\" item on the lunch menu I've had was the halibut.  Absolutely no flavor.  A good enough portion of fish, but tasted like nothing and it was paired with cold asparagus.  My lunch companion and I could do nothing but comment on how bad the food was.  Oddly enough, the waitperson never asked us if we enjoyed our meal.  He just rushed by to take our order and drop off the check.  The buspersons or lesser waitstaff actually delivered our meal.\n\nI've had burgers and salads and other meals here and they have been equally as non-descript.

A 2.5 million dollar Max Parish mural dominated the view, and I ate some of the best chicken wings ever while thinking about whether Twain ever sat in this same seat.\n\nIf your suit has been sitting in the bag for too many months, bust it out, buy a new tie, sit down at this place and feel like an old school gent, hundred percent class.  Plus, they have a great looking bar menu.\n\nIt only gets four cause I haven't seen delved into there whiskey selecton yet.  Hopefully, the next time, I'll find a gem.", "author": "Ashby U."}

Drinks and food are good, although the food selection is a little limited and some of the wines by the glass are expensive.  I love the room though; it's dependable and a comfortable place to hang out.  It has a great history, and I could stare at the Maxfield Parrish over the bar for hours.  Since the original Redwood Room is gone, this is one of the remaining classic hotel bars downtown.", "author": "Kim M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-03-30", "description": "In the spirit of full disclosure, I have a thing for hotel bars. \n\nIt started when I was five. My dad took me into the Hyatt Regency at One Embarcadero and bought me a virgin strawberry daiquiri and we tossed pennies into the big glassy fountain and I jumped on the plush couches and danced around by myself to the music being played by the nice man on the grand piano. Every time we came to San Francisco, I would insist on a trip to the Hyatt. \n\nI have since turned in the virgin daiquiris for gin martinis and I don't jump on the furniture anymore. But stick me in a hotel bar with a piano playing and give me a chilled Hendrick's martini and I am in heaven. \n\nThe only thing Maxfield's lacks is the piano. But they have an excellent selection gin and every other liquor known to man, including an impressive array of single malt scotches and small batch bourbons. Their by-the-glass wine list is also a roll call of the best wineries in California and around the world. \n\nThe joint is all class. I would guess that all the original fixtures are in place from the bar's inception in 1909 when the hotel was rebuilt from the ground up after the 1906 quake. The floor is delicate honeycomb tile, the bar is solid carved wood, the walls are of gorgeous, warm wood paneling, the barstools and seats are covered in soft leather, the room is brightly lit by two huge chandeliers and on the wall behind the bar is a gianormous Maxfield Parish painting, The Pied Piper. \n\nThe service is friendly and there is a happy hour buffet on Friday evenings. It is a great post-work destination after a long week. Or a long Wednesday, perhaps.", "author": "Sage R."}

In a party of three as a walk-in looking to grab some food. It's primarily a bar however their menu is posted at the entrance and they encourage evening dining.  Food was certainly acceptable for the price and the choice was good.  Unfortunately the service was absolutely terrible.  After sitting down we couldn't catch anyone's attention and eventually picked-up menus from the service area.  After a while we caught the eye of a waiter who came and took our drinks order, with apologies for the wait.  Food took a long time to appear however we were asked if we wanted more drinks, which we ordered but then didn't appear until the server came back to tell us our food was nearly ready (15 mins after checking for drinks).  Food was good however by the time we got it we could have done with further drinks but no-one checked-in with us and we couldn't catch anyone by eye.  We finished our single course 90 mins after we'd arrived and decided to call for the check (had to call another waiter as ours was nowhere to be seen) rather than think about desserts.

I got a Lychee Martini which was good, but was also 12 dollars; I'm not sure it was $12 good. I forgot to ask for some water, and never got any automatically. Near the end of our discussion just about everyone's water glass was empty. Empty! One of the people in our group went over and got the water pitcher. It's self service here for the water I guess. The waiter came with more water a few minutes later. A little late homey. So drinks for 9 people, maybe 1 or 2 people had a second drink and someone had some soup. Check, over $200. Hrm.
