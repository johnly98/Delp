Quite hilly and not as easily walkable. \nIt was a typical blustery day in SF with the fog so deep the sun barely peaked out, which helped keep it cold darn near frigid when the wind kicked up.

If you're a non-resident then Presidio might be a good fit on price.\n\nPresidio is a decent course but a little rough around the edges. Pro shop seemed to be chaotic and confused. I asked about getting some range balls and was told I should get them down at the range. One ball machine was totally broken, the other had a broken credit card reader. After a nice round trip walk back to the pro shop (300 yards from the range) I then had to walk to the far side of the range which doesn't allow woods to find an open stall. Really terrible mats, typical crappy balls, the range is one of the worst I've ever been to. Harding has an bad range, I was surprised Presidio has something worse. \n\nThe course is scenic but not well maintained. The greens are especially beat up. They're $30 greens at a $100 course. The fairways and rough are decent. The bunkering is very nice, it's the highlight of the course. \n\nOverall, it's a fun track. It's scenic, it's in SF, it has a nice layout. It's hard to call it anything better than 3/5 given the condition of the greens. Presidio just feels like one of those courses where at some point they stopped trying to be great. Machines are broken, process is confused, the greens are beat up, but they give you a free beer. I hadn't made it out to Presidio in many years so it was nice to check it out again. I'll be sticking to Harding for now.", "author": "Garret R."}

For a number of years I was a member on the private side and have fond memories of those days. Granted the course wasn't in as good of shape back then (2007-2011) but, it was still fun to be a part of it's rich history. Once the course offered up the \"players club\" on the public side, there was no looking back. It's $39/month and then $18 a round with a cart and two draft beers. Basically, you pay for two beers and get a free round of golf...an unbeatable deal in San Francisco! \n\nAs far as the course goes, they've made some vast improvements over the years and this place continues to get better each day. The views are incredibly beautiful and it's worth playing just for that reason. Another part of why this course can be so difficult is because you never know what the weather is going to be like. I've played it in extreme winds, rain, sunshine, fog and it's always something new. Frustrating but, new :) \n\nDaylight savings means it's time again for golf. Let's go!!!", "author": "Benjamin F."}

Haven't played the course so I can't give a review on that, but I have been to their driving range numerous amounts of times just because of the location being so central in the city and having the most reasonable prices per buckets of balls. Also, they have a great putting green for practicing. \nThe one reason I love coming here to hit balls is the fact that it's on a downwards slope, so when the wind is in our favor, blowing down winds, you can feel like a John Daly by hitting the ball so far and watching it soar towards the fence. That seems to be my all time challenge; get hit it long and hard straight for the fences. But most of the time, it's a proper slice flying all the way towards the right", "author": "Nick A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-30", "description": "My uncle brought me here to let me try my hand at golf.  So, we bought a basket of balls and set up at the driving range. Good thing we arrived early as the tee off mats were filling rapidly as we settled down. \n\nAfter a quick lesson of fundamentals, I started driving balls downrange... Well, not really. That was what I wanted to do. Instead, I smacked the green mat, clopped at the ball with a flourish as the ball skitttered to the side...fail. Smacked grounders downhill. I consoled myself that I did not hit any air balls, and no animals were harmed during my time at the tee--at least none that I know of. I was also especially careful not to smack a ball at the dude driving the thinggy that sucks up the balls from the range.\n\nFor inspiration, I tried to visualize some hushed sports narrator commenting my next shot...\"he picks the driver, and lines it up with the ball. Settling into the zone now. Wait...what is he doing? His feet are out of position, oh dear, look at his grip--that won't do... He's going for it. And nooooo--he forced the swing and futzed it. Let's revoke his membership.\" No that's no help...\n\nAfter a basket ($10 for 70 balls) and a half of about 100 balls, I managed to connect cleanly with maybe just 10 swings. The clean zing of the club striking the ball in the sweet spot was very satisfying. But I still had no idea what made those shots from the ones that failed. \n\nThe ball dispenser uses range cards or cash, and requires exact change. The baskets and equipment at the driving range was in great condition. One minor complaint is that there were not enough tees for all the mats. In addition, a few of the tees were cut too tall.\n\nNext, we spent about  15 minutes on the putting green. Did better there thanks to putt putt golf courses.\n\nSo, after our session, I asked my uncle about pro-lessons. He proceeded to tell me that every golf pro he has hired from around the world, at various costs per hour, have never agreed on the same techniques past some very basic principles. Ergo, I have concluded that golf is probably a sport for delusional masochists.\n\nThe grounds were stately and the course eye candy. The clubhouse for the public had very clean restrooms, a great pro-shop and a nice restaurant albeit pricey. The crowd there seemed totally oblivious that I was a noob. I was grateful.", "author": "Lu-Shien T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-08-09", "description": "Disclaimer: this review is solely for their golf course as a wedding venue. \n\nMy sister had her wedding here in Aug 2017. I would not recommend this for a wedding venue.\n\n1) Bathrooms - this probably won't be a big deal for weddings in the future, but they told my sister 3 weeks before her wedding that THEY WERE GOING TO DO CONSTRUCTION ON THE BATHROOMS. This can also be translated as, YOU WILL BE GIVEN PORT-A-POTTIES as a replacement. They weren't as awful as the ones used during outdoor music concerts, but it was awful. Think about 120 people, having to use the port-a-potties....omg. FOR A WEDDING, OF ALL EVENTS! It was terrible for my sister who had to make sure her wedding dress wouldn't get wet from the ground. Omg. These were port-a-potties that you could flush, but had to use the pump to put water in beforehand. Just a HUGE mess overall. Let's just say the asian grandparents were not happy about this. They did give a $1000 discount though, but to be honest, should've been at least 4k. It was a HUGE inconvenience, disgusting, and if my sister knew this ahead of time, she wouldn't have picked this venue!!!!\n\n2) Food was just meh. Appetizers (ahi poke with chips), and deep fried shrimp, were excellent actually, and tasted exactly like when I tried it on their food tasting day. Halibut was yucks, blue cheese salad just whatever, bread was good (but just a bread roll, tastes the same at every wedding), prime rib was average (still edible, not awful, but really nothing better than that). The food was so gross that I barely ate any. \n\nContinuation of the food....I didn't see it personally, but my cousin came up to me during the wedding saying she saw 2 MICE running from underneath the food tables. OMG. My sister asked for a discount after the fact, and they did not honor it.\n\n3) Venue itself - just keep in mind that it is a GOLF COURSE, and people are STILL ALLOWED TO GOLF DURING YOUR CEREMONY. Another omg. So when the ceremony finished, we were taking family pics, wedding party pics, etc. During one of the photos, a golf ball from a few hundred feet away hits a bridesmaid on her back. NOT EVEN LYING ABOUT THIS. I couldn't believe it happened. I guess my sister thought that Tracy, the coordinator for this event, would have shut down the golfing for when the wedding began, but no, I guess Tracy and the golf course doesn't have to. I was just shocked when she told me this. \n\n4) The venue looks beautiful on a sunny day, but for my sister's wedding, it happened to be one of those cold and foggy summer days in SF. All of the bridesmaids hairdo's fell out, it was freezing AF, and extremely windy. The pics didn't turn out blue and beautiful like how they look on Yelp. This is nothing against the venue itself - but just an FYI, something to think about. Perhaps this would be a better venue for an October wedding, when Indian summer takes place and it's warm. \n\nPositive notes:\n1) They let my sis bring in an ice cream and coffee truck outside in the parking lot. It was considered an outside vendor, so they didn't have to let her, but did. I do appreciate that!\n\n2) The open bar was great - well utilized\n\n3) I liked the chairs and tables, and the way it was decorated in the tent. It all turned out very nicely. It was this one lit up tent in the middle of the dark golf course - a fun intimate experience. However, I didn't like how the dance floor was separate from the food and tables. It was in a separate room. I'd personally prefer the dance floor in the same room as the food tables. \n\n4) The appetizers were good....I wish I had 2 plates of that for my dinner instead.\n\n5) Parking was easy - there was plenty of it in a parking lot right in front. It's also in a safe area, which I bring up, since for my best friend's wedding (separate venue), several of her guests' cars were broken into. \n\nOverall though, wouldn't recommend this place for a wedding. Simple as that.", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

When we paid they charged us 9 bucks for a walk along, which is fine, but then said they'd kick us out if he played. He just played 10 bucks to walk, if he wanted to play he'd have paid....On the third hole group ahead of us was playing 2 balls and they picked up my ball, so we got behind when looking for it(the woman who took it apologized). Then they came and yelled at us on the next hole, saying we needed to hurry up. Then the dude hovered and watched us play the next 2 holes in a weird creepy way. Then he saw me drink a beer and came and told us he could kick us out at any time for drinking outside alcohol. I did drink a golf bag beer, I'm sorry. I bought their beer before we started and at the turn. He just wanted to make sure I knew he was watching us and he could kick us out...which kinda ruined the afternoon.

We teed off, she took my ball after her next tee shot, and it wasn't until after she finished hole 3 that she came and gave me my ball...so I had to finish that hole before teeing off on hole 3, while they got to keep going. In addition to this, they probably had a faster time after that because the woman started playing the appropriate number of balls, 1. 1 completely understand pace of play, and I am not sensitive about being hurried as long as they do it politely. I explained the situation to the man on hole 3, but he was was just really rude. And kept being rude for the next three holes.

Have played here with Generals, nuns, Arnold Palmer and even Cheech Marin and Don Johnson (yes, Tin Cup).\n\nThe only decent outdoor public golf range available in San Francisco (Harding has a small one), Presidio has some of the best facilities you will find for a great day of golf.  \n\nA full bar at the 19th hole, a driving range, restaurant and cafe, pro shop and professional golf instruction make the Presidio a great destination.  Do you know that the Presidio is the oldest if not one of the oldest golf courses west of the Mississippi?  This used to be a private course for most of the officers.  As a kid I was allowed to walk on and caddy for some of the officers (and learn dirty jokes). Today the course is open to the public although reservations are highly recommended several weeks in advance especially on weekends.\n\nWith San Francisco weather, the course is open year round and also serves as a great little place to get a drink at night.  Course weather can vary and is rarely shorts weather.  The range is from 50 - 80 degrees with wind.   It is hilly, so carts are highly recommended to keep play moving.\n\nThe course itself sets up nicely.  The front and back nines are switched from the original format to accommodate the new club house when you finish the round.  DO NOT mistake the old clubhouse for the pro shop where you check in.  The old clubhouse belongs to the Presidio Golf CLUB, not the Presidio Golf COURSE.  The only setback of this revised layout is that you get a short dogleg right for a 1st hole rather than the majestic par 5 that is now the 10th.\n\nAs the course sits along the bay, the humidity is high and the winds are pretty blustery out of the west.  If you are a traditional high ball hitter, you might employ more of a bump and run game like you would on a links course in Northern Europe.  The greens tend to be slower because of all the moisture from the area.  The course also lays out well for right-handers who like to move the ball from left to right.  Only the 11th hole slightly favors those who play a draw. \n\nThere are snack carts on the course, but you will find a great snack shack and bathroom at the 4th, 11th and 16th holes for your convenience.  \n\nThere is an ATM in the clubhouse should you lose your shirt to your friends while gambling on the course.

I've played this course probably 15-20 times over the last couple years and yesterday will be my last. Let's start off by the construction on about a third of the holes. Greens and bunkers being repaired on those holes. No warning, no disclaimer on the website, no discount, nothing. Most courses give you the courtesy of an aeration warning. This place won't even tell you that 1/3 of the holes are under construction. Then the 2 rude older marshalls working the course showing a complete lack of respect. One of them waited for us after the par 3 4th hole. \"You're 8 minutes behind pace. You need to be at the 8th tee box at 12:24.\" The guy was very rude and callous. And then he's just sitting there for us once we get to the 8th fairway, staring us down. We quickened our pace, even after having to wait 10 minutes at the 7th tee box. We get to the 10th tee box, and are greeted by the starter that checked us in. We are currently 4 minutes behind pace.  He informs us that we did not follow instructions to increase our pace and that we have to hit our first shot from the 200 yard marker. No apology, no sorry for the inconvenience, nothing. Just no respect from either of these two. We should have drove off the course then and there. I'm trying to have a good Sunday with my brothers and dad and we get this treatment, as loyal customers too. We were 4 minutes behind pace! With the group directly in front of us, and no one behind us. Definitely put a sour mood in our mouth, and we definitely took our time on the back 9. $100 to play a city course and we get this treatment. Where does Presidio Golf Course get off treating their loyal customers like this. YOU ARE NOT CYPRESS POINT. You are not a private golf course for the hoity-toity snobs of a country club lifestyle. It's a city course and you pump 4 somes out there every 10 minutes. I will not spend another dime at this place", "author": "Mark D."}

It gets a bit busy on the weekends after twilight begins at 3:00p, so expect around a 5-hour round with the risk of not finishing unless of course you have night goggles. Overall a great vibe, excellent greens, but some of the fairways are steeply sloped to the right, so expect to either loose many balls or hit in opposing fairways if your handicap is above 10. I love this course, except of course when I have a lousy shot, which seems rather frequent, but c'est la vie. I'll try again next time.", "author": "Brian J."}

It's not an ideal setup but I am thankful it exists.\n\nI live half a mile away and only play here 2-3 times a year. Why? I think it's just a bit over-priced for what you get. Maybe that's just SF in general, though. In my mind this is about a $40-50 golf course. I am willing to pay a slight premium because it is in the city, but if you are paying more than $60 you are going to be disappointed. $100? Forget it, you are going to be angry. \n\nCourse is in great shape, it's really really tough. Tons of up hill and side hill shots. It will be a very long day for you if you're walking or if you struggle with uneven lies. \n\nStarters can be jerks. The course could be wide open and they will make you wait for your exact tee time. Our group was there 30 min before our tee time and there was a foursome of old ladies in front of us. Course was wide open. We asked if we could go since we were a two-some and the starter scoffed as if it were an insulting request and made us wait in case some last minute addition showed up to be part of our group. I have had more than one negative interaction with the starters here like this (telling us to speed up, even though we were waiting on the group ahead of us. Telling us hit our tee shots, even though the group ahead was clearly in range, etc). I've been playing golf for 25 years and and am a 5 handicap so I've been around the block and know the game and this course really stands out as a place where the staff treat you like you have no idea what you're doing. \n\nI understand that there are a lot of out-of-towners and bachelor party type groups playing here as it is the only really available public course in the city so the starters and such need to be a bit firm sometimes to keep the pace, but more often than not it has soured my experience and they have been gruff for no apparent reason.", "author": "max m."}

Instead of being in the office on a Friday, I was in mid-70's weather in a beautiful part of the city, treated to a free round of golf, stogies, beer, a juicy hot dog at the 9th green General Store. Had I paid to play this course out of my own pocket, I would have given it 3 stars, hence the reason for this review.\n\nTo play on a Friday with a cart, you're shoveling out $145 ($77 for SF residents). You get greens that aren't in great shape (granted we're in a drought, so this wasn't my biggest concern). In fact, the course condition isn't really a problem for me. It was well-maintained for the most part.\n\nWhat I didn't really like was the staff. The guy that stands at the first hole to guide people through had a bad attitude even before we started. Yes, we had two newbies so he could tell we were going to be the slow group, but jesus man. The bigger annoyances came throughout our play, when we had the little red-jacketed marshalls pulling up to ask for a moment (numerous times), to tell us how far ahead the next group was, and that we needed to be at a specific hole by a certain time, or else they'd move us. Honestly, they should really spread out the tee times to be more than just 10 minutes, so that you're not rushing for 4.5 hours. Finally, when we were done, we brought out carts up, and another staff member came to clean our clubs and then mentioned that he had change if we needed it. Nice little innuendo to tip.\n\nFork over $15-25 more (as a SF resident) and you can play TPC Harding Park. I'm going to check that course out next.", "author": "Ryan L."}

The starter questioned me like I was lying to him. Telling us \"hey, I'm a New Yorker, I've heard it all\" blah blah blah. My mind says \"New Yorker= jerkoff\" Great way to start my round after taking a day off from work. Totally unnecessary.

Since it is one of 2 desirable places to play in SF (I don't really count Lincoln), it is pretty crowded, and the rounds are long - plan to play in 5 hours minimum.  The high demand in players seems to give the staff the perception that customer service and courtesy isn't necessary.  I find the pro shop staff to be rude, and the food service people to be slow and unresponsive.\n\nLastly, they charged us a $12/per person reservation fee (That is $48 per foursome) because my friend booked the tee time more than 7 days in advance.  Seems like a way to nickel and dime the public golfer, and pretty lame if you ask me.\n\nfor the price, Harding is a better course.", "author": "Mark P."}

I understand its in the heart of the city, but for the money, its just not worth it especially if you're a non-resident.   If you're going to pay $145 on a weekend to play this course, shell out $30 more dollars and play Harding Park, which is way nicer and they don't pack in the tee times so you're not constantly waiting at every tee box.   Its also about a 20 minute local drive from the Presidio so its not super far.  I'd also rather take that drive to Half Moon Bay Links to play their Old Course for $185.00.   \n\nIf Presidio was $50-60 instead of $82 with a cart, then I would add 2 more stars to my rating.

I came here to watch my hubby play a golf tournament on an absolutely gorgeous day (a clear day in the mid-70s with a slight breeze and breathtaking views of the city? Yes, please!) Grounds were green & absolutely beautiful! As I walked the course, I saw coyotes & squirrels, and heard birds singing. I honestly don't think it could have gotten any better.\n\nThere was a paved path for golf carts & spectators that wound nicely through the course. Only on a couple of holes did I have to leave the path to be able to see the green. The walking layout was perfect for a good workout: a good amount of hills to get your heart rate up without ridiculously steep inclines or slippery downhill slopes that you have to maneuver on a shoddy gravel path.

Folks that have played here all had the same comment - it's very hilly and up and down.  \n\nFortunately we had a golf cart which really helped.  We were instructed to start at hole 10.  So we played the back nine first.  All in all we had a great time.  It was hilly, but the fairways are wide open.  No water and a few bunkers. \n\nThe GPS on the cart did an excellent job.  Kept us on the straight and narrow.  Don't try driving up to the apron.  The cart won't let you.

Plus, it was a gorgeous sunny day in San Francisco on a scenic and picturesque course and driving range.  \n\nI am not golfer so I don't have much to compare our experience to, but I had an awesome time at the driving range!  We went to the pro shop to set up, walked over to the ball vending machine to redeem our codes for the buckets of balls and waited for not very long for a spot on the driving range line.\n\nThanks to my experience memory of whacking opponents with my high school tennis backhand (waaaaay back in the day), I used similar motions and had a BALL hitting and whacking golf balls across the range green with the rented driver and other clubs.  It was VERY therapeutic, but I am sure I will be hugely sore over the next coming days (well worth it though)!  My bf and a couple of friends enjoyed ourselves for a couple hours.\n\nYou'll get the other snooty golfers (whatever) and some very good-looking men (!!!), still snooty though (whatever), but all that aside, the service was friendly and helpful and the course is simply gorgeous with beautiful cypress and eucalyptus towering trees.  Before or after you golf, you can stop at their cafe for a meal or a snack.  We grabbed our two beers per deal, sat outside and basked in the sun after a fun, lovely afternoon.  \n\nI would love to come back!

Short   from the Whites, medium distance from the Blues. The Challenges are brought up to you by the Trees (it's tight and requires precision) and all sorts of uneven lies you'll play.\n\nPACE OF PLAY:\nI read the reviews and I see the point that many of you made about the Marshal being ON your group here and there, but my question is: \"would you rather play a 5.5/6H round and be 3rd group on the tee on hole #4 waiting... or have the Marshals around and finish your round in 4H with absolute NO wait on tees on a Saturday Morning\"... pick the lesser evil. I put PACE OF PLAY as a PROS for this course, so you know how I feel  ;) \n\nPEOPLE:\nTalking about the golfers. This course is a Tourist Attraction, so you'll play with people from all around the World, that is FUN and interesting. Locals play all the time thanks to the SF residents sweet deal (read below)\n\nSF RESIDENT DEALS\nLOVE the fact that I don't have to buy the SF Golf Resident Card ($90 a City Hall) but I have access to deals just by showing up with my Driving Licence (Bring and utility bill as well to show current address). To play this landmark course non-residents pay $150! SF Residents $75 on a weekend. Weekly Twilight is short of $40 and they have all sorts of deals they will promptly email you if you sign for their newsletter!\n\nCONS:\n\nCROWDED:\nYou don't really feel it on the course when you are playing thanks to the Marshals, but Putting/Chipping area, driving range, restaurants and parking lot are real crowded. Not a relaxing atmosphere, but great people watching :)\n\nPRO SHOP:\nI never clicked with them. they are not the most friendly peeps in the world, but I spend 5mins in the golf shop and 4h on the course so, proportionally is not  a big deal.\n\nDRIVING RANGE\nI truly dislike this driving range. Mats are old, stalls are not on a straight line but on a curve, targets are on an awkward angle and 20 yards downhill.

Greens are true but a few surprisingly slow.  Only had one sand shot but it was dry and fluffy...  Fairways in great condition but know, they are very firm... you will not be taking many divots and there is a lot of roll.  In fact, if the fairway is slopped, I found that I hit to the top edge of a fairway and found my ball yards away, having rolled down and across the entire fairway.  \n\nStaff / Pace of play: Staff nothing but polite and professional.  We had a threesome behind us and a twosome behind them so play was a bit rushed for us and the Marshal was on us a bit however... He was polite and understanding when we explained our observation of the smaller groups behind us but overall, we completed 18 holes in just under 4.5 hours. \n\nFood and Beverage:  There was a snack shack along the course and we called ahead for dogs and burgers at the restaurant prior to the turn... no problems, quick, easy, and good food for the value.  \n\nWe are from Sonoma County and although we have plenty of courses here, I look forward to playing here again soon.", "author": "Ron D."}

Course is hilly with elevated greens. walking this course is a good work out, but i like to ride. There are some blind shops. \n\nCourse Design. 8 I felt like the course was really hilling and narrow. I played the course from the blues. Its a combination of Lincoln Park with the hills and Harding with a little less distance. There are some fairway bunkers and sand sucks.. Not soft but hard. The negative about this course is the drainage system. S.F. was sunny for 3 straight days but when the fog rolled in the course became damp. As a result the ball doesn't travel. Lots of trees everywhere. You can loose some golf balls.\n\nGreens- 8 here are small to hit but not  hard to read. Just judge by the hill. Bunkers surround many of the greens and some of the greens are place exactly in front so you can't bounce your ball up there. Speed was I would say it was a challenge. take your time in putting.\n\nFavorite holes:8.. Love number 9, herd it use to be number 18 until the new club house was built. dog leg right with ob to the right. With the wind, you could hit the green in two.

When the wind blows at you, your looking at a 2 club difference. From the blues, the distance was perfect, but the terrain makes the course harder.\n\nFun Factor. 9. Its cool to try out this course .

The course is nestled near Golden Gate and during the afternoon expect to deal with the Fog, Wind, and some drizzle. It felt like the back 9 was a little more blustery than the front, but overall the conditions were not bad.  This course is very hilly, but walkable. Fairways and tee boxes were good condition some dry spots and ground under repair, but nothing to bad. One thing, like other yelpers have noted, the greens are slow. Layout is very challenging, slope rating 129 from the whites, so adjusting appropriately to the uneven lies will be key on most approach shots. Prices were decent, especially for Bay Area residents.

It's convenient, right here in the city, but for a little more $ I'd rather play Harding, especially with my SF resident card. The fairways are more of a loamy soil, as opposed to the sandy soil in Harding, that means it gets muddy at the slightly hint of rain and not as cushion-y. The greens are every bit as good as Harding though. Layout-wise most holes are decent with the exception of 3 or 4 holes, like the par-3 that you can hardly see (valley between tee-box and green, trees in the middle) and the downhill-uphill par-4 with a blind approach.\n\nMe and my buds still come here for the convenience and variety.

The traps are manicured pretty well also.  The only negative for me about the course is that it seems like every shot is either above or below your feet.  Hit a perfect drive down the fairway?  You still might be in trouble if you're not used to hitting when the ball in 6 inches above or below you.  \n\nI'm about a 14 handicap and I shoot over my number here every time whereas at Harding, I usually play below my handicap (more even lies).  \n\nBut overall this is an awesome golf course.

Their fringes are diabolical (links-style beach grass) and will ensure a bogey or worse.\n\nThis course is in as great of shape as I've ever seen it.

But Mother Nature will keep the grass growth situation down for some time.\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe course is gorgeous and is the nicest public venue in the city limits.  It only gets 3 stars from me because of price/value 1) they have mud traps.  For whatever reason, they aren't filling them with decent sand or taking care of them so your lie is going to be radically different from bunker to bunker.  2) The grass is not plush.  Many times you will experience a super tight lie on more mud than turf. 3) The greens. Not very consistent or true.  Very difficult to find your groove on them.\n\nWhen you come to Presidio, realize it is the worst weather in the city during the summer time.

Every shot depends on your decision making and shot making ability.  From downhill to uphill lies, from going for a par5 in two or laying up...it will make you think.  Overall though, this course is fun to play.  I still remember the old Mountain Dew commercial where the golf cart rolls over on the 11th fairway...cool.  FYI, that was over ten years ago.  My only hiccup would probably be the gimmicky par3 13th hole with the tree blocking the view of the green.  C'mon, I'm not 6' 2\" or taller.  I need to jump up or step aside just to see where the flag is located.  Just because of the stupid tree feature I think it is improbable that someone can get a hole-in-one there.  Speaking of which, my last round at Presidio wielded a player from a group behind us from getting a hole-in-one at the par3 16th hole.  He said he was a 18-19 handicap...good for him and good for my foursome.  He bought everyone a round at the bar.  Super guy.  Just what a person who shoots a hole-in-one should act like.\n\nOn the driving range:\nHuge with a crescent like contour to fit all golfer levels.  They use a 'rug' and not grass which disappoints me, but it's always been like this since I can remember, so what can we do.

We get the senior rate of $38 and each of us gets a free breakfast (table service); 2 beers free; and a lunch voucher for $10 (also table service).  The menus for breakfast and for lunch are quite varied and good.  Also, after 5 times we got a $50 gift certificate and also after 11 times we got a pair of golf shoes.  However, as of Oct 15, Presidio decided to change the Loyalty Club rules.  They say they can change the rules anytime on the form.  However, I was on my 11th play and so when I went in to join the new Loyalty Club, I mentioned that I was supposed to get shoes on this visit; they said \"don't worry, we will do something about that\".  Anyway, they ordered me a pair of shoes and I will get them free.  \n\nI think this is above and beyond as far as being nice.  The new Loyalty Club is a little less value, but I don't think it was financially feasible for the Presidio Golf Course to continue this way.  I can't blame them for changing the rules.  The benefits are still very, very good -- and they give you 100 points just for signing up.  \n\nI think the Presidio Golf Course has a lot of integrity and it is a pleasure doing business with them.  I appreciate that there is such a nice golf course to play at in San Francisco.", "author": "geri h."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-22", "description": "There are three things that will demolish the average golfer at the Presidio.  The course itself isn't overly hard.  In fact, on paper it is quite short.  However, the following factors increase the difficulty:   \n\nThe Weather\n\nWeather its July or December, the weather will be a factor.  Our day started out beautiful with sun and very little wind.  However, between the 8th and 10th holes we went from sunshine to fog to rain.  \n\nWeather on the 8th Hole: http://www.coursecam.com/blog/wp-content/presidio_golf_course_8th_hole.jpg\n\nWeather on the 10th Hole: http://www.coursecam.com/blog/wp-content/presidio_golf_course_10th_hole.jpg\n\nI've included some photos of the drastic weather change.   There are two things to consider with the weather.  First, bring a track suit.  Once the fog kicks in it will be thick and wet.  The location of the Presidio is on the south side of the Golden Gate Bridge.  This is the first piece of land between China and the USA so you can bet that the cold air hovering over the Pacific is going to be cold and affect your golf shots.  Second, you will need to consider add 10 extra yards to any distance you have.  So if you are 150 yards out it will play more like 160 yard.    \n\nThe Hills\n\nThe hills are no joke either.  Although there are many elevation changes I feel the biggest factor is the side-hill lies that you will encounter.  Don't get too excited if you hit it down the middle of the fairway because you are likely to have an uneven lie for your second shot.  You will also encounter this around the greens as well.  \n\nThe Cypress Trees\n\nThe entire course is lined with huge Cypress trees.  They grow in a way that creates a canopy about 60 feet off the ground.  And although they are beautiful, the canopy always seems to be right at the top of any shot you have.  There are also several tee shots where you will need to hit through narrow rows of trees.  This in my opinion is very intimidating.   \n\n\nHere is the satellite map of the Presidio Golf Course:  http://www.coursecam.com/courses/presidio_golf_course.cfm  Keep in mind it doesn't reflect the elevation changes.\n\nThe good news is that there are plenty of holes that you can make birdies on.  In fact as I think about it, there are only a few holes that are really difficult.  Again, this is assuming you can manage the weather, hills and trees.  There greens were decent for December and I made quite a few putts.  The greens are usually really good, but we were playing in December and overall the course was pretty wet.\n  \nThe tee times are usually very expensive as well.  We got a great residence rate on GolfNow of $49 at 12:09 (twilight in December).  Normally the rates are above $85.  The facilities are great and so is the staff.  It is definitely a resort atmosphere.  The round took us 4 hours 45 minutes to play.  According to the NCGA, this is the average pace for the course.", "author": "Jeremy C."}

Today, the Blue Angels were getting ready for Fleet Week and were practicing inches (I exagerate) over our heads. It was breathtaking. Also breathtaking were the icy winds and thick fog.

The staff was friendly and alarmingly good looking for public course guys.\n\nIf I had to be picky, I'd mention that the greens were a bit bumpy. \n\nFor years, this was a military base and I always wondered what this jewel would feel like to walk and enjoy.

We had a 12:50 tee time and no one told us this when we reserved a tee time or when we paid at the shop. The starter then told us that it closes at that time. We were cut off at hole 17. There were people in front of us so we could not go any faster. We were on target to finish in 4 hr and 10min. Do not reserve the 1250 time instead reserve an earlier time to ensure you get to complete. Or reserve after twilight time, so that you don't pay the full rate and not get to finish. When we asked why they would charge the full rate when they knew the 1250 time would not finish, the person said otherwise they would not make as much money, which was a confusing response. Presidio, please inform customers when they are reserving at what time the course closes and realistically set tee times that charge the full $145 per person rate so that they are able to finish.", "author": "R S."}

It is in a great location, right in the middle of SF.  Though the scruffier Lincoln Park course just west has better views. Somehow, there is this feeling as it pretends to be a private club and not just a muni.  It is a muni, and a decent one at that.  If you pay more than $60 at this place you are being had.\n\nAssuming you stripe the fairways, most of your second shots will be sidehill lies from 140 to 170 yards with almost all second shots to an uphill green.  It can be pretty tough.  You need to be a good sidehill putter.  Greens are not superfast but every green has a tilt.\n\nPar 5s here are your scoring opps as they are flat or dogleggged or downhill and nothing from the whites more than about 490 yards.  There are a handful or really tough holes.  The 11th hole is a cool downhill dogleg left to a green that two traps guard.\n\nAll in all it is a nice course.  During the week we had coupons that got us on for about $60, but I guess that is fair enough for SF in the summer. The fairways were in very good condition and they have put a lot of work into the T-boxes.

A great deal IMO. Best part was that you could bring the beers out to the driving range. I guess the beer softened the deep, deep, disgust with myself, and I could hang out on the bench and watch my friends drive their shots into the next area code. Yay. I was smart enough to get two of the Yelp deals, so I have another trip ahead of me to redeem myself. \n\nI wish I could tell you more about the course, but I can't. Don't hate. It looked pretty nice, the driving range isn't much to look at.", "author": "Saunders C."}

Sometimes I just tee up 10 years behind the markers so I can have a flat shot.\n\nthe driving range is the worst one I've ever seen, it's on the side of the hill and a lot of balls end up in the first fairway. while playing here a few weeks ago, I was on the 1st tee around 5 pm...there's was literally 100 balls in the first fairway...it was so bad that you didn't even wanna hit your second shot, it just wasn't worth walking into the open driving range that is the first hole....put some higher nets up for Christ's sake!\n\nUPDATE: Summer 08...the management of this course is on a rampage to get play to go quicker. yesterday we were on the tee of the 9th hole and the group in front of us was about 320 yards out and a marshal rolled up on up and told us to \"close the gap\" to which we replied, \"oh we're right on pace, we're fine!\" he said nothing back but stayed nearby with his walkie talkie going off on our tee shots. Collectively that was our worst hole of the day, we were so pissed.....the funny thing is they call their course a 4:40 hour course...BUT what they don't realize is that you can't assign a time to a course....if it's \"cart path only\" they you just added an extra half hour to everyone's round.....get an effing clue!", "author": "Adrian H."}

Unless you have zero regard for the game of golf or yourself.   To start the day, you'll begin at a driving range with mats.   Not grass - mats.   The only thing worse for your clubs than hitting off the mats is the actual tee boxes on the course.   If you told me Presidio employed a groundskeeper I wouldn't believe you.   And then I would text my friends about the idiot I just ran into and what you just said.  During your round, you'll see about 30 Rangers and none of them will be concerned about pace of play.

The best part is going to the bar after a game and sitting in a clubby atmosphere with a wonderful staff, cold beer, cocktails and good food.", "author": "Alston L."}

Went out there a couple of times during the week and hit balls on their expansive driving range and then finally went out on the weekend.  Wow!  Had to wait nearly an hour for a spot to open up.  But aside from that...\n\nThe course is pretty nice.  I think it's a bit overpriced for what you get, but there are some amazing views to be had.  Played with a guy from Holland and he nearly fell over a couple of times because he thought the views of the city were so nice.\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, the course is fair.  Not too difficult, but if you plan on missing the fairway too much, it could be punishing.  But if you keep the ball in play, you could score there.  Nice course, but don't think you're quite getting what you pay for playing there.  Plus, I don't know if this is just me, but the staff there seems to be incredibly stuffy.", "author": "doug s."}

But if you live in the northern part of the city what choice do you have? The course layout is challenging and the setting is superb. Its a definite dose of San Francisco golf: lots of Cypress trees, wind, fog, and occasional views of the city. Arnold Palmer Golf Management has been making some improvements to the course, its now more playable in the winter and some of the bunkers have been redone.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2006-11-05", "description": "SUMMARY: They have serious management and communication problem not only because they think they are better than their paying customer, and mgmt has trouble retaining their staff. For anyone considering having a banquet or wedding reception here, I do not recommend it based on problems with customer relations and communications.\n\nUPDATE:  Now that the wedding is over, I finally feel like I have enough calm to write a more detailed review. I feel as I am being generous considering the treatment we received from the General Manager, but the stars are for the rest of the staff, who were kind and did do a great job on the dinner.\n\nThe Story: We booked with Presidio Golf Club back in May. The saleserpson, Xenia, did a great job and we chose this place because we liked the atmosphere of the place, it was just the right size for our party, and foremost because they have an event coordinator (which was Xenia, who we liked) on site. In July, Xenia called us to let us know that she is leaving Presidio Golf Course but that the event coordinator would be hired within 2 weeks and that we would be contacted her manager by the name of Gina Marie within 2-3 weeks. After 4 weeks of no contact, my fiance emailed and left voicemails at the establishment. After 5 weeks, which is September, I decided to also email and call. It took me about 1 hour of calling every extension on the phone system at Presidio Golf Club (taking time out of my work day) to finally reach someone. Apparently, Gina Marie has also decided to leave within weeks of Xenia leaving and we were lost in the shuffle. The general manager, Colleen Daly, claimed to have lost the numerous emails and voicemails and blamed it on technical difficulty. Being in IT, I was very suspicious of her answer -- I mean, what are the chances of the email system and the phone system going town for the past 2 weeks? I was very concerned that we do not have an event coordinator, and I needed to give my other vendors (DJ, cakemaker, and photographer) a point of contact. It was only after emails cc'ing other top management with Palmer Golf (the company that owns the place) that I finally got a coordinator, JL, to be our point of contact.\n\nWe found out that they needed to change the menu (at 1 week before the wedding) so I decided to call and find out more about the details. I called JL, but only reached a general voicemail at his extension. Odd, I thought, so I called other extensions. I called the kitchen (food & beverage dept) for Michael Perry, our executive chef. I was greeted by Dan, who told me that Michael stepped out, so I asked if he knows how to reach JL... and Dan told me that JL is no longer working at Presidio Gold Club! I asked Dan if there is someone else that is working on our reception that I can speak with, and he gave me the cellphone for Paul (nice guy), a chef who is directly working on our reception dinner. I called Paul and he was very kind to me but also confirmed that JL is no longer working at Presidio Golf Club and that he got the annoucement a week ago.\n\nAfter this, I called Colleen and wasn't able to reach her and left a voicemail. I also decided to write an email complaining about the 3 departures within the last 4 months that were not communicated to us. At this point, we had already paid for the reception in full, $11,000, including the deposit of $4,000 that we paid in May. I was quite miffed that given the money we paid, we were not given notice of the situation at all, and that the menu change came so close to the day of the wedding reception, instead of the 2 weeks in advance as we were promised.\n\nSoon after that email was sent, my fiance received an angry call from the general manager Colleen Daly. She yelled at him and said that my email is the equivalent of career assasination and that she demanded and apology and retraction or else she would drop us. My fiance crumbled to the pressure, and when I saw that email, I called and found out what happened. My fiance told me that he had tried to ask Colleen to talk to me but she refused unless the apology and retraction to my email was given -- she even went as far as refusing to get off the phone until that email appeared in her inbox. \n\nI called Colleen and she basically yelled at me and repeated the same. She also wanted an apology from me but I let her know that she should not expect it. It would be up to her to drop us, but she either wants our money or not. She told me that I was stupid to believe in the words of the kitchen staff, though it was her staff who took her word. My fiance was able to get his head clear and wrote a retraction to the apology that he sent out to the VP and management. We explained that the email my fiance wrote was a result of threats and unacceptable behavior. We rewrote the contract with specification that Colleen be banned from our event. I refuse to fake a single smile at my own wedding! I have a 5k character limit so for more details, mesg", "author": "Irene S."}

ANd the course was in very nice condition when I played last weekend.  The fact that I shot 79 was not bad either.  I strongly recommend playing this course in the summer ONLY, the drainage is quite bad, and it turns into a mud bath in the winters.  Rating changed to 4 stars for the summer, but STILL 2 stars for the winter. \n\n\nI played the Presidio recently, and I think the people who have rated this 5 stars were on crack or are just used to playing horrible courses.  \n\nThe only reasons that I have given it 2 stars:\n- Excellent condition of the greens, very challenging, but fair and very well maintained. \n- The location, the eucalyptus trees all along the course, and the AWESOME weather made the course conditions bearable. \n\n\nThe reason for taking away 3 stars:\n- HORRIBLE fairways - we started on the 10th tee and there was a reason; the 1st fairway was covered in crap.  All the fairways were in awful condition, so bad that the rear tires of my cart got stuck in the deep, sticky slush that they call a fairway.  By far the worst that I have experienced.\n- BAD and RUDE golfers: there were 2 groups in front of us who were SOOOOOOO SLOW and completely unapologetic about it.  The marshalls basically drive around in their carts and do absolutely nothing.  \n- There are people working all over the course - I felt pretty nervous driving off the tee when there are 3 people working in the fairway and none of them are even looking in your direction to see whether a missile (golf ball) is headed their way.  \n- PRICEY:  For this much money, you could play some place that was WAY nicer:  Half Moon Bay, Crystal Springs, Cinnabar, even Metropolitan and Monarch Bay in the East Bay, though they are not as close to the city. \n\nOverall, I would not go back, unless I knew that they had finished working on it.  I think it is a pretty location and a fair and challenging course but needs a lot of work, SOON.\n\n12/5\nPlayed here again a couple of weeks back, and I just wanted to state that the first rating was correct.  The drainage on this course just sucks - we played from mucky, wet fairways on 4-5 fairways.  And this is when Northern California is going through a drought!  Imagine what happens if it rains...the greens were pretty beat up as well. \nToo expensive and there are many other good values in the Bay Area.", "author": "Pat T."}

Flat boring greens, bad drainage etc.\n\nOverall: If you can get a good rate here it's a good course and worth it - if not I'd look further away. \n\nPS: Only driving range in the city.", "author": "Fred J."}

I've played there in the summer and the winter, and conditions and I didn't enjoy either. In the summer (July) it was so cold and windy, I barely finished. In the winter, there were pools of water in the middle of fairways and the greens were closed. It's very expensive, and they gave very little discount for poor winter conditions (even without greens), and never told us about the conditions when we made the tee time. With the renovated Harding Park, I just have no reason to play at the Presidio anymore. The reason I gave it two stars, is that on the off chance it's a sunny day (not sure those exist much there), it's very pleasant, and if someone else were paying, I wouldn't object to playing there. Let's leave it for the tourists.", "author": "Debbie J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-07-26", "description": "This review relates specifically to the driving range at the Presidio Golf Course, not the actual golf course. I went here over the weekend excited to hit some balls in what I thought was going to be a beautiful spot.  Everyone raves about the Presidio, right?  It was more like a big pit in the ground.  The terrain was very rough, there was not even solid grass covering it and large dirt/mud patches were widely apparent.  The actual mats you hit from were dirty and wet and there was mud all over. There are also no stalls to keep your bag and the windy conditions kept blowing mine over.  I'm guessing the range may be under construction or something but I wish I would have known before coming here.  On the contrary there was a beautifully landscaped putting green close by and you can purchase a range card to get a better deal on balls. Here's to hoping the driving range gets a makeover soon!", "author": "Shawna M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-20", "description": "i always think it's hysterical how territorial amatuer golfers can get about their local clubs.  and no matter which course you're playing... if you happen to be playing with a set of locals that frequent that particular course, then you're going to get an ear-full about how much HARDER their course is than all the other courses on earth.  \n\nyes indeed, if you're playing Lincoln with a couple locals that frequent Lincoln, then well, Lincoln is so hard, so hard... OMG, what a tough, tough course Lincoln is.... and if you're playing presidio with a couple guys that play Presidio once a week then you're gonna hear them go on and on about how much HARDER presidio is than all those other girlie courses that you play while they are playing the tough, tough Presidio course.  and god forbid, you do as i did that one time and wear a swanky $125 \"Harding Park\" fleece when you're teeing off at Presidio.  my gosh, i thought they were going to chase me off the course with torches like i was frankenstein ... \n\nFor the record, Lincoln is a short course but very narrow so you can lose balls and get a lot of penalities for being out of bounds (although most amatuer golfers don't really count the penalities correctly on this type of play) if you're not accurate.  but if you're vaguely accurate, you can score very low even if you can't hit so long.  Presidio is much bigger and longer with few real dangers of losing balls or of penalities and Harding is probably a combination of both being the hardest of the three.  But none of them can compare to playing Torrey Pines a few weeks before the US Open like i did last year.  before the pro's play, they let the roughs grow six inches high and shave the fairways short and narrow till they start to look like a green some 200 yards away.  if you don't land on the fairway, you might not find your ball at all in the tall grass and if you do find it, you'll need a machete to hit it even if it's 300 yards to the hole.  sucks.  \n\nthe Presidio course is wide and picturesque with almost no water hazards and very spacious so it's unlikely you'll lose any balls.  the course is long in places and the signature par 3 green is totally surrounded by bunkers so you might have to hit out of sand if you don't hit the green.  the driving range is nice with a good view but don't believe the yardage markers!  i know i can't hit my 8-iron 215 yards!  perhaps the markers are accurate but they are so far downhill that it's not a measure of how far you're hitting it at all.", "author": "dan h."}

Here comes this rude filipino guy who appearently works at the facility and I guess there was a sign that was planted on the grassy area and it just stated that it was an area for practice. The guy comes and turns the sign around and points it at us. Then he comes up to us and tells us to get off the grass in a rude manner. He tells us that the sign states that this is not an area of practice. The sign did not say you cannot pracitce on the grass. So he comes at us in his rude tone and rude manner and I don't know who the hell he thinks he is but if he were to inform us in a more calm and nice and respectful manner, maybe we would have responded better... But instead this stupid, rude A%$ filipino guy comes at us like he's tough S%$#! Like he owns the freakin place and acting unprofessionally. I swear man, sometimes THEM people better watch themselves and how they talk to people because not saying myself but there are people where if you come at them in a threatening manner, they will kick your A%$.

Like massively awful. Like I've successfully caught maybe two or three things in my life and I don't think I've ever managed to connect a bat to a ball in that great American pastime of baseball. So when my husband suggested we check out the driving range at the Presidio I was all ok! you hit, I shall observe.  After sitting back and watching him whack the ball a few times I decided, hey, that looks kind of fun, can I try? So he gave me a club and a few tips on how to swing and hit the ball and then I took my first swing. Let me tell you, IT WAS AWESOME. I only missed two or three times but most of the time I managed to get a good whack on the ball which feels amazing! I loved it, I loved hitting the ball and watching it soar over the range and into the sun and then trying to figure out how far I'd hit it. So much fun. I highly recommend it for relieving stress, seriously, nothing takes the edge off like whacking some balls. A small bucket of balls will run you about $7 bucks and there are plenty of spots so you should be able to get a spot without waiting. A super fun weekend activity. I plan on incorporating trips to the driving range into all my weekends.", "author": "Cathy T."}

Other than that, they're expensive, and even when you're playing ahead of schedule, the marshals are out there hounding everyone.  We ended up having some not so nice words with one of them because here we are, playing TWENTY MINUTES ahead of the precise schedule they give you, and we're told that there's \"some room\" in front of us so we should hurry up.  I'm sorry... twenty minutes ahead of schedule.  No one was hitting up on us or waiting for us to tee off.  In fact, I thought everyone was playing at a nice pace and there were no problems, except for this d-bag rushing us when we're playing 20 mins ahead of schedule and just forked over $100 to play - not to mention the overpriced food and beers we bought from these jerks.

You almost forget that you're in San Francisco because one can get very absorbed in the beauty of the golf course and what it has to offer.  The course conditions are improving every month.

Two complaints knock this review down to three stars. 1) In an apparent attempt  to maintain the pace of play, the greens are kept very slow - especially considering the great condition they're in. 2) Marshalling. We started on the back nine and play was so slow (9 minutes between groups) that by the time we reached the 13th tee, we were already one hole behind the recommended 4:40 per round pace. Eventually the pace picked up and we finished our round in 4:25. Nevertheless, for 12-14 holes in the middle of our round, we were constantly harangued by the marshalls. They were courteous, but as noted in one of the previous reviews, they don't take an \"overall\" approach to what's happening during one's round. They simply look at each hole in isolation and deal with you accordingly. Despite the beautiful day and conditions, their attitude made my experience less enjoyable.", "author": "Cee J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-23", "description": "I started playing this course in Nov '05 and have been a regular since.\nThe changes to the course over the past 6 months have been nothing short of amazing.  They have removed 2-300 trees allowing sunlight onto greens and fairways that were previously shaded, wet, sometimes soggy, sometimes unplayable.  The vistas are magnificent.  The conditions are near tournament quality.  It is difficult.  I've seen 10 handicappers unable to break 90.  The rough is punishing. An approach shot that runs 6 inches off the green will not leave an easy up and in.  It will test your wedge game severley. The greens, while not lightning fast, have slopes that will ensure lots of three putts if you're in the wrong position.  The true test of a course is to play it over and over and never tire of it.  The Presidio is one such layout because it can be set up so many ways so as not to always be a challenge for all the shots you think you have. They can tuck the pins in places that require exact shot making or you're quickly looking a bogey or worse in a flash. Oh, did I mention the weather?  Always windy (especially in the afternoon) adding to its challenge. If you can catch it when it's calm (mornings) it's a lot tamer than later in the day. You better hit it dead straight here or you're in for a long day.  Need a lesson? Who doesn't!  Go see Dan Schawbe at the driving range; he's the best.

If you love and play golf, you need to play the Presidio Golf Course.  If you  either live in the Bay Area or find yourself just here for a visit, then the Presidio is a must.  Again if you are looking for a challenge then the Presidio golf course is for you. It will challenge your whole game.

You will be able to complete 18 holes as a foursome in 4:40 or better at the Presidio thanks to the efforts of the new director of golf Mike Fish. This new pace of play rule is enforced by the player assistants so keep up with the group ahead and have a great round. Remember bring your \"A\" game and tee it up at the Presidio.
