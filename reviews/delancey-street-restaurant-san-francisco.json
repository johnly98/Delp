She saw they had good reviews on Yelp, so we headed in. \n\nThe first thing I noticed was that they had a reasonably priced menu despite being in San Francisco and by AT&T Park. I decided to get the crab cake benedict and Taylor ordered the half order egg benedict.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and brought out water and bagel chips and butter when we arrived. Our food followed shortly after. My crab cake benedict was pretty well done. The eggs were perfect but there was something a little lacking from the crab cake. \n\nOverall I would definitely come here again if I'm headed to a game around weekend brunch time. The mission of this cafe is awesome and that in and of itself would have me come back even if their food was just okay.", "author": "Olivia C."}

In 1991 Silbert opened the restaurant as the centerpiece of her live-in drug rehabilitation center. All the proceeds from the restaurant after food costs go directly to help the center's residents learn the skills, values and attitudes needed for living a productive drug and crime free life.\n\nI started with a beer. It was cold and perfectly poured. I can't stand flat beer, so my first sip immediately lifted my mood! \n\nThe food choices at Delancey are many and the plates are certain to be filling. In this visit I took the \"boring\" path and opted for the grilled fish of the day (can't recall what the fish was!) which came with grilled green beans and a couple of other side items. It was perfect!\n\nOur friend who lives nearby insisted that we should share a sundae; talk about sin!

The ambience is quite nice, quaint and charming. Comfortable seating in the booths for our group, except my husband and I sat at a table for two. The booth would only hold six people each. Restaurant is well lit by natural sunlight and lighting fixtures throughout.\n\nThe wait staff are mostly young men given a second chance in life. My husband knows about the Delancey Street organization through a couple who were once in the program back over 40 years ago. The couple started their own group in San Jose (Future Foundation) and my husband was given a second chance in his troubled life in the early 80's. There is common ground between my husband and the waiters. Conversation was very engaging and pleasant - sharing of experience and wisdom of being on the same road to recovery.\n\nSheila was the main lady leading the way in accommodating our group and making sure all of us were doing fine. She served all of us dessert (biscotti, plain or chocolate dipped). The service by the waiters was superb, very attentive and courteous. May they always maintain their cool demeanor and kindness.\n\nEats: Cheeseburger with fries for husband. Half of rotisserie rosemary and garlic chicken with grilled asparagus. Cheeseburger was okay, but slightly dry per my husband. The rotisserie chicken was a better choice for lunch - well seasoned, moist and on point. Fresh asparagus grilled to perfection. Soup of the day was a bowl of clam chowder soup, served with focaccia bread and pats of butter. \n\nOur waiter humored us when he served us the soup. He said he forgot the spoons. Okay I told him. I'm Chinese. I'm going to hold the bowl in both hand and drink that soup straight up from the bowl. That moment elicited a shared laughter. He actually had spoons for us.\n\nFinally, and I almost forgot to mention that the fresh produce on display was certainly inviting and a welcome sight to my eyes (healthy eye candy). The lunch menu looked appealing and the prices seem reasonable. Future visits are on the horizon. Thank you, Delancey Street Restaurant, for your attentive service and delicious food.", "author": "Carol C."}

The food isn't very expensive (especially given their location right on the Embarcadero), and it's very solid. The staff were really attentive and refilled my coffee...many times. Pretty sure I finished a whole carafe myself. \n\nI had the fried chicken sandwich, which was amazing. It was fried very nicely, and not greasy! With the side of potatoes, I was ready to be in a food coma. Delicious.  The salads looked huge, and I had a bite of my friend's kale salad. Also delicious, also spot on. \n\nI'd be down to come back to this place again and again. When I walked in, I came in after a couple of regulars, and the staff were so welcoming that I seriously want to be a regular. I live nowhere near here, but will make that commute to make myself a regular.  The staff were attentive enough - not so much that it's overbearing, but also not ignoring us completely. It took a while for one of my friends to get there (minor car accident on the way over), and the wait staff were extremely kind and patient. They made sure we had space at the table for an infant (approximately 5 months old), as well as the 3-year-old, and 6 year-old we had at the table. Child friendly? YES. At least for lunch. \n\nI read that it's a training school for people who formerly had substance abuse problems, and I'd never have guessed when you walk in.", "author": "Lily W."}

It is run by a foundation that gives people a second chance using innovative and inclusive methods. The servers there are going through this program. This is why I was interested in checking out the place - not necessarily the food. So when my family took a trip to San Francisco, I made sure it was on the agenda.\n\nBefore the rest of my party arrived, I asked our server if he'd be willing to share his personal experiences with Delancey Street. If you have the courage to ask this of your server, I highly recommend it. He spoke honestly about how he's trying to change his life, how the program isn't easy, how he never thought he'd be a waiter, but how every day gets better. Suuuper inspiring. Don't go to Delancey Street for the food, go for the inspiration.\n\nThat said, the food isn't bad either! The standout item for me was the warm chocolate pudding cake. My family liked the grilled fish of the day and the meatloaf. Prices were extremely reasonable, and tips go to the foundation. \n\nDon't miss this place on a visit to San Francisco!", "author": "Paula Y."}

The brunch items are some of the most affordable options the city has to offer (less than $10!), and the selection is expansive.

Remembered that the restaurant had good food and service at reasonable prices. For those that don't know, the restaurant is a training school of the Delancey Street Foundation, which was founded in 1971.  It is an organization that offers self-help for former substance abusers, homeless, ex-felons and others down in life so that they can have a second chance so that they can turn their life around. \n\nThis visit for our party of eleven was for a birthday celebration. Some of us arrived early and we were seated at our table by the host. The restaurant, which is on the Embarcadero is open, spacious and inviting with it tablecloth lined tables. Our waiter, Mohammed, greeted us and handed us the menus. Water was poured and baskets of housemade herb focaccia bread was brought out.  They bread was so delicious that it was happily refilled several times. \n\nAfter our entire party arrived and had a chance to check out the menu, Muhammed then described the fish of the day and answered our questions on the menu. We started with appetizers:\nFried onion rings - these were made the thin style. \n\nParmesan crispy kale - very crispy kale with fresh parmesan sprinkled on top. \n\nFried Pot stickers - six potstickers to an order \n\nCrispy calamari rings - Yes, it was all rings.  Sorry for the tentacle lovers. Came with an aioli sauce. \n\nCrab cake appetizer - one large lump crab cake per order.\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the Grilled Halibut with fennel puree and green beans.  Herb butter was piped into a hollowed piece of cucumber, which acted as a holder to spread the butter on the fish.  The fish was well prepared as it was tasty and moist. First time trying fennel puree. It was good, but it needed more seasoning.\n\nSlow braised lamb shank with root vegetables. Had a taste of the lamb.  It was tender and tasty.\n\nOther entrees of our party:\nBlackened meat loaf - This looked interesting. Not your typical loaf, but shaped like hockey pucks.  \n\nA French Special which included a French Onion soup, two crepes (chicken and grapes / ham and cheese) and a profiteroles.\n\n 1/2 BBQ ribs and chicken\n\nPetrale sole in brown butter\n\nGrilled salmon filet with light ginger glaze\n\nFor desserts, we shared:\nKey lime pie and the Meringue chantilly and had a taste of the profiteroles from our guest who ordered the French special.  The desserts were good, but were quite small in size.\n\nOverall, Delancey has not changed over the years. Good food at reasonable prices in a clean, spacious restaurant with friendly service from personnel getting a new start on life.", "author": "Al L."}

I'll be back because I believe in their mission, but just know that you will likely get good food, but probably not amazing.", "author": "Josh M."}

It feels like a combination of a classy sit-down restaurant and an old diner. I learned that the Delancey Street Restaurant is a training school for the Delancey Street Foundation, which helps people to rebuild their lives. Go read the story on their website! It makes me love this place even more. \n\nA group of us came here after a Saturday conference for a super late lunch. We were seated immediately and experienced some of the best service I've witnessed. Just the determined attitudes of our waiters were impressive, even more so after reading about how this restaurant helps them. \n\nFor my meal, I ordered the Buffalo Wing Burger, where the patty is dipped in buffalo sauce. Honestly I didn't know how they would pull this off and expected something dry, but it was phenomenal. Would highly recommend. The sweet potato fries were good too... Everyone around me kept stealing them off my plate. That's a good sign! What's most impressive is the beautiful location along the Embarcadero while maintaining relatively cheap prices of food for San Francisco. It's actually affordable to those that the Delancey Street Foundation supports, which I believe is the intention. \n\nLast but not least, there are private dining spaces down the hall! As an event planner, this makes me very happy. I'm already starting to think about the private events I plan that can be hosted here. This restaurant serves so many purposes -- I'm glad that it exists!", "author": "Stefanie C."}

The restaurant is in a pleasant neighborhood that is clean and charming. The restaurant itself is roomy but intimate inside and the staff could not have been friendlier and more professional. Even with our large group asking a million questions they were amazing! The mashed potatoes and banana split were huge hits with our party. The drink selection is limited to the specialty cocktails but they were all delicious especially the pineapple mojito. The appetizer selection was fun and varied, we tried everything but the stuffed jalapenos were really tasty. For dinner there are a variety of options mostly American but some international flair as well. There was a lentil dish and spicy vegetarian pasta on the dinner menu as well as more typical steak and fish offerings. This place would be great for a date, very romantic.

I was a little hesitant at first because the menu said it was chicken thigh.  I've had poor experiences before when the breast was not used, but theoretically the thigh meat should taste better .\nDelancey did not disappoint.  The chicken was thick and juicy , I was wondering if they changed it to breast meat and hadn't updated the menu,  The coating was crispy and held on tight to the chicken.    Fresh and crisp fixings inside, I didn't need to add anything.  Excellent.\n\nNot your thing?  The Reuben will not disappoint you either.", "author": "John W."}

We had the GRILLED PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM with roasted garlic & basalmic tomatoes and the REUBEN hot corned beef, gruyere cheese & sauerkraut on rye.  Fantastic meal before a ball game or take it into the park.\n\nAfter ordering the Rueben, I realized that I knew absolutely nothing about it, other than the fact that it's absolutely delicious. What makes it different from that other deli favorite, pastrami? Corned beef and pastrami are both beef cuts that have been cured and cooked. But that's where the similarity ends. Although brisket is commonly used for both, corned beef can also be made from lean round, while pastrami can also come from navel (plate) and round. Corned beef is first soaked in a salt water brine with pickling spices, then boiled.\n\nThe process for pastrami varies widely, but in general, the meat is first cured with a spice rub or soaked in brine. From that point, it's encrusted in peppercorns, then smoked. The beef may be hot-smoked all the way through; if not, it is then steamed or simmered.", "author": "Bevin H."}

Plenty of room between tables for a nice cozy set up and intimate experience.\nBar area is separated by a low wall with glass partitions. Nicely lit and very inviting.\n\nWe had dinner reservations for 6:00 but due to traffic were a tad late but the host was very gracious when we arrived. We did try to call and let them know we were going to be late, but our call was disconnected.\n\nFrom the 1st person who seated us to our server Jarod, everything was spot on and very, very professional. A server was setting up a table next to ours and was taking great pride in the presentation of the table, by checking every glass, plate and utensil for spotless presentation.\n\nSemi warm Focaccia bread with olives and grilled onions served with a very Virgin Olive Oil was served immediately after we sat down. We went right to work on this while we made our difficult meal choice. Difficult in that there were many wonderful choices to choose from.\n\nExtensive wine list, most around $6.00. Other alcoholic beverages were also available and also very reasonably priced.\n\nWe chose a Mixed Green Salad with 3 kinds of Beets, Bleu Cheese Chunks and roasted Pistachios all tossed in a delicate Balsamic Vinegar dressing. The greens were so fresh and crisp, beautiful Red, Purple and Golden Beets, \"chunks\" of Bleu Cheese throughout with no skimping on the Pistachios. Gorgeously presented / plated and absolutely delicious.\n\nMain course was the \"Large serving\" of Blackened Meat Loaf with fluffy buttery mashed potatoes and fresh green beans, cooked perfectly.  The Meat Loaf was seasoned with many wonderful herbs and had a touch of \"heat\" throughout. Also cooked perfectly and not the slightest bit dry. Of course this went beautifully with the Mashed Potatoes and fresh Green Beans, also cooked to perfection.  \n\nWe finished with a coffee, which was rich and robust and my guest and I tried the small profiteroles. My friend had hers with Chocolate Ice Cream and Carmel topping, I chose the Vanilla Bean I.C. and Chocolate Sauce. They were so dainty and just the right size to end a beautiful meal.\n\nOur server Jarod was so lovely and very professional and we even got him to giggle just a bit. We know serving might not be their profession of choice, but they execute it with aplomb, dignity, professionally and personally.\n\nOur entire meal came to $38.00. One you would have paid closer to $50.00 any where else.\n\nI was so pleased and impressed I will return as quickly as I can.\n\nA fine establishment indeed and one that deserves all this praise and so much more.", "author": "Marla B."}

Delancey doesn't cook it's gumbo with roux (which thickens and darkens the soup), so it's very watery and feels like it's lacking something.

My Sister and I hosted a remembrance and gratitude event for our dearly beloved, departed Mother in the Boardroom of the Delancey Street Restaurant. Our dear Mother's birthday was September 23rd and our desire was to host the event on that day. We did not have much time to plan, but with the professional and timely help we received from Leticia (head of catering), we were able to make this event a reality! We chose Delancey Street because of their history of helping others to uplift themselves. Our dear Mother believed in helping others also, which made Delancey Street a perfect fit! Well, everything was perfect! The staff was incredible, the food was excellent and the ambiance was just what we wanted. Leticia was also there to make sure everything went smoothly. \n\nAll of our guests were extremely satisfied with the attentive service the waiters provided! Truthfully, friends communicated their pleasure with the entire event to us for days after!\n\nAs I write this review, I have just returned from having brunch with friends at Delancey Street and again the service was impeccable! \n\nThere is no doubt Delancey Street Restaurant is one of my top picks!", "author": "jerry j."}

Found out that she had been here before with her former employer for a Christmas dinner. So, when she saw where we were going she was excited.\n\nThere were not too many people here when we arrived so seating was prompt. The menu was not too fluffy which was nice considering a lot of the restaurants in the area tend to have puffed menus!! \n\nI order the salmon and my lady ordered some kind of omelette. I also had a coke a while she had some coffee. \n\nThe people here seemed to be enjoying their meals. The mix of people here made for some interesting conversations as well! (Private conversations can be heard when you SPEAK LOUDLY!!! Making the conversation not that PRIVATE). \n\nWhen the food arrived I was ready. I was somewhat surprised to see such a small portion of salmon but I guess that is how you fool people I guess!!! The corn was good though. \n\nThe omelette that my lady ordered was good even though she didn't finish the whole thing. \n\nMy only issue was the payment. I gave the server/waiter my card and he said there was a problem with my card. That seemed odd especially when I received my card back it was BENT!!!! SERIOUSLY!!!!!! So, I paid with another card and went to the bank afterwards and they informed me of the mishandling of my card by this particular business. Apparently, it was a bad swipe of my card on the part of the waiter!! He most likely swiped my card to aggressively and almost broke my card, SLOW THE HECK DOWN!!! Secondly, my card is now partially bent thanks to him. WAY TO GO DUDE!!! SMH all day because of this.\n\nAnyway, the food was good. Not a blow you out of the ballpark kind of meal but enough to hit the spot until dinner! Will have to come back again for another meal to give my final verdict on this establishment. But, I would recommend this place. \n\n#tastethecornandbereborn", "author": "Robert F."}

We have had our monthly lunch meetings at Delancy's for years now. It is the best deal around for a small private meeting.\n\nThey have a decent menu for groups. I do have to say it can be challenging to work with staff there. They have almost zero flexibility in accommodating any menu changes. We often struggle with getting the staff to deliver food at the time we have requested. However you can't find another place in the city that offers a better deal for a group lunch. There are so few places with a private room and if they exist they have tons of extra fees tacked on. Delancy's is a great location, with $4 parking and close to transit. The staff is friendly and the food is perfectly fine. \n\nIf I was planning to host a shower or a small family party the only place I would consider is Delancy's. I've recommended it to many friends for such occasions.\n\nI've been to Delancy's for dinner as well several times and I've never had a bad meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-05", "description": "Murp.. good concept, fair pricing, but food was just mediocre.\n\nCame here for  a late night dinner on Saturday, they close at 11pm, and was surprised by the selection of items on their menu. \n\nSomewhat eclectic menu with everything from gumbo, to kale salad, and a few different items that i've never seen before.\n\nJust based on the items we ordered, i was somewhat disappointed. Service was fine, the restaurants and what it stands for is amazing and the work they do is admirable. \n\nNonetheless, the dining experience could have definitely been enhanced with better food. We ordered the calamari which was very bland, soggy, and lacked seasoning. Even with the tartar sauce, the appetizer was not appetizing.\n\nMoving on to the main dish, my bf ordered their seafood gumbo, served with a side of rice. The rice was extremely undercooked, still hard and the gumbo missing spices and flavor. Though there was a fair amount of broth, the amount of seafood was limited, and items appeared old and not fresh.\n\nThe entree i ordered was chicken something.. essentially, two pieces of chicken breast, pounded super thinly, and \"stuffed\" with cheese and prosciutto, with a mushroom sauce on top. Though the concept was intriguing and the execution fair, the flavor was not what i expected. I was hoping for a more savory dish, but the sauce was overwhelmingly sweet, and did not compliment the meats.\n\nOverall, for late night eats, if i'm in the area, i will return. However, i would not go out of my way for Delancey. Though I do support everything that they're doing here and the program is amazing. So for that reason alone, I wouldn't mind supporting this establishment again.", "author": "Diane T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-10", "description": "A few friends and I were walking down Embarcadero looking for a empty, well-reviewed place on Yelp for dinner on a Tuesday night when we stumbled upon Delancey. This was the first decently rated place that we found; however, not reading the reviews, I didn't actually realize what we stumbled into until after I came home and did my research.\n\nLet's do the dining experience first--this was a three star experience. So Delancey is great because they serve lots of super fancy stuff for insanely cheap prices. Cheap prices can usually make one pretty skeptical, but the ingredients and actual food is all alright. I got the seared peppered ahi tuna at $16, another friend got scallops at $10, and other friends got the gumbo and pasta all at insanely cheap prices. Both the ahi tuna and the scallops were pretty decent the portions were huge. So given the value of the food that you're getting, that's another star. It's so gosh darn cheap and pretty good. The server we had was a super nice and friendly dude as well!\n\nAnyways, I was thinking about the place because the star rating didn't quite match up to what I would typically expect of a four-star restaurant on Yelp so I came back and did some research and learned some pretty interesting things. \n\nAs many other Yelpers have touched on, the Delancey Street Restaurant is a second chance for former convicts/drug abusers, etc. They give them a place to live, a place to work, etc. All the tips go back into the program. I love this concept, and that's why this is a total five star place for me. I actually wish I knew that prior to eating there since I would have tipped higher had I known that this place has such a great mission. The food is alright, but the cause is really what pushed this into a oh dang this is an amazing restaurant/concept kind of place for me. \n\ntldr; go for the mission of the location--the food is okay given how cheap it is, but adjust your expectations reasonably, I think it's worth checking out!", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Awesome! \n\nParking is awful, highly recommend that you bus or walk. They have patio seats outside where you can view the pier, as well as plenty of seating indoors.\n\nThis place is great, and it is pretty cheap and affordable for everyone. Especially around Embarcadero. Pancakes ranged around $5, and specialties were around $7. I order a mimosa ($4, way cheaper than $7 ones from Mama's on Washington Square) and southern chicken hash and shared some silver dollar pancakes with my friend. \n\nThe southern chicken hash was delicious! I was really spectacle on what this is, took the risk and it turned out great. It's basically a round grilled patty, grilled with homefries (diced potatoes) and shredded up chicken, top with 2 poached eggs. The poached eggs came out to be overcooked, which is why this place didn't five stars. Guacamole and salsa were given on the side for you to flavor the hash. Noms.\n\n\nWould recommend and definitely come back again.", "author": "Jenny N."}

Rarely do all those things come together.\n\nThe food is classified as 'ethnic American food.' Don't worry, I didn't know what it meant either until I saw my southwestern chicken hash also had a side of guac and salsa. \n\nWe came on a beautiful Sunday fogless afternoon around 130ish. All the other brunch places in the city had a 1.5-2 hour wait (yes I called them all) but Delancey had only a 10-15 min wait - being that I live less than 10 mins walking distance away AND I always see this place so packed when we drive by, we decided to give it a try. \n\nA colleague of mine had mentioned the mission of the place last week but very briefly so I knew it was not your typical restaurant and it's to help those in need but I didn't know the extent of it. We got sat down right away outside next to the view of the bridge and I started reading and got so happy we chose this place! The servers and everyone who was helping us was super sweet and they did care. The money thay Delancey cafe make after cost goes back to their residents for food and housing which is amazing. Also the residents get to learn life skills to supplement their resume if/when they get new jobs. It really is an amazing cause!\n\nTHEN WE LOOKED AT THE MENU - HOLY CRAP!!! Everything under 8 dollars for BRUNCH?!?! In SAN FRANCISCO?!?!?! I was like omg let's get one of everything. That we did not, but we did get three dishes between two people and drinks with the free bread and butter before. For entrees, Bf got the eggs benny - not bad, it was a little sour due to the vinegar they use to make the poached egg but overall good. I got the southwestern chicken hash and it was decent, the inside was a little mushier and not as crunchy/defined as it could be with the potatoes but the taste was good - good complimented with the bread and guac which was my favorite part surprisingly? We also got a huge French toast and shared it, also not too bad. \n\nOverall, I echo my first statement. Decent food, great location with a beautiful view on a sunny fogless day, great service, and most of all, an awesome mission! We will be back for sure :)", "author": "Vanessa K."}

More lunch entrees that are served neither on bread nor buns would be appreciated. Starters would have been a nice option.\n\nThere were cold, toasted bagel slices on the table, with butter; a very odd offering that didn't appeal. Perhaps they'd run out of baguette?\n\nWe ordered a Caesar salad with chicken, a Caesar with salmon, and a burger. My husband enjoyed his burger but the home fries that accompanied it seemed right out of a freezer bag. \n\nThe salads had a vast amount of lettuce, a little too much raw garlic, and a smattering of the added protein in small pieces. The ratio seemed inadequate.\n\nThe location is great, and the restaurant itself is fine. The inside seating appears to be plastic.

So i tried it today and thought, probably should have continued to walk by..\n\nfirst, two stars means it is okay.  you won't be offended but returning will not be part the plan.\n\n1.  Service.  Starting with a disinterested host, who took a couple minutes to walk away from his conversation with a waiter to greet me; and a waiter who acted more in a perfunctorily manner than polite; the service is nothing special.  it is not bad but it is clear from what i saw that everyone wants to be some where else.\n2.  the ambiance is fine.  location is nice.  on the street side of the Embarcadero with a decent view of the bay.  The place is clean, the size is nice, not pressed on each other and everything appears to be relatively new (or at least not old).\n3.  Appetizer.  I had the Granny Mena chicken soup.  It turns out it is closer to a matzo ball soup with some strands of chicken.  Nothing special, not worth the price and you do not get much anyway.  they use a bowl this is slightly deeper than a plate..... \n4.  I ordered the Nacho Sliders.  Supposedly a burger with a nacho twist.  not sure it ended up that way.  the biggest thing with a slider is the bun has to be great and it was not.  not tasty.  the burger was dry, and the chip and other stuff on it was not really tasty,\n5.  I got the sweet potato fries with the sliders.  Here is the deal with the sweet potato fries: they have to be hot.  otherwise not worth the calories.  these were not hot, barely warm.  after the first few, not worth the effort.\n6.  okay, this is just me.  ordered a soda.  I do not like places that do not refill you soda.  figure it out, come up with a single price and stop having your waiter ask \"would you like to order another soda?\"  Given the first one came 80% filled with ice.....sure i would love to pay for another....I know it sounds petty but having worked in the industry for years, i know the cost of a fountain drink and the profit is outrageous, so just refill it....\n\nso, after reading the other reviews, i am sure this place could deliver for you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-12-17", "description": "Fancy restaurant at a reasonable price in SF?  AND you're helping a good cause?  Delancey Street Restaurant occupies a tiny space in a Venn diagram that I didn't even know could overlap.\n\n[BACKGROUND]\n\nI was first introduced to this restaurant by a friend who is an SF native.  Had I not been taken there, I don't think I would ever have dared to look at the prices, seeing that it's a nice-looking restaurant on the Embarcadero.  (For one thing, there are people standing outside who greet you and open the door for you... even most pricey restaurants don't have that service).\n\n[THE CAUSE]\n\nAccording to their website, Delancey Street Foundation helps \"former substance abusers, ex-convicts, homeless and others who have hit bottom\".  SF businesses suck up way too much of my money; I'm glad to be able to eat a restaurant while contributing to a good cause.\n\n[SERVICE]\n\nYou usually get the dilemma that cheap restaurants have cheap service, and expensive restaurants have snobby service.  At Delancey's, you get genuinely friendly service.  They remain equally polite even if you order nothing but an entree.  And what blew me away was one day when I came for dinner and mentioned that we were in a hurry.  We were in and out in 15 minutes--In N Out speed.  No we weren't stuffing our faces at lightning speed; they were just very efficient at taking our orders, bringing the food as soon as it came out of the kitchen, and preparing the check ahead of time.\n\n[AMBIANCE]\n\nIt's an elegant tan stucco building with a black and white stripe overhang at a corner.  It's especially charming for brunch with the sunlight pouring in through the large windows or, better yet, soaking up (virtually the only sunny area in SF) in the outdoor seating area with the gorgeous view of the waterfront.  You get the nice table clothes and all, along with real live colorful flowers.  I know I'm going on forever with this review, but I also wanted to note that the chairs are very plush and comfortable.\n\n[FOOD]\n\nThey have online sample menus, which gives you a pretty good idea (including prices), but the actual menu varies slightly.  What I love most is their Heart Healthy Spa Specials section for delicious healthy choices under 500 calories.  Haha every time I adore the term \"spa specials\".  It sounds so luxurious so you don't feel like a deprived health freak.\n\n(+++) COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: fresh, fluffy, house-made  bread!  There's a decent portion so you won't go hungry even if you order a spa special.  You get thinly sliced assorted toasted bagels in addition to regular bread for brunch, and a variety of different breads (some have dried fruit or herbs) for dinner.\n\n(++) 3 EGGWHITE SPINACH & MUSHROOM OMELETTE, $6.95 (with fat free garlic & chive schmear, served with bagel thins & apple butter): The one time you can get a satisfying omelette without feeling like a fatty.  It's made with gruyere cheese which adds a good flavor but isn't too rich like other cheese omelettes.  The apple butter is cinnamon-y like apple pie jam P:\n\n(+) POTATO PANCAKES, $4.50 (with sour cream & apple sauce): Standard potato pancakes, good for getting your brunch hash browns fix without having to swim through a pool of potatoes.\n\n(+) MIXED MAKI ROLLS, $5.95 (chef's selection with pickled ginger & wasabi): The presentation is simple and beautiful.  However it's artistic at the expense of good sushi.  There is so little sashimi that you mainly taste vinegar rice and seaweed.  Not bad, but very different.  The accompanying slaw is crunchy and tangy.  Tip: the wasabi is very spicy; most restaurants dilute it much more.\n\n(+++) WARM VALRHONA CHOCOLATE PUDDING CAKE, $4.50 (with coconut ice cream, made to order): Must try!  I'm usually not a fan of chocolate cake, but this is lava cake like no other.  The warm gooey fudge filling mixed with the light chocolate cake contrasts the refreshing coconut ice cream.  You'll never experience such a masterpiece of diverse textures, flavors, and temperatures.\n\n(++) ORANGE GINGER CHICKEN MEDALLIONS, $10.95 (with citrus apricot couscous): The chicken slices are very thin, but an intensely flavorful mix of sweet and spicy.  It comes with a side of stir-fried vegetables, and the couscous is a very nice change from rice/pasta/potatoes.\n\n(+) DAILY VEGETARIAN STEW, $10.95: When I came, it was a pumpkin puree with tomatoes and garbonzo beans over couscous.  It was a soothing winter dish, and expect the consistency to be a bit soupy like stew.\n\n[GOOD FOR...]\n\nWhile I enjoyed brunch and dinner, I would recommend coming for brunch.  It's a very good deal considering how pricey a nice brunch is, plus you get to enjoy the Embarcadero ambiance (the cloest to Socal in SF).\n\n[THE VERDICT]\n\nFancy restaurant, reasonable prices, helping a good cause, impeccable service, memorable ambiance, delicious food, healthy options... no wonder I can write such a detailed review.  I'm actually at the character limit kthxbye", "author": "Edna C."}

Well, with the exception of cheaters. They deserve their wee wee to be cut off. Lorena Bobbit style. Muahaaahaaa. I'm kidding...\n\nSomething that I hold dear and close to my heart is giving back to community. I've been a very bad girl with my [lack of] volunteering activities so I was happy that my friends choose Delancey Street Restaurant for my surprise birthday brunch last month (thank you guys!). If I can't volunteer my time, at least I (we) can contribute money to a good cause and get a meal out of it with beautiful waterfront views. \n\nDelancey gives a second chance to former convicts and former drug abusers with a home and marketable skills with no cost to taxpayers. This waterfront restaurant is huge and can accommodate large groups in the hundreds (they have private rooms). The d\u00e9cor is a bit dated but all tables have crisp white linen cloths with fresh cut flowers adorning them. They also have a lovely outdoor patio that you should take advantage of on those rare warm days in SF. Metered street parking was easily found but meters run till 11 pm at $3.50 an hour. They also have valet parking for only $4. \n\nDelancey's menu is massive with over 40 items on their lunch menu, over 40 items on their brunch menu, and over 60 items on their dinner menu. Everything on the menu is CHEAP. Less than $7 for Eggs Benedict. $3 Mimosas. Are you phucking kidding me? You won't find prices as cheap as this especially in this area. AND, they take reservations so there's no wait for brunch.\n\nWhile the prices are very cheap, please don't expect Top Chef quality food. Apparently, those who gave low ratings bashing Delancey, delusionally thought you can get stellar food for IHOP prices at a multi-million dollar estate. I'm sure can get a nice ladyboy for that price too in the TL. *rolls eyes* Anyhow with such a large menu, there's bound to be hits and misses. Overall the food is decent but knowing that your money is going to a good cause makes it taste even better. \n\nAs highlighted on Yelp, I went with the Eggs Benedict ($6.95): http://bit.ly/176AU9x. One of the quintessential parts of a solid Eggs Benedict is the perfectly poached eggs with a yolk that oozes out like lava upon cutting through. They totally hit this one out of the ballpark: http://bit.ly/1i1YXpm. I've been to many expensive restaurants that manage to phuck this one up big time so I was very happy with my yolk porn. The slice of ham atop the slightly chewy english muffin was too thin but the oozing yolk and deliciously creamy hollandaise sauce made up for it. The home fries needed to be fried longer as they were a bit underdone but I usually don't eat much of my potato side so I didn't care. \n\nI would stay away from their omelets and steak & eggs because my friends who ordered these items didn't like it. Stick with the Eggs Benedict and you'll be happy. \n\nService was very pleasant, professional, and attentive even when they were slammed.

I guess wallet-friendly prices, but Delancey Street Restaurant checks that box too. My friend and I went for Sunday brunch here, and there wasn't much of a wait, which was great.\n\nOur meal started off with some bagel chips, which were just good. The chips are made from a variety of bagels too, such as plain and cinnamon raisin. The highlight of the meal was my Southwestern Chicken Hash, which was shredded chicken with potatoes, topped with two perfectly poached eggs, paired with salsa and guacamole. It was flavorful and the combination of eggs and hash was genius since the hash soaked up the egg yolk. My friend really enjoyed her omelette too, so two thumbs up from us!", "author": "Julia N."}

Its kind of annoying to read the few negative reviews from people who have champagne taste and beer wallets. \n\n1. Ive been going to Delancey Streeet restaurant for almost 20 years and the quality of their food and service has remained consistantly good.  Yes, there are times when food may be delayed but that happens in all busy restaurants that has a loyal clientele competing with walk-ins and tourists. \n\n 2. I have watched hundreds of \"trendy\" restaurants open, and close their doors while Delancey Street has been in business. Locals are the bread and butter of the restaurant and both the management and the staff knows who we are.\n\n3. The people who complained about the food not \" having enough flavor\". Go somewhere else! Delancey Street serves  \"Traditional American Food\".  There are plenty of fusion restaurants in the city that will dump chipotle seasoning or curry powder on your food. Restaurant have to cater to a large clientele of people with varying tastes. \n\n4. Delancey Street is located in a parking friendly location where you can bring your entire family and the view along Bay is priceless. \n\nTo the management of Delancey Street.

Additionally, I am surprised to see positive reviews here. In skimming them, it seems to me that at the very least the food and service is inconsistent.\n\nI'm hoping the Delancey will listen to these negative reviews. There is no reason the food can't be better. \n\nWe had dinner here.\n\nThe space, though not very up-to date, is pleasant. Management could stand to spend a few dollars to freshen up the plastic covers for the menus. They are old, and crinkled, and do not instill confidence in the reader.\n\nOur waiter, though very sweet and well-meaning, was not able to answer many of the questions I had about food, and had to run back and forth from the kitchen for answers.\n\nI sent back the warmed olive appetizer. It was obscenely salty. We were told,\"That's how it's served,\" when our waiter communicated with the kitchen. Not our waiter's words. The sweet and spicy cauliflower app, drowning in some sriracha mixture, was pedestrian, at best. \n\nOur fish was drowning in oil on the plate. My swordfish, though fresh, was over cooked. The celery root pur\u00e9e was so bland that it was inedible. The cucumber garnish with spiced butter floret had time traveled from the '80's. I was assured that the focaccia, was fresh and delicious. Ok, so they got the bread right. \n\nThe wine and cocktails were quite nice.

We had been seated at a very nice table outdoors, and given our menus. We made a decision on wine and an appetizer, and waited for a waiter.  Two tables opposite us were seated after us, orders were taken, and both received their drinks. Still, no waiter came to our table. We did the obvious: closed our menus, looked around, and tried to not get frustrated. Then, after our neighbors received their food, a waiter came and asked us if we were ready to order. Trying to keep our cool, we ordered our wine and appetizer. We waited another 15-20 minutes before I went inside to inquire about the progress of our order.  It was when I returned to our table that we decided not to wait any longer. We left and weren't happy.  I hope this event was a \"fluke\", and doesn't happen often at Delancy Street, but truly, with all of the wonderful restaurants in S.F., why would we take a chance and go there again?", "author": "Claire C."}

I had it with baby back ribs and collard greens with a sweet potato pie. Ribs were tender and juicy. Meat comes right off the bone. Collard greens were delish as well. Mmm and the refreshing cool sweet potato pie! A perfect meal, all for $11.95! What a great deal! \n\nI also had potato cakes with a smoked salmon and chives cream topping. Really good appetizer. Flavors went well together.\nThey had a halibut special for dinner which I tried as well. Grilled with veggies and a jambalaya rice. Very good portion size. Halibut was cooked perfect just needs a little seasoning. But nothing a squeeze of lemon and a dash of salt couldn't fix.\n\nI finished dinner with a warm chocolate pudding cake with coconut Ice cream. Mmm ooey gooey goodness!

The onion focaccia was great by the way.\n\nOverall this is a great restaurant that serves very good food. You can't beat what you pay for. Quality food at an amazing price.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-05-30", "description": "It kills me to rate this restaurant so low, but this is how I feel about them since they remodeled and changed everything.\n\nI have been coming to Delancey's for more than 10 years.  In fact, it was one of my two favorite restaurants in the city, and a place I always came with dates/friends/family members.  The service was normally good, the food was normally good, the pricing was cheap, you could always get in without a reservation, and it was quiet enough you could have a nice conversation without shouting at one another.  Additionally you could feel comfortable hanging out at your table visiting after dinner, without felling like you are being cursed by your waiter or patrons waiting for a seat, because it's large enough there are nearly always open tables available.  Unfortunately, my first visit back to Delancey's after the remodel was anything other than a pleasant experience.  \n\nThey have significantly increased the prices of their menu items, while reducing their portion sizes.  I had normally ordered their ribs, but asked to substitute their wonderful garlic mashed potatoes for the collared greens.  That had never been a problem before, but now the waiter said they would no longer make substitutions.  Huh?  \n\nAlso they have now made two sizes for many of their meals.  Their new normal size, is half the size of the old portions, but more expensive.  I ordered a \"large\" portion of their famous meat loaf and received a smaller portion of food than the old normal portion, for nearly double the price.  Their new rectangular plates were clearly designed to look like the plate was more full with less food!\n\nOn their ribs, they also nearly doubled the pricing for the old portion size, now called \"large\", buts also discontinued including the sweet potato pie with the ribs meal.  Now the new \"normal\" size portion is more expensive then the old pricing, but you only get half the quantity of food.  If you order the new \"large\" portions, you will be getting the old quantity (without the sweet potato pie), but will pay nearly double the price.\n\nI could go on with an assortment of other disappointments with our visit, but you get the idea.  \n\nWhen reading a couple of the recent reviews touting how wonderful the \"newly remodeled\" Delancey's is, I can't help but wonder if these glowing reviews aren't paid or false reviewers?  The changes of the remodel are not that significant, the menu items have only minor changes, but the portion sizes are smaller, and the prices have nearly doubled.  I don't understand how anyone who has been a fan of Delancey's can see the changes as being anything worthy of such glowing review?  \n\nFor more than a decade this has been one of my two favorite restaurants in the city, and one I have recommended to others, but no more.", "author": "Steve C."}

I did not know about that when I went there for brunch with my friend this morning though, as there was nothing visibly different about these people working there; neither did I feel any strange vib about them. If anything, I just noticed they were very nice and attentive. \n\nWe were at the nearby Pier 39 shooting photos and were hungry afterwards, so my friend suggested trying this place. Luckily we got a spot for street parking near the restaurant for $1.50 for one hour, which is way cheaper than the $7 per hour rate at the garage across from Pier 39. \n\nWe walked in and waited for only 5 minutes before were seated. The place was packed and the crowd was an older crowd with a family-restaurant atmosphere. We got nice view of the pier and Bay Bridge from our table. \n\nThe food arrived very quickly and the prices were so low I could not believe it. For $6.95 I got a big French Omelette with grueyere cheese and mushrooms inside, and roasted cubed potatoes and two small slices of wheat toast on the side. The omelette was cooked perfectly, warm and fresh, albeit there was nothing fancy about it. My friend had the Rib Eye Steak & Two Eggs sunny-side up, which was also good. He did complain that the eggs were a little bit too oily though. The potatoes looked a little too dark, almost like they were burned, although when I tried them they were actually very tasty and the inside was cooked perfectly. \n\nThe brunch menu was very simple and there is even a section for healthier choices with everything under 500 calories and egg-white omelette and the like. \n\nI can see why this place was packed and received an overall 4-star rating. If I'm nearby and want a quick, no-fuss, solid American meal, I would definitely come here again.", "author": "Claire W."}

Very easy to locate, just find the green striped blind that covers the patio filled with chairs and table shaded with umbrellas for outside seating. \"Delancey Street Restaurant,\" written in white bold caps with a black background - now, that's easy to find. Indeed from the outside, the restaurant seemed like a place for a four-dollar-sign place representing that this place must be an expensive eat. But, don't be fooled by the book's cover - the restaurant is a cheap eat.\n\nLet's start with PARKING: in the most simplest form - it was hard to find. My group of friends circled the block about five times until we finally decide on valet parking, which was $4, and it was worth it.\n\nEnter the room, it's dark with little spics of lighting. I was greeted by servers and bus boys in nice, elegant suiting with a bow tie. I felt I was in a classy restaurant especially seeing the tables with wine glasses, forks, knives, napkins, and menu neatly set. \n\nGOOD FOR LARGE PARTIES: Looking around the restaurant, there were many huge round tables filled with families and friends gathered for a birthday - many of them sang birthday songs. When I went to the bathroom, I pass through a few private rooms, about 3 large rooms, and they were filled with people having dinner.Our event was for a birthday dinner serving 15 people and I was surprise that they were able to fit so many of us.\n\nFOOD: a disjunct relationship between the food and the restaurant. The presentation and some item quality did not match up the elegant-look of the restaurant. It was a bit confusing, but the price tells it all. Here's what our group had:\n\n1. Grilled Rack of Lamb: $14. The soft lamb came in a huge plate with mushed potatoes, & saut\u00e9ed squashes. Meat was easy to chew and flavor was delicious - the lamb smell was not over powering, it was just right. 4 stars.\n \n2. Bourbon Glazed Rib Eye Steak: $14 I order medium rare and it came out medium rare - just right. The steak had grill marks on it, which was pretty cool, came with mashed potatoes and corn in a cob. 4.5 stars. \n\n3. Slow Braised Lamb Shank: $11. Came with a HUGE lamb shank! bottomed with mashed potatoes and vegetables - such as carrots and mushrooms. 4 stars.\n\n5. Crab Cakes: $ 12. With lime-y zesty mango and salsa served with crunch green beans. The crab cake itself was too dry and not as tasty, in other words, I had better and I didn't like it all that much. 2 stars.\n\n6. Sweet Potato Pie: apparently no one liked this in our table. It came in a huge slice and it didn't hit the spot. 2.5 stars.\n\nBIRTHDAY PEOPLE: the birthday girls got a drink on the house. It was some fruity orange-wine drink. 5 stars to the drinks.\n\nSERVICE: fantastic service! Gave us bread when we asked for more. Checked up on us every once in a while, but was not annoying. Servers had perfect timing! 5 stars to service!\n\n**OVERALL:  Delancey Street Restaurant is a place for a perfect outing for big parties, small prices, and great times! 4 stars!", "author": "Mindy Y."}

Sabrina, the private dining coordinator, was wonderful to work with. She made sure that everything was perfect for our big day, including getting our wine bottles chilled when my family brought them to the restaurant, making sure all the food was prepared nicely.\n\nThe food and service were excellent! Like many of the other reviews mention, Delancey Street has a wonderful mission- to give people a second chance. My husband and I love this mission and that is why we picked this place for our luncheon. Delancey Street surpassed our expectations. We had a five course meal for 20 of our closest family members.  We were even able to bring our own wine (for a small corkage fee). \n\nOur menu consisted of : \n1. Appetizers: Bruschetta and Lightly Fried Artichoke Hearts  and Soup: Cup of homemade Roasted Potato & Arugula Served with assorted housemade flat breads\n2. Salad served with a wine poached pear and honey cayenne pecans, Organic Field Greens with Balsamic Vinaigrette\n3.Pasta: Kimi's Pasta Pesto  \n4.Entrees:Choice of Crab Cakes with mango papaya salsa and wasabi udon noodles with green onions, pickled ginger and toasted sesame seeds, Grilled Filet of Salmon with a light soy glaze served with spicy rice and saut\u00e9ed vegetables, Oak Fired Barbecue Chicken or Baby Back Ribs or Combo served with french fries, Seared Sea Scallops served with mango papaya salsa and organic field greens with Balsamic Vinaigrette\n5.

Even the Grilled Salmon Filet comes to just $9.95.

The hash was perfectly crispy on the outside and super filling. Unlike other places, Delancey St doesn't skimp on the meat, leaving you with all chunks of potatoes. You can actually taste the chicken with every bite. I definitely recommend this dish!  \n\nStrawberry Banana Smoothie (3.25) - Hands down one of the best smoothies I've ever had.

For being two stops from Embarcadero, great views of the bridge, and just being an all-around good cause place, this is a well-kept secret that should be shared.\n\nFirst off, their beer selection and prices were basically as good as if you'd bought bottles from the store. I got a 22 oz. Boont for $4.50, which I think is like $5.50 at the corner store. That's crazy! They could raise the price for that if they wanted. \n\nSecond, the food prices were great. I got the garlic shrimp fettuccini for 10.75. They could've charged 16.75 for it and I wouldn't have batted an eye. However, when I got it, it was a little salty and I would've liked some more veggies or something in there. Still, for $10.75, that's an incredible deal.\n\nThird, really great and attentive service. They had a lot of folks working there and were able to accommodate our party which was supposed to be bigger than it ended up being. How awesome is that, to be at a dinner spot in the city on a Friday and they aren't all stuck-up about how \"every member of your party has to be here\".\n\nI'd love to come back for everything except the food. I think they cater to older folks b/c everything I tried from my plate and others was just a little too salty.

And knowing the background and how they contribute to society makes it a no-brainer to support them. \n\nGood causes aside, I've never had a bad meal here. I usually hit them up before a Giants game, since they're right down the street from AT&T Par, just a couple of short blocks away, They offer outdoor dining as well, which makes it a perfect spot for a quick meal before a baseball game. \n\nWhenever they have pork chops on the menu it's my go-to. Always terrific, always perfectly cooked. Waitstaff are courteous, well groomed and professional - a nice change from the arrogance often encountered in restaurants of similar ambiance where no one seems to mind 5\" long beard hairs on their water glass so long as the waiter's skinny jeans are reasonably clean. Call me old fashioned - I prefer waitstaff to be friendly and professionally dressed, and at Delancey Street it's just par for the course. And I also love that I can be wearing shorts, flip flops and a tie-dyed Giants shirt and no one at the restaurant bats an eye. Casual fine dining - my favorite combo. It's fun to dress up for a nice restaurant, but it's also nice to be comfy and still enjoy a quality meal. Besides, who wants to wear a suit & tie to a Giants game, right? \n\nThey keep the menu relatively simple - a variety of proteins, with side dishes that compliment them well. They treat veggies with respect, always al dente and light handed with seasonings & oils. My favorite starch is the garlic dirty mashed potatoes, which are always perfect. \n\nI cannot say enough good things about this restaurant, their staff or the cause behind it. And even if it weren't a great cause (which make no mistake, it totally is) I would still go to Delancey Street Restaurant every time I'm in The City. I love this place. Go there - read about what they do, and enjoy a terrific meal at a reasonable price while supporting a great cause: people.", "author": "Scott Z."}

Maybe the mimosa. (which isn't bottomless, BTW).  But that's about it when it comes to breakfast.\n\nFinding seating has never been an issue. And service has always been good. Most the servers are prompt when it comes to taking orders and the kitchen seems to churn out orders very fast. And most importantly, folks here smile!\n\nThe eggs are average. The coffee is good. The sandwiches aren't too bad either. But man, the sausages & potatoes need some tweaking and less deep frying.

My husband and I had a drink at the bar after seeing our visiting friends off, and the bartender filled us in on what the Delancey Street Foundation is and does. You never expect a place to both serve up a mean spicy margarita AND change people's lives -- but that's what this restaurant does.\n\nService for our party of seven was excellent, the food and drinks were great, and everything was more affordable than I expected. Delancey Street is also very kid-friendly; something in the gentle vibe of the place puts even very young people at ease.\n\nKeep up the good work, Delancey Street Foundation!

Wines were really reasonable too. For that view of the bridge, and Embarcadero was great. \nThey start you off with bread, butter and olive oil.

The food was always a terrific value, but more like good home cooking or cafeteria food.  Service was consistently excellent in an undistinguished atmosphere. Dined here last week, and was very pleasantly surprised that the decor and menu have been moved up a few notches without sacrificing the service or value. \n\nVery relieved to find that the lamb shanks, my go-to dish, is still on the menu, and delighted to discover a couple of excellent new choices.  I began with a small beet and arugula salad, which was crisp and flavorful.  Also a huge portion; I can barely imagine the large salad!   Then, I had the fish of the day (halibut) which was prepared perfectly.  The green beans served with the fish exemplify the changes at Delancey; previously vegetables had seemed like they came from a steam table -- these green beans were bright and al dente.  My dining companion had the scallops, which could become my new go-to dish; they were as delicious as they were attractively plated.\n\nVery happy about these changes.  The wine pours are still generous and the service is still wonderful.  Will definitely continue dining here regularly.", "author": "Barbara B."}

Delancey Street has a wonderful mission, and it is not difficult to support their efforts by dining at this restaurant.\n\nFor one, the service is higher than you would expect from any other restaurant, particularly at this price point. There's a doorman, a host, valet service, and a couple folks around to fill your water glass. The tables have white linen tablecloths, and there's a view of the bay that can't be beat.\n\nThe food is really good, but don't come here expecting to have a trendy culinary experience or dining on haute cuisine. This isn't that type of place. That said, the food is always good, and I've never had a bad dish there. The lamb shanks are amazing and tender, with the meat almost melting off the bone. Meatloaf is another menu standard that always satisfies.  The salads are likewise always fresh and flavorful, and the wine list is very solid.

I was looking at reviews and most of the higher rated places were all booked up on a Friday night. This place had great reviews and I was able to get a reservation without any problems. I appreciate the fact that the restaurant is a non profit organization that helps people who are down on their luck with changing their luck around by providing housing in exchange for work.\n\nWhen I walked in, I was given an option of where to sit and selected a booth. It was nice and intimate. Our waiter handed us our menu's and I immediately noticed how inexpensive the food was, which would end up costing double or triple in upscale restaurants. Everything looked good but we went with the combination chicken/ribs plate, which came with collard greens and a big slice of sweet potato pie. I got the bourbon steak with garlic mash and a big corn on the cob. We split the potato latke appetizer. While we waited the waiter brought us out a bread basket along with some olive oil for dipping. The focaccia bread was pretty good but I was a little dissapointed that it wasn't warmed up.\n\nThe service was pretty attentive and the waiters were very helpful. The food came out quickly, though it wasn't piping hot. My steak was OK but didn't have much flavor. The garlic mash was delicious and you could definitely taste the garlic. My hubby's ribs and especially the chicken was moist and delicious. It was heaping portions where we honestly couldn't finish everything. The collard greens were just OK but a bit mushy and the potato latkes were perfectly crispy. I know good latkes because I grew up with slavic food.

All 7 of my friends approved of the restaurant.\n\nMy group got a variety of the items on the menu, most were delicious!\n- Appetizer: Crab cake -- Deeeeelicious and a decent amount of crab, LOVED the coleslaw\n- Appetizer: Mushroom something with garlic and tomatoes -- Delicious, but I preferred the crab cake.\n- Appetizer: Calamari was a little bland\n- Entree: Seafood Gumbo had flavor through and through. I was surprised at how much seafood it came with given the location of the restaurant and price of the dish.\n- Entree: Mr. Waiter recommended the ribs and said no one has complained since he started there (2 weeks ago). He was right on the money! The ribs were DELICIOUS and it was enough for me to take home. My friends were jealous that mine came with sweet potato pie (aka dessert). It was ginormous, so I shared. :)\n- Dessert: Cheesecake was delicious, but NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORANGE CHOCOLATE Creme brulee! Smooth and tasty, mMMmmmm... \n\nService was AWESOME. Mister waiter had only been there for 2 weeks, and service for a table of 8 was so smooth. He had the help of other waiters, but I had absolutely no complaints about the service. It was Halloween weekend, and of course my group wanted to take a gazillion pictures. The waiters were extremely patient and took multiple photos of us.\n\nBoth location and parking were easy to find. \n\nCheck out the background story to this restaurant, it's a great cause.\n\nLOVE!!

I didn't even finish my main meal and dessert!!\n\nWe got the room for 2.5 hours, but went over that time by about half an hour. The servers were very friendly and kindly reminded us. This is definitely an amazing place to book your private dining, and it won't break the bank!\n\nPros:\n- Awesome service; servers were all so kind and friendly. Their timing with the food is also very accommodating to the speed we wanted. There was also a friendly and informational host and two guys in the front for valet and opening the doors.\n- Friendly, accommodating staff\n- Food for Sunday brunch was awesome and the sizes were generous!! I had the French toast and it was very delicious :) Dessert was ice cream that was super delicious too.\n- Great view: It's facing the Bay Bridge on the Embarcadero\n- You know your money is going towards a very good purpose! My fiancee and I love the Delancey Street Foundation and what it's doing to give people a second chance!\n\nCons:\n- There really wasn't any!! But my SF local friends thinks the place looks touristy since lots of tourists go there... but that doesn't bother me! I loved this place!", "author": "Shoua K."}

Place looked nice and cozy, luckily I found a good parking spot, and the food was really good! \n\nServers were nice but I wish they knew more about their menu. For example, I have never had sword fish more and I was given the option of blackened or grilled and I was asking the guy which way would have more flavor and would not be dry. He didn't know. 3 others from my party had questions about their dishes as well, he had no answer. He even asked his co-workers and they didn't know either. I would give a 3.5/5 for overall service.\n\nI didn't try all dishes at our table but here is what I did:\n- swordfish: came with rice, green beans, and squash. Rice wasn't cooked all the way but had good flavor and the squash wasn't that great. Fish was a bit dry and not too flavorful. I added salt and pepper but that didn't help much. Maybe it's the fish? But the beans were good, even though they are just steamed. 3.5/5\n- tiramisu: the only other I have had is at Olive Garden so based on that a 4/5. It didn't have too much of the coffee flavor and too much frosting\n- chicken quesadilla: very yummy! Loved that it had other veggie in it too. Not a big fan of the salsa, it was very basic. 4/5\n- some chicken linguini: this was really good. Pasta was cooked well, flavor were right 5/5\n- creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e: sweet of them to put a little candle on it for the birthday girl. Taste wise, it was good 4/5\n- complimentary bread: if you add the butter it's really good. Bread was soft and dipping it in olive oil was just fine. We asked them if they had garlic bread, they should have said no but instead they came out with the same bread pieces with a whole garlic on the side! Kinda weird why they would do that. We asked them how to eat it and he said I don't know, you wanted it. That was a bit strange. But for the regular bread I would give it a 4/5.\n- white wine: I don't know what it was called but it was really good 5/5\n\nIt would be nice if they asked for parmesan cheese over our food (like Olive Garden) but that's ok.\n\nI wouldn't go here because I wanted to. The only reason I would is if it was someone else's choice. I know of other places in SF that are way better.", "author": "A A."}

And the craziest part is that after tax and tip it was only $11! That sort of value for a dish I could have easily split is pretty amazing in SF.

All tips are considered donations, and all restaurant proceeds after food costs go directly to house, feed and clothe Delancey Street Foundation residents and teach all skills, values and attitudes needed for a successful drug-free and crime-free life in the mainstream society.\n\nOur server was a delightful guy whose name I unfortunately cannot recall, but who treated us like we were family.  He explained the Foundation's mission to us and told us that each and every person working at the restaurant was a resident working to make a better life.  He explained every item on the menu that we had questions about and even recommended a wine to go with dinner.\n\nI ordered the artichoke hearts appetizer to start.  They were lightly breaded and fried and the tangy marinade was complimented by the aioli dipping sauce on the side.  Hubby had the mixed greens.  For dinner I ordered the Chicken Picatta, which was served with a very light picatta sauce and just the right amount of capers.  My husband had the Caribbean Grilled Chicken Breast with mango sauce and avocado served with black beans and rice.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-17", "description": "I came here for dinner so if you're looking for a review that focuses on brunch, this isn't the review.  Delancey offers basically what I would expect from an American restaurant: steak, rotisserie chicken, grilled meats, and bbq.  If I were to take tourists, I would take them here so they can experience real American food.  I originally had Denny's as the embodiment of American food but Delancey beats Denny's tenfolds.\n\nI ordered the slow braised lamb shanks and was amazed at not only the quantity given, but the quality of the lamb, vegetables, and mash potatoes.  Combined with the red tail beer I ordered, this meal adds to the already good day I was having in the city.\n\nDelancey has a nice clean decor feel to it.  It's not too fancy and not run-down so it'll be a good place to bring someone on a date.  The view of the Bay Bridge and the surrounding waters give it a nice romantic view.  The friendly staff only adds to the positive ambience/vibe Delancey exerts.", "author": "Ronald L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-27", "description": "I hate to bash on a place like Delancey Street, especially because of the price and the great story behind the place, but unfortunately it was underwhelming. The restaurant itself is very nice and is right on the edge of the embarcadero and has a lovely view of the water. When you walk in the space is very open and it reminds me of a much nicer Max's diner. They have white cloths over all the tables, numerous booths, tables (both large and small), and tables outside. The restaurant is certainly cozy and inviting and the waiters are there to greet you when you walk in. The only issue is that because the restaurant is so large it can be extremely loud and the noise just resonates throughout the restaurant. \n\nFood sadly fell short and was disappointing. To start my mom ordered a mimosa, this was my first time ever having one, and I thought it was quite good. So I thought our lunch was off to a good start until our food arrived. I ordered the salmon fillet with the side salad. The salmon itself was fairly rough and chewy and about half was not seasoned. The other half was quite tasty, so I wish there was some consistency throughout the dish. It came with a basic side salad which drew no complaints from me. My mother ordered the fried chicken special of the day which was accompanied by beans, rice, and fried grits. I normally don't like grits, but they fry instead of that cheesy nastiness you may find at southern/cajun/creole restaurants. So i tried it and it was quite tasty because they add bacon in there to make it a little salty which was nice. The rice and beans were ordinary and nothing wrong nor special about them. The chicken was fried well with not too much batter and the meat was still moist. However it's huge downfall was the fact that it was extremely bland and was not seasoned at all. The portion of the plate however was good and it is hard to beat 7.75 for the plate. Ten dollars for a salmon plate is very inexpensive as well, but the flavor is certainly not there and you should definitely pass on it. To end the meal we had to try the sweet potato pie that most people rave about. My mom came to the restaurant over twenty years ago and that is the only thing she remembers. The pie comes out and it is enough for two people. They really do stack up the sweet potato filling which is excellent and the texture is just wonderful. It is not too sweet and the texture is not mushy at all. My only complaint is that the crust was way too dry for me. The pie I must say was my favorite part of the meal though!\n\nService had both it's ups and downs. I can break down the service into two parts because I guess our server had his break during our meal. Our first server was absolutely terrible, he might be new? He took our order and only came back to drop off our food. He was not too friendly and seemed shy. He did not ask how our food was or even walk by at all. Our second server was much better coming by to take our plates and refill our water. We ordered our sweet potato pie through him which he brought out promptly, and then came back a couple minutes later to check up on us. Service can be iffy here, but the servers are there to learn which I respect completely\n\nAmbiance: 3.5/5 Pretty much a huge/more upscale cafe \nFood: 3/5 Seasoning, Seasoning, and Seasoning!!\nService: 3/5 It's a learning process right?", "author": "Mitchell L."}

The serving was so tiny that my friends who had all received far larger servings felt so bad for me that they shared their food. To make matters worse, it was only lukewarm.

Considering the fact that it's usually impossible to walk into a sit-down tablecloth restaurant during rush hour without waiting 2 hours and/or paying an arm and a leg, and that the restaurant is a training school and revenue generator for the self-help Delancey Street Foundation, this place is a winner in my book.\n\nOkay so the food:\n\n(DINNER) Alejandrinos ($4.95): Just okay. Basically just mozerella sticks, not very much jalapeno flavor at all. There are 6 per order. I'm a lactard so obviously one bite of these was enough for me.\n\n(DINNER) Baby back ribs ($11.95): good and ENORMOUS (I could only eat half the ribs). It also comes with collard greens and an entire separate slice of pumpkin pie. I pretty much took home another meal in my to-go box from this, yay.\n\n(DINNER) Kimi's Pasta Pesto ($8.95): good, but pretty plain. Pretty much just pasta shells and sauce.\n\n(BRUNCH) Rib Eye Steak and Eggs ($8.95): Rib eye was thin but overall a good order.\n\n(BRUNCH) Strawberry Pancakes ($5.75): Good.

I'd passed by it many times when driving around SF, but now I live within walking distance, and there isnt too much stuff open at night in this area. The prices were decent, and i read later about the mission and the people who work at this place. Honorable, and heartwarming.\n\nAnyhoo,  I had a large spaten draft ($3!!), potato cake appetizer, and the ahi tuna with wasabi noodles, fatass, i know X_X. I was a little sad becaz the menu outside said that the tuna was $12.95, but it was $15.95 on the real menu due to suppliers doubling the price of fish, with Delancey not wanting to pass the entire cost on to their customers. It sounded interesting and I wanted to try it, so i...ate the cost, and the fish.\n\n- Potato cake appetizer was scrumptious. Two crisped potato pancakes with a schmear of cheese and a large slice of smoked salmon on top, about the size of an iPhone.\n- Ahi was seared and coated with crushed black peppercorns. The texture and balance of raw/cooked was quite good, but I think they could add more taste. The wasabi noodles were extremely tasty. They had the slight, nostril burning hint of wasabi in every bite, but it was well balanced with the soy ginger? sauce. A simple but well made side.\n\nYou also get bread and olive oil. The service was great. There was an unfortunate incident with some woman shouting about her receipt. Then she grabbed a plate of food and shattered it on the ground and ran away. Bitch. Unfortunate for any restaurant to deal with.\n\nIll prolly be here more often now that I know how cool and close the place is.\n\nMy name is Boris Yelpsin, and I approve this message.", "author": "Daniel S."}

What I typically tend to order are the salmon with miso glaze or the eggs benedict. The salmon is a very light choice but has a slight touch of the miso flavor, which is perfect for a light meal but still satisfies. As for the eggs benedict, it is so good! The eggs come with a side of home fries which are really soft and have great texture. The Canadian bacon is just the way I like it - more on the thin side rather than a huge slab of it. I recommend dunking the home fries in the hollandaise sauce for more flavor! \n\nBut the real winner here is the sweet potato pie. The texture is very soft and creamy while the sweet potato is not over whelming and is a perfect compliment to any meal - a definite must have but order it warm! \n\nThe service is very quick and friendly and every time I find myself seated right away.

Coming from Orange County to visit San Francisco my cousin decided to hold her wedding dinner here.

For example...When removing an empty plate on the table without excusing their reach or pardoning the reach.  Don't just reach in and grab, people are clearly having conversations.  Also, knowing the ingredients in the menu items would be fantastic.  I do give our server kudos for asking the kitchen as he did not know. \n\nThe food was average.  Nothing really spectacular.  I had the Mahi Mahi with the vegetables and \"spicy\" rice.  For dessert I ordered the Fudge Pie which was still frozen in the middle.  \n\nPrices were reasonable though for the level of service and quality of food we received. \n\nThe best part was the $4.00 Valet.

I honestly want to give this place two stars but I feel bad and I guess the ambiance, customer service, and amazing cause makes up for how lacking it is in the food. I found this place on yelp and with such great reviews, I was expecting to have a nice dinner with my friends. We were promptly greeted by a doorman and the inside of the restaurant seemed upscale, but not overbearingly so. The bread came out and we were all impressed at how flavorful and savory it was. My guy friends scarfed down like 3 pieces each because it was that good. All of their menu items sounded unique and delicious--and when we asked the waiter about which dishes he recommended, he so eloquently described them that we were sold.\n\nWhat I ordered-- The blackened fish of the day with pureed fennel and string beans. Honestly, I could've definitely made this at home...and probably could've made it better! The blackened fish was nothing incredible and the string beans tasted like they were literally just boiled without any seasoning at all whatsoever. Likewise, the pureed fennel tasted like watery tasteless mashed potatoes. My friends and I were confused at first what the pureed fennel was supposed to be and we actually thought it was just mashed potatoes done horribly horribly wrong. My boyfriend ordered a meat dish--not even sure what the name is anymore and I can't find it on the menu (perhaps they took it off because it was so bad), but we had really high expectations for that, especially since it was a whopping $18. However, it was extremely salty and none of the flavors complemented each other. I also ordered the appetizer crab cake to share with my friends and one puny little crab cake appeared on a plate. It was to say the least, underwhelming. I'm pretty picky and sensitive with my seafood so the slightest fishy taste throws me off. And this crab cake tasted like fishy bread. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those people who hate seafood. I LOVE crab. My other two friends ordered a pasta dish and the rack of lamb, both of which were decent, but also tasted like cafeteria food. We finished off with Herbie's Hot Fudge Sundae because we saw someone order it and it looked amazing. This time, it met our expectations. The fudge and whipped cream were delicious and tasted homemade.\n\nPrice/Value--The dishes, in my opinion, definitely did not live up to their price tag.\n\nFinal Verdict-- If I ever come back, it would only be for the bread and for the ice cream sundae. My friends and I joked that we should come back, eat the free bread and only order an ice cream sundae.

I know the restaurant is doing a good job when I find myself returning, even when its not baseball season.", "author": "Ed D."}

I knew this place was familiar...familiar, but why?\n\nI'm pretty sure I looked up \"high tea\" at some point, and this place came up. (Highly important: on the way out, I saw that they did have a sign for high tea, which starts at 3pm. Mental note to return to check this out on my own aqap)\n\nAnyway, I was starting to get really nervous, because the waiters were dressed so nicely, and everything was all fancy, and I'm just there in my derpy jeans and t-shirt (but at least everyone else at work was, too)...and as soon as we're seated, we are treated to some of the best service I've ever received. Woo-hoo! T-shirt and jeans in a fancy place! Check that off my to-do list...\n\nThe waiters were super nice, and holy wow, the menu has such affordable prices (the department head was shocked, too, saying that our 14-person-party was a cheap date), and the portions are pretty awesome. Ever since I've been in the city more often, I have not seen many places where I don't have to dish out some serious cash for such an extensive and lovely menu. Plus, for you folks that like having a pat-on-the-back, you can eat here and feel like you did something good - check out their main site, because what they're doing is straight-up goodness. But that is not even the best part.\n\nOh, and the best part? A fantastic dessert menu. Everything was basically under $5. OH. YES. Had I known this, I would have just not had lunch and ordered lots of desserts instead. As our waiter handed us the sweets menu, he said, \"I have to warn you - all of our chocolate and caramel is made in-house,\" which was awesome. I didn't get dessert this time around because three of my coworkers got the grilled meats, which came with a slice of sweet potato pie...and I mean, hey, they couldn't finish it, so it was all, \"Hey, are you gonna finish that, I just want to try some,\" and it was like, \"Yeah there's no way we can finish this\" and wow SWEET POTATO PIE. I would probably get that again with a side of ice cream. Yuuuuhhhmmmm.\n\nI really must try and come here for brunch when I can, because this is straight up ridiculous on the scale of wonderful service and decently yummy food. And sweet potato pie.

My parents and I decided to try it because my uncle and grandmother love Delancey Street Restaurant; I can definitely see why.  When my parents and I arrived, the host politely greeted us and informed us that brunch was being served.  I am not a morning person but breakfast is my favorite meal of the day, so I was quite ecstatic to see that brunch was being served at almost 3:00 PM.  Between deciding on what to eat, I couldn't help but read the history of the restaurant.  I've always known that a restaurant must be good if it has been in business for more years I can count on both hands, but the fact that the Delancey Street Restaurant strives to serve the community by providing a better life for those undergoing difficult circumstances is beyond amazing.  It is quite obvious that there is no corporate greed present because the prices are unbelievably reasonable.  $3.95 for challah and jam was well worth it!!  When came the time to order, I was initially thinking of ordering brunch, but when my mom decided to not order the Roasted tomato soup and grilled cheese for the latkes, I decided to order the combo.  The employee who took my order told me the Roasted Tomato Soup was the best tomato soup he ever had, and I couldn't agree more with him!!  Our waiter's recommendation for the Vermont cheddar grilled cheese was perfect and reminded me of a comfort classic. I also managed to try some of my dad's bagel platter.  The smoked trout and lox did not taste overly processed by any means, and the bagel was definitely a true New York style bagel!  The latkes were not overly greasy and contained the perfect amount of seasoning!! Good choice mom!  After such a savory meal, dessert was well needed!  My mom was in the mood for chocolate, so she chose the Chocolate Mouse; very light and delicious.  I chose the Ginger Bread with ice cream, definitely hits the spot any time of year because the strength of the ginger reminds me of the holidays and the ice cream was well needed on such a hot day.  Another employee with such great personality took out dessert order and my dad had a great conversation with the employee.  Delancey Street Restaurant definitely changed his life for the better.  And when the restaurant isn't busy, the conversations are quite interesting.  Since there is no set section for the staff, the teamwork and communication amongst the employees is greatly shown!!  After such a great experience, I definitely plan on coming here again!!  Not only does Delancey Street Restaurant serve amazing food at such a great price, I feel great knowing that the money used to pay for the meal goes to such a charitable cause!!", "author": "Sandra B."}

If you're not familiar, check out the Delancey Street Foundation's website. It's pretty awesome and definitely worthy of support.\n\nWe met with our friend R who lives a block away and is currently car-less, so the location was perfect for us to rendezvous here for a weeknight dinner.  Park on Delancey Street like we did and pay 25 cents an hour! Or valet for $4 in front of the restaurant.\n\nThe interior of the restaurant harkens back to (what I imagine when I think of) the Roaring 30s with elegantly attired hosts, waiters and servers (think starched collared shirts, slacks and bowties!) and a cozy, intimate dining room.  I was happy to see an assortment of families, couples and groups of friends enjoying their meals.  Throughout our meal, a lot of diners chatted casually with their waiters and servers, making me think there are a good number of regulars who frequent this adorable establishment.  Our server was awesome and went above and beyond to make us feel welcome.  When I couldn't decide between the gumbo and the meatloaf, I expressed my apprehension about gumbo usually being too salty.  He was happy to bring a sample of the gumbo broth from the kitchen, and boy, was it good! I was sold with its rich but not greasy broth with a huge kick of flavor and spice at the end.\n\nOverall, the food was good, but not amazing.  The gumbo was the big winner of the night over husband's chicken piccata (which was more lemony than creamy, yay!) and R's grilled salmon.  I packed home more than half after filling up on our appetizers of antipasti and calamari (if you're not a fan of olives, skip the antipasti which is mostly olives).\n\nThe food was probably a 3, but the service, ambience, concept and PRICE bump this up to a 4. The affordability of the dinner menu is almost unbelievable for the location across from the Embarcadero and the attentive service we received.  We ate very slowly and even lingered for an extra hour after finishing most of our dinner enjoying our conversation, but we were never hassled once.  In fact, our excellent server cleared our plates very discreetly (I was the slowest eater of our group), packed up our extra and let us linger to savor the company and the wine. \n\nHappy to return if we're in the area again and looking for somewhere that won't break our wallets.

The Foundation helps former felons, substance abusers and others who have hit rock bottom to start over and turn their lives around. I think it's noble for an organization to focus on giving people a second chance - many never get one.\n\nMy cousin Griselda D. and I arrived in between the lunch (ends at 3) and dinner hours (starts at 5:30) so the menu was limited. Considering its location, I was expecting a much pricier menu so I was pleasantly surprised to find that everything was under $10.\n\nWe split:\n- Rotisserie chicken dinner \n- Burger w/ pepperjack\n- Side salad\n- Caramel cheesecake\n- Ginger spice cake\n- Beers on tap were $2.50 (small) or ($3 large)\n\nThe food was above average (3.5 stars). The chicken was really flavorful, although I should have chosen dark meat as it would have been more tender. Out of the desserts, the ginger spice cake was my favorite :) \n\nI would definitely come back for lunch so that I can order from their regular menu. Service was good and I also like that you have a view of the bustling Embarcadero no matter where you sit. And, we scored a 1-hour parking spot one block away! Free parking in downtown SF is like finding gold.\n\nI recommend that you not only check them out for lunch/dinner, but read up on the Foundation: http://www.delanceystreetfoundation.org/ourstory.php", "author": "Mariela D."}

I eat omelettes often and while their omelette is not the best that I've eaten, it's still one of the top ones I've tried.

A waiter, I guess, dressed in white & a bowtie grabbed a wine glass to take away but then decided not too without saying anything.  Very unprofessional.  Another waiter brought us bread, asked if we wanted olive oil, we said yes & it was brought to our table promptly.  Several waiters walked by, made eye contact & kept wailking.  Nobody said the waiter would be with us soon.  Nobody asked for our drink order.  A couple of 2 was seated after us, they got greeted by waiters promptly & got their drinks. This went on for 20 minutes.  We waited patiently looking around & still no service.  When we decided to get up to leave, we were finally asked what was wrong.  We said we haven't been served & we begged to come back.  It was ridiculous!!! \n\nThe patio was nearly empty because of a windy cool day.  The restaurant was not even half full.  DON'T GO HERE IF YOU WANT GOOD SERVICE.\n\nThe sad thing is I've been here before and the service was good.

I had visited this restaurant all on the basis of my brother suggesting it. Good job, bro!! The menu looks enticing because of the prices. Don't let the affordable prices scare you away. The menu is by far the best. Even my mom who's a picky eater wants to come back here the next time we visit S.F. That's definitely a lot coming from my mom who rarely will eat at a American Restaurant. She even loved the Boston Clam Chowder. Heck, I enjoyed it!!! My brother and father loved the sweet potato pie. I wish I didn't order such a big meal, otherwise I would've ordered the sweet potato pie. However, I did order the tiramisu. That was phenomenal. not too sweet and not too heavy. It was just right. It's better than I have had in a long time. My mom's Ahi was cooked to perfection. She couldn't finish all of it and shared it with my brother and I. Even after a taste, my mouth was salivating for more. My brother and I had ordered the rib-eye which was great, the juices kept on pouring out of the steak. My dad enjoyed his ribs. Next time, I am going to order the seafood gumbo and sweet potato pie. Now, the coffee was also good. I did have to use cream, but no sugar needed at all. That's a compliment already for coffee. The coffee I had drank was their signature delancey street coffee. Wow!! Can you sell me some coffee beans next time, so I can enjoy it at home??? I must try the lunch here too.", "author": "Arthur W."}

Just goes to show you how people who appreciate their jobs can make a difference in my life, too. Sorry for the social message.\n\nFor a hearty and affordable breakfast, few places can compete with Delancey Street as far as service and locale. Even though you can never tell, the wait staff consists of residents of the halfway house managed by the wonderful Delancey Street Foundation, same as Crossroads Cafe down the block.\n\nI take that back...you can tell because here is a group of people grateful for a second chance in life, and there is just something in the way they come with a cold pitcher right as your water glass is half-empty or armed with another basket of toasted bagel slices right after the first one has been devoured. They aren't hovering like seagulls...they just know how to serve in the old-fashioned way. The locale is the second draw because it's located out in the sunnier South Beach area where parking is far more manageable, at least on non-game days. The new T-Line comes right in front of the place, so it's an easy destination for anyone in the city.\n\nEven though the dinners are perfectly fine here, it's the breakfast menu on Sundays that's a bargain. I had the delish $5.95 Greg's omelet with plenty of home fries - it was filled with melted cream cheese mixed with chives and sliced sauteed mushrooms. My dining companion had the $6.95 New Mexican omelet filled melted pepper jack cheese, green onions and tomatoes and topped with mounds of guacamole, fresh salsa and sour cream. We were both stuffed and never rushed even though the place was crowding quickly.\n\nThe best place to sit is definitely the patio on a sunny day. The main dining room reeks of the 1970's with wood paneled columns and brass trimmings, but it's part of the charm...that and the curdled aroma of Menthalatum coming from the long tables of seniors who know a good deal when they find one. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...good, hearty breakfasts at great prices\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...patio is really great on a sunny day; the main room is decent even without your polyester shirt\nSERVICE - 5 stars...the most attentive wait staff in town\nTOTAL - 4 stars...a great place for breakfast...and sometimes dinner", "author": "Ed U."}

There were so many waiters I couldn't believe my eyes, but instead of attending to tables they were mostly huddled in the north-east corner of the restaurant ignoring the tables.  The few waiters we had for our large group were mostly newbies who couldn't answer basic questions like \"what beers are available from the bar?\".  Although we had a set menu, these few guys struggled to keep up while something like 15 waters were just chitchatting in the corner.  The only special requests we had were to refill our waters and bring more stale bread.\n\nThe food was really tasteless.  I guess if you don't like salt in anything, this is the place to go, because there was no flavor in any of it.  We NEVER add salt to anything, but on this day it was \"please pass the salt\".  We had the \"Linguini with Smoked Chicken and Shitake Mushrooms served with a white sauce\".\n\nEven though you can see the chickens roasting in one of those big machines as you walk in, I could swear they put the whole chicken in a big pot and boiled it in plain water.  Very tender, but no flavor, no smoky taste, no taste at all.  The roasted chickens you can get at any supermarket are far better tasting.\n\nThe portion of pasta was far too much, enough for two or three people.  The sauce and mushrooms were completely unimpressive.\n\nThe appetizers were worse:  Corn Chips and Salsa, Onion Rings, and Bruschetta.  The onion rings were limp, soaked in oil, and simply terrible.  The other items were just completely bland.\n\nI thought the potato soup was OK, but my wife didn't like it saying that it tasted like they added a sack of flour to thicken it up.\n\nFor dessert we had the Vanilla Bean Ice Cream and Biscotti.  Don't know if they made the ice cream, but I thought it was good.  However, the biscotti had the taste and texture of sheetrock.\n\nI suspect that the manager was absent that day because it is impossible to imagine a boss paying for a bunch of waiters to stand around ignoring tables.  But who do we blame for the terribly bland food?  \n\nI guess if you like hospital food, this is the place.  \"I'll have the dietetic linguini special!\"", "author": "Yelp R."}

Although we were advised to ask our guests which entree they would like so we could let the restaurant know in advance of which types of meals were expected, each place setting had a menu that was personalized with my sister's name and informed the guests what course options were to be served at the shower. For entrees, we gave our guests 3 options: the rotisserie garlic chicken, grilled salmon with salad, and a Mediterranean vegetable platter.  By the time dessert came around, although delicious, we couldn't finish them because we were so full. \n\nThe service was great. Since the bridal shower was a surprise, we had told the hostess the cover story that we had told my sister in order to get to the restaurant.

From working with their special events coordinator to receiving excellent service and food, everything about being one of their customers was AMAZING!!! \n\nOn top of all that, this place is one of the greatest social work movements and innovative Community Benefit Organizations (or \"nonprofit\") around--utilizing an entrepreneurial approach to sustain funding and support rehabilitation and independence--All of their workers are folks who are in their final stages in a rehabilitation program, using this restaurant (and I believe the bakery nearby) as a tool to provide job training and to help their consumers get \"back on their feet\" while leaving the program with some real work experience and skills to set them up for success! \n\nGreat business, great mission, and overall I would highly recommend for any meal or event!!!!!

Drinks get ordered after another 5 minute wait.  \n\nSpilled a drink because of a wobbly table, it ends up all over me and the chair.  No waiter responded with napkins or help.  No big deal, we got it cleaned up before food came out..... with our own napkins.  No offer of backup napkins or replacement beer or even inquiry as to why all of our napkins are sitting on the table soaked in beer.  Food gets literally dropped on the table and without any questions server takes off again.\n\nWater guy came around, made eye contact and head nod to me and my table, filled the other 2 tables drinks, gave us another nod and disappeared inside.  All while 4 empty waters were sitting at the edge of our table.\n\nFood was ok for the price and cooked as well as a frozen salmon filet can be.  Eventually gave up on the servers and had to get up, walk inside and ask for some spare napkins from another server, who was immediately confrontational about why i didn't already have a napkin.  \n\nAt this point i gave up on asking for the water refills or another beer.

I dialed up the yelp app and this place came up as the closest and best rated place that looked like it was reasonably priced. At least two thirds of the time I use yelp to find a place I find the ratings to be a little over blown but this time they were low if anything.\n\nThere is plenty of numbered street parking. Once you park you go pay some central machine for how long you think you'll be there. I had a little trouble figuring it out at first but once you do its only 25 cents for every 15 minutes, a bargain in The City.\n\nThis place is the opposite of every snotty, trendy, hipper than thou brunch place we've all become used to. The waiters look and act like waiters without any visible tattoos or piercings.\n\nMy friend wanted to sit on the patio, which I don't usually like. I can live without the sun, dust, and car exhaust dining experience. The deck at Delancy was perfect. Trees and umbrellas shade the entire patio. They have a Plexiglas barrier completely surrounding the patio to keep street noise and debris from disturbing you. They even have heat lamps to keep the chill out of your bones.\n\nOnce I saw the eggs Benedict on the menu I had to have it, I can't resist a good Benedict, and these were perfect. I'm not talking about someone putting their own spin on the dish or some trendy pseudo Benedict, I'm talking about a classic Eggs Benedict perfectly executed. The yolks were runny, the white was solid, the sauce was creamy and lemony, the bacon was Smokey without being too salty, and the muffin did it's job of holding the whole thing together. Now for the best part, the price for this amazing brunch was $6.95.\n\nAfter what I went through at Paul K and Red Door Cafe recently it was great to have a nice pleasant meal without gimmicks, attitude, or any shenanigans at all.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/red-door-cafe-san-francisco-3#hrid:bqxy5-W9z0n0ft29xsLnrA/src:self\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/paul-k-san-francisco#hrid:1qZ81u88ZCSr6S4EoCT3XA/src:self", "author": "Manny F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-07-25", "description": "I've eaten at Delancey Street Restaurant maybe a dozen times over the years, but after my last meal there tonight I will never eat there again. I'm writing this review in the middle of the night (almost 1 a.m.), because, even though I always fall asleep in five minutes, they served me regular coffee after I had asked for decaf. I get only five hours of sleep a night, so losing this precious time is a big deal to me.\n\nI had made and confirmed a reservation for three by phone, since they have no online reservation service. When we arrived relatively early (6 p.m.) the restaurant was half full, but the maitre d' could not find a table for us, even though I said we had a reservation. A waiter came over, asked if we were a party of three, looked around and walked away. I asked one of my companions, \"Do you think we're supposed to follow him?\" We started following him, but he turned around and came back toward us, so we backtracked until he finally indicated that we SHOULD follow him. He seated us at the worst table in the restaurant, right next to the kitchen, but my companions didn't mind, so there we sat.\n\nWe waited about ten minutes before another obviously unhappy waiter came over and, instead of asking if we wanted anything to drink, asked for our order, which he wrote down assiduously. Despite this, I asked for a glass of wine. About 20 minutes later I asked the hard-to-find waiter about the wine. He said it was coming right up. A few minutes later he came back and asked what kinds of wine two of us ordered, even though I was the only one who ordered any. Another ten minutes passed before the glass of wine finally arrived.\n\nThen ANOTHER 20 minutes passed before the appetizers arrived. Two of us had ordered their heirloom tomato salad. It was a small cup of maybe a third of a tomato chopped up with onions and a tasty broth. I've always seen heirloom tomato salad sliced on a plate, so this presentation was disappointing. The other appetizer that my companion ordered was two small pieces of spanikopita. After we finished the skimpy appetizers the empty plates lay on our table about 15 minutes before the entrees arrived. Do you see a pattern here? Despite a half empty restaurant the service and/or kitchen is excruciatingly slow. Each course was served by a different waiter. \n\nMy vegetarian chili was a large mound of white rice sorrounded by a narrow ring of bland chili, which looked like it had been reheated. One companion liked his pot roast. The \"meatloaf\" ordered by my other companion was actually two hard, dry hockey pucks of individually baked patties, not traditionally sliced meatloaf. They ate maybe half their entrees.\n\nAfter another wait a different member of the wait staff brought the check. None of the waiters asked about dessert. Nevertheless, we asked for dessert menus and ordered them, and I asked for the soon-to-be-dreaded \"decaf\" coffee. \n\nWhile we were waiting for desserts two men, a waiter and someone who appeared to be another maitre d', came to our table, and the maitre d' asked if we would mind moving to another table, as there was a large party coming, and they needed our table!!! We were stunned. I said we were waiting for dessert and would not be moving, though we would probably be gone in another ten minutes. The maitre d' said OK, and both men left.\n\nThe tiramisu, though probably not made on the premises, was good. My companions ordered the creme brulee. One said it was runny, though the other said it was OK. The coffee was lukewarm.\n\nMy take-away from this horrible experience is that even though the prices are reasonable, and even though I appreciate the benefit of helping former addicts readjust to mainstream society and employment, you get less than you pay for at Delancey Street Restaurant -- much less. The valet parking is a good deal, only $4. But you don't want to go there now, do you?", "author": "Bill H."}

This is how I feel about Delancey Street, since it came highly recommended by some yelpers  whose opinion I respect.  \n\nIn all honesty, I really badly wanted to love this place...and I did until I took my first bite.  Everything was set up for a great lunch:  beautiful day, awesome view, friendly service, nice atrium, clean and spacious restaurant...\n\nThe food, however, was just okay.  I couldn't bear the disappointment since I really wanted to be wowed by it.  It's like watching a gymnast get the first few moves right , but failing to stick the landing.\n\nOn the plus side, $10 for a full slab of ribs and a side of pumpkin pie is indeed unbeatable value.  Good sized sandwiches for $6-$7 are also very good.  They give very generous portions, even the half order of fries and rings ($2.50 each) are quite substantial.  \n\nI was, however, underwhelmed by my ribs.  It didn't arrive warm, it had way too much sauce (and they even give you a side of bbq sauce, of a different kind than what was slapped on the ribs) and the sauce itself was not that great.  The meat was also very tough.  The rings were good, but some of them were stuck and clumped together.  The fries were a little bland.  I had a few bites of my buddy's eggplant sandwich.  That was pretty good, but still lacking more of a punch.  I'm also not a fan of no soda refills.  In the end, I wasn't very satisfied...just full.\n\nPerhaps it's mean to call this place an upscale version of Denny's.  For one thing it's inaccurate.  Yet I'm not totally surprised that the comparison is drawn.  If you put me in a blind taste test, I wouldn't be surprised if I get a little confused.\n\nI can't give a thorough evaluation without talking about the service and what this place is all about.  Good people doing good things, taking the time to pick themselves up rather than making excuses.  The service really was great.  \n\nOverall, however, three stars is a fair assessment.

I am delighted to say that my luncheon experience today, my first since they have reopened, was in all ways a positive experience. Although we had no reservation, we were greeted in the usual friendly and gracious way that I have come to expect when I enter their doors. We were seated at a delightful table and almost immediately given a basket of sliced bagel and butter. Both my companion and myself are coffee drinkers and we received fresh cups forthwith. We were allowed a sufficient time to review the menu and any questions we had regarding the food were politely and informatively responded to.\n\nMy friend ordered the cheeseburger with French fries and I had the croque monsier. Both meals were excellent and the portions were more than generous. Further, as opposed to many other restaurants at which I have recently eaten, our coffee cups were constantly refreshed. During our meal the maitre d hostess visited our table and was very gracious.\n\nAlthough the remodeling at first appears to be minimal, upon further examination, they have refreshed the entire space and maintained the elegant ambiance. I will be having relatives visiting next week and look forward to bringing them to this wonderful restaurant. I am truly delighted to have the Delancey Street Restaurant once more available to me.", "author": "Frank T."}

I went here for lunch today (after a tour of the Delancey St Foundation) and it knocked my socks off.  The menu is solid, the waitstaff is SUPER professional, and the service was amazing.  You would never know what some of the waiters or maitre' d's have come out of prison or are looking at their third strike.  You see hints of it, the top of a tattoo covered here, a rolled up sleeve with some scars there, but everyone was professional as can be.  The atmosphere is light and airy, and it seems like a great place for big groups.  \n\nI had the privilege to see the kitchen and it is spotless and just as professional as the front of the house.  As for the food, lunch for two with dessert with a view of the bay was about $20!  I couldn't believe it when I saw the bill.  I got the steak sandwich, with the spicy fries.  The portions were big and hearty.  Maybe not the best steak sandwich I've ever had, but pretty damn good.  \n\nThe sweet potato pie, on the other hand, was amazing.  First the portion is ridiculous.  It looked like it was almost a quarter of the pie.  The crust was flakey, but still firm and the sweet potato filling had a great creaminess to it, but still maintaining that sweet potato flavor.     \n\nI would definitely go here again, and I would recommend it as well, especially if you're nonprofit/community minded like I am, because EVERY SINGLE PERSON working here lives at Delancey St, and going to the restaurant is a great way to help them help them maintain their recovery.", "author": "Adam E."}

I've been three times (twice for dinner and once for brunch) and have always left very happy with my dining experience. Tonight I was with 7 friends and Delancey Street did not disappoint. The food is delicious with a good variety to please most anyone and you can't beat the price. It's very reasonable for a nice sit-down meal (with cloth napkins and table cloth). How many places give you all that for $10 to $18 dishes? Oh, and don't forget about the location! It's right on the Embarcadero with large windows facing the Bay.

I ordered the vegetarian special (Moroccan stew). You'd think that it would have some sort of flavor, but even adding salt didn't enhance anything. The both of us felt the same way about it - and his palate is a lot less discerning than mine. We called attention to it with our waiter, and he was very apologetic.

Not the best food I've ever had, but we both cleaned our plates, so it was definitely edible :) We made reservations for 6:30 on a Wednesday, and when we came in I saw reservations were completely unnecessary, there were few people there at that time. I had the salmon from their \"heart healthy\" section (love that they had that! and a healthier section on their dessert menu as well!) and my fiance got the rib eye steak. It kind of seemed like diner food in a fancier setting. Our server was really nice, but he didn't quite have the rhythm of serving down - both for our main course and for dessert he checked on us a couple times right away (not giving us much time) and then when we said we needed another minute, we ended up having to flag him down 10 or 15 minutes later.\nFor dessert I got the hot buttered rum banana split (which should really be for two people but the fiance is lactose intolerant so I was all on my own) which was simple but good, and he ordered the \"pears\" poached in wine and spices. It was actually half of one pear, which I thought was kind of disappointing. I mean, really? Half of one pear? Come on. \nThe prices are great for a nice restaurant though, and I really like the mission of the place. It's got a great location too - we walked down the Embarcadero afterwards to catch Bart on Market St and it was all very romantic. \nI'm interested in going back for brunch or something, according to all these other reviews that's very good.", "author": "Erin A."}

First, there wasn't that much scallop on it and that was the only ceviche part (no other fish). It was on a top a bed of lettuce, tasted kind of, well, lacking. Aside from that all the other orders were what I was hoping for. The roasted garlic tasted super delish, well if you like garlic that is. We also got the drunken shrimp, which came out to be really flavorful and well balanced. Oh yes, and the oysters, yum, just yum!

At first glance, it looks quite fancy like a 5-star restaurant.  My wallet was prepared to take a beating.  However, don't be fooled - this place is a cheap eat!  My friend chose this place to eat because the restaurant supports a great cause, Delancey Street Foundation, an organization that helps people rebuild their lives.  Definitely makes me feel better about stuffing my face. \n\nThe restaurant was well decorated with fancy table settings and appealing wallpaper.  As I looked around, I noticed many large groups of people celebrating their birthdays.  While waiting for the rest of my group, I overheard 2 groups singing \"Happy Birthday,\" and on the way to the restroom, I saw 2 private parties celebrating birthdays too.  This place is very accommodating for large groups.  I came to celebrate my friends' birthdays, and the restaurant printed \"HAPPY BIRTHDAY BONNIE & TRUC!\" on their specials menu.  An aww moment... \n\nSERVICE - 5 stars.  Fantastic service!  We even had a cake, and they didn't charge as a cake-fee.  They gave the birthday girls complimentary mimosas.\n\nFOOD:  Very interesting...  Big servings for cheap price, but the quality did not match the elegance of the restaurant.  Here are some of dishes that I tasted:\n\n1. ALEJANDRINOS - 3 stars.  Recommended by our server as his favorite appetizer.  Basically a jalapeno popper wrapped with wonton skin, with a side of thousand island dipping sauce.  Crunchy, but not enough heat to it.\n\n2. CRAB CAKES - 2 stars.  5 small crab cakes with some crunchy green beans.  The cakes were too dry and tasted like imitation crab.  My friend and I dipped the cakes in the thousand island dipping sauce that came with our Alejandrinos, which gave the cakes some much-needed flavor.  Not impressed.  I've had better.\n\n3. SLOW BRAISED LAMB SHANKS - 4 stars.  Came with a HUGE rack of lamb with mashed potatoes and veggies.  Enough food to share with a friend.  We decided only 1 word to describe the lamb = GAMEY.  That's how it tasted.  Personally I like that taste, but my friend didn't.  \n\n4. SOUP OF THE DAY: CARROT SOUP - 2 stars.  Tasted like someone took carrots and mixed it in a blender.  Not a fan...\n\n5. SWEET POTATO PIE - 3 stars.  Comes in a giant slice!  My friend LOVED it, but the majority of our table didn't care too much for it.  To me, it tasted like a wannabe-pumpkin-pie.\n\n6. CRISPY POTATO CAKES - 3 stars.  $6 for only 2 thin potato cakes with some cream cheese spread and salmon.  The potato was crispy, but I was expecting a thicker cake.\n\n7. RIBEYE STEAK - 4 stars.  HUGE slab of steak with mashed potatos and corn on the cob.  The piece I tried was tender and juicy.\n\nOVERALL - 4 stars!  I would definitely recommend this place for birthday dinners as they are very accommodating of large groups.", "author": "Ray Y."}

Delancey Street Restaurant is literally a 3 min walk from my new building YES and such a hidden gem. My current boyfriend of 6 months actually accidently took me here on our first date (his first choice wasn't open that day and we needed something close to AT&T Park and our works). We have since been back many many times for both brunch and late lunches\n\nThe service first and foremost is phenomenal. The (all male?) wait staff is super attentive and eager to please. I initially didn't know anything about the rehabilitation programs and the Delancey Street Foundation, but after finding out, became an even bigger fan. The tables inside are all decorated with white cloth covers and silverware down to the bread basket (with unique flat bagel crisps and muffins!) are arranged to the T. It actually feels a bit fancy until you look at the menu prices. \n\nHow can it be SO cheap?! My guess is that it's somewhat subsidized by the government to support the Foundation, which is just fantastic all around. No brunches go over $15 (some huge dishes are around $7) and they even have beer and other brunch beverages (mimosas, bloody marys, etc). I've had the chorizo and eggs plate, chicken and ribs, soup and salads, corn beef hash and eggs plate, etc. All were pretty tasty but not necessarily 5-star worthy. STILL, for the prices, service and atmosphere, it was fulfilling and enjoyable enough to return about 4 times in the past two months that I've been living down the street.

However, they do a terrific job and seem friendly and motivated.  More than I can say for many of the faux-French places in town.  Actually, they kind of remind me of that scene in The Thin Man, where Nick & Nora assemble the usual suspects for a dinner party.  See the movie - if you haven't, you really need to get up to speed. \n\nI did not have to wait as a walk-in during prime feeding hour on a Saturday night.

If you don't know what this restaurant's about, check out their site - their philosophy and mission alone deserves 5 stars!\n\nWent here for Mother's day (I know!  Long overdue review!) and had a very pleasant server.  The appetizers were great (inhaled the fried artichoke hearts!), the soup was meh, the two main dishes I tried were alright, and dessert was wonderful (how could it not be, though?).  \n\nI originally ordered the scallops only to be told 15 minutes after I ordered they were all out.  I was in a great mood with great company though, and have been a server in a situation like this, praying that the guest didn't throw a fit and want to cut my head off!  I know situations like this happen, so I let it go and ordered the Chipotle Glazed Pork Steak with corn/black bean relish and a potato latke.  The thing about this dish, as well as other meat/fish dishes I eyed is the thinness to the meat cuts.  I'm a huge thick, juicy, tender piece kinda gal, ya dig?  The cuts were as thin as my knife, which is unappealing for a carnivore like myself.  Flavor-wise, it also lacked a tiny bit of something.\n\nI went with a family who frequents Delancey's often in support.  They did say that once someone does train to be a cook and become amazing, they do eventually move on from recovering, to get hired elsewhere.  So, mayhaps it may always be a hit or a miss type situation depending on how far in experience the current cooks are.  Anyway, I'm all for going back every so often in support of such a fabulous foundation!\n\nEnd note:  That sweet potato pie is INTENSE!  Huge and awesome.", "author": "Nadia D."}

It would be easy, except you can't give more than 5 stars in a review, and this place earns that even without any \"it's all for a good cause\" bonus.\n\nI stopped in for Sunday Brunch, around 12:30pm. On my walk from the middle of SOMA, I passed a few other breakfast/brunch places. Those had views of concrete and asphalt. And they had lines outside. Delancey has neither.\n\nA picturesque location on the Embarcadero. Beautiful views of the Bay Bridge, the water, the sailboats. No line outside. Not even a wait for a table.\n\nZagat says this is the friendliest restaurant in SF? I can believe it. Genuinely friendly and smiling people here. No \"fake smile that disappears the moment the customer turns his head because I hate my life\". Nope. Genuine smiles. Genuine people. \n\nI was pretty hungry. Actually I was really hungry. So in addition to my Mimosa (which was a whopping $3.75 and was made with orange juice so fresh you hear the rustle of the leaves in the orange grove), I ordered both the Belgian Waffle and a Mama's omelette. Don't do the same, unless maybe you are a starting lineman for the Stanford Cardinal. It was a lot of food.\n\nBelgian waffle was just about perfect. Light in texture. Great flavor. Fresh strawberries and cream (and maple syrup on the side which was completely unnecessary). The omelette was outstanding. Fluffy eggs. Fresh avocado. Real bacon. Homestyle potatoes that were good enough to stand alone (rather than the typical afterthought they become at most places).\n\nAttentive service. Pre-bussed my waffle plate soon after I finished it. Refilled my water exactly when I wanted more. Asked me politely if I wanted another mimosa rather than pushing it. Service was just right.\n\nAnd what did I pay for this meal? For what amounts to two entire entrees, plus a mimosa, all served impeccably in a picturesque setting by the water, with no wait in line to get a table? $18.07. That's not a typo. I had to check it myself because frankly it felt criminal. That's a price I would have expected fifteen years ago in a diner in Nebraska, not 2011 in South Beach, SF.\n\nSo yeah, I tipped $7.

We got there at 9:50 and stood outside waiting for the 10AM opening. We were the very first group seated. They quickly sat us outside at our request, it was a beautiful day and we wanted to take advantage, right away we were served water and a basket of bagel chips and bread. We weren't the only ones in the patio, parties of all sizes followed. After about 10 minutes I realized that every table around us had cafe, mimosas or some other drink besides water....yet our waiter hadn't even came out to greet us. Another 5 minutes go by and I finally wave down who I assume is the manager. I told her we had been sitting down for nearly 15 minutes and had yet to place a drink order. She quickly said; \"it's a busy day and I've sat too many people out here, you're waiter is busy and will be with you shortly....\" I can't say say what it was but that didn't sit well with me. A few minutes later the waiter comes to the table, it was obvious he was already....annoyed (for lack of a better word) perhaps it was just us?!? I tried to be as cordial as possible but it was obvious he wanted to rush. As we asked questions about the menu is became more and more obvious we weren't his cup of tea. \n\nFor the sake of time I'll get to the food. EVERYTHING we ordered was cold. I don't even think it was kept under a heating lamp. We didn't want to complain because honestly I had a feeling it wouldn't end well and I didn't want to ruin our Sunday morning. It had been about 15 minutes after we had finally gotten our food and the waiter comes back ready to collect our plates. The whole thing was awkward.

Once seated on the sidewalk patio, we were given bread and butter and also offered olive oil.  Always a great way to start when  starving. \nUnfortunately, my seat was directly facing the bread prep area. Although I had great company my eyes were continually looking through the door. The bread was kept in a large plastic bag. Each time a new customer came, bread was grabbed by hand and butter was sliced using full hand to place each butter piece on plate. This was after he snacked on a few pieces and was chipping off crud from clean silverware.\nIt took about 15 minutes for our drink order to be taken. By that time we were ready for our full order to be taken. Only drinks off of the drink menu can be ordered. We ordered fried potstickers as an appetizer and also received an order of calamari because it was placed on our table by accident.\n As a main course we both ordered pasta dishes. My dish arrived about five minutes after the appetizer and my date's arrived about 15 minutes later. Our waiter had to ask what was ordered and did not seem so apologetic.\nI was going to Yelp while at the table,but unfortunately my phone died. Honestly, I am glad I was not able to because it gave me a chance to review the restaurant website. I had no idea about the background of Delancey. I think the concept is a wonderful idea with a major flaw. If it is a training facility the employees should be properly trained. A few ideas that would make a major difference:\n1. Memorize table numbers. This was a noticeable problem as food was being delivered to wrong tables constantly.\n2. A valet is great, but diners do not really want to see or hear them smacking gum while eating. I really do not know of any job that would want you chewing gum.\n3. Make sure waiters take note of their diners. Empty glasses, food timing/arrival and stacked dishes on tables.\n4. Food handling.", "author": "L R."}

If you're looking for success stories, this is definitely a place you need to check out. Delancey Street Restaurant business model is truly one of a kind in the City and it shows.\n\nSituated by the waterfront, you have great views of the Bay on the eastern side of the restaurant. The decor and design is contemporary, perfect for the ambiance.\n\nWe we're warmly greeted as we walked in with our small army. We had no reservations so we thought there maybe a good wait time. But to our surprise, there was a table available even though the place looked fairly busy on a Friday night.\n\nMy stomach started to grumble. I started off with a glass of Kendall Jackson Pinot Noir and a half a dozen raw Pearl Oysters on a half shell from Oregon, which was suggested by our server.\n\nThe Pinot put my stomach on neutral as I indulged in the oysters. It was fresh, topped it with horse radish, lime and Tabasco sauce. Yummy with a nose running kick! \n\nFor appetizers we had their onion rings the bomb! Shoe string cut Maui onions seasoned and fried to perfection.\n\nI decided to go with the Roasted Lamb Shank and Cajun Rice (instead of Garlic Mashed Potatoes) for the main course. The rice was good and the lamb was nice, juicy and fall off the bone tender.\n\nThe service here was an \"A\" plus all around from the time we walked  in. Will definitely come back to this place to sample the rest.", "author": "Gary E."}

Our answer was Delancey's!\n\nWe made a reservation day of and they were gracious enough to take us in. When we first entered the restaurant, the decor was elegant but not in an intimidating way. We had an intimate table near the window which was nice as we had a beautiful view of the Embarcadero.\n\nThe service was not the most incredible, but due to the restaurant's unique nature, it was completely understandable. Our server, while friendly, was not the most attentive of servers but there was a team spirit throughout the servers and bussers.\n\nThe real focus was the FOOD! The prices were described to us as \"five star quality food at fast food prices\" which was the perfect way to describe it!\n\nThe highlight of my meal was the whole thing! The lightly fried artichokes with spicy aioli was the perfect way to start the meal, fried but not too heavy. The salmon was cooked perfectly and so flavourful and the maki rolls were a great side. It should also be noted that I was also jealous of my boyfriend's delicious crab cakes with a mango topping. Finally, my dessert, the Heavenly Guiltless Chocolate Decadence Torte was just that! I couldn't believe it was under 200 calories, it was rich and unbelievably tasty!\n\nI really want to stress the ridiculously low price for everything! After ordering an appetiser, 2 entrees, a side, and 2 desserts for dinner, our bill came out to less than $50. It was an extremely memorable, special dinner that didn't leave us with empty wallets :)", "author": "Chloe L."}

First of all, I love their story and the concept of the foundation. You're supporting something good while eating delicious brunch with some serious mimosas (YUM). We had the benedict and the scramble, both were delight. I must say that I have never had such perfectly poached eggs. All 4 of ours (2 each) were oozy but cooked and so perfect with the meal. Bravo. I love the bagel chips they bring out in the beginning too and the outdoor seating is so lovely. Service was great. The only thing reason I'm thinking 4.8 instead of 5, is because I love my potatoes extra crispy and I specifically asked (twice) for that and they said \"ok\". I think that the potatoes are made in batches, so it didn't occur to make one order differently (the standard potato side is just mushy and eh, mediocre) .Great overall experience and we'll definitely come back!

I always get worried that sometimes lox might make things a little too salty but this was perfect and yummy! I hadn't had scrambled eggs at a restaurant in a long time and I was glad I made this place the one to break me out of my Eggs Benedict routine. I don't regret it at all because it was so delicious! The bagel was well toasted and the texture was good, the onion sprinkled on the top was a little burnt so I scraped off the sprinkles. The potatoes looked really dark and I was scared they were burnt but they were PERFECT! So delicious! I loved the potatoes, but keep in mind I also prefer my breakfast potatoes not crispy. \n\nTheir coffee was pretty good as well! YUM! Plus, after you order, you get delish bagel chips and bread. Definitely a fan! \n\nI also love how their portions are decently sized, I ended up bringing most of my scramble home because I was so full from eating the bagel and the potatoes. \n\nMy one gripe with them is that they don't have any bags to go with their takeout boxes, so my salmon and eggs got all over my purse and I now have a fishy smelling purse :( uber sadface. \n\nIt offers a great and affordable breakfast option in the SOMA area with a view of the water and a nice place to help ex-cons get back on their feet!", "author": "Constance C."}

I had the heirloom tomato salad and the tomatoes were flavorless and seemed immature, but I dearly love tomatoes so I ate all of it.  I also split the potatoes cakes with my mother-in-law and they were greasy, which could be over-looked if they were flavorful - but they were not.  For my entree I ended up getting the blackened meatloaf.  It was really tasty and flavorful and probably the best meal on the table, as my in-laws were not particularly gushing about the rack of lamb or salmon that they ordered.\n\nStill, the portions are large and you get a good back for your buck here.

However, I asked to have the garlic & chive schmear on the side and I was charged $0.50 extra on the bill for \"1 egg white\" since they supposedly pre-make the eggwhites with the schmear in it and had to make my order differently. I wouldn't have minded the extra charge but it just would have been nice for them to inform me instead of just adding the extra charge onto the bill.  \n-STRAWBERRY AND BANANA SMOOTHIE - $3.50\n          -A fresh and tasty treat!\n\nOverall, the food + location + price = great experience!  Best of all, they offer \"Heart Healthy\" items on the menu that are under 500 calories and low-fat.  I will definitely come back for Sunday brunch and also to try their lunch or dinner menus.", "author": "Angela F."}

I feel like this is a restaurant that doesn't seem to have direction. There's the lamb shank which is delicious bu then there's the maki rolls that come with some meals which were not good at all.\n\nI feel like this restaurant needs to focus on the things they're good at and try not to spread themselves too thin. They try to do too much which ends up making some of their excellent dished lose their luster. \n\nThe great thing about this place though is their service and that they have a huge dining room so there's rarely ever a wait for a table (which I guess is a good thing and a bad thing). The restrooms are very clean.\n\nAnyway, their prices are excellent and they have smaller dining rooms that I assume you can rent out for parties.", "author": "Rylan C."}

Count me in.\n\nI give my dad a lot of shit for being obnoxious and frustrating beyond belief sometimes, but he's probably one of the best people I know. And us coming here for lunch sometimes twice a week is mainly his doing. If you don't know about Delancey Street, the people working here do so for free and all the money goes into supporting their life reformation. I usually don't like going to the same place over and over, but it didn't hurt that I have a major crush on one of the servers. Shh, don't tell my pops. No I wasn't salivating because I was that hungry.\n\nThe food is dirt cheap, and no, it doesn't taste like dirt. It tastes pretty damn good. We've had just about everything on the menu by now so I recommend the crab cakes, portobello mushroom burger, salmon, a glass of wine, and definitely the WARM VALRHONA CHOCOLATE PUDDING CAKE. I copy-pasted that off the online menu for your viewing pleasure. And so you have it verbatim and don't mess it up. My dad is more of a meat eater so he'd recommend any of those juicy, tasty meat sandwiches and the chicken. The entrees usually come with a healthy dose of salad or some kind of vegetable, one of the only times my dad actually finishes his greens.\n\nThe service is the best.

My gosh.  I figured with the cast they get here, maybe someone new came who knew how to make sushi, so I tried it.  Oh gosh, it was like someone slapped some Unce Ben's in between a piece of seaweed and called it sushi.  The rice was undercooked, not seasoned at all, the ginger wasn't even ginger, the wasabi was very obviously powder mix, which is frequent, but come on!  at least make it try to seem legit.  All in all, I choked down maybe 5 of the 7-8 pieces I had, but couldn't bring myself to eat the rest.  I hate seeming snobby in any way, but I've had good sushi, and decent sushi, and this was neither.  \n\nIf you own or operate this restaurant and you see this, take the sushi OFF the menu!  \n\nThe staff is amazing.

My boyfriend ordered a burger with fries and a bowl of chowder as well. \n\nThe clam chowder was yummy, the burger was good, fries were OK. I was very disappointed in the ribs. The presentation was lovely, the rack of 7 ribs were nicely plated and had ample amounts of barbecue sauce on them.

Upon arrival the doormen graciously opened the doors for us. We waited for a few minutes as the man at the host desk seemed to be preoccupied with a phone call. As we were being seated I politely asked for my friend and I to be seated at the booth near the window. The man who seated us (the host who was once preoccupied on the phone) politely said that table was reserved.\n\nOur waiter was great- he was friendly, helpful and efficient. He had coffee and I had hot chocolate. I had the french toast which was delicious and a side of bacon. He had steak, eggs, home fries and strawberry pancakes. I was too stuffed for dessert. Prices were reasonable. Menu looked dated. Decor was standard. Since it was the holiday season there was a large Christmas Tree in the middle of the dining room, each table had a holiday decoration with miniature ornaments inside.\n\nWe were completed with our leisurely meal I noticed three teenagers strolling in for the 'reserved table.' Its my belief the host was lying about that table being reserved, because the person seating the three teenagers pointed to several places with the booth being one of the seating options. Don't get me wrong- I don't mind if the host said we only give booths to parties of 3 or more, but I'm pretty sure he was just not being honest.\n\nSince, I'm allergic to so many things I've devised a new system to make it easy on my family and friends. The new system is I'll pick a two restaurants that are allergy friendly and write them on a note card. With the note cards folded in half- people will pick which place.\n\nNoelle- Pick your fate!\n\nWalt- What?\n\nNoelle- Pick your fate!\n\nWalt- Ok. Pork Store? Pork Store Cafe?\n\nNoelle- Okay, that is where we will eat before watching the Phantom of the Opera.\n\nWalt- Um. No. No, Noelle. Hells No. My  Ford Model-T will be stolen at either location. Next time you want to eat there let me know and I'll bring the SUV.\n\nNoelle- Okay. I'm just saying you picked your fate =) I mean restaurant.\n\nSo the moral of the story is I picked a favorite place of mine to eat at- Pork Store Cafe and some random restaurant in the SOMA being Delancey Street Restaurant. Food was decent. Host person needs to brush up on his manners. Wait staff was excellent. Not going to be back anytime soon. I do like the name of the restaurant because it reminds me of the song \"Manhattan\" by Tony Bennett originally sung by \"The Garrick Gaieties\" (1925). \n\nNoelle's Notes\nDelancey Street Foundation (you learn something new each day)- http://www.delanceystreetfoundation.org/enterrestaurant.php", "author": "Noelle J."}

You expect the service to be top notch by looking at the bow-ties worn by the waiters.. Not so... And food was extremely bland! I had the daily grilled fish which was swordfish. Was over cooked and without seasoning. I never add salt to my food, but I had to here. The bf had the fettuccine.  It us hard to mess-up this dish, but they did. Tasted like they literally opened a jar of sauce and poured on top. Even my 5 y.o didn't  like it. I ordered one of their 6 \"specialty\" cocktails, the whiskey sour. It was not only lacking any trace of alcohol but was just sour. I worked as a bartender for a few years and there was nothing balanced about that cocktail! You would think since they do not  offer a full bar, their cocktails would be amazing! Not so. We had to request water and a few other things. With so many \" fancy \" waiters standing around you really shouldn't have to do that. Will not return.", "author": "Cristyn T."}

After some quick Yelp sleuthing on my cell phone, Delancey Street Restaurant popped up as the clear winner based on Yelp reviews, distance from where I was currently located, and it was open.  \n\nNow - it looked promising, definitely has curb appeal as far as restaurants go.  Parking was metered, close, and abundant.  I was hungry and definitely looking forward to food and right here is where the story gets strange.  As we approach the door and are about to walk into the restaurant - an otherwise normal looking woman throws the doors open, storms out, looks me straight in the eye and says, \"don't eat here, my rapist likes this restaurant\", and continues to storm off down the street.\n\n. . .\n\nSo we didn't take that as a sign to seek food elsewhere and we sat down for a meal.  Service was impeccable, staff attentive, prices more than reasonable and the restaurant has a great feel to it.  Unfortunately, the food taste and quality is very sub par and you suddenly realize why the prices are so low.  The food was forgettable and I forget what I ordered - but that says it all.  You get what you pay for.  But as I waited for the check I browsed the restaurants website and apparently the restaurant does great things for recovering addicts and serves as a training ground to get them back on their feet.... which is good, I suppose.  So it gets 3 stars for that, the service, the atmosphere and the cheep beer, even though the food was not good.", "author": "Dustin S."}

They offer pseudo-American cuisine with lots of seafood accents - but not too fishy, I'll have you know.\n\nI was surprised and delighted to find that it was upscale and very moderately priced! Score!\n\nWhen you walk in, the first thing that catches your eye is the bar. Okay, maybe it was just MY eye. I didn't get a chance to see if they had a full bar, but that's an excuse to go again!\n\nI was with a group of 10 people, and the waitstaff had to think quickly to get us all at one table. I think the larger tables were already taken, so we ended up squeezing around a slightly smaller table together. It was alright.\n\nYou need to find street parking, and we got lucky, but I believe they offer valet. There are beautiful views of the bay and I wished I was there during the daylight. This would be a great date spot in the city if you're looking for one; although it's not too, TOO fancy, haha. \n\nI had the chicken caesar salad and a cup of clam chowder - my go-to meal of choice when I'm not sure what to get. Plus, I am a clam chowder fanatic! I loved the soup; it had a spicy kick. \n\nNo one had any complaints about their meal. In fact, we all enjoyed our food very much.

The Foundation is the country's largest self-help residential organization for people who have hit bottom to completely rebuild their lives.\n\nThe large dining room overlooks the beautiful San Francisco Bay Bridge and the hustle and bustle of the Embarcadero. Beautiful wood, brass, and copperwork, sophisticated lighting and tasteful furnishings create an inviting American bistro look. White table-cloths compliment the classy look and everything is clean as a whistle. The restaurant attracts a diverse base of people, dress can be casual for some or dressy for others. They seem perfectly willing to accomodate.\n\nThey serve brunch on the weekends and I've stopped in for a \"healthy\" omelette with egg whites, served with a side of potatoes and crispy bacon. For dinner I've tried multiple dishes - most memorable were the salmon and back back ribs - which were killer. My wife tried an Israeli style dish with chicken and olives which she very much enjoyed.\n\nFor desserts the apple/peach crisp served with ice cream is a must. The valhalla chocolate pudding cake is very good as well -- it takes about 15 minutes to prepare... it comes out piping hot with a scoop of coconut ice cream. It's a little bit on the rich side for me so I prefer the crisp personally -- you try both and be the judge.\n\nServers are definitely attentive, but do not rush you. They are genuine in making suggestions and always willing to be helpful. \n\nOverall, its a solid value. I suggest tipping well if its deserved -- since these folks are getting back on their feet.

I was a bit worried because most places had oily crab cakes and I ended up not finishing it. But this place grilled the crab cakes! I actually finished the darn plate. It wasn't oily and even better it was healthy! I really enjoyed the mango papaya salsa with it. GREAT dish and I highly recommend it.  We also had a bottle of wine with our meals.

As for our waiter, we sat down, was rushed to quickly view our menus before placing our orders. Since, I didn't have enough time to go over the rest of the menu, I wish I could say more. I waited patiently, looking around the restaurant with two parties enjoying their meals, a couple of customers came in after us and our same waiter, came by to take their orders. After what seemed like an eternity, I grew very impatient, wondering what happened to our food. The customers that came in after us, got all their meals whilst my SO and I were still waiting for ours!!\n\nFood-I had their lunch special fried chicken with red beans and rice along with fried potato grits while my SO had the chicken hash with toasted bread and poached eggs. I  enjoyed my crispy chicken and the potato grits while sneaking myself a couple of bites of the chicken hash, which by the way, all of it came out tasting delicious! \n\nThis is a nice restaurant that boasts a great scenery.

It was so refreshing to see genuine, earnest interest in customer satisfaction.  For example, I wanted to be a little adventurous, so I asked about the lime scallop ceviche.  And the host was kindly frank about it: \"It's not so good.\"  That could have been the end of it, but he continued, \"You know what, let me get you a taste and let you decide.\"  I was impressed with his honesty and extra effort.  So the verdict on the scallops?  Well, he was right: They looked and tasted like sour lychees.  But it was a nice experiment, and he saved me from investing a whole brunch on them.  \n\nAfter that, I chose to go a more traditional route with eggs benedict.  I also tasted the Mexican omelette and strawberry waffle.  And unlike the scallop experiment, the cooks did this traditional fare right on the money.

It's convenient and so cheap that my BF feels bad, so he over tips the server.\n\nDelancey is not just any typical restaurant for Brunch, they are actually a self-help organization for substance abusers, ex-convicts, homeless and others who have hit bottom. They are  known to hire only these type of people. I find it grateful that this organization can open doors, and give people a second chance to build their skills, and make improvements in their lives. Two thumbs up! \n\nSome of the dishes I've tried: \n\nQUESADILLA with salsa & black bean corn. I had to try this because it was Cinco De Mayo, and I wanted to show some holiday spirit.  \n\nORGANIC GREENS & PEAR with gorgonzola, wine poached pear, & roasted honey cayenne pecans.

Once I arrived, I was greated with a warm smile and welcomed as if the wet butt-prints on my pants were invisible.  How nice!\n\nSince then, I've made it a regular practice to visit Delancey Street for weekend brunch.  No joke ... the mimosas ARE served in a wine goblet, ARE made with fresh oj, and DO only cost $3.25.  What a tasty bargain!\n\nYou'll not find anything particularly exciting on the menu, but you'll be sure to find some American classics that are reasonably priced, well portioned, and prepared solidly.  I highly recommend Mama's Omelette (bacon, avocado & white cheddar  --  today, I substituted gorgonzola cheese for the standard white cheddar ... it ROCKED!!!) and the smoked fish platter.  \n\nThe service at Delancey Street is usually quite good.  Always attentive, occasionally unsuave, but quite determined.   \n\nSUGGESTIONS:  \n\nThere is valet service for only $4.   An hour at a metered spot costs just a little less...why hunt around needlessly?\n\nSan Francisco's finest cup of coffee is served here (and it's bottomless).

One of us ordered a cappuccino with non-fat milk, decaf, lots of foam...STIFF foam, I might add...with chocolate sprinkled on top and some other request that had me beating my head on the table top in amazement.

He was very proud of himself and we were pleased for him...and the kitchen.\n\nAdmittedly, we weren't very original in our menu choices, but the eggs Benedict had been recommended so we all three had it but with requests for the eggs on each to be done differently.  They got it perfectly.  The hollandaise sauce was excellent as well...smooth, just tangy enough and served hot.  The potatoes were nicely done with a bit of sweet red and green pepper and onion slivered into them.  A side of applewood smoked thick-sliced bacon was definitely worth ordering.  All the servings were very generous.  Nothing was stinted.  \n\nThe acoustics were a pleasure...though completely full, the noise level was quite bearable, and you didn't have to shout to be heard across the table.

There were plenty of waiters and it was easy to get their attention if we needed anything.\n\nWe had the Southwest Chicken Hash and the Italian Omelette.  Both cost around $7.  I'm typically not a breakfast or brunch guy, but I was satisfied with what we ordered here.  Portion sizes were definitely big enough.  All in all, it's great to find a place that leads to a great beginning of the day :)", "author": "Kenneth F."}

Service was spotty- very good for pre-dinner drinks and salad, but long wait for main course.  In addition, waiter got orders mixed up: My fish of the day was requested to be blackened; my lady friend's salmon was not.  But that was reversed.  We didn't send the orders back cause that would be too time consuming.  Overall, it was a very pleasant dining experience.", "author": "Alan W."}

This place is unique inasmuch as it's NOT a business--it's a nonprofit organization that helps give people who were formerly incarcerated the opportunity to participate in the workforce and learn useful skills.  It's a great cause, and I highly encourage people to try Delancey St restaurant out, if only to support the cause.\n\nThat being said, I was impressed by the quality of the food and the value of what we had for the price.  For a little over $25 dollars, two of us ate like kings....I had a scrumptious omelet with apple-wood smoked bacon, white cheddar and avocado, served with potatoes and toast, my husband had eggs benedict, we had 2 coffees, and 2 mimosas.  The mimosa size was quite generous, and I was stuffed after having my omelet ad potatoes.  \n\nWhile the ingredients in my omelet were by no means exotic, the meal was well executed.  The bacon was chopped up into bite-sized morsels, the avocado was at the peak of ripeness without being overly mushy, and the white cheddar blended well with the overall flavor of the place.", "author": "Nina B."}

Liked the new two price points - small and large and ordered small which was plenty for lunch (new on the menu - beets and arugula salad) and cup of soup and glass of lovely sparkling wine (simple good wine list).

I got the burger.  I kept trying to figure out what the catch was, so a quick iPhone google search led me to the website and understand the mission behind it. That made me like this place even more.\n\nI work a couple of blocks from here now and yeah, the service can fall off at some points but you gotta have the right attitude coming here and appreciate what it's there for - especially on a nice day when you're sitting on the patio.

But have no fear, Delancey Street is here! Delancey looks like a fancy-schmancy kind of restaurant, the likes of which I certainly could not afford, but it's NOT! This place is my new (brunch) mecca away from home, and here's why:\n\n1. They're CHEAP. Cheaper than Denny's (which is WAY over-priced, btw). Most brunch items are ~$6. *Fat kid inside hyperventilating*\n\n2. They're fancy. No paper napkins or placemats; here they have tablecloth and cloth napkins. The servers are dressed up and super cordial and way profesh.\n\n3. They're delicious! I got a lemon poppyseed waffle ($5.50) with a side of two eggs ($2.25) and it was better than the lemon poppyseed pancakes at Ella's. Best scrambled eggs I've ever eaten--so fluffy and perfectly cooked. AAAAAAND THE BEST MIMOSA I've ever had. \n\n4. They're friendly. I can't remember a server better than the one we had. He was attentive, had a sense of humor, and seemed like a genuinely happy person. For some reason, he made my heart smile (that may have something to do with the mimosa) and he certainly made up for the jerk at the host stand--ahem.\n\n5. They're do-gooders. The restaurant is a training school for the Delancey Street Foundation, \"the country's largest self-help residential organization for people who have hit bottom to completely rebuild their lives.\" \n\n6. They're on the Embarcadero. Gorgeous. Get off your ass and go for a walk along the water. \n\nSo basically, I'm in love with this place.

I had waited for 20 minutes and didn't hear my name called so I went back in. Apparently they had called my name, but only inside the restaurant, and never bothered to come outside to see if I was out there. They skipped to the next person and forced me to put my name back on the bottom of the list! I had to wait another 20 minutes. Then when they finally called my name, they were pretty rude.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-16", "description": "Let me be abundantly clear: this is 3 star food and a 4 star establishment.\n\nDelancey Street is part of a larger rehabilitation project for formerly incarcerated people.  They train and employ people in the restaurant industry after they get out of prison and this is an AWESOME, AWESOME thing that they do. There's another cafe in the complex that also does the same thing, and I believe some of the other businesses in the complex are part of the same non-profit, and train and employ people.\n\nBecause of this mission, the fact that the view of the water is beautiful and the prices are the cheapest you'll find anywhere in the vicinity, Delancey Street gets an additional star.  Now, on to the food.\n\nMy amazing partner took me to Mother's Day Brunch here.  The hosts were lovely and courteous, I got a gorgeous rose and they seated us at a window table immediately.  I ordered the half portion of the Eggs Benedict, potato pancakes, and a mimosa.  The orange juice in my mimosa was clearly NOT fresh, and I don't think any sit down restaurant in California has any business serving anything other than fresh-squeezed orange juice.  I was really pleased to see they offered a half order of eggs benedict, because it is such a rich dish.  And, I have to say that the hollandaise sauce on the Eggs Benedict is some of the best I've ever had: they sort of reined in the vinegar undertones you find in a classic Hollandaise and upped the creaminess, with what tasted like butter. I was happy with it and with the fact I only got a half order.\nThe potato pancakes, on the other hand, were kind of a huge disappointment.  Potato Pancakes should be crispy on the outside and a little soft on the inside.  These were just kind of....chewy, all the way through.  There were also homestyle potatoes that came with the Benedict that I tasted and then gave to my husband.  These were fine, but not great.  I really dislike it when a restaurant gives me soft homestyle potatoes, or soft french fries, or soft hashbrowns.  These were soft.  \n\nSo, Delancey street is a mixed bag when it comes to their actual food, but there are a lot of very good reasons to patronize this place and support an amazing mission.  I would just suggest that when you go, you ask the waitperson to tell you what their absolute best item on the menu is, and get only that.", "author": "Wtf D."}

Go, go, go! \n\nThis restaurant is run by the Delancey Street Foundation, \"the country's leading residential self-help organization for substance abusers, ex-convicts, homeless and others who have hit bottom\" (source: website). \n\nI called for reservations for a noon Sunday brunch. Good thing I did because there was a wait.  Ask for a window seat if you want one. We arrived at 11:30am (I'm an early bird, or extremely tardy) and sat at the bar to wait. We ordered chamomile tea which comes in a cute teapot; it's charged by the pot. I don't know if the other teas come in a pot. Initially it appeared as thought the bartender was going to give us some hot water and tea bags; when we asked for chamomile, they flagged down a server. \n\nThings I learned eavesdropping at the bar: 1) the champagne is cheap. Apparently a server relayed to one of the two bartenders that a customer drank their mimosa and sniffed \"this is cheap champagne\". My thought: the mimosas are slightly over $2, what do you expect? 2) It's not really a bar. They just pour drinks there. Another patron asked them for nuts or some bar snacks while they waited for a table. The bartender was polite and told them he didn't have anything. Then he commented to the other bartender this isn't a real bar. 3) They have good service. The bartender also told a server that the table needed something to snack on and the table got a basket of bread right away.\n\nIf you come early like me, make sure they know you're there at your reservation time. I asked for a window seat when we arrived and was told it may take longer.  At noon I checked up with the host to see how much longer the wait would be. It turned out our table was prepared but he seemed slightly surprised I was already there. So check in twice if needed; they're a busy restaurant.\n\nFood: good. Don't expect anything like Gary Danko, but it's good food, nice portions at greasy spoon prices. A got the potato pancakes and the fruit salad. The salad is slightly small (but matches its price) and was well plated. I got the chicken hash; basically chicken, peppers, potatoes mixed and fried up like a potato pancake, topped with 2 poached eggs, and a side of toast. The egghead in me noticed that the eggs were poached elementary style (i.e. the shape indicated they were likely poached in plastic wrap, and when nibbling on the egg white alone, it tasted highly acidic). I liked the hash; spicy kick, nice crispy outside, very chickeny. I also ordered the scones; it was 2 large raisins ones. \n\nPricing: all of this yummy food cost around $20.

The service was casual and very friendly and despite the formality of the dining room I felt like I was having a family meal at home. The story of the restaurant only adds to the charm. One last bit... lunch for 8 was only 150 dollars tip and tax included. I will be going back for sure. I want to become a regular and I shall.", "author": "J A."}

We had a private room, white tablecloths, attentive waiters dedicated to our party, and even a customized little menu with \"Manny's Birthday Party\" in fancy font. The Southwest Room was set up royal-banquet-style, with Dad sitting at the head all king-like (\"Off with their heads!\").  My 3-yr-old nephew crawled into the middle of this rectangular table arrangement, and sang \"Happy Birthday\" even more breathily and higher-pitched than Marilyn Monroe.  \n \nThe room required a $400 minimum.  Our party of 17 opted for a five-course meal at $28-per-person (not including wine).  \n\nMy vegetarian pasta primavera was satisfyingly huge. The meat-lovers in the crowd enjoyed their BBQ chicken and baby back ribs (I don't think I've seen my dad eat so much in a while). \n \nThe staff put candles on Dad's cake, gamely took multiple photos of the whole gang at our request, and were just nice guys all around.", "author": "angela n."}

It really echoes the American society being a melting pot of various cultures.\n\nHaving so many selections from multiple cultures can be both good and bad.  That allows everyone in your party to enjoy something they're interested in, but also doesn't allow anything to really stand out.\n\nEating at Delancey Street Restaurant can also give you that warm and fuzzy feeling inside.  You must think I'm talking about having food in your stomach, but I'm actually referring to the good cause this restaurant supports.\n\nThe Delancy Street Foundation helps former substance abusers, ex-convicts, homeless, and others who have hit bottom and gives them a second chance.  All restaurant proceeds after food costs go directly back into the organization.\n\n\nMe and my family ate here this past weekend and the restaurant was roughly half full when we arrived around 6:30PM.  We had reservations so we were quickly seated at our table.\n\nFor appetizers we shared the following:\n\nSoup of the day: Spicy African Carrot Soup\n*It was really thick and had the a similar texture to apple sauce or a puree.  It had a good spice though.\n\nCrispy Potato Cakes\n*Served with smoked salmon and chive cream cheese.\n*By far my favorite appetizer.  The smoked salmon gave great savory flavor to the more bland potato cakes.\n\nFor my main course I had the Blackened Meatloaf.  On the side it came with Garlic Mashed Potatoes and a Spicy Slaw.  The Garlic Mashed Potatoes were your typical mashed potatoes and the Spicy Slaw was pretty mediocre.  The slaw was mostly red cabbage and did not have any spice that my taste buds could pick up.  \n\nThe meatloaf was served as two circular patties.  It was not like any meatloaf I saw before.  The outsides were charred and I was afraid it was going to be dry.  To my surprise the inside was still very moist and seasoned very well with black pepper and herbs.\n\nGreat atmosphere, big portions, and food at affordable prices makes this place worth trying at least once.  Do a good deed by supporting the Delancy Street Foundation by eating here!\n\nThe view is also very nice on a clear night.  You can see the Bay Bridge from the restaurant.", "author": "Jason H."}

The Delancy Street Restaurant is the \"training school of the Delancey Street Foundation, the country's largest self-help residential organization for people who have hit bottom to completely rebuild their lives.\" The foundation also clothes and houses the ex-convicts in the very apartment building in which the restaurant resides.\n\n\"All tips are considered donations, and all restaurant proceeds after food costs go directly to house, feed and clothe our residents and teach all skills, values and attitudes needed for a successful drug-free and crime-free life in the mainstream society.\"\n\nThe scene:\n\nThe restaurant actually looks pretty upscale with the white table clothes and emply wine glasses sitting on the table. They even offer vallet parking for only $4. And if you're lucky, you could be seated next to a spectacular view overlooking the Bay Bridge.\n\nThe food:\n\nThe food here is insanely cheap. You could get a full breakfast for only $6 a plate.\n\nOrange Juice - This first caught my attention walking into the restaurant. One of the employees was squeezing fresh orange juice at the bar and it looked insanely delicous. The juice was semi-pulpy and sweet, just the way I like it.\n\nStrawberry Pancakes - At only $5.75, this dish was impressive. The pancake batter was made from a strawberry puree. I  couldn't believe how strong the strawberry flavor was in the pancakes. The pancakes had a soft chewy consistency which also indicates a good quality pancake.\n\nSouthwestern Chicken Hash - K got the Chicken Hash topped with 2 poached eggs. This hash was a healthier version of the usual hash. The spicy salsa on the side added a real kick to the dish. K never had a poached egg before and he fell in love. The oozy yellow center spilled onto the hash making it super moist and creamy with each bite.", "author": "Sam L."}

Hadn't been there before, and loved the white tablecloths, the large windows and cheery atmosphere. The menu was enticing, and the service was good. We didn't wait too long for our food, either. We sampled each other's food, and got opinions. The beef dinner was \"pretty good.\" The chicken piccata good enough. A large pasta dish with huge amount of sauce was good enough, though the sauce had an unusual and slightly sour taste. The potato pancakes with salmon and cream cheese were thin but very tasty. The salmon tasted fresh. The 'heirloom tomato\" salad was disappointing. It's caprese, really, served up differently, with the tomatoes cut into small squares, three shreds of basil. But the strange thing was that the little mozarella balls were utterly and completely without flavor of any kind at all. I mean, zilch on the flavor front. That cheese was a texture experience--like eating softened styrofoam--I didn't even know  a food could be rendered so completely without any hint of flavor at all. The tomatoes were nice enough, though not Heirloom tomatoes. All served in a small bowl. That could certainly be improved by making it a regular caprese salad, with slices of tomato and slices of actual flavor-containing mozarella, leaves of basil, and a sprinkle of oil and vinegar.\n   All-in-all, the prices are so good, and the location and atmosphere so nice, that I would definitely go back and try other things on the menu. The Pinot Regio I had was quite nice. \n   While the food is not absolutely top notch, still, to get such a varied menu, mostly good food, in a beautiful place with an elegant look, is a pretty good deal. (I ate with my relatives at a Denny's recently, and it cost most and was ghastly. The hamburgers were some strange, flattened food substitute, service was slow and incorrect even though there were only 8 people in the whole restaurant.) So getting a really nice evening at a really nice place is much appreciated.", "author": "Carol D."}

Delancey Street Foundation is the country's leading residential self-help organization for substance abusers, ex-convicts, homeless and others who have hit bottom. \n\nI had come to see, get acquainted and begin to learn, since I advocate for people with criminal records in the employment arena.\n\n(paraphrased from their materials): Delancey Street Restaurant is a key training school of the Delancey Street Foundation. For 35 years, Delancey Street has provided a home and all services to thousands of residents at no cost to the client and no cost to the taxpayer. The Foundation earns its money through enterprises such as Delancey Street Restaurant (and the Delancey Street Moving Company and Christmas Tree Farm), which trains its residents and also supports its operation. All tips are considered donations, and all restaurant proceeds after food costs go directly to house, feed and clothe Delancey Street residents and to teach skills, values and attitudes for a successful mainstream life.\n\nThe restaurant bills itself as an ethnic American Bistro, and it is. The food is excellent, and cheap. Beers are $2.50. Basically, for San Francisco or anywhere, it's a steal.\n\nThe staff is friendly, and the outdoor patio is sunny and relaxed.\n\nBut most important, it's a testament to hope.", "author": "Michael S."}

Finally we ordered (hoping that he would leave us alone).  We split the fried artichoke hearts appetizer with aioli.  My friend ordered a mixed green salad.  I ordered one of the specials; an heirloom tomato salad.  For our main courses, my friend had the grilled ahi and I ordered the chicken picatta.  \n\nWe did not have a single thing that was even edible.  I tried one of the artichoke hearts and it had a metallic taste.  My guess is that they cooked the hearts in a reactive pan with lemon.  Ick.  The aioli was not house made - it was jarred mayo with too much raw garlic added.  Then I tried another artichoke heart and almost freaked out;. a sharp piece caught in my throat.  It had not been properly trimmed!!  .  Of course, you couldn't tell that it hadn't been trimmed because it was battered and fried.  They also were not cooked enough to be tender. How hard is it to cook an artichoke?\n\nThe worst crime, though, was the \"heirloom\" tomato salad.  I know herloom tomatoes. l grow heirloom tomatoes.   This was no heirloom tomato salad.  These were Safeway mid-winter quality hard, unripe, barely pink , flavorless tomatoes, cut into small chunks and served with red onions, 3 (three!) tiny pieces of mozarrela and approximately 3 basil leaves.  I was appalled.  I could NOT believe that they would say they were serving heirloom tomatoes when any moron could see that they were not!  C'mon.  Those of you who know tomatoes know exactly what I mean.   They were swimming in a pool - really, it was over an inch deep - of very heavily acidic, yet totally unseasoned, vinegarette.  \n\nMy friend ate only a little bit of her grilled tuna, but she was too polite to say anything.  My chicken piccata was literally inedible.  I make chicken piccata all the time.  It SHOULD be chicken breasts pounded thin, dredged in seasoned flour, sauteed in olive oil until crispy and golden brown, then removed and the sauce finished with lemon, chicken stock , white wine (I sautee some shallots first) and then a swirl of butter,  capers and Italian parseley are added.  \n\nThis dish did not resemble a chicken piccata at all.  It was a huge mound of overcooked white pasta with slices of chicken \"tenders\" - not breaded, not browned, not sauteed - they looked boiled.  White, boiled chicken on white mushy pasta..  Then the whole thing was just saturated in a gigantic white pool of gravy - like cream sauce with a TON of raw garlic added.  I mean a ton.  And I love garlic.  Even though I was very hungry, I could only eat 2 bites of that awful, mushy, white, overpoweringly garlicy pasta.  I couldn't even detect any lemon.  There was not one single caper.  No parsley.  It was unbelievably awful.  Maybe this dish was the worst crime; it's hard to decide.  The lie about the tomatoes, which weren't heirloom,  or the lie about the picatta, which was actually mushy pasta and boiled chicken?\n\nMeanwhile, the waiter interrupted us every 3 minutes.  We had a lot to talk about, but it was hard to maintain a train of thought when we were constantly disturbed.\n\nEven the valet parking was bad - they were not busy, but it took forever for us to get our car.\n\nWhat bugged me most about this was the dishonesty.  The tomato salad was a special for that night and was printed out and attached to the menu that day.  Why was it necessary to do this?  Leave it OFF if you can't get heirloom tomatoes!.  Don't LIE about it!  I felt that it was a major insult to my intelligence - did they think I could not tell the difference?  San Francisco diners are far too sophisticated to be mistaken for such idiots.  Delancey Street needs to give them some credit and clean up their act (and their restroom).  \n\nActually,  this place deserves minus 2 stars.  An  awful meal, with service not much better, from the hostile host, to the overbearing waiter, to the slooow valet.  I would endure bad service if the food was good.  Instead, it really did not even qualify as food, since it was seriously inedible.  Blech.  I had to get fast food when I got home because I was starving.  It was far superior to Delancey Street, which is really shameful.", "author": "Pam P."}

To me it was like eating at Dennys except  it wasnt 2am and I wasnt  legally drunk.  I guess the high ratings are for the 'fell off the truck' low prices.  It is pretty cheap but charging full price for soda refills without telling you?  Withholding that information + my coke addiction = highway robbery . \n\nThe man that served us was on his best behavior.   He spent extra time with us when we had questions regarding the specials.  He was accomodating when I told him my ribs were too salty and made sure the charges were thrown out.  The Rueben I got in its place was pretty solid and I downright attacked it.\n\nOverall I'd say Delancey Street Restaurant is a 2 star place but Ill give them some extra love for the program they represent.  \n\nDavids bottom line- that and I dont wanna get shanked.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-03-03", "description": "I have so many great things to say about this place. For starters, the mission of the Delancey Street Foundation is inspiring. Proceeds from its numerous enterprises benefit individuals who are rebounding from troubled, drug- and crime-filled pasts. The restaurant empowers its servers to improve their skills and build new lives--and by the hard work and friendliness of every employee in the establishment, you can tell that they are sincerely happy to be there.\n\nThe food itself is very good--not perfect, but better than you would expect for such low prices. On one occassion, I ordered the french toast with strawberries and home fried potatoes (delicious!). On another, I ordered the standard 2 eggs/bacon/toast/potatoes combo (another hit!). Both items were around $6-$7 each, a steal considering the quality and location of the place. \n\nSpeaking of the location, Delancy Street Restaurant is situated a block or two from the Bay Bridge, against a gorgeous backdrop of the SF waterfront. Outdoor and window-view seating offers stunning views of the bay. Inside the restaurant itself, there is always a cheerful, upbeat atmosphere that makes the place the perfect destination for a nice, relaxing weekend brunch. Plus, there is plenty of space. Rarely will you have to wait for a table--a luxury you won't come by at other popular AM hot spots like Mama's, Dottie's, and Brenda's.\n\nOverall, this place is a winner. As a standalone restaurant, Delancey's low prices, good food, and buoyant dining atmosphere make this place a must-visit for anyone in SF looking for a good brunch. But, of course, there is the added bonus of an inspiring mission and top-notch service from friendly individuals seeking to rebuild their lives. In the end, the latter enhances Delancey's status as one of SF's top dining destinations.", "author": "Joseph F."}

There was an order of fried calamari ordered for the table and the odd thing was that someone had already squeeze our lemon onto the appetizer for us. The entire thing was soo SOUR! It was just odd that someone squeezed it on for us and even left the used lemon on there... \n\nThe waiter we had was super nice and tried to be very helpful. Alas some of it was out of his control and some was. To start my husband and I came in with the cake, one was an ice cream cake and the other was a mousse cake. I asked the waiter to put the cake in the freezer since it was an ice cream cake. He graciously complied. At the end of our dinner when we asked him to pull it out and serve it, we find out he had put it in the fridge... if that. The entire cake was melting!! Aargh so sad cuz it ruined the look of the cake and we all were slurping it up. And the waiter didn't even seem to realize it or didn't say anything about the fact it was MELTING! Ahh i felt so bad for my sister-in-law. \n\nOnto the part that was out of his control... I ordered the ribeye steak, how bad could that be? Pan fry or grill the steak to a medium consistency and boom you're done. The rest is up to the quality of the meat. Both my sister-in-law and I ordered the same ribeye dish and we both asked for medium. When it came out hers was RARE. She sent it back to have it re-cooked. When it came back out after 15 min it was probably medium or medium-well. Not too bad. Half of my steak was medium to medium-rare but I figured it was tolerable. Then as I got to the other half of the steak, it was totally RARE.... Sigh really? I sent it back with the waiter to be a medium and he came back out with it in like 5 min, I was thinking \"that was fast!\" and I ate maybe 1 or 2 more bites and then it went back to be totally RARE again.... *facepalm* At that point, I was full and wanted to save room for the dessert, so I figured I'd save it and re-heat it myself at home and it'll be the perfect temp then.... *sigh*", "author": "Grace L."}

Sounds pretty banal right? Well, substitute \"errand bitch\" for administrative assistant and \"mean old lady\" for writer, and you've got a better picture of my job. (Seriously, the woman once yelled at me for two hours because I couldn't restring the ink tape in the typewriter. Nevermind that the typewriter was older than I was, she was upset that UCSD Computer Services couldn't assist me either.) \n\nAnyways, \"The Dragon,\" as I liked to call her, fashioned herself an investigative reporter and interviewer. In reality, she was a 75-year-old autograph hunter who chased down celebrities. She once got me on the phone to the White House to demand why President Bush wasn't returning her emails. No joke. \n\nIt was through her that I first learned about Mimi Silbert and the great things she has done with the Delancey Foundation. The Dragon was trying to write a book about how celebrities felt the world could change for the better. I was just as impressed then as I am now about a self-funded organization that provides rehabilitation to ex-convicts. Only now that I've eaten there, I have even more justification. \n\nThe food was delicious, with that sort of less-than-perfect homecooked taste that a lot of the more frou-frou places don't even bother trying to replicate. I very much enjoyed my avocado-bacon-white cheddar omelet. The OJ was freshly squeezed, and my mimosa was fantastic. The waiters were genuinely friendly and helpful, and although the service itself was rather slow, everything was done with a smile. \n\nOne caveat, though: the main table at the front of the restaurant was kept empty the entire time we were there. That alone wouldn't have been odd, but it was clear it was the \"special\" table. Instead of the generic carnation centerpiece, it had hibiscus. Instead of paper napkins and the three utensil setting, it had cloth napkins and the more elaborate four. According to our server, that table is saved for the \"boss.\" Not that she really ever comes in, but \"just in case\" she does, it's ready to go. So no one ever sits at that table. \n\nFor such a charitable organization, that just strikes me as weird. And a little upset, although not nearly as upset as the Dragon was when all she ever received back from Ms. Silbert was a courtesy thank you card.", "author": "Devon S."}

It's a perfect \"neighborhood\" restaurant in the middle of a busy street, if you will.  \n\nThe food is not going to overwhelm you with creativity or originality, but the prices might.  All dinner entrees are under $14.95 with many under $11.  They also have a 3-course prix fixe for $16.95.  Can you believe it?  These are TGI Friday's prices!\n\nIf you come here, try a side order of potato latkes with applesauce.  They're guaranteed to make you 6% more Jewish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-01-03", "description": "Extra stars because I really love what they do for the community!\n\nDelancey Street Restaurant, in case you didn't know, is run by the Delancey Street Foundation - which is the country's largest self-help residential organization for people who have hit rock bottom to rebuild their lives.  The organization helps convicts, drug addicts and anyone else who has hit the rocks and wants to be given a second chance at life.  They do all of this at no cost to the taxpayer OR THE CLIENT!!\n\nHow do they fund this amazing program?  Well, one way is through the Delancey Street Restaurant.  The restaurant is staffed by recovering addicts, convicts and clients of the program, and is their stepping stone into a new life.  All the proceeds from the restaurant (after covering costs, of course) goes right back into the program.  When you eat here, you're really giving back to the community and helping to support something so needed in San Francisco.\n\nYou can tell the wait staff is happy to be there - it shows through in their exemplary service.  Our waiter was so wonderful, helpful and really made us feel like we were the only guests in an otherwise packed restaurant.  By far, the friendliest restaurant in town!!\n\nThe food is an eclectic mix of ethnic foods, representing the broad base of clients that they help.  The food is served up in huge portions and the price is amazingly inexpensive.  The fare is pretty decent and, where it lacks in foodie points, it makes up for in karma.  \n\nI had the ribs, greens and sweet potato pie.  Excellent!  The BF had the rib eye steak, and he didn't talk much through the meal, so it must have been good.\n\nThe location is lovely with views of the bay and the bridge.  When you go there, you'll walk in hungry, and you'll leave full - full of great food and knowing you did something to help someone get a second chance in life.  Well worth 5 stars in my book!!", "author": "Christy L."}

I was super excited to try this new place out...and was honestly disappointed.  \n\nThe restaurat is super cute and in a very good location right on the Embarcadero looking out towards the bay bridge.  We were greeted by the friendly valet man & he opened our door for us, and we were greeted by the friendly manager.  He sat us right by the big christmas tree which was very nice.  Our water & warm bread came immediately, and our waiter came by to take our drink orders.  \n\nWe both ordered a class of the La Crema Chardonnay, it was $7.25 per glass, but they fill up the glass pretty nicely =) \n\nFor our food we decided to share the CRISPY CALAMARI RINGS with lemon cayenne aioli $5.95, the calamari was crispy as advertised and tasted great, though a bit TOO lemony.  \n\nFor our entrees, my gf got the ROTISSERIED BEEF AU JUS with horseradish mashed potatoes & grilled vegetables $10.95, the steak was made just the way she wanted, however was a bit tough.  Very peppery, but still tasty. \n\nI had originally ordered the PEPPERED AHI TUNA , GRILLED OR SEARED with wasabi noodles $12.95, it was a large slab of tuna, i asked mine to be seared medium rare.  I took one bite and the taste of ocean fishiness filled my mouth. hmm.. my gf took a taste and immediately said, \"that shouldn't have such a fishy taste\".  we LOVE sushi, and fresh fish should NOT taste of the ocean. I called our waiter back and politely told him that i did not think the fish was fresh and that I would like to order something else, he was very gracious and immediately took the dish away.  \n\nMy new order was the SEARED SCALLOPS with snap peas & Szechuan noodles $10.95, the scallops & snap peas were in a satay style, and instead of the szechuan noodles, were actually the wasabi noodles...so i hate to speculate, but i am pretty sure they just transferred the wasabi noodles from my original tuna dish over to my new dish. =( the scallops were dry and tough.\n\nWe ended the meal with a slice of the sweet potato pie as we kept reading these rave reviews about how delicious it was. It came, it was huge, we ate, and we were not impressed.  Not very tasty, not moist, the crust was dry and hard. \n\nI don't want to write this place off just yet as I keep hearing good things...so i will definitely give this place another shot. Hopefully they can redeem themselves..only thing that saved them from getting 1 star was the very very good service & their graciousness at taking my dish back.", "author": "Lulu C."}

It was light and good.  The mango salsa also made it really appetizing.\nBuffalo Wings: A bit salty and they were really tiny\nAlexanjandro: cheesy and fried goodness.

So! Overall, this place is extremely weird. It's one of those restaurants where there are so many different types of cuisine on the menu that you know they're not going to do any of them right, and sure enough, they didn't. The food is bad-to-generic, and the prices are okay, if slightly too pricey for bad-to-generic lunch food. There is a nice sunny patio, and it is in a kind of dead part of town where there aren't very many other places to eat. In fact, for lunch on a Thursday, it was totally quiet and there were almost no other people around. Eerie. \n\nI got a grilled vegetable sandwich with a salad. Now, I know this isn't exactly a groundbreaking dish, but the vegetables were overcooked and bland, and the salad was basically lettuce. One of my coworkers got some sort of chicken sautee over quinoa that was a) very skimpily portioned and b) looked like something your mom would make, if your mom was kind of a crappy cook. \n\nMaybe their dinner food is better. Anyway, if you're totally starving and must eat now (as we were), go ahead. Otherwise, if you want to be charitable, do some volunteer work or donate money, either of which would probably do more direct good than eating here, and wouldn't involve having to eat bland, mediocre food.", "author": "alice t."}

Personally, I wait until 5:30pm to dine here because that is when you can begin ordering off the dinner menu.  Nothing against the brunch and lunch menus.  \n\nBut you MUST order the babyback ribs, greens, and sweet potatoe pie.  It is so tasty.  I take people here for the ribs all the time, and not a single person has been disappointed.  Even if there is a large group, most of us order the ribs and greens.....and those who don't try to take ribs and greens from the smart people who did order it.\n\nService is exceptional.  The entire staff is friendly, helpful and polite.

But, first things first...\n\nI like to drive almost everywhere and the parking at Delancey's is super easy on the weekends. There were plenty of metered spots and if that's ever an issue, they also have valet service at the very reasonable price of $4.\n\nIt was a little too cold to sit outside, but there were plenty of great tables inside along the window, which is a definite plus for me. \n\nOur waiter, Tim, was an absolute star. I took his recommendation for the appetizer, entree and dessert and he was three-for-three. All amazing. I started with the ceviche....delish. When the chicken hash came, Tim brought a side of hot tortillas, even though they didn't come with the meal. He just thought I'd like them better with them. I mean, how cool is that? It was the perfect addition to the meal. The dessert was a graham cracker crust cheesecake with a layer of snickers bar sandwiched in there. Can you say ridonculous?! Soooo good. \n\nAlso, I had no idea of the philanthropic spin at Delancey's. Aside from it being a wonderful cause, (and not a band-aid to the problem since the people who work here are getting skills they can use), I think the service here was better than the service I've received at most places I've been to in this city.

The scrambled eggs were a bit over cooked to my liking but the must have used like 3 eggs....there was so much I couldn't finish it.  The steak was not huge but just enough.

Nowhere else but here.\n6)  The FOOD - I got the eggs benedict and I would get them again.  Absolutely filling with the yolk oozing at just the right amount.  My friend got the spinach & mushroom egg white omelette, which was super duper healthy and delicious.  The spinach & mushroom were actually mixed in with this cream sauce that was cooked into the omelette that made for a really light, yet filling meal.

I really wanted to be on the top of a high rise building but they were all full...boo.  So I decided on Delancey Street because of the very reasonably priced menu with a lot of choices, that it's on The Embarcadero with a view of the Bay Bridge, and, interestingly, that this restaurant is part of a self-help foundation for those who have hit rock bottom and are dedicated to change their lives.  I learned a lot about what they do at their website: http://www.delanceystreetfoundation.org/wwa.php.\n\nI am so glad we came here!  I made reservations for 8pm, and I asked for a window seat.  They said they were going to be busy, so it might not be possible, but they would try.  We ended up getting there 45 minutes early, so I asked them if they could bump our reservation forward, and within 5 minutes, we had seats!  Not next to a window, but hey, they were definitely pulling strings.\n\nI really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant.  The attire was a mix between dressy and casual, so I didn't feel out of place in a sparkly dress, but I could come back in jeans and feel just as welcome.  Our server and busser were very prompt and polite as well.\n\nFood was DE-LIC-IOUS!  And did I mention reasonable?  Bread and oil for starters...a really tasty onion-y bread.  Two large Spaten beers each.  I had carrot soup and an organic greens and wine poached pear salad...YUM!!

He returns 5 minutes later with a hot fudge sundae topped with whipped cream and strawberries and an extra container of hot fudge on the side.

My 2nd time, the seafood ceviche was totally garlic in taste (too bad, I think it would have been good otherwise).The hot fudge sundae was great!\n\nMy 3rd try, last Sunday I had the grilled steak sandwich again and, knowing it would come well-done, I was prepared but it was thicker and tastier than the time before and the salad was nice again. \nThe Ferrari Fume' Blanc wine is a steal at $6.95 glass and they give you a nice pour. The wait service is pleasant although I find they disappear until you are ready for the check (as in no stop over to ask \"is everything okay)?\n\nThe reason I keep going back is their Mission: it's training for those coming out of recovery back into the working world and I applaud that loudly. I used to buy my clients Christmas trees from Delancey Street in Beverly Hills for that very reason. They do good things for these people and unless they give me burned, spoiled, food, I will probably keep going there but not expecting a gourmet meal.\n\nid I mention there are always fresh flowers on the tables and  cloths on the table.

I started with the crabcake ($4.95) and then had the carribean chicken (about $11).  The chicken might have been the best chicken I have ever had, though you have to like spicy chicken.  I also had a draught beer for $2.50.  This place rocks!  The service was also great.\n\nI was so impressed that I took my boyfriend and his mom there the next night.  That night I had the spanakopita for a starter and it was great.  My boyfriend and his mom are Greek and they also loved it.  Then I had the pear and walnut salad, which was very tasty, though they separated all the ingredients, so if I had one request it would have been that they mixed it for me.  Finally, I had the steak (about $14 I think) with sweet potato pie.  The steak had a lot of fatty bits, which I'm not so fond of, but the majority that was lean was amazingly tender and juicy.  It was delicious.  And the potato pie... amazing.  I had the same server as the night before, and again he was fantastic.  This is my new favorite restaurant.", "author": "Tony B."}

All for a great cause.  This review would be simply boring if we left it at that, so we'll try and add a bit of color to it.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the seared Ahi Tuna and Jumbo Gumbo.  The tuna, at $11 a plate, was pretty good.  It wasn't the most delicious dish this side of Aqua, but the fish was prepared with care and the spices were not too strong, enough to make your tastebuds clap their hands.  The gumbo was a bit bland.  You would expect a bit more spice-yness in Cajun-inspired food.  However, the ginormous portions made up for it, so the overall dish was average.  (As you can see, we pit \"value\" on the same playing field as \"tastiness.\")\n\nFor appetizers, we had crab cake.  It was good, but the patty looked like it was taken out of a frozen dinner package.  Then again, we weren't here for presentation so we let it slide.  The actual taste was pretty good and it was big enough for us to share-- always a plus in the \"economical newlywed\" book.\n\nHowever, dessert just blew us away.  It was HUGE.  We had a coconut-flavored molten lava cake.  It was like they injected the cake with coconut crack.  It was so good.  All for $4.50.  \n\nOverall, we would've given this place a 3.5, but because of the prices and purpose, we had to round up.

It makes me cry a little when I think of all the money I wasted on mediocre, over-priced pizza at Amici's when this little gem was just right down the Embarcadero. \n\nTears aside, a few coworkers and I decided to check out this restaurant for lunch a couple of weeks ago. When you first enter the restaurant it looks like it's going to be expensive - white tablecloths, waterfront views, etc. And then you open the menu and it's like a ray of money-saving light shines down on you. Virtually everything is under $10, and there are plenty of bargains for $5-$6. It's a lovely contrast to the usual South Beach sit-down restaurant prices.\n\nAfter ordering our food we realized that we were entirely justified to have a drink at lunch on a Friday, and out came the beer and huge mimosas. When we got the bill we first thought there had been a mistake - $3 beers and $3.75 mimosas? Really? That beats almost all of the local happy hours. \n\nThe food itself was probably a 4-star rating, but portion-wise you get more than your money's worth. My portobello mushroom sandwich and salad was generous, and one of my coworkers ordered ribs that came with a piece of sweet potato pie the size of my head. It was all flavorful and perfect for lunch. When you add in the fact that Delancey Street Foundation is a great organization and all of the proceeds from the restaurant go directly to it, it was an all-around feel-good experience.\n\nNeedless to say, I am a fan and will be back there on Friday.

The sweet potato pie had too much cream, and not very \"potato-y.\" The lamb shank was okay, but I wasn't a big fan of the mashed potatoes. Crab cakes were super dry, and the crab didn't have that sweetness of fresh crab to it. The snow peas were under done. The linguine with shrimp and garlic was almost not palatable. It was in this soupy lemon concoction that was bland and bitter (from too much lemon?).  \n\nSummary:\nOverall the food is \"acceptable\" given the price, but the food just isn't good.", "author": "H.

They were very professional and initially I wanted the bigger private room but it cost more.. But they gave me the bigger private room with all glass windows and view of the bay bridge for the same price as the smaller private room!!! They made the decor soooooo beautiful and I was sooooo happy and surprised how beautiful they made everything from the menu to the flower details. AND the food was sooooooooooooooo good!!! Everyone ordered the mixed BBQ plate, angel hair pasta and the gumbo seafood. Everyone enjoyed the food! I had a 3 course that included salad and dessert. Appetizers were at no additional cost which included bread and nachos. The waiters were so great too. I highly recommend this restaurant and the team. They were professional, easy to work with. My experience here exceeded my expectations.  Thank you for making my rehearsal dinner perfect!!", "author": "Anne A."}

It's a nice restaurant - kept immaculately clean and decorated with tablecloths and fresh flowers on every table, yet I've never gotten a funny look walking in wearing a t-shirt and jeans. It's more like they don't seem to take a casual diner for granted. There are always plenty of servers and various helpers milling about, so water and other beverages are always kept full. Everyone I've seen working there has been effusively polite.\n\nThe food is also quite good. We've been half a dozen times, but for our visit today, my husband had the Italian omelette with a side of bacon and iced tea, and I had a reuben sandwich and a hot apple cider. I can't comment on his food other than to say he's ordered that dish repeatedly (I've also tried several of their omelettes - can't go wrong). My reuben was great - very mild flavors that melded well, rather than the usual oversalted corned beef. It also wasn't over-sauced or over-cheesed, so while being tasty and satisfying, I didn't need a stack of extra napkins to clean up. The fries it came with were outstanding - just the thinnest layer of crispy surrounding a perfectly fluffy center. And of course, the hot apple cider. I get one every time! It comes with two cinnamon sticks and a slice of orange in it, and is simply the most comforting drink I can think of, better than tea, cleaner and lighter than cocoa. Portion sizes are on the large size of reasonable - I couldn't finish my sandwich, but my husband finished his omelette and said he was stuffed afterward.\n\nDespite the generous portions, good food, excellent service, and pleasant decor and scenery, the bill for two including tax and a generous tip was about $25. Where else in this city do you get that kind of value? We'll be back, probably many times over.", "author": "Erica T."}

Everyone was happy with these.\n\nMain: I ordered the linguini with prawns and garlic.  The prawns were good and there was a lot of garlic, which I always appreciate, but the 3 stars come from the fact that the pasta itself and sauce tasted like it was out of one of those pasta roni boxes.  Don't ask how I know, but I KNOW. All bad.  One of my pals ordered steak cooked medium and it came out well done.  It was also not very much food at all and was flavorless.  Everyone else seemed to like their food.  I'll try something else next time and update.\n\nOverall a 3, but keep in mind that the prices are FANTASTIC. \nI would say that if you want to have a cheap date, take her/him here.", "author": "Josie A."}

The restaurant has a cute, casual atmosphere (and pretty flowers) and the servers were very nice and helpful.

The Boy (who I dragged here) tried the Beef Au Jus, which he was a big fan of. Mainly because there was a huge slab of beef on his plate. \n\nUnfortunately, the best part of my meal was when I stole his wasabi mashed potatoes.

There was a lot of chewing and tugging, not the fall off the bone kind we make at home. Another friend got the fish. It was dry but still enjoyable, LOOK! SUNSET!

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, and they had great Christmas decorations.\n\nService: This is probably the best service I've had at a restaurant in years - super attentive, super polite, very careful about making sure that everything was taken care of.  Our waiter did forget the soup at one point, but he got it really quickly when we reminded him.  We didn't have to ask once for a water refill.  We also got some free appetizers because some kitchen snafu resulted in our entrees being delayed - we hadn't even really noticed the delay until he mentioned it.\n\nPrice: Amazingly cheap.  5 people with dessert and appetizers for just about $100.\n\nFood: As mentioned by others, the quantity of each plate is more than enough.  A single slice of sweet potato pie was enough for all 5 of us to split.\n\nThe quality of the food is ok.   Some people have written that the food is bland, but I think that's inaccurate.  It's more appropriate to say that the taste is flat.  Each dish has one main flavor, and there is very little subtlety and not really any sub-flavors.  It actually isn't bad for most dishes.\n\nAppetizers: Fried Artichoke Hearts were fantastic!  Crispy Potato Cakes are also a big thumbs-up.   The Baba Ganoush and Hummus plate is a thumbs-down.  The hummus had some spice sprinkled over it that had kick, but everything else was outright bland.  We also got two free plates of calamari because our dinner was delayed (for some random reason).  It came out hot and fresh, which is good, but was average otherwise.\n\nEntrees: I had the Rotisseried Beef Au Jus (basically a prime rib).  The outer edge was more or less pure peppercorn.  The inside was your standard prime rib, with out much extra flavoring aside from the beef itself.  The horseradish mashed potatoes had a great consistency and were totally smooth, but taste like pure horseradish.  I didn't even have room to eat the grilled vegetables.\nSweet Potato pie is really good - they do a great job of pureeing the sweet potatoes.  The primary flavor is nutmeg, but the sweet potato pie actually has some subtle undertones that work well together.\n\nDesserts: Tiramisu was as good as any other tiramisu I'd had, though significantly bigger.  The hot fudge sundae was your standard sundae.  Both were good for two people to share.", "author": "Howard S."}

They have some interesting dishes, like the small-sized smooth (not chunky) crabcakes (yes they do have flavor, are not bland, as one review suggested), served with mango papaya salsa, black bean corn relish, and green beans, but too much salt in the beans, detracted from the whole delicate presentation and balance of flavors. The rosemary pan-fried chicken (half a bird) had a good flavor, came with squash and grilled eggplant slices. The thin-crust one-person pizza margarita, one of our party said, was decent. The salmon with soy glaze was indeed a light dish, and in fact, nothing we saw was heavily sauced-- the food spoke for itself in this sense, unencumbered. \n\nThe salad of greens with poached pear and gorgonzola consisted of a presentation of each ingredient separately on the plate--the pears were delicious, but the balsamic dressing was oil mostly, hardly a taste of vinegar. The lightly friend artichoke hearts were delicious, but the batter a bit thick. We saw on another table that the chicken and baby back ribs combo with mustard & collard greens, & sweet potato pie, looked huge and juicy, with the pie a striking orange color against the delicate pastry crust. \n\nWe all had desert, after reading that the best reviews here were of the deserts.

The prices were already low enough. \n\nService:\nAll the servers and wait staff were very nice, polite and courteous.  \n\nOverall, the food was not something that I would go back for, but I am all for their cause!!!  I really wish their FOOD was MUCH better because I would come back in a heart beat.  The location is in a great spot as we took N Judah and got off at Brannan and walked across the street and it was right there\n\nWhen I read one of the reviews I noticed that one reviewer wrote, the wait staff at the restaurant didn't look like they were homeless, drug addicts or out of rehab.  Do you really think they would put servers and wait staff out there looking like that???  I am SURE that they get them all groomed up.  They must attend their school in order to start working.  \n\nThe more I read Yelp reviews, I don't know what to think anymore.  People think they are foodies when they really aren't.   And some reviewers comments are just so bizarre.  This place is just a forum for people to tell others what THEY think, but readers like me can take it with a grain of salt.", "author": "H L."}

Inner panic tells me we are severely under-dressed. \nOur friendly waiter appears with bagel chips and water. We order coffee and he inquires whether we would like something from the espresso bar. Nice touch. \nI begin to peruse the extensive menu and notice the prices, white tablecloths, uniformed waiters, and location on the Embarcadero don't exactly match up. How do they keep the lights on, much less the door open?\nThen it comes out. All these waiters were all once homeless, or convicts, or drug addicts. Really? I look around at all the faces. Really?

We took the Yelp reviews and thought we could have a view of the bay bridge while dining at our table.  However, only a few tables were placed by the window that provides glimpse of the bay and the bridge.  So both the food and the expected views disappointed us.

Everything on the brunch menu, for example, hovers around $6.  Yes, you read that correctly.\n\nThird, this is an excellent space.

We went for dinner and we had the soup, lamb shank, and the gumbo.  Everything was bland and tasted the same, which is kinda weird to me since we ordered completely different things. It kinda reminded me of cafeteria food (Some people like that, though)  I would not come back for dinner, but might try breakfast one day.

I've been here on many occasions and I've gotten nothing but great food and great service.  Their dinner is amazing and the prices are just right! The steak & chicken plate is very filling & I just love how they come with a damp cloth & lemon to help you clean up your hands :) I love their pesto pasta as well with their bruschetta mmmmmmm.  I think this place is so awesome I tell everyone about it and hear nothing but good stuff in return.  I went here on Valentines Day & they had very cute heart candies at every table with candles, they also changed the names of the plates to cute funny names, & gave us complimentary heart shaped brownies wrapped on our way out!! Are they the best or what? I also brought my grandma here for Brunch and it was once again amaaazing.  Great french toast and great omelets, next time I think I am going to try the one with mozzarella sausage and marinara! Mmmm man I've got to cut it here, I've made myself hungry!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2005-07-06", "description": "Delancey Street is unique in that it is staffed completely by recovering drug addicts, alcoholics, and ex-convicts, who work in exchange for rehabilitation services and housing in the Delancey Street Foundation complex within which the restaurant is located. In a word, the food preparation here is impeccable. I have eaten here at least a dozen times, have always ordered something different, and have never been disappointed with my choice. The menu is eclectic, offering samples of home cooking from around the world. Selections are as diverse as Yankee Pot Roast, Thai Red Curry Prawns, Caribbean Grilled Chicken Breast with Mango Sauce, and Moroccan Chicken. Some of the best food is from the grill or rotisserie, including loin of pork, leg of lamb, and a huge slab of rare beef crusted in black peppercorns and a natural juice that moistens the huge pile of garlic mashed potatoes on which it rests. Equally good are the barbecued chicken and baby back ribs combination and the spit-roasted rosemary chicken. There's also a selection of pastas, the best of which is a highly spiced version of Penne Arrabbiata. The Spinach Salad is a great starter; if you have the room, any one of the desserts is a treat. Amazingly, the huge portions don't command hefty prices - most entrees are less than $15.00, and chances are you'll leave with a doggie bag containing enough for a second meal.\r\n\r\nNote: given these people have turned around their lives, the pathetically unnecessary and witless comments about the host being an ex-con snorting coke made by a crass, classless, designer label-clad reviewer - ironically guzzling two drinks at once in her photo - was in the poorest possible taste.", "author": "Gourmet G."}

Plus there was only one other group in the restaurant, so perhaps we should have taken a hint.\n\nLater, when one of the people I was with was on the phone, a waiter cleared some of the plates and tried to whisper to her if she was done. It was kind of rude and unnecessary. \nAfter that, while the person was still on the phone, another waiter waved a menu loudly at us to get our attention and whispered loudly \"Dessert??\" \n\nWho does that??\n\nAlso, the waiters were standing near our table for most of the time not really doing anything and it almost felt like we were being listened to...it was a bit uncomfortable. \n\nKind of a bummer, but I suppose I learned to just stick to their brunch for better food and hopefully better service.", "author": "A W."}

Completely unneccesary.  It's fine to complain about a waiter's attitude, but why resort to name-calling and character attack?  In fact, it takes tremendous character for one to work hard against his/her past, to put a life back together-- and it shows zero character when a reviewer kicks people while they're down.\r\n\r\nRESTAURANT REVIEW: This restaurant does not need to rely on sympathy and charity to attract customers.  It's a good restaurant in its own right--solid cooking, good value (esp. for SOMA), wonderful bridge/water views, and a staff that's hardworking and down-to-earth.  By and large, the service we got here was better than other similarly-priced restaurants--contrary to what many would expect.\r\n\r\nThe cooking here is solid.

My friend requested that I'd find someplace decent and cheap for her farewell party (dammit - they're running from SF in droves!), and I'd seen Delancey Street come up in several talk threads as a such a choice for a large party.\r\n  I made 8pm reservations, thinking that I'd have to cattle-prod every one of the 10 guests into showing up on-time or else risk losing our table, like one might expect for other snotty Embarcadero restaurants.  But turned out the large place was near empty when I & the guest of honor arrived (Last. Oopsies.)\r\n  Service, while earnest from our waitress, was somewhat off - forgotten salad for one person, a loooong lag between apps and the entrees. \r\n   But the food itself was definitely good for the price.  I had a Rotisseried Beef Au Jus (very tender and tasty) w/mashed potatoes and grilled veggies. A couple of my friends got grilled scallops w/wasabi noodles which they both devoured. \r\n  Overall I think everyone was satisfied, though not overwhelmed by the food, service or atmosphere.  \r\n  I thought about pushing up my ratings because Delancey as a charitable foundation, is offering such a wonderful outlet to help people on the margin.  But I don't think it's fair or necessary to hyperbolize what Delancey Street Restaurant is.  What it IS, is a semi-casual establishment, a great place to have large parties, kids, and a decent meal for a very economic price.  \r\n  There aren't that many places in SF that can fit this niche, which I'm sure will keep Delancey going for years to come.", "author": "CINDY K."}

An occasional glimpse of a tattoo here and there reminded me of their 'history' but hey, I have ink too-  it's cool.  They had a personalized menu for our party and brought our food in and out with great efficiency.  Everything was good, nothing TOO spectacular, but solid indeed.  Don't hesitate to try it at least once!", "author": "Nicole G."}

So Sharon and I went on a whim last night on the way to the grocery store, because we got too lazy to cook. The food came out reasonably fast, which was good, since we still had to go grocery shopping. I got the Chicken piccata, which was described as having a \"light lemon butter sauce\" but it was more heavy on the butter and WAY to light on the lemon. The chicken was thin and kind of pressed, but the overall presentation and meal was good. Sharon had the Salmon w/ maki roll and said the maki roll was way too dry, but the salmon was good and only 500 calories total! Might go back there again for it's proximity to our apartment and not too pricey menu, but I'm definitely not going to plan a night there.", "author": "Matt H."}

It was nice that they served the crab still in the shell to show that it's real, but I didn't get any utensils to open it up. The chicken skewers were good (so I hear) and the Reuben was  delish (also by word of mouth). Unfortunately, the trout salad was a little too much cold trout and not enough salad.

Most of the bread is this interesting soft yeast-raised bread. Not sure what it is, but it goes well with the olive oil.\n\nToday they had matzo ball soup. It was good, not over-salted, with a firm-soft matzo ball. It was either a stingy bowl or a generous cup (when the check arrived, it turned out to be a very generous cup). I would have specifically ordered a bowl had I known, but then again, my entree was so generous I might not have had room.\n\nFor the entree, I had the roast lamb leg. A good-sized leg served with okay mashed potatoes and good carrots and root veggies. The meat was tender and easy to cut and chew.\n\nFor dessert, I had the Valrohna pudding cake. 15-minute wait, which the menu warns you about. It was good, although just slightly overdone.\n\nI got a little uncomfortable at getting \"sirred\" all the time, but then I understand they are being trained to work at fine restaurants, and that's a good thing.\n\nI was stuffed for $20 plus tax and tip, but you can get out of here for less.\n\nI don't know why anyone would want to drive with the light rail stop at the door, but if you do there is unbelievably cheap $4 valet parking.

Also tried the Ahi tuna sandwich, and you can choose how you want the Ahi from seared to grilled. Above average selection of wine.

This place is a very admirable institution (read about it on their website) and happens to serve decent food.\n\nWe were greeted and seated immediately since we went there around 2pm. We were given their Sunday brunch menu along with a wine list. We ordered the boca burger, lean-beef burger, Italian omelette, and the eggs benedict. It seemed like very standard fare for a traditional American restaurant, though they consider themselves \"ethnic American.\" I guess their other menus are slightly more \"ethnic\"\n\nThe boca burger was \"good\" according to my friend and came with the standards and came with home fries. The Italian omelette was basically an omelette stuffed with pizza ingredients topped with a marinara sauce. My friend made no comment about the beef burger so I will assume it was adequate- not bad, not great. I had the eggs benedict. The eggs were poached correctly and were the perfect runny consistency. The hollandaise was rich and creamy, as it should be. I thought overall, the dish was good but I was not wowed by it. My one gripe with this place was the \"home fries.\" They were lukewarm when they arrived and suggest that they were probably cooked ahead of time in mass quantities and reheated when served. The potatoes were limp and dry an were mixed with red and green peppers and onions. Rather than being \"home fries,\" they were more like potatoes o'brien, and they were bad potatoes o'brien.\n\nThe staff was warm and friendly. They seemed overly polite, if that is possible.\n\nOverall, the food was good and the service was good. I would come back again to try their lunch or dinner, since some items on those menus seem promising. If possible, I would have given it a 3.5.", "author": "Gary L."}

Everything about this place seemed great: the great views of the Bay Bridge, the large and fine restaurant ambiance and the service was on point. 2 stars already for that.\n\nGlancing briefly at yelp reviews before I ordered, I decided to get the BBQ chicken, BBQ ribs, sweet potato pie combination. This comes with a generous portion of mustard greens and a little bowl with extra barbecue sauce. For 11.95, this amount of food given all of the previously mentioned amenities cannot be beat. I literally had to share some of my food with my guest and he was definitely pleased. However, I was a bit disappointed with the food as it didn't live up to the rest of the restaurant's image and rep. \n\nHowever, for the price and what I got, the meal was perfect.

The food is adequate, but nothing special, probably the equivalent of what you could get one of the better diners around.

The blackened meatloaf was truly delicious, with much more spice and texture than the meatloaf in most restaurants. The fried artichoke hearts also stood out. The creme brulee was bursting with flavor from cardamom and vanilla. Good beer selection, too. \n* Extremely generous portions. I came famished, and still ended up taking half my meatloaf, slaw, and mashed potatoes home with me. Likewise for my companions' meals.\n* Unbelievable prices, literally. I really don't understand how they serve an enormous, high-quality meal for $12.\n* Good ambience. The couch-style seating looked fun (I didn't sit on it, so I can't say if it's as comfortable as it appears). And views of the  bridge lit up at night, nice.\n* Cool social mission.  I'm very impressed that the Foundation takes all these people with troubled pasts and turns them into such a functional team. You could tell our waiter wasn't a longtime pro at the job, but not because he made any mistakes, just because he wasn't as aloof or ironic as most SF servers.\n\nCons\n* The menu is large, but with a very heavy emphasis on big hunks of meat paired with starchy sides.\n* Uneven quality of food. My friend's crab crakes came with some mediocre green beans, and the pear salad was unexciting.", "author": "Mike B."}

We were seated right by the entrance at two round tables put together for the 5 of us and it took close to an hour for us to get our food, yet I still give this place 5 stars?  Our server was extremely friendly, refilled our glasses constantly and told us ahead of time that due to the crowd it would be a longer wait for our food.  Not being in any hurry, we appreciated the opportunity to have a leisurely brunch.  And when the food finally came it was delicious.  like who would've thought of making lemon-poppyseed waffles?  the eggs weren't overcooked, the variety on the menu meant everyone could find something they'd like, and they even split our bill three ways for us at the end.  everything was super cheap, yet super tasty and fresh.

Your tips go straight to the cause (so tip large).  The food is good (and personal in that residents contribute recipes or ideas for menu items).  It has a very good brunch (and you can sit outside).  (They fly in H & H bagels!  Or at least they did last time I went to brunch.)  (And they have good eggs benedict.)  You can throw really reasonable parties (dinners for about $30 a head, tax and tip included, but not wine) (cocktail parties for less), and parking (except on game nights) is easy and free (lots o' meters that are free at night).  The parties could involve taking over the entire restaurant  for dinner (minimum 70, Monday night you can have the whole place or you can take over a chunk of it on a non-Monday night, or have a lunch), or they could involve lovely parties in a private room, whether sit down (I've thrown baby showers here) or stand up (wine and lots of great hors d'oeuvres for all sorts of events).

My business partner and I decided to celebrate the end of a good year by taking ourselves to dinner.   We know how much care they put into their festive holiday decorations and their seasonal menu specials.  So when I ordered the Hanukkah three course meal, I was looking forward to a real treat...chicken and matzo ball soup, brisket, latkes and noodle kugel.  The soup was okay...the matzo ball was small and soft but the soup flavor was good.  Then came the brisket on a plate with potatoes...mashed AND boiled.  And then I was served the latkes (potato pancakes).  There were about a half dozen small carrot slices on the plate almost as an afterthought.  What about a green vegetable?? Too many potatoes, folks.  It was pretty gross.  The brisket was diminished by the sheer presence of so many potatoes.  Fortunately, the noodle kugel for dessert was great.

You know that the money you put down here isn't going towards drugs or alcohol as some employees of other restaurants do after work.  These are hard working people who are doing what they can to make the most of it.  If doing a good deed won't bring you here, then maybe the $3 premium beers will.  Service is good, the guys are funny if you just relax (c'mon, do you think you'd enjoy your job if every customer looked scared all the time?), and the ambience would set you back at 3x the price anywhere else on Embarcadero.  It's a hidden gem in my mind and looks pricey on the outside but once you look at the menu, you'll start wondering why you would go anywhere else.

We had just place our orders and been brought our beverages, when I see Mayor Willie Brown was by and enter the restaurant. The table next to us asked us to confirm if we also saw who it was that just entered, and we were all just really surprised but hey they are just people too right? Our waiter than comes with my half order of egg benedict and my friend's chicken hash.  Both by the way were very tasty.  I especially enjoyed my half order, I always like it when   restaurants give you that option :) We were engrossed in our food by now and didn't notice the two black Suburbans with tinted windows rolling up.  It wasn't until I saw a couple of men with ear pieces and sunglasses that I realized someone important must have just entered.

So we wandered until we hit Delancy, took a look at the menu and thought it was worth a spin.\n\nTwo stars because the food was unusually cheap.\n\nZero stars for the actual food, because of the frequent unpleasant surprises. When you order orange juice for brunch, you generally have a good idea of what you're getting--some version of pulpy or nonpulpy, fresh squeezed or Tropicana or from concentrate, or possibly some Tang-like orange-colored drink. But you're not expecting to be knocked over by a powerful mix that is half grapefruit juice WITHOUT ANY WARNING. Likewise when they advertise maple syrup, you aren't expecting it to be mixed with honey into a sickly, revolting syrup. And you don't expect the french toast to be made with bread that has seeds on crust so flavorful as to overwhelm the taste of egg on the bread. And so on. It's ok to be creative, of course, but you have to warn people so they have a reasonable chance at figuring out what they might want, rather than having a surprise foisted on them and then have to pay for something they really don't like.\n\nIf you want to help out a cause like this, it's better to just give your money to it directly.
