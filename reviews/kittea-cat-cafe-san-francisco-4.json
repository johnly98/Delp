I thought I would start on Thursday for a happy meowr for $15; unfortunately, the staff moved it to Wednesday at a different time schedule.  They gotta be kitten me!\n\nInside a special theme caf\u00e9, there's a cat lounge on the left side, and a modern caf\u00e9 at my right side.  If I want what's interesting and adventurous, petting many different types of cats was a remarkable experience.  Well, it's a good thing I paid $20 in advance, but I would never missed an opportunity on a next day.  \n\nIt's so much fun to give each cat a gentle rub while enjoying free glass of water or tea in the cat lounge.  It's never that easy to have a cat on my lap.  Only one cat was approachable enough to pounce on my shoulders, and that's Belle.  This female furball sure gives me a warm welcome.  But that's not the last I see of her.  Just when I wanted to give another cat to walk on my shoulder, Belle quickly pounced right on my shoulders!  THAT was the third time she's giving me her warm fuzzies.  Belle isn't the only cat who surprised me.  When I crouched and gently rubbed the cat I unknowingly bumped into, that orange cat zoomed through my legs and into the wooden hamster wheel.  Didn't see that everyday!\n\nIf I were to visit the same caf\u00e9 again, I would buy something to drink or eat.  But spending one full hour with cats is a better way to learn from very friendly staff members and customers, knowing cat language by its tail.  I might be back to enjoy the smell of their friendly atmosphere.", "author": "Jimmy C."}

Can't help but ponder the absurdity of what has become of our society that we need a place like this. \nPetting kitties and cats whilst having tea. Really? Couldn't you do this at your friends home? When I told people where I'd been they immediately offered their cats and their home and their tea. Free!! \n\nWe all know someone that has cats we can pet. We could even request the music and since presumably these are our friends, we can ask them to be quiet. While we pet. While we sip. \nSo why pay $25 for an hour of this privilege? I can make up all kinds of reasons to convince myself how much more zen it is not being emotionally tethered to anything and just letting in the furry love. I could say it's healing to be amongst many so well-socialized kitties that you need not worry that they'll run from you and you'll feel rejected.\n\nThe truth is I don't know why it's here. Part cool hip millennial factor part zen-out space where the warm kitties nesting in your lap feels transcendental. What? I'm teaching now. \n\nDissecting this experience any more is wasteful. If you're curious go. Or maybe If you have good friends house sit their critters for a day or two. I don't know. \n\nThe staff were lovely and informative. The space small but chill. The best part for me? That heated toilet seat!! Who knew using the potty and warming your bum at the same time could be so delightful.", "author": "Peddie A."}

I couldn't be happier when I first heard about this cafe opening up in the city. We lucked out as I didn't make reservations, but Ryan was gracious to accommodate us. There are two rooms: there's a small cafe where they serve food and drinks including some delicious hot tea. You can choose from a range of different teas and coffee drinks. I got a cup of hot tea before going into the other room where the kitties are.\n\nBefore going into the room where the cats are, they require taking off shoes and sanitizing hands. We got a briefing from one of the staff about how to interact with the cats. The room is kept clean and didn't smell like cat pee which is a plus. The cats have a lot of areas to nap or hide for the skittish ones. The famous cat wheel by the window is well utilized, one of the black and white cats couldn't get enough of it. Cats with collars are up for adoption and the ones without  are resident cats. I would say there were about fifteen or more in the room. \n\nThere is an option to order and eat inside the room with cats, but the staff explained that they cannot serve customers directly due to the strict health code. Instead they have a protocol for customers to pick up there own food at the front desk near the entrance. Free tea refills are available inside the cat room offering four types of Japanese teas to choose from. The staff recommends visiting the cats towards the end of the day near closing time since they are more active just before dinner. They offer a stamp card- visit five times and get the sixth visit free. You know I'll be back!", "author": "Rebecca C."}

Whether you can't have your own pet cat because you rent in a no-pets building, or you're allergic enough that you can't have one in your space full-time, or you travel too much to be able to maintain your own pet, this is the place for you if you LOVE cats!!!\n\nEntry price ($20/hr weekday, $25/hr weekend) includes bottomless green tea, but for those of us who prefer black tea, you can purchase a pot of that, too!  They also make fancy waffles (savory or sweet!), various desserts (their dark chocolate sea salt cookies are DIVINE!!!), coffee, and hot chocolate.\n\nThe employees are all super-friendly and cat-knowledgeable.  They are very accommodating, and make sure you're given all the information you need in order to have the most enjoyable stay in the space!\n\nI applaud their good food/drink hygiene practices:  The people who handle your food and beverages are NOT the same people who handle the cats!  They're very strict about that, and that's very reassuring!\n\nIn my experience, the space is 100% WHEELCHAIR-ACCESSIBLE, including the bathroom!!  If you have any issues accessing the space, the employees will immediately jump into action and move anything that needs to be moved in order to facilitate your access! \n\nThe environment is CLEAN!  I'm mildly allergic to cats, but they keep the environment very low-dander, and so I've not had issues sitting in the cat room for the 1 or 2 hours at a time that I've gone.  That said, if you're allergic to cats and don't even want to be in the same room as them, you can still go to the cafe area, order food or tea/coffee/hot chocolate, and watch the cats through the large glass window that makes up one of the walls of the cafe!\n\nKittea also hosts special events:  yoga with cats, Saturday morning cartoons with cereal and cats, movie nights with cats, etc.!\n\nMost of the cats who live there full-time are black or orange tabbies, and there are always a few temporarily-in-residence cats available for adoption.  Most are very playful and social, although like anyone, sometimes a cat might be having an off day, or be extra sleepy during one of the visiting hours.  Steve, the giant black long-hair is one of the alphas, and is pretty friendly.  Otis is VERY playful, but also being an alpha, tends to boss some of the other cats around.  To me, the sweetest cats are Dolly (fluffy beige-orange, also the oldest in residence, has a special diet so can't eat any cat treats!), Ron (orange tabby with a nub at the end of his tail), and Shiloh (sleek black shorthair).  Pickles, the youngest and newest member of the pack at about 4 months, is a grey and black tabby who has tons of kitten energy, but also loves a good cuddle! \n\nI've been going here for the past two years or so, and it remains one of the most soothing spaces in what can be a very stressful city!  I've brought my mother-in-law here while she's in town visiting, various friends, and my partner and I sometimes make it part of a date night!

It's a neat little, well-organized place that does good work, provides a gratifying experience, and is just a fun spot to go to with family and friends.\n\nTo clarify if you don't know what a cat cafe is, it's a cafe that also acts as a shelter, rescue, and sanctuary. I've gone to some Taiwanese and Singaporean cat cafes, and the establishment is usually somewhat split between a cafe (no cats allowed in the cafe), another room where people can go in to eat and play with the cats (this usually has a lot of toys, trees, and perches specifically for them), and a gift shop (though sometimes the gift shop is combined with the cafe). KitTea Cat Cafe has followed this format with a gift shop in the front, a cafe with a window to the cat lounge, and the lounge with a large floor-to-ceiling street window. Love that windows in general, it really makes the space feel open and lets a lot of light in. \n\nThe cafe works like any other kind of cafe. They have coffee, sandwiches, and waffles, but they're most well-known for their all-you-can-drink green tea.There's three different kinds you can choose from; another two if you pay a little extra when ordering. You just go in and sit down to enjoy a coffee, work, write or just watch the cats. Any food you get in the cafe can be brought into the cat room, but there's also menus you can order from in there as well. Physically, the place  isn't that big. It has four small tables kind of crammed together and one long counter space where you can sit at look into the lounge. A number of people seem to like to sit in the cafe just to enjoy the ambiance and look in on the cats. Indeed, it's actually quite a nice spot to hang out, and the employees in the cafe are super accommodating. When I wasn't sure what kind of tea I wanted to try first they just let me sniff at ALL of the available samples (honestly though, they have warm pitchers of the three kinds of free tea inside the cat lounge as well, so you can try most of them). There was also this one girl who had set up in the cafe (laptop, books, just really settled in there). I don't know how long she was there or if she ever went in to see the cats. But she was sitting there when I went in, and still there two hours later. She apparently ordered food for the first time 15 minutes after our hour was up (half our friends were in the next shift), and she was very specific on the kind of bread and cheese she wanted in our grilled cheese sandwich. They don't actually HAVE grilled cheese on their menu, but they got her the grilled cheese anyways. \n\nIf you're planning on settling in the cafe for a few hours, be aware that there's a lot of crowding during that transitioning between appointments when the new group is coming in and the old group are coming out. There's a restroom in both the cafe as well as the cat lounge so you don't have to go outside during your hour, and risk the cats getting out. Additionally, BRING SOCKS. They require it. If you forget, you can buy a pair from the gift shop.\n\nHEADS UP, they will email you a waiver to sign ahead of time, so don't forget that. Like movie theaters, they're cheaper on weekdays, and have a happy hour on Thursdays where it's only $15 an hour per person in comparison to the standard $25 for a Sunday. Additionally, they have these bunch of fun events like movies and yoga, but with cats. I dearly wish I was local enough to try at least one of these.\n\nThey have policies that are put in place in order to prevent stressing out the cats. Their foremost measure is to keep too many people from going into the lounge at the time. That's why do RESERVATIONS if you can. Weekend slots get snatched up pretty quickly (it's the reason why my group had to go in two shifts). They do walk-ins, but it's first come first serve and space tends to be limited. If you're going to do this, try the weekdays. Same policy for if you're trying to reserve consecutive hours while in the shop apparently; they'll give it to you if there are slots available. Groups of eight and more require you to book it as another private event altogether. For the same reason, and like most cat cafes, they don't allow small children in. In this case, children under 9. And every child under 12 needs one supervising adult. \n\nSimilar to a lot of escape rooms, cancellations and not showing up are non-refundable. If you want to reschedule, do it days before the actual appointment, because they won't accept same-day changes either. If you arrive late, they won't extend or reschedule.\n\nUltimately, this is a place where people can interact with cats and relax. I saw a pair of spouses that looked like the most content people ever as they just kinda dosed with each other in the cat lounge. It's a space where you interact, play, and bond with cats in a space they're comfortable. And maybe, later adopt them. Either way, your money is going to a good cause.", "author": "Christine L."}

Here at KitTea, it just might actually be a positive thing. As opposed to its counterparts in Asia which are caf\u00e9s that happen to have cats, KitTea feels more like a cat adoption studio that happens to have a caf\u00e9 component.\n\nOn that note, your experience here can be as cat-immersive as you want. If you're content with viewing the cats from outside a window, you can sip tea and enjoy cookies, waffles, and sandwiches from their caf\u00e9. If you want to frolic with the cats - or, better yet, see if you want to adopt any of them - you can make a reservation for the cat lounge itself. Depending on the time of day, it costs anywhere from $15 to $25 an hour, and includes unlimited refills of their green tea. You can even bring items from the caf\u00e9 into the cat area, or order more from within.\n\nAs for the cats, the number roaming about, and their playfulness levels, will vary all day long. Some are permanent residents, while some are up for adoption - a certifiably good cause. In any case, the cats are not there to be performance objects, but are instead there to be worshipped by their human subjects.

We visited on a windy Sunday afternoon and would definitely recommend that you make reservations because they had completely booked all of the sessions that day.  Cat lounge visits are super easy to make online and can be made for every day of the week except for Tuesdays.  Weekends and holidays are typically $25 for a one-hour lounge visit and unlimited cups of green tea, and weekdays are $20.  However, if you're ever free on a Thursday from 3-6 PM there are \"Happy Meow'rs\" where you can save $5 on your visit.  \n\nParking can be a little tricky in this area, but we found a metered spot (no meters on Sundays!) two blocks down on Gough after driving around for a bit.  When we arrived, a staff member greeted us at the front and asked if we had a reservation.  We checked in and, since we were a little early, were told that we'd have about ten minutes to wait and could either browse the merchandise or head into the cafe.  The cafe is pretty small and has seating for around 15 people, so my friend and I opted to get started on the Japanese green tea (their genmaicha is delicious!) and browse the merch.  They've got tons of adorable, sassy, cat-themed dishes, cards, stickers, socks, bags, shirts and, get this, cat wine!\n\nWhen our 4 PM slot rolled around, we were instructed to take off our shoes (socks are recommended but you can go barefoot as well), hang coats on the racks and step inside.  There was a brief introduction and orientation with some ground rules and notes (i.e. photos are ok as long as you don't use flash, there are four carafes with the different Japanese green teas so that you can refill at your leisure, but you can also order food and other drinks through the staff member in the room, etc.).  \n\nI realize that we picked a slot toward the end of the day and the cats were probably all tired of being gawked at.  Many seemed pretty apathetic and others annoyed at all the humans swarming inside.  I'm an introvert and I totally get it, lol, but it can be a little disappointing if you've come with expectations of getting to be around all these affectionate little furballs.    About ten minutes in, the staff member gives out a handful of cat treats to each person and all of a sudden cats start popping out of nowhere and mingling.  I ain't saying they're treat-diggers, but they ain't messing with you if you've got empty hands.  My friend and I were able to hold on to the treats for a while and handed them out one by one to various cats.  Try to lay your hand as flat as possible or you run the risk of getting nipped.  It's also better to show the cats your outstretched, empty palm anyway or some claws might come out as they try to see what you've got in your fist.  \n\nThe hour passed by all too quickly and before we knew it it was time to leave.  While there wasn't an overwhelming amount of interaction, the treats definitely helped us get some up-close attention that we might not have otherwise gotten (I've been to the Cat Town cafe in Oakland and wasn't nearly as successful in getting to interact with cats sans treats).  \n\nAll in all, I'd definitely come again to hang out with cats, sample their tea selection, and maybe even partake in a special event (\"cats on mats\" yoga, \"mew-vie\" nights).  \n\nIf you're allergic like I am and worried I'd recommend getting a Costco-sized portion of an over-the-counter antihistamine and you'll be all set!", "author": "Iona C."}

The only reason the cats were not kidnapped was because it would have been quite the fiasco having to ship them back to Chicago where we live.  Like I said, they should feel lucky that geography safeguarded their fluffies from us, kitty officionados.  Though we couldn't take the kittens with us, the hour we spent with them was the highlight of our vacation, if not our year...like, we are the definition of crazy cat people.\n\nIf you are a cat person and you like tea, then you need to get here to the Kittea Cafe right away.  There's about 10 different cats that you can play with, and though some are more anti-social than others, most are spunky and will nuzzle with you.  If you truly find yourself attached to one then it is possible to see if you can adopt he/she, though there are some cats that are long-term \"residents\".  You spend so much of the reserved hour playing with and adoring the cats that you almost forget aboutbthe bottomless tea that is a part of your reservation.  \n\nThere's 4 different bottomless tea that you can choose from, but then there's other tea and food you can order however, that's not included in your reservation.  My advice, don't order anything extra - you're already going to be overly involved with petting that cats, there's not enough time to pay attention to food.  Like I've been saying: each reservation you make lasts for an hour, and it's  $25 each hour.  Is it worth it, though?  Hell yeah.  Purrrr's before grrrrr's.  \n\nHmm, what else should I tell you about this purrrrrrfect establishment?  Well, you must take your shoes off to enter so if you don't want to be a barefooted feline, wear socks.  Also, the staff here will give you instructions on how to treat the cats - I know what it's like to get aggressive when petting the cats because they're so stinking cute, but you gotta try to control that.  The staff are very protective of the cats, as they should be.  There's plenty of items to buy from the Kittea Cafe - I would recommend that.

One is a cat play area behind a looking-glass. The cat play area has benches and tables where humans can get comfortable in the cat territory. :) In this room, you can eat, drink, and play with the cats. The other room is a caf\u00e9, located directly next to the cat play area so that you can watch the cat action but not get cat hair on you. In the caf\u00e9, they serve a few kinds of teas and coffees as well as waffles and sandwiches. There is also good wifi here.\n\nI was surprised that as a cat woman, I opted to not go in the cat play area. Unfortunately, the cost was pretty high at $25 for 1 hour with the cats, and a reservation was required. Perhaps it is because I have cats of my own at home, I did not desire to pay so much to play with some cats, even though they were so cute and lovable. Having paid $70 to adopt a cat of my own, $25 seemed like a hefty price tag for an hour with some cats. But if you don't have cats of your own, this price may be worth it to you.\n\nSo, I had some good tea and a waffle and sat down with my laptop to do some work. It was, overall, a very calming environment. Cats don't like to be startled so the environment is quite quiet, even in the cafe area. It is also nice to look at the cats while seated in the cafe. Of course, I'd have loved to pet them, but I wasn't wiling to pay the price. I do appreciate that KitTEA gives back and finds homes for many cats who need them.\n\nThe food was good, 4/5, and the setting was also good, 4/5. Go online and think about how much time you are willing to pay for to be in the company of some well-mannered cats. It definitely looked like good cat therapy, but I could not get behind it at that price point.", "author": "Chelsea S."}

Color me surprised that there are about sixty cat caf\u00e9s in Tokyo because this feels like such a giggly Harajuku thing. Two words: Hello Kitty. Besides, they all live in tubes over there or something not much bigger, so the idea of sipping tea and fondling a cat is most appealing to the workaholic and spaceaholic Japanese professional. Now San Francisco has one in Hayes Valley on the ground floor of a modern condo building. I came in on a Saturday at 3PM and found out they were fully booked until 8PM when they close. Hey, no whiskers off my nose since I'm allergic anyway. Did I mention it costs $25 for an hour of heavy petting?\n\nIt's five dollars less on weekdays, and they offer a Happy Meow'r (get it?) for $15 per hour on Thursdays 3-6PM. There are ten to fifteen cats, most less than a year old, who prance around indifferently in a large room with a long wooden bench, pillows, and all sorts of cat toys (photo: http://bit.ly/2nzjDC7). Ain't that precious? I could see them through the window quite easily, though the most entertaining part of the show are the humans who go to great lengths to cajole the cats into purring submission (photo: http://bit.ly/2nKIcwo). I was watching them through a large window on the tea house side where they serve paninis, waffles, soups and salads, and pastries.\n\nMe? I went for the $9 pot of Sencha Tea (photo: http://bit.ly/2mOGcEf), one of eight teas they serve along with matcha, cold brews, and Four Barrel coffee. As the most popular tea in Japan, sencha was described on the chalkboard menu as \"classic + grassy + clean\". Grassy? They make it sound like mulch when it's refreshingly mellow for a green tea since the leaves are not pulverized into the tea itself. I had plenty to sip in front of the window as the feline shenanigans played out in front of me with adoring cat lovers in thrall. Most of the people, staff included, were easily amused by the kitties. I was wondering what skinny young people did for fun since they obviously don't eat.

While the dude who worked there said there were 13 cats, there were only 4-5 in the main play area. The \"cat wrangler\" finally decided to give us treats to feed the cats 40 minutes into the hour, which drew out a few more kitties from their hidey holes, but we had already wasted a shit ton of time.\n\n2) The cats are exhausted. This is the case with most \"cat cafes.\" The cats are overstimulated and all they want to do at noon is sleep. Out of the 4-5 cats that were out and about, 2-3 of them were in little cage perches near the ceiling, so you can't even play with them if you wanted. You have to wait your turn and hope that the other guests are kind enough to not hog the cats. Otherwise you're sitting there twiddling your thumbs for 30 mins.\n\n3) Overpriced food/drinks - I don't blame the establishment for this. This is how they make money. The food/drinks are overpriced nonetheless.\n\n4) Strange fishbowl environment. The cafe consists of 2 sections. The cat play area, and the cafe.

There's no guarantee that a cat will end up sitting on your lap purring but they will definitely keep you entertained for an hour.  I had a scone and French press coffee. Both were excellent.

They have a bathroom inside where the tea area is in the cat area FYI when you go into the bathroom in the tea area the seat warms your butt took me by surprised when I sat down very clean in there. So if you like tea and you like to interact with cats here's two-for-one go to their web page Instagram Facebook Twitter check them out have a great time if you're following the kittenxlady you should definitely meet her and Andrew they are so awesome and she's will educate you or answer questions very friendly.", "author": "Lizzie G."}

Most cats are also up for adoption, so don't be afraid to fall in love!\nThe best advice I can give to those is to come during off hours (weekdays during HH). The biggest thing I had an issue with was that there were too many people in the kitty room at once. For about 10 cats there were about 10-12 other people in the room. As this would mean a cat per couple, some cats were actually sleeping or didn't want to be bothered. So I felt like we didn't get the full experience of being surrounded by cats as we lounged around.\n\nWhile you wait for your time slot, they invite you into the tea lounge to enjoy 4 free unlimited tea flavors. You can watch the cats play while finishing the refreshments. The actual kitty room had plenty of beds, toys, and lounging areas.

Cats and tea, along with some baked goodies.\n\nI came here first for a yoga + cats session, which is held in the evening on Wednesday. Purchase tickets in advance as they can only accommodate a certain number of participants. Your ticket also includes a hot tea of your choice, so come a little earlier to enjoy before the session. The yoga instructor was delightful and you practice in the room with the cats strolling around. One cat even jumped on someone's back! Overall highly entertaining and relaxing.\n\nThe second time I came in to do some work in the cafe portion, which there is a large glass window to peek inside the cat room. I found this enjoyable as I love people/cat watching as I typed away on my laptop. It's completely free to hangout in the cafe portion, which sometimes can get crowded when people come in before their session as it acts as the waiting room.\n\nThe hot teas are great. The ice cream waffle I got was rather sad. It came out with melted puddles of cream and it was a soggy sad mess. Maybe the other ones are better?\n\nThe cat room itself is rather small, like small bedroom. So you're awkwardly sitting in a room staring at each other. Also, their motto is now to keep resident cats, so most likely you will not see new ones next time (or have the ability to adopt). It's definitely a great start and I hope they can expand soon!", "author": "Minh N."}

It was an odd experience.\n\nLet me start by saying the staff is great. They were very nice and clearly care about the cats. \n\nIt is a small space and they let in way too many people at a time. The room was packed.\n\nIt seems they have a problem with some intense repeat customers. There were three different people in the room with us who seemed a bit off, obsessive and possessive of the cats. We learned very quickly that they come in all the time and they don't really want the cats to go near anyone else. Anytime a cat came near us, one of these repeat customers scared them away. Of course this isn't the staffs fault - I wish they had a way to fix this.\n\nEvery hour, they give customers treats for the cats - each person gets a handful - this is a terrible idea when the cats are aggressive. I watched many people get scratched badly, the food was distributed very unevenly and it isn't a fun or cute experience like you would think. \n\nAND- the cats aren't even adoptable? Isn't that the point of a cat cafe - to find homes for shelter cats? These cats live there full time to be poked and prodded at by strangers.  \n\nWe both left feeling uncomfortable with the experience.", "author": "Tiffany S."}

When I went to visit the kittens at KitTea Cafe. I first heard of this when I got back from Japan and was super stoked to check it out since I didn't get to visit any of the animal cafes in Japan. I love that they rescue cats from the kill shelter and then put this together so that they can be adopted. My friend and I came on a Saturday afternoon, and it was packed! We got to the cafe at 12 so that we could eat beforehand, and I'm glad we did, because even though you can bring your food and drink into the play area, there is no way you're going to want to \"waste\" your time eating when you could be playing with kittens. \n\nYou get unlimited green tea with your 1 hour visit, and you can actually switch between the 4 available types of teas. Awesome. We just went down the list, but never made it to #4. My friend got the heirloom tomato waffle and I got the grilled cheese sandwich. She enjoyed her waffle (the waffles smelled amazing) but I thought my sandwich was just ok. I wouldn't come here for the food, but it wasn't bad. \n\nWhen it came time to enter the play room, you have to take off your shoes and sanitize your hands, but then you pretty much have free roam of the place. It was so cute watching all the different cats - some were sleeping, 2 were cudding (omg I could not get enough of those two), some were super playful, some just did not want to be held. LOL.

Such a puuuuurfect combo (sorry for the cheesy joke) at KitTea Cafe!\n\nI've been to a few cat cafes but this one stands out as one of my favorites.  I love how there is a cafe waiting room in case you arrive early / want to sit around after your one-hr time slot to just get a view of the glory of the cats.  Certain teas are free when you book an appointment- I got the genmaicha (green tea with roasted mochi rice); this one is on the stronger side but I love stronger tasting green tea.  Didn't try the waffles but another time I visited I had the matcha tea- so strong in flavor but not too bitter, this matcha is up there with other matcha teas I've tasted.\n\nIf you don't want to play with the cats but just watch them, you are welcome to just sit and order tea (you'll have to pay for it)- I've done work by the counter while sitting tea and watching cats and it surprisingly was a pleasant experience too.\n\nMost of the cats were super friendly- there were a lot of times where they wouldn't react too much if someone picked them up while they were sleeping (I feel bad about doing this, but food for thought).  They are usually cooperative and will let you hold them for a bit of time until they squirm away.  \n\nStaff were very engaging explaining each of the personalities of the cats, cat training / handling in general, or other random topics!  You can tell that they cared a lot for the cats in the cafe (and I've been to a few cat cafes where that was questionable).  \n\nTips:\n- Bring socks!  You can buy at the shop too if you forget (though you don't have to wear it), but the floors can get cold so keep that in mind if your feet easily get cold\n- Come at a non-busy hour- the staff noted that there was a birthday party a few hours ahead of our time slot and therefore some of the cats were sleeping / wanted some solitude.  I suspect that the cats would be more awake if you came when there wasn't any big event like this, so might help to call ahead of time if you are really looking to playing with cats\n- These are cats- they have their own personalities and own little lives and therefore might not be as cooperative as you want them to.  Most of the cats are pretty mellow and will allow you to pick them up, but don't hope to be able to pick up and coddle with every single one.\n\nIf you like cats and just want an hour (or more) to get your endorphins going, I'd suggest coming here.

I thought it would be more of a relaxed sort of \"bookstore with cats\" environment. I imagined languid but friendly cats and a private table with a mug of something warm and other humans a good 10-15 feet away. I thought the cats would just be cats and the humans would be chill, willing to give pets and cuddles as cats wished to accept them, laps welcoming to not insisting. \n\nHumans are the worst. I didn't expect for there to be so many other humans sharing my KitTea cat time in such a relatively small space -- probably 12 or so, a ratio of about one person to one cat. I didn't expect these people to be so \"KITTY!!!!\" I didn't expect people to be so insistent on playing and petting to the point they were almost grabby-handed toddlers. \n\nPerhaps the cats are used to this behavior. They seemed entirely unconcerned and rather disinterested in affection -- not the aloofness we love about cats but rather a sort of overstimulation such that the human visitors weren't anything special. There was no bonding. Their interest was in food. \n\nAs for food, there's little by way of \"cafe.\" There are some munchies and tea and coffee, but don't expect to relax away with finger sandwiches, cream br\u00fbl\u00e9e and Whiskers by your side. \n\nAll these things said, the tiny gift selection is cute and well done. Staff members are kind. The cats appear well cared for. Everything is neat and tidy. If you could book out the space entirely for two hours with 8 or fewer of your good, chill friends, and watch a movie or work a puzzle or do yoga, you'd totally enjoy it. It would be swell to see the cats rotated throughout the day for play time/quiet time. \n\nThere's so much potential here! Here's hoping to a long future.", "author": "Sarah K."}

Regardless of your opinions about zoos, I know how to handle animals, but I also understand the feelings of the caretakers behind-the-scenes.\n\nThe cats were chill, but definitely not the most playful. It does suck that I paid $20 for literally just petting cats for an hour, but I get respecting the animal and I was petting cats for an hour. This is something most patrons of, for lack of a less negative word, animal entertainment places feel upset about. The humans are not able to make sure an animal reciprocates the love and attention you are giving it, so please do not blame the business, caretakers, or cats.  \n\nI wonder if they rotate the cats. The cats seemed to come and go as they please to the back and a few stayed there. To echo a previous review, I did witness some fellow customers not understanding the cats are not just for their entertainment. I was also under the assumption that it would be a \" 'bookstore with cats.' \" I wish supervision was better enforced like, \"Hey, sorry, but Steve (one of the cat's names) isn't feeling it right now. Would you like to give your attention to another one of our cats?\" Besides that, the cats looked well cared for. \n\nSpeaking of the people, the guy was nice.\n\nThe place was cramped which I did not like. I hope that in the future, they can acquire a bigger facility, which means more cats! Hopefully, the same number of people admitted each session with maybe 1-2 additional spaces. \n\nHowever, after this experience, I am seriously considering getting a cat in addition to a dog when I live not at home. A cat is like a child you can depend on to be independent and you don't have to spend a lot of time and energy and attention on them, not that I mind devoting that to dogs, but there's a sense of relief with that. \n\nOh! Before I forget, food! The food was okay. I wasn't a big fan of their tea selection. Nothing wrong with it, but I am the girl who doesn't like sushi, green tea, or seaweed which are all common likes amongst people. Their grilled cheese was pretty tasty. I loved the gooeyness. Their calico Belgian waffle was okay. Nothing special, but not terrible. \n\nTLDR:\n- People can be buttheads. Please be understanding. \n- Cramped. \n- I wish they could be more transparent. They are open to questions, I just felt they should've been obvious/answered. \n- The food was okay. \n- They have one of those Japanese heated toilet seats.\n- Is it worth $20 or $25? Eeehhh.

If you're into hanging out with cats that do cat things like nap and lay there then this is most definitely the place for you.", "author": "Navdeep D."}

The cost was $25 per person with unlimited green tea. I arrived around 30 minutes early because I thought I would have to search for street parking but easily found a free parking spot in front of Minas Brazilian Restaurant and arrived 20 minutes early. \n\nThe cafe area is separate from the cat area which I thought was sanitary. I had a cup of green tea while I waited. There was a choice of 4 different types. My favorite of the two that I tried was the Sencha. This was my first cat cafe visit and I wanted the cats to like me so I YouTubed some Jackson Galaxy videos the night before in preparation. I took care of my neighbor's cats while they went on vacation when I was younger and have always loved cats. I found out that I've been petting cats wrong my whole life! Apparently, the best place to pet cats is by rubbing their cheeks/chin and petting the back of their neck/on top of their head. The cats were so adorable! I wanted to take a few of them home but I can't because my apartment doesn't allow pets. Who knew petting cats could be so therapeutic?", "author": "Karen L."}

You must go here! \n\nThis place rescues cats at risk for euthanasia and gives them a new lease on life. You can reserve one hours worth of time in the cat lounge where cats roam freely. You can play, pet, or simply watch their antics while sipping on delicious tea and food. The reservation comes with bottomless tea, food is extra.  Beware of hungry cats, they WILL try to steal away your food if you aren't paying attention. \n\nI recommend coming 45 minutes before your reservation, and eating at the cafe. This maximizes your one hour time limit in the cat lounge. When I went there, they were out of bubble waffles, but their regular waffles are exceptional. The tea is no joke, extremely high quality, and brewed at just right temperature to ensure a smooth flavor. As a tea fanatic and connoseur, I was pleasantly surprised. The Sencha had no bitterness to it, and the kikucha had just the right balance of leafy astringency to bitterness. I will definitely be coming back.", "author": "Chris R."}

I was also surprised to learn that there were no kittens for adoption--which I thought was a great reason to pay for the experience (help cats get adopted). \n\nHowever, the cats we played with were rescued and now are the resident cats at Kittea and seem well cared for.

Kit Tea is one part tea house, one part cat adoption center, and one part gift shop, and all parts are awesome.\n\nFor the best experience, make an appointment ahead of time, ideally in the morning when the cats are more active. A weekday 11am was a good time for me and a friend to go, and we were part of a group of about eight, which is a good number for the play room.\n\nCheck in for your appointment, then grab a pot of tea while you wait- one is included with your visit. You'll get a solid hour of cat play time, complete with various toys. There were about 12 cats on site when we went, and most interacted with us in some way- coming close for a snuggle, sitting on laps, chasing laser pointers, fetching mouse toys, and even trying to hide in our purse and coat!\n\nIf you bond with a cat, you look into taking them home with you- all of the featured kitties are available for adoption, sourced from local organizations and selected based on how well socialized they are. The funds collected here go directly to support them. Location is exceptionally clean, cats very social, and staff we interacted with were very friendly and polite.

Unfortunately, we were underwhelmed with the experience and came out disappointed. \n\nThis cafe charges $25 an hour per person on the weekends. The $25 comes with unlimited green tea, but no specialty drinks or food. We didn't try any of the food, but the unlimited green tea was high quality and really good. \n\nOur main problem was with the quality and quantity of the cats. In all the promotional pictures they post, it looks like there are at least 10+ cats that are all social and energetic. During my visit, however, there were really only 3 cats awake and most of them didn't want to be touched or played with. They were all completely bored of the toys, and we weren't allowed to give them treats either, so there was no way to excite or stimulate them. Also, it gets really awkward when there are 10 people in the tiny room crowding around so few cats, and there are more people staring at you through a glass wall.\n\nI'm not angry with the cats, but I am confused by why the ownership/management would choose cats that aren't social to be in a cat cafe. And if the cats were social to begin with and then grew tired of human interaction, then the management should take that into consideration and have more or alternating cats. They even had a cat that was 15 yrs old and super frail, which no one was allowed to wake or pick up. Why have her in there at all if she's so weak? \n\nOverall, this place is not worth the visit. Maybe I could argue their case if everyday was priced like Thursdays, when it's $15/hr, but save your money and go pet some cats at your local shelter instead. They'd appreciate it more.", "author": "Winna P."}

I booked it for today because (1) We needed a fun thing to do today (2) They were donating to help cats/dogs affected by the hurricane in Texas. (3) I LOVE cats. \n\n      Just as the website shows, KitTea Cat Caf\u00e9 is very cute, clean, and fun. The staff were all very welcoming and our \"cat wrangler\" worked hard to make sure we enjoyed our hour with the cats in the lounge, while keeping the cats safe and happy. She told us the rules without being too strict, and even brought out a bowl of treats for us to let the cats eat out of our hands! That was interesting, some got a bit \"nippy\" but she warned us about that. I was happy that all of the cats were up and ready to play and/or hang out for some petting. We were there at 12:00 at opening time. \n\n           We enjoyed the complimentary green tea, and ordered free refills twice -ha. We skipped the food, as we planned to go out for a special lunch for our anniversary. I just HAD to buy something in their super cute shop before leaving - so I chose lavender cat drink coasters and a few stickers. I love all things kitty. Meow meow. \n\n          I would give it five stars, but I got injured when a fast moving cat ran by me and scratched my arms, and it bled, so our \"wrangler\" got out a first aid kit and gave me some ointment and a band aid. I asked for another one a bit later. I do not hold them accountable for this, as I am well aware of the risks associated with being around cats, and I in fact, used to be a volunteer cat cuddler for a few years, including another Bay area cat caf\u00e9, so I know the drill. The cat wasn't trying to hurt me, he was just running away from another cat to get up high on the shelf. I speak CAT. I would be happy to go back another time, perhaps for MEWVIE Night. I love the sense of kitty humor at this place! So cute. \n\n           So glad we came here today. It made our Anniversary day a bit furrier and adorable. I also appreciated the cat therapy, so to speak. Thank you to the KitTea team for being so friendly and helpful, and the owner for donating to Austin Pets Alive today.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-20", "description": "I remember reading an article that Japan had some cat cafes with just the customers interacting with the cats and drinking coffee / tea. So I've always been so curious about it. Now it's about time that I checked it out. In San Francisco. LOL. Yay. There's one at CA. Woot woot! So if you're thinking of making reservations for an hour time slot to play with the kitties in the room, you have to come in person to make a reservation and pay for it. It's about $25 to reserve a spot. It's based on first-come first serve basis. You can't make phone calls to make it. You have to step into there in person. Normally, when you step into the entrance, you will see some cute cat merchandise with the check-in desk along the cashier person. If you want to spend time with the kitties, you need to request for an appointment. They would tell you the availibility for a certain time slot that you can pick from. So you have the option to wait and enjoy your time at the awesome japanese cafe, drinking lovely tea or other type of drinks; or you can go out somewhere while you're waiting for your appointment time. They normally ask you for your phone number if anything comes up regarding your appointment time. \n\nAnyway, I made the option to try out the tea at the japanese cafe. It's abit petite, but cute. They have a restroom, that says \"whichever.\" Quite creative with the words haha. There was an area where there's a clear glass window for customers to look at the kitties from the cafe. Quite entertaining to watch, yes. They also have wifi and the password is generally on a piece of handwritten paper, on the front of the desk that the cashier takes orders. I was craving for matcha, so I decided to try some. It was rather interesting to watch the waitress make the matcha tea the proper japanese way. It tasted so good. They served it in a big mug. I can bring in my tea into the kitty room, but I rather drink it before that because you'll never know what the kitties are gonna do lol. \n\nThen it was time to enter the kitty room! There were about 5-8 people for a slot in just one kitty room, I think. Idk. So we were greeted by the \"kitty sensei master\" who was telling us proper guidelines when interacting with the kitties and the do-not's. So when the kitties are resting, leave them be :) They need to recharge! Of course, sanitize your hands before playing with the kitties. You wanna keep the kitties safe from the outside germs on your hands xD There were few black cats and orange cats. They were so cute! There was black / white fur one with one eye, so be warned that that one may be alittle rough and aggressive.. haha. But I felt like most of the time, they cared only about the food. Pretty much.. So if you have some cat food that you purchased earlier at the entrance check-in desk, they will most likely go to you. Sometimes, the kitty sensei will give me some cat food to give to the cats, so I thought it was nice of him to do that. So I can get the feel what's it like to experience the cat fun. The kitty room consisted of kitty play materials. There's also a one person restroom, which you shouldn't allow cats inside lol. The toilet looked Japanese style. It was fun playing with the cats and other people. But I just kinda wished the cats were actually genuinely caring and not all about the food. Hmmm.. it's okay.

I did the Cat Lounge, and this activity allows you to spend 1 hour in a room of cats. The cats come from a local cat adoption agency called Wonder Cat Rescue, and are definitely up for the adoption here. Service here was super friendly and knowledgeable. Also the decorations of the place was on point. Hand sanitizer is provided for your cleanly needs. Also incase you've haven't tried one before, the toilet in the bathroom is one of those Japanese butt spraying toilets or an \"Electronic Bidet.\"\n\nAll the teas were flavorful and very well brewed. \nDrinks I tried were the green teas: Sencha, Genmaicha, and Hojicha.\n1) Sencha - It tasted like ordinary green tea.

But I saw people in there that were barefoot, kinda gross. However, the staff was friendly and the cat wrangler guy was really cool. The cats were all asleep when we got there, which is understandable because that is what cats do. The cats that were there were mostly adult cats who wanted to be left alone. Don't expect a bunch of hyper and playful kittens. I am okay with that personally, but don't be shocked if you visit and only get to pet a few sleeping cats. The cat room was very clean and the cats looked healthy and well cared for. I wish there wasn't so many people in there at the same time with the cats. There were about 10 people and only 7 cats around- only 2 cats were awake and walking around. Majority of the cats are resident cats- with two being up for adoption at any given time. I appreciate that they are helping homeless cats get adopted!\n\nOverall- great idea, but overpriced for what it is. If you go, consider that your money may be going to a cat being adopted. That made it worth it to me. \n\nOh, and the tea was good.", "author": "Samantha M."}

KitTea is a very structured system.  The price of admission ($20 on weekdays, $25 on weekends plus a $1 booking fee if you book online which does not apply if you book over phone or walk in) gets you a 1 hour time slot in the cat lounge with unlimited green tea.  They have an impressive selection probably because they are influenced by the Japanese style cat cafes including Kukicha, Hojichasun, Sencha, and Genmaicha green teas.  They even have ceremonial matcha tea which is extra.   They serve food and other drinks as well.  1 hour for the price seems like a lot but it can get tiring after a while playing with cats non- stop so I think it's worth it.\n\nThere is a 'cat wrangler' in the lounge who make sure everything is in order as well as taking food and drink orders however they cannot technically serve the food since it's goes against health codes because they are working with animals so you pick it up outside the cat lounge.  \nThere are cushions for the cats, shelfs for them to jump on, books about cats, and some toys for guests to engage and play with the cats.  Outside the cat lounge is a little caf\u00e9 where you can go without paying the entrance fee if you just wanted to observe some furry felines.  \n\nOne of the things I randomly loved the best was the warm Japanese style Japanese toilet seats!   I haven't seen one since I was in Japan years ago and that was one of the best things I remembered about being in Japan.\n\nFor me this is 5 stars because I love cats so much!  And ceremonial matcha tea.  And warm toilet seats.  For others I think it might be just okay if you aren't that into cats.", "author": "Joan W."}

My coworkers are also fans of cats so we planned in advance to check it out together and celebrate our friend getting into graduate school.  One of our coworkers had two other friends who had wanted to check the place out so I said they were welcome to get a spot if they wanted to come at the same time we did.  One of these friends was even on the waiting list until an hour before our reservation.  We went and were excited to see some cats and maybe even some adoptable cats (two of my coworkers had been thinking about it).  Over all we had a great time with the cats, and the staff was courteous.  We did find out toward the end that none of the cats were up for adoption, which was disappointing and not clearly stated.  \n\nAt the very end, though, our party was singled out as we had broken the over 7 party policy because, as the front desk attendant stated \"You obviously had 9.\"  She declared she would have to tell her manager.  Without any request for explanation or anything, I was left to stand awkwardly until I had a chance to ask if she wanted me to talk to the manager now...or if they would be in touch...to which she said, \"No, my manager isn't here.  He'll email you.\"  It really ruined our enjoyment of the activity.\n\nWell...five days later I received an email declaring we had broken the rule for 7 people without request for explanation declaring we had ruined the experience for two other visitors because we were a large group, even though one of my coworkers and her friend had chatted with these visitors and enjoyed petting cats together.  \n\nI responded that I did not realize it was considered a party if some people in your group happened to know the other people who scheduled to come at the same day and hour.  I suppose I should have declared that her friends were not welcome to come at the same time or else we would all be charged the price of a whole party except I didn't realize that's how this rule would be interpreted.  \n\nThat day I had texted a picture of my time at the cafe to one of my bridesmaids who is coming into town for my bachelorette party.  She asked if we should go there with everybody, which would actually be a booked party, ironically right as I was being chastised.  So no, I will not be booking a bachelorette weekend at KitTea Cafe. I will not be bringing anyone else to KitTea Cafe because of how they handled this situation and I will not be returning myself or referring anyone else to come.  They don't have explicit policies on groups or adoption, they are ridiculously over priced, and they are incredibly rude.  I had a good time and then I didn't.

My boyfriend took me here as a treat for our 7 year anniversary. As a tea cafe, gift shop, cat adoption/kitty cuddle center, it's as good as it gets! I lost my furbaby Apollo last year and still haven't been able to get over it. This place definitely provided the fluff therapy I needed since I don't think I'm ready to have another cat yet (got a bunch of ferals that I feed outside my house though). \n\nIt's $25 for a full hour to play with the kitties with a free cup of tea; best to make an appointment ahead of time just in case. All the kitties are adoptable so it's alright if you fall in love with one and want to take it home. Socks are a must to go into the room but you can always purchase an adorable pair of kitty socks if you didn't bring any. In the kitty room, it's kitty heaven, for me and the kitties. There are high and low places for them to hide/lounge. Toys and treats were everywhere for the kitties, a much better place for them than the shelter (and a better chance for them to get adopted being able to have interaction with people). A \"Cat Tail Speak\" reference was provided to assist with figuring the kitties' moods. Despite someone getting swiped at by a kitty that's ready for her forever home (was already adopted), all of them were just precious. \n\nAs for the tea that I tried, Green Hojicha, it had a wonderful earthly taste and did wonders for my sniffles. I am allergic to cats but yet I love them so much and will suffer the allergies to cuddle them. Staff there was very friendly and so sweet with the kitties. The place was very clean, even cleaner than most places without animals; I was even willing to walk into the restroom inside the kitty room without my shoes. I'm glad that there were humidifies throughout the place, it definitely helped my allergies a little bit.\n\nFinal Thoughts: I left here with my allergies full blown and heart warmed with kitty cuddles.

That being, the food and tea is a tad pricey (though many teas are free and bottomless with a reservation!). Primarily, I think the focus should be on the cats. This is an adoption-oriented place, and the workers are focused on helping you get to know the cats, at which I think they do a great job. Furthermore, the cost of reservations/appointments and the food, I assume, goes toward the facilities. It's San Francisco, which isn't cheap, and it is a beautiful facility; I personally think it's an incredible cause to house cats during the day in a clean, spacious area while allowing a limited number of people to come in and interact with them. \n\nFirst and foremost, the people who visit KitTea should be people who understand cats- cats are NOT dogs. Yes, these cats are friendly and adorable and wonderful, but they're still not dogs. You have to approach them, and don't complain that the cats are often sleeping.

I did notice a few people stayed exclusively in one spot on the floor which I found inconsiderate. \n\nNext time I go, I will try for mid-week or later in the day on a weekend and see if there are less people there (which could mean even more cat attention)!", "author": "Irina R."}

When we came in we were greeted with a welcoming hello, which was nice since it was our first time, and the front desk told us how everything worked and had us in the tea lounge while we wait for our turn in the cat lounge. The cat lounge reserved online is $20/person with an unlimited amount of their green teas. As we got into the cat lounge, we were introduced to the cat wrangler (i forgot her name. sorry!) who continued the process with how to treat the cats, and food/drinks info. She always checked in on us asking if we wanted any food or tea, and if anyone had questions, she was very knowledgeable. Okay, time for the part people want to actually know about: the cats.\n\nThey are the most adorable and the most friendly cats I've met. There were about 16 today, and most were sleeping at first but about the 2nd half hour they started playing with us a lot more. I guess if you smell like dog they wont really try to play with you since only 1/3 of us were successful in attracting the cats. Nonetheless, they were really playful and energetic. One cat even hopped on my lap and smothered its face in my jacket! So cute! \n\nDespite it being quite pricey, it's well worth it. The employees and cats are all friendly in quiet and bright environment. The tea was delicious and the merch is adorable too (if you're willing to pay extra). They also have other event like Yoga with Cats and Mewvie night! So, whether you're looking to adopt or to just hang around the cats, definitely look into this place.", "author": "Yvonne N."}

The cafe and the cat area are two different places. The only reason it is called cat cafe is because you can  order food when you get inside of the cat room . \nIn order to get into the cat room, you have to make a reservation (walk ins are hard) and pay a $25 / hr fee . This comes with a pot of tea tho and some of the money goes towards animal shelters (I believe) .\n\nAnyways , do not expect to have the right to pet the cats just because you eat and drink there.\n\nI wouldn't recommend anyone going there just for the food. \n\nBut it's a cute idea overall!", "author": "Li S."}

The only reason I gave 3 stars is because the cats didn't seem to want anything to do with us 75% of the time. That is, until the \"cat wrangler\" brought out handfuls of food for everyone. However, after the food was gone, the cats went back to doing their own thing. Now, I understand that we can't force the cats to give us attention, I think a little downtime for the cats would be appropriate. We had a 12 reservation, and there were groups coming and going before and after us. These cats were getting non-stop attention, which I understand to be slightly overstimulating and exhausting for them. Also, it was a pretty expensive little outing considering that the only thing the $25 pays for us cats and tea. Overall, the experience was fun and it was just nice to be in their presence!

I also thought it was a very Asian thing to do...but to my surprise, we were the only Asians in there!! Workers and other customers! We booked an hour with the cats, not knowing what to expect.  All I knew was: free refills on tea and there are cats.  It really is one of those things that just makes sense when you get there and see it for yourself.\n\nThere are two separate rooms, one has the cats and the other is just a cafe.  If you are in the cat room, you can order food and enjoy it there.  If you are on the cafe side, there aren't any cats but you can watch them through the glass wall.  I was reluctant about getting cat hair in my food and tea, but the room is kept very clean and there was no fur in my drank.  Impressive, given that there were over 10 cats in there.  I got  genmaicha- always my fav, and sencha- on the bitter side.  I should've tried the others but I got distracted with the cats.  \n\nIf you are in the market to adopt a cat, this would be a good place to check out!  All these cats are up for adoption and are being rehabilitated to go to good homes.  There's a cat wrangler in the room who keeps things in line, but for overall, the cats were well behaved.  I particularly like the mellow cat (Harvey!), but the interactive kitties are really cute to play with too. \n\nPro-tips:\n*Get there at noon when they open so the cats are refreshed and ready to play, plus it's not as crowded\n*I was afraid my clothes were gonna be furry or shredded, so I thought high waisted jeans (no crack cleavage!) were the way to go.  In reality, the cats didn't sit on me so I had no scratches or fur problems. Comfy, functional clothes will do. \n*Check out the bathroom.  The toilet has a bidet.\n\nI am not that big of a cat person, but I do love animals.  It still ended up being therapeutic and enjoyable.

It is clean, well managed and is tailored to delight any feline-o-phile! \n\nThe cats are obviously showered with attention and the space is tranquil and kitty friendly.  To actually tea with the kitties, you must make a reservation and pay an entrance fee that is based on time (half hour is the lowest increment of time with the next increment being an hour)  either online or the phone.  Walk-ins are welcome, but depending upon current occupancy, entrance is not guaranteed.  \n\nTea is included in the full-hour package but not in the half hour package.  Prices are listed clearly on the website.  There is also seating outside of the kitty room if occupancy is full,  which allows guests to tea without cover charge and watch the kitties frolick with humans.\n\nYet, what's the fun in being a voyeur?

That's how they lure ya in!! We made a reservation for 7-8pm which came out to be $52 for 2 people. You might think, \"YOU GOTTA BE KITTEN ME (lol get it)?\" when you're asked to pay that much to drink tea and pet kittens. My roommate has a cat at my apartment so if you ask why we paid that much.. it's because I'm all for new experiences so why the heck not? \n\nWe checked in right before our reservation and waited for the previous session to finish up cuddling up with the kittens. The price we paid included an hour with the kittens and complimentary tea. There were only three green tea flavors that were included, but there were plenty of other things on the menu to try as well. We waited in the cafe area until it was our turn to go in. We were asked to take off our shoes before we entered and sanitized our hands. There were about 12 people total in the room and maybe 8-10 cats roaming around. There was also one instructor inside to make sure all the kittens were being treated properly and to answer any questions. My favorite kitten was Pocket just because she was so small and cute!! She was sleepy when we first got here and wouldn't budge, but suddenly jumped up with energy and ran away after a while! All the cats seemed very calm, probably because we came at the end of the day and they were tired from the all day long human interactions. There was a tiny room you could enter where there were two small kittens who weren't ready to be with the other kittens. They were still young and not ready for that kinda exposure yet. They were adorable! \n\nCool concept, but something I'd only try once just because I'm not a huge cat lover. Not sure if they have any other cafes like this in the area, but it would be great if they had a puppy cafe.. I know that Seoul has tons of animal cafes (raccoons, sheep, puppy, etc..).

Whether you are looking for a good cup of tea in a room full of cat, or you are looking to adopt a cat in a safe environment, or both! You will definitely enjoy this establishment.\nTo visit the cat area, I made a reservation through their website. Weekend is slightly more expensive than weekdays. It includes an hour to play with the cats, and bottomless green tea (other drinks and food will cost extra). If you arrive the area early, I do recommend to visit their lounge. You can get you food and/or drink first, also sit next to the huge window which faces the cat area. Once it's your time, they will ask you to take off the shoes and coat, and head into the cat room. Once inside, they will introduce you to the cats, also which ones are available to adopt.\nWe spent the first 30 minutes taking pictures of the cat, tried to pet and play with each one. All of them are very good with human, but not to each other cats. You can see how they become territorial after a while, especially the new comer.\n\nOverall was a fun experience. 30 bucks per person for weekend is a bit steep.

Yes, prices are high, but so is everything in San Francisco, so if you're here from out of town just know their prices are fair, especially for handmade merchandise. The tea & waffle I ordered were great! The cold brew, not so much. It was poorly filtered & tasted sandy and I don't think they dilute it, it was darker than space and so strong my hands were shaking after half a cup! \n\nCats are about as you'd expect, they're cats. However, the experience with these cats was different from my experience at Cat Town - These cats were JUNKIES for treats and seemed to be interested in nothing else. They quickly flocked to customers who had purchased treats before entering. It was cute that they'd jump up on you and eat out of your hands and lick your fingers, but none of them were receptive to petting except one or two who were asleep. Even a little ear skritch! Cats are like that but this felt like being scammed by a bunch of four-legged fuzzballs who were only in it for the tuna. Treats are a good way to get a cat's attention but it made me a little sad that that was all they seemed to care about. :( They also could use a better selection of toys, the cats didn't seem too interested in anything that didn't move and most of the toys were stuffed mice and the like. \n\nIn any case, I will probably go back but I will have lower hopes for kitty interactions next time.

It's a small space, but they're able to make it manageable. The tea and food menu is well thought out and gourmet. It's a great concept, obviously. Even if you aren't there for a cat room appointment, there's plenty to eat and drink and see the cats through the window.\n\nThis paragraph is really more suggestions for the staff, not a reflection of recommending spending your money to go. If you like tea, food and cats, then this is the place to go. There's just a couple of things I think they might want to adjust. First, there should be a few more cats. That's an easy fix. Also, there are ways to curate a cat selection to find cats that are more calm and personable. Cat adoption places, for example, are able to find cats that are particularly good with other cats. Or good with children. Lap cats, etc. The cats here are sweet, but they are a little hyper. I mean, look, they're cats, I get it, they're not easy to coral. They do what they want. But, you know, ideally. Also, the employee is a nice enough person, but I don't think they need to be hyping up the cats so much, and talking so much and so loudly, and sharing so much other stuff on their phone. Just let the guests experience the room, and maybe blend into the background a little. Be seen, not heard. Take orders when asked, which is a great feature, by the way.\n\nI do recommend KitTea, despite some of the suggestions above. So don't let that dissuade you. It's really more suggestions to the owners in general to help them make the place even better. So, in short, it's a solid, interesting experience. Certainly unique and worth the price for the different type of experience and the food and tea. So, again, if you like cats, tea, waffles, and more, KitTea is recommended, highly.", "author": "Rob F."}

It's very well-lit and modern but still cozy. There's a wide variety of cat-themed books and knick knacks to browse through while you're checking in or waiting, as well. KitTea has a small caf\u00e9 adjacent to their cat room where you can hang out and watch some playful and dozing kitties through a large window, as well as grab a bite and some great tea, without a reservation. Small succulents in hammered copper pots rest on each table. \n\nTheir green teas are complimentary with your reservation in the cat room, and their genmaicha was delightful. It was earthy and deep but not overly grassy like some green teas. Food can be eaten in the cat room as well as the caf\u00e9, you just have to carry it in. I can't comment on the taste of the food, since I wasn't hungry at the time. Someone next to me ordered one of their waffles, and it looked delicious, if you can eat it. They did have a vegan salad on their menu that sounded surprisingly filling.\n\nI love the fact that all of the cats are up for adoption, so your visit helps further socialize them. There's also another room attached to the kitty room with a cat door where the cats can go if they get overwhelmed.

Finally, SF now has its first and only cat cafe to satisfy people's sudden urge to play with kittens and to test whether they are ready to adopt.\n\nWhile it was fun coming in for a full hour, I was pretty disappointed with the cat to human ratio in the room. I came in late in the afternoon and majority of the cats appeared to be exhausted. Most were sleeping and absolutely did not want to be bothered. I feel as though coming here, I spent most of my time sitting around waiting for the next available cat or chasing after them, since the number of cats wasn't proportionate to the group.\n\nAlso, I find the rate of $25 for per hour with cats a bit overpriced so I probably won't be back.\n\nOn another note, the staff here and the bottomless tea was okay, the bathroom (and facility in general) is very clean and the decor of the cafe is modern.\n\nThough they accepted drop ins when we were there, I suggest that you make a reservation in advance to ensure availability.", "author": "Jasmin H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-13", "description": "I had no idea until recently that there was actually a cat cafe in San Francisco. The place is kept very clean (especially the cat room itself), and the best way to see the cats is to book a reservation in advance on their website, as space is limited and only a small number of people per time slot are allowed at a time.\n\n$20-25 for an hour with the cats is asking quite a bit, but considering what you also get, I suppose it's worth it in the end. Complementary tea is included with your reservation. There are also other food and tea items for sale, which I thought was too expensive. Also, if you order any tea or food, the staff won't be able to serve it to you directly and this is in order to comply with food safety regulations. You are allowed to step right outside the cat room and then bring the tea and food from the cafe in with you.\n\nPractically all of these cats are up for adoption through Wonder Cat Rescue; no same-day adoptions are available. These same cats must get a lot of human attention and petting each day. Even if some of the cats are sleeping, you can still pet them. Overall, something I'd recommend if you really love cats (and aren't able to have one of your own at home).", "author": "Paul N."}

We had made a reservation ahead of our visit (needed) which included unlimited green tea and a visit with some amazing cats for one hour. \nThey do offer four varieties of green tea to choose from which is nice! The cafe also offers some sweet offerings like waffles, but we discovered it's smart to order those ahead when reserving if you want to partake. \nWhile enjoying our tea in the cafe we were able to enjoy watching the group ahead of us play with the cats through the large window between the cat lounge and tea lounge. \nOnce our designated time came it was all cats! The hour went by in a flash. Our cat wrangler (I've forgotten his name, we'll call him \"G\") was amazing! Energetic, informative and engaging, he introduced us to the cats (there were six on our day) and made sure we were had everything we needed to have a great time. \nThis cafe is doing great work for animals! They have found forever homes for over 160 cats to date! G let us know that they are very careful with adoptions and take time to make a right match. There is no meeting a cat on day one and taking it home that very day. Adoption is a process here. \nWhether looking to adopt, or just want a fun and unique new experience when visiting SF, I think everyone should visit the Kit Tea cafe!\n\nPRO TIPS: \nWear comfy shoes that can easily come off (socks only in the cat lounge)\nMake a reservation \nIf you want to eat, order ahead while reserving", "author": "Scott M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-21", "description": "Who on earth thought of a concept like this? I think it was someone in Japan, or so I've heard. I admit, it's fantastic, but it's kind of unusual. In a nutshell, you make an appointment to pay to play with kittens and drink tea, hence the name, KitTea.\n\nMy friend and I had just finished lunch and I had a sudden urge to play with kittens. Damage control (in case my cat reads this): I house one of the best cats in the world, Wilson \"Danger\" the Cat, a full-grown Snowshoe with the best personality and cutest face, who I love dearly, and who smothers me with affection, climbs on my shoulders, and wants little more than to cuddle with me, my roommates, and anyone who comes over (he's a lover). But still, it's sometimes fun to have baby cats to hang around with. \n\nSo upon my saying that kittens are adorable and I want to rub their little kitty tummies on my face, my pal remarks that there's a spot in Hayes Valley that can make my dreams of kitten playtime come true! So we head over, check in, choose our teas, and are let into the clean, Ikea-esque room with full windows looking out onto the street so passersby can get a glimpse of what they're missing out on. There were 15 kittens in the room, yes folks, real, baby kittens, some bigger than others, but all were still in the category of \"kitten\", mostly sleeping, playing with toys, lounging in the sun, walking on a giant cat wheel (like a hamster wheel for cats), and doing general kitten things.\n\nOne of the people who works there stayed with us in the room the whole time like a mediator which I thought was kind of weird, but then I thought they probably have to sit there to ensure that crazy people don't steal these adorable little fur balls who would fit just perfectly into my purse. Wait what? I kid, I kid. Actually KitTea is like a really expensive SPCA where folks can go have kitty time and decide if they're ready to adopt a little furry friend. If you're at that point, just do it. Cats are awesome pets and I hope you get one with as great a personality as my young friend Wilson who is currently rolled on his back with his soft underbelly being warmed by my laptop.

There were about 13 cats at the time being but some of them were sleeping I think so we ended up playing with only 8-10 I'd say. We went for Friday movie night so they closed down the store for the movie. Definitely reserve online if you wanna come in to enjoy these crazy cats. I'm gonna be honest and say although the movie was playing, I was so distracted by the kitties that I didn't even bother watching the movie lol you can play with them, pet them, chase them down, and just be a total weirdo with them.\n\nThe only thing bad I have to say about this place is the chai tea...extremely strong and will knock you out after about 3 cups or so...I was getting woozy and was about to fall asleep lol oh and another bad thing is this place is very expensive during movie nights or any type of activity nights...our reservation for 2 during movie night came out to be $100 with an order of tea and it was for 2 hours.

Even the people who ordered them didn't seem into it, which idk if that was bc it wasn't good, or because they were just bored. \n\nThe boredom comes from the lack of cat activity. Most of the cats were asleep, and the ones that were awake didn't want to be touched at all! They weren't friendly, and even tried to bite people who just wanted to pet them. I got a few of the cats to play, but handed off the toy to a little girl who was there, as it was the only thing they seemed interested in for the time being. After that I just sat around for the remaining time, and no other cats wanted anything to do with us. \n\nThe room was WAY too small for 8 people. Everyone had to stay to one corner to avoid walking over, or bumping into each other. There was one snuggle cat, but two girls kept it to themselves the whole time. It was the only one that allowed itself to be held. \n\nI don't blame the cats, especially if it's a matter of over stimulation, or worn out cats, that's fine, but that's the owners responsibility to space out visits so the cats aren't feeling smothered, and humans can actually get there monies worth, and not just sit in a room with 8 other people staring a sleeping cats. \n\nAlso, the no cat option is awkward because people just sit outside the window and stare at you staring at cats. It made me uncomfortable. \n\nThe only positive was the Japanese toilet in the restroom.", "author": "Dean J."}

To get access to the cat lounge cost $20 per person, which is the weekday rate. I gather it is $25 on weekends and $15 at \"Happy Meower.\" You get all-you-can-drink green tea with that, or pay for additional food / drinks. We had a waffle sundae. It was fun and a good size for two. Cat lounge: you have to take off your shoes and Purell your hands before entering. If you've ordered food or tea it is brought to just outside the lounge and you can step out for a sec to bring it in. We were there around Friday at 6pm. There were 10-12 guests with us in the lounge for that hour, and about 12-14 cats. My one complaint would be this ratio; if you know cats, you know that they don't want to play all the time, so it kinda got competitive among the people who wanted to play with the cats who were in a playful mood. A girl stole the cat I was patting by luring it away with a toy!!! THE NERVE!!! This gave me a sad until Chloe, our cat handler, introduced me to Ginny, a beautiful tabby who loves shoulders and Ioves being up high. Well I am six foot three so she loved sitting on my shoulders while I walked around. I wore her like a dead mink stole until I finally walked by an even higher shelf and she got off to groom for awhile. We were there during feeding, and it was a fun, ridiculous frenzy. I like that Chloe asked the whole group if we were ok with her feeding them now, because the cats basically ignored us for 15 minutes when Chloe prepared and served dinner. But that was OK, the feeding frenzy was a blast to watch. Strong recommend but keep your expectations in check by reading the FAQ on their website which is well written. I didn't do this because it was a surprise present, and a great one, indeed. Pro-tip: This is a good place for a first date, btw. There were at least two in progress while we were there. Pro-tip: there's a back room off the lounge (with a sink, storage, laundry) where some of the cats go to chill; you can go back there and find some kitties to pet that are away from the crowd, and it's super chill back there.", "author": "Dave M."}

I was excited because I loved cats and the idea of a cat cafe. We waited in the cafe before our assigned time and drank tea. Then 10 people plus the cat wrangler/caretaker fit into a 9 feet x 12 feet room with 11 cats. Half of the cats stayed in the room and the other half roamed to the small adjacent back room, where trash bins, washer, dryer, cleaning supplies were. The cats were adorable and loving. The caretaker was knowledgeable and helpful in every way. The rooms were intoxicated with air fresheners. That prevented me from enjoying the services. Here are my humble suggestions:\n-Refrain from the use of air fresheners because of allergies and health implications. If the litter boxes smell then clean them hourly. If the trash smells than put them somewhere else.\n-Charge more, maybe $30-50/hour and have less customers. The 9ftx12ft room should not contain 11 people, maybe 6 for the best relaxation and enjoyment.\n-Advertise to a wider market such as the retired, widows, housewives, bourgeoisie, LGBT. The customers I saw last night were consistently young people between 18-28 years old, in school or just settled in the city with a job. Except one single lady in her 40s. \n-Offer 2 organic teas, one herbal and one caffeinated, as part of the hourly packages. 4 types of unlimited green teas were offered with our package. Some people would not drink green tea in the winter due to the cooling effects. Some may not care for the caffeine. I would prefer one organic herbal tea such as rooibos and one caffeinated tea such as chai (seasonally appropriate and less tea to make available in mass volumes). \n-Exceptionally clean and air-fresh restroom and cafe. Keep up the good work.\n-Young, helpful, energetic, good-looking staff. Keep up the good work. Maybe hire a male staff to boost your customer number and diversify on the long run.\nAll in all, I love the idea and believe they will succeed. I hope they would not use air fresheners and put so many people in the room, which were suboptimal physically and mentally for both humans and feline. I'm happy to pay $30-50 per hour. I would like to pay more to support them and for the good services. I would be happy to book the whole hour once a week or once a month for hubby and myself, if there are no air fresheners or smell of trash or kitty litter. Keep in mind my sister book the time because it was the cheapest, and I went along with her. At other times, there may be many less customers.", "author": "G D."}

Some cats want to meet you, some cats are having introverted days and can't wait to get back to their latest Netflix binge. The extroverts approach, you bestow some scratches on them, and maybe you get a head butt in return. If you're lucky, your new friend will snooze on your lap.\n\nSan Francisco's veins throb with overstimulation: put these in your ears, eat this, take a picture of that, listen to this, watch this, wear this on your face, try this drug, let's go for venti coffees at 6pm.\n\nLike all cats, the ones at KitTea owe you nothing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-26", "description": "KitTea is an adorable cat lounge with the sweetest cats and staff. The entire facility is very clean and beautifully decorated.\n\nYou can stay in the Tea Lounge for free and watch the cats and humans play through a glass window, or you can book a reservation online to play with the cats in the Cat Lounge for $25/hr (or $15 for a half hour, but that doesn't seem cost effective). Arrive 5-10 minutes before your reservation time. I recommend the earliest time of 11am so that the cats are fresh and ready to play! \n\nWe had an amazing host. It was obvious he cared about the cats. He also did a great job of making sure we had enough tea and food. The system is so stream-lined, that often your order will be at the window for you to pick up by the time you finish paying for said order (so in what feels like a few seconds!).\n\nI expected all the teas to come in pots, but what we ordered actually came in a single large cup. It's a little pricey at first glance -- $8 -- but this comes with unlimited refills. The matcha cheesecake is delicious. This place is better for a snack rather than a meal.\n\nBut on to the more important part -- playing with the cats! The cats are very friendly. However, my main complaint is that there were too many people for the number of cats available.That being said, the staff has done a great job of socializing the cats!\n\nMy other complaint, which is by no fault of the cafe, is that people do not seem to understand how to interact with cats, so here are some tips and facts from your resident cat lady to help make your experience more positive!\n - Cats are different from dogs. Duh. It's obvious, but judging by the reviews, people don't understand that. Dogs crave our attention. Cats really don't care and will go wherever they please, including high up on the play structures, far away from us. Be patient!\n- Cats sleep up to 16 hours a day, so there's a really high chance of them being asleep when you're visiting. Don't pick them up while they're sleeping. You don't like being woken up from a nap; neither do they. Feel free to pet them gently though!\n\nAnd all these lovely cats are up for adoption :-)\n\nDon't forget to get a stamp card on your way out!", "author": "Victoria C."}

We went at noon on a Saturday and there were 8 people and 4-5 cats. Of those cats, 2 stayed asleep the whole time. Even when the other 3 were awake, how do you fight 6 other people for their attention?\n\nI appreciate how the employees gave us dry food to try and coax the cats, but it didn't help much. Some simply weren't hungry.\n\nMaybe there are animal rights laws preventing them from allowing more cats in the area? Not sure, but for $25/hour it was definitely a let down.", "author": "Tina G."}

First of all, yes, WAY too expensive considering we even had to get our own food out of the other area.\n \nThe front desk lady was just plain rude. Seriously. The cat wrangler was OK, but in the middle of playing with a very happy and loving kitten. She just took it out of my wife's hands and said that she would bring in a kitten that was more social. She brought out a scared cat that didn't want to be out to replace the playful, purring, happy cat.\n\nNot to mention that when the food we ordered finally did come out it was the end of the hour, so we got kicked out for the next group to come in.

Youtube videos of people visiting cat cafes in other countries can only satisfy me for so long.\n\nThe facility is absolutely lovely. The design is very clean & modern, which I personally enjoy. We had 1 adult cat and 9 kittens on our visit here. They weren't the most active but it was nice just to hold and pet them. For the most part, they were pretty tolerant to being picked up and moved. And even though the employees can't serve you in the cat lounge because of health regulations, you're allowed to bring the food & teas into the lounge yourself.\n\nI love that they work with a local shelter to obtain their kittens. All the ones that you get to play with are up for adoption. According to our cat wrangler, they've already help 20 kittens find their forever homes since they opened.\n\nI would consider this place to be pretty decently priced: $15 for 30mins or $25 for 1hr. The reservations come with unlimited cups of 5 different teas. One hour goes by so quickly in here though. I don't think 30 minutes would have been enough for me! I would recommend placing a reservation if you're coming on a weekend day because we saw some people turned away.\n\nThe food (and tea outside of your reservation) is pretty pricey though. We tried all the included teas aside from Happy Tails (the licorice containing one). There's a good enough variety that I think everyone would be able to find something they like. My favorite was Cat Nap which has a light floral taste. As for the food, we only tried the quiche. It was tiny for the price and disappointing taste-wise. It also came out still cold, even top part.\n\nAnother downside is that your experience can depend on the other people that you go in with. If everyone is walking around and trying to pet all the cats, it can seem pretty crowded.\n\nI will definitely come back. My visit was probably the highlight of my entire week and was a great way to de-stress.", "author": "Cammie W."}

We wanted to recreate the experience on my daughter's birthday for her friends. The first thing we experienced instead when walking in the door was the strong smell of cat poop. When you are paying $100 for 4 people, they should clean the litter boxes before the people are let in.  \n\nIn Japan, which has more of space premium that San Francisco, the cat cafes are 3x the size with tracks above to watch the cats.  Here the cats can simply leave the \"caf\u00e9\" and disappear anytime they want. These are rescued cats and not comfortable with people.  It's dangerous and unfair to put rescue cats in this situation even though I think the owners would say they are \"helping\" them get \"adopted.\"  For people paying a lot to play with cats its awful because they only interact when you feed them and very little after that.  \n\nThe gal \"helping\" out went on \"break\" for 10 minutes during the hour and then all the cats disappeared.  My 3 girls with me were bored and we left after spending 15 minutes of the hour I paid for.  The owner of the caf\u00e9 was rude to me initially when I asked to just reserve a  1/2 hour because we had many stops on a limo trip.  I moved everything around so we could spend 45 minutes there and it was a big disappointment for my dauguhter's only 13th birthday.  Clearly the focus here is to appeal to people who don't know that this caf\u00e9 is subpar although others were wondering where the cats went.  Maybe a few tourists and have single visitors but not the way these cafes are the rage in Japan, have lots of varied and fun cats and cost  1/2 the price.  Skip this \"attraction\" visit a shelter or Japan instead.  Hopefully a competitor will soon do it better because if this was good then $25 would be worth it but clearly the focus is not on the cats or the customers just making money.", "author": "Karie K."}

(we paid $17 for 3 scones, on top of the $20 admission fee.  The cafe menu is a  bit eclectic , even strange (salmon and goat cheese waffle wrap ?) and is NOT good for anyone with dietary restrictions due to food sensitivities. My husband had to take my daughter down the block, to get a gluten-free, no cheese pizza.\n\nThe actual cafe is TINY,  and they cram 9-10 guests in there until the KitTea cat room scheduled appointment time, (along with any walk-in patrons to the cafe). There's only seating for 8 at small tables-for-two, and a counter that seats maybe 4 more...\n\nThe cat room is also pretty small, which is why they limit the number of guests at each session, but we were stepping over one another (they encourage you to get down on the floor to play with the cats) and many of the cats were not interested in engaging with humans.  Only about 5 cats were actively moving about the room, so guests were vying for their attention. \n\nWhat I do like is that they work to adopt out cats, and have adopted out 176 cats to date in the two years of operation.

We ordered some snacks on a whim, and the cookies were so-so but the spinach feta quiche is some of the best quiche I've ever had! \n\nCats --  a never ending mix of adoptable, social, cats of all breeds, ages, and personalities. A big thing people should know before going is that the cats are... cats; there's no promise they'll want to be petted, play, or even been seen with you. KitTea has really cool wall boxes the cats can climb up into, beds and boxes under the bench seating, and a quiet area the cats can retreat into if they want to sleep or just be alone. \n\nThe decor is gorgeous and there's also a separate cafe area with a huge window to the cat area you can visit anytime without an appointment if you just want some tea and snacks, or to sit down and work a while.\n\nMost importantly, your $25/hr fee goes to animal adoption and shelters and it looks like they're getting shelter cats into forever homes week after week, which is great. It can be really hard to get older or adult cats homes, but KitTea is helping to solve that problem!", "author": "Laura J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-03-01", "description": "**This is only a review of the adoption process (or I guess, lack thereof) handled by Kittea and their partnering animal shelter, Wonder Cat Rescue.** \n\nLong story short, I saw that Kittea had a new pair of brothers and was looking into adopting them even before they were socialized and allowed to play in the main cafe. I feel like I did my part to communicate with both Kittea and Wonder Cat Rescue, but ended up missing out on the opportunity to even meet them. (If you want the full play-by-play of my experience with Wonder Cat Rescue, you can read it here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/wonder-cat-rescue-san-francisco?hrid=MaTBxI8Pf6aAcEX3xV5b2w)\n\nThe cats at Kittea are provided by a local animal rescue center called Wonder Cat Rescue, which is mainly run by one person who I think (from reading other reviews) does so in her spare time. Super kudos to her for trying to provide for and find homes for tons of animals. The issue with this is that the service and attention available falls short of a good experience - and this is doubly true now that Kittea is open for business. There are now more cats on display to potential owners, and given the popularity of Kittea (\"the first cat cafe in San Francisco\"), I suspect the turnover must be high. \n\nNow, I fully understand that you can't put cats \"on hold\" if you're not able to immediately meet and adopt them during the week, especially when the kittens in question are as adorable as the ones in question. But Wonder Cat Rescue should have been upfront about there being other people meeting them before me so I knew that 1) I was the \"backup\" 2) I should allocate my time to looking at other shelters. I initially inquired about and sent in an adoption form for the kittens on Monday (having sent in a general application to Wonder Cat Rescue a whole month prior and never hearing back) and was told to check back on Thursday. I did and got no response. Nothing on Friday or Saturday, either. I get an email on Sunday saying they've been adopted.\n\nI had swapped a handful of emails with Wonder Cat Rescue on Monday and Tuesday, and in that following Thursday-Saturday period, I did my due diligence and emailed Wonder Cat Rescue again, as well as called and left voice messages with Kittea. I even messaged them on Facebook inquiring about the kittens' availability. By Sunday, I wasn't expecting a response from Kittea at all but I actually got a FB message on Monday saying that they had been adopted, and that they aren't able to check their voicemail all the time so I should've emailed instead. If that's the case then perhaps you shouldn't put \"If you have any questions call us at 415-658-7888\" on your website and then never pick up.\n\nThis review isn't about missing out on the kittens so much as how there wasn't satisfactory communication with Kittea (it's also hard to separate the experience between the two entities). Courtney, the founder of Kittea, responded to my follow-up FB messages and tried to explain that they can't \"cherry pick\" who gets to meet the cats meaning they can't put them on hold. Yes, I get that, and I already said so. I'm glad the kittens were able to find a good home, and I don't have negative feelings about that. It's the fact that there is a presumption that I actually don't understand all that and the absence of transparency about the adoption process (which is something hopefully Kittea and Wonder Cat Rescue will work on together). I feel like my time was devalued.\n\nAgain, this is a review solely on my attempt to meet and potentially adopt the cutest (read: in the highest demand) pair of kittens from Kittea. I'm not sure I have any advice for other potential owners as I felt like I did all I could do in my situation of not being able to meet the kittens ASAP.\n\nEdit: Changing my review to a 1-star. I was on Instagram and saw that the brothers had actually been adopted separately, when the Kittea website stated they had to be adopted together. So Wonder Cat Rescue decided to split the siblings up rather than wait a few extra days for a willing home that could take in both of them... Strange. So much for doing \"what's best for the cats\".", "author": "Katie M."}

Been constantly reminded for a visit by the lady and decided to come here on Valentine's Day Eve (Saturday)! Made a reservation online for a 7pm-8pm appointment which came out to be $52 for 2 people (25 per person per hour + 2 fees on weekends and 20 per person per hour + 2 fees on weekdays) The price seems pretty steep for just petting kittens especially if you live with cats.... it just doesn't seem like a great deal to pay excess amount but at least the mission of the cafe is to find these kittens a home and up for an adoption! Parking is very limited in this district so you're probably gonna end up parking at a meter or some tight alley praying that you don't hit the cars around you. (Public transportation highly recommended) \n\nEntering the petite cafe it seemed like a peaceful environment kind of like a library. There's a room to get your tea (selected teas included with reservation) and the door thats kept closed to enter the room with the kittens. It's a shoes off policy which are kept in a mini basket prior to entry. There were maybe like 8 kittens approximately roaming around and 2 in a glassed room because they were too young and vulnerable to come out but you can make an entry to the glassed room with request and hand sanitization! My favorite kitten was Pocket (black petite kitten)  who was originally asleep when arriving but she shot up to be somewhat energetic. I felt like at the time of 7pm.... most of the kittens were some what tired because of the long day as a few were little bit sleepy on and off. There were maybe 12 total people in the room during the one hour duration  so theres plenty of room and not crowded at all. There was an instructor (forgot his name) that introduced the cats and helped with the cat interactions! \n\nI believe our time slot of 7-8pm was indeed the last reservation before it closed as we saw them tidying the place up! Cool concept to experience once but i don't know if i would go back again just because of the steep price.. and I personally allergic to cats as well as more interested in puppies!

The staff are friendly and helpful in terms of explaining the rules and overall experience. The entire place has a very peaceful vibe and I liked that there was a tea room separate from the cats in case you are just looking to observe the cats. Their tea list is pretty extensive and I would come back just to try a few of their offerings. \n\nObviously, being the crazy cat lady that I am, I could not wait to get into the cat room and dreamed of all of the cats crawling all over me. Unfortunately, since we're talking about cats, this was not the case. A lot of the cats were either sleeping (do not disturb!) or totally skittish. While I was expecting this to be the case, I did find the human to cat ratio to be a bit off. I feel like they should plan for some of the cats to be sleeping/hiding and therefore increase the number of cats per hour. \n\nI can't believe I'm about to say this, but here it goes (no judgements please): I was a bit surprised/upset about the unwillingness of other people to 'share' the cats. Let me explain - there were four kittens in the room that day, and clearly everyone went straight for them. There was a group of three women who scooped them up at the beginning and proceeded to hold on to them for the entire duration of our time. Yes, the full hour. I'm not going to lie, I was pretty upset. It's a very strange dynamic when you have to ask a grown woman to share her kitten with you. I ended up not saying anything and sending evil glares in their direction. I wish the attendants/staff members in the room had picked up on it and had worked out a better system in which everyone has time with the cats. Sadly, not being able to actually engage with the kittens kind of ruined the experience for me, and I'm not sure I'd go back. \n\nWith that said, I think it's a wonderful idea and certainly a great cause.

One cat in particular that I saw this happen with over and over again was Aunt Gail, a senior cat who is up for adoption. She would meow and try to escape from this child, and of course the child would put her back down. But this child was relentless and I really felt bad for this sweet cat. I also felt as though there were too many people in the room at once, which may have led this child to look for attention from a cat that was not suited for her energy level. The one thing keeping this experience from being worthy of 5 stars would be the people-to-cats ratio.

I was very excited to hear that it was opening here and waited with anticipation. I love that some of the cats are residents and some are newbies who can be adopted. They've facilitated nearly 200 adoptions so far! They have interesting events, which I haven't tried yet, like movie nights and yoga. The place is clean and the cats look healthy. And they have delicious waffles and other dishes in the cafe, which is separate from the animal area. Unfortunately I didn't feel it was a relaxing or warm environment and on top of the hourly minimum fee (no discount for a shorter visit), the snacks for the cats are super expensive. Nearer to closing time, the cats are less and less interested in the humans even if you have snacks so if you are nearby at that time, it's free to peek through the window from the eating area.", "author": "Marina N."}

Before you venture here, check the prices and availability cause if they Are full you will be turned away.\n\nA)For those who book appts. or come in between the times of 2-6pm, there is a high chance of you spending $50+for an hour of sipping tea next to sleeping cats. If we wanted to see that, just look up a tree really.\n\nDon't get me wrong, its nice to know that the cats have somewhere to be instead of on the street looking for scraps or on 280 as roadkill but for those few hours, for the price people pay, i don't think they will come back. Particularly those who did not receive a code to use during the funding stage of kittea.(-1)\n\nB) The cafe staff is more than hesitant or reluctant depending on how you perceive the staff members demeanor. If your appt time has not yet arrived, they prefer not to serve any drinks to you other than something that could pass for tap water.\n\nIn my mind that just sounds like someone trying to limit their inventory costs by only serving to those who are inside with the cats. But at the same time, it sounds ...for lack of a better term....dumb....\n\nFor the most part people do see the price tags on the small appetizer length menu they place at each table. But if you don't want people ordering till they are inside, why have it out to begin with?\n\nIts like opening the front doors to a gentlemen's' club at 8am but no shows or entertainers are going to be on stage until 6pm that night... Why bother having it out if theres nothing to be put out? (-1)\n\nC) The cats are people friendly, and aren't too shy about being held by strangers, the little ones will squirm away to the sun while the big ones just look at you with a \" what the hell do you want? Cant you see I'm sleeping?\" Face.. (+1)\n\nD) The human bathrooms are clean, and they have what loos like toto toilets so at least the environment is clean for both.(+1)\n\n\nIn closing, if you dont mind paying nearly the price of two steaks from HOPR to sit with cats and drink tea that does not stand out from what can be found in chinatown, then this may be the place for you to go to.\n\nIf you would rather spend your money on food, GoKart Racing or anything else in the city. I totally understand.\n\nBiggest turn off for people i spoke to outside of their establishment including the person who took me here was the price....\n\nSeriously 50 dollars per hour? I think some people just looked at the Movie ticket prices in a whole different light because of it..\n\nReasoning for two star review : For those of us not working for apple, google or Deloitte, 50 dollars can really make a  big difference in your weekly plans,especially with the cost of living in sf, whether its the TL or the Sunset. \n\nFor those people who did not get codes because they didn't donate during the funding phase, that price tag will turn them off more than a sweet toothed kid staring at vegan brownies.\n\nFor those who are curious to what the asian standard of a cat-house/cat shelter looks like, look on google: kitty/cat house in japan.

We both love to eat the waffles with Nutella and berries.  An hour goes by fast.  Everything is very clean and there isn't any cat smell.  The cats are lovely.  One criticism is that the food ordering gets a bit backed up. By the time I ordered a waffle, it still hadn't come by the end of the session and I had to take it to go.  You can order food with your reservation but sometimes, you just want to see what it looks like or see how you feel before you order.  I think orders should be done within the first 20 min of the session and they should be given first priority over those just sitting in the cafe.  I also feel that while the cafe and cat lounge area are very clean, it doesn't get a lot of natural light so it can feel somewhat sterile, cold and dark.

This is most likely supplemented by the fact that  you get unlimited tea when you book time with cats. They also didn't have any non-tea drinks, so if you like Coffee, you're out of luck.\n\nThe actual cats part was okay. We went mid-afternoon at 3 o'clock and all the cats were asleep, or they were all crowded in one area, and that area was crowded by 1 group. The main issue here is that there were too many people during our appointment time, and so few cats to play with.

I went during the soft opening, so they weren't officially open yet, but you could already feel how much love and effort went into this place. The reservation process itself was super easy. I had to reschedule my visit at one point, and it was easy and straightforward. The KitTeam (stealing that from another review) was super friendly, and loved telling stories about the cats and the cafe itself. \n\nI had a pot of the Sencha Wind, which was delicious. I didn't get to try any of their baked goods, though.\n\nThe person:cat ratio was pretty high when I was there, but the cats wander around enough that it was easy to play with most of them in my allocated hour. The space itself is highly conducive to interacting with the cats; they have chairs and poofs of all heights, and the tables are covered in feather toys, laser pointers, and beds. My favorite part is definitely that giant hamster (or I suppose cat) wheel in the front! If you're lucky, you'll get to see one of the kittens run on it for a second.

There were seven cats out and about, although several slept the entire time. All of them seemed to be adolescents, about five to eirght months old. Most of them seemed to have no particular interest in visiting humans, but were ok with us trying interest them with toys. There  were also two white younger kittens in an enclosed play tent, who were off limits to us, but whose lively antics were fun to watch. This visit experience would be best for people who are new to interacting with cats. For those of us who are cat owners, it was a bit slow, but nice. FYI, the cafe has a diverse but petite menu that includes snacks, petite pastries, and lovely green teas. It is possible to order from the menu in the cafe and also in the cat visiting area.", "author": "Judith B C."}

However, this does not mean that I do not also think cats are great. My experience here with the cats was also great. They have happy hours where it's 50% off prices so instead of $14 for a 1/2 hour with the kitties it is $7. The price you pay with your reservation online includes unlimited free tea (mostly Japanese teas like Hojicha, etc.). I paid $14/person for a 1/2 hour with the kitties & thought the experience was superb! The space is super clean & tastefully decorated. You'll 1st walk into a lobby area where they have kitty art & an aroma diffuser with a nice subtle scent. You then enter the peaceful & sterile looking tea room where you pick out your tea & get pastries (not included in the price you paid online for the reservation). The tearoom has really great mid-century modern chairs & little tables. If you wish to just sit in the tea room & observe the kitties thru the glass you may. Their bathroom has a Japanese warming toilet with a bunch of fancy functions. It was my first time sitting on a warm toilet. You can bring the tea into the kitty room. Our tea wrangler was Maggie (Margie?) & she introduced us to the cats & gave us a run-down of the rules. If a cat is sleeping you are not to bother it but you may lightly pet it. I'd rather just not bother it because I personally wouldn't want to be touched if I were sleeping. Because they are all kittens, they are all still in training. Maggie reminded us not to let the cats make a habit of playing with our hands but instead the toys. She didn't want the cats to think that our hands were toys. About 1/3 of the kitties were sleeping while the rest were playing or walking around. The kitties are all adoptable. 26 kitties have been adopted since they opened. I think this is a great concept that was perfectly executed @ KitTea.", "author": "Brenda L."}

I am obsessed with cats and was really looking forward to this. First off, the price is pretty expensive, but I felt it was worth it to at least try it out. The teas were really good. The cats themselves were mostly pretty shy and skittish, but that is to be expected since they are rescued cats and all. I was disappointed in the size of this place, however. The room is crowded and I didn't feel comfortable enough to play with the cats. There were way too many people in there all up in your space and it was annoying to have to deal with. So mostly, I just sat back and sipped on my tea. Either the place needs to be bigger, or they need to restrict the amount of people they allow back there with the cats. \n\nYou are also allowed to adopt the cats, but the price is rather expensive. Why not just go to an animal shelter? Way cheaper and probably better cats. \n\nOverall, it was just an okay experience, but rather disappointing. Would I come back again? Probably not.

And I've always wanted to go to a cat cafe. I heard back in March that this place was going to open up during the summer, and I made a mental note that I had to go. Today I got to do just that!\nRight when you enter, you can check in for your reservation (which they strongly recommend making in advance, as I believe the people cap for the cat lounge is 10). You can make a 30-minute reservation at $15 dollars per person, or an hour for $25 dollars per person.  The people at the front desk were amazingly kind and made me feel welcome. They led me to the tea lounge, where I could grab tea and any food I wanted to get before going in to see the cats. I chose \"Cat Nap\", one of their free complimentary teas (yum!). At 1:30, I was let in to meet the cats. Be aware that midday is usually kitty nap time, so they're going to be doing more sleeping than jumping around. One really cool thing was on a few of the tables in the cat cafe were cards explaining what certain tail signals mean signals mean, so guests don't accidentally scare a poor kitty. I believe we had 9 cats in the room with us. Warning, it's very hard not to fall in love with cats when they cuddle up to you during their naps. \nOne thing I really like is that this cafe is part of an animal shelter, so it's a great way to make money for animals while allowing people to meet some of the cats they have!\nThank you Kittea, I cannot wait to return!", "author": "Riley E."}

It doesn't seem like it's a very large space to begin with so I totally understand their dilemma here.

We are both avid cat lovers and both have a cat or cats.(I have two, she has one). I mentioned a place that had kittens after we expressed that we needed more cuddles with little balls of fur....That place was KITTEA I told her that it was all the \"rage in Japan\" supposedly and was a new place in this glorious city. She was shocked that as a Elite member of Yelp she didn't know about this furry heaven. It was as simple as going online and reserving our slot and for how many people. You get to choose from hourly to half hour and it even has an option to make an offer to reserve the whole place if people wanted. We booked our slot, jumped in Lyft and made or way inside. Immediately greeted by two women at the front counter and asked if it was a \"walk in\" or \"reservation\" I mentioned we had a slot and they immediately asked if I was Robert. Then told us to walk into the tea room and select tea from a 9 item list. We did so immediately and were handed two cups of steamy tea. We were flagged down to continue inside and did just that. Immediately we were overwhelmed. Kittens were everywhere. From a swinging suspended chair to a little cubby stack to cushions all over. A woman was inside who was a bit awkward but polite and told us that if we wanted more tea or snacks to let her know and she would take care of it. We immediately tarted petting the soft warm little bodies who were comfortably sleeping in the spaces of comfort. The hour flew by and I would definitely be coming back. The place is modern, clean, very friendly and relaxing. We both left with smiles on our face and relaxation emanating from our bodies. Good job KITTEA y'all are awesome.", "author": "Robert B."}
