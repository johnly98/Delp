Would definitely recommend coming here once you've already had a drink or 2 and with a couple friends. But the bartenders seem to be inattentive. Relatively dead (understandable on a week day) but neither of the bartenders said hello as I walked in. Once I was physically at the bar, one of them was forced to say something to me since she was eye level with me rinsing a glass. So like I said, the bar is definitely cute and clean. More my jam.

It doesn't get the typical Mission crowd on weekends and it's got pinball (The Walking Dead as of July 2015).  The machine gets code updated too when they release new code - like the awesome update on TWD.  Just remember to always go from the drop targets on the left.  Those will enable a mode, and the first time you hit one, it'll lock in to either Food, Weapons or First Aid.  You have to fully light all three to get to Blood Bath.  Once you get all the drop targets down for Blood Bath, it's a two ball multiball and you can add a ball each time you take down the drops again.  This can also be stacked on to Well Walker Multiball or Prison Multiball, so it's super valuable.\n\nThe  multikill values are now like 20 or 25% of your mode value so if you blow up a mode, the multikills can be valuable especially when stacked with 2x playfield or your inlane \"x\"\n\nOh and they have a good array of beers are solid prices!", "author": "Gene X."}

It was convenient, considering it was literally a timed one-minute walk from my crappy Capp St. apartment. It was cheap, the fare of a well-drink did its duty as I was rendered drunk enough to view the unemployed deadbeat patrons that visited this fine establishment as almost attractive enough to forgive their questionable hygiene and their skateboards that litter the floor. I was also lucky enough to carve a reputation for myself as a local pool shooter in the back room, because I too, was a local unemployed deadbeat who had nothing better to do than to play pool all day. However, as Bob Dylan once said, these times, they are a changin'. \n\nAlas, the glory days of Uptown are no more as a new customer base started frequenting the bar -- customers that actually have jobs. I left the city right when the PBR stopped flowing, the pool table price was upped to a dollar and the young techies/brogrammers started coming to the bar to get a \"real\" dive bar experience. The worst part? Someone even had the audacity to fix the broken toilet seat in the women's bathroom. If you can't cry or do drugs on a crappy toilet in a dive bar, what's the point? Go back to whence you've came, Stanford graduates who work at start-ups! You're making our shit-hole meet the city's health and safety code! Go code somewhere else. (Pun intended.) \n\nI give Uptown 4/5 for the fond memories and the sharp pool shooters that kicked my ass and taught me how to be a better pool player and for the bartenders, because they don't give a shit about you and that's how all bartenders should be.", "author": "Carolyn H."}

Our beers were... well, beers - not the best selection in the world - but Tracee was all over her vodka tonic, which was heavy on the alci-mi-hol, and we couldn't argue about the prices. (Cash only, BTW...)\n\nSo we ordered another round. And another.\n\nThe screening went surprisingly well. The complete arseness of the movie was dampened by the room spinning. Wheee!\n\nWe stopped in for another round afterwards, before we met the aspiring moviemaker and her crew for dinner. At this point, the place was full of douches who were trying their best to look trendy - and failing miserably. We downed our round and left.\n\nI'd give this place three, but for simply fuelling me with beer to get me through that screening, they get one extra.", "author": "Gary E."}

The bartender was enough to turn me off of this place all on her own.\n\nFor starters, smile a bit, and don't act like such a hater. Also, when my friend tells you it's his birthday and you make him a nearly $7 drink, don't make snide remarks to me about how I'm not a good enough friend and should be buying his drink for him. Maybe you could take a hint from Elbo Room, or Casanova, or any number of the other bars we went to who gave him free drinks. Or if free drinks aren't your thing, that's fine, just don't give me lip when you don't even know me. \n\nHonestly, this place does it for some people, but not for me.

Uptown is pretty much exactly what I'd imagine a dive bar to be with a random crowd and decently priced drinks. If you're here during drinking hours, it may be hard to find a place to sit down since there aren't that many seats. The thing that stuck out most to me at this bar is all the action figures and dolls sitting atop the bar shelves. It's just a random collection of things that have arms and legs. There's also a pool table in a room that should be bigger (you might hit someone when shooting). I like this place a lot more than those other 2 dive bars I just mentioned. It had more a homely SF feeling to me. If you need a drink at some a straight up dive in the Mission, this is a good option.

The drink prices are the best in town, and I've heard comments that we have a bad case of heavy pour, but that isn't really a bad thing.

Have you ever been in a bar that not only denied you water but whose bartender (I believe his name is John) leaned his arm smugly on the counter and said \"Are you gonna get a beer with that?\" My reply \"Not quite yet but I am sure I will in a few.\" He responsed to me, smugly and like a dipshit, \"How do I know your not gonna just drink it and leave?\" Its water, guy, its free in San Francisco and in most places in our country. Yes we have a limited supply and we need to solve the worlds water problems but guess what? WE NEED IT TO LIVE! My girlfriend and I walked across half the city to get to this dive (which up until this point was a favorite bar of mine.) She asked me to get her a water and I tried my best. After the douche-bag bartenders third \"you can't have water jerk\" comment I told him to fuck off and walked back to our booth. Upon hearing this my girlfriend got up and asked him \"Are you really not gonna give me a water?\" He gave her a couple words and she pointed out that we were here with 20 or so people. Easily three quarters of the bars customers. \"What if they all ordered water?\" he said. Good point guy. You're an asshole. At that point I was pissed and started yelling about what a dick he was, fuck you for not giving us water, who made you god of the drunks, etc, etc....All he could do is cower into his corner and cry that \"I don't like the way you are talking to me.\" Oh boo-hoo you fucking moron! Wow, ruined my night. I wanted to leave and almost had all 20 convinced to leave but they were expecting more friends. Who am I to ruin a poor girls party. So I played pool and had a some friends buy a few beers for me. I didn't want to give that jackass the satisfaction of getting me a drink. I have never been so pissed at a bartender or waiter in my entire life. So smug and moronic. Such an ass. Anyway and once again Zero Stars for the Uptown mainly for the jackass bartender, which is sad because other than that...it is a pretty nice dive.", "author": "tex w."}

Most times, the Uptown has nice, efficient bartenders and a generally good vibe. After last night, I will never go here again. The unfortunate denouement of our evening: friend orders our drinks at 1:40 AM, bartender announces last call at 1:45 AM. Chunky, usually benign, pseudo-intellectual doorman, decides that he can remove our full drinks from the table at 1:48AM, literally taking my friends whiskey and coke OUT OF HIS HANDS. Other friend wouldn't give his up, and doorman starts shaking with fury; shaking like Muhammed Ali with the DTs and then acts like he is going to punch him. Disgusting way to treat your patrons. His power-trippin (almost psychotic) ego can be measured by his beard. Gah.", "author": "Anon Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2005-06-02", "description": "This place has the dive-bar attitude and decor but without the disgusting, unusable bathrooms. It typically has plenty of seating in the form of wooden booths and sofas. The pool room has just the one table and is a bit cramped, but the surface is in better shape than the felt on tables at most bars. What's more, there's rarely a line to play, and each game only costs 50 cents. The jukebox has a good selection of rockin' tunes (read: classic rock, punk, Johnny Cash and the like), and the clincher is that the drinks are cheap: $2 for a standard beer, $3 for a premium beer and $3 for a well drink. The crowd manages to keep its contingents of the too-cool-for-schoolers and the scenesters to a minimum, so it tends to be nice and chill.", "author": "Eugene P."}
