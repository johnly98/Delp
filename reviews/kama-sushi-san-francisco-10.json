About a year ago,  my best friend and I ventured into the city to see a Broadway show at the Orpheum and stumbled across Kama Sushi.\n\nWe were charmed by the lovely golden wood interior, made welcome by the gracious and informative servers,  hooked by the plentiful and affordable happy hour menu then completely seduced by the amazing food. \n\nWith tickets to Book of Mormon in hand,  we headed back tonight and were delighted once again. \n\nTonight we explored the menu more deeply.  The spicy miso ramen balanced good heat with sweet corn kernels, delicious broth and grilled pork.  The brussels sprouts skewers were tasty, as were the butabara- pork belly- skewers. \n\nBoth the albacore and salmon tataki were well seasoned,  fresh and flavorful. I tried,  but didn't care for the Tako Wasabi. While I LOVE octopus and wasabi separately,  marinating raw octopus in fresh wasabi results in what I perceive to be a slimy,  chewy mess... but I tried it. \n\nWhat sets Kama apart from other restaurants is the friendly service.

It came with a miso soup, which had a great flavor, but I wish there was a little more tofu. The katsu also came with a spring mix on the same plate. \n\nFor dessert I ordered the fried green tea ice cream, and was not that impressed. The green tea ice cream itself was excellent, but the fried tempura portion was not up to others I have had. It was not crunchy enough but overall, the dessert was just average/good. \n\nThe check was kind of confusing because we weren't sure who our waiter was. Three different servers all took turns taking care of us which was fine, but then we weren't really sure who to ask for the check.

Nice starter portion.\n\nOrdered the fried lobster roll which was beautiful but I think it was overdone with the crunch.

All the typical rolls you would find at a sushi bar exist, along with standard Japanese food such as ramen and skewers.\n\nI came here for happy hour because I saw several reviews about the great prices. About that...I'd say that the only good deals on the entire menu were the tataki and Maki roll. Everything else---the skewers, nigiri, rolls, were all at a normal price. \n\nSo onto the food!\n\nTataki: I ordered the salmon tataki, and I'd have to say that you get a lot of fish for the price. They put the fish with onions and a special sauce, topped with garnish. I liked the flavor of the sauce, but thought it was just too strong. After I finished the appetizer, I had this lingering vinegar and salty feel on my tongue that made me almost forget the taste of the fish.\n\nMaki roll: For the unagi roll, I was really disappointed at how little meat I got. I was essentially eating 95% california roll, and that made me really upset. In terms of the roll, it's not bad, but I thought there was too much rice, the seaweed didn't chew nicely, and the temperature of the roll was too warm. \n\nNigiri: I love just straight meat, and this was the highlight of my meal. The portion is plentiful, and the accompanying rice is placed pretty well under the meat. \n\nChicken skewers: They were alright and you get a lot of meat, but two things threw me off. One, I'm a meat lover, so when the skewers came with chicken and scallions, my stomach turned a bit and told me dang it, really? But from the perspective of someone who doesn't hate scallions, I still felt that the scallions were a bit out of place with the meat. It was two or three pieces of scallion per stick, and it really just interrupted the taste of chicken. I also thought the sauce was too liquid and on the saltier side.\n\nOverall, not bad, but definitely did not impress me. Even during happy hour, I had to spend a decent amount to fill myself up.", "author": "Michael Y."}

The Uni was NOT fresh, tasted like it had been sitting for a day. I really like the tuna salad and would recommend getting this again. \n\n[Decor]\nThe restaurant does some aged.

The rice to fish ratio was a little high, which made it hard to taste the fish. Rolls were not that flavorful in general. Super Spicy tuna just tasted like Sriracha. Mackerel nigiri tasted fresh and not fishy though. They did give us low sodium soy sauce so maybe that's why things tasted a little bland.\n\nOverall, not a bad place for ordering in sushi if you live in Mission Bay(aka food desert) like I do.

Kind of small but we were able to get a seat right away.\n\nDrinks: We got a bottle of the Malbec which was only $32- I would say a good price for a bottle of wine in SF.\n\nRolls: All the rolls we got were so good. Ranked in order of preference: The White Out (I loveeee butterfish), C27, Hot Mama, Red Dragon. The Hot Mama was pretty heavy since it was baked, but it was really different from the other rolls which I liked. The Red Dragon was really good but a little too spicy for me (I liked the spicy tuna but next time would ask for no red pepper flakes on top). All the rolls were priced between $10- $13 which is SO reasonable for really good sushi.\n\nCame here a second time and got the white out again, foxy, and pyramid.

I wanted the Super Spicy Tuna Roll ($9.95) which is apparently the spiciest special roll on the menu... and it was pretty good! Kama is very generous with their portions of fish on their sushi and I have rarely tasted anything fresher than what they serve here.\n\nOur meal was accompanied by hot tea (DELICIOUS!) and hot sake, the latter of which you can get by checking in on Yelp. The conclusion of our experience was brought to us by Fried Green Tea Ice Cream. Fantastic end to a lovely dinner.

My friend and I decided to come here on the suggestion of a friend, but after doing my due diligence of Yelp, it seemed as though most Yelpers felt a bit meh about the sushi.

I went with the chicken karaage ramen which came with either an avocado or cucumber roll.\n\nThe chicken karaage ramen was actually pretty good. Chicken karaage was pretty spot on--not the best karaage that I've ever had, but it was still good. The ramen noodles themselves and the broth were great though. The noodles were on the firmer side though still chewy, and the broth tasted really peppery which I think is something that could be very bad to some, but something I ended up actually really enjoying since it was a nice change in pace. It's definitely not a purist bowl of ramen though--lots of corn and other random stuff floating around, but it's also ramen in a sushi place, so that's probably why.\n\ntldr; decent ramen here!", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Strangely, it still feels like a Tyrolean beer hall with all the blond wood paneling even if the owners are trying to make it feel like a hipsterish sushi bar. The customers didn't seem to care. It was packed for a Monday night around 8PM when I was in desperate need for some ramen to soothe my work-saturated soul. I fortunately landed a table next to two German women who must be staying in one of the nearby motels given their complete ignorance of Japanese cuisine.\n\nUnder the mistaken presumption that I know what was good here based on my ethnicity, they kept ordering what I was ordering. Too bad they missed Schnitzel Haus. I checked in to discover I was entitled to a free bottle of sake which I took warm (photo: http://bit.ly/19yj4GY). That was a happy surprise as it was quite cold that evening. I started slow by ordering the $4.95 pair of Hamaichi Nigiri Sushi, which allowed me a taste of reasonably fresh yellowtail if the serving was rather paltry for the price (photo: http://bit.ly/1bxFn0F). Next came the $5.95 Butadara Skewers, which were again rather paltry with grilled pork belly served yakitori-style on wooden sticks (photo: http://bit.ly/1jfFu5n). The main event was the $9.95 bowl of Karaage Ramen, which was a marginal disappointment.\n\nIt came in a fashionably wavy black bowl steeped in a soy-based broth and topped with pieces of deep fried chicken that were honestly not as flavorful as McNuggets. There was green onion, dried seaweed and even sweet corn thrown into the broth, but the strangest touch was raw romaine lettuce which looked like it was lost on its way to a Caesar salad (photo: http://bit.ly/1b2QnrX). The noodles at least were acceptable with a nice al dente texture that diverted some of my attention from the random lettuce sightings. The German hausfraus seem to like it. Service was rather on the erratic side, but I still hope the owners beat the jinx of this corner location and stick around since quality sushi eateries are uncommon in SoMa since Sushi Groove South hit the bricks.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...erratic and sometimes paltry with a hit-and-miss ramen bowl that could be majorly tweaked to maximize flavor\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...strangely (though understandably) Tyrolean\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...sometimes they come and sometimes they don't\nTOTAL - 3 stars...middling Japanese is better than none in SoMa", "author": "Ed U."}

My fianc\u00e9 and I are visiting SF and was hoping for some delicious sushi after a long day of sitting on the plane. Unfortunately we left the restaurant feeling sick and grossed out instead. When the ramen arrived, I was at first excited about the large bowl, but when I bit into the pork \"chop\" (it was mostly the fatty bits), I was hit with cold meat. The soup wasn't even hot! When I asked if they could heat it back up, they took it, probably nuked it in the microwave and brought it back lukewarm at best.\n\nThe sushi did not taste fresh at all and we couldn't even bring ourselves to eat the rest of it after the initial bite.

Traffic was horrendous. But not this part of town. 9th and Folsom, across from that Mexican bar that I liked. He's sitting at the bar, ordered a cold house Sake for a hot night, waiting. I was simply frazzled because there were still a lot of work to do even though the weekend was upon us. He chose this place because I was about to head over to an art gallery later on. He rode his bike to meet me there and by the tim I arrived, he already ordered some specials on the board, some flying fish and hamachi nigiri. I was quite delighted by the fish to rice proportion. Reminds me of Japan, not a lot of rice, plenty of fish. Happy Hour menu rendered some delectables: saba, hamachi, skewers, spicy tuna roll and then some. But what really caught my eye was the tamago on display on the sushi counter.\n\nTamago = Japanese egg omelette. You may say, that's total cheap stuff! Not so. Not if you ever watched David Gelb's Jiro Ono documentary, you'd know that Jiro's tamago is a test must be performed by his apprentice, 200 times, no less. When done right, tamago tasted like savory sweet egg custard, it melts in your mouth and renders you speechless and breathless. Like the vegetarian version of uni, good tamago is the ultimate food euphoria. When I was at the Japanese fish market this winter, I found a vendor that sold nothing but varies versions of tamago. And at the famed sushi stalls in the fish market, when you order omakase, the sushi chefs will always start you off with tamago nigiri. I too once thought of tamago as the poor man's sushi, but ever since this Nippon expedition, I was a convert. The texture and color of this tamago looked great. I then found out that it was on the happy hour special for $2.95 a pair. I ordered one set to start but said to the waitress, \"I may need to have another order of it, if you don't mind.\" She acknowledged and then walked away. \"Unless it's terrible,\" I said to him under my my breathe. He smiled at my remark. It's not. As expected, the tamago nigiri had the perfect taste, texture and presentation. \n\nHe was having a bit of too much fun observing me transforming while eating tamago nigiri: one minute I was this anxious workaholic talking shop, the next, a soft, giggling female looking ever bit of dreamy and lustful.. of the next piece of nigiri. \n\nThe rest of the meal was filled with me waving down the waitress and asking them to load up on the rolls and more nigiri. He ate much less than I did, perhaps he's just less excitable in general, or less enthusiastic about the sushi here, meanwhile, I couldn't shut up about the softness of tamago. \"You like this, don't you? Better than those places on California, Balboa, or Arguello?\" He asked, already knew my answer. \"Yes.\" I said. \"This could be my favorite, you know.\" I added.\n\nHamachi, Maguro, Bonito, Walu, Tobiuo, Albacore, Saba, those are my favorite nigiri. The seared hamachi dish as an appetizer was also quite good with red onions. House cold sake was better than what I had in other places. Clean and pure. \n\nBusy night ahead. He parked his bike in front of the restaurant, then walked me to the car to unload the left overs, then we continued on foot to the gallery a few blocks down. \n\nWe ate well. He and I. We always did. While this might be his suggestion, it's now my new obsession.", "author": "Victoria E."}

To me, 3 stars implies that I would say \"it's OK\", but the honest truth is I would recommend strongly against friends coming here.  \n\nI'm a big sushi fan, and have spent a lot of time checking out the highest regarded sushi places in each city.  I'd say the best sushi I've had so far was at the Shiro sushi bar in Seattle.\n\nHere's the bullets:\n - Ordered 12 piece sashimi.  Wanted Omakasi but they were out (Sunday)\n\n - Sashimi was in the bottom half of sashimi I've had, but was not \"bad\".  Most of the sashimi didn't taste super fishy (good thing), but did have a stringy, almost chewy consistency (bad thing).  Good salmon, for example, tends to melt in your mouth, while this salmon was borderline chewy.  Not terrible, but not good.  3 stars on the sashimi plate.\n\n - The thing that really pushed me from 3 stars to 2 stars was the Toro.  Toro is my favorite kind of nigiri or sashimi.  Toro is a relatively hard to find, fatty, buttery, delicious tuna.  It's a bit more expensive than other types of fish: I've seen it range up to 30 bucks and as low as 12 bucks for nigiri.  Here it was 12.\n\nUsually toro is \"melt in your mouth\" fatty and buttery.  I still fantasize about the toro I had at Shiro.\n\nKama's toro was EASILY the worst I've ever had.  It had the correct texture: fatty and buttery.  However, the flavor was not smooth at all: it had a fishy, borderline chlorinated flavor to it that made me wonder if it was even safe to eat.  It was genuinely gross and I would not be surprised to find out that I feel sick tomorrow.  My \"best case\" here is it tasted bad because it was Sunday and they were about to throw it out.  However, I'd say it's borderline negligent that they're serving toro that tastes THIS fishy and bad.\n\n - My table also ordered some rolls.  The lobster roll was actually super tasty.  If you're STRICTLY coming here for rolls, I'd say that some of these rolls are in the 3 or 4 star range.\n\nTl;dr: Some of the rolls were pretty good.  If you're only into rolls, not a terrible choice.  The sashimi was in the bottom half of sashimi I've had, and the toro was borderline gross.", "author": "Casey P."}

However, in an effort to be more conscientious of my spending and to fulfill my sushi craving, I decided to go for Chinese sushi aka jive ass rolls (coined by Nobu K) last week.\n\nKama Sushi in SoMa was my choice since they seem to have very good reviews (second location is in Noe Valley).  I even bought a $25 restaurant.com gift certificate for $10.  Whoo Hooo, my mom would be proud of me!!! The problem is the reviews are a bit deceiving. If you take a closer look, you will find that most of the 5 star reviews are for their ramen only and not their sushi. As for those 5 star reviews claiming their sushi is authentic and legit; Kama Sushi is anything but authentic; not at this location at least. Sorry but Chinese sushi is NOT authentic  sushi (I'm not hating on my peoples either). Go to Ino, Koo, Okina,  Kazu  or Tekka for the real deal. \n\nOriginally I was going to stick with jive ass rolls since they're good, cheap fillers but I couldn't resist their blackboard specials (a sushi restaurant's seasonal specials).

This is something I rarely order at sushi restaurants but Mr. NSS just had to order this. I'm glad he did. The Pork Belly Skewers were a close second except it was lacquered with salt. Though all the Nigiri looked beautiful, they all tasted the same...STALE. No butteryness whatsoever so the fish was definitely not fresh. The Foxy Roll was atrocious (this was Mr. NSS' pick). The sweet mango along with the sweetness from the unagi sauce made it taste like a sushi dessert. GROSS. The Crunchy Lobster Roll as recommended by Yelpers tasted like eating stale tempura flakes with mayo. The tempura flakes were not crunchy and were probably fried early in the week and kept in a bag for later use. \n\nThe food was a bust but the service wasn't. The staff was very friendly and attentive. A fly flew into our sushi (while sitting at the sushi bar) and the staff was very apologetic. They replaced the tainted nigiri and gave another piece on the house for the mishap. Even though the food was  2 stars, I was going to bump up my rating to 3 stars just because of the service.

The rolls weren't bad and definitely on the better side. However the flavors just didn't wow me like I expected it to. My roommate also thought the scallop spoon appetizer was a little too much on the citrus side for her.

Everything I ordered was off the happy hour menu so it was $5 or less except for the salmon Kama.\n\nThe sushi was nice and fresh and they put nice big pieces of fish on their nigiri. The skewers came with this amazing sweet miso paste that I ended up putting on almost everything. Lastly the salmon Kama was excellent, the meat was juicy and tender and the skin was nice and crispy, very well done. \n\nOverall I spent $35 dollars on mostly happy hour items so the food can get expensive, then again I think I ordered a lot for one person as well so don't let that deter you.

It's a far walk from my work, but when I'm craving ramen this is my go to.  I've been here at least 10 times now, and the reason for the poor rating is due to their service.\n\nUsually we sit in the front entrance area where 2 people tables are located.  I ALWAYS feel rushed and cramped in there.  I get it, it's a small restaurant that gets busy... but it's small, so there's no reason customers should not be checked on. \n\nThe most recent time I was there, I came with 3 coworkers and we were sitting in the back booth area.  I was excited thinking we have more \"personal\" space.   It was a nightmare... we sat for 15 minutes waiting to order... I had to get up and ask a waiter to take our order.  The man with the mullet hair said \"one second ok we are busy\".\n\nNEVER TELL A CUSTOMER YOU ARE BUSY - It's just plain rude.  At least APOLOGIZE and be polite.  I felt like he was talking down to me.\n\nAfter that... food came quickly but my ramen was cold?  Now getting the check.. that was an obstacle in it's own.  My group and the group in front of us were complaining that no one was coming to check on us... we needed to pay and leave!  We were the only 2 groups back there..  Every time we would waive someone down or say \"excuse me\" they would quickly scurry away.  My colleague this time got up to ask for our payment back..  it was just sitting there along with 5 other payments UN ATTENDED.   \n\nAs much as i love their ramen...  they're service needs vast improvement.

My date thoroughly enjoyed her dish despite my unspoken observations. My Tonkatsu Ramen, which I ordered at full hot spicy was delicious. My one negative observation specific to the ramen dish was the pork was thinly sliced, and it fell apart in the broth, unlike the thicker pork loin slices I have had elsewhere - not ideal presentation.

The $10 for $20 drew me in, and imagine my surprise when I found out that checking in gets us a free small hot sake, too! Jackpot!\n\nMy boyfriend and I had spent an evening braving the cold weather of SF, so we were feeling like a bowl of hot ramen to warm us up. We chanced upon Kama Sushi through Yelp, and my goodness. We were so pleased with what we found.\n\nFirst off, the establishment is cozy yet gives you enough space to enjoy your meal. Everything is clean and fresh, and the wait staff is among some of the friendliest I've ever encountered. We walked in craving ramen, so ramen is what we ordered. I had the Chicken Karaage with soy broth -- for your spicy lovers, you can spice up your ramen for an extra $1! I wimped out this time and took my ramen sans spicy. We both gobbled up our ramen in no time at all, and everything was perfect. The noodles were chewy and plentiful, the extras were generously portioned, and the broth was flavorful. All for $8!\n\nAnd just when we thought we were finished, our waiter took the time to chat with us a bit to ask how we liked everything. We quickly divulged to him how much we loved our ramen. Delighted at our positive responses, he asked the trigger question that sent me over the edge.\n\n\"Would you like to try some sushi while you're here?\"\n\nOh man, WOULD I?! But of course, you can't make yourself seem too excited. That's too easy of a sell. I had to contain myself and calmly nod my head and say yes as my boyfriend looked at me and knew that even he couldn't fight my sushi weakness.\n\nThe waiter's recommendation? Sake narami. What is that, you ask? It's like toro but for salmon instead of tuna. What is toro, you ask? Only the most delicious part of the tuna fish -- the belly! So, in short, sake narami is the salmon belly, which is something that I've seen only in their restaurant. And it was DELICIOUS. It melted in my mouth just like toro would. The waiter came back with more recommendations (their specials are actually all listed on a blackboard above the sushi bar), but I just had to say no because I was stuffed.\n\nSo, in short?\n-- Yelp deal = good deal and good excuse to try Kama Sushi out\n-- Don't forget to check in for free hot sake!\n-- Craving ramen? You'll find good stuff here!\n-- Black board above the sushi bar is your treasure map of sushi\n\nAhhh, drooling just thinking about this place... time to wipe the drool off and head to the city for some sushi!", "author": "Yvonne K."}

The uni unfortunately was not fresh or top quality. After I started to eat it, I was overcome by an unpleasant taste in my mouth.  The taste reminded me of the uni that is sold in the local Korean market in Oakland rather than to Tokyo Fish Market. \n\nWe both found the ika sukatayaki sauce too sweet.

It is not the place if you want an authentic izakaya experience.\n\nOne recommendation is the Mochi wrapped in bacon -- well done and highlight of our orders! The mochi was softened and almost melty like cheese inside the crispy bacon wrap, which makes this dish very fun.\n\n\nWe also ordered shishito peppers, wagyu beef skewer, and grilled yellowtail. They were all average but I wouldn't call it amazing. Yellowtail was grilled a bit dry.\n\nLastly, deep-fried green tea ice cream -- it wasn't the best green tea ice cream inside, although the warm, crunchy deep-fried crust will destract you anyways~", "author": "Ida L."}

Lunch specials are always good deals, but it's not like the restaurants in Japantown that give California rolls with the specials - only avocado and cucumber rolls (which are sort of bland). The katsu curry rice is good. \n\nI tried the crunch lobster that everyone raves about - the crunchy stuff was really good, but you could only rave about it so much. The sushi itself was alright. The grilled squid was also alright - wasn't really tasty or flavoring. I might have just had a bad experience that day. \n\nThey also give free edamame (not salted or anything) to anyone who sits down. Presentation of the food is on point though. I love their unique plates and bowls.", "author": "Annie D."}

Happy Hour was especially interesting this last time.\n\nThe 49er role is one my favorite rolls in the city.  The sashimi and nigiri is always fresh. Recently we enjoyed the Tofu Salad which is very large and tasty.\n\nKama is a fantastic value for pretty high grade sushi.  You can pay more elsewhere but the extra cost is not linear to the extra quality.  Unless you are really trying to impress someone, this is as good of a place as any in SF.\n\nPS - I would stay away from the Hot Mama and Hot Papa rolls.

When I brought it to the attention of the server, he was hesitant to acknowledge that my chicken was raw, didn't even apologize and just asked me if I wanted more chicken?!\n\nI got some hand rolls and and special rolls (non happy hour), simply put, they skimp on ingredients like no other. I ordered a mango roll with unagi and there was mostly well, nothing. A sliver of avocado, some slivers of unagi and bam mango filler in the middle... Quite disappointing. \n\nFinally, the restaurant tried to pull a fast one on us. My group was at least 8 of us who ordered tons of nigri, rolls etc, so what happened was that they ended up charging us for sushi we didn't have... we had to bring it up to their attention and they questioned our honesty.  Then they accused us for receiving food already when we asked where our missing food was. I was really disappointed by the unprofessional and borderline rudeness of the staff. (Maybe our server wasn't the greatest communicator, but if so, why not bring your manager out?) \n\nThe Verdict: I definitely won't be coming back because of the quality and value of the food and especially the way the staff handled our service.

The ramen also comes with 2 pieces of veggie gyoza, but I really enjoyed the gyoza so the next time I came, I decided to get a whole order. This gyoza was less gingery than others that I've tried and I really liked that about them. It's a good appetizer to share!

We were headed to a bar in SOMA on Saturday when I realized I was damn hungry, and needed some sustenance before embarking on a night of drinking! We walked right by this place, quickly yelped it, saw the 4-star rating, and decided why not (hard to pass up sushi). However, the experience was overall a bit disappointing.\n\nIf you check-in on Yelp you get a free small hot sake. So great, I love free stuff. Even when it's not good stuff in and of itself, you can't really complain, because hell, it was FREE. Still, the sake was pretty bad. Now I will completely admit I'm not a huge fan of sake to begin with, and even less of a fan of hot sake, because I feel like the hot temperature is just disguising the fact that it's really poor quality alcohol. Well yep, this sake pretty much fit the bill. They also give every table edamame, which is a nice touch. But unlike the sake, the edamame were stone cold, and I personally prefer them a bit warm! Picky, picky, I know.\n\nWe ordered 4 sushi rolls and I also got a miso soup. The miso tasted the same as every other miso soup I've ever had, which is to say great - assuming you like miso. The roles were...meh. We got the Foxy roll which was unagi (my fav) and mango inside, avocado and tuna on top. I didn't taste a speck of mango, and I was sort of excited about that part. The tuna on top tasted a bit like refrigerator. We also got a California roll with real crab (standard and decently good) and the shrimp tempura roll, which was also okay. The worst was the spicy tuna. I only had one piece - it was bad enough I didn't want to come back for a second. The tuna was the kind where they  mash it up rather than put a whole piece of tuna in there, so that's not my preference to begin with. The quality/taste of the fish was also not up to par.\n\nThe other downside is that the tables for 2 are so closely squished together it's impossible not to overhear the entire conversation of the tables on either side. It's also very difficult to get in and out of your seat if you're on the booth side.\n\nI was debating between a 2 and 3 star rating, but the service was very good in the end, so went for a 3.

Been to here a couple of times now, and wasn't disappointed either of the times. First time I went with a large group (~10 people), and we were able to reserve a table to fit all of us. We got a variety of rolls and a couple of the teriyaki entrees. I thoroughly enjoyed all of the rolls that they served as well as their teriyaki meats. \n\nThey also have a pretty neat check-in offer going on right now, whereby you get either a small or large serving of hot sake if you have party of 2 or greater than 3 for the latter.\n\nThe second time I visited Kama we were able to reserve a table for 3 for 7PM at ~5:30PM on a Friday night, and they were definitely busy by 7, nice of them to allow reservations despite a full house.", "author": "David C."}

This place is passable only for cooked sushi and other cooked dishes but for sashimi and other raw fishes, I would avoid it. \n\nThe dinner combo is pretty good. No complaints about the  teriyaki chicken at all. All of the cooked rolls are still very tasty but going to a sushi restaurant means eating raw fish, at least for me. When it comes to raw fish, this place should be avoided. None of the sashimi or nigiri tasted/looked fresh at all. Personally it's very difficult to tell the difference between amazing sashimi and great sashimi, but it's very easy to tell if sashimi is fresh or not.

Wouldn't the world be a better place if more Yelp reviews began with a theme song?)\n\nAaaaaanyway, Kama surprised both me and my boyfriend. I'd just received some bad news and my boyfriend wanted to take me out to dinner to cheer me up. Since I believe all of the world's problems can be solved by ramen (and Popeyes), I decided a nice, hot bowl of noodles in soup was exactly what I needed. We were too tired and hungry to make a long trip out to a ramen-only joint, Kama happened to be conveniently located, so that's where we wound up.\n\nMy ramen (tonkotsu pork broth with bamboo shoots, mushrooms, corn, pork and spicy chili pepper flakes (add $1 for that)) came out no more than 5 minutes after we'd placed our orders. We were assured my boyfriend's would be out soon. He encouraged me to start eating first, so I did. The broth was nothing too spectacular, but the noodles were perfectly-cooked: chewy and al dente, just the way I like it. The pork was tender and delicious. \n\nHowever, 15 minutes went by and they still hadn't brought anything else out, while people who had arrived much later than us had already received all their orders. Eventually, I flagged down another guy and asked what was going on, and he promised he'd look into it. He never got back to us. I know because I could see him standing by the host's podium avoiding us.\n\nFinally, our server came back to reassure us the ramen would be out soon. We reminded him about the hamachi carpaccio appetizer we'd also ordered and never received. He said he'd talk to the sushi chefs, who I could plainly see were standing around doing nothing. The ramen and carpaccio eventually arrived, but by then, it had been about 20 minutes after we'd placed our orders.\n\nThe carpaccio was just okay, mostly because the hamachi was very obviously not fresh. My boyfriend had also gotten the tonkotsu ramen but without spicy chili flakes. It was piping hot and delicious, definitely just made. Despite that satisfaction, he asked our waiter what the hold-up had been. The waiter stammered some kind of gibberish response, which confirmed my suspicion that the kitchen had forgotten our orders (I know it wasn't the waiter's fault because I saw him record our order and give it to the kitchen). Without this incident, Kama would have merited 4 stars for the food, but I'm docking a star for the mix-up and the staff's inability to be honest with us about it. \n\nWith so many other ramen options in the city, I'm afraid that where Kama is concerned, it's just going to be a one-time \"come and goooo, I come and go-o-oooooo\" (too cheesy?).", "author": "Josephine L."}

It didn't suck, but this was the epitomy of mediocrity.\n\nI wanted Ramen, this is the 2nd time I have gone here for Ramen. The first time I saw Karaage Ramen on the menu and thought it was a great idea and I blamed myself for ordering stupidly, when it was Totally mediocre.\n\nThis time I went for Spicy Tonkotsu pretty straight forward, classic Ramen. Mediocre beyond words. The key to good Tonkotsu Ramen is the soup has to be a rich velvety symphony of porky goodness. The soup tasted like Campbells chicken noodle.\n\nThe egg was hard boiled, not soft boiled, which is another key to delicious ramen. I will confess that its pretty food-snobby to demand a soft custardy yolk, but if you want 5 stars from me, thats what it takes. What really sucked about the egg was that the center was cold, and not like not hot, like straight out of the refrigerator cold.\n\nMoving on, the Char siu was a little off too, one slice tasted kind of spoiled, another was completely drenched in 5 spice powder. Inconsistent would be the nicest thing  I could say about it.\n\nNoodles were a little overcooked and completely blah.\n\nOne last thing, and this is sort of a personal taste thing, but WTF is with corn in Tonkotsu Ramen? Miso Flavor? OK. Salt flavor? OK. Butter Corn Ramen? Absolutely! Yum! But Tonkotsu? Hmm, I don't think so.\n\nOK so the Ramen was not spectacular. I do want to say that it did not suck. It was not per se, \"Bad Ramen\" I have had bad ramen in my life and this definitely was not that bad. If There was a massive earthquake and everything south of San Bruno was inaccessible, I might order Ramen from here again, otherwise I'd rahter head down to San Mateo for exceptional Ramen at any of the many fine shops there.\n\nOn a more positive note, We also ordered some Ankimo and Yakiniku (butabarra and bacon wrapped mochi) All of which were great. I also had a Asahi Draft which was cold and foamy as it should be. Service was OK.

And I usually discover them in the most unexpected of ways. \n\nI had no idea what to expect before coming into Kama Sushi and the neighborhood certainly didn't help swing my opinion favorably (it's in the shady part of SOMA fyi). However, I was completely sold from the second we entered. The place is small, intimate and cozy with a strong bamboo/woodsy vibe. And our waitress was one of the friendliest women I've met. She was very helpful with our decision making process, made some great recommendations and was extremely attentive. \n\nI was initially hesitant to order Ramen at a Sushi spot but did so anyway as it looked rather enticing on a windy and cold night - totally stacks up to one of the best decisions I've made this month! The Ramen is remarkable and entirely unlike any other Ramen I've had before. The flavor is unique, spicy and creative - I could seriously live off this broth for days! And the pork meat is so tender, fatty and juicy, mmm. \n\nI also highly recommend the Crunchy Lobster, the Hot Mama and the Hot Papa rolls. As a specialty roll craver, I was beyond satisfied with how delectable these cheesy, baked and fried rolls were. \n\nThe highlight of the meal, however, was in our wine of choice - the plum wine. Oh dear lord this is a haven for dessert wine lovers. They even threw in actual plums in our glasses! \n\nI highly recommend this hidden treasure for dates and intimate gatherings with friends - it's a bit on the quieter side which is perfect to actually hear what your counterparts are saying and engage in great conversation. \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

It was bland and seemed like chicken powder broth with the salad type veggies. I came make this at home for $1.00.\n\nBento box ($9.95): Spicy tuna had no flavor (wasn't even spicy) and the quality of the fish was not good. Chicken tariyaki was a very small and very thin strips drowned in sauce. \n\nLemon Hama ($12.95): This was the only reason why I gave this place one extra star. This roll was actually really good. The lemon was very refreshing. The items altogether was very compatible. \n\nAfter the guy took our order and left, I decided to pour soy sauce for my friend and myself. I lifted the saucer, placed it in front of me, picked up the soy sauce container and poured the soy sauce into my friend's saucer. Something started moving and I flipped out! There was a cockroach moving in his saucer. I quickly called the server and had him remove that saucer out of our table. The manager or owner came rushing to our table and apologized. He asked if we were still comfortable eating here and we were both hesitant, but stayed anyways. The manager said things like that never happened here before and that he can't change what happened, but was willing to give us drinks on the house and 20% off our meal. We said ok because our lunch hour was nearly over and couldn't afford to look for another place to eat.\n\nThe whole time during our meal, we were very uneasy. We kept wondering if any other cockroaches will pop up or ended up in our meal.

But, I am not Anti-Chinese, it may sound like it, and it is true that I am Anti- Chinese Gov, only because human rights issue, also there are many rude Chinese waitresses. That's true too.\nI have been sayin' that most Chinese own Japanese places are simply bad especially when it comes to Sushi because most places are not clean, but service is SUPER-Nice-Friendly, it freaks me out, and fish isn't good, and rice isn't right.\n\nThe place isn't traditional set-up, it isn't Sushi-only place like all traditional Japanese/Japanese Sushi places that I like. \n\nAs most Chinese own Japanese restaurants, you can get almost every typical Japanese dish.\nSo, I dislike a place like here.\nBut, there is something about Kama-Sushi.\nKama Sushi is very clean. include bathroom. That's something already special and totally different than any other Chinese restaurants. \n\nI had Saba-Nigiri, it was lightly bbqed, it means the chef does know \"Saba\" is very difficult to prepare and lightly bbq get rid of smelly fishy flavor and gets nice smoky rich flavor.  \n\nMaguro was nice cut.\n\nTamago was good.\n\nI did not ask any more for Sushi because I knew after I had the 3 items, Saba, Maguro and Tamago, those 3 items are my basic Sushi to judge how the Sushi-Chef does for my first time.\n\nThe Chef, OK, Pass.\n\nAnyone can make any Jiveass-roll and taste all the same with the red-hot sauce, BBQ ell, avocado and salmon + Maguro, what ever it is.\nYou don't need to be a Sushi-Chef, ANYONE CAN MAKT THE SHIT.\n\nWhy don't you put some oranges, watermelon in, and donuts, Yeah, how about donuts to go with it and deep fried? I bet you Paula Deen would love that shit.\nOh, I hate Jiveass-rolls crap!\n\nSo, i know nothing for any \"Signature Rolls\" in the menu.\nThe \"Signature Rolls\" means Jiveass Rolls in my Sushi dictionary.\nI didn't order any of it, but I know the Chef understands the basic Nigiri that most Non-Japanese Sushi places don't.\n\nAbout the Ramen.\nIn the menu said that:\nTonkotsu Ramen, Pork or Soy flavor.\nI was like, \"WTF?\" because THERE IS NOT SUCH A THING IN JAPAN.\nPork or Soy flavor?\n\"Tonkotsu\" means Tonkotsu-Flavor, period!\n\nBut, what can we do? I had the Soy flavor kind of Tonkotsu Ramen for First time.\nI am pretty sure that the ramen is instant, from Japanese market, high end kind, because taste so familiar. I am sure of it.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/instant-ramen-san-francisco-2#hrid:Fiwz4tNuob4ska1-_ocI5A/src:self\n\nBut, the Chef add fresh ginger to go with the \"high-end\" instant Ramen's Soup. I didn't mind the Ramen because the Chashu was very good and thin sliced, egg was nicely done half cooked.\nThey have to make a profit and stay on the business so I understand that the Chef doesn't have enough time to get the Ramen from scratch. So using good high-end instant Ramen maybe a good idea.\nIt was not too bad.\n\nThe Fried Chicken was good as Popeye's! \nIt was really \"surprise!\" kind of fried chicken. Nothing fancy but really good as real Popeye's like. I don't think it's from Popeye's. I don't care, I liked it.\n\nService was professional- good.\nWe got extended happy hour deal. that was nice!\nThe Kama Sushi is more like Good-Izakaya with a little bit of Sushi like place.\nI think the Chef and manager are well trained, and managing very well to find what is best but keep reasonable price.\nI liked it.\nBut,\nAm I going back?\nNot.", "author": "Nobu K."}

My all time favorite.......................... is still Ramen Dojo.  However, we can only work with what we got in the City without having to drive 1/2 hr away to get really good ramen.\n\nThe broth was exquisite, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the ingredients are all inclusive.  You know how some Japanese ramen houses charges you for ala cart items like corn, mushroom, egg, seaweed etc.  This place does not do that. I love that!!!!   Upon arrival of the bowl, it looked messy.  The corn, mushroom, lettuce(yes lettuce) sea weed, and the katsu chicken just looked like a pile of mess and the broth wasn't up to the level it should be in terms of broth to noodle ratio.  Presentation was somewhat lacking but they sure made up for it with taste and flavor.  They do charge an extra dollar for having it extra spicy.  \n\nI bought the yelp deal and if you check in you get a free bottle of hot sake.  Service was attentive, food came out a little slow but I guess that's how it is on your first month in the new location.  \n\nI would definitely come back  here for their ramen.  Plenty of parking spaces, the place felt and looked clean, service was great, price is very reasonable.\n\nI will be back to try the sushi.  To be honest, my expectation is not too high on their sushi but they shocked me once with their Ramen.", "author": "jason g."}

It is on the left hand corner of 9th and Folsom so for parking considerations be aware of the one way streets there. \n\nWe were geeted warmly by a server when we walked in. There is no hostess area so don't feel awkward about standing in the middle of the resturant waiting to be sat. \n\nPrice range is reasonable for the city. Expect around 12 dollars a roll 14 dollars for the lunches and ramens. \n\nI looooved this place because they do no over load the rolls with rice, use real wasabi, do not dye their ginger, and use fresh fresh fish. When the salmon basically melts in your mouth you know you are getting a good piece of meat. The decor was alos nice without being garish or too plain. I think there was another room but I didn't walk into that area of the resturant. Was relativly busy at lunch time but we didn't feel like we had a \"wait\" for anything.\n\nHands down best miso I have had to date as well. I would return just for the miso.

We also tried the grilled whole squid. Very tasty. I was even impressed by the complementary edamame -- if you've ever try boiling edamame yourself you know how easy it is to overcook -- but those they served here were just done right, not over, not under; and the taste of salt was just right, not over, not under.

I am so glad I was craving ramen and I am so glad that Yelp led my girlfriend and me to your establishment!! Definitely a good choice.\n\nLet's talk about the pros:\n+ There was a Yelp deal ($10 for a $20 voucher) going on for this place (awesome. snagged one right as we walked in). Basically gave us the food half off. \n+ You get one free hot sake for just checking into Yelp. EXTRA BROWNIE POINTS!\n+ Ramen was delicious (not too flavorful and overpowering, but just right. I recommend the Tonkotsu with soy broth). Also, EXCELLENT price for just $8 each bowl.\n+ Complimentary edamame is a good free treat for when you're drinking sake and starting to get munchies. (Maybe I was just super hungry)\n+ Staff was friendly\n+ The \"specials\" for sushi they have are all on the board at the sushi bar and not in the menu. These specials are supposedly all Kama Sushi originals and have their own twist. I HIGHLY recommend trying some of these. We tried a couple and they were both incredibly delicious. (I forget what they are called, sorry.) The waiter suggested them for us, so you can ask for suggestions!\n\nCons:\n- Good sushi adds up in cost. Beware if you're coming here for sushi only. There are better places for loading up on sushi. \n- Really don't have many cons here... haha. The yelp deals really added so much sugar on this deal.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION:\nGet a bowl of ramen (tonkotsu with soy broth) and then one or two of the specials on the sushi board at the sushi bar. You won't regret it. The ramen will fill you up and the sushi will be yummy treats for your taste palette to savor.

I know that's a bit late, but I had just gotten off work and a girl's gotta eat, yo!   We weren't seated right away because it was pretty packed.  No big deal--usually that's a good sign, right?  hmmm, yeah right.\n\nWhen we were finally shown to our table we asked if we could get hot saki.  We were told that they stop serving alcohol at 9PM. Say wha..?  I'm sure that's not by choice, but really?  Anyway, okay, we'll settle for tea.  BUT, it never came..  I would have asked again but our server just disappeared...??\n\nWe waited...and waited ......and waited... 20 mins later, just before we were going to get up and walk out, a different server came to take our order.  Did the other server get off and forget to tell her replacement that there was a table waiting??  No one glanced our way to noticed we hadn't been helped?  I couldn't even make eye contact to get anyone's attention.  C'mon guys...\n\nThe food was just okay... I had one of the specialty rolls, the Fujimoto I think?  It was forgettable.  I also ordered the salmon tower and there were little bits of tin foil stuck on the fish (I know you're thinking \"um, it was probably skin!\"  No. No, it wasn't.).  Have you ever accidently chewed on tin foil?  Crrringgge... my teeth hurt just thinking about it.  I was so disappointed because that was my fav dish at the other location.  \n\nWe might have enjoyed it more but the service was so abissmal it put a bad taste in my mouth.  And I had NO sake to wash it away. boo.\n\nThe sashimi my boyfriend ordered was really fresh and tasty, so I'll give them that...+1 star\n\nSorry but I won't be giving this place another try when I can go to the Noe Valley location and recieve better service.

No wait, good service, good food. \n\nI came back a second time today and their happy hour prices drove me here. It's a really good deal ($4.95 apps, $3.45 nigiri) and the selections are plentiful. I'm a huge fan of The One Sushi in Hayes Valley which has comparably priced items for their happy hour. \n\nThe food this time was just ok. We got the albacore tataki (good), vegetable tempura (good but the veggie selection was limited), tuna poki (just ok. Really salty and didn't finish it; poki at The One is much better), spicy tuna roll (good), ika karage (soggy, greasy but the dipping sauce was tasty), and some nigiri (sake, hamachi, walu). The walu was nice to see on a happy hour menu and was cut well. \n\nThe food was good but not great. I wouldn't be opposed to coming here again with a group but I wouldn't suggest it as a great place for sushi in the city.

I made sure to get the Miso Sea Bass hot appy, and it was awesome. Portions were nice. The Walu, Hamachi, Maguro tuna, Unagi... all solid! Oh... loved loved loved the \"AgeDashi\" Tofu hot appy.

We often eat out for Japanese food 2 -3 times/week ( at least ) We have heard of this place so we thought let's give it a try.  We went there last night,  we were there around almost 9 and the restaurant wasn't busy. The server put us into a small table (table for 2) It seems like they really be crumbs about the chair. If you only 2, you won't be able to get a bigger table. \nThe reason I mentions about this because we always order a lots of dishes, and we both know that it won't be enough space for us to put other stuff.\n\nI asked the server about the drink menu, but she said to me that we are just stop serving alcohol (but wait...It's only 9 pm?) I asked her again why..she said we don't have license. That made me confused...Don't get me wrong I am not american born here so English is not my first language too but for what I talked with her...It's really confused. Later on, we were be able to order hot sake...Yahoo...yum yum with sushi.\n\nHowever, our foods were really good but they came into really small portion ( like sushi or nigari) We got another service from another server, this person was poor service though. She tried to make everything quick even though I was still eating my soup but she almost took it away from me. And when the bill came, we showed her a coupon to her through the phone. She did click something on the phone very quickly and the code was gone. I told her It wasn't our mistake but she wasn't happy though.\n\nAnyway, all I can say is 3 stars for overall.  I had a better experience real Japanese food than this place.", "author": "Sasitorn O."}

I don't think the hubs and I have ever let a free bowl of edamame go unfinished but that one did.  \n\nBased on the yelp reviews we ordered the whole squid, the crunchy lobster roll, bacon wrapped shrimp and shrimp tempura.\n\nThe shrimp tempura was ok but nothing special (try North Beach Sushi if you want memorable tempura).  The bacon wrapped shrimp was fine but that's a pretty hard dish to mess up.\n\nThe whole squid could have been good if they chose to feature the nicely cooked squid instead of covering it with a sickly sweet teriyaki-like (although it had an additional odd flavor neither of us could put our finger on) sauce that basically made the whole thing inedible.  \n\nThe crunchy lobster roll was also really disappointing.  Barely any lobster, a mound of tempura flakes, and the salmon did not seem very fresh.  Another dish we didn't bother finishing. \n\nI went straight for some gum after we left because I needed to get the taste from that nasty sauce on the squid out of my mouth.", "author": "wingless g."}

There was plenty of seating available (possible sign?) The atmosphere inside the restaurant is pretty nice and has plenty of seating for big groups (giving an extra star for this). At our table, since we were seated in the back, has a light switch that you press on once you're ready to order which is pretty cool and the good things of this place end right about here. \n\nLets go on to the so-so things. The happy hour menu is decent for vegetarians but I wasn't expecting much so it is okay. As for rolls, your only options are the cucumber avocado and the tempura sweet potato rolls. The regular menu has more vegetarian options but I didn't order off it so can't comment on the taste or quality. Some other vegetarian options on the happy hour menu are vegetable gyoza, tempura, fried eggplant, some fried tofu thing, and korokke (croquette). I ordered the cucumber avocado and vegetable gyoza. The roll tasted normal (but it is pretty hard to mess up rice, avocado, and cucumber) and it was my first time trying gyoza so I don't have anything to compare it to. It tasted decent though, nothing spectacular. \n\nAnd lastly, lets go on to the bad things. I ordered the korokke and it never came out so I ended up canceling it since we were all done eating. The server didn't apologize for never bringing it out and just said \"okay\". My friends ordered stuff that never came but they still insisted that it came out and we must have eaten it. Needless to say we canceled those orders pretty quickly. My friend ordered this chicken thing (hey, this is as specific as I can get) and part of it came out pink (I was told that this means raw). Even I know raw chicken can be no good. She told the server and he did apologize but that was the extent of it. A good place would've sent another item from the menu or taken it out of the bill but neither of those happened. We were too tired and frustrated with the experience to even argue about it. When the bill came out, we were charged for things that we never ended up getting (good thing we checked!). \n\nThe server wasn't rude and he did try to accomodate a relatively large group so we were happy about that. We, however, weren't happy with the mess in ordering. I know it can be tough to keep track of all the orders of a large group but I'm sure we weren't the first big group to come here and I'm sure won't be the last. He did kind of apologize about all the mistakes when the bill came out but by the then, we were too tired to care. \n\nEven though we spent a lot of money here, we left still feeling hungry and that is never a good sign.

The Udon descriptions said \"pork flavored\" not pork broth, or chicken broth so I was not sure what that meant. Also there were a lot of references to \"crab stick\",  but not a lot of clarity whether this was real crab or imitation crab in many of the rolls. Frankly I wish they called imitation crab whatever it really is, but at least label it.\n\nPlace is pricey for the neighborhood, but about average for SF.\n\n\"Specials\" come with salad, My salad was dotted with curled dissicated leaves, some of the salad was ok, but clearly the greens were not well managed. Topped with some Cosco type carrot strips. For an almost $10 lunch could you grate an inch of fresh carrot from an organic source?\n\nI ordered the fried shrimp curry special.\n\nBest part of the meal were the shrimp, these were fresh, lightly fried and great.\n\nCurry was tasty but overabundant and very gloppy, seemed poured from a can. Don't order the curry. \n\nRice was aboundant but odd. The grains were huge, normally in a sushi restaurant they use a finer grain sushi rice.\n\nI ordered a 'coke', got a diet coke, and they argued with me about that, even though the waiter clearly repeated my beverage order. They serve it in a fluted glass, probably get a lot less than a normal amount. Pretty but geez how do you turn \"coke\" into \"diet coke\"? They did take the $1.50 off my bill.\n\nPeople to the right of me ordered sushi and they seemed to like it, but did not finish it. Sushi is also made with this huge rice so the rolls come out oversized.\n\nIf I return I will try the sushi without the salad or other stuff, but considering how many options for this type of food in SF and how many other options at less money in the same neighborhood it will be a while.\n\nThe atmosphere is dank, trying to be trendy, comes off wanting. TV blaring from a mount so high no one could see it, more like a bar. Staff stands together watching the door, but service is minimal, contact with customers edgey.

We were driving to Infusion lounge and wanted to get a quick bite before rolling in and thanks to the trusty Yelp app, I found this gem. We were thrilled that they offered a yelp deal AND a yelp check in deal. The yelp deal was $10 for $20 worth and checkin was free bottle of sake. Even though I prefer cold sake, hot free sake will do. The folks were generous and even gave us TWO bottles of free sake. The price and quality of food was terrific even before the discount.

My coworker enjoyed the pork ramen loaded with tons of toppings and noodles. The only negative was that it took 15 mins to take our order, but the free edamame did help the time pass while waiting.

The place was about half full on the main side.  Endamames and water glasses were brought to the table right away, but I have to agree with other reviewers, the endamames were cold and bland.\nMy friend lit up when he noticed that they had live scallops on the special board, but was told that they were out.  I checked the specials one last time on our way out, and no one had bothered to remove them.  Makes me wonder if they had them in the first place or were just trying to show themselves as a better restaurant.  The waiter did recommend several other things, one of which was finally chosen (forgive me, I don't remember what it was).  He did also order the lamb chops small plate and was very pleased with it.\nI had the wakame salad and the Jo Sushi Dinner.  Both were very good.  The salad was tender for seaweed, unlike most places were it's like chewing on a sesame flavored rubber tire.  The dinner was just enough food for me as I was not very hungry, coming with miso soup, five pieces of nigiri and your choice of spicy tuna roll or California roll (as I am allergic to cucumber I went with the California).  All of the fish was fresh and tasty, the rice was well made, and everything held together from plate to mouth.\nThe waiters were attentive, made sure our glasses were never empty until we were done, and were friendly.  I did have a yelp certificate and they were more then happy to take care of us even with it (I have heard that some places out there seem to \"shut down\" once you let them know you have such a deal, yelp or not.  Not the case here!).\nOverall, I am very pleased with Kama.  Hopefully it was just an oversight with the specials board.

And, this would be the first time I've not finished sushi in my life. I ordered the toro nigiri which came unlike any toro I have ever ordered. It seemed like it had been seared and had some sort of sauce or glaze on it?!  Okay...  And, it was extremely tough to the point that i couldn't chew it. That would be the opposite of toro. I also ordered a special which was a spicy hamachi nigiri. Well, again, it seemed like it had been lightly seared and also had a glaze or sauce on it. Possibly that is how they serve the sushi here. No clue. I was expecting raw fish as well -- I ordered sushi. The yellowtail was fine and tender -- but after I ate it I remembered it was supposed to be spicy -- wasn't spicy at all. Strange. I started to wonder if I got somebody's else's order. I also ordered the Lemon Hama roll which was supposed to have asparagus in it -- no asparagus. (And Asparagus is big time in season as of writing this review.) Anyway, the roll was ok -- but again was glazed with some kind of dressing that made it kinda bland or oily in summary. I only ate about half of it as I got bored with the flavor. Regarding price, not sure why other reviewers are mentioning that this is a cheap alternative. The prices are on par with other sushi restaurants like this in SF. And, as I couldn't eat all of it for various reasons -- that made it more expensive.", "author": "Nate W."}

It also seems like they don't know what are acceptable cuts to serve. The pricey Toro they served me was seared (only place I've seen that sears Toro) and was incredibly chewy. It was chewy because it had clearly visible sinew. It's plain unacceptable to serve fish with sinew at a Sushi restaurant.", "author": "Thomas N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-23", "description": "The sushi was very fresh and tasty from every person at the table. We had the New York Roll, Phili Roll(2 orders) and 2 other rolls I forgot the names but I can describe it, one had raw quail egg and sea urchin(looked like smooth fried tofu skin) and the other had green fish eggs on top and I believe I heard our server call it \"butter fish\". We also had the tonkatsu ramen and a salmon mix plate. I shared the tonkatsu ramen with my daughter and sister-in-law and found that there was way too much ginger in it. My husband got the salmon mix plate and said it was very good and the presentation was very nicely done. We had the fried ice cream(this is HUGE American size and probably can share between 2 people) for dessert, fried goodness but the breading was just a little chalky. THE SERVICE WAS SPECTACULAR and I loved the glassware they used for the drinks, just added a nice touch. Our total bill for everything was about $170-WHOAH. That's the most I think I've ever seen on a sushi restaurant bill, but being that it's in SF and the sushi was the most exotic I've ever seen I guess that's why? I would recommend this place if you REALLY like good sushi.", "author": "Evangelyn Sacha J."}

But, from start to finish it was just bad.  The maguro and ebi had obviously been refrigerated and were at least a day old.  The spicy tuna maki was hours old -- not fresh and the aga dashi tofu was very old.  Overall -- dangerous place to go if they're serving food that's old.  When we complained they took everything off the check but what were they doing serving old food?  Even the edamame had seen better days -- maybe they made too much food for the Memorial Day weekend but that doesn't mean you get to try to kill your Tuesday customers with it.", "author": "Kathleen K."}

Within a few hours, I was overcome with the first signs of food poisoning, including sweating, burning-peppery taste sensations in my mouth and throat, extreme nausea, hives all over my torso, and severe abdominal cramps.  I was up all night vomiting and bed-ridden the next day.  I went on the Internet and come to learn that these symptoms are associated with seafood poisoning from tuna, which was a component in most of the items I ordered.  My dining companion was also stricken and missed work.  The restaurant refused to refund any of the money we spent ($150) and offered instead to comp a few items when we come back.  AS IF?!?  They also attempted to disclaim any liability by telling us that no one else complained about being poisoned.  Evidently, their business model requires their poisoned guests to be too sick or meek to complain.  Or, perhaps they want us to return to the dining area and announce that we are the guests who ate the spoiled tuna and are here to claim our free appetizer.  Shameful.", "author": "Joe Z."}

We ordered sushi, chirachi, tofu, soup noodles..etc  Assessing the customer service and the taste alone would probably merit the restaurant a 3 star rating.  However, the most disappointing part is that after I had the spicy tomkotsu ramen, I felt so thirsty the entire night that I kept on drinking water. I am not sure whether this was due to the excessive MSG or/and salt in the ramen. whatever it was, my eyes started to swollen at night and by the next morning, both of my eyes and the face were bloated.  i asked my friend who also had soup noodle that night.  She also felt she woke up the next day with swollen hands.

I waited for a good hour for a meager portion of sashimi. When the food did finally arrive, the rice was cold, and not at all the roughly body temperature that is ideal.

It's sad to see a restaurant that cannot even manage serving a few tables well.  On top of all of this, the employees were all incredibly rude and curt in their interactions.

The atmosphere is decent, the servers are friendly, and the nigori sake is served very cold.  On to the food:  the miso soup was decent - not impressive, but also not disappointing.  I ordered two rolls and one piece of nigiri.  I was there on a Thursday evening, and the restaurant was reasonably busy, but not completely full.  It took a while for the food to come out, and I think the chefs were aware that they were running slow, because they gave me a free Unagi nigiri - the highlight of the meal.  The unagi sauce is actually really good.  Everything else I ordered was actually pretty bland.  The hamachi slices used in the negihama were small, and appeared to be mixed with something a bit redder - perhaps maguro.  The spicy hamachi toro nigiri was not actually spicy.  The autumn roll was served with a tempura sauce, but would have benefitted from a bit of wasabi on the side.  Edamame was complimentary, but unsalted.  The prices were reasonable - about $35 for sake, miso, two rolls and one nigiri.  I just wish it was a bit more flavorful.  I won't be hurrying back, but also wouldn't say no to a repeat visit if someone else suggested it.", "author": "Miles B."}
