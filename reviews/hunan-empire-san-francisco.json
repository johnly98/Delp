Ordered delivery through the yelp app. Was given a 45-hour estimated time of delivery. 40-45 minutes later my doorbell rings and here is the food.\n\nI ordered the sesame chicken, walnut prawns and hot and sour soup. All of the dishes was still hot which is nice because nothing is worse then ordering delivery and the food shows up cold. All in all I can't say this is the best chinese food I have had but I could see myself ordering from them again. \n\nThank you Hunan for satisfying my chinese food craving!", "author": "Dmitriy G."}

The chicken was very tender, the sauce flavorful, and there was a lot of vegetables served with the steamed rice, and a side bowl of soup. \n\nGeneral Tsao Chicken: this dish was a disappointment. The flavor of the sauce was off, and there were only a few slices of carrots that were not completely steamed. This dish came with rice and a small bowl of soup, as well. \n\nOverall, when you come to San Francisco your mouth is already preparing itself to enjoy some completely outrageous tasting Chinese food.

While strolling the streets of San Fran, we were suddenly hit with a craving for some dim sum. We thought our cravings/prayers were answered when we saw the gleaming sign of Hunan Empire Restaurant.  They even had a sign out stating they had the \"World's Best Dim Sum.\" What a load of crap.\n\nThe moment you walk in, there was a weird vibe to the place. I've had my fair share of hole in the wall places, but this place was just something else. The place was dingy and old, table tops were sticky, and none of the utensils were clean. \n\nService? Totally nonexistent. \n\nFood? Bland and disgusting. \n\nHot tea? Not hot at all. I'm not even sure they boiled the tea kettle properly. I think our server just threw some tea leaves into lukewarm tap water and called it \"hot tea.\"\n\nShui Mai, which is usually my favorite item, turned out to be a disgusting ball of undercooked slimy ground meat. One bite and I almost threw up.\n\nHot & Sour Soup was neither hot nor sour, and it had a starchy taste to it. Definitely not a good thing when your soup feels thick and powdery.\n\nBBQ Pork Buns tasted like coconuts. No further explanation needed.\n\nFor what it's worth, the place hardly looked like it belonged in the restaurant business. It's hidden deep a commerce center on the first floor.  What seemed like an answer to our cravings was actually a curse in disguise, as we left this place with upset stomachs and the need to wash the disgusting tastes out of our mouths.", "author": "Daniel C."}

We had tried Andy's delivery and were grossed out. (by the polk st location- the geary one is tasty). Anyways, we had the bright, yet seemingly risky, idea to visit Empire Hunan. We had seen this crazy structure many times before and simply laughed at thought of a huge mall in the middle of the Marina.\n\nAnyways, we ventured in. It was around 6:15 and there were a few parties already seated, mostly finishing up their meals. Over the course of our meal quite a number of people came in for takeout orders. I never knew the place was so popular. We ordered the combination appetizer platter, steamed rice, general tsaos chicken and broccoli beef. The beef was nice and tender, and the slices were a nice size and thickness. The vegetables were nice and crisp, and the sauce very flavorful. The general chicken was listed as being spicy, however was not spicy at all. It was actually a little too sweet for my liking, but I didn't complain. The combination appetizer platter was a plate of fried goodness. It fit our mood at the moment, but i dont see us including that in our next trip. \n\nOne complaint, the bbq was pretty dry. I wouldnt order it.  \n\nOverall it was a pretty good place. It's nice that we don't have to go all the way to Chinatown or Downtown for decent chinese food anymore!
