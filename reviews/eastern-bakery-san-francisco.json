Egg tarts are my absolute favorite Chinese pastry\n\nNow I will admit I was aiming to go to Golden Gate Bakery to get my egg tart fix but alas they were closed. I also was a bit far from Good Mong Kok Bakery. I thought my quest to get egg tarts were gone until I spotted Eastern Bakery! Yes, I found Eastern Bakery unplanned and it was a pleasant surprise to find out that it is the oldest Chinese bakery in San Francisco's Chinatown. It looked like it had a bit of a following too and even former president Bill Clinton had visited here before.\n\nThey had several Chinese pastries such as moon cake, sesame balls and my favorite egg tarts! I saw both the egg tarts and sesame balls had a special of 4 for $5. I asked if I could do a mix and match of the egg tarts and sesame balls but alas the guy at the counter smiled at me and said no. I could not thus partake in the deal. I ended up purchasing two egg tarts and two sesame balls.\n\nThe first thing I noticed were the sesame balls were gigantic in size! They're also best eaten while warm because it still has the right amount of chewiness. The sesame balls here were actually pretty good and well worth trying.\n\nNext up were the egg tarts. The egg tarts here were not as large in size. The good thing however was the egg filling itself was quite generous. I enjoyed the soft filling and it simply melted in my mouth. As for the crust, it was just alright. It was crisp but didn't quite have the best buttery, flaky crust I've had elsewhere. Nevertheless they were still good!\n\nEastern Bakery was not on original places to try while in Chinatown but I am glad that I found it on accident!

I have passed by many times but have always consciously avoided it, but you can't resist the itch for ever so finally a couple of days ago I gave in and gave it a try. Like every other bakery in Chinatown it is pretty tiny.\n\nI decided to get a bunch of items to give me a wide understating of what they had to offer. I got an egg tart, pineapple bun, puff pastry and a coconut filled cake. Everything was pretty cheap and my total was under $10 which made the lady helping me kind of sad. Or maybe that was the expression that she had on all the time, I just noticed it while paying. Anyway, suffice it to say that the interaction was not a nice warm experience.\n\nLet's come to the food. Let's start with the good. The pineapple bun was borderline good. It would have been great if it was fresh but this tasted about a day old. The average was the egg tart. It did not have the flaky, crunchy crust that Golden Gate's egg tarts are famous for. In the bad category was the puff pastry. Maybe it is a matter of personal taste; I just did not like it. The coconut filled cake was in the terrible category. Even though it was neatly wrapped in plastic, it tasted like it was weeks old. There was no way that I could eat this. Overall there are definitely better bakeries than Eastern in Chinatown.

Since I had just had lunch, I thought, this would be the perfect dessert!\n\nWe had a box of Dan Tats (egg custard tarts) and some mini Mooncakes. I had to have one of each! The dan tats were creamy yet firm and the crust, super buttery and flaky! So good! My only critique would be, they were a touch too sweet. But my sweet tooth didn't mind it much. I can only eat so much mooncake since it's so dense. These were a good size. The one I had was filled with lotus seed paste with no egg. I'm not a huge fan of the ones with egg, so I was happy. The texture and sweetness level were good as well.\n\nI adore dan tats, so I'm glad I was finally able to try Eastern Bakery!", "author": "Elena N."}

It was crazy town in there, with the line winding around inside the entire store and little room to wiggle. \n\nWith the wait time in line, I was able to narrow down \"I want one of everything to try\" to 3 mini red bean moon cakes, 3 mini lotus moon cakes, one cocktail bun, 3 \"crispitos\", one steamed pork bun, and one baked pork bun. \n\nThe mini mooncakes are the perfect size for you to treat yourself to one and to tell your friend that it's too small to share and they should get their own. They were delightfully smooth and lightly sweet. The next day however, they have a stale oily type taste, so I would recommend eating them the day of purchase. \nThe cocktail bun is standard soft bread with coconut in it. It could have used more coconut. \nCrispitos are small coconut, sesame, and peanut filled pastries that are fried. It was too fried for me, but my boyfriend enjoyed them, as they were reminiscent of the type his granny used to make. \nThe pork buns had a good meat to bread ratio, but the exteriors were not as fluffy as I would have liked, a la Good Mong Kok. \n\nPineapple buns were sold out and I was disappointed.

The first thought was tiramisu, but Yelp also pointed me to coffee crunch cakes from Yasukochi's Sweet Stop and Eastern Bakery. Looking over reviews, Yasukochi's was the favorite in terms of quality, but Eastern was preferred for quantity. With an entire cabin to feed, we opted for the latter.\n\nAnd talk about quantity. An 8\" cake serves 8 people for $20.10, 10\" for $30.10, 12\" serves 15-19 for $40.10, and a half sheet is $55. If you want writing on the top of the cake, you have to forego some coffee crunch toppings. We called in the glorious 12\" cake to pick up the following afternoon. Upon opening the bright pink lid, we found a humongous coffee crunch-laden cake that fed our crew's sweet teeth for the entire weekend with a bowl of leftovers for the ride home.\n\nIn terms of taste, it's good but not great. The coffee crunch is very sticky and slightly saccharine. Fortunately, the sponge cake and fluffy whipped cream are not sickeningly sweet, so a good number of us ended up scraping off the coffee crunch bits. Thinking back on it, I would have sacrificed that excess of coffee crunch bits in order to have birthday writing on the cake.\n\nCoffee crunch cake sans a bit of crunch = perfect.", "author": "Adele F."}

Super crisp flaky pastry shell.\n\nBBQ Pork Bun (Baked):  4 stars\nThe baked bun dough is wonderful, miles ahead of the steamed buns.  The fililng is your typical char siew filling (but a grey colour, not dyed red).\n\nCocktail Bun: 4 stars\nYummy sweet bun with coconut jam filling, warm from their oven.\n\nCoffee Crunch Cake: 3 stars\nBeautifully soft sponge cake with slightly sweetened cream. I just really don't like the sweet artificial taste of the coffee hard candy sprinkled on top... which is the \"coffee crunch.\"\n\n\n---- AVOID ----\n\nChicken Bao (Steamed):  2.5 stars\nUninspired.  Large with thick bread that gets soggy easily, but the filling is a dry, haphazard mix of Chinese sausage, unidentifiable chicken parts, hard-boiled egg, etc in a bit of gravy with weird aftertaste.  Good Mong Kok and other dimsum spots have better steamed buns for sure.\n\nCrispitos:  2.5 stars\nJust a deep-fried wonton skin dusted with sweet stuff.\n\nYellow Bean Preserved Egg Puff Pastry  \u76ae\u86cb\u9165:  2.5 stars\nThe puff pastry is wonderfully flaky (similar to Lao Po Bing \u8001\u5a46\u997c), but the filling is much too sweet and tastes weird with coconut strips in them.  It also has a godawful rubbery preserved egg in there (the \u76ae\u86cb in this \u76ae\u86cb\u9165).  For $3.50 this is a whole load of sugar...  I would not buy this again.\n\nVegetarian \u997a\u5b50:  3 stars\nNot bad, and I like that it is completely vegetarian (no meat or seafood), but the filling is just cabbage, frozen peas & carrots, and boiled peanuts.

I asked the shopkeeper if the bao was hot.  He confirmed that it was warm so I pressed on to complete the purchase.  Sadly, he exaggerated.  It was slightly warmer than room temperature.  The bun itself was lifeless and flat, unlike those you get at dim sum.  It didn't rise sufficiently when steamed.  There was a reasonable amount of filling with chunky pieces of pork.  However, it was gross, covered with congealed fat, probably due to poor temperature control.  Rounding out the experience, the man behind the counter also gave me the wrong change.  I let it go since I was beat after work and this place can use a facelift.  \n\nLast but not least, what's up with the chocolate covered everything?

The crust is flakey and complements the custard nicely.\n\nA big positive for me worth mentioning is that  they continue baking egg tarts into the afternoon. I even got a couple on a Sunday evening  once! Came here in the afternoon last week and while they didn't have a lot on display, they had some in the oven.

As far as I know it opened in 1924 or so, and has been in it's current format since the early 1940's. Like a lot of places that have been around for a long time people can let nostalgia color their opinions of what the current quality is like. \nAlso like many places that have been around forever this place has totally seen better days.  \nThe inside and outside is very gritty, the magnificent neon sign hasn't worked in so long that people have forgotten that it's there. Ditto for what was once some epic outdoor styling. Inside has a few tables and chairs for consuming tea and a sweet, but that space usually has boxes stacked in it. If you are in a restaurant, and they are using part of the customer facing area for storage, including and especially the seating that's a bad sign.\nThe bakery offers just about every kind of Chinese style Asian baked good that can be made, and they are especially popular during the holidays (any holiday. Not just the Asian ones.)  During these times there will be a line, and they do a fair amount of bulk orders. While they bake items daily what you get in the case may or may not be made fresh that day.\nSome items are a sure bet here-the cocktail buns, mantou, and crispitos are filled with win. The mochi, pineapple buns and egg or custard items are better elsewhere and under no circumstances should you try the Zongzi (Chinese tamales.). The Chinese tamales have various fillings which consist of..........you know what, just don't. Really. Don't.\nThis place is great for the old school chinatown expierence. Especially if you are an adventurous eater. \nWhen you go make sure to get a photo or two for memory as chinatown is changing very rapidly and bastions of old chinatown such as this are fading fast.\nI'm giving this a generous four stars mostly for nostalgia, and because my last visit offered the hope that it may return to it's better days, focused on quality instead of making the cheapest possible product.\nOtherwise  a three or two star review would be far more realistic.\nSigh.", "author": "Steven W."}

Personally, I'd just walk the extra 2 blocks to Good Mong Kok..\n\n3. Veggie Buns - Not a fan at all. The veggies are soggy and gross..and the bread is sticky and soggy..\n\n4. Cocktail Buns - Pretty standard..not the best. It's just coconuty enough..but not enough filler..\n\n5. Coffee Crunch Cake - The best thing in this place!! The cake here is more cakey and less spongey if that makes sense. I prefer the coffee crunch cake from Yatsukochi in Japantown, but if I don't feel like making it over to jtown - this is the next best thing..and way more conveniently located.. :)\n\n6. Nian Gao - Nian Gao is difficult to mess up...so its not bad here. They have it in coconut, black sugar, and red bean...not bad at all, except theres no nutritional value in nian gao at all..lol\n\n7. Moon Cake - They have moon cake here YEAR ROUND.

Although the food was completely underwhelming.. on the cusp of being pretty bad, it was still a hilarious experience and I don't regret having tried out Eastern Bakery. \n\nThe restaurant is incredibly old and there isn't any etiquette or rules and you're kind of totally in the dark about whether your order was even received and placed, so you stand there confused. This is exactly what my partner did while I reserved a seat in the back area. \n\nSo confused, we waited for our food. It was handed to us in a brown paper bag. There were no utensils to be found to eat our egg tart, 6 pork dumplings, and 2 pork buns to share. I went up to ask for chopsticks. No chopsticks, so I said forks are fine. He said we don't have that either. So I went over to our table and broke the news. The man called me back to the counter and said I have one fork and handed a plastic fork. I started cracking up and reported to our table with one fork. \n\nHe found another one! Then I think he felt bad and went to the back and brought us a glass plate. Which I sincerely appreciated and the fact that he noticed and acted so we could have basic things to make this easier was actually really nice.\n\nWhen customers order bubble tea, someone from the back comes out a long time later and shouts \"hello\" multiple times until the customer claims it. My partner ordered bubble tea, claimed his and the man tried to give me the other one that I didn't order. \n\nThere are more cardboard boxes in this Bakery than an Amazon warehouse. FUN WAS HAD. But the food was not good. Dumplings were overloaded with meat with mild flavor. The pork buns didn't seem fresh. And we didn't even finish one egg tart between the two of us.

While growing up, this place was owned by a family who eventually sold it in the 1980's.  Before it changed hands, it was famous for locally made moon cakes with single and double egg yolks baked inside and packaged in their pretty blue, multi-colored boxes with a picture of the moon goddess on top.  I liked their packaged Smackles, a sort of flour based, thin, crunchy cookie.  This place was also the go to place for baked cookies and goods ordered in advance and in large quantities that families would share with friends and relatives for an engagement party.  \n\nNot much of the current items taste like it used to anymore.  Even the Smackles taste like it has too much flour in it. We went in to see if there was anything we would be interested in trying again and nothing looked attractive and we didn't even see any cakes in the display cases.  The place is so run down now, hasn't been remodeled at all after all these decades.", "author": "Ry T."}

There's definitely a cultural difference when it comes to customer service in China Town.   I get the impression they're barking at you to hurry up your order (which may or may not be the intention).   With that said I purchased one butter cream bun, a couple chocolate covered fortune cookies, and a golden lotus moon cake.   I wish they gave me napkins after I paid for the items but once I got back to my room, I noshed on the butter cream bun (YUM....may have to go back just for that) and one of the chocolate fortune cookies.   The combo of the cookie and chocolate is always a winner...and my fortune...\n\n\"You are contemplative and analytical by nature.\" (IN BED)\n\nSo true...woo hoo!\n\nHonestly I'm sure it's a luck of the draw that Eastern Bakery was the chosen one on the  map tour but it served its purpose well.", "author": "Eric G."}

From its tired and worn-out appearance, and the fact that there were no customers during the lunch hour, I was a little hesitant and skeptical about this place, but I thought I'd give it a try.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The bun was soft and just the right sweetness.  The pork didn't have that typical bright red color and had a looser consistency, but the flavor was excellent with a hint of onion.  Filled me up for $1.10.\n\nI came back later to pick up an egg custard for an egg custard cage match among five different Chinatown bakeries.  Much to my surprise, this was the top choice of my entire family.  The crust is very flaky and surprisingly crisp in texture, perhaps a little sweeter than expected but still very nice.  The custard had a slightly firmer texture - not as creamy as some other places - and had just the right balance of sweetness and egginess.\n\nSo this place appears to be our bakery of choice - for now.  There are still a few others that deserve their place at the tasting table.", "author": "Lee L."}

I cook and bake so I am always on a hunt for more cookware and bakeware.  After leaving the shop, I walked by what I have never seen before - chocolate covered fortune cookies and chocolate covered moon cakes!  Granted, I have bought fortune cookies from the grocery store and made chocolate ganache and dipped it at home but I have never seen it live in person at a store before.  I was stoked.  The 5 stars is for creativity!  \n\nTo my right were more enticing decadents but what caught my was the chocolate covered moon cakes.  Moon cakes are expensive; a box of 4 can range between $15-$20.  I saw individual ones being sold for $4-$6.  Hell no, I might as well get a box for myself then but I am seriously trying to eat healthier.

Good influence!\n\nThe lady surprisingly speaks English though not well enough to hold a conversation but good enough to know what I'm ordering and to count back my change.  Cash only and they have a dine-in area as well though cleanliness is questionable, after my first bite, I was in awe.  \n\n- chocolate covered fortune cookies $1 each or $1.75 for 2 \n- chocolate covered black or red bean moon cakes $1.95 each or $3 for 2 \n\nBTW- there are fortunes inside the fortune cookie.  My daughter warned me but as always, I don't listen.  I took a big ass bite and what do you know, I almost ate my fortune.  By the time I spit it out, I wasn't able to read it... I was seriously sad for a few seconds.

You see, way-back-when, these institutions were old stand-bys because ethnic cuisine was far and few in-between - even in Chinatown. \n\nIn my own words, options were narrow, \"focused\", and good at what they did.\n\nSo, I walked on by here today to see what they were like still. Traditionally, they were never considered a hole-in-the-wall, but I actually thought that the current aesthetics were worse. The tables looked grubby, and the seating area was wrought with open storage and boxes, and the place looked like they just didn't care for it anymore. \n\nI was hungry, then skeptical, as I scanned the cases. Quite frankly, nothing looked appetizing or fresh. Some of the items were saran-wrapped, and this is a red flag for me. \n\nThe only thing that I really wanted was a \"butter cream bun,\" of which I am a connaisseur - it's the one item I try at different places.\n\nQuite frankly, I was still skeptical, cuz the butter cream didn't look like it was freshly squeezed from the pastry bag (i.e. it looked more like a blob that had been sitting there for hours, rather than the usual designs that you see had you just squirted the cream through the pastry bag nozzle).\n\nI also ordered coffee, and the total came out to roughly $2.46. I HATE being disappointed, even when it's a dollar or two spent. Luckily the coffee was pretty OK, but the bun tasted as if it had been in the refrigerator for at least a day. It wasn't soft, and had that firm texture that you get from the cold. The one thing positive is that it was coated with a decent amount of toasted coconut. I didn't bother eating the cream; I slammed the coffee - and left.\n\nWhat a shame. I'm not sure why this place gets an average of 4-stars here; I wouldn't bother coming back.", "author": "Jimmy L."}

I landed at Eastern Bakery, which I found out after the fact to have 4 stars!  Lesson of the day: Yelp-trained senses + Canto upbringing = killer radar for Chinese food\n\nAs authentic as a Chinese bakery gets.  First of all, it has an impressive history in its claim as the oldest bakery in Chinatown, as well as photographs of Bill Clinton's visit.  The storefront looks like a hole-in-the-wall at first glance, but you realize that the traditional Chinese architecture coupled with the modest red and yellow awning are telltale signs of its long-standing history--it has no need for any flashy decor.  Even the striking simplicity of the name \"Eastern Bakery\" reflect the authenticity as something translated directly from Chinese.  (Seriously, I'm sick of places with wannabe catchy names like golden dragon lotus house or whatever.)\n\nI think it's family owned, and the lady who helped me was very friendly.  As I was pondering what to get, she was helpful in making a lot of suggestions without sounding pushy.  They sell a variety of Chinese as well as American baked goods.  It's pretty cheap, and for most items you get a small discount if you buy 3 or 4.  \n\nI got the sponge cake at 3 for $4, which I noticed smelled very good as I was walking home.  I realized halfway though that I forgot to get something for myself.  However I was told that the sponge cake was very tasty.  Seeing that they were fairly big but all 3 pastries were finished in their entirety by 3 girls, I think it's safe to conclude approval.\n\n(Yelp, please don't get bad at me for this semi-vicarious review!  I have a lot to say despite the fact that I didn't actually eat anything.)", "author": "Edna C."}

My parents will never go home without stopping by this place to buy their coconut puffs.

Their bakery menu is always fresh.  You could smell the bread aroma the second you walk in. All is still reasonably priced.\n\nIf you go in the mornings, you will encounter a lot of elders sitting inside drinking coffee and having breakfast.  Most will be reading the morning newspapers or talking to their fellow elders. So, if you wait or want to sit inside to eat... good luck! \nJust go after they leave when it's around 10:00 a.m. \n\nWalking in there brings back a lot of memories.

Gosh, only if they painted the pink walls and frame the picture that probably the owner took with President Clinton would be awesome. \n\nThe presentation is not there.  Everything just looks scattered, and some of the cakes are not even covered.  Who know if an insect landed and feasted on it... it's still sold anyhow. haha.\n\nI guess this is the only place that I think may be excused from the modern bakery presentation.

The bun itself is brushed with something akin to sugar water, then lightly dusted with coconut flakes. It's light and airy, and the filling, oh the filling! Sweet and creamy, a sheer pleasure to consume! It was the best $.75 I spent all day.

I come from the new wave version of Chintatown in LA, but I can't pass up a chance to give SF Chinatown a try. Pastries and anything sweet is my weakness. We hit Chinatown pretty late during the day, so we were lucky that Eastern Bakery was open until 8 pm! \n\nWe got the following:\n\n- Steamed BBQ pork bun\n- Egg tarts\n- Wifey cake (lao po bing)\n- Chocolate covered lotus mooncake\n- sachima, which I translate to killing riding horse\n\nBut *recommend* the following:\n- EGG TARTS\n- steamed BBQ bun\n\nThe reason?\n\n- wifey cake was too sweet. The filling still retains small chunks of the melon. I brought extra home and everyone agreed it was pretty sweet for a lao po bing. and it was $3.50 each T_T.\n- chocolate covered mooncake was 1/4 of a mooncake. It's a novelty to try but nothing fantastic. Also, it does taste better than it looks as the chocolate part doesn't look very presentable.\n- the sachima was pretty compacted, so the texture wasn't loose and flakey like some places. pretty good.\n- steamed bbq pork bun had bbq pork that had relatively few fatty parts, wasn't bright red, and the bun was very soft. pretty huge size too.\n-egg tart was nice and flakey and buttery. the custard part wasn't super sweet. the entire tart was a nice thick size, not small or thin at other places that make it.\n\nParking may be hard to find (and meters run 8 minutes per quarter) so definitely bus it if you can. Cash only so bring enough bills. Look out for the photo there that showed Bill Clinton stopping by this bakery.", "author": "Grace C."}

My friends couldn't help but burn their mouths. I had a more level head and ate mine slowly. The puffed crust is awesome. My friends mentioned that the filling could be more... creamy maybe? I didn't really care. It was very eggy, warm, and not too soft and not too hard.\n\nI ate the pineapple buns later for breakfast. Pretty good for pineapple buns.

So I consulted Yelp hoping to find an OK place and this place showed up with 4 stars. So with my blind trust of fellow yelpers, I walked inside, though I should have trusted my instinct and left. Anyways, I ordered shrimp dumplings, which is my tester for dim sum restaurants. This is a dish that is at every dim sum restaurant and if a place can't do good shrimp dumplings, you can forget about other dishes. In addition, I ordered shumai and pan-fried dumplings. The owner yelled my order in Cantonese through some intercom. \"Well,\" I thought \"at least she is speaking the right dialect.\" I was led to sit at one of those tables at the back. The tables were dirty and there was some leftover from the previous guests. There were random boxes and stuff in this area. \"Chaotic like many Chinese restaurants. Maybe this place is really authentic and good?\" the optimist in me still hoped. \n\nThen the food came. Shrimp dumplings and shumai looked quite stale. I would believe that they were left over from days ago and were just reheated. The fried dumplings were huge and much of it was dough. The owner brought the food over and a plastic folk. I was puzzled. Isn't this a Chinese restaurant? Didn't I ordered in Chinese? What made her think I need a folk to eat my food? So I asked for chopsticks. She simply said that she didn't have any. I had to laugh. Then I asked for some Chinese vinegar which usual comes with fried dumplings and she again said she didn't have any. Now this is a total joke. Well, since the food was cheap and I was hungry, I tried to food. Just as I suspected, it was horribly bad. Easily the worst dim sum I have ever tried. \n\nTo be fair, I bought a mooncake on the way out, and that was good.

Plus they're bigger than my fist! Can't lose there. \nTheir chicken bao, which I've tried recently, are also pretty good. The filling is a bit different; it consisted of pieces of chicken with chopped up veggie and mushroom, with a piece of lop chong (chinese sausage) and a sliver of boiled egg. That and some gravy like sauce that kept the bao from sucking the moisture out of your mouth.\nThe veggie/pork bao, however, is another story. At about 4-5 inches wide, the filling was a pathetic melon ball sized scoop of veggie, pork, and mushroom. I was embarassed to have bought it for my bf's parents.\nOverall, however, all the goodies are really cheap and (almost) everything was good, so I can't complain.", "author": "Karen C."}

Even the baos and buns looked like they survived a nuclear attack (and I don't mean a microwave ding ding machine, as they would refer to it in Cantonese...yes \"ding\" is a verb, meaning to micronuke...and \"ding\" can also refer to Nissan Demae instant noodles...yes the slanguage is gloriou$).

Only got the bad boy look, but literally a dearth of high tech gadgets, no bells no whistles.\n\nFor true Hong Kong style bakery....Kee Wah is a bright shining example. Too bad they're too focused on Southern California, with three out of the way locations in SF Bay Area (the Cupertino one being quite possibly the best of the lot). Eastern Bakery is known for moon cakes? Errrr try the ones at Golden Gate Bakery, or Kee Wah. Or the standard puff pastry exterior no preservative ones from Cooking Papa (seasonal).\n\nBut look at the other bakeries....as old as the others are, including Golden Gate Bakery, the competition puts way more effort in presentation and keeping up with quality.

We stopped by one morning looking for a quick snack before heading out to Tomales Bay. We just walked, walked, walked and stumbled upon this bakery because there was a huge long line of people. Well, they were tourists because they went inside, looked around, ooh-ed and aah-ed and filed back out and started taking pictures out in front. So I suggested us getting a BBQ pork bun. I was going to go with steamed, but when she opened the display case to the baked ones, the bf and I got the same thing for $1/each. Then I saw the fried sesame balls filled with red bean paste and got one of those as a sweet treat for 75 cents. We took our brown bag and each took a bite. \n\nI was a little confused because there was no sweet porky goodness. The meat was light brown and had a sour taste to it. I had to take another bite to find out what was going on. The bf and I looked at each other and I said I was going to throw mine away. I think he finished his, but it's only because we were starving. All I could think of was, \"I hope I don't end up puking this up later today.\" \n\nSo I turned to the last thing in my bag which was the fried sesame ball because how could you screw that up right? Well, when I bit into it, a whoosh of air came out and it deflated. I didn't taste anything so I look at it and it was all empty with a sad little ball of red bean paste literally rolling around inside the shell. It was a huge ball, but it was a misrepresentation of what was inside. Which was a bunch of air. This was the worst meal of the weekend.

He had been here previously, but it was my first go-around, as I was definitely curious by the signs about how this bakery had the best steamed and baked pork buns around. Also, they apparently are the only place in the U.S. to create the filling for moon cakes on their own, which is supposed to be a very labor-intensive process. If you ever come here, you will be greeted with giant pictures of Clinton patronizing this establishment. How odd, heh.\n\nThe owners/workers are super nice and capable of speaking in many languages, so there was no issue ordering despite it being an authentic Chinese bakery with many European items that have taken a Chinese-pastry twist. My brother decided to order three steamed (the only way to go really) pork buns. They go for a dollar a piece, which we thought was expensive until the massive baos were brought out piping hot from a steamer in the back of the bakery.\n\nThe bao itself is really good in terms the flour used. It's not melt-in-your-mouth soft, but it has a very interesting spongy texture which normally does not characterize steamed baos. The bbq pork was very interesting. It was not heavily sauced in that glossy, MSG-laden, neon-red tint that most Chinese places use as \"flavor.\" PLUS for Eastern Bakery. The meat was also not overly salty, tough, or fatty. It really was a quality filling in the bun. The only downside to this place is that the baked goods are quite expensive for quality that you can more or less find in many other bakeries for a better price.", "author": "Danny C."}

I ordered the ling moong gao (sponge cake with lemon filling), jian dui (sesame ball), lo paw bang (melon cake), hueng jiu gao (banana rolls.  aka rice candy rolls apparently, from what I can see others are calling it on yelp), and the daan tat (egg tart).  Granted I came here on an early Thursday afternoon and it wasn't packed, but was I expecting the little old lady to sell me expired pastries?  No.  I love lemon so I ordered the lemon cake, which in a couple of hours I had come to find that it had black specks all over it, which meant...dun dun dun...MOLD.  that huge piece of cake had mold throughout.  Thanks, lady.  So I tossed that entirely in the garbage, hoping that even if a homeless person picked it out of the garbage, that he/she wouldn't eat it because I'd never want anyone to knowingly ingest mold.  So I moved onto the egg tart which was decent, nothing mind-blowing.  I had passed by Golden Gate Bakery a few times over the course of a three days, but it was never open - otherwise, I would've waited to get the egg tart from there.  Everything else was good, though my favorite Chinese pastry by far is the hueng jiu gao.  Imagine my disappointment when I had two pieces left, only two days after I bought it, to find that too, had grown mold.  The green kind.  So really the only memorable thing this place gave me was both black and green mold.  To sum up, I was grossed out.\n\nThere's a reason why it's known as the oldest Chinese bakery.  Because it sells old and expired pastries.  I'm just glad I didn't order more because the little old lady kept saying in English, \"you want this one?

Come to Eastern Bakery!\n\n\nEastern Bakery is supposedly the oldest bakery in Chinatown.

The pork is reliably good; the chicken is sometimes great, other times dreadful.  Buns are cheap and you can fill your belly for only a couple bucks.\n\nTheir sweets are great but I don't get  them too often (trying to eat somewhat healthy...)  Their custard tarts are great; I'm a huge fan.  Their cookies, moon pies, and other random things are great too but the custard is always my first choice and I'm bummed when their sold out (which happens fairly often).\n\nService?  It's okay; sometimes they're real quick but not always.  One time I was in a hurry, their was no other customers there and the lady had her back turned doing something.

We went late after dinner here and bought some cocktail buns and also some sesame balls.\n\nThe cocktail buns were both some the largest I've had in the SF area.  The bread was very fresh and sweet, and the coconut almost crunchy (i.e. fresh) and extremely tasty.  The taste stood out without being tart, and was just great.\n\nThe sesame balls were still crunchy on the outside and yet soft and gooey on the inside.  You can tell it is made well as the sesame seeds aren't stuck to the outside in oil, but almost look like they are just baked on.  That is a sign they are made well (bakeries that don't make these as well make them so that they collapse from the spherical shape and the sesame seeds look like they've been soaked in oil).\n\nThe only reason they don't get 5 stars is the prices are a bit higher than other places in Chinatown and say New Chinatown in Inner Richmond.

When I was a kid, I'd end up there only a couple times a year, and it usually made for a pretty traumatic experience. Most of what I remember is old Cantonese ladies running over my feet with their carts and jabbering at me, and my grandma hollering, both in English and Cantonese, that I only understood English so they should save their breaths. Not happy memories. However, my grandpa would make the trek to Chinatown every other week (we lived out in the Bayview, and then South City, so we didn't have good Chinese bakeries nearby) and he'd come home with a big pink cardboard box full of Eastern Bakery goodies like bak tong goh (steamed sweetened rice cake), buns, sesame balls, egg custard tarts, doughnuts, and jelly rolls. If we were lucky, there'd be a coffee crunch cake or a strawberry cake. He had a serious sweet tooth.\n\nNow that my grandpa is no longer with us, I have to make the trek over to Eastern Bakery if I want coffee crunch cake. That means I don't always get to satisfy my cravings, but if I did, I'd probably be 200 lbs, because I ALWAYS want Eastern's coffee crunch cake. It's a light, spongy cake with airy cream and crunchy bits of coffee candy. It's the best. My friend and I went there last week and got half of a coffee crunch cake for about $9. We should have splurged and gotten the entire cake for $12, because when we got back to his apartment, we polished that thing off in less than 10 minutes.\n\nAnyhow, Eastern also has other items that are really good, at least if you stick with the tried and true, and don't go for the semi-traditional items which have inexplicably been covered with chocolate. If you're picky and don't want them to place the food in a brown paper bag, all you have to do is order a lot of items so that they have to put all your stuff in a pink cardboard box =)  Go for the sugar donuts, the fluffy yellow cupcakes that aren't at all like regular American cupcakes, sesame balls and some buns. If you're adventurous, they make a really good century egg pastry. Oh, and you'll need another box for that lovely coffee crunch cake.", "author": "Kristina L."}

There were 3 pigeons that had strutted in from the street and one of them decided to leave and so flew right above my head as I sauntered in. I had some misgivings about this place but my greed for Asian baked goods overshadowed any of that. Golden Gate Bakery, a few doors down had a line snaking all over Chinatown I bet for their mooncake offerings and I didn't really see any other baked good salvation in the walking distance. \n\nThis bakery is very frumpy, old and dare I say....dirty??? I mean, the 3 pigeons kind of sold me on that. The counter was being manned by one very unfriendly old lady. Usually I would be offended but she reminded me of every baker in Singapore (where I grew up) so it was weirdly comforting. \n\nI ordered a coffee crunch cake because I liked the way the \"coffee crunch - whatever that was\", looked on the cake. Seriously lip smacking good. I was devouring the whole thing and taking in that cheap buttercream and mocha flavoring and inhaling all that sponge cake. The \"coffee crunch\" that littered the top of the slick of cake was also drool worthy. I also ordered a lotus paste \"bao\" or steamed bun (vegan if you're OK with sugar). Soft, smooth, hot and the lotus paste was tasty. \n\nThe bakery offered lots of variety and served mooncakes, wife cakes, custard buns as well as boba drinks.\n\nExcellent baked goods, very reasonable prices and fast service make this a great choice in Chinatown. Unfortunately, the pigeon incident and the general disarray and dinginess of the place would make me think that there's a very likely chance that the food here isn't as clean as I would like to imagine it is. 3 stars because of that.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-22", "description": "I'd like to start this review with an apology that has absolutely nothing to do with Eastern Bakery.  I've been very preoccupied of late with a variety of non-Yelp activities, so thank you to everyone who has sent me a note telling me to get back on the wagon and write some reviews.  I guess that a little hole-in-the-wall ethnic shop is an appropriate starting place, at least for those of you who know me!\n\nThe girlfriend and I spent a nice long weekend up in San Francisco, and while she was off having fun shopping and walking through art galleries, I was holed up in a coffee shop doing some work.  Fun for her, not so for myself.  But hey, you have to do what you have to do, right?\n\nSo I was walking home, and two realizations suddenly dawned upon me:\n1) Wow, it's freaking freezing up here, why did I dress like an LA boy?\n2) After four cups of coffee and breakfast only, it was time for a mid-afternoon snack.\n\nAs I was walking back to Embarcadero where we were staying, I saw the holy grail... aka the gates to Chinatown.  Word.  I'm sure I can find a snack beyond that big metal pillar gateway to the land of sodium and MSG.  As I passed along the endless row of culinary wonders, I couldn't decide what I felt like.  Peking ducks hanging in the windows?  No thanks, too much food for a snack.  Standard Americanized Chinese combo plates, choice of two plus chow mein or fried rice?  No thanks, I'm not looking for rat... er, Panda Express.\n\nA little shop came into my sightlines, hmm looks interesting.  A big glass case with an extensive selection of various pastries?  Sold.  In I went.  Four crazy (and tiny) little Chinese ladies who don't speak a word of English?  My kind of place.\n\nI ordered an enormous bao, and a Chinese doughnut.  \"Wansebedyfi,\" the lady screamed at me.  \"Excuse me?\" was my response.  \"WANSEBEDYFI,\" she yelled more loudly.  I guess it's like when Americans try speaking more slowly and loudly when someone has an accent, thinking that this will help them to understand the English language, even though it's a fundamental lacking in the individual's vocabulary that's actually causing the problem.  In short, I had no idea what she was saying, and since I figured it couldn't be very much, I gave her a ten dollar bill.  She disappeared behind the counter, which was taller than was she, and she came back with $8.25 in change.  Ah, she was saying \"one seventy five.\"  Got it.  That cheap?  Extra tip for her.  So good.\n\nWalked outside, and proceeded to grub as I walked back to the hotel.  First up the bao ($1.00).  This was excellent bao.  Usually you're looking at a small rice dough ball with a hint of sweet barbecued pork.  Not in this case.  This bao was monstrous, and it absolutely gushed pork.  Delicious pork.  Some of the best bao I've ever had.\n\nThe Chinese doughnut was also excellent.  Sesame seeds coating the outside, perfectly moist and delicious on the inside, with appropriately sweet red bean filling and just a hint of grease coating your lips after every bite.  Sound disgusting?  Try it and then tell me that.  A perfect dessert.\n\nAll in all, I'd have to go four stars for the experience.  I even brought my girlfriend back for dessert after dinner, although I can't remember what we got; it wasn't as good as what I had ordered earlier in the day, which causes my rating to drop to four stars.  The prices, however, are excellent, the bao is excellent, the doughnut is excellent, and if I lived in the vicinity I'd overdose on this barbecued pork bao goodness.

For example - I love the almond caramel chocolate laceys but last time they were a little moist from condensation, which ruins the crunch of the treat. My husband got a chocolate covered fortune cookie, popped the whole thing in his mouth and ended up eating the paper fortune inside. Now maybe you can blame that on him but I'd assume that I could eat anything covered in chocolate all in one bite. Anyhoos, I didn't like the cookie anyway because the chocolate was cold and cold chocolate is not tasty. \n\nI do like the almond cookies although they taste a little oily. \n\nWorth a drop in if you're passing by.

The window display draws you in and the pictures of Bill Clinton's excursion into SF are a treat. I ordered the char siu bao (of course) which was quite big and still warm. They weren't tiny buns like you get at dim sum restaurants-- these were full sized bbq pork buns. I got a baked bun, but perhaps I should have gotten a steamed one instead...\n\nThere is so much filling in these it was surprising. I ordered a sesame ball in addition to it, but it was unnecessary and not the best I've had. It was greasy, but not overly so, and there was a huge air pocket in the ball making it appear much larger than it actually was...\n\nThe total price for my lunchtime excursion: $1.75 and I am quite contentedly full. $1 for the pork bun and 75 cents for the sesame ball. I would go without the later in the future, but the pork bun was delicious.

We walked up to Eastern Bakery with the express purpose of ordering the dumplings I'd seen advertised for (I thnk) 3/$1.00. It was close to closing time, there was a young girl in there doing homework on her computer, and since I was starving, I ordered 6 dumplings, in addition to a bun and some dessert. I was expecting them to be the usual size of dumplings that come in orders of 5 or 6. I'm not sure if they always make them fresh, but they did for us. We waited at a table for quite some time, and actually heard the dumplings hit the oil for their finish.\n\nWhen we got them, they were too hot to eat. When I unwrapped them at the hotel, sitting on the floor in front of the TV, they were STILL too hot to eat. But they were lovely. And HUGE. Almost as big as my cell phone (will post the photos later). They were they way I like them, boiled, then browned in hot oil. They were firm and perfectly chewy and didn't fall apart, and there was so much gingery pork inside (and no excess drippy water) that I think I may have swooned.\n\nI live in the Atlanta area, and we have a fine selection of authentic Chinese restaurants on Buford Highway and elsewhere...but I haven't found anything to match my fantasy dumplings and crave them more often than I'd like to admit.

Eastern Bakery was the only place that made it back then.\n\nThis was quite a feat, considering she lived all the way over by the Cow Palace and would take MUNI (15 Third - I think) to Eastern Bakery.  It would take her around 90-120 mins each way!  My poor little grandma, barely 4'11\" carrying a huge rectangular candy-filled cake just for me.  She would have to carry the cake back on the bus and all the way home...cake in hand, crowded by all the stinky people on the bus that reeked of raw fish/tobacco/mothballs/alcohol/vomit/urine/ass.  \n\nI guess the look of delight on a little chubster opening a box of her favorite cake, was her own reward.\n\nThank God, I moved on to Fresh Strawberry cake w/fresh whipped cream by the age of 7 (available anywhere) and only had coffee crunch 3 other times since.  \n\nI really liked the cake...and I LOVE MY GRANDMA!  =)\n\nI have to take one star off for the parking situation.

I do not know of any other place that sells such scrumptious BBQ pork buns - an item I became obsessed with during my Anime phase in my early teens. (Maybe you don't remember, but pork buns were a regular hit on Sailor Moon. Thinking of that is making me want one RIGHT NOW). Anyway, back to the pork buns. The best part about them is the bun itself which has a hint of sweetness and, though nothing like the kind of magic you learn at Tartine, has a crispy intricacy to it that is lacking in the dry refrigerated buns you are likely to find at other haunts. For some reason, the bread also reminded me of the coconut buns at KING'S Bakery. Reminding m of KINGS is always a good idea.\n\nThe meat is not scary, which means a lot. I often don't like looking at the inside of these things, but the experience is totally not bad at Eastern Bakery. The pork looks fresh and gooey living in that hot bun. It has a light sweetness that compliments. It's a happy marriage if I do say so myself.\n\nAlso if you haven't already heard like a million times there are pix from Bill Clinton's visit all over the wall. How trippy dude.", "author": "Alexandra M."}

We panicked, and then we saw Eastern Bakery - a quiet little gem amid so much chaos.  To be fair, it was doing good business.  But it was one of the few places into which we could actually squash ourselves, and so we did.  Like most places of its ilk it doesn't look like much, but I still find it really comforting.  There's comparatively a lot of space, enough room for a couple of tables in back, and I really like all the colors, both in the front window and the actual display case.\n\nAnd ohhh, the moon cakes.

The thin, doughy outside is so light and chewy and delicious, and the fillings always feel so rich and creamy even though they, too, are as light as can be.  I think if it came down to moon cakes alone, I just might go to Eastern even if there weren't a line at Golden Gate.  I haven't had much else, but I also noticed they have fun little goodies like candied carrots and water chestnuts.  Those seemed like odd things to candy and made me think, \"Huh?!\" so naturally I got a bunch.  They're really good!  Water chestnuts make sense - they have such a subtle flavor as it is, they'd make an excellent palette for candying.  But the carrots get really sweet and chewy, too!  If you're up for a smaller snack than a moon cake, a bag of those candied carrots is pretty satisfying.\n\nThe service is really pretty good, and I can't say that I've ever been pushed, rushed, or otherwise yelled at.  Plus, they have a website, which is pretty unheard of for Chinese bakeries.  It makes me want to order bulk and send moon cakes to all my friends.  I will say of service, however, that I got better recommendations from an old man who was another customer, who happily rattled off what I should order and that Bill Clinton went to the Eastern Bakery, had I seen the picture.  He was pretty awesome, and I like that people like him are fixtures at places like Eastern Bakery.  I'll certainly be back to Eastern, and it's a good thing - it has been at least two weeks since I've had a moon cake.  I'm about ready to upgrade my status from \"one yolk wonder\" to \"three yolk frenzy.\"  Eastern Bakery, here I come!", "author": "Becca S."}

This place is huge, i have never been here before and it always amazes me walking into a place in San Francisco, let alone Chinatown, and it being so big inside. This has to be the biggest bakery in the area. They didn't have custard buns, but i really only came to try the coffeecrunch cake that everyone has been raving about. I'm not a big fan of cake, the texture doesn't do it for me- however tiramisu was a childhood favorite of mine *probably because of the rum lol* This cake reminds me so much of it. The cake was not dry, but it was very light and airy/bouncy, almost like angel food but different. Creme is used instead of typical frosting- which makes it so heavenly and light. The coffeecrunch candy topping is like toffee but with coffee instead of butter. So...good. Has to be one of the best cakes i have ever fricken had. $3 a slice seemed abit much though, especially when the whole cake is $13. I got there before noon and there were only 3 slices left of this cake- so people were right, it goes so fast. Glad i tried this.

I've been a big fan of their Coffee Crunch Cakes since my fiance turned me on to it. I've picked up a few cakes from here and each time the service was fine and they got the order and spelling correct. No issues there.\n\nSo, one evening I came in when it was pretty slow to speak to someone about ordering the Coffee Crunch Cake for my wedding. The lady in about her 40s-50s, who spoke perfect English, was behind the counter. I made a beeline for her since the other ladies didn't speak much English. She said they did do wedding cakes and then brought out these ratty, sticky, and dirty photo albums from the 90s. She then promptly left me and never came back to check on me. I thought she would take a seat across from me to ask me how many guests, what cake I wanted, answer any questions, etc. It was slow after all and there were already 2 staff members behind the counter. She went behind the counter and was on the phone for about 10 minutes. I asked her questions, but each time she would answer then walk away. One time, she didn't even stop to answer my question, but answered as she walked by. She wasn't rude, but she didn't care at all about my business and seemed exasperated even thought there was no one around! She didn't pay ANY attention to me and didn't seem the least bit interested in my order.\n\nI reallllly wanted to say something to her, but decided to just complain on Yelp instead. I'm sure they don't care about their Yelp ratings since they're already pretty famous and have been around since the Depression. FYI: 200 guests, 3 tier cake with a sheetcake in the back, and delivery would've been about $500. It's definitely cheap, but since they don't need my business, I'll spend my money elsewhere (like Sunset Bakery, 5 tier cake for $295 + $45 delivery fee).

Just days before I'd had a conversation with a fellow baked goods/sugar enthusiast about the dearth of good chocolate chip cookies. So perhaps it was the universe's xmas gift to me that Eastern Bakery was open and my busting gut didn't dissuade me from going in. Otherwise I would never have discovered that the perfect chocolate chip cookie was to be found in a filthy Chinese bakery in Chinatown. The cookie, dubbed \"chocolate chip cookie monster\" (says it on the sign), is a rather large choc chip cookie covered in chocolate with a scattering of m&ms adorning the top. \nI didn't expect much, but figured the chocolate and m&ms would at least make it ok. Holy crap. Best CCC I've had in decades. The cookie was dense, bready, moist but not chewy, with a fine crumb. \nI thoroughly enjoyed that cookie. I thought about it for days, trying not to go back too soon. I've had 2 since. Just finished one. As good as the first.  I've informed my friend of my discovery. CCC have found a place in my revolving repertoire of baked indulgences. But only the Eastern Bakery's chocolate chip cookie monster. \n\nSome day soon I'll try their plain CCC.

But, it's just gone downhill. Big time.\nThe only good thing there that I will still eat is their sugar donuts. That alone gives it 3 stars. The other stuff? Well, here's an example: my grandma used to buy the apple pie from here and it was delicious pie. Just so good. Flecks of cinnamon, rich crust, everything you want.\nI decided on Chinese New Year to get a pie and let my daughter experience the goodness. Sigh. Sob. Sigh again. It was horrible!! The filling tasted like chemicals and had no flavor. It's consistency was exactly like rubber cement. The crust left a worse coating of grease in your mouth than eating a candle and 6 dozen Slim Jims. I had to dump the whole thing in the trash.\nPlus, it looks cluttered, unclean and unsanitary. When you order a char siu bao, they have to go in the back for 5 minutes to get it, and then when you get it finally- it's a little ball of disappointment.\nGo to Honolulu Cafe if you want a good bao.\nIn closing, I'd like to say that I would be SO sad if they were to close down and go out of business. I just wish they'd clean up their act. Literally.", "author": "Jessica O."}

I've never eaten here, I just order get in and get out. It pisses me off that they don't even have like cases to put the baked goods in! They put the food you buy in a brown paper bag so ghetto! So maybe bring your own Tupperware. Although this bakery has some die hard fans! My dad loves this bakery, and has been going here for 21+ years. Whenever I go downtown my begs me to pass by here to get half a dozen steam buns/baked buns from this bakery. He's a big fan of the bbq pork ones, but sometimes requests the chicken steam buns. My dad also likes their rice cakes. This place is always busy, there's always a line, but it goes by quick. It's a little annoying about how they only accept cash! I wouldn't drive here because parking in this area is kinda difficult. On a funny note, there are huge pictures of Bill Clinton visiting the Eastern Bakery, it's pretty funny and cool at the same time! Prices are normal, which is cheap.

My friend had the butterfly cookie, which was just alright. But the really nice thing is they have so many options that you have to try a couple of different things. Plus they have tables in the back to hang out at and soak in the ambiance or watch tourists and locals get their fix. If you prefer hang out on the bench outside on Grant where you can people watch.

The entire time, my mother kept tugging my sleeve and insisting it must be overpriced since it was in the \"touristy\" side of Chinatown.  Went in. Saw the President Clinton-was-here photos and the sign that said, \"We've been here since 1924, BEFORE THE GREAT DEPRESSION, ...\" Ordered two pork buns and 1 slice of the coffee cake. The woman behind the counter disappeared into the back.  As we waited in the empty store, a pigeon strolled in through the doorway, hopped up on some bags behind the counter, and began rooting around for crumbs, to our amusement.  Wondered a little at how clean it could be.  Woman came back with the buns, heated.  The buns were not glazed, and the pork filling was undyed and good.  Two buns and one slice of coffee toffee cake (which I thought was too sweet) was $5.00.  I wasn't impressed by either enough  to say they were SUPER good, but it was certainly good.  I later ate a pork bun at another dim sum shop along Stockton Street  where they were .90 each and found it inferior to the ones I had at Eastern Bakery.  I have yet to try Golden Bakery though.", "author": "Carol S."}
