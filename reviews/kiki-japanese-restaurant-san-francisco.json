If you're looking for a casual and cheaper Japanese type meal, Kiki is your place. While there isn't a huge selection to choose from, the sushi is quite good. Also, less panic ordering.\n\nSo the sushi is good here though I can't imagine it'd be very good if you order out or have it delivered. The bento boxes are fairly consistent though it can always be better. Regardless, a salmon teriyaki will always hit the spot for me. What's more is that portions are quite generous for what you pay for. So yeah, if you don't want to wait 3 hours for sushi or bento boxes that'll cost an arm and a leg, then come to Kiki's. You'll actually be full when you finish dining here.", "author": "Derek T."}

However, don't trust a sushi restaurant that DOES NOT have a sushi bar. \n\nMy friends and I sometimes would come here for happy hour. They offer $6 drink special that comes with a large sake and large beer. We would be pretty careful about eating the food, because the quality does not appear to be very high. Last night I decided to give their food another chance. BIG MISTAKE!!! A couple hours after leaving I began to feel sick and ended up spending rest of the night in the bathroom with food poisoning.

Britney Spears gets married twice. And I go to Kiki for the first time.\n\nKiki in 2017 pretty much looks the same as it did 13 years ago. I'm positive that the food must have gotten more expensive thanks to inflation and rising rent, but it's still nowhere near as pricey as what I've come to expect for a meal in San Francisco. I came here with a friend when we wanted cheap comfort food sushi, but I think we would have been better off with grocery store sushi because at least the California rolls from Trader Joe's have never tried to kill me before.\n\nI had the sushi plate A for lunch, which consisted of six California roll pieces and six pieces of assorted sushi (shrimp, tuna, unagi, salmon, albacore, and yellowtail). No complaints about the California rolls -- they weren't frozen and the imitation crab hadn't gone bad, which is pretty much all you can ask for when you order the most basic of sushi rolls. However, one of the rolls (either the albacore or the yellowtail) was incredibly tough to chew, which may very well be a trait of the fish itself, but I have a hard time believing that sushi-grade fish is so tendony that a tendon could get lodged in someone's throat while they were eating it. I literally had to yank the tendon out of my throat (to the morbid fascination of my friend -- classic former bio major) lest I had actually started choking at the table.\n\n\"It's good you did that,\" my friend said, \"because I don't know how to do the Heimlich.\"", "author": "Amy C."}

The fish has always been good all around. For about 20 bucks, I can find myself with a good dinner for two- which is a super deal for sushi- and really the greater area of where this restaurant is located. I am also a big fan of their udon soup- it is just right when the fog has you down and all you want is a warm soup with some noodles and tempura.

I don't know if it was some sort of glitch but the prices were insanely cheap. I totally assumed that the rolls I was ordering were going to be tiny so I ordered like 10 or more rolls for two ppl and they turned out to be full-size. I feel totally disgusted with myself. So much wasted food! I had a $10 coupon on Caviar and our total with delivery charges and service fees was $60...that means that I ordered about $50 worth of sushi and it was enough to feed an actual army. Why is this place so cheap? The sushi was all quite good. They don't have a lot of variety on their Caviar menu, a lot of it is California rolls and embellished California rolls, but it was all totally tasty. I ordered a roll with Saba, which was just nori, sushi rice, and the pickled mackerel and I think I paid like $4 for it?

I wanted a hot entr\u00e9e and decided to get a Katsu-Don.\n \nThe Katsu-don consisted of good portion of pork cutlets that was covered with an egg cooked in a special sauce with green onions. This was served on top of rice.  If you like you katsu to be crispy, then this dish might not be to your liking.  The egg sauce softens the crispiness of the panko on the Katsu.  I thought the dish needed a little more flavor.  As a katsu dish, there's a katsu dipping sauce. Since it's a donburi bowl, there's no katsu sauce, so there should be more seasoning in the egg sauce.\n \nThe prices at Kiki are inexpensive relative to the typical Japanese restaurants.

Food in sf is far too often over hyped, over priced, and under delivers. Kiki's is a great stop for decent pricing (with hh special at all hours) with some pretty fair quality food. \nThis is also one of my go-to places for large catering orders. \n\nService: 5/5 some people complained they can't find waiters but I haven't had that problem anytime I've come here. I also frequently put in large orders (hundreds of dollars) and they haven't messed up or been late once and always accommodating with chopsticks and sauces. I don't think they have paper plates though. \n\nFood\n\nBento: these are the best bang for your buck. My personal favorites are salmon (both ways). Never dry and always delicious fat and crispy skin. I ask for sauce on the side because it's very sweet and I just want a dab. Also good is chicken teriyaki, awesome tempura (always crispy and not too much oil with fresh oil not stale), and California rolls 5/5\n\nFish: kiki is cheap so don't expect $150 omakase level fish. That being said I still think it's decent especially at the price point. For me, it's not enough that I would eat it sashimi style but I'm ok eating it nigiri or in rolls. They have a good variety of simple and more Americanized rolls. I don't like see fried rolls but the other ones have been good.  3/5\n\nDrinks: love the happy hour prices. Soju cocktails are a mixed bag (Liked most fruity ones but not others). I like the sparkling peach sake too but it's small 4/5", "author": "Anna N."}

It has little to no taste and is covered in a sickly watery orange mayonnaise that neither adds dignity nor taste. My girlfriend had to vomit directly afterward and that is not hyperbole. Furthermore, the ginger flanking the sushi has the consistency of a wet napkin. \n\nThe tea is served in cups of a plastic material sheathed in a beige color scheme that tries, and fails, to disguise itself as a higher quality ceramic. \n\nThe fried tofu is boring, tasteless, and generally awful. It comes coated in a thin film of a fried shell. It is lukewarm and insipid at best.\n\nThe fried pork tastes like leftovers. It is limp, dull in color, greasy, and, in all of it's microwaved glory, accompanied by a few sheets of fresh lettuce and decent rice.\n\nThe udon broth tastes like a diluted miso soup.

My daughter and I ordered 2 appetizers while waiting for our friends to join us. 1 appetizer came wrong and the server (Linda) that did not take our order (Green), challenged us. Ok, it happens. Friends joined, order taken, food arrived. Barely 1/4 into our food, our server said \"I need the soy sauce\", taking the bottle without asking us if we were done with it. Ok...let it go as we spy another bottle nearby.\n\nThe bill comes, and my friend was treating me for my birthday. She sees they added gratuity and questioned it. Our server stated it is automatic on parties of 5 or more. (We were 5, 2 adults and 3 teenagers). We asked where did it state this and she left to get a menu. Well, look at that! Parties of 5 or more! Except the \"6\" was written over with a \"5\". As my friend was talking to the server, I walked over to the stack of menus near the front, they all said 6 and none were altered. \"Those are old menus\", oh really, here near the front? \"Yes, it's a new policy and those were not done yet\". I asked her to show me where the \"new\" menus are and followed her to back of restaurant where she grabbed and opened the menu not finding the gratuity statement. I grabbed a few menus to find where others were altered and couldn't find one that said \"5\". The apologies began while Linda looked on to what was going on in front of her. No manager or owner on duty.\n\nBetween Linda and Green, they felt what they did was acceptable practice since \"sometimes the young people come and drink a lot during happy hour and don't leave a tip\" and \"we rely on tips and need it\" and other excuses. Oh, my favorite...\"sometimes people think bad service and not going to leave tip\". Ummm...how about providing good service every time! I told Green that I was curious how many other times has she done this...\"not a lot\", girl...you need to keep your mouth shut when you are busted. She asked me if I wanted her to quit her job, told her what she does is her business and between her and her employer. \n\nMy friend was on phone with her bank regarding the transaction and to make sure the charge was captured without the tip. Linda kept telling me and our girls we had to leave because they wanted to go home. I told her to direct her issues with her coworker with the deceptive practice and it's her fault we are still in the restaurant. OMG this whole thing was unbelievable and epic! We loveD Kiki's but not if they are going to allow this behavior. Believe me, this is the short version of what happened!

Yes, 50% off!!!! \n\nThis made Kiki (and their sister restaurant, Kitaro) a favorite among broke college students trying to impress their date with \"sushi\". Despite having copious amounts of kewpie, sriracha, and some other mystery sauces, if it had a raw fish in it, it was considered \"sushi\". Hey, I was 18 then. I was naively impressed with anything that wasn't a Maruchan ramen cup.\n\nI decided to relive my college days and pay a visit to Kiki's after a decade hiatus. Ok, it was more like to make Mr. NSS happy because he loves their cheapy bento boxes. Kiki hasn't changed one bit. It still smells funky and the rickety tables are sticky, but the 1980s art deco plates from the dollar tree store seem to be holding up quite well. \n\nEven though Kiki's is Japanese owned with Chinese employees (http://www.abc.ca.gov/datport/LQSData.asp?ID=19397691) it's far from authentic; it's more like Chinese interpretation of Japanese food with lots of jive ass rolls options. It was pretty filled for a very late lunch at 3 pm so it looks like they're still appeasing the masses with cheap, fast, and filling meals. They only offer 15% off coupons now (via website and safeway receipts) but something is better than nothing.

I've been coming here since high school, whether it's with friends or family.\n\nSashimi is really good quality for the price. The salmon and the yellowtail are favorites of mine! The salmon is always really buttery and the pieces are a good size. The sashimi dinners (14 pieces + salad and rice for ~$14) are a great deal. You also get a lot of bang for your buck with the combination dinners, because you get 2 items of your choice, and you can choose between a large variety of items including things like 7 piece sashimi, 6 piece rolls, or even heartier options like chicken karage, tempura, or tonkatsu. The chicken karage is really good, freshly fried and super hot when it comes out! The sriacha mayo that comes with it is good and not too spicy, or you can ask for teriyaki sauce on the side. They also have a bunch of cheap rolls. I like the alaska roll (yay, more salmon!) and the rock n roll (eel + avo), which is on the combo dinner menu too! Usually I can get 2 and it fills me up for lunch or dinner!\n\nThey have a bunch of new items on the menu that aren't included in the online menu. I really liked the curry udon with chicken katsu ($7). The udon was really soft and the broth was perfect!! I also got to try the lady gaga roll (4 piece, $3), which was pretty tasty.\n\nKiki's has a great happy hour now (every day, from 3-9pm), where you can get a large beer and a large sake for $5.50. Great deal!!! My parents love coming here for that and I can't wait to bring my friends here for happy hour too. \n\nService is usually very friendly, but sometimes they are understaffed. The place does get crowded around 6:30 pm for weekend dinners so try to go earlier than that!\n\nAnd be sure to save those safeway receipts! There's a 15% coupon on the back for kiki's!

We ordered a bunch of sake bombs for happy hour but two of our sake glasses were filled with yellow food spots all over. What made it worse was that the small glasses were flipped to cover the top of our Sapporos so the mouth of the bottle was grimy. The bowls and soy sauce dishes were also sticky and not thoroughly washed. \n\nI don't recommend getting anything raw here... seeing how unsanitary this place is. The tuna was not fresh and it was still thawing when I bit into it.

It's a great place if you're not willing to spend too much and are looking for VERY good sake bombs prices. \n\nThis place itself can be disorganized at times, especially when it gets hectic, which it really does during their happy hour (6-9PM?). It's been very rare that they take too long to bring something out and very rare that they'll forget something which is GREAT. But when I say it gets disorganized, I'm talking about seating people down. When it's happy hour or just dinner time, you have to get your name written down on a clipboard once you walk in. There's usually a sign that says, \"please wait to be seated\", so you can't miss it. STAY INSIDE the restaurant so you won't miss your name being called! \n\nThe outside and inside of Kiki's is quirky from start to finish. You can't miss this place and its Pee Wee Herman entrance. I love that they have Miyazaki film posters inside: Princess Mononoke, Totoro, Kiki's delivery service and I think Spirited Away. \n\nNow, the sushi and bento boxes are pretty good and they also do specials once in awhile (not in pricing, just new items). My favorite is the pink dragon roll and their spam roll. Ask for unagi sauce on the side ! You'll thank me later, promise. This place sure does make a good katsu; crispy panko and juicy chicken. \n\nService is usually sub par and I totally understand. I usually see this going on with Japanese restaurants that have below than average prices: people lose their shit and I'm not joking when I say that. My friends and I always order a bunch of rolls ($60+ for 3-4 people). Customers ordering sake bomb after sake bomb can get very rowdy and for me, if I was working there, I just can't with that.

What a steal! A SMALL SAKE BOMB for $3.50 trails behind, for a small sake and a small beer. For $5.00, you can get a \"HARLEM SHAKE\" COCKTAIL, which consists of a big pitcher of nigori sake and Yakult (a sweet Japanese yogurt drink).\n\nDuring happy hour, you can also get a few small dishes for a great deal, including edamame, miso soup, gyoza, and tofu.\n\nAs far as food goes, Americanized sushi rolls are the main draw here, but you can also get sashimi, nigiri, and chirashi.

My pal Becca invited me out for drinks at Kiki with the girls, to which I thought, okay Sake bombs it is! And when I got there, we did indeed do some sake bombs. But I didn't know how cheap and seriously delicious the sushi was going to be. \n\nI'm not a big sushi person in general. Not that I don't like it, there are just other foods I prefer and sushi doesn't usually make the cut. So I planned on just sticking to a liquid diet. Then I started eyeballing the Dynamite Roll, which I guess isn't really \"sushi\" since it's fried tuna, but it fit my fancy last night and you'll be proud to know I ate the whole thing. It was light, crisp, a bit spicy, and very flavorful. \n\nA large sake + beer was $5.50 and my roll was $4.95. Um yea, that's real. Truth be told, the pieces were small, which is actually what I wanted and a good value *for the price*, but had this been served to me in a nicer restaurant, I would have been disappointed. The sushi spot next door seems to get a lot more foot traffic, but it's a tad pricey. And Kitaro is apparently Kiki's sister resturant that my sushi loving friends prefer, but to each their own. I know I'll be back, you can't beat those prices, plus the restaurant is clean and cute.", "author": "Crystal C."}

For as long as I can remember, whenever we're too tired to cook, forgot to get groceries, or need food in a pinch Kiki's has been our default cheap and easy foodstop.\n\nIt's not very glamorous and it's not very polished, but Kiki's hits the spot every time. With huge portions and a robust menu, it's a great place to take a group and try a little of everything, especially since the atmosphere is very accomodating to chatter.\n\nThe trick is to order smart. Combos are strong, sushi is cheap, and the fried foods are the perfect (appropriate) degree of oily to pair with any other part of your meal. I generally avoid most of the sashimis just because it's not really the place, but most of the makis and special rolls are great, especially the Dragon Roll, Alaska Roll, and Rainbow Roll. Other combo favorites include the tempura, chicken karaage, and beef teriyaki.\n\nOver the years, Kiki's has come to define comfort food for me. It's not the sort of place you go to to impress anyone, so all my memories here are of close friends and family enjoying the lavish, gluttonous offenses to traditional Japanese cuisine that I'd be embarrassed to order anywhere else, ending feeling too full to function. In fact, I feel protective enough of the place that I'm a little offended it doesn't have higher ratings. I'd blame this on Kiki's aesthetic--if it were just a little grungier, it'd be held to hole-in-the-wall standards and be praised, I'm convinced. Kiki's is not going to be the best Japanese food you've ever had, but it'll be the best you've ever had at this price.", "author": "Cailin H."}

We entered 30 minutes before closing. My cousins gf has been here before but I haven't (first time). She said the place is cheaper than Ebisu. Looking from the storefront photo, the outside paint is yellow but when I came here, they recently painted it like a purple-ish color...which is a nice color for this place! \n\nEntering, I thought the place looked a bit odd and unique since the doorway and window were slanted. When we got to the hostess area, no one was there. Instead, this guy from across the restaurant got some menus in the back and walked reallyyy slow (probably a few steps) then signaled us to seat in the back on the right side (while he's still standing in the back).. \n\nWhile waiting, I noticed that what Joan T. said was true. Decor is a bit .... odd. They do have tacky Japanese writing covering the entrance lights. They also have funky lamps with lanterns as lights. There are also Kiki's Delivery Service & Totoro posters on the wall. When the three of us sat down, we noticed the place was reallyyy hot and stuffy! It felt like there was no air ventilation!! Ceilings are high but the room echo'ed with people's conversations. Tables were sticky. When the host had put down our menus on the table, and when I tried to pick it up, I could hear the sticky noise when I picked it up. Also, the for the \"special roll\" menu, there isn't much choices compared to other places in my opinion. I admit their prices are cheap though but you get what you paid for. \n\nThe sushi tasted quite bland.. I ordered the Tiger Roll and and there was so little sauce on it! Pink Dragon Roll was good..it was hot when I first put it into my mouth. Don't remember much of the Alaska Roll. Oh, and the waiter forgot our plates. We decided to just eat from our sushi plates instead of asking. \n\nOh, also, parking is hard! But that's Irving for ya'll... \n\nOverall, service was meh. Sushi was bland. Decor is odd....

First, this is really more a teriyaki joint than a sushi joint and the prices should already tell you that.  The food is average but the portions are large for the price you pay and they often have 10% off coupons on the back of receipts and in the local weeklies.\n\nWe often get the bento box dinners with chicken teriyaki, grill salmon or saba, and a mixed tempura.  The food never tastes bad but it's obviously not made by a sushi master or anything.  Bento boxes come with a salad that is overdressed and a big portion of rice.\n\nThe last time I was here, I got the Udon+ tuna sashimi combo and the udon was done well with a nice clean slightly salty broth and the tuna sashimi was sliced a bit thin on top of a bowl of rice.  I'm not going to complain, it was $8 and the sashimi tasted fresh.\n\nThink of it this way, you would pay more for sushi, california rolls, and terikyaki takeout at the supermarket than you would getting it freshly done at Kiki so it's a-okay in my book.  The decor could use some updating though, the old Totoro and Miyazaki posters are kind of tacky, but the high ceilings are nice and there is NEVER a line or wait.\n\nAlso, I wish I could rate other people's reviews as \"stupid\" because someone said this place used imitation crab in their california rolls and they said yuck.

The ambiance is well.... not really there, but the waitstaff are relatively friendly and responsive. It's usually quiet, except when a group of 30 people 'take over' the place, which only happened one time in our many many visits to Kiki's.\n\nThe sushi is fresh, the portions are generous, and as mentioned the prices are low (relatively speaking - Japanese cuisine is always pricey). \n\nThe cut rolls are very good and there is a nice selection. Also, they offer 'happy hour' prices after 3 which is a nice plus. Their bento boxes are generous and numerous, and they are flexible about substituting items.\n\nOne of my favorite items is their chicken udon, which IMHO, is the best in the city. The noodles are fresh and buttery, the chicken is juicy and sweet, and the broth is TO DIE FOR. And I have tried this dish in a bunch of SF places, hands down, this is the best. They also sprinkle a generous dose of green onions on top. What a great, tasty comfort meal on a chilly foggy San Francisco day.\n\nMy daughter orders the salmon (sashimi) over rice, which is delectable.

I went around 12:30 p.m. on a weekday and the place was about 1/3 full.  The restaurant has a very casual vibe and the four of us were seated very quickly.  \n\nThe menu has pretty much most things you'd expect from a Japanese restaurant: simple sushi rolls, curry, sesame chicken, teriyaki items, udon, etc.  So it's a good place for those who like variety.  The food itself is pretty decent and very fairly priced.\n\nI ordered:\n-Tea (free): warm tea is a nice touch- we even had the pot refilled once.\n\n-Chicken curry udon ($6.49): a very good sized portion for the price.  My friend and I both ordered this (after hearing good things about it from another friend) and neither of us finished ours.  There is a fair portion of chicken and some nice fried onions tossed in as well.  The curry soup was very flavorful and a bit on the spicy side- but it was still pretty good.  The noodles taste like any other udon that I would buy from the supermarket and cook up at home, but that's good enough for me.\n\nOverall, the food is decent and the price is right.  The curry udon is probably the best thing I've had here.  Their sushi rolls aren't really that spectacular, but if you want something like a California roll, they'll have it.

As a high school student on my parents' budget, Kiki's was a great way to get my sushi fix without breaking the budget. They've actually gotten better with their menu in recent years.\n\nTheir rolls are nice and big. Around $6-10 for a roll, it's average price but above average size. Usually I like to get the salmon sashimi dinner plate, which is about 12 decent-sized pieces of sashimi, salad, and rice, all for $13. What a steal! Even back when I was more physically active and hungry, this dinner plate was always enough to fill me up and satisfy any cravings I had.  One great deal I like these days is their udon + rice bowl combos. It's great if you want soup but you also want good ole' donburi. I believe it is around $12 for this combo.\n\nEven now that I've experienced many more sushi places, both high- and low-budget, I keep coming back to Kiki.

I had ordered the Caterpillar Roll, Godzilla Roll, and the Tempura Bento Box.\n\nThe Tempura was pretty good with nice and crispy batter.\nBoth of the sushi rolls were very bleh. They looked like something I could roll, which means they looked very amateurish. The rice tasted more like jasmine rice than sushi rice, and the texture felt the same. these things were falling apart when I picked them up. The sauce that they came with was very uninspiring.\n\nThe only reason I gave this place a 2.5 was that the prices were affordable.

I had to ask a waiter for a menu and another table setting. The lady who came to take our order was able to answer the questions I had about the various Japanese sushi names and I am at least glad for that. I decided on the bento box, as much of the other yelpers have said that the bentos are worth it. They are not lying.\n\nI ordered the Chicken teriyaki and Dynamite roll combo which came out to a little over $9, and the Spicy Tako whatever ever from the back of the menu for $2.59. I can easily say, hands down that for $9 and $2.59, you don't necessarily get what you pay for. My bento had maybe a breast of chicken cut into strips covered in teriyaki sauce, a bowl-sized scoop of hard/dry rice, six pieces of sriracha covered \"tuna rolls,\" and the usual salad with mystery dressing and a small dab of wasabi and barely any ginger. The chicken was average in taste. It looked nice but the taste is pretty much the same as any other teriyaki chicken you can come across. That also goes for the salad. The dressing makes the salad taste good, but I'm sure also very fatty and unhealthy, but of course that's probably the reason you can transform a delicious garden salad to a delicious garden salad with \"mayonnaise\" (I forgot to order dressing on the side....).  The Dynamite roll was a complete let down. I ordered it probably because I remembered so many people talking about it, but with my horrible long term memory, I did not know if they were positive or negative about the Dynamite. I will give it a negative review. I did not like not tasting the tuna. I could only really taste the sriracha that they plated the sushi pieces with. And I really want to laugh about the Tako. I did not know that octopus could be so small....tasteless......and just not very appetizing. I really ordered that so my friends and I could get a taste of this place, and after the Tako, it was somewhat a downhill ride from bad to a little bit better to a disappointing dinner.\n\n\nOur dinner for three people came out to under $30, which is cheap, but for the food that we got and the prices I paid, I really would have appreciated much more bang for my buck. Would not go back without their % off coupons that you can get online or from the receipt from dining in.\n\nC", "author": "Alex T."}

They never pay attention to you in the first place, your water cup is always empty, so drink slowly. When you pay, sometimes you don't get your change back. Just do take out here, it's not worth coming in and getting bad service in return and have them expect you to leave them a wonderful tip.\n\nThe food is a whole different story. Why did we always come back every week even though we knew they hated us? The food. For a college student, sushi and other japanese fixings get the job done. This place is very cheap and filling.

Same owner and alternating workers, just different names. I don't really understand why they do this though. Kiki's is my go to place for some decently priced sushi. I always come with the 15% off coupons I clip out from safeway receipts but can you blame me? I consider myself a frequenter of this restaurant as well.\n\nI recommend the Lady Gaga which is a four piece unagi & tofu roll in tempura style, topped with tobiko (caviar), onion & spicy sauce. My sister usually orders the chicken karaage and she enjoys it. I always order the rock and roll which is unagi (eel) and avocado. What I like is that each piece of sushi is humongous! It's not phenomenal but two rolls fill me and they taste pretty darn good. Also, their udon is nothing special and the beef in it is extremely chewy. Not for me. If anything, get the plain udon.\n\nThis isn't what I consider a \"real\" japanese restaurant but I'll still visit this joint rather than the two fancier neighboring ones because they're pretty pricey without offering much more than beautiful decor. Service at kiki's is still pretty exceptional and their wait times are extremely fast. I get seated quickly and wait less than 10 minutes for my food to arrive.

One needs a keen eye to watch for ways they can be deceptive in the things they do in order to keep a low cost.\n\nService:  Pretty bad.  Not once were we asked how was our meal or asked if we needed a water refill.  The only time we even seen our waiter was when we ordered our food, and when he brought it to the table.  It's pretty bad when you have to flag down your waiter to get your check because they never even seemed to serve us in the first place.  1 star\n\nQuality:  I wasn't expecting much in the first place due to the price and I sure was right.  I noticed that they give you a very large bowl filled with a lot of bland broth but hardly any udon noodles.  In fact, it tasted exactly like the instant udon noodles I buy at the Japanese market!  The tuna bowl had a lot of sushi rice, but had small, skinny  slices of tuna that looked more like shabu shabu meat than sashimi.  On top of that the tuna was not fresh.  It was very dry and chewy.  The sushi roll had very little tuna and rice, but was filled mainly with avocado.  1 star\n\nPrice:  It's cheap sure.  But, with what you're given, to be charged any more would be an outrage.  I think a lot of people don't see through the little tricks that are pulled, (Big bowl with tons of broth and hardly any noodles.  Or the tiny slices of tuna covering the rice) but I can see right through that.   2 stars\n\nLook if you were only given $10 then I suppose this is the only place you could go to.

The last time we came the rice on the sushi was hard/old so it wasn't that great but this time it wasn't bad at all. So I think my 3.5 stars is a fair review for mixed feelings about this spot. \n\n[M] We had the Bentou Box with California Roll and Beef Teriyaki http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=gBEihTFxWQ5CzOH1tGjAPw&select=RZPeO67wX9WNGjpQdJD9vA.

The only weird thing was that the waitress could be a LITTLE MORE attentive because when we walked in, it was a \"Seat Yourself\" sign so we did. \n\nThere were 2 hosts, a guy and a lady. The guy saw us and told us to sit wherever we liked and he gave us the menus. Then almost exactly the same time my butt was touching the chair to sit down, the waitress was already there asking us if we were ready to order. I was like uh...we JUST sat down! The chair isn't even warm from me sitting down yet haha. So yeah, she should be able to see people walk in and that our menu haven't even been touched yet. I guess I can't knock them for slow service haha.\n \nBack to the food, the beef was actually a litttttle bit dry but with all that teriyaki sauce on top it wasn't too bad. All the sushi was actually really good. I really liked the Pink Salmon and the Alaska Roll. The pink salmon has cooked salmon on top with some mixed mayonnaise sauce and the alaska roll had tuna and california roll stuffing inside. \n\nThe only thing is that this place cuts their pieces REALLY BIG. It's not a problem for me since I just wolf food down lol. Might it might be an issue for other people.

Maybe it was because our menus stuck to the table. Maybe it was because the harried staff seemed really, *really* unhappy about something.  Or maybe it was because every door, wall, window frame, and light switch and was kind of grimy and chipped and worn-out looking.

I'm not eating anything til I get my ginger with my raw fish!\n\nMy dad sat and sat and sat waiting for his food and when it finally came..it was luke warm udon. WTH?! They didn't charge us for the soup when he changed his order, but it was minus one star there. \n\nWhen it was time to pay, the waiters walked past us as if we didn't exist. We even went as far as signaling to them that we needed to be attended to, and still they ignored us (minus another star). When the waiter finally took our cash, he never came back. Do we get our change back? My mom threw a bitch fit in there demanding for her change back and when we finally got it, the waiter made this unappreciative face. \n\nTotal experience: Not satisfied.

The answer if usually yes so I leap out the doors right before they close and happily march my way towards towards the place with the tilted window. \n\nI like the fact that it's much more casual feeling than the average Japanese restaurant. The green may not be the best choice in the world, but you gotta love a place that has framed pictures of MIyazaki movies all over. \n\nI always grab a spicy chicken roll (chicken kara-age, lettuce and spicy sauce), a tempura roll (tempura shrimp, lettuce and not-spicy sauce) and if I'm real hungry maybe tekka maki or something small. It usually winds up being 8-11 bucks which is a fantastic price. Special rolls that are $6 at most Japanese restaurants are $4 here. There is a very slight decline in the quality of the rolls in that they tend to easily fall apart, but they taste just as good so it doesn't matter. \n\nCheap sushi, quick take-out (10 min wait), Miyazaki.\n\nThey have a \"Bring this receipt back in for 10% off!\" thing on the bottom of all their receipts, which is nice.", "author": "Kyle K."}

So, I will instead give you the straight talk, just the facts, ma'am:\n\n1.  The food is really cheap.  Most rolls are $2-4.50.  Some are pricier, but still a good $2-4 less than they would be at other restaurants.\n\n2.  The service is okay, although confusing:  they seem to all service every table, with no one specific server being \"your\" server.  So, if you need someone to bring you more napkins or another pot of tea, just flag down the first server who walks by.\n\n3.  Do not order sashimi take-out.  You will wind up with chewy, fishy-tasting-and-smelling food that will make you wish you'd just gone to Safeway for some fresher fish and grilled it at home instead.\n\n4.  Sign up for their mailing list - you'll only get the occassional coupon every few months, and it'll save you 15% on your entire check (not just your meal, you can save your friends money, too!).\n\n5.  If it bugs you to get sushi rolls that have too much rice on them, this place will definitely not meet your standards.\n\n6.  This place is GREAT for large parties...they have a huge, long, center table that can easily fit over 20 people!  And even though they don't usually take reservations, if you have a really massive party, they'll try to accomodate it by taking an informal reservation (just don't screw them over by no-showing, okay?  It'll ruin this perk for the rest of us!).\n\n7.  Their take-away sushi platters are super-inexpensive, tasty, and the best way to impress your friends at a dinner party while doing zero prep work....and you can still use that 15% off coupon!\n\nAll in all, this place is what it is:  the cheapest sushi in San Francisco served in a generally spacious, clean-feeling environment with a reasonably attentive waitstaff and usually no wait for a table...what's not to like?!\n\n*Note:  Parking in this neighborhood sucks.  Contrary to what a few people seem to have voted for, there is NO parking garage here.  There's a metered parking lot nearby, but it's usually full, especially at night.

It was in fact...a little worse.\n\nI ordered the tekka don (assuming they could cut fish and throw it on sushi rice well enough) and my friend got the udon, plus, a california roll for kicks.  The sushi rice in the don was ok.  The maguro on the other hand - well it was an odd color, sliced way too thin, and had the taste of ice.  This after a 30 second conversation I had in my head wondering 'will this make me sick?'.  The udon was way overcooked and falling apart.  And the California roll tasted only of mayonnaise.    They also had a thing called a snowball (cream cheese wrapped in sushi rice and fried i believe).  I actually steered clear of it but it seems popular.\n\nKiki was ok because nothing else was open and it didn't make me sick.

I ordered a Box A and a sushi A , the sushi came first , tasted excellent with no complaints. Then the box A came...

The sushi plate deals that Kiki offered were amazing. So cheap for so much sushi! So my family and I had ordered those plates almost once every few short weeks when we were too lazy to cook dinner. The sushi was never really amazing, especially since it was all cold and hard - but what can we expect for such a cheap price and quick pickup time? However, there was one very memorable time when we opened the sushi box, and half the sushi was blue! Blue, shiny mold. I really lost my apetite that day, and as much as I had loved ordering from Kiki, I decided to just stick with eating in when the sushi is guaranteed to be fresh.\n\nI still like Kiki, so definitely drop in for a yummy, cheap sushi experience.

The place kind of reminds me of a Taiwanese cafe or a Pho restaurant for some reason, but with the Miyazaki posters.  We get seated for 5 very quickly.\n\nI ordered a simple bento box dinner that included Chicken Teriyaki, Salmon Sashimi, Rice, Salad, and Miso Soup.  The best way to describe this meal is typical.  I didn't hate anything I had and in fact, I cleaned out everything, but nothing stood out in the spotlight for me.

I normally stick to my same regular dishes and come back specifically for them when I visit. \n\nThat being said, I would highly recommend their shrimp and veggie tempura, miso soup (some of the best, if not the best I've found price wise), california rolls (they are incredibly simple, but with a little sriracha sauce they are fantastic!) & chicken teriyaki. \n\nAdditionally, I love the salad dressing they use on their side salads, and their Firecracker roll (which is filled with salmon and then deep fried) is to die for!!! It comes in 3 pieces, but 1 or 2 are usually just enough for me when I have them as a side. I also really love the sauce they use on those rolls (it's a peachy/orange color, probably fish based, but totally amazing). \n\nKiKi is a fantastic place to frequent because of their prices, service and convenience. They have very warm decor and sky-lights that make the interior very bright and calming on a busy weekday or weekend. I love all of the Totoro canvas prints they have up as well.

It's an underhanded compliment that's not supposed to mean anything.\n\nBut I mean this in the most endearing way, as far a \"cheap\" Sushi is concerned Kiki is one of the best.\n\nYou're not going to find the most elegant, freshest, exotic, or innovative sushi here. But you will find the \"classics\" at a very good and reasonable price that makes eating Sushi on a very regular basis a possibility.  \n\nWhen you want a hamburger with the best ingredients and cooked with the utmost care, you go to a nice sit-down restaurant, right? But if you just want your fix, you go can go to a McDonald's.\n\nSame applies here... If you want the best Sushi your money can buy, go somewhere else.

The exterior of the building looks like something out of a Miyazaki movie and the inside is decorated with a lot of artwork from his movies. Unfortunately, the food here, although cheap, isn't that great of quality. I had the sushi dinner special and it was pretty mediocre compared to other sushi I had. The color of the fish was darker than most sushi I've had and the taste was underwhelming. I think the best fish I had was the salmon and that wasn't special compared to other places I've been to.

The service isn't impeccable but its decent. The waitress is a little more attentive than the waiter, I've come to find. However it does depend on the amount of people seated at the moment.\n\nMy favorite thing here is probably the uni. The uni is fresh, cold and its 4.85 for a nigiri. That's nearly 2 - 3 dollars cheaper than a LOT of other places & being an uni fan, its a humongous deal for me. They also give you quite a lot, not just a single piece. i think they packed about 2 - 4 pieces into a single nigiri for me ^_^ \n\nI would probably recommend getting a bento or a donburi, or something cooked. I've gotten the sashimi here multiple times (Because apparently my boyfriend doesn't care about the quality) And I literally gagged & spat out a couple of the fish. ick .\n \nAll in all, what you pay is what you get.

My friends and I love getting sushi here because it's cheap and affordable.  \n\nThe service is very friendly and fast.  I've never had to wait long for a table or to be served.  They always attend to your needs right away.  One thing I love about them is how they never fail to give me my low-sodium soy sauce seconds after I ask for it.  Most sushi restaurants take forever to give me a bottle and once, I waited for so long that I ended up having to stand up from my seat and personally get a bottle myself.  But at Kiki's, it's like they anticipate my request of a bottle of  low sodium soy sauce, and they are ready to hand it to me.\n\nThe sushi is cheap and not anything too fancy, but it definitely hits the spot when you're craving for some sushi.  The rolls are pretty generous for cheap sushi too.  They average about 5-6 pieces per roll, which is pretty similar to most sushi places that double the price.  \n\nMy favorite roll has to be the Dynamite Roll. I'm not a big fan of anything deep fried, especially deep fried sushi, but for this one I'd have to make an exception.  My friend recommended that I ask them to add cream cheese in the roll (it's $1 extra), and he was right, the extra dollar was SO worth it.  I've never tasted anything like it before. I've had the roll without the cream cheese, but adding it just made it better... Who knew spicy tuna, deep fried batter, and cream cheese were like BFFs? \n\nThe other rolls are also great. My second favorites would have to be the 49er and the San Francisco rolls.. which are pretty much the same thing, but if you're a spicy eater like me, then get the 49er roll.\n\nI just wish they would add more selection to their sushi menu.

Keeping in mind that I have a HUGE appetite, this amount of food was perfect and I was so full afterwards. Now keeping in mind how much food this was, it was ONLY like $3.99. In addition, they have a decent amount of sushi rolls to choose from in case you decide to venture into the world of raw fish. \n\nMy recommendation, if you are looking for a cheap but delicious meal and you happen to find yourself around 9th and Irving, please come here to have your appetite satiated.", "author": "AJ C."}

My best friend had introduced me to the place a few months back, and I have been going there ever since!\n\nThe reason why I like Kikis so much is because of the price for how good the sushi it actually is. I really love the chicken teriyaki, the california roll, and I even ask for spicy california roll (where they add the siracha sauce). I love getting the lunch special with tempura and the chicken teriyaki because it's so moist and delicious! My friend loves getting the firecracker roll which we both think is fatass, but damn good anyways.\n\nAll in all we never spent more than $25 dollars there and that includes two lunch specials, two rolls, an appetizer, and tip usually.

The service is good, the decor is unique, and I dare you to find a better value!  I have been to many sushi restaurants, and although I have had great sushi elsewhere, I have also ate sushi that was very comparable to kiki's for twice the price (some of which was right next door). Let's face it, not all of us can eat sushi on a regular basis without our pocketbooks shrinking at an alarming rate.  Kiki's makes it ok to eat sushi whenever you want.\n\nSome cons would be: lack of beer and alcohol selection. A lot of sushi/Japanese restaurants ( like Ozumo) have great sake selections that can really enhance your experience. Kiki's doesn't give you any selection.  Also, if you are looking for a formal dining experience, kiki's may not be for you.\n\nOverall, I love this place.  Kiki's is my choice for the everyday sushi fix.", "author": "Steven H."}

My friends and relatives absolutely LOVE their super cheap combo bento boxes that come with a massive amount of food though.  When I used to eat some fish, I tried some unagi at Kiki's and I thought there were way too many little bones in it.\n\nKiki's prices are amazing and the food is good - it's nothing \"spectacular,\" but what do you expect from an inexpensive, casual restaurant like this?  The food will fill you up nicely and keep you coming back for more.\n\nThere is an AMAZING selection of vegetarian rolls during dinner.  Their sushi platters are inexpensive, well-prepared, and perfect for parties or those nights when you just feel like pigging out on sushi.  I wish they delivered though.\n\nDon't ever go to Kiki's without a coupon that'll give you at least a 15% discount in hand - their prices are very affordable as is, but why not save a few extra bucks when it is SO EASY to do so?  I don't see Kiki's coupons on the back of grocery store receipts as often anymore, but you can go to their website, sign up for their mailing list, and automatically receive a coupon to print out on the site.  They will also periodically email you with special print-out coupons when you sign up.\n\nKiki and Kitaro basically have the same menus (they are sister restaurants), but I would go to Kiki over Kitaro any day.  The walls at Kiki's are bright and colorful, the room is well-lit, and the restaurant is VERY spacious.  When I'm at Kiki's, I don't feel like I'm bumping elbows with strangers while I'm eating.

This is, in fact, the true source of Kiki's power. For the quality of the food, it is completely and insanely cheap. Like, \"I'm going to feel like a sushi baller and buy one of everything on the menu\" cheap. And the rolls and portions are HUGE. \nAlso, interesting note.

Kiki's doesn't have the greatest selection but for the price, the food is good, and service is good. \n\nThe only time service wasn't so great was that one time where I played a game with my friend where we had to say something, of the other persons choosing, to a random passerby. I made her go up to a guy outside and tell him how big his muscles were and what beautiful skin he had. Dude freaked out and ran away. He literally ran away from my friend who's a cute girl, looking behind him to make sure she wasn't following him,  haha. To return the favor, when we sat down for our food at Kiki's, she had me compliment our female servers teeth, then stroke her hair and tell her her hair is fine as silk and smooth as gold. haha. \"Mmmmm, guuurl, your teeth are magnificent. And your hair...\" as I ran my hand through her thick mane \"your hair is as fine as silk and smooth as gold. Ohhhh yeah. MMmhhhmm.\" \n\nWell, that little bit o fun led to a pretty interesting moment and somewhat slow service. But it's cool. My friend and I were cracking up the entire time waiting for the food so we were entertained.

I mean i think its pretty hard to find a place that serves sushi that isn't jacked up in price just because it says fish on their menu.  With this place you definitely get what you pay for.  Your not paying a lot for top of the quality fish, your paying reasonable and moderate prices for a very reasonable and moderate piece of japanese cuisine.  \n\nPlus, the people here are all so nice.  The waiters and waitresses do a good job of making sure you have what you need, when you need it.  They may not always be around to refill your water but they stay out in the dining area in clear view of everyone, as opposed to hiding in the kitchen and chatting it up.\n\nOh and they also have a lot of seating, and one big table for the larger parties.  The only downside of the big table is its right in the front of the restaurant.  On several occasions we have come here and the place was full and there was a waiting list, but what was really impressive was that as soon as a table clears out and the guests have left, they do a great job of quickly cleaning and preparing the table for the next group.\n\nMy gf and i come here quite often and we really enjoy it here.  \n\nIf your looking for good sushi at a reasonable price with good and fast service, then this is the place for you.

These are rolls of 5s and 6s going for about as low as $3 every day, any time. And it's not because this sushi is a day old, or old school, or bare, or anything silly like that. You will find some good and creative rolls here at Ebisu's much more reasonable and nearby competition. The menu has pictures AND verbal descriptions of each roll, which every sushi place should do. The place is often packed with Asians, young and old, which is a sign this Asian restaurant serves its food right. And the servers are fast too. But do expect a short wait if you come during peak hours. Luckily they have a nice waiting room with chairs and a table so you can come in from the cold.\n\nDecor and image is very cheery, bright neon colors, like a Tokyo sushi house. Fans of Hayao Miyazaki will love the gallery of movie art on stretched canvas running along the walls like an art gallery.\n\nMy only complaints: \nIt does get loud in there. It's common to have Asian families or parties come in groups of 20 or more, plus the tables are quite close together. Also, unlike many places, the miso soup and tea does cost extra.\n\nExtra tip:\nSave your grocery receipts. Some, like Safeway, print coupons for meal discounts to Kiki's on the back. One friend brought his to our dinner, and it was gladly honored. The result? We had a dinner that would have cost about $200 at Ebisu just a few doors down, but here it would have been about $90, and with the coupon it came down to about $70.", "author": "Clar L."}

Walking down the street we come across KiKi (for some old timers like me I think it was House beforehand) and decide to see what its all about.  \n\nI order the Chirashi Don and wife gets the Hamachi Don.  She's a bit of a food snob especially when it comes to Hamachi so she's really looking forward to the presentation.  Food come quickly and as ordered (which honestly for a Japanese sushi restaurant was pretty impressive).  Why does it take so long to slice raw fish and put it on top of rice?  Anyway, I won't rant here.  Oh, forgot about the starter....agedashi tofu.\n\nLets jump right into it.  The tofu was missing grated daikon and bonito shavings which I like cuz is just adds texture and flavor.  There was a sauce that appeared to be the watered down stuff used for unagi, so there was a very strong sweet taste that was a bit out of place.\n\nMy chirashi was interesting to say the least.  Rice from an inverted bowl was placed in the middle of a plastic plate and running up the sides were, shrimp, hamachi, maguro, sake, tako tamago, kani (the horrible fake crab s_it that I won't eat), cucumber, inari skin and topped with seaweed salad. On the side was a heap of tobiko, ginger, wasabi, and some sweet tasting rehydrated shitake's what seemed weird and out of place.  Presentation was a okay, so if you eat with your eyes I might have scored them higher, but taste buds are on your tongue and my tongue said.....eh.  There wasn't really any problem, especially for the price you pay, but its absolutely forgettable.  \n\nWife's hamachi don was more of the same except for extremely thin slices of fish.  Ok, but not memorable.\n\nThere seems to be a trend in Sushi restaurants moving away from the  standard sushi bar and have back room support for line production that make me wonder about the food.  This place seemed a better alternative to Safeway, but not by much.", "author": "Dude D."}

We got there and asked for a table, and the man at the register simply said \"$10 for a table\". $10 bucks honestly, to SIT DOWN? I've been there before and not once have I EVER been asked to pay to dine in. The cashier probably noticed that we were a bunch of middle school girls and decided we could easily be taken. No thanks! We'll go to Gordo's a couple stores down!\n\nWent there again about two weeks later with my parents and the SAME guy at register (Asian male, middle aged, about 5'10) was there. Nope! He didn't ask for $10! He kept staring at me as he showed us to our table. Maybe he's a pedophile or maybe he simply recognized me from before.

The prices are reasonable compared to other Japanese restaurants, and is even a better deal if you can get your hands on some of the 15-20% coupons that are sent in the mail.\n\nJapanese food snobs won't like this place because it does not offer the \"ambiance\" of a Japanese setting. If that's your thinking, you might as well go to somewhere else more \"authentic\" and flush an additional $10-$20 down the drain for added atmosphere. If you are just after a good reasonably priced way to eat, Kiki's is the way to go. Beware that if you order an extra bowl of rice that you'll be charged for this. Most restaurants will throw this in for free, but you'll see an additional $0.75 or more at Kiki's. Not a big thing, but this is sort of nickle and diming customers.\n\nThe bento boxes are a good value, and the sushi selection is quite inexpensive when compared to other heavy weight sushi places. The parking can be sometimes daunting, but you can usually find a spot a block or two away, or across the street in the park. You'll have to keep an eye out on your time if you show up during metered parking hours. The traffic patrol is pretty intense in this area and are always on the lookout for expired meters.\n\nIn conclusion, Kiki's is a nice little Japanese restaurant that is a very good value for those on the lookout for a good Japanese restaurant that won't break the bank for a lunch break or dinner. It is primarily a place for eating and not for atmosphere. The service is generally quick and efficient.  The general public will love this place for its great value and good food.

The establishment itself is unique, from the lopsided entrance design to the classic anime wall decorations depicting classic Hiyao Miyazaki's \"My Neighbor Totoro\" and the 2001 Oscar winning animated movie \"Spirited Away\". The eatery is very clean and well lit due to the skylight provided above. The only flaw would be the drafty feel inside. \n\nMore importantly, the food here is perfect for those craving Japanese food for lunch but is on a budget. I usually order their lunch box specials and their selections are fair. I tried their deep fried gyoza and I instantly became a fan. As I mentioned about the lunch box specials, their selections are fair but limited in variety. I felt as though they could have more choices on hand, maybe even matching that of their sister restaurant Kitaro. Other than that, the food is fine.\n\nService is pretty good most of the time. Whenever I have a craving for Japanese food close by, I would go here on the less busy times. There would be maybe 2 or 3 waitresses/waiters and the food doesn't take too long to be ready. Although I've had times where it took a while. I'm not sure about the busy days.\n\nOne last mention, great place to bring kids. It's a fun looking atmosphere.", "author": "Terence N."}

OMG, what a mistake...\n\nKiki's is EXACTLY like Kitaro. If you don't know what Kitaro is, it's basically a fast food restaurant of sushi in the Richmond district. The menus are the same, the food is the same, I even think they switch waiters from Kitaro to Kiki's! Anyways, my friend and I ordered the chicken teriyaki and rock n' roll combination box while my other friend that suggested the restaurant ordered the grilled salmon with tempura combination box. When I got my combination box, the salad was literally a few lettuce pieces that's drenched in salad dressing, and there wasn't even a generous amount of chicken teriyaki. I just looked at the box like, \"Are you serious right now..?\" My friend had a a little bit more lettuce than I did, and my friend thought his salmon was decent. When our waitress gave us the bill, we put down our share, expecting some change back when she took our bill. NO, this girl just put everything in the cash register, thinking that she did a WONDERFUL job serving us, so she took a ginormous amount of money as her tip. We had to ask for our change back because we really didn't want to give her a $5+ tip for a $20 meal...

The sushi is pretty good and boy oh boy is it ever cheap. I've had similarly priced sushi elsewhere in the city and it has been barely edible. But at Kiki, the portions are good (meaning large rolls with a decent amount of fish), the fish is tasty, and the service is good. I sometimes even get sashimi- something I'd never do at other inexpensive places. If you are in the neighborhood, it is definitely worth checking out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-03-20", "description": "Having recently moved to the neighborhood around Irving and 9th, the first thing I knew about this area was the abundance of good eateries.\n\nOn my way back from jogging in the park the other day, I walked into Kiki to grab a take-out menu. The first maki roll item that jumped out at me was the \"Mexican Roll\". Looking further down the menu, I spotted the \"Pink Dragon Roll\". And I thought to myself...\"Waaaiiiit a minute...I've seen these items on a menu before. But I've never been IN this place.\"\n\nThen it occurred to me...KITARO out on Geary! (The waiter at the register quickly confirmed the sister status of these two restaurants.)\n\nSeveral years ago, when I didn't live all the way on the east side of the city (which, of course, I no longer do), I used to order takeout from Kitaro on a regular basis. And the Mexican and Pink Dragon Rolls were steady faves.\n\nI just ordered the Pink Dragon Roll this past weekend when I went to Kiki with my brother. But, this time, I was offered the choice of having the salmon cooked or uncooked on top, something that I had never considered when going to Kitaro (and I also asked that it made without that obscure mayo-type cream sauce that they run across the top with Christmas-colored sprinkles). I opted for the uncooked, and the end result was much like the \"Salmon Tsutsumi Roll\" at one of my favorite won't-break-the-bank sushi places in SF: I Luv Teriyaki & Sushi on Potrero Ave. But the Pink Dragon doesn't have the slivers of avocado between the salmon pieces, as the Salmon Tsutsumi does. Bummer.\n\nThe Mexican Roll (shrimp tempura within a roll, with chili powder) didn't have as much chili powder on it as I recall from past visits to Kitaro. But it was still pretty tasty.\n\nWe also ordered a couple of deep-fried rolls (the Godzilla and the Dynamite). Both were decent.\n\nI don't think I would order things like ikura nigiri for fear that it wouldn't be as fresh as, say, Ebisu up the street. But the maki rolls are satisfying, and you really can't beat the prices...under $7 for a Rainbow Roll??? Try to find that price at another sushi place in the city.\n\nThis review may seem like it's all over the map (it's my first one!), but I'd have to say that, all in all, Kiki was a nice walk down \"low-cost sushi memory lane\" for me and my bro. For the record, that's not a walk a like to make very often.\n\n3 stars because, as sushi places go, I would give only the absolute best of the best places 5 stars, and there are many 4-star places in the city that come to mind as simply a better overall experience than Kiki/Kitaro. This place is decent nonetheless...", "author": "B. Earl K."}

The food was fairly good and the service was a bit slow but with the amount of money they were charging for food - my friends and I were not complaining.  I ordered a 2-item chicken teriyaki and shrimp tempura bento box, spider roll, and rocky roll - all to myself.  All that food just for about $20, that's pretty great in my opinion.  I also liked the restaurant's decor.  Portraits from one of my favorite childhood cartoons - My Neighboor Totoro and Princess Mononoke.  The things the restaurant could improve is by hiring an extra waiter/waitress to help with service.  It was a busy night when I was there and there were only 2 servers for the entire floor.

Just now...\n\nKiki sushi is the premier japanese culinary establishment in San Francisco if not the universe. People rave about the pricing but for me, that is what I would expect from God's kitchen. A deal for his people.\n\nKiki Sushi not only offers fine food, but it offers great food! \n\nCRUNCHY SNOWBALLS are the best invention since Tiny Timbers! This is not even something I can describe. Essentially, it's east meets west meets religion. \n\nThe only problem with thi restaurant is the fact that if you go once, you WILL get addicted.\n\nMe: Kiki?\n\nKiki: Yes?\n\nMe: I LOVE YOU!!\n\nKiki: Me too!\n\nTo all readers: Although you may not choose to go to Kiki you shouldn't make the same mistake that Abraham Lincoln made... as he never went!", "author": "Noah B."}

However it is, in my mind, the minimum that I would expect as far as Japanese food goes and their lower prices reflect that.  If you want to impress someone, this is not the place to go; it will suffice if you just want a decent meal that won't break the bank.\n\nThe dinning area is quite comfortable, but it can get loud during busy hours.  The dinning area is not packed tight like some other places - see my review for Healthy Desert if you want to know what I mean.\n\nAs others have stated, this place is a bit less expensive than some other Japanese restaurants, but due to that, the food is just average.  Nothing stands out as being good or bad.  The sushi that Ebisu, down the street serves, is much better in appearance and taste, but again, the price will reflect.  Dinner for 3 here cost about 2/5 what we paid at Ebisu, but that's an unfair comparison since we more or less a sushi chef to ourselves at Ebisu.\n\nThe lunch specials are good and allow you to create your own combinations.  They have a large number of different sushi rolls to choose from, as well as other things like udon.  Dinner menu items are good too.  Again though, the food is just average; nothing special except that the lower prices make it somewhat of a better value.\n\nThe service is usually good.  The wait staff is generally attentive and polite and the food comes in reasonable time despite a full house.\n\nIf you live in the area, it's a good place to eat, but nothing worth trekking across town for.  Don't bring people here to impress them unless they've never had Japanese food before.\n\nI'd say 3.5 stars as far as food goes, but 4 for value, so round up to 4.", "author": "James Y."}

Ordering over the phone can be misleading. I received a coupon for a lunch box, and asked what lunch box combinations were available for the amount i was willing to spend. The lady rushed me and told me all lunch boxes were the same price until I ordered and found out the Tonkatsu was more than the teriyaki lunch box. I was a bit annoyed, but still ate.

Kiki and Kitaro...  aww, I guess that's cute. One thing that always bothered me was that the wait staff is all Chinese. What happens if a Japanese dude comes in trying to order in Japanese? I can see it now, \"Sorry dude, we don't speak Japanese (here at a Japanese restaurant).\" It just doesn't really jive well with me. If you're looking for an awesome deal this is your place.

The staff is always very welcoming, nice and attentive.  There is hardly ever a wait when I come here. The sushi selection is nothing too extensive but always very fresh, the most expensive roll is only like 6 bucks. The best ones in my opinion are the pink dragon roll and the godzilla roll.  The pink dragon roll consists of  cooked salmon on top of california roll.  Very tasty but you have to wait a bit for the salmon to cool down, I've burned my lip a few times because it was a bit too hot.

At Kitaro, however, we were greeted by a server who never smiled once the whole time he was serving us.  When we were ready to order we tried to flag him down with no avail, plus the other servers did not try to help us at all.
