The honey cheese dip was delicious \n\nThe salmon cracker thing was pretty good. Not too salty. Crispy cracker. Great combo \n\nThe ahi tuna tartare with toasted white bread was decent. It had pine nuts and a quail egg. They mix it all in front of you\n\nThe salmon and steak dishes were perfectly cooked. Nothing particularly special about them though \n\nDessert was good but a bit basic. For beverage, we got an Arnold Palmer. \n\nNice bright ambiance during the day. Not too loud and tables were spaced apart just right. Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the service was not top notch for an upscale place. We were never asked how the food was and we often had to wait a while and flag someone down when we actually needed something\n\nOverall everything tasted as expected. Nothing was outstanding nor terrible. They were just good. Would I go back to try other items? Probably not.

Really looking forward to my Michael Mina experience, however, this place let me down. 2.5 hour dinner should be better than this!\n\nI came here with a friend on the weekday, ok I made a last minute reservation, and got in they quickly seated us, water, menu and all of that good stuff. Service is exceptional. It is probably the best thing they have there. Their staff! Everyone was very knowledgeable about the food, you can tell they were all very well trained.\n\nFrom appetizer to dessert, nothing really stood out! I mean we even paid extra for the lobster, and it was over cooked. Saffron was nice tho! \n\nOverall, I love their presentation of the food and the difference spices they use, but I can't seem to taste the spice that were suppose to highlight the dish.

At this level of fine dining, one should really expect near perfection. So I am just going to start with what didn't work well for our party of 4, the service:\n\n*We had our meal with the reserve wine pairing. First pour the sommelier poured the wine and just curtly said I am pouring xxx wine and swiftly walked away with no explanation. On the second course she did the same when pouring at one side of our table so I stopped her and asked what made you pair this with the meal? After which she gave an explanation, but truly seemed a bit surprised I asked. Her tentative answer made it seem like she felt we were testing her vs actually just wanting a little more info and interaction. She finally gave us a bit more after this, but never asked how we liked the pairing.\n\n*During one of the courses, the waiter dropped some sauce in my water. I noticed when I tried to take a sip. A couple more items came to the table including water refills etc and no one offered to change out the water. I had to flag someone down to ask for a fresh glass. These are things the wait staff should notice in a Michelin star restaurant. \n\n*Wines always came significantly before the meal, one time ~10 min before. So my wine was almost gone before the dish came. \n\n*Only one of the waitstaff seemed genuinely interested/excited about what he was serving (taller whit guy). \n\n*At the end of our meal, after paying the check, no one asked if we had a car, or if they could call us one. Small touch even though everyone prob uses Uber or Lyft, but nothing. We just got a goodbye and enjoy your evening from the hostess. The most likable person we had was the guy who first took our order but we never saw him again after taking the order. We didn't need the same waiter every time,  butt there just seemed a lack of any point of consistency. \n\nSo what did we like:\n\n*The spices were awesome. The way the Egyptian flavors were presented were great. It was everything I was expecting from the tasting menu at Mourad in terms of representing the flavors of a region in an artful and delicious way, but didn't get. \n\n*I am still thinking about the hand cut tajarin dish - so good! My wagyu beef dish was also amazing.\n\n*I usually am underwhelmed by deserts with tasting menus, but this one was so good and creative. I had the coconut corn basbousa. I love corn so this was perfect for me. Others milk chocolate and honey lemon that looked equally good. \n\nWould I recommend it? It's hard to recommend when I did have a few negative aspects to my meal - esp when our meal was over 500/pp.", "author": "Angelito R."}

Michael Mina is a good as any to welcome visitors to SF!  They did change the menu over the past few months.  You still get the mix and match 6-course menu for $155/person, but what's changed is that the flavors and spices are now Middle Eastern.  Chef Mina is originally from Cairo, so its normally very special when a chef cooks flavors that he knows best.\n\nI still maintain 5 stars for the bold flavors of the dishes along with super-attentive service.  Highlights:\n\n1. The breads are all awesome, from crispy flatbread to thicker toast points.  Great with the Ahi Tartar (comprising many ingredients and mixed in front of you with a raw quail egg) or eaten alone with their signature spiced honey butter.\n\n2. Egyptian Mango over Foie Gras was an excellent starter - not overly sweet but nicely spiced and luxurious with that creamy foie gras.\n\n3.  The pasta options include egg noodles with black caviar, or gnudi with beef meatballs and house-recommended shaved Australian Black Truffle ($45 supplement).  \n\n4. Only criticism is the fish dishes - though flavors and presentations were on point, portion-wise they were too small!  The Mediterranean Sea Bass was mostly a soup dish while the crispy Dover Sole is a bit hard to share, being so small.\n\n5. The main dishes were generous however.  Lamb comes with both loin and chop, and you get a side of farro(?) with mini lamb meatballs!  My wife's A5 Miyazaki ($79 supplement) was buttery and melt-in-your mouth.  One of our other companions got the lobster ($45 supplement) and it came with a tiny bit of Iranian Saffron.  That spice costs well over $3800 per pound!\n\nDinner for five with all those supplements and a bottle of wine was just under $1400.  We were not the only folks splurging that night.  On the way back from dinner there was a crowd snapping pictures right outside Perbacco, next door.  Someone unloaded a brand-new, gift-wrapped Lamborghini from a flatbed truck.

On to the food ...\n\n(1).  The starters included braised octopus, prawn and oysters.  This was a great start.\n(2).  I chose the Dungeness crab chawanmushi and it was absolutely fantastic - it's east meets west and the black truffle dashi was on point. \n(3).  Then came the shabu shabu and foie gras - this was a bit of a production and it did not disappoint. The wagyu was cooked in a chicken and fish consomm\u00e9 and then paired with foie, market vegetables and hot dashi. Just perfect. \n(4).  Artichoke agnolotti was a solid pasta dish. \n(5).  Black Sea Bass cooked three ways and every way was great. \n(6).  The main dessert was another highlight - Melo Gold with Olive Oil, Citron and Chamomile. It was perfectly light and not too sweet.

If you opt to do the tasting menu with a sommelier-choice half bottle of red or white wine, it's about 50% less the normal cost.  Here's the skinny:\n\nFood - Super small portions, but ohh so mouth-watering good!  Tuna tartare with quail egg, salmon filet, A5 wagyu beef, and the dark chocolate-coffee hazelnut dessert were all outstanding.  Even the warm bread with honey butter was worth cheating on my gluten-free diet.\n\nService - What you would expect from a fine-dining establishment...fine service.  It was lunch time and fully packed, yet the entire staff was attentive and explained each course to us as they brought it out.  I was impressed with how quick they were to refill our waters and fold your napkins when you leave your table to use the restroom.  \n\nAmbiance - The restaurant is a classy and simply-decorated space.  Perfect for business lunches, cocktail hour at the bar and intimate gatherings.  Most of the people there seemed to be taking advantage of the Travelzoo deal, so perhaps that's why it didn't seem like a pretentious crowd.  No one was really dressed up formally except one family that looked like they came out of the 'Crazy Rich Asians' movie (they ordered from the regular menu, so they must have been rich, lol).  \n\nPrice - Considering we paid half what you would normally pay, the deal was entirely worth it.  Although, I later found the red wine we had with our meal at Trader Joe's for only $7.99!  But hey, it's normal for wine to be marked up like 100x more at restaurants.  \n\nNow if they only did a dinner promo, I'd surely be back for more! :)", "author": "Jeralyn K."}

If you're a serious foodie looking for a world-class meal, you can do much better in San Francisco for half the price. \n\nAt that price point, you expect something world class; food that is a work of art and truly outstanding service. We got neither. The food was just okay, good, but nothing you couldn't get at a much cheaper \"fine dining\" restaurant (it was at the level of an upscale hotel, maybe). And the service was awful. Despite having made the reservation two months in advance, they stuck us at a small table next to the bar area (which was packed standing-room only with financial district d-bags, so we were at ass level with a bunch of loud drunks for the entire meal). \n\nThe server seemed completely distracted and harried. He would look around the room while talking to us, and was unconcerned with the timing of anything. Our cocktails arrived after we finished our appetizers, and he let the empty glasses sit there for most of the meal. He delivered the entrees like he was a waiter at Denny's with two plates of eggs. He started to walk away and we had to flag him down to tell him we wanted to order wine and he seemed kind of annoyed like \"okay, what do you want?\" He dropped the check without asking how everything was or if we wanted anything else, it felt like he was trying to clear us from the table to seat the next party (we weren't even lingering, we still had wine in our glasses and my friend still had her dessert in front of her). \n\nThis is stuff that I don't really care about in a regular restaurant, I just go with the flow, but that's not what you're supposed to be paying for at a place like this.

Perhaps if the toast was served quicker it may have been better.\n\nI opted for the $65 Lobster Pot Pie because I heard they are known for this dish.  I told my colleague that it looked better than a Marie Calendars pie which it was.  Unfortunately it didn't rise to the level of sophisticated 5 Star food and fell short. It sort of looks like poop quite honestly.\n\nNot sure why a chef or anyone would want to eat a pot pie as seems more like something a peasant or servant would eat.  The pie ingredients somewhat soupy and disgusting looking.  Not that tasty especially for $65.  Rather have some lobster bisque if you're going to serve that or just bake it or saut\u00e9ed in butter. \n\nWhat a waste to treat a lobster this way.

I had long awaited the opportunity to indulge in the foodie acclaimed world of Michael Mina no short of a modern day Willy Wonka magical Oompa Loompa kingdom of fine SF cuisine.  And was much to my dismay, quite tremendously disappointed at how (sub?) standard everything was. I'm not talking about the presentation of the food which looks quite (deceivingly) appealing.  I'm talking of the lack of creativity - the zest, the oomph, the extra creamy that defines cream of the crop. \n\nThis is the poster child of commercialized \"fine\" dining in SF. \n\nI begin with the grilled cheese sandwich and tomato bisque. The grilled cheese sandwich was cold and stale - the tomato bisque salted and so startling not unique. Like a Campbell's soup meets smaller bowl, with a drizzle of EVOO. And not in a \"take me back to childhood\" justifiable way that memorable scene in Ratatouille depicts. \n\nAnd the soy sauce based tuna tartar that was but a few morsels of tuna that wished it could be its more exotic and substantial counterpart - the \"real deal\" - Hawaiian poke?\n\nThe seared fish on a \"bed\" (if you can call it that - it was really a few shriveled pieces) of spinach was downright plain, with a few croutons sprinkled on the plate for decor. I don't know what to say about it - it's meh. \n\nThen turn to the way overly heavy and cream infused lobster pot pie. Which was, to my surprise, not hot!  The warm lobster cream made me feel nauseous - reminiscent of that overly heavy creamy sauce that international airlines always serve on their rice or pasta by default. \n\nLast, the pumpkin dessert sprinkled with pomegranate seeds was okay - though I wish it were served hot with ice cream on top. It just felt like one of those pumpkin desserts you could pick up at a Whole Foods - with no technique or effort. \n\nI wish I could like this restaurant like the audience of friends that so treasure it. \n\nThe one redeeming factor was the friendly service and decent open space, considering the cost of SF real estate.", "author": "Vivienne K."}

We did the tasting menu for $145 pp and left absolutely STUFFED. Here's the breakdown of what we got:\n\nCOMPLIMENTS\nWe started off with a trio platter of oyster, octopus, and some kind of fish, compliments of the chef. I generally don't like oysters but it was a nice, light way to start off the meal. Now for the real food...\n\nCOURSE 1\n- Uni: oh my goodness this was delicious and absolutely overwhelming for my taste buds. The uni came in an extremely creamy mousse-like form. Don't be fooled by the small portion size, it definitely is the perfect amount.\nCrab: delicious as well and extremely flavorful. Both dishes really kicked the meal off with a bold statement.\n\nBREAD\nOne of my favorite things and the butter/honey spread is to die for!\n\nCOURSE 2 \n-Shabu Shabu: this one was fun to watch. They bring out raw meat and cook it in a tiny pot in front of you. Then they present it in a soupy broth with vegetables. I didn't love how the boiled veggies tasted, but overall this was still a great dish.\n-Scallops: who knew that scallops could be presented so many different ways? This dish came with three different flavors and it was fun sampling each.\n\nCOURSE 3\n-Pumpkin Agnolotti: I love stuffed pastas so this was perfect for me. The flavor was absolutely on point. My only complaint is that the portion size was much too small.\n-Ricotta: to be honest, I don't remember this dish very well but I'm sure it still tasted delicious. Between the two, I would say the agnolotti was the winner in my books.\n\nCOURSE 4\n-Cote de Boeuf: this was interesting because they prepared the meat in 3 different sauces which is a fun way to mix it up within the same entree \n-Sablefish and Crab: while the cote de boeuf was good, both my boyfriend and I preferred this dish. It seemed to pack a little more flavor. But by this time I was getting so full, it was hard to tell \n\nSUPPLEMENT\nEvery person & and every review on Yelp highly recommended the main lobster pot pie so of course we had to get it. It didn't matter that I was about to burst... I was very happy we tried the dish which is presented looking like a chicken pot pie and then deconstructed in front of you. The crust was perfectly flaky and crispy, just the way I like it. I believe you could either add it to your meal for $45 additional or replace your entree in course 4 for $25 additional. We opted to add the dish because it seemed more economical. (If you replace your entree you are still paying $25 more but losing a course.)\n\nCOURSE 5\n-Pumpkin pie: this resembled a pumpkin pie but with a twist, the largest difference being that it doesn't have a crust! Instead, it had some crispy garnish thing on top. I live for pie crusts, and I was sad to say that I was pretty disappointed by this dessert.\n-Apple Mille Feuille: I really enjoyed this one which had a nice fall flavor with the apple and berries. I also very much enjoyed the light, flaky texture of the puff pastry. \n\nCOMPLIMENTS\nWe ended the night with assorted sweets (chocolate, macaron, etc.), complements of the chef once again. A perfect end to a perfect meal.\n\nAlso shoutout to the waiters, who were extremely attentive and provided great service!", "author": "Alice S."}

Food was tasty as well-- they focused on bringing out the flavor of the food itself instead of pairing it with other flavors.\n\nWe started with rounds of hors d'oeuvres when we first stepped into the restaurant. There were servers bringing around dungeness crab \"tater tots\", deviled eggs, a wagyu robata skewer, and a salmon blini. The crab tater tots were chock-full of crab meat, but a bit too hot in the middle. Not enough to burn my mouth, but definitely enough to be a bit surprised. The deviled eggs were pretty standard. I love a good salmon blini, and the salmon was cut thick and salmony. The toast it was on was slightly soggy, but understandable when you're making a bunch of them. The wagyu beef was pretty tender, but maybe I'm accustomed to the flavor of Texas Roadhouse beef (it's like my love for plain ol' hot dogs over fancier sausages...).\n\nI got the diver scallops for an appetizer. Nice grill marks on this, and well done without being overcooked, though I do prefer mine a bit on the rarer side of things. \n\nThe middle dish of trofie pasta with brown butter and meyer lemon (with shaved truffles!) was like an adult mac and cheese. Trofie pasta is surprisingly difficult to eat with a fork, but I loved the buttery umami-ness of this dish. Maybe my palate isn't quite refined, but I thought the truffle was a bit...veggie-ish and I would have wanted the flavor in the dish. The cauliflower in this was well done.\n\nFor my main, I got the cote de boeuf (beef rib in French). The beef was beautiful medium rare to rare in the middle, with slight chew (that was honestly a bit difficult to cut in parts). I really enjoyed the oyster mushrooms on this, and thought the parmesan foam was quite intriguing.\n\nLast was the pumpkin pie. Tasty without being overly sweet. The burnt caramel sauce on this was good. There wasn't anything that made me love the food, but it definitely didn't disappoint.\n\nSound-wise, the acoustics weren't as ideal for a large party. Even though I was seated next to the individuals I was talking to, their voices seemed muffled and unable to project. Could have something to do with the high ceilings? (Pity, as I really enjoyed those). The restaurant was done in muted tones of brown, and you could see where people had sat over the years in the plush-lined couches, which made the place feel sort of home-y. A 3.75/5 for me.", "author": "Nicole H."}

As context, I chose to do the six course tasting for dinner. The server explained that they had recently changed their menu, so many of the entrees were new. Each dish had amazing flavors, and Michael Mina's Egyptian heritage was clearly evident in these dishes. My favorite dishes were the sea bass with squid and the eggplant. Also, the bread options were delicious as well - one of the flatbreads had truffle shavings with honey butter as a side.\n\nBeyond the deliciousness of the meal, the service was what won me over. My waiter was not only incredibly attentive and polite, but went above and beyond. For example, I had politely declined the caviar supplement due to the high prices. However, my waiter surprised me with a delicious pasta covered with caviar, and said that it was compliments of the chef. He said that I had to try at least some caviar. This was only one example of how outstanding the service is. It didn't hurt that the couple next to me was completely rude and told my same waiter that one of the dishes was the worst he had ever eaten (not sure how truthful that was given the couple cleaned their plate). Again, the waiter tried to rectify it and profusely apologized. \n\nIt's hard for a restaurant to have great food, great service, and great environment. Usually one of these categories is lacking. Michael Mina hit it out of the park with all three categories!", "author": "Avery B."}

The spices were middle eastern which made it a treat since none of us over tasted middle eastern favors.  The dishes were definitely different from other foods we eaten in the past and very tasty.  Since it was a tasting menu, the dishes were small and we left hungry after the meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-10-15", "description": "Michael Mina is the chef's namesake restaurant in San Francisco in the heart of the financial district. As such, you should be able to get a Michelin quality meal for lunch. Alas, it was not to be.\n\nI was in town from Los Angeles and made reservations for lunch. We brought an extra person but the restaurant was two thirds empty so they were able to accommodate us. The restaurant is beautiful. It has a light grey color scheme with white linens with hold accents. The entire front of the staff is professional and attenti be. It has all the window dressing for a quality experience.\n\nWe started with cocktails. DS had the Limbo which is made with bourbon, mandarin and lemon. It is a slightly sweet and tangy cocktail - very refreshing. Two of us had the Other Side made with Whiskey, Cognac and Ginger. This was a wonderful spirit forward blend with nice spice notes.\n\nWhere the bar is a succes, the kitchen is a disaster. We ordered the foie gras appetizer which took 25 mins to get to the table. It had three little bits of seared liver with a fig Balsamic reduction and two rounds of toasted brioche. Having seen another plate of this come by with four rounds of roast, I am pretty sure that they forgot some here, which meant one of us had to have it on sourdough. It was a delicious bite but it does not take 25 mins and should have brioche for each bite.\n\nThen we only saw bread and water for 35 minutes. I had eaten one piece before the interminable wait for the foie gras and I did not want anymore despite the lovely crust and grey salt topped butter. The lady who brought it thought my kids were cute so they probably had a loaf.\n\nWhen our food finally arrived we received hot soup, tepid overcooked salmon, tepid overcooked chicken and tepid pasta. I was furious and reported it to our server. He whisked the petrified belly piece of salmon with a fishy rail piece that I have the two bite test and pushed away. The rigatoni with the lamb and sweet pepper ragu was good in theory but was lousy cold. The overcooked and underseasoned chicken with Mole sauce and butter beans was edible considering the level of starvation after 80 mins at the table. The only good dish was the rich and warm squash soup with unadvertised but delicious shrimp and calimari. The pumpkin based soup even had chunks of pumpkin. Delish. But 1 out of 4 in a place like this is a total fail at the 90 minute mark.\n\nThe manager was gracious, comping our entire meal and bringing us a cheese plate and some dessert, but the kitchen is beyond help. The mismanagement of firing dishes and the poor execution justifies a total replacement of all kitchen staff.\n\nThe cheese plate had three pieces of a rich and dense cow cheese with fig preserves that was super rich and a little tangy. The chocolate cake had chocolate mousse, chantilly cream, little bits of chocolate cake and fresh raspberries. It was rich but a nice and deeply flavored finish. So maybe the pastry chef can stay. Everyone else should go.", "author": "Stephanie B."}

Although I ate there last night and had a hearty breakfast this morning, I'm still starving. While I don't mind splurging on an outstanding meal for special occasions (it was our friend's 40th bday), this place is operated by robber barons. The \"magic eggplant\" epitomized the smoke and mirrors this place uses to trick naive patrons into thinking the food is tastier than it is. It was absurd and ridiculous, and quite frankly, I feel violated in the wallet area. It is actually cheaper to fly R/T to the Middle East than it is to dine at Michael Mina, so get on Google Flights and make plans.\n\nIn some respects, I consider myself to be fortunate. \nFor one, even though it took nearly 3.5 hours for all six of our bite-sized \"courses\" to arrive, I did manage to escape this dining dungeon with my life. Alas, our friend who was foolish enough to spring for the wine pairing (none of the wine was remarkable, and all of the stingy pours probably added up to a glass and a half of wine), paid a king's ransom in exchange for her freedom. I'd get into the scales left on the sea bass, the sand in the mussel, and the atrocious disaster of the cheese dessert, but why? It was all just so sad. \n\n\nThe lone star I've awarded is for the hostess with the intense eyebrows. She was genuinely kind and seemed like a good person.\n\nGo to Gary Danko. Go to State Bird.

We were a party of 5 and each had the 5 Course Menu. I love the Japanese influences on a lot of the plates. Everything seemed to have truffle in it which I'm not complaining about! The bread and creamy honey butter was delicious. We also had a starter (compliments of the chef) of small bites of three different kinds of meat. The octopus was so tender to chew. I don't usually go for oysters but I can see why people enjoy it. It's soft and tastes of the ocean. There's something wonderfully refreshing about it.    \n\n~Course One~ \nDUNGENESS CRAB CHAWANMUSHI\nThe tender crab served atop a savory, light custard submerged in dashi soup was simply delectable. What a lovely course to start with!\n\n~Course Two~\nSPANISH BLUEFIN TUNA (supplement)\nI have to admit this was my first time having otoro (pink fatty tuna belly) and it was pure bliss to gaze at with the eyes and to relish with the tongue. I savored each of the three dainty pieces slowly while musing at the wonder of what I was tasting. It's as if the fat globules themselves sprung to life in my mouth, dancing and subsequently embedding deep flavors of the tuna into my tongue. I ate the maguro last and it was similarly sublime.   \n\n~Course Three~\nRICOTTA GNUDI \nThe presentation of this one was at once simple and stunning with the gnudi placed at the very bottom center of a beautiful crackle bowl. The gnudi filled with rich and creamy molten cheese was fabulously soft and pillowy. Accompanying the fluffy dumplings was the satisfying sweet crunch of Chinese artichokes.\n\n~Course Four~\nMAINE LOBSTER POT PIE (supplement)\nThis had the biggest portion size out of all the courses.The pastry crust was flaky and buttery and filling. We enjoyed watching the waiter take off the top of the pot to unveil the lobster inside. I thought the lobster was a bit chewy. The pot pie was unfortunately not as memorable from a flavor standpoint as some of the other courses.   \n\nBLACK SEA BASS\nI love love black sea bass (almost as much as I love black cod) and these three bite-sized pieces would have left me craving more had I not had a good deal to eat before this course. I remember most notably that one of the sea bass had three kinds of celery. Celery has never been so desirable. \n\n~Course Five~\nBANANA TARTE TATIN \nThis smoky caramel-glazed, ice cream-adorned spectacle was so luscious and fulfilling. I didn't find it to be too heavy as a last course.   \n\nBetween two of the courses (I believe it was course three and course four), we were treated to a serving of delicately shaved ice infused with pineapple and garnished with buds of violet. The tapioca sitting at the bottom was a nice surprise. Just when we thought we had our last bite and that our 3+ hour grand tasting was over, the waiter came with a plate of peppercorn macarons and green tea chocolates. The macaron was perfectly formed and subtle in its peppery flavor. The delicate chocolate was absolutely delightful with its green tea shell and soft, ganache center. These sweets offered the perfect ending to our spectacular tasting experience.", "author": "Lauren H."}

In fact, it was when the restaurant was located at the Saint Francis Hotel. For a birthday celebration, I was looking forward to a dining at the current location on California St.  The restaurant is sleek and modern with the dining room on the left side and a bar on the right one-third of the floor space.  Checking in with the hostess, we were promptly seated at a nice table at the back end of the room.  There were mixed of patrons, from couples to \"business diners\".  \n\nWith our ordered in hand, we were ready for the culinary delights from the five-course menu. So that we could experience the entire menu, except for first course, we each had a different selection. \n\nAmuse-bouche: Plum-sauce octopus, Miyagi oyster, Kampachi tuna.  We were impressed with this amuse-bouche. Usually you would get a taste of one item, but three different items?  It was a seafood trio each with its own unique flavors.  \n\nSesame wheat sourdough with honey olive oil butter.  This house bread was so delicious. The honey olive oil butter spread over the warm toasted sourdough was so delicious.  I just had to request a second serving. \n\nFirst Course:  Dungeness Crab Chawanmushi.  Two large pieces of crab in an aromatic dashi and ginger broth.  A delicate dish. The crab was so sweet in a flavorful broth.\n\nSecond Course:\n\"Shabu Shabu\" & Foie Gras. The server cooked the wagyu beef in a broth and placed it in the bowl with farmer's market fresh vegetables. Oh, it had a piece of foie gras too.  The foie gras took Shabu Shabu to the next level.\n\nNew Caledonia Blue Prawns - Three Ways.  Charentais melon, green papaya, Thai basil; Tamarind, blue lake bean, Kaffir lime; Maitake, Pixie eggplant, coconut.  \n\nThird Course:\nRicotta Gnudi topped with shredded truffles, black trumpet, and artichoke.  It was tasty, but it was probably my least favorite of the courses.\n\nPumpkin Agnolotti with rabbit ragu and Chanterelle. \n\n\nFourth Course:\nMaine Lobster Pot Pie.  This was a course was what I remembered from my first dining experience.  The server deconstructed the pie and laid it out on the platter to be served.  With the fall vegetables mixed in with the perfectly cooked lobster in the delicious cognac sauce, this was just as delicious as I remembered.\n\nCote De Boeuf.  The beef was prepared three ways: Nantes carrot, peaches, Shimeji; Shallot, Rapini, sesame; Polenta, Matsutake, Onion Soubise.  Beef prepared medium rare and each piece was unique with its own preparation. \n\nPalette Cleanser - a lemon fruit icee. \n\nFifth Course:\nDark Chocolate and Raspberry with creme fraiche and meringue. Elegantly presented.  It was not overly sweet or heavy.\n\nAmbrosia Melon and Shiso - Beautifully presented.  A nice light dessert.\n\nThe birthday celebrant received a birthday cake, which was a Lemon poppyseed cake with raspberry filling topped with lemon mousse.  \n\nMignardises - consisted for four candies and two grape macaroons.  Nice finale to the meal with these candies and macaroons.\n\nService was friendly with the right amount of attention. Water glasses filled, napkins folded, and dishes timely cleared.  My only negative point to the restaurant was that it was very noisy about halfway into our dinner.  The bar area was busy and the patrons were boisterous.

Everything from the food, customer service, and presentation was fantastic. This is now my personal \"go-to\" celebratory/anniversary location.\n\nPresentation 5/5:\nOne word, spacious. The restaurant floor had tables evenly spaced out and far enough to where we could have our conversations without being overheard. Previous \"$$$$\" restaurants that we have been to in the past had tables way to close to one another and was uncomfortable. We had plenty of room, table cloths and plates were exceptionally clean, and the small \"candle\" paired with the vase of fresh flowers gave a memorable layout. The lighting in the restaurant was low and created an intimate ambiance between not only our duo but with the staff.\n\nThe presentation of the dishes were amazing as well. Some came out in a smokey glass sphere while others came out in a particularly eye appealing setup.\n\nCustomer Service 6/5:\nThe staff was ATTENTIVE. I mean, every fork, plate, dropped napkin, water approaching the halfway mark in the pitcher, there was a staff member that came to help. Not only our host/server but just anyone on the floor. They kept an eye out for one another's tables and made amazing recommendations on plates we had clue about. Extremely courteous and I could not imagine a better staff group.\n\nFood 5/5:\nEverything that we ordered was amazing.\nWe both ordered the 5-course meal with different plate options so that we could attempt to try every dish. Picking off one another's plate, there was not one dish that we ordered that was not memorable. \n\nTHE BREAD. ORDER LOTS of the bread. I thought Cheesecake Factory took first place when it came to the best bread but this place along with the honey butter was breathtaking.\n\nCourse One:\nPOTAGE OF SANTA BARBARA UNI - Personally, I absolutely love uni (sea urchin). It tastes similar to a more fishy raw oyster. Unfortunately small, it came in a ceramic like shot glass with a fluffy consistency with roe trout roe and onion.\nDUNGENESS CRAB CHAWANMUSHI - MUST HAVE. This was by far one of the best appetizers I have ever had. If I could have had this for all five courses, I would.\n\nWINNER: Dungeness Crab Chawanmushi\n\nCourse Two:\nHAY-SMOKED BUFFALO MOZZARELLA - chunks of mozzarella, it was rather light but much needed after consuming all the bread.\n'SHABU SHABU' & FOIE GRAS - this was rather small but the flavors were interesting. the flavors were definitely something that I preferred.\n\nWINNER: Tie\n\nCourse Three:\nENGLISH PEA TORTELLINI - tortellini was delicious, despite it being \"carbs\", it tasted really healthy and wasn't too heavy since the next entree was the main course\nRICOTTA GNUDI - this is a MUST. definitely the easy winner of the two, basically a cheesy gnocchi, unfortunately only had a few bites. (the dough was mixed with cheese and a bouillon cube was thrown in the middle)\n\nWINNER: Ricotta Gnudi\n\nCourse Four:\nGAME HEN & FOIE GRAS - I am obsessed with foie gras, any and all kinds. At sushi restaurants, I tend to order Fish Foie Gras (Monkfish Liver). Paired with the hen and everything else on that plate, I was enamored by the entire dish.\nBLACK SEA BASS - The plate was very loaded and came with things in addition to the Sea Bass. This dish was being hogged by someone other than me but that was okay, the Game Hen & Foie Gras took the W.\n\nWINNER: Game Hen & Foie Gra\n\nCourse Five:\nDessert was dessert. No one can withstand passing up dessert. I preferred the VALRHONA CHOCOLATE, more bang for the buck and the different chocolate concoctions were quite impressive. \nBANANA TARTE TATIN was interesting in that it came drenched in this amazing caramel. But then again, I am not a big fan of bananas.\n\nWINNER: Valrhona Chocolate\n\nOverall, I am in love with Michael Mina. This place is amazing and I am very much so looking forward to dining here again in the future. Again, everything from the presentation to the customer service and finally, the outstanding flavors from the food? It could not get any better.\n\nThank you for an amazing birthday experience.", "author": "Tom P."}

We were really excited to try it so we dressed up and did the Chef's Tasting Menu. The food was really great, especially the risotto - and the servers were nice, especially the wait staff who came by often to refill our water. The hostess, however, kind of gave us some sneering looks. She was pregnant so I get that she was probably uncomfortable standing on her feet all day but given as she was the first and last person we saw, she could be a bit nicer especially when she kind of plopped our leftovers in front of us in a rude way. \n\nSometimes I don't like going to fancy restaurants for this reason - people being kind of snooty because you are young. I'm suprised though - this is San Francisco - a tech and startup hub. But nevertheless. The waitress we had was really great in answering any questions and she gave good service but when we were leaving and I was putting on my jacket, I noticed she was standing next to us and just as I turned around to leave I noticed the waitress open the checkbook to see how much we tipped. I'm kind of appalled people do that in classy restaurants. My mother used to work in the biz so i'm used to tipping well on the amount after tax. After the kind of snooty service here, I think I prefer International Smoke because the food is twice as great, the bill was five times less than what we paid here, and nobody turned their nose up at us.", "author": "Lena L."}

A took me here for my birthday 2 weeks ago and and really, I am still in awe. We had a 7pm reservation and though most tables were taken, on a Sunday evening there was a lot of space at the bar and some tables did start to open up a bit later into our meal. The restaurant is large and airy and felt upscale, yet not pretentious. Our table could have easily fit 4 but was set for two. There were a mix of couples and groups dining and the room did not feel cramped at all. Our server was over instantly to give us the wine list and walk us through the menu and the different dining experiences that we could have at Michael Mina. There is both a 5 course menu ($135) available where you pick your own meal or an 8 course tasting menu ($195) where you get whatever the Chef feels like giving you. The recommendation from our server was that the whole table should do one or the other to make sure the pacing lined up. We both decided to do the 5 course menu since we wanted to pick our own items and try more dishes between the two of us. We also figured that we could make up the difference with cocktails and by adding the Maine Lobster Pot Pie for an extra $45 which is Michael Mina's signature dish. You could also have gotten this dish in place of your 4th course for a $25 supplement but we wanted to try a few of the meat dishes so decided to just add it in.\n\nWe enjoyed the following drinks/dishes:\n\n~~~~COCKTAILS~~~~~\n-Mayan Runway ($15) - My cocktail and it was AMAZING and beautiful. I am a sucker for anything with Mezcal so this was a no-brainer for me to order.\n\n-The Other Side ($15) - A's cocktail and it was good! I usually don't like very spirit-forward drinks but this was subtle.\n\n~~~~COURSE ONE~~~~~\n-Santa Barbara Uni - Delicious and a good portion, a good way to officially start the meal. I usually don't love Uni but this was definitely the best that I have had.\n\n-Dungeness Crab Chawanmushi - So good, I could have drank this. Unfortunately this is what A ordered so he got to eat all of the delicious Dashi broth\n\n~~~~COURSE TWO~~~~~\n-New Caledonia Blue Brawn - This was served as a trio and was beautifully presented. I liked the flavors of each different preparation but nothing stood out to me. Definitely my least favorite dish even though it still was much better than 99% of the food that I eat.\n\n-Shabu Shabu & Foie Gras - The presentation of this was so much fun. A really enjoyed this course and not only because he is a sucker for Foie Gras. Everything was so flavorful and the portion was generous\n\n~~~~COURSE THREE~~~~~\n-Hokkaido Squash Tortellini - AMAZING. This dish was perfect and the right size as a \"break\" before our mains. A enjoyed this better than the Gnudi as well\n\n-Ricotta Gnudi - Delicious but a bit rich! The portioning on this was reasonable given how heavy and fluffy the Gnudi was. Our waiter recommended this dish highly so I think we just preferred the Tortellini because of our personal tastes. Either way, can't go wrong with this course.\n\n~~~~COURSE FOUR~~~~~\n-Sonoma Liberty Duck - I always order Duck at nice restaurants, if available, and Michael Mina was no exception. I loved the flavors and different components of this dish but there was a lot going on. This was a huge portion! I do think the Duck was *slightly* overcooked and a bit tough.\n\n-28 Day Dry Aged Ribeye - A always orders steak at nice restaurants and this, again, was no exception. This was unreal and SO good. Very rarely is the steak an interesting choice but this preparation was great. A and I both loved this.\n\n-Maine Lobster Pot Pie (SUPPLEMENT) - We decided to get this for an extra $45 and boy, was it worth it. This is Michael Mina's signature and it seemed like every table had this in some form or the other. The presentation is truly beautiful with our server arranging the lobster parts on top of the shell drenched in the sauce and topped with vegetables. I have never had a more perfect bite. This was definitely heavy and rich but TOTALLY worth it, even if you don't have the space to finish it. Seriously, if you come here and don't get this dish, you are missing out.\n\n~~~~COURSE FIVE~~~~~\n-Roasted Peach Tarte -One of the best desserts that I have ever had. They roasted the peach and constructed it for me at the table. Another series of perfect bites. I hope to eat this again.\n\n-Ambrosia Melon and Shiso - A liked this but he also isn't a super sweet dessert person. I personally don't love melon but this was creative.\n\nIn addition to our official courses, we had an amuse bouche, bread served with course two (wish there was more), a palette cleanser between course 4 and 5 and mignardises with the bill. By the end of our meal, we were definitely both overfull. It was a lot of food but I regret nothing.\n\nThe service was impeccable and the team at Michael Mina anticipated our every need! I cannot wait to come back some day as this was the best meal I have ever had.", "author": "Carrie W."}

I had not been in such a nice restaurant for awhile and just wow, a whole different caliber.  Went on a Monday for lunch with my Travel Zoo Voucher in hand ($50 for a 5 course lunch).  We made reservations and were seated in a great booth.\nThe service was attentive, though a little stingy with the bread :(  \n\nOn to the food...the oyster was very nice and fresh, the tuna tartar was also very nice and fresh and had some really delicious complex flavor notes my palate was not used to but thoroughly enjoyed.  The waiter also mixed it for you and cracked a little egg on it  I think I was kinda stoned but I think this occurred.  The gazpacho soup with the shrimp was heavenly, light airy, delicious, possibly my favorite course.  The waygu beef was my least favorite as it was a little too pink for me, but my more sophisticated girly told me it was supposed to be that way, The desert was also a highlight, chocolate mouse, fresh cream and raspberries.  Rich chocolate taste, tart berries, comforting cream. \n\nLastly, it was my girly's bday or half bday, and they brought out a free delicious cake pistachio crust, I think strawberry in the middle, very nice and hospitable.  They also had a little birthday note at the table.  All very classy.  Great experience, and if you are on a budget check out the voucher, or come for lunch for the tasting menu.

We started with a cocktail, Captain Picard's Day Off which is Beefeater gin, earl grey, egg white, honey, cream, and the cocktail was perfectly smooth and relaxing which set a nice tone to the start of the meal. Our first course was a shot of Pea Soup Gazpacho served in a double shot glass, the second course was the Ahi Tuna Tartare with ancho Chile, quail egg, pine nuts, mint and tossed when served and with toast points, the third clues was the Mount Lassen Trout. the fourth course was a Filet Mignon and dessert was a Hazelnut Chocolate cake with a few toasted hazelnuts. The lunch was phenomenal: the pea soup gazpacho cleansed and opened the taste buds with a sweet yet savory tease, the tuna tartare mixed when served provided a rich (from the quail egg yolk) yet delicate level to the meal, the skin on the Mount Lassen Trout was crisped perfectly and the trout was pink like salmon, the Filet Mignon was cooked to a perfect temp and accompanied with a flavorful beef jus, dessert was a cake with a mouse like layer on top of a cake layer.

That being said, they didn't kick us out and we stayed until after 3PM drinking wine. \n\nFood: Food just didn't stand out.

This one had the Mediterranean flair which is quite different than many Michelin Star restaurants I have been too. However, I was quite disappointed. Spending as much money as I did, the service was subpar. The waitress checked on us once thought the service and did not seem happy being there or happy talking to us throughout the night. I do not eat seafood and am particular about certain kinds of meat, so I was told if I needed a vegetarian menu then that is all I would be able to order. Being a Michelin Star restaurant, I figured they would be able to let me pick and choose my meal but I was firmly told if I choose the vegetarian menu that is what I would have-no mixing or matching. The vegetarian menu was sub par to say the least. The last savory course lacked flavor or any kind. The waiter mistakenly gave me rice then pushed it over towards my husbands plate because it was part of his meal not mine. The servers who brought the food struggled to explain the dishes and it was very difficult to hear them/understand what they were saying. The two stars is a generous rating on my end. I have been to many one, two and three Michelin Star restaurants and by far, this has been one of the most disappointing.

A first in my book and so worth every minute to savor and digest each morsel in our 6 course dinner.  What impressed me about the menu, is how each course had its' own distinct flavor and was very aromatic, and yet, not one dish over powered the other.  Of course, the menu comes with wine pairings, but Michael Mina's has such an extensive and diverse wine selection, that with our server's excellent recommendations, I was able to find a smooth French Pinot, which resulted compatible with every dish.\n\nCongratulations and a passionate thank you to Michael Mina, for a stand-out and memorable dinner.", "author": "Elizabeth C."}

We told the restaurant it was our anniversary, and we also told them that one of us would be eating off of the vegetarian menu. When we arrived, we got two regular menus, and the servers acted like perhaps we were a walk in. Over the course of our dinner, couples were sat around us (literally, all around us) who were celebrating anniversaries. Each table got a card placed on the table ahead of time wishing the couple a happy anniversary. The servers came to the table and said, \"Happy Anniversary,\" throughout the evening. We didn't get that at all, and instead had to sit and observe everyone else getting the special treatment and the greetings and well-wishes instead of us. Additionally, one of the couples celebrating an anniversary was vegetarian. Not only did they get the anniversary card and wishes, they also got the vegetarian menus placed at the table when they were seated. We waited over 15 minutes for a vegetarian menu.\n\nSecond: The vegetarian menu had several serious errors. The first: a ROCK-HARD avocado. I mean rock hard. I had to spit it out. It was disgusting. I have never had an avocado that bad. Second: The main entree was a brothy soup. It tasted like boxed vegetable broth with raw vegetables. Also something I could \"cook\" myself by chopping a few vegetables and pouring luke-warm broth over them. Seriously underwhelming, underseasoned, just bleh. It was such an off meal that the restaurant comped the vegetarian meal, which was great of them.\n\nAnd again, none of the issues I discuss in this review have anything to do with the actual servers. The first issue is the fault of the hosts/front of house management. The second issue is the fault of the kitchen. We tipped incredibly well for what we were charged, and know that the server was in a real bind considering none of this was anything he could control.\n\nHowever, the whole dinner left so much to be desired, it ruined our evening, and our weekend, and our anniversary.

Our server (a man with a nose ring) was awesome. He was very attentive and knowledgeable about the food here. I was kind of disappointed that we couldnt do chef's tasting unless everyone does it. My boyfriend wanted to do that and i didnt because i dont like other people picking my food and i was sad that he wasnt able to partake. I had the shabu which was delicious and cooked perfectly. The meat was very tender and not rubbery (when it tends to be overcooked). They cook it for you at your tables and the sauces went very well with the meat. Bf had the tuna three ways and he said its probably the best tuna in his life. I then had the lobster with egg custard which was my favorite dish of the night. The egg custard os actually steamed egg which i grew up eating so it was nice they didnt make it super americanized. Then i had a pasta that was similar to a gnocchi - ive had better pasta so this wasnt my favorite item. Then we had the lobster pot pie in which they serve and break it apart at your table. Huge chunks of lobster but the crust wasnt as flavorful and flaky as the pot pie at the Big Four so if you have that to compare it to it definitely wasnt as good as theirs. Then i had the steak which was very scrumptious. Nice thin slices and cooked with different sauces. Dessert was stawberry mille and a pumpkin dessert but by the time those came out i was way past full and just consuming it to consume.

I've been here once before several years ago and it was seriously one of the best meals I've ever had. I've dreamed about that dinner over the years so I was super excited to get to go again this past weekend. \n\nI arrived to meet my party and we were immediately seated at a cozy table, given menus, and offered drinks. It's been a while since I've been there, and we all had some questions about the menu. About 10 minutes later, our head waiter pops over and asks us if anyone has come over to explain the menu and ordering process to us. I said no, we would love to hear about the menu. He ignores me and instead looks expectantly at the men at the table. Hmm. Giving the waiter the benefit of the doubt, I repeated twice more that no, no one has explained the menu to us and we would love to hear more. Nothing. Only when my brother said he had questions did that move the waiter to proceed. Guess I was just there for decoration. Damn. This definitely put a damper on my experience. \n\nWe all got the chef's tasting menu plus the supplemental lobster pot pie to share.The courses were brought out at a nice pace, and the servers explained each dish upon serving. There was one server that would just abruptly burst into his spiel in the middle of our conversations with an annoyed look on his face. Quite jarring. \n\nThe chef's tasting menu consisted of 8 courses, plus the lobster pot pie we added. Some of the standouts to me were the otoro with caviar, wagu beef, and the fried banana tarte dessert. The lobster pot pie was a huge letdown.  This was the dish I had been looking forward to the most. It was presented beautifully with the pot pie still in tact before the server cut it up and assembled it onto a plate. It looked completely decadent and my mouth was drooling. Unfortunately the cream sauce was completely over salted. Some bites were better than others. Disappointing that the chef was so heavy handed on the salt instead of letting the flavors of the food take center stage. The other disappointment was the HAIR found in one of the new potatoes. See far left potato in picture \n\nOverall, the food, service, and experience just didn't live up to expectations. Five star restaurant with 3 star execution.", "author": "shatier x."}

Dinner here is truly magical but it's the bar and the world class people behind it that secure its place in my heart. Megan created my girlfriend's favorite drink on her birthday. It helped inspire The Lost Garden Found which settled in on the menu for six months. Franco designed mine, a kind of Black Manhattan that contributed to the Don't Call Me Shirley which is on there right now. It's not that we're so great at choosing soon to be popular drinks, it's the aforementioned staff. Megan had a drink in USA Today and can design masterpieces based on just a few key questions. Franco is simply wonderful and makes me feel at home whether it's with clients or on date night. Thank you team Michael Mina.", "author": "Leo M."}

Every course was excellent, but the standouts were the bluefin sashimi, super fresh and fatty and served with wasabi ground at the table along with vintage soya sauce; and the duck with foie gras (which they kindly provided as a replacement for the rabbit on the tasting menu) which included a special tiny one inch pear with foie gras in the center; and finally the butterscotch panna cotta with all manner of subtle toppings. \n\nMost of the courses had a complex amuse bouche type accompaniment (e.g. A really outstanding scallop with interesting accoutrements) so we really ended up with eleven or twelve tasting experiences, not seven.   Even the bread was really excellent: a toasted multigrain accompanied by a spread of ricotta and mascarpone cheese with warm olive oil and herbs.\n\nService by Keith was respectful and solicitous and we were able to savor the courses over three hours (and they took our cues to speed up or slow down the bringing of courses).  The champagne cart brought around at the beginning gave us a chance to try a glass of Krug Reserve without having to get a full bottle.  And of course they kindly provided a slice of birthday cake with candle, an unusual and excellent pomegranate and Meyer lemon cake, and a couple miniature macaroons and gelee at the very end.\n\nThe restaurant has spaced the tables nicely so the noise level is quite low and we felt very private.  All in all well worth the $535 (including tip and tax) price for a really memorable dinner.", "author": "Jay S."}

Michael Mina has been a restaurant I've been eyeing for a really long time to visit. From start to finish they are truly a 5 star experience.\n\nReservations were made for Sunday evening and the restaurant just opened up at 5:30pm. We were seated promptly in the dining room. It was still early in the evening and patrons started strolling in as the night progressed. The first item that came out was from the chef. It was a sampler plate which consisted of octopus, oyster shooter, and shrimp. Along with that was fresh bread with roasted sesame and came with a honey, marscapone, and butter spread (complimentary).\n\nCourse One:\nPotage of Santa Barbara Uni - delicious uni with a very creamy soup (winner)\nDungness Crab Chawanmushi - several pieces of crab in a light broth\n\nCourse Two:\nShabu Shabu & Foie Gras - cooked right in front of you just like a real Japanese Shabu Shabu hot pot. The broth and veggies are delicious. The foie gras melts in your mouth. (winner)\nStonington Sea Scallop - beautifully presented with 3 scallops plated in different sauces. A quail egg sits a top of a crispy fried \"nest\".\n\nCourse Three:\nEnglish Pea Toretellini - freshly made paste with a green sauce. (winner)\nRicotta Gnudi - Gnocchi like pasta filled with ricotta cheese.\n\nCourse Four: \nGame Hen & Foie Gras - Crispy skin chicken was very tender. The foie gras for this course was much smaller than course two.\n28 Day Dry Aged Ribeye - The beef is aged in house and tasted heavenly. Cooked at medium rare, the meat was so tender. (winner)\n\nMid course:\nPineapple shaved ice\n\nCourse Five:\nBanana Tarte Tatin - this was a very rich dessert. \nValrhona Chocolate - reminded me of a creme brulee (rhubarb crust). The chocolate was like a pudding. (winner). \n\nPost dessert the chef once again impressed us with several pieces of chocolates. \n\nIf I had to sum up the night's experience it was one of the most well executed dinner services I've had. Starting from the minute we walked in until we left, we felt that the staff provided exceptional service and were on the A game if that's any indication of their Michelin star status. The way each course was timed to come out allowed us to thoroughly enjoy the fine dining experience. We enjoyed speaking with the staff while they checked in with us about each course.

I expected something spectacular, but instead received a cookie-cutter portion of a standard grilled cheese on white bread and thick tomato soup. \n\nThe next course involved a sous-vide egg which was fairly bland. This was followed up with a pot-pie which was also under seasoned. Dessert was a pumpkin pie bite without the crust - unquestionably the best part of a pumpkin pie!?\n\nWine pairing was phenomenal and service was excellent. At this price range, I want excellence. I shouldn't have to add pepper and salt to compensate for a lack of seasoning and the menu should tell a story or work together to a degree as opposed to a seemingly hodge-podge of foods for both myself and the meat-eaters.

From beginning to end we were just blown away. They were able to seat us  in the back at one of the corner tables as we had requested for a little more privacy. When we arrived at the table, they had left a card to wish us a Happy Anniversary - a very nice personal touch. \n\nAfter much contemplation, we decided to go with the tasting menu with wine pairings. \n\nOn the September 2016 tasting menu, we had the following 7 courses: \n\n1. caviar parfait\n2. bluefin sashimi\n3. grilled japanese ayu\n4. monterey bay squid w/ pain au lait & cioppino butter\n5. sonoma rabbit and foie gras w/ white alba truffle risotto\n6. dry-aged beef w/ purple potato\n7. peach melba\n\nNeedless to say, while the portions may appear small, by the end of the 7 course menu (which actually came with multiple additional side courses), you will be stuffed. Some of our favorites were the caviar parfait with potato pancake and smoked salmon, the monterey bay squid in delicious urfa pepper and saffron (and that cioppino butter!), the sonoma rabbit and foie gras wrapped in bacon, and that divine peach melba! Wine pairing favorites included the riesling (course 4) and the aglianico (course 6). The chef also threw in oysters at the start of the meal, cake, vanilla bean shortbread cookies, and fruit and nut nougat at the end of our meal. \n\nThe service throughout our meal was impeccable - there was never an empty water glass and we didn't wait more than 10 minutes from the time we were done with our course to the time the next course arrived. \n\nOf note, this is one of the more expensive tasting menus compared to other comparable 1-star restaurants. Was it the best meal I have ever had? Probably not. I probably could have done without the grilled japanese ayu and I found the fifth course with the truffle risotto to be a little heavy and overpowering. But, for the overall experience, we have zero regrets. The money was well worth it for a very delicious and satisfying meal and a memorable dining experience. \n\nI would totally return again for another occasion, if nothing else, to try that lobster pot pie.

It may sound trivial, but when your head waiter is wearing an ill-fitting suit and has his collar and tie askew? You know that things are not going to go smoothly with his team. There was just no spark to the food or the mood. And my god, noisy much?? \nInitially it was a bit of 'Emperor's New Clothing' but after I voiced some slight reservations about the meal the rest of my party were all too quick to follow suit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-09", "description": "I've always been impressed by Michael Mina's famous empire, ranging from fancy-pants Pabu to fast-casual artisan Ramen Bar. There's now the trendy Test Kitchen for those who like to be hip and savvy with novelties, but I've been most curious towards the original Michael Mina.\n\nI splurged on the $55 tasting menu for lunch, because who could say no to a 5-course meal. (Plus, it's offered daily, and you don't have to deal with the crowds and often underwhelming menus of so many places during Restaurant Week) \n\nNote that some of of their items are very raw. Although the server double checks food allergies/restrictions for everyone, I guess I was too excited for the tasting menu to pay attention to the raw oyster (tun fact: turned out to be my first time eating a raw oyster) or steak (at Michael Mina I trusted the default, but I prefer medium well).\n\nThe COMPLIMENTARY BREAD & BUTTER was comforting sourdough carby goodness with an outstandingly soft interior, though the crust was a bit tough and the bread was not toasted.\n\nThe DAILY CAVIAR of imperial kaluga, Russian osetra, and California reserve was meticulously presented on an oyster over ice, surrounded by green branches. Since it was my first time eating a raw oyster, it was as slimy as I had feared, but the caviar blend and citrus infusion constituted a pleasant surprise in literal mini flavor explosions.\n\nIntriguingly, the AHI TUNA TARTARE reminded me of Burmese tea leaf salad, with floral from the mint, a kick from the ancho chili, and a crunch from the pine nuts. The raw quail egg added a buttery depth to the ahi tuna. The (crustless!) toasts were just the right thickness for a satisfying ratio with a lavish, heaping pile of tartare on top. I just wish the server would give some warning and cue me to take a photo pre-mixing, because it looked so pretty with the egg yolk and various ingredients in sections. Ugh, the same first-world problems that I have with tea leaf salads.\n\nThe TUNISIAN 'BOUILLABAISSE' was an original take on the French dish, possibly inspired by Michael Mina's early days working in a French kitchen. I think it best exemplified his concept of balancing sweetness, acidity, spice, and richness. At first I thought the seafood looked strangely blanched, but it had just been prepared/de-shelled/de-skinned in a way that made it look naked (for lack of a better description). The quality was fresh, and you can really appreciate the true taste of the plain seafood, paired with a mild tomato-based broth and garnished with a sprinkling of herbs. The creative use of couscous added a Tunisian twist, resulting in a fascinating nuttiness and extra variety in texture. Although the buttered garlic toast with saffron cream was mind-blowingly delicious, I was disappointed that part of it was charred black and tasted like cancer... for $$$$ I expect my toast not to be burnt, but this is basically my only complaint for the entire meal.\n\nAs with most fine dining, the steak was smaller than expected, but I did find the SCHMITZ RANCH C\u00d4TE DE B\u0152UF to be a thought-provoking and memorable rendition of steak. The meat is heterogeneous, mixing lean meat with fat  and a crisp roasty exterior contrasting with a core that was rare-grade raw. Although I've always been too wimpy for raw meat, I did find the robust beef flavors and juiciness quite sublime. The arugula pesto sauce rendered a familiarity similar to chimichurri sauce, and the maitake and confit purple potatoes were a more avant-garde take compared to your typical side of veggies and potatoes. \n\nThe PRALINE PARFAIT was an indulgent dessert, but I unexpectedly gravitated more towards the thin pear slices than the actual parfait. It was sliced as thin as radish, except with an aromatic fruitiness that synergized with the lemon creme and hazelnut bits. The praline was a tad too sweet for my tastes, and in my opinion the dessert would benefit from something mille feuille-like on the bottom as add interesting layers to the predominantly moussey parfait.\n\nTrue to its intimidating $$$$ rating, Michael Mina is pricey especially with the hefty SF tax and additional SF health tax, but reasonable considering the quality and fine-dining-ness. Also, the tasting menu is a bargain (\u00e0 la carte prices are market price for caviar, $23 for ahi tuna, $28 for bouillabaisse, $30 for steak, and $13 for dessert) I really appreciated how each item was a specialty, with no fillers like a random salad. \n\nThe ambiance is relaxing, like a classic high-end sit-down restaurant with high ceilings, satin plush cushions, and golden orbs for each table's plant arrangements. The one thing I did find confusing was how the hostess asked for my first and last name (with spelling clarified!) and my cell phone number after I walked in and waited to be seated o.O Maybe they want to stalk my Yelp review and call me if I complain too much? \n\nThe verdict: Michael Mina lives up to the celebrity chef hype; original, unique, and well balanced.", "author": "Edna C."}

I will be returning to Michael Mina's soon, hungry for more.\"  -Susan C. (who totally just stole from Anton Ego in Ratatouille)\n\nNutshell Review: Outstanding atmosphere, staff, and inspired decor are only possibly out shined by the spectacular combinations and creative treatments of ingredients--which inspire and elevate food into art.\n\nNovella Review: In a foodie obsessed city with a cornucopia of flavors to explore, I have been blessed to have many amazing dining experiences.  However, there is a reason that Michael Mina has received a Michelin star and countless other awards.  It is simply, one of the best dining experiences in the city.  Whether you are springing for the whole shebang or eating at the bar, I promise you will not be disappointed.  As a local, I sometimes fear fancy restaurants being clinical or robotic as they churn through the tourists that flock to them with Food Network stars dancing in their eyes.  This was far from the case at Michael Mina.\n\nOur most recent venture here was an impromptu experience where we wandered in on date night for a night cap...and then ended up staying until closing.  The first thing that sparkled at Michael Mina are the fantastic bartenders Meghan and Miguel.  They proved that fancy restaurants don't have to be cold, aloof, or snooty to be world class.  They were genuine in their care for guests and have put their hearts and soul into their jobs.  From the love and care they showed when helping me choose my wine, to the absolutely flawless martini for my fiance, Meg and Miguel made the night special and as friendly as your neighborhood dive (probably more so!)  \n\nAs we watched the bar efficiently and effectively churn out the most gorgeous creative cocktails (I can't wait to try those after my wedding diet is over) we decided to try some of the sweet treats from the kitchen to end our night. Can I even do justice in writing to the pinnacle of desserts we had? I have pictures of the artistry of it's appearance, but to tell you that we had \"a delicious wintery apple cake thing, a passion fruit foam over chocolate pudding with fancy chocolate crispies, and a chocolate rolled cookie doohickey filled with something rich and creamy I can't remember the name of with espresso ice cream\" does not even begin to express how mouthwateringly delicious it was.  I wish I had  recorded the official explanation given flawlessly by the server, but unfortunately you'll have to trust me that it was hands down, AMAZEBALLS.  One of the most impressive traits of the desserts were the plays on texture.  Also the contrast of sweet, sour, and salt in each bite was inspired.  \n\nI have to stress that at Michael Mina, the food is art.  I love this.  I live for these moments.  I was in foodie heaven--this is my beach.  It is truly a special treat for your tastebuds.  However, if you are thinking, \"I could totally polish off two Chipotle burritos with extra guac right now\"  Michael Mina might not be the right choice for you at the moment.  It is pricey, and you are paying to taste Michael Mina's artistic vision--which is unparalleled.  You simply can not compare it to the same type of joy you get from single handedly demolishing a large meat lovers combo pizza.  Nor will you stomach be bursting at the seams (which is actually better for your health by the way).  It simply is not the same thing folks.\n\nWhat you do get, is a distinctive and unique meal where love, passion, art, food, and people come together to provide a refined yet approachable experience you are not soon to forget.\n\nIt was so much fun, as I mentioned before, we stayed until closing.  Even then, the manager Brian was exceedingly gracious.  We didn't feel rushed out at all and we simply cannot wait to be back.  Thank you to all the Michael Mina staff (even the servers who joked with me on my way to the bathroom) who made the whole date night one of our best ever.", "author": "Susan C."}

My sister raved this place and in her honor I had to come here to enjoy her food. I made a reservation a month or more out because I never knew how popular this place would be. I got the exact time I wanted. We parked at a nearby garage which is $8 flat on the weekend which is good for this area. Everyone there dress quite nicely so we sorta looked bummish but they still treat you just as good. \n\nWe got to choose from the chef's tasting menu or the 3 course meal. Now I am not into those raw tiny bites as I learned from Benu and I would much rather have three bigger courses with some savory food. They give you some small bites that were not expected. \n1) Then for my first dish, I got the shabu which I wanted to know what the American take was. It had thin but sorta thick pieces of meat that they dip in the pot right in front of and took the pot away. The meat was placed in a bowl with veggies and other fixings. I thought the dish was ok and much prefer my japanese shabu. My bf got the sashimi and even though I dont like it, this one piece was so fresh and good. It was definitely his highlight. \n2) Main course: I got the lobster pot pie and had to pay $20 bucks more for it. They said it is the most popular dish here so I had to try it. You see the big puff on top of the pot and then they deconstruct it and form the lobster on the platter. Overall it was good but I am not a lobster lover. It was a bit too heavy and creamy. D got the steak medium rare. The cut was not the best and was sort of disappointing.\n3) Desserts:I got the chocolate trio which had a mix of ice cream, cake and other sweets.

I asked for a non-alcoholic drink and to use apricots since it was in season and he made me the best non alcoholic cocktail ever!\n\nNow onto the food! We got the 3 course meal for $125/person. The best best best dish of the night was the crab ravioli. Amazinggggg a 6 star dish! We also had the tuna tartare which was really good also. Unlike many other restaurants tuna tartare, Michael Mina's tuna pieces were chunky and plump. As for mains, I had the lobster pot pie. It was humongous! I was extremely full afterwards. A bit too big, I would rather have more dishes and each dish smaller. My friend has the rib eye steak, pretty good perfectly cooked but nothing special. \n\nIt was a great experience and definitely a perfect choice for special occasions but in my opinion it is too expensive.

But honest to God - SO refreshing to have carefully prepared food, but also a staff that is genuinely interested in doing their professional job in the service industry. When you get accustomed to people defaulting to service industry work, you can forget that there are people who train for this -- and the difference is staggering.\n\nI could go on and on about the various amuse bouches that we received from the kitchen. Or the excellent quality of every entree we ordered. Or the complimentary combination of wines and spirits for the meal. But I am going to choose to focus on the excellent service of Bryan and Gregory, both of whom contributed to making our dinner an event, and, a memory. Thank you.\n\nFull disclosure - I ate there twice in one day. I happened to stop by for lunch. And it was so good that I arranged to have a small business dinner there that same evening. My full disclosure is that, yeah, I really really liked this place.", "author": "Cathy B."}

But I have a small warning for people coming here: if you have a big appetite and you're down for a big meal, then I would not recommend going here for that. They have smaller portions. But my personal experience was unspeakable. The food is some of the most well- presented and made. Not to mention the great service. Every waiter and waitress walking around is always happy to help whenever you need. Friendly and speedy service is a hallmark of this restaurant, and the same should go for everywhere else. My personal recommendations for food: \"Shabu Shabu\" beef, Dungeness crab, assorted sea bass, roast duck breast, and the cheese plate. If you want to splurge a little more, order the caviar parfait for a starter. Really just an unbelievable kind of restaurant.", "author": "Elliot F."}

The food was amazing and the service was fabulous, but removing stars for extra charges that made me feel very uncomfortable. I'll explain in a little bit.\n\nIt was my fiancee's 30th birthday so we made a reservation through Open Table a few weeks before and I was able to indicate that it was his birthday. We were seated and received a lovely birthday card on the table from the GM and asked if we would like some Champagne. Now the way they ask, it almost sounds like it was complimentary. It wasn't - $16 a glass. So beware. Also, at one point in the evening, my fiancee got the wine pairing with the tasting menu and when i went to take a sip of one of his wines, they asked if I wanted to have a little sip of my own. They ended up giving me a full glass and I was charged an extra $10. Now, I really didn't want a full glass (I was driving), but I didn't bring it up when we got our bill. It's things like this that don't really ruin my dinner but can put a damper on the feelings of a place which will motivate me on whether or not I want to return.\n\nNow, the food was impeccable. The caviar and truffle risotto were my favorites of the tasting menu. They even gave us a little more truffle at the table (not requested and not charged extra for it) which was pretty cool. My partner said the wines were all really nice and paired well with the food. The waitress was very attentive and I know it wasn't really her fault with these extra charges, as I really blame the management in this case. It's probably processes and procedures that they just have to follow.\n\nAs you can see, it was not a cheap night. Almost $700 for the 2 of us (2 tasting menus and 1 wine pairing), but I felt like this was a place that nickel and dimed you out with extra charges. I have been to some really nice restaurants where this wasn''t the case. Maybe that is the difference between Pellegrino World-ranked restaurants at the forefront of the culinary world and just a fancy restaurant like Michael Mina where its more of a restaurant chain feeling and where you can just have a good meal but for a big price.", "author": "Cicely T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-11-04", "description": "Came here last night with a friend. Good food, but was underwhelmed for it being a Michelin star restaurant. Would not return. \n\nWe ordered their three course meal. Started off with a complementary tasting of three small bites on a plate-a crab coquette, a little piece pork and  one other small item. None were absolutely amazing, but were good.\n\nI'd say the first course was the best-I ordered the pumpkin agnolotti. Very good!! Friend ordered the tuna tar tar which was also very good-tuna was very meaty and flavorful. In my opinion, this course was the best part of the entire meal. \n\nTwo things happened in our dining experience that would not have been the end of the world for an average restaurant, but were very unfortunate for being a top service, too food, Michelin Star restaurant. \n\nThe first problem in our dining experience came when our plates were delivered to our table. Each time the waiter would bring a dish, he would speak so softly describing the dish that I could not understand a word he was saying. EVERY time, I asked him to restate what he had said bec I couldn't hear him ( a mix of him speaking super softly, and the dining room being pretty loud). You would think by the second or third time of me asking him to repeat himself, he would make a better effort at speaking loudly when describing our dishes. He didn't and I barely heard a word he said when he deceived all of my dishes. The dishes were very intricate, so it would have been nice to hear what was in them exactly. \n\nNext problem, at the completion of our first course, we were asked if we wanted another glass of wine, which we both said yes to. The waiter brought us new wine glasses and did not fill them until we were halfway through with the second course. I didn't say anything, figuring he was busy and that's how some nights are. HOWEVER, this is a total fail for a Michelin star restaurant. He brought our wine so far into our second course that I contemplated saying never mind to a second glass-since the next course would be dessert and it was a week night/still needed to drive home. The man in charge of refilling water glasses came to our table 2 times to refill our water during our second course, since water was all we had to drink until our wine finally showed up. No apology on the late wine either. Perhaps our waiter was new/busy. Seems a bit unacceptable for a Michelin star restaurant to have bad service like this. \n\nMoving on, our second course was good. My friend got the Lobster Pot Pie and I got the suckling pig trio. She really enjoyed the pot pie!\nUnfortunately, one of my pork plates was overcooked. Again I didn't say anything, and just didn't finish it all. The woman, I believe she was the GM, came over to clear our plates. She returned asking if I thought my pork was dry and I replied yes. She had noticed that when she picked up my plate and brought it back to the kitchen to show the chef. He agreed it was overcooked and they apologized and corrected the problem. Thankful for that! Again, things happen. A bummer my main course was overcooked in a Michelin star restaurant though. \n\nWe ended with the chocolate plate and the cheese plate. My friend loved the chocolate plate and commented how good the dark chocolate item was, and was surprised bec she isn't usually a fan of dark chocolate. \nI got the cheese plate. Boring. I LOVE cheese. I could eat it all day. But this cheese was seriously so boring and mediocre. I normally finish all the cheese on a cheese plate, but I left a ton behind on this one. I guess the cheese plate is not what they are known for here. The cheese plate came with a nice plate of sliced multigrain bread though. \n\nOverall, my friend and I both agreed it was a good dinner. No debate there. Definitely good. However was it amazing? Did a specific plate stand out as amazing? Am I already looking forward to returning? Am I recommending it to friends/family? No. My boyfriend was thinking of making reservations to try it, but I told him to skip it and try another highly rated restaurant instead. \n\nValet is $10. Highly recommend doing it-the location is in a bit of a tricky spot for easy parking.", "author": "Milena R."}

Sure the return of foie gras may not be news to you Bay Area folks, but I haven't spent much time here this year (like in years past), so this was my first hello again to my favorite political meat. And, Michael Mina dis justice to the goose whose goose (liver) was cooked (served) in a savory dashi broth with spring onion, bean sprouts and flank steak. The steak is lightly poached in a hot chicken and mushroom broth-- because 'Murica. In all serious, simply a great start to the meal. \n\nThis was my first taste of Michael Mina, out for a dinner with my favorite BD guys who know how to woo a girl by feeding her the best the city has to offer with a reservation only 2 days in advance. The service is simple, but agonizing nonetheless. Do you want to prix fixe menu consisting of 1 app, 1 entree, and 1 dessert for $125 per person, or do you want the tasting menu for $175 per person and an additional $110 for the wine pairings. The prix fixe menu is additionally broken down into triples (code: modern dining) and classic (traditional preparations) and I believe you need to select your app and entree from the one of these food types. The tasting menu is a 7-course tastaganza that promises to leave your mouth slack jawed in wonder and your wallet empty, but alas the whole table must elect for this option so we went for the prix fixe. \n\nAs noted above, I chose the foie \"shabu shabu\". By far the best item of the night. I followed this subtle and savory masterpiece with smoked ribeye. While the meat didn't have a \"smokey\" taste, it was cooked perfectly and after 2 weeks in Australia I really needed a good piece of steak. The little chanterelle mushrooms were an added bonus. Throughout the meal they sent other \"free\" accompaniments including a tofu starter/ pallet cleanser? reminiscent of a chawanmoshi. After dessert they sent over shortbread cookies and pineapple jelly candy. The cookies were the second best thing I've had-- may this decade.  The dessert options were somewhat limited in both offerings, prix fixe and tasting, so I settled on the cheese platter. It was good but nothing blew me away. I definitely appreciated the soft brie and Roquefort lovers will rejoice over this even richer blue cheese, which I left untouched. While I sipped my bleeding heart (drink of gin, port wine, gold flakes and blueberry syrup) throughout dinner, I really enjoyed the Madeira wine pairing at dessert.

I started off with the ahi tuna tartare-the waiter brought it out and assembled at our table. There was a quail egg on top of the tuna with pinenuts and other fixings (can't remember what). It came with a few pieces of toast (which looked liked wonder bread). The tuna was tasty and light. Main course: lobster pot pie. The presentation was amazing - it came out in a pot and the waiter cut open the dough and assembled the whole lobster on my plate. There were veggies & potatoes on the side. The lobster dish was good & the size was huge, there was no way I could eat the whole plate. The last meal was the dessert, and I got the chocolate trio. I hate dark chocolate, but the dark chocolate passion fruit plate was delicious. \n\nI also ordered 2 glasses of the pinot noir (can't remember which winery) $20 a glass and they gave a bigger than expected pour which was nice. \n\nService: okay.

Waze somehow drove me right into the China Basin as everyone was leaving the ball game--good one... Well, we still got there early after darting through some alleyways and quickly offloaded the car to valet ($10 charge). The hostess was wonderfully understanding that not everyone would make it on time and scooted us over to the bar area to soak up the ambiance and grab a cocktail while we waited.\n\nOur party of eight eventually all trickled in and we were seated promptly in at a nice table in the back room. We had the menu explained to us and opted to go with the three-course prix fixe instead of the 2.5 hour chef's tasting menu, though I definitely wish we had the time to do the tasting menu. \n\nI don't think I've ever seen this many people together and all be completely thrilled with their meal, but there's a first for everything. Everyone loved their dishes. The night, the drinks, and the conversation all flowed and passed by quickly. I'd love to have the privilege of coming back here to experience the magic again, hopefully soon.\n\nKnockouts and highlights:\nDining area was quite upscale and comfortable\nWait service was impeccable\nLobster pot pie/Lobster ravioli looked like the big winners\nSashimi with wasabi root freshly grated on a sharkskin paddle\n\"Highway 4\" and the Elderberry cocktail\n\nMinor quibble:\nAmuse bouche had an awesome tofu+uni. I enjoyed it, but not everyone likes that divisive uni-ness.\nRestroom was a bit small and outdated in comparison to everything else.\n\nIn the end I decided to go with the steak and foie gras shabu shabu (which was a great spectacle to behold), the seasonal trio of lamb, and finished it off with the artisanal cheeses. Not disappointed with any of it as they were all superb preparations, though after seeing some of the other selections I wish I could go back for a do over. Next time.", "author": "Al C."}

I must say...the infamous lobster pot pie was on point!!! Lived up to hype and a very hefty portion (1.5lbs of lobster!) presentation and dishes were all delicious.

Yes, it is worth the price.  \n\nThe service was a bit fussy (a separate person presents each course, with a memorized speech that is clearly memorized).  But the food wonderful.  Some courses are small, others medium sized.  It all seemed expertly created and well timed.  No, we did not leave hungry.  \n\nOne of the best courses was the bread, and I mean that as a compliment.  \n\nThe banana tart tartine, something I have seen nowhere else, was spectacular.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-02-17", "description": "So many things to say. I also thought I reviewed this place before, but maybe it was a rage review in my head, that I never put into words. Now that's it's 3 months later, I'm fuming less, so let me write a little bit. \n\n1. Do not come on a night when Michael Mina's family friends / the restaurant's wine vendors will be dining there. Unfortunately, you won't know when that is. Apparently, all the wait staff will have the attention on them, and it holds up everyone else's reservations. See below. \n2. Our reservations were for 9:00PM, which is already late, but we didn't get seated until probably 9:30PM, even though we had a reservation. They said they had too many people that night... well then don't take the reservation! \n3. So in the half an hour we were waiting for our 'reserved' table to open up, I was getting really hangry, and seated at a bar seat staring outside at smokers. Guess what. Wafts of the smoke smell seemed to be seeping in from the glass / the smokers walking in / out of the restaurant bringing the smoke smell in was really disgusting (to me, a non smoker). And, somehow that night there were quite a few smokers coming out from the back of the restaurant (and then they would go back in, which I found weird, b/c usually people smoke before / after meals, and not during a meal). \n4.) So, we finally get seated, and immediately without any hesitation ordered the set menu... so.... it should have been quick. BUT, we wait and wait and wait. Literally, it was past 10PM, when the first appetizer was served. (Remember, our reservation was at 9PM). \n5.) The meal itself was ok, but not too memorable. I've definitely had better. It was a californian - japanese fusion menu. One dish was blue fin tuna sashimi, which was just ok, but if you order ala carte, I'd skip it. The dessert looked like a cheap out. It was persimmon, seasonal fruit at the time, and sorbet.  \n6.) Service throughout was just incredible slow. We sat in between courses playing guessing games of who the people at the center table that got so much attention was. Finally asked our waiter, who by the way, didn't know. Asked another waiter, and found out above mentioned wine supplier. \n7.) We finished dinner some time past 11:30PM. It was wayyy too late for me. People, WE ARE NOT IN SPAIN. I was so annoyed that I think I told my fiance to leave no tip (and I've never done that before!!!). We had actually wanted to ask for a discount for the meal b/c of the horrible experience, but not leaving tip is a 20% discount without the hassle of wasting time sleep time talking to them. He might have ended up leaving a tiny bit. I still feel kind of bad, because I know it's not exactly our waiter's fault for the untimeliness of the whole meal, but still... the experience just didn't deserve any tips. \n8.) Ok, that's all.\n9.) OH WAIT, DID I MENTION THAT THIS WAS OUR ENGAGEMENT DINNER?! We got engaged earlier that day, and wanted to celebrate with a nice meal at a place others had spoke well of, and was thoroughly disappointed by the experience. \n\n(And as a side note, two weeks later, we went to Keiko a Nob Hill for my birthday dinner, and it was such a better experience. The menu is also californian - japanese, but it tasted so much better, and service was impeccable. All was right with the world again.)\n\nI now have a negative feeling towards anything associated with Michael Mina, and have no desire to try his other restaurants or book any of his restaurants for my company events. I know this is unfair...and unfortunate, b/c his other food might taste good... but I guess I'll just need to wait another few months and see if I can cool off some more. \n\nSeriously though, as a Michelin Starred restaurant (or even not), service is everything, and every customer should get top notch service and not be discriminated against. Would not recommend.", "author": "Cynthia X."}

Pasta was a bit too al dente, and the rabbit lacked flavor. I would go as far as the dish tasted watered down overall. \nThe Three Way Beef... F*in A.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-06", "description": "I remember when Michael Mina was in the Westin St. Francis. My memory served me a little too well, because I almost headed over to the Westin. I forgot it has been on California St. for quite a few years now. Mr. Joy & I once celebrated an anniversary here on a Friday night. Even though the FiDi is pretty dead after hours, I was still surprised to see Michael Mina operating at about half capacity on a Friday evening. I dismissed it and enjoyed having more elbow room to spread out.\nWhen we arrived, we were seated in a cozy booth facing an attractive-looking bar. There was a personalized card waiting on the table for us. Hand-written anything is always a nice touch. \nWe started with some cocktails and complimentary bread. The ramekin of butter was topped with honeycomb, which turned it into an elevated version of sweet cream butter. \nThen the enchanting, seemingly endless tasting menu ensued. Every dish was presented impeccably. Each dish alternated between chilled and warm.\n\nFirstly, Osetra caviar came with a bite-sized piece of pickled radish over some uni hidden underneath. It was just enough of each to appreciate the delicate uni and salty caviar. \nSecond, there was Ama Ebi soup - bites of shrimp in hot, savory dark broth.\n\nNext came the tuna. But before the fresh tuna came to the table, the server placed a container of soy sauce and grated some fresh wasabi before our eyes.\nTwo cubes of bright red Spanish bluefin tuna sashimi sat atop a glassy plate. I pondered how many bluefin are left in the ocean before inevitably popping the flavorful fish in my mouth.\nFour dollops of toro tartare was served with yuzu kosho, focaccia, and beet gel. The 'focaccia' were more like bite-sized toast points.\n\nThe cooked fish courses followed. The Bolinas black cod in kombu miso consomme was very tender. It was cooked with the skin on. The cod had very mild savory and sweet flavors, with a super delicate texture.\nThe king salmon with squash raviolo, shitake mushroom & curry broth was even better. The salmon was sandwiched in between creamy broth and very gooey egg yolk.\nThe grilled Maine Lobster included chunky tail meat and soft claw meat. It was accompanied with crispy pig skin.\n\nA small squab arrived with dollops of thick sauce and vegetables. The second poultry was the Tolenas farm quail with white truffle ricotta dumpling over a light mushroom broth. Quail tends to dry out easily, but the mushroom sauce helped it retain some juices. I didn't quite understand the ricotta filled dumplings. I couldn't quite pick out any discerning flavors and the wrappers didn't really hold the ricotta.\nThe Cochon au lait, or pork with milk, was served with roasted brussels sprouts, and candied pistachio. Finally the last protein dish arrived. Japanese A5 Wagyu sat in cauliflower Sansho pepper jus. It cut smoothly and the juicy meat went down with such ease.\n\nThen, we moved on to the desserts. \nFirst, a bourbon semifreddo came with honeyed apple and brown sugar. Bourbon-flavored desserts are everywhere these days, but I can't say I'm a fan. \nThe hibiscus tapioca & custard was interesting. The bright red, smooth little pearls over creamy custard was intriguing, but I'm not taken by things that taste like flowers. \nThe miniature macarons & passionfruit candy were adorable. The passionfruit candy reminded me of those Chinese rabbit candies. The macarons were good cookies, but slightly dense for macarons.\nA glass with a dollop of Greek yogurt was topped with mint granite and pear slices. It was very light and refreshing. I'm not a huge fan of Greek yogurt, but they managed to eliminate most of the tart flavor. \nQuince - A very light spongecake came with a egg-shaped dollop of vanilla bean ice cream. This simple little dessert was my favorite.\nThe meal concluded when the bill was presented with black sesame brittle. We definitely had our fill of sweets with a lot of variety.\n\nFrom caviar to brittle, the meal could not have felt more lovely and complete. It included well-executed land and seafood dishes. Many people seem to think that the portion sizes of tasting menus are too tiny to satiate an adult appetite. However, after about 9 dishes and oh-so-many desserts, I definitely had my fill of tasty, precision-plated dishes.\nThe service was just as excellent. The staff presented themselves professionally but remained warm and friendly.", "author": "Joy W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-24", "description": "#62\n\nSoooooo many thoughts come to mind as I sit and write my review for Michael Mina.  Where do I begin?\n\nI can start with the beautiful location.  I can add that even though Mina's place is nestled in the financial district, the parking is not an issue--valet.  I can then add the attentive service awarded by the staff upon entering.  Yes, I was sure I was going to enjoy this dinner.\n\nA colleague and I arrived a bit early as we were planning on cocktails at the bar while we waited for our table; however, they sat us right away.  How wonderful--though, I did want to chillax at the bar for a few before gorging.  No worries, I can have my martini after dinner.\n\nThe dinning room is elegantly designed.  HUGE, beautiful mirrors are lining the tall walls.  The music is light--just like the spacious candlelit dinning area.  The space was full, but not packed, with discriminating diners enjoying their meals.  \n\nOur hostess came and supplied our menus for food and beverage.  She let us know our sommelier would be straight away for any questions we had on pairing a particular wine we had chosen.  When the sommelier arrived, he spoke about the region and the notes within the wine.  How it was used in preparing one dish special for the evening and then allowed us a taste to make sure that was what we wanted.  Wonderful... We will take a bottle please.\n\nAs we waited for our bottle of wine to arrive, we perused the menu, checking out the delicacies.  I usually order pretty basically when it comes to Michelin Star dinning, I almost always choose the prix fixe.  I feel if the award winning chef put it together, it has to be spectacular.  My companion went with the chef's choice.  \n\nAfter we ordered, another gentleman came to the table and offered us a complimentary amuse bouche from the chef.  There were three little wonderful compartments of tiny gifts adorning the plate:\nDelicious tartare atop a tiny wonton\nTiny duckling with a chili sauce\nHumus with lovely accouterments \n\nOur wine arrived about this time and it was the perfect compliment to the appetizer portion of our meal.  \nFoie Gras two ways\nMichael Mina's signature Ahi Tartare\n\nThe starters were so delicious.  My ahi was some of the best.  One of our service professionals explained all the preparation involved in the dish and he then mixed my tuna so that all the spices were incorporated, then designed me a pretty \"ahi tuna star\" for my dinning pleasure.  He also explained the foie gras to us as well, though he did not create any artistry for my companion ;)\n\nNext came the impressive entrees.  \nJapanese Wagyu Steak \nTrout and Salmon\n\nMy fish was prepared three ways, and each bite was better than the first.  One compartment offered trout lightly saut\u00e9ed with the skin on, one compartment smoked fish and one was poached.  So seriously delicious.  Though I do not eat red meat, I can say that my companion truly enjoyed his meal as well.  The hostess explained the Wagyu beef to us in a manner that it sounded delicious to me too.  Spectacular and passionate food knowledge presented by the staff upon receiving every course.\n\nAs we finished our bottle of wine we decided on an after dinner espresso as well as a martini.  Now, I am not used to ordering $27 martinis; however, this one was divine.  We enjoyed our drinks with the completion of our elegant meal:\nDessert three ways\nCheese three ways\n\nHis dessert plate had a beignet that was absolutely amazing, a tiny sherbet and some other little sweet thing that was yummy.  My plate consisted of three cheeses--blue cheese, a fabulous brie and a rather strong third cheese I was not familiar with.  I love cheese after dinner, and am not a sweets person, so thank you Michael Mina for allowing me such a delicious end to my experience.  \n\nNow, just when we thought we were done, the chef sent us yet another gift from his kitchen.  A small plate containing four after dinner pieces of deliciousness.  There were cookies two ways, a nugget and a little gingery tasting bite.  \n\nWe finished our drinks and collected ourselves to return to reality.  This was truly an enchanting evening.  Michael Mina's is every bit as wonderful as the reviews and word of mouth from friends and associates.  \n\n*How did I end up at this luxurious venue?  A colleague of mine invited me out to dinner Sunday night--he told me that I was going to love this place.  He was not wrong.  NOTE TO SELF:  I have to make sure to do favors for this guy many more times in the future if he likes to repay my efforts at Michelin Star restaurants...\n\nStephani Smiles for Michael Mina ;)\n#everybitetasteslikeheaven", "author": "Stephani M."}

We're pretty jaded these days, having eaten at some 800 restaurants in the Bay Area, but we were impressed. I've been trying to get my wife to go here ever since I tried Michael Mina in Vegas years ago, and she was glad she finally did. \n\nUnfortunately... her stomach started hurting about an hour after we left the restaurant, and the entire impressive dinner soon wound up being sacrificed to the porcelain god during a prolonged session lasting half the night. Oddly enough, I was fine. \n\nWell I contacted the management the next day. They did an investigation, and of course their investigation absolved themselves. But what can I say? She literally ate nothing else that entire day before going to dinner, so it's highly unlikely to have been caused by anything else.

Also, this was the first time I've ever been addressed as \"Madam.\" \n\nThe restaurant setting was upscale but simplistic - white cloth tables, dimly lit, music playing from the massive and well-stocked bar, and large mirrors in the front dining area.\n\nWe came for a 7:30pm weeknight dinner and easily found street parking just around the corner.

I started off with the Japanese whiskey service and let me tell you, this is probably the most entertained I've ever been when it has come to food or alcohol. I could go into detail of the whole process, but I don't want to spoil the surprise. All you need to know is that there is a blowtorch.\n\nWe went with the tasting menu and it was a good idea - especially if you can't make up your mind on what to try. The only con was that the portions are small, but that's typically what a tasting menu entails. The prawn ravioli was probably the highlight of my meal (even though it was technically a side item) and also their juicy slice of steak. Even though I wasn't completely full after my meal and drinks, I still left with an experience (see: blowtorch).", "author": "Jay R."}

We've both been to a few of his restaurants in and around SF and in the South Bay, but never his flagship restaurant.  In coming here, I knew right away that I was going to go with the pre fix option; how could you not with all of the photos of the beautiful plating?!\n\nIn sitting down and assessing the wine menu, we decided to split a half bottle of Oregon pinot and settled into the menu.  Here's what I had:\n\nCourse 1: Seasonal Trios - Sashimi\nCourse 2: Seasonal Trios - California Fowl\nCourse 3: Dessert\n\nCourse 1 was interesting in that it wasn't plated the way your typical sashimi plate is served.  Between the three types of fish that were served, I definitely enjoyed the maguro that came with a small grating of fresh wasabi. For Course 2, this was sort of a no-brainer for me.  I love most poultry and absolutely loved the squab.  The duck breast that came with the dish was a little too big (never a bad thing), whereas the quail was smaller than what I expected. No surprise that the happy medium of the squab was the easiest one to enjoy.  One thing that I really enjoyed about all three proteins was the fantastic sauces.  The seasonal citrus incorporation was amazing! For Course 3, the Blood Orange Champagne Sorbet and the Shiso Grapefruit Yogurt on top of tapioca pearls were absolutely outstanding.  My friend is a fantastic dessert maker and said that the sorbet was easily the best part of her meal.  The not-so great part of the dessert was the classic beignet, which had a consistency of more of a cake-y donut than the light fluffy beignets I'm used to having.\n\nService wise, our server was nice and had some good recommendations on what to order relative to our wine selection.  He was a little pushy on the caviar option (there are no prices on the menu for the caviar, if that's indicative of anything), and also pushed the wine selection a little hard too.  But, he did give a good opinion when my friend was deciding between the ribeye and the suckling pig trio and told her that the suckling pig is a better experience than a steak that can be eaten almost anywhere. All in all, the experience at Michael Mina is certainly not cheap and is certainly not a place for the casual dinner.  For an intimate dinner though, I can totally see it.  If I come back, it'll be for a special occasion!", "author": "Lisa I."}

The bad: the rest of the 5 course tasting was Meh. It was okay but nothing was great or even exceptional. The strawberry dessert was good but not mind blowing. The gnudi was good but served almost at room temperature. The crab before it was similarly cooked properly but under serving temperature.

But when it's a Michael Mina lunch, on my non-profit salary...the bill footing is nice. =)\n\nI came here with my brother-in-law the other day for lunch. Michael Mina's been on my list for a while, and my brother-in-law was cool with coming here. Score one for me! We made a reservation in advanced, but it looks like lunch time is pretty chill here. Lots of walk-in's, and a serious amount of people who were doing power lunches. My jeans/sweater/trench combo seemed quite relaxed...oops. \n\nWhen I sat down, staff were good about getting me water and situated. I, being the service-conscious person I am, thanked them each time they refilled my water. Which, since I was drinking like I'd been walking in the desert, was frequently. I think they were confused at my thanking them. Huh. Different clientele. \n\nThe environment was very cool. Giant open windows, and seats that were comfortably spaced. There was an awkward moment when people doubled up to sit at the table next to me...and some guy's posterior was essentially in my face were I to turn left slightly, but since I did not there was no big problem.\n\nWe originally were only going to get an entr\u00e9e, but when our waiter came we asked what appetizers were good and he recommended the tuna tartare. He sold us on it (really, I was pre-sold), and we each got one. So good. I apologize now that I didn't take a picture of the tuna as it arrived. It was magnificent.  The taste was very light. It said habanero on the menu, but it wasn't spicy at all. To my dismay, but likely to most people's happiness. I had to mix in additional spice, which they did have on the side. The food here isn't about giant flavors, but subtle flavors that enhance the protein/main on the dish. I really tasted fresh tuna, like the not-so-little guy was swimming just that morning.\n\nWe moved to entrees, and my brother-in-law got the nicest piece of fish I've seen. Per fancy restaurants, the slice of fish was also super tiny, but it was seared perfectly and very nicely displayed.  Carnivore that I am, I opted for the rib eye cooked mid-rare. Because. Really, you have to go mid-rare. It came out in 3 slices, a flower on the side, perfectly placed sauce, and 3 gnocchi that insisted I give them proper homage. Our waiters set down the dishes and after I took my obligatory photo (Asian FTW), we just stared at our food. Says my brother-in-law  \"It's almost too pretty to eat.\"  We stare for a few more moments, and then slowly, heartbreakingly, destroy the beautiful food...in more ways than one. \n\nOverall, great service and delicious food. I'm glad I didn't go in super hungry, because lunch at Michael Mina seems to be two things: high quality food, and super power lunches. Hello suits. As I exited, I exclaimed that I was the most underdressed person there...while a dude who was also in jeans and a trench walked by and stared at me. Oops.", "author": "Lily W."}

For young adults in SF, going to Michael Mina's is a treat. However, after the meal we left feeling underwhelmed.\n\nIt's important to note that there are three dinner menu options: a la carte (at the bar only), a prix fixe three course menu ($125 per person) or a seven course chef's tasting menu ($170 per person I believe). \n\nWe went with the three course prix fixe and between the two of us had the following: \n\nCourse One\nSashimi (him)\nHot and Cold Sea Scallops (me)\n\nCourse Two \nTaste of the Sea (him)\nPhyllo-Crusted Dover Sole (me)\n\nCourse Three\nDessert (him)\nCheese (me)\n\nI won't go completely into detail on every course, but I'll share a few thoughts. I enjoyed the hot and cold sea scallops, but the dover sole was too rich for me. We enjoyed the touch of fresh wasabi from Marin with the sashimi, but aside from that, didn't feel it was anything special. Oddly enough, one of the highlights was the fresh bread they served with a honey and ricotta cheese spread. \n\nWhen it came to the cheese platter, quite frankly, I felt a little ripped off. It came with two small pieces of cheese from Cow Girl Creamery and one piece of an Italian cheese. The presentation was nice, but I'd rather just buy the cheese down the street at the Ferry Building for five times the quantity and a fraction of the price. Of the dessert, I tried the beignet, which was a bit dry and not very flavorful.\n\nFor drinks, we each had a glass of red wine to start (ordered at the bar) and then had the sommelier choose a glass of wine to pair with our second course. We enjoyed the wine, but felt the pour was a bit stingy, especially for the price per glass.\n\nService. We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and were told our table wasn't quite ready, so we grabbed a glass of wine at the bar where we noticed that more than half of the tables sat empty. This was a bit surprising considering it was Friday night at prime time. It also made us wonder why our table wasn't \"ready\", but we were happy to take our time with the evening anyway. \n\nAt the bar, my boyfriend inquired about one of the red blends on the menu to which the bartender responded \"uhhh it's just a mix of grapes.\" At first I thought it was a joke, but he didn't provide any further explanation, so he went with a pinot noir instead. \n\nAfter a few sips of wine, our table was ready. We were sat directly next to another couple on a cozy bench in the back corner. It felt a little odd to be seated so close to another table when many others sat empty. We were fine with it, but the other couple that had already been sitting there seemed a little put off.   \n\nOverall our server did a great job, as did the bussers and food runners. We really enjoyed the pace of the meal. Despite some other reviews, we didn't feel rushed. It was a nice meal but for the price and the hype we sadly just didn't feel it was worth it.", "author": "Amy H."}

We were seated at our preferred booth table where there was a hand-written birthday card waiting. \"How nice!\", I exclaimed. The night looked promising (but oh, how I was wrong!).\n\nOn to the food! The dishes were decent, but didn't blow our socks off. Is it sad to admit that our favorite dish was the free amuse bouche? The portions were also annoyingly tiny - the courses are meant to be shared, as each person receives different dishes, but we found this extremely difficult as everything was bite-size.\n\nHowever, the real reason for my lukewarm rating is due to the staff's unacceptable NEGLIGENCE toward my dietary restriction. At the beginning of our meal, I clearly notified our server that I don't eat pork. I told him if they were unable to remove the pork component of a dish, then to please give that dish to my companion and let me know so I would not unknowingly try it. He assured me that this would be fine, but my request was blatantly ignored as different staff members served us. I recall two such incidences during my meal:\n\n1) A dish containing prosciutto was placed in front of me. I did not realize this until the server started describing the dish. When I asked him to confirm that I had heard correctly, he seemed completely unaware of my pork abstinence. I had to ask him to switch my plate with the birthday boy's (whose dish did not contain pork).\n\n2) The birthday boy received a two-part dish. The idea was to eat the top dish before the servers would whisk the empty plate away to reveal a second morsel underneath. I asked the server if the second part had pork, to which he confidently responded, \"This dish does not contain any pork.\" However, a different server did the unveiling and described part two as a pork dish. Seriously?!\n\nTO THE STAFF AT MICHAEL MINA: Dietary restrictions are SERIOUS and should not be taken lightly. I hope your staff receives strict training on properly handling this matter for the safety and well-being of future patrons.", "author": "Suany W."}

I'm sad to say that not a single one was met. As far as I can tell, Mr. Mina's restaurants get by on his fame and a severe case of the Emperor's New Clothes. In summary: Crazy mega-overpriced fare that is good but does not impress, and lackluster service. \n\nI ordered a whisky with an orange twist while waiting at the bar because the bartender had precisely zero recommendations for a bourbon cocktail that wasn't an Old Fashioned or Manhattan. I brought my drink with me to finish at the table, but once we had placed our orders nobody ever came by to ask if I might want another. I eventually reached out to the server at the next table to see if he could find our server. Pretty sad. To his credit he did actually show up one more time to take my drink order...\n\nThe food itself is unremarkable. Being a big fan of lobster I of course went for the lobster pot pie.

For a classy restaurant, the ambiance was not what I expected - it was really loud and kind of crowded so it was hard to have a conversation without having to raise our voices. Our servers were very nice and professional though. \n\nThe only dinner option available was the 3 course pre-set menu for $105. For our appetizers we ordered the tuna tartare and the sashimi tasting as our appetizers, the flight of birds (duck, squab, and quail) and ribeye as our entrees, and the cheese plate and dessert trio for dessert. Our appetizers were both pretty good and the fish was very fresh. No complaints about either. Our entrees were tiny though, hardly enough to share...I know fancy restaurants give small portions but I expected something a bit larger, especially since this was only a 3 course meal. The steak was decent, nothing extraordinary. The duck was kind of dry and the tiny squab and quail thigh were barely enough for two bites but the combination of flavors of this dish were delicious. The cheese plate was kind of a joke - we laughed at the specks of cheese on my boyfriends plate because they looked like crumbs. Luckily, the dessert trio made up for it.  \n\nParking is very difficult in this area but not impossible if you don't mind walking a few short blocks.

One dish paired uni with house made tofu, which was had too much of a creamy texture for me. \n\nThe foie gras was also a bit too salty. I think it could have been paired with more fruit or something else to balance out the saltiness. My bf and I could barely finish our foie gras, and we normally can't get enough. \n\nOther then those dishes I think everything was presented beautifully and with the best combinations of flavor. While some dishes were \"safe\" I think it was a nice little break to have something a little familiar. \n\nIf Michael Mina continues to come up with innovative ways to pair fresh ingredients with bold flavors then there should be no reason why you shouldn't try this place out.", "author": "Thuy T."}

It is one of my go to spot when I have clients visiting my office.  $55 for a 4-course tasting menu is not bad at all.  They also have a 3-course option.  The service is impeccable and the ambiance is perfect for a lunch meeting.  The place is small and intimate, away from FiDi's loud lunch crowd.  \n\nMy favorite out of their current menu is the Hamichi Sashimi (blackberry vinaigrette, kombu, radish, avocado).  The blackberry and fish blended beautifully.  It is the perfect appetizer during a hot summer day.\n\nI ordered the Mediterranean Sea Bass (charred, eggplan puree, haricot verts, bacon-balsamic jus) and I could not be happier with my order.  My coworker had the Risotto and it was a tad underwhelming when I tried it.  I was lucky enough to see Michael Mina walking out of the kitchen the last time I visited. \n\nWould I go back?  Yes.

Read on to find out why! \n\nThe Bread w/ Salted Butter:\nGreat bread and butter. Didn't expect any less at this level of dining. No complaints! \n\nRomaine Salad: truffle caesar vinaigrette, crouton, black olive crumble\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/michael-mina-san-francisco-2?select=4xBKJWGtTvT4x-e3uiv2OQ)\nThe salad was very satisfying in terms of portion and quality. It was lightly tossed and the ingredients were very fresh. But, at the end of the day, it was a very simple romaine salad and didn't have the outstanding touch that I expected at a restaurant of this caliber. \n\nTuna Tartare\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/michael-mina-san-francisco-2?select=rL9aumAxKN04bTpVTFAoFA)\nThis is a dish that the waitress pushed for and I decided to try it out. It was very disappointing. The fish was bland and overwhelmingly doused with sesame oil. By the end of the dish, all I could taste was sesame. It was a total let-down. I hope yours taste better if you get it! \n\nMediterranean Sea Bass: charred eggplant puree, bacon-balsalmic jus\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/michael-mina-san-francisco-2?select=sPKuvNLGJRyJchcfFxid4w)\nThis dish acted as the saving grace for this set meal course. The bass was prepared with great skill. The texture was perfectly crisp on the outside (skin) and the meat was tender and juicy. The eggplant puree was a rollercoaster of great flavor and the vegetables were cooked perfectly. 10/10 would try again. \n\nSmoked Sea Salt Cookies\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/michael-mina-san-francisco-2?select=HPJAQ2l3qOFc4QPhTiveyw)\nAs I am writing this review, I have yet tasted these bad boys yet. From what I've heard, they are divine. The meal sated my appetite and the cookies would have been over the top for me. The presentation is a slight let down though. I expected the cookies to be left on a dish of some sort with an option to take away. I understand in the busy SF work lunch culture, its all about time and efficiency, unfortunately this sad bag of 3 cookies did not leave me with a happy memory of this place. \n\nTLDR;\n\nPro: Bread/Bass was delicious! Overall food quality is on par w/ most 4$ restaurants \n\nCon: It had the appearance and decor of a fine dining place, but the experience was disappointing.\n\nFood: Tartare was 'meh'\nThe Service: was lackluster for a restaurant of this caliber. Our table crumbs were not swept away from the beginning and had to be requested by the guests to be done. The waiters pushed appetizers and desserts on our table - which I found to be a little much all things considered.", "author": "Matthew S."}

Our seats were more of a booth style seating, which was nice and comfortable, however a little too intimate for the occasion.\n\nMy friend, Ryan, was visiting from Oahu so I wanted to take him somewhere nice in SF, hoping to impress him with the dining experience.  Unfortunately, I felt like I failed him because he did NOT seem impressed at all...but then again, neither was I.\n\nThe service was impeccable and the restaurant itself is very nice, clean and modern looking.  Our server, Honor, was excellent and had a very professional demeanor.  She was very attentive and friendly.\n\nThe food, however, was not a wow factor of our dining experience.  Everything that we ordered was simply ok, nothing outstanding.  For $100/person, I was expecting something more...I felt kind of let down because I wish I had taken him to Roy's instead.  But I guess we both enjoyed the service more than enough not to let the food become the main factor of our overall experience.  He also had two Grey Goose so I'm sure he could care less what his meal tasted like by then...\n\nThe only thing that truly stood out for me was my main entree, the duck breast.  It was cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside and medium rare on the inside.

We opted for the 3 course for $125 each but added the Maine lobster pot pie as an additional dish. The restaurant is beautifully elegant with high ceilings and warm earth and charcoal grey colors. Service was plentiful but we did notice that multiple waiters were nervous and had a hard time describing our dishes from our left to right and instead described the trios from their left to right. The sea same bread had great flavor and was warm but almost too crunchy and charred. The honey butter was heavenly though. \n\nWe started with the amuse bouche which were great pops of flavor except from the halibut fritter which tasted too fishy and lacked any kick. The first courses we selected were soft shell crab and shabu shabu with the Japanese A5 wagyu ($35 supplement) and foie gras. The broth was very tasty and the portion of foie gras petite but served with lots of vegetables and a great garlic sauce. The soft shell crab was average but the accompanying sauces were great. Our favorite was the tomato relish. The duck main course was much better than the pork belly which we thought was overcooked and chewy. The lobster pot pie was a standout. They deconstruct it and recreate the lobster on your plate! They even took the pot back to cut off all the crust for me. We both opted for the chocolate dessert. It was light and consisted of white chocolate, 35% chocolate and 72% chocolate. They brought by raspberry gelees and shortbread with the bill. Overall a beautiful dining room with attentive service and a couple standout dishes!", "author": "NJ A."}

My boyfriend and I were celebrating our anniversary and they really helped make our night special. They gave us a card wishing us a happy anniversary, which already left a great impression on me. \n\n2) We chose to do the 3 course meal instead of the tasting menu. For starters, they gave us complimentary appetizers (mini taco, amazing souffle type of sauce, and fish) along with some sesame bread and homemade sauce (which was amazing!!). For the first course, I choose the squid ink pasta. This dish was slightly salty and a little heavy for me for an appetizer. I would recommend this if you are really hungry and love pasta. My boyfriend got the sashimi which I would definitely recommend. They even give you fresh wasabi and each sashimi was paired with very complimentary sides. The second dish I picked was the Duck Foie Gras. Again, I was full from the pasta (keep in mind I snacked a little before coming to the restaurant, rookie mistake!) so I couldn't fully enjoy the dish. The duck was cooked the perfect amount and there were three different types of pairings. It ranged from an Asian taste to sweet. My boyfriend chose the pork dish, and I LOVED the crispy pork belly! (The general trend of this meal was me eating all of the boyfriend's food). For the last course, I picked the artisanal cheese plate. This came with bleu cheese, brie, and mystery cheese (I forgot, sorry) along with complimentary sides and bread. As a cheese lover, this was my favorite. Each cheese had a strong taste and paired nicely with wine and bread. \n\n3) The sommelier gave us fantastic wine suggestions and was not bothered by our basic questions. \n\n4) The ambiance reminded me of a classy business office (not in a stuffy boring way). I loved how we got to sit on plush couches, which makes eating so much more enjoyable. There were candles everywhere and even the plant decor chosen made me feel relaxed and comfortable, yet fancy. \n\nI would highly recommend coming here!

I have been to Michael Mina many times in the past - at this location as well as the prior location near Union Square, and the one at Bellagio in Las Vegas.   One time, I got to meet Michael Mina in person, which was nice.  I think it's one of the better picks to enjoy tasting menu in the SF Bay Area, especially if you like modern-American cuisine with a touch of Japanese.  As usual, they did not disappoint this time.  Most of the dishes were creatively prepared with good presentation and flavor.  Service was outstanding.  The primary server seemed very experienced and was friendly.  Rest of the support staff were helpful too.  As expected, for each course, all plates were brought to the table simultaneously, which involved multiple servers.  We had wine pairing, which I highly recommend.  It was good that they allowed \"half\" wine pairing for a family member who wanted to limit alcohol intake, but still wanted to take part in the pairing.  Everyone started out with Champagne, and then they skipped every other glass for her after that (for half the price).\n\nThe dining area near the front entrance can be a little cramped, but this time we were seated in the mid-back section, which has little more space between tables.  Some of the nearby streets have no-turn restrictions and sometimes detours due to constructions; unless you are very familiar with that area, it may require some patience driving to the restaurant even with a GPS.\n\nOverall a very pleasant experience and I will surely return for another round of tasting menu worthy of the Michelin star.", "author": "James P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-06-03", "description": "This is such a tough review to write because I wish I could give Michael Mina a higher review. \n\nMy review is so low because of the food and service. All of the food was alright/good but had no wow factor as justifcation for the price. My table was slightly neglected and ignored. Overall, I felt so disappointed by the end of the meal. \n\nFood:\nIt could just be my taste palette, but i felt like none of the foods tasted very good. My friend and I both ordered the four course meal and spilt to have a taste of as much as we could. A lot of the items of food were good, but nothing that really WOWed us. I really thought that it was me, but we both felt that the food was prepared and presented nicely but flavors lacked luster. \n\nThe tune tartare that shows up frequently in the pictures was something I expected to like. I thought that the mint was overpowering and didn't enhance the flavor of the tuna, but masked it. It was really bland, it didn't have much flavor except tuna and oil. The pine nuts in it were okay to me; I could see someone enjoying the crunch to break up the fleshy texture of the fish, but it was insignificant to me. \n\nThe foie gras appetizer was good but extremely heavy. It was only served with a small, super saturated piece of toast. The little toast was soaked in butter and when paired with the foie gras, it was definitely too rich for me. \n\nThe rib eye and salmon were both good, but nothing special. The halibut dish was definitely nothing special to me. It was with a ponzu sauce that was as complex as soy sauce diluted with water. \n\nThe dish that perplexed me the most was the lobster. In theory, it should have been something that I really liked. I like lobster, corn, and potatoes. Yet, i didn't like how the corn was treated. It tasted so artificial, like they blended those Asian round corn puff chips with water to make a paste. It was overly sweet compared to the lobster's subtle sweetness, so when they were paired together, the dish was sugary to me. The chowder was sweet too and sugar snap peas were sweet. it was just so one-noted for me. \n\nThe desserts were alright. I got the chocolate with pistachio. The pistachios were gritty and felt soggy as it coated the chocolate. The chocolate was rich and had good flavor. The ice cream was yummy, but I guess i had higher expectations? I'm not sure, probably by this time, I was over it. \n\nService:\nI feel like the service for our table wasn't great because of where we sat. We were seated in the corner table by the wall on the far left side when you walk in. As the servers walked by, we're in their blind spot behind a wall. I could understand being ignored as we aren't in their view at all, but I would expect that they could be aware of this. \nI would have felt less ignored if we got the chance to order from the time the server came with our water. She left us with our menus and gave us a good chance to look over it while she got the water. We were ready to order, but she walked away too quickly. I had been itching to try this place, so I was being observant of the server after I felt like we were being ignored due to our seating. \n\nAll in all, it wasn't great but it wasn't terrible. It was good, but I definitely had higher expectations. Due to the fact it is on the pricer side, I wouldn't try this place again. There are many restaurants in San Francisco to be ranked the same as Michael Mina, and I would like to try those as well. I hope that I will be able to try this place again, but for now this is all she'll write.", "author": "Tina Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-04", "description": "So this is the first Michelin star restaurant I've been to. My friends and I decided to do the 4-course for lunch. \n\n1) Artisan Foie Gras (cherry compote, marcona almond, pain de mie, ginger) - The flavor of the pate was very rich, a bit too rich to eat the amount given without feeling overwhelmed. The bit of pain de mie complemented the foie gras, but once again I would have preferred more balance in this dish. My favorite part was actually the addition of the cherries which counteracted the richness of foie gras. This dish was your standard fancy dish. \n\n2) Ahi Tuna Tartare (habanero-infused sesame oil, pine nut, quail egg yolk) - This dish impressed me with not only the presentation (which I sadly did not get to take a picture before the serve mixed the dish), but also the combination of the oil, quail egg yolk, pine nuts, pears and other spices. I also loved the magic the touch of mint did to this dish. The tuna tasted very fresh and overall, this dish was so light but yet so flavorful. Definitely the best ahi tuna I've ever had! \n\n3) Local King Salmon (sushi rice, shiitake, sugar snap pea, yuzu-miso broth) - I've never been a big fan of salmon, but this salmon was cooked to perfection. The outside was crispy, yet the inside was so soft that I didn't even need to use a knife to cut it. I really liked the particular small additions to this dish: the pickled radish and shiitake mushroom. The sushi rice went really well with the yuzu-miso broth because of the sushi vinegar in the rice. Overall, I was awed by this salmon dish!\n\n4) Prime Black Angus Rib Eye (red quinoa, asparagus, black garnet cherry, villa manodori balsamic) - I love love love steak, so I was super excited to try this! This is probably the most tender and flavorful steak I've ever had. You could really taste the flavor of the meat and every bite was pretty much heavenly. The crust was done delectably crispy. When I tasted the balsamic by itself, I really liked it, but I didn't feel like it added to the entire dish much. Other components like the red quinoa and asparagus were pointless in my opinion. Potatoes were done very well- nice and warm and flavorful. The steak was too good, so overall this dish was my favorite savory one!\n\n5) Dessert (chicharron, chantilly cream flavored jasmine, hibiscus foam, raspberry compote, and tapioca) - This was my favorite part of the meal. I personally love dessert and when I realized dessert was included, I was so excited. The chicharron was like a light, crunchy chip. To me, it was like eating a chip dipped in a sauce that bursted with tarty (hibiscus foam), sweet (raspberry compote), and flowery (chantilly cream) flavors. Each bite was so divine, I savored every bit of it. I think this dish changed my perspective on desserts in general. To be able to present a dessert that was not focused on being sweet but rather on ingredients that harmonized so well to bring out the right combination of different flavors, the creator of this dessert nailed it!\n\nAfter this wonderful experience, I would recommend this place 100%.

It has been around back to the days of Aqua, Michael Mina's first restaurant. Speaking of back to the days of Aqua, Ron Siegel is executive chef here. He worked in Aqua before becoming chef at Charles Nob Hill, where at the time became the first and only American chef to beat an Iron Chef in Japan with the secret ingredient being lobster, which leads to the restaurant's other favorite...  \n\nThe Lobster \"Pot Pie.\" It is known as a deconstructed pot pie being that you have all the elements of a pie presented on the plate not in the form of a pie. They give you a good amount of lobster claw and tail meat and it is delish. I would say almost every time I order this, I would notice the table next to mine ordering the same. If you want the real pie form, go to Mina's other restaurant, Bourbon Steak.\n\nLunch time is relatively quiet but dinner is a completely different story.

After researching different restaurants, I decided to take my bf here for his birthday.\n\nWe were greeted with big smiles, I had my coat checked and then we sat at the bar while they prepared our table. Before I was able to order a cocktail, our table was ready! I was super appreciative that they accommodated us so quickly since we were half an hour early. There was a happy birthday greeting card for my bf at our table. Great touch Michael Minas! Although it would have been pretty cool if the chef himself signed it :)\n\nInitially, we were looking to order from the four course dinner menu, since we were worried that the 11 course tasting menu would too filling. Our friendly server assured us that wouldn't be the case. BEST DECISION EVER.\n\nTasting menu (Paired with a Calera Mills, Pinot): \n1) osetra caviar\nWow, now I know why caviar is all the rage. The flavors of the caviar meshed so nicely with the smoked uni and avocado. It was a symphony of flavors in your mouth.\n\n2) spanish blue fin 'belly side' \nExtremely fresh sashimi. My favorite part was the fresh wasabi grated right in front of you. Surprisingly fresh wasabi was not as overpowering as you would think. I don't recommend using the soy sauce, just simply put a dab of the wasabi on the fish and enjoy!\n\n3) onsen tamago \nThis egg was cooked to perfection, I believe at 200F? But it wasn't runny or hardboiled, just beautifully done. The yolk was amazing with the crispy appetizer and the miso mousse.\n\n4) big fin squid \nThis one was definitely one of my top favorites of the night. The fish was cooked just right, nice and sweet. The squid ink kind of reminded me of soba but even better. I'm still salivating think about this one.\n\n5) Japanese ayu\nSimple and fresh dish, not much to say about this one.\n\n6) poached halibut\nMm, best halibut I've ever had. The fish was taken off the pan at the most optimal time. The peas were so sweet and paired nicely with the fish.\n\n7) butter poached maine lobster\nbrooks cherry, tokyo turnip, lobster hollandaise\nOh my, lobster and foie gras? YES please, the foie gras was amazing with the lobster, I must say it was a tad bit heavy but all the flavors worked. The acidy of the sauce helped balanced the dish out.\n\n8) crispy pork confit\nThe pork was really awesome, it almost had a pulled pork consistency and had a crispy candied skin. \n\n9) japanese a-5 wagyu\nMy first time tasting a-5 wagyu, now I understand why people pay big money for this. OMG, I think I died and went to heaven, the wagyu literally melts in your mouth. I'm also glad they did not drench this beautiful piece of meat with sauce.\nJust amazing, also my top favorite of the night.\n\n10) tarragon-yogurt sherbet \nNice and refreshing after all the salty courses we had previously. \nSweet and tangy.\n\n11) dark chocolate sicilian pistachio, lemon-pistachio sorbet\nI enjoyed this one over the previous dessert, the pistachio covered dark chocolate was so good. The crunch also gave it nice textures while the tangy sorbet finished it off. \n\nWe also had an amazing amuse bouche in the beginning with a cream of (something) mushroom? And the last amuse bouche was some Carmels with mint macarons. I really wish they sold it in boxes, I would have bought some.\n\nOverall, we truly had an amazing experience. The food, ambience, and the service was impeccable. Well done Michael Mina!\n\n5 STARS", "author": "Karen L."}

It was marvelous.\n\nThe place is very elegant, and I loved how it smelled like wet stone. Is that a strange thing to notice? Fresh and clean and earthy...it reminded me of the smell of this one spa I went to in Hawaii...but I digress...\n\nThe meal opened with an amuse bouche from the chef, which was a single prawn deep fried in a delicate wrap with two capers for eyes (it was cute), some kind of mousse with a harissa cr\u00e8me fraiche, and a savory panna cotta with roe. Very interesting. Tiny bites of each one.\n\nThen, we had the tuna tartare as an appetizer, which they prepared at the table. It involved a quail yolk, mint, and pine nuts, and they finished it with some sesame oil. It was served with toast that was a bit too much like white bread for my taste, so I ended up eating the last of the tartare by itself. Still amazing.\n\nThen, the entr\u00e9e. I had the hay-smoked ribeye, which was served with Yukon gold potato gnocchi, roasted vegetables, and a truffle pur\u00e9e. It was beautifully prepared and presented, although the steak was almost on the verge of being too medium. Almost. However, the smoke added an incredibly unique flavor.

It has been on my list for the longest time but I heard too many critics about their dinner that made me hesitate to go.  Didn't know they serve lunch until recently so lunch will be a good choice to give MM a try.\n\nOrdered the $55 \"chef's on a whim\" 4-course lunch so I could try out a variety of dishes from the chef and decide if I should return for dinner.  \n\nAmuse: hamachi sashimi\nAppetizer: tuna tartare\nEntree 1: salmon with foie\nEntree 2: steak\nDessert: hazelnut mousse\nBirthday dessert: caramel top hazelnut mousse (?)\n\nOverall everything was excellent and deliciousness.  It's a little heavy on the seafood side so I was pleased to see they threw in a small piece of foie to complement the salmon.  Though I wasn't sure if the foie is grade A quality because the texture is on the firmer side and not as silky and melt in your mouth quality I had so many times in the past.\n\nForgot to mention, normally a restaurant will give the birthday star his/her birthday dessert the same as everyone else at the table with an extra candle, but here at MM, not only they presented me my own birthday dessert with candle, I also had a second dessert same as everyone else at the table.  That's a very very nice touch.  It didn't cost much but surely won a customer's heart wanted to return.  \n\nSolid four stars and I will return and try out their dinner sometime.", "author": "Shirley H."}

I am only rating the food here, because the service was wonderful. The first course was portage of uni. I love this dish and it was probably my favorite out of the whole menu. It was light, tasteful and had uni at the bottom. My friends got the Dungeness crab chwanmushi, which was good but the flavors were very similar to a lot of Asian dishes I've had at other restaurants. For course two, I ordered the blue fin supplement. It was also just okay, but the scallops won the show for this course. The scallops were all beautifully done, cooked perfectly and well balanced. Third course was English pea tortellini, which I didn't care for. Forth course was game hen and foie gras. The game hen was not the most juicy or tender I've had. The foie gras was almost hidden, because the portion was so small. The dinner ended on a good note though, because the banana tarte tatin was to die for!

From the moment we walked through the door, we were impressed by the classy but not stuffy dining room decor and the professional and attentive staff.  We sat at the bar and our bartender, Meg, walked us through what each course would be and the wine pairing. Each course was delivered in a beautiful presentation and explained by a knowledgeable wait staff member. We were told that Michael Mina himself is engaged in finding the best local and global foods and wines to serve. We had a mozzarella cheese from Italy and a sesame, rye, sourdough bread from Oakland, CA as part of two of the courses that validated that point.  It was fun to watch Meg and Monica make drinks behind the bar as we ate our multi course dinner. They are both artists with an attention to adding the perfect garnish to a drink that calls for one.  Two delightful professionals at what they do.  My back had been to the dining room. At one point when I turned around, I was surprised that the dining room was completely full because it wasn't loud like many restaurants get when full of people. It could not have been a better anniversary dinner.\nThanks Michael Mina for giving us a 5-star dining experience.", "author": "Kristin A."}

We got there early and we sat at the bar and had cocktails and wine, very nice hostess checked us in and bar tenders were cool. We talked about Aqua and Michael Mina and the locations etc..... it was nice\n\nWe went to the dining table and were greeted by the Sommelier and he was a nice guy and recommended a new wine for us to try. We decided to it was good. Don't remember the name due to the following events that occurred. \n\nWe were enjoying the 120$ bottle of wine and my mother was enjoying her 30$ glass. Talking of times past and good times had in San Francisco. All of a sudden I looked over and the woman next to my brother had vomited all over herself and the table. The people with her I think were her family,  they were slow to react and finally tossed some napkins her way. They did not actually get up to help her in any way. After a few minutes they decided to get up and help her and said their apologies to us and we said it's ok. ( we are from Texas and are pretty friendly people)  after about 10 minutes the 2 men at the table got up after finishing their coffee and found out that the woman may have had an incident in the restroom and was possibly taken away by EMS. Offering one last apology to us.....\n\n...... but in the mean time the vomit was still on the table and about 12 napkins that were tossed at the elderly lady were still there covered in vomit   \nAfter dry heaving for 4 minutes I decided to get up and see if I could find some help so that the entire meal was not ruined by looking at vomit napkins and a solid bench seat.  I found the Sommelier who had sold us the wine and gave him a quick update on the events of the last 20 minutes and I asked if I could talk to a manager and he said \" oh I thought that pile was what you just told me it was\". Finally a general manager came over offered some what of an apology. Still no clean up of the table , 10 minutes later still no clean up.  That same manager ( shaved head and black rimmed glasses) came back by and said he had to by protocol then the table would be cleaned up. Still vomit and soiled bench 20\" away from us.  They came and cleaned the table offered us to move tables and we moved. A nice waitress came up to our partially set table and wanted to take our order, well guess what we had not seen a menu yet, so they decided to bring us a menu. Know that we have had a nice bottle of wine and several beverages before and planned on having a nice dinner there.  So we ordered our meal. The rude manager came by and assured us of doing anything that he could do to make us happy.  He completely ignored us and the next time I spoke to him ( not yelling, stern and serious voice) he said \" I don't want to be yelled at it's Christmas Eve\". No kidding we were at a restaurant to celebrate it. The food was 125$ per person for. 3 course tasting. We got to the middle of the second course and all wanted some wine. I saw the same wine guy. And asked him for some wine. He said \" I don't want to be yelled at it's Christmas Eve\". Obviously he and the GM had spoken and had a plan. And their plan was to ruin our Christmas Eve and they sure did. I asked for the check and they brought it to us. The waitress had no idea how ugly and rude her co workers were. Yes the did comp part of the meal. We paid and left a tip for the server.  \n\nMy point if this was my scenario. I would have bought us a bottle of wine( the table whose guest vomited and soiled the bench) . As a GENERAL MANAGER. I would have had a team of people cleaning up the mess or at least covering it up with extra table cloths, offered to move us to a new table immediately and been nice to the guest that did not make a big deal about sitting next to vomit for 30 minutes un attended.  All in all it was very very disappointing and I have been there 3 times. A few years ago and last was my second and my last time.  \n\nFood and drinks were good, the amuse bouche was great. We only had several bites of the other course before was were treated like crap. And yes the comped part of the meal, but were extremely rude. \n\nWe travel and eat out often bi weekly. All I can say is I am glad the rest of my family was not with us as if would have caused and chain reaction similar to the scene of the movie Stand By Me, after the blueberry pie eating contest. \n\nTrust me just don't go there!!!!

We came out bc we had a list of restaurants we wanted to try. \n\nWhen we arrived we were seated at the bar for a moment. The hostess was really nice. They gave us a beautiful table near the window. \n\nBar: We started out with 2 non alcoholic drinks. I had a passiona passion fruit mint drink which was ok. He had a blood orange spritzer which was good. The bar tender made him repeat his order 3 times almost saying men don't order spritzers. It was odd. \n\nWe were seated and they sent out a chefs appetizer. It wasn't anything special. A cold cucumber soup, a pate and a octopus on bread. Not very flavorful. \n\nThey sent out a seeded rye bread with a cheese spread with honey that was delicious. But of course we didn't come for bread. Although it was the best thing. \n\nWe ordered the pre fix 3 course dinner.\n\nCourse one: I had the sashimi which was very fresh, I enjoyed the fresh wasabi and aged soy sauce my favorite part of the meal. He had the crab raviolo which neither of us liked too much mushroom, too much butter, too much black truffle. Too heavy. The waiter told him not to get it. We should have listened. \n\nCourse two: we both had the lobster pot pie. It was just whatever. The lobster seemed over cooked, the morels over took the meal, and the veggies were minimal. I had 2 pieces of asparagus. All potatoes and so many mushrooms. I love mushrooms but in this it should be a highlight not a overwhelm...okur. I wasn't a fan. \n\nCourse three: dessert not great. One was grapefruit w pears roasted and sorbet and tapioca or something. Weird. A beignet w caramel inside. Not yum. I can't believe that's his signature. And another sorbet on a cake w creme fresh. The creme fresh tasted like cream cheese. \n\nThe service was ok. He was nice but I don't know odd. \n\nOverall very meh. A lot of hype. Maybe now his name has become famous he is slipping. Not personally watching over the many locations and it becomes a name not a true artist behind it all. \n\nI felt like it was a waste of money and we came out to stay in the city so overall disappointment.\n\nWe enjoyed each other's company and making fun of the guy next to us who was on a date with his mistress who wanted him to leave his wife.

My hubby had the soft shell crab and while not as stunning, it was still a delicious dish. The entree star was the Lobster Pot Pie. Do not miss this dish. It is fun and savory and filled with goodness in every bite. We finished with the chocolate dessert and it was also incredible.

Not too seafood based, and not too expensive. \n\nAmuse Bouche:\nFried tofu, lobster bisque foam, sashimi - all three of the amuse bouche was delicious. They were a great starter and definitely was the style of the Michael Mina - Asian fusion. \n\nThe Four Course Meal: \nTuna Tartare - probably one of the best I've had. It was slightly spicey from the ancho chiles, but the sesame oil was strong and delicious. They mix it at your table and really enjoyable. \nQuail with foie gras - Since the foie gras ban has recently been lifted in California, I've tried to have as much foie as possible. The foie was nicely seared and the quail was delicious as well. Very good pairing of the two. \nDuck Breast - many of my coworkers got the rib eye, but I decided to go with the duck breast, nicely cooked, but I wish the skin was rendered just a bit more and a little crispier. \nDark Chocolate Juniper - I was worried that the juniper would be overwhelming, but it was just a slight taste on the tongue. The grapefruit was a great counterpart to chocolate. \n\nOverall, great service, great meal.

For that amount of money one expects to be treated well and made to feel the establishment is glad we came. Apparently that is not the case.", "author": "Jewel S."}

We treated ourselves to birthday dinner here and had quite a nice dining experience. Everything is set for you to have an amazing meal. We each ordered different dishes from the 3 course menu. That way we could try each others selections. I can't describe the food because it's so delicate and I don't have any idea how the combinations were made. That's what I enjoyed most about Michael Mina - that I don't know how they do what they do. You go there expecting to have a dining experience that you can't recreate at home. And you can't! we left more than satisfied. I probably won't be back any time soon, though. It was a very expensive experience!", "author": "Cara D."}

We rented out the whole restaurant and I will be finding every reason to come back for any meal. \n\nWhat impressed me the most here was the SERVICE. You expect good service when you go to a nicer restaurant but EVERY SINGLE PERSON on the staff was 5-star A-game and more. They're very friendly and they basically know what you want before you do. Hats off to you guys! Everyone at my company could not stop talking about the great service. \n\nWe had a limited option of menu but everything we ate was superb! \n\nMushroom soup and grilled cheese: I originally ordered this to carb load for our company party that followed the meal but I was pleasantly surprised to see that the soup was packed with flavor. It came with cute triangles of grilled cheese that were perfect for dipping in the soup. They were small and I wish I had more but it was still so good!\n\nTuna tartare: Good but not great. The most average item I had. It was a little heavy on the sesame oil for my personal liking but it was still good! \n\nRib eye: the meat was cooked to tender perfection. It had a mushroom pur\u00e9e that was plate licking good! I could probably shovel buckets of it into my mouth. The vegetables were even packed with flavor. I couldn't get enough of it. \n\nChocolate dessert with caramel: bougie little dessert. Circles of caramel and chocolate that weren't overly too sweet but also topped you off nicely at the end of the meal. \n\nOverall, everyone had a great time there and no one could complain about anything! Service, on point. Food, on point. Venue, on point. Thank you Michael Mina! I will definitely be back!", "author": "Anna C."}

On his review of Michael Mina he stated that one of the specialties was Wagyu with foie gras. I thought to myself they still serve foie gras despite the ban? This was interesting I thought. I came here to eat here ten days ago with the hopes of ordering the Wagyu with foie gras. When I got there I asked the waiter if foie gras is served and he stated it wasn't served anymore because of the ban. I should have called first before I made a reservation through Open Table to confirm if foie gras is served. \n\nI was sort of stuck in a dilemma. I had already knew before my reservation that I was going to order two items only as I had to go somewhere that evening. I just wished that one of the items was with foie gras. So I reverted back to the Michael Bauer's Top 100 and he recommended the tuna tartare and the lobster pot pie. \n\nThe service in fact was impeccable. There was like 5 servers at my table. They really treat you well here. Some people might decide to try the tasting menu however I would recommend that ordering two items are enough. First there are series of free courses that are provided (I had 3 free courses sent to me). Second is the bread. I'm a sucker for hot bread and this place serves it. It's an individual slice of grill sourdough with a honey, cheese spread. I kept of asking for more bread. I had to say to myself enough with the bread.\n\nHere is my take on the two courses. The first course was a tuna tartare, which is marinated in habanero oil and served with homemade panini. I've had steak tartare before so the texture is similar. Unlike the steak tartare I love the chunky pieces of tuna. Even though the tartare was marinated in habanero oil it wasn't spicy but pleasurable. The second course had to be the lobster. Why? It might be the signature dish at this restaurant but the executive chef is Ron Siegel, the first American contestant to beat the Iron Chef. (The original Japanese version is much better than the American version). The secret ingredient of that episode was lobster. That's why I ordered the lobster pot pie. I am not a fan of deconstructed dishes, but this one I very much enjoyed. The crust is at the bottom and on top is 1 1/2 pound of Maine lobster. After this dish I was stuffed. No room for dessert.\n\nWhy not a 5-star rating? Overall it satisfying meal but since I didn't get any foie gras I was bummed. That's why I knocked them one star. Other than that I had a pretty good dinner.", "author": "Gerald R."}

The food on the other hand was inconsistent, and the service was far below par.\n\nIt took 50 minutes before any food was offered, which came in three tiny amuses.  Two of them were basically just sauces, and one was an empanada.  Bread was offered 10 minutes later.  It seems like they deliberately delayed our meal so they could serve the tasting menu to a table that came in 40 minutes after us, as they received all of the same food we did, though we signed up for the tasting menu within 15 minutes upon arrival.  By the end of the meal, the other table was getting served ahead of us.  \n\nThe drink service was very slow.  About 20 minutes to receive a cocktail, 15 minutes to get a glass of wine.  Our server was inattentive, and didn't seemed concerned with the fact that we kept saying we were hungry.\n\nThe scallop and agnolotti dishes were outstanding.  The A5 ribeye was good, but not as sumptuous as I would have hoped.  Every other dish, minus the empanada that was served as an amuse, was nothing short of mediocre.  \n\nThere's nothing about this food that I couldn't have prepared at home for a fraction of the cost, but the point was to spend the extra money and enjoy the experience without destroying my kitchen.  We had been in the restaurant for almost 3 hours, and took the dessert to go.  That dessert of chocolate and apple was so bland and boring, so we got some macaroons elsewhere that we enjoyed.  Michael Mina seems to stand behind using expensive indulgent ingredients, but far from does them justice.\n\nI don't think I would return here unless someone wanted to pay for it, because the food and service in no way stacked up for the prices they charge.", "author": "Nathan B."}

What an experience! Our night didn't start off too well as the weather bogged down our moods on a rainy friday night. The restaurant was kind enough to let us reschedule multiple times (thanks Opentable). We arrived a bit early for our reservation and opted to grab a few cocktails at the bar.\n\nUpon viewing the menu, I had a few choices in mind, but the bartender convinced me to be a little spontaneous and try one of his creations. It was a mash up of whiskey and pineapple. This is not a traditional combination, but the pineapple added a great flair to the smoky whiskey taste. We waited at the bar for a good 20 minutes past our reservation before I signaled my impatience to the bartender. \n\nWe did a four course tasting menu and started off with *drumroll* tuna tartare. Hands down, best tartare. The infused habanero oil was unexpected and added an unsual dimension. I'm not a fan of spicy things, but this was still palatable. \n\nThe highlight of my meal was the duck breast which was served as the main. The orange jus reduction was phenomenal. The serving was on the heavy side, so I didn't finish the entire plate.\n\nOn to dessert. The waiter suggested something light and airy and I was so happy I went with his suggestion. The cava was a nice refreshing choice.\n\nI would definitely recommend MM for any special occasion or if you are looking to impress that special someone.

MM certainly hits on all cylinders, food, presentation, service and atmosphere. it's SF so not really formal, but you'll feel more comfortable dressed up a little bit. \n\nwe had the 4-course tasting menu and I was a little concerned because some of the reviews hinted that the portions weren't big enough but I don't see how that could be. we were completely full after the first three and didn't even feel like we needed dessert.\n\nOur table was ready exactly on time. Valet parking is $10. there were a couple of four--tops set up for two people right at the front door and I was worried they would seat us there but we had a nice 4-person banquette set for two. the waiter came by and asked if we'd like a glass of champagne to start which I took to mean it was complementary so we said \"sure\" and he brought the wine list haha. no matter, it was still a good way to start. the amuse bouche was very nice, a snow pea with a little salt, a dollop of beef tartare and a salmon tartare rolled in seaweed paper. basically a nice-sized starter.\n\nthe sourdough bread was good and it comes with mascarpone cheese with honey on top. da bomb. we each ate two pieces\n\nfor the first course we had tuna tartare (the only dish that is always on the menu, since 1991, per the waiter) which was excellent. it had a nice nutty flavor which was interesting and unique. I could eat that all day. a very generous portion too. we also had the abalone which was delicious. \n\nfor the second course we had lobster ravioli with a pea puree and Crispy Suckling Pig. I was a little confused by the description and still wasn't sure what it would be after asking the waiter. apparently they chop up a small pig and you end up with something, but it's not clear beforehand what you get (??) anyway that's how it seemed to me, but it didn't matter because there was a nice large piece of pork, served with grilled brussels sprouts and root vegetables. \n\nthird course was kind of heavy with the rib eye and duck breast. both were fantastic, but we were already getting full by this time. next time I'd do more fish. the rib eye was perfectly cooked at medium rare and the plate was set up perfectly for sharing (two pieces of everything). \n\ndesserts were a little disappointing, at least for our palates. the chocolate crusted with pistachio was good, but the lemon sorbet that came with it was just a tad too tangy. the buttermilk parfait was better. they brought a couple of macaroons and soft caramels after dessert. \n\nevery one of the staff was very helpful. pleasant and actually made you feel like they're happy to be of service. \n\neven though the desserts weren't exactly to our liking, it's still a 5-star review.

When we arrived, hostess was too casual, didn't feel extra welcoming.  A large party was hanging around at the bar and near the entrance.  We literally had to squeeze ourselves to enter the restaurant because of this group.  Hostess did not acknowledge nor observed the situation to make appropriate apologies on that behalf.  I think this falls back on restaurant management as the staffs should be trained on how to handle loud groups like this at a fine dining.  And how hostess should be more observant of customers behavior to make appropriate comments or gestures.  People often compare this place with Gary Danko, by far I think Gary Danko is way way way better in service, food, atmosphere and value!  The service here was courteous, but lack of sincerity. I mean you can feel it!  They are only doing it as a job!  Sorry, but when people come for fine dining, personal attention is extremely important!!!  Treating your customers like another number is the last thing you want at a fine restaurant like this.  Food was just an average of 3 or 4 stars quality.

The main course consisted of raw tiny slices of broccoli, some fried rice cracker, and some vegetables.  It was tiny, even smaller than my salad.  Not only was I still hungry after eating it, but it was neither that good nor creative.  The fried rice cracker tasted greasy, the raw broccoli was not flavorful, and the rest of the dish just didn't pull together.  Not beautifully presented like the other courses either.

And given the amount they are charging per person ($120 for three courses not including tips/tax/etc.).  They either need to work on their ability to put together courses on request (which they seemed to be able to do for other dietary restrictions based on what the waitperson was telling our table), or if their chefs rely on more regimented menus, they need to put together something more exciting than a lettuce salad and thrown together vegetables.

My friends made a 6 pm reservation on a recent Friday evening, perfect timing parking-wise for me as I scored a space one block away.  The dining room was sparsely filled, but, by 7 pm, the crowd started flowing in.  Here's what we had:\n\nAmuse Bouche\n1) Corn soup with grilled cheese sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=k-XTVfncBIvsMd5KwGfm8w&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Fine dining and comfort food mix as the flavors offered a sharp contrast from the corn's sweetness to the richness of the cheese.\n\nAppetizers (shared)\n2) Tuna tartare (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=JAE16BM_QxUGc5VKLe6-Ng&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Definitely more attractive prior to serving, but the flavors were good.\n\n3) Seared scallops (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lCzcXGIVbD2RBBiTc1zfVw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Better than what I remembered last time my scallop was perfectly seared.\n\n4) Corn Gnudi (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=di0ethMJxWx9l2qWLFg2ag&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Probably my least favorite of the apps as the corn soup has stronger flavors.\n\n5) Wagyu Beef Shabu (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wA3PURfnTw2JI5gzD5iZEw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - More show than substance as the flavors were just okay, but the presentation offers an interesting twist. \n\nEntree\n5) Liberty Duck Breast with shumai dumpling soup (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-z2UokuR0LNSYjgWJrTI5A&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Forgoing the lobster pie, I was extremely happy with my medium rare breast slices.  As a soup fan, the shumai dumpling was hearty and the broth was very refreshing (\"qing\" in Chinese vernacular).\n\nDessert \n6) Chocolate mousse cake (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Being full from the rest of the meal, the restaurant generously gave us a complimentary birthday dessert to test our candle blowing skills.  Nice touch, guys.\n\nThe portions were generous and the bread with their condiments (butter, honey mixture) are simply addictive.  A neighboring table ordered the \"Gamut\" which basically offers the entire menu in a thirteen or so courses (limited offering per evening and pre-ordering is highly recommended).  There was also a tempting tasting menu, but we opted to choose our personal favorites instead.  The service was good as drink glasses and bread plates refilled.  Coming from work, we were business casually dressed, but many guests were fashionably clothed and some even dressed to the nines.  \nWith the recent news of the incoming renown Ron Siegal of Charles Nob Hill, Masa's, and Ritz Carlton SF fame (not to mention Mr. Iron Chef Lobster), I will come back to find out how they improve on this pretty impressive meal.", "author": "Mike C."}

I was so glad to be warmly welcomed by impeccable service and remarkable food.\n\nI believe I was slightly underdressed in my short sleeved blouse and black slacks with leather jacket, but we were treated as VIP guests regardless. \n\nAt first we were seated at a large table under a bright light, but the staff graciously helped us to move to the more intimate dimmer corner table after the guests were done. We ordered the 4 course, with a pairing for my husband who could not pass up on a sommelier's selection, even though we had just spent the day with a hired driver visiting 7 wineries.\n\nLet's start here: every bite and sip they served was delicious and worthy of the Michelin star they earned.\n\nIf I must comment, I would say that the generous plate of 3 amuse bouches was a bit more than we needed. I strongly urge to select the bluefin tuna appetizer, because not only was it beautifully presented but every component of that dish was placed to glorify the sensational fish. I would have savored a whole other portion if given the choice.  The lobster dish is also a must.  Let's put it this way, our favorite lobster dish is the poached egg and lobster with hen of the woods dish by Chef Wolfgang Ban in NYC at the now closed 1 Michelin starred Seasonal, when I asked my husband which lobster dish he liked more, he asked me not to make him choose.  \n\nChef Mina, please open a restaurant in New York City! I would bring so many friends and family to dine with you! My favorite fine-dining restaurant Seasonal has closed and I grieve for the loss a restaurant where every guest is treated well, the sommelier provides excellent pairings, and I can get a reservation without pomp and circumstance. Another Michael Mina location could satisfy this void for me and my husband!  In the meanwhile, I will try to bring my mother in law and friends to the locations in the DC area.

After $400, I left disappointed; partly because I had to foot the entire bill, I expected a lot more. (http://www.yelp.com/biz/michael-mina-san-francisco#hrid:EjbW4vcJC29oPLFLVtBlpg). Several years later, I decided to give Michael Mina another chance and dined at Bourbon Steak (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bourbon-steak-san-francisco#hrid:6sCfcVx_1JcYbS7fXpsa5w). It was total redemption so I was excited to try RN 74 only to be disappointed yet again (http://www.yelp.com/biz/rn74-san-francisco#hrid:cQJ-giazaaCcmEg5Tn4c2w). With the Foie Gras Ban looming (7.1.12), I wanted to give Michael Mina another chance hoping that they've changed as they did away with their old trio concept and were in a new location (formerly Aqua). \n\nAfter our dinner last night, it completely baffles me how they continue to hold one Michelin star (lost one of its two stars in 2010). All our dishes were a hit or miss; some with misleading names. Presentation was sloppy with some dishes looking like what one would, doing the walk of shame. A HOT MESS. The service was painstakingly slow and the ambiance was unbearably loud. \n\nF O O D\n*JORDON ALMOND CRUSTED FOIE GRAS w/ Peppercress, Orange Marmalade & Brioche ($28) - 3.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5I3fM8fRdkJdKL-_BJ1qvw?select=x7x0LxSb2tPEjkbUFMeALg#c5ZVk6EdYu21QAG6dDxHVw\nA split order with my friend, the seared foie gras was luxuriously rich and was almost on par with the ones from La Folie and Alexander's Steakhouse (my favs), however, it was not crusted with Jordon Almonds as stated on the menu (it was sprinkled on the side). Presentation was sloppy as the juices from the foie ran all over the plate when it should have been wiped clean.\n\n*WAGYU SHABU SHABU w/ Foie Gras & Dashi Broth ($21) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5I3fM8fRdkJdKL-_BJ1qvw?select=x7x0LxSb2tPEjkbUFMeALg#arT1i5hmBKzx-NwuiJA2yA\nThe BEST part of our dinner, the dashi broth had tons of mouth-watering umami flavors with both the wagyu and foie melting effortlessly on my palette. \n\n*MICHAEL'S MAC & CHEESE w/ Foie Gras Mousse, Duck Confit & Walnut Gremolata ($22) - 2 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5I3fM8fRdkJdKL-_BJ1qvw?select=b-mEd4nDx0sXT-SlkwalOA#2UyO3g3gys8es-6S3Tj1fA\nOne of the most horribly presented dishes I've ever seen leave the kitchen of a Michelin starred restaurant, the \"Mac & Cheese\" was actually stuffed pasta. One of my foodie dates, Susy C. thought it looked like a flaccid whiskey dick from a bad one-night stand. I totally agree. I would NEVER hit that again. The richness from the foie mousse, duck confit, and cheese just didn't work together and left an odd salty livery and game taste in my mouth. \n\n*NY STRIP FOIE GRAS ROSSINI w/ Brown Butter Spinach, Focaccia & Perigourdine Sauce ($54) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5I3fM8fRdkJdKL-_BJ1qvw?select=b-mEd4nDx0sXT-SlkwalOA#b-mEd4nDx0sXT-SlkwalOA\nThough perfectly cooked to a rare, the overly salty NY Strip was a bit chewy and fibrous. The perfectly seared foie gras that melted on my tongue like a triple cream butter was what saved this dish. \n\n*CARAMEL FOIE GRAS ICE CREAM w/ Roasted Apricots, Vanilla Brioche & Honey Gelee ($12) - 2.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/5I3fM8fRdkJdKL-_BJ1qvw?select=roNzQP7xB_XWdd7gJt1rtQ#roNzQP7xB_XWdd7gJt1rtQ\nAn uncohesive dessert, the foie gras ice cream has a nice subtle rich livery essence, however, the apricots and honey gelee just overpowered everything. \n\nS E R V I C E\nProblematic both in front and back of the house, service was not what you would expect from such a prestigious restaurant. They were overstaffed yet service was ridiculously SLOW. Our 4 course meal took longer than my 9 course meal at French Laundry (nearly 4 hours). We had to wait a painstakingly 30 minutes between each course. And, while we waited 25 minutes for the dessert menu, our waiter passed our table three times to talk to the table next to us. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nContemporary and sleek with a lot of neutral tan and brown furnishings and huge ceiling-to-floor windows and mirrors with large potted plants and abstract art. Not a good date place as it was unbearably loud throughout the restaurant to the point it made my head throb. Umm what's up with the Velcro slip covers for the chairs? Tacky.  \n\nP A R K I N G\nEasy street parking before 6 PM. Valet parking is $10. \n\nIn the end, after giving someone so many chances, sometimes you just have to tell yourself that you deserve better, wipe off your tears, and walk away...\n\nFarewell, Michael Mina.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

We normally wouldn't have ever thought of going for 2 reasons. 1. We do like to dine well, but usually aren't in the habit of spending more than a couple hundred on a nice dinner.. and 2. We thought and heard that it could sometimes be a stiff/stuffy crowd of diners.   \nI was given a $300 gift card from a boss for Xmas so we were excited to go.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised and had a memorable experience. We went to dinner on a Saturday evening at 7:30pm. We were a bit nervous like..what do we wear?? We know it's SF and nowhere is super dress code, but yes let's of course dress up a bit. We found a mix of \"smart casual\" and some more dressy, as well as a few on the more casual side. \n\nThe atmosphere: Warm and welcoming upon arrival. Sat right away even though we were ten minutes early. The entire staff is very attentive. Drinks offered, and questions answered right away. Everything moved in a very smooth time, and basically at our pace (ie: no feeling of rushed to order anything)  \n\nThe service: As mentioned above, the whole team is looking after you. Nothing goes missed whether it's water or a beverage - you may have just ordered from your server, and still very lightly someone will drop by and just make sure you are being taken care of. Things came out swiftly and the whole process of ordering for us newbies was explained and questions were answered easily. \nBack to the part where we thought it may be stuffy/stiff. Well we didn't pay much to the diners around us - no need to. We really felt in our own world even though there were many people around us. Sam was our server and he was great. Sophisticated but not stuffy. Very friendly and helpful and shared some laughs with us. Bryan, who I later found out was the captain, was making his rounds throughout the night and we chatted him a bit when he checked on us. He was so warm and funny! When I told him our secret concern about it being stuffy and how happily wrong we were he smiled and said I will show you how \"stuffy we are.\" He ended up bringing us a round of dessert drinks as that was the only course we had not ordered any beverage for (we did off menu drinks not the pairing). We shared a bunch of laughs with him and when we were leaving he saw and dropped by the front to give us his card and very warmly thank us and tell us to please come by for a drink or dinner again soon. \n\nIt was a really great night! \n\nThe food (what everyone wants to know about!) \n\nExceptional. Unique, beautiful, exciting, and actually much larger portions than I was expecting. I've posted pics of everything except for the cheese plate which I was pretty buzzed and forgot to photograph (it was pretty standard too - and delicious of course). \n\nWe will hopefully go back one day!", "author": "Rebecca L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-07-03", "description": "This was my first encounter with Mr. Mina and I'm left semi dissatisfied.\n\nUpon walking in, I noted the high ceilings and noise volume. Whatevz, it's FiDi. \nWe actually arrived a little earlier than my reservation but we were still able to be seated and had some wine. It continued to get louder. I thought I would stop caring after having some wine and bread but my friends seemed to note this throughout the night. \n\nWent with 2 appetizers, a regular entree and 1 off the chef's tasting menu, 2 desserts from the regular menu and a final foie dessert off the farewell to foie chef's tasting menu.\n\nsquid ink conchiglie w/ bacon lardon, uni emulsion, monterey bay shellfish was worth the $22. a hearty serving of the conchiglie, super fresh since it totally tasted like the sea, and oh em gee the shellfish! crab meat, clams, mussels, oh my! the uni emulsion was more like a foam to me but the uni on top was the perfect topping. \n\nsnake river farms wagyu shabu shabu $21 is another appetizer worth ordering. this can definitely be shared with another person. it had a small salad with thinly sliced radishes, a cube of foie resting on top of pickled radish, and wagyu wrapped enokis. to accompany it, they gave us 2 dipping sauces of ponzu and miso. the dashi broth with mushrooms and bonito flakes was just amazing. they bring it out to you and light it up. just seconds of swishing around and it's ready. the foie was especially good in this manner. definitely brought out the butteriness and didn't need any sauce. afterwards, the broth is taken away and strained only to be brought back to you in a tea cup for you to drink! what a delightful and comforting little \"tea\" I was ready to take a nap after this. \n\nOff the chef's farewell to foie tasting menu I ordered \"Michael's Mac n Cheese\" which consisted of foie gras mousse and duck confit. This was the biggest $22 disappointment of my life. This \"mac n cheese\" was akin to getting into a hot lusty one night stand gettin' down to your skivvies only to find he has an eeny weeny little flacid one and you're like, \"wtf am I supposed to do with that?\" Honestly, the plating on this dish fell short. EXTREMELY SHORT.  It looked like a plate of bleeding peens. Sorry for the graphic image but yes, I'm calling it like it is. It was a stuffed pasta dish, not mac n cheese at all. When our server brought it out, I did a triple take and almost told him we didn't order this. Flavor wise, this dish also fell short.  Barely tasted the duck confit and the foie mousse was lost amongst the \"cheese\" and just had a bitter taste.\n\nFor my entree I had the Liberty Farms duck breast with seared foie gras, miso-pear puree, duck shu mai and dashi broth. ($39) Worth every last penny for this dish. The duck breast was done so perfectly medium rare with a crunchy skin that reminded me of Chinese roasted pork with crispy skin. The dashi broth was a tad salty and the duck shu mai had an awfully thick skin but the breast made up for it. The foie was excellent. \n\nFor dessert we went with the chocolate flour-less cake, a ricotta cheesecake w/ basil ice cream and strawberries, and then the foie gras ice cream off the chef's foie tasting menu.\n\nFirst, the ricotta cheesecake was not really cheesecake. It was deconstructed. Was a tad hard to eat, having to push the crust onto our spoons  then getting some \"cheesecake\" filling. The basil ice cream was a great palette cleanser. \n\nI'm not a huge fan of chocolate but the chocolate flour-less cake was a great play on the ever so popular Snickers bar. Loved all the crunchy little bits even though the presentation made it look like a plate of poop. (That was kind of disappointing)\n\nThe caramel foie gras ice cream w/ roasted apricots, vanilla brioche and honey gelee was the 2nd biggest disappointment. I've had foie ice cream before but Mina's was executed poorly. The foie taste was strong but the sense of \"ice cream\" was lost as it was not sweet at all. Way too salty. \n\nOn top of the 2 disappointing foie gras dishes off the chef's tasting menu... We were told that if only one of us ordered the chef's tasting menu while the rest of us went with the regular menu, timing would be an issue. Since we were told that, we went with the regular menu ordering as we pleased and guess what? Timing was STILL an issue. My 9 course meal at The French Laundry didn't take as long as my experience at Michael Mina. I was here for nearly 4 hours, seriously what gives? I don't get it. It took about half an hour before even getting the dessert menu. I don't understand! There wasn't a shortage of servers since I saw plenty going around. This was so off putting to my experience. I may still give Mina a second chance in Vegas but I think I'm done with this FiDi location", "author": "Susy C."}

I made reservations a week in advance, and they had plenty of openings.  I decided that 7 pm would be an ideal time slot so I selected that.  On the day of the reservations, my plans did not go as I anticipated.  I called them at 6 pm, and asked if I could reschedule to 8pm.  They were very nice about it, and changed my reservation time without any hesitation at all!  \n\nWhen the GF and I arrived, we were seated immediately.  The ambiance was great; the dim lighting created a romantic mood.  Noise level was on the lighter side, so one could definitely have a conversation without screaming over the other.  The spacing of tables was just right.  No one would be able to eavesdrop or be nosy neighbors.  \n\nWe decided to order the lobster risotto and shabu shabu as appetizers.  The risotto was excellent.  It was rich, creamy, and very well seasoned.  They had already split the risotto into two plates before bringing it out because they knew we were sharing.  That was mighty thoughtful of them.  The shabu shabu consisted of four pieces of beef.  The server cooked them table side using the pot with broth which he brought to the table.  The beef was tender, and the GF really loved it.  It was her favorite part of the meal.  \n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the lobster pot pie, while she had the filet mignon.  By the time the entrees came out, we already had four slices of bread each. We were both pretty full.  The pot pie was deconstructed, and consisted of lobster, pesto filled ravioli, vegetables, tomatoes, and of course a thin layer of pot pie crust.  It was definitely the most unique thing I have ever eaten at a fine dining restaurant.  I loved the sauce that went with the lobster.  I wish they had given more ravioli.  The pie was a tad dry for my liking.

When I made the reservation I mentioned it was a birthday dinner to see what would they have as birthday treat.\n\nWhen we checked in, we were greeted by the hostess and she wished my boyfriend a happy birthday  that was very nice of her. But there were no other celebration from our waiter throughout the entire evening. Then I saw a reserved empty table next to us with a Happy Birthday envelope waiting for their arrival. I wanted to ask but since my boyfriend actually didn't want any birthday celebration from the restaurant I didn't ask. But I m curious about that still. \n\nAside from that, the food were fantastic. We both ordered the 3 course meal. First we started off with Tofu an extra from the restaurant. You can totally taste how it is freshly made. It was not out of the box tofu and added seasoning. Then follow with our appetizer that we ordered. We ordered the Sashimi and the Foie Gras. I had the Foie Gras, it was super rich. I love the dish but I was a little Foie Gras out after I had the dish. I love the taste of all 3 different Foie gras in the dish. The Sashimi looked really good too, I didn't get to try any of it cause I was trying to finish my dish and didn't want to ruin my appetite. \n\nOur main dish came next. I had the Lobster with truffle and my boyfriend had the duck. I didn't get to try any of my boyfriends dish but according to him he said it was pretty good. When my lobster came, it was in a copper pot of course, hence the name Lobster Pot Pie right? The server assembled my lobster pieces back to the lobster shape on my plate. The crust for the pot pie was so fluffy and perfectly cooked. It was very buttery too. Its like those thousand layer crusts. I was kind of having a little difficulty trying to eat the lobster cause i didn't want to be using my hand at a fancy restaurant. The sauce was really good. I wish I was not getting full from my previous foie gras dish. I had to leave 1/6 of my dish to waste but I finished all the lobster leaving some of the vegetable and the crust. \n\nDessert was a blur to me but I remember there was a sorbet that I really like.

They offered us complimentary champagne while we waited which was nice, but I'd prefer to be seated on time.  \n\nThey offer a preset 3-course meal for $105/per or a 10-course meal for $170/per; I was expecting a 4-course meal after reading the reviews.  Found out that the 4-course meal is if we included caviar to our meal for an additional cost.  The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about each course they brought out.  They also brought us a complimentary prawn tempora to try prior to our meal.  Always sweetens the experience when they deliver more than you expect!  I ordered the sashimi tasting, ranch rib eye, and cheese.  Sashimi was good, but only 6 pieces (which i split w the gf so definitely not enough for my appetite).

The toro with caviar and yuzu was the highlight of the meal and amazing.  How could it not be?  The cote de beouf was underwhelming but still quite good.  Overall, the food and the service from our waiter was outstanding and perfect for the occasion, celebrating our marriage.\n\nThe issue came at the end.  Our waiter dropped off the check and we noticed that we had both been charged for the Chef Select Tasting menu.  There was also an extra charge for the toro w/caviar (This is not an issue. We ordered that course and it was delivered).  Oddly, my wife ordered the lobster pot pie and were not charged for that.  In any event, we were charged for the select tasting menu.  We did not order the select tasting menu. The dishes we were served were exactly what we had ordered from the seasonal 5 course menu.\n\nI informed the manager of the mistake. He apologized and said he would fix it. He returned 10 minutes later and said, sorry, there was no mistake. The bill is correct.  Whatever.  We called our waiter over and explained the mistake. He immediately apologized and then returned with the correct bill. Problem solved.\n\nOr not. The manager returned my credit card and the receipt for signature. He informed us that he is going to do us a favor and charge us for what we think we ordered.  However, he was quite adamant that we in fact had the Chef Select Tasting.  Since he is giving us such a great deal, would we please make sure to say nice things on social media.\n\nThe manager's attitude left us with a very poor aftertaste.  He never took the time to ask us what we ordered.  He simply informed us, incorrectly, of what we had been served and implied that we were somehow trying to scam the restaurant out of a more expensive meal.  \n\nNow at most other restaurants this might not be such a big deal.  But at an establishment like Michael Mina there is a higher expectation.  In our case, that expectation was not met.\n\n***UPDATE*** - Giovanni, the GM, personally called me to apologize for our experience.  He took the time to find out exactly what happened and agreed that he holds himself and his staff to a higher standard.  The fact that he went out of his way to address our experience is meaningful to us.  I thank him for that.", "author": "Bearcat B."}

We typically have a tasting menu meal at a Michelin star restaurant about once a month and Michael Mina was the least satisfying meal that we've had in quite sometime.\n\nThe Ketto menu itself was good and the wine pairings were also unique and well paired.  Some other diners might take issue that nearly all of the wines were European whites but I personally liked the pairings immensely.\n\nI understand the need to maximize the usage of fresh produce but it seems like figs, tomatoes and mushrooms had been bought in bulk.  It felt like many of the courses were redundant due to the overuse of ingredients course after course.\n\nFor Bay Area locals in the know, I feel like there are at least 10 other tasting menus that beat Mina's Ketto for inventiveness and value.  My family recently dined at Campton Place and we all agreed that we would return to Campton before returning to Mina.  I could list the other 9 but I'll leave that to your imagination if you choose to pursue it.", "author": "Lance W."}

I have heard nothing but good things about Michael Mina and really wanted to try it. \n\nAppetizers we ordered were the Sashimi Platter with thinly slices of Toro. The Toro was very fresh and was melt in your mouth goodness. I love the presentation of the freshly grated wasabi at your table side. We also ordered the Hamachi as well which I felt was just ok. Hamachi was fresh and the presentation was beautiful however there wasn't a lot of flavor or taste to the dish. There was different sauces that were drawn onto the plate (for presentation) but I didn't feel like there was dimension to it. Last but not least we ordered the Suckling Pig appetizer which I felt was a little bit dry. This was the accompanied with many pieces of shaved black truffle. My favorite app was definitely the Toro.\n\nWhat I thought was interesting was the shabu shabu here. Definitely not your traditional shabu shabu and since we all know I'm just a fanatic for shabu I was a bit disappointed. The presentation of course was amazing with the synchronized table side presentation of the dish as the waitresses did the cooking for you. The meat was very soft and tender in a dashi broth with a variety of shaved vegetables. \n\nFor the entree course I ordered the Herb Roasted Lamb which was cooked to medium rare perfection. The pieces of lamb was cut generously and were very tender. This was a accompanied with olives, eggplant, and a variety of different vegetables.\n\nMy favorite items were probably the complimentary items. We started off with a small bite of grilled cheese with a corn soup and then later bread with a honey ricotta spread which I couldn't get enough of! It was delicious! \n\nI felt the service was incredible and love the car service they provide to take you to your next destination. The food I thought was not as good as I had imagined. I would be interested in coming back to try the \"ketto\" tasting menu next time!", "author": "Tracy N."}

We were maybe the second table to be seated. By the time we left, there were quite a few parties there, but also a handful of open tables. The decor is extremely modern and very beautiful.\n\nCHEF'S 'ON A WHIM' 4-COURSE TASTING MENU $55\n\nhamachi sashimi - [shaved radish, cherry, shiso salt] = 2/5\n..:: This dish was not very innovative, unique, or impressive. The cuts of yellow tail were decent at best. Not the best cuts I've had, but definitely not bad. The pairings with the shaved radish and cherry were just okay. Edible, but it doesn't stand out. I could get this at any nice japanese restaurant.\n\nahi tuna tartare - [habanero-infused sesame oil, pine nut, quail egg yolk] = 5/5\n..:: This dish is mixed in front of you. The quil egg yolk is stirred and then the pine nuts and spices are slowly mixed in. Then is it infused with the tuna. At first, the smell is much more poignant than the taste. Which is saying that it's bland; but it's not. The flavours come together very very nicely after the first bite. I would say, well done, but it's infact raw :P\n\nmaryland soft shell crab - [pesto, summer melon, cucumber, joseph's mix of local greens] = 4/5\n..:: The soft shell crab is completely edible, shell included. The crab was very tender, and you're getting a whole (little) crab. The little guy packs a lot of flavour, and is very juicy. I don't think the pesto, or other flavours were really needed, but the summer melon and cucumber provided a very nice refreshing cleanse after each bite.\n\npan-seared chicken breast - [sushi rice, charred scallion, cucumber, ginger] = 1/5\n..:: I saw this on the menu, and was really hoping it wouldn't come out. However it did. At a restaurant like Michael Mina, you'd expect chicken of all things, to be cooked perfectly. I actually sent this back. It came out extremely dry during the first round. I cut a bit from the middle and a little off each end to check it's consistency. At least it was consistently dry all the way through. I sent it back and the waiter apologized profusely. A new dish came out. I cut it through again, and this time it was much better. Kinda juicy, but not super juicy. If I had more time, I would have sent it back again, but I was on a \"business\" lunch. I don't understand what this is doing on the menu. The sushi rice is not special, and definitely not as good as actual sushi rice. This was more of a vinegar rice. It was edible. Again, this needs to be taken off the menu.\n\nchamomile - [honey, mint, strawberry] = 4.5/5\n..:: This concoction was very good. I'm not much of a dessert person but I enjoyed this dish. All the flavours went well together. Honey, mint, and strawberry all mixed in with cream? what's not to like!?\n\nSERVICE\nService was very good as expected from a restaurant from this caliber. We were checked on quite a bit, almost a bit too much though. Everybody was extremely friendly. One plate was almost cleared too early, but we mentioned we were not done with the plate, and he apologized and left it.\n\nOVERALL\nOverall, the food was hit or miss, but the service was great. The price point was fair if all the food lived up to the hype. I would recommend this restaurant, but you must be careful with what you order. I'm unsure if I would return to this restaurant.", "author": "Kaje Y."}

Nothing was mentioned to us nor arranged upon arrival. Our waiter doesn't know in advance that my wife is allergic to beef and shrimp when I also noted that on our reservation. He did indeed asked about any allergies that he should be aware of when he took our order, which was a relief. I just think that the hostess should pay more attention to the little details when there're notes on reservations.\n\nThe service and ambiance for this restaurant are at par level for a Michelin one star. There are enough staffs to cover each table, but just not enough details to service each customer's need. Ice water and hot water were not refilled at a timely manner. Bread was only offered once and was never offered any additional. Overall, service was acceptable since the wait staffs do check on each dish and deliver new utensils, as well as cleaning our table after each dish was set away.\n\nFood was not too impressive for this restaurant to hold a Michelin star. I've tried a few other Michelin one star restaurants that were able to deliver that WOW effect to me when each dish was presented on the table. The overall presentation and taste of each dish simply failed to excite our taste buds.\n\nOverall, I'm satisfy about my dining experience here, just not thrill enough to make me come back for a round 2 anytime soon.", "author": "king w."}

We were semi full from snacks but still wanted dinner. We didn't opt for the full tasting menu, but rather just got entrees. I got the salmon and husband got the lamb. The restaurant was quite empty for a weeknight but the waiter let us know that the food would take some time. They gave us a complimentary cold corn chowder and small cheese sandwich. The chowder was in a mini shot glass, so a couple sips, and the sandwich was about the size of a cracker. They were both delicious, but i would have preferred the chowder being warm. We were also served bread with a ricotta honey spread, and that was outright delicious. I didnt want to eat a lot of it to get full, but I couldn't stop myself. As a result I was pretty full around dinner, but it was well worth it.\n\nMy entree was salmon on a bed of eggplant, mushroom and small veggies. They also hand poured a fresh broth on top of the salmon. It was scrumptious. It made my salmon similar to a soup, but not quite. I'd love to get it again.

A bar lined one wall of the restaurant, and boy was it noisy!  I also thought the restaurant was kind of dark.  Service was good, and we enjoyed our dinner.  My friend and I had the 9-course tasting menu-duo.  Each of us was given a different dish for each course, so we could technically try twice as many items.\n\nThe sourdough bread came to the table toasted, brushed with olive oil, and served with a honey, black pepper, and mascarpone spread.  It was great when it first came out, but if it sat too long, the bread was hard.\n\nThe amuse and first two rounds of food were good, but easily forgettable.  \n\nOur third courses were the first worth mentioning here.  I really enjoyed the buttery, smooth fish from my \"black cod.\"  It was served on top of a bed of daikon noodles and radish.  The dashi broth tasted more like soy than dashi, but I loved the perfectly cooked fish.  My friend's \"pan-seared ocean trout\" with miner's lettuce, salsa verde, arugula, & torn bread croutons had a nice sear while still being rare in the middle.  The salsa verde was very tasty.\n\nMy friend's favorite dish of the night was her \"Maine diver scallop\" with red spring onion, baby fennel, & miso-tamarind broth.  The scallop was HUGE!  It was so sweet and tender.  I also thought it was excellent.  My \"butter-poached Main lobster\" with kale & pickled ginger was perfectly cooked, and I loved the lobster reduction.  This was an excellent round of seafood.\n\nOur pasta courses were enjoyable.  I had the \"squid ink conchiglie\" with melted leeks, clams, and CA sturgeon caviar.  It had a tiny kick.  Very flavorful.  The other pasta was a \"chestnut ravioli\" with perigord black truffle & prunes.  I thought it was okay, but my friend really enjoyed it.\n\nMy sixth dish was \"Tolenas Farms quail\" with quince paste, currant blossom, parsnip, & black truffle. The meat was overcooked and dry. My friend's \"Liberty Farms duck breast\" with rhubarb, mandarinquat, radish, & shiso was much more successful.\n\nWe both loved our last savory dishes.  My \"Japanese A5 Wagyu\" had a really vibrant broccoli puree, fork-crushed potato, & sansho pepper.  This was a winner.  My friend's \"Black Angus prime ribeye\" with caramelized sunchoke & a bacon-balsamic emulsion was also quite tasty.\n\nThere was some confusion about our desserts, and we ended up having a green tea ice cream & green tea sponge cake as a palate cleanser.  Then we had a citrus tart, a white chocolate tiramisu, and a deconstructed smores.\n\nThe food at Michael Mina was very good.  Some dishes definitely impressed us more than others.  Our service was fine, but not outstanding.  The darkness and distracting noise from the bar definitely affected our enjoyment of the whole evening.  I also slipped and fell on their hard cement floor, so icing my knee during dinner was not the greatest experience.", "author": "Lorianne L."}

I would've given five stars, but took away one star because the wait for the food was just way too long. \n\nTOASTED BREAD - Came with this honey ricotta spread, which was SUPER DELICIOUS!!! Very flavorful. If they sold it as a bottle, I'd definitely buy it to go.\n\nGRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH WITH BUTTERSQUASH SOUP (Amuse Bouche) - Wasn't too big fan of the buttersquash soup, unfortunately. The small bite size grilled cheese sandwich was tasty! \n\nSHABU-SHABU - Consisted of four pieces of beef, where the server would stir/cook them on the table using the pot of broth. Beef was tender and flavorful especially dipped in either the ponzu or sesame sauce. \n\nMAINE LOBSTER RISOTTO - Risotto was creamy and very flavorful. The portion size looked like it could be served as an entree as it was pretty filling. \n\nLIBERTY FARMS DUCK BREAST - Loved this dish very much! Skin was crispy, while the meat was tender. It was cooked to a perfect medium-rare! Flavors were on point! :)\n\nHIBISCUS TAPIOCA WITH CUSTARD (Amuse Bouche) - Delicious! Perfect way to end the night. \n\nService was not too bad that night with our water cups always filled. However, the entrees took way too long to arrive. It took 40 minutes between the middle course and the entrees to arrive.

When the food and service are not outstanding, there is no reason for me to come back. \n\nI came here for New Year Eve so I was ready expecting to pay top dollars for the prix fixe menu. However, I was expecting something much better from a Michelin starred restaurant. The courses were (I apologize but I really forgot the names): sashimi, seared scallop, lobster risotto, prime rib steak, and panna cotta.\n\nI loved the sashimi. It was accompanied by freshly grated wasabi. The fish was already at room temperature which allowed me to taste the freshness even more. \n\nThe seared scallop with black truffle tasted good but there was nothing special about it. I am a big sucker for black truffle but even this didn't wow me.\n\nThe lobster risotto was a disappointment. The rice was way under cooked because the middle of the grain was still hard. The lobster was about a thumb size big which is....REALLY?  The taste was butter but really lack the lobster taste. \n\nThe prime rib steak was amazing because the meat just melts in your mouth. The only complain I had was there wasn't even of it. Panna cotta was meh.\n\nI didn't expect to get impressed by all of the courses but at least hit 3 out of 5 course...NYE was supposed to be special but I felt like I could get these courses at any decent restaurants. This was probably the most expensive Michelin 1-star restaurant in SF and also the least impressive. \n\nI wasn't impressed with the service either. First, they sat us in front of the main entrance. No one but us sat there so it was freaking cold. Second, they kept on pushing for wine purchase. They asked about 3 to 4 times through the meal. At some point, the waitress tried to be \"nice\" and phrased, \"would you care to split a glass of wine?\" I felt nice and generous because it's NYE so I asked about it then she recommended the most expensive glass on the menu.

The meal started off with the chef's complimentary grilled cheese with roasted corn soup. It was super super delicious, I wanted more after the bite size and tea cup portion!! Then the honey bread with the maple butter? O.M.G., it was so good. I had to tell the waiter to stop asking me if I wanted more because there's no way I can say \"no\".\n\nThe risotto was really creamy and the portion was actually really big for an appetizer. It was enough to share among two people and still looked like it could be served as an entree. The shabu beef, I probably wouldn't get it. The beef quality was good, but it just isn't the same when you have the waiter who combined everything for you in the mushroom broth and then served the beef that's almost rare. The experience isn't the same as the actual shabu experience. The main entrees were pretty good too.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-11-25", "description": "Overall, their portions are decent, it may be a little dinky for some people especially for appetizers, but come on people, it's quality over quantity at times. I ordered their dungeness crab salad, shabu shabu with prime ribeye, and their famous lobster potpie . My love ordered their scallops, shabu shabu for himself, and duck breast.  Our meal began with an amuse bouche of a chestnut soup and grilled cheese. Oh boy! MM version of The Melt! I wasn't too impressed with the grilled cheese, it's understandable that very pungent cheese (in a good way) could be distasteful to some, and could mess up the palette of the rest of the meal. I didn't enjoy it as much as I did with the chestnut soup. It was definitely too hot to handle, took me a few tries to actually sip and enjoy the soup without burning my throat. The soup has a nice texture, creamy but not too thick. It's light enough in the flavors to not be too overwhelming, but I would think twice if it was offered as an appetizer on its own.  \n\nThe appetizers were fairly standard, I do have a slight preference on the scallops for that natural sweetness that stood out. Overall, the ingredients of the scallops dish are very well chosen.  It's not a crazy dish where you would be amazed and missed indefinitely.  Very well prepared, I have a tendency of finding scallops being overcooked, but not in this case.  Unfortunately for my salad, the dungeness crab was a bit bland and it's crab season.  I think it would be a better choice to shift the focus from the crab to the persimmons. The sauce and each bite of the persimmon brought out all of its fragrant flavors and well ripe sweetness. It could be a bit overwhelming if you're not used to that taste. \n\nNow to the bread, one of the best part of dinner. We were served with slice of sourdough and a blend of honey, ricotta, salt spread. I digged that ricotta cheese, but not too much of the honey. I stirred the mixture a bit too much and ended up with more honey than I would have liked. The honey taste just overpowered the rest of the bread. My second try of taking more ricotta than honey made it more enjoyable.\n\nAnd now the fun part. Took a bit long, but our shabu shabu came! Two people came with our two orders as one described each component of the dish and prepared the swishing for us. I felt a bit sorry for my server, because he was having such a hard time with the chopsticks, trying to pick up my meat to swish while the other guy had began the swishing. I really wanted to offer help to get the meat into the little pot of broth. The pieces of meat were swished until they were pink all around, then served with a broth that's a bit too salty and heavy on the soy sauce. A bit of a disappointment because the broth is the best part when it comes to nabemono. The meat comes with a orangey ponzu and peanut sauce, quite traditional for the most part, at this point it's up to your own liking. I prefer the peanut sauce because it balances out the saltiness from the broth. \n\nI got a very similar presentation when my lobster potpie was ready. Began with a nearly empty plate with some pomegranate and squash puree, then added the pie crust, lobster tails, veggies, claws, then slowly scooping in the pumpkin puree over the whole dish. Presentation was very informative and beautiful, but the execution is a bit lacking. Perhaps there is the whole presentation of the dish, my lobster became slightly too well-done. The texture becomes too chewy, and noticeable when you try to cut it piece by piece. The claws were perfect, this issue was only on the tail. The pie crust becomes lost in mushiness, only a few flakes survived the pumpkin flood. Cauliflower is a bit undercook, a bit bland compared to the other veggies and a bit too stiff. Aside from the aroma of pumpkin, the next scent that stood out was from the carrots, well prepared carrots, not overcooked to mushy state and retains the texture but enough to have a nice blend of flavors with the pumpkin and the potatoes. I had much higher expectations for this dish, since it is a signature. Coming back to try it in other seasons? Maybe.\n\nThe two of us shared a dessert service where you get mini versions of a bit of everything on their dessert menu. My favorite out of the list was the poached pear. Very Asian of me, but I enjoy light desserts that has a mini spotlight on every ingredient presented. I find the date cake a bit too strange, date has a strong and distinct flavor, which sadly was too overwhelming in this situation. Generally I say it's doable if it's a bit more subtle. Everything else was alright, except the white chocolate crisp. It's one of those sad things about me and desserts, I cannot do white chocolate no matter how many times I've tried. Too sweet and just puts me in an unhappy and disgusted state. \n\nBut luckily, I have my scotch! However, MM needs to sync their drink menus better, I happened to order one from the dessert menu and was not available. (Damn limit on Yelp..)", "author": "Connie C."}

The whole affair took an astounding SIX HOURS. Now, some of that may have been the lengthy conversations with my friend about travel, but a lot of it was the menu.\n\nAnd let me tell you- everything was amazing.\n\nI didn't have a single bad bite all evening. Even the coffee was stunning. I had foods I'd never normally eat (oysters, caviar, thick sashimi) and I loved it all. But at $160 a person, or $259 with the wine pairings, I can't exactly recommend this to anyone. It's just too much bloody money for any mere mortal.

Decided to come here with a few friends and experienced decent food with horrible service from our server Jennifer. In general, everything was decent except for our server. The fact that this was a three hour eating experience and came with the unique style of service that our server decided to provide, this must be one of the most unpleasant dining experiences I have ever experienced. \n\nOur server, Jennifer, went out of her way to avoid our table, although she frequently checked on the three tables surrounding ours. Within this three hour dining period, she checked on our table twice, both occuring at the last 30 minutes of our meal. When I flagged her down like a San Francisco Taxi to ask for something, she didn't provide and we had to flag down another server to get the service requested. (I guess the taxi flagging skills that were once useful in San Francisco came in handy at this restaurant, although now obsolete thanks to Uber). The amount of discrimination from this server is quite shocking, especially at the level of establishment Michael Mina's is proclaimed to be. \n\nOther than the horrible service and discrimination from our server, everything was decent to good. We had the ten course tasting menu and I would say eight of the ten courses were excellent.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-12", "description": "There are two words to describe Michael Mina's eponymous establishment, which has now shifted back to the old Aqua space on California from the echo chamber that is the Westin. Those words are not \"rip\" and \"off\". No, they are \"precocious\" and \"eclectic\". The man obviously has more culinary creativity in his pinkie than Rachael Ray displays in a season's worth of 30-minute meals. Yum-O. Mina's restaurant is still on Michael Bauer's Top 100, no small feat, but Michelin stripped his stars away in their last two guides. Polarizing views from elitists. Celebrating Jamie W.'s new job, I finally tried his luxuriant restaurant for the first time this week, and despite what may require a second mortgage, my honest feeling is that there is magic to be experienced here. \n\nDespite just a one-day reservation, we were seated right next to the California Street window where we had a clear view of all the cellphone abusers and the passing gawkers. We began with a rather unassuming amuse bouche - a Grilled Cheese Finger Sandwich and a cup of Corn Chowder (see photos). A modest opener for sure. Then we received the first of several round of the toasted Firebrand Sourdough bread with a small ramekin of Ricotta Cheese mixed with Marscarpone and Unfiltered Honey and sprinkled with Sea Salt (see photo). Who needs butter? That was addicting. We decided to throw caution to the wind and try the Chilled Shellfish platter at $35 per person (see photo). Worth it. So fresh. \n\nThree different oysters all fresh-from-the-sea fresh. Chunks of unbelievably buttery Maine lobster in a ramekin. Dungeness crab legs cracked and ready to suck. Perfectly formed blue shrimp. There was also a side of fried crayfish heads with aioli, and a ceviche salad with toasted lavash dipped in squid ink (see photos). Indulgent, very indulgent. So we had the gall to order another appetizer, the $17 Australian Wagyu Shabu Shabu, which is quite a production with a little fire pot set ablaze on your table with what looks like a Mr. Coffee filter on top with the Dashi broth inside. On a separate plate is a stunning radish salad with perfectly manicured leaves of bok choy and strips of the wagyu beef slung over the leaves in a decorative mosaic (see photo). \n\nNever mind how it looked, it just tasted lovely with the right wrist movement in my shabu shabu technique (if I do say so myself). At last, the entrees. Jamie ordered the $36 McFarland Springs Trout with Fava Beans, Potato Confit and Pancetta (see photo). The accompaniment was tasty, and the trout was as melty as salmon split between the tender fillet and the fried skin with delicate roe spooned on top. Mine was one of Mina's trademark trio dishes, the $35 Three Little Pigs (see photo). The cheek appeared braised and had a velvety consistency, and the belly was molded into a mini-loaf and encrusted with brown sugar. The two small rounds of tenderloin came encased like a sausage, and it was ladled with a pork au jus and a stone fruit mostarda. Lovely morsels over far too soon. \n\nDessert was an endless cornucopia of sweets ($15 per person). It started with a freebie, and it was a goodie - Pineapple poached in Vanilla and Cardamom over a wedge of Olive Oil Cake and served with a canela of Vanilla Ice Cream (see photo). Then came the Citrus Blossom, a burst of flavor with Mandarine, Fior de Sicilia and Kumquat; White Chocolate and Grapefruit Crisps, and Rolled Wafers made of Jasmine and Brown Sugar (see photo). More? Yes. A startling presentation of Chevre Cheesecake with Strawberries, Rhubarb and Pistachios (see photo) followed by Coffee and Cardamom Briquettes and finally Milk Chocolate and Honey Lozenges (see photos). Whew! We were overly sated to be honest. \n\nThere are starving children in China, my mama done told me. But not that night. It was all about self-indulgence and having a dining experience worthy of Wills and Kate. So if the shekels have not fallen through the hole in your sock, you deserve the masterful culinary delights to be found at Michael Mina. The service was exemplary and not at all stuffy. Our evening clocked in at about two-and-a-half hours. Our bill including the tip but without wine was $270. Before you start clutching your throat, keep in mind that we passed on the market-priced Maine Lobster Pot Pie. The price that evening? $75. Now you can gasp. \n\nFOOD - 5 stars...like I said, precocious and eclectic...oh and tasty, too \nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...still the old Aqua vibe, very cosmo chic \nSERVICE - 5 stars...attentive and informative...thank you Allison \nTOTAL - 5 stars...oh yes, we're worth it", "author": "Ed U."}

But after my favorite place, La Folie, was unable to accommodate my sizable family, I decided to give Michael Mina another go. Ron Seigel and the new prix-fixe menu seemed promising. \n\nThe four-course prix-fixe menu provides great value. With a big family, you definitely get to try a little bit of everything.  The food overall was okay but flavors were muted. The inventiveness of the crispy rice in curry-like dashi broth was good, but the execution was lacking.  I am passionate about Japanese food (as well as Flavortown sans Guy Fieri), and at Michael Mina, the purity of the ingredients did not seep out.  The most disappointing dish was the prime black angus rib eye.  It was just meat cooked properly, but didn't have much flavor and the sauce provided no enhancement. \n\nService was mixed.  The servers were attentive, although standard. The first sommelier seemed helpful and nice with the bottle of Chilean red that I brought.  Yet when I wanted to order a bottle of wine for the table, I received another sommelier.  I was deciding between a Northern and Southern Rhone wine and asked about the difference between the two wines. All the second sommelier said was, \"It's just bolder.\" I looked at his face for more information, but he seemed hurried and just wanted to take my wine order.  I was stunned that Michael Mina would have someone it called a sommelier to say, \"It's just bolder\", given that RN74 is part of the Mina empire.  \n\nUnfortunately, there won't be a next time.

None of the food was really awful, but nothing really blew me away either. I think you're better off with the a la carte menu. \n\nI really don't feel like going through every single dish mainly because most weren't very memorable, but there were a couple highlights. The Lobster Tortellono had the perfect al dente bite, and the stuffing was a hearty piece of well seasoned lobster. They did a good job with bringing out the lobster's flavor. I also liked the A5 Wagyu because well, it's A5 Wagyu. Interestingly, sansho pepper was supposed to be part of the ingredients, but I couldn't taste it unfortunately. The beef was still rich and tender although a bit overcooked. \n\nThe execution on most dishes was done extremely well with perfectly cooked lobster, squab, fish, etc., but a lot of the flavors were underwhelming or just weird at times. There was a salmon dish with quince jam and one lobster course that was served with this melon soup. I don't know what the deal was with pairing seafood with sweet fruit, but I thought those sweet flavors got in the way of the natural sweetness of the seafood. \n\nSpeaking of sweets, I'm pretty sure half our meal was desserts. The Chocolate Tahini was very chocolatey, and there was a lot of it in the fancy glass cup. The bourbon filled candy was also a pleasant surprise. Its spice and hints of vanilla blended well with the thick and heavy chocolate. This dessert by itself was more substantial than a lot of the savory courses, especially the ones that just consisted of just a sliver of fish. Add in all the other desserts, and they started to overshadow the main courses. I love desserts and sweets, but I wasn't expecting them to become the focus.", "author": "Nei N."}

The food didn't blow me away as much as my very favorite SF restaurants, but it was all pretty good and there were some incredible standout dishes.\n\nThe aforementioned husband messed up the reservation and so we came on the wrong day, but fortunately they had walk-in seating available at the bar and they serve the full menu there.  I definitely would have preferred to dine in the dining room, but since we could get the exact same food at the bar (including the amuse) and we had driven all the way to SF, we didn't want to turn around and go home.  \n\nWe both had the 4-course, $95 prix fixe.  There's a much longer tasting menu but I didn't see any a la carte option like others have mentioned.  You're supposed to choose one course from each category but they nicely let me have two selections from the third course category and none from the second course category.  \n\nWe started with an amuse trio - a fried tofu with curry oil, a panna cotta with bits of apple and a spinach-wrapped bit of poached trout.  All were very good, and unique, but the fried tofu was especially amazing.  For our first course, my husband had abalone with sushi rice and miso, which he loved, & I had seared foie (it's baaaaack!!!)  It was incredible, definitely one of the best foie preparations I've had with the thick cranberry sauce and crispy, buttery bread.  The portion was very generous too.  For our second courses, my husband had the pork chop and raved about it, and I had the potato gnocchi (from the third course section of the menu).  The gnocchi were wonderful and the kale and mushrooms were nice sides.\n\nThe meal started going downhill a bit here, beginning with the long gap between the second and third course.  I think the gap between these courses was longer than the spaces between all the other courses combined.   My husband's third course was a duck breast he wasn't wild about.  Mine was the butter-poached lobster.  The lobster itself was cooked perfectly and very delicious, but I wasn't a big fan of the accompaniments (asparagus puree with a weird citrus-y flavor and the same King Trumpet mushrooms that had been used in my previous course).    The desserts were a bit of a disappointment to me too.  My husband enjoyed his cheese plate, but my \"dark chocolate\" wasn't dark at all and didn't have much going on besides two small blobs of chocolate and little bits of grapefuit.  (The portion was also pretty stingy, it looks bigger in my photo but it was really just two bites).  There were several mignardises (hibiscus macarons, jellys, and cinnamon caramels) given with the bill.\n\nOverall, while I wouldn't put this on my short list of best restaurants in SF, it was definitely a very good meal & one I'm glad we got to experience.", "author": "A M."}

My wife and I had wanted to try Michael Mina for years but sort of avoided thinking the quality may have been diluted as Chef Mina expanded more and more. We were wrong and hats off to the chef and team at Michael Mina.\n\nWe did the 7 course tasting menu, along with the wine pairings which I highly recommend. The menu was fairly seafood based and my wife and I tend to prefer reds. After a disappointing experience at Manresa a few months back where we were served beer, sake, all whites, and a single glass of red... we asked our server if they could pair one extra red with a dish instead of a white.\n\nOur Sommelier Claude came by with the first course and explained to us he would be happy to help out. Claude really made our night after that. With each wine he brought out, he took the time to explain where the wine came from, how the grapes were grown & processed, and what made that wine unique. We loved hearing the background of the wine rather than just the varietal and where it is from. We all agreed on having a red with the squid course (last seafood before the foie gras).\n\nWell Claude ended up finding an extra red to go with the Japanese Ayu course which blew us away. The fish was light and sweet with a cucumber melon sauce. He picked a Gamay that won the night for wines and I couldn't believe how well it paired with the dish. Great knowledge and it really made our night.\n\nEvery course we had was amazing. There were subtle flavors or accents that complimented the dish but didn't take it over. Portions were perfect, although we were stuffed by the end. Probably too much bread with an amazing ricotta olive oil spread. Aside from the Gamay with Ayu (and maybe foie gras) the bread was one of our favorites.\n\nThe service and food were perfection. If you go, I really do recommend getting the tasting menu with wine pairings. Looking around at other tables it's definitely worth it. We've eaten all over at amazing restaurants and I think the entire experience between food, wine, and service at Michael Mina has put it at the top of our list over Manresa, French Laundry, Plumed Horse, etc.", "author": "Steve C."}

Umm, that's it for the pros-they are the only reason for 2 stars.\n\nCons:  lobster pot pie ordered off the restaurant menu.  No price but hey, how much could one pot pie be?  I'll tell you how much...$85!  Yes. One pot pie was $85. Okay, i would TOTALLY be ok with it if it was something extraordinary.  But. It. Wasn't.  The Phyllo dough either wasn't phyllo dough or was completely baked improperly....i have never had doughy phyllo in my life. The filling was thickened with what seemed like cornstarch (or a roux and just totally too thick).  Either way, no excuse for the price.\n\nThere are SO many amazing places in the Bay Area, there is absolutely NO reason to spend the money here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-21", "description": "Though I am new to the fine dining world and do not have much to compare it to, Michael Mina's lunch was the best meal I've personally ever had. I got the 4 course lunch tasting menu for $55.\n\n1st Course: Foie Gras with Black Cherry Compote\nThis was a substitute for the standard first course because of a shrimp allergy in our party. Actually, by far, my least favorite dish for the whole course. The sweet black cherry compote complemented the foie gras, but I personally have never been a huge fan of foie gras and the piece of bread provided with the course was very small. After finishing the bread, I wasn't sure if it was expected to simply eat the foie gras by itself. For me, it was way too rich, and I left it unfinished.\n\n2nd Course: Ahi Tuna Tartare with Habanero-Infused Sesame Oil and Quail Egg Yolk\nI am trying to be fair to everything else I've eaten in my 20-odd years of life but I honestly think this is the single best dish I have ever had. The flavors of the oil and egg yolk combined with the pine nuts and light garlic powder were orgasmic. The tuna itself was extremely fresh and high quality as well I couldn't help but savor each bite for a good 20 to 30 seconds before continuing. A must try on the menu.\n\n3rd Course: Lightly Seared King Salmon with Shiitake, Snap peas, and Sushi Rice in a Yuzu-Miso Broth\nI've never had a better cooked piece of salmon, seared just enough to be slightly crispy on the outside, yet tender and juicy on the inside. Simply amazing. I initially wasn't a fan of the broth but it quickly grew on me as I tasted it in combination with the other components. What really impressed me about this restaurant was how much the paid attention to the minor details in each dish. In this dish, everything was great, but the shiitake mushrooms were truly exceptional. \n\n4th Course: Prime Black Angus Ribeye\nAs an avid steak lover, this ribeye was done flawlessly. Rare and juicy in the center, yet with an amazing crust on the edges. My 2nd favorite course of the meal. The other components of the dish like the red quinoa, asparagus, and cherry sauce were not noteworthy besides the potatoes, which were astounding: slightly crispy on the outside and warm and soft in the center. Never have had better potatoes.\n\nDessert: Chantilly Cream with Jasmine, Hibiscus Foam, Chicharron, Raspberry Compote, and Tapioca\nThough I am not much of a dessert person, this course was a great exclamation point to conclude the meal. The hibiscus foam was deliciously tart and brought the flavor to the cream, while the chicharron brought a crunchy texture that together made for an unforgettable end to the meal. I felt that the raspberry compote and tapioca did not add much to this dish as they were overshadowed by the flavor and texture of the other components. \n\nI highly recommend this place especially as a first foray into fine dining. The price is not too steep considering the quality of the food. Besides the food, the service was attentive and the place had a nice, quiet ambiance to it. It did not seem crowded during Tuesday lunch so it seems possible to even drop by without a reservation.", "author": "Kevin T."}

This was our second visit and the only reason we went back was because we were guests of a party.  It was every bit as disappointing as the first time.  Everything is decent...NOTHING is great.  The final course before desert was steak.  It was prepared by a true amateur, which is a shame because it was very high quality meat.  So badly under cooked that nobody came close to finishing it.  Gross!  We didn't send it back for more fire because the service was so darn bad, we couldn't imagine extending the 4 hour evening another 10 minutes.

The fish was cooked perfectly and the ribs in the ravioli were tender and very flavorful along with the sauce.  We had a nice bottle of Chilean red wine to share with our meals.  Perfect!

(I weight about 155ish at 5'9)  And still, the both of us managed to finish the 2 desserts.  Each dish had its own unique build of flavors that completely bombard the mouth!

I was really looking forward to dinner here but the truth is, it just didn't deliver... I had the 10 course menu and the experience was sadly the least enjoyable tasting, both in SF and other destinations. There was more wrong than there was right and quite honestly the food just wasn't tasty or even cohesive at times. Quality was unfortunately questionable as well, certainly unmatched to the pricing...I question the ingredients due to how I felt after the meal as well. Perhaps it was just a bad night however everyone in my party agreed that the food was either bland, unbalanced, or one note. Not made to impress or with the preparation detail you would expect. Sure the plating itself is pretty but the selections were just lacking.\n\nThe service was all over the place and rushed...servers would come by and pick up plates and beverages that weren't finished - without asking if it was alright to take away. The staff seemed to be in a hurry and spoke very quickly and low explaining each course/pairing considering the quite loud volume of the room, (mostly coming from the bar, causing all patrons to have to speak loudly to match) At one point the servers forgot to include a spoon for a broth dish. Another example, there would be empty used glasses still on the table when a new pairing arrived. It just felt disorderly. All in all we were served by many faces and everyone was quick to leave, without being particularly attentive. We were surprised at the lack of care and attention given to the entire experience. Some of the exchanges even felt phony. As a diner I never want to feel this way. I certainly didn't expect inconsistencies on this level at a Michael Mina establishment.

Son loved the bluefin, wife said the kanpachi was warm?\n\nChilled Dungeness Crab Salad - My favorite dish.  Delicious.  There was Umami and made me smile.  Thanks Ron Siegel. \n\nSlow Scrambled Jidori Hen Egg - Nice touch, uni scrambled together with the egg was perfectly seasoned and had great richness.\n\nSeared Maine Diver Scallops - Caviar, very nice.  Probably my other favorite dish.  The salty richness of the caviar paired very well with the soft texture and flavor of the scallop.\n\nThis is when it started going downhill:\n\nBlue Prawns - More like just shrimps.  Overdone, way over done.  I mean I have 13/15 Black Tiger Vietnam prawns I buy at Costco and I can make it 10 times better.  40 seconds blanched from frozen, med rare inside.  Plump and juicy.  Not the case here.  They quickly made a new plate for me.  It was hot but still a bit too done for me.  Cotes du Jura wine, I did not like this pairing, way too strong for overdone shrimps.\n\nPork belly/shoulder and Butter Poached Lobster - Lobster way over seasoned and super salty along with the chicories.  Pork belly was a bit dry and the fatty parts were tough, not braised enough to fall apart in my mouth.  \n\nOcean trout and Short Rib Ravioli - Fish was seasoned a little too well but cooked nicely.  Ravioli not bad either.  It got a little better from here.\n\nI loved the dessert.  Peppermint Ice Cream reminded me that it was Christmas and I should not be pissed off for dining at Michael Mina.\n\nKids: All dishes were very good.\n\nSpicy sausage cavatelli\nDuo of beef short rib\nMilk Chocolate Custard\n\nOverall, for the money we spent, I expected to be blown away a few times.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-27", "description": "Anniversary dinner with wife.  Started off the night with a nice pair of cocktails at the bar.  I have to say the cocktails were really good.\n\nWe decided to go for the four course, and while I wasn't quite sure it would be enough food for me, it was plenty since the wife needed help :)  I got the Bluefin tuna, suckling pig duo, butter poached lobster, and dark chocolate.  I decided to get the wine pairing with the four course, because our waitress said the pours were not that large.\n\nThe blue-fin tuna was plated beautifully, with some sort of stripe of salt on the plate.  Tuna sashimi was definitely excellent quality, but nothing too special or out of the ordinary.  The radishes were a nice touch.  I got a dry Riesling with the tuna, which was nice, even though I don't usually prefer wines with my sashimi.  It paired pretty well because the riesling wasn't sweet and had a clean taste to it.\n\nThe suckling pig duo was really nice, with the crispy skin on it being oh so good!  The ragout and sauce really made the dish.  It was at this point that I wasn't quite sure what was going on with the wine pairing, as the sommelier explained that the rose I got would pair nicely with the \"salmon\" and \"fresh summer vegetables\".  I would have said something, however, the rose had a nice sharpness that cut through the pork's fatty meat and I enjoyed the pairing regardless.\n\nThe main course was a butter poached lobster that came with some summer vegetables like cucumbers, tomatoes, avocado, and a tomato gazpacho sauce.  The waitress was right about the sauces they use at MM, they're quite delicious.  Sadly, I think the suckling pig was a heavier dish than the lobster, as the lobster dish felt more like a warm salad rather than a substantial entree.  Still, it's my fault for ordering it, and it was still really good.  The sommelier then came out with a Pinot Noir to go with my \"Duck\" dish, which was incorrect again.  At this point, I had to correct her, and mentioned that I didn't get the duck.  She stuck to her guns though, and really recommended the Pinot with the lobster as well.  I thought I disagreed with the choice given that the lobster, even though butter poached, was quite a refreshing dish and would have been served better with a white.\n\nThe dessert was a piece of pistachio crusted dark chocolate with apricot sorbet in a crispy shell.  We also got a slice of cake with chocolate and carmel layers on top, which was fantastic.  Furthermore, we got some berry flavored jelly and ginger flavored carmel (which were both unique, but just okay).  The wine pairing ended with a dessert wine which wasn't too sweet, thankfully.  Strangely, the dessert wine was the only wine which I got a full pour for, but sadly didn't need, since it was a dessert wine.\n\nOverall, the food was excellent, but next time, I may just pick my own wines.  It wasn't quite worth the extra $65 for the four small pours.  I didn't yet mention any of the service during our dinner, but it's definitely worth bringing up.  It was one of the most attentive and well run table services that I've had.  Everything from the water, silverware, napkin replacement, level of cheerfulness of staff was just perfect.  Definitely a Michelin star worthy performance.", "author": "Mas M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-11-11", "description": "This review is for Ron Siegal at Michael Mina. \n\nWhen I found out that he announced he was leaving Parallel 37 to join Michael Mina, I was cheering for him. But at the same time, I was leery of what MM is going to be for him. My experience with MM has mostly been misses - Arcadia in SJ was overpriced and MM about 8 years ago was overhyped.  I am a huge Chef Siegal fan so I waited for about 2 months for him to settle down at his new gig before heading over there for the tasting menu.\n\nI made reservations for 5.30p on 11/10/12 thinking that we would have the enough time to enjoy the tasting menu and get to the Orpheum for the 8p show.  1 hour stuck in bumper to bumper traffic in RWC had me thinking it wasn't meant to be. But after a series of inside roads, we finally made our way up there.\n\nBy the time  the car was safely parked by valet and we are seated, it was already 6.15p. I asked our host if we could still have the tasting menu and be done by 7.30p. He went to the kitchen and said the Chef is pumped up by the challenge and will accommodate us for it. (5 star earned by the kitchen right there).\n\nThe meal:\n1) Raw kumamoto half shell with foam\n- We were also immediately served the amuse bouche as soon as our drinks came (Syrah pour'elle and the non-alcoholic Indian Limeade pour moi).\n\n1.5) Indian Limeade\nLime, sparkling water, loads of kaffir lime leaves. The tanginess of the drink was great with the heaviness of the latter savory dishes. Recommend highly.\n\n2) Nantucket Bay Scallops\n- The scallop was cooked just right with a crisp slight crunch outside and tender but not raw inside. The tiny shaved black truffle on top was an added sensory treat as we bite into the scallops\n\n3) Toasted sourdough with honey butter\n- Our pain du jour was a healthy slice of bread. The highlight was the local honey that topped the butter that came with the bread.\n\n4) Kona Kanpachi Sashimi\nHave to say dehydrated soy salt on kanpachi sashimi is pure genius-  having the  salt of soy sauce accompanying the sashimi sans the mess. All fusion sashimi sashimi should be prepared this way.\n\n6) Pan Fried Monterey Bay Abalone\n His abalone in light shiitake and dashi broth had amazing flavor that I was tempted to lick the bowl.   Never expected ice plant on a dinner plate but it was good!  Also, the chef had created a new broth just for me that night because I had mentioned that I am allergic to soy products. The original menu called for due miso consomme.\n\n6) Slow-roasted Ocean Trout\n The simplicity of ocean trout and leek with black truffle lobster sauce jus is the best ocean trout dish I have eaten.  I enjoyed the presentation of this 2-part dish. The Jus was poured on top of the trout onto a plate peppered with holes. Once we were done eating the trout, the servers came and revealed sticky rice with dungeness crab soaked in the trout-flavored jus. Yom.\n\n7) 38 North Duck Breast.\nThis dish makes me convinced that noone can do duck quite like Chef Siegel can.  Plump and juicy meat lovingly wrapped by crispy well seasoned skin, I am drooling just thinking about it.\n\n8) Black Angus Rib Eye\nI am convinced  By the time the ribeye came I was ready to explode from all the food but it was so good I somehow managed to finish everything on the plate *again*  \n\n9) Concord Grape sorbet with Avocado \nThe palate cleanser was just that.\n\n10) Tiramisu in White\nBeautiful presentation in a box. We were too full to eat it and had to run off to watch Lion King. \n\n\nI have eaten at Dining Room @ Ritz a few times over the years when Chef Siegal was cooking there. Dining Room had turned into Parallel 37.  I went to Parallel 37 about a month before Chef Siegal announced he was leaving. Needless to say I am glad he is at a better place now. Bravo and Congratulations Chef. I look forward to eating there more.\n\n\n\n #considerthismylovenotetoRonSiegal", "author": "Att A."}

This was the best meal I've ever had. Everything was so precisely done, from the service to the preparation of the food. Here's my breakdown:\n\nAmbiance: The restaurant was three quarters full when I went on a Wednesday night. I didn't feel like it was noisy, but I was also seated near the front of the restaurant windows around only a couple of other parties. The bar looked pretty busy. The d\u00e9cor is tasteful. My dinner had an intimate feeling with dimmed lighting. \n\nService: My date and I arrived a few minutes early for our reservation. We were greeted and our coats were taken. We only had to wait one minute while they made sure everything was set for our table. There was a card on my place setting from the General Manager. He was wishing me happy birthday and thanking me for choosing to spend my birthday there. Though pretty generic, I think it's a nice memento to keep. The service was fantastic. Our server was very attentive, checking in on us multiple times during the night for drink refills. The staff member that served and explained each of our dishes was knowledgeable, describing each component of the dishes. There were also other members of the staff who replenished our waters and bread promptly.\n\nFood: The food! Again, I'll say this was the best meal I've ever had. We had the Chef's Ketto menu, which is a nine course tasting menu. The concept is great - a dueling menu. Between two people you each get a different dish for each course - they can be contrasting in preparation or flavor. We ate half of our own plates then switched, so we had 18 different tastes each (actually more, since the desserts had more than five components!). I've posted photos of most of the dishes. One dish I really liked was compliments of the chef, a tempura-like shrimp with an uni custard. The shrimp was so delicious and moist with a crispy outside.  The meal also featured beef two ways, quail, and fresh fresh sashimi. Each dish had it's own unique flavor. By the time we got to desserts, I was bordering on full. There were two dessert courses, each with multiple items. A great ending to a wonderful meal.\n\nI highly recommend checking out Michael Mina for your next special night. You will not regret it!", "author": "Lauren F."}

This was my third time, but first time not doing the prix fixe menu, and I've been blown away every time.  \n\nFirst off, the cocktails are refreshing & perfectly balanced. My Moscow Mule gingery-lime slush. \n\nEach time I've come, my meal begins with the world's most perfect grilled cheese sandwich and shooter of soup. In the past I had tomato, asparagus, and now potato and leek soup. I don't know how they do it, but that grilled cheese is phe.no.menal. They're both so perfect, yet so small, you definitely wish there was more. I guess that's why they do it. \n\nThis is the second time I've had the tuna tartar and once again, it melted in my mouth. It is served with a quail egg yolk that is mixed up at your table and is one of the most interesting/ flavorful dishes I've ever had. Dusted with ancho chili powder, sprinkled with pine nuts, the egg, the so soft tartar, mint... and toast. It's wonderful. The deconstructed lobster pot pie is also a necessity. Oh, and they also start your meal off with toast & a Mascarpone/ honey spread. Mind-blown. \n\nDesserts are inventive, beautiful, & are sure to tickle your fancy. Last night, I ate what appeared to be a hard candy dusted in powered sugar. To my surprise and delight, it was so much more.\n\nThe service here is also spot on.

I was so excited, I jumped the gun by going to Mina's newest restaurant, Bardot, in Vegas two months ago. Whether his latest endeavor or his namesake location, Mina is two for two with me. As a new fan, I can't wait to try his Glendale restaurant in my hometown of Los Angeles.\n\nDish after dish, the cooking was complex, detailed, delicate, and balanced. Even parts of a dish were worthy enough to be an entire dish like the wagyu ravioli in the abalone appetizer. The ravioli was rich and luscious without being heavy.  It was one of the best things I've eaten this year.\n\nRich proteins were not given the standard sweet accompaniments. The seared foie gras with raw and tart fruits like blackberries and firm pink lemonade blueberries allowed the wonderful characteristics of unadulterated, exquisite ingredients to shine. Duck breast wasn't paired with the typical sweet fruit sauce, but found greater character alongside grilled turnip and white onion along with fried tofu.\n\nAsian dishes were mildly turned French like the crispy suckling pig with baby leek and chanterelle mushroom. French dishes were mildly turned Asian like fried soft shell crab in a Thai-style lemongrass broth.\n\nNot all dishes lit my fire like the butter-poached Maine lobster which, as a third course entr\u00e9e, seemed like a first course salad using commonly combined ingredients like avocado, basil, and cucumber. The brown and frothy tomato gazpacho neither looked attractive nor adhered to the other ingredients.\n\nThe desserts were clean and light like the fruit-focused almond dacquoise or the \"shiso granite\" in a strawberry sauce.\n\nThe wine list was big, broad, and expensive. The sommelier was very attentive.\n\nAs the flagship of the Mina restaurant empire, I expected a more formal setting - not one where the hostess stand, bar, and waiter stations were in full view. I had the 4-course dinner and left hungry. Sure, it allows for snacking at a bar or lounge before or after dinner, but when dinner for two exceeds $400, this place is priced for the wealthy.

MM has outstanding service! There was a kind birthday card from the manager waiting for my bf at the table. The servers are knowledgeable about the menu and very patient. I was amazed at how superb the service was without feeling like they were hovering over our table. We ordered one tasting menu (7 courses) and 4 other things off the menu so that we could taste a variety of things. Their portions here are pretty small, but because it was a 3+ hour meal, we were stuffed at the end. \n\nTrio of Oysters w/ Pimm's Cup, Basil French 75 and Bloody Mary Sauces (Half Dozen): Fresh, delicious raw oysters on the half shell. The sauces are interesting, unique and icy.\n\nAmuse Bouche of Mushroom Soup & Grilled Cheese: YUM. The little cup was packed with mushroom flavor. The grilled cheese is perfect to dip into the soup. We were left wanting more of this. It was just soo good.\n\nGrilled Sourdough Bread & Spread (Honey, Mascarpone, Ricotta): They give you a thick piece of well-grilled bread with a little container of the spread. The sauce is interesting, but the honey works. I appreciate that they tried to do something out of the box with their bread rather than the typical bread & butter basket.\n\nScallops: Three tiny scallops on a squash with truffle shavings. Meh. This thing was so small that I could have probably eaten it in one bite. Each scallop was the size of a mini marshmallow. The truffles weren't prominent and I was expecting way bigger scallops. (1/7 of the tasting menu)\n\nKona Kampachi Sashimi: Four small pieces of fish with rice crackers and soy salt with pomegranate seeds sprinkled on the plate. It was typical sashimi, nothing special/out of the ordinary for us. (2/7 of the tasting menu)\n\nAhi Tuna Tartare: This is mixed table-side and the tuna is shaped into a triangle at the end. I was expecting more of a kick to it because the server mentioned ancho chile and habanero as he was listing what was in it. There was a very subtle heat if any at all. I think they were a little too heavy handed with the sesame oil. The asian pear and pine nuts didn't go well with the dish for me. I've had better tuna tartare elsewhere. However, I would pay $10 for it during their happy hour.\n\nMonterey Bay Abalone: This was surprisingly really good. It was served in a miso broth with tokyo turnips and shiitake mushrooms. I never liked abalone prior to MM, but it's probably because it wasn't cooked properly. The abalone here is delicious! It is definitely not the chewy, overcooked texture that you get at other restaurants. (3/7 of the tasting menu)\n\nMaine Lobster Knuckle: This was just okay as well. It was small and not very tender, a bit chewy. We might be biased though because we compare every lobster to the one we had at Gary Danko, which was pure amazingness. (4/7 of the tasting menu)\n\nSquid Ink Conchiglie: I've had squid ink pasta at an italian restaurant, but it was in a black sauce that got everywhere whereas MM infuses the actual pasta with the squid ink, making the pasta black. I didn't particularly prefer this dish. It was way too salty for my liking and my bf said it was too bitter for him. This was one of my least favorite dishes of the night.\n\nTolenas Farms Quail: Two quarters of quail with huckleberries, mushrooms and other veggies. This was nothing spectacular. It wasn't bad, but it didn't stand out. (5/7 of the tasting menu)\n\nPork Shoulder: This was a FREE dinner course that they gave to each of us just because! It came with rice, mushrooms and other veggies. This was pretty good and I'm not saying that because it was free.\n\nJapanese A5 Wagyu Beef: We decided to upgrade the Rib Eye to the Wagyu (extra $40). I wouldn't recommend doing so because I don't think it was worth it since it's about the price of an entree! It was a pretty small piece and though it was tasty, it wasn't mind-blowing. (6/7 of the tasting menu)\n\n38 North Duck Breast: The duck was really good, one of my favorites of the night! It came with three large pieces and was cooked perfectly. I wish the skin was crispier though.\n\nMy bf got a free birthday cake. Meh. This was just okay. The complimentary Concord Grape Sorbet was delicious though! The Tiramisu in White (7/7 of the tasting menu) was superb. Additional freebies: Jasmine Wafers, Banana Mochi (oh.my.god. SO GOOD), Peppermint Bombe, Walnut Toffee/Dark Chocolate Crisps, Lozenge. The desserts definitely pushed us over and were some of the best we've ever had. The server said he wanted to indulge us and indulge us he did! He also gave us a glass of Cossart-Gordon Colheita Bual, Madeira 1997 and a glass of Mas Amiel Maury, Roussillon, France 2007 on the house!\n\nOne thing I'd say that they could improve on is the variety of ingredients. Repeated things in every dish made them too similar for me (i.e. asian pear, huckleberries, squash).\n\nDarn Yelp's 5000 character limit! I have more to say. :(", "author": "Ava S."}

I had been meaning to try it, since it is one of the few Michelin star holding restaurants in our fine city.\n\nI'm sorry to say I have very little to compliment this place about.\n\nThe lighting was so dim that I could not read the menu without a flashlight.\n\nThe noise level was quite high, which would be fine, except that so many of the wait staff were soft spoken.  If I had been with a dining partner, we would have had to raise our voices to hear each other.  AHH! ROMANCE!\n\nThe serving team were all very friendly, but I had no fewer than five and possibly as many as seven people coming to my table to serve various dishes.  I'm not sure why this put me off, but if I am to spend 2.5 hours at a table, I'd like to feel a temporary connection with the server.\n\nI went with the 9 course tasting menu, and while there were a very small number of tasty combinations-- the amuse-bouche incorporated sea urchin, which is a favorite-- the majority was either unexceptional, over-salted, or downright overcooked.  I was served A5 Wagyu steak, but it was cooked to medium.  WHY?  WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?\n\nI was served blue fin toro sashimi with local wasabi grated before my very eyes, but the toro was nothing to the fish I've many times enjoyed at Ebisu.  \n\nAs other reviewers have commented, most of the dishes were just as described on the menu, with nothing particularly interesting or intense about them.  Given it was 9 courses, so many of them were just a few bites, so it seemed silly to mention any issues with them, as if they would send it back and bring me a *different* three-bite morsel of food.\n\nI had a lovely glass of champagne for $19, and my bill came to $200 before tip.\n\nI was alone and hoping for a pleasant, meditative experience, so I didn't feel that complaining about the meal was appropriate, especially given how friendly and varied the staff were.  I didn't feel I could \"confide\" my feelings.\n\nI'll just say that I have had the opportunity to dine at a 3-star rated restaurant in my life, at Guy Savoy in Paris, and there, too, I felt underwhelmed by the experience.  I wonder if there is a Michelin effect that causes restaurants to get too much into their own hype to keep the focus on what a true pleasure a fine dining experience can be.\n\nI will not be returning to this restaurant.", "author": "Soo S."}

Anyway, we were one of the first people seated. Noticing the entire room, it was standard for most of those professionals working within FiDi (Financial District for the tourists). Very modern, clashes of white, beige, and grey wrestled and wrapped itself throughout the dining room. \n\nMontgomery's row of fine dining options seemed intentional to coerce the usual \"power lunch meetings or merge/acquisition discussions\" necessary in the ever evolving SF jungle.\n\nWe got to try the following items:\n\nDish #1, Appetizer (http://instagram.com/p/w9i0Ifnh77/?modal=true)\nDish #2, Small Plate (http://instagram.com/p/w9lNBhnhwY/?modal=true)\nDish #3, Entree (http://instagram.com/p/w9lsARnhxh/?modal=true)\nDish #4, Dessert (http://instagram.com/p/w9n-q6nh2U/?modal=true)\n\nThe Appetizer was a nice start, great kick in using the Habanero oil to add a bit of substance to the tartare. Pine nuts were unnecessary but that's just me. \n\nThe Scallops were perfect in the second dish, the mushrooms were a nice touch to add composition but the jus... didn't really do it for me. Did not taste any scallops or cauliflower. The presentation was similar to Luce's except instead of using scallops they displayed a perfect balance of sashimi and sauces.\n\nThe third dish, should have convinced me to come back here for dinner. My own Associate Editor really enjoyed your place (perhaps the better stuff is at night and I was out of luck). Sadly, although the steak was cooked perfectly and the waiter upon the kindness of his own generosity decided to provide an extra gram of seasonal alba truffle, for whatever the reason... the truffle lost its impact on the way to the table. I smelled it, but didn't taste the richness, I got more umami from the fried gnocchi and trumpet mushrooms. \n\nDessert, needs a makeover....badly. I was expecting the Quince to make a big impression but my expectations fell flat like the stock market crash. Maybe, this entire experience wasn't meant for someone like myself craving more and paying a higher premium. We broke three digits paying for the entire experience and quite frankly, I was hoping it would be a bit cheaper since I didn't yearn for a revisit.\n\nWhat's even more interested to note is the head chef of TORC (Yountville, Napa) had worked with Michael Mina in the past. The experience was delightful and affordable, the complete opposite of our visit to this well-renowned SF Celebrity Chef. I really want to find a reason to come back... beyond the possibility of eating well and being able to splurge a $500.00 Golden Ossetra Caviar Parfait at will. \n\nThe service is pleasant but the food, is missing an element of impact and soul (if one could describe it as such). Or maybe, after going to 600+ restaurants within the past eight years, my affair with truffle and all things luxurious is over?\n\nWill see.... as my final verdict, I'll give it a 3.5 but not enough to justify a four. Great for business professionals, making a good brunch impression with in-laws, but sketchy for those with a more adventurous and curious palate.\n\nCheers, and thanks again for renewing my Yelp badge. Let's go 2015!", "author": "Ryan M."}

Their atmosphere is intimate and comfortable to dine in. \n\nDinner menu consist entrees to order individually or opt in for the tasting menu (9 course). There was two sets of 9-course tasting and if two people choose each one, you get to try all eighteen dishes. I thought this was a great option. Other than the tasting menu, you can order entrees individually. I came with just ordering one entree but I enjoyed it much more with the tasting menu other than the big price difference.

My girlfriend and I had the chef's tasting menu and each dish was both delicious and unique in that it was something special you probably can't get anywhere else. Minor twists and attention to detail set the food here apart from other restaurants, but while everything was GOOD, only a handful of items on the tasting menu were truly GREAT. I enjoyed the meal and the experience, but my taste buds were not completely blown away for what I paid (~$500 for 2 people, including drinks and tip).\n\nWorthy to mention that the service here was excellent and borderline perfection the night we were there. Servers and waiters were attentive and informative, but never pushy, overbearing, or pretentious in any way.

We had the abalone too, which was quite flavorful, a nice dish.  However, we also had the himachi sashimi dish, which was just muddled with flavors, and the lobster in the lobster pot-pie was chewy, I guess undercooked.  I ordered the prime rib they had that night medium, it came out medium-rare and chewy as well.\n\nThe $20 a glass wines we ordered were filled only a third of the glass unfortunately too, we decided not to complain about that.  They did have the Hitachino Real Ginger beer though, that was a plus.  Just wasn't worth the $350 I paid for the entire meal, that's all I can really say about it, other than the server was trying to clean our table while we were still sitting there at the end, and her tone became rude when my girl's arm was in the way of her cleaning, her tip suffered for that, sorry.", "author": "Frank K."}

No matter what you're wearing, they will treat you with respect and the best possible service they can.  \n\nStarter- Ahi Tuna Tartare ($19): The presentation of this dish did not deceive. It was as mouth watering to look at as it is to taste. I thought it was pretty funny/cool when the server mixed the different ingredients (quail egg yolk, sesame oil, asian pear, mint, and pine nuts) for us, and ended it with a nice triangular design. If they put more asian pear into the dish, it would have been perfection. \n\nTHE NEGATIVE\n\nOur waitress was not very attentive. Had to flag her down for refills, our order, and even for our check. \n\nTrio of Schmitz Farm Lamb ($42): The saddle, sweetbread, and sausage part of a lamb, tasted nothing like my favorite meat as it was dry and lacked in flavor. \n\nAlaskan Halibut ($37): comes with crayfish, pickled ramps, wild mushrooms, and espelette. At first bite, this dish seemed fresh and satisfying, but a few more bites in, it was like everything was drowned in salt and msg \n\nBread ($0): Usually the best part of my meal, as it comes free. However this bread was too hard to crunch down on, and though the sauce it comes with is pretty good, its obsolete without some good bread to match.\n  \nJudging by past yelp reviews, this place is a hit or miss.

I would probably want to try some more of the other highly rated restaurants in SF before I returned here for another visit.\n\nI did appreciate that the food was not overshadowed by the setting like in some other restaurants.  To the contrary, the understated, unassuming ambiance was almost cozy despite the large dining area.\n\nThe crowd was a mix of couples obviously celebrating a special occasion (or men trying to impress their dates, haha), groups of foodies and the usual well-heeled suspects.\n\nService was good, but there was room for improvement.  The level of polish and professionalism with the servers was lacking given the type of establishment.  At moments, service was almost sloppy.  I think staff needs more training and management needs to run a tighter ship, adhering to strict standards that a restaurant like this needs and its patrons deserve.\n\nFortunately, however, everything I tasted from the Chef's tasting menu (which ends up being way too much food to finish) pleased my palate and was very visually appealing.  In some instances, I will say the food looked better than it tasted (but I am a big fan of exquisite food presentation as I find it adds to the sensory pleasure, while poor presentation definitely detracts).", "author": "Evelyn K."}

I'd like to think that 6 years of French is enough for me to know that it was real, but the food was good and the service was awesome, so he could have had a Chinese accent for all I cared, it was still a great dining experience.\n\nThis place looks like an upscale dining room, but is not sterile, feels more relaxed, has normal sound level, and the chairs are really comfortable. Good for dates, socializing, or business. \n\nDo the tasting menu (I know I say that for every review, but I really mean it this time). Not because it's the greatest tasting menu ever, but because the app/entree portions are so huge and priced as such that you'll end up paying about the same as the tasting menu ($125) for 2 apps, entree, and dessert, and may not be able to finish the mondo portions, so you may as well get double the variety for about the same price. And if your dining partners won't, (I was the only one who did it) you can ask them to double pace the meal so no one had to wait, and they did it flawlessly. Most upscale restaurants just flat out refuse to do this, so this was a plus. And don't worry, the tasting portions are _exactly_ right so that you are full but not exploding by the end. \n\nAmuse:\n   - Kunamoto Oyster - These are always great\n   - Grilled cheese and mushroom soup - Homey, hearty, delicious\nApps:\n   - 4-item app - Perfectly cooked scallop, OK wagyu and risotto ball, gross rubbery jellyfish\n   - Ahi Tartar - Average\n   - Squid Ink Conchiglie - Best part of the meal - complex, oceany, and uni -   always a good thing\n   - Shabu Shabu - Fun novelty but just tastes like earthy enoki and grass.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-30", "description": "***Michael Mina features a nice upscale lunch with a good amount of variety***\n\nThis is Michael Mina's relatively new San Francisco restaurant.  I have been to the Michael Mina (Bellagio) in Las Vegas and it was okay but a little underwhelming.  Several of the preparations seemed to be standard stuff and while the food was satisfying enough, it was not exciting or creative.\n\nThis Michael Mina (located in the Financial District) has a great decor.  It is located in a nice old building and features large and nearly floor-to-ceiling windows that let in a lot of natural light during lunchtime (it also allows guests to look onto a bustling SF street).  The room is made up of dark and light earth tones.  Ceilings are high and the seating is comfortable.  I liked the nice artwork as well as the great looking bar--a very long bar with a great mirror that looked very inviting.\n\nAt lunchtime, Michael Mina features either a 3-course or 4-course lunch option where you get the option to pick from quite a few first courses, second courses, entrees, and desserts.\n\nThe bread at Michael Mina was good--it was a good sourdough, which had a great crispy crust as well as a good flavor.\n\nI started with one of their signature items, which was ahi tuna tartare with habanero infused sesame oil, Asian pear, pine nuts, quail egg yolk, and toasts.  They mixed up the tartare table side and it was a generous portion for lunch.  It was also very tasty.\n\nThe ahi tuna was fresh and moist and the habanero provided a good heat to the tartare.  I liked the crunchy pine nuts as well as the lightly sweet Asian pear.  The toasts were standard stuff, but the bland toast kind of worked well with the spicy tartare.\n\nMy second course was very good.  It was cavatelli pasta with lamb sausage, bitter greens and pecorino cheese.  The cavatelli had a good flavor and a good texture/moisture (not dry or too doughy).  I really liked how they dressed the pasta.  The lamb sausage was moist and provided a good savoriness and meatiness to the dish.  The bitter greens were a good contrast.  The pecorino cheese was soft, creamy and provided a good salty flavor to the cavatelli.\n\nMy entree was good but not as good as the first two courses.  My entree consisted of steelhead trout with piperade broth, piment d'espelette, Penn Cove clams, and smoked onions.  I liked the trout.  The outside was crispy while the flesh was moist and even though it was cooked medium rare, it flaked very well.  I wish they would have left the skin on though.\n\nThe sides were good.  I really liked the crispy parsley as well as the tomato based broth.  The clams were just okay.  I think the dish could have used more contrasting flavors because only the fish and the tomato stood out; still, it was a good entree.\n\nMy dessert was just okay.  I liked the flan ice cream.  Even though the flan flavor did not really stand out, the ice cream still had a good sweet flavor; it was also dense and very creamy.\n\nThe other parts of the dessert included torn apart brown butter cake, which was dry.  The rum compressed bananas were okay, but I would have preferred bruleed bananas instead.  There was also crunchy candied cashews and very good cocoa nib.\n\nService was very good.  My server was very polite and pleasant (the whole staff was personable and welcoming).  The food came out at a good pace.\n\nPrices are not too bad since they serve a very upscale lunch.  Some of the lunch options that I did not order seem to veer a little more casual though.\n\nI enjoyed this Michael Mina much more than the one in Las Vegas.  The dishes seemed much more contemporary, vibrant and light.  I am not sure if I would come back to Michael Mina for dinner, but I would come back if I was near the Ferry Building and looking for a high quality upscale lunch with a good amount of variety.\n\nParking is hard to find in this area; street parking by meter is available on the street  that runs along the water (where the Ferry Building is).", "author": "Anthony N."}

It's pretty much in the heart of downtown near the financial district and when we arrived for our 8pm reservation street parking was easy to find. We arrived early so we sat at the bar to grab drinks while our table was being set up. I ordered the japanese whisky service. It was a whole show along with my drink. The bartender lite a strawberry with a blowtorch and let the aroma fill up the glass they were going to pour my whisky into. Apparently they marinate the strawberries with chocolate so the glass ended up smelling and tasting like chocolate and strawberry, when he poured the whiskey into the glass it tasted like chocolate strawberry whisky. It was a trip. They also give you that strawberry to eat along with your drink. So you eat, sip. It was pretty cool to have the bartender explain everything he did and what went into making that drink, it was pretty cool to see something other than just shaking your drink. Not very many places will offer something like that.\n\nAfter our drinks we were ushered over to our seat and waiting for me on the table was a birthday card from the management. That was very sweet and I really liked that bit of charm and personalization. Getting happy birthday greetings from all the staff made me feel like some sort of celebrity and I was loving it. We were given an extensive wine menu as well as food menus. We decided to order a half bottle of red and I got myself a glass of white. We ended up ordering the dueling tasting menus. So pretty much it was my tasting menu versus my girl's tasting menu. We tried each other's dishes and rated them to see who got the better course this round. We made a fun little game out of it.\n\nOur first course was a soft shell crab with a custard. I'm not quite sure how to describe it because almost all the dishes had 15 ingredients when the waiters came and described them to us it became overwhelming to keep track of it all. Next they brought out an amuse bouche, which was a fried shrimp with some sauce which was a nice little bite to keep us occupied between courses. \n\nThe next course they brought was sashimi and they freshly ground up some wasabi table-side which was nice to see. I've always liked table-side experiences. The fish was cut perfectly and it went great with that fresh wasabi. I got tuna and my girl got salmon sashimi and I liked hers better because I love salmon.\n\nNext course was cooked fish. I got a salmon this time and my girl got a white fish which I believe was halibit.  They've since changed the menu so I can't look back but I think I liked her fish better than my salmon. My salmon was soy glazed with radish and hers had a herb sauce which went perfectly. Both fish were cooked perfectly.\n\nNext course was lobster. I had a grilled lobster with some steak cubes and a blackberry sauce. My girl got a poached lobster with squid ink. Both were so decadent but I always like a good poached lobster so I had to choose my girl's plate over mine, however I liked my surf and turf idea for my course. Couldn't pick a clear cut favorite but they were both flavorful.\n\nNext course was birds. I believe she had a squab and I had duck. Bird dishes are usually forgettable for me personally because it takes a lot to make something special out of it. Both were gamey which I love but as far as the sauces I don't recall them being special.\n\nThe next course was beef. I got a steak and my girl got wagyu beef with Japanese sticky rice. My steak was good, an all american cut of beef which was tender, medium rare and amazing with the shaved truffles and sauce. However, I loved the wagyu. It is literally beef with the consistency of butter. It was so tender that my girlfriend didn't know if she liked it or not. Completely threw her off so she gave most of it to me. Big mistake because it's so freaking good.\n\nNext was desserts. They brought me a desert plate with a candle and took our picture together. One dessert was a sorbet with rice krispies. It was very fresh and a great way to end a meal. I'm not quite sure how to describe the next dessert but it was some sort of decadent chocolate circle with some ice cream or marscapone, something creamy and awesome. Came with a chocolate crumble as well. They ended with some petite fours of macarons, homemade chewy candy and a chocolate bark. It was nice to get little bites here and there especially after being so full.\n\nThe tasting menu is an experience and I suggest you take full advantage of it. Think around 2-3 hours for the whole experience. It was a lovely dinner  and a lot of the dishes had Asian influences so if that isn't really what you are looking for in a dining experience then I would go elsewhere for your special dinner. It's a good restaurant and it has more flair and elegance to it than mind blowing flavors. The food was excellent but nothing made me to want more. Just happy I got my money's worth.", "author": "Jeromy G."}

The beef dips in just for a few seconds, was just perfect. This was such a delicate dish and I love it!\n\n- Chestnut Crusted Venision Loin - Dirty girl shallot, Kale greens, huckelberry jus - tender, full flavor, medium rare just how my date preferred it. \n\n- Japanese inspired whole Dungeness crab: Ramen, tempura, and miso butter poached - this was the newest dish on Michael Mina menu in JAN this year. I'm so glad to try it out the second day it was on the menu! You can't get better than this 3 ways crab. The miso butter poached was my favorite of all 3, just melt in my mouth, sweet, and fresh!\n\n        Definitely let the sommelier pairs the wines for you, so worth it!

I figure I'd give them the benefit of the doubt on the Yelp 3-star \"A-OK\", since the food was good but the service, although impeccable felt rushed.\n\nThe decor is elegant, quite elegant.  **Back when it was nestled on the upper \"terrace\" within the famous Westin St. Francis hotel**  I couldn't help but get the feel as if I was having dinner at grand Central Station, knowing that passer-byers who walked through the halls of the hotel for their nightly reservation or gawking privileges, would constantly stare upwards in order to catch a glimpse of the infamous Mina restaurant.  Although the noise level was controlled I still felt as if this location served better as a work meeting place for client dinners and discussion.\n\nOnce again, the food was good, although not memorable.  I would be willing to give it another try at it's new location to see if my opinion could be redeemed.  The 2-star lack was based off of my dining experience.  I left the restaurant paying over $500 for 2 people and yet our dinner lasted barely over an hour.  That might seem like a long time for most but when you're paying that high-priced of a ticket I do not want to feel rushed.  As soon as my last bite was taken and the fork hit the plate it was swiped from underneath me and quickly whisked away, followed immediately after by another beautiful dish.  I think that dining out is an experience and every bite should be savored - not taken over by a quick second, third, fourth dish, until you've realized \"that's it!\" and call it a night.\n\nI'd recommend asking for a slower turn around service.  Let them know ahead of time you'd like to relax and take it slow.  I could've just had one bad experience, although after shelling out that much money I am not willing to go back to readily.\n\nCheck it out for yourselves and let me know what you think.", "author": "Kevin J."}

First time I went here it was for my boyfriend's birthday, 2nd time for the Farewell to Foie Gras Tasting Menu. I'd have to say some of my happiest memories come from this restaurant!!\n\nFirst time we came, we were lucky to be seated with Thomas and Michelle - amazing waitress and waiter. They made us feel very at home, were interesting and outgoing people and very friendly. My bf and I started off with toasted bread and I wasn't feeling too well that evening, but what I will say is that these two people were very hospitable to me. They gave me ginger ale, tea, told me where the nearest Walgreens was. I ate my duck the next day -- still amazing!!! \n\nThings to order for regular menu: Shabu shabu is IMPRESSIVE - quite a show and very tasty from start to finish. Hors D'Oeuvres were amazing and a deal!  (although foie gras cherry no longer sold....boo)\n\nWhile here for the Foie Gras tasting menu, my table of 4 was \"all in\" and they gave us complimentary cocktails for each of us!!! I was kinda surprised. It was very sweet of them to do it. Also, all of our cocktails seemed to match our personalities which was pretty amazing... (we aren't regulars, this was our 2nd time). Maybe because we brought 3 bottles of wine? Idk. \n\nEven throughout all the different courses of foie gras, what I appreciated was how I didn't get sick of Foie gras! With 7 courses, it's easy to be overwhelmed but I did not experience that at all. It was wonderful.  I'm hoping that foie gras will come back so they can continue this menu...\n\nHappiest place on earth, aside from Disneyland.", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

I'd probably give Michael Mina 3.5 stars.  We arrived to the restaurant on time and were seated promptly by the hostess.  The restaurant was dimly lit and intimate, but I was surprised at how loud it was.  It's not like people were talking loud, but there was definitely a lot of background noise.  Service was definitely attentive all around.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the tuna tartare and the softshell crab.  Presentation of the tuna tartare was lovely.  Comes out nicely presented and is mixed by the waitress to mesh all the flavors of the quail egg, pine nuts, and chili.  I think this was the best dish out of the entire meal.  Softshell crab was only okay for me, maybe its better when it's in a sushi roll?  I usually can gauge whether I love a restaurant based on their bread service (I heart carbs).  I was fairly disappointed.  They offer a slice of wheat/sourdough type of bread with a cheese/honey dipping sauce.  All around, I've had much better elsewhere.  For entrees, we ordered the king salmon and the rib eye.  The dishes were good, but it didn't really stack up to other 1 Michelin star restaurants I've been to in the Bay Area.  \n\nIn addition to ordering the dessert service, the restaurant was nice enough to bring out a Birthday treat for the birthday boy.  The dessert service is a cute concept, small bites of various desserts and textures.  \n\nAt least I can say I've tried Michael Mina, not sure if I'd make a special trip back especially with the other great restaurants in SF.", "author": "Michele L."}

Overpriced and mediocre at worst\n\nVery dark and sexy ambiance, no white table cloth so atmosphere was not stuffy or pretentious (but apparently they are changing this back to the old way to appeal to a different clientele)\n\nThe cuv\u00e9e Michael Mina cab was a surprising hit. Full bodied and delicious. The service was very attentive and great, but some of the servers were not accurately able to answer somewhat beyond basic questions of the food that was presented. At a michelin 1 star restaurant I'd expect the servers to know each step that went into making the dish that I am about to consume\n\nI had 3 dishes recommended to me by the waitresses, which seemed to be the more popular dishes:\n\nAhi Tuna Tartare-average \nThe ancho chili was a nice kick. I don't know why this isn't just called a crudo or something besides tartare. Tartare doesn't jump off the menu quite like crudo does, but tartare does appeal to a specific crowd, so I'll let this slide. Also, tuna with dark ingredients. I feel an old fashioned steak would have been much better complimented  the flavors. \n \nWhite truffle pasta-average\nYou start on 3rd base(white truffle) and this pasta still just cannot score a run. I've had unbelievable white truffle for twice as much, so this is average,considering it was half as good\n\nCrispy suckling pig-mediocre \nThe chicken, ahem pig skin was good. \n\nThe desserts were the best part of the meal. I was presented with a fall seasonal dish of pumpkin bread, a chocate mousse and butternut butter. This was the best thing I had all night, and one of my favorite desserts this year!\n\nIf the michelin system was expanded to include all of the U.S, I cannot see how a place like this would show up on any list. Michael Mina would have been great in a forgotten era where the old-money crowd would come to pay top dollar for mediocre food served on a white tablecloth, but this just no longer exists.

Overcooked rice with a watery sauce that could have simmered more.... it just didn't seem to go together.  \n\nBut I quickly forgot about that once the entrees arrived.\nOur group had the salmon and the soft shelled crab.\n\nThe salmon was outstanding.  Bathed in a \"tomato water\" with a hint of lime, it was gently seared and cooked to perfection.  And such a good cut of fish, I think I would have been just as happy to have it as sushi.  Amazing!  Little onions, a tiny tomato and small polenta cake lined the plate.  They weren't really side dishes so much as they were little bursts of flavor.  \n\nThe noodles and soft shelled crab were also good- rich broth and tasty crab.\n\nAnd then came the dessert sampler!  There were six different bites, and they came out three at a time.  Each one slightly more intense in flavor.

They don't even list prices on the menu.\n\nBefore I get to the food, I HAVE to talk about the service. Lunch here today was definitely one of the most comical dining experiences I've had in awhile. This place tries SO hard to provide the best service that you end up being waited on hand and foot to an unnecessary extent. \n\nThe hostess not only pulls your chair out for you, she takes your napkin and places it on your lap for you. If you need to excuse yourself from the table for any reason, a man quickly appears to grab the napkin off the table or chair and replace it with a new, perfectly folded one. I swear this man has super hearing powers, because as I got up to use the restroom, he was right there behind me to replace my napkin and smooth out the chair fabric. Yes, he smoothed out the fabric on the chair.\n\nAnd now the food:\nA bread man surveys the dining room at all times, ready to hand patrons pieces of bread anytime their side plate is empty. The bread is good, I ate a lot of it.\n\nLunch is prix fixe with three or four courses. My coworkers and I all ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartare, which they mix together and arrange into a triangle table-side. While this was cute at first, the novelty of having your dish arranged in front of you wears off after the 2nd or 3rd person at your table. Delicious! I chose not to eat it on top of their toast - it tasted better by itself to me.\n\nFor the entree I ordered the Arctic Char which was very tasty. My coworkers all ordered the \"Fish and Chips\", aka breaded fish and some sort of garbanzo bean...stick. One of them complained that it was dry, another said it was mushy. Apparently not the winning dish of the day. \n\nFinally, dessert: I ordered the Brown Butter Cake with Rum-Compressed Bananas, Ice Cream, and Cashews. Saying this was cake was a bit misleading since there were about 2 bites of cake-like substance, but the ice cream and bananas were great. My coworkers all ordered the Dark Chocolate Pudding Bar.

It's not the price (ok, that's not entirely true, it does pain me a bit to shell out a lot of money for something so fleeting), the main reason I avoid places like this is I turn picky eating into an art form. Thankfully, someone else chose this place for a work-related dinner function and I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised.\n\nBefore I get to the food, I must acknowledge the impeccable service at MM. From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, service was extremely friendly, attentive and unobtrusive. I didn't have the chance to want for anything, they were always one step ahead of me.\n\nWe had a quick drink at the bar while we waited for our table; this was the only real chance I had to drink in the restaurant's ambiance, the food and my dining companions held my attention the rest of the evening. The restaurant is modern, yet warm with rich earthy tones and warm lighting. Seated in a back corner, our table of 11 felt cozy, but not cramped.\n\nWe started with the hors d'oeuvres for the table; not eating steak or foie gras, I stuck with the seafood options (smoked trout croquette and crab tartlet). Of my entire MM experience, this was probably my least favorite course; not bad by any standard, but not exceptional either. \n\nNext, came our starters. Not being a huge fan of tuna tartare, I opted for the hamachi starter. While the hamachi plate was delicate and delicious, I had diner's remorse. My colleague was kind enough to give me a taste her tuna tartare and it was phenomenal. Each plate of tartare is brought to the table and assembled in front of the diner. Both of my tuna tartare experiences in SF have me rethinking my position on the dish. Learn from my mistake and get.this.dish!\n\nBefore our entrees arrived, we were given bread and what I originally assumed was honey butter. It was actually creamy ricotta with honey and it was amazing. This is going to sound weird, but when later asked what my favorite item of the night was, it was this spread. I find comfort in carbs and this paired with fresh, crusty bread was just orgasmic!\n\nFrom the moment I saw the menu online, I knew my entree would be the lobster pot pie. Had I been paying the bill, I would've balked at the price and struggled with spending so much on one dish, but it was worth every penny my host ponied up for it. This is a not your mother's pot pie; assembled in front of you, this is a deconstructed version of a pot pie. The flaky crust disc lies on the bottom with ample lobster, kale and all of the other goodness spread on top. Everyone at our table who ordered the lobster devoured theirs and later raved about it, everyone who did not looked a little jealous. Although, I will say I heard no complaints about their meals either. My only complaint is that my crust was rather hard and tough to cut, I pretty much gave up on it because being a habitual klutz, I saw it ending badly (spilled drinks, broken glass, airborne pastry).\n\nAfter all of that food and decadence, I would have been perfectly happy skipping dessert, but our gracious host ordered the dessert platter for the table. Fortunately, the dessert potions are small, tiny actually. I opted to stick with the jasmine and brown sugar wafers. Like a delicate little pirouline cookie, it was a subtle touch of sweetness to end my meal.\n\nDinner at Michael Mina was definitely one of the culinary high points of my visit. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend MM as a special occasion destination, just don't pass up the lobster pot pie.*\n\n*Unless you're allergic, then you get a pass.", "author": "Mary T."}

This may seem like a lot of food, but it's actually the perfect amount. Each course is no more than a couple of bites that is just enough without leaving you wanting more. Every course was beautifully plated and tasted absolutely divine. Divine is not a word I use commonly to describe things, but for Michael Mina there is no other word that is appropriate. With 10 courses, it's hard to recall and describe every single course. But some of the highlights were the Black Cod, Ayu with watermelon, Maine Lobster, and the Pork Confit. Dining at Michael Mina is an experience. The tasting menu was an experience in and of itself. The waiters presented everything together, explained the plate thoroughly, and promptly cleared your plate when you were done. The restaurant itself is dimly lit and has a wonderfully classy, quite, but buzzing atmosphere. I absolutely enjoyed my dining experience at Michael Mina, and would highly recommend for anyone looking for a remarkable dinner.", "author": "Carina R."}

We have been to many of his restaurants and he almost never disappoints.  On our last day in San Fran, we decided to try Mina's for an early dinner before our flight.  This was, I think, our first Mina experience... certainly was not our last (PS: See my Bourbon Steak Miami review).   \n\nEverything we had was excellent.  This was an exceptional dinner plus, everything goes well with Caymus, which I purchased at the restaurant for $145. I am pretty sure Mina's has a corkage fee if you don't want to spend $145 for a wine that retails for $65 but I must say I have seen Caymus in other restaurants being sold for $200+.  (PS: All Mina restaurants in Miami have corkage fees)  \n\nOverall a great night with exceptional service... a staple in most Mina restaurants we've been.", "author": "Lawrence P."}

Michael Mina you are a genius and I have Patsy Mullen to thank for my taste of your world. \n\nI love baking and cooking, and this place made me want to study every avenue of the menu and kitchen. The service was impeccable and well timed with our guests. The staff was attentive but took care of our tables in a way that made you feel like royalty, if only for a few hours (yes we were there a long time, felt like I was back in Australia where people wait a long time for a table just because the food and service is just that good).\n\nEverything from the Fire Bread (bought locally from Oakland) to my hot tea with 1 lump of sugar and a splash of warmed cream was enjoyable. Our lovely hostess was very informative when I asked what kind of bread we were eating because it was delicious and so fresh. I would definitely try this restaurant again.\n\nIf they ever open a restaurant in Washington DC area**, I'd be honored to work and learn from Mr. Mina. Maybe someday in the kitchen because I think that would truly be a fun career.\n\n**Edit corrections: After Googling Michael Mina in DC, I'm happy to say, there are a few restaurants I hope to try after my move is complete.", "author": "Lynda O."}

AND i pick MM.  darn it... so disappointing is to say the least.\ni kinda skimmed all the yelp reviews before going but I wanted to give all restaurants a chance and not completely hear out the reviews.\nDefinitely a nice layout.  It's large and very roomy and not a stuffy restaurant at all.\nIt is LOUD in there.  as they have a high ceiling, the sounds do travel thru-out the restaurant and you cannot have a complete nice quiet table to talk for a vday dinner.  I did ask on Open Table for a nice quiet table to enjoy our vday dinner and was given a table right by the bathroom.  the slamming of the bathroom doors was definitely not nice nor quiet.  \nService was just OK.  our bread was not brought out until about the 2nd course of something like that.  it was strange to keep looking at our bread plate to the left of me with nothing in it.\nI ordered a ginger ale and had to remind two ppl for it and by the time it came, it was flat, almost NO carbonation left in the glass.  \nAnd since i cannot pick what i wanted, we went for the Chef's Ketto menu.  was so looking fwd to getting an awesome 9 course meal!  OMFG 9 courses!!!  cant wait...i thought.\nso the 1st course came and he had something different than mine.  hmmm, ummm, WHY????  our table was not small so to share or to feed him or to give him my fork was not so cute!  i had to completely reach over the table to hand over my fork to him so he can taste what my course was.  I'm not a TALL person as is so it was quite uncomfy and so NOT romantic.  Apparently, each course, MM wants you to share.  ahhh, i get it.  very nice concept but what if you do not go with your significant others but go with a few other friends.  UMMM, i really dont want to taste their food if they already tasted it.  \nwe did not do the wine pairing and just ordered a glass of MM ONLY pinot noir on the menu.  but towards the end, i should have ordered the wine pairing.  maybe it would have help the taste of the food.\nthe oyster starter had such a fishy smell to it that when it was in front of me, i can smell it.  i definitely had to use all the fancy sauces to help mask the smell.  I could not send it back as it was already in my mouth and it was too fancy to try to spit it out on my napkin.  the caviar was definitely on point though.  \nmy soup had a fish bone in the fish.  sigh.  fancy dinner and here i am pulling out a 1\" bone out of my mouth. that was just my second scoop of soup.  had to point it out to the waitress and she took it all away.  \nThe Sashimi dishes were perfect though!\nthen we were served the lobster items.  lobster = my mouth loves me...USUALLY. but again, it was so fishy that i could not even finish the bite I cut up.  mind you, the amount that was served is not a full lobster tail size so about 3 bites and you are done.  I was only able to eat one bite of it.  so upset.  Also had to send it back.\nthe squab piece is so gamy.  to each her own on the taste of squad but I can eat gamy food but i dont this is not helping my pallet after the oyster and then the lobster unfriendly tastes in my mouth.\nthe steak was terrific as well.  \nwe were served extra dessert but didnt know why until we got our bill and was told that they comp'd our glasses of wine and did extra dessert for us to make up for it.  I would have appreciated it more if that was told to us before we finished everything.  we would have appreciated the service more in that sense.\nso sorry to say this but we will definitely not come back and will try other restaurants in SF", "author": "Ann N."}

I wanted a quaint, intimate setting and I knew this was the place for it. I often walked by between my usual dining options, but never found the menu to be enticing. I took a chance anyway.\n\nI seated myself at the bar and was immediately greeted by two gentlemen and a lassie. Three menus: bar, dinner, and a book with the wine list-- options, options, options! The chef's tasting menu was recommended, so I went for it.\n\nHere is how I knew that the evening was set: they asked me about my food allergies (I have none). When do restaurants ever ask about allergens? Never. Why? Because the menus always state that YOU are supposed to be the one to ask for accommodations. I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nOrdering the chef's tasting menu had me a tad bit worried. Would I make it out of the restaurant with a happy and full belly? FYI, I have ended up paying upscale pricing for a half-full tummy before.. It's no fun. Boy, was I crazy.. I believe there were ~8 courses, only 4 which I made it through. It was scrumptious to no end, but more than enough food. Demasiado para mi. Yes, the portion are small, but the food is incredibly rich and savory. After two hours, I was too full to finish and too woozy to appreciate artistic foods\n\nAfter my 4th course, I was morbidly stuffed. One of the nice men working at the bar (the drinks made me forget his name) came over and said, \"They caught your lobster! They're gonna start cooking it right now!\" A big \"HUH??\" came out of me. Caught my lobster?!?! The lobster pot pie actually wasn't part of the chef's tasting menu, but I had it swapped for the duck with foie gras (ew). \"Yes, they had to drive up to Fisherman's Wharf to catch one. That's why it's been taking so long!\" I was in shock.. They caught a lobster just for me? And now I won't even be able to enjoy it? Supersadface.\n\nThe gentlemen were both very attentive and knowledgeable. One for drinks, the other for food (: Who can make a cocktail that I call yummy? Not many.\n\nAlthough my tummy couldn't hold anymore, I wanted to make it expand.. It didn't work, so I promised them I'd return for more food and dessert sampling. Unfortunately, I've been beyond preoccupied. Still, it's on the top of the mark!\n\nMichael Mina is a sweet delicacy, a delightful sensation waiting to happen. Seriously. Come! Have a drink (or three) and a few appetizers, maybe even lobster pot pie. You won't ever leave.\n\nDon't even get me started on their bread with honey ricotta spread.

To be honest, we didn't know what we really wanted.. some appetizers and entrees or the full tasting with wine pairings.\n\nWe ended up going with the Chef's 'Ketto' tasting menu and wine pairings. Our server was great! She definitely convinced us of the tasting, which was \"dueling\" themed, so essentially you get 18 or so courses between the two, as well as 18 different wine pairings. The idea behind the dueling menu can be summed up as contrasting/two ways. For example, I had a buttery rich lobster while he had more of an Asian style lobster with a lighter broth.\n\nOne thing that we didn't like was the A5 Wagyu Kobe. There was too much sauce compared to the one we had at Chez TJ. I don't recall why it was served this way (instead of on a slab with sea salt) but the sauce overwhelmed the meat :( It was just a disappointment.\n\nThere are so many different variations and the tasting menu changes daily (or weekly) so you can't judge it on the dishes. \n\nThe overall experience was very pleasant and we would definitely return!! Below is a rough opinion of how I feel MM compares to other Michelin restaurants.\n\nBetter than: Chez TJ, Jardinerie, Baume, Sons & Daughters, Plumed Horse, Luce, Bouchon, Ame, Acquellero\n\nTied with: Masa's (now closed), Benu, Coi, La Folie, Quince\n\nNot as great as: The FL.", "author": "Mia N."}

It exceeded my expectations on almost every level.  We came here on a whim the week before foie was banned on a wednesday night.  we walked right in and sat at the bar.\n\nThe bartenders here are very nice and friendly.  They made us feel very welcome from the get go.  Their cocktails are pricey but i feel they are worth it.  The bartenders really know what they are doing.  The cocktails were inventive and complex.  They make them right in front of you and you can see all of the work that went into them.  I think in total we each had 3 or 4 drinks.  My friend knew one of the bartenders and he made us all this really unique and delicious digestif.  I honestly dont remember what was in it, but i think it had a chocolate or a coffee base.  I really like that you can order a drink off the menu that is basically up to the bartender.  You tell them what you like, and they ask you a bunch of questions as to your preference and then, voila, a delicious cocktail appears before you.\n\nNow onto the food:\n\nThroughout the meal they bring you several complimentary amuse bouche.  First was the mini grilled cheese with english pea soup.  delish!  Throughout the meal they bring you a piece of bread with this honey and mascarpone dip that was heavenly.  I could have taken a bath in that stuff.  For dessert they brought out a little thing in an egg shape device.  I believe it had cherries amongst other things, and it had this little tarragon wafer thing in it that brought everything together.\n\nJordan almond crusted Fois gras was amazing.  Had some marmalade, brioche and i think some pepper cress or something like that.  The fois was cooked perfectly.  \n\nThe shabu shabu was very good but it was my least favorite of things i ate.  It had some wagyu, some foie, some beech mushrooms and some veggies.  the broth was good and i liked how they served you the broth afterwards with all the flavors from the dippings.\n\nThe duck breast with foie....so delicious.  the foie was great and the duck breast was cooked perfectly.  the skin was nice and crispy and the fat was properly rendered.  it had pear and miso sauces and this duck filled dumpling in this dashi that was just about the most delicious thing ever.\n\nLobster corn dogs - excellent bar food!\n\nWe had one other dish too.....i waited too long to write the review.  Bad yelper!  Bad yelper!  Sorry about that.  I can assure you that we all LOVED it though.\n\nThe best thing about this experience was that we all got out of there shelling out only about $85/ea.

For a drink and a 3-course tasting menu, be prepared to spend about $155 per person after tax and tip.\n\nThe food is wonderful.  Conception, execution, presentation...  all designed to give the diner a complex and pleasure-filled meal.  I don't think the menu items are particularly edgy or push the envelope, but it's all well thought out.  And their drink list is extensive (wines, bourbons, cocktails...).\n\nThe night that we went, there were different options on the 3-course menu including the items that we ordered below:\n\nFirst Course:\n* Scallops (3 ways), one with an arugula pesto that stood out.\n* Sashimi sampler, which also came with freshly grated real wasabi and creative dabs of various sauces and things like soy salt powder.\n\nSecond Course:\n* Taste of the sea:  (a) delicate and juicy halibut, (b) trout with uni and smoked root vegetables, (c) black cod with \"leche de tigre\" which was basically the jellified juice from a ceviche preparation.\n* Birds:  (a) duck breast, very rare, with an earthy and sweet sauce, (b) a quail dish which was surprisingly juicy and flavorful, (c) squab served with seared foie gras.  Yum.\n\nThird Course:\n* We both ordered the \"dessert\" option instead of the cheese plate.  It came with: (a) beignet and a caramel dipping sauce, (b) an awesome little cup of mousse with a citrusy (yuzu?) component to it, and (c) a chocolate ice cream and praline combination.\n\nThere were also some amusee bouche items that were interesting, including a blue fin tuna tartare bite served over a creamy sauce.  Also bread to dip in honey and marscapone.  And dessert also included pear gelee squares, a shortbread cookie, and a caramel.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed the experience a lot.  It's definitely more of a special occasion type of place (unless you have so much money that money isn't really much of a consideration--in which case your special occasion could be \"Fridays\").", "author": "Jeff L."}

Both  were light and fresh, and I truly LOVED the hamachi dish, (it was my favorite part of the meal.) \n\nWe also shared the corn souffle, it was good, but not amazing. \n\nFor entrees, I chose the \"wild alaskan halibut with ginger-carrot broth, steamed dumplings, and snow peas.\" \nI was looking forward to this dish, and it was a bit of a disappointment.

Every single person on staff that we encountered that evening was charming and friendly. Upon entering through those doors we were greeted by three people up front. After checking for our reservation the host lead us to a nice seat right beside the front window of the restaurant which was a pleasant surprise. One of the things I dislike about restaurants that are in high demand is that they tend to squeeze in as many tables and seats to accommodate such. But we were spaced apart just enough to feel we were at our own table and not crashing another couple's dinner. The noise level wasn't too bad either. We were able to have a nice conversation throughout dinner just fine. \n\nMind you this restaurant wasn't the most vegetarian friendly but this dinner was to celebrate my husbands birthday so my needs weren't the priority when it came down to selecting the restaurant. And with a restaurant of this caliber (hello, Restaurant of the Year!) I wasn't about to ask to do any substitutions. I made do that evening. \n\nWe started off with a glass of wine each (Sauvignon Blanc for me) and were given a bite sized grilled cheese and a shot of tomato soup as the amuse bouche. A grilled slice of bread served with a great creamy spread and honey arrived for us prior to our main dish.\n\nWe had the following:\n-Heirloom tomato and burrata\n-Cherry blossom cured hamachi \n-Crispy skin dorade\n-Brandt Farms NY strip\n\nFor starters we wanted to share the Hors d'oeuvres which includes gras PB&J, smoked trout croquette, steak tartare and crab tartlet but decided to forgo it since we really wanted to save room for dessert. In celebration of the 20th Anniversary they offered a Chef's Dessert Service. We both decided to order our own. It was started off with a small \"root beer float\". Then each mini-desserts came out in \"courses\". It was astounding and the perfect cap to the dinner we had.\n\nTowards the end of dinner they asked if we needed a cab which we politely declined.

It's not often I get to spend time with my 10-year-old daughter given my work schedule. I had an opportunity to spend the weekend in San Francisco with her and made a reservation at Michael Mina's. Forget about the food. In my opinion, it's always spot on. The consistency from restaurant to restaurant is amazing. I don't understand how they do it but they've got that part of the business figured out. The reason I'm writing this review is because of the service. They were astute enough to realize that it was probably a special occasion that found a father and his 10-year-old daughter at their establishment. Bryan, the Captain, made sure my daughter's every whim was met and then some. Not seeing anything on the menu that caught her fancy (being a 10 year old), Bryan asked her what she felt like.  Butter pasta, she exclaimed!  Done, said Bryan as he handed her his business card!  If there was ever a Hall of Fame butter pasta, this was it! I almost canceled my lobster pot pie and ordered what my daughter was eating!  Giovanni, the General Manager, also stopped by and made sure my daughter felt like she owned the joint!  The rest of the staff was unbelievably attentive but not overbearing. Just when I thought I needed something, they were there to fulfill our needs.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-25", "description": "Honestly, I think Michael Mina is probably the best food I've had in San Francisco to date. The first time I ate there, it was at the \"Farewell to Foi\" dinner with a bunch of friends, just before the foi gras ban was about to go into effect. The dinner was a 9 course pre fixe where every course incorporated foi gras in some way. I am not generally a huge fan of foi, but HOLY SHIT. Every course was mind-blowing. The third course, the freshest pan-seared scallop I've ever had with a foi gras mousse, actually made me weep. I was pretty sure at that point that I was ruined for food forever.\n\nWe went again last night with my boyfriend's parents because we thought they would appreciate both the food and the excellent wine list, & I was once again rendered speechless by everything we had. \n\nThere are two pre fixe menus typically -- the nine course \"Kettle\" menu for $160 (given how fish-heavy this menu is, I am assuming it's there mainly for Japanese businessmen with an expense account), & a six-course option for $130 where the chef basically does whatever he wants with some input from the table (ie we requested abalone, lobster, & not a lot of garlic). The six course was absolutely the way to go--just the right amount of food, and everything was spectacular.\n\n(There was duck. I never order duck because I've never been all that impressed by it, but it was hands down the best dish of the night. I'd eat duck at every meal if it tasted like that.)\n\nWhile the wine menu absolutely includes a bunch of big-name, super-marked up bottles for those who don't know much about wine but want to impress people, it also includes a ton of gems if you know what you're looking for. We found a bunch of spectacular bottles that were barely marked up at all, including an 8 year old German riesling and an amazing French syrah (oldest red on the menu for under $60), and the som also recommended a fantastic French white that was barely marked up & went with several of our courses perfectly.\n\nA splurge, obviously, but absolutely worth it in every way.", "author": "Angela B."}

The 4 small lobster corndogs were quite delicious and was even great without the mustard aioli.  \n\nLike a previous poster mentioned, there was a card waiting for us at our corner table wishing us a happy anniversary which was a nice touch.  The service was impeccable throughout the entire evening from the refreshed napkin when you got up to the new honey pepper ricotta complement with each piece of bread.  They must've known it was good enough to eat with just a spoon.  \n\nThe amuse bouche of tomato soup and \"grilled cheese\" point was delicious together and a great start.  The summer melon and grilled fig starter was light and refreshing while the prosciutto made this a sweet and savory dish.  \n\nThe duo of salmon came with a piece of foie gras on top of each piece that just melts in your mouth while the pork was moist and tender.  I was not a big fan of the bitter mustard greens but overall, a very tantalizing meal for the taste buds.  \n\nWe were a bit full after our meal especially since we started early with the appetizers at the lounge so we had to pass on dessert.  The chef sent over a small sweet ending to our meal of a sliver of chocolate mousse cake with a dollop of ice cream for our anniversary and a small shot glass of watermelon/cucumber mixed with another dollop of cream.  \n\nGreat service and food makes this one a winner.", "author": "Joyce Z."}

I really liked my Shady in the Lady drink, which had little dots of some liquid floating on the surface -- interesting how they made art out of my cocktail!\n\nWhile glancing at the menu, we opted for the 9-course chef's tasting menu. In hindsight, we should have just gone with the 6-course (although it's fixed, so you don't know what comes out and both people get the same items). The 9-course menu items were listed on the second page of the menu and it's a dueling menu, meaning both people each get a different item for each course. This makes for an interesting meal since you can taste 18 different items! We started off with a slice of bread and honey butter, then a complimentary starter from the chef. After the main courses, there was a table-side green tea (matcha) service + complimentary bite from the pastry chef and a palate cleanser, followed by 3 courses of dessert. I'm not sure why we got the third...another complimentary dessert, haha. Counting all the food we had, it was really a 13-course meal. Oof!

They are quick to take away your dish after you finish a course and are very attentive to your needs no matter how busy they are (water/drink level, bread crumbs on the table, etc). \n\nMy bf and I decided on different things so that we could have a better variety and try more. We started out with the ahi tuna tartare, which they mixed for me with quail egg yolk, habanero infused sesame oil, Asian pear, and pine nuts. It was really delicious - I crave it randomly now sometimes. It had a great aroma from the sesame oil and had a good balance of tastes, not too heavy or light. It came with toast, which by itself would not have been very yummy, but with the tuna tartare was perfect. We also tried the local dungeness crab salad, with yuzu aioli, radish, and grilled baby romaine lettuce. What blew our minds away was not the crab, but the grilled lettuce. It tasted surprisingly amazing. My bf rarely eats veggies, but when he tried this, he allowed me to try one bite and gobbled the rest down! It was a small piece of lettuce, but bursting with flavor.\n\nThe bf also got a sparking lime drink, which I ended up drinking since I like citrus flavors a lot. I thought it was really good! Refreshing and light, perfect to balance out the whole meal. \n\nFor our second course we got the carnaroli risotto and the hand rolled cavatelli pasta. I tried the pasta first, but I don't really like lamb, so traded for the risotto right away. The pasta was very strong in cheese and lamb flavor; good for those who like lamb. The risotto was delish!! The baby sweet peas really made everything come together. \n\nI feel like the further in we went into our 4 course meal, the less I liked the food. For me, the entrees weren't amazing and the selection was not that great. We got the alaskan halibut 'fish and chips' and the black angus ny strip steak. I didn't like my fish and chips, I picked around at it and gave the rest to my bf. He liked his steak though -- I tried a piece and thought it was good, but not amazing. \n\nI became very excited for our last course because I'm a big dessert person. We ordered the dark chocolate pudding bar and the gabietou sheep/cow's milk cheese. Let's just say dessert is not their forte, and hopefully they improve on it in the future. I regret making my bf try the cheese dish, since he actually wanted strawberry cheesecake (hehe). The cheese was so pungent that we barely ate any of it. The chocolate pudding was only average at best. We asked them to clear our table after barely touching the desserts. :( \n\nOverall, you get a decent amount of food with the 3 or 4 course lunches. Service is great and the atmosphere really promotes the special occasion feel. With a little more creativity in their entrees and some better quality desserts, this would be one of my favorites for a slightly fancier meal.", "author": "Rose Y."}

The lobster was well prepared but the pasta dough (ravioli) was tough/too thick and dish was cold lacking acid and salt.

So, on a Saturday evening around 8PM, we walked in to this modern, busy restaurant in the middle of the financial district.

We didn't have to wait to be seated, but there are many patrons waiting by the bar.  Although I was not impressed with the Pollination cocktail, I was in love with their food....or should I just say Lobster Pot Pie!\n\nAPPETIZER: Tuna Tartare is Michael Mina's signature dish, and the fish is incredibly fresh with the perfect mixture of garnishes.  The complimentary cute cup of cream soup went perfectly with the mini grilled cheese toast.\n\nENTREE:  We ordered a fish covered with bacon which you sounds better on the menu than it tasted.  You can tell it wasn't that great since the name has already escaped me.  The fish was tender but there was a fishy taste to it, and the bacon is soft and chewy.  The brussel sprouts that came along the dish was well-seasoned, and I enjoyed that.  \nHowever, the main event is the LOBSTER POT PIE!  Now, this is not your mom's normal pot pie.  In fact, the only reason that it's called that is probably due to the lobster being brought to the table in a pot of tasty lobster bisque.  The waitress then serves the succulent lobster on top of the rectangular pastry and drizzles the creamy sauce on top.  I didn't care for the pastry that much as it got a bit hard to eat without the cream sauce.   Nevertheless, I love shellfish, and this lobster is truly amazing.  I usually like lobsters prepared with scallions and garlic (like at the Newport Seafood Restaurant on Las Tunas Dr. in San Gabriel...in LA), but the French style was delicious and different from the typical lemon/butter served at other eateries.\n\nDESSERT: Complimentary lemon meringue was nothing special.  We got a free chocolate birthday cake, but I thought the one from the Omni was better!\n\nOverall, go for the tuna tartare and lobster pot pie.  I am interested to try the beef for 2 next time.  The price is high, but you do get a memorable meal if you know what to order!  The ambiance is not as romantic as the concierge had said, but it is a happening restaurant with great lobster so that's the trade-off.", "author": "Lina C."}

It was fun. \n\nMy favorite dish was the lobster and tortini.\nMy girlfriend loved duck.

The wines were paired marvelously with each dish (and the sommelier did a wonderful on the spot change up for each of my dishes as well!) \n\nFor the first time in my life, I tried Quail. It was the softest, most decadent and perfectly cooked meat I've ever had!

I am not a fan after the meal but the service is certainly more than 5 stars - 4 people literally go around the clock serving us for 2.5 hours that we were there, it is actually embarrassed to be served so attentively, they always lowered themselves when serving, clean the table to every last piece after each serve, explain every dish like a chef (we were confused that the chef might have come by as well).

From the start to finish, this place rocks! \n\nWe started with a complimentary shot of I don't know what (tasted like it was made with beans or lentils) with a small grilled cheese sandwich that was delicious. That was followed by freshly baked bread that came with a spread made of a couple types of cheeses and honey. OMFG!! This is what I expect unicorn shit to taste like. It was so good, we had to ask for more bread to put it on. Even my friend who was trying to go gluten free couldn't resist.\n\nFor my starter, I ordered the Trio of Sashimi. It tasted fresh and was prepared beautifully. I forgot I was not in a Sushi restaurant for a minute. As good as it was, it was a little unfair that it had to follow the bread and spread because that was still on my mind.\n\nFor the entree I ordered the Black Angus Rib Eye. When the waitress first put it on my table, I was initially disappointed because the portions looked so small against a plate the size of a TV. But the steak was prepared perfectly. It was not too well done, not too rare. I savored each bite as it was my last meal. In the end, the portions were the appropriate size since I was already feeling a little full.\n\nThe best part of the meal had to be the dessert. We shared the chef's desert service which at $16 was a tremendous bargain. We got 6 different desserts that were all fantastic. If I had to pick my favorite, it would be the Douglas Fir ice cream.\n\nOur waitress and the other staff were excellent.

(bourbon, apple, molasses and ginger beer.)\n\n\n\nAppetizers:\n* tasting of provincial shellfish (FANTASTIC!!!! It came with a side of UNI TOAST. For all uni fanatics and bread freaks, you MUST try this. The uni was fresh and sweet and the bread was super tasty....Aqua always had some of the best bread around)\n\n* pork belly & geoduck clam salad (sister liked very much; she said the pork belly was excellent.)\n\n* kabocha squash souffle with black truffle cream (I LOVED this!!!! That might be because I am obsessed with all things kabocha squash. In fact, it wasn't as souffle-ish as I had imagined, it was more mashed up. It was really delicious with the black truffle cream.)\n\n* complimentary grilled cheese + Italian bean chorizo soup (it was whatevers)\n\n\nEntrees:\n* truffle-stuffed shelton farms chicken (foie gras rice was a little too salty. I didn't think this was that special. The chicken, however, was very very very succulent and tender.)\n* duo of crispy fish (I did not try, but from my sister's reaction, it was good but nothing spectacular or praiseworthy.) \n\nDessert:\n* the only option they offered - tasting menu ($15 per person), which consisted of ...\n1. vanilla sorbet with apple and crust crumbs (meh)\n2. egg roll-like wafers filled with white chocolate jasmine cream (the cream was yummy)\n3. white chocolate orange crisps (meh)\n4. honey chocolate cakes with chocolate ganache (wayyyy too sticky...)\n5. chocolate brownie cake (probably the best one out of all of the desserts.

The blend of impeccable service (warm and attentive servers and bartenders), and phenomenal food, this is my favorite fine dining experience in recent memory.  At $95pp, the 4 course tasting is actually a great deal.  The portions are generous but not obscenely large, so you can actually make it through 4 courses without hating yourself (and your pants) at the end.\n\nI was blown away before the appetizers even arrived.  The amuse trio included a miniature slow-roasted pork empanada, hearts of palm panna cotta, and a seared sliver of steak over polenta.  Typically, the amuse bores me or it just tends to not taste great.  Many restaurants in the bay try way too hard to be creative and end up making something that just is not palatable.  I loved the approach of Michael Mina in these very substantially-flavored bites.  All three were marvelous.  \n\nTHE BREAD.  The bread is reminiscent of Tartine's country bread, but it's every so slightly warmed/toasted to perfection.  It's served with a mascarpone and ricotta cheese spread topped with honey and sea salt.  I coulld've just paid $95 to eat their bread all night (brilliant business plan).  It was that good.  \n\nThe actual courses were lovely.  I had the suckling pig pork chops (good, but not AMAZING.  I think I was more fascinated with how itty bitty the ribs were...adorbs).  My sisters had the abalone appetizer, which was so, so flavorful!  I had the black truffle risotto for the 2nd course and it was very rich and heavy on the truffle.  The menu mentioned snow crab in the ingredients, but i didn't taste it at all.  I think the truffle may have overpowered it (which is fine - it still tasted great).  The duck breast was done very, very well.  I would say it is probably one of the better duck dishes I've had in the city.  The skin was crispy and the meat was very juicy.  The dessert was a yuzu praline tiny thing which was good, but I honestly liked the house-made salted caramels even more than the dessert!\n\nOverall, the bread, amuse, and abalone really won me over.

Husband and I made a reservation here and we had the seven course pre fix meal with a bottle of Cabernet and two cocktails! One cocktail was free because of the app called Thanx! Which you also get points for towards rewards earned for any of his restaurants. The first part of the course was a great starter and app the 2nd and third course made me even more hungry as their portions are very minimal and very modern cuisine. Tasty yet small increments. Courses 4-6 were main dishes and sides with historical meaning per the servers. The ending for the dessert was amazing along with a surprise side item from the chef that night! We also had the infamous Lobster pot pie in which they deconstructed in front of us as we savor the pot pie with its vegetables and yummy pie crust! The dinner overall was delicious and Tasty not entirely sure why the price was little over but hey make up for it In customer service and relaxing vibes to set the mood for a romantic getaway.", "author": "K P."}

Upon entering, I asked the hostess, Felicia, how I should order as a vegetarian (they offer vegetarian, vegan and gluten free options upon request). Not only did she offer advice, but she then went out of her way to inform our servers of my eating habits to ensure that my needs were fulfilled (they were exceeded). Our server, Grant, was attentive, informative, kind and simply a pleasure to speak with. Josiah, our sommelier, offered relevant wine information and valuable suggestions in a personable, but yet professional, manner. The food is amazing, naturally, but the dedication that went into the presentation was a delightful addition. The sophisticated ambiance is surprisingly void of ostentatious decor and exudes warmth.\n\nUltimately, I would say that Michael Mina is an excellent place to host a professional dinner and will undoubtedly leave prospective partners with a superb impression.", "author": "Giana C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-04", "description": "Michael Mina is a restaurant my dad thinks is a pretty solid restaurant. I can't disagree. Everything we had, including the service, was pretty top notch. There were some quibbles but nothing that would stop me from recommending this restaurant.\n\nThe interior is subdued yet dramatic. The color scheme is like \"masculine beige\". The biggest adornment would have to be the two gigantic framed mirrors. Just how much did these cost? The also have a bronze-cast scaffolding sculpture at the entrance that acts like a divider. Nothing is overly dramatic, yet this hushed Gotham city style brings together an atmosphere that feels slick and polished while still being adult.\n\nThe menus are made out of wood backing with a piece of paper that is affixed by a magnet. Like anyone would, you try to take apart the menu to see if it's really a magnet. Then you accidentally bang the wood against the table creating a really loud ::WHACK::. And when you reattach the magnet it makes a loud ::CLACK::.\n\nThe amuse bouche was a small crustless grilled cheese sandwich with a mushroom soup. Usually amuse bouche dishes don't impress me but this definitely raised my expectations. I could have eaten three of the grilled cheese sandwiches.\n\nI'm not going to go through each dish that we had. All the appetizers we had were great. The one misstep was definitely the suckling pig. It was dry and could've been helped by more sauce on the plate. Everyone was disappointed by this dish because when you hear \"suckling pig\" you cannot wait to have it. Everything raw was done well.\n\nThe entrees next up were all executed just as well. It was pretty damn flawless. I had the duck and it  exceeded my expectations. Easily one of the better duck dishes I've had. The size of the plates are huge but the actual food portions are decently sized. If you're plenty hungry you can fill up on their awesome toasted bread with honey butter spread. You get to have as much bread as you want. I unfortunately had three slices and was so full afterward.\n\nThe dessert sounded good on paper; however, this was by far the most disappointing part of the meal. My family is huge into desserts and we usually devour the dessert course. While each component on its own was good, it was missing something. Each artfully constructed small portioned plate of dessert had the same \"line down the plate\" composition. I've easily had better dessert at other restaurants. The end of the meal was concluded with a dessert freebie. It wasn't as good as it looked. We did appreciate them bringing out a free slice of cake for my dad's birthday. The complementary to-go chocolate ganache macaroons they give you are divine (they almost made up for the lackluster desserts).\n\nNear the end of the meal, Michael MIna came around to greet each table. This was a nice touch especially seeing that he has 14 restaurants. He said that his ten year old son was helping out with desserts. Michael Mina is very friendly.\n\nService is quite good. They'll be sure your glass is  always full, you have enough bread, and your dishes arrive on time. The one baffling detail would have to be the napkin service. While I'm used to high end restaurants taking your napkin or folding it when you leave your seat, generally they're supposed to return the napkin when you return. But when someone returned to the table a new napkin didn't arrive. So you'll be eating at a restaurant with an incredible attention to detail -- without a napkin. This one really unusual detail will stand out if you do everything else right.\n\n____\n\nGreat restaurant. I think the food might be better than Gary Danko. Pass on the desserts. Get the duck. Load up on the bread. And just where did my napkin go?\n\nNOTE: Kinda loud. Not exactly a romantic place. The soundtrack is more of a loud dull dance beat.", "author": "Michael H."}

As for his Prix Fix dinner ($195.00 ++)  I was excited to experience one of the best culinary events of my life.  Sadly - it was not even close.  \n\nPortions were extremely small, lacked taste or complexity, pre-made lack luster dishes, dishes returned for cooking, spilled wine while pouring and a dessert (which appeared to come from Panera bread).  I left wanting.  We had a reservation for the last seating, which left us 4 hours to enjoy our dinner.  We were out of there in no time... really?\n\nThe atmosphere was not at all that exciting.  The energy that did exist, came from the numerous waiters scurrying about their tables.  I never saw food come out of kitchen so fast (hence the look, feeling and belief that these were all premade dishes).\n\nI should have gone to Gary Danko.  I yearn for their food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-28", "description": "I wish I could give this place five stars. If we could break down stars on yelp here's what I do:\n\nFood 10 stars\n\nAmbience 5  stars\nNoise level 4 stars\nAttention to detail 5 stars\nOur wait person  2 stars\n\nAfter investigating several high-end restaurants in San Francisco for a special occasion, we ruled out several for various reasons. The Progress offered a tasting menu, but both my partner and I would have had to have chosen the same six items and as we have  opposite tastes in food one of us would've felt  unhappy afterwards. Frances had no reservations till the end of March, and we didn't want to chance a walk-in. Rich Table focused way too much on seafood and foam, which Jardiniere did as well. This went on until I remembered Michael Mina, and when I looked up his main restaurant, I saw that one of our favorite chefs in the world, Ron Siegel, the only American to win original Iron Chef was now the chef, that sealed the deal.\n\nI heard the restaurant was quite noisy, and I must say if it'd been jampacked, the noise might've been intrusive but as it was early on a Friday night the din from the bar was not a problem.\n\nUpon our arrival we were seated  quickly and the GM came to introduce himself and welcome us to the restaurant. I wish the server had been as attentive as well. My only down rating has to do with the fact that our server seem much more interested in attending to customers around us who'd she'd paid in some way as highrollers who might leave a big tip. And that's the dilemma for a server, right? this is obviously a special occasion for my partner and I - were not going to be regulars anytime soon - so she figured we probably wouldn't know enough to tip well. And so we get mediocre service, which influences our tip. If she hadn't been so obsequious to all the tables around us, attending to their every whim, while relatively ignoring us, the difference might not have been as obvious. and the service wasn't poor- it just wasn't on the scale I expected from a restaurant like this. But every single other employee of the restaurant went out of their way to be gracious and attentive, and even the GM came by several times to speak with us and talk about the meal and the chef.\n\nAnd the food definitely made up for whatever the service lacked. We did the basic four course menu, with glasses of the house champagne, a TARTOGNE-TAILLET CUV\u00c9E MICHAEL MINA BRUT, CHAMPAGNE, FRANCE and moved on to individual glasses of wine, as I like white and my partner likes red.\n\nThe amuse-bouche was a mini mushroom empanada coupled with a thimble full of avocado mousse and a tiny sliver of bacon on a radish. Impeccable.\n\nIf you've seen their menu, you'll know that it's equally mixed between salads, first courses main dish and dessert. I chose a composed salad and my partner chose the tuna tartare, which is finished at table and one of the restaurant's signature dishes. as I don't eat fish or seafood, I took his word for it that it was excellent.\n\nFor our next course I had carrot tortolloni filled with carrot pur\u00e9e  in a carrot broth which was exquisite, and my partner had scallops on a bed of grapefruit and pureed vegetables. He said it was the best thing he had ever eaten in his life. \n\nFor our means I had medium rare ribeye on a bed of tiny vegetables, while my partner had the duck. Both were generous portions exquisitely cooked and whetted our appetite for dessert.\n\nFor dessert I chose a light mousse which set off the meal perfectly, while my partner chose a mini chocolate thing that's hard to explain but also light and airy. Just really thought we were done, a food runner brought to plates - one with a mini macaron, cinnamon caramel candy, a fruit gelee and another cookie, along with four dark chocolates - two chocolate sesame and chocolate hazelnut. along with our amazing cappuccinos with the best milk I've ever had anywhere we were now absolutely and perfectly full.\n\nMy advice to anyone going is to go early if you  are concerned about noise; try different wines by the glass, as there's no financial benefit ordering bottles if you like to try different things; let them know when you make the reservation that it's your first time dining there and expect the best food and you won't be disappointed. Even with our rather lackadaisical server, it is one of the best restaurant experiences we have ever had.", "author": "Roberta D."}

Great ambiance, service, and food at this new spot opened few weeks ago. :-) 4.4 stars.\n\nCost to worth it rating: 3, standard fine dining (appetizers ~$20s, entrees ~$30-40s)\nReturn worthiness: yes\n\nService: 4.6, Atmosphere: 4.3, Food: 4\n\nHighlights:\n- Bread: grilled slices served with ricotta with honey seasalt--big yum\n- Foie and pineapple crepe: thought foie and pineapple were actually gonna be in side the crepe, but was actually a big piece of seared foie gras on top of a tiny folded up crepe. This was filled with duck confit and there were few squares of pineapple on the side along with a saucer filled with pineapple marmalade. Funny circle of events, as my very first seared foie I had at Aqua in this same location many moons ago. \n- Waiter: Kenrich (that's what it said on the bill) is the kind of waiter I like. He was cool, casual but professional, and passionate about the offerings on the menu. When asked for suggestions, he gave definitive answers.\n- Service: apart from waiter, the rest of the staff was excellent as well. Our water was constantly being filled. (and I drink a lot of water), plates delivered at the right pace, and removed swiftly thereafter. A manager-type person visited our table several times to check on us to see how things were going.\n- Dessert: crazy sampling of multiple mini desserts. Loved the thin crispy white chocolate slices and the creative passion fruit chicharons (like light airy shrimp chips but passionfruity)\n- Short ribs: excellent presentation with a plate of polenta surrounded circularly at the edge of the plate by figs, greens, and a few fried meaty little arrancia balls. Just when I was thinking \"where's the pork?\" they came with a pan of the braised pork and juices mixed with pomegranate they played for me. I like tableside plating--that makes it fun (especially grand with the delicious lobster pot pie I had at the original before).\n- Atmosphere: modern decor, nice and open with tall ceilings. The kind of fine dining I prefer: elegant yet comfortable. Could've been Quince's sibling. A lot better than the former sterile hotel spot.\n- Amuse: little triangle of prosciutto and cheese along small cup of fennel soup. Cute and tasty.\n- Wine by glass list: about page each for white and red, liked the ones the waiter recommended\n- Mocktails: had 2 \"zero proof\" drinks on the cocktail menu. I had the grape limeade which was good.\n- Accommodating: lady sitting next to us requested a vegan tasting menu and they were fine with it and her friend had the regular one. I always want to do the tasting menu and the hub doesn't eat seafood so sometimes it's an issue.\n- Steak: hub said it was a good size and he enjoyed it. Came with melted leeks and warm salad he actually ate.\n- Lemon verbena chamomile tea: comforting taste and scent.\n\nMidlights:\n- Explanation: would've liked more explanation if each element on our plates upon delivery--there were a few items not described on the menu I couldn't identify.\n- Squash souffl\u00e9: tasty especially with lightly truffled cream sauce, but a bit dense and hefty for a souffl\u00e9\n- Music bit too loud--like the natural lively chatty level of the room, but seems like they were playing to the bar scene\n\nLowlights:\n- Bathroom stalls: too dark so it's like you're in a closet\n\nEnjoyed the new spot, created a delightful evening with the hub, and would come back.", "author": "Eve K."}

The plusses of going out to eat with your family instead of just your hubby :) \n\nAmuse: grilled cheese sandwich and some celery cream soup. Delicious! \nBread: Yes, buttered toasted sourdough with that great honey/ricotta spread. I was more a fan of the honey than the ricotta. \n\nTo start...\n-Tartare: yum! Reminds me of poke. It was really well done but a I found it a little funny it was over crustless white toast. \n-Alba white truffle tagliatelle: Creamy, rich, with really generous shavings of truffle.\n-Prime beef rib-eye shabu shabu: Really tender beef with nicely paired toasted sesame sauce. I found the dashi-base broth they poured in the end too salty and could've done without it. I wish they had just left us the clear chicken/shiitake broth they used to cook the beef with! \n\nEntrees...\n-Scallops: found it undercooked in the center which of course make it very very tender but it didn't taste it. Accompanied with various veggies. \n-Black cod: super tender, super good! It was actually only half the entree and was accompanied by sweet and sour pork. \n-Duck breast: Could've been more tender in my opinion.

Rich and creamy but with a ton of root veggies, crispy kale, and large chunks of lobster atop a crispy flaky crust. We all really liked this dish. \n\nDessert...\n-Tiramisu is heavy in benedictine liqueur! It had a nice delicate crisp covering, super fluffy in the center, and plated with white chocolate truffle balls. \n-We also got the dessert service which was a super fun way of sampling a lot of different sweets. I've never been a fan of lemon tarts but this one was light in consistency, almost pudding like. The pops had a grapefruit sorbet in the center covered with white chocolate. The fortune cookie had a nice earl grey glaze. One of my favorites were the brown sugar wafers --- so butter and just melts in your mouth. And finally the lozenge of chocolate and honey. \n\n\nMy highlights were definitely the truffle tagliatelle, shabu shabu, and lobster pot pie, and of course, the dessert.

We had to trade a few dishes after we were served to get what we wanted without confusing the waitstaff, but this is a minor complaint.\n\nAll of the selections were outstanding and truly creative. Portions are tiny but there are so many courses that you won't leave hungry. Service was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable.

Absolutely incredible. i can taste why this restaurant  is Michelin rated. Fantastic. \n\nThe roasted black cod was also delicious. Not quite on par with the Lobster Pot Pie, but still excellent. The only letdown I would say was the chilled dungeness crab. Perhaps it was the cold temp that robbed it of flavor and caught me a bit off guard. My taste buds didn't cooperate with this appetizer. \n\nWe were also treated to a mini grilled cheese sandwich and artichoke soup. This was A++ in flavor, a nice touch, and really set the mood for an incredible evening. \n\nOn the wine list, the Wink Cuvee Michael Mina Cabernet was great. I've been looking all over for this wine. If anyone knows how to get it, please let me know. \n\nFinally, excellent service. Our server was and all staff were extremely friendly, attentive, and just put all the pieces in place for a very warm, romantic evening. Thanks Michael Mina.", "author": "DeeJay M."}

Now I was super excited for this meal to the point where I even passed on lunch to make sure I had enough room in my stomach for the awesomeness.  I know..... Silly idea on my part but it sounded good at the time.\nWe were seated in the middle of the dining room and the d\u00e9cor of the place was clean and upscale which I expected for Michael Mina's flagship restaurant. The noise level of the room was a bit loud so it did make it hard to hear the conversations going around but everyone had a great time and it wasn't a deal breaker for me.\nNow for the most important part... the FOOD!\nI ordered a Manhattan with makers mark and it was a great cocktail. Perfect blend of alcohol and the table ordered a Grenache which was recommended by the Waiter and did in fact turn out to be excellent so WINNING!\nThe restaurant started the table off with complimentary mushroom soup and a small grilled cheese along with Bread that had a cheese/honey dip to the side. Honestly I could have eaten both of these things all day long. My co worker saw me eyeing her bread and offered to give it to me so clearly the hunger was showing in my eye which is embarrassing but yeah it was just that good.\nI ordered the Sashimi as my starter and my other co workers ordered the Tuna Tartare and the Slow cooked suckling pig (what an awesome name... almost started drooling at the sound of it) so I was able to sample a bit of each of these items. The Tuna tartare was fresh and had a slight kick to it so I definitely appreciated it. The Suckling pig... omfggggg  delicious... wish I could have made this my main dish. The sashimi was okay.... But I did feel it was not that impressive and not something I would order again unfortunately. But 2/3 is winning for me so far!\nFor my entr\u00e9e I ordered the Black Angus Prime Ribeye while my co worker ordered the Black Truffle- crusted ocean trout. I will start with the trout since I was able to take a bite out of it. Now I love the idea of anything truffle. Huge fan and automatic high expectations. She gave me a small piece and honestly it was underwhelming. I could not taste the truffle at all and it just tasted like a well cooked fish. Now the taste was still great but when I think of a Michael Mina restaurant I would have hoped for more. The ribeye came out and the presentation was great. The ribeye was cooked perfectly and the spinach ravioli was amazeballs. Now this is my fault so I am not going to fault the restaurant but this place is apparently known for their seafood so it was my mistake to order a ribeye and expect it to match up to the amazing ribeyes I have had in a Chicago Steakhouse. It was good but unfortunately could not compare to an actual steakhouse but I should not expect it to so just want to throw that out there as a disclaimer. My other co worker ordered the Lobster Pot Pie which he devoured before I could even take a bite. But he said it was amazing and I kind of regretted not choosing it just because it is so intriguing and I'm a big fan of pot pie.\nWe looked through the dessert menu to see what we wanted and everything looked awesome. So we ordered one of everything..... Literally.  I don't even remember what everything is because we had like 6 desserts in front of us. But none of them disappointed except the Green Apple Pop. It is not that this dessert was terrible but it just was not anything special or memorable so try anything else but this!\nAll in all, definitely a great place to go. The ambiance is great, the wait staff is polite and courteous, and the food had great presentation along with great taste. It was quite an experience and I have my eye on trying that tasting menu next time... I will be back hungry for more", "author": "Dan M."}

Made a last minute change in reservations and came here last night on a Friday.  The only reason for 4 stars was the slightly cold welcome and herding us into the waiting area at the bar, which at the time was packed with a large group celebrating something.  They were passing around champagne flutes, and pushing us to the edges of the waiting area by the front door, which was cold every time it opened.  We were ready to have a great dining experience, but this part was not fun - especially if the area is already packed with a group that all know each other.  Makes it hard for others to wait in the middle of all that.  \n\nAnyway, we knew we wanted to treat ourselves to some caviar and champagne or vodka, and have a tasting menu, so we were ready as soon as our server showed up.  He and the food, is the reason for what should have been 5 stars!  His last name is the same of a famous Pittsburgh Penguins player, and he's an avid Red Wings fan (we are Toronto Maple Leafs fans).  We loved him and he made the meal spectacular.  All the servers and employees in the dining room were fabulous.  We did the 11 course tasting menu + wine pairing which both sommeliers handled incredibly well.  The stories for each wine were just right - exciting and interesting!  They were delicious wines and each was perfect for each course.  We appreciated them tapering off the amount of wine for us at the end, since we still wanted to end the meal standing and feeling good!  Our favourites were the amuse bouche, the traditional Russian caviar service and vodka, the lobster, the beef, the quail - oh wait I think we liked it all.  Including dessert which was so interesting!  \n\nWe closed the place down (over 3 hrs for a lot of great food - we were stuffed!), and loved having this start our vacation off right.", "author": "Modern L."}

This place is a total yawn food-wise. You won't get the value expected from a high-end restaurant.  We were disappointed with the quality of the ingredients, taste combinations, and overall experience for the kind of prices that they charged. The presentation was pretty and dainty but not like what you would see at Crenn. At Michael Mina, what a joke. We had the chef's tasting menu. The beef was overcooked and did not have much beef flavor, and for dessert, we got some glorified \"chocolate pudding\" with no dimension/complexity, in a glass cup with a tiny amaretti on the side which tasted quite dull too, not what you would expect from such a hyped restaurant. I don't remember everything we ate because it was so forgettable; there was one oyster with scallions, one scallop garnished with one small popcorn, and foie gras, bread and butter (the butter and foie gras were the best things, but with foie gras that's a no brainer). The entire full course could have all fit in one 8 inch diameter plate. So yes, don't go there hungry, by the time you finish, you'll feel like it was just a glorified but disappointing snack, not a meal. There were three of us and the bill was $1200 with tax and tip for three tasting menus plus three cocktails.  We were not blown away.  Wish we ate at Perbacco right next door instead. Food there is better by a million times, more imaginative and tasty and value well worth your money.", "author": "Valerie C."}

Otherwise, play it safe and get the agnolotti and the signature lobster pot pie.\n\nI was delighted to be invited for a business dinner at Michael Minna in mid November 2012.  Fancy cocktails were easy--a few general instructions for the bartender, and voila, something just for you.  Spectacular.\n\nEverything on the menu looked pretty exciting, so it was pretty difficult to make a decision.  I went for a few things I'd always wanted to try:  abalone, and matsutake mushroom with wagyu steak.   A tiny fragment of abalone arrived in an enormous bowl on a tiny rice cake swimming in a few spoonfuls of miso broth with exactly one pea and one slice of shiitake mushroom.  Honestly, a flawless presentation.  The flavors were simple and true, the one off thing was the abalone itself, which was almost inedibly rubbery.  Just a week later I had some correctly sliced, pounded, and lightly fried abalone (admittedly fresh from the ocean) which put that one to shame by a long shot.\n\nThe wagyu steak was delicious but I had actually misread the menu and it was served with a pittance of matsutake rather than the more exotic matsutake.  I was also annoyed that the server had talked me out of a larger portion because it was \"rich\".  Honey, I've been to Pied du Conchon and ate half of one with foie gras all by myself.\n\nAfter an interminable wait which stretched our conversational abilities to the limit (this is three hours after the end of our two-hour meeting preceding the dinner), the dessert service arrived.  These were all tiny worlds unto themselves, and they were all great.\n\nWere I to go back, I would probably just go for dessert at the bar and ogle.  It was one of the most interesting crowds I've ever seen, mostly older men accompanied by dazzling, elegant women.", "author": "Seth G."}

The we had was the lobster pie. The lobster was so succulent and tender, I couldn't get enough. However, I do realize it was soaked in butter, so there's a bit of cheating there (maybe not 'cheating' but you food people know what I mean).\n\nThe lamb, duck, and ribeye were pretty good, but not worth the $40+ price.

I've had a lot better experiences for far less money in SF.  \n\nFirst, we were one of the first to arrive with a 6pm reservation and we were seated right by the kitchen in the back.  We felt very disconnected from the main room & the rest of the restaurant.  We also were very underwhelmed with our server.  He was very hard to hear and wasn't enthusiastic about anything...we even asked for recommendations and he kind of stumbled through it.  For the price, the servers should know the menu!!!\n\nThe positives were the bread service, quail, lobster pot pie, and smores dessert.  All were delicious. We had received a gift card, which is why we came but don't think we'll be back for the $$.

An impressive attribute of such places is the degree of perception with which the staff can divine your level of comfort and familiarity with the situation and gauge how much they should offer to help you along in order to get the most from your experience.  They read minutiae like facial expression and body language.  It can be spooky.  But that's what it takes when your famous restaurant has the Mayor coming by every week, as well as wide-eyed couples from the provinces looking forward to a capstone dining experience on their honeymoons.  The goal is simply to make every diner feel like royalty for a time.\n\nThe \"front end\" of Michael Mina for our visit, as embodied in the server and the wine steward, put forth an impression of a tourist restaurant in Florida that takes it upon itself to introduce the concept of fresh fish to the great unwashed.  Worse, this attitude did not change despite our efforts to convey by such cues as we could, that this was not the first time we'd been to a fine restaurant.  (We enjoy dressing for a nice dinner out; I don't believe our appearance distinguished us from other patrons.)\n\nOur server was patronizing, bordering on insulting.  She insisted on explaining how a French-style multi-course menu works: \"you pick one from this list, one from that list, ... \" and treated us as if it was our first time in the Big City   This was after us affirming, yes, we know how to read your menu, we know how this sort of thing works.  This overture set the tone for her interaction with us, and the rest of the dinner proceeded in the same vein.  We were also interrupted at inconvenient times while we were eating--just no excuse for that.\n\nThen there was the wine steward.  I asked about a particular, older vintage of a prominent Bordeaux (it might have been a Pessac-Leognan or a Pichon-Longueville), and he enthused about my choice.  The wine was well over the hill with almost nothing left.  It should not have been on offer, or, if he had any acquaintance with it at all, he should have pointed out that it had little fruit left, but might be of interest to a fan of that particular label. \n\nWaitstaff management in places that aspire to such culinary standards should teach their people how to behave and how to do their jobs properly.  In France, our \"front end\" experience would guarantee that Michael Mina not get a single rosette.\n\nThe dessert was very creative, well presented, and wonderful.", "author": "T D."}

It's not the freshest.   The lamb and beef were good.  All the dishes were creative, but the seafood should be avoided.  Without trying to sound like snob, for most American, the fresh seafood is good enough but for those of us that really know, it's not good enough.  The rest of the dishes are good.  It seems the theme of the restaurant is Fresh Asian fusion (my guess) and the fish isn't so good, I would say Prospect, La Boulevard, Arquarello are better choice.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-06-29", "description": "What was supposed to be our fond au revoir to foie turned out to be a sad parting of ways with Michael Mina. \n\nUpon opening the door last night, I was blown away by the sheer amount of noise in the restaurant. It was noisier in the restaurant than outside on the bustling sidewalk in the FiDi! The people at the host stand were very welcoming and engaging, even walking by our table and cracking jokes throughout the night, +1 star. Our server failed to introduce himself by name but was very courteous, if not a bit sterile in delivery. Throughout dinner, we felt a bit neglected. We counted him completely bypassing our table 3x after it was cleared. It took half an hour before we were offered dessert menus. I would normally make excuses for him, perhaps he had a lot of tables and he was very busy. Perhaps we were talking so animatedly amongst ourselves that he didn't feel he should intrude upon our conversation. The problem with those excuses is the front of the house is extremely well staffed and our server didn't even glance at our table. How do I know? Well, because I was staring at him desperately hoping to catch his attention. Our dinner started at 7pm, we left the restaurant at 10:30pm and we had 5 courses. I'm pretty sure we sat through close to 2 seatings as we saw tables change before we were even through our 2nd course. I have had an 8 course tasting at the chef's table with wine pairing at Saison that didn't last that long. \n\nBeginning with a not too sweet glass of gew\u00fcrztraminer, just the way I like it, and terrific bread service, I thought our night was off to a great start. The amuse was also encouraging, a chilled English pea puree soup and a delightful wagon wheel grilled cheese.\n\nSquid ink conchiglie - YUM, +1 star. Toothsome al dente pasta paired well with the brininess of the Monterey Bay shellfish and nicely finished with a very fresh piece of uni and uni emulsion.\n\nSnake River Farms Wagyu Shabu Shabu +1star was the highlight of our night, thank God for that dish. The presentation was fun and involved. The buttery foie cube was delectable when dipped into the tasty broth. The wagyu wrapped around enoki mushrooms was fatty and tender.\n\nMichael's \"Mac & Cheese\" off of the Farewell to Foie Gras tasting menu. If this is farewell, I'm sad we ever said hello. Is it wrong that we were expecting a piping hot small bowl of elbow macaroni in a savory cheesy sauce with foie mousse and maybe some browned bread crumbs? What appeared before us was three room-temp limp sheets of pasta wrapped into tubes surrounding grey matter that was supposed to be foie mousse and duck confit oozing out unappetizingly. Topping the rolls was one twist of hard, dry, stringy prosciutto and a walnut gremolata. Underneath the rolls was a watery brown sauce that was running all over the plate. This dish was so utterly disappointing, I can't even believe it bears MM's name. Never have I seen such horrible plating at a Michelin star rated restaurant. A better description of the item would have helped, I'd have thought twice before ordering it. How do you mess up mac & cheese? By bringing out a dish that has no business being called mac & cheese.  -1 star\n\n25 minuntes later, we were still waiting for our entr\u00e9es . I thought foie would be ILLEGAL before it finally arrived at our table.\n\nThe Liberty Farms duck I had for my main came with a piece of seared foie so good it had me considering buying a lobe before the ban and attempting to sear it at home.  Oddly enough, it came with a tough-skinned duck dumpling in salty dashi broth. The duck breast was juicy and the skin was crispy and well executed. \n\n45 minutes later, after much discussion and wondering aloud of why we were being ignored...\n\nWe shared desserts, beginning with a dark chocolate flourless cake with pretzels and nuts. I'm not a fan of chocolate or flourless, but even I enjoyed this playful take on a Snickers bar. \n\nMascarpone and strawberry cheesecake with basil ice cream, which again was not described well. We expected a slice of cheesecake, but out came a deconstructed version. A pleasant surprise, beautiful to look at and very refreshing, but not what we were expecting.\n\nCaramel foie ice cream, again off the Farewell to Foie tasting menu was another disappointment. Tasting nothing like caramel, nothing like foie, it was a salt lick on a plate. Four professionals who meet often for fine dining left foie ice cream and brioche on a plate, slowly melting away into a dismal puddle. If that doesn't tell you how sad we were about that dish, I'm not sure what will.\n\nOh, Michael Mina...there's not much left to say between us. Our lukewarm love story began at Michael Mina and the Clock Bar at the Westin then continued on at Michael Mina Vegas. I was hoping to go to American Fish and Arcadia. After dinner here last night, I'm sad to say we need to see other people.

There's a foie cherry appetizer ( part of a quartet on the menu ), a seared foie dish, and you can get some foie in the Shabu Shabu.  So of course we waltzed into the bar and ordered all three.\n\nThe cocktail program here is interesting - they are doing some really nice stuff, none of which really appealed to me in the description, but every one of which my companion and I tried was excellent.  In particular, a gin drink called P.S., made with beefeater, of all things, was remarkably refreshing.\n\nDespite eating at the bar, we received an amuse of cold pea soup and a hot grilled cheese sandwich bite, a nice touch.\n\nThe foie cherry ( we had to get a quartet containing two cherries and two beef tartare bites ) - a chunk of foie gras coated in some sort of cherry coating and made to look like a deformed cherry out of a Dr. Seuss book - is delicious and creative.  Seared Foie was pretty straightforward, but extremely well done - grill marks on the surface of a quality piece of generous size.  The Shabu Shabu presentation is also wonderful, being cooked in a paper bowl over flame.  They present the hot and salty, but amazingly flavored broth afterward in little cups.\n\nThe only problem with the whole thing was that we figured, eating at the bar, it could not take more than an hour for a couple drinks and three appetizers to appear.

The food was delicious from the tiny beet salad to appetizers to the dinner. The salmon plate and Ribeye got high marks from the group. However don't come hungry.

I've had dinner there years ago,  drinks and apps in the recent past... but the truth of my refusal to go there was that my most recent X-bf lives at Millenium tower next door and I didn't want any valet guys or worse... bumping into him as if I'm trying to go out of my way to see him.  Ugh.  \nThankfully he was really cool about it. I didn't realize this was where Aqua had been. He told me that I could wear jeans, but I have to disagree, I would have worn something a little bit dressier.  I am not a big fan of hoity- toity places when I feel underdressed. He said he was upstairs in his office & would be down in a minute. So I reluctantly walked in to wait for him.\nI immediately  was enamored by the long swanky bar. I loved the vaulted ceiling, dim lighting, and modern decor. I was relieved to see a familiar face behind the inviting bar. I remember Carlo from Gitane. He hasn't changed his ways... still a phenomenal mixologist!  While waiting, I started with a glass of Italian wine from Piedmont: Nebbiolo, Ronchi, Barbaresco. \n\nSo I have to disclose that this review is not the typical dining experience. Although it was my first time @ MM, I was fortunate to be invited to a private VIP tasting event last night. Dining with a corporate executive chef definitely has its perks. It was very sweet that he introduced me to each & every person that greeted him... from the sommelier (Josiah, probably spelling this wrong), captain, general manager, and the primary chef (Mike Davis) that was preparing each dish of our 5 course meal for us.\n\nOur initial hors d'oeuvres presented to us was: sturgeon & caviar, foi gras \"cherry\".  It looked like pretty candy. Simple small bites of amazing flavor... delicious. Also a tiny taste of grilled cheese served w/  chilled pea soup.\nThe starters that he chose for us: \"seared diver scallops\"  with bacon wrapped endive, wheat berries with white ale reduction and MM version of \"mac & cheese with a twist... that is foi gras inside the pasta\".  Another winner; I couldn't decide between the two which was better; both were equally savoury!  During all this time, Carlo continued to pour us a variety of unique cocktails that were unbelievably refreshing.  His enigmatic concoction of a variety of unusual ingredients was baffling to witness and taste. \n\nPrior to our main entrees, Mike and all the the others would check on us... everyone was super attentive and friendly. Hands down the service was outstanding.  So the main course: \"Wild King Salmon\" sepia, white asparagus royale, maitake mushroom tempura... and an absolutely scrumptious Rib-Eye... OMG... wow.  We were pretty silent at this point.  I don't think the steak was on the menu. The sides served with our main entrees were: super lightly whipped potatoe, portobello mushrooms... and something else.\n\nFinally, the last course of the night... dessert.  I don't recall the name of the pastry chef, but I should definitely find out... wow.  AND there were 3 or 4 of these sinfully delectable dishes... UGH. There was the strawberries with mascarpone and basil ice cream, and 2 other bite-size dolce dish... but my favorite was most definitely the peanutbutter with chocolate mousse with tiny chocolate covered pretzels and peanuts... again wow!\n\nThankfully all these dishes were smaller portions since this was a tasting. Since he is responsible for several of MM restaurants in the country, I was flattered when he offered future tastings outside of SF... nice! But not sure if my waist line will like that too much!", "author": "Myra M."}

From the start, service was impeccable.  Friendly, but not too friendly, cheerful, and very attentive and not intrusive.  We were going to order drinks and some some food to nosh, but then decided to share the prix fixe menu because we saw a couple of items we were going to order to nosh on, on the prix fixe menu.

I was hopeful Chef Siegel would be reinspired by cooking here (after my so so experience at the Dining Room last year) and if he was really doing the cooking then he is back.   The dining room at the old Aqua restaurant is an extremely cozy, comfortable space.  Wooden tables, comfortable couches and chairs, romantic lighting and excellent service are some of the words I would use to describe Michael Mina. \n\nWe started out with the hors d'eourves, a selection of four canapes that I feel pay homage to Chef Siegel's Japanese focus on dishes such as ocean trout with curry sushi rice, turbot with green tea gelee and another fish that had a bit of yuzu (I think).  They were tasty, I could have had a few more of the turbot.  \n\nFor appetizer I had the squid ink conchigile, fiancee had the dungeness crab salad and my brother had the ahi tuna tartare.  Mine was very well made with pieces of lobster while the dungeness crab dish was beautifully presented.  The ahi tuna tartare, a staple of theirs was very good.\n\nFor entrees, my brother ordered the lamb which was the best one of all.  My fiancee ordered the duck and I had the rib eye.  Hers was better than mine but the portions were definitely filling (sometimes your entree can be $40+ but still not filling).  \n\nThe dessert is what really wowed us.  I would highly recommend trying out the dessert sampler as they give you several different items and they all have a bit of a molecular gastronomy style to it.  I wish I could tell you what I ate but I can't, all I know is it was delicious.  We also tried their apple pop dessert which was refreshing and light.\n\nI met Chef Mina in the restroom (of all places) and he was nice to ask me about my experience and thanked me for dining there.  I'll tell you what I told him; \"You guys gave me a complete meal.\"  I've ate at a lot of places this year and this is definitely one of the top places.  From the moment I walked in to the moment I left, everything was great.  The service was attentive, detailed and better than expected.

Sure, this is a good restaurant with good food but it has really lost its edge.\n\nThe quality and imagination put into the food has gone down quite a bit but the prices went up about 50%. At this rate, might as well explore any other fine restaurant in the city. So what's changed? Old Michael Mina would send you an amuse bouche between every other course but not this time. Old MM, every course would melt in your mouth. This time, my duck was so tough I couldn't easily cut it with my knife. The wine pairing was off - the white wine made the fish dishes taste extra fishy. I consider myself a mediocre cook and even I dont pair acidic white wines with any fish.\n\nAll in all, this is a great place and you probably won't be disappointed.

It was good, but not great: it was a bit small, and the combination of the blood orange and vinaigrette made it a bit too sour, although the kampachi was very fresh.\nMiddle: ribeye shabu shabu - both the broth and meat were delicious. The beef was nice and tender, and the toasted sesame and ponzu went really well together.\nMain: halibut and pork belly - I loved this dish; the halibut was cooked perfectly, and the pork belly had a nice crispy skin and juicy tender meat. \nI was too full to order dessert, but they had a complimentary mini dessert (green tea ice cream with a cake/wafer and yuzu foam), as well as individually-packaged macaroons for us to take home.\n\nService:\nExcellent as well; our waiter was very friendly and attentive, and our water glasses were refilled quickly. Service also proceeded at a good pace - we didn't feel rushed at all, nor did we have to wait too long in between courses.\n\nAmbience:\nNice and classy.

Fog from the liquid nitrogen was spilling out of our bowls. It was great to watch. Then when the fog stopped, it revealed a beautiful bowl of gazpacho garnish with flower petals. It's was great. Then the next course was a soft shell crab with soba. It's not as creative but flavors were bursting. We usually hate soft shell crab but that's because we never had it like this. It's was delicate, crispy and flavorful. Both of these dishes were great. They were unique, creative and delicious. Then from there on the dishes were more straight forward and typical like a risotto topped with a little bit of squab or steak with a side of carrots. Overall the savory courses were good. I think the first two courses just raised our expectations too high for the rest of the courses. \n\nThe deconstructed strawberry cheesecake from the tasting menu was great. We also added the dessert service off of the regular menu. It's like a dessert tasting menu. You get about 6 mini bites of desserts for $15.

Though \"not unfriendly\", he was a bit robot-like and didn't really \"facilitate\" wine selection, but just kind of stood there as if I'm going to school him on wine.  A bit funny.  He can easily intimidate those less comfortable around the wine topic.  Again, more of an awkward thing, not a major ding on him.  \n\nAnyway...I enjoyed the pre-meal drink at the bar.  Very creative cocktails; I went with the bar's choice (sort of a mystery cocktail)...just inform of what alcohol you like (i.e. Vodka) and other \"likes\" (i.e. chocolate) and he will create a custom drink for you.  Pretty cool.  \n\nWe all went with the 9-course.  I was initially concerned that it would be too much food, but it ended up being quite perfect.  Each of the 9-courses are what they are...tasting portions...but it all adds up.  The 6-course may leave the average eater unfulfilled.  Standouts include the lobster course, the \"bird\" course (squab was very good), and the top-grade kobe beef.  The sashimi course was nothing special.  \n\nNice place with good service, but for the price, I felt there could have been more creative food offerings.

Valet was very fast and the building itself was very inviting. The host was courteous and polite. Seated us promptly and our waiter came shortly thereafter. As I was getting acclimated to my surroundings I noticed the cool vibe in the air. While having some bread, cheese, and honey I saw the crowd was a little older (me being 30 that is) but that was not an issue at all. More of a professional crowd with the vibrant San Franciscan vibe (Love It). Ambience was calm with a little pop. \n\nWe started off with the Live Santa Barbara Spot Prawns (Piquillo Peppers, Clams, Serrano Ham). Delicious. I enjoyed the starter as much as I enjoyed the \"TWO BULLEITS\" Cocktail I was drinking. (Bulleit Bourbon, Cardamon, Star Anise, Pear). For my entree I had the Liberty Farms Duck Breast (Seared Foie Gras, Miso-Pear Puree, Duck Shumai, Dashi. The Duck was very good and cooked to perfection. The addition of the Seared Foie Gras as a spread made it that more tasty.  You can really tell where the chefs are going with the French influence and Japanese ingredients. \n\nFor dessert we had a platter of different bite size concoctions for two made with unique texture and taste. Starting off with the Avitar (Maraschino, Lemon, Creme De Vioette, Gin). Wafers (Jasmine, Brown Sugar). Briquette (Caramel Apple & White Chocolate). Whiskey (Caramel, Pecan, Orange, Angostura). Crisps (Walnut Toffee, Dark Chocolate). Lozenge (Milk Chocolate, Honey). The desserts were great and believe it or not the bite size portions of 5 different dishes works. Lets you see the what the chefs can really do. I don't know I guess I'm a dessert guy. lol. \n\nIn conclusion, Michael Mina is very deserving of all the attention and recognition it continues to receive. From moderate pricing to Outstanding Service, knowledgeable staff, creative bartenders, and up and coming chefs Michael Mina is poised to be a staple in the San Francisco fine dining experience. Without changing the menu but constantly adding variations as the seasons change Michael Mina is one of the top fine dining establishments in San Francisco.", "author": "Alastair G."}

The last entr\u00e9e - the Japanese A5 Wagyu - was probably the best beef dish (of any kind) that I've ever had. The tasting menu was not overly exotic in ingredients or presentation, but every dish was well-prepared and thoughtful, instead of just shocking. Strong Asian influence throughout, which I enjoyed. If I were to be a little critical, the desserts were not quite up to rest of the menu, but after 10 other courses, I may have been too full to enjoy anything. The service was smooth but not silly formal, and while we dressed up, many other diners did not. Reasonable valet parking ($10) made it convenient. The dining room is fairly large and quiet. At $165, it's definitely not cheap, but I've paid more for less. There's also a 4-course menu (with many selections for each course) for $95 per person (with a few choices that had a supplemental charge). But if you really want to get the \"flavor\" of the restaurant, the tasting menu is a nice indulgence. Recommended.", "author": "Larry L."}

I forgot the bartender's name but that was the most balanced margarita I've had in ages. Just the right amount of alcohol combined with an obviously in-house squeezed lime equals an alcoholic's heaven.\n\nWent with the tasting menu for dinner as it seems like a fair value at $130.\n\nThe Highlights\nSeared baby scallops - I didn't know it was possible to perfectly sear baby scallops but apparently it is. A\n\nSashimi with shaved dried soy sauce. One nice thing about the shaved soy sauce is that I don't have to worry about dripping soy sauce on myself. Still this was a bit odd for me.

The pork skin had the fat nicely rendered out but the meat itself while tender was rather bland. B- only because the trout. If it was just the pork it would be a C-\n\nDissapointing\nTiramisu - I know the ladyfingers are supposed to be soaked, but this is just carrying it a bit too far.

Id feel a little sorry for the guy that took me here, had he not chosen the place and new exactly what he was getting himself into. Though I don't think he seemed to mind. Nor mind the fact that I flirted with the way cuter server the whole time cuz I was bored out of my mind on this date. But anyway, Im supposed to review the place, not the date...\n\nI also thought I knew what I was getting myself into when I came here. Although, apparently, I was severely underdressed. Even with fancy boots, a nice blouse and a short skirt, the attire here is mostly suits and ties due to the location. It's not their dress code, but the overwhelming amount of 9-5rs having a drink here after work, who, I should note, have no problem hitting on a single lady sitting by herself at the bar here. I was handed 4 business cards in the 45 minutes I waited, while drinking at the bar. If you're a single lady, I would say this is the place to either meet your future investment banker husband, or just be a mistress for an already married one. Either way, they have bad haircuts and shitty pickup lines. But again, I digress...\n\nFor $600 (thats including tax & tip) my date and I each had the tasting menu with wine pairings and a few extra glasses of wine. For that much money, I wish I could remember the food better. I can't. I remember the presentation, which was neat. And the food was obviously good. But nothing that made me fall back in my seat and freak out about. The wine pairing though, THAT was memorable. I have never had wine (or beer) paired so incredibly well a meal. It blew me away. And I was wasted by the end of the meal because I'm pretty sure they were a little over 2oz pours. Speaking of the end of the meal, the dessert was awesome. That's coming back to me now. There was chocolate. And lots of it. \n\nAfter the meal, we each were handed a pretty envelope that contained the food & drinks we had both just had (maybe so we could remember what happened that night, due to our drunken state??) and i do still have it. Sometimes I look at it and try and pretend what it all tasted like, knowing I will likely never go there again, and sometimes I look at it with determination, knowing I will someday meet another rich lad (hopefully not a boring one) who will take me back to Michael Mina.", "author": "Elly S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-08", "description": "After one of my former classmates, who also happens to be a Chef Instructor, spoke so highly of Michael Mina on so many occasions I felt inclined to check out this Financial District hot-spot for lunch on my final full day in the San Francisco. I was slightly ahead of time for my early reservation but a friendly hostess greeted me cheerfully at the door and sat me immediately at a one-top with no neighbors; this is generally a plus when I am dining alone and do not particularly want to hear the details of another couple's conversation. After a fun morning of walking all over Union Square, Chinatown and the Financial District I was looking forward to a glass of water and to enjoying a glass of sparkling wine or one of Michael Mina's house-made sodas.\n\nUpon receiving my lunch and beverage menus I began my hunt for libation and was content to see a sparkling wine on the by-the-glass menu that looked to have been blended for Michael Mina my Iron Horse, one of my top five favorite sparkling wine producers in the United States. However, my attention was swiftly diverted further down the list to the Krug Grand Cuvee... BY THE GLASS! By the glass, people... Krug Champagne in a single, Abby-sized pour. I was beside myself. Needless to say, I gladly splurged on the $38 dollar glass and savored each and every sip to the fullest extent. Now the more difficult of my decision-making processes, figuring out whether I wanted to order the three or four-course lunch prix fixe menu. For $49 I opted for the three-course selection and was allowed to choose one plate each from the Starters, Main and Sweet categories (the four-course included a selection from the Middle section and cost a pretty reasonable $59).\n\nI was given ample, though not excessive, time to chill and regather my thoughts before my first course arrived and enjoyed fresh bread and butter while I visually savored the bright dining room and the tastefully simple appointments that added to the allure of the interior. From the abstractness of the partial \"wall\" behind to hostess' desk to the long bar featuring top-shelf selections Michael Mina screams class, yet whispers relaxation. Once I had time to nibble at a couple pieces of bread, the kind, though slightly less personable, waiter who took care of me presented a beautifully-arranged plate of various ingredients that would soon come together to become one of the restaurant's signature dishes; Michael's Classic Aji Tuna Tartare. The small, ruby cubes of diced tuna were mixed into a tartare by the server, on the plate sitting right in front of me. Habanero-infused sesame oil, Asian pear, pine nuts and a raw quail egg yolk combined together with the fresh fish to create a delicious appetizer that could be eaten by itself or with the crustless toasts that accompanied the tuna on the plate.\n\nWhen my entree arrived at my table I was thrilled to see such a playful interpretation of one of my favorite fast foods of all time, Irish fish and chips. Michael Mina serves up their Alaskan Halibut \"Fish & Chips\" in a shallow bowl with a oceanic salad in the center of the fish filet and the fritters and allows room on the side for their own house-made malt vinegar and gribiche aioli. I believe that the Halibut pieces are coated in broken-up pieces of kataifi, a shredded form of phyllo dough, while the \"fries\" are actually chickpea fritters that have been formed into the shape of thickly-cut fries and deep-fried. Not only were the fritters and the fish cooked perfectly, but the coating on each one was perfectly even, provided excellent flavor and created an excellent contrast to the tender, moist interiors. Finally, the sauces manning the sidelines and the delicate salad in the center need not be overlooked as each one was perfectly selected to cut through the richness of the breading and the fattiness of the fried foods. The hijiki salad with pretty cross-sectional slices of lotus root and black sesame seeds was an excellent refresher in between bites of fish and fritter.\n\nLast, but not least, I ordered the Roasted Coconut Pavlova for dessert. Unfortunately , I know very little about the cuisine of Australia and New Zealand and I excitedly waited to experience Michael Mina's version of this classic, inspired by Russian ballet dancer, Anna Pavlova, on a tour Down Under. The air-filled, crispy orbs of meringue was delightful, especially when crushed into the pools of coconut-pineapple sabayon that garnished the plate. Formed strips of cardamom-roasted pineapple served to bring fruity freshness and yet another texture to the plate without the acidity that is so common of fresh pineapple; the whole plate suggested springtime and showcased the playful approach that the kitchen seems to take with many of their creations.\n\nI would like to return to Michael Mina for dinner when maybe my experience will be a little more personal and less lunchtime-casual. However, the cuisine was on-point and the service was beyond professional.", "author": "Abby M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-04", "description": "I needed a couple of days to write this review because I wanted to be as level-headed, but complete as possible.\n\nFor starters, let me throw out the disclaimer that since this is a Michelin-rated restaurant, my expectation levels were set pretty high. Whereas I might have been okay with little mistakes at a more casual, less renowned and/or less pricey restaurant, that doesn't - and can't - fly at a place like Michael Mina.\n\nStopped by with the fam on Friday night at 8:45pm. The host immediately noted our reservation and the hostess seated us after inquiring whether we wanted to check our coats. Great.\n\nA gentleman whom I initially assumed was our server (Giovanni) stopped by within a few moments to give us our menus and later took our drink orders and dinner order. We opted for the a la carte menu, thinking that the tasting menu would be a bit lengthy.\n\nThe service level started off impeccably. Within seconds of leaving one's seat, a busser will immediately remove your used napkin and replace it with a new one. Sweet.\n\nThe first issue presented itself when I found myself wondering where our drinks were about 10 minutes after ordering them. I eventually had to flag down Giovanni to check on them. He mentioned that the bar was a bit backed up. Hmmm...okay, sure.\n\nThe apps were a mixed bag. The foie gras was delish, but the tuna tartare was not the best. The main courses arrived maybe 45-50 minutes after we ordered, which also seemed a bit slow, but since I was expecting a leisurely experience, it wasn't a big deal. However, when I ordered a second drink, it also took at least 10-15 minutes to get prepared.\n\nThen in a confusing twist, another server brought our dinner plates, explained each dish and essentially took over the serving duties and we didn't see Giovanni anymore. It left me as a customer perplexed and feeling abandoned, frankly. As I later learned, Giovanni is actually a captain who jumped in to provide service while our regular server was otherwise occupied. I give him credit for jumping in, but I wish it had just been explained in advance.\n\nThe main courses were a bit hit or miss. My salmon was amazing, but the mushrooms and tempura-style vegetables were rubbery enough that I left them uneaten. \n\nFinally, there was the coffee. Which we ordered and then proceeded to wait for for at least 20 minutes. In fact at one point, coffee was given to every person at the table except for me, which was also awkward because then everyone had to wait around while I tried to flag someone down to ask what was happening.\n\nNormally, at that point, these repeated incidences might have warranted a 2 star rating. But this is not just a story of mistakes, but rather one of redemption. Giovanni came over and apologized profusely and sincerely. He first offered us free champagne, which we appreciated but declined. Then he offered us dessert, which we also appreciated but declined. Then he sent out free desserts anyway. And finally, he gave my wife his card and asked us to call him whenever we planned on going to any Michael Mina restaurant so that he could call them in advance and make sure that we were well taken care of.\n\nOverall, I'd have to say that I wanted to love Michael Mina, but I just didn't. The food pairings were inventive but just don't even compare to say, Joel Robuchon. However, I appreciate the extraordinary lengths to which they went to try to salvage the evening for us. And for that level of customer service alone, I'd have to say this place is worth a try.\n\nAnd you can trust me on this one; I'm an Elite. ;)", "author": "Sebastian L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-01-25", "description": "I left Michael Mina feeling very unimpressed.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nStarter: Abalone - This was mediocre at best. The presentation of the dish was beautiful, but the taste was nothing special. The abalone was soft when I bit into it, but it was way too salty. \nMiddle: Black Truffle Risotto - Horrible. I didn't taste any truffle, unless the truffle was supposed to taste citrusy. The whole dish was overwhelmed by this orange/lemon/citrusy zest which I really didn't like. And nowhere in the menu described this ingredient. Also, it was very very salty and the risotto was not fully cooked! I feel like I can make this dish better at home. \nEntree 1: Black Cod - There was way too many different things going on in this dish and it didn't come together well. The Cod was cooked well, but why do they have to put soooo much salt in this thing? There was sticky rice in this as well, and I think I had better ones from Chinatown for $2. \nEntree 2: Lobster Pot Pie - This was their signature dish and it ended up costing $75, so I  had high expectation. But in the end, I was very disappointed. There were about 4 pieces of lobster which I was fine with, but that broth they poured over the lobster was maybe made with half a bucket of salt. It drowned the pie crust and it turned into a soggy mess. Also, what made me wanted to get this dish was the mixture of the pistachio crumble. But it didn't even mix with the dish, it ended up clumping onto the side. \nDessert service - This included about 6 little separate dessert.  \n1) Grapefruit with the tarragon yogurt - I took 2 bites and I just left it. It was literally just terragon.. so overpowering that the little piece of grapefruit couldn't even save it.\n2)marquise, dark chocolate, espresso ice cream - This was ok, but nothing special. The espresso ice cream was super strong. So if you're a coffee fanatic, you might like this. But I rather go to Humphrey's for their blue mountain ice cream.\n3) balsmic crisp - This was interesting but I didn't really like white chocolate so I couldn't finish it.\n4) Jasmine cremeux - This was the whole reason why i got the dessert service. I was soooooooo disappointed! I thought it would be fragrant and taste like jasmine tea. How wrong was I? Very wrong! It tasted like some thick banana custard.\n5) Ice cream pop - All i remember was it tasted like a very mellow version of mint ice cream. Was it good? No. \n\nOverall - I think they tried to mix too many different flavors into a dish and it didn't work. \n\nThe wait staff was very attentive. Our waiter kept eyeing our water to make sure it was never empty. I think it's because he knew how much salt goes into each dish!", "author": "Irene C."}

We had the tasting menu that was well done.  Service was good but was not yet fully refined for what I would normally expect in such a nice establishment.

The majority of the food was very good, some were exceptional, and some was average at best.  The grilled cheese and mushroom soup was a standout, while I thought the bread and honey butter was overcooked and rather flavorless.  The lobster pot pie was very good, but the tortellini can be described on as bland.  The desserts were all very good--the pumpkin doughnut was a tasty bit of sweetness, the apple pop had a great cider flavor, and the macaroon was a great way to polish off the meal.  \n\nDining Experience: 5 Stars\nIf you want to enjoy a leisurely, fine-dining experience, Michael Mina is a restaurant for you.  To begin, although the courses were many, the portions were small; as a result, I was continually eating throughout the evening, but I never felt overly full.  The presentation of each and every dish would have been awarded 5 stars on Chopped for creativity.  The presentation of the lobster pot pie was exceptional, and the s'mores dessert was fabulous as well.  The service was also exceptional.\n\nCost-Enjoyment Ratio: 3\nWhile the dining experience at Michael Mina is 5 stars, you certainly pay for it.  I would say that my enjoyment-to-dollar ratio was lower than other restaurants I've been to in SF (e.g., Wayfare Tavern or The House).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-20", "description": "I've been to XIV in LA (now closed, I guess), but this was my first time at his namesake in San Francisco.  I'll admit, I have a weakness for tasting menus, but there's also something nice about his more straight forward and classic menu.  On this night, we couldn't decide between the choices, so we opted for an appetizer and two entrees to share between two of us, and they very nicely separated each dish into two portions with beautiful presentations, so it was as if we had created our own tasting menu.\n\nTo begin, service is impeccable as everyone else notes.  Normally, your napkin gets folded when you stand up for whatever reason; here, they replace it completely with a new napkin, even if you're just standing up to take a photo.  Water is never left empty.\n\nOf the wines, there's a huge selection, including pairing options.  They also have many glasses available, including an impressive by-the-glass section for sparkling wines, which is hard to find.\n\nWe started with an amuse of chilled celery and chestnut soup with a Cowgirl wagon wheel grilled cheese.  The soup was room temperature with just a hint of celery but not the overpowering medicinal taste celery can sometimes have.  Cowgirl wagon wheel was awesome as usual, and it was a nice play on the after school classic of grilled cheese and soup.\n\nBread service tonight was toasted sourdough (toasted with butter already) but served with an amazing side of whipped mascarpone and ricotta topped with honey.  I could have put this spread on anything, and it was hard to stop myself from eating more before the food came. \n\nThe first course we had was seared diver scallops, slightly undercooked in the center.  The more unique part of the dish was the bacon wrapped endive - with the center of the endive, it was more licorice flavored than usual, but it was balanced out with the smokiness and savoriness from the bacon.  The wheatberries added texture to the scallops, though they were a little too crunchy for my tastes.\n\nNext, was the crab ramen.  The dish comes with three parts - a spiced oil to add a kick to the broth if you choose, a bowl of ramen noodles with lots of shelled crab meat and topped with greens, and then lobster pieces (including one tempura piece) atop mushrooms and citrus with an amazing miso butter.  The broth is poured over the noodles - rich yet clear and full of crab flavor and spice without being too salty.  This is probably the best crab broth I've ever had.  All of the crab was shelled and very tender, so it was nice to not have to shell it out yourself.  They did a nice job with the different variations of crab.\n\nThen came the famous lobster pot pie, which is definitely rich.  Market price is $75 for a 1.5lb lobster, but it's on the heavier side, so sharing is actually a good idea.  Ours came with a rectangular crust on the plate, then a side of vegetables including zucchini, squash blossoms, and a puree of sweet corn.  Then, the lobster poached in a tomato cream was poured over, with bits of sweet corn kernels.  Lobster was very tender, and I actually totally preferred this poaching liquid over the traditional fully cream based one.  The broth had tons of lobster flavor, and the crust added a nice texture to the whole dish.\n\nWe were too full for the tempting dessert sampler, but each person receives a complimentary little jar of a sweet treat.  Tonight, it was an orange caramel sponge cake base, layered with coffee cream and crunchy coffee curd - just the right amount to satisfy my sweet tooth.\n\nThe room has high ceilings, and I like the color scheme - my only complaint is the spacing of the tables (the guy swiped my bread knife and plate as he was trying to squeeze between the tables to get into the booth).  Otherwise, it's a great dining experience that lived up to the hype.  Valet is available for $10, though if you come at night, there's plenty of free parking up and down the street (especially on a Sunday).", "author": "Marilyn T."}

A kind anniversary card from the manager was waiting for us at our table. \n\nTruly great customer service is hard to find, but at Michael Mina we really felt like we were valued guests (and we don't look like we are anyone important). All the staff acted like they wanted to deliver the best dining experience for us, and took great pride in their work. They made genuine conversation with us when appropriate, without disturbing the intimacy of our meal. The diner was not flawless, but how the staff resolved issues for us was flawless customer service. As example, we ordered wine, but the sommelier may have forgotten to bring it out by the 3rd dish. I inquired about it, and they apologized up front and comped the bottle for us. They were very professional and caring, when many other businesses would be defensive or apathetic. Comped wine is a much smaller expense than a disappointed customer, and good restaurants know that.\n\nWe chose the chef's tasting menu (about 8 dishes plus dessert for $125/pers), and three hours flew by! The dishes were very unique, with excellent ingredients, beautiful presentation, and you could tell everything was done with care. The basil ice cream, Thai-style lobster, and duck breast were amazing. The shabu shabu dish looked like art and was fun to eat. Compared to tasting menus we did at Gary Danko and Masa, Michael Mina was the best. \n\nHats off to the staff, and hope to dine there soon!", "author": "Scotty N."}

I gobbled it down hoping I wont get sick later for steak dinner later.\nThe tuna tartare was totally bland, seasoned with only sesame oil and a bit of red pepper powder around it, where is the citrus to cut through that grease?\nThe only plate I enjoyed was the pork belly and tenderloin which was also plated nicely.\nBefore the food came my friend ordered a Bluebird cocktail, we waited about 10 minutes while the tables adjacent to us got their drinks first when they ordered after us.Told the waitress once, waited another 5 minutes then had another gentleman come over (looked like the manager) and I told him how long we have been waiting for the drink and he brought us one right away.\nAfter we were done I was told Michael Mina has a Michelin Star, I said really? No way, unacceptable to have a sharp 2\" fish bone in the food. I sent a message directly to HR and notified them that they only gave us the drink for free ( because it look 15+ minutes) and still ended up paying for both Chef's Tasting menus ($55 x 2) I felt bad for my friend who did not even get to finish their plate. Paid and tipped $20 just because we know the servers work hard.  We thought they would take it back and fix the problem but no, it just disappeared never to be seen again.

Just once service hitch when we ordered 3 appetizers, 2 to be shared and one for me.  There wasn't enough room on the table for all of them (which they should have known before they tried to cram everything on the table -- I asked them to take the one I was to eat alone away until we had finished the shared shabu shabu).  Really enjoyed meeting Matthew and Carlo.\n\nThe food was also mostly delightful:\n\nThe ahi tartare was fresh, vibrant and mildly spicy -- same dish they serve as the Seattle RN74.  \n\nThe Japanese A5 Wagyu shabu shabu -- raw, thin slices of beef, submerged into either a hot dashi or hot ponzu sauce at the table and accompanied by a heavenly sesame sauce ... mindblowingly good.  Had we not had more food coming, I would have ordered another of this dish in a heartbeat.\n\nThe duneness crab appetizer was a miss.  While several of the claw pieces were fresh tasting, there were an equal amount of other claw pieces and other crab meat (rolled up) that tasted and smelled fishy.  In addition, not a lot of flavor to the dish.\n\nI had the roasted black cod, sweet and sour pork, spinach, grilled scallions, and japanese sushi rice.  The fish was light and perfectly cooked to medium rare.  The sweet and sour sauce was outstanding.  However, I found the pork (which was cooked sous vide for 36 hours according to the server) to be dry and stringy.\n\nMy husband had the 38 North duck breast cooked to a perfect medium rare, along with asian pear, pickled huckleberries, porcini mushrooms and squash.  It was delicious, but about twice as large a portion as he had just a week earlier (he found last night's to be too large).\n\nI had the Chocolate & Peanut Abstract dessert -- I'm not much of a dessert person, much less chocolate ... this dish is a perfect melding of the softest and creamiest flourless chocolate cake, with perfectly salty peanut butter ganache and crunchy salted peanuts.  Yum!!\n\nMy husband had the Tiramisu in White -- mascarpone, coffee sponge cake, chicory, and benedictine.  He loved it but it had just a bit too much white chocolate flavor to it.\n\nThe reason why we went to dinner here last night was for the little pumpkin doughnuts with cranberry sauce (a gratis apres diner sweet).  My husband went on and on about what a perfect bite it was last week  The ones served last night were good, but cold.  The one he had last week was warm and much better.\n\nThe wine -- they have a special older vintage by the glass on Fridays (flashback fridays) ... it was a 1999 Burgundy that, truthfully, wasn't very good, particularly for $28 a glass.  I have a slight suspicion that they may be uncorking some older vintages that may not be selling so well ... not sure I'd try flashback friday again. Of course, since they're being sold by the glass I would assume that you could ask for a taste to see whether you like it or not.

The reputation of this place is very high caliber.\nWe had 11 of us, first bad move was to put a party that large at the front door. Wind tunnel, not a good start.  \nWe sat for quite a few minutes before meeting our sweetheart of a server. She took our drink orders, and then took our meal orders and then the wait began. I know that they are cooking per order etc, but the place was not even full and it was a good half hour to forty five minutes before we got the first course.  I had the salad that called itself a fruit type of salad, only had 2 halves of an apricot. Sorry, that was an extra on the salad, not big enough to call out on the menu.  My greens were not very crisp, but grilled avocado was a nice touch. I did taste someone else's tuna tartare and true enough, it was delicious.\nThe we waited again.....and the entrees came out. I had the Salmon. If it was all by itself I would say it was over cooked, but with the corn type of salsa it was on, that was lovely to combine all the flavors. But overcooking salmon? That is just not right.\nThen came dessert. We seem to have lost our waitress by then, we could not find her and waited and waited and waited. Then she finally came around and we ordered all three desserts to try them. She brought out almost all of them, then the second to last one came as an after thought and she completely forgot one of them! She did try to make up for it by giving us cookies, but it happens that the person she forgot has been a professional chef, bad move on the waitress's part. \nTruth be told, the desserts were AMAZING!! Custard, yum, chocolate, yum and Bonnie Bouche cheese, delicious.  \nSo, honestly, part of my rating was the lack of attention to us on the server's part was just not what I consider a high end experience. In fact, that weighs in A LOT with me. Secondarily, I did expect something better on the salmon, so I just moved my rating from 2 to 3 stars only because as I read this I sound really harsh. But a 2 hour lunch experience? That is a bit much.\nBut really, I am not a spring chicken, I have had some seriously fine dining, and expected that here, and simply did not get it. What a shame.

It was only three official courses, but as a freshly minted non-teenager, to give you a sense of my restaurant sensibilities, The Cheesecake Factory was oft-considered worthy of a special occasion. So I was admittedly spellbound by the immaculate service, multiple amuse, petite fours, all features of a meal I had up to that point never witnessed.\n\nFour years later, and a hillock of Michelin-starred meals amassed, Michael Mina--now a one-star establishment on California Street in the former Aqua space--would be the relative Lilliput of our four-day vacation.\n\nWith meager expectations, I must say I was generally impressed. I should note that the first 45 minutes of our 3+ hour dinner would be marred be a sozzled woman at the bar who had weaponized her voice with Fran Drescher-like quiddities. Following that, though, service was hiccupless, led by Thomas, our bespectacled captain.\n\nAs for the food, every savory item, from the creamy chicken-black truffle finger sandwich to the flushed medallions of strip steak, proved satisfying. I would return again to try two in particular: (1) an aggressively seasoned roulade (or porchetta) of rabbit fenced in by spring vegetables and (2) and a properly deveined, silky lobe of foie (a dish we added to the tasting menu), the sweetness of which was magnified by hints of vanilla coming from Jordan almonds.\n\nShortly thereafter, alas, with dessert things started to go a bit pear-shaped. These were Hannity desserts: one-dimensional and worryingly unbalanced. One was so boozy, I almost thought it asked me rhetorically, would you like caramel with your whiskey? Given that the restaurant permits a la carte dining, there's no reason not to share several appetizers and entrees before venturing elsewhere for confections.", "author": "Andrew F."}

In a way it was kind of a mistake.  Not that the food was bad, but the fact that it is 9 courses.  Our reservation was at 6 and dinner wrapped up around 9:45.  To put that into perspective, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King was about 20 minutes shorter than the time we spent.  \n\nSince it was 9 courses, I'll just highlight the things that I enjoyed and enjoyed less.  There was an amuse bouche, four bites total, but the one that stood out the most was an uni that reminded me of a risotto made with gouda which was delicious and I never really cared for uni.  The raw fish course offered toro sashimi and the wasabi was ground right there at your table.  The fish course had a really good fried fish in a bowl that dripped down into a patch of pulled pork with sushi rice. I had squab for the first time, and it was really good.  Wagyu beef lives up to its name.  The only thing that I didn't really care for was the bourbon semifredo.  I like bourbon, but when it comes to dessert, I want something sweet and this had a very prevalent bourbon flavor.  The speculoos was delicious though.  If you're not familiar, it's cookie butter.  You can actually find speculoos at Trader Joe's in a jar or a candy bar form.  \n\nThe service was friendly. Grant was our server and he was very attentive as well as the other servers.  My only complaint would be the length between the courses were really long.  \n\nThe bathroom was really nice.  It was candle lit and in a way made me feel like Barry White was going to play over some speakers and I was going to be seduced.  For the first time, I saw that not only did the urinal have a urinal cake at the bottom, but there was a pad on the wall part of the urinal.  Really?! They even make sure that my urine is comfortable? \n\nThe restaurant experience was a good one.  I would recommend doing things ala carte or you'll be there for a while.  The food is good, and the service is friendly.  The food was good, just not 225 a person good.", "author": "Exequiel R."}

All delicious.\n\n*Heirloom tomato and avocado BLT Salad- Glaringly obvious bacon problemo here.  Much to my dismay, the bacon on this salad was the kind that came precooked in a shrink-wrapped package that you can buy off a shelf.  What the eff... y u no use real bacon??\n\n*One of the cuts in the Three Little Pigs (not the cheek, not the belly, so the other one, prob tenderloin) was sooo delicious, I had a wet dream about it the night after.  No sympathy here for the poor poor piggie.\n\n*Service was impeccable.  Interior was beautiful and cozy.  Bathrooms resembled a janitor's closet.  Cocktail list  was full of old school liquor mixed drinks renamed.\n\n*Dessert service was AMAZING.  And by using the word \"amazing\", that means everything was absolutely stellar.  I don't care if you're on a diet or have an ab-photo shoot tomorrow or are 12 ounces away from your lifelong weight goal.  The pastry chef is a dessert/chocolate/all things sweet extraordinaire.

Initially, I was really worried that MM might be overrated and overhyped. But as soon as the amuse bouche was served, my worries were gone. Each dish was spectacular... from the presentation to the well balanced flavor of each dish to the attentive service. The timing between courses was perfect, with just enough time to awe over how amazing the last dish was and to ponder what would come next. Their wine list and cocktail selection paired well with the courses. I definitely recommend getting the pri-fix menu with 6 courses and an amuse bouche to start. \n\nAmuse Bouche: Tomato Soup~ Pt Reyes Toma & Basil Grilled Cheese\n\nCourse 1: Cherry Blossom Cured Kanpachi ~ Umeboshi Puree, Sea Beans, Sesame Cracker\n\nCourse 2: Pan Seared Day Boat Scallop~ Vadouvan Curry, Carrot Puree, Dirty Rice\n\nCourse 3: Crispy Skin Black Bass~ Roasted Beets, Upland Cress, Brown Butter\n\nCourse 4: Pancetta Wrapped Pork Tenderloin & Glazed Pork Belly~ Mission figs, corn pudding, cavolo nero\n\nCourse 5: Brandt Farms Beef Rib Eye & Short Rib~ Grilled FIngerling Potato, Chanterelle Mushrooms, Olive\n\nDessert: Selection of Sweet Bites~ Strawberry Cheesecake w/ pistachio crumbs, Milk Chocolate Honey Lozenge, Brown Sugar Wafers w/ lavender cream\n\nI'm a little disappointed that the infamous lobster pot pie was not one of the courses in the pri-fix menu but I definitely would have to come back next time to try it. \n\nOverall, it was one of the best dining experience I've had to date.

For you other transplant New Yorkers, think Gramercy Tavern. It's warm and modern, has impeccable service without being overly formal, and is busy enough for there to be some buzz in the dining room but quiet enough to have a romantic date. The wine list is long and offers a lot of choices, from more reasonably priced bottles (what I had) all the way up to the $1200 bottles of Harlan Estate.\n\nThe lobster pot pie and the duck were incredible and are apparently, two of the dishes MM is known for. Although the lobster was expensive ($75) it was well worth it. It was a ton of lobster - and the meat was so sweet and buttery - I haven't had lobster like that since I left the East Coast. Mmm mmm good! My husband's duck was amazing as well, and more reasonably priced (mid $30s). We liked both of the appetizers as well, in addition to the adorable grilled cheese/veggie soup amuse bouche and lemon meringue post-dinner palate cleanser.\n\nEverything about Michael Mina just works. The stylish, comfortable decor, the well trained servers, the impeccable food, and the value for your money are all there.

It took a little time to get out drinks, but I think that was due to the confusion of two people waiting on us.  I had the Honey Bee cocktail and it was the best drink I've ever had.  We had the tuna tartar to start and it was divine.  The staff member who prepared it at our table was excellent about telling us about the starter.  I had the suckling pig and it was out of this world.  My friends ordered the trout and they practically licked the bowl.  Unfortunately there was a miss communication in the kitchen so our food took an hour to come out, but the waitress and manager came over and apologized and they comped our drinks.

We got there and we were both very tempted to get the gamut - but neither of us thought we could survive 20 courses. Instead, we opted for the regular chef's tasting menu.\n\nThe food was good to very good. \n\noysters with basil - this was good, but unfortunately I think my piece had too much basil, so it washed out the delicate oyster. My husbands oyster seemed to have less basil and he loved his.\n\n4 hors d'oeuvres - all very tasty, unfortunately can't remember what they were\n\nahi tuna tartare - this was ok, a very generous portion considering it was a tasting menu.

Good, but a little disappointing since it didn't have the kick I was expecting.\n\nsquid ink conchigle - zomg, THIS IS SO GOOD. I wanted a bigger bowl.\n\nshabu shabu - good, but I love shabu shabu in it's purist form so I didn't love it. Made me want actual shabu though.\n\nphyllo crusted snapper - this was by far, my favorite dish. Will definitely order ala cart next time.\n\nduck - the miso pear puree was really tasty and the duck was cooked perfectly. I was so full at this point though that it was tough to eat (first world problems, I know)... Not sure if the portions were just a bit too large but I'll err o the side of I have a small stomach.\n\ndessert - strawberry cheesecake with basil ice cream. BASIL ICE CREAM! So refreshing and the perfect end to the meal. There was some tiny little chocolate pastry to the side too that was nom-able.\n\nThe only mar to the night was actually the hostess. We got in for our res, and she said \"it will be 5 minutes, I want to get you a better table.\" So we wait.. and wait and we notice this big 4 top in the middle of the room, completely empty and ready for people to sit at. When entering the first dining area, it'd literally be the first table. Another couple walks in, she immediately seats them.

The pan seared duo was definitely more to my liking, but the poached one was yum too.\n\nI like the way this restaurant does dessert.

They take traditional food items like pop tarts, street tacos, and corn dogs and transform them to gourmet:  lobster pop tarts, duck tacos with creme fraiche, kimchee aioli.  Ingredients like shiso, ginger, and a myriad of Japanese fruits adorn both the cocktail and food menus.  \n\nBut, of course, there's the all-American classics:  for the amuse bouche, we were served the classiest grilled cheese ever on generously buttered triangles of brioche, alongside a velvety rich potato leek soup.  And the renowned lobster pot pie, a take on provincial chicken pot pie, was phenomenal.  Served deconstructed, each butter poached bite of Maine lobster makes you forget more and more that you're paying market price.  This is the restaurant's signature dish, and for good reason.  \n\nMichael Mina was a wonderful dining experience.  Like his other restaurants, the atmosphere is classy and the servers amazingly unpretentious.  As this is located in the heart of the financial district, this particular restaurant has a bit of a modern stuffy feel.  You can definitely see a lot of suits dining here for a Michelin rated business lunch.  I highly prefer the atmosphere of Mina's Dana Point location, where plantation style windows open to the ocean breeze and breathtaking views, the luxurious drapery rustles slightly from the wind, and fittingly contemporary music like Jack Johnson plays subtly in the background.

Haven't been that disappointed in a meal in a long time. Started with the Australian Bluefin Toro, that evidently had been caught a few months ago. My first bite contain a large bone and cartilage. I have never had that happen in sushi before. Total lack of focus by the chef. This was a 5:30 dinner and they weren't busy. The \"truffle pasta\" which was $20/gram was small and barely offered a taste for 2 even though we purchased 2 grams. Not sure how they charge by the gram and not weigh it at the table. Guess it's a trust me scenario.  The ribeye was fair and the portion was good enough for a 2nd grader.  If you are going to charge $52 it better be off the wall great.  Not even close to the quality of Bourbon Steak.  They served a shot glass dessert from the chef. A lemon cream something, unfortunately it had Chinese pine nuts included which i'm terribly allergic. It leaves a metallic taste in your mouth for days.  You would think they would use Italian Pine nuts and not get the big bag from Costco of the Chinese variety. For those who don't know about this, check it out, it's pretty common.\nThere are about 200 restaurants better in SF than this overpriced \"mecca\".

Last night we dined at Michael Mina's current San Francisco restaurant and chose the tasting menu again, an act of misplaced optimism. The portions were  well prepared but minute; for example, the squid course was three tiny pieces of squid body and one cluster of legs from a very small squid. The presentations were complex and sometimes puzzling; the seaweed accompanying two little oysters looked like a salad but proved to be just decoration. The service was chaotic; one young man carefully introduced himself as  our waiter and never appeared again.

Sadly, I don't think any of us were as wow'd as we were hoping to be.  Overall, there was much left to be desired in terms of food, but there were a few highlights in the meal.\n\nFood:\nI've had better. The foie gras was flavor-less and too gelatinous, but that may just be a personal preference. The lack of flavor, however, really revealed the oiliness of the foie gras. Not appetizing at all - I actually couldn't even finish it. The branzino was good, but I didn't think the flavors in the plate were integrated. Instead of \"yummy fish with artichoke!\" I got \"yummy fish! oh and there's some yummy artichoke on the side too!\" Other people in the group mentioned that their dishes weren't that great either, although I don't know the specifics. The highlight of the meal was the black bean soup and mini grilled cheese sandwich that we got as an amuse bouche.  \n\nService & Ambiance:\nEverybody at the restaurant was extremely nice and welcoming.  I absolutely LOVE the huge mirrors and windows they have in the restaurant as well as the high ceilings. My only complaint is that well everybody had good intentions, their follow-through could use some work. For example, they would replace dinner napkins when a person left to use the restroom. But one of my friends got his napkin taken away, but never replaced. Also, I never got my amuse bouche because I was in the restroom when it was served to my table.

I don't know what the final tally was, but I'm sure it was quite high and we overpaid for the meal and service.\n\nFirst of all, the entire stay, from seating through drinks, appies, dinner, and dessert, took 4 1/2 hours, much of which was constituted by long delays between drinks and having our orders taken, between ordering and receiving our food, and in between appetizers and entrees. I'm a fan of slow dining, but this took that to a new high (or low...). \n\nThe food quality was ok at best. I tried the abalone, duck, some beef, and the deconstructed lobster pot pie. The duck and a beef were served quite room temp. If that was the goal, fine, but neither was very savory or captured the essence of the meat. Desserts were ok, but I don't remember any of them.\n\nOn our departure we were given a small treat in a cellophane bag, described as, \"Just our version of a s'more.\" It was horrendous, mushy, and generally tasted like  leftover tiramisu. I would have preferred a deconstructed s'more - a graham cracker, uncooked marshmallow, and a Hershey bar.\n\nIn general, the presentation was choppy - all of the dishes were described in intricate detail, but the descriptions sounded like recitations rather than explanations of why the food was assembled the way it was. Some of the dishes had elaborate table-side preparation / presentations - e.g. the pot pie and the tuna tartare. Again, both of these seemed theatrical rather than functional (when in fact, the opposite was quite true).\n\nAll in all, the emphasis at MM is in form over function, visuals over tastes, and heartless performance over emotional connection. Very disappointing.", "author": "Jeff M."}

My date and I did a la carte because she's a vegetarian (who will eat fish sometimes) and the prix fixe menu did not appeal to us.  We started with the tuna tartare or \"the dish that built Michael Mina\" as our server called it.  The flavors in this dish are excellent and I highly recommend trying it if you're a newbie to Michael Mina.  For mains, we had the Lobster Pot Pie and the Duck.  The duck was excellent - very tender and perfectly cooked.  The Lobster Pot Pie was good, but the sauce was very strong on the califlour.  The dessert sampler was both creative and tasty - another recommendation for first timers.\n\nThe service was good, but the Sommelier was weird.  Just plain odd... He may have been the most socially awkward person I've met in the service industry.  I tried to have a dialogue with him on the wine list and it was like pulling teeth.  I eventually extracted a recommendation from him that turned out very well - the man knows his stuff... He's just weird.\n\nMy only real complaint was the price.  The Lobster Pot Pie was $75.

The space is like a cafeteria---loud, open, and crowded.  My poor friend had someone literally sit on her lap as they were trying to finagle their way out of the booth.  \n\nNow onto the service.  After my friend and I scanned the menu we realized we weren't going to like any of the appetizers, so we decided just to get entrees.  When we declined on appetizers the waiter automatically began treating us like crap.  Look buddy, we didn't like the menu, so if I don't want an appetizer it doesn't give you the right to scoff at us and then proceed to continually ignore us for the rest of our meal.  \n\nFinally, and most importantly, the food.  The best part of the meal was the amuse bouche.  Yeah, the free part.  It was a small grilled cheese with braised short ribs and cream of asparagus soup with parmesan foam.  It. was. delicious.  On the flip-side, our entrees were disgusting.  Who the hell sous vides a boneless, skinless chicken breast?  It had the weirdest texture and no taste.  It was seriously one of the most awful pieces of chicken I've eaten in ages.  The pork was equally depressing.  That's right, depressing.  I didn't think any \"5 star\" restaurant could mess up what I consider to be the best gift to man-kind, but the chefs at Michael Mina cannot, and I repeat, can not cook pig.  And the crispy pig ears?  They were drowned in salt and down-right inedible.  \n\nAnd if you have the misfortune of ordering the braised pork, tell the chefs to leave the green polenta off the plate.  Just keep it the hell away from you.  The green polenta tasted like wet, soggy, rotten tortillas that had been left to ferment in gym socks under a dumpster in Tijuana.  \n\nAnd finally, to the chefs at Michael Mina---please use salt and pepper.

Our servor Allison was impeccable.  I never found my table too cluttered or my water glass half empty, the changing of napkins can get a little annoying every time you leave your table, but I can definitely get use to it.\n\nWith that said and done, the food does NOT speak volumns.  \n\nAmuse-bouche: shot of corn chowder and bite size grilled cheese - SERIOUSLY?  This is not a 5 year old's science project!!! CUTE does NOT equate tasty!\n\nFirst: Tuna Tartare, what can I say, I have seen tuna tartare done thousands of times before and this was nothing special.  The way it was platted was also disappointing, the showcasing of fish was monotonic and what I would call boring.  Josiah Citrin does an amazing medley of tuna [fish] generally at Melisse that FAR SURPASSES this place!\n\nSecond: Lobster in Corn ravioli, I quite enjoyed this course, it was interesting enough to look and eat.  The lobster was cooked to perfection and the corn pockets were the perfect accent.\n\nThird: Salmon, I thought this was HORRIBLE!!!  I can't believe this was a course, and the way it was cooked demonstrated a lack of skill and care.  The salmon was wet and tasteless, I was utterly disappointed!!\n\nFourth: Duck which was quite enjoyable as well, however, again, problems with plating, there is some confusion as to how it should be eaten and in what oder, but with that said, it was pefectly cooked.\n\nFifth: Sirloin, it was great, as I would expect, but again, I have seen and tasted better.  \n\nIf you want a true dining adventure and experience, I WOULD NOT recommend this place.  The food DOES NOT compare to other michelin star restaurants I have visited in Los Angeles; I continually rave about Josiah Citrin, who I still believe til this day has the best tasting menu!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-06-11", "description": "Had a phenomenal dinner at Michael Mina over the weekend for my birthday celebration. Everything blew me out of the water with the decor, service, and food. \n\nFirstly, MM is at the old Aqua space, which I got the chance to visit several years ago before it closed, and I can only remember that it was the best seafood restaurant in the city. With the reputation of MM, my expectations were fairly high. \n\nThe space is quite beautiful, just as I remember it at Aqua. The space is modern, but inviting and unpretentious. The waitstaff is definitely top notch and everyone was extremely knowledgeable and attentive. We had 2 servers for the evening, Michelle and Thomas. Both were extremely friendly and courteous, I have to give my hats to Thomas, he is one of THE MOST friendliest servers you can ever meet, beyond being our server, he would stop by to chit chat for a little bit which really made us welcome and at home. Unfortunately, my girlfriend felt sick midway through dinner (might have been the mix of pisco and wine and the one of the cheese dishes), but they offered various drink remedies and ginger ale, which was an extremely kind gesture. I would definitely come back for service alone, but fortunately, its not the only reason to come back to MM for. \n\nThe menu is somewhere of an inbetween of East vs West with a hard focus on fresh ingredients (and it even shows in the kitchen). We first started off with the hors d'oeuvres, which were absolutely worth the $16 pp, the cherry foie gras torchon was amazing along with the beef tartare and the beef heart. Really impressive first dish. \n\nNext I had the beef shabu shabu which was really good and was very interactive. They make you cook your raw ingredients in the broth and after finishing, they pour the broth in a cup for you to finish (the dashi broth is amazing BTW). I've had shabu shabu, and this certainly doesn't necessarily \"top\" other shabu shabu, it was a solid dish and made the dining experience fun. My girlfriend had the trio of salmon, which was okay, the panna cotta was definitely unique, but I definitely wouldn't have cared for it the next time. I also think the amount of cheese they put in the dish might have made my girlfriend's stomach turn a little bit. My advice is to skip the salmon dish. \n\nFor our entree, I had the trio of lamb, which was excellent. Tasted more like beef than lamb, the saddle was perfectly cooked and fatty as was the beef shoulder. The sweetbreads didn't taste much like sweetbreads, so that was the only forgettable part of the dish. My girlfriend was still feeling ill at this point, but was starting to feel better and at least got to eat her foie gras and the duck dumpling. I got to try her dish and it was definitely one of the best duck dishes out there. Really top notch even though I didn't have, definitely ordering it next time! \n\nBy dessert, my girlfriend was feeling a lot better and so we shared the dessert sampler together. Can't say much about the dessert tasting, except that its a MUST ORDER and it was really fun to taste all the different desserts. \n\nAt the end of dinner we got to tour the awesome kitchen and the prep rooms. Really neat! They have an indoor \"garden\" which they snip fresh veggies from, really impressed by how fresh their ingredients are! \n\nOverall, the meal at Michael Mina exceeds many fine dining destinations in the bay area that are higher rated (better than Fleur De Lys & Gary Danko IMO). It is certainly an expensive meal and definitely special occasion status, but I'll definitely be coming back, especially for that lobster pot pie that looked phenomenal... Hats off to Mr. Mina, you deserve a 28 on Zagat and maybe another Michelin Star", "author": "Justin L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-04-07", "description": "Wow....\n\nAnd I don't mean in a good way.\n\nWhen anyone hears the words \"Michael Mina\" everyones thinks benchmark of restaurants.  The peak of what other restaurants strive for.  If this were the case everyone would stay home and eat in.....\n\nService was \"average\" at best.\n\nThe ambiance was nice.  However, it was fail with the cafeteria tables and chinaware.\n\nLike with any restaurants you can fail with service and ambiance but if the food is great you don't mind spending the extra money.\n\nUnfortunately the food failed also.\n\nLet's begin with the appetizers.  We tried out the Tuna Tartar and the Dungeness Crab Dish.  When they brought out the Tuna the first thing came to mind (after we talked when the servers left) is what in the world....  First of all the actual food maybe encompassed 1/4 of the plate.  Then for presentation they mixed the ingredients in front of you.  Sorry it felt awkward with the wait staffs arms in our personal space. The tartar was served with what looked like toasted \"Wonderbread\" without the crust.  Couldn't they at least serve it with toasted baguette slices??? The dish itself bland.  The Crab also encompassed 1/4 of the plate.  To be fair they split the entree so we didn't have to share off the same plate.  However,  shouldn't you then serve it on smaller plates so it wouldn't look so void of food?  Crab, no flavor and again bland.....\n\nMain course.  The Beef Filet & Shortribs and Jidori Chicken Breast dishes.  Ummm... presentation again horrible.  Food was luke warm Beef and chicken dishes also bland.  Like the tuna presentation they mixed everything in front of you.  But since I didn't know that there was a presentation I was looking at my chicken dish and thought they expect me to eat this????  \n\nAt this junction the host came to our table and asked how our diner was.  I couldn't lie.  I said we were very unimpressed.  \n\nAs a saving grace he said he would love if we would stay to try our dessert tasting platter on them.  Reluctantly we accepted thinking we would be further disappointed.  Guess what.  It was the nail on the coffin.  One of the presentations looked like the \"left over\" crumbs I had in a baking pan after I made brownies.\n\nSo let me end with this thought.  In a good/great restaurant most guests take a bite of their meals and moan in pleasure or let their dinner partners know how fabulous their meal is and that you have to try!  On looking around the restaurant this was not going on.  There were just diners having conversation and just \"eating\".  A metaphor I might use is like watching cows graze hillside eating \"bland\" grass and letting out an occasional moo....\n\nTruly a disappointment.", "author": "Rigs R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-26", "description": "First, let me say that I hate yuppie, hipster \"scenes\", especially \"scenes\" in San Francisco. Maybe I'm just protective of a city my family's been a part of since 1929, but I digress. I recently (and grudgingly) went to Michael Mina's restaurant in the Financial District, and I had worked myself up physically and mentally to be prepared for some of the attitudes I've been running across lately at San Francisco restaurants. You know the ones, you walk in and it's like a scene from some old Western when the sheriff walks into the saloon --i.e., everything STOPS, he gets the stare down, and then things (cautiously) fall back in order. \n\nSo, I'm set for this little ritual in some of the other \"fine\" restaurants I've been in. (I guess the appearance of a real-live African American in San Francisco is so scarce that some folks liken it to a white rhinoceros sighting.)\n\nI dashed to meet my party at the restaurant and was a little early, so I knew that I would have to break camp at their bar. Luckily, one other person from my party was already there, so the bar wait wasn't so bad. \n\nI can happily report that Michael Mina's restaurant is the bomb. \n\nFirst, the staff is diverse. You walk in and it looks like San Francisco used to look in regards to diversity. Asian, Black, white, multiracial, Latino, etc. \n\nStaff and bartenders are knowledgeable, friendly, and understand the hospitality industry --impeccably. \n\nThe bartenders, host staff, sommeliers, and wait staff are young and dewy, but their hospitality skills are \"old school\" service. They understand that the guest is just that, the guest. They are devoid of the nastiness popping up in a lot of recent restaurants as they don't second and triple guess you, they explain the meal to each guest (not just the white guests), they are open and sophisticated at the same time. (And a little flattering of the guests will go a long way.)\n\nI've been in restaurants where the host assumes that you are either there to ask for directions or you're going to rob them.\n\nTHIS IS NOT THE CASE AT MICHAEL MINA.\n\nThe host/hostess actually smiles when you walk in and treats you like a human being. \n\nWhen we were finally seated at our table, the sommelier seemed to be doing double duty without it being obvious like, \"What's the sommelier doing seating me?\" It was his gesture of service and hospitality --or he was flirting. I couldn't figure out which, and that's a good thing.\n\nAn excellent sign that the restaurant is a well oiled machine is the staff's ability to step in without asking (or assuming that tables have invisible electric fences that they can't cross) and creating a seamless stream of service.\n\nMichael Minna's does that.\n\nWe had a pretty knowledgeable group of guests, but some were a little leery about eating raw tuna and others had questions about portions, etc. The staff kindly answered questions without the least bit of condescension which put guests at ease very quickly. \n\nWe were so at ease that we probably purchased their entire wine cellar.\n\nThe food was excellent and prepared skillfully. Michael Mina's much better with the fish dishes, especially the Tuna tartare, but you have to really like raw fish to appreciate it. The beef was also delicious, through the short ribs were so rich that I got a little gag-y. I'm not a super, buttered down food person, so when food is overly buttered or drenched in fat, I have a gag reflex. No joke. \n\nAlso, I'm not a foie gras or baby-animal person (except for eggs), so I'm not a fan of either and didn't order it. Those who ordered the lamb and/or foie gras said it was good. \n\nSince we were there for a birthday party, Michael Mina sent out a complimentary \"deconstructed apple pie\" with creme fraiche which was tasty and thoughtful.\n\nThe desserts were yummy and not overly sweet and cloying --they were rich though.\n\nCaveat is that all of this wonderful service and food is gonna cost you a grip, but if you want to treat yourself or treat someone to something special, make it a point to go on a jumping weeknight or Friday night.\n\nThey have valet parking if you absolutely must drive, but the restaurant is within two blocks of BART and Market Street buses, and cabs are ample.", "author": "Adrienne A."}

Our table had the tasting menu and wine pairing. The food was all quite good. All the dishes were well prepared, expertly plated, and showed skill in combining the flavors. My only criticism, and it is really more a challenge to the staff, is that in all the courses there wasn't the \"wow\" factor you find in top restaurants from time to time. There wasn't one dish where I thought \"how did they do that\", or \"what a creative idea with technique or flavor\". I certainly don't expect that often, but usually I find that in one of the courses in a chef's tasting menu at a great restaurant.\n\nWhere I thought the meal shined was that the wine pairings were spot on, with flavors in the glass going beyond an accompaniment, and truly bringing out the flavors on the plate. Perhaps the \"wow\" factor wasn't on the plate, but was left to the synergy of the pairings. \n\nThe deserts following the dinner were all good, and consistent with the meal.\n\nThe setting was very nice; and works well for the space. Still, something seemed missing in the ambience, it's subtle and I can't quite articulate it, but I felt it.  \n\nMy simple test of whether I love a restaurant or not is based on how eager I am to return. Some places are without a doubt \"must go again!\" It's not about price, it's about the experience. My meal at Michael Mina was very good, but the trouble is, I'm just not that excited to return.\n\nThe price at Michael Mina is on par with Gary Danko and Quince. These are great restaurants.

I entered the restaurant and asked for my party.  The couldn't seem to find the reservation under any of my party's name-- I looked at a glance and didn't see anyone.  Finally they located the table.  The host seemed to be rather non-welcoming, nonchalant.  \n\nBut persistance is everything.  I sat down and was immediately offered Pierre Peters Champagne--which was over flowing--and that was such a great way to start any meal.\n\nI started off with the Shellfish Trio which was a gorgeous presentation--and in fact could have been slightly smaller and accomplished what it set out to do.  The Shellfish Trio's peak of interest for me was the Maine Lobster followed by oysters and shrimp and crab Ceviche.  Just the right quantity and perfect way to start a meal.\n\nI tried the \"middle\" dish--a Brentwood corn Souffl\u00e9 crawfish cream, espellete pepper.  I am always concerned about the egg overpowering the remaining portion of the dish--that is would I be able to detect the corn?  Yes, well balance of flavours and nothing over powered the next component.\n\nMy second dish was Wild Alaska Halibut; I wanted this dish to be light and lyrical and it was much more balanced that I expected.  I loved the highly flavourful dumplings-- completely creative and delightful.\n\nThe plating was beautiful, the service was proud, consistent and good.

(What's up with cabs in SF?  But I digress.)  Although we were late, the host sent us to the bar.  When we declined drinks, our table was suddenly ready.  That was the only thing we disliked.  I usually like to get the wine pairings so I don't want to start with a cocktail on top of all that, and my husband doesn't drink alcohol at all, so we don't enjoy cooling our heels at the bar, especially when we're hungry. \n\nOther than our brief bar exile, service was excellent with food and  wine pairings arriving at the right time along with helpful descriptions and all of our needs anticipated and met. All of the staff were charming, especially our waiter and the host.\n\nThe room is stunning.  There was buzz, but not so much that we could not carry on a private conversation.  The table was sizeable and we had plenty of space around us.\n\nAs at most of the other dinners we had, we went for the chef's tasting menu and were delighted that we did.  The food is superb. There was not one false note as the courses progressed.   Course size was just right as were the wine pourings.  \n\nWe felt that it was an excellent value for the price, certainly not cheap, but worth it.\n\nNext time we visit SF, this will be the first reservation we make.", "author": "Barbara M."}

More often than not after a mediocre or terrible meal, I grumble and vouch that I am going to write a review but even the worst of the restaurants have yet to motivate me to write a review. Tonight, our dinner experience at Michael Mina was so singularly outstanding that I am actually inclined to finally pick up the pen.  BF made reservations here and I was a quite skeptical at first, given some of the dubious reviews and only 4 stars for a \"nice\" restaurant and the fact that there are a bunch of other nice restaurants with higher ratings that are still on my list. But, I thought, might as well get it over since we would eventually try it sooner or later anyway. \n\nWe were at first seated at the usual tiny two person table interposed between two larger tables, but asked if we could sit next to each other and given a comfy corner booth which was perfect, away from the main dining area and much more private. \n\nWe also asked to only get one tasting menu and one entree, and the chef agreed, which was very accommodating as most other places require both diners to get the tasting menu. \n\nNot only was each dish perfectly cooked and seasoned, which is the minimal expectation for a nice restaurant (but even then not necessarily accomplished), but each was far more creative with both use of ingredients and presentation than many other tasting menus that we have tried at other fancy restaurants. \n\nSuffice to say that the meal was delicious in its entirety, and plus the portions were actually very generous and towards the end of the meal we were wondering how many more dishes were coming out since we were already quite full.  We actually even wondered whether it's possible that they made each dish larger since we were sharing a tasting menu, since the portions were so generous. \n\nOf course, the most important part of the meal was the food itself, but I would also add that for those who care about service, the service was also great, and all the staff were friendly and attentive. \n\nYes, I would recommend! :)", "author": "Christine C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-06", "description": "I'm not as pretentious as you'd assume by rating 4 stars.  It's simply because I love food and if I leave a restaurant hungry, I'm not happy.  They recently changed their notorious \"small plates\" fixed menu, to regular style dining, which I wasn't happy about.  Simply that now you just have to order a bunch of regular menu items, which are still very small.  Brilliant financial decision on their part.  Unfortunate for the diners. We can all presume Michael Mina knows his food... and he does.  Their ahi appetizer seemed to be the highlight of appetizers as I looked around and noticed almost everyone ordered it.  It did have a very fresh and unique spin on the ahi, but I believe it's popularity is mostly due to the side service you get when you order it, (the server makes it, table side), and Americans like being waited on.  Just as table side guacamole is extremely popular in Mexican restaurants... is it really about the guacamole?  Would you order it if it already came prepared from the kitchen?  \nAny way, the scallops were amazing.  I couldn't even talk to my date, whom I dine with frequently, so he knew better than to talk to me when my eyes were closed.  He ordered the flank steak, which completely took me by surprise.  Why the hell would Mike put flank steak on his menu?  Ohhhh, because he's genius.  It was amazing.  And I can't even tell you why, the flavor was perfect.  The s'mores dessert was the biggest let down of the dinner... there was no \"smoky\" campfire flavor.  The shit was burnt.  Like, burnt flavor.  Our stuffy waiter was taken back when I told him to taste it, since he didn't seem to believe me.  The white chocolate dessert was beautiful, creative, delicate and perfect.  We sat right next to the extremely oversized window, which made it feel like we were dining outside, it was fun.  I really enjoyed my time at Mr. Mina's restaurant, I just needed to eat afterwards.", "author": "Erin B."}

It was a nice treat for us.  I was a little nervous because the gift card was for the old location and I wanted to use it ASAP in case they wouldn't accept it in the future... I'm not good with gift cards since I have an AQUA gift card still! Ironically, Michael Mina is in the old AQUA location.\n\nWe had reservations for 6:30 but arrived early since there was no traffic.  We were seated right away.  The ambiance of the new location is so much different from the last.  It is more contemporary and modern.  The menu style has also changed.  Instead of choosing 3 or 4 courses, it is more a la carte now.  There is a choice of doing the chef's tasting menu, but you do not know what is on the menu.  I noticed that a few tables around us were doing it, and even they didn't get the same items.  We opted for A la Carte.\n\nWe were given a chestnut soup with truffle foam  and a grilled cheese with Point Reyes cheese as our amuse bouche, it was really good especially coming in from such a cold night.  We were then spoiled with bread along with a honey and ricotta mix to spread on it.  We started off sharing the hors dourves course that consisted of four bite size treats: a foie gras pb & j, steak tartare, a crab blt, and what was supposed to be a smoked trout but I think we got a salmon with caviar eggs on top instead? not sure but it tasted like salmon and looked like salmon.  For starters, I had the pork belly and geoduck salad.  It was really good!  It had a curry sauce with it and butter nut squash cubes.  Yum.  For my entree, I went with the lobster pot pie.  I've been thinking about the Lobster Pot Pie since the last time I dined at Michael Mina.  They changed it up a bit but it still was really good.  For dessert, they don't have a typical dessert menu.  Instead there is a dessert sampler which had 7 different tastings, we both opted to try it and it was just okay.  Nothing really wow'ed me, I would skip it the next time.\n\nIt was a great meal, the service is always wonderful and so attentive.   I would definitely come back again.", "author": "Kymberli C."}

We had made reservations for 8:30 on a Friday night and arrived at about 8:25.  The table wasn't quite ready so we had drinks at the bar while we waited.  I ordered a glass of prosecco, my sister a martini and my brother had a beer.  I was struck by the chilliness of the bartenders.  Ours, in particular, appeared very distant and didn't come back to check on us after he served us (bringing us all of our drinks at different times, instead of all at once like he should have).  This turned out to be the theme of the evening.  \n\nFor such a well-reputed restaurant, I was struck with the awful service at Michael Mina.  Our table was in the main dining room and while the room is elegant and comfortable, it is very loud.  Our waitress seated us and we eagerly began browsing the menu.  When we were ready,  we all looked up and no waitress.  Okay, it's a Friday night and she's busy, we said to each other.  We waited some more.  And then some more.  Finally, we had to flag down a bus boy to get her attention.  We ordered a myriad of appetizers and more drinks.  When the waitress came back to pour my brother's  beer she literally just held the glass up and poured.  LOL.  I don't even drink beer but even I know that you're suppose to tilt the glass before pouring.  He had about two inches of beer and five inches of foam in his glass.  Sigh.  Good thing the beautiful and tasty appetizers arrived at this point.  They did not disappoint.  Guess what happened when we finished the appetizers?  We waited some more.  At this point,  we became frustrated because we all knew what we wanted as mains.  The lobster pot pie!  Finally, we ordered and at $70 each, they were delicious.  The generous portion of lobster meat was cooked perfectly and the medley of vegetables that accompanied it were coated perfectly in the white sauce.  The crust was flakey and baked to perfection.  The precision of the food was amazing.  The service was not.  I won't bore you further with how long we waited for the dessert menu, then to order, then for our check, etc.  \n\nThe food here is definitely amazing but our experience with the service was awful.  At a $400 plus for a fine dining establishment, this is not acceptable.  I even called and left a message with the manager to inquire about the service that night and if it was an oddity.

I went on opening week at their new location on California Street.  The menu is much simpler now, a bunch of shared starter platters (priced and portioned per person), appetizers and then mains.  They also offer two tasting menus, one at the bar and one at the tables.  We decided to go A la carte instead of the tasting menu since the waiter was rather vague as to what would be on there.  \n\nMy favorites for the the evening were definitely the appetizers.  The foie gras was amazing and came with a buckwheat crepe and some kind of foam accompaniment.  The tuna tartare and hamachi crudo were both prepared nicely and very fresh.  The pork belly was good but I found it did not mesh well with the geoduck.  For mains, my beef rib eye was the standout dish, it was perfectly seared, tender and juicy.  The lamb and fish entrees were good as well but did not carry that wow factor.  The lobster pot pie ($70) was not your traditional pot pie but actually a deconstructed version of the dish that they plate table side.  \n\nFor the desert portion of the meal there is no menu.  You either state you want desert or not and they bring you a desert tasting prepared by the pastry chef.  The only drawback is that is it all or nothing, the whole table must get it if one person decides they want it.  Our waiter made an exception for us and allowed us to order two portions to share.  \n\nService was really lacking for a restaurant of its caliber.  It seems like the waitstaff was all new and not a carryover from the old location.  There was a lot of waitstaff standing idle andt they all seemed a bit lost and had no clue how to streamline dinner service.  This was clearly evident as silverware was forgotten and the dishes that required the waiter to do table side presentation were awkwardly presented. \n\nMaybe it wasn't a good idea to visit on opening week; while the food was outstanding the overall experience was just slightly above average.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-22", "description": "For a restaurant that was once awarded two Michelin stars, service should be everything and unfortunately, this place lacks it. The moment we walked in, I felt the vibe that we were being profiled. Empty tables were scattered around the beautiful dimmed room but instead of seating us at a comfortable area, we were seated right in front of the door. Yes, we felt the San Francisco breeze every time someone walked in or walked out of the restaurant. Not so comfortable. \n\nOur waiters were some what helpful and credits to them for giving their best effort, but as Bradley T. mentioned, they aren't so competent when it comes to the menu. One even nervously admitted to me that it was his first time explaining the details of the entree I ordered- the signature dish: Lobster Pot Pie.\n\nNow, onto the dishes! Quality of food was fine; I'd rate it somewhere between mediocre and excellent. I am not being bias; my rating for the food has nothing to do with their service. \n\nFor starters we shared:\n-Hamachi Crudo- my favorite out of all starters. Served with small slices of green apple, giving that mixture of sweet and savory, soft and crispy taste. \n\n-Pork belly & Geoduck clam\n\n-Foie Gras & Pineapple- My cousing claims their foie gras beats GD's.\n\n-Tuna tartare\n\nEntr\u00e9e:\n-Five Seas- a variety of fishes cooked in several ways, served with a side of nishiki rice. The Black cod was a bit too salty for our table, but overall most of the fishes were cooked and seasoned well. \n\n-Prather Ranch Farms Lamb Chop- Nothing special, it was mediocre. Can't fail with lamb chop right? A little salt, a little pepper, some special house sauce, put if over the fire and whaa-la! \n\n-Maine Lobster Pot Pie- So glad I've ordered this dish. I've heard many great reviews about this dish and the reviews really owned up to its raves. The lobster was not dry or rubbery, it was tender and buttery. The pie crust was flaky and pairs well with the creamy gravy lobster sauce. The corn salad and roasted tomatoes gave the dish a sweet and tangy kick which keeps the appetite refreshed, for the entr\u00e9e can be a bit rich. \n\nI know there was one more entr\u00e9e our table ordered, but I  had forgotten the name, it was a rib eye steak and the meat was tender and juicy. Cooked to medium rare with (bone marrow sauce?), and served with side of potatoes and some sort of a cole slaw. Delicious! My 2nd favorite entr\u00e9e after the lobster pot pie.\n\nDessert was a sampler, there were a combination of chocolate and fruity sweets. Didn't have a favorite for any, we were just picking at every single one. We all agreed that we  wouldn't order it again, but we can at least say we've tried it. \n\nAll in all, I give Michael Mina 3 stars for my experience.", "author": "Jenny K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-01", "description": "I'm really particular about my 5 star ratings, as I expect the best, with no flaws in order to give a 5 star. \n\nI see the many complaints that this restaurant was given, but as the biggest concern I've seen was that the restaurant was loud, I didn't mind it. The clamor filled space was perfect for me, as it brought a great ambiance to the place. I definitely wouldn't want to hear silence or whispering when visiting a place for known for it's food and ambiance. The sounds of \"Delicious\", \"Wow\", and \"Excellent\" filled the air in this place, and to me, that's a good thing. So I won't be deducting anything for noise, as I was still able to have a conversation without raising my voice. \n\nMy boyfriend took me here for my 25th birthday dinner. I had been dying to go here, so he flew me up from Los Angeles, and surprised me when we rolled up to the new venue which was once at the Hotel St. Francis in Union Square. \n\nOur reservations were at 8, and we were seated immediately. Our table was perfect, which was next to the massive window overlooking the streets. On the table was a note from the Ma\u00eetre D', which wished me a Happy Birthday. That was a very pleasant surprise. \n\nThe waitress, who was sweet, polite, insightful and wished me a happy birthday, suggested a pre-dinner champagne, and it was immediately sent upon our request. her suggestion was perfect as we wanted a light, fruity champagne that wasn't too dry. Well done. \n\nAs we couldn't decide what to order (everything sounded delicious), we opted for the chef's tasting menu and wine pairing. I was ready to be blown away... and I was. \n\nWe were started off with a shot, I wasn't  sure what was in it, but it went down so smoothly (I am not one for hard liquor, so this was incredible). Then for our amuse bouche, we received a miniature grilled cheese with prosciutto and potato soup that was creamy, and delicious. Definitely a great way to start to the meal. \n\nThe bread and the ricotta and honey spread that came out was also divine. The bread was toasted perfectly, and brushed with olive oil. The ricotta and honey spread was sweet and savory and tasted great with the bread. \n\nThe first dish was paired with sake. \n\nhamachi crudo : So delicious! The fish was fresh and the zing from the sauce was perfect. It wasn't too overdressed and everything blended well together!\n\nWhite wine pairing...\n\ndungeness crab  tortellini: Creamy, well balanced. Not fishy. You could taste the crab, and the hint of lemon zest. The blood orange added a perfect tangy treat to cleanse the palette. So delicious, it was my favorite dish of the night!\n\nWhite wine pairing...\n\nduo of crispy fish: This duo was delicious! The grilled and fried fish were perfectly salted, perfect coated and perfectly cooked. The sauces provided blended well together giving a unique Thai taste, without tasting like fast-food Thai. It was perfect. Although my least favorite dish (but it was still oh-so-good). \n\nRed wine pairing...\n\nduck: This wasn't on the menu, but it was the most perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked duck. Duck is tricky as it is very gamy and when cooked poorly tastes...horrible. This is by far the best duck I have eaten in my life. Incredible!\n\nRed wine pairing...\n\nbeef filet & short rib: The filet was tender, pink in the middle and divine. The short rib boasted intense flavors and the two paired together were nothing short of perfect. I love meat, and this insanely delicious!\n\nFor dessert, we got a dessert wine.\n\nPassion Fruit Panna Cotta: Such a surprisingly refreshing dessert! I loved this one!\n\nChocolate lozenge: Delicious! Chocolate and honey. Melted in my mouth!\n\nMarble cake: Surprise birthday cake they gave me! So divine! Loved this!\n\nApple Pie bite: It wasn't a pie, but more like apple cinnamon crumbs, cream, and something else. I finished this in 1 second...it was so damn good and tasted like apple pie.\n\nThe food was UNBELIEVABLE. \n\nThe service was EXQUISITE. \n\nEvery dish, a different server brought it, and explained it and wished me a happy birthday!\n\nIt was VERY impressive. \n\nEvery wine, a different server, who explained the origin and flavors of the wine and also wished me a happy birthday!\n\nI felt special, I felt happy, I had a delicious meal with excellent drinks, with an amazing person, with exceptional service. \n\nI was definitely not let down. \n\nI would definitely go back!

Not sure what happened - like many other reviewers it remains a mystery how a 2-star Michelin restaurant turned into a place that cannot be recommended even for a quick dinner.\n\n\nThe hors d'oevres (means out/side of work) are way out in the left field. In fact the sous chef in charge should be out of work. They were minute and while not too bad - also not any good.\n\nThe steak - did someone say steak? - was a concoction of four little pieces of so-so meat - rib eye -  (goulash meat at least by size).

New York Strip for the same price. \n\nDesert - I love deserts but these were just too sweet without any interesting flavor.\n\nEspresso was cold, sour -and over-extracted -  but that is to be expected in an average $$$$-restaurant; they don't clean their espresso machines, use stale beans and don't know how to pull a decent shot.\n\nThe crew was just not up to the task - not their fault; they tried hard but are just not the right team.\n\nAdd noise, music too loud, ugly china, no dark napkins for dark pants, burnt bread served way to late, water from Wales (we don't have water in the US) and a 4% surcharge on a huge bill to pay for health insurance for the employees and you have a mix for a perfect evening.\n\nI enjoyed a wonderful and inspiring evening with a friend - despite.... thanx for buying dinner....", "author": "Flo B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-07", "description": "I visited Michael Mina for the first time for the Christmas Eve \"Feast of Seven Fishes\" tasting menu. Tab was $125 for the seven savory courses plus a dessert course, and another $75 for the wine pairings.\n\nService was excellent. Nearly flawless in fact. There were a couple very minor hiccups that I would completely ignore at lesser restaurants but the bar gets set higher at a restaurant like this one.\n\nOne touch that really pleased me was that the waitress brought two books for me to peruse during the time between courses. Recognizing that a solo diner like myself might get fidgety over the course of three hours without a minor distraction was a nice touch.\n\nFood was excellent. A couple of the courses (the oyster course and sea bass course) weren't really my thing. But it wasn't as though something was wrong with them, just not foods I am as fond of. The Florida Stone Crab was amazing. The Salt Cod Fritter was excellent. And the Roasted 1/2 Maine Lobster might be the best lobster I have ever had.\n\nWine pairings were solid. At $75 for what amounts to about 6 glasses of wine, you're not expecting that they pulled the rare vintages out of the cellar. But the sommelier did an excellent choice matching the wines to the courses.\n\nFor a tab of $270 for one, a part of me thinks I might have enjoyed the 3-course meal more (at roughly half the cost). But I view fine dining as being as much about entertainment as the food. And the three hours at Michael Mina was three hours I was completely removed from the rest of the holiday stress. For that, it was easily worth the money.", "author": "TJ P."}

During the entire time we were there (1130-1) today for lunch, the place was probably 80% empty. Why, on why, would you not let us reserve a more convenient time?\n\nIn any case, the oysters were my favorite part of the meal. Fresh, raw and delicious. The beef strip loin was, for some reason, a very dense and hard cut of meat, which I didnt expect in a loin. The sauce complimented the beef, but the lack of tenderness made the meat hard to enjoy. The grilled tomatoes that accompanied the loin was excellent. \n\nThe chocolate delice was... unique. As a simple description, it was a two light brownies and a devil's food cake, which was filled with caramel. the dehydrated moose was nothing exciting to the palette, but the raspberry crisps on the side was yummy. \n\nAll in all, the service was ok (nothing wrong with it, just not has personable as most fantastic restaurants are), food was ok, and if it werent for the great company during the meal, I dont think I would have enjoyed it quite as much.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place for business lunch-ins/drinks in the financial district.", "author": "Chieko H."}

Here is what we had.\n\nAmuse Bouche- Love these!  They served a potato soup with grilled cheese.  There are no words.\n\nTuna Tartare- This has been a staple for the past 21  years and we know why.  What an interesting take, different than your usual Japanese version.  This had quail egg (my first time ever having that), pine nuts, jicima etc.  Delicious!!!  The tuna was so fresh and spot on.\n\nBeet Salad- Fresh beets served with gorgonzola creme and pistacio butter?  really?  SO good!  Would have been even better with a splash of lime or citrus on top.\n\nBecause I don't eat pork really or shell fish, we had the Cote du Bouf for two.  Again, breathtaking and amazing.  This comes in a beautiful cast iron dutch oven and then taken to carve.  What a presentation.  The meat is totally slow cooked and done in the wood burning oven and you can so taste that.  The brussel sprouts that come with it are probably THE BEST in the entire world.  I have never eaten something that delicious.  The potatos, creamy and light.  \n\nWe didn't have room for dessert but I wish we did.  They finished the meal off with a complimentary lemon dessert.

This was a somewhat subtle dish and I wondered whether pepper or a bit more lemon would have added or subtracted from it.\n\nA main of \"five seas\" presents five different types of fish, each perfectly prepared.  As I like some types of seafood better than others, I liked some of what was on the plate more than the rest.  However, while well done, this dish seemed to be a sampler that showcased the ability of the kitchen to get many different things on one plate at the same time rather than presenting wonderful food with a strong focus.

My waiter was very attentive(but not hovering), and gave me great guidance with the menu. I was very impressed with the ambiance and the service, but those pale in comparison to the food. At first I was nervous because I didnt see fois gras on the menu, but I soon forgot about that as I tasted my selections. The bread they served was similar to the rustic selection at American fish...lightly brushed with olive oil and tasted...completely adictive! It came with ricotta cheese with peppered honey and sea salt(see photo). Next I had the dungeness crab risotto with pomagranit because dungeonous crab is just coming in season. There wasnt much in there but I really didnt notice because the risotto was so good and the pomagranit gave it just the right mystery and balance. My second course was a white truffle pasta with parmasan cream. They shaved the truffle right at the table, and this gave the dish an amazing flavor that has to be tried to be discribed.

For me, personally, this meant winning a bet with a Texas born-and-bred gentleman friend who is a hardcore Rangers fan and getting treated to a truly transcendent meal at Michael Mina last night.\n\nMany of my friends have been to the restaurant's old location (as well as the new one that just opened) and have raved about, amongst other things, their lobster corn dogs, exquisite mixed drinks, chocolate chip cookies, and, especially, the lobster pot pie which was what I ended up ordering as my main course.\n\nI'm certainly glad that I donned my favorite Nanette Lepore dress as it was a fitting ensemble for the elegant yet understated/classic ambience of the restaurant. We started out with an order of the Foie Gras PB&J (which I didn't try because I personally object to the process of how the main ingredient is obtained - but my friend savored it and goaded me for \"missing out\") plus the Tuna Tartare which was so delicious that I was reticent to share any...I know, I can be greedy. :)\n\nNext, the vegetarian in me demanded that we order the Kabocha Squash Souffle and was glad that I didn't ask them to hold the black truffle cream. It ended up complementing the dish perfectly. This is the perfect winter treat.\n\nFinally, I ordered the lobster pot pie. It looked a bit small when it arrived but this is because it is truly a tasty, decadent, and filling meal. I'm a fan of Fat Angel's Chicken Pot Pie but nothing could prepare me for how exquisite, rich, and flavorful this dish was as the law of diminishing returns did not apply to each subsequent bite I put in my mouth.\n\nNeedless to say, I was a bit too satisfied to leave room for dessert but again, I must say that I'm thrilled I took a gamble (even though the Giants losing would've meant a trip to Gary Danko on my dime).

Fresh oysters, shabu shabu, butter poached lobster and so much more, all amazingly done in fresh and vibrant flavors.  As if the food were not enough reason to go, try adding excellent service by attentive and knowledgeable staff and beautiful, if not a bit boisterous, setting and you have a triple threat.  I was there with a group of 8 and the service and attention we received was spot on.  It is so refreshing to have wait staff work for their gratuity even though it is automatic on groups larger than 6!  The next time you want to have a big gathering with a bunch of your foodie freinds, or simply an intimate dinner with that special someone, it would recommend Michael Mina.

We also did get a great table by the window, so we were a little seperated. \n\nThe food was, as usual, fabulous. We started with a little amuse bouche -asparagus soup with a mini grilled cheese. Even the bread, which was perfectly toasted and came with a honey butter, felt like it was a course itself. We HAD to have the tartar.

I loved his witty take on American classics, and would swoon over his seafood creations. \n\nThe restaurant recently reopened in the former Aqua location (where Mina used to be a chef before parting ways with its owner many years ago), so I was looking forward to being wowed again. The menu is now more Japanese influenced than New American and no longer includes Mina's creative \"trio\" dishes...and regrettably, I must say I'm not impressed. While the food is good, there's nothing that sets it apart. It feels like Michael Mina is trying to imitate a Japanese fusion restaurant, instead of making it his own. \n\nProscuitto Grilled Cheese Sandwich & Parsnip Soup - a refined take on the grilled cheese. Reminded me of those cute crustless sandwiches that accompany afternoon tea, only more savory and tasty.\n\nUni Flan with Hamachi Collar - my eyes always light up when I see the word uni (sea urchin) on any menu item. Unfortunately, I couldn't really taste the uni in this dish. But I did savor the salty and rich hamachi (yellowtail fish) collar balanced with bright notes of meyer lemon and delicate shimeji mushrooms. \n\nSeared Scallops & Pork Belly in Curry Sauce - the scallops were super buttery and perfectly melded with the creamy curry sauce. The flavor of the pork belly reminded me of the Chinese bbq style of \"char siu\", but it was dry and misplaced in this dish. \n\nDuo of Crispy Fish on Thai Lobster Sauce - the red snapper was surprisingly fishy and needed some lemon to cut the strong flavor. On the other hand, the fried cod was excellent - crispy on the outside, warm and meaty in the inside...and nicely complemented by the rich lobster sauce. The pea shoot and coconut salad was an interesting addition. \n\nPrather Ranch Lamb & Orecchiete - a relatively light pasta dish topped with ricotta and slices of lamb shank and tongue (I'm not a big fan of eating tongue, so glad the slices were razor thin). I enjoyed the thickness and home-made texture of the oriecchiete (ear-shaped pasta).\n\nBeef Filet & Short Rib - the filet was beautifully executed...velvety tenderness with a light sear on the outside. One of the best filets I've had in a while. To my surprise, the short rib was the exact opposite...tough and gummy. I only took one bite and went back to the filet. The Spanish wine paired with this dish was excellent...will have to buy a few bottles (2008 Bodegas El Nido \"Clio\"). \n\nCandied Apple - a delicious deconstructed candied apple with frozen Greek yogurt and mulled cider foam. \n\nPassionfruit & Grapefruit Panna Cotta - tart and creamy panna cotta served with a crunchy chicharr\u00f3n. \n\nJasmine & Brown Sugar Wafers and Chocolate & Honey Lozenges - I didn't care for the lozenges, but the wafers were my favorite of all the desserts. The wafers were delicate and crispy, while the jasmine added a unique element to the sweetness. \n \n**For photos of each course, visit my blog listed under my profile.

As we walked in, we were amazed by the setting of this place. Very beautiful. The service was great. Everyone was so professional and polite. Our server had great knowledge about the food and the wine that they served. I tried their On a whim cocktail where you basically tell them what you like and the bartender cooks up something for you! The result was the most creative cocktail I have ever tried! We tried the Ahi Tuna Tartare, and the short rib tortellini.  Both great choices. For our main dish, we chose their black cod and the duck breast that the server suggested. The cod was amazing and full of flavor but the duck breast was a bit gamy -- not my favorite. The weakest part of the meal was the dessert. We tried two of their desserts, but they were so tasteless. I'm not a big fan of the whole gastromolecular movement and that's why I was very disappointed with the dessert.

I have been to a couple dozen M Star restaurants around the world and I have had a good experience in all of them, so maybe I held this place to a standard that was too high. \nBoth my husband and I ordered the tasting menu at $170 each. He ordered the wine pairing with his for an extra $100. He was served champagne that was flat. When he pointed this out to the sommelier, he was told no it wasn't because the sommelier had corked to for storage himself.  What kind of an answer is that?  The champagne was still flat. To his credit, he did remove the glass (probably tasted it and saw that it really was flat), and opened a new bottle which was fine. \nThe wine pairing was very eclectic. Some horrible wines from Spain and New York, and a great one from Chile. The champagne was nice, once it was fresh. \nIt was 11 courses, the vast majority seafood or fish. I generally prefer seafood and fish, but I was underwhelmed with these dishes. The abalone and octopus were very tough and rubbery. I know they usually are, but I have tasted them various times at other M Star restaurants and they are no longer so tough.\nThe fois  gras was the worse I have ever had.   It was way too rich and came with a brioche soaked and fried in butter that was inedible. To the credit of the restaurant, they did take back the dish after seeing we did not eat it without our requesting them to do so.

The waitress brought it out to show us the meat before it was sliced and it smelled amazing. They brought it out and as I mentioned above the portion was huge! It came with roasted brussel sprouts that were excellent and a whipped potato and parsnip that we didn't touch because we wanted to save room for dessert. \n\nThe beef was fantastic, medium rate, seasoned to perfection but we had a lot to take home and eat over the weekend.\n\nWe ordered the tasting desserts and I think again, it's a buit too much after a big dinner.

My group and I opted for the $160/person Kitto (sp?, maybe Kito) 9-course tasting menu.  Each individual within each couple is supposed to get one of two options per course.  Well, they kept screwing up the orders.  For the first course, they brought three of the same course and one different one.  I asked them what the deal was, and the server responded that it was supposed to work like this - that one person gets something different from the other three for each course.  I then asked the original server, and he confirmed that that was not correct; however, they did not remedy the problem and just let us eat our courses the way they were set down.  For the second course, they mixed up the order again.  We thought, \"Oh boy, this going to be a long night.\"  Indeed!  It took 40 minutes, yes 40 MINUTES, before each of the first three courses.  Yes, that's almost 2 hrs to get 3 tiny courses that are 1-3 bites of food.  We complained about the timing, then they picked up the pace a little.  Regardless, it took almost 4 hours to eat the entire meal, and the latter courses were plopped down on the table with no explanation and none of the usual pomp and circumstance.  To top it all off, the courses were not that good.  The kobe beef was gristle-y, not marbled, the squab tasted iron-y like blood, and to be quite honest with you, the food was just not that memorable.  And get this!  Are you listening?  I GOT FOOD POISONING!!!  That's right, about 1:30am I woke up with the famed Michael Mina meal doing flips in my stomach, and I spent the next 12 hours puking my guts out.  Every heave I thought, \"Damn, there goes $20 and 40 minutes!\"\n\nFor $160/person you have to get every detail right.  It doesn't matter if you're busy.  It doesn't matter if the chef is hung over.  It just doesn't matter.  Our table, with tip, paid almost $1000 (4 adults and a child).  The bad food, bad service, and ultimate sickness are unconscionable given the cost.  I have had a couple amazing meals at Michael Mina before, but this one has turned me against the restaurant forever...I will never go back.", "author": "Bertrand V."}

Where it falls short of a 5 stars rating, the space is very loud and the distance between tables are too close - not an intimate dining experience I was hoping for say ala Gary Danko or La Folie or even the old Aqua. \n\nGiven this restaurant is still in it's infancy stage at the new Financial District location (5 weeks new), the chef himself is at the helm of the kitchen which explains the impeccable food.  I'm blown away by the labor intensiveness and creativity of some of the dishes.  \n\nLOVED!\n\nH'orderves Sampler:  Beef tartar on potato pancake, salmon on blini with caviar, foie gras mousse with huckleberry sauce and CLT (crab lettus and tomato wrap).\n\nPork belley and Geoduck Salad:  I applaud this dish for the creative combination of unexpected ingredients that somehow mixed together to perfection.\n\n5 fish, 5 ways:  This is an example of labor intensiveness.  Each piece of fish is individually prepared in a different style with separate complementary sides.  I loved four of the five fish, but did not care for the tuna cheeks, too fishy for my taste.\n\nDessert Tasting:  A perfect way to end the meal and another example of labor intensiveness.  5 small bites of delicate and very different desserts to further tease your taste buds as you reflect on the great meal.  \n\nHONORABLE MENTION:\n\nChicken:  Who orders chicken at this restaurant?!  We did, and it was so creative and delicious.  The Foie Gras rice and the optional white truffle add on sold it for us.  The chicken is prepared sous-vide which created an unexpected texture to the chicken and retained all the moisture.\n\nFoie Gras Appetizer:  Can't really go wrong with this dish, the standout is the Foie Gras mousse.\n\nThe amuse bouche and the bread with ricotta and honey, also exceptionally good.\n\nOverall, this is the best and most creative meal I've had in San Francisco.  Of course, with this level of food and service, the price is high but very well worth it.", "author": "Rosalyn C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-06-11", "description": "We were in SF for the weekend and decided to have an upscale dinner Saturday night. The reviews here for Michael Mina sounded good and they had a reservation available that worked with our schedule. Note: some terrible reviews have been posted since we went. We probably wouldn't have gone if we'd seen how bad they seem to be doing lately.\n\nWe were impressed when we first arrived at the restaurant. The host was very warm and friendly, despite the fact that we were in jeans and not fancified. We purposely arrived early for our reservation so we would have time for a drink at the bar and to talk about the menu with the bartender. We always like to ask the bartenders what's good because they tend to give you a more honest answer than servers. I asked the bartender to recommend a glass of red and told him what I liked and didn't. He brought me a perfect selection. My boyfriend also had one of their specialty cocktails. The waiter recommended the tuna tartare, halibut, squid ink pasta, and the steak from the tasting menu. He said that we could order a la carte from the tasting menu so I had my heart set on the steak as they don't have a steak on the regular menu. They do have a steak for two on the regular menu but we like to order different entrees so we can taste multiple menu items. So far I was very happy.\n\nBefore we were done with our drinks, our table was ready and we were seated. This is where the experience went from great to get me out of here. Our waiter was basically a caricature of a snooty upscale restaurant waiter. He looked at us like we didn't belong, didn't listen to us or care what we wanted, and seemed like he was bothered by us even being there. The table next to us had a great waiter. I had waiter envy.\n\nWe ordered oysters, the tuna tartare, and the squid ink pasta. The oysters were good but you can get the same ones for much cheaper just about anywhere. The tuna tartare was prepared at the table with a quail egg, garlic, etc. It was pretty much exactly what you can get anywhere that serves that dish. Heck I can make it at home. The squid ink pasta was good but salty. It didn't have a lot of flavor so it's not something I would order again, but the novelty was nice.\n\nWhen we ordered entrees, I ordered the steak and was rudely told that I couldn't order from the tasting menu. I said that the bartender said I could and the waiter informed me that usually you can but the kitchen was backed up so they weren't letting anyone order from it a la carte. That steak was really the only thing on the menu that looked good to me so I was very disappointed. I hoped that he would come back and tell me he got the okay for me to have it. No luck. So, I had halibut and my boyfriend had the lamb.\n\nThe halibut dish lacked flavor. It needed the salt they used on the pasta appetizer. There was a green sauce on the plate that had no flavor at all. The crayfish were an odd pairing with no flavor and the fish pieces were topped with little bread triangles that brought nothing to the dish.\n\nThe lamb dish was good though it was paired with a very soggy moussaka.\n\nWhen I ordered the halibut, I also asked for the waiter to bring me whatever white he recommended with the fish, as long as it didn't have a lot of oak flavor. I asked twice. I never got my wine. Half way through my entree, some other guy came over and asked if I needed another glass of wine. I said that I had asked for our waiter to bring me a glass of white to pair with the halibut. The waiter came back over and I went through my request a 4th time. Finally I got a glass of good white...with huge chunks of cork floating in it.\n\nI was planning on having dessert but by the time we got our entrees, we were just annoyed with the entire process and wanted to leave. Our waiter had apparently gone home for the night because the good waiter from the table next to us came by to see if we wanted anything else. I showed him the chunks of cork in my glass of wine and told him we were ready for the check.\n\nWhen he brought the check back, he said he had removed the glass of wine which I was very grateful for. I bet he would have gotten me a steak. When I looked at the bill, all of our drinks were removed (2 cocktails, 2 glasses of wine) which was probably a mistake but I took it as an apology for the overall poor experience. The bill (without the drinks) came to ~$200 for 3 appetizers and 2 entrees. \n\nThe only reason they are getting a 2nd star is because the bus boys, bartenders, and host were great.\n\nWe won't go back to Michael Mina and probably won't visit his other restaurants after this experience. I can deal with bitchy waiters if the food is amazing. I've had better food from hole in the wall places off in questionable neighborhoods, reinforcing my desire to support the local guy rather than the \"famous chef\" from now on.", "author": "Pamela L."}

It's $20 and the portion isn't large but it's worth the splurge. Trust me on that. This place is pricey no doubt. A glass of wine will cost you $15 on the low end.

We actually ordered a 2nd Ahi dish for both of  us-4 total along with Manhattans and a bottle of Faella Pinot Noir. We weren't done though. My wife was craving a steak and they have a prime rib eye on the bar menu for sharing. I think it was $65 and the portion wasn't huge. The meat was so flavorful and tender.

I loved it at the former MM and I loved it even more last night! Soo good! My girlfriend loved hers too. I can't even remember what the guys ate but they too enjoyed theirs. \n\nThe \"flight\" of mini desserts is a bit contrived, I mean they were good but can't I just pick one and get a portion big enough to bond with, the whole \"taste\" thing just doesn't do it for me. My husband also missed the root beer floats that he had at the old MM -- maybe they'll bring them back, or maybe they are still at the St. Francis, we may have to check out Bourbon Steak. \n\nAnyway, lovely night out, I liked the congenial host guy who wandered around, we had a 7.45 booking and they didn't seem to mind us lingering (we were not the last to leave but things had thinned out -- I did notice that they cut off our water after the bill came -- incidentally the tap water is served in nice clear glass bottles, I am going to try that at home, like the clean minimalist look) \n\nAs for decor, it's not Aqua and I guess I have to get over that, I did like the slip covered chairs and two of the three huge mirrors that are tilted in the main dining area -- the one that faces the street and reflects all the cars doesn't seem well placed, it certainly doesn't help with the intimacy factor. The place is loud and the tables are pretty close, we were seated in a somewhat less than prime spot in the back but we were fine with it because it was even noisier toward the front (we're talking four bells noisy -- yikes!)

We were seated promptly and waiting at our table was a hand written card from the general manager wishing me a happy birthday and thanking me for selecting their restaurant to spend it at.  Our waitress, Tai, was easily the best waitress ever.  I asked her to do my drink ordering for me so that way I try something new each time and she brought me a great drink every time.  My favorite was a combination of pear, and apples, and thyme.\n\nPre-appetizers: Mini grilled cheese sandwiches with little cups of soup.  My wift had butternut squash and mine was porcini mushrooms.  Best mushroom soup ever.  I would have been happy with a full sized portion for dinner.  Their bread with the honey ricotta mixture was incredible.  Ordered a second helping of that.\n\nAppetizers: Wife ordered the dunguneous crab with lardo (I don't eat animals with feelings), and I had the seared hamachi.  She loved hers.  Mine was good, but I'm used to having sushi but no complaints.\n\nEntrees: Wife had the 5 seas which is 5 different fish prepared in 5 different ways.  I had the lobster pot pie.  Both were incredible and the presentation was great.  The seafood for both our dishes were cooked superbly.  I haven't had lobster that tender in...ever?\n\nDessert: So I made a comment to our waitress about how excited I was to see the dessert menu earlier in the evening.  A manager comes out to wish me a happy birthday and says 'I understand that you were a little excited about dessert so I've taken it out of your hands and it's on me tonight'.  I'm thinking, wow, that's nice.  He pours me a really nice glass of dessert wine and brings out an olive oil and chocolate ganache cake with ice cream.  The cake was super moist and really good.  So I'm happy and satisfied right?  Apparently not.  They brought out 7 more courses of dessert ranging from a tarts to jasmine creme filled sugar wafers to a deconstructed smores.  And coffee?  Your own little french press with steamed milk so it doesn't bring the temperature down.\n\nAt the end of the night the general manager comes over and wishes me a happy birthday as well.

The inspiration behind the Green Apple 'Pop' was a McDonald's apple pie. It was the best dessert I have ever consumed. So light, flavorful and bold. The apple sorbet (kind of) tasted just like a green apple and had the consistency of an otter pop (remember those?! lol!) and the pink apples, graham cracker and brown sugar nuggets, and dollop of yogurt they paired with it was just amazing.

Overall we had a great experience at the restaurant.  The bar was a bit loud so you could not always hear each other and the staff but it was not too much of a nuisance.  We had their 9 course tasting menu which is really 18 different dishes.  Each course they serve two different things and you can share with your dining companion.  So you get to taste 18 different items. The sourdough bread came to the table toasted, brushed with olive oil, and served with a honey, black pepper, and mascarpone spread. It was one of my favorite items.  My favorites were the Maine diver scallop, Liberty Farms duck breast and the Black Angus Prime rib-eye.  Overall a really good dinner.  The pacing was good, the staff was attentive and the food was worth the high price of a tasting menu.  Definitely will try it again.", "author": "Karen C."}

Other than that, when I think of Michael Mina, I think of a food theme that gets serve three ways, so it keeps the palette interesting. \n  \nLocated in the luxirious Westin St. Francis hotel in Union Square San Francisco, this restaurant is easy to miss if you don't walk into the hotel or know it whereabout. Upon entering, business men and women in business wear as well as some people like me, who get off work and put on a dress and go; nevertheless, the atmosphere was very dim and elegant. The service was superb! They made sure my water cup and wine glass is filled at all time. They explained every dishes that we ordered. Fabulous!\n \nMichael Mina offers Prix Fix menu as well as tasting menu. I ordered from the 3 course prix fix with my choice of whatever starter, entree and dessert I want. And of course, my friend and I made sure we ordered different things so we got more to try. \n\nI really like the beef tartare start. The amount of beef they serve was enough for it to be an entree by itself. I highly recommend the lobster potpie as an entree. It's $35 extra but the taste as well as a \"disasembly show\" from the waiter is totally worth it. For dessert, Oh My Gosh...everything! I didn't even have room left for dessert even though they're good. \n\nThe large amount of food you get, the good quality of food you get and the nice service you get from Michael Mina made the dinner very worth it.", "author": "Mandy C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-05-01", "description": "For those of you who want the quick and dirty: Michael Mina is a restaurant with wonderful ambiance, terrific service and average food. My two biggest complaints were that 1) all of the dishes were temperature-wise lukewarm and 2) the plating was amateurish. Plating is important.   \n\nMM is simple and elegant and classy. Huge mirrors make the space look larger than it is and low, warm lights gave the restaurant a nice feel even in the early evening at around 7:15. \n\nThe next experience was getting to our table. The floor is very crowded. I don't know if that was done to give diners a sense of camaraderie but we had to squeeze between chairs to get to our window table. Throughout the night, I kept waiting for waiters and patrons to knock over wine bottles and glasses. \n\nI had called ahead to let the staff know that it was the Husband's birthday and there was a handwritten note from the GM thanking us for choosing to spend the evening with MM. Both the person who seated us and the waiter knew my name and wished the Husband a happy birthday. The beginning of fabulous service.\n\nDRINKS:\nJapanese Punch (sake, Yuzu and Asian pear): light, pear-y, pretty sweet\n\nThe Sting (one of their bartenders' concoctions - they're having Nolet's\nGin contest right now): like a white Gummi Bear but not disgustingly so\n\nGin Rummy (another of the Nolet's Gin contestants): like strawberry lemonade, sweeter than to my liking\n\n*A testament to the great service: the Husband accidentally knocked over his first Sting. Our waiter, Daniel L., came over and began to clean the mess. He asked if the Husband wanted another one and the Husband said no (he had almost finished the first). A few seconds later, Daniel L. said, \"If I may, sir...I was going to buy your first drink anyway because of the wait. Please let me get you another drink.\" He said it in such a way that made us feel completely comfortable and we appreciated the gesture. \n\nAMUSE BOUCHE:\nGrilled cheese with cauliflower soup. Tasty. \n\nBREAD:\nTexas toast with honey/ricotta/sea salt spread. Toast was really buttery. Spread was almost pure honey. Pretty good.\n\nSTARTERS:\nPork belly and geoduck (pronounced gooey-duck) salad: The pork belly was ok. I've certainly had better. The geoduck (which is a type of saltwater clam) was interesting. I didn't like it raw and it had no flavor fried. Overall, a mediocre dish, particularly because the pork belly was lukewarm. \n\nNantucket Scallops: This was done three ways. Pan-seared was the best, followed by the citrus marinade and then the tempura one. This plate was the most visually disappointing. The scallops were all tiny and different sizes and were dropped on top of the different sauces. It looked like this \\ / \\ / \\ / \\ / where the scallops were at all of the points. Plating aside, this dish was also lukewarm which was off putting.\n\nENTREES:\n5 Seas: Five different fish prepared five different ways. I don't remember all of the different types of fish but there was a cod and a mackerel. This was a decent dish and really the only one that had any excuse for being lukewarm. The cod was the best - it simply melted in your mouth - and the mackerel, while smelling awfully fishy as mackerel will, was pretty good.\n\nMaine Lobster Pot Pie: At MP, this dish was $75. I don't believe I've had an entree that expensive before but it's a signature MM dish. Like many of the dishes, this one is partially plated in front of you. The lobster pieces were gigantic! This dish was the most reminiscent of a Gary Danko dish. It was rich, flavorful and filling. But it was also lukewarm. \n\nDESSERT:\nThe Husband didn't want any dessert but they did bring out a birthday surprise. A light, fluffy cake with vanilla bean ice cream and chocolate shavings with a single candle. And a complimentary dessert of vanilla bean ice cream, a pineapple chunk that had something done to it and a cake-y sort of thing at the bottom. The dessert might have been the best part of the meal. \n\nADVICE ON DRESS:\nThere's a big range here. I like to dress nicely to go to nice restaurants but there were folks around my admittedly young age dressed in business casual clothing. I say if you're going to spend the money you're going to spend at MM, dress the part.\n\nTo sum up, MM is really a-ok. The three stars makes it seem worse than it is. I think I left MM with mixed feelings. The service was so incredible (more casually friendly than GD but absolutely professional) and the food was so incredibly average given that everything was lukewarm.  \n\nI'm also not sure how I feel about certain dishes being prepared at the table. It felt a little weird, especially given how short MM is on real estate. I'd certainly like to go back to try other dishes that looked good \nbut I don't think I can rave about the food.\n\nP.S.

There were six small bites, so plan accordingly.\n\nTasting of provincial shellfish bouillabaisse broth, uni toast ($18) was a fun and beautiful dish full of several types of clams including razor clams, mussels, but no fish. It was served with a tomato base broth that was poured tableside. Some of the razor clams were not fully cleaned, resulting in some sand action. The uni toast was excellent with two large mounds of delectable and tangy seafood.\n\nDungeness crab pasta pyramids, artichoke, sylvetta, Meyer lemon ($24) featured a great many ravioli-wonton like pieces of goodness filled with some of the first crab of the season. A pretty filling dish with lots of quantity.\n\nfoie gras pineapple buckwheat cr\u00eape, allspice dram, macadamia nut ($28) is for fellow foie gras aficionados! This sounds funky with its cr\u00eape, but it proved to be far more mainstream. You get both a seared and the terrine version with some variety that takes top-notch foie and melds it with more exotic items.\n\n\"Five seas\" Tasting of Japanese fish, bamboo Rice, Ginger vinaigrette ($42) was a beautiful dish with a variety of fish and shellfish including braised tuna cheek, Hokkaido scallop, braised tuna cheek, miso-glazed cod, and even a wood ear mushroom. Extraordinarily expensive but a balance of freshness and starch.\n\nBrandt Farms beef ribeye porcini butter poached, palms fondant ($46) is for the meat lovers in the audience. Top-quality meat, cooked perfectly, with a nice crispy crust and elegant potatoes topped with a fava bean pendant.\n\nPrather ranch farms lamb chops and osso bucco, pomegranate-lamb jus ($39) had a single beautiful lamb chop that still possessed a little gaminess, but tasted perfect. The was not much bone marrow in the accompanying bone and the quantities provided are on the low side. This was one of the weakest dishes of the evening.\n\nBraised pork short rib, mission figs, Anson Mills polenta, Hock jus ($32) was an excellent dish with tender pork that fell off the bone bathed in the meaty sauce. The dish included a couple fried balls full of meat and some excellent polenta.\n\nDessert tasting ($15 per person) included six different items! Many were chocolate oriented, so make sure you save room for this fun and decadent dessert.\nCandied apple, mulled cider, and frozen yogurt was a sweet mixture with some neutral foam on top.\nLozenge with milk chocolate, and honey were crispy candies with delicate chocolate layers.\nOrange crisps with white chocolate, and orange glass were pieces of crispy and chocolatey candy housed in the wood box.\n\nWafers with Jasmine, and brown sugar were delicate thin wafers wrapped around soft sweet filling.\n\nBrownie with dark chocolate, and bourbon had several different elements including a hard candy full of bourbon.\nBriquette with coffee, cardamom and a marshmallow center was soft and a nice blend of different flavors.\nChicharrones with passion fruit, and Meyer lemon was a pretty good size dish full of this crunchy dessert, but flavor was lacking.\n\nOK: (if you like this dish)\nNone\n\nPans: (We would not reorder these dishes)\nNone\n\nService - One expects top-notch service at a venue like this and they delivered just that. A knowledgeable and accommodating waiter and very good service.\n\nValue - Prices are in-line with top-notch caliber destination restaurants for special occasions.\n\nAlternatives - Nearby restaurants include excellent Italian restaurant Perbacco and sister restaurant Barbacco. One Market and Boulevard are not far away.\n\nVerdict - How is Michael Mina 2.0? He is back and better than ever. The cuisine is inventive while-being accessible to the mainstream. We were surprised by the excellent food and top-notch service.\n\nHow does Michael Mina compare to top San Francisco restaurants like Gary Danko? This restaurant definitely belongs in the same league again. If you are on a budget, come to Michael Mina for the much lower cost lunch menu. They have a $39 tasting menu at lunch that should fit the bill.", "author": "Ellen H."}

Eating at Michael Mina will definitely leave your wallet with some hurting, especially if you order the lobster pot pie, but your tummy will be very happy!

I don't think I've had lobster cooked so perfectly before, and the servers bring you the pot pie shell separate from the broth, which they pour into the pot pie bowl once they've cracked the shell, all done tableside. The broth/filling was rich and delicious tasting, and had that fresh seafood aroma. We also ordered a steak dish which was good, but not as memorable as the lobster. The service here was impeccable, and the atmosphere was lively, but still sophisticated.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-12", "description": "I took my boyfriend here for his birthday a couple weeks ago.\n\nThe interior of Michael Mina contained high ceilings, large mirrors, and a suit-and-tie crowd.  What could have been a stuffy atmosphere was offset by personable staff and noise from an open kitchen.  While waiting for our menus, I read Yelp reviews of the place.  One reviewer disliked the slightly noisy ambiance and compared it (unfairly, in my opinion) to that of a cafeteria.  My boyfriend and I, on the other hand, thought that it provided conversational privacy and saved the place from an uncomfortable degree of formality.\n\nWe spent the next two hours enjoying great food and even better table service.  The Asian fusion menu, described by the restaurant website as having \"Japanese ingredients and French influence,\" featured some unique combinations such as shabu-shabu with foie gras and seared hamachi with sake gelee.  Every item on the menu (especially the meat-heavy appetizers) sounded delicious, which made it hard for us to decide on our meal, and the service, from beginning to end, was impeccable.  Everyone, from our server down to the busboys, was prompt, friendly without being assuming, and made us feel welcome.\n\nWe rejected an appealing five-course tasting menu, which included hamachi, sea bass, pasta, steak, and dessert, for the a la carte selection and ordered the Nantucket Bay Scallops and the Australian Wagyu Shabu Shabu for appetizers.  The scallops came prepared in three ways, as advertised: fried, pan-seared, and raw.  My favorite, the pan-seared scallops, were paired with slivers of grapefruit and pickle.  For the shabu-shabu, we were given bok choy, radishes, sausage, and wagyu to cook in a lemony dashi broth.  After we consumed the meat and salad, our waiter served the broth to us in bowls.\n\nNext, the boyfriend and I shared the Black Truffle Trofie (trofie is a pasta shaped like a tiny, loose corkscrew), a small, mildly-flavored dish that turned out to be our least favorite because there was nothing memorable or especially good about it.  In the same way, I was slightly disappointed by my entree.  I'm a steak person by default, but I also know that an exceptional braised pork is superior to most steaks, so I took a chance with the Braised Kurobuta Pork.  The sauce was decent but the meat was fattier and less tender than expected, and the sides were well-prepared but forgettable.  For his entree, the boyfriend ordered the \"Five Seas,\" a sample of five types of fish cooked five different ways, which turned out to be delicious and which I liked much better than my pork.\n\nNext came the six-course dessert, which consisted of fiore di sicilia-flavored macaroons that tasted like Fruity Pebbles, white chocolate and grapefruit crisps, jasmine and brown sugar wafers, toasted marshmallows, coffee cake, and chocolate and honey lozenges.  I was too full at this point to eat all of it, but I loved the brown sugar wafers, which were very light and filled with a subtle, jasmine cream.\n\nThroughout our meal, we munched on butter-toasted sourdough bread served with pots of mascarpone topped with a thick layer of honey.  We also sipped on the signature sake cocktails, which tasted innocuous but turned out to be relatively alcoholic.", "author": "Niya Y."}

The restaurant's sommelier came to our table to greet us since he lived in Miami as well.  We decided to just order starters since they all sounded very yummy.  Our night started with a compliment from the chef: a tea cup size amuse bouche of squash soup with a bit size of a grilled cheese sandwich.  Delicious!  Every sip was insane!  Next we had their incredible sourdough bread which was grilled on both sides on a skillet with butter to a golden crisp.  On the side, there was a small cup with a spread of ricotta cheese topped with honey and rock salt.  Wow!  What a powerful combination of deliciousness!  Our next course was potato gnocchi aside lardo dungeness crab with a crab vinaigrette.  I can't explain the flavors in my mouth.  To die for!  Next, we had duck confit wrapped in a crepe with foie gras, pineapple, and a cream with orange marmalade and macadamia nuts.  Can I say that it was like a party in my mouth??  OMG!  Up next was roasted quail encrusted with pistachio nuts, taziki yogurt, and a mix of cucumber and fruits.  Once all combined, it had a perfect balance.  By this time, I was extremely full.  We had one more course coming out: a cook on your own wagyu beef, foie gras, and veggies plate.  They gave us broth set over a fire to use for our plate.  I only had two pieces of wagyu beef since I couldn't eat anymore, so I didn't really get to enjoy it.  My husband loved it though.  No room for dessert, but we plan to go back just for dessert!  I'm sure it's great.\nService was impeccable!  It must have been 50 degrees outside.  We needed a taxi back to the hotel since I couldn't walk up those hills with my heels and I had no coat with me.

The recommend everyone gets the chefs tasting menu together or not at all.  Glad our server mentioned this as the tasting menu had five courses (3 fish, One white meat, One red meat) and then two sweets at the end.  If my husband would have gotten a normal entree he would have been waiting for me to finish as they bring each dish out separately and explain what it is, etc.... \n\nI am for sure not a \"foody\" who frequents these types of places often or really ever. My husband and I went for our 1st year anniversary dinner. Prices are CRAZY expensive to me for an average gal but everyone else there seemed to look like they could afford it or were used to spending that kind of cash on a meal. \n\nAverage age of the crowd there was 40/50's. Not to stay all age groups weren't represented.\n\nThe service was tip top. They all knew their stuff. \n\nMy only complaint (besides price but we were well informed when we decided to make the reservation so I am not taking it against them) is the women's bathroom was so dim there is no way you could see if you had food in your teeth or fix your make-up or anything like that. Really silly thing to complain about I know.", "author": "Jenny D."}

Granted, if you want to eat here, you need to have a lot of mula.  Very expensive.  Yet it was great. I ordered the duck breast which was out of this world.  Before that, they give us a complementary corn soup (based off of corn bread) and a miniature grilled cheese.  Then they have us bread with a special honey butter.  Once again, amazing.  My group also ordered the lamb and salmon which were also spectacular.  My drink, a ginger non alcoholic cocktail, was also good, yet very sour.  The desert was also great, which first was like a cantaloupe gelato.  Very tasty and rich in flavor.  The coffee was also great as it was a premium brand that was roasted in California.  And then just as you are paying and you think the experience is over, they give you this miniature s'more with smoked marshmallows.  Fantastic!  All together fantastic, from the service to the food to them calling a cab for you.  And the best part, my waitress always had a smile and was very pleasant.

The excitement could hardly be contained...we got there and it was all fancy schmancy and the the ambiance was cool, but not snotty/stuffy or anything.  We went on that infamously silly holiday of Valentine's Day and got their tasting menu, which consisted of:\n\nCourse 1: Oysters and Caviar island creek and california select, fennel\nCourse 2:  Degustation of Tuna asian condiments\nCourse 3:  Hudson Valley Foie Gras Terrine rhubarb, sicilian pistachios\nCourse 4:  Spice-Lacquered Liberty Duck Breast orange blossom consomm\u00e9, semolina gnocchi\nCourse 5:  Brandt Farms Beef Filet & Shortrib Beets and horseradish\nCourse 6:  Venezuelan Chocolate Delice violet scented devil's food cake, hibiscus\n\nMy favorite courses were 4 and 5.  The meats were so tender and flavorful.  The duck especially, it was not greasy or fatty, just succulent and tasty...I remember thinking 'man I wish I had more duck.'  The beff was so amazingly tender that it melt in your mouth.  I don't know if these dishes are on their regular menu, but if they are I would definitely order them again.  Besides those two courses the rest of the menu was just 'ehh.'  I don't know if it was because of Valentine's Day or if it was that we had a 9:45pm seating.  Overall we thought the food was just OK, and felt a little rushed to get through the courses.  I think we finished our meal in about an hour.\n\nWe would give Michael Mina another try, maybe we were there on an off night due to the pressures of feeding so many loves on VDay.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-20", "description": "This place has some awesome food. The cooking is flawless and everything is presented and served well. The service is perfect; you never think about asking for something and then having to wonder how long it will take before your server will be able to take your request; they are always ready to get you whatever you need without being imposing. I always had a fresh drink in my hand whenever I wanted one.\n\nI didn't give this restaurant the fifth star because it has quite a few items that are more interesting than they are tasty. Thankfully, those shortcomings were confined to the appetizers, as every entree was delicious. There was a salad that had squid ink in it, and it was alright. The \"crab cake\" was not fried or even seared and it was served on top of a cucumber and sounded like it would be good, but was actually quite bland. There was also a maraschino cherry stuffed with foie gras, which was so-so. The ahi tuna tartare had cilantro, lime, ancho chile powder, toasted pine nuts and sesame oil and it was very tasty. They served it with some sliced bread, which was alright, but doesn't compare to the gyoza chips that they serve with the ahi tartare (which also has avocado; fucking smart) from Ozumo. The sesame oil was a bit too overpowering, as well. So if you were to take the toasted pine nuts, ancho chile powder, cilantro, lime, add avocado, use a little less sesame oil, and serve with gyoza chips, you would have the ultimate ahi tartare - the best of both worlds. But I digress.\n\nThe beef carpaccio is damn good! It almost tastes like it has Lays potato chips crushed up and mixed into it. Awesome.\n\nMy favorite dish by far was the duck breast. It was seared perfectly on the outside and was a nice, even medium rare on the inside. It was sliced evenly; approximately half a centimeter thick slices. The presentation was elegant, but not overly artsy. It came with a whole seared foie gras, which was the highlight of the evening. I've been going on a foie gras bender since it is about to be banned. Everything on that dish went so well together. \n\nIf the ratings on Yelp were out of 100, I would give Micheal Mina's an A- or plain A (90-95). It doesn't get the A+ because they try to play around with ingredients that don't end up being that great (not bad, just not great), but most of the time, what you get is delicious.", "author": "J R."}

I chose the Fraggle Cup, intrigued by the name, and looking forward to a thick, syrupy winter drink.

Of course, it was mixed perfectly and tasted quite good, but wasn't exactly what I was looking for.  We had the lobster corn dogs, of course, and a hamachi starter.  The hamachi performed perfectly, and I was estatic for the few moments it took to chew it, but sadly it was so itty-bitty I didn't get to savor it long.  \n\nThe new location was big and cavernous, and a bit noisy.

They also brought me a slice of olive oil cake for my birthday, with a silver candle adorning the plate (details, details). \n\nNot only was the food amazing, the service was superb. We were seated right away and a birthday card from the restaurant manage was waiting for me at our table. The supervisor came over frequently (but not TOO frequently) to check on us and give recommendations. He seemed to be genuinely nice, not the pretentious nice that one would expect. \n\nCan't wait for another special occasion to go back...this time around, it might be nice to splurge on the tasting menu, although after only 2 dishes and a shared dessert tasting, I was so full that I had to loosing the belt on my dress!!", "author": "lauren j."}

I had the crab and scallops. \n- For the main course, I went with the turkey which came with 3 family style sides of sweet potatoes, mash potatoes, and stuffing. Both potatoes were good and the turkey was moist (not an easy feat). I also appreciated that they did try to make the meal a \"real thanksgiving\". \n\nCONS:\n- A large fail of the dinner was the stuffing. As the first thing I tried on the main course, it honestly had zero flavor and was completely dry. White I do appreciate the play on family style, traditional Thanksgiving, the stuffing was incredibly disappointing. Honestly, I would not have brought the stuffing served to a family dinner without embarrassment.\n- Another huge misstep were the desserts. I felt this course could have been a fun spin on traditional Thanksgiving items, such as pumpkin pie. Instead, I got a \"walnut financier\" which was really just served as fairly dried out cubes of walnut cake with pears. None of the other two desserts at the table left much to be desired and were very small portions. For the cost, I also felt that a small plate of post dinner cookies/treats with coffee would have been a nice touch, but rather things felt rushed.\n- The space is beautiful, but the service felt overbearing at times. (especially the wine service)\n\nOverall- OK, but taking all aspects into account, will not be back.", "author": "Grace M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-02-03", "description": "The food was delicious and the service was friendly, but there were several things about this place that just didn't do it for me.\n\nI didn't knock off a star for this, but it bothered me that they don't have a normal dessert menu. They have a dessert \"tasting\" menu. You're served about seven bite-sized desserts that are brought out as several courses. And most of them really are bite-sized. One or two were a bit larger.  It sucks if you think some of them sound really good and the others, not so much.\n\nI also didn't knock off a star for this: Their famed pot pie is listed on the menu as MP. The night we went, we were surprised to get our bill and find out it was $75. I know that if you care what the MP is, you shouldn't be at a restaurant like Michael Mina. But it's still kinda shocking when you get the bill and the lobster pot pie ends up being almost twice as much as any of the other entrees on the menu.\n\nNor did I knock off a star for this: Everyone was friendly, but service wasn't as polished as I would have expected at a restaurant of this type. On one occasion, we wanted to ask about a dessert because of a food allergy at our table. It took us a while to flag a waiter down. I guess I'm just spoiled by Gary Danko, where there's usually at least one person constantly scanning the dining room to make sure all of the guests are satisfied. Also, one of our entrees came out a few minutes before the others. Sorry if that makes me sound super snotty, but we're paying $75 for a pot pie, and this isn't Denny's.\n\nI DID knock stars off for this: Three of us shared the tuna tartare appetizer. Our waiter suggested we order a one-and-a-half portion. We politely declined. He still brought out an order-and-a-half, which we appreciated. Until we got the bill and found out he charged us for the extra-half portion we said we didn't want. WTF. (And I know he didn't misunderstand us because when he brought the dish out he said, \"I brought you a one-and-a-half portion anyway.\")\n\nStars were knocked off for this, as well: My cousin didn't finish her pot pie, and had a good third of it left (including a large piece of lobster). The bus boy didn't ask her if she wanted to take it home, and apparently didn't hear her say she wanted a doggy bag, because it was thrown out. While we were eating dessert, my cousin wondered out loud where her leftovers were. I told her that maybe they were keeping it up front for her (as Gary Danko does). Well, that wasn't it, because we were never presented with what was probably $30-worth of leftovers.\n\nI would have said something about the last two things, but the rest of my party was made up of super nice, non-confrontational people and I didn't want to make a scene. I told my sister (who works in the restaurant business at an upscale restaurant in NYC) and she said she would have thrown a fit.  Oh well.\n\nFood would have gotten five stars, but I expected so much more from a restaurant of this caliber.", "author": "D E."}

I followed  the restaurant through changes in chefs, saw it deteriorate, be resuscitated and finally collapse. Since it reopened as the eponymous Michael Minna with a revamped but not dissimilar menu,--carrying over some of the original Aqua dishes-  and an essentially unchanged look, save for rehanging the art on the walls, I've had a couple of mediocre meals there, nothing like in the glory days of Aqua. The same is true for Michael MInna in San Jose where I had a very high priced dose of the mediocre. But I was unprepared  for the meal we were subjected to last night. Everything about it was wrong. out of focus. mismatched and just plain tasted bad . Even on the plate the food looked fatigued, like it had sat too long in the kitchen before being delivered. Every dish was dominated by curious unpleasant flavors. The tuna belly was so fishy it couldn't be saved by the pleasing presentation which included table side grating of fresh wasabi. And bizarrely, I was served a piece of bread with honey butter at the same time I was served the raw fish. The suckling pig was  gelatinous to the point that we couldn't bring ourselves to swallow it. The poached lobster was so tough I literally could not cut through it with my knife! The beef was nicely cooked but its flavors were acrid. Even the small bites of baby lettuce or vegetables that accompanied some of the courses were seasoned in such a way that rendered them offensive. I hate writing a review like this. If a meal is mediocre I just keep my opinion to myself. But this place has turned into a charade. It's just bad theater. And in San Francisco there are many better choices. At this price point and also for a lot less. Even on the same block.", "author": "Adam S."}

To be honest, the service was very slow that night, and our main server was extremely soft-spoken with an odd personality so it made the night a tiny bit awkward. the first amuse bouche was absolutely outstanding. From what I remember, it was a cauliflower soup with a grilled cheese sandwich (herbed bread and cowgirl creamery cheese...delicious). To start, I had the seared scallops with sunchokes, grapes, and tarragon. These scallops were definitely in my top 5 (my #1 being at Redd in Yountville). Then I had the bacon wrapped sturgeon, which was not outstanding, but pretty good. the bacon didn't have that much flavor, which i originally thought would make the dish outstanding (i love sturgeon). I was a little disappointed. The wine menu consisted of many wines that weren't ready to be opened (i know my wines). Many restaurants have newer wines on their menus to charge a lot for bottles that should age more, but most people either don't notice or don't care. Trust me, a wine that is not aged properly definitely does not taste that great. My pinot was not amazing at all and it was expensive.After,  i had the tasting menu of desserts which was amazing. my favorite of the desserts was the pan d'epices cake...so good :).

We had made reservations for 730 pm but had to call and push it back an hour because we were running late. When I called the host was accomodating and had no problems arranging our reservation for a later time. \n\nWhen we arrived the restaurant was busy...and for a Wednesday evening that has to be a good sign that we were in for some good cuisine. We were greeted and seated. Our waiter was friendly, explained the menu. Since the foie gras ban date was rapidly approaching, we decided to take advantage and order it from their appetizer list. It came out with toast and it was perfectly cooked...buttery and flavorful, just as I would expect it to be. Next we decided to share the lobster risotto...it was cooked perfectly and they even offered to split the order into two individual bowls, since they knew we were sharing. For our main courses I decided to go lobster crazy and get the lobster pot pie and the husband ordered the lamb. The lobster pot pie was very good. Keep in mind that it's pretty filling, though. The fact that I ate the complimentary bread AND risotto filled me up faster than I was anticipating...so by the time I got to the lobster pot pie portion, I was getting full..but I tried to eat as much as I could, as it was so good! There were nice meaty chunks of lobster throughout the mixed cream sauce and the vegetables that came with the dish were excellent as well. The lamb was cooked perfectly...it was moist, tender and had hardly any of that gamey-ness that I often taste in other lamb dishes I've had before.\n\nThe service was stellar...the wait staff made themselves known they were there..but they weren't overly attentive which was nice. Our water glasses never found themselves empty.\n\nOverall, we had a fantastic experience here and are very pleased with our choice to try this place for dinner for our little special occasion.

However, food is important too.\n\nHere is what we ordered for the evening..skipping dessert because I was short on time.\n\n1) Squash soup &  bit size of a grilled cheese sandwich.  \n\nI'm not a fan of squash but it was pleasant.\n\n2) Sourdough bread with a spread of ricotta cheese topped with honey and rock salt. \n\nThe sourdough is good and love the added flavor of honey. So a plus for this one.\n\n3) Seafood starter - seared Hamachi \n\nI'm very critical on this since I've been to many sushi restaurants plus with a Japanese international roommate, I'm spoiled with real Japanese food. I like the Hamachi with cucumber sauce.  It's very light and refreshing.\n\n4)   5 seas which is 5 different fish prepared in 5 different ways.  \n\nI'm not impressed. It was decent but nothing to be remember as exceptional.\n\n5) We had dessert that they give but I ran out of time and need to make it out of the restaurant. A dinner that lasted more than 2 hours is a bit long.\n\nOverall all: 4/5", "author": "Michelle N."}

We just dined there last night and it was more than a meal...it was an EXPERIENCE. We had the chef's tasting menu and everything was absolutely fantastic. It was 9 courses of absolute heaven. Every single course was something I would gladly order again on its own. And for a 9 course meal, the portions were perfect. I found everything left me wanting just one more bite...except for the diver scallop in miso soup, I could've had 10 more bites of that! It was definitely my favorite. My wife's favorite course was the ribeye with bernaise (sp?) sauce....that was incredible too. I never realized food could taste THIS GOOD. I wish I were eloquent enough to express how just amazing this food is! And at the end of the night I was pleasantly satisfied...I definitely was not hungry but I wasn't overly satiated either. Really on point. \n\nThe drinks were spectacular as well. We both started with cocktails and had the \"bartender-on-a-whim\" where you tell them what kind of liquor you like, whether you like your drink dry or sweet, etc. and they make some incredible concoction for you. My wife had a gin drink and I started with a whiskey. Both were AMAZING. We were going to have a bottle of wine as well, but with how good these drinks were, I bailed on my wife and ordered two more, one with tequila and another with gin. She had a glass of the Oregon Pinot Noir which was great. The waiter even brought out a small glass of a Burgundy Pinot Noir for her to taste the difference! Wow!\n\nWhen I tell people about our experience last night, I find myself talking just as much about the service as the food and drinks. I've never experienced service like this before. It was fantastic. Giovanni, the captain, was spectacular. We basically put ourselves in his hands with the drinks and food and he delivered the most spectacular meal I could've ever hoped for. I have now dined at 6 or 7 Michelin-starred restaurants in the Bay Area, and Michael Mina is the best. And to be honest, it really isn't close. This was the best meal/date my wife and I have ever had while living in the Bay Area.  We will come here again, and we will come often.\n\nMy wife summed up our experience quite well as we were leaving. She said, \"I wish I had married a chef...\"", "author": "Mike N."}

Beautiful room with cheap seat covers...Completely distracted me. Bar service wasn't super friendly. Table service was ok...not super in sync like other places I've been with this price point. The tasting menu was just not what I expected from Michael Mina. It lacked a flow and a defining flavor. The amount of food for each serving left something to be desired. Frankly, we have paid less for incredible flavor, flow, and larger portions at Gary Danko. Plus, the fire alarm went off and ruined the last of our dinner. It just kind of topped off dinner...in an ear-bleeding kind of way. Have be honest...not Michael's best work. This place needs improvement, in my humble opinion.", "author": "Kristen C."}

I liked every dish there, so I wanted to try Michael Mina's other restaurants.  Finally, my husband and I went to Michael Mina in San Francisco last weekend.  My husband ordered a cocktail called Black Magic, which was made of Whisky.  He liked it a lot.  We decided to skip the tasting menu this time, since there were a few items on the regular menu that we wanted to try.  Therefore, we ordered from the regular menu, and shared everything we ordered.  We ordered the following dishes:\n1) Hors D'oeuvres, which included Grab Tartlet, Smoked Trout Croquette, Foie Gras PB&J, and Steak Tartare.\n2) Tuna Tartare and Hudson Valley Foie Gras\n3) Crispy Skin Dorade and Kurobuta Pork 'Cassoulet'\n4) One order of dessert.\nBefore our order came out, they served bread grilled with butter served with ricotta and honey.  The bread was so good.  The dishes that we ordered were delicious.  I like the way this restaurant does dessert.  It was started off with a small \"root beer float\".  The dessert was a small sampler of 6 different desserts; perfect for sharing.  The Brown Sugar Wafers were my favorite.\nOverall, I wanted to give this restaurant 5 stars. The wait staff was attentive, without being overbearing.   However, because of the little piece of plastic in my Smoked Trout Croquette, I have to take out one star.  I will definitely go back to the restaurant.  Hopefully, there will be no extra things in my food.  I am looking forward to giving them 5 stars.

The service was inexcusable for such a high-class restaurant, and the food was mediocre at best. I find it ironic that the first time a restaurant forgot to serve us bread was at one of the most expensive and well-regarded restaurants in San Francisco.\n\nIn addition, my wife had a stain on her tablecloth. I do not expect dirty tablecloths at a chain restaurant, much less a restaurant like Michael Mina. We asked them to replace the tablecloth; instead, the waiter came out and tried to clean the stain with a washcloth, interrupting our meal. Shockingly enough, he failed, and so we had to leave our table in the middle of our meal and go to the bar while it took them 30 minutes to replace the tablecloth. Why it took so long is beyond me.\n\nWe received no compensation for this interruption; we were just asked to resume our meal once they had managed to replace the tablecloth. The food was in no way, shape, or form good enough to warrant the price we paid. The only item I actually enjoyed somewhat was their macaroni and cheese, but even this was not that impressive.

OUR FOOD: we ordered the tasting menu (six courses for 125 each), which consisted of 2 oysters on the half, squid ink conchiglie, crispy skin black bass, risotto milanese, black angus new york strip, and a lemon/tarty linoln's avitar. having heard great things about the lobster pot pie, we asked sub it in...it was allowed for extra 15/person, we subbed it for the risotto. The lobster pot pie at MP that night was 75, so adding 15/person and taking out the risotto seemed worth it. The lobster was delicious, fresh, and i can understand the hype...i think though that the highlight of the six courses was definitely that steak, it was DELICIOUS, perfectly cooked, well flavored, and great with red wine. \n\nSummary. at the end of the night, after taxes, healthy sf tax, and tips, we forked over roughly 500 for the meal. definitely EXPENSIVE. in all honestly, I think I could have spent less at gary danko and had a more intimate and attentive experience with similar food, OR have spent a bit more for benu's tasting menu and have my mind blown away with their attentive staff and awesome food + wine pairing. the food at michael mina (while definitely not bad) was nothing to drool over, it is typical american fare done exceptionally well, but lacked the creativity and wow factor that i expected. the bathroom could have also been nicer, although the urinal splash guard was a nice touch (just saying).", "author": "Long C."}

I think Michael Mina has some of the most delicious, creative food in the city.  And for me, I usually shy away from \"creative\" food, as that can often mean chocolate pop rocks served with duck.  But here, the creativity enhances the taste.  At dinner, we had a wonderful shabu-shabu with Kobe beef and foie gras.  The brought the steaming broth to the table - delicious!\n\nThe wine list is wonderful and I have just asked the sommelier to pair wines he recommends with each course.  I have been pleased with every pairing.\n\nI loved Aqua but found it to be a bit stuffy for everyday lunches and mid week dinners.  This has amazing food, but the vibe is more approachable.\n\nI came to Yelp to rave and was pretty shocked when I saw some negative reviews.  I have had nothing but wonderful food and service.  I plan to have this be my \"go to\" spot for big time work lunches and my  place for special dinners.  I'll be back many times.", "author": "kristin w."}

Very nice and inventive drink menu, if you're a bourbon fan, try the Lou Reed.  At dinner we opted for the tasting menu with pairing to get the \"full\" Michael Mina experience.  The wines were excellent, not a fan of the wit beer that was paired with one of my wife's courses, otherwise everything paired well.  Food was good to very good, but not excellent, I would even dare say overpriced.  I would recommend doing the chef's tasting menu rather than the larger Ketto menu, which is a lot of food.  Unless, of course, you and your companion are famished!  Aside from feeling a little rushed for the first 3 courses (which slowed to a relaxed pace after), service was definitely the star here, from beginning to end everyone was very cordial, pleasant, and attentive.  Will I go back?  Probably, but likely for a lunch or an a la carte meal.  I will definitely go back for a drink!", "author": "John T."}

We had reservations at 6:30 and arrived a little early but were seated right away.  We've had dinner at the original Michael Mina a couple years ago.  The new location has a more modern look to it.  The menu has changed and now is mainly a la carte.  We shared the h'or dourves course and each got an appetizer and main course and both got the dessert sampler, but now reading that some people have shared one dessert sampler, we probably would've done that.  The h'or dourves included a crab \"blt\" (a play on BLT which was lettuce wrapped tempura crab with pork belly and a oven roasted mini tomato), pbj and foie gras  (a play on pbj, it was a huckleberry gelee and hazlenut), a salmon thing (it said cured trout on the menu, but I don't think it was), and a steak tartare topped with a quail egg.  They were very small portions and felt like a tease.  For starters, I had the tuna tartare, it was good and a good portion of it.  The waitress mixed it up as I watched which was cool because she explained every little ingredient as she did it.  For entree, I had the lamb chop, which was cooked pefectly and came with very hearty tasting lentils.  They didn't have a dessert menu but a dessert sampling which included 7 different little desserts coming out one by one.  They were all just okay.  All in all it was a good meal with great attentive service.", "author": "Gordon C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-10-26", "description": "I am completely astonished by the popularity of this restaurant.\n\nA restaurant is unable to serve delicious food when passion for the food itself is absent. It is clear that MM's passion has switched from the food to the money; this is evident through the overwhelming size of the establishment, the inexperience of the servers, the gruesome try-hard ambiance of the restaurant, and, sadly, the inattention to what is being served.\n\nFirstly, we ordered the tasting menu with tasting flight and (I had to try) the lobster pot pie. There was no menu for the tasting menu. This deeply concerned me, as it made me feel that either (a) the chef was audacious enough to improvise an entire six-course menu or (b) the chef was unprofessional enough to be unprepared. We were served three seafood dishes, deep-fried quail, and a rather disheartening cut of ribeye steak. The notable part of dessert was the chocolate lozenges, which were actually quite good. I do not know why we had three seafood dishes - raw salmon, raw mackerel (I assume, because the waitress rushed through the description), and a very lovely black cod - but I have an urge to blame the lack of a menu for the tasting menu. I should also note that while writing this review, I had to actually look these dishes up on my phone because these dishes were so forgettable and left absolutely no positive impression. \n\nI do not know why I was served deep-fried quail. If I wanted to eat a fried bird, I would have went out for chicken and waffles. The texture of the meat was actually very good, but I would have enjoyed this dish more as an appetizer as opposed to a dish leading up to the main course. Regarding the steak, I am tough to ask about it - anything that is not wagyu will be a disappointment to me. But the steak was definitely overcooked and it was so dry that I'd go as far to say that it would rival a steak at Cheesecake Factory. Oh right, and the bread was burnt. Needless to say, I was unable to completely finish any of my dishes, as I felt that the first bite was entirely sufficient and I did not feel like wasting numbers on my calorie intake. The only notable things I have tasted were: (1) the olive oil, (2) the chocolate lozenges, and (3) the small slice of heirloom tomato served on the side of the lobster pot pie.\n\nNow please let me tell you about the lobster pot pie. When you have several good things, you simply can't mash these several good things together and expect it to be an extraordinary thing. This is what the lobster pot pie tries to do. This dish has far too many all-star ingredients that are fighting for your attention - lobster, pastry, corn, brandy sauce, heirloom tomatoes. The different ingredients are competing for your tastebuds and it leaves your mouth confused, as there is no harmony between the flavors. Please understand that each ingredient could have been the spotlight of its own entree. Instead, MM decided to throw them all together - the result is a cacophonous disaster in your mouth.\n\nThe wine pairings made no sense. The wines just quite simply did not complement the foods. In fact, rather than enhancing, the wine disrupted the flavors of the dishes. Some of the wines they served us were so awful that drinking it made you focus on the disappointing taste of the wine rather than the food. I have seriously had better wine from Safeway. The lady pouring our wine was definitely not a sommelier. I felt like they simply chose the most attractive server and had her read the wine label for us. She did not explain anything about the wine or why the wine was paired with any specific entree.\n\nWe literally had nine different people serving us; granted, the service was repulsively impersonal. The initial waitress (whom I assumed would be our primary waitress) did not even introduce herself (nor did any of the eight other servers). The way they explained the dishes made it seem like they were regurgitating information from a notepad - it did not seem like they wanted to head into the culinary industry for their career. In fact, for one of the dishes, the gentleman who wiped down our table was the same gentleman who explained what our dish was. It's not that I disrespect him by any means - it's just that if I were to, for example, visit a company to meet with the CEO, I wouldn't want to speak with the receptionist about my concerns.\n\nI have never written a review this long before, nor have I ever been so serious about one. Michael Mina was perhaps the biggest disappointment in my dining experience. There are so many fantastic upscale restaurants in the area that it would be a waste of time, money, and energy to eat here.\n\nThe music being played at Michael Mina is a collection of mainstream pop songs that masquerade as something classier (whether it be because it's sung in a different language, played at a different tempo, or arranged with different instruments). After my experience at this restaurant, I have decided that it's quite fitting.", "author": "Jamie C."}

I guess I expected more considering it was Michael Mina. \n  \nThe question it comes down to is: was the food good enough for the price?  In my opinion no.  There were 2 meal options to choose from: the 3 course meal or the 7 course fish meal.  To choose the 7 course meal your whole party had to  order it (disappointing and confusing...if I split the group into 2 parties could I order the 7 course?  Is it so everyone is eating a course everytime food is served?  I don't get it).  We ended up with the 3 course meals.  \n\nReview of my meal:\nCitrus salad with lobster:  this was really good!\nBeef dish with brussel sprouts:  Beef was cooked to a perfect medium, however the cut was a bit stringy/ chewy on one side (the other side was melt in your mouth perfect)\nChocolate custard:  custard was fantastic, ground up pistachios paired perfectly, but the walnuts on top just didn't go with the fantastic custard.\n\nOther people's meals:\nSquid ink seafood pasta: I had a bite of my sister's food...so good we both wished they served it as a main instead of an appetizer \n\nDuck: the one bite of  I had duck was really good\n\nSpice cake with brown butter ice cream:  Mmmmm could have eaten a lot more than just the bite i had\n\nService:\nService was attentive enough.  I would give it a good overall rating.\nBread  and water was a little slow to reach the table initially, however, after that our glasses were constantly refiled and we were offered multilple servings of bread, so the bus boy did a pretty good job.  I thought the waiter could have been more attentive.  I personally like the waiter to introduce the menu briefly instead of just hand them to us and come back.  Meals were introduced well once they were served. \n\nOverall, I would say good food and service.  As for the cost? Not justifed.  I'm glad I tried it and I did enjoy it, but I'd probably try another place instead of coming back.", "author": "Tabitha S."}

My son took care of the menu and signed their detailed contract. We were supposed to be in a private area for our guests. When we arrived the first person that my husband saw was his 90 yr mother seating right there,front and center in front of the front door so much for the surprise. She was sitting at a table with with 3 other guests. The other family members were sitting and standing at a separate table.  I was very disappointed at the entire set-up. Who does that!  Nothing was put together for our arrival and our guests were all very uncomfortable. The tables were not arranged for a birthday party at all. I do a better job at my house for parties. Two of our guests did not make it and thank goodness for that because the way that our table was arranged we couldn't fit the 2 guests. It's sad because in our contract we were locked into 18 people. So we did the manager a favor with 16. If the 2 other guests arrived they would have sat by themselves because there was no room to squeeze them in. The following Monday my son contacted the Michael Mina to tell them how disappointed we all were with everything and to see if they would take care of the 2 guests that didn't show up from our bill. No luck at all. You would think that they would make some kind of exception to their detailed contract. They sure make sure that everything is in writing for  the client but they fail to take care of their  own mistakes. Our family are all born and raised in San Francisco, natives. Attended all girls high schools, and the guys a well know high school in the Sunset. Two of the men own their own businesses in San Francisco and I have to tell you if they ran their business like Michael Mina they would have no clients.  Well, to top it off at our Christmas dinner my husband's 80 yr. uncle told me how bad that he thought the place was. That isn't what I wanted to hear about our very $$$$$ expensive dinner. \nIf you are planning your dinner for 16-18 guest don't do it they just can't accommodate your party and they will charge you and arm and a leg and get away with doing what ever they want because they have you locked into your contract.\nThe food wasn't that great either. My fish was dry and others didn't finish their meals.\nDon't waste your time or money on this place because San Francisco is full of great places to have your family dinners.", "author": "Annelle B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-19", "description": "We were the first (or maybe second) dinner patrons on opening night.  We were celebrating not only the reincarnated Michael Mina's day of birth but also Mrs. Neema J.'s 33rd.  We had been to the old Union Square location several times before the move to this new FiDi location.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meals very much.  The quality was about the same as the former Michael Mina, though the presentation was slightly more innovative.  The primary reason for docking the restaurant a star was that some of the prices seemed a bit high.  While the place was great, I feel my c-notes go a little further at Gary Danko.\n\nA unique aspect to the menu was the extra squash souffle course that one could order between the appetizer and the main.  I believe was $21 per person, so at $42 for about half dozen bites each, it's pricey.  (The sfgate menu is wildly off.)  We had to try it, however, and it was delicious.  Perhaps not objectively worth 42 Sacajaweas, so I would probably not order it again, but I'm glad I got to try it.\n\nSome of the appetizers and main dishes are carryovers from the previous Michael Mina, such as the Tuna Tartare and Lobster Pot Pie.  For appetizers, we ordered the hamachi and the foie gras, and they met expectations.  For my main course, I had the duo of fish, which was fantastic.  It was served with a delicious sauce that the server said was lobster based, though my Persian-refined palate recognized that it was composed heavily of pomegranate.  The birthday girl had the rib eye caps, which she also enjoyed.  All of the courses, including the appetizers, were very large -- maybe too much so.\n\nI feel I must warn everyone about the dessert course.  There are no choices and no dessert menu -- as our waiter put it, \"you either order dessert or you don't.\"  The pastry chef essentially put together a tasting menu of approximately six or seven different mini desserts that ran the gamut from white chocolate pieces to apple sorbet to chocolate-covered marshmallows (they were much more fancy than my description implies).  Although the desserts were all delicious, the lack of choice could definitely turn off people who are pickier or who are craving something specific for dessert.  Non-chocolate lovers, for example, probably wouldn't have liked half of the desserts.  Mrs. Neema J. is a sucker for Michael Mina root beer float, and was a little disappointed that it wasn't a dessert option at the new restaurant.  (Note to Michael Mina Menu Makers:  bring back the root beer float.)  We were charged $30 for two for dessert, though there was no printed menu to know the price ahead of time.  Given the amount of food they gave, this was actually a reasonable cost.  The dessert sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord was made even more ridiculous by the (yummy) cake and ice cream the servers delivered for my wife's birthday.\n\nThe service was fantastic.  Our waiter, who was essentially a doppelg\u00e4nger of one of my coworkers -- and thus significantly at risk of coming across as creepy (not because my coworker is creepy, but because it's just strange) -- was very attentive, friendly, and helpful.", "author": "Neema J."}

The decor makes you feel like you entered a completely different place from where you entered.. very dark and modern.\nWe pretty much shared everything:\nThe amuse bouche was a butternut squash soup with a piece of cheese toast... delicious.\nFor starters, we shared the hamachi crudo, which came with 5 small but veryy flavorful and crisp portions. We also had a half-dozen fresh oysters, which are always good.\nFor entrees, we shared the lobster pot pie, duo of crispy fish, truffle-stuffed jidori chicken, and braised pork short rib.\nI got the lobster pot pie primarily because of how popular it was. It was a loose take on \"pot pie\" since it was a flaky pie crust with large pieces of lobster ladled on top with the sauce. It was good, but not quite worth it  for the market price ($80). If I had known that it was that much, I would not have gotten it and would have opted for another entree.\nOf the entrees, I'd say that the short rib was the best one, and especially for the price ($32). It was very tender and seasoned well. The chicken is also worthy of mentioning, as it was SO moist and perfectly cooked. The foie gras rice was DELICIOUS and paired perfectly with it. \nService was impeccable that night. I loved that each portion of the meal and each entree had a server explaining the different components so that you can truly appreciate the meal.\nOverall, if you're looking for a good indulgent meal, come here.

Everyone is on their game.  They all communicate very well and are aware of each of their guests and what is going on.  Impressive staff.  \n\nWine selection.  Like all other Mina restaurants, there is an excellent selection.\n\nI've been to several Mina restaurants, about 6 of them and I also ate at the original Michael Mina's in the Westin St. Francis.  \n\nThe bread they serve is excellent but what really puts it over the top is the honey, butter (with some kindof cheese), for the spread.  Unique and very tasty.  \n\nThis is what I think they miss on.  \n\n1) The presentation of the Lobster Pot Pie.  Mind you, this is a market price item.  It is Mina's most famous dish.  I've seen it a couple of his restaurants and I believe its a holdover from the original restaurant.  I seem to recall that back at the Westin, it was served in an actual pot.  My memory may be off.  This dish, however, is served on a square plate, which is fine.  My big complaint though, is that when the server took out the pot pie and started to place the sauce, lobster and braised kale, the dish just gets sloppy.  It gets sloppy fast.  The sauce starts to spread all over the plate and the lobster falls off the dough.  The kale is a mess.  I know I'm splitting hairs but this dish just doesn't look like a 75 dollar dish.  Something just isn't right.  Everything was placed in the corner of the square plate and falling all over the place.  It just doesn't seem right to have all of this good stuff spread out on the plate like that.  \n\n2) I think its a strategic mistake to sell the desserts as a plate of five different items.  My wife loves sweets.  Absolutely loves them.  For the first time in my life, I saw her say no to the desserts.  She just didn't want a plate of all five.  She just wanted one of them.  I understand its unique and I give the pastry chef kudos for trying something new but I don't think this one executes well.  I'd be curious to see how well this is doing.  How many do they sell and is it meeting expectations.  I realize that desserts may be considered secondary but for some places we have visited, this has been the best thing that we've tried.  For us to not even get exposed to what the pastry chef is capable is both frustrating and disappointing.  Just my opinion but I think I'd prefer to pick one individually.  Some people just don't care to try all different kinds of sweets.  Why would one spend their money on all five when they really just want to try one.  \n\nLike all other Mina restaurants, you should expect to pay a premium.", "author": "Mark K."}

My date is a vegetarian, and they don't have any vegetarian options, so they put a pasta dish together for him anyway! The server was extremely accommodating. I asked for his suggestion, which was the duck. I've had duck before and while I like the flavor, it tends to be too fatty for me. This duck was different. The skin was perfectly crispy, with a thin layer of fat that wasn't slimy or chewy. Just perfectly cook and absolutely delicious. We also had a table by the window which was nice.", "author": "Lindsay S."}

We went for our anniversary.  We had drinks where were good.  We split the Tuna Tartare was excellent, best I've ever had, including sushi.  We also split the Scallops, which were jaw-dropping...just amazing.  All the small bites that came with were excellent.  She got the duck, which was very good to me (and I'm not a big fan of duck) so I'm assuming it was at least excellent by duck-lovers' standards.  I had the filet, which was good, but not great; it was a little on the dry side.  If I could go back and do it again, I would probably split the duck and get a full order of the tuna and scallops for myself.", "author": "Ronan L."}

Because I had my fill of fine dining in my early years in LA and had subpar experiences at a few places in the bay area.  I now seek out those small, hidden places where you have a more authentic choice in foods and the quantity won't make you snicker.  But... we were given a gift certificate years ago which we avoided using until I had a relative in town for business.  Where to take them for dinner? Done! It was close to their hotel and we needed to rid of this certificate.  \n \nI'm not a foodie.  And because I've eaten foods throughout Asia and grew up in LA with the best Japanese/Asian foods you can find outside of Japan/Asia (although Bangkok has some kick ass sushi) or have written a few reviews of food establishments in my 40 something years of being able to feed myself I would still not call myself a foodie.  It seems the trend to call yourself a foodie if your in your 20's, have just enough money to eat out, are the first in your group of friends to try some weird, exotic plate or something like Michael Mina's is one of 3 \"fine dining\" establishments you've tried in your lifetime. \n\nI didn't go in thinking I was already doomed.  I've heard good reviews from people I know.  But never a reliable source, even from people you think you know well.  \nA few items that stand out, and not because they were outstanding, but because they left me saying to myself \"really\"??  Sashimi starters.  Complete waste of time and energy trying to pick up the small morsels with my warped chopsticks.  And the grating of the fresh wasabi at the table...  I can see where most prideful Japanese would roll their eyes at this one.  Any quality $ = authentic = Japanese owned/run sushi establishment will have fresh wasabi although you may have to ask since they keep it hidden.  There isn't enough fish in a bite to feel the texture and consistency of the fish or taste for that matter.  Blue fin is a prized catch and very rare to find in sushi bars.  At it's best it will melt in your mouth without having to use your molars.  These did not despite the miniature barbie size.  Hamachi starter just was.\nBlah blah blah, we ordered a few dishes from each section.  Appetizers, starters, middle (black truffle risoto felt/tasted bland).  The wagyu loins we individually ordered as an entree were the life jackets on this sinking ship.  But we live right up the street from Alexander's steak house in the south bay so....\nYes, service was impeccable with a little hint of robot'ish.  I finished off the night with a glass of Michael Mina's own bourbon blend, not bad.  All in all the $600+ price tag wasn't worth the food but for the time I had to spend with my relative.\n\nGo here if your: calling yourself a foodie.  Can't count the number of 5 star restaurants on one hand you've been to.  Or trying to impress your under 20 something date.  Don't go here if your a seasoned eater or trying to impress someone that also is.", "author": "No I Don't Have Time F."}

It was with a large party so caveat that for anyone who wants to write it off as an excuse. The food was mediocre and value terrible so this was pretty crummy, if not for the surplus of wine and lively conversation at dinner, could have drifted into \"I would never come back\" territory.\nTaste: a tasting menu for a large party took the whole night first of all (no really, like 3+ hours!) and a few dishes did taste good, not impressive as a whole. Lots of salt and butter, food combinations were fine but not inspiring or particularly complimentary (maybe my palette just isn't refined enough, I know)\nService: clearly the highlight of the four main criteria, server was consistently around and knowledgeable. \nAmbiance: prob would have been better if we weren't seated in what appeared to be a hallway near the bathroom instead of the main dining room. Not sure what the logic was (maybe the main dining room is for 2 and 4 person tables)\nValue: for 200 a person (or whatever it really was including wine), not a lot of value there. A la carte would have been better, but it's definitely on the high side of pricing for a restaurant downtown and I don't think even Michael Mina would argue with that statement\nOverall:8/20, harsh I know.

This restaurant was a step above in every category. The food was phenomenal, the service impeccable, and the entire dining experience surprised me (in a good way). To be completely honest I wasn't super excited by the menu beforehand, but when presented I was pleasantly astounded by the creativity, presentation and taste. \nI would HIGHLY recommend starting with the hors d'oeuvres platter. The four miniature morsels excite your palate and begin the adventure. Each person at our table (4 total) loved the main course they ordered the most, which is rather convenient. I had the Michael Mina version of \"chicken parmesan.\" The name is used loosely but I loved the taste. When our dishes were presented each person at our table had their own server- who had some sort of foam or sauce or mixing activity to activate our meal.

My main course of trout was pretty darn heavenly, and the potato gratin with pancetta and fava beans nicely complemented it.  The sampling of desserts was out of control.  The little nibbles I had of the chocolate honey \"lozenges,\" jasmine wafers, and the campfire marshmallows were to die for.

My friends ordered the Avocado and Burrata salad with lobster.  Wonderful plating and presentation.  Hello, where's the avocado?  Both salads were missing the avocado. Shouldn't whoever was expediting notice that one of the main ingredients was missing?!  It was mentioned to the waiter and a few slivers of avocado were brought out.  Oxtail bucatani was flavorful but overly salty and missing the oxtail.  I was expecting a velvety ragu while this was bucatini sitting in a thin brown/wine gravy.  This was about 4-6 bites for $19.  There was a fish entree, chicken entree, beef, pork and vegetarian entree.  Nothing very exciting. except for the suckling pig.I opted for the vegetarian entree which was a cheese (can't remember what kind) tortellini.  Not what I expected for $20.  There were 6 tortellini sitting in a broth with a few fresh peas reminscent of wonton soup.  Tasty but not filling.\n\nHalf the table ordered suckling pig with crispy skin.  The minute it came to the table I knew that it wasn't suckling pig.  Each plate had 3 large chunks of roasted pork (like the roasted pigs hanging in Chinese delis, but seasoned differently).  Each chunk was approximately  2 inches by 2.5 inches.  There is not any part of a suckling pig that is that thick.  Yes, I'm Chinese and I'm picky but I've had suckling pig at Tru in Chicago and it was amazing and delicate.  This was neither.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the citrus tart and the cheese plate.

I'm salivating just typing about it now.  We started with the chilled shellfish platter- clams, oysters, crab, ceviche, and lobster were delicious and nicely complimented by 2 glasses of Krug Grand Cuvee.\nThen we moved on to the tuna tartare (just ok, pine nuts were overpowering) and foie gras with pineapple buckwheat crepe, which was excellent.\nBeing the dainty ladies we are, we asked to split the lobster pot pie, which was deconstructed and absolutely delicious.  While we were enjoying it, chef Mina came over to introduce himself and seemed pretty enamored with my gal pal, who was smiling and batting her eyelashes.  He lingered for a little bit to make some small talk, then excused himself to make the rounds around his beautiful very-open and perfectly lit new space (the former Aqua).\nAll in all, a spectacular dinner.

I've heard so many good things about this restaurant and it was high time that I saw it for myself. \n\nI have a few criteria in deciding whether or not a restaurant is up to snuff: \n1) Whether or not they can whip up a good gimlet which involves: a) good gin and b) fresh lime juice\n2) The wait staff: Attentiveness (which includes not only they way they interact with you but also whether or not they can pick up on body language to clue them into whether they are needed or need to go away or at least come back later)\n3) Ambiance: lighting and the general \"energy\" of the place\n4) Good food (obviously)\n\nMichael Mina not only made me a fabulous gimlet (the bartender was also kind enough to help me figure out what I've been doing wrong all along whenever I make one for myself at home), the waiters seemed to have this sixth sense as to knowing when to approach our table to inquire how things are going, refilling our water, etc. The restaurant had great lighting--Now, I realize that I've delved deep into the food/restaurant snob end of the spectrum, but it's surprising how important lighting is--it's hard to enjoy yourself or the person/people you are with when you've got a fluorescent bulb shining on your face. Lighting sets the mood, which contributes to the overal feel of the space. You combine great lighting, great wait staff (I'm talking pros here who really pay close attention to subtle cues), good seating configuration, which leads to the way the room flows and how people move about in that space, etcetera, etcetera...put all of that together, top that with great food (as if adding a perfect little cherry on a dollop of whipped cream crowning a well constructed ice cream sundae) and you've got yourself a great restaurant. \n\nMichael Mina has been officially added to my \"must-eat at\" list in San Francisco. I am already looking forward to the next time.", "author": "April B."}

I have to say that Michael Mina restaurants are Legit! We had the 9 course tasting and honestly I feel that more than 9 courses came out. The progression of the courses from the seafood to the finale of Japanese wagyu steak was seamless. Loved every dish that came out. Who doesn't love amebi ( raw rock shrimp), king salmon, mussels, lobster, black cod, hamachi, king crab, prime filet, and to top it off the Japanese wagyu had a texture and consistensy that truly was amazing. I know im missing some of the dishes but honestly I couldn't keep up with the parade of awesome food. The dessert was actually 4 courses which surprised me since I was so done by then. The only negative was the heaviness and sweetness of the last mousse course. Very rich if you like that.

Recently, for my birthday, I went there and was not as impressed, as I had been in the past. The grilled bread with honey and ricotta cheese was still delicious but the bread was not as toasty as it had been in past visits.  The lobster corn dogs were gross.  The waitress was not attentive and did not provide quality service.  We ordered drinks, a whiskey cocktail (this was the \"on the whim\" drink on the menu, which is supposed to be where you inform them of a few ingredients like and the bartender makes something special for you, but the waitress did not ask any questions regarding the preference for the drink) and an iced tea, that did not arrive until after our appetizers had been served.  It was not until I noticed another table that arrived after us had received their drinks and that I asked that waiter about the status of our drinks that someone checked and brought them to our table. At no point did our waitress ask us whether we enjoyed the dishes or needed anything.  At one point the hostess came and removed our plates.  I will say the support staff, including the individual bringing the bread basket and water, did a good job.  My boyfriend surprised me and ordered a dessert tasting without me knowing.  While they put a candle on one of the desserts, the service throughout the meal was nonexistent and not the kind of service you would expect from an establishment like Michael Mina's or on one's birthday.  For instance, when the desserts started coming, the server never came by to wish me a Happy Birthday or ask me if I wanted coffee (which I actually wanted to order).  I give it a three star because the food was good but the service definitely has gone down hill.  There are a lot of restaurants in the bay area that provide better service and similar quality of food.  It is too bad that Michael Mina's has fallen.", "author": "Judy C."}

Keep in mind, I generally don't like eating at over-priced restaurants since I tend to walk away thinking how overrated the food was... BUT MMs was not overrated. The food and the service were fantastic!! I feel like I went on and on for days about how much I enjoyed the food - especially the honey and ricotta cheese spread - and the very-friendly, accommodating service. (When we couldn't get over the grilled cheese and butternut squash tasting, they generously gave us another round for free - I think. I guess I didn't check the bill. Haha.) They also did table-side service for several of our plates, which I found entertaining and informative as they described each ingredient as they plated it. It became a little crazy when the pasta came out since we ordered one of each and there were 3 pastas being plated at the same time but again, I didn't mind since the food was delicious. Btw, the lobster pot pie is $80. I was a little startled by the price and disappointed that I didn't get to finish it by the time we got to the main course. Delicious!

Just around the corner from union square and near my daughter's work  we had a simple walk to a great restaurant.  Having eaten in many of the finest restaurants in the country- French Laundry, Alinea, Tru (in the day), Per Se, and many others, I would have to rate our experience as wonderful. We had the Ketto prix Fixe and wine  pairing. The meal is set up as a Duo for each course- 9 of them in all.  As a couple we each tried 18 wines and tastings.  Needless to say we had opportunities for failures. However, it just didn't happen. The pairings were delicious and despite a late evening sitting, our 3.5 hour meal was delightful as we ended the night as the last, very satisfied customers.  Our wait staff were knowledgeable and pleasant and we're attentive without distraction.  I have read many reviews of the restaurant on yelp and just don't see where the criticism comes from.

Third is the salmon, nothing special. Duck breast was ok. The last savory course was rib eye. That was pretty good. Dessert was red velvet cake. Too dense and nothing special. It did look pretty on the plate. My biggest complaint for the meal is the long wait in between courses. I guess we were just unlucky as the table next to us which came in an hour later than us finishes around the same time we did with the same 6 courses. Bottom line I think there's better choice for $120 per person tasting menu. I would definitely NOT go back.", "author": "C. C."}

I thought the service was excellent and I really enjoyed the small bites they gave us while waiting for our main course.  The mushroom soup is very good and their presentation is very nice.  Also, the ambiance is probably one of my favorite in any restaurant I have been too.  It felt cozy yet classy yet relaxing.  It seemed a nice place for a business dinner, but could still be taken as romantic.  I ordered the cod and the pork, the cod was delicious.  The cod came apart very easily and was very tasty.  I thought the pork was okay.  My boyfriend got the suckling pig, and I believe he liked his a good amount.  They gave us macaroons to-go which I thought were just okay as well.

It is basically a tasting menu for dessert.  And none of them stood out as memorable.  Terribly disappointing and a very bad way to end a meal.

I felt that it needed a squeeze of fresh lemon or...something more.I was hungry but didn't eat the second one. \n\nSeared Diver Scallops - I can't remember if it was 3 or 4 large scallops perfectly seared with frissee and lemon cream. These were delicious and I highly recommend them as a course. If you like your scallops on the more well done side, mention that when you order, because they came a bit translucent in the middle.\n\nI had a bite of my vegetarian friend's Tortellini with Hedgehod Mushrooms, parmesan-reggiano and barigoule broth. It was delicious, al dente with nice earthy flavors. \n\nI also had a bite of her grilled cheese, which was delish (from the soup/grilled cheese appetizer duo).\n\nCoffee - I appreciated the steamed milk that came with it, but the coffee was not very good. Next time, I would order a latte or cappucino instead.\n\nAfter we ordered, they brought us each slice of freshly baked bread and put soft, salty, creamy butter on the table.\n\nThe service and ambiance is nice, but I would expect a little more from a place whose dishes are small but pricey.

Excellent both times!\n\nI remember for my 30th birthday that Mina was still very much doing the trios as I had a starter trio of foie gras followed by my main trio of lamb.  There was a birthday card waiting for me at the table signed by the manager. When dessert came around, they gave me a cookie that said \"Happy birthday Kelley!\" in chocolate around the plate along with a single candle.  Very  nice touches. :)  When I got up to go to the restroom, I came back to a fresh napkin at my place.  Service was attentive and as good as it gets!\n\nI ended up forgetting the birthday card by accident and ran back into the restaurant.  The staff searched all over for it, but couldn't find it. The host said that Michael Mina was out of town, but would be back in a few days.  To make up for the lost birthday card, he said that he'll have Mina fill out one of the cards and they'll mail it to me.  Sure enough about a week later, I got a birthday card from Michael Mina himself! =) =) =)\n\nFast forward to my boyfriend's birthday last month and Mina's new location.  I love the modern simple design of the new space.  Tables were spaced out enough so you couldn't hear your neighbor's conversation, but not so spread out you felt like the place was sparse.  Again, another birthday card already at the table made out to my boyfriend and signed by the manager.\n\nThe \"gift from the chef\" was a chilled asparagus soup that was the best asparagus soup I've ever had!  It tantalized my tastebuds and made me salivate more on the goodies to come that night.\n\nThe waitress was very helpful on helping us pick out dishes without just saying \"everything's great here!\"  My partner got the pork belly and geoduck clam salad, and I got the nantucket bay scallops to start.  Both were deconstructed, but still recognizable.  The amazing part was the surprise of flavors that erupted from both dishes!  I love how Mina's dishes look unassuming and then surprises you in the taste.  The sizes were perfect to satisfy your tastebuds.\n\nWe split the kabocha squash souffle with black truffle cream.  The souffle was crispy on the outside and so fluffy and airy in the middle!  The black truffle cream was a perfect companion.\n\nMy partner's main was the braised korubata pork, and mine was the jidori chicken breast.  The pork was in a thick rich sauce that was so good my partner thought he had died and gone to pork heaven.  My chicken was moist, flavorful (hard for chicken!), and the skin was perfectly crispy.  I was getting full by this point so couldn't fully enjoy my chicken like I had intended to.\n\nAs it was my partner's birthday, we got a dessert gift of 2 little apple crisp tarts along with a deconstructed piece of chocolate cake w/ a scoop of ice cream to share.\n\nMichael Mina's definitely remains my top recommendation for a birthday dinner!", "author": "Kelley P."}

Attentive, but not intrusive, great recommendations for both food and wine, everything served hot, nice explanations of everything. Not sure it could have been a lot better.\n\nOther than the extensive wine list. that's about it for high points. It's not that the food was bad, it wasn't, but it was just OK. For example, the souffle was really more a [slightly undercooked] muffin than anything resembling a delicate souffle. Tasted OK, but heavy. The chicken was incredibly tender, but the accompaniments didn't do much to make it more than just tender chicken. The accompanying foie gras rice was too salty. The lamb was tender, but again, it was just tender lamb with not much else to recommend it; the couscous was salty and heavy (lots of stuff in it). \n\nAll in all the food was fine, not great. It was cheaper than the old MM, but certainly not the same caliber (other than the service and wine list). I do hope MM gets it together, as sad to say, I can't recommend it for one of those really special meals like Gary Danko, The Inn at Little Washington (several years back when the owners were still together), or the old MM.", "author": "Rina B."}

We were expecting the meal of a lifetime and got bad service and tasteless food.  We were a party of 10 who arrived Sat night for an 8:30 rezzie.  They did not seat us until almost 9:30, in spite of the fact that the place looked half- empty.  \n\nWhile waiting at the bar, I ordered a grey goose martini, dirty, straight up, two olives.  I was shocked when it was served in a small cheap round martini glass with a short stem that one would typically find at a wedding bar service at a Marriott.    For that expensive a drink and the supposed grand ambience of a restaurant named after a super chef, I expect to be served a martini in a large, gorgeous, diamond shaped martini glass.  The drink should be ice- cold and well- made.  This was not.  Nuff said. \n\n Dinner was a huge disappointment. The amuse bouche was ok, a grilled cheese bite and chestnut soup, it probably was the highlight of the whole meal.  Toasted bread with a honey butter was also served and was pretty good.  After that, it went downhill.   For appetizer, I ordered the Kona Kampachi Sashimi - for $18 - it literally was five small pieces of raw rolled up fish with some random pomegranate seeds thrown on the plate.  They sprinkled it with grated soy salt (supposedly aged over a decade or something like that).  Too bad the soy salt did not add any flavor to the completely tasteless dish.  A complete waste of money.  The $42 dollar scallop entree was better but not remarkable.  The scallops were large and moist but I can't recall what else was on the plate.  My husband ordered the roast black cod with sweet and sour pork.  The pork was chewy and over cooked.  The cod was done well and was the highlight of the dish.  The rice under the cod was your standard white sticky rice. \n\n Sticker shock is that we were at $335 a couple at the end of the night. \n\n Do yourself a huge favor and go to Masas instead.

The Foie gras cherry was cute and the foie gras veloute was quite tasty. Very impressed by the creative idea of having shaving Foie gras logs onto the salad. The spread that comes with the bread is lovely, it is mixture of mascarphone, ricotta, olive oil & honey and if you like your spread on the sweet side, then you would love this. All the above is what the 3 stars is about. All the dishes after that does not taste like it comes from a Michelin star restaurant. The dishes were just too salty, the mac & cheese is worse than regular mac & cheese. It is basicaly a stuffed pasta of duck meat and supposedly with foie gras which we didn't taste any. We cannot tast any foie gras in the following dishes except when the foie gras is a seared piece by itslef. In summary, they have not done a good job at all in trying to incorporate foie gras into the tasting menu. At the end, I wish I had just gone somewhere and ordered a plain seared foie gras by itself. Very disappointed about Michael Mina, no doubt it dropped from a 2 star to 1 star.", "author": "Mimi L."}

Well it was meant to be. Best seats in the house - the corner of the bar with a full view of the whole perfectly lit, artistically designed restaurant. Raimundo was as good as a server gets - so much more than your average bartender. But then, \"average\" has nothing to do with this place. Elderberry cocktail was over the top amazing. Treats from the chef announced early that this would be a top ten meal. Bread - always a great barometer of what to expect,  predicted the \"weather\" masterfully with its roasted crust and chewy belly. Burrata and hamachi sashimi were perfect leads into the lamb entree that was off the chart - paired with savory chard and tofu. And the final chef treat - a spoonful of tapioca infused with pomegranate - was so perfect that we had no urge - or room left - to add dessert on at the end. We will be back - no question - and Michael Mina's could well be the motivation for our next visit from Colorado.", "author": "Lise B."}

Portions are small even on the a la carte menu, but you are expected to select several courses and thus leave satisfied.  The wine list is good, we did not opt for the wine pairing, but this is always a fun option.

We arrived early and were the first customers to arrive.  We were seated fifteen minutes late.  I ordered two Napa Cabernets at $16 each.  The wine was served in a Chardonnay glass.  Being a wine person, and the fact that I spent $200 dollars on a dinner for two at a known high end restaurant like Michael Mina's, I would expect that they would serve a Cabernet wine, like most red wines, in a proper red wine glass.  When I inquired with the manager a couple days later, the manager informed me that they automatically serve a red wine in a proper red wine glass if the customer purchases a bottle at the restaurant, or brings their own wine bottle in, with a $35 corkage fee of course.  The manager further explained that a proper red wine glass would have been used for a wine by the glass order upon the customers request.  How is a customer suppose to know this.  In my opinion the manager's excuse was LAME.  The manger did not offer any suggestion to make this up to me as a customer.  I guess a customer has to be a mind reader or spend more then $200 for a dinner to have wine served in a proper glass.  I would expect more from a high end restaurant like Michael Mina.  I will NOT return to this restaurant again.\n\nEd Estrada\nNewark, California", "author": "Ed E."}

We started with the roasted beets with gorgonzola and pistachio, absolutely delicious.  The table shared an order of the lobster risotto which was so decadent yet not too heavy.  Finally I had the lobster pot pie which was perfectly cooked.  The pastry was just a little to hard but other than that, it was superb.  My husband ordered the venison that was like butter!  Perfectly cooked and almost melted in your mouth.  The other great thing I like about the restaurant it that it wasn't noisy.

We were in town briefly and saw all the great reviews for this place, so we decided to try it.   We ordered their 9 course tasting menu, without wine pairing, for $160 per person.  It was pretty pricey but it came out to be pretty interesting and tasty experience.  You have to order this with another person since it's actually 18 different dishes.  The waiter decides who gets what dish but it's meant for sharing and tasting.  I had some food restrictions but they were very easily accommodating to that and made suitable substitutions for anything I was uncomfortable with on their menu.  Throughout the dishes, they also gave us complimentary dishes or 'amuse bouche', so the 9 course meal actually ended up being 12 courses, not counting their infamous bread with honey butter spread.  We were very full at the end, and was able to taste all sorts from soups, salads, fowl, lobster, steak, and 3 different desserts ranging from chocolates to fruits.  The dinner took about 3 hours, so it's an experience in itself, but with that they present you with 18 different and beautifully presented courses, so it's a pretty amazing and savory experience.", "author": "Joodee Y."}

So we were somewhat overdosed on good food and great wine.  \nMy daughter and I made a reservation the same day and showed up dressed down after a day in SF walking and touring since we were staying close to the airport.  We were treated as if we were the best customers ordering the most expensive wine and food in the restaurant (we didn't come close). David was our waitor and I will ask for him next time we come because he made our evening perfect.  We ordered two appetizers and one main and we shared everything.  We also had a couple of glasses of wine. David helped us with recommendations and consistently checked in to make sure we were happy with our meal.  Everything came out pre-split for us and looking great.  We also shared a dessert plate. Not only was our waiter amazing but so was the sommelier who also checked in and made sure that we enjoyed everything and helped match wines to the food.  The assistant manager and the chef game over too making us feel very special.   I thought the food was creative, extremely well presented  and delicious.  We loved the duck and the foie gras. The specialty, the tuna tartare was the only slight and I do mean slight disappointment since it could have been a little spicier but it was excellent quality tuna and again beautifully presented as a deconstructed event simultaneously constructed by David and our sommelier.    I also thought the meal was a good value. My husband and I had just come back from Hong Kong, Singapore and Melbourne and this restaurant compared very well with the Napa list above and the restaurants we visited in those cities. As a matter of fact, it was one of the best meals I have had in the US and I will be coming back soon all the way from upstate New York and bringing my husband.", "author": "Robert L."}

I started with the wine -- the chenin blanc was vinegar -- just really surprising for this restaurant and $12 a glass.  But okay, not a big deal really, maybe it was a bad bottle, and the sauvignon blanc I had later more than made up for it.  The amuse bouche was a lovely soup and grilled cheese, very nice, and for appetizer I had the lobster risotto, which was okay.  In the future I will stick with the tuna tartare which Michael Mina created for Aqua and still does not disappoint.  My biggest problem was the entree.  I ordered the rib eye which was good, although I preferred a little more salt.  BUT, I had a nicely arranged plate with 2 pieces of nice rib eye steak, and one piece of browned stew meat!!!!  WHAT?????  How did a piece of stew meat end up on my plate???  There was no mistaking the bland soft stringy stew meat, for the tender pink rib eye I had just eaten, and honestly I felt completely deceived.  One of my co-diners suggested that maybe it was a piece of rib eye that was just prepared differently, but I don't buy it.  It seemed like a cost saving measure to me -- maybe they thought I had enough wine to not tell the difference? MM was this on purpose or some sort of accident?  I REALLY dislike stew, and I almost forgot about the rest of the meal after those two bites... it just ruined the entire experience for me. For the price I was underwhelmed.", "author": "Alena M."}

My boyfriend and I wandered into Michael Mina post World Series Game 2 after being at the stadium to watch the Giants crush the Rangers 0-9 (I'm not a baseball expert, but was totally impressed and riding off the high of the energy of the event). Like the other 99% of San Fran, we were clad proudly in our orange and black, jeans, and I had just removed my knit panda hat. Despite our casual attire and no reservation, the staff at Michael Mina treated us as if we were decked in our finest and awarded us with warm smiles and a beautiful table. We had an incredible meal with very memorable dishes (fois gras, the tableside prepared tuna tartare, the fish 5 ways, and the duck were all impressive in their own right, perfectly prepared, and incredibly presented).\n\nSecond review from May 31st: When my parents announced that they would be in town for their 30th anniversary, we knew that Michael Mina was top of our list of places to celebrate. It's gorgeous sophisticated interiors and exquisite food would be the perfect place to showcase SF fine dining and usher them into the next 30. Our table was perfect, and everyone's meals were divine. The wait staff was extremely attentive, but left us enough breathing room to celebrate on our own. For a fine dining restaurant, they really managed to make it feel intimate. I had the tuna tartare and the Five seas (again, killer), but others at our table enjoyed the shabu shabu (gorgeous presentation and who doesn't love an interactive dish), the lobster pot pie (a knock out... the winner from a taste perspective but not so waist-friendly), the duck, and the lamb.

So the other night, a couple of friends and I sat down for dinner.\n\nThere were only three of us but since so many of the starters looked interesting, we decided to order four to share.  We had the crispy quail, the hamachi crudo, the provincial shellfish, and the crab pasta pyramids. All had great flavors, but the table favorites were the hamachi crudo and the shellfish. The hamachi tasted clean, fresh, and had truffles - what more could you ask for.  The shellfish was in a bouillabaisse broth and came with an uni toast. Eaten on its own, I normally find uni too rich, but on toast then dipped in the shellfish broth, it was fabulous. For my entr\u00e9e, I had the truffle stuffed chicken.  Not only do I love truffles, but when the server said the chicken was cooked sous-vide, I was sold. The chicken was delicious and tender. I gave my friend a taste of the chicken and he loved it. He said he normally doesn't like the breast meat because it's usually dry and tasteless, but he liked this dish a lot (and practically ate half my dish). This dish also came with foie gras rice, which was creamy and decadent, but a little too rich for me. As if we didn't have enough to eat...we ended up having the desert tasting. Seven mini deserts were served as part of the tasting. If you love chocolate, then you'd be in heaven since four of the seven had some sort of chocolate. My favorite though was a rolled wafer with jasmine cream. The texture was light and literally melted in your mouth.\n\nThe service was great all around, as I would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.  Our server was super friendly and knowledgeable about all the dishes. He also gave a great wine suggestion to pair with our starter dishes.\n \nOverall, my friends and I had a great experience dining at Mina. I know some people expected the new Mina to mirror the Westin location. In top notch food and service, definitely. In atmosphere and style, not as much.

C'mon....we are friends at a table that haven't seen each other in awhile do the staff really need to interfere with conversation to get their seal of approval? NO! Dessert was a joke, it could of been from the Olive  Garden....the chocolate , peanut dessert looked like a garbage dump on the moon (how bad could it taste, it was peanuts and chocolate) Strawberry cheesecake looked so amateurish I thought the pastry chef was home sick...so we experienced it, done , never again...we'll stick to Delfina and Piperade as favorites that we know when we go we'll have a blast without the pretense of self importance hovering nearby...Doesn't the staff know that if something is off, the guest will definitely let them know.", "author": "Honest in SF H."}
