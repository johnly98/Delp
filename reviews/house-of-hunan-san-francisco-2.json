We already had noticed they less than average reviews but decided to risk it anyway.\n\nWe walked in about 30min before closing tonight and immediately noticed the less than friendly service. Only one other table was dining and it was pretty small, cold feeling and smelled like dirty dish water. We decided to order the safest thing on the menu, beef and pork chow mein (spicy) and broccoli beef, two steam rice and a ginger ale (i figured i might be needing the latter just in case.)\n\nWe had asked for hot tea originally but they only had tea bags instead of the brewed pots that most authentic Chinese restaurants serve you so we passed on that. \n\nFood came out relatively fast but the meats just tasted odd so I mostly ate the noodles and the steam rice with broccoli. The sauce wasn't bad in the broccoli beef, however, i was weary of the beef. The chow mein was quite bland even though it was spicy and just didn't care for the thick doughy noodles. \n\nOverall, as a local who grew up in SF and eaten authentic Chinese regularly in the city, particularly in the richmond and sunset district, i find downtown SF to cater more to transplants and tourists who don't know what these dishes are supposed to taste like. I wasn't really shocked by the rudeness as its pretty typical of most Chinese or asian restaurants to not be the friendliest, although, there are a few that are, I care more about the food and the quality which this place seriously lacks. I would not recommend as i'm very concerned about the high potential of food poisoning here. Dishes are also priced on the higher end for the quality you're getting. Do yourself a favor, don't be lazy (we have to drive out from the east bay now in heavy traffic to eat the food we grew up \nup with cuz of you transplants who priced everyone out) and just drive, uber or bus it to the Richmond or Sunset district (or even China Town) instead and quite whining about how far it is when you don't have a 3-4 hour daily commute to work everyday like the rest of us who actually are from the city and would give anything to have these conveniences again!", "author": "Petra S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-24", "description": "When it comes to eating American Chinese food, there's a different standard you have to expect. You're not going to expect the complex, authentic flavors you find in China, but rather just simple, savory feels throughout dishes. \n\nHouse of Hunan delivers that, with all the options that you normally expect out of a Chinese place. For the chow mein I ordered, I felt that the noodles were a bit overcooked and soft. There wasn't enough oil that gives a more slippery and compact almost al dente finish that makes chow mein outstanding. The meat portions that went with my chow mein were also average---not bad, but didn't have the juicy, tender texture that good Chinese American places get.\n\nOverall, not a bad experience. The lady that runs the place is super nice and has a nice sense of humor for people that try to speak Chinese to her. The service can get slow sometimes since she's the only one running around serving the entire restaurant and the take-out customers, but the food is reliable.", "author": "Michael Y."}

I've had a couple of their dishes, and most recently their Tomato Scrambled Egg Veggie dish and it was DELICIOUS. The tomato sauce is soooo yummy and the portion was massive. In fact, that's been the case with all their dishes -- portion sizes allows you to eat the meal comfortably in 2 sittings (or be a fatass like me and indulge and finish it in one sitting). \n\nHealth: clean place inside, and the food definitely doesn't have MSG. I typically don't eat Chinese food because it's too greasy and leaves me feeling gross, but I've never experienced this here. Amazing!\n\nService: the majority of non-5 star reviews for them has had to do with timing and service. THEY HAVE ADDRESSED THESE ISSUES, so do not be deterred by the fact that they do not have an overall 5 star review right now.

The filet fish with tender greens are always full of fish. The second time I ordered, I had less greens but still really satisfied with the dish.  To me this taste like home made Chinese that's not overly salted.

Newbies in the city, moving day chaos... eventually, hunger took over...\n\nWe ordered our staple Chinese takeout food - Garlicky eggplant, Veggie chow foon, veggie potstickers and a side of rice. Now, I have to say, the veggie chow foon was OMG chopstick-licking good. Normally, I wouldn't eat it. But that Sunday, my poor husband ended up eating very little of his order! The garlicky eggplant lacked garlic. It did taste good though, no doubt. The potstickers didn't stand a chance either.\n\nThe second time, I wanted mushrooms. Now I didn't care how they were made, just a random mushroom craving. Turns out they were out/had very little left. So, I ended up getting my alternate staple - String beans sauteed in a garlicky spicy sauce. Yeah, this one didn't stand a chance either :D And what made it awesomer was that it contained mushrooms! Probably whatever they had left!\n\nYeah, the hostess/order taking lady/owner is not the most pleasant to converse with. But seriously, who cares, especially if you are getting food to go? It's not like it's a swanky place to make connections and what not... Get over it. Enjoy the food. And the cheapness of it. And it's multiple-meals lasting quantity.", "author": "Ranjani S."}

It irked me that she had the gall to point to the ordinance poster that she put up on her counter to tell me that I have to pay 10c for the bags now.  Now I wouldn't eat there if there was any other Chinese restaurant nearby because I don't like the owner and the food is nothing special.\n\nAs for her plastic bags, San Francisco can fine merchants who violate the ordinance--either by not charging the 10 cents or by using bags that don't meet the ordinance's specifications--$100 for a first violation, $200 for a second and $500 for each violation thereafter. To enforce the rules, the city will do some random checks and respond to complaints.\n\nHere's the San Francisco Bag Ordinance Non-Compliance Form if you care to anonymously report violators:\nhttps://docs.google.com/a/sfenvironment.org/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFpqOEhlVkdlaXlzZlFxSHktSG1pbEE6MQ#gid=0", "author": "P J."}

You see, I used to live in the delivery sphere of Big Lantern, and though there are lots of yummy vegan foodses in Oakland, I have yet to find the same level and variety of fried meatless morsels covered in sweet sauce in my new neck of the woods.  So, I was jonesin' for some sweet and sour meatless chicken.\n\nAnd then, what is this I find?  A Chinese restaurant near my office that has meatless chicken and lots of tofu dishes?  Can this be?  Sure, Yelp tried to tell me to not get my hopes up, but I couldn't help it.  I HAVEN'T HAD SWEET AND SOUR MEATLESS CHICKEN IN LIKE LITERALLY FOREVER OKAY?\n\nAnd yeah.  Alright, Yelp, you were right.  It was nothing special - in fact it was borderline not so good.  The rice was sticky in that this-is-not-supposed-to-be-sticky-rice kind of way, and the meatless chicken was that kind of caramel-y too sweet TVP, and was a little too, um, toothesome.  That being said, for veggies it does have a lot of choice which is hard not to appreciate when you work in this area of SOMA.  There are two meatless chicken dishes, as well as sweet and sour tofu, mango tofu, general's tofu...oh yeah, and some not as fried and bad for you options as well.\n\nOh and the fortune cookie is vegan.

I wouldn't say the food was great, but it was good and it didn't feel  heavy or greasy which some times can be an issue in Chinese restaurants. The place looks very clean, which is another unusual trait that made me very happy! There are big windows overlooking a small patch of grass... I wouldn't say it has great ambiance but it's nice and airy, certainly nicer than average. \nThe menu is fantastic! There is a lot of variety of dishes so we probably won't get bored any time soon. We tried the crab cheese puffs, which were ok.. the dim sum sampler and the garlic prawns. All ok.\nThe service was a bit strange - we ordered appetizers and entrees, then another gentleman arrived and ordered his meal. His soup arrived before our appetizers. Then his entree arrived before our appetizers. We had to wait quite a bit. Maybe he was VIP. I should have asked for an autograph. \nThe phone didn't stop ringing. A lot of orders for delivery and carryout pouring in. They must be well liked in the hood. \nMy fortune cookie came with a menacing tone. It said \"enjoy life while you can\".", "author": "Mrs. G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-03-11", "description": "My company orders from House of Hunan very regularly simply because it is close to our offices and offers free delivery.  The older gentleman who delivers the food is very sweet and good-natured and the nicest person there.  The woman who seems to run the place and most often answers the phone/takes the orders is rude, manner-less, unkind and incompetent.  \n\nSome of the dishes are quite good, some are disgusting.  My first experience was a bad one: I ordered the breaded prawns, which I now call Cornprawns (instead of corndogs) because they were coated in an extremely thick and bad tasting breading and were completely inedible (stuck so thoroughly to the prawn that I couldn't even pick it off).  However, after that I discovered their Spicy Chicken and Mongolian Beef, two dishes that are tasty and even offer a healthy brown rice alternative!\n\nThe good and bad of the food being said, the woman who works the main desk has such a bad attitude and is so rude that they don't have a dish on the menu delicious enough to make it worth tolerating her.  Today she got my dish wrong and, while it is somewhat of a hassle, it happens and it's not the end of the world.  I simply asked for no vegetables.  I don't like them.  Enough said.  I called to ask her to please have the correct dish sent over (even though I had walked over to pick our $90+ order originally) and she repeated my entire order to me, including my dish as I had ordered it with no vegetables, and claimed that I must be in error since she wrote the order down correctly.  I said I wasn't doubting that she wrote the order down correctly but a disconnect occurred somewhere between her writing it down and it getting to my desk because it was sitting in front of me and was indeed completely wrong, covered in vegetables.  She continued to yell at me that I was wrong but finally, after about 10 minutes of this bullcrap, agreed to send over the correct dish.  \n\nMy new, replacement dish arrives about 20 minutes later -- exactly the same, covered in onions!!  I called her again to let her know and perhaps get some kind of credit for the dish and call it a wash.  She said, \"Look, I am very busy.\"  Too busy to get my order right?  Too busy to be courteous?  Perhaps I should be too busy to pay next time!  She says, \"I didn't even charge you for it!\"   Well of course you didn't - why would I be charged for you to correct your error?!  Then she drops the humdinger, \"It's just onions!\"  I do believe I paid you $7.95 for a dish with NO VEGETABLES and not for you to decide what I should be eating and which vegetables I should like or dislike.  I was dumbfounded.  I just hung up.\n\nI'll tell you what, I am too busy to ever give them my patronage again but I am not too busy to write this review and let everyone know that House of Hunan needs to fire that crazy jerk of a female working their front desk.", "author": "Robyn S."}

Then she called out the order for one of the take outs that ordered after me.  Then another order for someone that ordered after me.  Then she served the seated couple their appetizers.  Then the third person that did the take out order was presented with their food.  Then she served the seated couple their entrees.  Where the hell was my food.  I was the first person that ordered, yet nothing.  I went and complained, the lady yelled something in Chinese, and she said we have a new cook.  WTF does that matter about whose food they prepared first.  She then yelled again into the kitchen (I suspect calling in my order) and then another 15 minutes later I got my food.  The common theme - all the people that were given their food before me were white or asian.  I am a dark skinned, so I was treated like the lowest man in society, and served last.  Amazing.
