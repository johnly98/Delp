She is treated so kindly by all the staff, they seem truly delighted to have us there. \n\nAnd the other guests find it so amusing to see this little girl act like a pro sushi eater. She goes in, sits down, watches the boats go by, points at the food she likes, and then devours it. She absolutely loves the edamame and salmon sashimi, and is starting to get adventurous and pick new things that look yummy to her. Last time she picked the bright orange flying fish roe and, to the surprise of everyone, she ate every bit. They also make her salmon roe (ikura) nigiri on request, which is one of her favorites.\n\nOne of the really nice advantages of this place is its price. My daughter can pick 4 different things (which she devours) and it's only about $10 for her. But sometimes she eats more... :)\n\nWe've now come here four times and it's become my daughter's favorite. Whenever we talk about going to a restaurant, she says she \"wanna go to sushi boats\". It's really hard to tell her no, that we're going to do pizza or burritos instead sometimes! She really wishes she could come here every day.", "author": "Jon E."}

Enjoyed being able to select different pieces for a fraction of the cost of a role. However, think about the cost of 2 pieces of mediocre sushi. Standard rolls have 8 pieces, generally. Nigiri is worth it. Totally. To each their own, of course! I can go to HH and get a really yummy roll I enjoy for half price. \n\n The women, unless you're friends or know them, are in their own mindset. Good to just get a few pieces and hang out for the experience.", "author": "Victoria V."}

It was early on a Sunday (around 11:30 a.m.) but there was a good crowd. \n\nFood: Super cute rotating sushi boat! The boats had a good mix of rolls, sashimi and apps (like edamame, stir fried veggies, tempura) and all at good prices. You could also order off the menu for additional rolls and hot food items. Husband and I shared an edamame off the boat, he had several different rolls and sashimi but liked the salmon sashimi best), and I enjoyed stir friend veggies and the veggie tempura roll (full roll menu item). The veggie tempura roll had tempura veggies inside and then seaweed salad on top -- different than most vegetarian sushi roll options and really delicious. \n\nLocation: We were walking so I can't speak too much on the parking options, but like most of SF, seems to be street parking in the area, but it's hit or miss how close you'll find something. Inside, there's probably about 20 seats at the rotating boats and 10-15 additional tables in the restaurant. \n\nService: Our waitress was quick to refill our water and tea and take my order for an additional roll. We didn't have too much need for additional service, but when we needed it, it was prompt and well done.", "author": "Alexis T."}

If there are a lot of empty seats, be prepared to choose from plates that have been revolving for some time. If this place is jam packed, it will be worth your while to put your name down on the list to be seated at the bar.\n\nSakana Bune is a sushi boat style where you get to pick and choose plates. Each plate is color coated and you can match it to the colors on the table to figure out how much each dish cost. This concept is great if you want to try new things, but you are afraid of committing yourself to a whole dish.\n\nYou really can't go wrong with the california rolls here. This is my favorite spot to get cheap yet delicious california rolls. From the creaminess of the imitation crab and sauce to the generous filling inside the rice just makes this an easy dish to always get. The house special roll , which consists of unagi and avocado on top of california roll, is also a must get when you are here.\n\nSurprisingly, the chicken teriyaki and beef teriyaki is really good here. The crispy skin of the chicken yet tender meat makes it a great dish to fill up on. This includes miso soup and a bowl of salad. \n\nWaitresses are all very nice and it is really easy to flag them down.", "author": "Timothy C."}

I will probably get two of these whenever I come here. If it's not on the belt, you can ask a waitress for this item too.

I find it best to come when this place is jack packed. \n\nThe servers here are always super friendly and great at remembering faces. Service is always quick and easy to obtain since here are several waitresses standing around the tables at all time. \n\nIf you have never been to sushi boat before, the prices are listed on the mat slightly above where you will be sitting at the sushi bar. Each sushi dish that goes around in plates will be color coded so you know exactlly how much you will be paying. The best rolls that I highly recommend would be the lion king roll (baked salmon with creamy sauce on top of California roll), house special roll (California roll with unagi and avocado on top), and if it seems like a busy day, sunset rolls (spicy California roll with raw salmon and avocado on top). \n\nI know it is weird but this place has the best chicken teriyaki you can order.

It's basically what you'd expect from a random rotating sushi joint on the corner of a street. Some items might be a hit, and some might not make the mark. The service was average and overall nothing was really terrible, but nothing was extraordinary either.\n\nPrice-wise, you definitely get what you pay for. The plates are all very affordable and nothing on the \"belt\" is over $4-5 if I recall correctly. You could easily be satisfied spending $20-25 a person here. With that being said, I'd avoid some of the items that look like they've been rotating on the water for a while. Be smart about what you pick, or better yet just order off the menu.\n\nOne thing that sort of irked me was when we came in with a group of 5 they sat us all the way in the back corner even though the restaurant was empty and we asked to be sat towards the middle. Their reasoning was that lunchtime was coming up soon and there would be an influx of customers. So....do we not look like customers?

I've been coming to this spot for a few months now, but held off on a review until I really knew what my true opinion was about the place. You all know that if you want top quality fish, you're going to pay top quality dollar. It's just a fact. That's exactly why you have to take this spot with a grain of salt and take it for what it is: a casual sushi boat with average quality sushi for a damn good price. Not only that, but I've never had a bad experience here before. I'm always treated well by the staff, and walk out satisfied. \n\nOn my recent visit, I went out with a party of 5 for a Mother's Day meal. It was pretty crowded, which is how it usually is around lunch time. If you have a larger party, be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes to be seated, unless you're ok with table seating (but that's no fun in a sushi boat). The fish selection was less limited than it usually is, which was great. They had salmon, yellowtail, eel, hamachi (all in Nigiri) which was awesome. Sometimes it's a bit hit or miss depedning on if the fish has been circling the sushi boat for a while, and it may not be as fresh as when it's first put out. All in all, you'll always have something yummy circling around, so your tummy will be satisfied.\n\nAs you can tell, there's definitely drawbacks here, but the most important thing to remember is that this place is meant as a hangout spot, and you aren't coming here for a michelin star quality food. Pro top: the Sake here is really cheap and very good! Highy recommended on any occasion. Enjoy :)", "author": "Alex B."}

Upon arrival, we waited to be seated. The sushi bar was packed but we were seated within a reasonable wait time. We could have chosen to sit at the tables but decided not to. Thus, this review is based on my experience at the sushi boat bar. If you choose to order from the menu, your experiences might be different from mine.\n\nAfter seated, we started to survey the different delectable items that we could choose from. However, it was when we started picking stuff from the conveyor belt to eat that i realized how deficient Sakana Bune was. The selection was sub-par at best and was severely limited by the inclusion of super weird sushi creations such as the \"honey walnut prawn sushi\". The unagi was, and my friend agreed, not the freshest and it was apparent when each of us took a plate to try. The sashimi was great but was sadly eclipsed by the inferior quality of the other items. The rest of the items that we took were the run of the mill typical sushi items.\n\nAt the end of the meal and after paying, the hostess informed us that she forgot to include in the bill my friend's order of softshell crab and my order of hot sake. The fact that the hostess went to each of us and counted each items that we had  ordered should have meant that our bill was accurate but it was sadly not.This is, of course, a minor mistake but I believe it is a strong indication of the attentiveness and the overall service that Sakana Bune has to offer. \n\nThough Sakana Bune is the only sushi boat on my strip of Geary Blvd, i have decided that I won't be coming here again.", "author": "Wing C."}

The sashimi were frozen when I took a bite. The maki rolls and speciality rolls were super bland. They kept bringing out the same kind of rolls and it was nothing new or exciting. Some of the maki rolls were out in the sushi boat for so long that you can see the seaweed turning brown and old. \n\nAside from that, I was drinking my water and found out there was a dead bug in there. I quickly brought this attention to the waitress and she asked rudely, \"so do you want me to give you a new one?\" I replied, \"no, but please let management know that this is unsanitary\" She goes and tell her manager and her manager starts to laugh. I thought it was hilarious too because I see why this restaurant is the way it is.

I've been coming here with my family since...high school and it hasn't changed one bit. Never got a stomachache eating here!\n\nThe pros: The ability to try a bunch of things! See something you like? Just grab it off the belt! The downside to rolls is that you're usually limited to just a few and then each roll comes with 4-8 pieces of the same thing. Here, you just pick up a plate that has 2 pieces on it and if you want more, just pick up another one. \n\nAlso, you can't complain about the prices. The cheapest plate starts at around $1.75 and the most expensive isn't more than $3.25 (I think, don't quote me on this). There's nigiri, rolls (think Cali rolls and that sort of stuff), salads, grilled octopus, takoyaki, edamame, etc. \n\nThe cons: While there's usually a good variety of things going around, it's always the same rolls. Recently they've put some new things out, but other than that it's still all the same things since high school. You can order a la carte, but some of the stuff they have on the belt isn't on the menu.\n\nThings that no one wants kind of just sits out there and goes around and around and around. \n\nBottom line: Cheap sushi that won't give you a stomachache.

That said, I'm going to mention that I am Japanese and somehow that gives me a little more credibility on how sushi is 'supposed' to taste. I go to Japan often and eat at popular sushi places over there.\n\nThis sushi is wack...as another reviewer mentioned, if you know what sushi is supposed to taste like, you'll know first bite that this sushi is definitely not what a sushi connoisseur would consider good... At the same time, to be fair, its not disgusting. Its edible, and you have to remember that the prices here are very, very competitive. Even so, I feel like no matter how cheap, restaurant food has to be good, because if I wanted cheap mediocre food, I can make it myself or buy easy to make meals from the grocery store.\n\nTo go into just a hint of detail, the rice is really bad, not how sushi rice is supposed to taste at all. You would definitely fail a credible sushi rice making test if this rice was your result. However I disagree with some reviews saying the actual fish is good, the actual fish is wack too, not of any quality at all, but again, edible. If you don't know what better sushi tastes like, you could probably enjoy this.\n\nI personally can guarantee you I'll never be back. Not because the place is terrible, which it is not. I think it has its appeal to the restaurant goer that can appreciate value priced sushi that is at least edible and even enjoyable in a pinch.\n\nService, from what I've experienced, is fine.

I've only eaten at the sushi bar and I'm willing to wait because I heard it's not the same experience sitting at one of the tables. The bar does get crowded and sometimes there is a wait, but I never had to wait more than 20 minutes for a spot.\n\nThe quality of the sushi is there, you just have to look out for the freshest dishes the chefs place on the boats. It's a bit of a waiting game, but the payoff is there. Of course if dishes are out for a while, the fish is not as great and the rice becomes hard - so don't get it. If you like what the chefs are placing on the boats, you can ask right before and they will hand it to you. The only downside is that the rotation of the rolls is limited and they won't place out a new dish until the previous one is done.

My friends and I agree that it's the best roll on the menu!!!\n\nThe staff are friendly, immensely helpful, and your water glass or tea cup will never go empty!

Its not super expensive but that quality of the fish isn't top notch. I prefer this place because I can try pieces of different rolls instead of being stuck with just one. \n\nI'm not really sure how fresh the sushi is because it is sitting on the boat and you don't know how long it's been out. But I usually order the pieces I want and they'll usually make it. Rachael is my favorite waitress. She's super nice and always fills my water/tea without me having to ask. There are a few rolls you can't order on the little plates, but she always makes an exception for me. She's the homie (: Oh and this place has made me love oysters. LOL I've never liked any oyster until I tried it here. I guess they serve blue point oysters and they're perfect.

The sushi isn't out of this world, but it's not at all bad. \n\nMy friend and I have been here too many times to count now and we haven't had even one bad time. Every experience was different though depending on where we were sat. When you arrive, put your name down on the wait list and check whether you prefer the bar, table, or no preference. We always go for the bar because that's where the sushi boats are! You can also choose tables and order off of the menu (if you don't like fun and cute boats bringing you food). The better experiences are when we get sat near the top of the U because we are able to grab the freshest plates! You can tell which plates have been sitting a while if they aren't as shiny or wet looking (lol duh). But the chefs do notice dry or unpopular plates and replace them with something new (yes I have witnessed it myself!) also if you don't see what you want, you can obvs still order it! Sushi boat plates range from $1.25-$4.25? No more than $5 for plates on boats. Appetizers and other menu items I'm unsure. \n\nMinimum $20 charge for cards.\n\nIt's on Geary so you know parking's a b*tch. I usually hop out of car and put our names down while my friend parks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-09-08", "description": "So I've been to Isobune and Warakabune many times, which probably means I'm somewhat of an expert on SF's sushi boats. (Have not been to the eponymous Sushi Boat near Union Square, as I try to stay well away from that consumer-oriented Abercrombie hell - all signs point to \"expensive\"!)\n\nSo, my expert opinion on the matter: THIS PLACE IS %&^#@ AWESOME. \n\nThe cheapest of the boats I've been to in the city, this place is located in the Russia-Pacific region of ethnic food joints. Usually, this stretch of the Richmond district is the place where I go to stock up on pelmeni and honey pepper vodka, but that's just because I can't find those items anywhere else, and the thawing pelmeni don't leave me with a lot of time for exploration. But this time, I decided to let those pelmeni thaw. And boy was I glad I did.\n\nHere's the deal with your average sushi boat: it's either a kids thing, or it's an all-you-can-eat thing. This isn't a date thing or a \"impress someone with fancy dinner\" thing or even a \"family visiting on vacation\" thing. \n\nSo first and foremost, it must be cheap! Because kids aren't gonna finish everything, especially not the crab/mayo-filled rolls. So if you don't want to feel like you're wasting money, that boat plate shouldn't be $5-6. Alas, that's sort of the ceiling plate price for the other boats. This place, on the other hand? $3 tops. That's right - all your delicious food is gonna be $1-3 a plate. I stuffed myself silly for $20 - in fact, I really had to try extra hard to fit $20 worth of food in me, as that's the card minimum. However, the deep-fried oysters, potato pancakes, and the promise of deep fried crab claws gave me a second gastro-wind (heh), and all was consumed. Sushi itself was alright, nothing fancy of course, but pleasantly \"aight\", which is to be expected for such a low price.\n\nAtmosphere? It's a %$(&#* sushi boat. The waitresses were nice. The Russian ladies chatting next to me were boring. Not an overwhelming amount of kids at 5:30 pm on a Saturday. \n\nBut yeah - all stars a go for the cheapest sushi boat experience in SF, which still retains enough of its quality and variety to satisfy all but the most seasoned sushi snobs.\n\nPS: This place got grilled with two stars for a \"wet pants no discount\" complaint? Get real, scumwads. How is a discount going to dry your friend's pants any quicker? One of the more idiotic traits that defines \"Americanism\" is this amazing ability to turn any grievance into an excuse to leech money. Someone wrongs you? Surely their cash will make it all better! Oh, the cops shot your child in cold blood because his skin happens to be of an alarming hue...hmmm, maybe if you win the lawsuit, the big pile of money you and your lawyers divvy up will totally wipe away the memory of a terrible injustice - and the institutional willingness to cover up, lie, protect the ranks, avoid all responsibility...

I thought the size of cuts were pretty good for the price paid. They refill the boats as they go along.

Each plate ranges from $1.50-$2.95, which is the cheapest sushi boat I've been to. Recently went to the one inside Japan Town and nothing was lower than $3.00.\n\nDon't expect world class sushi here. Salmon sashimi was very fishy and chewy. Not good. Not sure how long each plate was out there but the tuna was hard and dry. Best bet is to wait until you see the chefs put down fresh plates on the boat to avoid eating the stale ones. \n\nI'd go back if I wanted to eat cheap and quickly, other than that, way better sushi boats in the city.", "author": "Mark G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-02", "description": "This type of restaurant is difficult to review. Sakana Bune is a relatively small neighborhood restaurant that's been open for years. It's distinguishing feature is the sushi moat that dominates the space which is otherwise filled with a few tables and Japanese decorations made in China.\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know what a sushi moat is, a quick internet image search will rectify that and is easier than me writing a 1000 word description. Anyway, I came here with a colleague for lunch on 2/6/15. We sat at the moat since no one was sitting at the tables, even though we were more likely to order off the menu than pick up the little floating plates.\n\nWe ordered a Sashimi Combo with white rice, miso soup, mixed tempura appetizer, and yes, we pulled a couple plates off the moat. The Sashimi Combo had about 25 pieces (I can't remember the exact number) and came with the standard variety, i.e. salmon, tuna, hamachi, etc. Nothing spectacular. \n\nThe miso soup was standard, as was the mixed tempura. Everything tasted OK with little innovation or creativity, except perhaps for one or two of the creations I saw on the sushi moat, though that was pretty much just making regular rolls spicy. And hence the difficulty of reviewing a restaurant like this. \n\nEverything here was edible. The fish was relatively fresh, the miso soup was decent, the tempura was decent, and the sushi was decent. The only real complaint was that they gave me an expired can of diet coke...twice. For those of you that don't believe it, yes, soda's do expire. It tastes like copper.\n\nThis is a neighborhood restaurant that serves the purpose of giving you decent food at reasonable prices when you're hungry. The check totaled about $65 before tip, but that incudes the 2 large sakes my colleague downed. The servers were nice and responsive, if unable to read expiration dates. And they literally kept the moat going for just the 2 of us, even though the restaurant had cleared out.\n\nWhat else can I say? This place was decent.", "author": "N. C. L."}

As usual, the waitresses were attentive and great! \n\nWe were about done with our meal. I just wanted on last tuna nigiri, but the one that has been on the boat has been there for about 20 mins. It didn't look fresh. So I asked the Chinese woman if I can get a freshly made tuna nigiri. She nodded her head. When she was done, she gave it to me and it was a salmon nigiri. I told her nicely \"I asked for a tuna, not salmon.\" Then she gave me this pissed off look and turn around the slammed the salmon down on her work table.\n\nShe turned around and started to make something else. Since then, she has avoided eye contact with me and having her back towards me. I was watching her closely to see what she does. Then she screamed to the guy to make my tuna nigiri. I sat there waiting for my tuna nigiri for at least 5 mins. All the \"chefs\" were making other stuff. Then out of no where, the Chinese woman said loudly in Chinese to the other Chinese guy chef, \"EVEN THOUGHT SHE IS LOOKING AT ME, I'M STILL NOT MAKING HER SUSHI!!\" Then 3 mins later, the guy responded in Chinese \"Who wants the tuna?\" The middle aged Chinese woman said \"The one behind me.\" \n\nYes, you read correctly, she just smacked talked in Chinese to a paying customer! How did I know about what she said? BECAUSE I CAN UNDERSTAND CHINESE!! You wouldn't believe how mad I was. I come to this place frequently and usually have a great time. \n\nWhen we got our check, I walked over to the cashier table and told the manager on duty about what happened. She apologized and told me that she will make sure that she will tell the boss. I sincerely hope that she will. \n\nUnfortunately, I will have to think twice about coming back to this restaurant.

In general, chinese restaurants tend to have a different style of blunt and non-sacchraine service.\n+Whether Chinese or Japanese, it's going to be relatively pricey for small portions (as in compare to other types of food).\n\nHOWEVER, this is the first Chinese-run restaurant where I walked out thinking \"DAMN that was great service for an inexpensive delicious meal\". \n\n+Food Price: Each plate ranged from $1.5-2.95 ish. They also had larger size rolls ($5-$10) and other slightly more expensive a la carte sushi that were not available on the boats ( less than $2 more), such as sea urchin and salmon roe. \n\n+Food Quality: We came on a busy Friday night, so it wasn't the same ol plates rotating around. I think as a general rule, if you are going to a sushi boat place, go at a busy time, so you constantly have fresh options. Also, I would also recommend ordering off the rest of the a la carte menu, they make it right then so it's for sure fresh.\n\n+Service: Very attentive. Since we ordered from the menu, they came back to check if we wanted to order more and again to ask if we received everything that we ordered.

We were seated at the bar, and that's usually the most desirable place for a sushi boat place, after about 25 minutes we got approached by the manager Rachel, who was super RUDE and basically asked us to pay and leave because we were chatting with a lovely lady next to us and not ordering more food. In my opinion, whenever you work in the industry that is customer oriented, you can at least say that there are other people waiting to get seated and ask nicely if we are ready to pay or order more.

I've tried several others, but have been less impressed-- so I stick to what I know = SALMON.\n\nBEWARE:\n1. Their Crab Claw has ZERO crab in it. I took a bite and looked  into a huge white fish ball. The only crab in it was the tiny claw(with zero meat) which they stuck into a fish ball and fried. It didn't taste bad, but If I'm paying for crab and expecting crab, I better see SOME crab meat.\n\n2. Personally I wouldn't order TO-GO. As I was dining, I watched a server take multiple plates from the sushi boats and begin packaging a plastic container with the already made sushi. I don't know if this was a one time thing or how it's usually done, but if you ask me TO-GO orders should be made fresh and packaged directly into the box from the sushi preparers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-06-20", "description": "I like this place and so do my parents as we go there fairly often when we eat dinner together. For a sushi place it's really affordable and because it's \"boat sushi\" where you get to pick what you want when you want, you can eat as much or as little as you wish for for a really affordable price. I mean, when your regular nigiri tops out at around $2 you can't really complain. \n\nFor a boat sushi place Sakana Bune's selection can seem a little limited at times, but what they do have is delicious. Their salmon (both nigiri and sashimi) and oyster ceviche are really fresh; their fried oysters (which you can get from the boat or order a full meal of) are flavorful, crispy, and juicy; and they have a fried soft-shelled crab that's quite good too. I tend to experience the small selection days on Wednesdays. I don't know what that means, but one can try going on other days. If you're going for dinner you want to try to get there before 7 pm 'cause after that time you may have to wait awhile but if you like affordable sushi that's good and fresh Sakana Bune might just be worth the wait.", "author": "Cass L."}

Not sure why I didn't just eat someplace pleasant.\n\nFirst impressions - cleaner than I recalled. I remember going here years ago and walking out because there was a dead cockroach floating among the boats. (... At least it wasn't a live one?)  They'd just opened for lunch, and even though it was early, there were several patrons. Seemed like a good sign.\n\nThe service was very quick, the hostess/server was extremely helpful and friendly.  I wanted something custom made, and it was clear the chef was not happy about it, but she made it happen.  The prices were very cheap -- I got 4 rolls for about $20, and the portions were generous.\n\nUnfortunately the food was appalling.  Sake dishes were not edible (after a bite, I worried: is this going to make me ill?)   I had a couple of vegetarian rolls which are normally a very safe bet, but they were incredibly dry and not fresh.  The nori was really weird... brittle, smelly.

There are fruit flies flying around the boat and have seen some land on the sushi.\n\nNeedless to say, I was disgusted.\nThe only good thing about this place is that it is cheap.

If they are not putting anything, then it mean that the plate is old and it's just going around. Some if the plate is so dried up that you wonder why they just let it seat there. They need to take out the old plates and fill it with new one, so just get the fresh one that they put out. My favorite is the bake mussels even those it's covered with a spicy mayo sauce.

This is a great place for those who don't like the overly fishy flavors of eel, squid, or oysters and want a large variety of sweet, savory, or spicy flavors. There were many different variations of the California roll, which was perfect for my less adventurous roommate who went with me.\n\nBest dishes were -\n\n-Shiromaguro nigiri  (White tuna over rice with lemon zest. A must try!)\n-Spica tuna roll with spicy mayonnaise\n-California roll with crab topping and a small dollop of mayo\n-Seared tuna with green onion\n-Inari (tofu skin stuffed with rice)\n-Tempura roll\n-Cooked shrimp roll\n\nI also highly recommend the plum wine (it was a nice golden color and very sweet) and the mochi ice cream for dessert - green tea, mango, and red bean!\n\nWe came on a Saturday night and were seated right away, which I was very happy about. It was also nice to see that, for how late it was, there was still a good selection. The server was very nice and attentive, but not overly so. And yes, it's true what they say, the pricing is what makes the place - even though I got 7 plates, a $4.00 glass of wine, and dessert, I only ended up spending $23.00 which is a STEAL for sushi boat.\n\nMy only real complaints would be that a) The menu didn't accurately reflect what everything was, so you had to either know or ask the server and b) it is IMPOSSIBLE to find parking by this place. I recommend taking transit unless you live close.\n\nOverall, nothing profound about this place, but I will definitely be returning if I feel like I want to fill myself up on sushi boat without having to take out a loan.

The sushi rolls or nigiri pieces are on different plates that are on floating boats, which goes around the table. The plates each have their own category of prices that can range from 1.50 to 4.50. The service doesn't really do anything except get drinks and desserts for you since it's mostly a self serve kind of place. Grab the plate from the boat, eat the sushi, and leave the plate on the table. Don't put it back! That will be such a new person kind of fail to do. It's really funny when it happens but it does happen once in a while with new people. After you're finished, the waitress totals up what you've eaten by the stack of plates on your table.\n\nThe tricky part of sushi boating is what to pick. There are some things that are not worth it such as scrambled egg nigiri or the kappa roll, which isn't worth getting. Then there's the question of how long has this been sitting here and going around. There are some unpopular dishes that never gets picked and may have been sitting there for an hour or so.  I find the best places to sit for these thing are at the end of the table where the sushi chef will place new sushi plates onto the boats. That means you'll get first picks and they'll be fresh for sure. The most awful place to be stuck sitting at is the middle of the table which is the bottom of the U part. This area gets last picks after everyone.\n\nThe sushi quality is is decent and choices are pretty large. Don't except mouth watering good sushi here. It's more of the cheap sushi that tastes okay. There's mostly traditional sushi that's on the boats so there will be tuna nigiri, salmon nigiri, eel nigiri, etc. There's a separate menu they have for dinner meals such as teriyaki beef and another menu for special sushi rolls like dragon roll. \n\nOverall, it's a cheap sushi place that has a nice boat thing going on that makes it more fun.", "author": "Steven B."}

I think this place is going to be my new go-to place for sushi boat.  The portions are smaller than Isobune's which is good because you can try more variety and if you happen to choose a bad plate you're not stuck having to eat a large portion of it.  But even better is that it is much CHEAPER!  Not only do the plates range from $1.50 to $2.95, but you can find plenty of good decent plates in the lower end of that range.  At Isobune it's hard to find anything good under $4.  The bad thing was there wasn't any sashimi only plates on the boats.  I was getting tired of eating all the rice from the rolls and stuff.  I guess you can probably order it but it's not even on the display menu - I don't like having to ask \"how much\" before ordering.  Also I had quite a long wait (though it was a Friday night).

Sakana Bune is a kaiten sushi restaurant, except instead of a rotating conveyor boat your sushi gets a ride on a floating boat. \n\nFood: \nThey have a wide variety of nigiri sushi, maki sushi, sashimi, and deep fried goodies available. If you love traditional choices I'd recommend the amai ebi (raw sweet shrimp), ikura (salmon roe),  and ika (raw squid), which were my favorites! I tried their saba nigiri (raw mackerel marinated in a combo of vinegar and sugar), and it wasn't very tasty... it turned out be too dry and overly marinated, I've definitely had better tasting saba nigiri before. I also had their tuna nigiri and salmon nigiri, which were OK, but not that great, the tuna was a bit dry and the salmon tasted fishier than it usually does. Their baked mussel were also really yummy, I had two servings of those! I was wanting to top it all of with a koroke (deep fried mashed potato), but I've been eying the only one on the sushi boat since I got there (30-45mins ago) so I ordered a fresh one! It turns out that they're delicious too. My only complaint is that they didn't use tonkatsu sauce, I honestly don't know what was used... it tasted like sweetened soy sauce -_-. \n\nService: \nThe staff were friendly, but not very attentive to taking extra orders from the menu, especially when sitting at the bar. A lot of the items I ordered weren't available on the boats so I had to call on waitresses multiple times. It's strange because they do come to check for refills, but they don't ask you if you'd like to order anything off the menu, so I had to let them know quickly before they run off. \n\nPrice: \nThis place is extremely affordable! Honestly, I'd come here again to eat amai ebi nigiri and ikura nigiri for $2.85 any time! I've never had those two choices at that price, so it's definitely a steal! Between my friend and I we ate 21 plates of sushi all together, and I paid $50 total (not including tip). Out of those 21 plates, I had 3 of the most expensive plates, and 3 of the medium priced ones. Everything else were $1.85 plates. \n\nOverall, the quality of the food isn't high grade sushi, but what can you expect from the prices that they're offering them for?

We got to Sakana Bune around 9pm, and we didn't have to wait at all.\n\nWhen my cousin first said we were going to have sushi boat, I was a little skeptical. My usual sushi boat experiences aren't that great, but I was pleasantly surprised with Sakana Bune.\n\nI am giving four stars for this place for what it offers. People might rate places like this based on the quality of food, but you really have to look at everything as a whole. For the setting, pricing, and freshness of the sushi, this place is pretty good.\n\nIf i remember correctly, the sushi ranges from $1-$3. (around) I didn't realize it was so cheap till halfway through our meal. This is cheap considering other sushi boat places can range up to $5 a roll.\n\nThe sushi here is also fresh - the super white tuna and salmon were both really good - very fresh and \"melt-in-your-mouth\" consistency. As far as other rolls, I liked their unagi, spicy tuna (w/orange sauce on top), and fried california roll. Lastly, their seared tuna sashimi was yummm. \n\nThe items I weren't too fond of was the spicy tuna & tuna nigiri, and also the fried crab items. The fried crab leg probably would have tasted it if it was fresh. By the time we ate it, it was cold and soggy, eek.\n\nOverall, good sushi boat experience.

We waited about 10-15 mins to sit at the sushi bar. Once we sat done, we looked as the boats went around and around and around. All plates are either $1.50 through $2.95. Alot cheaper than other sushi boat restaurants I've been to. The spicy tuna is def. super spicy - the guys liked this one the best. I liked the Ikura nigiri - my favorite! \n\nService was good tho - waters were always being filled! Some of the plates on the sushi boat contained slices of sashimi, some were cut properly, while some were clearly leftover pieces that the chefs didn't know what to do with.

Sometimes greedily snatching up a plate of a certain pattern that you may wish you had not grabbed. I recommend the hot baked ramekin! It is filled with a warm mayo and sesame flavored hodge podge of tuna, veggies, tamago, shrimp, and more mystery bits.... It's like a really yummy sesame oil tuna melt! I recommend avoiding the rolls filled with imitation crab salad as they all taste the same blah...which is the majority of the choices but...Have patience, practice restraint and some good, fresh choices will come around! \nI loved the crowded cooky environment here...lots of young local families simply celebrating life's simple pleasures like pieces of mediocre sushi swimming round and round and round and round....

I was looking for a sushi bar with boats for the entertainment value. I wanted to try Warakubune Sushi but it was closed.\n\nWe arrived around 6:00pm and there was about a 10 minute wait. Since the restaurant is on Geary Street, parking can be hit or miss. \n\nLike other sushi bars, seating is a challenge since people sitting at the bar don't come and go in the same numbers as people arrive. We were a party of 4 and though 3 seats were open, the staff did not let the party of 2, who came after us sit. (This is the correct way, to the chagrin of the party of 2).\n\nOverall the experience is good for those who might be intimidated to sit and order at a traditional sushi bar. Though the strange thing is that the most intimidating sushi (nigri) was the predominate type on the boats. While the less intimidating (combo rolls) were scarce and had to be special ordered. \"Regular' Japanese food is also available to order.\n\nSushi Freshness: 6 (1-Won't eat; 5 - what you would find at Safeway; 10 - to die for). The sushi was fresh - not great not bad. Somewhat close to what you would get at Safeway.  \n\nSushi Creativity: 6 (1- Typical nigri rolls; 5 - typical nigri rolls plus some unique ones; 10 - Many different rolls). On the boats its mostly nigri-type rolls. Though looking at the menu, it looks like they offer some unique ones.\n\nService: 9 - Sat at the Sushi bar, wait staff attentive and seating us before the party of 2.\n\nCleanliness: 9 - Overall the restaurant seemed clean. I didn't use the restroom to judge that.\n\nOverall: 7.5\n\nSakana Bune spot to try if you want to have a sushi boat experience. If you consider yourself a sushi snob, I wouldn't recommend it with so many good sushi restaurants in SF.", "author": "Mark K."}

The food itself was actually decent. The sashimi was good and the rolls were ok. Their most expensive dish is 2.95 so you really can't expect that much.

I guess it's ok, the food matches the price. And I can't say much for the price, since that's all I can afford for now. And rest of my $ must go for my \"other interest\".\n\nMy fav here are seared tuna. White tuna specially. They also offer regular and super white tuna all seared and non seared. If you don't see them, asked them to make some for you. If you don't know what they look like, just asked. After all, the server is there for you. Oyster is good and fresh as long you asked them. You can fish out from the bar, just keep an eye for the fresh one. They used to have kazunoko, but then they stopped. I also ordered uni and it came with special plate maybe about $5? (forgot). I have to say, one is fresh and one it doesn't. I have to throw that 1 out, it was awful. Their cooked sea bass is very tasty. If you ordered it with half rice bowl (give half for your bf/friend/share other ppl - don't waste it) it's ok. Otherwise, it might be too much flavor just to eat it like that. And don't miss out on that daikon, that's the good stuff. Baked Oyster, spider roll (if you lucky), tobiko, and ikura are so so.  \nService is fast and good. On busy day weekend night, there's always await in sushi bar. You can't make reservation for the bar, but you can on regular table.   \n\nCleanliness is a bit sketchy. You can tell from the melanin tea glasses, they are all feels like they were soaked in bleach for too long (or too many times). You can even smell the bleach sometimes. Everything is from melanin. From the sushi plate, the sauce whisking place, to their ginger and wasabi plate. I guess, this is the price for having affordable sushi. \n\nThey used to have their soda from fountain and first refill is free and now they just serving from can. And to my surprise it's $2. Wow...

We're watching people who were seated after us finish their meals and leave.  Inquiring about our second order, looks like it  was lost again - but within 10 minutes, they give us miso soup and the chicken.  OK, we didn't order the soup, but thought maybe they were apologizing for the poor service?  They never did say sorry.\n \nWhen it comes time to pay, our bill is outrageous.  Turns out they charged us for the expensive sushi boat dishes, instead of the cheaper ones that we actually got.  As you may know, they calculate the sushi boat service by the design of the plate that the sushi was served on.  The lower priced sushi and the expensive sushi plates are very similar, but different enough.   And then we noticed, they charged us for a full chicken teriyaki dinner.  Are you kidding me?  Well, if they thought we ordered the full dinner, where was the rice?  Where was the salad?  How about more chicken than the little bit we got?\n \nOf course, we complained.  They corrected the sushi plates without question, but then said that since we had to wait, they'll only charge us for the appetizer size of the chicken.  WHAT?!?  That's what we had ordered in the first place!  And they didn't even give us a full dinner - even though they thought that's what we ordered.\n\nThis was the only time that we have left a restaurant without leaving a tip.

The white fish, as a co-worker noted was creamy..which I guess is a good thing cause I enjoyed it and white fish is usually my least favorite.  The avocados used were a bit mushy, perhaps a little over ripped or been sitting out too long.  \n\nFrom what I can tell, the chicken terriyaki was below par, a mix of white and dark meat and some with skin still atop.  Sucks because she waited for thirty minutes and she couldn't even say it was worth the wait.  \n\nService was non-attentive.  We had to keep asking about the chicken terriyaki entree, and never once did they apologize for the delay.

For me, coming here is purely an exercise in gluttony.\n\nThat's fine though, because there are certainly worse things you can stuff yourself with. Their sushi boat selection actually has a fair amount of variety; enough to eat eleven or twelve plates' worth without consuming the same thing twice. And, unlike the claims of a previous reviewer, it's not just derivatives of california rolls either; there's a fair amount of nigiri and sashimi.\n\nYou could call it the McDonald's of sushi restaurants. I give Sakana Bune three stars, because you wouldn't give McDonald's more than three stars, would you?", "author": "Horace K."}

The sushi was acceptable given the price, but it wasn't anything super special. The prices were middle of the road as well, perhaps cheaper than I might expect for the average Japanese place. Atmosphere was ok, not as polished decor as Little Tokyo, but better than Kitaro. I'd go here again if I was looking for casual Japanese but didn't want to spend too much. This place is taken up mostly by a sushi bar, not a lot of tables. This doesn't really matter though since I've never really seen any sort of wait for the tables", "author": "Tyler C."}

The raw fish was just a few hours away from being totally stale and off; the rice was seasoned poorly; and the portions were sad.\n\nOkay, so it wasn't terrible, but it was bad enough that I regretted making the effort to come here and I even lost a little respect for the restaurant that referred me here.

Cuz we loved sushi, it was affordable, and sushi boats are fun when you have so much to chose from. However, it's not that fresh and delicious compared to other sushi places. What do you expect though right? I mean the prices aren't that pricey to begin with. I would always get the mussels....damn the plates do pile up at the end, but on average it's usually $20-$25 a person depending on how much you're planning to eat. My mom always orders take out from here. One time the waitress messed up on her bill and charged her extra $10 on tip or something....not cool! I think she thought my mom wouldn't notice either, but my mom went back in and told her wsup and she was like \"oh sorry I'll take care of it\", but my mom had already called bofa and took care of it.....watch out :P anyways I wish someone would take new ownership of this place and revamp their menu & look so that it's more appealing to customers.....until that happens you won't be seeing me there.", "author": "Diane L."}

The service, if you call it that, is the WORST~!  We arrived to find it fairly busy and stood there for a solid ten minutes with no one approaching us.  I saw several of the staff leaning against the wall, looking bored and ignoring us.  It wasn't until I had to aggressively approach a staff person as ask about a table.  I was then informed that I would have to sign in for a table - NOTE there is no sign to let you know this!  When I brought this to their attention, I was told that the staff was very busy which was the reason no one told us this.  I replied that they were not and that they were ignoring us.  No reply from the staff person.  Once we had signed in, we waited another 5 minutes before being seated.  I will say that the food is pretty good, but not of the level to endure being ignored.  This place isn't worth the effort and your money - they obviously don't really care about their customers or service.", "author": "Rodger R."}

We have a vegetarian, and a  hater of sashimi in our group, but we all always find enough to eat and make us happy. Off hours (like 3PM when we ate there today) may mean you want to avoid some items (the shrimp tasted a bit old) but that's the nature of the \"boat\" sushi places.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-08-08", "description": "The floating sushi boat concept attracts many customers. However, that is also the downside to the quality of food. The sashimis turn dull and dry up as they are circling in a boat. I think the restaurant probably realizes this a problem so they don't have as many sashimis on the boat as before. Most of the sushis are made with processed food like imitation crab meat and frozen seaweed salad. I looked at the chef while he was making my tuna sushi. First, he sneezed on my sushi. Then he realized that I was watching him. The second time he sneezed, he covered his mouth with his hand, and he continued to make my sushi. Another chef was scratching his head while he was making sushi rolls. I was disgusted. But I was too scared to tell the waitress so I paid and left. My sister and my cousins have been there to eat as well. They had signs of food poisoning such as diarrhea, vomiting, and nausea after eating the unsanitary food.", "author": "Nicole T."}

Getting a seat at the moat can take a while if you're with a group.  But the smaller the group, the more likely you'll be given a spot.  I went by myself tonight and they put me right into the only single open seat, even though others were waiting for more seats together.  I've gone on my own several times, and the staff have an annoying habit of asking \"Only one?\", like there's something wrong with that.\n\nThe boats bring a variety of food in front of me.  Going here when its busy is the best way to see turnover in the items available.  But after several trips here over the last few months, I'm learning that there are a pretty limited number of items in the repertoire.  Not that it's bad, just somewhat predictable.  Over a 20 minute sitting you'll see pretty much everything they're going to put on the boats.\n\nI prefer Nigiri sushi or sashimi dishes, especially lighter fish like albacore.  But these are rare on the boats.  Translucent salmon and bright-pink unnatural looking tuna are somewhat more common.  Most of the plates are rolls with lots of rice and Krab/mayonnaise mix.  These are probably designed to fill you up and get you to leave.  They're tasty.  But you'll only get to try a few items if you eat too many of these.\n\nI'll continue to go occasionally, but I wish they had an even greater variety on the boats.", "author": "Jon L."}

I don't know if they do that in sushi-tei here.\nService: Twice I've been here and it's still the same kind of service.\nAmbiance: I always like to seat on the stool while looking at the sushi boats going around. \nNote: A similar alternative sushi boat restaurant would be Fune-Ya on Clement, they are currently celebrating their anniversary, so everything on the sushi boat is only $1.95/plate.

I've been to this place several times because the sushi is okay and reasonably priced, but I can NO longer go to this place because I can not stand the ATTITUDE.  The waitresses here are very pushy, unpleasant, and always seem to be rolling their eyes at you. If anyone needs a course in how to be rude or how to have no customer service/people skills, you simply need to eat at this place and observe the waitresses. I finally decided to confront one of the waitresses (Bree) today as to why she was being so rude to my mother and I from the moment I entered to the time I left. She literally kept yelling at me as if everything was my fault, and for me to get out of the way because she has customers. I told her I was a customer too, and do not deserve to be treated this way.  I asked to speak to the manager who was also trying to push me aside and avoid the situation.  I am thankful that another customer sitting next to me approached the manager and said that I was right, and that the staff here needs to calm down and treat us all better.  Please do not go to this place! You can find much better sushi and service elsewhere.", "author": "G T."}

Tonight, we sat through dinner without much help from the servers. We were practically doing jumpin-jacks to get a server's attention and still we were unnoticed. We finally had to interrupt the sushi chef to get served. Keep in mind that this was a wednesday night and the restaurant was not busy. We also had to remind our server that what we ordered did not come when she was calculating our tab. What sucky service. By the way, no tea was served after our first cup. We had to go buy ourselves drinks after we left the restaurant. WTF?!", "author": "Sandy N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-08-13", "description": "So, the only reason I finally made an account on Yelp was to review this restaurant. \n\nBasically, this restaurant has a few problems, \n\n1) Poor Service\n2) Apparently they don't except pennies, so they round us to the nearest nickel\n3) You're also required to give them a 15% tip\n\nHere's the full story..\n\n\nThe prices here are relatively cheap compared to most sushi places, but the service is absolutely horrific. \n\nWe were waiting inside of the restaurant for the final member of our party of five. My friend had called me telling me she was five blocks away from the restaurant, literally two minutes. The waitress asked us where our final guest was and I told her the guest was only two minutes away and I  asked if we could be seated. The waitress decided to seat the party of three that just walked into door, and literally as they sat down my friend arrived. This caused another good twenty minutes of waiting for five chairs to clear up at the bar. \n\nWe weren't too stressed about wait for seating once we started eating, but the time the bill came around it was a whole different story. We asked the waitress politely to bill us separately (yes, this probably was a pain in the butt, but it's not that hard to do with a calculator). First she told us we couldn't, we made no argument about this, but she changed her mind and billed us all individually. We noticed that everyone's total had a few extra cents added to it, and mine had an extra $2 added to it. Along with that the complete total everyone's meal was calculated wrong. After much confusion and computing on cellphone calculators I told the waitress that the calculation seem to be incorrect. She ended up looking at the original receipt she gave me and my calculations and telling me that they were the same. I simply pointed out that they were not the same and she continued to look at the paper in confusion. I'm guessing the manager of the store saw her employee talking to us and came over and looked over the calculations. She then just stated that the restaurant does not deal with pennies therefore they round to the nearest nickel. But still the calculations were wrong and the manager just grabbed the papers and told us she'd calculate again. They gave us the new receipt with correct calculations(while rounding up to the nearest nickel). Not once apologizing or any sincere customer service. Honestly, it didn't seem like they wanted to be the ones who wronged. \n\nWe ended up giving a poor percentage of tip and leaving, which brings me back to a previous time that I dined at the restaurant with a friend and was poorly customer serviced. We ended up only tipping 10% and the employee told us a 10% was unacceptable and we are required to tip 15%. Really now?\n\nAll in all I would not go back to the restaurant again in the future.", "author": "Shaina C."}

We came in at a lil after 9pm so there's no line, but the bad thing is that not enough sushi varieties to eat.  We have to wait for 10 minutes to get a fresh new sushi another thing is, when you eat here dont give the sushi chef sake. they are going to lose their concentration and they will forget your order.  We asked specifically for salmon skin roll with no cucumber, it is legibly write on the order menu but somehow since this chinese sushi chef dude had 3 shots of sake, he forgot that he still have duty to make our salmon skin roll.  We waited at least 15 min and not until we asked for our order and he started to realize that our order was not being made.  On top of that, he messed up with our order ( he added cucumber).   Once again, sake don't mix with a working chinese sushi chef, because when their face turn red they just forget where they are and what they are doing at that moment.  So I'll give 'em 2 stars for the effort that they made until this guy got drunk. ^_^", "author": "Albert W."}

My last visit was around September 2007.  The wait is never too long at this restaurant.  So when we were seated at the sushi bar, I thought it was real pretty watching the glistening gold boats float by.  I think they need to put more variety on their boats though.  I usually like eating unagi but they didn't have it - and that's one of the most commonly ordered sushi's!  I had to ask for one and I didn't even get to pick it off the nice gold boat....lol just kidding.  But yeah, I think their entrees are shrinking too.  Coming here my first time around early 2006, I ordered a generous bowl of chicken teriyaki for less than 5 dollars at lunch.  This last visit after their remodeling, I ordered a beef teriyaki bowl and it had only 5 mini small pieces of beef, and 60% of the beef was made of chunks of fat!  Disgusting!

I try Japanese food like the way I try crepes, go in and try any restaurant I see until I find the best one.  So far, this is the best place, especially since they have sushi boats (which I heard is what the restaurant's name means in japanese).  You can grab any plate as it moves in front of you.  The plates' costs are $1.00 / $1.50 / $1.95 and we usually can get full in the range of $22.  It may sound little, but if you go there, see the plates, and do a little calculation, then it's not so damn cheap, even though it's quite reasonable.  You can also order other items than can't float around, like udon, from the menu.  The tea is delicious (they say i'ts green tea, but I doubt it because it's better than any green tea I've ever tasted) and they refill it as much as you want.  The waitress are all really nice and have good customer service.  The only down side is their bathroom.  This may be weird, but I take a restaurant's bathroom condition into consideration to know if they are sanitary or not.  Their bathroom is pretty dirty and it makes you feel like you don't want to be in there for more than 30 seconds.  \n\nTip: it's usually crowded on weekend nights and hard to find parking space.  If you come as a group, have one person go in the restaurant to reserve/ wait for a table/seats while everyone else circle the block to look for parking space.", "author": "Karen C."}

They have given us many products that we incorporate in our lives (consumer electronics, reliable automobiles, etc.) but, for me, the sushi boat has opened my eyes.  You sit down and food starts floating past your plate - pick and eat.  Unlike many places  where a possibly unmotivated waitperson takes your order to a kitchen in the back where your food is prepared by unknown persons, with the sushi boat you can sit right in front of the sushi chef and watch him (or her) cut the fish, roll the rice and then you can snatch it before it has even settled in on its little boat for a ride - from hand to mouth to stomach in less time than a California roll can circumnavigate the sushi boat sea even once.", "author": "David P."}
