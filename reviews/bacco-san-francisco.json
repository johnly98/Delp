I was invited to eat here from working with Shari Dominici at my dealership Audi San Francisco in which she purchased two cars from me with her family so I came to support her local business and try it out! \n\nI was beyond impressed with the level of comfort and service Shari and her staff provided me with and my best friend Corey. We went with a couple of options she recommended paired with wine and it was decadent. \n\nI had lovely evening out and this is definitely a place to go to if you haven't done so already!

My favorite dish is the tonnarelli (squid ink pasta), and for dessert, the puff pastry really does it for me. They do have interesting specials most nights, and I'll often go for those. The ambiance is quite relaxed and warm; the decor is equally warm and inviting. \n\nAlso, the wine list is very reasonable. You can get a delicious Italian wine without spending in the three-digit per bottle category.\n\nThis restaurant has a special place in my heart. The owner, Shari, helped me with some bread, which is delicious, for my engagement. Shari is a total sweetheart and really cares about her diners.", "author": "Pascal R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-10", "description": "Not that I've ever been a regular or have a particularly special relationship with Bacco, but I've got to say...it's nice to see that they're still going strong after all of these years!  Although I can't recall what I ate, I still remember coming here when I was a kid with family for a birthday dinner.  Fast forward to just last month and there I was, seated at the same corner table by the window that I sat at so many years ago.  Kind of cool, if I do say so myself...\n\nLocated on the far edge of the main drag through Noe Valley, Bacco is practically a staple of the neighborhood.   In business for two decades and counting?  Definitely a sign that they're doing something right, despite the menu showing a bit of its age.  While not exactly dated, their dishes are definitely more classic than innovative.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, but worth mentioning if you're expecting a trendy, Mission-type of spot with dishes doused in truffle oil.\n\nLooking over the menu (appetizers, pastas, and entrees/meats), several things caught my eye, especially their lasagna and gnocchi dishes.  In the end though, from their list of specials, I opted to get the BUCATINI AMERICANA ($21) - Hollow Spaghetti with Onions, Pancetta, and Spicy Tomato Sauce.  Pretty decent overall, but it (literally) left me wanting.  On the one hand, the sauce (albeit sweet) had a nice kick, the pasta was well cooked, and the pancetta was super flavorful.  However, in the other, the portion felt really light for the money.\n\nFood aside, Bacco is a solid spot, particularly if you're looking for something low key.  Service is friendly and parking, much like snagging a table here, isn't terribly difficult compared to other restaurants in the city.  All in all, though they may not have ever amazed me (now or as a kid), Bacco is closer to four stars than three for me.  I'll just have to try to make sure it's not another decade plus before I come back again!", "author": "Mike L."}

They have an array of wine selections and a very small set menu. For the hefty price, you don't get much in quantity and the quality was definitely lacking. I was not wowed by the pasta dishes that we received and the chicken entree was dry and tasteless. The appetizers were never big enough to share but just for a single person to literally nibble on. However, they do make a great pesto sauce/ dip that they bring out with bread as a small starter. I recommend looking over the menu first to see if they have what you want because there were very minimal substitutions and majority of their pasta is in a tomato based sauce and not a cream sauce.", "author": "Michael L."}

The food wasn't that great, wasn't that bad, just average. Very, very average.\n\nWe had two appetizers. The cavolo (sauteed kale) was fine, but kind of bland. The crostino was tasty--but it was so simple, the kind of thing that it bothers me to pay for.\n\nMain course: she got the fregola (Sardinian pasta, clams, mussels, scallops, saffron, fresh tomato). It seemed promising, but it failed to live up to expectations. The sauce was kind of Chef Boyardee-y.

Given that -- why don't they provide a list of those options?  Instead, the (obviously annoyed and hurried) owner/hostess came over to our table and very quickly rattled off what dishes can be made gluten-free.  She even got a bit huffy when we asked for clarification.  The person in our party who is gluten-intolerant is 90 years old and she couldn't possibly follow that fast (and fairly rude) recitation.  \n\nService was fairly friendly, but it our waiter is skilled in the \"avoiding looking at our table\" school of restaurant service, so it took quite an effort to get our check.\n\nWith all of the excellent restaurants in SF, and many serving dishes similar to those offered here, it's hard to understand why Bacco doesn't make more of an effort to make its service better.

I'm disabled and needed a bench seat, so I made a special request reservation and followed it up with a call to confirm when we were on our way over. The hostess stressed that she had a large party coming and we would have to limit our dining time to 90 minutes. I said we'd be right over. When I arrived, she had apparently seated the next guest to arrive in our seat, so we had to wait for them to move. The whole experience was a little weird - the hostess was the only woman on the staff and seemed harried. servers banged down utensils, etc. on the table. Despite the apparent need to get us out of there, we were left unattended for a long time between dinner and dessert, so we cut short the dessert to make our window. The food was decent and the other server was good, so it wasn't a *bad* experience, but I don't think we'll go back.", "author": "Amy T."}

The mussels were huge and juicy but i actually thought the clams were the highlight of that dish. I ordered the pasta special for the evening which consisted of fettuccine pasta with porcini mushrooms and prawns. It was very rich and fairly tasty. However I don't know if I'd order it again. A bit too rich for my particular taste. My friend ordered the vermicelli, badically spaghetti and metlatballs. A classic which you can't go wrong with. We ordered the lemon crostata for dessert.

And the tomato sauce didn't go well with the taste of ink pasta. The corners of the pasta sheet on my Lasagna was burned. I don't recall that's an authentic approach when I tried Lasagna in Italy.

Check out their new WINE BAR, which offers a fun alternative to standard table seating and I hear they'll soon offer WINE and FLIGHT CLUBS and special Club Member Events to feature their broad and impressive WINE LIST of glasses and bottles to enjoy onsite and to take home. \n\nTheir rating is the result of owner Shari's insistence on consistently renovating/updating the environment to provide a top-notch, super clean (from the bathroom to the kitchen and dining room) and soothing, dining experience. I've lived nearby for 21 of their 23 years and have enjoyed the incredible quality and consistency of their delicious starters, salads, home made bread, entrees and vini over the years. Their food is definitely high quality, modern versions of authentic Italian fare featuring the Bay Area's best quality ingredients that also inspire exciting seasonal treats. What's more impressive is the outstanding service that filters straight down from Shari's sincere warmth, kindness and desire to provide every customer a truly un-rushed, relaxing and satisfying dining experience you rarely get to enjoy in today's insanely rushed world. \n\nBacco has that casual, warm, family feel, while still providing a stellar, current dining experience.Their Beet Salad and Insalato Bacco, delicious meatballs, stuffed, grilled calamari and seasonal Crostino (fava bean puree) are Antipasti faves. All of their Primi/Pastas/Risotto are incredible, but my faves are their Rigatoni (a mainstay throughout their 23 years) is hard to pass. When I do, their Squid Ink pasta, vermicelli with meat balls and Sacchetto are not to be missed. Top these off with their fab Primi of which I always enjoy their special fish dishes, veal scallopine, pork & steak entrees, all of which are served with fresh veggies, which is perfect! The perfect sides are their Brussel sprouts and Sauteed kale/spinach which are outstanding.\n\nLastly, every great meal needs the perfect sweet treat to finish things off. Having lived in Italy, travelled the world extensively and with many native Italian friends, I try every Tiramisu I can get my hands on there, throughout the EU, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and here in the US. Hands down, BACCO HAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST TIRAMISU you'll ever have. \n\nGluten Free: Bacco offers numerous Gluten Free options and even provides Gluten Free bread on request so Shari's GF clients won't have to miss their faves. \n\nWhile many longtime San Francisco business owners are being forced out of SF, Shari gives new - longtime customers many reasons to return time and again and every reason to support this super-special, single mom, woman-owned San Francisco institution, Ristorante Bacco and Wine Bar.", "author": "Marc S."}

The antipasti platter came with a tomato bruschetta, shredded crab crostini, calamari/white bean combo, prosciutto and various grilled veggies.

I had to ask for the wine list,  the bread and water were practically dumped on our table. My father and husband both ordered the catch of the day,  and then were told that they had just ran out of it. My daughter ordered the risotto and was served brasato instead.   She had to wait another 15 minutes to get her meal while the rest of us ate ours. While our table was being cleared of the antipasti dishes,  one of the waitstaff toppled over my son's glass of red wine. It was replaced promptly.  The food was good--not bad.

Rather, with muted tones and a peaceful setting, it provides an upscale, but comfortable, elegant dining experience.\n\nThe menu has something for everyone, from omnivores and vegeterrorists to the gluten-free crowd.  Tender and moist, the calamari served on a bed on cannellini beans and topped with fresh arugula ($12) was grilled to perfection.  The creaminess of local goat cheese and the acidity of the honey citrus dressing were perfect foils for sweetness of the beets in the barbarbietole (beet salad, $12).  Cooked perfectly al dente, the housemade pasta and succulent coniglio (rabbit, $24) was delicious.  Lightly saut\u00e9ed in olive oil, the cavolo (black kale, $9) was complemented by just the right amount of garlic. And, oh the bread!! By and large Italian bread is uber-crunchy and painfully dry.  Not so at Ristorante Bacco.  The bread was fresh and soft and delicious--so tasty that the contents of the first basket disappeared all too rapidly.\n\nAn autentica cameriere italiano (authentic Italian waiter) provides excellent service.  The servers define attentiveness:  the water jug was never empty and wine glasses were barely set down before another glass was proffered. The staff are very knowledgeable about the menu and wine list, stopping to understand diners' preferences and providing good recommendations.  The good-sized and reasonably priced wine list exclusively features Italian selections, and there are ample offerings by the glass to complement any dish on the menu.\n\nUpon dining at Ristorante Bacco, you will understand why it is one of only three Italian restaurants in San Francisco to receive the Marchio Ospitalita Italiana, an award that distinguishes those restaurants with the highest quality of Italian hospitality.", "author": "CJ G."}

We were greeted fairly quick and shown to a pretty small table for 2.\nTo start off, I really liked the bread with the pesto olive oil.  Thinking about it, it was the best out of my meal.  \nFrom the choices, I picked the Salted Cod on grilled polento as the appetizer.  While it had an interesting taste and texture, it was too heavy for me as a starter.  My main entree was the fish of the day, which was Cod with white wine and lemon capers.  The cod was really bland while the sauce had a strong vinegar taste, but I couldn't taste any lemons.  I was really disappointed with my fish, in the end I was dipping the cod in my friend's steak balsamic sauce to get some flavors.  On the other hand, the vegetables and potatoes that came with the fish was actually pretty good tasting.  For dessert I ordered the tiramisu which was fairly good, but a bit too much cream and not enough espresso or rum flavor for me.\nMaybe I should have ordered something different instead?

This place is only a 3 block walk from my Aunt's house.  She said that the last time she had dined at this restaurant was over 20 yrs ago. The major difference she immediately noticed upon entering the establishment was how loud the place was compared to 20 yrs ago. Apparently this use to be a very quaint and quiet restaurant.  Tonight, the customers who were inside dining were all pretty loud. We kind of did have to yell across the table a couple of times during our dinner because it was difficult hearing eachother.\n\nOther than the noise level,  everything else about the restaurant was pretty darn good.  We started with the prosciutto with organic cantaloupe.  It was soooooooo good! The cantaloupe was extremely sweet and juicy and the thin slices of prosciutto complimented it very well. For our entrees, I ordered the gnocchi with mozzarella and basil and my Aunt ordered the squid ink pasta with calamari. Both were absolutely delicious!  I was a pig and finished my entire dish. My Aunt ended up bringing half of her order home because she wasn't an oinker like me =oP\nAnd in all fairness, the portions were on the generous side.\n\nFor my first time dining at this establishment,  I have nothing but good things to say. The waitstaff was attentive and friendly, the buser was spot on and worked like clockwork. And the hostess was very nice and welcoming.

To top it off the pasta itself was a semi wavy thick noodle type, that (I'm pretty sure was purchased from next door's fresh Italian ingredients) was practically hand made!\n\nOnly dish I was not impressed was the chocolate cake.

I have to say, this was a lovely interaction and it's nice to know that Bocca cares about its customers. I could tell that this is more than a job to her and it is personal when someone has a bad experience. Shari said that she refuses to let people have a bad experience because when people come into Bocca, \"it's like they're coming into my home.\" She mentioned that she had the chef remake the same dish I had ordered, and she agreed that there wasn't enough truffle on the dish. Overall, she made me feel good about the whole thing and it is really wonderful to see businesses with owners that genuinely care.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nAfter taking a semester of Italian, it really had me craving Italian food. I'm usually wary of neighborhood restaurants because people usually like them for reasons other than the food. They usually like the convenience, how kid-friendly a place is, etc. I thought I'd give Bacco a shot tonight, because I really wanted some fresh pasta with careful ingredients, but instead had a terribly mediocre, just really awful pasta dinner at Bacco. \n\nThe pasta special was a linguine with pancetta, egg, pecorino, and shaved black truffles for $35. The pasta was not hot, sort of lukewarm, and a little bit too al dente (although, it's better than it being mushy and overcooked), there was too much cooking water that had transferred over, making the dish watery and not creamy whatsoever. I make carbonara at home several times a month, so I know the technique of adding egg to the pasta and stirring before it has time to cook and it ends up being a lovely creamy texture, but that didn't happen in this case. The pasta was really lacking SALT and the fat from the pancetta wasn't rendered out enough. All of this for $35. To add more insult, the truffle was no where to be found. I could see little black shavings, but couldn't taste them or smell them. What's the point if it doesn't add anything to the flavor of the dish?!\n\nThe squid ink pasta was slightly better, but still extremely mediocre. At $20 for one plate, you think it would be more exquisite, but the sauce was very bland, lacking depth of flavor. The pasta was nicely cooked, so that's one good thing I can say, but as I was eating,  I kept thinking \"what am I going to eat for dinner when I get home?\" The service was okay and professional and the bread was decent when it was first served warm, but it got a bit weird as it cooled off. Also, the pesto-type sauce they served with it had the same problem of being too watery. \n\nI feel pretty insulted after my meal here and know I won't be back even though I live in the neighborhood. This is just another one of those neighborhood joints that is resoundingly disappointing especially for the price.", "author": "Victoria J."}

My favorite dish is the tonnorelli , a squid ink pasta. It's made with fresh homemade pasta cooked al dente in a delicious red sauce with calamari. The dish is simple but oh so delicious. We also tried the meatballs which were made just right, the meat was moist and subtle and the sauce..it was just mouthwatering. The bread is also made fresh in house and comes with a pesto and olive oil dipping sauce.  The service is impeccable the woman that always greets us (I think she is the manager) is very outgoing and friendly.  The ambiance is romantic, candlelight, small and intimate setting.

We ordered for appetizer:\n-calamari\n-moscardini(baby octopus) \n\nI liked it. The calamari was soft enough that its not chewy like leather and the moscardini had a good flavor with the red wine and tomato sauce. For the entree, i got the:\n\n-Tonarelli(squid ink pasta)\n\nThe pasta was cooked al dente, the sauce was good and the portion was just right. The only criticism that i would have to give would probably be that i needed more salt! But hey, i think thats just my taste bud so it wasnt a big deal for me. Service was good too, waiter always came by to ask about my food, and drinks were always filled up. But i guess, if i have to say something, they do make me wait for a while to get my order and bill....but ill let that go considering it was a saturday night. \n\nFor desserts:\n\n-LA PANNA COTTA ALLE CIGLIEGE(buttermilk panna cotta)\n-LA CROSTATA DI LIMONI(lemon curd butter crust)\n\nabsolutely my favorite combo for desserts. The lemon curd is actually pretty sweet, maybe a little too sweet for me, since i like the taste of lemon more in my lemon curd. But i adore the panna cotta, so butter-y and milky, so good. \n\nI think overall, i had a pretty good time here.

Big bites of [REAL] bacon, quail eggs, cheese crumbles, and walnuts.

It was Pistachio crusted on a bed of greens and paired with a nice smooth and lumpy mash potatoes, but the porkchop itself was overcooked and dry. Perhaps it was because all our entree's came out at the same time, but it just didn't work out. \n\nTiramisu [http://s3-media3.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/XH5FIh_GvcX4_J2uj0WIvw/l.jpg] [http://s3-media2.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/UZ5wk5qy36xMuEeNxe_Pfg/l.jpg]\nReally, I'm a sucker for tiramisu and with that being said, I've eaten a ton of tiramisu in my day to say that Bacco's was forgettable. It looked very unorganized with the ladyfingers and insides oozing out. Of course, it was still good, but I definitely had better. \n\n\nThe food was either a hit or a miss. The highlight of the meal was my girlfriend's Handmade Penne Pasta dish, which was delicious! The service was a tad slow and felt rushed, but it was a Sunday evening after all, and we didn't see that waiter that \"greeted\" us when we got there by the end of the night (probably jetted home). The madame also comped one of our desserts (Ganesh Cookies [http://s3-media2.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/RhSgVdxfPH0NKV7D_jeDTQ/l.jpg]), which we didn't really enjoy, so that was very much appreciated. \n\nI'll definitely have a second go at Ristorante Bacco in the future.", "author": "Albert L."}

I mean who celebrates a 1,100th review. Well, I thought I'd mark this less than monumental occasion by sharing an especially nice dining experience I had at a restaurant that's been around for quite a while but has just been touched by tragedy. \n\nBacco is the sort of out-of-the-way Italian eatery that you hope lands in your neighborhood but never seems to. Noe Valley, however, is rife with such places, and truthfully, my friend Maggie and I were thinking about going to Firefly up the block on 24th Street. Because they had an hour wait, we decided to trundle back down the slight hill to Bacco where we were greeted with open arms. \n\nNow Maggie and I were aware that the owner had been in the news. Sadly, he had gone missing on a fishing trip in Hawaii, so we speculated the staff would be desultory. Not at all. The service was warm and personable. There wasn't the slightest clue of the ongoing heartbreak they must have been feeling. I have to admit I got so immersed in the appetizing menu that I wasn't thinking about it. Everything we ordered was a blessing to the taste buds. They seem to stick with the items they do well and not really change them. A smart approach indeed. \n\nMaggie went for the $11 Crostino, which consisted of two wedges of bread crostini covered in a chopped broccoli rabe an amazing fava bean puree and topped with shaved pecorina cheese and truffle oil (see my photo). A knockout. I ordered the $12 Pan-Seared Stuffed Calamari, three pieces filled with a cannellini bean puree and all lying on a small bed of radicchio (see my photo). It was a different take on squid that tasted fresh and hearty. \n\nFor the entree, I went for the $18 plate of Pappardelle, obviously homemade pasta which was prepared perfectly al dente and nicely turned in a light tomato lamb sauce (see my photo). Maggie had the $18 Tonnarelli, also perfectly al dente but thin noodles. Hers was mixed with good-sized seared wild prawns, baby artichokes and fresh tomatoes (see my photo). Lovely. We shared a satisfying side contorni dish, the $8 Bietola, which was Swiss chard liberally blended with extra-virgin olive oil, garlic shavings and bits of hot peppers (see my photo). \n\nWe had to try one of their desserts since they advertised them as homemade. Their $8 Tiramisu is among the best I've ever tasted, and yes, I've been to Italy a number of times. Just slightly chilled, it was the ideal combination of ladyfingers, espresso, rum, and mascarpone cheese, all sprinkled with a nice cocoa (see my photo). Maggie and I were so pleased with our meal, but it did strike me to hit the Web that night to see if there was an update on owner Paolo Dominici. \n\nThey had found his remains earlier that day. I just want to express my deepest sympathies to the Dominici family for their loss and applaud them for the unyielding quality in both food and service during such a trying time. There is a note from the family on their web site in the \"About\" section.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...Italian as buono as if you were in Roma\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...a nice open space with Italianate touches in a nice, quiet neighborhood\nSERVICE - 5 stars...stellar under tragic circumstances\nTOTAL - 5 stars...Bacco will carry on...", "author": "Ed U."}

I was looking at all their menus and they all look very appealing (very hard to choose). We ordered the grill calamari/squid and it turned out very different from other calamaris that we normally eat at restaurants. It reminded me of the Japanese style grilled whole squid but this one is juicy and with sauce maybe because it's served on top of salad and I actually like it. The tomato with bruschetta was really good. Too bad there's only 3 in one order. When it came to the entrees my friend and I was indecisive since everything on the menu sounds like a good option so we had the server pick for us. We had the beaded veal and also the stuffed pasta. The beaded veal is very different. Its served with veggies, cheese, and prosciutto and they put the battered veal on top. It's really unique but the veal is a bit dry maybe because of the batter. The stuffed pasta reminded me of lasagna since after cutting open the pasta, it's somewhat in layers and is very cheesy. I love the sauce and would order this again. The pasta is really fresh and I love it but it's really filling. The server and I believe the owner gave us a complimentary tiramisu and it's really good. I'm not a sweet tooth and I normal don't eat sweets but their tiramisu is just right; not too sweet. I can taste the rum. I love their service; very friendly and welcoming.

Both were superb, and the salad included chunks of fine cheese and cubes of panchetta.

Service was just adequate and 2.) Food delivered to expectations, but nothing exceeded.\n\nAppetizers:\n\n-Meatballs were just okay, maybe even below average. But the sauce was delicious and flavorful.\n-Crostini was good, but nothing to write home about.\n-Baby Octopus... didn't try it, but the table didn't seem to swoon over them.\n\nEntrees:\n\n-Appreciate that you can do a \"Appetizer\" sized pasta order for your entree. It allowed us to try a couple more things on the menu.\n-Pasta dishes were creative and tasty. Everything was well prepared and done to a professionally and technically sound level.\n\nDesserts:\n\n-Tiramisu was just okay. Ladyfingers were overly soaked and there was just a bit too much espresso flavor.\n-Apple tart was delicious and pretty much a perfect dessert\n-Panna Cotta was done pretty well... a little too stiff, but the buttermilk was a nice touch to this variation", "author": "Arick R."}

The weather, the night, the food, the service, the wine...everything came together perfectly at Bacco's.   The dinning experience was right out of Italy.  We were not rushed.  There was never a feeling that \"your 90-minutes are up, now get out because we need this table.\"  We savored the polpette (meatballs) while enjoying our wine and perusing our dinner options.  For dinner, the gnocchi are must, but so is the brasato (braised short ribs).  Add a side of cavoletti (brussel sprouts) and/or the fagiolini (string beans), a nice bottle of wine and you will feel transported to one of the little restaurants in one of those little towns that dot the Italian country side.", "author": "Beth V."}

The iodine from the ink of the infused square shaped spaghetti yields a bit of a mild sea taste to it, and the pieces of spicy calamari and tomato adds even more depth of flavor to the entire dish -overall a very alluring flavor profile.\n\nThe gnocchi dumplings came out piping hot, flavored with beet but very ecru colored in appearance, was simply topped with gorgonzola cheese, and toasted hazelnuts.  The warmth of this dish left me a little starry-eyed, so creamy, delicious, and wholesome.  The half order, was the perfect amount for sharing amongst our table of three, along with the string beans which were saut\u00e9ed to a tender crisp, and topped with rich spicy tomato sauce.\n\nThe slices of the grilled bavette steak Tagliata were delicious, and the medium-rare doneness was point-on: the sides well browned, and warm through the middle with just a hint of red.  And served with a thin crispy sheet of Italian flatbread / Pane Carasau.  \n\nGreat service, Quiet location, and extremely fresh food.", "author": "Ty T."}

The dipping sauce looked like pesto, but tasted fishy which was weird.  When we inquired, we found out that it was made with Anchovies.  It was not to our liking, but part of it may have been due to the surprise factor\n\n2) Wine - 1/2 bottle of the Soave.  Tasty, decent price.  No complaints\n\n3) Gluten Free Meatballs - they were tasty, but were served at room temperature.  Would much rather had them warm.  \n\n4) Brussel sprouts - they were rather tasty, but the meat that came with them just made the dish look unappealing.  Large cubes and they were rather tough, but tasted good.  Would suggest going with more like bacon bits so that you can have little pieces with each bite of sprout.\n\n5) Gluten Free Gnocci - this dish was ok.  They were dense, which is not the style I like.  Not bad, but not a dish we would be excited to order again\n\n6) TAGLIATELLE - started without the parmesan and the dish was flat.  The boar ragu had little flavor.  Even after getting the parmesan and pepper and adding salt, it was under seasoned.  \n\n7) Vanilla Ice Cream with Espresso - I am not a coffee drinker and this dish started out great.  The warm and cold mixture really was something that I really liked.  However, after the espresso cooled and mixed with the ice cream completely, the dish started to loose its flavor.\n\nI really dont want to give this a 2 star, as it wasn't terrible, but yelp does say that 2 is \"I have experienced better\".  I always look for the would I order that again factor when reviewing dishes and a restaurant.  I cant say that any of the dishes as they were served would compel me to order them again or want to come back.\n\nReally a shame as when we came and learned about all the gluten free options, we were really hoping that this would be a big success and get us to drive across town to eat here frequently.", "author": "Markus S."}

I ordered it because I had never had fresh sardines. They were quite good! Then for entrees he ordered their specialty, risotto which came with smoked salmon and pink peppercorns.  My husband makes the most incredible risotto, so this was a dicey proposition.  I ordered the appetizer portion of mezzluna: ravioli with ricotta and cod in a saffron butter sauce.  I really like that you can order any of the pasta dishes in an appetizer size. They were delicious! Fresh, fresh pasta dough and just enough of filling not the least bit \"fishy\" just a hint of the cod.\nNow, back to the risotto: it came on a large plate and was a sizable portion for one person.  He ate ALL of it! They use the rice common to Venice rather than arborio rice, which is most common for risotto.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-30", "description": "My recent second trip to Ristorante Bacco confirmed my lackluster first impression: the food and service is mediocre at best. \n\nIt was early on a Tuesday evening, and my party of six was one of the few occupied tables in the place. A group of boisterous businessmen entered, and I couldn't believe it when the host directed them to the table right next to us when the restaurant was nearly empty. Fortunately one of the gentlemen suggested it might be a good idea for them to be seated elsewhere. \n\nAs for value, the restaurant is quite overpriced. We started with two orders of the meatball appetizer to share ($20 for six plum-sized meatballs). At that price, they had better be the best meatballs I've ever eaten. Unfortunately they weren't--while the meat was tender, the overly salty tomato sauce dominated the flavor of the beef. \n\nNext, the beet salad: sigh. The beets completely lacked flavor, as did the olive oil drizzled over the plate. A dash of vinegar might have countered the bitterness of the arugula leaves. The goat cheese was the only thing on the plate that I enjoyed. \n\nOne person in my party ordered a steak, medium rare ($28). It arrived to the table medium well, with a charred, inedible hunk of radicchio and a tiny mound of mashed potatoes. \n\nThe service also was a mystery, considering the lack of customers. We sat with our menus for quite a while before anyone came over to check on us. Once the entrees were delivered, our server vanished. My father-in-law, celebrating his 80th birthday, politely pointed out to a busser that he had inadvertently dropped his napkin on the ground. The napkin remained on the ground for the rest of our meal, and a replacement was not delivered. \n\nThere are better places in Noe Valley to enjoy quality Italian food at a reasonable price.", "author": "Susan P."}

We can never understand why we're able to walk in without reservations nearly every time. It may be a cliche, but you really do feel like you're in a neighborhood restaurant in Italy: great European-style service, perfectly prepared food, and warm ambiance.\r\n\r\nAll of the waiters are Italian, and their European approach is evident: they're not just here while they write their screenplay or find their next tech job; they're professional waiters who know a lot about food (and wine) in general and Bacco's menu in particular. \r\n\r\nThe decor is cozy and Tuscan-ish: large smooth terracotta tiles set on a diagonal covering the floor, color-washed walls, long/heavy curtains, and bas-relief sculptures of Bacchus and his nymphs. \r\n\r\nThe menu changes seasonally, but many items remain year-round. Unless you've spent your life eating at Olive Garden, Bacco's not going to change the way you think about Italian food. But that's not really the issue: come here expecting good food, simply prepared. \r\n\r\nAppetizers cover a wide range: there's usually a soup (often bland and forgettable), a special salad (usually one of the best choices; they sound more boring than they turn out), and some seasonal small plate. In the pasta section, our favorites include a rigatoni dish with lamb ragu and tiny peas. The usual assortments of meat-centric entrees are workmanlike (and more expensive) and generally not quite as interesting as the pastas. But if you see something that catches your eye, go for it: all of them use top-notch ingredients and are prepared just as they should be. \r\n\r\nThe wine list offers a good assortment of California reds and whites, as well as a nice assortment of Italian varietals. All are reasonably priced. We rarely order dessert, but on the few occasions we have saved sufficient room, we've been rewarded.", "author": "anita c."}

Their calamari (picture uploaded) was soft and slightly crisped with a bit of stuffing, served on a bed of cream.

We got seated quickly, and although the restaurant felt a bit small, it was a nice, cozy, intimate setting to have a good conversation.\n\nThe food itself was very well-prepared Italian food. For appetizers, we got meatballs and calamari, both of which were delicious. The meatballs were a bit on the small size (and there were only 3 served), but the meat was well-flavored, and the tomato sauce didn't dominate the dish. The calamari was in a light cream sauce, and it was in some kind of pasta (not the typical deep-fried kind that I'm used to) - making it much more appealing than usual. The main course was the highlight - I had spaghetti with bolognese sauce. The meat sauce was well-flavored and complemented the wheat noodles quite well, even though I generally think wheat noodles have less flavor than cardboard. There was also some fresh cheese on top as well, which added a nice creamy hint to it as well. Dessert was the chocolate cookies with chocolate filling (they have a name, but it escapes me now) and glass of milk on the side. It was good, but I've had better desserts elsewhere.\n\nDefinitely a nice little Italian restaurant that I'd visit again, and the prices were pretty decent to boot.

Extremely warm and attentive.  Luca seated us, recommended wines, and took our order, all with a personal touch.  Couldn't have been better.  As for food, the calamari and the pasta.  Originally, we ordered the octopus antipasti but it wasn't available, and we were recommended the calamari instead.  Good thing we were, because it was phenomenal!  Three calamari \"dumplings\" essentially, stuffed with diced vegetables, accompanied by spinach and a delicious cream sauce.  Very tasty yet not heavy at all.  The pasta dishes were also very good, in particular the pasta itself which was cooked to perfection.  Oh, and the tiramisu was fantastic, without question.\n\nCons:  The asparagus, clams, and mussels weren't anything to write home about.  I like the meatballs -- they were light and on the dry side, almost like turkey -- but I could see how others would expect something a little more savory.  We were also disappointed about the octopus not being available, even though we were there at 6:30 pm for dinner.\n\nOn the balance, we had a great meal.  The service was excellent enough to be distinct, and the food was delicious to the point where I would want to go again just to try the other pastas.  Just as a point of personal preference, I would have liked a slightly more upscale setting, perhaps warmer lighting and better spacing of the tables and seats, while retaining the overall rustic-ness (rusticity?) of the restaurant.

A few things to know about Bacco:\n\n- The first time we ate here, we were not impressed. My wife is vegetarian and ordered the butternut squash ravioli. They had actually messed up her order and she had to wait until everyone else was nearly finished eating, until she could even start. When it finally arrived and she was starving, her excitement was quickly squelched when she saw that they serve 2 ravs for a pretty high price. Needless to say, she left hungry and frustrated. \n\n- Months later we decided to try them again since we live very nearby. She had a pasta dish and really enjoyed it. Most exciting was when i learned that they had begun serving GF pasta AND they were very knowledgeable about what was/was not GF. \n\n- Last night we ate there. My wife ordered the gnocchi and, unfortunately, found it to be a little boring. It was tasty...just not that exciting. I had the risotto and it was fantastic! For dessert, we ordered the afforgatto and it came with a cookie in it. We regretted to have to send it back and request a new one due to the gluten. The dessert returned a moment later and it was hard to say to if they remade it or just pulled out the cookie. I'm EXTREMELY sensitive and did not get sick so that is a thumbs up! \n\nAll in all, Bacco is on our list of places we will go back to. They have a nice, eclectic wine list that's not too overpriced, and foods for both of us.

Soon afterwards, they started putting chairs on all the tables that were no longer occuppied.  By 9:30, when we received our entrees we all felt that we were intruding on the staff and should hurry and leave so they could close the place.  With all the employee activity, it was difficult to relax and enjoy our food and wine.Then, when we were finishing our food, the check appeared before the waiter asked if we would like anymore wine, desert or coffee.  Having worked in restaurants myself, I understand the desire to close up as quickly as possible so the staff can enjoy their evening too, but when it takes away from the experience for the customer, then the employees need to be patient and less conspicous when it comes to closing the restaurant.

Ordered the Bacco salad for the first course, steak for the second, and sorbet for dessert.  The salad was delicious and the steak was amazing with the balsamic reduction sauce. However, the raspberry sorbet was too sweet and I could hardly taste raspberry flavor in it. Service was fine, but with half of the tables empty when my friend and I went there, I felt they could do a better job. Still highly recommend their food :)!", "author": "Sara Z."}

Walking in will probably mean a very long wait if they can fit you in at all.\nThe pastas are wonderful and I love the daily risottos - be prepared to wait for it as it is cooked to order and really does take 25 to 30 minutes.  The lamb chops with reduced grapes are lick your plate clean good!  The flavors are simple but everything is fresh and well done.  \nThe only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is the wine list.  I really want wines by the glass and a nice variety of them to choose from.", "author": "Karen C."}

Over the years, the food has improved and most recently, the menu has become more adventurous.  We all love the vermicilli with small meatballs, but any of the pasta dishes are excellent.  In fact, we so love the pasta, that we've rarely tried any of the more traditional entrees.  Entree portions look generous, and the desserts are absolutely delicious (tiramisu or affogatto).

Food was good. I had octopus, which was adventuresome. My Rigatoni was too al dente for my taste and the sauce was not inspiring since I was told it was their signature pasta, which should have been more memorable.

Service was amazing, as it's been each time we've come: water glasses refilled, wobbly table fixed without asking, etc.  Since we dine with a small child, we usually ask for the side area left of the entrance/main dining room.\n\nThe 'amazing' part - right after ordering, the bread/pesto arrived. And soon after (within about 10 minutes max), all of our entrees!  Extra kudos for keeping a toddler entertained with quickly arriving food plates.\n\nEveryone ordered pasta dishes and \"seemed\" to enjoy them. I use the word \"seemed\" because it's cold/flu season and 1/2 of our party had dulled senses, so I can't accurately comment about their tastebud experiences. I had the tagliolini with rock shrimp/arugula and loved it - perfectly cooked pasta and very light, which was what I wanted.  Paired with a Sangiovese - delicious!\n\nThe kid (who has a good palate and is usually a good gauge of the food) sampled all of our dishes and enjoyed the rigatoni the most, followed by the tagliolini and the vermicelli/tuscan meatballs.\n\nBy the time we left, all tables (except one) were filled in our area.  The main dining area looked pretty full too.\n\nMinor critiques: Pesto served with bread could use a little more flavoring; check took a while to get once it was busy.\n\nOverall:  great service, homey food, cozy environment, kid-friendly.

Another in our group got the rabbit sugo that was mediocre at best, and the polenta appetizer was not good. I feel like the people who really like this place must just not be that into good food.

It had bread cooked in it so it added some texture.  \n\nFor my entree I got the home-cooked thin noodles with arugula and rock shrimp.  It was okay. The noodles and the shrimp were a bit too undercooked and there wasn't really a sauce on it, it was really light.  I liked it, it didn't blow my mind, but it was definitely satisfying.\n\nOur waitresses weren't too friendly and not too attentive.  For example, my iced tea would be empty for awhile before it got refilled.  But, one of our waiters made an effort and was really nice.

AWFUL (especially based on the price for dinner).  If we were seated at a generic, VERY inexpensive restaurant ~ fine,  I would have no real complaints.  But for a \"fine-dining\" restaurant?  No way!\n\nWe were seated by the host who dropped two menus on the table and walked away.  The waiter came up 5 or so minutes later and, without greeting us or telling us his name, asked for our order.  I asked if he could tell me a little about the menu (which I am GUESSING is a 3-course prix-fixe based on the printing of the menu).  His only words: \"Everything is good.\"  Really?!  $100 a head and you have NOTHING to offer me??\n\nI said I would need a few minutes (to discern what I could on my own about their menu items).  The host came over a few minutes later, and to his credit, had a very nice recommendation on wine and a few interesting things to say about how the Scottish Salmon is farmed and the delicacy of the ravioli (which I ordered).\n\nThe appetizers arrived a bit later.  Entirely forgettable.  Not so bad as to give me cause to send it back, but REALLY nothing to talk about.  I heard the table next to us say the same thing after they finished theirs.  And TINY!  (Writing this review, after a \"three\" course meal, I'm still hungry).  I had the Carpaccio with Taleggio cheese and speck.  (**Please see my note later about the Taleggio).  First of all, there was hardly anything on the plate.  One thinly sliced piece of ham (speck) with a tiny bit of warm cheese and some very thinly sliced pieces of pear that definitely looked like they'd seen better days.  And it was warm.  Carpaccio, in my book, is not supposed to be warm.  Maybe it's a style thing.  Whatever.  My fiance ordered the Skate broth soup.  WAY underseasoned.  Watery blahness.\n\nSo here's my note about the Taleggio:  When we walked into the restaurant, it really had the overwhelming smell of....... what is it....?...?...  Ass.  That's what it is.  Something smelled like it had gone wrong in the kitchen.  Very wrong.  But no.  I'm pretty sure it was the Taleggio on my appetizer.  (When the table next to us ~ on the other side of us than the table above ~ sat down, their comment was \"Smelly Cheese, Table of 4\"). \n\nNext comes the entrees.  They were actually pretty good.  I had the Ravioli and my fiance had the Lamb.  My ravioli was very good, but the portion size was VERY small.  Seemed more like the traditional pasta course at an Italian restaurant which is of course followed up by the meat course, because it is NOT ENOUGH FOOD ON IT'S OWN.  My fiance's lamb was good and was almost enough to be called an entree.\n\nThis is my favorite part.  The desserts were slammed on the table by the bus boy (who I do have to say was quite good at refilling waters and clearing our tiny plates of food once we had finished), who said nothing about it (just like the two courses prior to it) and walked away.  I had to wait 10 minutes to flag down the hostess (while our waiter came into the area three times never looking at our table) to tell her I wanted an after dinner drink to enjoy with my dessert.  That came a few minutes later.\n\nMaybe I could forgive if the restaurant was busier and overwhelmed.  But no, they seemed properly staffed.\n\nMaybe I could forgive if it wasn't so damned expensive.  I'm fairly certain the unit cost of our two meals was well under $10.\n\nMaybe I could forgive if I wasn't still HUNGRY!  But no, my fiance is whipping me up an \"after-dinner\" course as I write this.\n\nMaybe I could forgive if the whole place didn't smell like ass.  No helping that.\n\nMaybe I could forgive if our terrible waiter at this \"fine-dining\" establishment wasn't wearing a freaking Bugs Bunny tie.  \n\nSERIOUSLY?!?!?!", "author": "Liz B."}

The wins for the 49ers have been tough to come by lately, so this Sunday's win was particularly special.  I think it put me in a much better mood, which, in turn, boosted Bacco's rating.\n\nMy friend from Sacramento and I came here last night.  I thought that a quiet neighborhood restaurant would be empty on a Sunday night, but the place was actually busy!  I thought it was a good sign, and, as it turns out, I was right! \n\nWe parked right across the street from the restaurant and took a second to take it all in.  Huge windows, perfect lighting and really high ceilings were all signs of a classy place.  Heavy burgundy curtains separated the dining room from the entryway - very East Coast!\n\nThe hostess, a tall Asian woman in an elegant dress showed us to our table.  We were seated at a quite table in the very back of the dining room.  As we walked to our table, my friend commented on how much that place reminded him of Italy, where he vacationed with his wife in September.\n\nOur waiter seemed a bit aloof, and I could swear he had ADD.  He could not wait to move on to a different table, and he almost tried to rush us for some reason.  Maybe it had something to do with the fact that we were seated in the corner.  There were also plenty of so-called \"regulars\" at the restaurant, and I felt like they were getting all the attention.  \n\nI opted for the 3-course prix fixe menu for $35.  After a cold day at Candlestick, I felt like having some soup.  The soup of the day was Cannellini beans and spatzle, so I went for it.  The soup was flavorful and delicious with just the right amount of spices.  \n\nI went with the Bisteca (steak) as my main course.  My first choice was the gnocchi, but it wasn't on the prix fixe menu.  The waiter asked me if I wanted my steak rare, and I replied \"why not?\"  I normally prefer my steak medium-rare, but I knew he had a plan for me.  The steak was very tender and indeed prepared rare.  It was a small (6-8 oz) piece of beef, pre-cut into 5 thick strips of juicy organic beef,  The steak was served with roasted potatoes and a some spinach.  The steak sauce, which I figured to be a hybrid of A-1 steak sauce and balsamic vinegar reduction, was tart but zesty.\n\nAs my third course, I opted for tiramisu.  A generous serving of moist, sumptuous, rum soaked dessert was big enough to share (I didn't).\n\nOverall, it's a wonderful, solid neighborhood restaurant boasting terrific ambiance and very good food.

Initially my service here was attentive with my first waitress who promptly took orders and was on point till she left. \nWhen the food came out i had ordered the pappardelle pasta with short ribs and it was infact quite taste. Very tender meat, well seasoned and the pasta and sauce was also well prepared. Im used to having very wide pappardelle pasta when ordering so when it came out only about 1/4\" wide i was a little disappointed as i love noodles but the flavor made up for the lack of carbs which i was okay with. The rest of the food on the table seemed enjoyable to everybody with little to no complaints. \nThe only issue i had with the evening was the lack of service after the food was delivered to the table. We hadnt seen our waitress in 15-20 minutes after finishing our dinner course and were trying to obtain a dessert menu to finish dinner off. After flaggind down (which i shouldnt have had to do) our new waitress she brought the menus and explained why there was a delay with no apologies and took the dessert order. Out of Cream Brulee on NYE knowing you are going to have a ton of tables and this early in the night (8:30) thats a no no. Went with the Tiramisu and have had much better in countless places and could have done without especially with the added wait and lack of service. \nOverall the dinner was great in terms of quality and taste, i would have loved to have maybe a little more on my plate 20-30% more to be satisfied but it wasnt a small portion by any means. Service could be improved upon especially on a night where you know you will have alot of tables and you only have one waitress from what i saw at a time. I wouldnt return the next time im in the city but i wouldnt say it was a horrible experience at all.", "author": "Jody S."}

We buy pasta at the shop next door twice a week.  Friends and family from out of town always request repeat visits. I always feel like I need a special occasion to eat here because it's so good.\n\nThe food is elegant northern Italian fare, prepared perfectly and without pretense. You won't find smashed potatoes, infused anything, a gajillion confits or phony-cologne-y hipsters here. What you will find is a comfortable, quiet table perfect for conversation and sharing delicious dishes served by an efficient and unobtrusive staff. \n\nOut of consideration for my vegan friends, my usual bite-by-bite is edited. You omnis will know what I'm talking about. We had the $28 three-course, starting with a nice beet and (A) salad and a fantastic butternut squash soup that was spiced subtly enough to allow the gorgonzola (A) to compliment. The main courses were even better:\n\nA: \"I know I shouldn't, but it's been so long since I've had (B) Scaloppini. I'm really tempted.\"\nK: \"I know I'm having the Petrale (C).\"\nA: \"As a kid I looooved (B). I know it has to be good here.\"\nK: \"Go for it.\"\nA: \"Yeah, you're getting the (C), and I just had (D) the other night. I know I don't want (D).\"\nK: \"Just get it. We're gonna halfsie, anyway.\"\nA: \"You wanna halfsie?\"\nK: \"Sure, if it'll get you to make up your mind. I'm hungry. The bread's delicious, but I don't want to fill up on it.\"\nA: \"Sweet! I get to halfsie the guilt.\"\n\nAs anticipated, the (B) was fantastic. The white wine sauce was well balanced and not overwhelmed by the capers. Cutie's (C) was even better. It was moist and flaky with a light seasoning and shaved almonds - absolutely perfect.\n\nThe desserts here are out of this world. I had a Torta al Arancia (orange cake) topped with whipped (E) and drizzled with both a tart orange sauce and sweet raspberry sauce. The strong fruitiness made it seem far healthier than it was.\n\nA: \"You have got to taste this cake. It's nearly as good as our wedding cake (true!).\"\nK: \"Mmm, that is good.\"\nA: \"Good?! It's way better than good!\"\nK:  \"Mm-hmm.\" (stuffing a piece of Puff Pastry Apple Tart in my mouth)\nA: \"OMFG. You win.\"\n\nAt this point, I discover that the special occasions were so because we ate here.", "author": "Andy R."}

In the year and a half that I lived in the land of strollers and labs, I went to Bacco only once.  Not sure why.  (Some things are not meant to be pondered, like how people are so stupid as to elect Ron Dellums and Chris Daly.)  Last week I returned for the first time in three years.  I am glad I came back.  \n\nWhen we sat down we had to navigate our way around two groups of blue hairs.  One group was a couple on a date.  It was very weird.  Have you ever seen a couple in their seventies on a date?  It does not help the appetite.  I fought past the combination of amusement and pathos and buried my nose in the menu.\n\nOur waiter had a vague resemblance to Hal Sparks...except he was Italian.  I think more restaurants should hire celebrity look a likes.  Gives me an excuse to not tip as much.  Hal...or whatever his name was brought us the requisite bread and olive oil.  Beware the bread and olive oil.  It can ruin your meal...in a good way.  I ate about half a loaf.  The oil olive was well flavored.  My girlfriend told me that it was rosemary.  I believed her.  (Why?  Because that's our job guys.)\n\nWe started with the burrata.  Very creamy and even more tasty.  It came with olives and arugula.  I hate arugula, but I loved it with the burrata.  Warning!  One order is more than enough for two people.  I had the gnocchi.  It was flavored with fontina cheese and black truffles.  Loved it.  The portion was perfect.  It filled me up without forcing me to pop the belt at the end of my meal.  That left enough room for the Panna Cotta.  It was good, but not great.  The entire dessert menu was less than inspiring, otherwise I would have given Bacco that coveted 5th star.\n\nWe did not want to drink a whole bottle of wine, so Hal suggested a specific glass for each of our meals.  This was a nice alternative to getting one bottle to match two very different meals.  Good job Hal.  I'll be sure to watch you when you appear on VH1's I Love the 00's.", "author": "Chris I."}

Perhaps I went on the worst night of the restaurant's life, but everything about this place was bad.  My dinner mate and I walked in and stood about for a good five minutes before anyone even approached us.  Though the place was almost empty, the waiter attempted to seat us next to another couple in a table arrangement befitting a cramped space -- the kind of seating where you're so close to the other people you may as well just shove the tables together.\r\n\r\nMy request to be moved to the empty side of the restaurant was met with a look of befuddlement.  \r\n\r\nThe menu was standard, nothing exciting or new.  I ordered the butternut squash ravioli, my boyfriend the pasta with bolognese sauce.  What we got were bowls of awful and even worse.  My dish was passable at best.  The ravioli was overcooked, the filling and sauce uninspired -- and the plate ungarnished.  I guess it was both a good and bad thing that there were only four or five sad, limp pieces.  Seriously?  \r\n\r\nBut at least I didn't get the bolognese sauce.  Limp pasta covered in what looked, smelled and tasted like what I imagine Hamburger Helper would taste like.  No joke.  We were both so furious we refused to finish the food on principle.  Still hungry, we went to another restaurant to eat normal food.  \r\n\r\nOur experience there was so bad that neither one of us wanted to go to an Italian restaurant for the longest time.  We still refer to that night in disgust.\r\n\r\nIf you're in the neighborhood, skip this place.  Go to La Ciccia instead.

We started with the butternut squash gnocchi with brown butter and sage sauce and it was to-die-for delicious (and I like that they split it for us in the kitchen).  For the main course, we had the duck with balsamic sauce over black rice.  It was solo amazing.  It is the rare restaurant that can get duck right (not overdone but not too rare).  And the black rice was the perfect compliment.  The duck was on the special menu so not sure how often it is available but felt very luck tonight (thank you Sherry).  Dessert was the flourless chocolate torte di Isabella (named after the owner's daughter) and it was awesome  - dense but somehow not too heavy.  The place has been rejuvenated by some new faces.  Gabriel, the manager, is knowledgable and personable and has a real passion for food and wine.  Our server, Davide, also was extremely knowledgable about food and especially wine and was perfectly attentive.  Sherry (the owner) does a nice job of checking in without being intrusive.  The place has a great vibe these days and we are so happy it continues to thrive as one of San Francisco's best neighborhood restaurants.  Salute Bacco!  P.S.  Try one of the new Super Tuscan wines.

It's a fact.  As with certain foods, pasta imo is one that is not hard to do.  How can someone mess up noodles, pasta sauce, and cheese?  Sadly I have been to establishments where this simple creation can taste like cardboard.  Never a good sign!  \n\nI first tried Bacco with a good friend a few weeks back, who was in town visiting for the weekend.  We were both pleasantly surprised when we walked into the establishment as the mood and d\u00e9cor were absolutely beautiful.  VERY classy indeed.  We were seated immediately by an individual who seemed to be the owner.  Another classy touch.  After reviewing the menu (there were many delicious sounding choices) I settled on the Rigatoni, a delightful concoction of rigatoni pasta, tomato cream sauce, bell peppers, peas, and homemade Italian sausage.  Soon after arriving, the bowl was practically licked clean!  The pasta was so delicious, and all of its ingredients were so incredibly fresh, I was more than pleased with the meal.  \n\nI liked it so much that the next time I visited Bacco, I didn't even look at the menu, knowing good and well that I wanted this particular dish again!  Mixed with excellent service, authentic and helpful staff (our waiter was very charming and Italian himself), and the freshest of fresh ingredients in every dish, Bacco is a restaurant that I will without a doubt frequent again in  what I hope is the not too distant future.", "author": "Ryan H."}

I don't know if I would have chosen this place, but I don't think my date had actually been here before.  From the outside it is a very cute location.  A tree-lined mostly residential street with well-kept Victorians, the restaurant is nestled right between a church and corner market.  It is low and flat and looks very upscale so I was glad I had dressed up a bit and not gone for  a more urban look.\nInside its got a nice d\u00e9cor.  Small but with white table cloths, yada yada.  All so good so far, but the first sign that this is no Delfina is that the crowd seemed to be from an AARP meeting.  Not to be age-ist, but I was surprised some of the diners didn't drop their dentures into their wine glasses when they were done with their meals to soak for a bit. \nOkay, so it was more my nana's crowd than mine. \nWhen we turned to the menu, it too seemed a little old-fashioned to me.  But I went with it.  My date was funny and I was happy to be on a date after a bit of a dry spell this summer. \nWe started with the calamari, which was nicely prepared. Not chewy.  It was okay.\nHe had the vermicelli with little tiny meatballs, which after some Alec Baldwin on Saturday Night Live jokes, he let me have a taste of.  Good little meatballs.  Not heavenly but good. \nI had the cod ravioli, which was pretty good.  Well-prepared but a bit under-seasoned for my taste.  \nWe briefly considered staying for the chocolate ganashe cookies with milk but I think he sensed I was underwhelmed by his choice of dinner spot and we decided to just move on to first date part two.\nOverall, I would say this is a good place to go with your parents, maybe, but I would not recommend it for first date spots if you are under 50.", "author": "Nikki K."}

Beautifully prepared food in a lovely dining room.\n\nWe shared a salad of baby arugula, radicchio, walnuts, and gorgonzola, and a pasta dish of penne with smoked salmon in a pink sauce.  We each ordered the pork with mashed potatoes and spinach.  We agreed that the pig must have led a very happy life to be so delicious.  We split a side of grilled asparagus dressed with pecorino and truffle honey.  For dessert he had the buttermilk panna cotta and I had the apple tart in puff pastry with vanilla gelato. \n\nOh, my--what a superb meal from start to finish.

I even ordered the rigatoni. It looked very inviting, an intimate and quiet setting in Noe Valley. And indeed it was, the service also being very accommodating and efficient.\n\nBut the food was altogether just solid, and not spectacular as I would have hoped. The rigatoni was actually excellent --served hot and the sauce was pleasantly flavorful and spicy. The pasta tasted wonderfully fresh and the peas, peppers and sausage were fantastic. I could taste even a hint of fennel.\n\nBut the salad --the simple greens with the balsamic dressing --was way too strong. Not the greens. Not the freshness. The dressing was both salty and strong in its flavor. It could have even used some lemon to take the edge off.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the tiramisu, which no self respecting Italian restaurant should ruin. Didn't taste fresh. It was too cold. It didn't taste enough of the espresso and it felt like a Pepperidge Farms cake creation. Clearly I have had much better. My companion's puff pastry with apples was nice and I was able to have a bite. By the way, her daily zuppe of potato/leeks was great, although she probably shouldn't have had pepper put on it.\n\nWe had the $35 prix fixe meal which was pretty cool ---1 appetizer, 1 entree, 1 dessert but some of the choices are limited. That's fine. And altogether it was pleasant but there are much better neighborhood Italian spots in the City. Want to avoid the crowds in North Beach? Then try Bacco.\n\nFinally the coffee was just so so ---it was not strong at all, it also wasn't especially hot either. The cappucino was just OK.", "author": "Alfonso L."}

I spent the weekend in the City and wanted to do Italian. As a person with celiac disease I need to make sure the restaurant has wheat free entrees. After a thoroughly disappointing meal at Pucinni & Pinetti Friday night I had a gem of a meal at Ristorante Bacco. The manager there has been gluten free for four years and understands what gluten free means. The waitress was wonderful and could explain exactly what was in every item and which ones I could eat, which ones they could modify, and which ones I couldn't eat. \nThe restaurant is in Noe Valley, but easy to get to, particularly if you happen to be out in Golden Gate Park. It has nice decor with cloth tablecloths. The wine menu is diverse Italian wines.\nI had the whipped salt cod with polenta as an antipasti. It was great. For the main course I had a lot of different gluten free pastas and sauces to choose from, but I decided on that night's special of shrimp and risotto in saffron. That was just phenomenal. The cherry on the cake? They make their own gluten free bread. Gluten free diners know what this means because we can usually just stare at the bread bowl.\nThe non gluten free diners in my party thought their meal was as good as it gets. They raved about the stuffed calamari ( was told I couldn't have because vegetable stuffing was made with wheat) and the meatballs. They had different pastas with seafood and meat sauce respectively and the sauces were to die for.\nThe bottom line here was my guests thought the meal was as good as they have had hands down. From a gluten free perspective where you expect you have to give a little when you can't have wheat (particularly at an Italian restaurant), there was no compromise. The manager told me it is not uncommon for a gluten free diner to give him a hug after the meal in gratitude for the meal. I don't know why everyone doesn't give him a hug. The meal was fantastic.", "author": "J H."}

Now, I should preface this by saying that I was surrounded by great friends and good wine, which automatically makes any experience enjoyable. That said, I think that even without the good company the food would still have been good. \n\nI'm a big risotto fan and after hearing about their risottos, I assumed that that's what I would order. But I couldn't resist the sound of the black truffle gnocchi with fontina sauce, which was amazing. All of my friends' pastas looked good, too. One rebel ordered a meat dish, which was also very good. And another person ordered a fish dish, which came with swordfish and another kind of fish that I can't remember. That was also very good. \n\nThey loose a star for the dessert, which didn't quite live up to my expectations. I have the philosophy that if you're not having dessert, there's no point in even eating, so it's an important part of the meal. The apple tart was actually pretty disappointing. It was too much pastry and too little apple or caramel. Perhaps I should have went with the chocolate.... \n\nThe service was adequate, I thought. They only had one bottle left of the wine we ordered, so when we wanted a second bottle, the waiter gave us a great recommendation in the same price range. \n\nOverall, I'm glad we went but with all of the possibilities in the city, I doubt I'll be back.

Everyone was fairly crazy for it, so I got very excited about trying the place!  My family and I went here last night for dinner and although a nice experience, I don't know if I would rave about it.  \n\nThe ambiance as you drive up is great; there are two large Eucalyptus tress in front lit up for the season (I think.  And sadly, the two trees are potentially going to be replaced by new trees.).  The restaurant seating area is nice and it wasn't too loud.  We got the Polenta and Bacco salad to start.  Isn't polenta supposed to be creamy and not gritty?  In any case, it had good flavoring.  Then came our entrees.  My Aunt got the fregola which she inhaled - luckily, we got a taste in before it was gone, and I think my sister and I thought it was nicely spicy and tasty.  I got the crab tagliolini special which was quite lovely.  My sister got the rigatoni which was served perfectly al dente and had a nice sauce.\n\nFor dessert, we shared a Tiramisu and the Apple Tart.  Definitely get the apple tart - very tasty!  The Tiramisu was ok, but just didn't compare to the apple tart.\n\nOverall, a good experience (although my sister obviously hated the glass of wine they had suggested and they didn't take note or offer to exchange it with something else).

I had the pappardelle, my boyfriend had the rigatoni, and we split a side of the brussel sprouts.  We also both had a glass of primitivo.  The bread is really good too!  I would come back just for the bread, but the pastas and brussel sprouts left me wanting to come back as it was just that good.\n\nLuckily though the owners redeemed themselves in the end of making us wait forever and a day for our table as they comped the wine!  It was very nice and professional for them to automatically do that without us having to verbally complain to them about the wait so at least they were paying attention!  I gave them the benefit of the doubt since it was busy, but definitely give them props for not having to be told that we were waiting a ridiculously long time for our table.", "author": "Kelley P."}

Have been dining there since they first opened about 10 years ago. Have watched their beautiful daughter grow into a beautiful young woman. Have tried just about everything on the menu and the food is consistently well prepared and tasty. Their fresh bread is amazing. I love pasta so the risotto and the rigatoni are among my favorites. The dishes are generous. For the first time ever last night, I was able to eat my entire rigatoni dinner it was so good. I usually take some home for lunch. My partner is a meat eater and enjoys the vitella veal and also the ravioli. We always start with the little gem salad. We never eat desserts, but tried the meyer lemon curd with butter crust. Toes were curling in joy shortly thereafter. The Italian waiters are well trained and attentive. Even the support servers like Rafael are friendly and make you feel at home. And the decore and atmosphere will help transport you back to Italy. Buon Appetito!", "author": "Nick P."}

We also happened to see the restaurant featured on Check Please Bay area. We went on a Monday night, and called ahead for reservation. Hostess was wonderful , we were seated promptly and were actually surprised the place was packed. \n\nThe restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere, low level lighting and \"cozy\". even with the paver tile floors the place was not that noisy. \nThe service here is just outstanding. The hostess, bus boy, and waiter could not have been better. \n\nThe food on the other hand is just OK. We both ordered the Bacco Salad which was good. Toasted walnuts with arugula, radicchio and blue cheese with balsamic dressing was very good. The main courses we ordered were the Veal, and the Pasta with shrimp and porcini mushrooms. The Veal was on the bland side. the pasta looked and tasted more like a chow mein..way too salty and I think the porcini was on vacation that night as it never made an appearance on the plate. \n\nThe wine selection is interesting. All Italian wines, but hey it's an Italian restaurant, but no wines under $36 (1 bottle at that price) and the rest ranging from $40 to $175? (I don't think so!). We ordered a dry white wine at the suggestion of the waiter and it was actually a good choice with the meal but still pricey... \n\nDesserts are all priced at $8. We ordered a tiramisu and the puff pastry apple tart with the house ice cream. The tiramisu was just OK, but the Apple Tart (Oh my god), it was wonderful... \n\nOverall the food is just so so except for that apple tart. \nPrices are way to high for what you are getting. \nThe restaurant needs to revamp their wine list and make it more affordable.. \n\nAll together it was pleasant but there are much better neighborhood Italian spots in the City at half the price...", "author": "Jim R."}

The service was very good (though I do wonder whether our waiter's italian accent was real or not).  The menu reads well and features a broad range of selections and prices with a nice list of daily specials..  I really enjoyed my veal piccata entree and the veal special my mom ordered was good as well though.  But that's where things start to switch to the bad.\n\nAs an appetizer I ordered the special Crostino which featured eggplant and an olive tapenade with onions.  I think there might have been one piece of eggplant skin on there but mostly it was just an oily mess of onions and capers.  For dessert I had the chocolate cake which was entirely average.  Both the appetizer and entree were about 2/3 the size they should have been.\n\nIn terms of price, for what I ate it was expensive.  To start, I think the menu on the web site is old and everything was a buck or two more expensive.  I did like the fixed price option of an app, entree, and dessert for $35.  But after adjusting for the veal choice it was $37 which is too much for a bad appetizer and average dessert.\n\nI won't rule out a return to Bacco but I'm not exactly sure what circumstances would lead to it.  It's too expensive to be just an average evening neighborhood dinner but not nice enough to warrant any special occasion.", "author": "Jay W."}

I thought for a minute this must be a joke.  Then I ordered the most expensive plate on the menu, the flank steak ($28).  When my entree arrived, I was mesmerized. It looked like a big taco, but when I bit into it, I realized we should have gone to a taco truck instead of this place.  The food was bland and lacked seasoning.  the salad was like out of a salad bag from trader joes. As I stared at my meal, and stared at my lady, and realized this could possibly be our worst meal ever, I had to laugh out loud -- literally LOL!!

The service also was not the best- while the waiters were attentive up to the ordering- my water glass was often empty and while we may lingered after paying as it was a get together and were the last ones in the restaurant- the waiters had already left and the bus boys were sitting waiting for us to leave near the door.  Very odd feeling...didn't feel especially like a friendly neighborhood place.\n\nThe bread and olive oil tasted really good to me as i was pretty starving upon arrival- which was a good start- possibly my best part of the meal.  Split the calamari appetizer that was good, but not great or especially flavorful.  My pasta which the waiter recommended-parpardelle with tomato lamb sauce- was average- as in is this really homemade and not overcooked because i can get better pasta at pasta gina next door and make it at home better than this- and i'm no chef. ( I also have grown up eating homemade pasta dishes)  I am going to write it off though, since my dinnermates both liked their dishes. My wine was a chianti- better than the other two wines being drank at my table- which doesn't make me feel good about the wine by the glass selection.  The tiramisu was so so- i can be a little picky since this was my favorite dessert as a child and have tried hundreds of versions.\n\nThe tables are very close together and they have paper tablecloths on top of the regular tablecloths- which seems to contradict the ambiance- which is otherwise quite cozy, slightly upscale and date-like.  The waiters did seem like they spoke italian and had thick accents (from somewhere).

We started with the burrata, which came with parma ham, olives and arugula -- delicious.  I ordered the papardelle with a tomato lamb sauce (chunks of tender lamb vs. a ragu).  Also delicious.  BF had the gnocci with truffle oil, which he seemed to enjoy.  Service was excellent.  The server was also very generous with the cheese and fresh pepper -- I wish all italian restaurants were like that.  Will definitely dine here again!", "author": "Mitzi C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2005-08-24", "description": "Bacco is the cozy, neighborhoody kind of restaurant that everyone wants around the block from them. Prices are a little higher than I'd like (~$7.50 for salads and $15 for pasta), but with the dearth of decent and flavorful Italian food these days, I'll take it. \r\nI sampled the Bacco salad which consisted of radicchio, arugula, gorgonzola, walnuts and balsamic vinaigrette. It was simple, the cheese was top notch, strong and ripe enough but not over powering, but overall, was not a salad that I would drive across town for.  I had the gnocchi w/ lamb sugo. The lamb sauce was good, the meat not too dry, and gnocchi themselves were the stars of the plate. They were very tender and lighter than the gnocchi that come out of my kitchen, yum. I also tried a dish with small roasted clams and small grain sized pasta in a brothy tomato saffron sauce. This was surprisingly flavorful. A few of the clams were gritty ( a bit unappealing in an establishment in this price range) but I would order this again. Also tried some raviolis with a brown butter sauce. The raviolis were a smaller but adequate portion while the other 2 dishes were more than enough. \r\nOverall, a comfortable place with attentive service and simple hearty fare. I would like to see more options in the lower price range of light red wines on their list. I think we split the lightest and cheapest red which was about $36. If possible, I would give it 3.75 stars.", "author": "Candice L."}

The seared duck was a bit over cooked and the two dishes we ordered were served with batchoy (Asian vegetable)?  It didn't seem right for some reason.  I did enjoy the desserts (the apple thing and the espresso with gelato) and the freshness of the pasta in a few of the dishes we tried.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-12-28", "description": "Of all the Italian restaurants in Noe Valley, Bacco fairs well among the pack, but suffers the same syndrome plaguing other places: inattentive waiters. \n\nThat is not to say Bacco is a terrible place. The decor is nicely done -- a combination of dim lighting, wooden rustic chairs, and spongy yellows walls create the perfect mood for intimate dining. But, at times, the table set-up is a little too personal, since seating is squashed tightly together. Hearing loud conversations two tables down is a jarring reminder that anything you say will reverberate clearly off the walls. In the future, let's hope Bacco pries open some elbowroom for the comfort of their guests.  \n\nInspired by the cuisine of Northern Italy, Bacco's menu boasts a healthy selection of pasta and meat dishes. Braised lamb, seared chicken, gnocchi, porkchops -- all the standard American-Italian dishes you've come to love is priced affordably, ranging from $15 for pasta to $35 for beef dishes. But judging from the reviews posted near their front door, what people really love is their made-to-order risotto. A painstakingly tedious process, risottos take anywhere from 25 to 40 minutes, its ingredients demanding a fastidious chef to stir constantly, ensuring the rice doesnt burn. On their menu, a little disclaimer warns that the risotto isn't a fast dish, but a dish that requires at least thirty minutes to prepare. Incredulously, when I received my risotto, it took not the minimum time, but a short 15 minutes! Perhaps it's not made-to-order, after all.  Sadly, the risotto wasn't as tasty as the reviews claimed. The rice was soft and moist, but lacked the necessary flavor to pull my attention. There's a bit of TLC in there, but it needs more work to live up to its hype. At least the bread and gnocchi was good!\n\nThe waiters and the host, though, need a lot of improvement. Slow to meet our needs, our waiter was consistently lazy and absent from the table. It took us a long time to make our order and to close the check. Plus, he botched our order of espresso, forgetting to include it with the desert. When we had asked the host to give us more olive oil, she kindly nodded with a gesture of acknowledgement, then walked away.  Ten minutes later and still no oil. Bacco wasn't even bustling with activity, so there should be no excuse for this type of poor service! To its credit, only the bus boy was helpful, often coming to the table pouring drinks and asking if we needed any help. The tip we left should be given to him, not the waiter.\n\nI wouldnt go out of my way to eat at Bacco again. While the food is somewhat satisfying, the wait staff murders any desire to go back.", "author": "Richard L."}

But the gem of the night was the fregola! I am not much into seafood, esp mussels and clams but the way all that flavored the \"Sardinian cousin of couscous\" was AMAZING! Apparently, fregola (FREG-o-la) is made from semonina mixed with water, formed into pellets and dried. It is a grain and looks kinda like poofier corn kernels or giant couscous grains.

We all like to eat well and don't mind paying a premium for an excellent meal.  Two in our party had the risotto, which was pretty tasteless.  One person had the mahi mahi special.  The fish was so overcooked as to be unrecognizable.  My braised boar on polenta was the only tasty main course, but it was no better than the braised beef I can do myself.  The appetizers were similarly disappointing.\n\nThe service was enthusiastic but amateurish.  The waiter cleared 3 of the 4 appetizer plates before the last person had finished.  Then, the next instant, he appeared with the main courses.  The person still working on her appetizer had to shove it aside to make way for her main course.  We felt like the waiter couldn't wait to get rid of us so he could go home.

I had one of the specials, the Panko crusted sauteed trout.  It was served on a bed of raw arugula and delicious sliced oranges.  It was fileted so that I had NO bones.  The panko crust was delicious - just the right crunch, and the fish was perfectly butterflied before saute-ing so that I could easily eat the fish without the skin.  The arugula and oranges were the perfect complement to this simple yet delicious dish.  I had it with my favorite Bacco white wine by the glass, La Segreta.", "author": "margot g."}

They served one to each of us and it was plenty.\nSecond course the Salmone - which was yummy smoked salmon with a lot of lemon, olive oil & fennel.  It was very good.\n\nEntree - husband had the special risotto which was risotto with I believe four different types of cheese.  It was cooked perfectly and the flavor was great.  However it was just a dish of risotto and could have used some in season vegetable or something.  But he ate it all and he knew what he was ordering, so no complaints.\n\nThe reason I am giving the restaurant a 3?  My entree of short ribs, which was really just the rib - hardly and meat and what meat I had was more fat than meat.  The gnocchi that came with it was great.  Although disappointed with the ribs, I would like to try this place again and maybe order pasta which looked very good at the table next to us.  However, so did another order of short ribs that was so loaded with meat you could barely see any bones on their plate...\n\nDessert - chocolate cake, it was good but nothing spectacular.\n\nWill definitely try again and the little take out place next door was great!", "author": "Mick .."}

The pasta was amazing. My fiance and I went there one night and had two appetizers, two main courses and a their tirimasu which was outstanding all under $100.  To top it off we also brought in two bottle's of wine. I know we're wino's. All that was included in the price. Great bang for your buck. Not bad considering how much food we had and how great the quality was.\n\nSo if your ever in the mood to escape the North Beach cluster, come enjoy some Bacco.", "author": "Aaron W."}

I swear I was ready to stab him after he stepped on my Kors wedges for the 28th time. third and final strike: delicate metrosexual portions, which were perfectly suitable for me, but not for the Norse god across from me who needs a flamin buffet table piled to the ceiling with food.\n\nI loved the decor and the whole restaurant is charming. boyfriend doesn't pay attention to such things. as long as an eatery doesn't reek of piss or shit, he is a happy boy. he looks at the menu and right away declares, everything is a la carte. uh-huh, yeah so, it's not a foreign concept to us, it's just that we avoid places like that. if it ain't family-style, we don't partake very often. well the man is quite hungry so he orders 2, yes TWO, apps (salad and calamari). I ordered the exquisite polenta, mmmm, it's a meal by itself. I choose the lamb and boyfriend gets the veal. both dishes were lovely and flavorful (mind you, boyfriend eats half of my plate). tonight was boyfriend's turn to foot the bill but surprise of surprises, he forgot to bring his credit card. darlings, this is not the first time this has happened and it will not be the last. we had a nice bottle of red to accompany dinner and their wine list is by no means meager. or cheap, for that matter. final tally: more than $130 and the Incredible Bulk isn't even full !!! this doesn't mean I will never come back, not at all. but next time I will be with someone with a more normal appetite and less of a hippo stomach.", "author": "Prima D."}

I have been going to Bacco for years, even rediscovered it at one point, and have found myself drawn to it almost weekly of late.  The food is, in a word, fantastic.  I feel transported back to Italy with their fresh pastas, perfectly balanced sauces and interesting assortment of appetizers, meats and other frequently changing specials.

We wanted cozy comfort food after a long weekend of drinking and with the cold weather. We'd skipped lunch so we were able to sneak in without a reservation since we were pulling the senior special with a 5:40pm dinner.  The olive oil they bring out with the bread is really delicious, hard to resist. We started with the burrata platter which was fabulous - olives, proscuitto, arugula, and olive oil. It all tasted really rich and fresh. Then my husband had the stuffed breaded veal chop which was so flavorful and perfectly cooked. He cleaned the plate! I had the farro spaghetti dish with bolognese and fresh ricotta. It was really wonderful, exactly what I was craving. We were mentally comparing it to Incanto since we were there last Sunday night, they're both in Noe Valley, and we ordered somewhat similar things. I decided they're tied in my book based on our first two meals - we were super happy with both from environment to food to everything. Also for how fabulous the food was I don't understand comments on it being overpriced here - we were laying off the wine and shared an appetizer, which helped, but all in all with tip we got out of there for $68 I think, and were stuffed and super happy!!! Give it a go if you want original, perfectly made Italian - not the same old lasagna and chicken parm you find at the Mom and Pop places but not the overly California-ized menus you find at places trying too hard to be different!", "author": "Sarah R."}

I can't count how many good things I've heard about Ristorante Bacco, so I was stunned at how poor it was. At first I was impressed since they seated us right away and the food smelled great. But it went downhill fast! First off nobody took our order for 30 mins, the wine list was small, and the blue cheese on the \"Bacco\" salad tasted like the Safeway select version. The pasta special was solid if not spectacular as was the stuffed chicken, though the actual meat portion was a little small. The risotto special was so creamy I could feel my arteries hardening as I ate. I'm not a great cook but I can make better risotto than that and with better presentation (though admittedly I have been picking up tips from Food TV). The risotto had a lump of crab meat in the middle and a few sprigs of asparagus. To top it off, the risotto was a steep $30. There's way better homey Italian places in San Francisco so I won't waste my time going back to Bacco.", "author": "Keith R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-01-01", "description": "My husband and I chose Bacco for a special New Year's dinner based on Yelp and Trip Advisor reviews, and even though they'd led us to expect a lot, we were more than satisfied. We were initially seated next to a loud family group with little kids -- not our idea of romantic dinner ambiance. When I asked if anything else was available, the owner relocated us to one of the best tables for two in the house, which we greatly appreciated. The service from there on through the server and the person who filled our water and olive oil was worth the five stars alone -- friendly and super-attentive but not intrusive. Our server suggested an excellent and reasonably-priced \"Italian Chardonnay\" that we both loved. We ordered from the list of New Year's specials: short ribs with gnocchi and tagiolini with Dungeness crab. DH thought the short ribs were slightly fatty but was blown away by the gnocchi; I practically licked my plate clean. The tiramisu was the perfect ending. Overall, we felt that the dishes weren't trying to be anything other than simply great food -- there was a refreshing lack of pretension. The ambiance was warm with just the right lighting for a special dinner a deux, too. Another plus is that the neighborhood is cute, and the walk down Diamond St. to Market, though long and precariously steep in spots, affords some awesome views.", "author": "Amy G."}

In my opinion, it is the place in SF to eat if you want a high quality Italian dinner cooked in an authentic way at a fair price.  Not cheap but fair.  It is not pretentious. The staff is professional but friendly. They love families and kids. The setting is beautiful and at the same time comfortable.  The  risotto is  incredible. All of the pasta dishes are prepared with care. The fish is super fresh and simply but lovingly prepared. Their best fish dish is  sand dabs. Hard to find in the city. A must if they offer it as a special.  The buratta melts in your mouth. While they will not regularly offer a ceasar salad- as it is not an authentic  italian dish- when they choose to offer it, it is fantastic like all of their  salads.  Fresh. Great flavor. Not over dressed. Their grilled hen is flavorful. Terrific Brussels sprouts!  Very thoughtful and fairly priced wine list. A revelation in SF where most places rip you off on the vino. While all the desserts are tasty, stick with simple: gelato with espresso poured on top. Many places offer affogato, few succeed. Their version is a killer combo. Give this place a try. You won't be sorry.", "author": "Steve H."}

A lot of neighborhood restaurants aren't really destinations worth dealing with the drive, parking, etc...  This place is different.  \n\nI went to Bacco with my girlfriend and another couple.  It was perfect.  Cool waiter with a great Italian accent.  Charming hostess.  And good food.  We had the gnocci with black truffle butter, fregola with fresh clams, mussels, prawn, scallops, tomato and saffron, tonnarelli with tiger prawn, pancetta, porcini mushrooms and arugula, and the risotto, which changes daily.  Mine was with scallops and safron.  I tasted everything.  The gnocci was fluffy and rich.  Fregola also had very good flavor.  I had no idea fregola meant delicious little balls of pasta, but there you go.  The best thing though was probably the tonnarelli.  The only reason this place wasn't 5 stars was my risotto, which was cooked well but a little bland.  After the chowhound reviews I was a little disappointed.  Overall, very good pasta.  Sizeable portions and well-executed flavors.  Will probably not blow you away, but you'll be very satisfied with the meal.  We all were.\n\nFor dessert we had the mango and raspberry panna cotta and the tiramisu.  They make all their desserts in-house as well.
