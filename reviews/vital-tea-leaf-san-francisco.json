We had a little over an hour before we had to part ways and wanted to spend some time together (I'm visiting from out of town). I was unfamiliar with this establishment but after we sat down the man behind the bar explained that they sell tea to take home and give tastings at the bar. My friend shops there regularly and told us she sits at the bar for hours so we were good to hang out for a bit, but after we were there for around an hour, the man behind the bar got really nasty with us. He came over--clearly very angry--and said with venom: \"It's really hard to explain the tea while you are sitting over here talking! We are not a cafe where people sit and hang out!\" At this point there were about 15-20 people sitting a long the bar and there was a general chatter of conversation throughout the place and we were talking and laughing in normal voices. We had absolutely no idea we were doing anything wrong. It was jarring and upsetting to be handled so aggressively. We are respectful people and if he had said something earlier in a nice way, like: \"hey guys would you mind talking quietly so I can explain the tea.\" Or \"hey guys we generally prefer people to only sit her for 15-20 minutes.\" We would have immediately and respectfully obliged. But this man said nothing until he angrily blew up at us. I had been planning on buying tea as a gift to take home, but instead I felt chased out by a man full of vitriol.", "author": "Tara T."}

If likely have bought more than one tea had I been willing to spend a little more money.  However, I chose my favorite one (I would reccommend the Jasmine silver needle tea to anyone), but I feel reassured that I can go on-line and order whatever tea I desire and have it shipped to me here in Chicago!!!\n\nThe average price of the tea is around  $20, though you can find some pretty pricy ones.  Before you make your decision however, sit down and try some - the lady who helped us was so friendly and eager to have us try the different flavors.  Point one out that you want to try, and they'll steep it right in front of you.  The lovely lady also provided us with a short lesson in the proper way to clean and steep tea!

This experience was very educational and informative. I learned a lot about loose leaf teas and was very pleased with all of the samples we tried. I requested a tea that would be good for boosting the immune system and was given a sample of green angel. I ended up buying a canister of it because I enjoyed it so much. Our lovely tea maker even included a tea strainer for free with my tea purchase. She was very knowledgable and enjoyable to learn from. I wish I would have gotten her name, but all staff at Vital Tea Leaf seem equally friendly, helpful and knowledgable.

It's a pity because this place could be a gem that helps people discover great loose leaf tea. \n\nI'm a huge tea drinker, to the point of traveling to find the best teas, but couldn't bring myself to stay in here for more than two minutes because of this guy's unbearable rudeness to every customer. \n\nTea is an intimidating beverage as it is - you have to be friendly and accommodating with people in order to make it accessible.

She so crazy. \n\nI waited outside in the sun as I had managed to spill ice cold water all over myself twice on the drive there. The tea place was filled with white people and I texted my bf that it looks like a tourist trap and asked him to Yelp it. 4 stars. \n\nI drink tea every morning but I didn't get to this morning because we were supposed to leave at 10:30 and I woke up at 11:30 and we didn't leave until noon. Haha. We had some extra time to kill so we sat down and instantly this guy starts talking to us. The main guy was still talking to all the tourists. The guy serving us kept spewing out some hard core Mandarin and I had my mother translate every 15 seconds. Haha. \n\nHe asked what kind of tea I wanted and I said Oolong. He told me he had tons and I told him I wanted the strongest and darkest one they had. He let us try two. One was too bitter and the other too sweet. I am seriously through with Oolong after 6+ negative Oolong experiences. At least this one was free. \n\nMy mother was eyeing some white pearl tea and he let us try that too. It was okay. They he forced (in the nicest and funniest way possible) some Ginseng tea on us. Horrible. I've always hated Ginseng tea. My mother and I barely drank it and he kept pour cups of it. Haha. \n\nWe ended up buying 1/4 pound of Baby Chrysanthemum for $20. He said he was giving us extra but I have no idea if he just says that to everyone to make it seem like we're getting a good deal. Either way when I opened the bag, it was completely packed. I'm glad it tasted great since we didn't try it in stores and I hated all the other teas we tasted. \n\nThe whole experience was super fun. We had a blast trying all the teas and the guy helping us was really nice and funny. Not once did he pressure us into buying anything. Not even a hint!

Tasting is free, and you are welcome to stay for as long as you like, and you are not obliged to buy anything.  Each time I come, I stay at least an hour!\n\nIf you're new to tea, come with an open mind.  The Chinese staff are very direct--they will tell you what is quality and what is not, with little sugar-coating.  That's part of the fun; they're so discerning and passionate about their tea brewing, and they want to make sure their customers leave with a new understanding of tea.   Even if they poke some fun at your favorite sweet tea (I live in Texas, sometimes I enjoy a good sweet tea), they really are kind people trying to give you a new experience.  \n\nIf you're serious about tea (and a fan of light schadenfreude), enjoy the knowledgeable staff interrogate clueless tourists about how they drink their 5-minute brewed lipton, with quips like, \"You put milk or sugar in, you're fired!\"  \n\nIf you get to meet Uncle G, it's your lucky day.  He's a riot.  He travels to China each year to buy the best tea and bring it back to his stores.\n\nPrices may appear steep (with some White teas at $180 per pound), but you can easily ask for $20 worth of tea, for example.  Since tea is so light, $20 worth of tea can actually last a few months!  Don't be scared by the weight price--buying in bulk is actually cheaper, and loose-leaf will always give you the best quality.", "author": "Ann K."}

Actually, her daughter was looking for an entirely different tea place, but as it was getting late and she wasn't quite sure where it was, we passed by and decided to try this place instead.\n\nUpon entering, we were immediately invited to sit at the counter and sample several of their teas.  We were first served a white jasmine (per my friend's request), in a clear glass pitcher.  Watching the little tealeaf balls unfold was almost as good an experience as the tea itself, which was quite tasty.\n\nThe guy was friendly and knowledgeable, explaining the supposed benefits of each tea.  I take these benefit explanations with a grain of salt, having worked in pharmaceutical companies for years and knowing there is no real physical evidence that any of these teas actually do what the salesperson might say.  Next time I will ask exactly how much I need to drink and how often to actually feel any benefits.\n\nStill, the entertainment value of the server, his salespitch, and the taste of the tea itself was well worth the experience.  Especially good was the \"milk oolong\" tea, which is irrigated with milk before being harvested and picks up the aroma, and once brewed, does indeed taste like milk is already added.\n\nIt's obvious that the servers are well-trained by good businessmen, because many of these teas are quite expensive sold by the pound (one canister of some type of \"goddess\" tea was listed at 800 dollars per pound!).  But he immediately started making a comparison to buying a cup of Starbucks every day, saying that you would ultimately spend more, because a pound of tea lasts longer.  He might be correct on this, but to me it was just another part of the salespitch.\n\nNevertheless, the product sold itself, and I was happy to purchase the milk oolong purely for the taste.  Also recommended is the \"blue people\" tea, and the ginseng varieites, which are a bit less expensive.", "author": "Paul W."}

I can thank these people for my current tea obsession. This is a place where you can come and learn all about the different Chinese teas. \n\nKeep in mind this is NOT a place where you come to buy a cup of tea. They sell loose leaf tea, high quality loose leaf tea and sample the teas for you. If there is something that you want to try, just ask. Every time I come here I spend about an hour to an hour and a half sampling different teas. The average, I'd say, is probably 15-30 minutes for people that come in there.\n\nThey are very personable people, but they do take tea seriously. In a way they are inviting you into their home and to learn about their culture. Treat them with respect and come with an open attitude you'll have a great experience. \n\nOne thing to note: Mint is NOT a tea! Mint is an herb that can be infused with water. I once saw an argument transpire between a customer and the owner about her desire for \"Mint Tea.\" He attempted to explain to her that Mint is not a tea, tea is a specific plant. She insisted that Mint is a tea and that she has had it before and that he was wrong. After about 10 minutes back and forth he told her to leave the store and return when she wanted to learn about tea.\n\nDon't let this discourage you from coming here, you won't find a better place to get indoctrinated in tea. Different teas are good for different conditions too...so if you are prone to something, like acid reflux, let them know they might have something to help.

Our host walked us through different types of tea, explained what they're made of, relative caffeine content, and how they compare to the other tea we would be tasting.  He also explained how various teas are best served, how many times you can reuse certain tea leaves, and what teas are good remedies for what conditions.  When we were finished, I stood up and nearly fell over immediately.  I never realized you could get a buzz off tea, but I flew out of there that afternoon.\n\nVital Tea Leaf gets points for originality, customer service (our host was very engaging), selection (hundreds of different teas available to taste and purchase) and location.\n\nThey lose points for value.  That's right, kids, don't think you're going to walk in there, taste all this amazing tea, and walk out without buying anything.  And the tea there is expensive - much of it upwards of $100/lb.

I cannot eat any type of Asian food without tea, it's just not right without it!  But I don't particularly LIKE tea, and therefore don't know anything about it.  After visiting Vital Tealeaf, I realized that I actually like tea quite a bit, it's just that I have been drinking crap teas my whole life!  \n\nI have to also agree that the staff here is AWESOME!  I actually went to the 905 Grant St location, and Jason took great care of us!  Initially when we sat down, he told us that we had 5 different teas to taste.  But once we started talking, Jason brought out at least 5 more teas for us to try.  And I have to say, I learned ALOT about tea from Jason!  It is really great to talk to people about things that they are passionate about.  I asked a zillion questions, and Jason knows his stuff.  He definitely makes the subject of tea INTERESTING!  \n\nI wish I wasn't so broke, or I definitely would have bought some of the great teas that Vital Tealeaf has.  My friend bought some Angel green tea (Jason's favorite!) which we drank the next morning.  Somehow it didn't taste the same, but I think you have to get used to brewing good tea the correct way to get the right taste.  I also love the names of the teas--Blue People Ginseng, Ginger Pine (which is neither ginger nor pine--is this just to confuse the white people?).  \n\nFYI they also sell their teas online.  While the teas are expensive, you can use one serving of tea to make 5 cups.  So it will last a while.  And you can store tea for several years!

After coming here my eyes were opened to real tea. The flavors of all the teas are amazing. I'm liking it more than coffee now. My first visit I got Ginseng Oolong or more popularly known as Blue People. Drink it in the morning and usually feel better than when I drink coffee.

If you don't believe me, try it when you go (as soon as you step through the door their brewing you tea to try) and then try to find it anywhere else.\n\nVital tea leaf seems to be family run and is one of two tea shops that this family owns and operates within a few blocks of each other (I guess business is booming). I wouldn't rely too much on their knowledge of tea in general though, most of what they have to say involves you either losing weight or curing your hangover. \n\nHowever, as I said, the teas themselves are outrageously good.

Otherwise I felt it would warrant a 5.  DO NOT come into Vital Tea Leaf unless you're planning on spending money.  We went to the nearby fortune cookie factory and saw a sign.  Everyone in my party loves tea, so we all figured it'd be an experience...and it was.\n\nThe free tasting was great, and \"Uncle Gee\" is certainly a man with lots of charisma.  He spouts Chinese Wisdom like it's his job, and sells tea like no one I've ever seen.  Everyone tastes all kinds of different teas...and most of them are absolutely delicious.  I can't vouch for the truth in his description of each tea.  I'm not sure how much the bitter tea helps to lower cholesterol, but I do know that there is SOME truth to Chinese usage of herbs.  \n\nSo, after he gets to know you and pretends like you're a member of his \"family,\" he starts the sales push.  The funny thing is that at the end of the 45 minute tasting ordeal, you're eating out of his hand.  \"What should we be getting?\" wondered a member of my party.  \"Well, I really liked the Blue People\" countered her husband.  \"Oh, so I guess that'll be a quarter pound of Blue People?  No need to get the Ginseng Oolong if you're getting that.  [tone lowers] Yes, that's $120 per pound.\" says Uncle Gee.  Four teas later and you walk out having spent $150 on tea.  \n\nHighly overpriced?  I don't know...I'm not that much of a tea connoisseur.  At least that's what the people at Vital Tea Leaf made me feel like (\"You drink from the bag?  Don't even speak to me...\").  Still, the experience was worth it.

The milk tea was a bit odd and neither of use really enjoyed it that much, although it was still nice to be able to taste it at least once.  \n\nOverall we tried about 8 different teas and although the tea seems a bit expensive, since they teach you how to get the most out of your purchase (how much to brew, the best way to maximize flavor with a little tea, and which ones you can reuse), and it's risk-free since you get to taste it first for free and buy only what you like, its worth it.

I can guess that the average Westerner without a strong knowledge of tea can gain a good, friendly introduction to the tea and also watch as he skillfully convinces skeptical tourists to relax for some tea tasting (and sales, no doubt). The salesmanship on display is almost worth the price of the tea alone. I sat and sipped while hearing him literally shouting at people to get their ass in and try some tea. After spotting a Ten-Ren tea package, he and his salesman convinced a party of 5 to come in, offered to buy the cheap tea, then brewed it in front of them for a comparison taste-test against the house Jasmine tea.\n\nIt was an experience I am glad that I did not miss, although I did end up spending a pretty penny on tea. I didn't once feel that I was being ripped off or sold really hard on the tea. You can't walk into this place as a tourist and think that you're somehow getting a price-sensitive experience.

It makes some delighted and others furious, but it makes all who go there have strong feelings and a powerful experience, and for that alone I recommend it. \n\nI like going here and I bring friends often. It is fun and a real unusual experience. I cherish that. I am not very knowledgeable about tea, though I have been learning more recently. I purchased the Blue Tea believing it was a green tea, and after comparing the leaves of the tea to the pictures of gynotstemma, I have to agree that it appears I did not buy tea at all. So be it. I paid $20 for a 1/4 pound of herbal infusion, information about tea (some correct, some not) and a really great time. It was $20 well spent and I drink my Blue \"Tea\" daily.\n\nI highly recommend going to Vital Tea and experiencing what they offer. Accept that much of what they say is story telling and that is great. If you really want to learn about tea, do some research. If you just want to have some fun, go there. And buy a little tea while your there...$15 will get an occasional tea drinker enough for months and it will only be a few dollars more than down the street. After you experience Vital Tea, and you have done a little research, you can go somewhere where the prices are better but the service is not as good. \n\nI totally understand TeaPot's and Hitomi's frustration, but it would be really nice if some of the \"better\" or more honest tea places learned from Vital Tea and started providing more service to the tea newbies.

Despite Uncle Gee putting me in the dungeon multiple times and Johnny saying all sorts of crazy stuff about genitalia...I keep coming back. I don't know where they find these people but they are freaking crazy, and wildly entertaining. One of the top ten things to do for free in San Francisco. Thank you guys for all the tea and good times.", "author": "Tim B."}

We ran across this place and he had to stop in because obviously he's a fan of tea. The staff was extremely funny and friendly. A great place to meet people from all over. You could tell they were targeting the tourists to come into the shop. It was a fun experience and we drank our tea and left. They didn't seem happy that we left without buying anything, but whatever. I mean, your sign says, \"Free Tea\" and you were persistent for us to come in and sit. Don't be mad, you brought this upon yourself! Ha! However, the experience was fun and memorable so when I go back I'll buy some tea if I need some, sure who cares, just because they are so friendly. Why not? I'd rather pay more for tea there than some boring place. The claims they make about certain teas being good for particular stuff like smoking, heavy drinking, etc. I don't really think has any merit. Yet, I'll agree that tea has its benefits over soda any day of the week. Anyway, fun place, good experience, good tea, and great for tourists.", "author": "Matt M."}

I went in, and sat down and Uncle Gee made me try all these wonderful teas, one after the other. teaching us of their properties, why you brew them the way they do, the history, the 5 types, and all that good stuff. I was so much fun, and Ive enevr left that store without a new tea in hand. This was October of 2007, and since then Ive gone back countless times, and I feel like its almost a home away from home at the tea shop.\nIve brought over 40 people to that shop, and everyone has loved the experience. From getting tea samples from Ming to talking to Uncle Gee and Jin, every visit was worth the trek into chinatown.\n\ni strongly recommend this place to anyone and everyone! :)", "author": "Joanna Y."}
