The brioche bread was delicious. Everyone at the office enjoyed their sando + salad!\n\nSterling, the owner of Mission Picnic kindly delivered our order this morning. Delivery was flawless and on time (in fact a few minutes early) which fit perfectly with my schedule. \n\nHere's what I ordered (delivered today 5/23)\n\nDevil's Egg\nmarket egg salad, bacon crumbles, melted provolone, kosher pickles, green leaf lettuce, chives on brioche\n\nMozzapesto\nwhole mozzarella, thick tomato, roasted red pepper, baby arugula, balsamic reduction, house made pesto aioli on focaccia\n\nPollopesto\nhouse made chicken pesto, crumbled goat cheese, thick tomato, baby arugula tossed with lemon chive oil on focaccia\n\nABT\ndouble bacon, avocado, thick tomato, green leaf lettuce, mayo on focaccia\n\n(not pictured): Deluxe Cobb Salad: chopped romaine, mixed greens, grilled chicken, market egg, crispy bacon, avocado, blue cheese, cherry tomatoes with picnic vinaigrette\n\nThanks, Mission Picnic!", "author": "Chantel Y."}

Luckily I was here after the lunch rush though frankly it wouldn't take much to produce a rush, like two people who want a salad at the same time. There are plenty to choose from, five entree-size ones and two sides. Sandwiches as well, over a dozen listed on the chalkboard. Presumably most people must order to-go...\n\nBut hell, I came to eat there. Waitress? Waitress?? Oh, OK, I have to order at their tiny counter. I went for the $10.95 Beets and Greens which came in a box anyway, but it was a big box chock full of goodness - roasted beets, pear slices, berries, fennel, quinoa, goat cheese, toasted pecans, all of it on a bed of mixed greens and drizzled with a balsamic vinaigrette. It was all so neatly organized that it looked like a bento box (photo: http://bit.ly/2HxPrTD).

They specialize in sandwiches and salads that are uh-maze-ing. I've been here several times and have always ordered the deluxe cobb salad because it's just that good. It's your typical cobb salad and includes the fixings such as grilled chicken breast, hard boiled eggs, avocado, bacon, tomatoes, romaine lettuce and blue cheese. It's so simple yet so good!\n\nI love that the ingredients they use are always fresh! The romaine lettuce have a nice crisp to them and the tomatoes have a little snap to them and they're sweet. The rest of the ingredients look just as fresh and taste like they were straight from the farm or bought that morning. On top of the freshness, you get a big serving for a great price! A bang for your buck spot is hard to find, especially a place that uses fresh and high quality ingredients. You'll spend anywhere between 9-13$ for a meal. Mission Picnic is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.\n\nThe only thing I would like for them to change is to add a little more vinaigrette.", "author": "Steve H."}

There was only room for about three two top tables, pushed up against the right wall. Really a to-go place only. \n\nI ordered a Rodeo salad. It took about ten minutes for our order to be ready. This salad was similar to most southwestern style salads with a Tex Mex type flair. It had chopped romaine, roast beef, cotija cheese, avocado, corn, black beans, jalapeno, red pepper, red onion, tomato, cilantro, blue corn tortilla chips with chipotle ranch dressing. I got it mainly for the chipotle ranch and avocado. I loved the taste!\n\nIt cost $12 and could probably feed at least three people. I'm telling you, this salad weighed five pounds. I took some lettuce out of the salad and saved it before I ate it. Just because it was so gigantic. But, if too much food is my only problem, then I'm ok with that!", "author": "Hannah G."}

Our delivery order arrived via Caviar on Friday, June 23rd around 12 noon.\n\n*Flatiron: Hot romanian pastrami layered high with melted muenster cheese, kosher pickles, deli mustard on french ($11.95)\n*Baby Arugula Side Salad: Baby arugula salad dressed with lemon chive dressing ($3.75)\n*Potato Chips: Artisan chips from Route 11, Mama Zuma's Revenge ($1.95)\n\nWe have $20 to play with, so yes, I got a sandwich, salad, AND chips! The sandwich melded into one great bite. The pastrami salty, the cheese melty, the pickles sour. I'm not a huge bread person, but it was nice and chewy and soft. I had one bite with the bread and then just ate the insides. The cheese melted onto the bread, so I ended up having a little more bread with the filling which I didn't mind. (You can also request a lettuce wrap if you'd rather avoid the bread that way.) The salad was huge! Very densely packed in the takeout container. It ate some with my sandwich and ended up making a makeshift pastrami arugula salad. The only critique I had of the salad is that it needed more dressing. There was a tiny container about two thirds full for all that salad. It wasn't enough. I adored the chips. Great spice. If you can't handle heat, I suggest you pass on these as they may be the spiciest chips I've ever had.\n\nGreat place for sandwiches. All this food actually fed me three times that day.

Imagine my disappointment when I got home and unveiled what is shown in the picture. There was less than half of the salmon I saw in other pictures on the site, three anemic strands of red onion (yes, I counted), three capers (yes, I counted), and a whisper of cream cheese. If the sandwich looks inflated, its because of the avocado I added at home to make it more filling. Nothing like what was described/shown in the other reviews.

I walk in and can see one or two people also waiting for their order. I order a sandwich, and my receipt says #11. Right after this, #8 is called out. Great -- that means there's just two more people ahead of me. Then for over twenty minutes not a single order is called out, as they fill a huge Postmates order with what must be at least fifteen sandwiches and salads. Meanwhile other patrons have come in and have ordered, and the place gets packed as they work on the Postmates order, leaving everyone who is actually present waiting. Since it's getting backed up, the guy working the front counter goes back to help them fill the orders, and doesn't put on gloves or have a hair net, in clear violation of the health code.\n\nAt really off-peak times you might be able to get your order quickly, but otherwise I'd absolutely stay away.

The sandwiches overall were good, the portion sizes were great, neatly wrapped, and didn't fall apart when I ate them.  But the service is another story.

It's a sandwich shop and they ran out of bread.  So I only ordered the lemonade.  When I was here on the Saturday and Sunday I was able to order from the sandwich menu but the service wasn't great.  When I would ask questions the manager/staff member seemed very impatient with me, even though it wasn't a busy time of day.  He was very vague with answering my questions and seemed a little uptight/annoyed.  Like sheesh, it's not like I'm playing 20 questions or giving him a quiz.

Cranberry sauce in a sandwich was something I never tried before and it is amazing! Turkey is nice and moist and NOT DRY! Cause dry turkey is the worst. The sprouts gave it nice little crunch and was a good pairing with the rest of the sandwich as it complemented well.\n\nPOLLOPESTO- Also amazing! I love pesto on just about anything so I had to get this sandwich. It was absolutely amazing and I love the satisfying crunch sound I get when I bite into it. \n\nSMOKED SALMON- Got it once and it's great too. I love smoked salmon and cream cheese so this was my kind of sandwich. But since it's more expensive, I only got it once. \n\nSalads:\nI think I tried almost all of the salads except for the Winter Wedge.\n\nDELUXE COBB - As good as a Cobb can get. Sometimes I am fond of the bleu cheese, sometimes I am not. Chicken is really fresh and big pieces. They don't skimp on that! \n\nBEETS AND GREENS - I got this once by accident and I was pleasantly surprised by how good beets were. I don't think I ever had beets prior to this salad. I also enjoyed the candied pecans since it was a nice flavor to go along with the salad. I wish they had pecans in the other salads!\n\nCHOPPED ITALIAN - It was good but not my favorite since I like avocados and eggs in my salads usually. I'm much of a Cobb kind of girl.\n\nKALE CAESAR - There is this one single anchovy piece that stares back at me when I open my box. The smell always hits me but I am not an anchovy-hater although sometimes I don't know if having it adds to the salad. Get this with chicken because I do not know how people can eat just kale by itself. I just wish the kale was more chopped up instead of in a giant leaf form.\n\nAll the vinaigrettes are good. Red wine vinaigrette is my favorite. I do not like the caesar dressing as much since I prefer a creamier dressing and their caesar is bit thicker and mayo-like. But all their salads are great portions and super filling. They give you good size everything so a whole egg, nice cherry tomatoes and avocado, fresh lettuce, fresh chicken cut up in nice pieces and all. \n\nAwesome place! They deliver to anywhere in SF for $5 flat. They're always quite timely with my order deliveries. I did have two times when I was missing an order or got the wrong item but it was quick to reach them by phone to get that fixed. I can't even be mad since their food is so good and they're also really nice on the phone and even gave me an apology cookie+chips once. I gave the cookie to my co-worker but it smelled really good. SO GOOD. \n\nOh, and sometimes you get the person with the really beautiful handwriting who draws smiley faces on your boxes.

Walk-in and pick ups only since you won't be in a rush and it's more of a situation that you as a customer can control. \n\n7 days ago (2/4) I placed on order online for a picnic platter to feed 40 people with desserts and drinks. It was scheduled to be delivered today (2/11) at 11:30am and I have a confirmation email outlining this. At 11:45am when it hadn't shown up I called to get an ETA. \n\nFrom the jump it was clear that for whatever reason dude was not familiar with our order. He ultimately ended up saying there was a 'glitch' in the computer and we were scheduled for tomorrow - I don't buy it, I believe we were overlooked and someone forgot to put us in the lineup for today's deliveries and he was covering. \n\nWhy this person is on the phone dealing with customers is beyond me. It might benefit him to hire someone with customer service experience in the food industry if frustrations overwhelm him to the point of being so rude. \n\nI started our conversation very politely, introduced myself, gave context as to what I was calling in reference to, offered my order number, and everything was bumbled. \n\"Who are you? What's your name? Your calling from what company? Do you have your order number?\", and as I was trying to answer his questions I was being interrupted as if I was inconveniencing him. I finally had to tell him to stop speaking over me so I that I could give him the information he was asking for.  When I wasn't being interrupted I was being talked over with really annoyed, exasperated sighs \"Ugh, oh my goooodd. Ugh, geeez.\". \n\nWhen we finally got to a resolution I was offered all of the food I originally ordered, albeit an hour late or a refund. I told dude I wanted both and he laughed saying \"You want the food for free?\" - uhm, actually I want the service I paid for but since we are well beyond that being a possibility I want a refund and delivery of the items you promised. \n\nWhen our order arrived the driver told me that they never charged our card because the system never sent our order to him so when I informed him that what he was telling me was the exact opposite of what the owner told me (and the exact opposite of what the order confirmation and refund confirmation emails told me) all he could do was stare blankly.\n\nAs a small business owner I'd think he would have jumped at the opportunity to rectify the issue and retain customer who places orders for more than $600 a pop but it seems as if that's no important to him.\n\nGive your patronage to this establishment at your own risk.", "author": "McKenna B."}

Something about the simply boiled chicken, deliciously oily rice and aromatic m\u00e9nage a trios of sauces (chili, ginger and dark soy) makes me...uhh, makes me happy. Sorry, going to keep it PG-rated for once.\n\nSo naturally seeing the Hainan Chicken Sandwich on Mission Picnic's FB page almost made me keel over. A FOBanese American Sandwich? I'm all over it! I hoped into my imaginary rice rocket and vroomed vroomed my way to Mission Picnic yesterday while bumping to Stevie B.\n\nMission Picnic is a new sandwich shop serving seasonal sandwiches; some with an Asian twist. They're currently in their soft opening stage and have an awesome deal of 50% off your purchase (till today). Their Grand Opening is tomorrow.\n\nFormerly the Corazon Juice Bar, Mission Picnic is a tiny shop with just four two-top tables so this is more of a to-go place.\n\nFor their soft opening, they had 6 sandwiches available (~$8-9):\n*Picnic Club (Rotisserie chicken salad w/ bacon & cheddar)\n*Hainan Chicken (Garlic rotisserie chicken w/ cucumber & picnic spread)\n*San Franciscan (Hot pastrami, turkey & provolone)\n*Devil's Egg (Market boiled egg, bacon & provolone)\n*MozzaPesto (Mozzarella, basil, tomato & pesto aioli)\n*The King (Peanut butter, bananas, honey chocolate & frosted flakes).\n\nThey'll also have soups and salads in the future. \n\nMake sure to try one of their refreshing fruit shakes (pineapple, watermelon or strawberry - $2.75). I had the watermelon which was more like a fresh watermelon juice slushy but it was really good (no sugar added).\n\nCASH ONLY.\n\nThe Hainan Chicken Sandwich was nicely packed with tenderly moist garlic rotisserie chicken, sliced cucumbers, tomato, lettuce & picnic spread on dutch crunch: http://bit.ly/171yYMd. The picnic spread of garlic and parsley was slathered onto the bread before toasting so all that garlicky goodness soaked into every nook and cranny. So yummy!\n\nWhile the sandwich was solid and made with top-notch ingredients, it was more like a garlic pesto-ish chicken sandwich to me. I was hoping it would be more FOBanese. There was no ginger in the spread and ginger is what makes hainan chicken \"hainan\" imo. And, although the dutch crunch had a deliciously crunchy mottled crust, I think a less carb heavy bread like a baguette would let the ingredients shine for this particular sandwich. Just my two cents.\n\nOne of owners, Sterling was super nice and encouraged customer feedback which is always a sign to build customer loyalty and remain competitive in this marketplace. I hope he does see this and offers several FOBanese sandwich options in the future including vegan options for my Yelpie friend John B.  who's always in the hood and for all the surrounding PBR drinking and camel toe inducing skinny jean lovers of course.\n\nMission Picnic has a lot of potential and this was just their soft opening so I can't wait to see what other specialty sandwich ideas they have up their sleeve...\n\nPerhaps a pulled pork with apple wasabi slaw sandwich, a Tonton sesame marinated tofu w/ portobello mushroom sandwich, a longanisa banh mi or a loco moco sloppy joe? I can go on and on.\n\nNow only if I can come up with ideas like that in my field of work instead of looking like a deer caught in headlights all the time...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I started ordering just the salads and only oder a sandwich if someone is willing to share it with me. The kale caesar salad became my favorite. It was a mix of fresh romaine, baby kale, perfectly salted anchovies, great croutons, thick shavings of parmesan, and the best caesar dressing I ever had. The dressing was extra creamy with the perfect anchovy flavoring.\n\nThey seem to have raised their prices and changed the ingredients of their kale caesar salad. The salad is more expensive and smaller. They now use the rough curly kale rather than the tender baby kale. The parmesan shavings have been dry and rubbery. My favorite creamy caesar dressing has been replaced with an oily sour dressing. I thought the dressing was a mistake when I first noticed it a couple weeks ago, but I have tried it a few times now and they seemed to have permanently changed it...very disappointing.", "author": "D.

Known for its eclectic food--from taquerias to dosa places--the Mission is a mecca for unique flavors. However, working at an architecture firm, I often needed quick and easy meals on the go without compromising taste or nutrition. A co-worker suggested that I try Mission Picnic, and oh boy, I was not disappointed. \n\nMy favorite sandwich is the Picnic Club. Layers of tasty goodness: chicken, bacon, lettuce, cheese, pickles, mustard, and mayo. And the bread! No sandwich is complete without a freshly toasted bun. Mission Picnic offers a large selection of speciality sandwiches, unique to the store, of which you just have to try one of each. It also features other picnic items, such as salads, chips, blended juices, and cookies. Sandwich prices are a bit steep (about $9-$10 including tax), but Mission Picnic sandwiches make it up in deliciousness. You definitely aren't going to get a $5 footlong here (and why would you want to?)\n\nThe storefront is small with a few tables and chairs, but its presence is very strong. With its hand written menu and funky decor, it's represents the Mission very well.\n\nI was in the Mission today and wanted to visit all the food places I missed while I was away. One of the first to come to mind was Mission Picnic. Per usual, I ordered the Picnic Club and it was as delicious as I remembered. The counter server was Kathleen--one of the sweetest girls you'll ever meet. My sandwich was prepared by Sterling, the owner, a sandwich connoisseur, and, I must say, a little bit of a flirt. Also, shout out to Brian who was counting the till as I was complimenting the staff.\n\nBeing back at Mission Picnic reminded me of how small businesses can have a strong impact on a community. A sandwich is just a sandwich until it represents something more. Food is much more than about sustenance; it's about an experience. \n\nSo if you're hankering for a really, really good sandwich in the Mission District, scoot your butt to 22nd Street between Valencia and Mission, grab yourself a sandwich, have a picnic in Dolores Park, and enjoy!", "author": "Joanna S."}

I almost called them because it was such a huge disappointment. When you call something a \"kale caesar\" it should have more kale and less romaine. Why emphasize the kale part in the title? After the beet and greens salad, I was expecting something higher quality. The cubano was 9.50 and turned to mush. Maybe the other sandos are okay, but that's not one of the better ones. I'm very hesitant to go in again.", "author": "Tori M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-28", "description": "(See pics) Review #1351.Sandwich is more 3.5 stars. The 4 stars is because of the dessert.\n\nWhat was once popular Corazon Juicebar (there were people coming in looking for the old place) now is a sandwich shop. No sign until Friday (3/28) as they are really trying to test out their menus WITHOUT too much publicity.\n\nI really think the owner has a kick in making DESSERTS more than the sandwiches and that is why reviewing the dessert first as it's the real highlight!\n\nSterling has recently lived in France so this looks like a dream extension. Every dessert is made by him and as he mentioned (yeah sorry I was skeptical), it's the lighter sweet kind! They looked so very pretty and meticulously elegant, from tiramisu to chocolate, to fruit tarts. All were lovely and I had the strawberry cake and must say the aroma bursts out through the creamy silkness! If they would only add the coffee drink or tea, it will be a perfect afternoon spot or after dinner place to relax.\n\nOnto the sandwiches, they have a handful selection including Devil's Eggs on deli white (suggested it would be a real nice appetizer), Mozzapesto on focaccia, San Franciscon (west coast style pastrami with provolone) on rustic French, The King (only sweet sandwich with peanut butter, banana, honey, chocolate, frosted flakes!) on brioche, Picnic Club (chicken with chipotle) on ciabatta and Hainan Chicken on dutch crunch.\n\nWas totally eying the Hainan chicken but that was the one not recommended. The owner, Sterling, said if you are Chinese and had the Hainan chicken back home, you would find it to be not like that. Asked if maybe there was a twist to his recipe and it was said to still be perfected. So instead I ordered his recommendation (his most confident dish like The Taste show) and had the Picnic Club.\n\nThe chicken was decently 3.35 stars but the good substantial size made it up to 3.5 stars. It's $8.5 but paid half price as everything is (drinks and food) until Friday night during their soft opening. The little bacon bites were with a tingle of sweetness and a nice touch of crunchiness. It was also packed with mustard, lettuce and tomato, the standard. Did sincerely suggested that every sandwich has to be good and not just 1 or 2 signatures in the long run and look forward to the future visits.\n\nThey also made quiches in house. So many choices in such a small place!\n\nAnother major high point is they are currently open until 8pm and midnight on the weekends. This is bound to change to also open until midnight during the week. Considering Revolution is just around the corner and the shop is in between 2 major, major streets of late night establishments, or if you just live in the hood, having a bite here is a refreshing new option comparing with the bacon wrapped hot dogs and pizza, as one patron excitedly pointed out about the choice of switching out pizzas.\n\nThe peeps here were super friendly, like Mission genuine friendly, and the business partner who came in a bit later was also a nice chap checking and preparing more decorations and chit chatted with customers.\n\nDo want to see when this tiny shop expands to include next door office space, as well as other choices of sandwiches such as anchovy with capers (would be a definite to try.)\n\nGrand opening is this Saturday and if you are into vodka they are planning on having a party serving that with other refreshments and food.", "author": "T L."}

The interior has 3 tables and is super narrow and cute, so taking your sandwich to-go on a sunny SF day makes their \"picnic\" namesake apt :) \n\nHainan Chicken Sandwich was the most unique sandwich on the menu, which stood out to me. The chicken was perfect: not dry at all, and cut into manageable pieces, very true to Hainan style. The rest of the sandwich was perfectly proportioned, the accompanying lettuce was so fresh, and the bread was delectable. highly recommended!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-05-17", "description": "5/17/13 Lunch\n\nA new sandwich shop serving sammies with a twist. Upon entering this tiny little shop we were whetted by the menu on the wall: Nuuevo Cubano, Hainan Chicken, ABT, San Franciscan (pastrami and oven-baked turkey)... all sounded good and yummy. After a few minutes of deliberation, my friend and I decided on two to share:\n\n*Nuevo Cubano: roasted pork and black forest ham with red pickled onion, a slice of pineapple on a crispy ciabatta. The avocado/jalapeno aioli and dijon all folded into a yummy flavor. I didn't taste the roasted pork but the ham was good. Pineapple dominated the flavor so maybe they could put more meat?\n\n*Hainan Chicken: this one, served on a rustic French roll, is almost twice the side of the Cubano. \"Hainan\" is really \"Ayam\" from Malay, meaning chicken. Ayam became Hainan when the boiled chicken dish came to China. Anyway, the Hainan chicken sandwich here doesn't come with the usual ginger, but a garlicky butter and scallion oil. Maybe they should consider a crushed ginger dip like that you get from a Chinese deli? The chicken is simply boiled but very tender and moist, unlike the usual leathery, rubbery texture of deli chicken. The assembly, complete with cilantro, sliced tomato and cucumber, looked a bit like a bunh mi. \n\nWe were also tempted by their special creation of the day: a French Toast sandwich with lumps of strawberries powdered sugar. But we were too full to have a go at dessert. They also have a PBJ sandwich, as well as a Salami plate. Guilty of having too much carbs? Get the Peach and Avocado salad.\n\nSo many possibilities here at Mission Picnic even though they don't offer katsu, the staple of Rhea down the street. They also allowed substitution. A guy came in toward the end of our meal and asked for ABT without the B---that is, bacon! So here you go. Give this place a try. Sammies are not piping toasty.\n\nMinimum $10 for credit card.", "author": "Matt Y."}

About half an hour later when we finally sat down to eat, I expected the sandwiches to be at least a little soggy and drippy, but that wasn't the case at all-- somehow, after being manhandled for a solid 20 minutes during the walk from Mission Picnic to my friend's place, the sandwiches still managed to stay perfectly intact. The bread was surprisingly still crispy, as if it'd just come out of the oven, and the ingredients were all in their rightful places and tasted totally fresh. The sandwiches weren't dry either, so I have no idea how they maintained their crispiness, but it was gooood. Sandwich magic, I guess.\n\nWe shared 4 different sandwiches: the ABT, Pollo Pesto, Nuevo Cubano, and Cranturkey. The Cranturkey was my absolute favorite-- a lightly crisped french roll and just the right amount of cranberry sauce so as to not overpower the rest of the ingredients. The Nuevo Cubano was an unexpected runner up; normally I avoid pineapple in savory dishes because I think the combination is barfworthy, but again, the NC had just enough to add an unexpected kick. I thought the Pollo Pesto tasted a bit bland in comparison to the other sandwiches we picked up, but it actually came out as the favorite for 2 out of 4 people in our sandwich-tasting crew.", "author": "Kristina C."}

The sandwiches are mostly traditional, with a bit of an interesting flair - the most popular and talked about is the Hainan Chicken sandwich. I wanted to try something different. \n\nThe San Franciscan (~$9.50) was screaming my name, with ingredients like Pastrami, Turkey, Pepperocini's.... and it was delicious! The combination of quality ingredients sandwiched between some amazing Semifreddo's French Bread made this an amazing sandwich. I just wish there was more meat (in general) on all of these sandwiches. \n\nMission Picnic is better than most of it's popular neighborhood competitors, like Rhea's, Pal's Takeaway, and Ike's (whoa, I said it). Nothing in the area is quite like it, but in terms of delivering an amazing pastrami, I think I still like the Sandwich Place and Marina Subs. In terms of top notch quality ingredient sandwich, my heart is still with Salumeria and Roli Roti. For something really different, I enjoy options at Bite Me. \n\nI'm a sandwich snob, and yet with so many options in the neighborhood, I would recommend stopping at Mission Picnic for your Dolores Park supplies.

Mission picnic is leading the pack in terms of diverging away from your standard sandwich and giving you a true experience. With a great selection, nothing here is boring and every single sandwich (I've tried all but the king) is as exciting as the next.\n\ni do however have a list of favourites; the San Franciscan being the staple with which you will never be disappointed. When you're feeling a bit more daring the Nuevo Cubano is so different and so delicious. The Hainan is also a great one which I suggest you all try before it leaves the menu. My favourite salad is the beets and greens and the side of potato salad is a must with any order. \n\nThere is so many good things to say about this place but I think what really stood out for me is the quality of the ingredients. I tried the new beef sandwich before I left and it literally melts in your mouth; thankfully they gave me a very generous portion of it. The staff are great, the atmosphere is nice and they deliver!

Excited to try a new place with such great reviews, and so near our typical haunt of the Mission Mercato on Thursdays, the boyfriend and I ventured to Mission Picnic on a Thursday late afternoon/evening to get some togo sandwiches. The place is small and we were the only patrons since it was an odd hour (probably around 4:30 or 5). We were lucky enough to be served by the owner and he recommended for us to try the Club and the Hainan Chicken. \n\nThe sandwiches did take a while to be made but I'm always okay with waiting for food to be prepared fresh. While we were waiting, the owner chatted us up as there was someone else there to make the sandwiches, Jose, who also works at Pal's Takeaway. Apparently, the owner is half Chines, half French and we learned that once when he was three years old, his mother found him pounding flour into the carpet while watching Jacque Pepin. Interesting. \n\nAnyway, we took the sandwiches home and were excited to dig in, but it was just a very underwhelming experience. The ingredients seemed well thought out, but it just didn't have that it factor that would make me return to a place. The Hainanese seemed a bit dry, not enough flavor, not vinegary or savory enough. I suppose it's a good option in the area, but it's not a destination for me. I walk past this place all the time and don't really have anything causing me to return anytime soon.", "author": "Victoria J."}

Creative yet intuitive flavors, friendly staff, chutes, ladders, the outdoor concert from a Zoloft commercial...\n\nSorry, I couldn't resist.  Anyway, I went today and ordered the Sgt. Slawter, and it was definitely in my top 20 sandwiches of all time (which is really saying something for me!).  It was the perfect combination of textures and flavors, juicy but not enough to make the bread soggy.  The teriyaki slaw with roast beef is brilliant, particularly when paired with dutch crunch and a garlic/herb spread.  The meat was exceptional: very thin and juicy with some real flavor.  This is some high-quality stuff, not your typical grocery-store cold cuts.\n\nPreviously, I've ordered the Hainan Chicken, which was good but didn't blow my mind like the Slawter did.\n\nMy only hang-up is the price.  It's just hard for me to justify spending $8.50 on a sandwich, even when it is amazing.  This is the only reason I won't be eating at Mission Picnic on a daily basis.  I'm not saying it's overpriced, just that it's too expensive for me to eat here as regularly as I'd like.  \n\nYou can really tell that the food here is made with care and quality ingredients.  I haven't seen such inventive and new flavor pairings in a sandwich shop, and I've eaten a lot of sandwiches.  The bottom line: go, and get the Sgt. Slawter.

Again, a minute later, another call saying they're out of focaccia bread and they only have French loaves left. WTF? Fine, I'll deal. However, I specified for the Premium Vegan to have NO ONIONS! What does the sandwich come with when delivered? A field of HORRID RED ONIONS! At this point, I'm livid and pick off each piece of onion. I vow never to order for delivery again.\n\nThe sandwiches merit the prices and flavor is good, not great. I ate half of the Vegan, onionless sandwich and my breath reeks of ONIONS!

Every one I have tried has been exceptional. The salads are bountiful, simple, and flavorful. The $3 delivery fee - delivery via TCB - is worth every penny. My food usually arrives in half the time the confirmation email promises (and no hipster lines to wait in!). The Salumi Special sammy is like an upscale muffaletta, which I have been craving.

The Hainan got perfectly baked dutch crunch, you know with the thin and crunchy outside, and the warm soft inside.  Once your teeth get through the bread, then you get some excellently seasoned chicken the rest of the way through.\n\nThe San Franciscan is on a French roll, also with a good crust and warm soft inside the bread.  The pastrami is juicy.  You already think it's amazing, and then the provolone and turkey run through and straight wrestle your taste buds into submission.  Another excellent sandwich.  I've got several more to try like the Cubano and the King.", "author": "Yoway B."}

Thank you, Mission Picnic for popping my yelp review writing cherry.  That's about all I can thank you for.  The food here isn't even all that bad.  It is pretty standard.  But the customer service I received today (or didn't receive) left me beyond perplexed.  I ordered lunch for my office through GrubHub (love them - they are always good to me) and got a call from the restaurant that the food was on its way, but they had forgotten a sandwich.  She presented me with the option of a refund, but that would have completely defeated the purpose as to why I ordered food to be delivered.  Our crew is filming in the studio today and no one can leave the office.  She said because they were already on the way, they would rather refund.  I told her then one person would be out a lunch and asked them to please correct their mistake and send the sandwich.  When the first order came I realized there was a second sandwich missing (for the founder and CEO of my company, nonetheless.)  I tried calling several times but got no answer.  I finally called GrubHub, who after several times of trying to contact them as well told me they were refusing to send the SECOND missing sandwich because they were too busy.  I will NEVER order food from here again.  You forget two people's lunch and REFUSE to send it because you're too busy?  Not my fault as a paying customer that your staff can't get it together.  So as far as customer service here, the service part of that simply doesn't exist.  \"Refusing re-delivery because its too busy......\" Unbelievable.", "author": "Chelsea S."}

We stopped by and had the Pesto-Mozzarella sandwich and the Premium Vegan. The latter was such a bummer. The sandwich was incredibly dry -- just a little hummus -- and there was no salt, no pepper, no seasoning whatsoever. The Pesto-Mozzarella at least had some flavor, but zero points for innovation. These are sandwiches you can find on any menu, and that can be prepared far better at home for a fraction of the price.

They charge you an extra sixty or thirty cents if you use a credit card under ten dollars. this is a sandwich to fill you up! They also have fresh juice and fruit like watermelon. there are some other sandwiches that look good, like the cranberry turkey one. i wish i could eat peanuts, because they have one with peanutbutter, chocolate, bananas and CORN FLAKES! ill most likely be back! oh, and there's about three tables, this is more of a takeout place than an eat in. hence the name Picnic.", "author": "Merredith L."}

I usually order from this place since I just live 30 steps away! one thing I recommend is call ahead of time because they do take 15 min to make your sandwich. I remember i called in one day and came in 15min and it was not ready since they had a huge catering order, so I waited another 10 patiently and then another 10min frustrated!! Everyone in that store was also with a straight face because they been waiting for a long time. Overall it took 35 min to get my sandwich, and I was late for my final and that is why I am giving them a 3 star. Every single time I think of this place I think twice because of that one experience I had. It does suck to not have an accurate estimation!!! Because i recently got San Francisco Jun16th and my sandwich was cold because I decided to go in 15min instead of 10 min.
