Most of the food was amazing, especially the popovers and burger. However, the service was horrendous. My group and I arrived 10 minutes before the restaurant's opening hour but the doors were locked so we waited outside until someone came to unlock & open the restaurant doors... 10 minutes after the restaurant was supposed to open. \n\nUpon opening, we checked into our reservation with the host and were promptly seated upstairs. Because we arrived upon opening, the floor was pretty slow and we were one of 4 tables but for whatever reason it took the waiter 10 minutes to greet us & take our orders, another 10 to retrieve our drinks AND he knocked over the garnish on my boyfriend's bloody mary told him he'd fetch him another garnish but never did... he also failed to check on us after our meals arrived. Another thing that turned my friends & I off about Wayfare Tavern was how disgustingly stained our waiter's shirt was. The restaurant just opened and he had pet hair & stains all over his white shirt. So unappetizing! \n\nAnyway, I might opt to do take out but I would never set foot in this restaurant ever again.", "author": "Sara J."}

The atmosphere was great, the food was fantastic and my friends and I had a great time. The wait staff was very attentive, friendly, and accommodating to our needs.\n\nHowever, there was a red headed older lady who was our hostess and she was rude from the get go. At the beginning of my event, After I had refused to purchase bottles of wine because many of my guests were not wine drinkers, she acted annoyed with us from then on. There was 16 of us, the maximum for the billiard room and the reason I booked a private dining room/ event. If she didn't want to put any effort into her job then she shouldn't be a hostess of any events and if this is her personality, she needs some serious training in customer service.

A good coworker of mine comes here every year for her birthday celebration and I can see why. In a town with lots of cuisines from all over the world, it's almost novel to be in a restaurant that is traditionally American.  \n\nThe appetizers include steak tartare and deviled eggs. Both were great - the steak tartare is particularly noteworthy. Bread service was a pop-over with salted butter and I devoured that in about one minute flat.  The dish to order here is the Fried Chicken. There are some who would argue that this is the best fried chicken in town but I still love Brenda's better. Don't get me wrong - this is damn good fried chicken (moist with light breading) and I would order this again.  I've eaten a lot of mushroom fries lately (crispy hen of the Woods or enoki fries) and the portabello mushroom fries here were definitely competitive.  The doughnuts are a must order dessert. Wayfare Tavern is known for them and they are fabulous.\n\nService is excellent and my glass of water was never empty.  The restaurant has an ambiance that is both elegant and warm.  With tax and tip, this is about $75 per person - an average amount for fine dining in SF. Highly recommended!!!", "author": "Andrew S."}

Delicious food.\n\nIf you're hoping to come noon or afterwards for lunch, be sure to make a reservation. It gets very busy during lunch time, and you might have a longer wait if you aren't able to come near opening time. \n\nWonderful service. Our server, Brad, was super attentive, knew the menu inside-and-out, and always made sure our water cups remained more than half-full. He was thoughtful and even offered to add an extra piece of chicken (+$5) to our entree since we planned on splitting the fried chicken (which comes with 5 pieces) so that we each could have 3 pieces each. We opted not to get extra though-- with 2 sides, we couldn't even finish all 5 pieces of chicken :)\n\nPopovers || Complimentary\nYumm. There's someone who comes over with a basket filled with piping hot popovers that you can slather with the whipped butter located in a tin on your table. Huge, fluffy, and light. These are some of the largest popovers I've seen. \n\nOrganic Fried Chicken || $26 \nHalf a chicken. Touted as the best fried chicken in America in the F&W 2016 magazine. Was it the best fried chicken I've ever had? Mm...not sure I'd claim it as #1, but Wayfare Tavern's fried chicken definitely tops my top 3 list! The chicken is marinated in a buttermilk brine, so the meat is tender, flavorful, and slightly on the saltier side. They also coat the chicken in an herb layer prior to crusting it in a light batter. That single layer of batter is AMAZINGLY crispy. I'm in awe of how crispy...even the leftovers were still crispy hours after taking them home with me. The chicken comes with fresh cracked black pepper with coriander, sea salt, and lemon wedges. Be sure to try pairing these with the meat. \n\nTruffled Parmesan Polenta Fries || $12 \nComes with a romesco sauce. The polenta is surprisingly soft and more runny than I expected once you bite through the crunchy fried exterior. I couldn't taste any of the acclaimed \"truffled\" part of the dish though, which was a main reason why I ordered this. Not much of a wow factor. Skip!\n\nBurrata Whipped Potatoes || $9 \nCreamy whipped potatoes blended with burrata cheese melted in. Topped with a splash of olive oil and chopped chives. Tasty side and much lighter than I expected. When I order potatoes, I usually think filling and heavy. Not this dish! Light, fluffy, delish. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend trying out Wayfare Tavern. It is pricier than your average lunch place, but you definitely get an experience well worth it!", "author": "Jennifer H."}

Well, this place is much, much nicer than any pub I've ever been to! \n\nWe ordered quite a bit here because everything looked soooo good. Let's start with their organic fried chicken dish- this dish had won an award from food and wine magazine. Honestly, it was good, but not amazing enough to call itself the best friend chicken in America. Would I recommend this dish? Sure. Would I get it again? Probably not.\n\nWe got the fish special, and that was really good! Along with the cabbage salad, which was also good if you're looking for a light snack.\n\nNow, where all the deliciousness really lies is in the sides. The baked truffle Mac and cheese and the green beans were delicious! I'd definitely go back for them. \n\nOh! And one of my favorite things was the fresh bread they brought us before our meals. This bread was fresh, and I mean, the dough was hand pressed hours ago, baked minutes ago, and served right out of the oven. That fresh! \n\nOverall, I recommend this place. Definitely a huge step up from your average tavern.", "author": "Sheila G."}

The main floor of the restaurant has a classic, but cozy and warm feeling to it like you're walking into a home rather than to a restaurant in the middle of FiDi. \n\nThey offer a nice variety of dishes for lunch. We started with the Deviled Eggs, which I'm not always a big fan of, but these were so flavorful with crab, avocado, and lime. I'd eat these again any day, any time, especially with the complimentary piping hot popovers! \n\nFor my entree, I had the City Salad with blueberries, radishes, quinoa, apples, pickled onions, and wheat berry. I added on a side of grilled chicken, which was more like roasted chicken, but I had no complaints as it was incredibly moist and juicy. \n\nMy colleagues had the Fried Chicken, Fish and Chips Sandwich, Burger, and Salmon and each dish looked amazing. (I can't wait to go back and try these!)\n\nThe servers are courteous and very professional. They have service down to a science, but we weren't sure if they wanted us to hurry up and leave as we were seated in a booth and I'm sure these were in high demand. \n\nMy only minor complaint is that the restaurant is pretty loud, so if you want more of an intimate dining experience, you might want to request a table in a quieter area.

After coming back from Adhoc in Napa, I was craving some delicious fried chicken.  Wayfare Tavern's supposedly famous fried chicken dish was extremely disappointing.  The meat was so dry I wondered if they were feeding their chickens dust.  What's worse was that half our party ordered the dish and had the same result.  If properly cooked, I can see how this dish could be good because the rosemary flavor and the breading were pretty tasty.  Our party also ordered two Tavern burgers, both were ordered medium rare.  One burger came perfect, the other came well done.  I mentioned this to the server and he brought out a medium rare burger replacement within 10 minutes.  The two appetizers our party ordered were decent, one being the burrata tomato salad and the other was the bone marrow.  \n\nBottomline: The service was decent but the execution of the food left me a bit underwhelmed.  \n\n3 stars.", "author": "Kelvin C."}

They don't seat you unless your entire party is present, so that's something to note. \n\nOur wait staff (and I'm terrible that I didn't catch a name) was amazing. He (and the other staff) were extremely attentive, ensuring we had filled waters and checked in on us enough that we weren't neglected but not so much that we felt hassled. \n\nThe entire team chose fried chicken, after being told it was what we should get. The chicken was great. They deboned the white meat, and it seems to have been cooked separately. The white meat was still juicy, and the dark meat was great. The rosemary and sage that came with the chicken wasn't overpowering. If you wanted more sage or rosemary, you could pinch it into each bite yourself. Build your own flavor, if you will.\n\nWe also got a few sides:\n\nGreen Beans - get this. It was so delicious.\nMashed Potatoes - If you like very creamy mashed potatoes, get this. I like mine a little more structured, and this felt more like a puree than mashed potatoes.\nMushrooms - get this too. Very buttery and delicious. \n\nDesserts:\nPeach cobbler - really good. The crumble was delicious.\nDonuts - also really good, though I wish there was a bit more cream.\n\nFood itself was solid, but I'd say the service was the best.

Prior to my dining experience, I perused the online menu as I am mostly vegetarian, sometimes pescatarian (for the right dish), and wanted to make sure that there was at least one option for me.  Initially I was concerned that there weren't any strictly vegetarian options, but one of their main courses was fish so I'd kind of already made up my mind on what I'd order before I even stepped foot into this place. \n\nThere were 6 of us in the party, with reservations for 5:45.  5 of the 6 of us were ready to be seated a few minutes before 6, but were told by the hostess we'd need to be done by 7:45, which quite turned me off.  I understand a massive conference taking place, but how can you put a time limit on your patrons, especially a party of 6 who are about to drop several hundred dollars in your establishment?  \n\nRegardless, after we were seated and greeted by our waiter, he completely turned the experience around.  He was quite lovely really; friendly, witty, attentive, and ready and able to answer our questions as well as offer suggestions for the side dishes and the wine list.  \n\nAfter appetizers of a half dozen oysters, shrimp cocktail and deviled eggs, I settled on the trout dish which came with cauliflower, raisins and almonds.  My least favorite part was that the skin was still on, but it was a decent size fillet and cooked to perfection.  Most everything served is a la' carte, so the group of us ordered each one of the sides, except for the green beans.  The mac & cheese was by far my favorite dish.  The mashed potatoes were more of a gravy, but were still very tasty.  The pollenta was yummy.\n\nI dug the atmosphere and ambiance of Wayfare, but seating on the ground floor is a bit cramped.  I know there is an upstairs seating area as well, but I couldn't speak for it's size.  The restrooms are located in the basement of the building with very cool wallpaper and decor.    \n\nI'm not sure I'd suggest coming to this place, unless you're there for the fried chicken which 3 of the 6 of us ordered and they absolutely loved it.

Wayfare Tavern is an excellent option to consider if you are looking to partake in such festivities. And, what better time to explore this restaurant than during San Francisco Restaurant week? Welp, that's exactly what I did! I came here with a couple of friends on the last day of SF Restaurant Week and left very satisfied. We saved some bucks without having to compromise food options or quality.\n \nMy expectations were high after reading many of the glowing reviews about this place. But after dining here, I can happily say that they met my expectations. They didn't exceed them, but everything was still wonderful.\n \nAmbience is of the essence here. I could feel it the very second that I arrived. It has a very spacious upstairs/downstairs setup with the main dining area being located on the second floor. The word \"classic\" instantly came to mind as I observed their very elegant interior. It's filled with nicely polished cherry wood furniture, vintage wall paper and antique carpeting. A little dark, a little fancy, a little sexy, and all around divine!\n\n Service was exceptional and remained this way throughout the entire entire evening. Our server Chelsea was ON IT! Nope, the service didn't miss a beat. Even my leftovers were treated like royalty! They essentially have a coat check for your leftover food. They take your food, package it for to-go, and then provide you with a ticket that you can use to redeem your leftovers downstairs before you leave. I've never seen anything like it. That alone just simply intrigued me.\n\nAs far as the food goes... it was absolutely fantastic! Let me just say that all of the side dishes were magnificent! As I previously mentioned, I came here with a group for SF Restaurant Week. None of the sides that we ordered were included on the restaurant week menu, which I thought was very odd. However, they have to make their money somehow, right? \n\nThe restaurant menu was a pre-fixe and included a butter lettuce salad for starters, organic fried chicken as the entree, and a chocolate cream pie for dessert. We ended up ordering their baked macaroni and cheese, Brussel sprouts, and burrata whipped potatoes. We were also served a warm complimentary popover which was huge and tasty! It came warm and fluffy and was a great way to start off our meal!\n\nAll of the side dishes were served family style and the portions were enough to accommodate all four of us comfortably. The baked macaroni and cheese was incredible! It had the perfect crispy bake on the outside and this lovable ooey gooey cheesiness in the interior. The Brussel sprouts were just perfect! They were lightly seasoned but somehow seemed to retain the most flavor out of everything on the table. \n\nMy favorite side dish was their burrata whipped potatoes! Oh maaaah gaaaawd! Can you say creamy?! These suckers were just oozing with creaminess all throughout. The addition of the burrata was a huge hit! I just LOVED it! The salad was a straight dream! It appeared to be so simple but it really held its' own. I mean, it was simple, but the pairing made for the most refreshing taste. So, I'm typically not a fan of chocolate cake. BUUUT... that chocolate cream pie was just something else! It literally melted in my mouth. It was amazing!\n\nAs for the main entree, the organic fried chicken; it was tasty, but definitely not the best that I've had. Maybe because it was organic? Maybe because it seemed to lack any seasoning other than basic salt... and there was just a tad bit too much salt? Maybe because I grew up on this stuff and I rate it harder compared to anything else? Not exactly sure what it was, but the fried chicken didn't blow my mind like everything else did. \n\nDespite this, it was still very good. A nice coating with decent flavor and it was juicy. Portion size was adequate for what we paid for in regards to the restaurant week menu. However, I would not pay $30 for this alone if I had dined here on any other night. But hey, it's a restaurant week pre-fixe, so... you get what you get! The wine selection was great but also very pricey. It's actually cheaper to buy by the glass versus by the bottle here. My glass of Malbec was tasty and my friends enjoyed their wine and cocktails as well. \n\nOverall, I left pleased and I would definitely consider coming back to try out a different entree. This is an excellent spot for an intimate date night or for a celebration. Definitely not for everyday unless you're City ballin'! Looking forward to returning in the future.", "author": "Shayla B."}

My friends and I came for SF restaurant week 2018 (formerly DAT for those who remember).  I love to explore different restaurants during this special week, and I tend to go on the very last day.  Some restaurants get it and some don't.  If you're going to participate in SFRW, go big or go home!\n\nWayfare Tavern did not disappoint.  The infamous fried chicken is \"slap yo momma\" good!  Portion sizes from the promotion were decent; my friends couldn't even finish their dessert.  More popovers please :)  They seated us in the rustic dining room upstairs, love the ambiance.  We ordered drinks and mouthwatering appetizers to share.  Staff were attentive, refilling our glasses of water and bringing out warm popovers.  We toasted to a wonderful night out with lovely friends, great conversation, and fun laughs.  That's what Wayfare Tavern is all about, come here and enjoy yourselves.

We tried most of the popular known for dishes.\n\nFresh popover with butter was a good starter. Fresh and light between a cream puff shell and croissant. Its good so you don't fill up on bread. I think you can ask for more but we didn't.\n\nStarted off with the Petaluma farms deviled eggs. Good amount of yolk per egg and nice presentation. However I barely tasted any bacon and the tarragon and parmesan didn't go well in my opinion. I think one or the other would have been better. \n\nMain entr\u00e9e was the organic fried chicken! You can share this dish since it was quiet a good amount of chicken. You have to squeeze the lemon and sprinkle the spices that come on the side with it. It definitely brings out the flavor! Chicken was not greasy and it was very moist.\n\nWe ordered the burrata whipped potatoes and the mac & cheese to share. I personally loved the whipped potatoes. Creamy and amazeballs. Not buttery and overly salted. The mac & cheese was ok. I would have rather it be more cheesy.\n\nTavern burger came with fries. This was a very good burger especially if your in the mood for some meat! Burger was thick and juicy. Brioche bun was fresh. \n\nFor dessert I tried the housemade doughnut and omg its defin a must try! Wish they would just sell them by the dozen. We paired it with the Equator coffee.

After looking on Yelp, we couldn't help but notice the nice pictures and overall positive reviews for this place so we ended up coming to here. We came right after work hours which was around 6pm on a Wednesday night. The place was starting to get packed as people from the financial district area are getting off and is having a drink. One thing that we noticed upon entering was that everyone was dressed up in suits/formal attires while my friends and I wore casual outfit such as jeans and hoodies (My friend is a web developer hence the casualness). I don't know if it was our casualness but I felt that upon entering, we were treated like someone that didn't belong there. We were just brought over to one of the round table right next to the entrance and wasn't attended to for a good 10-15 minutes. \n\nWhen we were attended to, we put in our order and just wanted to get it over with at this point. I ordered the salmon with artichoke as my friend ordered the fried chicken. I also ordered a cream soda as I wasn't feeling anything alcoholic this time. The food arrived in a decent amount of time and they were good. \n\nThe Salmon that I ordered was pan seared to perfection. The outer bits of the salmon is nice and flavorful whilst the inside is soft. A lot of places tend to overcook salmon but not here. It came with artichoke stems and they were good. I never really ate artichoke before but after this, I feel like I need to eat it more often. It also came with a side of sauce which I think is a cranberry sauce. It paired well with the salmon and artichoke.\n\nMy friend ordered the fried chicken and it was awesome. The skin was crispy and the meat moist. I don't think we ever had fried chicken that tasted like this and especially not from a bar. It came with a side of salad and the dressing on it was really good too. We know fried chicken is good but who knew it was THIS good.\n\nShortly after, we were given pop-over breads. We were confused to why we were given the breads after our meal. It turns out that people normally get it prior to their meal but not us. Maybe they got busy and forgot? They also forgot the soda that I ordered and I had to remind them. But the nice waiter said that he was sorry about it and that it was on the house. That was a nice gesture. We quickly finished our food and wanted to get out as we kept getting the feeling that we were either getting rushed or not properly attended to. \n\nOverall the food was good but the experience not so much. I don't want to make any assumptions but I felt that we were not properly attended to because of our attire and perhaps our age? I don't know and I hope that is not the case. The only positive about the service was the waiter. He was friendly and always had a smile. It also seemed to be a busy night but he makes an effort to attend to all of his tables so I give him props for that.", "author": "Eddie T."}

Firstly, let me say that the service is outstanding - some of the best I've had in a long time. From the host stand to the wait staff, our experience was wonderful. And it is not just prompt or professional - everyone was so friendly and personable. It made for a special time. Now to the meal: I had seen so many positive reviews for the fried chicken that I couldn't resist. It was indeed awesome. Fresh, full of flavor, and tender. 5 pieces, so a good sized meal. My colleague had a pork chop that he said was great. The only disappointment was the sides. I got mac and cheese, and there was something a little bitter or overwhelming about the flavor. I couldn't put my finger on it but I did not really enjoy it. My colleague had whipped potatoes, and although I did not try them they were thin to the point of soupy. It looked like potato soup. My colleague was frustrated with it, but seemed to really enjoy the pork chop. We were too full for dessert. Both of us took part of our meal with us to go. They had a great system for it - they send the food to go down to the host stand where it is bagged up for you! A great place.", "author": "Brian W."}

The skin/batter is crispy but not too crispy like it was double fried. Overall, it is definitely a very solid fried chicken but I am not sure if the price matches the dish. The free bread is very buttery and almost pastry like.

My wife and I are visiting from Scottsdale AZ for a few days and we were really looking forward to this dinner.  I will start with the good.  The service here is excellent.  From the Hostess to the Waitress to the Managers, everyone is really professional and very courteous.  \n\nWe started with the deviled eggs which were very good.  Since my wife is a vegetarian, she ordered the only entree that was available, the City Salad which is an Entree Salad. I ordered the Heritage Pork Chop. It was ordered Medium which was the chef recommendation.  \n\nNow the bad....My chop looked beautiful, but it was raw...literally raw when I cut into it.  I HATE sending things back, but this time I had no choice.  It would have been dangerous to eat this.  I will say the Chop was taken back and after 10-15 minutes, returned to me cooked properly and I must admit it was good.  As for my wife's salad, this is the real disappointment.  For almost $20.00, you would expect a REALLY great salad.  This Salad was small and WAY overdressed.  It was mainly iceberg lettuce as well.  I would say it was a very very average to below average Starter salad.  Nothing close to what one would expect from Tyler Florence as an Entree Salad.  Take a lesson from Bobby Flay and his Sophie's Chopped Salad.  \n\nI will end it here.....The Staff was apologetic about my Raw Chop and they did comp our cocktails which was very nice and a solid business move.

The reviews for it were great, and I was entries by the claim that this restaurant had some of the best fried chicken ever. I looked through the menu and it seemed good enough and quickly made my reservation. When I arrived, the restaurant felt very old school but all the servers and workers were more than accommodating. I got some recommendations from the different workers and ended up ordering: clam pasta, organic fried chicken, roasted bone marrow, burrata whipped potatoes, and the city salad. \n\nClam Pasta:\nThis was an extremely light pasta dish that was extremely mild in flavor. The pasta was made from a vegetable which I cannot remember for the life of me since this review is long overdue. It contained a lot of other veggies such as pearl onions and topped with greens. The clams were as fresh as can be, but the overall impression of this dish was not very strong. It wasn't a bad dish by any means, but it was a weak introduction to our meal. \n\nOrganic Fried Chicken:\nThe restaurant claimed to have some of the best fried chicken in America and I was disappointed. Although the exterior was crispy enough, the breast was very dry. The dark meats tasted delicious enough, but dark meat tends to be a lot more forgiving and if a restaurant claims to have the best friend chicken, I expect the more difficult aspects of the dish to stand out more. The fried chicken wasn't horrible, but it didn't live up to the name.\n\nRoasted Bone Marrow:\nI seem to always be getting bone marrow but I'm never let down when I order this dish. It came with some big pieces of crispy pork belly. The flavors from the blueberries and the herbs were impactful but worked well together. Although I've had bone marrow time and time again, it was my first time trying it with blueberries and I was pleased with hoe the dish came out as a hole.\n\nBurrata Whipped Potatoes:\nThis dish was recommended to me by the hostess and I'm extremely glad I listed. This dish was light and fluffy yet very flavorful. It has the texture of a cloud because of the burrata, which has a light airy delicate texture, but was seasoned well enough to make every aspect of the dish stand out. It's such a simple dish that was executed well. \n\nCity Salad:\nThis salad is one of the best salads that I've ever had and is hands down in my opinion the best dish that was ordered at this restaurant. The different flavors from the vinaigrette, fruits and greens harmonize perfectly to elevate the dish as a hole and texture was added to this dish in the form of wheat berries. There were different components to this dish that provided just the right amount of sweetness and acidity and I just can't emphasize how much I love this dish. I highly highly recommend getting this salad when visiting this establishment because you definitely will not regret it.", "author": "Sue P."}

The city salad was not overly dressed, fresh and crunchy. I almost always order my dressing on the side since most places are heavy handed. Not today! I don't know what the salads are like with protein mixed in because I had my salmon on the side. My friend is a vegetarian and I didn't want any cross contamination. I think I just might order all of my salads here this way because I had an adorable tiny cast iron pan that my salmon arrived in. The skin was perfectly fried to a light crisp, while the filet itself was not only softly flaky but so buttery as well. \n\nThe polenta fries were served with a punchy sauce romesco. I think these did us in because they were so much heavier than we expected. \n\nLastly, how could I forget the popovers...! They're served from a basket and placed onto your plate. Eat them immediately because that will be when the butter melts into the fluffy, doughy layers of the popover. It's always such a nice touch when they left the domed lid of the butter dish.

Don't judge us.  Money ain't the issue, we were just .. hungry.  Let me paint you a picture of why I say it's snobby.  We sat in the back near the fireplace by the register, where the waiters are grabbing additional plates and spoons etc.  Each time we tried to get ready to order, or even towards the end when we wanted the check, our waiter would be pacing back and forth to the register literally 12 inches away from us, he wouldn't even look at us.  He didn't pay any attention to us.  Rather rude don't you think?  But of course, as he delivers our food, in which takes quite some time at that he's rather jolly af.  By the way we had a clear shot of the kitchen in which staff were constantly walking around in a circle not making uses of their time.  Poor staffing in my opinion for this type of restaurant.\n\nMy girls ordered some drinks, and they were heavily on the alcohol.  I'm rather glad I didn't order anything from there, because I'd just probably spit it out.  But that's just me, if you like the liquor taste and like the heavy on the alcohol perfect for you.  \n\nFood here is well.. decent.  I wouldn't say it was amazing, but it wasn't terrible at that either. \n\n1. Prime Beef Tartare:  Paired with potato chips and topped with an egg yolk.  Honestly, I munched on the chips more than the tartare.  The tartare though it was cut and nicely plated - the flavoring was just... not that great.  It wasn't enough flavoring, rather bland.\n\n2. Petaluma Farms Deviled Eggs:  The deviled eggs weren't bad, but they weren't spectacular either.  I probably make better deviled eggs at home.\n\n3. Organic Fried Chicken:  You're given one of each: Breast, thigh, leg, and wing.  Though the chicken was kind of moist, it didn't have that great of a flavor.  It was just battered.  Nothing fancy, can't say that I would honestly rather gone to KFC or Popeyes to get a bucket of chicken. \n\n4. Pappardelle:  The pasta here was actually not that bad.  I like the flavors of it.  Though it doesn't look like a lot, it was filling for myself.  It wasn't too bad.  The carrots could've been cooked and soften a little longer, but other than that no complaints here.\n\nOverall, I don't think this restaurant is for me.  For the price, for the service, or even for the quality in food.  Just not worth it whatsoever.  The only thing I honestly enjoyed was the look of the restaurant.  It was just so nicely decorated.  Other than that, it's whatever.", "author": "Nhu-Quynh N."}

Totally regretted it though. Finish or have a friend finish for you!\n\nI have also tried their pulled pork sandwich with side salad. Loved the salad.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-06", "description": "Yes, it's a restaurant driven by a TV celebrity chef, but one that measures up, even here in the discerning Bay Area. The atmosphere is classic and boisterous, like an old-school club dining room and bar, and there is a seriously touristy element here.\n\nNevertheless, the portions are gigantic and the quality and taste evident. Their \"best in America\" organic fried chicken does live up to the hype. It's a huge heap of chicken that's fried perfectly lightly and breaded incredibly deliciously, with a hint of spices in there. Like other entrees here, don't be turned off by the sticker prices. They're actually quite reasonable by West Bay standards given all that you get.\n\nOn that note, I was already quite full from the chicken, but I'd skipped appetizers in order to save room for dessert after eyeing what other folks were having. The brownie sundae (vanilla bean ice cream, valrhona fudge brownie, toffee sauce, candied pistachio, macerated cherries) didn't disappoint. It was a gigantic, gooey, sweet heap of goodness, reminiscent of over-the-top sundaes you'd get from ice cream fountains of yore.\n\nService is also amazingly friendly and engaging, again in an old-school, New York steakhouse or Italian restaurant sort of way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-22", "description": "A-Ok- nothing terrible about it but nothing particularly stellar either (maybe I just don't eat a lot of heavy things)\n\nVenue: a bit on the dark side (especially because the walls are of dark wood and brick, with some taxidermied animals hanging from the walls.  Seats are a bit close to each other; my bf and I were kinda shoved in the corner but didn't mind it so much.  Tables are a bit on the small side such that it was slightly difficult to fit all our plates on the table.\n\nService: all-in-all service was fine, though I've heard of a few instances where people made reservations and still had to wait 30+ min to be seated.  We waited maybe around 10 min for our 9pm weekday reservation and luckily there were seats by the bar so we could order something.  Waitstaff were very friendly and came frequently enough to refill waters and clear out plates as soon as we were done.  It was slightly inconvenient since our waiter must have finished his shift while we were eating and so no one thought to come by and check in on us at the end; we literally had to wave someone down to get our check. \n\nFood: to be fair, I don't have a lot of American/ Southern food, so Wayfare isn't completely my style.  That being said, there were a few highlights from the meal.\n-- ROASTED BONE MARROW (short rib, blackberries, watercress)($18) - very very rich appetizer.  Recommended by our waiter.  The short rib was an interesting addition to the marrow, adding a level of juiciness and a bit of texture to the otherwise mushy marrow and the blackberries provided a nice acidity.  Would comment that they didn't give enough crostinis for the bone marrow, unless you pile each piece of toast a mile high with bone marrow, which was a bit of an overkill.  My bf and I had trouble sharing this, so consider sharing this among 3 people, especially if you plan to have a heavy entree.  \n\n-- CITY SALAD (Granny Smith apple, wheat berry, red quinoa, blueberry,\npickled red onion, mustard vinaigrette)($18 + $10 for fried chicken topping) - to counter the bone marrow (see above), I went with the salad topped with their famous fried chicken.  I was pleasantly surprised with how good the salad was; in particular the mustard vinaigrette lightened up the dish.  As for the fried chicken, it reminded me more of a baked chicken breast/ thigh.  While it was very juicy, the coating kinda slid off the meat and overall was a bit on the blander side.  For all the hype of the fried chicken, perhaps I expected more from it, even a little bit of heat (which I usually don't look for), but it needed something extra to make it special.  The whole salad was a bit on the larger side; I could only finish half of it.  Maybe part of that was because I had the bone marrow before, but still.  \n\n-- AKAROA KING SALMON (Belgium endive, roasted parsnip, huckleberry gastrique)($29) - my date got this dish and I must say, the one thing we both loved about it was how crispy the salmon skin was.  Probably one of the best salmon skins I've had in a while- super crispy and not oily or soggy at all.  Not used to huckleberry, but it was an interesting touch to the dish.\n\nOverall, there weren't too many things that made the experience terrible.  But I wasn't necessarily wow'ed either.  Perhaps service could have been tightened.  Perhaps the dishes could have been a bit more thought out.  Wouldn't be my first choice on places to go for dinner, but if someone asked me for recs on American, Southern restaurants with big hearty dishes, I'd perhaps add this to the long list of other spots to try out.", "author": "Audrey H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-23", "description": "Founded by celebrity chef Tyler Florence, Wayfare Tavern is a great place to go to only if you have reservations because this gastropub with a British meets California influence can get quite crowded, even for a Wednesday night, due to the fact that for almost ten years they've been dishing out their \"ridiculously good fried chicken\" and other Southern inspired seasonal must-haves like baked macaroni and cheese and deviled eggs. We came to Wayfare Tavern on this warm Wednesday evening and thankfully a friend made sure to make reservations ahead of time because the place was packed due to their well-known popularity and on top of it being the final night of 2018 San Francisco Restaurant Week and the deal they were offering was too good to pass up. For forty dollars you got a salad, their patented fried chicken entree and a dessert.\n\nWayfare Tavern is two level restaurant that resembles a intimate lodge right up to its extensive amounts of dark wood the ceilings, walls and floors as well as the leather finishes and even large amounts of taxidermy  hanging on the walls. Upon sitting sitting down to our table upstairs, we noticed the menus they put on our table were not the special restaurant week menu, so we made sure to ask our server Chelsea to bring them out. She did tell us that in order to qualify for the deal, the caveat was that everyone at our table had to order the special pre-fix.\n\nWe were all down for the Butter Lettuce Salad with Brokaw Farms avocado, winter citrus, garden radish topped with Green Goddess Dressing, their signature Organic Fried Chicken tossed in buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herbs and lemon, and their dessert of a Chocolate Cream Pie made with TCHO chocolate pudding, salted caramel ganache. For forty dollars, that's a deal you cannot beat. Our server recommended we get a few sides to compliment our meal, since they were meant to be shared family style. So by consensus, we went with their Baked Macaroni & Cheese with smoked olive oil and chives, the Brussels Sprouts served with fennel sausage and bosc pear butter and the Burrata Whipped Potatoes with olive oil and chives. \n\nWayfare Tavern is the go-to destination for California-style fried chicken and it was as good as advertised thanks to their intense overnight cooking process. They place all three pieces they serve you including the breast, leg, and wing into a Cyrovac machine that seals the chicken and marinades it in an airtight bag, then it's sous vide, rested overnight, washed in buttermilk, and then dipped in a family recipe flour mixture before hitting the fryer. Thanks to that technique, mixed with some spices, the chicken comes out perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, with I must admit my wing piece being the only exception as that was ironically a wee bit on the dry side. I loved the sides as well, especially the richness of the Brussels Sprouts and Mashed Potatoes. The dessert was surprisingly unoriginal but tasted very comforting. I also got a cocktail, the French Theatre which combined gin, liqueur, lemon and rose and it paired with my three course meal sublimely. For those who couldn't finish their meal, they have a unique system where they pack up your food for you and give you a claim ticket to pick it up at the hostess desk downstairs. Now that's service with a purpose.\n\nI remember when Wayfare Tavern first opened and Tyler Florence walked from table to table greeting his diners. Those days may be over, but the character of Wayfare has remained just as lovely as when they began, if still as over-crowded as ever, thanks to their great dishes and attentive service. I'd come back in a heartbeat for that Fried Chicken, especially with a deal as generous as they provide during Restaurant Week. It's as homey and inviting as their interior belies.", "author": "Jason F."}

After visiting a nearby business for work, I was looking for a good meal in downtown SF and I honestly Yelp came through yet again! Yes, I have heard of Tyler Florence's epic restaurants before and of course of the \"famous\" Wayfare Tavern burger, but it was time to put the hype to the test. \n\nShowed up around 12:30ish on a weekday and had a short 10 minute wait, but was seated promptly at the bar where I could watch the magic in the kitchen. Had a few recommendations from the waiter, but I had my eyes set on the burger regardless of the high reviews of the fried chicken. I will reiterate, if you can sit at the bar, do so as it makes the experience that much better. Anyways, back to the service and meal! I was brought out this odd shaped muffin, bread and honestly had no clue what it was. They referred to it as a popover, and it was pure heaven! It was a mix between a croissant texture and fluffiness and the taste of some wonderful light buttered bread. Burger arrived shortly after me devouring the monster of a popover and it looked like many other fancy burgers, buttered brioche bun, fancy melted cheese, side of fries and veges. Do not and I will say again do not let it fool you. I wish I could come up with some shakespeare level description of the burger, but to cut to the chase, one of the better burgers I have had in quite some time! Cheap meal, not necessarily as I recall the burger being over $15, but it was so worth it!\n\nTo sum it up, this is not a go to for me if I am nearby and craving a good burger, so maybe some other delicious meals they were slinging out!", "author": "Ryan A."}

LOL. My coworkers and I ended up trying this place to celebrate my bday/a coworker leaving. I would recommend booking in advance though. I called in a week ahead and was lucky to have the options of 11:30AM or 1:30PM. \n\nFOOD: \n\n* They give you complimentary bread as you wait for your order. When you get it you just think it's a big ball that would be light, but it was actually more dense than we anticipated. It seems like it was more of an egg-y type of bread. They also have small plates of salted butter on the table for the bread. \n\n- Fried Chicken ($26) - OKAY so this baby is definitely something to share between 2 people. It's served a la carte so they don't have any sides with the dish. Because of this I thought it would be a small portion but MAN OH MAN was I wrong. With the dish they give you about 5 pieces of chicken which was more than enough for 2 meals. I enjoyed that they have some salt/pepper on the side to add to your chicken if you need more flavoring. The chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and nice and tender on the inside. It also WASN'T OILY AT ALL. Once you squeezed the lemon over it, you can understand why it was voted best fried chicken. I will say though that it's not the same when you try to reheat the leftovers. Even after putting it in the oven for a good amount of time the skin was just not the same.  \n\n- Mac N Cheese ($11) - I thought it was tasty, but nothing too special in my opinion. It was a big enough portion to share between 2 people. It was creamy but not gooey in the way I anticipated it to be. The pasta was also over cooked in my opinion and became mushy vs. holding up well with the cheese. \n\n- Doughnuts ($11) - A coworker asked if they offer anything free for it being someone's bday or a special occasion and unfortunately they don't. It was worth a shot, so we just ended up getting this dish to compensate! lol. This dish was delicious! They give you 2 fluffy doughnuts/holes that you can easily share with the table. They pair it with a whipped cream cheese on a side w/ a fruit compote. They were nice/airy/not oily either so we didn't feel as bad eating these. \n\nSERVICE: I enjoyed that the waiters came around to make sure we had the right utensils, waters filled, and needed anything else. Our waiter also seemed to know stuff about our convos like a coworker was leaving and said good luck on his next role. We were so shocked because they definitely weren't close to our table. It was one of those things where it's kinda of creepy but also a testament to great service and kind of knowing more than they should. LOL. Also, if you have leftovers they give you a ticket and you pick it up in the front. I liked this because i'm the type of person who forgets my leftovers at the table.\n\nOVERALL: This is one of those places that I will come to on special occasions because after tax + tip + SF mandate we each paid around $50 a person.", "author": "Keizzel C."}

We had an issue with our order when we were there most recently. We ordered scallops and received salmon. There were apparently no scallops left. Our waiter was extremely apologetic and offered a substitute as well as the dish taken off of our bill. We stuck with the salmon, which was great. We shared the salmon and fried chicken. It's great to get a little taste of both. The friend chicken is second to none, and the salmon was perfectly prepared. I question whether there were ever scallops that day, as we arrived very early, just before 5pm, in order to make a Sunday show at the Orpheum after. Our waiter was excellent, he timed out the meal so we were neither rushed nor late. We arrived to our show right on time. \n\nI have a hard time resisting donuts, so my table of three shared the donut dessert. It is so delicious!The donuts are small and served warm, with tasty dipping sauces (and more herbs!) on the side. I could've eaten the whole thing, but I'm always glad I shared. I can't imagine there's a better dessert on the menu, but maybe one day I'll cheat on the donuts. \n\nWhile I didn't order wine or cocktails for fear of falling asleep at the theater, but I have tried a cocktail here in the past.

Since it seemed like a very popular restaurant on Yelp, I decided to make reservations on OpenTable and in the notes, I mentioned that it was my friend's birthday. She was surprised with a birthday card at our table. \n\nMy friend ordered a grapefruit drink, which was supposed to be mixed with gin, but she substituted it was vodka. It was quite strong, but refreshing at the same time.\n\nThe complimentary popovers (bread) was the HIGHLIGHT of the meal. Imagine a better version of the best croissant you have ever had, but even better. The butter that came with the bread was smooth and easy to spread. It melted right when you spread it on the popovers. And the best part is it's UNLIMITED.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nBEEF TARTARE - This was delicious. If you know what a Chinese pork bun tastes like, it tastes exactly like the pork filling, probably because of the green onions and other spices. The portion size was pretty big for an appetizer. We were also able to get more chips. \n\nPORK CHOP (~$30) - This is one of the juiciest pork chops I've ever had. I wouldn't think that such a thick piece of meat could be so flavorful. The risotto it came with was delicious as well.\n\nFRIED CHICKEN (~$26) - This dish was one of the most popular among Yelpers, so I had to try it. It was good fried chicken, but didn't live up to the hype for me. Don't get me wrong though; it was a really food fried chicken.\n\nMAC AND CHEESE (~$15) - I really enjoyed this dish. It's probably one of the best baked mac and cheeses I have ever had. It was rich and creamy, but not overwhelming. To be honest, I would've been happy with this as a main course, despite it being a side dish. This had pretty big portions for it just being a side dish. \n\nThe service was great too. When we got the rest of our food togo, we were given a claim ticket for our togo, which we gave to the hostess on our way out and received of togo bag.

Based on the reviews and the prices...I was expecting better. The food wasn't bad and in some cases (bone marrow, squash and the doughnuts dessert) was excellent. Probably would give the food 4 stars, but the service dragged it down. Wait...except for the oysters. Wow. $56 for a dozen of the smallest, most mediocre oysters I've ever had.  Service alone would have been a 1 star at best.\n\n20 minutes after we were seated we still hadn't had anyone bring popovers or take a drink order. I had to get up and find somebody to come help us. Should have been a tip-off to what we'd experience the rest of the night. A place that charges these prices needs to have far better service. Complete mismatch. We had 2 waiters who really didn't add up to 1. We got one round of popovers when we finally flagged someone down. That was it. We asked for more. We were promised more. None ever came. It became the running joke at our table. What will happen first...meteor striking earth or us getting more popovers? All bets were on the meteor.\n\nSo much potential here and from the look of so many great reviews--maybe so much greatness in the past. Not tonight. Not a place I'll go back to in a city with so many options that deliver consistently. For $375 for 4, we should have had a much, much better experience all the way around.

I highly recommend bar seating on weekends because this place is always packed, but the bar is full service, and you always get attention quicker there anyway. The popovers are still hot and fresh and served with silken sea salt butter. The burger is still a behemoth that comes with a side of (beef fat?) fries and a whole freaking avocado for $2. What a win. I actually think their fresh ground chuck actually beats out everyone's favorite in the fried chicken, but I'll leave that to you. Beers come in huge 20oz+ glasses or a regular pint, which you don't see at most fancy joints, and cocktails are still strong. The only issue we had with dinner was the bone marrow. The bread was hard and grilled for too long, and the addition of blueberries to a savory dish like that was not a complimentary taste. Otherwise, good times had by all.", "author": "Danny C."}

Modern, rustic, and very nicely decorated. Cute date night spot or  business meal location.\n\nStaff: Our waitress greeted us with a birthday card (I noted a birthday in my OpenTable reservation) and was excellent throughout the entire meal. We did have a couple mix ups in which a coffee was served up to our table right after we sat down and a couple starters were also mistakenly sent to us at another point in our meal. There was definitely some miscommunication going on, which disrupted the flow of the meal, but wasn't a big deal.\n\nDrinks: I ordered one of the pinot noirs from the \"by the glass\" menu and it was amazing. Not too sweet and not too dry. My sister ordered the cucumber mule. A very refreshing take one of my usual go-to's. My dad ordered one of their fancy grape juices, which he was quite impressed by (he doesn't drink). My mom ordered the mint lemonade which was also a nice refreshing take on a classic.\n\nFood: My mom and I ordered the fried chicken, my sister ordered the pasta, and my dad ordered the salmon. We also ordered the whipped potatoes, the mushrooms, and the mac 'n cheese to share. The fried chicken was solid and definitely lived up to the hype. Perfectly seasoned and nice and crispy. My dad's salmon dish was solid, but he preferred some of my mom's fried chicken. My sister's pasta dish was also quite delicious. The whipped potatoes and mushrooms were pretty good, but not exceptional. The mac 'n cheese was definitely my side dish of choice. \n\nPrice: Definitely a special occasions spot. Let's just say, I'm glad it was a birthday dinner and my parents were treating :)\n\nWould I return? Oh I would love an excuse to splurge again. I would definitely get the fried chicken and mac 'n cheese!", "author": "Leana L."}

I recently returned for dinner with coworkers and felt everything was pretty average and not as great as when it first opened. \n\nWe ordered a bit too much:\n- Deviled Eggs: one of my coworkers loved this but I felt I've had better deviled eggs elsewhere. I thought the filling was just too much for one bite\n+ Beef Tartare: a typical beef tartare, but I quite liked it especially with the chips as the base.\n- Heirloom Tomato Salad: meh I would pass nothing special about this dish, although it was nice and refreshing\n- Burrata Toast: this was also a pretty average dish. I thought it was a bit too sweet for my taste, but not bad\n- City Salad w/ Fried Chicken: Again another average dish. Fried chicken was pretty good but salad was pretty average.\n++ Truffled Polenta Fries: oh man this is probably my favorite from what we ordered. it was just a side but really wish we ordered my own so i didn't have to share :)\n- Baked Mac & Cheese: by this point we were pretty full, but this dish was a good side. not the best mac & cheese dish I've had but solid\n\nOf course you must get the Popover! This is one of my favorite parts of the experience. Once you finish make sure to get another one lol.\n\nOverall the service was not bad.

It doesn't need to be extraordinarily pretentious - it has to be the best version of itself. His Wayfarer Tavern menu reflects those sentiments. \n\nI was in SF on an extremely last-minute weekend trip, and was delighted that I was able to score a reservation, even if it was a little later than I preferred (9:30). Staying in the Financial District, WT was a super short Lyft ride away from our hotel, we could have walked if it weren't for my shoe choice. \n\nWe were seated promptly in a cozy booth on the ground floor beside the chef's counter. Not one but two servers asked for our drink orders, the latter wanted to make sure we were being taken care of. I went with a Hendrick's Cucumber Mule which was delightful, and not lacking in the gin department. My husband had an Allagash White - one of his favorite brews that we are unable to enjoy in Nevada. We ordered Fried Chicken, the roasted cauliflower, and mac and cheese with smoked olive oil. I got a slice of chocolate pie to go. \n\nThe chicken was very good - perhaps a little saltier than I would have preferred, but the fresh lemon really made the flavors pop. I was surprised at just how much chicken you got - I wasn't able to finish it all but my husband managed. I wasn't sure the proper etiquette for eating wings and drumsticks, but I went with the old fashioned hands-on approach. No one fainted, so I guess that was acceptable. \n\nThe popovers were wonderful, the butter was a smidge too salty, but toned down by the rich bread. My husband wasn't too keen to share his cauliflower, but the bites I managed to swipe were very good. The mac and cheese was okay - I wasn't as crazy about the smoked olive oil, and the topping was very salty. I wished I would have gone with the brussels sprout panzanella  instead. \n\nThe chocolate pie I took back to the hotel - the whipped cream was over-whipped, it was very close to being butter, but the chocolate pudding was divine. \n\nAs I'm unsure what is going to happen in March '17 with The Sequoia bar (transition over to this new venture? Or is it just in addition to Wayfare?) I'm glad I finally got the opportunity to dine here. I'll look forward to The Sequoia on my next trip to San Francisco.", "author": "Ranae W."}

Although the restaurant was still completely empty, we were told that we snagged the last available table. True enough, it seemed all the other seats were reserved, as the dining hall quickly filled up in the next half hour. We both felt super out of place since everyone else was dressed in business casual - probably FiDi people off on lunch break. Meanwhile, I was rocking a plain white tee and my favorite Uniqlo hoodie. Real classy.\n\n// Popover (complimentary) - 5 stars\nDelicious! The popover was soft like Yorkshire pudding, which I absolutely love.\n\n// Petaluma Farms Deviled Eggs ($14) - 4 stars\nOne order gets you six half eggs topped with a rich creamy filling. They were really good, but I couldn't finish my fair share since they were quite heavy.\n\n// Organic Fried Chicken ($26) - 3 stars\nDespite all the rave, the fried chicken here was just average. The only sauce it comes with is a lemon wedge, which would have been acceptable if the chicken were overflowing with juices, which it wasn't.\n\n// The Tavern Burger ($22) - 3 stars\nExtremely filling as the burger was loaded with so much fats: bacon, brie, and brioche buns. Still, this didn't really knock my socks off, which it should have considering the hefty price point.\n\n// Brussels Sprout Panzanella ($9) - 4 stars\nI enjoyed how the sprouts were coated in a tangy cranberry glaze.

We started off with their mint lemonade, which i loved so much i had two glasses. We had complimentary popover bread as well, which was deliciously fresh with the soft butter they provided. Our waters kept getting refilled without us asking, too. Every dish was surprisingly solid, nothing tasted bad, but in fact super delicious.\n\n- prime rib tartare: paired with chips, which gave it a great pair in texture and flavor. Flavor was on point.\n- Petaluma farms deviled eggs: never a bad choice, bacon could be crispier and less hard. Comes with 6.\n- calamari: the sauce and flavor was delicious! The calamari isn't fried like usual but the flavor was amazing and worth ordering.\n- roasted bone marrow: one of my favorite appetizers! Not your usual bone marrow but it seems to have had beef bits cooked into the marrow and placed back into the bone with blackberries on top. There was a kick of blackberry flavor to the bone marrow which went together exquisitely! I'd definitely order again when i come. Also comes with pieces of bread.\n- organic fried chicken: delicious! The batter wasn't too heavy on the chicken and the meat was quite soft. Totally worth ordering but not the worlds best fried chicken imo.\n- tavern burger: beef was a bit dry, but the way the patty was put together made the texture intriguing to eat. We also ordered egg to be on the burger but didn't receive it :( \n- baked macaroni and cheese: this was good, nothing special, but made with the perfect amount of cheese.\n- truffled Parmesan polenta fries: this was also surprisingly delicious, especially that dipping sauce it came with. Definitely worth ordering\n- Brussels sprouts: not bitter, which is a win anytime i order this. Not bad, but nothing special. However, i consider it solid enough to tell someone to order if they were on the fence.\n- homemade doughnuts: not usually a doughnuts fan, but these were freshly warm and so soft that i forced myself to eat all of it because it was too good to waste. Had chocolate to dip it in, raspberry jam, and creme fraiche - all delicious to dip the doughnuts in.\n\nI think the meal was around $270 for 4 people, but worth it because i didn't come across a bad dish.

The restaurant can be pretty loud but they have an upstairs which is a bit quieter. Service was super attentive and quick.\n\nI loved the free bread and butter. The bread is freshly baked and the butter is whipped and smooth. They were nice enough to ask us if we wanted a second serving. Our group shared the prime beef tartare ($17) to start. The beef was fresh and served with potato chips. The ratio of chips to tartare was off so we had to ask for more chips. I would recommend this if you're planning to share with a large group. Otherwise there is a lot of tartare and it can be kind of overwhelming.\n\nThe tavern burger with egg ($24) was amazing and my favorite part of the meal! The meat is super flavorful and the brioche bun was tasty. Plus that the burger comes with fries! I also highly recommend the popular fried chicken ($26). It was perfectly crispy and I loved the rosemary flavor.  Lastly the fresh burrata and pears ($15) was good but slightly too sweet for me.", "author": "Linda X."}

The fried chicken was excellent. My son and I should have shared a serving. The burrata whipped potatoes are worth trying as well. \n\nThe one downer of the evening was the waitress. I asked her to recommend one of 3 Shiraz wines in a price range of $50-$60. She went off about how the restaurant was \"gifted\" an amazing Pinot and she thought it was the perfect wine for our meal. She made me ask the price after she went on abound tanins and fruit and whatnot. The answer- $110. Really?

So good! \n\nFirst time coming back since 2011, nearly six-years ago. I still love the feel inside this restaurant. When it first opened it just followed suit with what the restaurant interior trends were: Turn of the century light fixtures, exposed Edison bulbs, Victorian-esque wall paper, taxidermy, reclaimed dark woods. And while most restaurants have moved on to a more minimal, institutionalized, clinical 1930s chic look...Wayfare stands aesthetically strong. I love the inside of this place still.\n\nOrdered the fried chicken (again) $26 | I remember the portion being bigger. I split the order with a girlfriend. Still delicious, just wish the crust was a wee bit thicker. But, I happen to be a crust lovin' mofo. Everything was solid. From the Burrata Whipped Potatoes $9 to the Brussel Sprout Panzanella $9. Doughnuts $11: two come to an order, hot and fresh out the fryer into your mouth. Came with a dipping sauce of (what I think was) pear puree and whipped creme fraiche and a vanilla glaze. Those doughnuts are earth shattering. \n\nOne gripe: One of my girlfriends asked for sparkling water and there was a $7 charge. Like, hot dayum! It came in a carafe, so it's obvious they have one of those filtration systems that provides sparkling water. Usually restaurants will inquire if you prefer still or sparkling and won't charge you for either.\n\nParking can be found on weekends, but forget it on weekdays. There are a few lots nearby. They have valet service, but only in the evenings and it's $12. Clean and roomy single user bathrooms. Very nice service.

So I walked in all sweaty and gross after several hours or playing tourist. I had on my t-shirt, shorts, and running shoes and looked and felt a bit out of place. If I hadn't walked that far to get there I might have turned around. Anyway, while I waited for a table, I managed to sneak to the restroom and throw on a fresh shirt and some axe body spray that I keep for such emergencies. I came out looking and feeling a little better but I was expecting the worst. \n\nI got seated pretty quickly for a Friday night and within minutes had several very friendly staff members tend to me. The customer service was phenomenal. I've been to far pricier and more extravagant restaurants (while dressed better and smelling a lot better) where I didn't get treated this well. Jenny was my waitress and she made me feel right at home along with the rest of the staff. \n\nAfter walking around for 3 straight days I was ready for comfort food so I ordered the fried chicken, the whipped potatoes, and a pint of pilsner. The beer was extra cold, the chicken was perfectly brined and fried (I seriously don't know if you can get better chicken), and the potatoes were excellent as well. I sat along the bar facing the kitchen and I have to say that everything else looked amazing too. \n\nThe atmosphere is darker and has an intimate feel to it but it's still pretty lively when it's packed. It makes for a great date night place (my apologies to the couple next to me) as they have lots of great shareable starters and apps, and a great wine list too. Again, I can't say enough about their chicken. I wouldn't hesitate to come back and work my way through the rest of the menu either. I just might have to try. But seriously.. just get the chicken!

Initially I had tried to make reservations on the day of via telephone but was told there was no availability, so I went through Open Table with success.  My group encountered traffic getting from Union Square to the restaurant, so we called to change the reservation time and were accommodated.  \nWe were seated in the covered booth, which was cozy and private.\nWe ordered the deviled eggs as an appetizer.  It came with 6 eggs.  They were just okay--I found the pickled flavor a bit too overwhelming and the applewood bacon was scant.\nMy parents & I got the fried chicken while my boyfriend opted for the burger. The chicken was AMAZING--expertly seasoned & juicy. My boyfriend found the burger to be too greasy, but he was able to enjoy my chicken since the portions were so generous. (Each order came with 4 pieces: a drumstick, wing, breast, & thigh). My parents got the mashed potatoes as a side & I chose the macaroni. Both were excellent.\nWe got 3 desserts: the berry-apple cobbler, vanilla bean ricotta cheesecake, & donuts. Each was delightful. My cheesecake was the best I'd ever had & the accompanying creamsicle ice cream was fantastic.\nThe food was superb and made up for the lackluster server. He seemed overwhelmed & at one point snapped at my mom when she asked 20 minutes after ordering (and about 40 minutes after being seated) if bread would be coming that he was \"doing everything\". He disagreed with my mom that she had ordered a different salad than she had and told my parents that they really shouldn't be changing the preset ice cream flavor that came with their dessert. We were grateful when other staff visited our table. The impeccably dressed man who took our leftovers to be packaged was so charming and the gentleman who delivered our desserts was so fun and exciting.\nOverall it was a very nice experience and we would certainly come again.

Yes, they had the cute little seasonings on the side, but the fry should have something a little extra (in my opinion). The mashed potatoes were very good. The macaroni also lacked in flavor.

I wasn't served raw chicken this time but the service was just horrific. For $20-$30 an entree, c'mon guys, get it together! My husband booked a reservation for us for dinner because it was on the Restaurant Week list. He actually picked the place because he had never been. \n\nCouple of things:\n- If you grab a drink at the bar because your table is not ready, be expected to close out the tab because \"the bar and the restaurant are separate\". Now, in my mind, many restaurants in SF allow you to just charge your bar drinks to the table. I went to Palm House this weekend and they even hand carried our drinks to our table. If you have to make us wait and pay for expensive drinks at the bar, at least make it easier for us all together. They may be a good valid reason here but not that the hostess explained to me. She just rudely said we could not be seated until our tab was closed and watched us as a hawk until it happened.\n- The bartenders were talking to each other before you have to cough or wave to get their attention. Drinks are expensive.\n- The tables are tight if you are not in a booth. If you move the table at all, they will move it back. I could reach out and touch the table and diners next to me. I definitely could hear their conversations and it just was not a pleasant romantic evening when you can hear the person next to you moreso than the person across the table from you. It sucked and we even thought about leaving before the menus came because we had a good 10 minute delay before we got our menu and water.\n- You have to ask for the restaurant week information and they stress a million times that the dishes are on the menu. No separate menu or nothing. Also, if you want to get the restaurant menu option (and price), the whole table has to get it. Again, hate comparing, but I just went to Palm House this weekend and half the table got the Restaurant week menu and the other half ordered ala carte. It is just nicer of a place to offer flexibility for its diners IMO.\n- The food is okay. The only thing worth getting is the fried chicken but it doesn't come with anything so you have to order an expensive side so you are looking at $26 for the chicken + $6 side, making it a $32 entree which is actually okay for me if only the service and dining experience was worthy of it.\n\nI won't be going back and my husband finally gets it now.", "author": "Cicely T."}

The service was rotten and the food was unbelievably mediocre. The fried chicken was billed as the best in the world, and that was utter hogwash. Kentucky Fried Chicken is better. Popeyes is better. Palmetto Pig is light years better. They kept talking about this four-step secret process that includes buttermilk brine. Wow, no Omaha hausfrau ever thought of that after watching Rachel Ray. \n\nLet's talk service. We walked in, got a seat, made a drink order, and didn't see a waiter for 45 minutes after that. Our drinks went empty repeatedly. It took forever to order food and even longer to get said food. I finally called over another waiter and asked him WTF was going on and where our waiter was. \n\nEater bills this place as \"super exclusive\". Yeah, keep telling yourself that. You could get the same service by going to KFC after they close, turn the lights off, and eat stale fried chicken from earlier in the day by yourself. \n\nWe have places like this in Chicago, and they generally feature self-important toolboxes convincing themselves that they're important for eating here.

We had reservations at 8:15pm (arriving at 8pm) and by 8:50pm still had not been sat so we left.\n\nIf the restaurant management had been proactive or made any attempts to be conciliatory, it would've been fine, but the hostess was rude and unapologetic to my wife the few times that we proactively checked back. She then sat two groups of the same size ahead of us without explanation so we gave up and left.\n\nHaving spent nearly an hour at the bar waiting our party spent about $100 on drinks which now really bothers me. The bartenders were professional and friendly, but they were too busy to read the situation and I didn't want to make a scene.\n\nMy wife had a poor experience here before and was going in open-minded as she knew this was one of my favorite restaurants, but after last night it'll be difficult to return.

We showed up on New Years Eve, no reservations, and the place was packed! We had never been here and thought this was a bar by the sound of it. Although all the tables were reserved, we found a lil table outside and sat down under a heater which kept us incredibly toasty, despite the frigid temps outside! While we only came for a drink, we couldn't resist ordering some appetizers off of the menu. Upon ordering we were greeted by another gentleman who supplied us with complimentary popovers and let me tell you, they did not disappoint! I didn't even want the appetizers we ordered after eating the popover. I just wanted 5 more popovers and the ridiculous whipped butter that accompanied it. Once our appetizers arrived (Brussels sprouts and polenta fries), I basically died and went to heaven. These Brussels sprouts had this decadent sauce and pieces of sausage throughout. Truly amazing! The polenta fries were better than any other I had ever had. Cooked perfectly and incredible fluffy and addictive. Holy moly we were in complete bliss. After two rounds of drinks and appetizers, the waitress brought out another round of popovers after our check arrived because we could not stop raving about them! Wayfare Tavern stole our hearts and our appetites and left us with the best start to our New Years Eve celebration! I can't say enough wonderful things about this restaurant and I'm so in love with our experience we had here.

They had both been before and said I would be in for a treat. They had made a reservation and we were seated in a crowded restaurant, even at 2pm on a Friday.\n\nTo start off the meal, we decided to go with an order of the deviled eggs and burrata.\n\nI don't know if I am super hard to please when it comes to deviled eggs, but I was very underwhelmed by this rendition. Felt like I have made better ones myself.\n\nThankfully, the rest of the meal was a step up.\n\nThe burrata was very tasty--and unlike other places that I have had this dish at, this one featured fruit with it, which provided a nice bit especially with their fresh bread.\n\nSpeaking of bread, the popovers that they serve are excellent and are so buttery and flaky--definitely didn't need it after the burrata, but couldn't say no.\n\nFor my main meal I got their fish special, which I believe was a swordfish that particular day. Whatever it was, it was very tasty and a good portion size as well.\n\nI was also lucky enough to try a piece of my aunt's fried chicken, and that was delicious too.\n\nOverall, this place has a great vibe and serves up some quality food.

Several of us knew from prior experience that this wasn't true. But we just accepted staying in the crowded booth instead. \n\nAs a few entrees were being delivered, the wrong meal was put in front of one of our Trustee guests, and when we inquired about it, the waiter moved the meal over to the correct person and then sarcastically said \"I only have two hands\", then walked away. Amazing disrespect. We all looked at each other in shock. \n\nThen throughout the meal, our main waiter continued to interrupt loudly every time he came over to us, talking over whoever was speaking at our table at the time without pausing to wait for a brief second or two so as not to be rude. I counted three times he did this. \n\nLast but not least, one meal was never delivered after all the others were, and the waiter explained that he forgot to put the order in for it.

Wayfare Tavern has delicious food without a doubt. We both enjoyed the burger with a side of the macaroni and cheese. It was phenomenal unfortunately the service we received lacked. Our server AC completely neglected us our entire visit. If we were lucky enough to flag him down he was condescending and treated us as an inconvenience to him. However another server there Drew was absolutely incredible. We weren't his table but he took time from what he was doing to help us and check on us. At the end of our visit we expressed our irritation to our server and was able to speak with a manager who made sure we left happy, and that was the kind of service we wish would have received in the beginning.", "author": "Alex K."}

But it was a small portion, so for a group of 4 I would consider ordering two of them if that's the only side you get.\n- The desserts, but specifically the donuts. We ordered all of them and they were all excellent, but those were my favorite.\n- Fried chicken. A number of people at the table ordered this and they all enjoyed it.\n\nTHE MISSES\n- I ordered the fish, which was sea bass that day I believe, and thought it was very bland and boring. Plus it was overcooked. Not a fan at all and probably a large reason behind the 3 stars.\n- There was a long wait for our drinks and food and I ordered a second drink that was never delivered to me. There was a large party in the private room next to us, so I think it was likely due to that. I understand these things happen, but at such a nice restaurant it takes away from the experience.

We were caught by total surprise when the billed arrived and the ribeye was $125. This was incredibly upsetting because 1) the price wasn't openly shared with us even when he shared other prices with us (e.g subbing for mashed potatoes costs +$5 2) this is 3x the price of any other entree on the menu and 3) when we asked the manager if they could accommodate anything, they didn't.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-05-20", "description": "I went to Wayfare Tavern for a company lunch this last Tuesday, May 17th at 12 noon. We had a private room on the third floor.\n\n(I'd suggest taking the stairs as the elevator took forever. I think they use it as their freight elevator since they were transporting cases of drinks up and down the restaurant. I had to squeeze into the tiny elevator with a dolly filled with drinks and a guy carrying a huge box of flower centerpieces.)\n\nSince we were doing a private party, we had a prix fixe menu. They were nice enough to print specialty menus for our company luncheon.\n\nStarters:\n*Butter lettuce salad: avocado, caviar, lemon balm\n*Roasted rainbow carrots: burrata, basil, carrot top salsa verde, sunflower seeds\n\nI chose the butter lettuce salad. I love burrata, but I don't like cooked carrots due to the texture and the sweetness that comes out when heated, so I figured the salad was the best choice. It looked nice and simple. Unfortunately, when I saw it, it had pieces of citrus in it. Maybe grapefruit? I don't like fruit in my salad or really any combination of sweet and salty. I know. I'm H to the M (high maintenance), but I wish they listed the ingredients correctly. I didn't see any avocado or caviar either. Maybe this was a misprint as it looks like their regular menu list these ingredients for their deviled eggs? I took two bites and didn't touch the rest of it. It was too salty and sweet.\n\nEntrees:\n*Petite tender roast: asparagus, carrots, red wine jus\n*Wild king salmon: succotash of turnips, fava beans, spring onion\n\nI was contemplating pot roast but I only like my beef rare. Turns out their pot roast starts out sous vide to a medium rare, so I decided to order the salmon. When I asked the server about the sauce for the salmon, he seemed annoyed and didn't seem to actually know. I know I just asked a bunch of questions about the pot roast, but shouldn't you know what comes with your dishes? I expressed that I didn't want the turnips and asked if I could get the salmon cooked on the medium rare side. When I got the fish, there was no sauce and the turnips were there. The fish was cooked nicely in the center, so I ate the middle and the spring onions. I had to add a bunch of salt and pepper to give it flavor since there was no sauce.\n\nDesserts:\n*Carrot cake\n*Chocolate peanut butter bar\n\nI don't like chocolate or cooked carrots, so I skipped dessert. It turned out the carrot cake was listed incorrectly and everyone was offered a coconut cake instead. I know, I'm picky AF since I don't like coconut either.\n\nLooking at their regular lunch menu, it looks like they only have the roasted carrots and burrata dish on that menu, so I understand why the server may not have known all the elements of every dish we got. But his demeanor towards me was a little off putting. I won't hold that against the service as we all still had a great time. And yes, I was that annoying person asking a lot of questions, so it was probably just me.\n\nI'm most disappointed in the fact we had to do a set menu without their signature dishes. Why couldn't we try the fried chicken or the burger? Those are the things I think of when I hear Wayfare Tavern. I don't necessarily think of pot roast or salmon. I know set menus for big parties are required to make things run smoothly, but one would think the selections would be more indicative of the restaurant.\n\nWayfare did a good job with the private room and we all had fun, but I was disappointed in the food. I hate giving Wayfare 2 stars, but I left a little hungry.", "author": "Elena N."}

The 32 oz bone in ribeye.\n\nLet's back track a bit. \n\nWe started with complementary bread, which was warm, and extremely fluffy. Very delicious with their butter. Bread came around again, but I wanted to save room for other foods.\n\nApps: \n+ Beef Tartare - this was really good. One of my favourite apps, so I'm very critical of it, but it's well done here. It's just a bit odd that they mix everything but the egg for you. You do that yourself...\n+ Deviled Eggs - also very delicious. Comes in rounds of 6. It's a very distinct flavour that's a little more unique to this place.\n+ Bone Marrow - Very rich and creamy, as usual. A light horseradish crust on top really gives it a nice flavour.\n\nDrink:\n+ Cucumber Mule (with gin) - a very refreshing drink. Love the cucumber, and love gin, so perfect combo. Well mixed.\n\nEntree: \n+ 32oz Ribeye - Unfortunately this was not cooked evenly across. It was pre-cut too. You can't tell in the picture, but the ones on top, were more like medium/medium well, then the ones the back/below were a bit closer to rare/blue. The cuts with more fat were closer to medium well which makes the meat around it a bit tougher, but the fat is well marbled. Oh well.\n+ Fried chicken (5 pieces), dark and white meat. Their fried chicken lived up to its hype. Very juice and tender, yummy cuz it's fried. Enough said.\n\nDessert:\n+ Donuts - Fresh donuts with a cinnamon sprinkle. I couldn't stomach any more food as I was stuffed at this point. \n\nThe waiter(s) were all in very good spirits and had a great sense of humour.

Even Zuni Cafe doesn't charge as much, and you know the quality is comparable or better\n- The dark meat pieces of fried chicken were outstanding; the white meat pieces were dry and flavorless\n\n\nThe biggest issue, I'm afraid, was....\nSERVICE.\n- Snooty service from a number of the staff, which was surprising. We were dressed as nice or nicer than 99% of the other patrons, we were polite and well mannered, but still got the cold shoulder from a) the host, b) our server, c) the popover runner guy. No idea if it was a race thing or a 'I hate my job' thing, but it was pretty unpleasant\n- When I asked if we could sit in a booth, which another party of 2 was doing, the host stopped, looked at us, and told me the booths were reserved for larger parties. That booth remained empty the entire time we dined there, very bizarre\n- We were seated in the far corner of the restaurant, almost like we were being hidden away? Again, was it a race issue? Did the host not like how either of us looked? No idea, but it was very uncomfortable\n- We don't eat bread (a sad but necessary truth), so when the waiter came by to toss popovers at us, I quickly declined, not wanting to waste food for no reason. He literally rolled his eyes, and started grabbing anything related to bread from the table, including the butter. Then when we had to ask him to leave the butter (keto diet is real, guys), he rolled his eyes again and stormed away after dropping it on the table.\n\nIt was funny and uncomfortable how unpleasant the staff was.

But nonetheless I left with a full stomach and without an ounce of regret. 5 stars for my past experience. \n\nThis time around, I'm so sorry but the food was simply MEHHH. On the other hand, our waitress provided great service and a connectable conversation. \n\nCucumber mint mule: I needed a drink after a busy day at work - quenched my thirst.\n\nHouse Made Popovers with Whipped Butter Spread: I think I came here craving some well made popovers which I enjoyed and wanted seconds.\n\nBeef Tartar With House Kettle Chips: I enjoyed it very much. It was a bit heavy on the capers, but didn't bother me.\n\nMac N Cheese: well made and delicious, and that's all I can say.\n\nSole: my friend who ordered this dish said it was a bit heavy handed on the salt. I took a bite of it and it tasted like that of the sea. Black pepper was continuously added to balance the dish as it was being eaten. \n\nWayfare Burger: my cousin asked for medium rare and what was brought from the kitchen was on the medium side. Our waitress had the kitchen make a second, which was perfect but the bun was over greased. Due to the wait, her appetite was filled with the other dishes at the table and so the burger became a to go meal. \n\nFried Chicken: great seasoning, and classic butter milk recipe. Other than that, I can't say that it was the best fried chicken I've had. \n\nPork Shank: over cooked, tough and chewy or OTC... I enjoyed the apple and cabbage side more so than the actual meat on the plate. I didn't feel like informing our waitress as I did not want to wait. \n\nI left full but disappointed with the meal. I wouldn't say that I'd never return but I don't think Tyler Florence would be happy with what was brought out from his kitchen staff.", "author": "Alex C."}

However, the service was great.  \n\n- Burger: We had to ask for another burger since it wasn't medium well, it was medium. When we got the second burger, the bun was just over greased with butter so it was very difficult to pick it up, my friend's fingers were drenched with butter. \n- Beef tartare: it was okay, a little heavy on the capers and it felt like it needed more sauce since I couldn't taste it at all.\n- Pork Shank: It was on the dry side, and the flavor wasn't there\n- petrale sole: It was salty. I know I could've told the server but I was hungry so I just added more pepper to it.\n- mac and cheese: not bad, but nothing special. it was cheesy.\n- Fried chicken: well seasoned but the meat was on the dry side. I've had better chicken. \n- Complimentary popovers: It was good, but not the greatest.\n\nDo I wanna come back? Not sure. Food wise,  it was really disappointing.", "author": "Toni Rose M."}

My coworkers and I came for lunch and it was very busy (book your reservation a week in advance).  \n\nI love the decor in this place, it's lovely.  We were seated on the second floor and it really felt intimate like we were eating at an estate.  \n\nWe ordered the deviled eggs, half a lobster, and oysters as appetizers and they were delicious!  I particularly loved the deviled eggs and that the oysters were from Massachusetts (my hometown).  Oh -- their bread rolls and butter with sea salt -- must try! \n\nThen we got the fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, and scallops (which was a special).  They were all delicious but I will note that the portion of scallops was too small -- made it not worth the price at all.  \n\nLastly we got homemade donuts as my birthday dessert and it was soooooooo good.  Best donut I've ever had hands down -- it was so fresh! \n\nI would recommend this place for sure.  Great food, decor, and service -- but a little pricey.", "author": "Michelle S."}

It might have been okay when it first opened but this was one of the shitty-ist \"upscale\" dinning experiences I've ever had.   The waiter didn't show up or acknowledge our table for over 20 minutes.   The \"world's best fried chicken\" was dried out and didn't compare to KFC.   The 32oz bone in ribeye special was more like 20 oz of dried out meat plus a bone, which cost $125 and the dickhead waiter forgot to mention that.  Our bill was $200 for the the ribeye, 2 drinks, a bowl of soup and the chicken.   What joke and never again.", "author": "Mike N."}

My best friend told me their fried chicken is delicious and been wanting to come but never gotten a chance to.  Finally, I have received a nice bonus from work and decided to celebrate with my other best friend having a girls night out.  OMG BEST DECISION EVER!!!\n\nFood:\neverything is incredible.  \nPopup bread: complimentary bread and it was so delicious.  I love brioche bread and this is so good with or without butter. \nDevil Eggs 5/5: best one I have ever had.  Normally you only get little bit of the yolk and you can never get enough.  This place right here, its MORE than enough yolk to go around. it is also so pretty to eat too, it almost like eating a cupcake by the way they pipe them.  The yolk is so whipped and flavorful.  I would come back just for that.\nFried Chicken 5/5: best decision ever.  the batter is not too thick which was great.  Meat is very juicy and tasty. will definitely come back for that. \n\nDessert: \nSticky toffee: It was heavenly.  bread was moist and perfect pairing with the ice cream.  love the orange candy bites.  \nDonut: there were a mistake with our dessert and they accidentally made donuts instead of the sticky toffee; however, our server let us keep it as well.  it was very nice of him. \n\nService: \nIt was very attentive and our server was very knowledgeable with the menu and he actually recommended us to get sticky toffee instead of donuts.  which was perfect as I was debating of what to get and we ended up got both dessert.\nduring our visit, there were some problem in the kitchen.  the printer had a paper jammed issue and our dessert order were never went through so it took longer than expected.  we mentioned to food runner and the manager came and apologized.  he offered us a glass of wine as a complimentary and apologized for the delay.  we shared a bottle of wine so we were like, sure why not.  it was very nice that the manager offered that and excellent customer services. \n\nWill I come back? are you kidding me? My friend and I were just talking about how delicious their fried chickens are and their devil eggs.  I can't wait to go back and enjoy the food again.", "author": "Candice Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-08", "description": "My overall experience at Wayfare was a pleasant one (food-wise). I would definitely suggest getting a reservation though. The restaurant on the outside looks realllly small but it's a 2-story restaurant so there are more tables than you think. It's a little pricey but I think that's what you should expect from a nice restaurant in the Financial District. \n\nThe popovers that they give you are fantastic. I love popovers, especially with some nice butter. They come out warm and soft. Not too heavy either. We chose a couple dishes for the table to share: beef tartare and the baked macaroni & cheese. Both were phenomenal. I don't think I've had a portion of beef tartare so large. I am usually only served a small dab of tartare so I was thrilled by the portion size. It's super soft and just melts in your mouth. I wish there were more chips though. With so much tartare, you run out of chips fast! The baked mac n cheese was good too! I loved the crumbs at the top to add a little texture to the cheesy macaroni. It comes in a hot plate so it can maintain its temperature for longer. No one likes a cold mac n cheese!\n\nFor the main entree, I stuck with the Tavern Burger. You can't go wrong with a burger right? I love eggs in my burger so I added it as well...just $2. I thought the meat was cooked perfectly to my desires (medium rare) and the bun wasn't overly oily like you sometimes find in brioche buns. Lots of juice in the meat too! \n\nThe main downside of this place is definitely the service. From the time we place our orders to the time we actually got our entrees, it had to have been well over 45 minutes to an hour. Maybe they were down a chef that night? Whatever the issue was, the food came out soooooo slow. Since the food came out so slow, we asked for more popovers, which the waiter said \"right away\" but it never came!! What the heck!! Good thing my burger was good...\n\nIn all, this is a nice place to grab dinner. The service is extremely slow but if you're willing to put up with that and enjoy some good food, you might frequent Wayfare Tavern.", "author": "Jason L."}

Our family came to the tavern to celebrate our daughter's SFSU graduation. Our waiter, Bryan, helped to make this occasion special. He was very helpful with suggesting speciality drinks beforehand and popular entrees.  \n\nFor starters, we enjoyed their creamy delicious deviled eggs and prime steak tartare & on to crispy fried chicken and their tavern burgers made to perfection. However, our family was extremely surprised when their salmon dish arrived. At $30, I do expect an entree serving larger than 2 by 2 square! Hence, only 4 stars. Save room for their warm house made doughnuts with apricot dipping sauce and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eehe, they are heavenly. \n\nHowever, Chef Tyler Florence brings wonderful southern classic dishes to SF.  The menu ranges from comfort to rustic delicacies. All floors of the tavern are tailored to a Victorian parlor style to Edwardian architecture. Many options for seating like at a booth, table or pull up a stool to the chef's counter at the open kitchen. \n\nWe will definitely return to the Wayfare Tavern to experience another delightful experience.

Beef perfection, bakery fresh brioche bun, perfectly crisp bacon, and some amazing onion relish that adds a layer of sweet onion goodness.\n\nThe fries? ? I'm convinced they are fried in crack.\n\nAlso had the fried green tomatoes.  Not gonna discuss em, just get em!

Cobbler was killer!!\n\nOur server knew it all.  Recommended a bottle of wine that more than lived up to his detailed description.\n\nAlso love their system of the doggie bag ticket.

For our 4 year anniversary, my boyfriend and I decided to do a nicer lunch that day in San Francisco. We haven't really eaten in the financial district before, and this looked like a good spot. \n\nThe server was nice but went through the specials really fast and I was a little confused and tried to order an entree as an appetizer. At least he corrected me.\n\nI ended up getting the deviled eggs, and baked macaroni and cheese. My boyfriend got the Tavern burger which came with fries, and the clam chowder. Our meal started off with popover bread and butter topped with salt.\n\nI wasn't crazy about the huge layer of salt on the butter but the popover was heavenly. Unfortunately, I kind of filled up on it too much and didn't eat a lot of the other side dishes I ordered. The rose wine I got didn't help either.\n\nThe deviled eggs and chowder came out first. I got to try caviar for the first time as it topped the deviled eggs. That was good, BUT I tasted a crap load of horseradish in the deviled eggs. I could have been wrong, but I really didn't like it. And I rarely don't like deviled eggs. \n\nMy boyfriend's clam chowder was super thin and bland. It was a good presentation though. They first brought out the bowl with a hush puppy in the middle, and then poured the soup around it in front of us. But that doesn't make up for poor flavor.\n\nThen it was a super long wait for our main dishes. My macaroni came out with plentiful bread crumbs. It was good, but nothing special compared to many others I have tried elsewhere. My boyfriend's fried were delicious. He also really liked his burger, I didn't try that. He said his old fashion drink was okay.\n\nAn okay experience.", "author": "Melanie P."}

The fried chicken had a great crispy coating that was flavored with rosemary and lemon. It was a nice touch that I'm sure got them the \"best fried chicken\" award. The burger was AWESOME and one of he best I've had in a while. Macaroni and cheese wasn't your grandma's mac but it was still delicious.

We celebrate the months. Get over it). I think I'm going to remove his responsibilities of choosing places for dinner. I was excited to try this place after reading its reviews, however I was left a little disappointed at the end of out night. They have mastered the art of re-creating comfort food with a fanciful touch. \n\nTheir popover bread was the perfect touch to starting our meal. It was very light and extremely tasty with a spread of their butter. Doesn't leave you feeling bloated before receiving the main course.\n\nYou cannot mess up fried chicken, and I have to admit, Wayfare's rendition is quite juicy with a light crunch. They generously place 5 pieces of a chicken with a garnish of crisp herbs, yet the plate seemed to be lacking a kick of flavor. My tastebuds were expecting a little more. Added a bit of their house-made Tabasco and it seemed to do the trick. However, I commend them for serving moist white meat, which usually tends to be dry. I'll give them that.\n\nBoyfriend was non-stop raving about their house burger, and could not get over the fact that he was able to add egg to it. (lol welcome to 2016, buddy). I took one bite into his burger, and tasted meat and buns. I was not impressed. Also, his burger patty was secreting blood and turning his buns pink, which turned me off. He loved it so, whatever makes him happy. \n\nMac & cheese seemed to have lacked a cheese flavor. It tasted like pasta and milk, really. I love cheese, so I was a bit heartbroken that my mac was lacking its cheese counterpart ): \n\nTo make up for my anticlimactic meal, I decided to give their chocolate pie a try and I was blown away.I was melting in its decadent layers of chocolate and whipped cream. \n\nMost of these stars are going to ambiance.

I drove up to the City and met my friend for a late lunch/early dinner. I actually made a reservation even though our 3:45 reservation was in the middle of the day when everyone else would be at work. I arrived early and thought it was odd no one even acknowledged my presence for 15 minutes. That gave me a tinge of worry; maybe it wouldn't be as good as I was expecting. \n\nWhen we were finally seated in the empty restaurant, we took a look at the menu even though I already knew what I was getting. The whole reason I wanted to try Wayfare Tavern was for the FRIED CHICKEN. Okay, we did need to look at the menu to figure out what else we would be eating with our fried chicken. We decided to share some caramelized mushrooms w/herb butter and garlic confit and burrata whipped potatoes with chives and olive oil. Our waiter asked if we wanted to share the chicken. Puhleeeze! No way, man. I was getting my own. My friend momentarily considered another entree, but then wisely chose the fried chicken. Thankfully, the fried chicken lived up to all of the hype. It was so tasty-finger licking tasty. The only problem was it was just a little bird. One that I could devour in one sitting (yes it was that good). \n\nWhen the work-people all started filing in, our quiet private dining room turned into a very loud bar/lounge. Good thing we were finishing up by the time the bar filled up. That is something to keep in mind for those of you wanting to carry on a conversation.

The food was fine but nothing spectacular. Maybe I've eaten too much \"real\" fried chicken to appreciate their take but to me it was just \"ok\". Certainly not worth $26 for an individual fried chicken dinner.\n\nThe \"poutine\" appetizer was just plain flavorless. A far cry from the real thing available, without glamour, on any street in Canada. To me they just miss the mark on service, taste, and execution.", "author": "Kyle C."}

The Deviled Eggs are a must...so full of flavor and love the bagel crumb on top. The complimentary bread they give is out of this world. It is light, airy and buttery at the same time and has a beautiful crunch. For my entree, I got the Winter Black Truffle Gnocchi which has a beautiful creamy, pillowy lemon flavor to it. I am not a huge fan of gnocchi in general since it is usually not that well-made but this was executed to perfection. Finally, I got the City Salad to share. It was a nice balance to the gnocchi as it was light and refreshing. \n\nThe ambiance was also amazing. We got this room upstairs that looked like a rustic library.

Our evening didn't start off smoothly as they did not have our 6:45pm reservation in their computer but I had received a voice mail from one of the hostesses confirming two days prior. Luckily I saved the voice mail and 'showed' it to them and they seated us. \n\nOur waitress was very nice and appeared to be knowledgeable but did not inform us on how certain menu items were prepared or the portion size. Neither did she space our meal out so everything we ordered arrived almost all at once! It was just my husband and I and we ended up ordering way too much food. \n\nThe restaurant offers popovers (instead of boring old bread) and they were amazing! I could have just eaten the popovers and been happy. \n\nWe started our meal with our waitress' recommendation of the steak tartare and the deviled eggs. The steak tartare was a huge portion and was not prepared how we expected (ie paper thin sliced steak) Instead it was ground meat that covered the entire salad size plate and was served with house made potato chips. And the deviled eggs were mediocre and came 6 to an order. They appeared to have been prepared much in advance and refrigerated for a long time as the serving dish they arrived in was icy cold.\n\nFor our entree we shared the fried chicken which came a la carte so we also added sides of whipped buratta potatoes and forrest mushrooms. The fried chicken was some of the best we've had! But again we really should have been warned that the sides were very generous portions...and we only needed one or neither. The potatoes were good and the mushrooms were not hot when they arrived at our table and were too oily for my liking. \n\nWe really wanted to like this restaurant as the ambiance is cool but were disappointed with our waitress and most of our menu choices.", "author": "Kelley H."}

Not fancy enough where you have to dress up, but it definitely was not a typical restaurant. Luckily, the party ahead of us threw a fit about waiting and left, so we got the last open table! \nWe ordered the must have Organic Fried Chicken, besides it being a little dry, lived up to the raving yelp reviews. We also ordered the Day Boat Scallops, after overhearing the table next to us say it was a new addition to the seasonal menu. BEST decision ever... absolutely delicious... I still think about it til this day.... Lastly, we ordered a side of the baked mac n cheese and it was just your average \"fancy\" mac n cheese. Could have gone without that for sure. \nWe sat by the fire where they have 3, 2 seater tables.

I was told that they specialized in their fried chicken. I shared this dish along with their house burger. Both dishes were absolutely amazing and worthy of their reputation. I was not very pleased with the service we received though. Almost immediately after we sat down, which was right at our reservation time, we were informed of another reservation two hours later. The resturant was very busy early into the late afternoon/early evening and I have always respected the  table turn-rate.  However, I have never heard of this \"pre-warning\" before; and while I thought our waiters tone was appropriate it did feel pre-mature and unnecessary. With this being the case timely service through the meal would be expected, but we had to call on our waiter a few times due to delays he had checking in on us. Our check was brought to us nearly ten minutes before the next reservation time and before being asked to see a dessert menu. When we asked to see one we were told that the manager didn't approve. I won't go into details of how this made our group feel but you can probably imagine.  I won't be back!", "author": "David B."}

Lots of old pictures of San Francisco and a TV rerunning a loop of old San Francisco (where horse carriages, cable cars, pedestrians, cars run amok). \n\nDon't know about price but the food was delicious. We had a family styled feast. We each got a popover as bread - it was fluffy, light, warm, the way a pop-over should be. Then the feast began. We had the Di Stefano burrata salad with Tenbrink tomatos (is this a farm or a special type?), saba (????), basil and caper berries. This was fresh and delicious but I am not sure if it stood out.  We also had a fennel and arugula salad with peaches and candied hazelnut in hazelnut vinaigrette which I really enjoyed. The sweet of the peaches and candied hazelnut provided a nice complement to the arugula and fennel which made it truly outstanding for me.\n\nFor entrees, we had organic fried chicken (Buttermilk brine, crisp woody herbs, roasted garlic, lemon), Tavern burger (red onion marmalade, smoked bacon, Nicasio cheddar) and housemade tagliatelle (cranberry beans, snap peas, Brentwood corn, Parmesan), My favorite was the fried chicken. It was crispy and not too oily and moist and just really yummy. The Tavern burger was a bit too rare for me and the cheddar was a bit overpowering. It was a tall burger though. Tagliatelle was also good but a bit heavy. \n\nSides included were caramelized mushrooms and burrata whipped potato. I loved both of these items.

I was loving the view on how the meals were prepped and cooked.  It was enjoyable to watch while conversing. \n\nTyler Florence 2008 Zinfandel had hints of spice notes to the refined wine. What better way to have it than at Tyler Florence's restaurant in San Francisco!  Mind as well.  It suits the theme.  Get it with red meat, such as their steak.  Their Syrah was a bit fruity dark with strong spice notes. Recommended to pair it with gamey red meat as a balance!  \n\nTheir creamy and smooth deviled eggs, opens up the palate and leaves you eagerly wanting for more.  We ordered the special of the dinner day, steak.  It came in a surprisingly big portion, surely fit for 2 and a complimentary side was included. We chose the grilled mushrooms, which went well with the meaty steak and wine.  \n\nService was proper and the setting reminded me of lounging in a well decorated lodge.  \n\nI had a dainty time here and fancy some more wayfares.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

We came to Wayfare for my birthday--it was a splurge and I looked forward to it for weeks.  Read the menu online.  Psyched to get that Food & Wine rated fried chicken.   \n\nThe experience wasn't knock-down terrible.  The server was efficient-ish and frosty.   I ordered a second glass of wine after the appetizers, the main courses came, and I ate awhile waiting for the wine.  The server was working on a check in the corner and I politely asked if I could have another zinfandel.  I have a new table! she snapped, I haven't forgotten your wine!   It'll be right there!    In awhile it came.  Same frosty vibe.    \n\nThe popovers were delish and the appetizers very rich, that's fine.  I was there for the fried chicken.  And it was really ordinary.   The skin kind of floury and pale and smooth.  No crunchy bits!   Frisco Fried in the Bayview beats this chicken by a mile.   \n\nNext special occasion I'm back to Flour & Water, where the workers are passionate about the food and the quality of your experience.

The ambiance is really cool- cozy and modern with a lively feel. We were meeting someone else for dinner, and they don't seat you until everyone in the party is present, so we hung out at the bar for a little while first. We decided to try one of the cocktails which I forget the name of but it was kind of like a variation on an old fashioned. Really tasty! We also ordered the burrata to snack on. The combination of peppers and strawberries was super unique, and we loved it! Our bartender was also super nice and got us some of the famous popovers to scoop up the burrata that was left after we finished the bread that comes with it. Those popovers are no joke, delicious and airy. When we were seated, we ordered our entrees- one of us got the gnocchi, I got the fried chicken, and the bf got the burger and added an egg. All of the food was fantastic!! The fried chicken comes with a huge portion, and there are equal pieces with and without bones. I got a bite of the burger too which was AMAZING! I loved the fried chicken, but I might be getting the burger next time. The meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly, the bun holds up, and the caramelized onions and egg on top were the perfect compliments. The gnocchi was also super filling and had a good mix of peppers and crispy quinoa on top! For dessert, we all split a slice of the chocolate pie and the famous donuts. Both were awesome! Those donuts though, warm, sweet, and definitely worth a try! We were also celebrating a birthday, and I had mentioned this when I made the reservation on the phone, so dessert came with a birthday candle and a nice happy birthday message on it. Overall, the food, service, and ambiance are definitely 5 stars here! And for the price, you get huge portions of food and won't leave hungry! Only thing that we had that could be negative is the menu is not very extensive, but that being said, they do everything on the menu very well, so no matter what you order, you won't be disappointed! Will definitely be back!!", "author": "Rachel D."}

We had mushrooms, polenta fries, bone marrow, brussel sprouts  and the deviled eggs.

From the beginning, the event staff (Andrea and Mary) was helpful and answered all the questions I had, with helpful tips along the way to make our reception flow. Due to the size of our party, we rented both Sequoia and the Bartlett Room to accommodate a sit-down dinner for everyone. I was very worried about splitting up the guests, but the staff at Wayfare made it easy and seamless.\n\nFirst, I must say that our guests were blown away by the delicious food! Many even said it was hands down the best food they've had at a wedding =D The only hiccup was that dinner ran late and was a bit behind, but the quality and quantity of food more than made up for the delay. From the AMAZING popovers, to the perfectly cooked and seasoned salmon, fried chicken and beef tenderloin we couldn't have asked for better quality food. Everything was SO DELICIOUS and you absolutely get what you pay for!\n\nSecond, the service and staff are STELLAR! You would think for such a large party and with so much happening that you are bound to have issues, but the staff were AMAZING, attentive and always so accommodating. They really went above and beyond to ensure we and our guests were well taken care of. I am a stickler about great service, and Wayfare did not disappoint me.\n\nThe drinks and drink choices were perfect. The bar staff were incredibly friendly and had nothing but great, re-assuring words to say to us and our guests. \n\nAs for the ambience and decor, this was the first thing that drew my husband and I to Wayfare Tavern. The bold, dark colors are absolutely beautiful and lend to the rustic yet sophisticated style. It's especially beautiful at night with all the candles (they provided!) in the metallic votives sprinkled throughout the tables and rooms. \n\nI cannot recommend this restaurant/venue enough for your event. They do not disappoint and receiving all the praises and compliments from our guests just proved to us that we absolutely made the right choice hosting our special celebration at Wayfare Tavern! It is now a staple in our regular trips up to San Francisco from LA.\n\nThank you again Wayfare Tavern staff! ~ Krystle & Kyler", "author": "Krystle R."}

Had I not had such incredibly high expectations and just looked at this as another meal, it would have certainly impressed me. But I'm a food snob, so I can usually always see room for improvement. \n\nThe meal started with an attentive server and popovers, best with the whipped butter and salt on the table.  Ordered the can't-miss organic fried chicken, the tavern burger, and broccolini. \n\nThe burger was pretty awesome at Medium. Cooked excellently and had wonderful flavor. Would be nice to have a sweeter softer bread like brioche as the bun. Juicy. Flavorful. Get it. \n\nThe fried chicken was good for sure. Served as 5 pieces, so some are bone-in, some are not. Those that were not were pretty dry and I took a bite or two and left those pieces on the plate. Flavor was great. Wish the fry was crunchier. \n\nService quickly declined and became very slow. Bussed our own table, and no one came to clear it off for about 10-15 minutes. It wasn't that busy, either, and our waiter kept walking right by our table to get to the computer so its not like we were out of his way to take care of.", "author": "Clark G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-28", "description": "Most of us have seen Tyler Florence's programs and cheered for our favorite food trucks, so it's no wonder his restaurant turned out to be such a popular establishment. The place was bustling with locals and journeying wayfarers, a crowd ready to dig in to some fancy comfort dishes. Elevated bar food. Refined American classics. I could go on, but... I won't.\nI like that Wayfare's menu is a brief single-pager, so it's not overwhelming, but I still experienced a little indecision since half the menu appealed to me, like poutine, deviled eggs, burrata, etc. There's also a raw bar.\n\nWe had reservations, but it took about 15 minutes to get seated, so we had some time to do some people-watching. The venue gave off a bit of an old school pub vibe with a lot of dark wood, exposed brick walls, and damask wallpaper. The bar and dining space appeared narrow, but there is more than meets the eye, so much more. This single restaurant houses 3 floors. The second floor has its own small bar and a pool table room that you can reserve. If that's not enough, there is more private dining space on the third floor. There's also a chef's counter so you can see the chefs execute the dishes. Impressive as it all was, some decorations felt a little creepy, like the animals on the walls. Can't say I'm a fan of taxidermy. It's a good thing I'm not responsible for cleaning the place after hours, because I'm too much of a wuss.\nI was starting to think they forgot about us in the midst of all the busy chatter. Then the host seated us upstairs, where the volume was much more conversation-friendly. \n\nComplimentary popovers:\nI was looking forward to these much raved about airy rolls. They were warm and buttery and developed a nice brown crust. Of course, they were delicious, and didn't really need butter. The only drawback to these popovers was they weren't ultra-light or hollow like I expected them to be, but the inside was still very fluffy and had plenty of air pockets. Plus, it's a complimentary item, so I can't complain.\n\n$13 Cucumber Mule - vodka, lime, cucumber & ginger beer:\nThe Moscow mule is one of my favorite drinks and I was pleased to see it served in a Moscow mule mug. With cucumber, it was extra refreshing.\n$13 Tavern Sour - Wayfare tavern select Eagle Rare Single Barrel, yellow chartreuse, herb syrup, egg white:\nGood whiskey sour - frothy with woodsy notes\n\n$22 Tavern Burger - proprietary grind, red onion marmalade, smoked bacon, brioche, \n+$2 w/ sunny side up egg:\nThis burger was excellent. It hit all the criteria a $20+ burger should have. The beef was very thick & juicy. The melted cheese covered the patty in its entirety and oozed onto the bun. The toasted bun was nice and fluffy and held up to the weight of the burger.\nPlus, it was loaded with crunchy bacon. The egg was cooked perfectly with a super runny center and smooth egg whites. Once the egg popped, the flowing yolk and meat juices combined into a delicious mess. I used the accompanying crispy fries to dip into the egg yolk that dripped everywhere.\n\n$26 Organic Fried Chicken - buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp herbs, lemon:\nYou're probably thinking for the price, this fried chicken better be amazing. Well, that's what I was thinking. & it was pretty damn good. I don't usually go for pricy fried chicken, but the other entrees were not as appealing.\n2 large wings & 2 breasts were stacked under an herb trifecta of roasted rosemary, thyme and sage leaves. There was some salt and pepper on the side, for extra flavor, I guess. The meat was very juicy and tender, including the white meat. As I tore off some crispy skin, some steam inside escaped. That's always a good sign when it comes to fried food. They made pretty good leftovers the next day too.\n\nIn the past, I've also had the beef tartare and poutine, but they weren't nearly as enjoyable as the burger & fried chicken. At one point, they used celery in the steak tartare, and that interfered with the taste and texture, but I did like that they served it with strips of cut up popovers. Apparently, now they use potato chips, which I imagine you'll have to eat with a spoon, since chips crumble easily. As for the poutine, the oxtail gravy wasn't that great. I found the oxtail meat a little stringy and tough. \n\nIt's hard to have a bad meal with burgers and fried things. They change up their menu every so often, so I'd come back to try something different, since I don't intend to make it a habit of eating $$$ fried chicken and burgers.\nNow when you're trying to decide between cocktails and a solid dinner, you can be thankful that Wayfare Tavern offers both. I give it an 8.75/10.", "author": "Joy W."}

Nearly six months ago I had reservations here, but thanks to being stuck on the Bay Bridge for 2.5 hours we missed it and had no time to eat here thanks to only having a certain amount of time left before the nutcracker started. \n\nSo how was the experience for something that I've been waiting for nearly 6 months? Overall, it was pretty good, but not without flaws. When we entered we were not greeted and a couple who came in after us were asked if they had a reservation. Blam. Completely ignored. However, within a few minutes an older lady showed up and gave us our table. I guess the initial lady might have thought were were too young to be taken seriously. \n\nOur server was simply OK. He brought our drinks out rather late, and to make up for this he gave us free dessert, which was great, but even that took awhile. He was a bit on the slower side, but what can you do. They did clean our tables frequently which was nice. \n\nThe food itself was all fantastic. They complimentary bread was unbelievable. Not sure how they made it, but it was fantastic. I've never had beef tartar until yesterday and for raw beef, it was amazing. My girlfriends fried chicken was the best fried chicken I've ever had and it was cooked perfectly. The free desserts tasted great as well. \n\nThe main reason I came here is in my search for a burger to top Umami's burger. The burger here cost $20 and for two extra dollars they give you an egg. (I ordered it with an egg, but they forgot it) Either way, the burger was damn good, but it didn't top Umami's even though it's nearly twice the price. Either way my journey continues. \n\nOverall, it's a great place, but I've found better food at a cheaper price, but overall it was a great experience even though they took a bit took long.", "author": "Benny H."}

The food was delicious!\n\nFirst, we were served massive, fresh popovers, which I thoroughly enjoyed. They were just a touch sweet and eggy, but not overly so.\n\nWe then shared several appetizers:\n\n- DEVILED EGGS: Very good! Apparently inspired by bagels and lox, as they incorporated smoked salmon, dill, and had a little bagel chip on top. Cute.\n- PEACH AND BURRATA TOAST: Sooooo good, but fairly messy (that goopy burrata had me licking my fingers shamelessly). I think there were also some hazelnuts on there. I could eat this dish all day.\n- BEEF TARTAR WITH EGG YOLK: Served with massive potato chips that were hefty enough to carry a big scoop of tartar. The tartar was great - I had several spoonfuls - but it was *slightly* heavy on the capers for me. I'd definitely order this again, though!\n\nFor my entree, of course I had the FRIED CHICKEN, as it's supposed to be some of the best fried chicken in the country - that's some big talk for a place in SF, where the fried chicken scene is generally pretty disappointing, so obviously I had to investigate.  It was, in fact, really really good. I also loved the generous portion of fried herbs that came draped on top. Overall, a super satisfying dish. Highly recommended!\n\nI also tried some of the ROASTED MUSHROOMS side dish, which was also good, but not as special as the fried chicken, burrata, or tartar (maybe about on par with the eggs).\n\nService was excellent. I'd love to come back and try their dinner!", "author": "Liz F."}

The lemon balm really comes through and they are super creamy, could maybe use some crunch on top in addition to the caviar. \n\nThe mushroom rotolo is rich and filling due to the cream sauce and morel garnish, you can almost smell the earthy truffles coming out of the kitchen!

I arrived a few minutes early and had a drink at the bar before hand. Gorgeous bar, excellent drinks. Service was on point from the moment we walked in. The fresh popovers they have for bread service are absolutely incredible. The menu is creative while still offering classic dishes. We ordered the beef tartare, which was INCREDIBLE. And also huge. It came with fresh made potato chips which were super light and crisp. I can't even begin to describe to you in proper detail how delicious the bone marrow was. It was topped with a huge amount of seared pork belly and blueberries and served with a soft, fluffy bread. Absolutely perfect. For dinner we shared the fried chicken, which the menu says they're famous for. And I believe it. The chicken was crisp, light and juicy. At the end of dinner we were so full we had to skip dessert. So we made reservations the next night with plans to come back, have an appetizer and dessert. The next night, we came back, and ended up ordering another full dinner. It was that good. I never did get a change to try the desserts but I figure that's just another reason to come back the next time I'm in town. Don't pass on this place!", "author": "Kristin W."}

Food was all tasty (nothing amazing), but we ordered an off-menu special (rib eye steak). The server was very nice, but completely neglected to mention the price of the special. Unfortunately we also forgot to ask for the price (our bad) and had some extreme sticker shock when the bill arrived. The ribeye was 120 dollars, which is three times more expensive than the most expensive entree on the menu. We politely mentioned the surprise to our host and he said he'd check with the manager. The manager then came by to say he wasn't able to fix anything, the price of meat has gone up, but to \"come back next time and mention his name\" and he'd see what he could do then. \n\nWe will definitely not be coming back and were all very disappointed in how they handled the situation.

The bar has a neat antique like tap line that is very charming. I took a seat there and asked for food recommendations. Both bartenders recommended the Pork Shank and I went for it along with a half dozen oysters from the west coast (they let you choose west or east). The oysters were perfectly shucked and detached. Extremely fresh and filled with sea flavor. I enjoyed the mignonette quite a bit. The pork shank though stole the show. It was tender and serving size is very significant. You don't need a side with this dish! It was served over a pouched like apple that was still crunchy and mildly sweet and cabbage in a light brown sauce. You barely needed any force with your fork to cut the meat off the bone. Fantastic dish and I would love to have it again.

My husband and I were visiting SF from Chicago and since we didn't make a reso in time, we decided to chance it by getting a seat at the bar. The bar on the first floor was full but we scored two seats on the second floor. Even better because the bar upstairs only has 4 seats so it was cosy and allows you to interact with the bartender!\n\nAs I sat at the bar, I couldn't help looking around and admiring the interior. It's a mix of rustic, elegant, classic, and yet contemporary. \n\nEvery item we ordered was perfectly executed. \n\nBone Marrow:\nWe've had quite a bit of bone marrow at various restaurants and Wayfare Taven does it a little differently from what we've experienced. Here, the bone marrow is dressed with pulled short ribs. So when you're scooping into the bone, you're getting both short rib meat and marrow. While I'm a purist and love marrow just as is, I can appreciate that the way this is executed perfectly caters to any type of diner: naive and experienced bone marrow diner.\n\nTuna salad:\nThis was new on the menu that week and it comes with chunks of watermelon. Each chunk is also topped with a thin slice of chilli pepper to kick it up a notch.\n\nSteak tartare:\nAnother well executed item, and well flavored. Comes with a few pieces of big chip instead of bread, and I love that idea as I generally don't like to fill up on bread prior to my entrees.\n\nMac and cheese:\nNeed I say more? Just get it. Comes with a few peppers inside. Lovely!\n\nWe left Wayware Tavern that night feeling absolutely contented.", "author": "Teri Y."}

We had a reservation but they wanted the whole party to be present before we could be seated, which is fair and common practice. Our whole party was present around 8:10 and our reservation was at 8 PM but we didn't get seated until around 8:30 PM. The restaurant was obviously very busy and apologized for the wait and gave us complimentary Prosecco which was nice. Once we got a table, the waitress who was serving us was awesome! So friendly and so funny. Tyler Florence was actually there that night too! We saw him briefly in the kitchen before he disappeared. My friends all opted to order the famous fried chicken while I ordered the flank steak. We also ordered two sides: mushrooms and the mac n cheese. \n\nUnfortunately our food took forever to come (45-60 minutes after we placed our order). Thank goodness for those popovers or we would have been starving. My friends all loved their food. The fried chicken was delicious but my steak was cold which I couldn't understand. Minus one star for the crazy wait for food and minus another star for serving cold food. I probably should've told the kitchen but was so starving I just wanted to eat. Really wanted to like this restaurant but my the experience wasn't so great.

I love the old school vibes that you get from this place. Everything just looks so 1900s and classy... not really sure how to better describe it. It oozes of class and wealth which is very fitting given where it is. Anyways just great atmosphere all in all.\n\nA friend and I came for Saturday lunch and the place was pretty empty which is not surprising given that it's FiDi on a weekend. I got the fried chicken for lunch--they also served us the popovers which were awesome. Totally wasn't expecting them/didn't even realize that apparently it's a unique thing here. Anyways the popover was good but I think they are a little overhyped from some of the Yelp reviews. It's basically a giant hollow... cone that is made out of bread. It's good and it's different from what you typically get, but it wasn't super amazing.\n\nThe fried chicken was pretty solid. It's a really generous portion--comes with five different pieces. It's definitely really well seasoned and breaded. I noticed that they had spicy sauce inside the chicken underneath the breaded layer which I thought was a brilliant way to add flavor to an otherwise would have been super dry piece of chicken breast. Chicken breast is always the least desirable chunk of the chicken for me, but they managed to make it not too bad with the embedded spicy sauce. Generously sized portion.\n\nFinally bill for two entrees came out to be around $60 which is definitely not cheap... but it's FiDi so you deal I guess\n\ntldr; pretty classic American food--restaurant has a great vibe/scene so would def recommend coming for that and the food is pretty decent too", "author": "Jasmine X."}

I selected the wayward tavern (okay it's called the Wayfare Tavern) for its ambiance, menu and it's yelp review.  My rating comes down to price tag. For the $150 per person it rated two stars. Had it been $75 per person the rating somewhere between a three and a four. In Summary: The management was absent, the food was average, the waiter excellent, and the room had ambiance, though when we used the red phone it rang and rang but no one answered. \n\nMy Exec assistant agreed weeks in advance on the menu and the wine. 24 hours in advance the Wayward Tavern refused to honor the prefix menu agreed upon and management would not speak with her, nor would they address the broken commitment. Rather than cancel, I wanted to, we decided to go ahead. \n\nUpon arrival, the hostess was challenged finding the private room and the best she could do was point us to the stairs. From there we sleuthed our way around the second floor to find the interestingly private room. It was a small, quiet, billiard room where the billiard table doubled as a dining table. The windows were slightly open and while intimate, it was pleasant. \n\nI had some expectation that we'd have time to chat before eating, yet before the entire team had arrived the first course came. The butter lettuce salad was crisp and the deviled eggs were tasty if slightly runny. For the main course the theme of the food was well prepared and not as inspiring as the price tag would suggest.  I had requested the truffle gnocchi and as mentioned above, when we arrived we received an underwhelming spring gnocci instead. The Salmon was slightly larger than an appetizer, the burger a burger, both prepared as requested. There was nothing wrong with the food except the mismatch in delight to price tag.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the dessert. The pie crust and puff pastry although fresh that day, were not very crusty, and the promised, delightful, chocolate pot du creme was cruelly dropped at the last minute by the management.\n\nThe waiter, AC/AJ was the highlight of the experience. I confess, I was expressing my disappointment with the menu while he was in attendance and he was a great sport about it all. He made the extra effort to try and make up for the lack of Chocolate Pot Du Cr\u00e8me, the almost singular reason I chose the place.

Complimentary popovers are a nice touch. Golden beet hummus tastes fresh with pickled beets, radish and carrots. We also ordered the grilled octopus, roasted mushrooms, brussels sprouts and mac n cheese. The latter wasn't a hit with any of us, it lacks flavor and is overly creamy.

Wow. I like deviled eggs on the whole, so I did appreciate the attentiveness and selection of ingredients to elevate this picnic/potluck friendly appetizer.\n\n-organic fried chicken: buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herbs, and a lemon to squeeze. This fried chicken was amazingly good. The buttermilk brine in the batter created a crispy exterior, all the while keeping the chicken moist and tender inside. Wonderful. Great. I was a fan of this dish.\n\n-Wayfare burger \"Le Grande\": grass-fed proprietary grind, Marin brie,\nroasted onion, smoked bacon, + a sunny side up Petaluma egg, sandwiched between brioche: I really like that Tyler Florence sources his ingredients to local proprietors close to his home i.e. the Marin brie. This burger was amazing. Each component to the burger was well thought out and executed, and when paired altogether, it made for a really, really good burger. We split this into quarters, and after I was done eating, I wished that I had ordered an entire burger to myself.\n\nWayfare Tavern does comfort food really well. Dishes that are familiar in appearance are given a new identity with each bite. The execution of something as simple as fried chicken was great.

Our reservation was for 8pm. The bf and I decided to head down an hour earlier to see if we could get in before our reservation because we were really hungry. He called and the hostess said it wasn't possible. Then we got a call 10 mins later saying a table had opened up due to a cancellation. Luckily, we found parking right away and walked in. \n\nWe were seated towards the back near the fireplace. I was surprised that they were fairly busy on a Sunday night. Anyway, after looking over the menu, we both decided that we each wanted to get the fried chicken. Then we shared the mac 'n' cheese and fries. He had a beer and I had a cucumber mule. \n\nShortly after ordering our food, our drinks came out first and then we were given popovers, which were tasty with butter. \n\nAs soon as our chicken came out, I was so eager to try it because it's what everyone raves about. On the menu, it's just described as, \"Organic fried chicken, buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crispy woody herbs, lemon.\" I bit into a piece and immediately noticed that it was still red at the bone. You could still visibly see blood throughout. It wasn't what I was used to and I couldn't even enjoy it. I was just eating around it. \n\nMy bf wanted to speak to the manager and she came over to us and explained that the chicken was cooked sous vide in a water bath and it was fully cooked and safe to eat. So, even though my bf didn't like the chicken, he still continued to eat it. I basically just nibbled on each piece without finishing a whole one. \n\nMy bf called the manager over a 2nd time and said that I didn't like the chicken at all and that I was barely eating it. So, she said she would take care of it and take it off our bill. She asked if we liked donuts and if she could offer us something savory, but I don't like donuts and I didn't want to eat anything else. \n\nDespite not liking the chicken, we did enjoy the mac 'n' cheese. It was probably the best I've had in a while. It was baked to perfection!\n\nOverall, I would have liked to have been informed about how the chicken was cooked beforehand or even have it said on the menu. If I had known it was cooked sous vide, I would not have ordered it. Maybe it's not a big deal to other people, but for someone who has never eaten it that way, it was really unappetizing.", "author": "Fallon P."}

I got the impression the morale/culture of the team is not a respectful one.\n- I asked him to bring a menu back later so I could order another dish (i.e. he did not ask if I wanted further food after rushing my first initial order, which was a small dish). \n\nI essentially managed my own experience and received the impression they could have done without my patronage that evening (Sunday, November 12, 2017).

It came out cold and undercooked. Ribeye needs to  get hot to melt the fat and this was rare. It came to the table sliced so they had to know the fat had not melted and It was tough with way too much gristle.  We tried to eat it but it was chewy and flavorless.  The server took away an almost full steak. We were not too concerned as we had great appetizers and salad until we saw the check. $125 Ribeye!!! Not Kobe or Wagyu! One of the cheapest steaks for $125. Absolutely ridiculous and unacceptable!!! In hindsight we should have asked the price but who would think you need to when its a Ribeye from an unknown ranch. When the rest of their entrees were in the $30 range I never imagined a crappy Ribeye would be so outrageously priced. Having been a server I would have told guests the price when I described it.

That person for me is Patricija P. So naturally we decided to celebrate our birthdays here, up the dark staircase, and amongst the wild wallpaper and beautiful wood floors. \n\nPopovers were a hot surprise (although I really don't fancy popovers much generally, are they normally this hollow? #biscuitworshipper). We started off with half a dozen deviled eggs (btw, an egg and a half is a little much for one person). Although the description made them sound a little edgy and different, they were rather classic. Very mustardy, if I recall. \n\nWe shared a salad with palm hearts and avocado, which was mostly avocado. Refreshing but it felt like it was missing something. Clearly we had to try the Fried Chicken since we heard it was a big deal. Several pieces of chicken - crispy and delightful at the table. However, I let P take the rest home and she advised the next morning that the pieces were undercooked and inedible. Bummer. However, their doggy bag system is kind of rad. They give you a number and you can pick it up on your way out. \n\nFor dessert we shared the donuts. I can't remember all three of the sauces it came with, but we really only loved one. Also, the two donuts are huge. This would be perfect to share amongst four.\n\nOur dining experience was overall positive, and I think a lot of the items on their menu are safe.

I used to watch Food 911, Tyler's Ultimate and the Great Food Truck Race.  These days Chef Tyler is expanding his food empire with restaurants like Wayfare Tavern.  Located in the Financial District of San Francisco, this restaurant has a classic feel to it and the food served can best be described as elevated comfort food.  I had OpenTable reservations for lunch and we arrived promptly at noon.  Our hostess was trying to juggle all the people at the front entrance and we were escorted upstairs after a few short minutes wait.  \n\nWhile I've heard that the fried chicken is delicious, I opted for the special of the day which was the steak sandwich with Asian pear pickles and goat cheese.  It also came with a side of fries.  My steak sandwich was superb but as with most things, I started to pick out the inner ingredients and left the bread on the plate because I felt that the entree was carb heavy.  It was still good and probably the most cost efficient steak I've ever eaten.  Sean C. had the burger which is also one of the items on the must try list.  The burger was perfectly cooked, juicy, and delicious.  We also ordered the baked macaroni and cheese.  While it was rich with a lovely crispy bread crumb topping, it just didn't do it for me.  I've actually had better mac & cheese elsewhere and I've made better at home.  I thought it was slightly underseasoned too.

I took a look around me and immediately succumbed to the elegance. Wood-trimmed tables and carpeted floors decorated the dining area. Music, in the voice of Sinatra, filled the room like a song of ice and fire. Above the fireplace hangs the head of a stag. The conspicuous sigil of House Baratheon finalized the touch of sophistication.\n\nThe whole restaurant reminded me of Christmas. And that Christmas is coming....or that Winter Is Coming.\n\nOur party started off with mugs of beer, glasses of wine, and a Cucumber Gimlet. The remarks we exchanged were clever and witty, as if Tyrion was participating in our conversation. And seeing as how we were downing our drinks, one may suspect that we were Tyrion himself. Hunger pains soon poked at us like Arya with her Needle, and that's when the Popovers arrived. Believe me, these Popovers were a gift from the old gods and the new. In fact, the Septas and the lady in red probably prayed together in front of the Stark Godswood to bring about such a buttery and soft Popover. Totally divine. \n\nThe service was fantastic. Our server checked on us regularly, smiled often, and basically treated us like royalty (with the exception of not referring to us as \"Your Grace\".) I was nice enough to not be mistaken for King Joffrey... so maybe he thought my companion was Daenerys. That's probably why he approved our choice of the fiery hot Tomato Soup over the cold one. A dragon always prefers the hot and the fiery.\n\nThe Tomato Soup was probably the best of the night, but the other food were exquisite as well. The Grilled Octopus and Scallops, undoubtedly fresh from the Narrow Sea, impressed me in both taste and presentation. As you can see from the pictures below, the dishes look almost as stunning as Margaery Tyrell. I cannot vouch for the comparison in taste however, as I have yet to taste Margaery ;) The French Onion Dip was spectacular as well. The dip comes with Caviar on top, and that's a level of bougie that only Lord Renly could match. (Not KING Renly, I support Stannis' claim!) \n\nThe star of my stars arrived last, in the form of five pieces of Fried Organic Chicken. The portions were HUGE. Given that Khal Drogo and Gregor Clegane are both beasts in their own right, I doubt that even they can finish this plate. Maybe only if they share the crispy and succulent chicken with the Hound and Brienne of Tarth as well. While savoring the herby taste of the fine chicken, I wondered how fat the bird must have been to provide enough meat for this dish. For some reason, only the image of the three-eyed crow appeared in my mind. \n\nI drew my camera from its sheath like the Kingslayer his sword and began taking down pictures of food. However, the dining area was dim and full of terrors, so I had to ask Colin M. to provide me with light. After pictures, we tried our best to finish all the food, but there were just too much and no dire wolves under our table for us to feed. No worries. The server boxed it up for us and handed us a number. We were to pick up our leftovers on our way out like a coat check/cloak check. Cool system!\n\nWe were so stuffed that we could not bring ourselves to order desserts. It was just impossible, even if we did love sweets as much as Sansa loves lemon cakes. We asked for the check because a Lannister always paid his debts, but the meal was on the house! Ben, the manager, wanted to show Colin M. a true Wayfare Tavern experience and the whole meal was free. I was so happy and so thankful I didn't know what to say other than \"Hodor\". \n\nNow that I have my wits back, I want to thank Ben for the wonderful meal and Wayfare Tavern experience. And of course, have to give Colin M. a big shoutout for letting me tag along and giving me the opportunity to write this Game of Thrones review :)\n\n*Game of Thrones Opening Theme Music*", "author": "Ringo M."}

The reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the Fried Chicken. The fried chicken was good, but if our country can't make a better fried chicken than Wayfare Tavern's, than we've got to step it up. For me, the fried chicken was very juicy, but a bit bland, and the batter/skin was thin and could be crispier.\n\nBesides the fried chicken, my party ordered the bone marrow, burger, whole lobster, shrimp cocktail, mac n' cheese and doughnuts for dessert. All were pretty delicious, especially the whole lobster's lemon rosemary butter accompaniment and the housemade doughnuts! The bread was also fantastic! Very unique in that it's more like a croissant/pastry than your average roll.", "author": "Jessica N."}

For such a nice place, the greeters and servers truly need to find a job they enjoy.

Throughout the entire meal, my friends and I felt rushed and unwanted. They made us feel we were unworthy of eating there because of our age. Before we could even finish all of our entrees and side dishes, they were clearing our plates. This happened on three different occasions with multiple waiters even after mentioning we were not finished. Once all the plates were cleared, we asked for additional pop over bread as they are delicious! However, when we asked, they still cleared all the remaining silverware, as well as the condiments, including the butter and salt/pepper. We waited for about 10 minutes until the manager approached us and asked if we would like dessert. We replied, \"Not at this time as we would like more bread.\" Her response surprised me as she quickly replied with, \"Bread? At this point? Uh, okay...\"  -___- We felt judged and uncomfortable. But on top of this, after we got our second round of bread, another waiter asked if this was our dessert. We kindly responded with no, we are going to order dessert in a little bit. He responded very sarcastically, \"Oh, people are usually full at this point when they get more bread.\" Again, felt MORE THAN uncomfortable and judged. It is a very unfortunate situation because the food was delicious, but we would never return because of our experience with the service.", "author": "Jasmine D."}

He was just making sure his customers who were sitting outside were doing well. (good for them, not for us). When the bartender finally came over to take our drink orders, he was honest and because of this, I thought he was funny. He didn't lie when we asked if our table was ready, and he told me the grape juice was too sweet when I tried to order it, so I went with the mint lemonade.\n\n1:25 and still no wait staff to get us to our table. The hostess finally comes to us and lets us know our table would be set up in a couple of minutes.

Also his napkin was wet?!\n\nStill at the table and had to request our popovers.... food better be good\n\nSo you ask, how was the food? My fried chicken was made well, nicely breaded and crispy outside with the meat tender and juicy. Seasoned well with sage, thyme, and rosemary and 2 side wedges of lemon. But you know when the whole service from the beginning ruins the experience.... yeah that's what happened. \n\nService by our waitstaff was good (he didn't ruin the experience for me, it was the prior).

Now $25 for 3 pieces of chicken may raise some eyebrows, but that initial crunch as you bite into its buttery milked crust makes it worth every penny.\n\nHonorable mentions would have to be their Baked Mac and Cheese as it was some serious cheesy gooey goodness and their Deviled Eggs. I also had their Roasted Brussels Sprouts, which I thought was a little too dry and bland. Their cocktail drinks were also decent. I had ordered a Sazerac but the bartender went a little overboard with the bitters that it overpowered the alcohol. \n\nThe service was great as my waitress hand held me through the entire dining experience suggesting what cocktails to drink and what dishes to eat.

My husband and I checked in around noon and ready to head out for some yummy food!  The closest place from the hotel is this place where has burger that my husband would eat.  The place is small but kind of hip.  We shared their signature hamburger as it seems a bit big for me to eat, and I didn't want to waste food especially when everything is costing more than back home.  The burger has a little bit of mayo on each side of the bread, a few strips of bacon and saut\u00e9/pickled onion, and cheese (I asked to take the cheese out as I can't have any dairy).  So this dish came with fries, which my husband was excited at first, but after a bite, he didn't like it.  The fries had light seasoning with a few chopped herb on it.  I personally thought the fries were pretty good!!  Now the burger, they were nice to cut the burger in halves knowing that we were sharing.  The burger is hand made and pretty fresh.  I guess because it's the signature dish, the waitress didn't ask us how we like our burger to be cooked.  So, it came like a \"medium-rare to medium\".  My half of the burger was a bit more medium, but my husband's half was more like medium rare!!!  So, he only ate what he could and left the pinkish bloody center of the burger on the plate!!!  \n\nI gave 3 starts not because the food wasn't good.  I thought my half of the burger was very tasty, the meat was fresh, the combination of the bacon and onion were perfect!!   But I wish they will ask how we would like the burger to be cooked, so they we both could enjoy it even more!  If they are going to cook the way they do, then a note on the side of menu about it would be nice.  Then we probably will not order that dish; however, i understand that we also could've asked our burger to be cooked certain way..... but my point is they as a restaurant, satisfying the customers should be their priority!  \n\nAnother reason I gave 3 starts is because the price was a bit on the high side for a lunch item!  $23 for a hamburger!!  If it was a dinner item, I think I would consider it ok.  But again, this is my first time in San Francisco.... it's one of the \"culture shocks\" for us!!", "author": "Denise D."}

We had a set menu but the varieties that kept coming out of the kitchen seemed endless. The meal began with some popovers that were suuuuper good. Light and fluffy, I much prefer these to normal bread pieces you get at other restaurants. For apps we had a good mix of carbs, some ridiculous mushrooms, the most amazing and simplistic appetizer salads, and some other white people food (think baguette slices with cheese and pear on them). All good. \n\nFor mains we had five choices: fried chicken, salmon, gnocchi, burger and salad. We ordered everything except the gnocchi. I got the fried chicken and thought it was easily the best fried chicken I've had a \"fancier\" restaurant. Burger looked absurd and filling. Salmon was a bit on the small side. \n\nFor dessert we just had two things: cream puffs and some other pie that was out of this would. Anyway-- if you're looking for something on the nicer end but that won't break the bank, I'd recommend this place for lunch or dinner.", "author": "Henry Y."}

Pork Shank was so good I wanted to pick it up and gnaw on the Bone. I am still thinking that I should have. Mac Cheeses and Burrata whipped mashed were on point, they were simply delicious.  The reason for the four stars is that the Fried chicken did not live up to hype, as a matter of fact is was just ok. Not hot and not juicy as matter of fact it was kind of soggy. The pop overs would have been good if they had been served warm. As mater of fact the pop over guy only came around once to our table to offer, I felt he was kind of stingy with them.

Cream Pie- Signature TCHO chocolate blend, devil's food cake, blackberry, lavender meringue\nMy other favorite combo of dessert is chocolate and lavender.

The chicken was very good! Crunchy and moist, cooked to perfection with light seasoning. Served with fried herbs and came plated with a row of coarse salt and ground pepper to season just to your liking. I definitely appreciated that touch. \nOf my friends, we ordered the scallops, pork chop and burger. We had also ordered the whipped potatoes and Mac n cheese for sides. I tried everyone's entree. The scallops were the most amazing I've ever had!!!! Like butter. Just enough texture on the outside and when I say cooked to perfection, I mean, perfection. Best bite of scallop I've ever had. Although I loved my chicken, I had food envy after that bite of scallop. Pork chop and burger were both juicy, seasoned well and tasty! The whipped potatoes were light in texture and viscosity. Heavily garnished with chopped chives. They were my favorite side! The mac n cheese was smokey with bacon but nothing I couldn't live without. \nWe also ordered three deserts. Donuts, chocolate pie and peaches n whipped cream. Donuts were insane!!!!!  Get them! Hot, fresh, glazed with a fruit sauce on side.

There's a good selection of wines (Chablis and Sancerre: my favorite French wines, Pinot Gris, lots of reds), beers and cocktails (my friend had the cocktail with cucumber she loved!). \n\nThe booths on the 1st floor are large, comfortable and offer privacy which is nice since the restaurant is pretty loud.\n\nWe ordered sides to share to start off: \n- Mushrooms with butter and garlic: tasted like ceps, DELICIOUS. \n- Roasted Brussel sprouts with pomegranate: amazing and original combinaison! \n- Mac & cheese: yummy too, definitely stood out from other places.\n\nThe famous popovers were served. I haven't seen any like these in any other restaurants so far. Very very good and fresh, even better with butter.\n\nThe entrees came. We had ordered:\n- The sea bass: good amount of fish, very fresh, moist, good presentation. Great overall.\n- The burger: apparently the bun looks better than it seems. It was a bit dry said the hubs. The meat was good though. The fries, to me, were once again disappointing. Dry/nothing special.\n- The steak: my friend liked it a lot.\n- The fried chicken: That's the dish we had picked on our first time. It's very good but at the end of the day, it's still fried chicken (even if it IS good). It's boring compared to all the other great dishes on the menu! It isn't served with anything and keep in mind it is a HUGE portion (good for 2 really).\n\nFor dessert, we shared between 4 people:\n- The donuts: recommend by our waitress. They were very tasty. Tasted more like French beignets with a hole than donuts. But super good and once again fresh. Apple, applesauce and cream on the side. Great size for 2 people or 4 if you've ordered more than one dessert like us.\n- The coconut cake with cream cheese: big slice! Good but not off the chains by any mean.

Next time I'm getting the pork and beans because wow it was amazing. The server confided that it was her favorite, and it was ours too. \nWe also had cabbage with truffles as a side, but I didn't detect any truffle flavor at all. \n\nAnd now for dessert. I am a dessert snob, so am really picky.

The ice cream was perfect. The strawberry cobbler was kind of boring though.  It came with a little pitcher of caramel to pour on top which was a nice touch, but sadly didn't rescue the boring cobbler. \n\nThe citrus tart came with a carrot gelato which went well with the tart and was interesting as well as delicious. The custard was a little eggy for me, and it was also baked in the tart shell (don't think it was pre baked at all) so the bottom crust was soggy and blech. \n\nOverall, 4 stars and a lovely experience.", "author": "El B."}

Just a short walk from union square (14 minutes), this restaurant is absolutely beautiful.  Smallish little entry way that faces the long bar and a steep staircase to the second floor dining room.  They do have an elevator if stairs are not your thing.  The dining room is cozy and decorated for the holidays like a Dickens play.  The wine list is great and the service was the best I have had in a while.  Ice cold water served as soon as we were seated and attentive server with recommendations on wine and menu selection.  They are known for certain dishes, two of which we ordered.  Started with their deviled eggs (6 to a serving) which were so tasty - tarragon aplenty and very much devoured.  BFF had the salmon special and I ordered the Tavern burger, medium rare with egg added. Man, as you know I have been in search of the perfect burger for years.... my search is over.  This burger was beyond description from bun to the house made pickles.  Get the egg... die a happy person.  They said it would be fried but the egg was runny which made it 1000 times better.  The Brie melts in your mouth and the actual proprietary meat blend tastes like filet mignon.  Cannot wait to go back to try the fried chicken!!!", "author": "Jenny V."}

First of all, our waiter was quite annoying. Constantly hovering around the table, trying to clear dishes the moment it looked like someone might be finished. Considering they were pretty empty and had no need to turn the table, it was both bizarre and off-putting. So that didn't set a good tone.\n\nI ordered the burger, as it had been on my to-do list for a while. As far as gourmet burgers go, it was good but not great. I believe it was under-seasoned, and coming off the KronnerBurger I'd had a few days before, it just didn't match up. The fries, however, were excellent. My stepdad's mac and cheese was decent, and my mom's shrimp cocktail was good - according to her. \n\nHowever, considering the price points and the service, and the lack of being wowed by the food, I am not sure I need to return.

And it was all a let down.\n\nThe service was good and I thought the place was well decorated (except for the random metal dish at each seat that they take away as soon as you sit down). I had two problems: the food and the drinks.\n\nFirst, the alcohol. I know most restaurants will buy a bottle and mark it up by 400%, but this place takes price gouging to a whole new level. An $8 bottle of Riesling is $12 by the glass? I'm sorry, but that's just ridiculous. There wasn't a reasonable bottle to buy, and everything less than $50 was the equivalent of crap wine you buy at Safeway. Their greed even extended to beer, which I haven't seen at many other restaurants. A beer you can get for $5 down the street was $13! For shame!\n\nOkay, now the food, which was the bigger issue. It just wasn't good. I made the mistake of getting the agnolotti thinking a great restaurant had some depth past the parochial comfort food. Unfortunately the portion size is so small in comparison to the other dishes that I felt completely cheated. On the other hand, it was so under seasoned that I wouldn't have even wanted more. The mac and cheese was blah. How can you take pasta, loads of cheese, and some breadcrumbs and make it bland? I just don't get it. The fried chicken was good, but a aggressively seasoned that it was hard to eat more than a few bites without needing water (or beer in my case).\n\nThe desserts were no different. The chocolate cream pie was straight from Safeway. The pastry part was undercooked and I didn't taste any salty caramel ganache in the mound of whipped cream. The brown butter cake was okay, but the whole dish was completely one note.\n\nI'm sorry, but this just wasn't the quality that I expected from the food ... and the fact that it was pricey just hurt even more.", "author": "Akash K."}

We arrived early for a confirmed booking and were seated at the cocktail area (high table, with extremely wobbly chairs, tight seating which could barely accommodate our dishes- my husband was actually eating while holding his plate at one point). \n\nBefore getting seated, I asked whether we would be moved to a proper dining table once one opens up and were told we can move when one becomes available. \n\nAt 9.47, I asked again about our table (our reservation was for 9.45pm). We were then very rudely informed that they would not be moving us as we had already started on our entrees. No apologies, nothing whatsoever. Honestly, I would have walked right out at the onset if I had known they had no intention whatsoever of honouring my reservation. \n\nIt seems like overall standards (both food and service) have dropped over the years (I last ate here 4 years ago) and I would certainly not be returning again.

I was looking to make reservations at a nice but not too fancy restaurant. The reviews on Yelp led me to Wayfarer Tavern and they did not disappoint. Reservations were made for two Wednesday morning for that evening.\n\nThe location was convenient to our hotel in the Financial District. The decor was classic almost homey feeling with a dim candle lighting. The crowd seemed fairly sophisticated but not too stuck up or off-putting.\n\nTo the food. We started with a half dozen of the Blue Point oysters. Oysters are a must when in San Francisco even if they do come from the east coast. Well prepared and properly shucked accompanied with all the dressings. Next we had the Deviled Eggs, highly recommended via other Yelpers, another half dozen. They were definitely enjoyable, but not a must. We then shared the Organic Fried Chicken, the restaurant staple. Again, very enjoyable, but I am a sucker for Popeyes/Browns Chicken. I would definitely recommend it if your visiting. The chicken was accompanied by the Baked Macaroni & Cheese. Goes with fried chicken like lamb and tuna fish (spaghetti and meatballs?). Also, can't forget the popovers, delicious bread with silky smooth butter and black grain salt. Delicious.\n\nFor the staff, the bus boys were excellent, great service, kudos. However, our waiter seemed to be having a-not-so-upbeat Hump Day, but he was very professional and accommodating.\n\nOverall a very enjoyable experience. Tyler Florence is the man.\n\nSmile when you order!", "author": "Leon K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-26", "description": "To my surprise, my boyfriend made reservations to a place I constantly rave about but have never had the occasion to try. \n\nAMBIANCE: Imagine a cozy log cabin fully embellished with deer heads and fowl hanging from the walls, a centralized fireplace, and a fancy, modern, fully-staffed kitchen. Well, you wouldn't really find that in a cozy log cabin, but we're pretending here.\n\nSERVICE: I was afraid that we were going to be ignored throughout the night because they sat us in a dark, dim corner. Nobody puts baby in a corner, nobody. Despite being seated in a  corner, the server was attentive and kept my boyfriend's beer glass full. \n\nFOOD:\nThey start you off with a popover! A freaking pillowy, but crispy on the outside, buttery, lardy,  goodness. How could this meal be terrible? There's just no way this meal could possibly go bad!\n\nIACOPI FARM BRUSSELS SPROUTS with cider glaze, pomegranates, fried capers, parmesan: Charred, crispy brussel sprouts accompanied with the subtle sweetness of exploding pomegranate seeds that provide a mildly acidic sweetness to the dish. Needless to say this was also a great addition to our meal. \n\nROASTED MUSHROOMS with herb butter, garlic confit, mushroom puree: Mushrooms on mushrooms and more mushrooms. There were a few varieties of mushrooms that they use, but who has the time to analyze each type of mushroom when they are just all coated in their own puree. Earthy. Fragrant. Yum.\n\nMR. BF got ORGANIC FRIED CHICKEN with buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp herbs, lemon: Seriously some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. The buttermilk brine made it the juiciest and moistest I've ever had. The sage oil that they fried it in, provided a subtle sage aromatic without overpowering the dish with sage. It seriously is the most perfect (making my mouthwater just thinking about it) fried chicken ever. \n\nROASTED WHITE SEA BASS with sunchokes, bagna cauda, charred broccolini, capers, lemon vinaigrette: The worst thing to do with a fish that has a skin worthy of crisping is to have it end up soggy and paper-like. This was not the case with the sea bass. The skin was perfectly crisp and cooked to perfection. The sunchokes and broccolini were the perfect accompaniments to the fish, and the capers and vinaigrette provided that acid that fish desperately needs. \n\nPOT DE CREME: basically a deconstructed chocolate pudding pie. It had the sprinkle of what seemed like a chocolate graham cracker crust crumble atop a creamy, decadent chocolate pudding. Along with raspberry jelly and little meringues. This was served in a terrarium and rightfully so, since it reminded me of a magical fairy land. Ha. This dessert was THAT magical. \n\nOVERALL: The experience was spot on and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Here's to hoping we get to run into Tyler Florence, if he is ever in at the restaurant!", "author": "Maggie H."}

From the friendly staff to the warm, inviting dining rooms, we felt comfortable immediately. A creative cocktail list, combined with a strong wine selection helped get us started. First, popovers were delivered - they were warm, flaky and buttery. We started with the Gulf Coast shrimp cocktail. Six large prawns were brought out on ice and were accompanied by a mild but satisfying cocktail sauce which is made in house. For our main course, we had the pork chop which was topped with glazed peaches - a sweet and smoky combination that was mouthwatering. My wife had Tyler Florence's famous fried chicken. The chicken was crisp and moist but not greasy. Fried in a fragrant herb-infused oil, the chicken had layers of flavor consistent throughout all four pieces. For sides, we shared the creamy burrata whipped potatoes, who's consistency appeared too liquidy but as dinner progressed solidified to make a very tasty potato dish, and the roasted mushrooms which were also very good. The portions were large - we both had to take food home - and the prices very reasonable. This was a restaurant we had been wanting to try for a long time and we both agree that it lived up to our hype. I highly recommend  Wayfare Tavern whether you're a local or just visiting - you won't be disappointed!", "author": "Kevin S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-25", "description": "Nice place.  Food was for the most part good, had some different unique tastes that may be a hit or miss. For example, the fried chicken (most popular dish) was definitely good, tasted like gourmet fried chicken rather than the unhealthy, greasy type.  Their free bread was also amazing! However, the mac and cheese and deviled eggs had a different twist to them, and I particularly did not like the mac and cheese (though my friend did).  \n\nORGANIC FRIED CHICKEN - 4.5/5 - Yes, I agree. Probably the best fried chicken. Not fried chicken like KFC or popeyes, but gourmet, appetizing fried chicken that does not make you feel greasy or fat afterwards\n\nFREE BREAD AND BUTTER (Top Over) - 5/5 - SO GOOD! It is a bit similar to a croissant, but it was extremely tasty and complemented well with their butter.  Funny, this was my favorite at Wayfare Tavern lol\n\nDEVILED EGGS - 3/5 - it was a bit sour because it had relish.  Interesting, but I prefer traditional deviled eggs \n\nMAC & CHEESE - 2/5 - watery, weird type of cheese.  Do not recommend. \n\nFREE DESSERT - 4.5/5 - a sample of a cinnamon cake.  This was delicious as well, and I don't even have a sweet tooth. \n\nWATERMELON MOJITO - 4/5. It's good!  I recommend getting it. \n\nSERVICE - 5/5\n\nAMBIANCE - traditional, classic\n\nOVERALL - Nice dinner.  It was about $50+/person for food and drinks, so I probably wouldn't come back since there are so many other restaurants to try in SF, but it definitely was a nice dinner.  Great service, nice atmosphere, delicious drinks, and other than the mac and cheese, good food.", "author": "Raquel Y."}

Since this was our first time here, what caught my attention was the top notch service starting with the hostess to Dean our server who seemed to read my mind if I was thinking about asking for something and would appear like clockwork as if he was Phineas Fogg from the movie Around the World in 80 Days where he shows up at precisely the right time to win his wager at the Reform Club as well as the various busboys who worked our table. \n\nAs most foodies probably do, one normally does their research on a restaurant that they have never been to ahead of time and for us that mainly is the gospel according to \"yelp.\"  With that being said as well as getting guidance from our server we started off with a starter of the red beet cured Hamachi crudo which although very good and well presented, I wish there was more for what we had to pay. This was the only hiccup during our entire experience and hence the award of 4.5 out of 5.0 stars.\n\nThings quickly turned the corner when we were delighted with individual popovers served tableside to each of us and like magic and without asking Dean would appear to replenish the one that we had just consumed. My son had a glass of riesling while I opted for the Patz and Hall Chardonnay. We felt both wines complimented what we were in the mood for and it would have been cool if Dean had said that the bar could pour a 9 oz glass for an additional charge compared to the standard 5 but that was not a deal breaker for me.\n\nSides included the mac and cheese which was a huge favorite as well as the mushrooms and mashed potatoes. These were all recommended by our server but we would have probably ordered them anyway based on previous yelp reviews. All three were stellar and all of these dishes were emptied by our party by the end of the dinner.\n\nWhite Sea Bass:  I decided to order this and it was excellent with a slight crust but yet the fish was flaky and moist and the sauce that accompanied the fish. Complimenting the bass was broccolini which was nicely done.\n\nOrganic Fried Chicken:  Two of our party ordered this and hands down we truly enjoyed it. The buttermilk coating with roasted garlic along with the lemon all blended well. Love, love, love this dish and this one is a keeper!\n\nThe Tavern Burger with a organic egg added to the burger.  W-O-W. I wish I knew what TF's \"secret grind\" is because it tasted so so good. I felt bad for my son who ordered this because being the nice kid he is, he politely asked if we wanted to sample a taste but secretly, we wanted more than just one bite!\n\nDessert:  Coconut Cake which is pictured with the white chocolate frosting and the anglaise sauce. My son envisioned flakes of coconut on top of the cake which was not the case but that was not a bad thing as he loved it.\n\nNow about Dean and the busboys who worked our table.....5 stars for their service aptitude and anticipating our thoughts for minor things as refilling our water glasses the moment the last drop was taken to the endless replenishment of popovers to knowing exactly when to clear the dirty dishes throughout the meal service. Superb all the way around!\n\nIn closing, my only regret is that I did not come to the WT sooner!", "author": "Richard H."}

Yelp had it rated pretty high as well, so I felt lucky it worked out.  Sat at the bar and the bartender seemed cool to me....was helpful with the menu and got me squared away efficiently.  I heard they were known for their fried chicken...which I ordered. It was good, solid....but I suppose for a higher end spot like that, you can't expect too much more.  Now the unfortunate side dish I ordered was the mashed or whipped potatoes.  Yeah....they fell way flat.  The seasoning was pretty good but it was WAY to runny....unless that's how it's supposed to be. Still ate about half of it.....used it as a dip for the chicken!  \n\nAll in all....it's a bit pricey for what you get but again it's SF so I get it.

We're so glad we did because they were booked when we went there at 7pm on a Saturday night. \n\nThough we weren't dressed for it (we came in our hiking clothes), I loved the ambiance with the dim lighting, dark wood and classy decor. We felt super under dressed and felt judged for it too by our waiter. Regardless, we were still here to have a good time and enjoy our meal.\n\nTo start, we got the Oxtail Poutine: It was okay. The potatoes were really thick which I would have wanted a little thinner so they would crispier, but the gravey was pretty good. I usually love cheese, but the mozzarella curd was kind of interested with it. The oxtail was really good and tender. At $16 for an appetizer, I would have rather skipped this and spent it towards and entree.\n\nOrganic Fried Chicken: This was good. It was 5 pieces fried perfectly. The chicken was moist and the skin was perfectly crispy. There wasn't much seasoning, but not much was needed. Squeeze some lemon on the chicken you'll be eating everything off the bone and licking your fingers.\n\nCharred Broccolini: At first I didn't want this, but my friend ordered it anyways and it turned out to be my favorite! I love broccolini and the flavors that they mixed with this was so good! I loved the charred and lemon flavors! A tad on the pricey side, but definitely worth an add to the meal.\n\nThey also give you complimentary popovers which I thought was hard, dry and flavorless. I ate the inside since it was a little softer, but I didn't get seconds when they offered.\n\nOverall, I thought the meal was pretty good. It's definitely a bit on the pricier side since it's fine dining, but some dishes were worth it. I felt that our waiter was judging us since we weren't dressed up and we didn't finish our popovers. We didn't get the best service and even got a bit of attitude. I'm on the fence of if I'd want to come back.", "author": "Sophia Y."}

It only seats 4, so it was like having our own personal bartender/area. The cocktails are made with great attention and detail. SO GOOD. I also tried Tyler Florence's Sauvignon Blanc which was nice and crisp. \n\nWe started with the infamous popovers. DROOL WORTHY. How do they make these things so delicious?!?! \n\nNext we had the chicken liver pate as an appetizer. It's a tad on the sweeter side. My only complaint was that the crostinis that come with it were wayyyy too stale. To the point that I could barely even eat it. So we requested more popovers to just spread it on those. *Thumbs up*\n\nThen for some reason it took FOREVERRRRRRRRR to get our main courses. I'd say we were waiting a good 45 min. Meh. But finally they came so all was well. I ordered the scallops. They were a bit too well done for my liking, but my date thought they were amazing. I tried his fried chicken and I thought it was one of the best chicken I've had! It was tender and almost fall off the bone. Him, on the other hand, wasn't too crazy about it. And they were a tad underdone once you got closer to the bone because of how pink it was....\n\nWe ended the meal with the complimentary coffee cake were super moist and flavorful.\n\nOverall, it was a good meal.

I've been watching his show since I was in high school and loved his original episodes of Tyler's Ultimate where he would travel to different places and then cook an inspired dish. \n\nSo, given my foodie admiration, we found ourselves staying in a place between Telegraph Hill and the Financial District...PERFECT! We made our reservations on Yelp and moseyed on over. \n\nWe were quickly greeted upon entering and just as equally, seated at a table in the back corner by the fireplace. Intimate. Cozy. Casual. Our waiter was very nice and was attentive. From the service, the popovers...everything was amazing. We ordered the burger and the filet for the birthday boy. Both arrived within a reasonable amount of time and beautifully displayed. \n\nHis filet was perfect, which was what I cared more about for his birthday. Meat was cooked to order, deliciously juicy, and plated with large crispy fried onion rings. The confit shallots were a little large for the plate but does go in keeping with the rustic theme. \n\nMy burger was...okay. I've had better. I had about half of it and packed the rest away for another date. It just seemed to lack meaty flavor. I was hoping for that umami hit and it never really delivered. I even ordered an egg on top of it but it too was flavorless. A one note un-wonder. \n\n I had fries with mine and ordered the mac and cheese because the yelpers say it's amazing...and it was! This place bangs out amazing side dishes. The mac and cheese is ultra decadent and I would recommend sharing it. 2-4 bites and your palate will probably be tired of the rich, creamy, and fatty dish. \n\nDessert....I had heard about their pies and was determined to get a classic order, maybe the chocolate cream or the Banana cream...oh, but the waiter so adamantly recommended their seasonal special, the Darlene Peach pie with brown butter ice cream and rosemary candy. \n\nOMG, so...ridiculously delicious. I love peaches, this dessert was made for me. I didn't even care that it came with the ice cream. The peaches sing in this dish, they're cooked to the perfect level of done-ness and still have some bite to them. The crust....the crust is amazing. Raise the crust! Perfectly flaky, and buttery, and tender, and thick to compliment the luscious peaches. \n\nOverall, great meal. Detracted a star for the sub par burger.", "author": "Jennyfer N."}

Besides the fact that Tyler Florence is one of my favorite celebrity chefs. Considering how disappointing other celebrity chef restaurants have turned out to be, this particular establishment supersedes all expectations. \n\nThe decor and ambience is perfect; sophisticated yet informal. The noise level is moderate, even though the place is always packed with guests. The decor reflect a hunting lodge, perhaps Victorian or Edwardian in period. \n\nThe food is incredible. Ordering a few plates and sharing is always a great idea. To start, the shrimp cocktail and beed tartare are great options. The tartare is topped with an egg, celery leaves, dill, and radish. The shrimp cocktail does not disappoint as well. Next, you have to try the Fried Chicken, as this is the restaurants signature dish. The meat is tender and flavorful. It is garnished with fried sage and thyme, along with wedges of lemons, the combination of flavors are unbelievably good. \n\nFinally, order the macaroni and cheese (OMG) and the browned butter cabbage with black truffles. Both sides are finger licking good. I all but licked the mac and cheese platter, and the cabbage was charred and smoky, dressed with brown butter and black truffles. \n\nI also recommend bringing a bottle of your favorite wine, as corkage is only $25.00. Reservations are easy to make on Open Table, and the staff are friendly, approachable, and knowledgable. The fact that no one comes off as pretentious or obnoxious; the space is small but comfortable, which creates a pleasant atmosphere and enjoyable experience.

At our table, we had the fried chicken, deviled eggs, butter salad, burger w/ egg, broccolini, mac n cheese and the famous naughty donuts. Unfortunately, the service was not up to par with the food. \n\nFood breakdown:\nDeviled Eggs - These weren't a table favorite. We were excited to try these based on other reviews, but weren't overwhelmed by them.  They had a strong mustard taste.  Not something I would order in the futuer.  \nButter Salad - Loved it!  It was fresh and light and had a very tasty dressing.  Very simple and good. A great way to start the meal. \nFried Chicken - A must have!  It was cooked perfectly - crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  The herbs that were cooked were the perfect touch!  \nBurger w/ egg - Very tasty burger.  If you are a burger lover, you would be satisfied with this dish.  \nBroccolini - A must have side.  It was charred a little on the outside and paired perfectly with the chicken.  \nMac n Cheese - This was good.  Nice and creamy with a crunchy topping.  I'm more of the veggie as a side lover and could do without ordering this dish again.  \nNaughty Donuts - Made to order and simply amazing!  So good!!  Loved the salted caramel sauce.\n\nService breakdown:\nIf it was based on the hostess (shoulder length blonde hair), this review would be one star. She was absolutely rude from the beginning to the end of our meal. She let us know as she was seating us (in a snooty fashion) that we needed to be done at a specific time since they had someone else reserved for our table. Keep in mind, we did have reservations set up ahead of time. I have never been given a time limit on my eating experience, but ok let's go with it. We were seated next to a table that were finishing up their appetizers and starting on their main dishes. We placed our orders right away as we all knew what we wanted (thanks to our Yelp friends and photos). The table next to us was finishing up their naught donuts right when we were getting ready to place our order (and about the same time the hostess came by to do a time check). Instead of a dessert menu, the waitress came back with our bill. We let her know that we wanted to order dessert and she told us that the hostess had said we needed to close out our bill for the next table.  We let her know that we still had 15 minutes left on our \"clock\", but apparently the donuts are made to order so there wasn't time for us to place the order, have them made and for us to eat them. Long story short, after speaking to a manager we got our donuts on the house, but it was a very dissapointing end to an otherwise great meal.  \n\nI do need to give a call out to our server, Jennifer, she was very friendly and had great suggestions and description of the foods. She had the uncomfortable position of being the delivery person between the hostess and our table, but she provided good service and a professional attitude.  \n\nLong story short, the food was amazing, but the way we were treated by both the hostess and manager was unacceptable.  I am still giving the restaurant 3 stars because the food really was amazing, but it's the whole experience that makes a place stand out as exceptional.", "author": "Melissa B."}

The lone king atop the mountain of breaded poultry, time and time again, is Ad Hoc's Buttermilk Fried Chicken (located in Yountville).  A lot of places come close to taking the crown, but none have actually claimed the throne.  With this in mind, I visited Wayfare Tavern, eager to try its famed fried chicken.   Who will, in this head to head slobber knocker between two titan chefs of Americana cuisine, win?  Tyler Florence or Thomas Keller?  \n\nAt Tavern, the fried chicken tastes and looks fresh.  There is a zest to the batter, coupled with the lemon provided, that transcends the normal flavor profile of fried chicken.  It's light.  You may even consider it \"healthy\".  The chicken is juicy but not greasy. Interesting and different are the two words that best describe this dish.  Which is to say - I liked it.  You won't find this variation of southern goodness anywhere else in the Bay.  \n\nOther notable dishes include the burger (ripe with juices, not overcooked, toasted bun, excellent thin fries), the steak tartare (hands down my favorite dish of the night), and of course the legendary popovers (get your fill - they're hot and delicious).\n\nWhich leads us back to my original question: is Wayfare the best restaurant for fried chicken in the Bay Area?  Depends on what you like.  You can't go wrong eating the chicken here.  \n  \nSide note: I met Tyler Florence in person during my visit.  Dude was gracious and very cool.", "author": "Huy D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-28", "description": "As a longtime fan of Tyler Florence, it's pretty amazing that Wayfare Tavern has slipped through my Yelp-happy fingertips in the three years that the restaurant has been open. I just never got around to coming, which was really silly on my part. After a less than stellar experience at Bluestem Brasserie last week, my girlfriend and I impulsively made a reservation here.\n\nRight off the bat, I noticed the decor. Imagine walking into a swanky West Egg restaurant meets 1920s underground speakeasy joint in Harlem. I felt like Nick Carraway when I first stepped inside, taking it all in. If you get my literary and historical references, you are definitely my kind of people. If that was the look they were going for, they absolutely nailed it. Classy but not gaudy. You really do feel like you have been transported to a different time. Ambience - 5 stars.\n\nFor starters, we had the Roasted Corn Soup which had lobster in it. I love corn and hate seafood, but the lobster's flavor perfectly complemented the corn. If you like bisques, do try this soup. I would definitely get this again. We also ordered the Deviled Eggs. It was creamy, which I did not expect. I've never had deviled eggs before, so I can't really say how Wayfare's version stacks up. But it was really delicious! I should also mention here that presentation is lovely. Every dish looks like it was carefully put together. By the way, you know how most celebrity chefs just put their name on their restaurant but you don't see them around? Tyler Florence is super hands-on, and if you dine here, you'll most likely get a glimpse of him working the open kitchen. Unfortunately, he wasn't there tonight, which was probably for the best because I would have been starstruck and speechless.\n\nEntr\u00e9es:\nOrganic Fried Chicken: LOVED IT. We quickly noticed that it was not greasy the way you expect fried chicken to be...amazing. What impressed me most was how the characteristics of garlic, lemon, and what seemed like a handful of different spices never overpowered each other. This is the signature dish at Wayfare, so if you're planning to dine here, it's a must. \n\nWayfare Burger: grass-fed beef, brie, br\u00eeoche, and bacon. We decided to opt for the fried egg (an additional $2). If you are ever offered an egg on a burger...DO IT. Even the bun itself is fantastic. Although I'm not a huge burger fan, I was curious on how theirs would compare to the likes of Five Guys, Umami, and Burger Bar. Result? This burger is up there, and along with Umami and Five Guys, I now have my trifecta of burgers should I ever decide to love red meat.\n\nThe waiter also suggested the Baked Mac n' Cheese as a side, so we ordered that as well. Although tasty, it was probably the least memorable on our table. Perhaps I have been spoiled by the mac n' cheese at soul food establishments.\n\nTo sum it all up, Wayfare does a fine job at fancy-ing up American food and adding their own touch. The staff is really attentive without being overbearing. You can take your chances and just walk in, but I'd honestly recommend a reservation so you can have some say in where you'll be seated. We'll definitely be back, and hopefully see the man himself!", "author": "Olivia V."}

My love is fried chicken if you don't follow and know that about me already.  I had to order this $24 a la carte dish.  It is beautifully presented with fresh herbs all around, in the chicken skin, roasted and topped on the chicken, sprinkled around the chicken.  You can distinguish the drumstick, the wing, and then the white meat parts are semi ball shaped.  All the white meat pieces were dry and the dark meat pieces were delicious.  You shouldn't get rid of the chicken skin because that's where all the flavor lies.  Overall, I was a bit disappointed.\n\nSince the chicken was a la carte, I got the sishito peppers as a side.  These are a Japanese pepper with thin walls, semi-sweet to occasionally hot insides, depending on the pepper you get.  They were roasted with garlic and anchovy although I couldn't taste the latter at all.  Sishito peppers have a distinct taste so I would recommend sharing this with four people (it's a big portion for a side) in case you end up not liking them. \n\nNext would be the Wayfare Burger which has brie, roasted purple onions, pickle slices, and then all the regular fixings.  This was GOOD.  The meat to bun ratio was perfect.  I like just enough bun to hold the burger together without falling apart but not too much.  The brie made the burger creamier and the sweet pickles offset that creaminess.  The pickles, housemade I'm guessing, were great even on its own.  I could probably eat a jar full of those.\n\nGoing backwards, we got the oxtail poutine as an appetizer.  Cheese curds in poutine usually have a mild flavor but this was bitter.  I'm not sure if that was intentional but this made it difficult to eat.  The oxtail was shredded and a little tough.  The \"gravy\" portion is more like broth, flavorful but thin, which can make the fries soggy really fast.  There are also peas in this dish which are cooked al dente.\n\nThe Wayfare Burger made it to my top 5 list but I was unhappy with how all the other dishes turned out so I will need to give this place a 3.  They're solidly made items but with a bit of a confusion on execution.", "author": "Shannon L."}

This is the type of place that knows how to serve and serve well. The place setting was replaced after every course and the tables were wiped clean.\n\nReason enough to go if none of the above were true: the popovers. These were amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-08-29", "description": "This was a mixed experience.  The ambience is really authentic old-school English tavern, with multiple levels, rooms and bar areas to create unique experiences.  The food was mostly good but not great, but I think chef is trying too hard to impress with fancy food and not so much with comfort food that would be appropriate for the setting.  Yes, the fried chicken is good, maybe great, and the huge portion makes for great leftovers.  However, the halibut served over leek puree, with shelling beans, olives, pine nuts and citrus, while delicious, is simply too precious to serve in a tavern.  It's a nice touch to serve popovers instead of bread; however while they were impressively popped-over, I think they were overcooked.  The deviled eggs appetizer were a winner, savory and tasting just a tad of the sea, however, the presentation is again, a bit precious for the tavern setting. \n\nThe bruschetta-like buratta with fresh peaches was a mess, the preparation completely negating the freshness of the cheese.  Baked macaroni and cheese looked inviting but was amazingly devoid of cheese flavor.  Yelpers raved about the poutine but it's no longer on the menu.\n\nDesserts were uniformly delicious.  The sticky toffee cake is appropriately sweet, sticky and caramelly, served with bits of toffee and orange peel ice cream.  The real star though was the doughnuts.  I can't say that I've had a better doughnut anywhere.  Really.  These yeasty beauties were fresh out of the fryer, judiciously glazed and dusted with brown sugar, and served with creme fraiche and peach puree.\n\nThere's a nice selection of craft cocktails and beers.  The wines-by-the-glass list is large (and pricey) and the bottle selection is pretty good too, with a large number of 1/2 bottles.\n\nService was informative and attentive.\n\nThe price point is high for a \"tavern\" but looks can be deceiving.", "author": "Eric Y."}

I even got tickets to meet him for the second time and get his test kitchen book signed recently thanks to my awesome husband. (First time was at SF chefs.) We had our wedding dinner in the room upstairs. It was the perfect setting as we wanted to give our guests who were mostly from out of town a true SF experience. The coordinator's attention there was less than what I had hoped for. I understand they host a ton of events but every time I called to talk to her, I felt like I was a new client she had never spoken to before because she couldn't seem to recall which event I was referring to even though we had been emailing often. \n\nThis is a bit of a tangent but in case anyone is thinking of planning their wedding with them. The coordinator also recommended a florist for my bouquet and I was really disappointed somehow even though we spoke extensively about what I wanted and what she planned to create. My only request was for garden roses and she sent me photos from the flower mart that I liked. Imagine my surprise the day of when I got not a single garden rose.\n\nSo on to the food. The infamous fried chicken. I get it. It's cooked sous vide so it may look red inside even though it is fully cooked. I didn't have a problem BUT for people who are not used to this might (and will) freak out. It may be nice for servers to explain this in advance of serving just to reassure diners. I was bummed that some of our guests told me after the fact that they didn't enjoy the food because they thought it was undercooked. And considering we paid for it all, you never want to see food unfinished and left on the plates.\n\nI know this sounds like a bad review. But I do like Wayfare. I just think that when it comes to your wedding day, you hope your expectations can be met when you have taken the time to communicate them. At the end of the day, it was the most memorable time. But every wedding has its small imperfections. I felt like I needed to share so that other brides can set their expectations from the start.", "author": "Sarah A."}

Love the deer above the mantel. It was packed during lunch hour and we weren't allowed to be seated until the whole group was present.\n\nOnce we sat down, we ordered drinks and we all got an iced tea. Their iced tea is very different from any of the ice teas I've had at other places. They have a little ball of what could be sorbet that acts like an ice cube. They to sweeten it up they give you a little things of pomegranate. Super good!\n\nThe bread that came on the side was flakey and light but kind of cakey at the same time. The butter that is served with it was super creamy and once you had a bite full of both in your mouth, it was just absolute heaven! Maybe its because I'm a bread lover I dont know.\n\nFor lunch I ordered the poutin (if that is the correct spelling) and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was oh so yummy! The bread crumb topping was nice and crispy to give it some texture and it was cheesey enough so that every shell had a coating of thick cheese. I would definitely order that again! The poutin was pretty good. The only thing that was off putting was the oil on the side, it just didn't look appealing. However, the ox tail that was used was cooked very well. The meat was soft and tender, instead of hard and crunchy.\n\nWould definitely come here again and try the chicken.", "author": "Jerrica N."}

Of course they have no spots open but I decide to try my luck. My friend & I were hovering by the bar by the front when I noticed one of the outdoor tables outside had just opened up - we grabbed it & were able to enjoy a nice dinner under the heat lamps!\n\n~~COST~~\nMy 1/3 of the meal (3 drinks, 1 starter, 3 entrees, 2 desserts): $50 total.\n\n~~AMBIANCE~~\nIt's FiDi so expectedly sophisticated, busy, & fairly crowded but still a warm atmosphere. Sitting outside we got to experience it in our own little world & people watch the diners inside - FiDi at night is relatively empty.\n\n~~SERVICE~~\nGreat! You'd think being outside the waitstaff might be more sparse, but I felt like our server was always there at the right moment & my water glass was always filled.\n\nMUST-HAVES: Butcher's filet, coconut panna cotta!\n\n~~DRINKS~~\n* Aviation - 3.5 stars\n(gin, lemon, maraschino liqueur, liqueur de violette. $11)\nI tried a sip, my friend found this incredibly tart but I thought the gin was the most prevalent flavor. Fairly enjoyable.\n\n* Pomegranate Fizz - 4 stars\n(vodka, pomegranate, ginger rosemary syrup, brachetto. $11)\nThis was nice & light, & it still got me pretty tipsy though the vodka flavor wasn't too strong. I chose this because of the ginger, but this was really subtle - you can taste the pomegranate & sweetness of the brachetto much more. \n\n* Anderson Valley Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout - 4 stars\nTried a sip of my friend's - we all really enjoyed its flavor! \n\n~~STARTERS~~\n* Free popover - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wayfare-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=o2tp4h5jcUwEDPewdC1Xtw#v6T0wi6_KWIuYBwSARzcdw\nIncredible! Now I know why everyone mentions the popovers - this was warm & fresh out of the oven, the texture soft & buttery, & it isn't too filling (the bread is like a shell - not solid throughout. Quality, not quantity!).\n\n* Deviled Eggs - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wayfare-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=o2tp4h5jcUwEDPewdC1Xtw#CpBzuZtT4hCt6a_TywHxtg\n(old bay yolks, bread & butter pickles, celery, crisp gulf shrimp. $11)\nI'm not sure what the hype is all about - this was fine, nothing that stands out too much. The yolks were a little too dense/grainy. The crisps on top were a nice addition but there was probably 90% fried breading (we couldn't even tell that it was shrimp until we looked at the menu again).\n\n~~ENTREES~~\n* Organic fried chicken - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wayfare-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=o2tp4h5jcUwEDPewdC1Xtw#TeYwm2OCaMPx_Hjnw_OcQw\n(buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herbs, lemon. $24)\nThis was very tender, the chicken moist, & the breading was on the softer side (thing regular style KFC, vs. crispy). The herbs on top added a nice flavor. Good, but by far not the best I've had in SF - for that, go to Town Hall!\n\n* Roasted pumpkin mezzaluna - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wayfare-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=o2tp4h5jcUwEDPewdC1Xtw#TWkSTnQbkhfkvf5g9y_DBA\n(braised cabbage, roasted garlic, herbed breadcrumbs. $19)\nThe cabbage was overcooked, soft, & basically tasteless - maybe that is the style, but I didn't think it added anything to the dish. By far the best part was the sweet pumpkin filling, & I liked that the mezzaluna (like a ravioli) was soft. The slight crunch from the bread crumbs was a nice touch too.\n\n* Butcher's filet - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wayfare-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=o2tp4h5jcUwEDPewdC1Xtw#dRbIHQZ9bKlg3M35x04gQA\n(shallot confit, bonemarrow bordelaise, crispy onion, marjoram. $28)\nThe winner of the night! I loved the incredible tenderness of the filet, & it was well cooked on the outside but pink & soft on the inside. Medium-rare done just right. The shallots were sweet, the sauce delicious, & we swear it had some sort of lavender or floral flavor that made the aroma amazing.\n\n~~DESSERTS~~\n* Winter Citrus - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wayfare-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=o2tp4h5jcUwEDPewdC1Xtw#9PQPB1eJVegBkcFsY9rSQw\n(mandarin mochi, grapefruit givre, steamed lime pudding, clotted buttermilk, pavlova. $11)\nWell described, but a big mish-mash in practice, w/ some parts that worked better than others. We all made the mistake of eating the grapefruit rind around the sorbet (the middle piece in the photo) and it was crazy bitter. The cake on the right was tasty, & the mochi pretty good. The little dots of flavor didn't add much, mostly for decor.\n\n* Coconut panna cotta - 5 stars!\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wayfare-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=o2tp4h5jcUwEDPewdC1Xtw#o2tp4h5jcUwEDPewdC1Xtw\n(chai ice, coconut candy, mango pearls, mint, lemongrass. $11)\nAmazing! This is softer than most panna cottas - more like a silky tofu texture, almost soupy. My friend aptly described this dish as having a \"plethora\" of flavors. The crisped coconut pieces on top - surprisingly tasty!", "author": "Ziyan C."}

Here he uses his imagination and skills to offer creative comfort food to rustic delights infused with fresh local ingredients.\n\nDidn't start my night off with any appetizers but I certainly entertained the cocktail menu. From there I ordered the \"Tavern Sour\" (Wayfare Tavern Select Eagle Rare Single Barrel, Yellow Chartreuse, Herb Syrup, Egg White). Drink was so good I ordered another a bit later. As for my entree, Prime Imperial Bavette Steak with carmelized cauliflower, Cinderella pumpkin puree, maitake escabeche, and orach spinach. Delicious! Tantilizing! Bavette Steak was perfectly seasoned, cooked and delivered. Carmelized cauliflower was a nice touch while the maitake mushrooms marinated in escabeche was superb. The reddish/purplish color of the Orach spinach was different and innovative. Great combination. \n\nFrom service to taste to overall execution everything was excellent.

The intimate setting with the tiny open kitchen gives you comfort as you can see exactly how the cooks are preparing your food. They start you off with a popover, which is an airy pastry with an almost croissant-like outside. It's a substantial way to start the meal, especially when slathered with the black truffle salted butter. \n\nMy boyfriend and I went with what the restaurant is lauded for, the burger and the fried chicken. The burger patty is extremely thick and well-seasoned. Although it's not the most unique burger I've had, I could find nothing wrong with it. The shoestring fries are also extremely addicting. The fried chicken came in a generous portion with about 5 pieces. I loved the breading, which had a fragrant rosemary seasoning on it. I can probably count on two hands the number of times I've had fried chicken in my life, but this was fried to my liking, with a light breading and juicy meat inside. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese, which wasn't particularly memorable. We ended up leaving half of it on the table because the rest of the meal was relatively heavy as well.

It wasn't overdressed with sauces or seasonings. A little salt already on the plate and a squeeze of lemon were all I needed. I just wish there was some sort of starch served with the dish, perhaps mashed potatoes. We chose to forgo dessert because we had one too many popovers.

Rich gooey ox tail sauce poured on fried potatoes... did somebody say comfort food?!\n\nEntrees\n7) Wayfare Burger with fried egg - Shared 1/4 of the burger amongst seven of us.

Still amazed that we fit seven in a booth, considering my girth.  The service was pretty good as they continually offered popover refills and left us water flasks for refills.  The alcoholic drinks took a bit of time to come, but eventually got there.  I like the casual feel for brunch and the more relaxed atmosphere without people hovering outside the restaurant during the day.

Until a manager (young nice black gentleman) apologized). Left the place and still added 15% tip despite one of the ugliest and ill service accommodation. Never again. (will also YELP as this is unacceptable). Your waiter should be fired. What arrogance! Real dumb ass.", "author": "Bing M."}

The fried chicken was delicious. The whipped potatoes and the asparagus (with an egg on top) were good too. I didn't really like the mac and cheese because it's made with smoked olive oil and the flavor was too smoky for me. Overall - four stars and totally worth visiting!", "author": "Miranda O."}

As a big fan of Chef Tyler Florence, I was looking forward to it and was definitely not disappointed to say the least. \n\nThe Bartlett room is found on the third floor of the restaurant. It's a long rectangular room with one of their walls occupied by a glass-enclosed wine cellar. They placed a small bar area on one corner while the rest of the room was occupied by a long dining table that was able to accommodate approximately 50 guests.  \n\nThe food was served family style so everyone was able to try a variety of dishes. We were started off with their popovers, which were light, airy and crisp. Then, for appetizers, we got to try the deviled eggs and their \"little gem\" salad (compressed strawberries, Brie, avocado & pine nuts). The entrees were the organic fried chicken, halibut with a wild rice risotto and corn & cheese agnolotti. For our side, we had the mac and cheese.  \n\nMy favorite dish was definitely the fried chicken. It was very flavorful, moist meat inside and delicate but crispy exterior. Despite it being fried, it still tasted quite light and non-greasy. It was the best fried chicken I've ever had to date until I tried the fried chicken from Farmstead in Napa Valley a few days later (but that is for another review). Between me and my boyfriend, we could've honestly easily eaten the whole plate to ourselves. We probably almost did since the other guests next to us didn't seem to eat much...we definitely do not like wasting food haha. \n\nI would definitely love to come back and dine here again on my next visit to SF to try other dishes. Wished he'd open a restaurant in NY!", "author": "Jaclyn G."}

I would have also drank every single cocktail on the menu.  Its impossible to decide and I wish I could be one of those competitive eaters so that I could at least attempt to try and eat and drink everything on it.\n\nIts a relatively short walk from the hotel we were staying at on California St.  I made a reservation for 5pm and we were early so we got to also sit at the bar.  There wasn't enough drink menus to go around so I had to wonder around and find one.\n\nThe bar is gorgeous.  It was around sunset and the lighting is just perfect.  My eye balls couldn't take every detail in.  \n\nWe started with the Urban Garden, Citroen vodka, st. Germain, cucumber, radish.\nIt was your childhood summer memories wrapped up in a glass and now you also get to enjoy a buzz as well.  The most outstanding cocktail of the evening.\n\nOur reserved table was upstairs and we were the second couple to be sat in the dining room.  My one and only complaint, its small in here.  Once the room filled up I felt really cramped.  While all is beautifully decorated its almost too much for the size of the space.  If you really want to appreciate the interior design I suggest getting there early like we did.\n\nPop Overs, hot delicious Pop Overs with butter.  Really, real butter.  You cant get any better than that.\n\nMy husband and I ordered the Oysters on the half shell.  3 Half Oysters for each of us.  They were good.  I expected better but their Oysters, inherently fishy I suppose.\n\nIf I could have ordered a vat of the Lobster and Corn Chowder and swam around in it I would have.  It was presented with the solid ingredients placed in the bottom of the bowl.  Then the luscious decadent chowder is poured over the top of it.  Steaming golden chowder it succulent Lobster crispy Potatoes and the freshest of veggies.  Gold and sunshine mulling around in mouth I tell you.  Amazing!\n\nMy second drink was the Pool Side.  Again, fresh delicious fruit combined with a wonderful liquor.  Who doesn't love Watermelon?  Who doesn't love Watermelon and booze?  I love both, believe you me.  \n\nI was so stuffed by the time my entree came that I couldn't finish it all.  I ordered the Sonoma Duck, mustard green tortellini , chanterelles, double consomm\u00e9,\npoached winter citrus.  It was wonderful.  It was rich and delightful and made a great winter style feast.  \n\nLike I said earlier, if only I could competitively eat.  Id eat everything!  \n\nMy last drink was the Sutro Sour.  It was gin, honey, rosemary, chartreuse. a sunset elixir.  A fine finish to our wonderful evening. \n\nEverything was delicious.  Everything was perfect.  Cocktails that I could only imagine about.  Food that I would drive days for.  This is one of those bucket list restaurants that you must, must, must try.", "author": "Ivy R."}

When we arrived we were promptly seated in a long booth.\n\nWe ordered drinks and a bunch of different food items: the deviled eggs, lentil soup, several orders of the burger, and caramelized mushrooms. \n\nDrinks came out quickly as did our starters. The lentil soup was a little strange for me with the peach in it, but my mom seemed to like it. The deviled eggs were beautiful and delicious! The husband usually isn't impressed with deviled eggs, but he claimed that these were the best deviled eggs he's ever had. That is a HUGE compliment! \n\nAfter our starters we just hung out, drank, and talked. However, it seemed to be taking quite a while for our entrees to come out. It wasn't too bad because we were in good company and we weren't starving. The waitress came several times to apologize for the wait.\n\nThe food finally came out maybe around 9:45. The food was all very good. The acclaimed burger was very good and cooked perfectly. I've had better burgers elsewhere, but this was a very decent burger with a great meat patty. They were also very nice to split the burger for my husband and I. They put the fried egg on his half, which is perfect because I prefer no egg on mine. \n\nLastly, my family had brought a cake for me along with 30 candles. The pastry chef was nice enough to place and light all 30 candles (despite the fire hazard). They cut and served the cake.\n\nNow since we had waited so long, the manager took care of our appetizers and waived the cake cutting fee, which was a very nice gesture.\n\nOverall, it was a nice night with good food, but the night left me a little wanting.

His timing throughout the meal was perfect.  He provided the type of service one expects when dining here.\n\nMy son and I had the Fried Chicken, which as always, was so delicious.  My husband had the Prime Beef Tartare, which he said was \"OK\".  Next time, I am sure he will be going back to his usual steak.

Not only because of the Tyler Florence title, but the entire experience was well worth the visit.\n\nService: Lane was very hospitable and invested his time serving us. We definitely were the youngest in the restaurant and we usually get less attention when dining at higher end restaurants. He went well beyond regular service and gave us advice with his light humor and charm.\n\nWe ordered and we rated:\nDandelion Wine - 5\nNormandie Sour- 5\nWayfare Caesar's Salad - 3.5\nOrganic Fried Chicken - 5+\n\nLet me tell you that it's not a lie when other yelpers mention the organic fried chicken is a signature dish. No wonder this never leaves the menu. It's a complex crisp fried organic italian herb-esque marinated chicken, very tender but not too juicy where the chicken tastes oily. Amazing. Jawdropping. Tell me the secret! Not to mention I returned the following week. hah!\n\nWayfare Caesar's Salad is just an appetizer. I requested the dressing on the side. It was a vertically cut romaine lettuce, lightly topped with citrus and sardines (i think?) so it had a hint of sourness. Not much of a sardines person so I can't say I liked it but others might.\n\nThe drinks were one of a kind at Wayfare. My Normandie Sour had an egg white foam, spiced touch to the sweet/sour that hit home in my cocktail favs. I heart sweet-spicey cocktails. The Dandelion Wine looks like a mojito but its rum, champagne, mint, lychee and something else... Both were GREAT MIXOLOGY inventions.\n\nIt's an adult atmosphere and on the louder side for dinner. If you want yo have a table, I definitely recommend you make reservations even dueing the week. I went at 5pm and no seating except for the kitchen bar was available. I'm grateful of that chance because we had the best service and entertaining view of the chefs creating the various dishes.\n\nLet me say that this was the best FiDi restaurant I've went to--and I've gone through a good amount for the last few weeks of my stay.

What I got was an odd mussel dish with  al dente leeks as a vegetable, gritty mussels and no bowl for the shells. My husband's salmon was mushy; the pasta of the day was butternut squash and cranberries. The fried chicken seemed okay.

Details. Details.\n\nOwner: Chef Tyler Florence from the Food Network!  That's already a very good reason to dine here.\n\nI love d\u00e9cor.  It borrows many characteristics from the Barbary Coast era with the dark wood, brick walls, fireplace, and rustic finishes.  Imagine the age with top hats and suspenders for the men, and long gowns with corsets for the women.  It's definitely a very elegant space.  \n\nThe food is ever changing due to what's available seasonally and locally.  But rest assured that everything is and always will be delicious.  Some of my favorites are:\n\n- Deviled Eggs (old bay yolks, bread and butter pickles, celery, crisp gulf shrimp)\n- Organic Fried Chicken (buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herb)\n- Braised Pork Shoulder \n- Butcher's Filet (shallot confit, bone marrow bordelaise, crispy torpedo onion)\n- Darlene Peach Pie (brown butter ice cream, rosemary candy) LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS ONE!!\n- Chocolate Cream Pie (TCHO chocolate pudding, salty caramel ganache, devils food cake)  \n\nYou also get a delicious little popover in the beginning.  It's so light and flakey.  Sometimes I eat too much that I'm practically full before I even touch my entr\u00e9e.\n\nI don't see this on the menu for some reason, but they have a delicious parmesan truffle popcorn that is absolutely addicting.  Warning:  you just might not stop eating! \n\nThey have an eclectic gourmet cocktail menu with lots of specialty drinks as well.  \n\nThere is a beautiful wine cellar upstairs for price dining experiences.  \n\nI would suggest making reservations.

The poutine was served almost cold, the popovers just weren't as amazing as other reviewers were saying, and the burger really wasn't that good at all! A $25 burger should be phenomenal! The bun was dry and falling apart and the meat was packed together too tightly. Also, the sauce was barely recognizable (maybe a teaspoon on there!).

Tyler Florence achieved a fine dining trifecta with the food, decor, and service. My last visit was very, very disappointing. The service was horrible. It took 20 minutes for our cocktails to arrive and our second round arrived 15 minutes after we finished our meal. However, when the cocktails did arrive, they were very well crafted. The food, albeit good, arrived lukewarm and in very small portions. The restaurant was not busy, we were able to walk in without a reservation, so I'm not really sure why the delay in service other than our server was socializing with other servers and not focused on his customers. There was nothing on the menu for my vegan daughter. The server said the chef could make her a special dish for $20. My daughter left in tears after she was served about two ounces of some type of an unappealing salad concoction, which required us to find her sustainable food after we left.

A reasonable price, classy and relaxing atmosphere, good service with delicious food and nothing too fancy or foo foo.

On the second floor they have a Billiard Room which can be a dining room for 14 people or a room to play pool as the name suggests.\n\nWe arrived at 1pm and were seated right away.  We ordered a couple bottles of wine suggested by the waitress that were excellent.  The table ordered a lot of items off the menu:\n\nFried Chicken:  a different twist to one of my favorite foods.  It was mostly boneless, moist, and seasoned with a lot of different herbs.  \n\nBurger:  Can't go wrong with a burger and fries.  Good sized grass-fed patty on a fresh bun with shoe string fries.  \n\nMac & cheese:  Nothing beats homemade mac & cheese but their version is better than most restaurant made versions.  Creamy, rich, perfect textured comfort food.\n\nThe rest of the table ordered Filet, steak and the lobster rolls, and risotto.  Everyone was content and satisfied with the service and food.  \n\nMinimum balance for use of the Billiard Room is $500 on Food & Beverage, $100 for use of the room, and 22% gratuity.  \n\nSo my new bride and I were happy that we chose Wayfare Tavern.

Normally, I think popovers taste too eggy, but this one was perfect.\n\nThe starters were a pear and endive salad and deviled eggs. I wasn't a fan of the Humboldt Fog on the salad, but the deviled eggs were nice and creamy with the added crispy texture from the crispy gulf shrimp.\n\nNext up were the entrees, fried chicken and pan seared salmon.  The fried chicken  was good, but the herbs were a bit too much after one piece (too much rosemary!). The salmon and broccoli pur\u00e9e were horribly flavorless, one bite was one bite too many.\n\nThe best was saved for last, the toffee pudding.

Much to her disappointment Tyler was off on the day we visited but nevertheless the good was still delish. The restaurant is cozy - it's sort of hipster meets old school charm but the beauty is in the details. As for food...\n\nDeviled eggs were on point. The presentation was flawless and flavor had the perfect combination of horseradish and pearl onion. \n\nPopovers are gourmet. They are flakey yet hollow. I do like mine a little breadier but even so, it was probably a good thing they weren't as dense as I like because you wouldn't have much room for anything else.\n\nFor dinner we ordered the organic fried chicken over roasted garlic and crisp woody herbs. The portion was massive - 5 pieces total and I only ate 2. A little surprised the roasted garlic was more of a garnish -- it wasn't easy to remove from the casing which is a shame because I love roasted garlic. Overall the chicken was good but I was expecting it to be the best chicken I'd ever had -- but maybe that's putting a lot of pressure on chicken. It wasn't as crispy as you might expect - in fact the coating kind of fell off as I ate it. I would probably order something different next time.\n\nAlso ordered the Imperial Prime Flat Iron Steak with chanterelle mushrooms, charred green garlic and asparagus. This dish was top shelf. Steak was perfectly prepared and the combination of mushroom and asparagus melted like butter.\n\nFor side we ordered the baked mac and cheese. Top was crumbly and flavor was cheesy goodness. \n\nI think we put a lot of pressure on our experience because it's a Tyler Florence establishment, but overall I would definitely come back and try other courses. And for my wife, we'll make sure Tyler's in town next time we visit.", "author": "Chris L."}

As if I needed a reminder, Nia and Ben went Ray Lewis on our horrifying Wayfare experience tackling it with finesse and poise... then proceeded to do a victory dance giving the crowd every little bit of the show to go with the grunt work.  This is totally unlike the previous unresponsive and irresponsible team of management that originally got a 1 star review from me.   Nia and Ben's display of team work on this game changing tackle might even make it to the ESPN top ten plays of the day if we all put our votes in!\n\nNia reached out to me with the utmost sincere apology on behalf of Wayfare Tavern and our conversation went for a string of emails leading to Nia inviting us back for the real Wayfare experience... the way the experience should be.  I was skeptical... not of Nia but the food.  How can anyone blame me?  To really get anything less than 3 stars from me, you gotta be like Mark Sanchez, the BUTT of all jokes, and can't deliver even if I was wide open in the end zone just playing 'catch'.  Watch the Mark Sanchez blooper video if you don't already know.  Grab tissues.  You'll pull a JT for a good minute n 'Cry Me A River' from laughing too hard.  Yeah, well, that's what I was dealing with the very first time on the food end of things.\n\nQuick strong tackles aren't the only strengths this tag team has.  So for TGIF last night, Nia did some offensive coordinating and worked behind the scenes.  After looking through their time tested playbook, she got the play for the night set up for us... a play that fit extremely well with our extra Elite wide receiver 'Food Kid fAAt City' Ringo M.  Once we were all ready to go, Ben, the leader of the Wayfare team, got the snap and executed with perfection by handing off to one of the best players on their team to deliver a crushing touchdown on attentive friendly service.  Without any hesitation, they went above and beyond for the 2 point conversion.  The food this time was scrumptious... a major contrast to our last visit.\n\nWe started with the Roasted Early Girl Tomato soup served hot.  You can exercise read option here... you can go the hot or chilled route. After a review at the booth, we agreed this was our fave.  The sweetness of the charred strawberries went really well with the slight tang and sweetness of the zesty tomato soup.  A nice twist from the norm.\n\nI love a good octopus!  The octopus, although not on the top of my list of bests, was prepared very well... tender little bites with a nice hollandaise but texture is on the dry side compared to other methods of preparation like braising.  It was paired with some delicious lingui\u00e7a sausages which I thought was interesting.  I wasn't sure how those come together on this plate but I guess it makes sense if you are adding a smokey element to the dish along with sweetness of the cippolini onions.\n\nFootball? Chips? Dip? Goes hand in hand like QB to offense.  We had to get the Whole Roasted French Onion Dip topped with a generous amount of American Sturgeon caviar.  Loved how the dill gave the dip a subtle yet bright lift.  I wish the chips packed a better crunch with a thicker cut of potato.  Some of these guys couldn't hold their own on this play and were falling apart... into our dip.\n\nThe Seared Day Boat Scallops were lovelier than most the 49er cheerleaders I've seen... Sorry Ashley T. I didn't really mean you... but I'm sure your jaw will drop after I show you their gorgeous display of beautifully seared scallops, fresh spring peas and puree, papas bravas, pimento/paprika aioli, and sorrel. \n\nThe 2 point conversion for the win was complete with their signature Organic Fried Chicken topped with fried herbs of rosemary, sage, and couple others I couldn't make out.  The last time we went for this, it was a huge fumble (read original review).  This time, it was executed with mastery...fried to a delicate crisp with a juicy bite of moist chicken meat brined to savory perfection.  Got me singing some country with the Zac Brown Band and their famous 'Chicken Fried' single... 'You know I like my chicken fried... cold beer on a friday night... a pair of jeans that fit just right... and the radio oOooOoOooon! (country instrumentals)'.  To be honest, this fried chicken is a straight forward simple fried chicken... but a simple fried chicken done right is magic.\n\nWhat an incredible display of sportsmanship!!!  This team was unstoppable.  We all left here winners last night.  Hi fives, hugs, and jersey trades... kind of... it was more like hand shakes, business card trades, and a doggie bag.  Thank you Nia so very much for coordinating such an offensive on an amazing Friday night, and thank you Ben for following through with such open arms while we were there.  I never got the server's name but he and the runners delivered an unforgettable win for the books.  Please thank him for me.\n\nOh... by the way... those popovers though...", "author": "Colin M."}

It was nicely balanced and not too sweet; I could definitely taste the gin, but it didn't have the harsh boozy aftertaste. \n\nThe \"bread\" served here are these wonderful fresh popovers.

Though I saw some people say they were able to order a side of it, I was told that I could only add extra pieces to a full order (each additional piece was $5). A regular order is a half chicken cut into 5 pieces (the breast is cut in two). This fried chicken is great and is on par with ad hoc fried chicken. I'd say wayfare tavern's fried chicken is a little lighter. They stuff some fresh herbs under the skin before they fry it and serve it with it with some roasted herbs and spices on the side along with a wedge of lemon. While I wouldn't say the white meat was dry, the dark meat was definitely more juicy and enjoyable. I'd definitely come back again for this dish. \n\nI also tried a side of the sunchokes which were fine, but I probably wouldn't order them again.\n\nThe fresh donuts are amazing.

I often go out to nice places for both pleasure and business and always tip 20-25% because I have an industry background and will usually reward excellent service.   I even tip 20% when I have a bad experience somewhere. Tonight was one of those nights. \n\nFirst of all, I must complement the Wayfair Tavern for its interior design.  It is beautiful inside and the mezzanine landing is very nostalgic and rich.  We got there and they were willing to accommodate us for one hour because there was a reservation coming in around 615PM at the table where we sat.  I am very understanding of these dynamics and appreciate the accommodation. However, here are a couple of things that rubbed me the wrong way.  \n\n   One server took our initial order and it was noticeably handed off to a different server.  There did not seem to be any rhyme or reason as to why this happened because the initial server was still there when we left. This might be knit picky of me but the handoff seemed abrupt I am going based on the feel of the experience.  \n\nIn one hour at a 4-top booth I entertained my group of 4 and had a tab of $222 before tip (wine, a dozen oysters, then a bone marrow appetizer, etc).  Even though I was not that happy with the experience of the second server, I still tipped $45 which is right around 20%.  $267 out the door for one hour of wine and small plates. When I asked about desserts the response was that they needed to have the table clear in 15 minutes.  My critique would be, if this is a class establishment, please act the part.   I came out of the experience feeling as if the server was somewhat dismissive. \n\nI understand that this is a popular place, but for me to bring in a check of $267 on Monday from 5-6PM anywhere in the financial district should be appreciated.  I would hope an order like that would yield more respect in the future.  I came in feeling charmed by the decor and left the place knowing that I will take my business elsewhere in the future.  Also, the crust of the chocolate cream pie should be checked.  I could not slice through it.   I did not write this review to get a response from the restaurant and hope they respect my wishes to let this be.", "author": "nino l."}

The trick to going to Wayfare Tavern is to go when it's not busy, which is in the middle of the afternoon or a very late dinner or going for a private dining event (love their private room upstairs).  I'm not sure if it's the kitchen or servers, but things fray a bit when the place is busy.  Fortunately, everyone (at least in my experience) is nice and appropriately apologetic.  The food does continue to be good.  The fried chicken is famous for the reason -- it's outrageously good.  The deviled eggs are simple yet delicious.  The Poutine used to be my favorite, but last time I had it, instead of an au jus, they used gravy (not as good).  The burger at lunch is a great choice.  I recommend with the caveat of managing your dining expectations.", "author": "Donna G."}

This is because chicken is typically easy to make at home and I just do not believe I can be wowed with chicken.  Going off this premise, I refused to order the fried chicken at Wayfare Tavern.  Big mistake! Huge! Fortunately, my date has been here many times and was not so bull-headed.  He ordered the fried chicken and I proceeded to beg for bites.  Seriously, the best fried chicken I have ever tasted, mainly because Tyler Florence brines his chicken so it is juicy and salty and smartly does not overdo it on the breading.\n\nAlthough the poultry was the star of the show, there was a great supporting cast.  I had the Wayfare Burger, which will go down as one of the top three best burgers I have ever had.  Suprisingly, my first time having a burger with a fried egg and it was out of this world.   Started with steak tartare and some fresh, flavorful oysters.  My favorite part of the tartare was that the crustinis were actually pieces of the popovers you get as your bread, but crisped.  Very good.  Our meal was finished off with a homemade peach pie.  The pie was fantastic (if a little heavy on the flour for my taste), but I tapped out after one bite.  Service was great from start to finish.  Also had a really nice TF Cabernet Sauvignon with our meal that was reasonably priced.  So glad there is not a Tyler Florence Las Vegas location or I would be much poorer and much fatter!", "author": "Heather H."}

It was recommended by a coworker's wife and had to wait for quite a bit for a table. The place has 2 floors with not too many tables. The bar is OK but for some reason didn't have Guinness which is strange for a tavern.\n\nThe main reason for a 3 star is that when you're walking through the narrow and steep stairs down to the basement to reach the bathroom, and if you don't trip (which is very likely if you're inebriated). Your nostrils will be greeted with a pungent smell of urine. Perhaps it's there to guide you to the restroom, or perhaps people let themselves go waiting inline to the tiny restroom with 2 stalls only.\n\n Regardless, the food was great.

The eggs come in 6 halves. Topped generously with whipped yolk. Between two people it is a bit too much. But I didn't want to waste and ate 3. Smooth and silky. A bit of a smokyness and the pickled onions were great as well. \nWe also got the mushroom poutine which was tasty. Not quite the same as something you'll see in Montreal, but they fancied it up with vegetable gravy and mozzarella curds. It's all baked in a cast iron plate so the curds are all melted and you don't get that squeakyness of regular curds. \n\nYou also get popovers as table bread. The popovers are like Yorkshire pudding and they are awesome. I only ate half because there was so much other food.\n\nFor entrees, we got the scallops and the fried chicken. The scallops were seared beautifully. There were 3 scallops on the dish and very filling.\nA lot of people have talked about the fried chicken so I had to order it. It was good, but the breast was on the dry side. The batter wasn't really crispy/crunchy either. The taste was good, but I have had better fried chicken.\n\nAt this point I was already stuffed, but the dessert menu had some interesting items. My wife and I asked the server between the s'mores and the doughnuts and the server said the doughnuts. I'm glad we listened to him as they were probably some of the best doughnuts I've ever tasted. They are cooked fresh and hot. The doughnuts are pretty big. Two types of doughnuts and two doughnut holes. Comes with three dipping sauces. A bourbon sauce, apple tapenade and salted caramel. So good. \n\nAll your leftovers will be waiting at the front table. The wait staff will box it up and give you a ticket. When you leave, present the ticket to the front table and they'll hand you your leftovers. \n\nThey also have valet service for $12 as well if you want to use that.", "author": "Lan N."}

These dishes are far from simple, and after one bite it's easy to see why Wayfare Tavern isn't your typical American restaurant. \n\nThere are restaurants that have complicated menus yet lack in execution, but then there are restaurants like Wayfare Tavern that have simple menus yet exceed in execution. The quality in food and preparedness are apparent in every bite. High quality ingredients are the stars of every dish and you truly taste the savoriness, richness and decadence in something as unassuming as sprouts and deviled eggs.  \n\nTyler Florence has done the Bay Area a great favor by opening up a restaurant in SF.

My family and I dined here for dinner on New Year's Eve and had a great time. \n\nWe started with three appetizers: Kobe tartar, deviled eggs, and fried oysters. I don't eat beef, but considering how my parents' face lit up at first bite, it was probably delicious.  It came with a garlic popover and it was yummy. I absolutely LOVED the deviled eggs! The mustard flavor was bursting and the texture was silky.  It was a perfect bite. The fried oysters also came with fried cauliflower so my sister who is vegetarian got to have some of the dish. They came with a light and tangy tartar sauce. It was also good. \n\nOh, and the pop overs you get when dining here were amazing! My family never had them before so they were quite fascinated. \n\nFor entrees, we ordered fried chicken with a side of Mac and cheese, portabello mushroom sandwich, and polenta. My dad and I shared the chicken and he was impressed. My mom loved the sandwich. My sister loved the flavors of the polenta but didn't like how the veggies were chewy. We shared the mac and cheese and fries that came with the sandwich. \n\nFor dessert, we got the apple pie to share. The pie is about the size of a tart. It's probably supposed to be split between two people but my family and I share a dessert this size all the time. It came with rose ice cream that complimented the citrus favor. Texturally, it was diverse with the soft apple and crunchy streusel and crust. \n\nI brought a bottle of wine so we didn't try any drinks on their menu. \n\nService was top-notch as usual. Our waiter was friendly and not overbearing. He made sure we were doing well. \n\nI just love dining at the Wayfare Tavern.

It was an excellent fancy burger - each bite with the thick cut bacon, the juicy medium-cooked burger and the runny egg on top was delicious. It was also an excellent fried chicken dish for a fancy pants place. Usually at these places, you get a couple of chintzy pieces that are nothing to write home about. Instead, here we got 4 generous and juicy pieces that were nice and hot and crispy. Some of the best fancy fried chicken I've had so far, and I've had quite a bit of fancy fried chicken.\n\nWe also got the baked macaroni and cheese which was also delicious, and I'm not even the biggest fan of mac and cheese.\n\nTo end the meal, they gave us two complimentary cookies, which is always a huge plus.

Oysters were really really fresh, the kind where you feel like you can literally taste the ocean mmm mmm. Next we had the oxtail poutine. If you've never had poutine, this one from Wayfare will blow your brains. The oxtail was super tender - melt in your mouth good - accompanied with mozzarella cheese curds and a gravy with the perfect consistency (not too thick, not too thin, perfectly salted). Next we had the deviled eggs, perfectly mustardy  and creamy; decadent to say the least.  We finished off with the red beet hamachi crudo, which I believe changes seasonally. Super light and refreshing, served with avocado which is always a plus. \n\nFor entrees, a couple of us got the organic friend chicken, the wayfare burger, and the Maine lobster. All were super delicious. The organic fried chicken is a must; it's tender and crispy and perfectly seasoned. We got the wayfare burger cooked to a perfect medium rare with all its juices dripping out on a brioche bun. And as for the Maine lobster & lemon a la Tyler Florence...cmon how could you go wrong! \n\nAs for sides we got the baked mac n cheese & the roasted brussel sprouts and pancetta that they served at the time. Baked mac n cheese was perfectly crunchy from the topping, while still cheesy with hints of olive oil aka the perfect bite. And the roasted brussel sprouts were basically what started my sprout addiction a year ago. Pancetta and brussel sprouts combo makes a perfect pair. \n\nToo full to eat dessert, but other than that the service was great even on a busy Christmas eve afternoon.

I've had fried chicken in the south, as well as chicken from Thomas Keller's Addendum - Wayfare Tavern's version is just as good as these if not the best I've ever had.  You can quickly tell the chicken is brined and soaked in buttermilk due to the flavor and texture - but what I loved was the overall composition and the fact that it wasn't overly oily.  There wasn't one thing I can hone in on, but the chicken was flavorful without being overly seasoned, crisp, not too dense, and easy to cut with a knife and fork.  The broccolini was also some of the best I've ever had, crisp, yet tender, with a little salt/pepper and some heaping shavings of aged parmesan cheese on top.  The fact that this was 'just lunch' blew my mind.  \n\nI could wax poetic about the 'popovers' and the butter with black sea salt, but I'll save that for a more comprehensive review.

We started with a couple of tasty cocktails--their Barrel Aged Boulevardier and Cocoa Rum Old Fashioned.\n\nWanting to try a couple of appetizers, we went for the French Fried Oysters and American Kobe Tartare. The oysters had a light and delicate outer crunch that preserved the perfectly cooked oysters on the inside. A few of them were actually cauliflower florets, which was disappointing albeit still delicious. The garnish also featured cauliflower shavings to tie it all together.\n\nThe tartare was good. It was topped with a raw egg with garlic popovers on the side. I found the popovers to be highly enjoyable, except that they automatically serve you the same thing when you first sit down. We had garlic popoverload.\n\nWe decided to just go with one main dish and accompanied it with a couple of sides. I'm not a macaroni and cheese guy, but Jieun wanted to try it. We both agreed that it was forgettable. The Collard Pea Tendrils, on the other hand, were mouth watering. I like the upscale take on collard greens. Actually, I had never even heard of pea tendrils before. This side dish was a big win.\n\nFinally, we went with Tyler's Organic Fried Chicken as our main. I don't remember what lead to this decision. I guess it's their best-seller. For sure, the chicken had great flavor and the exterior had that same light and delicate crunch as the oysters. By this point, we were quite full and had our fill of fried items. We ended up taking a couple of chicken pieces to-go and they were remarkably even more delicious the next morning!\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal. The restaurant has an intimate, yet energetic vibe.

It was the fried chicken. We were also fortunate to come when they were serving scallops. My wife had the steak tar tar and I ordered the scallops. Both were perfect.\n\nFor the main course, my wife chose the chilled full lobster and I ordered the Fried Chicken since that was what I saw going out the most. Service was great, atmosphere was like a hunter's lodge and the comfort food like the side of mac and cheese and the muffins were just beautiful. \n\nWe actually ate all day in San Francisco. I would say for foodies, San Francisco is a food paradise. But Wayfare Tavern was at the top of all the restaurants we had the pleasure of dining at.", "author": "Matt R."}

Ordered the fried chicken (voted the best in America, the menu tells us). It was really bland. It wasn't terrible, just not worth $26 and miles from the best in the US. I think Foreign Cinema does a much tastier fried chicken, in fact.\n\nThe dinner salad was eh. I expected something really delicious for the money. Underdressed romaine with some berries, mustard seeds, and a few stingy pieces of avocado.

The absolute worst steak tartare I have ever eaten, I ate about a third but stopped because nausea. What's the color you think of when you hear the word tartare! Red! This tartare was pink because the meat had thoroughly been stirred with mayonnaise. Please.  Do you think Genghis Khan was a mayonnaise aficionado? I think not.", "author": "Adam S."}

So when I heard of Wayfare Tavern as a possible venue for my wedding, I based it off of the location, decor, friendliness of the staff, and price. Everything was booked and was a breeze, but leading up towards the big day I started to get nervous about things being perfect, and everything absolutely WAS.\n\nWe rented the Bartlett room for my party of 50. It was a wedding we planned in 2.5 months and Wayfare made it super easy. No deposit required (just cc #), private bathroom, a/v system included, optional bar, valet... I could go on forever. Even when my set up party came with decorations, the staff was super helpful in making everything look the way I wanted. They played jazz music all night and everything was on time.\n\nNow for the food, it was all amazing! We had the Organic Fried Chicken (which was a recommendation I received from 3 different people), the Le Grand burger, and the Charred Corn Agnolotti. Every single person at our party came up to us to tell us how delicious the food was. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. \n\nI couldn't have asked for a better night, and I will definitely be returning for all anniversaries.", "author": "Wendy D."}

No food, just cocktails or a glass of wine, an event here (sans eats), a cocktail party there, and before you know it, I realized that I'd never had a morsel to eat.\n\nHow did that happen? \n\nTo remedy this atrocity, last night, after ordering a drink on the first floor (and after eyeing a juicy burger at the bar), we were seated on the second floor and proceeded to order food.\n\n+Some raw oysters: the Beausoleil were tastier than the Kusshi oysters. Sounds so snooty, but it's true.\n\n+Seared octopus with scallion, linguica, hollandaise, and cippolini onion. A great dish that had some well-cooked and well-seasoned octopus.\n\n+The Wayfare Burger \"le grand,\" with Marin brie, roasted onion, smoked bacon and a sunny side up egg on a br\u00eeoche. Since we split the burger, each half had a sunny side up egg that had a perfectly runny yolk that dribbled down my fingers with each bite. The burger was magical. The fries were addicting, too; perfectly crunchy and salty.

See above for my thoughts on said pork chop.  Truffle fries were ok, not the best I've had but pretty good.  I'm not about to complain since the best truffle fries ever are located in SD, and teleporters don't exist yet.  Dat chocolate pie though...now that was something.  But was it really necessary to have the whipped cream stacked up so high?\n\nThe good thing for me is that I still have something to look forward to, because apparently the fried chicken is amazing.

I was so looking forward to try this restaurant as I loved watching Tyler Florence on the food network. \n\nOur lunch actually started out fine. We made reservations for a party of 3 at 11:30am. We arrived a little late but it wasn't an issue..they seated us promptly. For apps, we started off with raw oysters, kobe beef tartare and the mac n cheese. Mac n cheese was quite good; very creamy but not overly rich or salty. The kobe beef tartare looked very fresh and looked good but it was actually not that flavorful and did not wow me. Also didn't think it went well with the garlic popovers. The raw oysters (Beausoleil & Blue Point) however were YUMMY! Super fresh and sweet.  \n\nFor the entrees, I went with the Wayfare Burger w/ a sunny side egg and the others ordered the hand cut fettucine and the grilled hanger steak. The fettuccine came out first...I took a small bite of it and literally wanted to spit it right back out. It was so freakin SALTY to a point where it's seriously not even edible. We notified our server and he took it back to the kitchen right away.  \n\nNext my burger arrives. Of course it looked great with a perfectly cooked sunny side egg accompanied with a side of crispy fries. I was so getting ready to dig into my juicy burger until I realized and thought to myself \"wait a minute...where is the bun!?\"  Yup! They freakin forgot to serve the bun with my burger!!  I looked all over and only found a bunch of butter lettuce around it and some pickles. For a second I actually thought maybe that's how they do their burgers.  LOL  I notified our server and again he took it back to the kitchen right away. But this time he looked a little mortified himself.  I don't blame him-he should be embarrased. Seriously how can one mess up that bad right?   \n\nThe hanger steak arrives and guess what....we sent that back too!  It was way too salty.  Our server was very apologetic and accommodating but what a NIGHTMARE. By the time we got our new entrees (and guess what, this time they forgot the sunny side egg for my burger!!) it was well over 1.5 hours and time for us to head back to work.  We didnt get to enjoy ANY of our entrees and just requested for them to box up our food.  *SIGH*  what a waste of time and food.  Obviously not my day today.", "author": "Cathy M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-06", "description": "For my 400th review, I am giving this honor to the great and wonderful Wayfare Tavern.  I have had the great fortune to have dined at this delectable treasure at least 4 times with lovely friends in the past year.  A few times were with just a few others and one time I actually held a special event in the Bartlett Room.\n\nI'd like to say that every aspect of this place is exceptional, and I've always been quite satisfied from the experience.  While it isn't a place that I would go on a daily or even weekly basis (that is gluttony!), I would definitely come here often enough if I could.  The service and atmosphere is classic American, clean, attentive, and laid back.  You instantly feel welcome and at ease when you enter this bustling place.  I love the decor and the open kitchen.\n\nAll the raves about the deviled eggs are well-deserved. Best deviled eggs I've ever had.  Tyler, you are a genius!!!  They are slightly different every time but always tasty.  I will always get this as an appetizer.  The steak tartare per Wakako U's recommendation is \na must try.  Popovers are always an excellent treat.\n\nFried chicken is also very good, very flavorful, but I think Maverick's was better (so sad they're gone!).  I think it could be a little bit more moist, but the rosemary and salt are spot on to this rustic and simple presentation.  The poutine is delectable and indulgent, the salads are always fresh and the right portion, and all of their cocktails are classic and delightful.  The burger is AMAZING and really hits the spot.  All my friends love the mac and cheese and the desserts are always the best finisher.  If they have pie, GET THE PIE.\n\nFor my private event last October, I worked with Sarah who was so so wonderful!  I reserved the Bartlett Room for a birthday and work anniversary celebration with about 30 of my closest friends and colleagues.  I had a private bar set up, a lovely gentleman friend of mine brought amazing champagne, and ordered a 4 course meal with 4 different appetizers served pre-dinner.  Everything was delicious and the portions were so generous!  We had a ton of leftover food to take home and everyone said they were the most decadent leftovers ever.\n\nThe Bartlett Room was spectacular!  A long table was set with a view of the wine cellar through glass, warm lighting, and an old B roll film of old San Francisco in black and white played on the flatscreen.  The ambiance was perfect and classy, perhaps even romantic.   The staff at Wayfare made everyone feel attended to and comfortable. One of my friends was a vegetarian and Wayfare prepared a special meal for her which she said was amazing. Everyone told me they had a great time.  I wish I could celebrate here every year.  It was so easy to work with Sarah and I felt like I didn't really have to do anything.  She really helped work with my budget and gave great suggestions to my choices.  They even printed special menus for my day.  I highly recommend this restaurant for small events.\n\nWayfare is also set in a very convenient and easy to find location in the Financial District.  Those coming from the Peninsula can take Bart from Millbrae and those from the East Bay can take a ferry over.\n\nSuch a lovely place, I can't say enough about it.  I only wish someday to meet Tyler Florence!  Hopefully the next time I make it over...", "author": "Ruth C."}

To my surprised, the head pastry chef came out. My oh my, he was a HOTTIE!!! Greeting me with his pearly white welcomed smile. As he explained what was in it and such, I got side tracked.

This place has been on my list for forever and by forever I mean a good couple of months. \n\nCame here for a lunch date. No reservations around 2:00 and sat at the bar by the kitchen and got to watch everyone cook. A cook and I smiled at each other even though he was in the way corner half blocked by all the other cooks. I swear the word cook looks like the word cock to me right now. Anyways, he was nice. \n\nI got the tuna carpaccio and my date got some type of sandwich I'm too lazy to look up right now. It was huge though and was very messy to eat and everything fell out as he was eating. It was pretty funny. My carpaccio was awesome. I've never seen such a big portion of it before but I guess this was the first time I had it as an entree and not as an appetizer. \n\nTwo of the items on the menu that looked awesome had already been sold out. WTF. I hate when that happens. Makes me feel like I'm back in Shanghai when the first three things I go to order are all out EVERY TIME. \n\nThe deviled eggs coming out of the kitchen looked amazingggggg but I didn't see them until it was too late =( The popovers before the meal were nothing special. I've made better ones myself but my date couldn't get enough of it. \n\nMy date wanted the red velvet cake for dessert. I hate red velvet cake. Yeah, you read that right. I hate red velvet but their red velvet cake was the best I've ever had. The waiter also talked us into getting it since it had beet chips and I told him I hated beets. The beet chips were also good. What is Wayfare doing? They're making me question all the food I dislike. I thought the cake was kind of tiny for $10 but it ended up being enough to even share. Tyler Florence can do no wrong.  \n\nThe decor was awesome. The service was nice. I really liked our waiter. He was tall with glasses and had red hair. I may have made the last two parts up because I really can not remember faces for the life of me.

The vibe here is warm, even though this is definitely more upscale dining, it did not feel pretentious.  I absolutely love the decor, minus the deer heads...but that's just my taste.  The color scheme is nice and sort of classic country.\nThis is definitely a place of indulgences and plan to spend a pretty penny here.  Average entree is $25.  The cocktails are $12, I ordered a negroni, not on the menu and it was really good!\n\nFor the food, we ordered the mac 'n' cheese, butter leaf salad which they split in two, and I ordered the crab dish (signature dish) and my friend the fried chicken which was a substantial portion and looked awesome...and this is coming from a vegetarian!  We also ordered the homemade doughnuts which were perfection. (see picture)  Everything was wonderfully seasoned and delicious.  I did like the crab dish, but I think next time I would order something different.  The crab taste was a bit overbearing for me at first but I am new to fish so I am still acquiring the taste.

It comes with no sides or greens, so I ordered a side dish of broccoli, which I also recommend. It is topped with slices of parm. You won't be disappointed, unless you expect a light check at the end of the meal. Unless you can eat most of a whole chicken, I suggest splitting the chicken dish with your dining mate.

The dinner menu is what everyone is here for except for the occasional Easter brunch which attracted my eyes and stomach based on their Biscuits and Gravy.  Unfortunately I was severely let down but that particular dish.  The gravy was a bit cold and coagulated while I was also surprised by 2 eggs dished in-between my biscuits.  Not usually a bad thing, but unexpected having not seen that tid-bit listed on the menu as a choice. \"Country ham biscuits (Amazing but cold), Garlic Sausage (Where?...maybe in the cold gravy), eggs (no choice on how prepared - my fault for not asking), bourbon gravy(I wish I would've been drunk for it)\".\n\nThe other food was great.  The Easter Quiche Lorraine was good, and at least served hot!  The real stars of the show were on the actual dinner menu.  Asparagus with lemon and garlic, french fries cooked to perfection and the breaded-delights served pre-meal with salted butter.  YUM!  I'm sure I will go back to Wayfare Tavern for a dinner meal sometime in the future as the decor stands out above the food by far.

You box up my food to go, put it in a bag, but have ZERO plastic utensils for me?  I mean, it's a \"to go\" order, right?  Just the food in there with no utensils or napkins or anything.  When I ask, I'm told I can go across the street to the burger joint and ask for some there.  Tacky.  That's not the response a 4 or 5 star restaurant that charges these prices should be giving.  She didn't say it in a mean or disrespectful way, that's not what I mean....she meant as helpul.  What I'm saying is that response should NEVER Be uttered from an upscale restaurant that charges these prices, regardless.\n\nAgain.....if you call yourself a \"tavern\", you probably maybe kinda sorta perhaps MIGHT want to have at least one beer on tap.  Just a wild thought.  And the utensils thing?  Either don't offer food to go based on policy you create and stick with, that's fine.  But if you DO offer it to go, for the love of God don't half ass it and throw the people's food in the bag with no utensils or napkins and then basically shrug your shoulders when asked about it.

A ritual when I come out to the Bay (From AZ) is that my cousins and I (7 or 8 of us) meet for cocktails and dinner here. It is a fantastic restaurant and when Tyler Florence is around, you can feel it.\n\nMy guy took me to dinner for a quick weekend in the Bay for a surprise Bday gift. He has never been here before but thought it was delicious but not phenomenal. I am just biased. Our waiter was attentive and thoughtful, I appreciated his insight on the sauv blanc he chose, named Pushback. It was very tasty.\n\nTo start: we tried the deviled eggs and tartare. We were torn on who liked what more, my favorite are the eggs, so decadent and beautiful on the egg separator plate. BF likes the tartare that they mixed in with the egg right on your table. Those popovers are killer with the salty butter. \n\nI had the special, seared duck breast with a butternut squash puree. It was cooked medium and the sauce was the perfect creamy accompaniment. He has the fried chicken with no sides, just wanted to enjoy the chicken. He said it was nice how it wasn't overly greasy or oily but because it felt so flash fried it wasn't extraordinarily crispy. There were 5 pieces and he are them all so I know it wasn't too bad. \n\nWe could not even imagine getting dessert. Our wine glasses and water glasses were always fun and there was nice couple from Sacramento who was there for the first time and we chatted with them for a while. It was nice, fun Saturday night and I know we will go again soon. I highly recommend Wayfare Tavern. It just all fits and works, great style and ambiance, great services and knowledge of the staff, excellent dishes...what more can you want from a San Fran restaurant?", "author": "Michelle N."}

The drinks they offer on the menu are very classy and refreshing, with the exception of the Briar Punch, which tasted like Windex. By comparison, the Urban Garden, the Dandelion Wine, and the Sazerac were much more well liked by all.\n\nUnfortunately, my friends and I weren't extremely hungry by the time we got to the restaurant, so we ended up splitting a meal.  We ordered the Braised Pork Shoulder. It came with a side of an \"American picnic\", which was a delicious helping of potato salad (usually I'm not a fan, but Tyler did me right on this), corn bread, and baked beans. All the things you would have on the side at a BBQ. The pork shoulder was a little dry though, but I give Mr. Florence some extra points for creativity. We also ordered the mac and cheese, yummy but filling, and the curry squash and zucchini, another great creative genius of the chef. It was definitely more than enough food for two people.\n\nMy friends ordered the Yellowtail Crudo and the fig and melon salad. I didn't try either, but they were both very fresh and colorful. I would imagine if your a fan of Yellowtail sashimi, you probably would enjoy the crudo. They also had the Strawberry Rhubarb tart, but I was waaay to full to even think about dessert. I think they liked it though. \n\nEven though we weren't hungry, we did put quite a dent in both our food and our wallets. I would recommend Wayfare Tavern for a fancy couples dinner, like we had.

I knew I'd like it the moment I walked in. The bartender, Joy, is an absolute delight and very professional. Bartending is a lost art. These days it's more important to flip the drink around 17 times rather than get to know your customer and make a tasty cocktail. It's refreshing to sit at a bar tended by an engaging person with class and substance. Now I know I'm a simple small town mountain boy and this might be the norm around here but it was a breath of fresh air. But I digress. I started with the baked mac n cheese because I'm still a kid at heart! Great taste and texture. I followed that with their tavern burger and what the hell let's throw an over easy egg on the beast while we're at it. 10/10 recommend it! The ingredients are top notch. Not to mention the gooey melty bri which is a personal favorite. I will be back next time I'm in SF.", "author": "Antonio V."}

From the hostess' phone etiquette, to our pleasant server, Aaron, to the other staff who constantly made sure we had a clean table and water filled glasses. I truly appreciate stellar service and was a wonderful experience dining here!\n\nWe started with the deviled eggs (a bit too much mustard for my liking, but the other flavors were on point!). My boyfriend ordered coffee and said the french roast was perfection! After the fresh popovers, I wasn't that hungry so I just had the side order of mac n cheese and my boyfriend got the tri tip sandwich. The serving sizes were great and we loved our food (I actually barely ate the mac n cheese, but brought it to go, and it actually tasted even better being warmed up!).\n\nI loved the building, decor and ambiance. It was a perfect way to start our Sunday!\n\nParking: some of the reviews said there's valet, when we arrived, there was zero street parking and no valet to be found (perhaps it's an evening service).

How can this chicken get so much hype when it's not even that good!!!! The flavor was bland, colorless, we both agreed that KFC or Popeye's tasted much better than this $20 chicken.  I guess the coating on the chicken wasn't done well because the texture was slimy as we cut into it.  My burger was good but I think I've had better burger than this place. \n\nAnother gripe was the services.  Granted we only had a party of five, but we spent a lot of money that night and our server was snobby and kept trying to kick us out.  He made several attempts giving us the check but we kept ordering more wine bottles instead! \n\nThis place is fine if you're going as a group outing or company dinner, where you don't need to drop a dime, otherwise, I would be pissed!

I really wanted to like this place, enough to give it a five, even.  I came into it really thinking I would enjoy it as much as anything I've eaten recently.  Service was great; food was good but I felt there were a few miscues that I would expect to avoid at a place like this.\n\nAs noted above, no complaints at all about the service.  Everyone tending to us was friendly and attentive enough without being overbearing.  Complimentary popovers were brought out quickly, though it seemed that everyone else got butter except us (we only noticed after we ate them and were looking around at other tables).  The food also came out pretty quickly.\n\nThe food is where I (and my gf) felt like there were a few things that were just a bit off.  We ordered an appetizer of burrata with nettle pesto, farro and crostini.  Everything was great except the crostini - it had sort of a non-pleasant chewiness to it, almost as if it were day old bread or something.  I'm not saying it was, but that is the kind of texture it had.\n\nFor our entrees, I had the burger, which was topped with brie, bacon, grilled red onion, optional fried egg, and the usual greenery, and fries, while my gf had the fried chicken and mac and cheese as a side.\n\nMy burger was a HOT MESS...a fantastically delicious hot mess, absolutely.  But just note that it will be quite messy...even with the cloth napkins, could be a two-napkiner for sure.  Cooked to order perfectly (mid-rare).  Super juicy, aggressively but not overly salted...pure luxury.  And HUGE - I could not get my mouth around the entire thing.  Fries accompanying were skinny fries, which I like.  These were pretty good though slightly oversalted.\n\nThe gf seemed pretty happy with her fried chicken if that's any indication.  For my part, I only had one bite that was good enough...no complaints.  BTW - I don't know if the menu notes this, but much like my burger, the portion is quite large.  My gf only ate half of it.  I imagine two not-monstrously-hungry people could share the chicken.  The mac and cheese was very good - topped with toasted bread crumbs and chives for color.  Gooey, cheesy, creamy, fatty deliciousness.\n\nThis was a generous four-star review, again because I can't give 3.5 stars.  I do like this place and would be happy to return in the future.  I reserve the right to update my review downward, but don't expect to.  I'm hoping the missteps experienced were the exception and not the rule.  It's definitely worth a try if you're in the city and want good, solid comfort food.", "author": "Brent T."}

The popovers they bring out were just delicious, so light and airy! We each got the fried chicken, because, clearly. We also got the deviled eggs, came with 4, they were very good but not spectacular, so I'm not sure if I'd order them next time though. We shared the mac and cheese and an order of the whipped mashed potatoes. It was plenty for three of us. And finally, the chicken was amazing. It came with roasted garlic cloves, which I ate with the mashed potatoes. A squeeze of the lemon on the chicken and it was perfect.

The vibe of the restaurant is reminiscent of London and has a swanky, classy feel. Our server was extremely friendly and helped suggest/explain different drinks. The bar is top notch and the drinks were great. They start you off with complimentary popovers and butter, which are really light and delicious. \n\nWe ordered all types of things, and no one was unhappy with their meal. Fried chicken wasn't the best I ever had, but very good for an upscale restaurant- big portion too! Not too greasy, and a light but flavorful batter. Grilled brocoloni with pine nuts is a superb side and probably the best broccoli I've ever had. The pea tendrils are really delicious with the pork flavor, and our server suggested a fried egg on top- follow that recommendation because it was damn good. The filet is a good size and the other couple we were with both loved it. Fries and mashed potatoes were solid.\n\nDesert was just as good as the rest of the meal. Fresh donuts with three dipping sauces (they had coconut last night and it was SOOO good). The blueberry tart is great as well.\n\nOverall, a great meal and a great experience.

We started off with oysters and deviled eggs - oysters were very clean and delicious (I've had the same varietal elsewhere but these were extra fresh and yummy), and the deviled eggs were simple and fell a little flat. My dining companion got the fried chicken, which I tried, and it was very good. I wanted to eat all of it but alas, it was his, and I was looking for something a little lighter. I got the pork shank, which was recommended by the waitress over the salmon, and it was hearty and earthy, but not super flavorful.

Luckily it was one of those rare pleasant nights in SF when taking the open outdoor table (and avoiding the 45 minute wait) was an option. The waitstaff were all extremely pleasant and never let our water glasses, cocktails, or stomachs become empty.  We both started with martinis (watch out for the un-pitted olives-whoops!).  \n\nFood :) \n\nWe split the Butter Lettuce Salad with Avocado, Grapefruit and Ricotta Salata.  There were generous portions split on either of our plates (nice touch!) and the salad was PERFECTLY dressed.  No soggy lettuce and drowning toppings, thank goodness! It would have been nice with some freshly ground pepper, but the salad was a great starter regardless. \n\nWe also got 4 oysters (2 Blue Point and 2 Beausoleil), which were recommended based on our preference for briney oysters by the waitress.  At this point the bread and butter (POPOVERS!!!!!) came out and I had to literally fight my BF for the wonderful flaky bread.  Thank goodness more came with our beef tartare, which was an awesome switch from the classic crostini and made the dish seem even more decadent.  We rounded out the meal with the grilled octupus, which was executed very well (perfectly charred and tender-no rubby tentacles here). \n\nAll in all, a very relaxing and satisfying dining experience.

We made our food decisions in a flash and were grateful that our apps were delivered right away.\n\nThe salt roasted bone marrow with rutabaga jam was the FATTIEST bone marrow I've had in SF so far! It was a joy spreading it on the thick toast and topping it with pickled onion and parsley. The mozzarella burrata with fig and eggplant caponata was just ok and a small serving for the price you pay. For really mind blowing burrata imported from Italy, Vicoletto in North Beach is your best bet.\n\nI must've been talking too much because I wasn't done with my appetizer when our entrees came. I shoved the last piece of bone-marrow-toast in my mouth just as the fried chicken entree was placed in front of me. Brined in buttermilk and lightly breaded, this is very good fried chicken. Succulent meat and well seasoned too. But if you're looking for that crispy, hearty crunch of fried chicken skin, this isn't it. I did love the rustic presentation with the fried herbs and slices of lemon.\n\nThe mac n cheese didn't do anything for me but then again, I'm not really a big fan. (my brother is) The skinny fries were perfectly crisp and well salted. \n\nTyler Florence does American cuisine and comfort food right.

Got there and there were a couple things I had to try, the Burger and the Burrata Mashed Potatoes.  The Burrata mashed potatoes, were extremely overpriced for the quality ($9) and overall lacking in flavor.  I love burrata cheese and felt either there wasn't enough of it or the potatoes watered down the delicate flavor of the burrata.  The burger was also underwhelming, at best.  The toppings were not great, yet still overwhelmed the taste of the meat.  All I got was the sweetness from the onion jam, it covered up the very thin slices of bacon and the cheddar.  Also, I ordered the egg and didn't end up getting it - with no attempt made to make that oversight right either.\n\nThe things I wanted to try left me disappointed and $40 poorer.  The good parts of the experience were the pop-overs (amazing with the salted butter) and the freshly made pickles that came with the burger. \n\nWouldn't go back here, and I say avoid it too if you are visiting the area here in the FiDi - so many other options to choose from and it appears this restaurant is getting by on the name of the celebrity chef, and not the taste or quality of food.", "author": "Dustin C."}

Reservations almost required because it's always packed. \n\nShort review: Bread is amazing, Poutine is SO amazing, and cocktails and well done. Entrees are 3.5 out of 5 overall. \n\nHere's the breakdown of the Appetizers/drinks:\n\n-First of all. Bread. The soft, aery, popover bread they give you before the meal. This is amazing so try not to get too full off of it. \n\n-Oxtail Poutine: BEST thing from Wayfare Tavern. Absolutely delicious and a must try for anyone craving poutine, for anyone who likes cheese, or just anyone in general.\n\n-American Kobe Tartare: Very good and served with garlic popovers. I actually prefer it without the bread. \n\n-Gin Spiced Mule: I'm a fan. Made with hendricks, lime, cucumber & ginger beer. If you are a gin gal who likes refreshing drinks like mojitos and gin and tonics, you will definitely enjoy this one. I was impressed. \n\n-Mac & Cheese: meh\n\n-Avocado salad: Not much of a salad. more like dressed sliced avocados. Not bad but don't expect it on a bed of greens. \n\nNow Entrees:\n\nEntrees overall fell short for me. I was expecting a lot but it did not deliver.\n\n-Wayfare Burger \"Le Grand\": I've tried many of these gourmet $20 burgers (including the famous $20 famous minetta tavern in NYC). Maybe it's not my thing. Maybe there is a cut off point where burgers cannot get any better no matter how much dry aging or farm-egging you do. The burger at Wayfare's is served on a brioche bun with brie cheese. It's way too rich. I was aching for some sharp cheddar on that thing to balance it out. I give it a 3.5 out of 5.\n\n-Organic Fried Chicken: another let down. It's pretty tasty but not something crazy revolutionary. Definitely had better. \n\n-Whole Maine Lobster : NOT a thing to get here. It's comes chilled and without all the smaller parts. Just doesn't seem like it's worth it for $35.", "author": "Julie K."}

The patty was ok, but the sauce lacked flavor and the brioche bun was very dry almost crumbling --- I ended up eating the patty with my fork. The frites were better.\n\nThere are many places in SF where to get an awesome gourmet burger, and some more where to grab great fried chicken (and waffles if you dig that) just to arrive at Wayfair Tavern to find average representations at best but at a much much higher premium.\n\nService was average too (we had to wait for a large order to clear before getting our food).\n\nI think Tyler is an amazing chef on tv, but I am now convinced quality control at his restaurants is lacking. \n\nAll hype.", "author": "Juan G."}

For years it was a beautiful, creamy, delicious pie with a wonderful crust, creamy chocolate and whipped cream.  It used to be the highlight of my meal.  Now, they have \"deconstructed\" this dessert into what can best be described as a \"chocolate dessert served in a terrarium\".  Don't serve a gooey mess served in a glass bowl a \"pie\".\n\nSecondly, I had another one of my favorites, the Tavern Burger and it was served on a plank!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-01-20", "description": "REAL RATING: 3.5 stars (rounding down to 3)\n\nMan oh man. I was really looking forward to having dinner at Wayfare Tavern (WT) but a few things didn't meet my expectations and, well, I wasn't that impressed. \n\nATMOSPHERE: WT has a very cozy feeling to it. With dim lighting and rustic Italian decor, it makes you feel right at home. Even though it gets a bit loud, you can still have a conversation with the people at your table without having to shout. \n\nSERVICE: Great. Top notch. No complaints. \n\nFANNY BAY OYSTERS ~ 4 stars ~ $3.00 each: Fresh and briny. It had a good pop to them. The oysters are served with cocktail sauce, melted garlic butter, lemons and hot sauce. I usually like smaller oysters because they tend to be a little sweeter but these Fanny Bays did the job. I recommend these. \n\nKUSSHI OYSTERS ~ 4 stars ~ $3.75 each: A bit smaller than the Fanny Bays but a little brinier. These were also awesome. Sandy liked these more, while I favored the Fanny Bays. Either way, they were both delicious. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qihSJUsWA_CT3ZaxPEF8uQ&userid=CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A\n\nWAYFARE CAESAR SALAD ~ 3 stars ~ $12.00: Served with whole anchovies, a soft boiled egg and a cheese puff, this salad looked amazing. However, it falls shorts compared to other Caesar Salads I've had. I'm not a fan of whole anchovies even though I know it's a key ingredient in this dressing. If it's pulsated down and integrated into the dressing, I'm down with that. Let me just put it like this - the soft boiled egg was the best thing on my plate. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=YuNb3lV07_c9d5lvrBObMg&userid=CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A\n\nAMERICAN KOBE TARTARE ~ 3 stars ~ $16.00: I always laugh when I see the words \"American\" and \"Kobe\" together. Let's be serious, that doesn't exist. But whenever I see the word \"Tartare\" I tend to get excited. Sandy and I were looking forward to this but when our waiter set it down on our table, I couldn't help but notice the weird color of the beef. It was very pink. Most likely because of what it was dressed in but I'm used to seeing a more red tartare. The best thing about this plate was the buttery bread it was served with. However, I'm not really dogging on the flavor of the beef. It just wasn't the best I've ever had. Not even close. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=8XnCOSBCkIFX_0fbSGIrYw&userid=CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A\n\nCHARRED CORN AND FARMER'S CHEESE AGNOLOTTI ~ 2 stars ~ $20.00: If you're paying $20 for a plate of pasta, it better be amazing. However, this dish was pretty downright terrible. Agnolotti is a pasta very similar to ravioli. They're pretty much little Italian dumplings. The problem with WT's agnolotti is that the filling was absolutely horrendous. When it popped in your mouth, the filling was very unpleasant. The flavor was off and very grainy. Another thing about this plate is how small the serving is. Sandy doesn't eat much and she still didn't finish her plate. I don't blame her. The pasta was pretty bad. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=qy6ABkEYNndcppKRBHMFKA&userid=CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A\n\nORGANIC FRIED CHICKEN ~ 4.5 stars ~ $24.00: No joke, WT's fried chicken is one of the best renditions of the American classic I've ever had. Amazing flavor combined with awesome crunch plus a moist center - HEAVEN! You can really taste the rosemary in the seasoning. The kicker was splashing lemon over it. I've never had fried chicken with lemon but it worked REALLY well at Wayfare. I can't tell you how much I loved this dish. Not only was it delicious, but the portion was very big too. I HIGHLY recommend this. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=8hDrEW8y2eNA0PG8bjiIiA&userid=CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A\n\nThe real reason I wasn't very pleased with Wayfare was the pricing. I'm not saying it's expensive, what I'm saying is that the food isn't worth the price tag. Between the food, three glasses of wine and a cocktail, my bill came out to $188.30 pre-tip. Our meal was not worth a little over $90/person. Not even remotely close. I'm always down to pay whatever for awesome food so money isn't the issue (It never should be with good food. It's the only thing I splurge on.). But you gotta get your money's worth no matter how you spend it. So in short, I feel like Tyler (Florence) ripped me off. He's lucky I had GREAT company with me. Sandy is a lot like bacon - she makes everything better.", "author": "Bruce C."}

Instead of the usual toast, they used pop overs.  The pop over was cut into few pieces but they were too dry and flanky.  Not only the pieces were inconvenint to spread the tartare on, the kitchen put way too much black pepper on the dish that the spicyness completely ruined and overpowered the natural beef flavor.\n\nThe french fried oysters and buttermilk fried chicken were good.  Both fried just right and chicken was moist and tender.  Almost every other table ordered the fried chicken.\n\nIt took me 3 years to return just because I was craving for steak tartare but I left disappointed and unsatisfied.

It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside- the skin was perfect- not too tough. My entree also came with cooked garlic - which I ate first :) \n\nMost of my colleagues ordered the fried chicken, too, but a few ordered different entrees: the salmon (delicious) and the burger (wow- very good). I highly recommend the fried chicken, though- it was a treat!\n\nWe also got sides: Mac and cheese (cheesy yumminess), broccolini (firm & healthy), and French fried potatoes (tasty)! \n\nThen, we shared the homemade doughnuts- presentation was awesome- the doughnuts were warm & fluffy- it came with 3 dipping creams (caramel, custard & pear butter)- it was heavenly!

The breading was really delicious.  My husband very much enjoyed his burger (a whopping $20) too.   Their famous popovers are decent, but a little on the hard side.  My husband enjoyed it more than me and was annoyed we weren't offered seconds like the table next to us.  They also brought out some burrata whipped potatoes, which we didn't order, and when we told them we hadn't ordered those they gave them to us on the house, which was very nice.  I didn't think much of the potatoes though, which is strange since I love both burrata and mashed potatoes.  But they had a weird, kind of stringy texture and not much flavor.  I think it's definitely a little overpriced, especially the burger.  The entrees are more reasonable, but it's annoying that the fried chicken doesn't come with any sides - if you want them you have to order them a la carte for $9 like at a steakhouse.

After weeks and weeks of searching for the perfect mix of charm, food, and ambiance, we decided to book Wayfare Tavern's \"Bartlett Room\" for our intimate wedding dinner reception on April 8th, 2016. Let me tell you - they did NOT disappoint! Our wedding guest count was 24 (26 including us) which allowed us to focus more on the quality of food instead of quantity. I was also interested in finding a space that did not need a lot of \"dressing up\" and had enough character to carry on it's own. From the very beginning, we fell in love with the ambiance at Wayfare Tavern with it's mix of dark wood, dim candles, and effortless whimsy. On top of this, working with Jasmin was a treat! She was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating which helped put us at ease. \n\nThe day of our Wedding Reception Dinner was perfect. Upon arrival, everything was already in place and the servers were ready to take first drink orders and pass the canapes. Jasmin was even there to make sure the event went off exactly as imagined but her service team is a well-oiled machine. There was never a time where pacing felt off or guests were looking around to get another drink. They even worked with me when I requested to push the pacing back a little to allow more time between courses. On top of this, they packed up a special care package of food to bring to my grandfather who was unable to make the dinner that evening so he could still enjoy the fare. \n\nOur meal was served family style and included: \nCANAPES\nCheesy Potato Croquette (guests are STILL raving about these!)\nPasilla Pepper \"Cannoli\"\nSTARTERS\nFresh Burrata (try this with their fresh bread - I could've eaten the whole tray!)\nButter Lettuce Salad \nENTREES\nOrganic Fried Chicken\nPetite Tender Roast\nSea Bass\nSIDES\nBaked Mac & Cheese\nBurrata Whipped Potatoes\n\nI'm not typically a red meat fan but holy cow the tender roast was epic! You could cut it with a fork it was so tender. The Fried Chicken was, of course, the fan favorite for the table for the entrees but the runaway hit was the Cheesy Potato Croquettes and the Burrata. Everyone liked that we served family style as it gave them the opportunity to try different proteins and not have to stick with just one. Our guests said multiple times that this was the best food they have ever had at a wedding! \n\nMy husband and I have been over the moon with the service, hospitality, and quality at Wayfare Tavern. We would not change one thing about our Wedding Reception Dinner and believe it was the perfect venue for our small, out-of-the-norm wedding celebration!

My girlfriends and I (5 total) came here Saturday, May 30th for afternoon lunch. We were greeted by a stale face behind the hostess booth that belonged to a dark haired chica who had clearly forgotten her manners at home. Luckily we had reservations, so we didn't have to sweat the hostess for very long. Unfortunately for us, the trend of awkward and awful service continued. \n\nWe ordered without any issue, and our food began to trickle onto our table after a short while. Everyone's except my sister's that is. Ok preface, I'm the chatty-extrovert-black sheep of the family, while my sister is much more reserved, ladylike, and soft spoken. So maybe the server just forgot about her and overlooked her order...4 times. We asked and asked for the food to arrive, and it finally did when we were all done with our meals. Meanwhile dish after dish came out for tables seated after us. The worse sin of all was that the server brought my sister the WRONG wine.

For the appetizer, we got a butter lettuce salad and beef tartare to share - both were pretty good, but I think I was more impressed with the beef tartare than the former.\n\nSince I had looked on Yelp before coming, I knew I either had to get the fried chicken or the burger, since that's what almost everybody was raving about.

We were checking out San Francisco restaurants one evening on Opentable, and Wayfare came up at the optimal time.  Why not try it?  We jumped at the chance!\n\nFortunately, I don't watch The Food Channel, so I was pretty much unaffected by the Tyler Florence Reputation.  My only previous exposure to the dude was the Tyler rotisserie in SFO Terminal 2, which gave me terminal envy.  (I usually fly United.)\n\nWayfare Tavern turns out to be a pretty well-oiled machine.  (The food wasn't especially oily, however, so that's one joke that I won't be able to make.)  After we were seated, our server asked us if we had ever come before.  When we shook our heads, she asked if we were tourists.\n\nWe told her that we had come from across the Bay, which probably made us seem sort of like space aliens.  I didn't feel much like a tourist, however, because I had just scored a parking space on Sacramento about a block and a half east of the restaurant.  (Someone pulled out of a space as I was driving down the street.)  Parking in this area is clearly problematic.\n\nOur server was friendly and professional.  My only quibble is that she tended to touch diners (me and people at other tables) on the shoulder.  This used to be a well-known ploy to increase tips.  Haven't we gotten beyond that?\n\nAnother mild negative: We were seated upstairs, where there's a single restroom.  (The sign on it says \"restrooms,\" but the plural is incorrect.)  Inside the restroom, the wastepaper basket for paper towels was full and overflowing, with balled-up paper on the floor.  That was sort of off-putting.\n\nThe food was excellent: I tried the leek potato soup, the steak tartare, the mac-and-cheese, the popovers....   These are all items that stream out of the kitchen in significant volume: everyone seemed to be ordering the same things.  The level of quality is maintained very well; you'd think that people in the kitchen would get bored by the repetition.  Lots of hamburgers were in evidence around the house -- I'll try one next time, despite my aversion to the concept of bried burgers.\n\nThe ambiance is very pleasant.  Casual people are all having a casual good time.  This is a good place to chill while you're plotting your next startup.  The best phrase for Wayfare Tavern is \"upscale laid-back, with a touch of Medieval England.\"\n\nI had a beer -- a large one.  It was the Scrimshaw Pilsner by North Coast Brewing Company, and it was perfect.  I tasted the Tyler Florence sauvignon blanc from Napa and liked it a lot as well.\n\nThey charged us $3 for homemade sparkling water.

Wayfare Burger - we got medium rare and it was cooked perfectly (don't skimp, add the egg)\n\n3. Oxtail Poutine - My fav! Ooey gooey deliciousness. Just.... Just get it!\n\n4. Mac n cheese - not my fav, but still delish. It had sweet and creamy notes and tons of bread crumbs.\n\n5. Chocolate Cream Pie - Rich and Decadent! \n\nService was perfect.

A friend and I shared the butter lettuce salad with green goddess dressing, organic fried chicken, loaded mashed potatoes, and dessert.  I can't say enough good things about the salad - it really was outstanding.  The salad had the perfect amount of dressing without overwhelming the vegetables, and the sprinkle of extra salt and pepper really made the flavors shine. \n\nWe both liked the chicken and mashed potatoes.  There is something to be said for simple food done well. \n\nThe s'mores cake had a very subtle flavor... Not our favorite.  It came with a cinnamon toast crunch ice cream which was more memorable than the cake itself.  \n\nWe could agree on one dessert to share (though, warning to those with less of a sweet tooth, they are certainly portioned for sharing!), so we also tried the doughnuts, which were excellent.  They are served warm with a crumble topping and several sauces (coconut, coffee, and caramel when we were there).

There said we could have 6 eastern and 6 western which I thought was odd - I'm paying $56 for 12 oysters and I can't have whichever one's I want? Then they only brought us eleven which I pointed out to our server. He sort of shrugged and then brought us one of the wrong one's we were shorted. He really didn't seem to care. Then my wife and my oysters both had pieces of shell in them and several of my wife's weren't property shucked. \n\n2) We had the salad and it was fine. \n\n3) The pop over arrived with our salad as I guess they forgot to bring them earlier. \n\n4) We waited.

I had the wild mushroom pappardelle, which is a rather healthy option as it consists of whole grain pasta, swiss chard, a slow cooked farm egg, and parmesan cheese. I liked how they put the whole egg in the middle of the dish with the pasta around it, because then you could break the egg and mix it in with the pasta. The parmesan is actually a foam, which made it slightly more interesting. However, in hindsight, I think I would have preferred the texture of the actual cheese in the dish.\n\nThe BF had the pork chop which was rich, robust, and full of flavor. I really liked the beans and breadcrumbs because it went great with the chop. It's a huge portion so we ended up boxing half to take home. His friend had the tai snapper and said it was really good too. \n\nI would love to come here again as lots of items on the menu looked interesting. Service was spot on.

I made the mistake by over ordering on appetizers which may have ruined my enjoyment of the actual entrees. So the things I liked were: steak tartare and the cucumber mule. To me the steak tartare with the potato chips was the best dish of the night. Things that were ok were the bone marrow and deviled eggs. The things I was kinda disappointed with was the fried chicken and mushroom rotollo.  The fried chicken was not bad, but it didn't really live up to the hype and while the skin was ok I felt the actual meat was dry. The mushroom rotollo was not very memorable.  Again, maybe I had too much food for appetizers to really enjoy the mushroom rotollo but it was not really that good in my opinion. The service was pretty bleh as well.

Who Tyler Florence is I have no idea, I have never been one of those chefs that was into all the celebrity chef nonsense. In my opinion, unless youve been a part of a michelin level team you are absolutely nothing special, but thats why i'll never make any money as a chef I guess.. We arrived for dinner service on 4th of July and took seats immediately at the bar, which is elegant and well stocked. The staff was friendly and knowledgable about the food, but perhaps not about cooking in general. The only problem with service was in fact the servers assistant who served the popovers to two of us and neglected the third and then again later gave a popover to us when they served another guest seperate from us, just odd is all. The atmosphere was nice, kinda like a claim jumper if youre familiar with that, real hunting lodge sorta place, looks fancy but really didnt seem to have anything to do with the california ive grown up in. But it really is nice though, if youre into that. The food. Now Wayfares signature dish is the fried chicken, so I, obviously, avoided that. When I here a restaurant is famous or this or that I wont try it because I already know it will be good, no i'll try everything else and really see how good the place is as a whole. So we had the oysters, burrata, beef tartare, burgers, boulevardier(SFs famous negroni made with rye whiskey). The oysters were well sourced, but the mignonette all vinegar, not pleasant really. The burata was visually appealing but lacked flavor, even when the figs were bit into with the cheese, i used to do a honey sea salt almond burrata that was killer because you directlyseason the burrata. Thats what this needed, salt or a coulis or something because this was tasteless unfinished mozzarela with figs on top. The burgers were good if basic level burgers for SF. One was undercooked, I suspect the cook fired both at the same time took the med rare of to rest and then the medium when it was rested and then didnt rest the medium, because it was still bloody, so please guys, let the meat rest, and be better cooks.. The fries, although lovely in being garlicky without chunks of garlic, were overseasoned. I ate a handfull before the sodium became too much. The tartare was visually nice but utterly disgusting. Way too heavily seasoned, peppery at the sneezing level, and lacking any flavor of beef at all. And served with potato chips when crostini is soooo much better. A tartare is really supposed to be a demonstration of the restaurants caliber and standards. Only a clean kitchen can serve tartare, and thus it is lightly seasoned and served. This was so seasoned and spiced and herbed out that it makes you suspect if they were hiding flaws in the beef and honestly I thought they were when my stomach ached slightly, but this passed and I was luckily not a victim of spoiled meat. Sorry guys, but the food here does not come close to matching the quality that is perceived in your reputation. I can only see this place being successful because of that Fidi lunch crowd of suburbanite bankers scarfing down burgers and the equally unurban rich folks who google search for celebrity related restaurants.

I also have to give some credit to Yelp too :)\n\nHe made a reservation on my birthday at 9:15 PM. I knew it would be late for dinner, but it was easier for us to score a reservation at that time. \n\nWe arrived earlier than our reservation, knowing that parking would be problematic in the area, but luckily, we were able to find parking nearby. When we entered the restaurant, it was approximately 8:36 PM, but I asked the hostess to seat us earlier because I knew that the dinner rush was over, and I was sure that tables would soon be opened. She was polite and asked us to wait for a few minutes so that she could find us a table.\n\nA few moments later, she seated us, and I noticed that there was a birthday card stashed to the side of the table. It was a sweet gesture from the restaurant. Kudos to them. \n\nThe ambiance was loud with nice music in the background but definitely not intimate because tables were aligned closely together. There's my first complaint :) I felt bad for the patrons next to us who had to hear me bitching about my work; I'm sure they heard our entire conversation, and they weren't drunk either :P No wonder they later ordered wine with their entrees..... :)\n\nThe complimentary bread came first, and it was delicious! Warm and fresh out of the oven, it was portioned perfectly and had an airy texture inside. I spread some soft butter on it, and it quickly became a flawless small appetizer to hold me over until we got our entrees. We got seconds on this bad boy because I just couldn't resist when the busser asked us if we wanted more bread. \n\nThen, we got the poutine. It was my first time ever eating this dish, and I wasn't disappointed. It was scattered with oxtail and cheese, and the fries were plentiful. It was a nice starter to our meal. \n\nThe wait to get our entrees was longer than I could ever imagine. I think we might've waited 30 mins for the organic fried chicken,  brocollini, and baked Mac and cheese to be served to us. I almost lost my appetite when the food was delivered to us. \n\nThe skin of the fried chicken was crispy with its infused rosemary flavored exterior. The meat was moist and soft; I've never tasted fried chicken cooked to this quality. I would've liked the skin to have a stronger punch in flavor-- some spices would've heightened the dish and added a kick to the flavors. Fresh squeezed lemon was paired well with the chicken, and as odd as I thought it was, it worked. \n\nThe brocollini was surprisingly delicious. It's one of my favorite vegetables to eat at home, and the flavors added an interesting punch to its simplicity. Although it was good, it was still nothing for me to rave about. After all, it was still brocollini. \n\nThe baked Mac and cheese was a nice addition to the entire meal. It was heavy, nonetheless, and set me over the edge, but I still enjoyed it. However, I still found it to be a bit more salty to my liking. The cheese was of good quality; my boyfriend informed me that it came from a specialty cheese called Vella in Sonoma, where we visited. \n\nThe customer service was pleasant, but the server came off as too reserved to us. She was quiet and unenthusiastic, but that's nothing to complain about. She was polite at least. I was enjoying a nice meal with my boyfriend, and that meant more to me.", "author": "Susan N."}

It is perfect for a first date, a family reunion, friends gathering and just for the day to day lunch/dinner. The menu is consistent and served all day long. \n\nReccomendations: \n\nOxtail Poutine: The first poutine dish I have ever tasted, and it is a crowed pleaser, Very rich so it is a good dish to share. Generous serving of Oxtail for Oxtail lover.s \n\nFried Chicken: Moist, flavorful, crispy, and mouthwatering! Some of the best fried chicken dishes I have ever tasted! Just like out of a a soul food kitchen. \n\nWayfare Burger: This burger was cooked to complete perfection, medium rare with a bit of blood in the center. The beef is savory, flavorful,  and filling.", "author": "Kimberly G."}

Today, I stopped in for a quick lunch before the main rush.\n\nThe service is great. My server was Danase, who was helpful, pleasant, and knowledgable. We ordered the signature fried chicken and a chicken salad sandwich. I'm actually not a huge fan of the fried chicken (don't hate me, but I just love my KFC), but I know many people who enjoy it thoroughly.\n\nHowever, my chicken salad sandwich came open-faced on a thick slice of bread, which pretty much ruined the dish for me. The chicken salad was flavorful, full of curry, and had great texture with bits of celery. But the bread was cold, thick, and too hard to cut with a knife. I asked for a popover (which might be my favorite thing in the entire restaurant) to use as bread, but Danase brought me a hamburger bun instead, which was even better and saved the day.\n\nPROS\n- Excellent service\n- Solid menu\n- Raw bar is a highlight\n\nCONS\n- Very expensive\n\nTIPS\nGo early or make a reservation.

My boyfriend took me here for my birthday on 7/15/13 and it was a major disappointment.\n\nWe had reservations for 7:15pm and arrived a few minutes early.  The hostess brought us upstairs only to find that our table was given to someone else so she walked us back downstairs and stuffed us in the corner.  Our waiter dropped by a few minutes later and took our drink orders.  It took 10 minutes for our drinks to arrive and another 5 before our waiter reappeared to take our food orders. \n\nWe tried:\n- Watermelon Mojito: Mostly ice and no watermelon flavor...definitely not worth $11.\n\n- Deviled Eggs: I had high expectations of these and I am sad to say that I have had better at buffets.  The eggs were pretty dry and not creamy like I expected...really not sure what the rave is about.\n\n- French Fried Oysters: best dish of the day...I really enjoyed the flavorful and super crunchy batter.  The lemon tartar sauce was a nice complement to the oysters.\n\n- Organic Fried Chicken: The different herbs like terragon and thyme is dispersed throughout the batter which really makes this dish more special than traditional fried chicken.  The chicken was also very moist and I was enjoying it until we got to the last piece.  I cut into it only to find that it was under-cooked.  We pointed it out to our waiter and he argued that it wasn't raw since they sous vide the chicken prior to frying it. This was the thigh piece and was significantly larger than the other pieces and it was really pink next to the bone...it looked raw (refer to picture).  He offered us another piece but I was pretty upset by then and declined.\n\n- Macaroni and Cheese: Meh...nothing special.\n\nI would've ordered dessert since I have heard wonderful things about their Peach Pie but was pretty done with the place by then.  I think that the leftover that my sister brought back on a previous occasion tasted better so maybe the kitchen staff was having an off-day.  Plus, I was really unhappy about the overall service (from the waiter's attitude to the speed at which we got our food and drinks).\n\nSadly, I will not be returning.

More on that near-perfect part at the end but first the decor and food:\n\nOnce you've walked in (and especially ascended to the 2nd floor), you feel as if you've time-traveled back about a 100 years or so, to an Edwardian night club or Victorian salon.  Imagine vintage prints, maps, flatware, and taxidermy -lots of taxidermy.  It all comes together so well, on a base of antique wood floors that apparently was taken from an actual Kentucky barn. Talk about authentic design.\n\nThe food was spectacular, some of the nest New American cuisine I've ever had.  We started with the deviled eggs with bread & butter pickle, green tabasco, & celery and they were quite good, rivaling my favorites at Park Tavern.  My wife also had the butter lettuce salad with the Green Goddess dressing, avocado, ruby grapefruit, & red radish which she enjoyed a lot.  \n\nFor our main courses, I ordered both the fried chicken and burger because after all, why should I have to decide between them? \n\nThe organic fried chicken deserves its own paragraph, it might be the best I've had, at least the best in recent memory.  It's made with buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herbs, and lemon  There's 3 steps of preparation where the spices, garlic and lemon are worked in, during the brining, during the frying, and the serving (as garnish).  It all makes a difference.  If you're going to go here once, order the fried chicken.\n\nI also had the burger with brie, roasted bacon, and roasted onion and what was unique was that it was served with a sweet brioche bun, which gave it an interesting flavor.  I enjoyed it a lot with the homemade mayonnaise, and while it was superb, it wasn't as good as the chicken.  Did I mention I really liked the fried chicken?  \n\nAnd last, we'll give the mac 'n' cheese an honorable mention, it was quite heavenly.\n\nSo why not 5 stars?  The service was very professional but our waiter was a bit stuffy most of the time, and took away from the otherwise homey atmosphere.", "author": "Saminda W."}

They're piping hot and fluffy, and combined with the black salt butter they provide, these are a serious treat.\n\nNow, on to the actual (vegetarian) food..\n\nAvocado and Hearts of Palm Salad: A perfect light appetizer. The hearts of palm give this tiny salad a great crunch, and the honey lime dressing complements the avocado very well.\n\nDeviled Eggs: I mean, they weren't bad, but I certainly don't think they lived up to the Yelp hype. The egg white is marinated, which gives this dish a bit of a unique flavor, but overall, this didn't blow my mind.\n\nMushroom Poutine: A little over-salted in my opinion, but a very flavorful dish. The mozzarella curd was the shining star of this dish.\n\nChickpea and Ricotta Tortelloni: I normally groan when the only vegetarian option on the menu is a pasta dish, but this one was arguably better than the meat entrees we ordered. This dish makes you want to just drink the sauce, but you have to scoop a little of everything. The toy box tomatoes are deliciously juicy, and there is a surprising crunch from the nuts. Even the jalapenos add to the flavor of the dish without much of a kick.\n\nPeaches and Cream: A favorite at our table. The tres leche cake is so soft, and the poached peach is so juicy. Yum!\n\nHomemade doughnuts: YES. That is all I can say. YES, you should get them. YES YES YES.\n\nThe service at Wayfare Tavern deserves 5 stars.

Fix and I'll gladly revise.\n\nOK, start with good news, the food. Had trouble deciding between burger and chicken. Waiter said chicken is five pieces, more than one person \"should\" eat. And I was going to be out all day and evening so could not take some away with me, it could turn in that time. Decided on burger, no mayonnaise (calling it aioli does not change it), cooked medium, also butternut squash soup.\n\nThe soup said it came with \"chestnut crema\". This was not the crema they squirt on things in Mexican restaurants, thankfully, but was added to the squash puree. The pain perdu looked like little cubes of bread pudding. They were really tasty and added chew to soup. Soup was creamy and tasty, a little undersalted but that's easy to fix. When they brought the burger I wondered if I was supposed to unhinge my jaw like a rattlesnake to eat it, that's how thick it was! About halfway through it disintegrated to the point I had to eat the rest with a fork. Whatever their proprietary blend, it's really good, not a burger that needs to be tortured with odd toppings to taste good. Everything on it was good. It came with a cup of nice crispy fries and a little dish of cucumber slices, counterpoint to all the rich food. For dessert I had the toffee pudding, which is really more like a cake. The orange ice cream toppled off as soon as I started eating it, which is a sign of goodness. Sticky toffee pudding has been on my list of \"things to try\" and I'm glad I did.\n\nSo, what went wrong?\n\nAt least in the corner where I sat, it was cold. Not comfortably cool, cold. After lunch I went to the restroom, which was freezing. When I left Wayfare I was literally shivering with cold. The restroom is downstairs. Mobility no problem for me but vision is and the staircase was pretty dark. I saw they were doing construction, hopefully will add more light. Because someone who's had a few cocktails could take a tumble on dark stairs.\n\nMy soup was tepid. I can see restaurants would worry about liability if they served scalding hot soup but there is a lot of room between scalding and tepid. They started me with an excellent popover.  I tried to wait for soup to eat it with, but it was getting cold. I ordered tea to have with my burger, when asked what kind specified English Breakfast. When burger came asked for tea. They asked, what kind did I want? English Breakfast. I wait ... I wait ... I asked someone for my tea, he said it's on the way. Burger half gone, no tea. Asked someone else, he said they are bringing it. I wait... no tea. I made eye contact with someone who may have been a manager or headwaiter or something, he seemed to be authority figure, he came over and asked if something was wrong. I asked for my tea. He consulted with another employee, then came back and asked what kind of tea I wanted. Not only had I already said English Breakfast twice, but clearly it was not \"on the way\" as I had been told twice, it had apparently not been prepared. The authority person came back to me and said they are bringing your tea, \"dear\". Dear? Dear? I'm his dear? Mind you I was getting a bit annoyed although far from irate; would this man have addressed a justifiably annoyed male customer as \"Dear\"? He probably thought it was nice, I found it condescending. \n\nSo service problems - fix, and I'll come back and rate it a four. Bringing a cooler to try the chicken.", "author": "Carol S."}

These hostesses just seem like they aren't happy to be there and that it's just a job for them and feel that they don't need to have a wonderful personality or smile and maybe think that they are above everyone else around them. Not the right kind of employees to have in a such a successful business such as this one who produces volumes of customers. \n\nI hope they they truly train these hostesses in being better at giving excellent customer service.

The service was top notch and the food delicious! The inside of the restaurant had a \"old money\" feel but cozy and comfortable. For starters we ordered the Poutine. My very first experience with Poutine was at Whistler, Canada in 2005. Poutine is pretty much shoestring fries  topped with... not gravy, but pot roast, yum! It was good but had better in Whistler.  For our entrees I ordered the wayfare burger topped with an egg and hubby ordered the fried chicken with side of Mac and Cheese. So far, one of the best burgers I've had. Very juicy, delicious and full of flavor. The brioche bun was perfect with the burger.  My hubby's fried chicken, had better elsewhere @ (Townhall, SF) thought the rosemary on the fried chicken was a bit over powering and the Mac n cheese was lacking flavor. Towards the end of our dinner, our server surprised us with a anniversary dessert with a candle. So thoughtful! Lastly I cannot forget to mention the popovers! Such a wonderful treat and definitely not your typical bread you get at restaurants before \nyour entree arrives. The popovers were warm, fluffy and crisp on the outside. Definitely want to come back and try their deviled eggs and steak tartare.", "author": "Jocelyn T."}

We became immediately disconnected though with the irritable beginning from the hostess. (Sorry we interrupted you when we arrived) ...  still waiting on that welcome, and greeting.  Our server was unfortunately no better; nonchalance and indifference do not befit a restaurant of Wayfare's stature.\n\nThe popovers are incredibly irresistible, and AMAZING.  We started with a few appetizers including the deviled eggs, and potato tot poutine -  both were just ok.  \n \nWife had prime beef tartare, and crab legs.  While the tartare was absolute perfection, my wife found the crab legs generically presented and stringy.  The Fried chicken entr\u00e9e was good- but just because a high end restaurant serves fried chicken doesn't mean it's awesome (a la popovers, tartare); Sorry -  it didn't live up to the hype\n\nFive stars for the tartare, and the popovers, given the rest of the Wayfare experience was generally forgettable, rounded down to three stars", "author": "Robert M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-24", "description": "If you don't know who Tyler Florence is, he's a chef.  He's famously (more or less) known as one of Food Network's numerous television personalities.  As one of Tyler Florence's creations, Wayfare Tavern sits smack dab in the heart of San Francisco's financial district.  More oft than not, many are attracted to this place for that reason.  I came upon this place due to their reputation of grandeur fried chicken.  \n\nBun and I have been together for eons.  Eons means a very long time without explaining how many EXACT years when people ask because the EXACT number may be a bit embarrassingly foggy.  I know her inside out, and she knows I like fried chicken.  Wayfare Tavern has a charming personality of classy comfort; a trait I believed Bun would be comfortable with.  This was the perfect choice to springboard us to the next level of what has been in the making for \"eons\".  Not only that, she'd never suspect me popping the BIG question during lunch.       \n\nAscending the staircase, I could peer down into the kitchen.  Curiosity besieges me when I can look into any kitchen.  (How clean is it?  What's going on in there?  Do any food fights ever ensue during busy times?)  When seated our waiter described to us the specials and gave us some time to look through the menu.  The menu is an ensemble of some classic American dishes sprinkled with flair.  \n\nPassing on the exquisite sounding bone marrow and their super burger coined, \"le grand\", she ordered the steak sandwich.  Not too surprised, as Bun typically sticks with something not so far outside her box.  As an appetizer we got the poutine, and yes, I picked the fried chicken as my main.  Since sharing is caring and portion sizes were larger than expected we shared everything.  Bun requested her sandwich be cut in half and I divvied up some of the fried chicken to her so we could both.  Our appetites were on full rev. \n\nI don't encounter poutine much, but by the description, fancying up poutine is kind of like making gourmet nachos.  There's a gray area of classy and trying too hard.  While not exceptional, point for being deliciousness was achieved.  For a starter it was on a heavy side.  Though let's be frank, who the hell is counting calories if they're coming here.  As for her main dish, the steak sandwich was cooked wonderfully upon request; there was more bread compared to meat for my liking.  As a point of noting, the steak was prepared remarkably.  \n\nOh my fried chicken!  It was simply incredible.  The chicken was so good; I decided to start another paragraph with it.  Plating was presented eloquently, I painfully resisted my temptations of being a pig and just devouring every little bit.  I even broke off pieces of the herb and ate it with the chicken.  The white pieces of meat weren't dry at all even.  I definitely recommend it.  \n\nSlowly finishing our eating frenzy, anxiousness started to rise.  In disguising my state of mind, I wondered if she knew what I was thinking.  Curiously enough a picture of a dancing Panda playing the piano instantly jumped into my train of thought.  Bouncing back, I struggled to find a conversational opening to begin.  This sensation was strikingly similar to Frogger on level 10.  I thought to myself, do what you came here to do.  Finally, the BIG question I will be asked.  The BIG question she'd never see coming.      \n\n\"Hun... (Gulp) will you...\"\nI pause to drink some sparkling water.\n \"...will you...eat the rest of that chicken?  If not, I could help you handle that.\"\n\nThat didn't turn out the way I imagined.  Anyway, I'm coming back for that out of control hype deserving fried chicken.", "author": "Arnold T."}

The hostess promptly seated us at the Chef's Counter, which was fun because we both love to cook and love to watch the kitchen. It took at least 5 minutes for the waiter to give us some attention. He was very friendly, asked if we were first time guests (which we were), and then he promptly recommended the specials but his accent was just thick enough where you got the glimpse of the specials but not really.\n\nHowever, we had already made up our mind of having the fried chicken, seeing it plated before us many times. No sides though (all al la carte). Really! How hard is it to throw some starch on the plate when you are paying $25 for 5 small pieces of fried chicken? I ordered a side of brussel sprouts with pomegranate seeds and fried capers and my friend ordered mac and cheese. My brussel sprouts were awesome (how can it not be when it is deep fried and heavily sprinkled with large flakes of salt? \n\nWe had to flag our waiter down, however, when one of our chicken pieces was undercooked - really?

From the poutine, to the pop overs, the fried chicken, the hamburger, the pie... everything is made to perfection.\n\nLONG:\nI have been here many times at dinner mostly for business meetings since the atmosphere is quite elegant. But don't let this discourage you, the lunch time atmosphere is delightfully friendly and they don't even look at me askance when I walk in in flip flops :)\n\nI cannot list the pros of all the dishes I have had here as Yelp does not allow for enough characters to describe all the moth wateringly delectable dishes they offer. Instead i will give a brief over view of a few favorites....\n\nPOUTINE! POUTINE! POUTINE! -- This is hands down one of the best dishes on the menu. If you have never had or heard of it, stop what you are doing right now and go get some! It's the crispiest french fries you can get. They are crispy on the outside but soft on the inside and it's more like a pastry than a french fry. Top that with a buttery, smooth, soul warming gravy and squeaky mozzarella cheese curds that are slightly melty but still have enough substance to stick gleefully to the fries. Then add oxtail that has been shredded and cooked down so that it literally melts in your mouth. Now you have one of the best hang over foods ever invented (starch, fat, sauce) and a dish everyone at the table will be fighting over.\nI suggest not sharing and getting your own!\n\nTHE TAVERN BURGER - Yeah, yeah it's a burger...right. What could be so special about a burger? Well the fact that it's so special they can't even tell you what's in it, says a lot! I think it must be made out of unicorns because it's magical. This is one of the heartiest, juiciest, well balanced burgers you will eat. If you put ketchup on this, and I am a huge fan of ketchup, you need to have your head checked. The brioche bun is soft but it still holds up to the juicy sauciness of this burger. The bacon is crispy and smoky, the marmalade is sweet to balance it and the cheddar is salty and tangy. NOTE: Add the egg, always add the egg....\n\nBAKED MACARONI AND CHEESE - It's ooey, it's gooey, it's cheesy, hot and melty.  If you like all those things, get this to share.\n\nORGANIC FRIED CHICKEN - This is hands down one of the crispiest pieces of fried chicken I have ever tasted, and I'm from Alabama! I think it's the fact that they brine it overnight then soak it in buttermilk but the outcome is really just divine. It's herbaceous, crispy and yet somehow light even though you know it's been fried.\n\nThe wait staff are extremely attentive, knowledgeable and accommodating. We came here once for a friend's birthday specifically to get the poutine. After we were seated and looked over the menu our hearts sank because poutine was not on the menu. We asked the waiter and told him our story. He went into the kitchen and talked to the chef then came back out and told us that they could make us something close to poutine just for our table. It was the kind of service you don't see all the time. We then later saw Tyler Florence himself going into the kitchen to get his hands dirty!\n\nOverall a fantastic place, can't say enough good things.", "author": "Dana V."}

The burger here is one of the best I have ever eaten.  A perfectly cooked patty which was juicy and flavorful, topped with melted brie, crispy bacon, perfectly grilled onions, and a soft brioche bun.  Normally you eat a burger and enjoy the first few bites and then it doesn't taste as good towards the end.  I enjoyed ever last bite and forced myself to finish the last few bites even after i was completely stuffed, because this burger was AMAZING!  The pickles were also very tasty, but the fries were a little salty for me.  \n\nThat burger patty was really amazing, I dont know what blend of meat they used but they did it right!  I ordered my burger medium rare, it seemed a little on the red side, and you normally think its too raw and dont get the full flavor of the beef..but this burger was just amazing.  \n\nThe fried chicken is also delicious.

Something different, unique, and so tasty. Garlic popovers were my favorite, I could just eat this by itself! \n- Each person gets a fresh and warm pop over on the side to start as well. The best popover I have ever tasted, it beats all those prime rib restaurants in the city. This one is crispy and just perfect. \n- Fried Chicken: buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herbs, with lemon wedges. Chicken was fried pretty well and the herb/lemon flavor topped it off. I wish it came with something on the side like vegetables or fries. \n\nImprovements: \n- Wayfare Burger: Marin brie, roasted onion, smoked bacon, br\u00eeoche, and sunny side egg (+$2 more).

Wayfare Tavern was so awesome. \n\nWe actually weren't supposed to end up here -- but drove into town earlier than anticipated after Monterey turned out to be a total bore. So we cancelled our reservation there and managed to snag a reservation at Wayfare instead, which was super convenient since we were staying a few blocks away. \n\nThe space is cool -- that's probably the best way to describe it. It's got a sort of upscale, old school tavern feel. We had a nice table on the second floor. The service was excellent as well. \n\nAnd the food - the food! So they start you off with popovers and delicious butter. It is beyond my grasp why more restaurants don't serve popovers. They're relatively easy to make and so good - airy, flaky, hot and buttery. I had two, but I could have eaten about six, if I hadn't, ya know, needed to eat actual food for dinner. \n\nMy wife started with the Caesar. She totally loved it, but it has anchovies and egg. So if you don't like anchovies and egg, don't order it. We also the octopus as an appetizer, and it was great as well. \n\nFor her entr\u00e9e, my wife got the poutine with mushrooms (instead of oxtail). She enjoyed it. I got a special. (I think. Her memory is better than mine.) Though I can't remember what I got, I remember thinking it was wonderful, as there was nothing about the experience that I didn't love. \n\nThe dessert, however, is easier to remember, because my wife took a picture. My wife got deconstructed strawberry shortcake, a concept that really worked. And I got a chocolate cream pie. Now here's the thing: I love chocolate, and I love pie. But chocolate cream pies -- they always let me down. But this one didn't. It was maybe the best chocolate cream pie I've ever had. It was just creamy enough but had enough density to be rich and decadent. \n\nOh, I think I got a beer there also. I may have actually had two. And I think the beer list was pretty decent. \n\nSo yeah, no complaints here. It might have been my favorite dinner of our trip, which was 11 nights of highly-rated restaurants across coastal California and Oregon -- so that's saying something.", "author": "Dan I."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-10", "description": "Seven months into his operation, and I think it's fair to say that Tyler Florence's Wayfare Tavern is clicking. Unlike other prolific Yelpers, I'm really slow when it comes to visiting the new hot spots in town. It's not for any pretentious reason like waiting for the chef de cuisine to work out the kinks. I'm just lazy, but I eventually come around if the buzz refuses to fade. As anyone with Comcast knows, Florence is a likably lunkish celebrity chef on the Food Network. Neither arrogant like Bobby Flay nor a constant cut-up like Guy Fieri, he comes across as sincerely enthusiastic and comparatively uncomplicated. So does his restaurant in the former Rubicon space. \n\nSimply put, he serves up beautifully executed comfort food gussied up for upscale SF tastes. We were taken to the second floor to a table for two closest to the top of the stairs. The setting is clubby chic with a bit of the rustic, a lot of dark wood, dark printed wallpaper, and exposed brick. It's fair to say there is nothing on the menu I wouldn't want to try. Well, maybe not the poutine because I had really soggy poutine in Vancouver earlier this year. But everything else was quite tempting. The first thing that came to our table were the complimentary popovers (see photo). Hard to resist since they remind me of the Pillsbury crescent rolls my mom used to serve with her meat loaf.\n\nExcept these had a nice crust that captured the dribbles of butter I spooned on. Decadent, huh... Well, it doesn't get healthier. I had my mind set to try the $14 Chicken Liver Mousse since the recent memory of an exquisite foie gras variation of the same appetizer at Balthazar in Manhattan lingers in my palate. To my surprise, it came in a jar with a layer of chicken fat on top (see photo). Disgusting, right? Nope, it was smoothly decadent. Not quite the revelation that Balthazar's is but close. It came with toasted wedges of brioche that looked probably not coincidentally like Texas toast, and the California twist was a dollop of pomelo marmalade that added sweet to the savory. \n\nAfter that indulgence came our entrees. Predictably, Jamie W. had the $22 Organic Fried Chicken - four plump, juicy pieces that were buttermilk-brined and covered with bits of roasted garlic, herbs and lemon (see photo). Really good poultry well turned. I went for the $28 Pot Roast, which was a large short rib that had been braising for two days. It came with creamy whipped potatoes and a truffle onion confit, all ladled with a veal jus. Fork tender and absolutely delicious with all the upscale touches. For our shared side, we went with the waitress' recommendation of the $8 Roasted Winter Broccoli, a hearty variety that was slightly overwhelmed by the salt in the mustard green pesto (see photo). The raisins provided a welcome zing of sweetness as did some unexpected hazelnuts. \n\nWe couldn't leave the table without trying one of the $9 desserts and picked the Pineapple Upside Down Cake to share, a real throwback to the '60's that came with coconut ice cream and macadamia nut crumble (see photo). Really sweet but tasty for as much as I could take it. Three bites and a mouthful of the ice cream, and I was honestly done. We could barely move at this point, but it was worth the extra shekels for such a satisfying, thoughtfully made dinner. Ironically, another favorite of mine, Wexler's, is just a couple of doors down on the same block, and they share similar culinary territory. It's good to have such terrific comfort food choices in the FiDi. \n\nFOOD - 5 stars...between the fried chicken and the pot roast is a comfort food bonanza \nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...warm decor matches the food well \nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...very helpful but not overly so \nTOTAL - 5 stars...Tyler's done good", "author": "Ed U."}

The experience here will cloak you with this American-modern-upscale, woodsy-elegant atmosphere paired with food items like fried chicken, a burger, deviled eggs, steak and fries. Conceptually it makes sense, especially since New American is Tyler Florence's forte and he's a great chef. But, there's just too much emphasis on the American and not enough on the New. Everything could stand to be either more refined, or with a more unique spin to it that would make it actually memorable.\n\nBecause everything, while admittedly really tasty, was not upped the ante enough to justify paying an insanely pretty penny for it, nor were any the best in show of their categories. The mac and cheese decadent but was also overcooked, and came in a broken, separated sauce. The burger was decent, but not memorably so and especially not at $20 a pop. The fried chicken was succulent and piping hot, but also severely under-seasoned and nearly $30. They had a special side that day of a short rib poutine, which was savory, saucy, and delicious over crispy fries. But it was also gravy, pork, and fries, so the components essentially spoke for themselves.\n\nI did like the popovers in place of a bread basket, though. That was a charming spin. They were light, buttery, and addictive.\n\nWorth a try, sure, but the food just wasn't a memorable (or cheap) one for me.", "author": "Betty W."}

I guess this is still destination dining?  Wayfare Tavern also strikes me as a nice 'welcome to the firm' or quasi-power lunch place for FiDi suits.\n\nMaybe it's the economy or just, time of day, but it was rather empty on a weekday afternoon.\n\nWayfare is classic rustic American fare in upscale hunting lodge atmosphere.  Replete with stag head mounted over fireplace.  Dark wood everywhere, handsome interior and exterior, very comfortable.\n\nAs you might expect, the lounges/restrooms downstairs are also lovely and well-kept.  Wait staff are all sharply uniformed.  Service is friendly, attentive, water glasses re-filled on the reg.  Total pros here.\n\nComplimentary popovers were delicious.  We really wanted to try the cocktails, which sounded creative and, I'm sure, would have been perfectly shaken stirred and presented.\n\nBut with no designated drivers, we stuck with water, organic root beer and coffee.  Root beer was very good-- refreshing, natural and not too sweet.\n\nMy partner-in-dine oohed and aahed over the Steak medallions, which were exactly as ordered-- medium rare.  The Cuban pork on pork sandwich looked and tasted great too.  Frites came with both our selections.  That Macaroni and cheese side was as sophisticated and excellent as can be-- one of the best I've had in a long time.\n\nEverything at Wayfare Tavern is of the highest quality-- and of course, priced that way... even the lunch offerings.  Didn't notice any happy hour specials here, but that doesn't mean there aren't any.\n\nNow that I've tried the Wayfare fare, I can say the menu seems solid and well-executed.  I'm not sure, though, if I'd make it a 'must go back' spot.  Overall was a really pleasant experience.", "author": "Jade T."}

The toppings (capers, shrimp, pickles, etc. they changed each time I was here) added a perfect touch.\n- Fried Chicken - Good, but can't say it rivals Ad Hoc's chicken\n\nThe Average: (not much to say for these other than they were alright) \n- Snapper \n- Mussels\n- All the desserts (Red velvet cake, panna cotta, strawberry rhubarb tart, carrot cake, chocolate pie)\n\nThe Bad:\n- Ahi Tuna - The tuna was mixed with a radish salad. It was a very reddish/pinkish/purpleish dish and I think it must've been the worse combo ever. The tuna had neither natural flavor, nor added flavor. The radish as well. The dish was very dry and bland and just gross.\n- Mac & Cheese - Burnt & sour\n\nSo the good and the bad kind of cancel out and that just leaves the average hence the 3 stars. \n\nTypical dark wood decor, bricks, moose head, & a fireplace.\n\nWon't be back as there are a million non-average restaurants in the area.

The space feels antiqued but modern, large yet intimate. I've been to Wayfare twice-- once for dinner and the next for a weekend lunch. Lunch was my most recent experience, which did not disappoint.\n\nFirst, the expectation that this is a 'brunch' place should be dismissed. You are here for lunch and the menu reflects that, with salads, pastas and a burger. However, there is an egg dish that is a delicious bite-- the deviled eggs. They are creamy and peppery-- it was a shame that we had six people in our party as it meant only one bite! \n\nI made a meal of two sides-- the baked mac and cheese and the caramelized mushrooms. The Mac and cheese was delectably rich-- ooey gooey in the center and a crisp breaded top. The mushrooms were a bit dry and probably better in smaller quantities to be shared-- my fault for thinking I could eat the amount served by myself. The rest of my party enjoyed lobster salads and chicken in various preparations. The portions were hearty!\n\nThe service and cocktail menu round out the overall experience. They have a great selection of wines as well as creative cocktails. I enjoyed a delicious and dry rose, but others enjoyed the freshness of the cucumber mule. It should also be noted that lunch and dinner also include a delicious and warm popover, served with salt and butter. \n\nWayfare is a solid restaurant that nails food, service and ambiance!", "author": "Bryan B."}

The server was attentive to our every peep and took care of business. The most amazing thing I can remember was the dinner roll which isn't really a roll but more of a pastry. Don't know what it's called but it was out of this world. \n\nThe fried chicken was tender and juicy and in hindsight, I should of asked for some hot sauce but the first time I visit an establishment, I usually order the item as it is described on the menu as sort of an acid test of the quality.

The FiDi lunch rush had come and gone so I had my pick of seats at the Chefs Counter where you can get a nice view of the kitchen happenings.\n\nThe complimentary POPOVER was doughy air sprinkled with cheese.  Did I like it?  Of course.  Did I want to get my tat on?  Nope.  (But I'm not mad at cha.)***  The Hangtown Fry was like a deconstructed frittata ($23).  A circle of scrambled then baked Petaluma eggs with savory breakfast goodies piled on top.  My favorite item was the crunchy fried oysters (though they were a little salty) and a close second was the slivers of thick cut bacon.  There were also onions, roasted potatoes, and an artery clogging Jack cheese sauce.  Thank gawd for the watercress on top as it greened up the plate.  A little.\n\nIn contrast, I was disappointed when I came here for BF's birthday dinner last October.  It was a busy Friday night, we were upstairs, and it was deafening loud.  My Fried Chicken ($22) was so salty it was almost inedible and sides were extra.  I liked both the Baked Mac and Cheese and the interesting take on Roasted Broccoli ($8 each).  Unfortunately, the Pumpkin Pudding Cake did not have much pumpkin flavor and the inside of the Fried Apple Pie was almost as cold as the luscious Sage Ice Cream it came with ($9 each).  The best dessert?

I'm just glad the fried chicken ($22) stays. We also had the steak frites ($27). It came with a truffle sauce and was cooked to perfection. It also came with a very generous portion of fries.

They were good, the filling is very rich as many other reviewers mentioned.  \nFor my main course, I had the veal chop.  They did a good job of cooking it to a medium rare and it tasted good overall, just a little overseasoned.  The heirloom tomatoes that came on the side were delicious!  \nMy friend had the steak frites.  The meat was a little chewier than I would have liked.

All my coworkers who I went with would likely rate it 4 or even 5 stars. The ambience is very woodsy as you enter. It feels like an upscale log cabin, with brick on the interior walls. Lots of stuffed animal heads to be found as well! My vegan sister would not be thrilled...\n\nPositives\n+Big enough menu. Could have used more in the way of veggie protein (beans, cheese, tofu, really anything), but certainly a large and tempting menu for meat eaters. My co-workers had a hard time deciding between a massive burger, award-winning fried chicken, salmon and a ruben sandwich.\n+Co-workers said they were in \"food coma\" the rest of the day. The meat dishes were all very large and satisfying. Top hits were the fried chicken, which they said was moist rather than dry with a perfect crisp to it and the burger, which oozed egg and was a very thick patty.\n+Free popovers when you're seated. A big hit over the traditional bread basket! These were served warm and reminded me of how my grandmother used to make them. Flakey and doughy goodness! Butter and sea salt was on the table for toppers, but the sea salt would do well with a little spoon, so everyone's hands aren't in it.\n\nNegatives\n-As I mentioned above, a major lack of veggie options. There was one mushroom pasta-bake dish, but that felt quite heavy for the warm day. The only other options were roasted carrots or a market salad. I got the market salad, and for $18, it is a simply puny option. The dressing was good, but toppings were scarce (about 4 chickpeas) and a variety of lettuce. When I ordered it, the waiter asked if I wanted to top it with any protein (aka chicken or fish, as they had it listed), I said no, and he looked a bit surprised. I thought it was snarky to call it protein as if that's the only protein that exists! I'm pretty laid-back as vegetarians go, but cmon, a puny salad does not a lunch make. For such a nice restaurant, I'd expect more options!\n-Co-workers mentioned the ruben bread wasn't great. They said it was too thick for the sandwich, and it took taste away from the actual meat of the sandwich. \n-Waiter was slow. We had to keep calling him over when we wanted to order or needed anything, he really didn't check on us.\n-As a group of six, we were sat in a very long booth. I was the first in, and there was no way I was going to the bathroom to the end of the meal! They're not that easy to scooch in and out of!\n\nBeing vegetarian, I won't run back again.

We strongly suggest making reservations for Wayfare Tavern. It is located in the Financial District and can get super busy - even on a school night! If you are ever stuck waiting for a table and the bar is full - pop over to Wexler or Irish Times for a pre-drink and than come back. The atmosphere inside is cozy, rustic, and filled with old school charms. Exposed brick walls, wooden tables and an open kitchen with bar seats was inviting and very entertaining.\n\nWe were seated in an intimate corner with some privacy and close enough to some kitchen action. As we watched Deviled Eggs (most popular item), Seared Octopus, Butter Lettuce Salad poured out meticulously, we secretly wonder if anyone would notice if we stole a bite here and there...\n\nSeared Octopus 15: Tender octopuses, scallion, linguica, hollandaise, cippolini onion were filled with robust bbq flavors from the grill.\n\nAmerican Kobe Tartare 16: fresh chopped beef, French mustard dressing, garlic popovers was perfect. Pairing minced beef over popovers was perfect. Spread it over like butter. Instead of the crackling of waffle chips or crostinis , garlic bread was a gentler approach.\n\nThe Chicken Liver Pate made with saba balsamic jelly and arugula was sold out. Our server suggested the French Fried Oysters 12! Lightly breaded, plump juicy oysters were a close resemblance to the deep fried cauliflowers and served with tartar sauce, shaved cauliflower, lemon juice. \n\nWayfare Burger \"Le Grand\" 19 + sunny side up Petaluma egg 2: The patty is made from grass-fed proprietary grind, served with Marin brie, roasted onion, smoked bacon, and br\u00eeoche. We felt dirty eating this. But we couldn't put it down. As the yolk oozed and enveloped each bite, I was scared. Please don't send to the principal's office! I will be good tomorrow and drink some organic cold press juices. I will go for a morning run and a juice cleanse.

The butter lettuce salad was exquisite - fresh butter lettuce, avocado, and grapefruit with the lightest, most delicate dressing. For dinner I had the chicken paillard - the chicken was cooked perfectly and the turnips and mushrooms paired beautifully with the earthiness of the dish.

I initially dealt with Stefan to book the room and handle all the details related to that. The Bartlett room is on the 3rd floor of the restaurant. I loved that when we arrived, we were led to a back elevator instead of going through the restaurant to get to the room. The room is beautiful. Has an old speakeasy style with dark wood furniture, wine vaults, and soft lighting. Upon arrival I met Jen and Phil who were our dedicated wait staff. All I can say is they were both excellent. Jen immediately introduced herself and suggested my husband and I go to the 4th floor Whiskey Room to take pics as she thought it would make for wonderful photos and it did. Also, Jen made a nice little spot on one of the sofas for my 23 month old son to nap. They also got separate meals for the children who were in attendance and did not charge us the full price. The food was delicious. We ordered the fried chicken and tenderloin as the main entrees and both were a hit with out guests.

The burger features a large meaty firmly packed ground beef, perfectly medium rare.  The burger was juicy, succulent, with a hint of saltiness that perfectly complements the sweet roasted onion and smoked bacon flavor.  The generous portion did not dry out the meat, which tends to happen with larger burgers. The burger patty was so huge that the bun was barely able to keep it all together.  Absolutely delicious.\n\nBut as much as I enjoyed the burger, I was even more impressed with the organic fried chicken.  The chicken was unbelievably juicy inside and out.  What made it special, however, was the unique woody herbs flavor, which was infused with a fresh medley of rosemary, thyme and sage.  The flavor comes alive especially if you squeeze in the lemons on the side.  Perfectly warm, perfectly crispy, perfectly juicy, perfectly tangy.\n\nThe menu features a wide variety of upscale comfort food.  And Tyler apparently does not believe in foo-foo portions.  Only large big-boy heaping sized dishes here.  \n\nWhat decreases my enthusiasm are the ridiculously terrible fries.  They were hard as nails, overcooked, and very bland.  They were so bad to a point of being funny.  I thought about sending it back but I was too busy devouring the excellent burger.  Oh well, perhaps I just got a bad batch.

Not the best I've tasted, but it was good, especially with the layer of devil's food cake.  The slice was huge too!\n\nWill I be back?  Sadly, not anytime soon...", "author": "Janetto L."}

The steak tartare was rich and full of flavor. It was super amazing. The pountine was like a twist on chile cheese fries but with braised short ribs and mozzarella. It's hard to go wrong with fries.\n\nFor dinner, I had the fried chicken and my friend had the pot roast. My chicken was really good. Lightly battered and very juicy in the inside. I am pretty sure the chicken was soaked in buttermilk. Unlike most fried chicken, it didn't taste greasy at all. My friend's pot roast was okay. It taste like the same meat that was off the poutine. \n\nFor desert, we tried the popular sticky toffee pudding. The pudding was super sweet but all the ingredients complemented each other very well.\n\nOverall, the service was really good and food was very good. I will be back to try the rest of the menu.", "author": "Kien M."}

But I was hesitant about Wayfare Tavern even though Tyler Florence is one of my favorite Food Network chefs.  Overhyped places mean bigger disappointments. Nevertheless, the BF and I made reservations to dine here a month after the restaurant had opened. I was really excited but kept my expectations low at the same time.\n\nWhile waiting for the BF to arrive, I studied the restaurant. The d\u00e9cor was unexpected. It was a mixture of dark wood and contemporary pieces. The outcome was a welcoming space that looked like a modern saloon. The atmosphere was lively and casual. As I sat alone at the table, the server frequently checked on me. He kept my water glass filled and made conversation about the restaurant and the chef. I felt comfortable and was delighted to have such an energetic server. \n\nGrilled Monterey Bay Calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=sjAMzzpIRLauCw0aKiucMQ): Not many places offer grilled calamari and the one here was delicious. The simple ingredients of lemon, chili and garlic added to the flavor and the breadcrumb added to the texture. Loved!\n\nSalt Roasted Bone Marrow (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=piBIJuBBZzkP93vOb5v_-Q): This was my first time having bone marrow, so I had no idea what to expect. Given that I don't like eating fat and gelatin and the bone marrow reminded me of both, I tried to like it but couldn't. Nothing against the dish, but it's just not my thing.\n\nSmoked Pork Chop (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=J6cPhZ3N4R21HjvD-EESTQ): The pork chop was cooked to a perfect tenderness. The juice and sauce were fantastic. And the thick chunky almond puree was so good!\n\nWayfare Burger (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=0Qmgt5dONLvd-WeqBbDDOw): Even though it had cheese, bacon, onions and pickles, I can taste the natural flavor of the beef. It wasn't the best burger, but it was satisfying. Also enjoyed the fries.\n\nWe both enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere. I feel that the restaurant is a great addition to the area and will enjoy much success given its casual offerings and reasonable prices. As we headed downstairs to leave, I just had to see if the chef was here. Sure enough, Tyler Florence was going from table to kitchen greeting patrons and preparing dishes. He was busy when we approached the kitchen, but he saw us and walked out to greet us. He was so incredibly nice. He asked us about our meal, what we had and wholeheartedly thanked us for coming. He was unpretentious and his restaurant was a reflection of his character. Chef Florence and Wayfare Tavern, I wish you all the best!", "author": "Marti L."}

The middle market is sheer disappointment.\n\nI finally made it back three years later and while this place isn't exactly kitchen nightmares it's got a lot of shortcomings.\n\nAs I stated previously the fried chicken is not the best thing you will eat in your life. But I wanted to remember how good it was, so a few orders of that. Good, but it's just extra crispy fried organic chicken with oregano.\n\nOn the other hand, the salmon was completely inedible. It seemed like it was thawed out and sat around in water before cooking, which is not only immediately noticeable by the lack of shape and consistency in the inside flesh (think mashed potatoes) but dangerous from a consumption standpoint.\n\nIt wasn't even my salmon, but I wanted to sanity check my dining companions. NOPE. This is what the big cloth napkins are for. And just to be sure, the salmon was seared on the outside so this wasn't some fancy salmon pur\u00e9e I just didn't have the culture to stomach. Although I hope I have enough culture in my stomach to handle the bite (and not get food poisoning).\n\nSalmon goes back to the kitchen.\n\nOperationally, it looks like the kitchen was suffering. Ten minutes before a water pour. Over an hour from order to plating entrees. Bread that was so slow we had to ask for it (though the fresh dough, butter, and salt was probably the best part of the meal -- simpler times). Appetizers came somewhere in between and were alright. We had the unique vantage point of a table near the kitchen and there must have been three or four non-cooks standing around looking at something on the table. Their hard scrutiny didn't make us feel better.\n\nThe wait staff and atmosphere were (still) great. But the quality of food against the price just seemed unusually inappropriate tonight. I think Wayfare is having some issues around their process.", "author": "Christophe C."}

Two of us got there early and ordered drinks while we waited for the other two to arrive. At the time we arrived it was not crowded and we asked the hostess where to sit for drinks she pointed us to a table off to the side next to the window (so we weren't disrupting or in the way).\n\nOur third person showed up after we were waiting for about 45 minutes and she ordered a drink as well and we selected an appetizer to share (the mac and cheese which was not bad). We wanted to wait for our fourth to arrive before ordering main dishes. She had been held up, so the three of us were sitting and having our drinks when no less than 3 different servers from the one that originally started us off (and eventually a supervisor) kept coming up to us at different intervals trying to aggressively clear the table. They kept saying  \"you're done right\" \"I can take this (while grabbing for the plate)\" \"are you done\" not do you need anything/can I get you anything. This went on over the course of an hour. \n\nFinally our poor friend shows up and she's exhausted and just sits down  gets  to order a drink when someone who appears to be a supervisor (wearing suit jacket and a radio earpiece) comes up to us and dryly asks if we're waiting for anything. I did tell him actually yes my friend is waiting for her drink. So he says he'll go to check on it, about five minutes later he comes back and slams the drink down in front of her wordlessly and walks away.\n\nI'm not sure if it was because we were waiting too long or didn't order enough for their taste or because of our appearance (we weren't dressed super casually) but we were essentially railroaded into leaving. We were watching all the other tables too and no one else was being checked up on nearly as much as we were in that time span. ( From what I could see it wasn't even  crowded enough to warrant taking out a table to make room . I didn't see a line or anyone waiting) Counting it up,  staff had come to our table at least  8 times to see if we were done!!!\nI've never felt so unwelcome in an establishment before. \n\nSo overall-\nFood: decent\nDrinks: pretty good \nAtmostphere: nice, fairly casual there's a fair amount of people but it doesn't seem to get too noisy and seating was comfortable (until they try to kick you out of it)\nCustomer service: HORRIBLE (Major props to our first server though who was super sweet, frendly, and pleasant!

When we showed up, we had to wait to be seated (despite our reservation) and ended up spending the next 15 minutes laughing at all the white men congratulating themselves on being masters of the universe.

I'm very sensitive to salt, so of course I prefer no salt added. The salads are great, and the soup too. \n\nNow, why the 3 stars? The service seems 'off'. At first try, we were obviously ignored, because we were standing there like statues, just looked at by literally all the staff members for quite some time. We weren't dressed to please, and I guess we looked a bit too casual. However, I guess the staff thought better to cater to those who enter looking pristine and decorated head to toe with Chanel, Gucci, and I guess a little bling bling of the cartier watch, and sparkling shoes from Armani?\n\nAnyhow, finally I had to literally flag down someone, (and at this point I felt anyone, hell even if the cook came out for a micro second, I'd wave my hands for them to notice) to give us some sense that they cared that two people would continue to wait until seated. Both visits the same thing occurred. Every 'TYPE' of diner should be given equal attention.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I understand how sometimes people can make snap judgements and assume they can dismiss and ignore people who SEEM humbly 'bummy'... however, it's hugely disappointing and hurtful, to be treated with loose respect. \n\nRemember, treat everyone, no matter what they seem to be, as equals.", "author": "Hannah Y."}

Customer service to me can make or break your experience at a restaurant, even if the food is fantastic (which it was BTW).  The hostess was aloof and barely greeted us or said goodbye when we left.  First bad impression.  Then, our service was painfully slow.\n\nIt took the server almost 30 minutes to get our drinks on the table!  Second bad impression.  We didn't get our appetizer order in until 45 minutes and another hour went by before we had our dinner order in.  I think we were there for almost three hours overall, no exaggeration.  Now I love a good dinning experience and I enjoy taking my time through dinner (and that night my sister and her husband were in town, so we were enjoying their company), but this was just frustrating and not enjoyable at all--especially when you are hungry.  At least if we had some food and drinks to enjoy while we waited, it wouldn't be so bad.  Our server never even came back after we had our dinner delivered to see how everything was or to offer us drinks with our dinner when our glasses were empty (I had to flag him down).  I worked as a server for many years in restaurants, so I understand what a challenging job it can be, but I also understand the importance of providing good service to your patrons and our server did not.\n\nFood:  The food was excellent all around!  The burger is still one of the best; the handmade Tagliatelli pasta melted in your mouth; The grilled squid and Yellowtail sashimi appetizers were creative, beautifully presented, and so flavorful.  Oh, and the homemade donut desserts....to die for!  My only problem was with the appetizers--how can you charge $18 for an appetizer where you need a magnifying glass to even see the sashimi?  The portion sizes were ridiculously small, even for a fine dinning restaurant.  Between the four of us, we barely had a bite of each.\n\nPlease work on the service and hiring staff that takes pride in their work, the food they serve, and providing excellent customer service.

The food is very southern inspired. The interior is fancy, but classic.  It's perfect for a date night or for a girls night out.", "author": "Kari G."}

But ultimately, at the end of the meal, I didn't feel like I had a great enough experience to warrant the cost and the frenzy of fighting your way through the horde and getting a table!\n\nWe ordered the poutine, which was nothing particularly special. I had the butter lettuce salad, which didn't end up being very substantial or unique of a combination of ingredients (the acidic grapefruit didn't complement the softer flavor of butter lettuce; also didn't like the combination of textures). I also split the Butcher's Filet, which, despite the rich description of bone marrow and shallots, was not as decadent in flavor as we had hoped. My friend got the seared ahi tuna, which I tried - it tasted good, and had a nice, clean texture, but was not very original. \n\nOverall, no dramatic hits or misses, but I think this place is over-hyped, and not worth the hassle and money.", "author": "Amelia C."}

Highly recommended to show up with one.\n\nI needed a place to celebrate my anniversary dinner and ended up at Wayfare Tavern. To be honest, I picked Wayfare Tavern because I really wanted to try the PEACH PIE everybody was writing about ;)\n\nTurns out I didn't even order dessert because dinner was anticlimactic and I was ready to leave half way through. So sad.\n\nComplimentary POPOVERS were delicious!\n\nWe started with LOBSTER CORN CHOWDER $16. Our waiter was kind to split the soup in the kitchen for us. The lobster pieces are cooked and then assembled into the soup in front of you. The lobster pieces were cooked nicely. The soup was thicker than any chowder I've had, not a fan. Wouldn't order again.\n\nFor the main dish we ordered the FRIED CHICKEN $24 and BURGER (adding a fried egg) $21. The chicken was good though I'd argue not the best fried chicken I've ever had. Remember, this dish is $24 so it's fancier fried chicken, not the traditional fried chicken. I would order this again.\n\nI love me a good burger every now and again. I wouldn't order this one again though. I felt like this burger is worth $8, not $21. Very disappointed in this one. The bun was meh, meat wasn't anything special, and the flavor was also meh.\n\nWe also ordered the MAC & CHEESE $9 to go with our meal. It was okay.\n\nI couldn't really handle another pricey \"meh\" dish and having my hopes and expectations popped so I left without ordering dessert. I would say the best part of the meal might have to go to their popovers.\n\nSTAFF: Nice and courteous. Comes around just enough without feeling overwhelmed or ignored. Waiter brought over a plate of complimentary BROWNED BUTTER COOKIES for our anniversary. I would have ordered a box of these to take home if they were offered on the menu!\n\nOVERALL: I wouldn't suggest this as a place to go, but I would go if someone really wanted to.", "author": "Sunny W."}

I've heard Wayfare is good and wanted to give it a try since I work fairly close.  It's a fairly busy restaurant and you may have trouble  getting a table without a reservation.  As a solo diner, I haven't had much trouble getting a spot at the chef's counter.  \n\nI haven't been able to try much in the way of starters here.  I really want to try the Steak Tartare, and salads, and the Poutine which is off menu and rumored to be very good.  I tried the house favorite Cheeseburger, and the Rib Eye Steak with Duck Fat potatoes.  The burger was as good as it is rumored to be, with a thick slab of brie cheese, onion and bacon, served with fries.  Don't pass up on the popovers.  In fact have seconds.\n\nThe Rib Eye steak on the other hand was a rip off.  Almost $40 for small pieces of pre-sliced steak.  I was expecting at least a full steak.  The duck fat potatoes were good, but I still wanted more meat.  With this I ordered the Macaroni and Cheese, and I would swear there was bacon in it due to the smoked olive oil.  This was some of the best mac n cheese I've ever had.  A vegetarian would be concerned due to the smoky bacon flavor, but I don't think there's any meat in it.\n\nThe wine list looks good, many bottles from Napa Valley.  The wine list is a book, but thankfully I've only had a glass.  The cocktails are good, and the Barrel Aged Manhattan I usually get is good, but can be a bit too chilled.\n\nThe restaurant is a nice looking place with dark wood all over.  The service is good.  I like that you can pick up your leftovers at the host station.\n\nAll in all it's a good place, and want to go with others so I can try more of the menu.", "author": "Michael M."}

I enjoyed my meal and would recommend this place as a solid dinner spot, though I wouldn't necessarily go out of my way to come back again.\n\nFor a side, we ordered the baked mac & cheese. It was rich, creamy, and crisped on top -- not my usual favorite style of mac & cheese (I love less creamy, extra cheesy) but tasty nonetheless.\n\nFor my main, I had the chickpea & ricotta tortellini. The tomato-based sauce was really flavorful (maybe slightly too salty if I were critical) but it still made the dish. The tortellini itself was a little bland and the crunchy chickpeas gave an interesting texture. Overall, the dish was good but for the price isn't something I would jump to order again.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the homemade doughnuts, which were to die for.

I eat it every week, and some weeks, every day. I like it pretty much any way you can cook it, except for the soulless and dry skinless boneless chicken breast that is often served as a spongy, tasteless topping on dieter salads. \n\nI digress. The reason why I am talking about chicken is that I went to this restaurant primarily to try out the fried chicken that several Yelpers endorsed as \"the best I ever had.\" \n\nKids, you need to get out more. While not horrible, the fried chicken at Wayfare is a solid 2.5, not a 5. It lacks the requisite crunch, character and above all SALT required in a finger lickin' chicken offering. There are few things sadder than blowing out a week's worth of calories on lackluster food.\n\nAmbiance/Service+: I liked the decor, the background music play, and I thought the wait staff were well trained, attentive and professionally warm. Some of the better service I have received in San Francisco in restaurants of this category. Can recommend to out of town clients without any fear of hearing about snotty SF waitstaff the next day.\n\nIced tea++: Great! touch of lemon sorbet in the glass was lovely. Refilled the second I took a sip.\n\nPopovers++: These were very very good. Crunchy top, hot, well executed. \n\nFried chicken - ok, not worth 1000+ calories: Lots of it, served piping hot, not dry, not too greasy, and artistically presented. However, that brine needs a lot more salt and spice to make the chicken taste like anything. The crust was not really very crunchy either and was largely flavorless. Putting a pretty pile of salt and pepper on the side of the plate does not make up for missing salt in the brine and coating.\n\nShrimp cocktail+: Nice big shrimp, good cocktail sauce, attractive presentation\n\nOysters -: Good sauce, but oysters were heavily encrusted \"chicken fried oysters\", making it hard to appreciate the oyster taste. Could have been fried anything, sadly. \n\nMac and cheese - -: Seriously not good. Don't do it. Sauce appears cheesy, but doesn't taste like cheese! Breadcrumb topping is so heavily doused with strong olive oil that the dish tastes primarily of olive oil, which is not ideal for mac lovers. They use a weird shaped ear-like pasta, which wouldn't be bad it if wasn't so flaccidly cooked. Tyler, please revamp your mac and cheese recipe!! or go spank some cooks!\n\nThe best fried chicken in California (unless you have a great family recipe) is definitely at Ad Hoc or Addendum in Napa - save your calories for that occasion!!

Tyler Florence was pacing back and forth!  At the sight of him, people smiled including me...excited to meet him at the end of my meal!  (Even my mother decided to put on lipstick for when she meets him....ohh boy) That's what tv celebrities can do to you.  I got my hand shake from the chef and got to talk to him a bit in his kitchen.  That made my day already :)\n\nWe had reservations for 4 at 6:30pm.  We got there at around 6:20pm and was seated right away upstairs.  I wish we were seated near the kitchen to get a better view of the chef at work :P.  The decor was, like everyone else mentioned, masculine.  Very americanized but classy wooden decor with its velvety wallpaper.  The lighting was dim but not too dark to the point where you couldn't see your food.  It is a very compact restaurant.  Valet is available for $10 at the front but very practical since we are in the FiDi area where parking is unbearable.\n\nService: amazing and friendly.  We had many recommendations made for us and our waiter checked in quite frequently.  Good personality makes a great dinner for us.  If you want your food to go, they give you a numbered ticket so that when you are done and exiting, you give them your ticket and they hand deliver your to go food! I thought that was a clever idea!  This will prevent people from forgetting their food!  They refill your water literally like every 10 minutes also.  Woohoo!\n\nBread: EXCELLENT alternative.. Those popovers were so delicious and light.  I had to stop myself from getting more! http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BnHIoi2W5dbve772L8UgNA/l\n\nAppetizers+++++\n1. Salt Roasted Bone Marrow- http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/H92W2aWgzUfhijfxSwghSA/l My favorite appetizer hands down!  This came in a split bone filled with richness topped with parsley shallot salad.  The molasses butter on the bread was delicious.\n\n2. Grilled calamari- http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/BVdZEgk7a-kN5l12phYv0w/l Everyone else enjoyed this appetizer.  I am more of a fan of fried calamari than grilled in general!  Not bad though! The lemon, chives, and breadcrumbs gave it a good kick.\n\nEntrees+++++\n1. Organic Fried Chicken-  http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/FDUm4OoSR5pG9roGBtnhRg/l The herbs cooked with the fried chicken gives it such a different and delicious taste compared to other fried chickens.  Definitely a light fried batter to a tasty dark meat chicken served.  Thighs and breasts are served with the sides of lemon to sprinkle your chicken and roasted garlic with crispy herbs.  A big fan of his famous chicken shown on TV!\n\n2. Crispy Pacific Halibut- http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bP8QWmyibLjVobumxaZiZQ/l I like Mr. Florence's flavors of lemon, garlic, chili and farro used on this fish.  I didn't get to taste MUCH of it.\n\n3. Hangtown Fry- My least favorite.  I kind of felt like I was eating a breakfast meal that had too much.  Thank god this wasn't my entree of choice. Supposedly a dead's man last meal.. maybe a little too much!  It came with petaluma eggs, crispy oysters, smoked bacon, and watercress.  Definitely will stuff you until you want to pass out with the amount that they give you.\n\n3. Smoked Pork Chop- http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Z33YQSjrE-sHC8PTJ7dufw/lwe were worried that it would turn out dry like most restaurants.  But he proved us wrong! The almond butter and puree to compliment the pork chop slices was an EXCELLENT addition.  It gave it a unique flavor that I would order this plate, hands down again!\n\nSide Dishes+++++\n1. Baked Mac 'n Cheese- http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/cF3BRUaBZbmqojG5XY5LIg/l Not as good as I thought it would be.  A bit too rich and it could of had the mac 'n cheese flavor more.  I tasted the cream richness to it more than anything.  At least the garlic breadcrumbs gave it a little more taste!\n\n2. Creamed corn- http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Bx7gv04_37hh8fbQkmyJWQ/l Hands down my favorite side dish.  I like the crisp to the corn and how not heavy this was.  Best creamed corn I tasted yet!  Cooked with olive oil and chives!\n\n3. Roasted Asparagus- cooked in olive oil and sprinkled with salt and pepper.  Good vegetable addition to your meal. It was a little too much salt though.....\n\nDesserts+++++\n1. Pineapple Upside down cake- http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/GRykZo_Jd8Iz6t0xIWI5mQ/l This was the first time I had this kind of cake.  It was my favorite one.  A bit more on the sweeter side so if they can lessen it, it would be perfect.  I liked the combination of the pinneaple with the caramelized ice cream on top.  The macadamia nut brittle pieces was an excellent addition to it.\n\n2. Peach pie-  http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W6L8_O86IiobQ0Ulm_Mbyg/l I like how light and crisp the pie crust was.  It didn't quite taste like peach to me.. Maybe the way you make the pie just makes me feel like everything tasted like apples. \n\nOverall, GREAT experience!", "author": "Kathy D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-27", "description": "Sadly, not as mind blowing as the first time...\n\nAfter our first visit at Wayfare Tavern, my friend was so blown away that he decided to have his Birthday Dinner here.\n\nLast night, my friends and I arrived at 8:08 PM for our 8:15 PM reservations. As expected, WT was PACKED, so we weren't seated until 8:40 PM. \n\nFOOD/DRINKS:\n*2002 Corizon Cabernet ($17/glass): Smooth w/ cherry, plum and floral notes.\n\n*2008 Seghesio Zinfandel ($13/glass): The Seghesio was exceptionally smooth w/ a robust berry flavor and no acidic after taste.\n\n*Steak Tartar: See my previous review.\n\n*Bone Marrow: See my previous review.\n\n*Half Dozen Raw Oysters ($15): Good! The oysters were fresh, tender and sweet w/ a hint of the fresh ocean. The lemon mignonette sauce added just the right amount of citrus tang while the cocktail sauce added a sweet tang. \n\n*Foie Gras ($16): Perfection! The generous slab of foie gras was served on top of grilled sourdough bread alongside roasted plums. As I bit into it, I got a slight crunch from the bread followed an explosion of rich fatty goodness which was offset by the tender tart plums.\n\n*California Avocado & Hearts of Palm ($10): Sadly, WF will NO longer have the much-loved Baked Avocado w/ Dungeness Crab. This app is the replacement for it. It's a very rich, yet refreshing dish, but of course not as decadent. The perfectly ripen avocados are buttery soft and the hearts of palm had a slight crunch and mild nutty flavor. The vinaigrette brought the dish together by adding a citrusy tang to balance the richness from avocados. \n\n*Uni w/ Sweet Corn Puree ($18): Disappointing. The uni had a pungent and bitter taste and the corn puree was bland. The citrus herby tang from the chervil vinaigrette did help cover some of the bitterness from the uni though. \n\n*Grilled Calamari ($10): Another disappointment. Although the calamari was tender, all the flavor was masked by the burnt garlic which left a very unappetizing bitterness in my mouth.\n\n*Creamed Corn ($8): Meh! The corn didn't have a sweet flavor as one would expect white corn to have, but even worse it tasted raw. In addition, it lacked the most important thing to for it to be called \"creamed\" corn...creaminess. \n\n*Grilled Asparagus ($8): Inedible! We had to send back the asparagus b/c it was overly salted. They did bring back a new unseasoned batch of asparagus which was tender, but lacked an al-dente crunch. \n\n*Steak and Eggs ($25): AMAZING! You know how some things are beyond what words can describe? This Steak and Egg dish is a perfect example. \n\nThe filet mignon was topped w/ dungeness crab, soft boiled egg and a b\u00e9arnaise sauce. The filet was perfectly cooked to a medium rare and was tender, moist, and juicy. The creamy b\u00e9arnaise sauce complemented the steak well by adding a rich and savoryness w/ a touch of a peppery lemon flavor. The egg heighted the richness w/ the creaminess from the runny yolk, while the tender crab added a dash of sweetness and the fried shallots added a nice crunch. \n\nIt may seem like a complex dish w/ all the different ingredients but they worked in harmony w/ one another. It was so effen good, that's going on my Yelp profile of \"My Last Meal on Earth\"!   \n\n*Chocolate Story Sundae ($8): For Chocolate Lover's only! The TCHO chocolate ice cream was rich, creamy and chocolately, but not too sweet. The cookie crumbles and rice crisp balls added a nice crunch and an additional layer of chocolately goodness.  \n\n*Peach Pie: Every bit as good as the first time. See my first review for details. \n\nSERVICE:\nOur server Josh was very friendly, knowledgeable about the menu and gave good recommendations. However, service is slow which is too be expected b/c of the hype of WT. If you're an impatient person, you should wait until the hype dies down b/c a sit down dinner will take 2.5-3 hours. \n\nAMBIANCE:\nSee my previous review for details. However, one thing to note is where you are seated can dramatically change your dining experience. On our first visit, we sat upstairs which was less chaotic. Last night, we sat downstairs. Although I got a bird-eye's view of Tyler in the kitchen (he's STILL as HOT as the first time I saw him), it was unbearably LOUD! I spent the whole night saying, \"HUH? SAY THAT AGAIN?\" and then screaming across the table; yet my words were discombobulated. So, if you want to have a more manageable conversation, request to sit upstairs.\n\nKeeping in mind that w/ most things in life, the second time around can't be as good as the first, it was very disappointing that dishes like the highly praised calamari and simple dishes like creamed corn and grilled asparagus was not only executed poorly, but almost inedible. So sadly, I have to drop 1 Star. HOWEVER, WF is still on my list of Top SF Restaurants b/c it still has a lot of unique stand-out dishes and will come highly recommended to my friends and family!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

They were right, and within 15 minutes, we were able to sit together near the bar.\n\nBy that point, we had all switched to whiskey, but I was somehow able to order for everyone.  We had: fried chicken, burgers, mac n cheese, poutine, broccolini, fries and a couple of salads. Everything was tasty, but the poutine and mac n cheese were finished first.

Seats were comfy (leather), food was delicious (lots of butter), and service the wine was excellent.  We had a party of six and it was a little cramped, but we enjoyed ourselves nonetheless as the wine was flowing...nonstop. :)\n\nWe tried every single oyster on the \"raw bar\" and our faves were the salty/saline tasting ones.  How embarrassing that I don't remember the name of the oyster...it was either the Hammersley or the Blue Point.  Thank goodness the staff is extremely knowledgeable about the items they serve so just ask for the saltier ones (stay away from the cucumber flavored one unless you like fresh ocean/fishy taste!).\n\nWe also had the burrata , deviled eggs, mussels, and poutine.  Of those starters BURRATA and POUTINE are a must!!  C'mon, oxtail gravy and cheese over fries?  OMG so good.\n\nFor my entree I had the la quercia prosciutto and brie sando which was waaaay too buttery for my liking. It's an open-faced sandwich, but I mean they top it off with a glob of butter the size of a golf ball.  If I'd eaten the entirety of the sandwich I'm certain cardiac arrest would follow shortly.  Tried my co-worker's organic fried chicken and it was really good too.\n\nWhen I return, I'm getting the Crab Louie or the Fried Chicken.", "author": "Dee H."}

While the restaurant is upscale it is a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere for dinner, albeit a tad loud. \n\nThe octopus appetizer was the best order of the evening. The combination of the chorizo, beans, basil and the perfectly grilled octopus was delicious and unexpected. The corn soup was fine and tasted like liquid corn on the cob so go for it if you are a true corn lover as it certainly has a concentrated flavor. The beef tartare was very good and well seasoned with horseradish and served perfectly with toasty seasoned popover wedges. Speaking of which, the popovers really are a lovely and yummy perk of Wayfare. We even were given a box to go as a parting gift!\n\nThe Wafyare burger was very juicy, flavorful and served beautifully on a brioche bun which absorbs all the extra juices and the runny yolk from the fried egg we added on top. Messy but worth it. Family who shared a bite said it was the best burger they had ever had. \n\nOur waiter was very nice and helpful though not as attentive as we would have liked. Had to flag him down for assistance. Took a while for our food to come. It was just a long enough wait that we all started checking watches and looking around, but not long enough that we felt a need to complain. \n\nWould recommend to anyone in SF looking for good American fare in a comfortable and relaxed yet upscale setting.", "author": "Emily Z."}

I couldn't watch him on T.V, I put his cookbooks away and I didn't make any of our favorite Tyler dishes at home--I was really on strike. Call me crazy but it was what it was. \n\nI knew deep down that my strike wouldn't last because i'm terrible with holding grudges and my husband and I love Tyler Florence. And I even got a little nudge after reading my yelp friends Genevieve Y's and Jennifer C P's reviews so I knew it wouldn't be too long before I was over it. = )\n\nA month after that visit, i'm back in the city for business. I had a free afternoon so I decided to steal my sister from her studies and treat her to a nice lunch at Wayfare Tavern. I've read mixed reviews so I was anxious to see how it would all play out.  For the two of us, we ordered:\n\n--Steak Tartare -- Holy moly! This is to die for... hands down, my favorite dish.\n\n--Baked avacado with dungeness crab and smoked bacon -- TASTY! shhhh - I'm going to steal this presentation from him. \n\n--Steak and Eggs - just ok. It was recommended by our awesome waiter but it didn't wow us. \n\n--Fried Chicken - we wanted wow and this dish was all that and more!  It lived up to its great reputation. Definitely get this - you wont' be disappointed! \n\n--Baked macaroni and cheese -- unfortunately, this dish never made it to our table but our waiter was very, very apologetic.  I was bummed because everyone says great things about it.  I will have to come back and give this dish a try.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the chocolate cupcake. I was so full, I thought I was going to just take a bite but it was so good, I ended up taking a couple. = ) The little \"sprinkles\" on top were a great topping addition.\n\nThe food, staff and everything was fantastic.  But the best part was when Chef came to our table and thanked us for coming in. Our main entrees just arrived at the table and he took the lemon and gave the fried chicken a fresh squeeze. It was so awesome for him to give it that table-side personal touch. I usually don't get star struck but with Tyler's presence, if you asked me my name, I wouldn't have known it. We had a quick photo opp with him and it just made our day. \n\nThank you Tyler for coming to our table and personalizing our experience.  I just arrived home from SF and I put your cookbooks back out on our shelf. Welcome back!", "author": "Sharon V."}

Chef Tyler Florence has created some wonderful dishes, but to be honest the majority of the dishes are good, not great.  However, the dishes that truly stand out are enough reason for me to make the journey up from LA.\n\nHere are my reasons for loving Wayfare Tavern:\n\n1. Popover:  These are simply amazing.  Light, fluffy, delicious by themselves.\n\n2. Kobe Tartare: This dish blew my mind.  It was one of the best things i have ever eaten.  Served with an egg yolk along with a popover with a cilantro and pesto aioli?  Seriously delicious.  This dish made it to my \"if I were to die tomorrow\" list of foods i'd eat.\n\n3. Poutine: Holy moly.  Explosion of great flavors in every bite.  Who knew you could do so much with beef and potatoes?  It was a perfect balance of salty and creamy and nearly brought tears to my eyes.  Especially delicious with the popover.\n\nThe rest of the meal included a mushroom ravioli, a dish of string beans, both which were mediocre.  I wish I could write more but the experience and food were both unbelievable.  There are too many high end restaurants now that push for the ultimate culinary experience, but when you have access to the best ingredients, it becomes fairly easy to flood a dish with too many flavors.  While I feel some of the dishes are guilty of being a bit overly pretentious, everything was good and a few of the dishes simply shined.\n\nThe staff was well informed and explained every dish to great extent.  Wayfare Tavern is well worth the trip and my only regret is that it's based in SF.  I will be back soon, you can count on that!", "author": "Allen C."}

Parking was easy but expensive, there's a lot one block away, cost us $15. \n\nWe ordered the Kobe Tartar and the Poutine for appetizer. The Tartar was excellent. The Poutine was rich, a little too rich actually. I wish I had ordered the Hamachi appetizer instead.\n\nThen we shared an order of Fried Chicken and Macaroni & Cheese. All the other Yelp reviews raved about the fried chicken... that's actually why we chose this place. It was no joke awesome. One of the best fried chicken I have had. I loved the fried herbs thrown on top, thyme, sage, rosemary... and also all through out the chicken. It was super moist inside and a nice light crunchy on the outside. The Mac & Cheese was decadent, I loved it. \n\nThe service was excellent, our waitress was nice and super attentive. \n\nWe could barely walk back to the car and did not eat the rest of the day!

I wouldn't say it was the \"best\" I've ever had, but it wasn't bad. We were there on a hot day (90 degrees in San Francisco) so the restaurant with no a/c was a bit on the warm side. We had sides of a small tomatoe and cheese salad and the mac and cheese which again were good but not exceptional. The best part of the meal to me was the bread which was a warm popover. Very tasty. The ambiance was perfect for what I was looking for... nice bar type feeling, not overly elegant but definitely not a dive. I will give it another try in the future.

We didn't have plans for lunch and someone suggested this place for Mac & Cheese. My first thought was, okay, I wouldn't mind a good simple lunch.\n\nThen, I looked up the place on Yelp and found out it was owned by Chef Tyler Florence. I also learned that it was one of the top 5 places to eat for comfort food, and the cost to dine was in the $$$ range. Needless to say my expectations increased exponentially from a simple meal to, \"damn, this is going to be good!\"\n\nIt went down hill from there.\n\nSince I was there for business, I thought I would order the ravioli mainly because it was easy to eat. We were told by the waiter that the chef decided to replace the ravioli with a fettuccine with mushrooms. I decided to go with it and also order the mac & cheese. \n\nBy the way, the mac & cheese is a side order.\n\nThe fettuccine tasted okay and had mushrooms, grilled corn, and okra. It was an interesting combination and the flavors and textures worked with each other. The pasta was clearly hand made but this was the part that was most disappointing. The pasta was clumped together. I'm not a cooking expert but I do not when certain basic things need to be executed well. \n\nThat's one of them.\n\nSo, I thought, okay let's try the mac & cheese. It was actually good but I wasn't blown away as I had hoped. It is a very rich dish.  Finally, we were seated in one of two high tops right by the stairs near the entrance and the bar. The sun was shining at just the perfect angle to see the dust every time people would go up and down the stairs. \n\nOverall, it was a disappointing lunch for such a highly rated restaurant.", "author": "Roehl A."}

My boyfriend and I were attended to right away and our server was incredible. \n\nThe drinks were ok, but I wasn't particularly into mine.\n\nTo start, we split a salad which were of course accompanied by the infamous popovers (hot and flaky!). Our entrees (fried chicken and American picnic) were both great. I also had the whipped potatoes and seasonal veggies as sides (they were assorted fresh summer beans). My chicken was a bit too pink in the middle on my thigh portion, but that was quickly remedied. I would've liked more breast portion and less dark meat, but that's just my preference--everything tasted delicious. He had the picnic, which consisted of ribs, corn bread and a potato salad. \n\nMy favorite part, and in my opinion, the real test of a restaurant is the dessert. I had heard great things about their peach pie but they also offered churros with brown butter ice cream (!!!!!), an assortment of carnival treats like licorice and popcorn flavored ice cream as well as chocolate cream pie. I had a hard time picking one, so I ordered the two pies (cream and peach) for us to share. We both agreed the peach pie was just ok, but the chocolate cream pie was heavenly. I've never had such a rich piece of pie! I almost want to come back just to sample their other desserts.\n\nThe service here is second to none. We didn't have to wait for anything. My leftovers were packaged and sent downstairs to wait with me and the front desk (nice touch!). At the end of our meal, our server brought us fresh/warm cookies as a treat. Those cookies were excellent. I almost wish I could have ordered them with ice cream as a dessert instead of the peach pie.\n\nThe theme of this place is a hit and I like that there are separate floors.

I finally got to try it out last night.\n\nI was in a bigger group (7 people total) for a belated holiday party.  I met up with a couple people about 20 minutes before dinner for a glass of wine at the bar.  I love the atmosphere of the place.   \n\nWe were seated upstairs in the billiard room.  We ordered some sides to share.  We had the deviled eggs, poutine, and a broccoli dish.  All was very tasty, and the Canadian in the group ate a lot of the poutine, so it must have been the real deal.  Somehow the broccoli disappeared before it was passed around, so it must have been very good to someone.\n\nWe all had the fried chicken.  Every one of us.  It was delicious.  Here's a helpful tip: you can request parts of the bird.  I didn't have a clue.  I didn't want to do that, because, well, that's what you do at KFC and I thought I'd make a scene.  The chicken was awesome.  The breading was just right and it was juicy.  \n\nFor dessert, I had the chocolate creme pie.  One of my friends had the citrus tart thingy.  They were both really, really good.  The citrus tart had a pine nut graham crust that made me consider ordering two desserts, especially since i wasn't paying.  \n\nThe reason I didn't give it 5 stars, was that the service was a little odd the night we went.  They forgot napkins (we had silverware).  Also, they forgot the serving spoons for some of the shared dishes.  During dessert three people ordered the citrus tart, and we got a platter with three tarts on it.  The people that ordered the tarts weren't sitting close together, so we had to ask for individual plates and wait to have them plated.  It was just a little odd, everything else was spot on and made this a fun night out.", "author": "Rob R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-06", "description": "During our most recent trip to the Bay Area, we decided to do a dinner at Wayfare Tavern with our usual dining companions (Ruben's cousin and his cousin's wife). It's been on my list for some time and I'm a fan of Tyler Florence as well. I made reservations via Open Table approximately 2-3 months in advance since I heard it was difficult to acquire a table. The process was very simple though. When we arrived, we were fortunate with parking as we were able to find a spot on the same block of Sacramento. There is also valet parking available for $10.\n\nThe restaurant is in a gorgeous rustic building with Trans-America in the backdrop. The ambiance is lively, communal, and just the right amount of fancy. The dress is casual, so you don't have to worry about wearing appropriate garb while exploring the city. The space is a bit tight in the dining area, so you may be very close to your neighbors. We were fortunate with a table along the private dining room next to a window facing Sacramento. Service was wonderful and prompt. Our water glasses were never less than half full. We also enjoyed fresh and warm popovers with black salt butter before our meal.\n\nAvocado & Hearts of Palm Salad ($13): Cucumber, red onion, micro cilantro, and honey lime dressing. Fresh and creamy avocado paired nicely with the other flavors; I really enjoyed this dish!\nAmerican Kobe Tartare ($16): Fresh chopped beef, French mustard dressing, topped with egg yolk, celery leaves, and crispy celery strips, and garlic popovers. The beef was nice, but I didn't enjoy the flavors. It had an almost sour/tart taste to it that wasn't pleasant for me.\nWayfare Tavern Deviled Eggs ($14): Pimenton brined, pickled mustard seed, and shaved celery. This is one of their signature starters that TF has spent a lot of time perfecting. Initially, it didn't wow me like I expected it would, however, with each additional bite, it was clearly the creamiest and most flavorful deviled eggs I've ever had. So, although it didn't strike me as amazing, I would still order it again.\n\nOrganic Fried Chicken ($25): buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herbs, lemon, and S&P. This was everything I thought it would be and more! It surprisingly lived up to the hype! The chicken is tender and the batter/skin was crispy and flavorful. I loved the addition of fresh lemon juice and a little extra S&P. The meat was seriously falling off the bones and the breast was the juiciest we've ever experienced. Amazing and easily our favorite dish of the evening! \nPan Seared Skuna Bay Scallops ($33): Spring pea pur\u00e9e, papas bravas, pimenton aioli, and sorrel. The scallops were very tender and the pur\u00e9e was nice.\nHoliday Special - Prime Rib Eye Steak ($48): Organic 12 oz., Brussels sprout chips, chanterelle mushrooms, Bing cherries, and roasted beet demi glac\u00e9 with Dijon mustard. Daisy and I both chose the special and the guys really enjoyed them. The steak was decent, but I didn't like the sweetness of the demi glac\u00e9.\nWe ordered two sides for our chicken: Grilled Broccolini ($9) and French Fried Kennebec Potatoes ($7). Neither were particularly special, but good.\n\nChocolate Cream Pie ($11): TCHO chocolate pudding, salty caramel ganache, and devils food cake. This was so, so good! The crust was really nice, the pudding was thick, and overall the pie wasn't too sweet. One of the best chocolate desserts I've had.\nStrawberry Shortcake ($11): Muscovado sponge cake, Creme Fra\u00eeche ice cream, fresh strawberries, strawberry gel\u00e9e, and edible flowers. I didn't like the texture of the cake and it was almost as if it was dry, however, the Creme Fra\u00eeche ice cream and other strawberry elements, especially the gel\u00e9e, were great. Ruben absolutely loved it!\nCherry Lime Ice Cream ($8): All their ice creams and sorbets are made in-house and the flavors vary with great combinations. This flavor pleasantly tasted like Key Lime Pie with just a hint of cherry, but was a bit too tart for any of us to fully enjoy.\n\nGreat meal with notable highlights. The fried chicken is definitely worth the visit! I was surprised to not enjoy the tartare and steak, but nothing was terrible enough to ruin the evening. Oh, and we received mini salted caramel brownies with our check. Adorable and tasty. Ultimately, I recommend a visit!", "author": "Amelinda L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-15", "description": "***Wayfare Tavern utilizes very familiar dishes but adds nice touches here and there; this approach combined with the restaurant's good atmosphere should please a wide range of customers***\n\nWayfare Tavern is Tyler Florence's upscale rustic restaurant that is located in the SF Financial District.  The restaurant has a great d\u00e9cor.  The restaurant feels contemporary, but it also reminds me of the big city upscale pubs I used to see in movies as a kid.  The room utilizes mostly dark colors, but there is also a lot of natural light from the big windows.\n\nThe ceilings are high too, which allow for a great bar with bottles of alcohol stored in shelves--3 to 4 shelves high.  There is a second floor, which is good since the first floor does not have much seating--it is a narrow room that feels intimate and just right.  Some of the bar seating also allows for a great view of the open kitchen (where you will quickly discover that some dishes here are very popular--burger, fried chicken, ahi tuna salad, and beef tartare).\n\nThe menu does seem to fit with the d\u00e9cor.  The d\u00e9cor is casual and tavern-ish, but there is definitely an upscale element to it.  The same goes for the food--familiar but also with an upscale flair.  They serve deviled eggs, but they are topped with crispy shrimp.  The burger comes with Brie.  Their pasta is topped with wild mushrooms and a soft egg.\n\nThe kitchen at Wayfare Tavern seems to take the rustic food seriously and it starts with their complimentary popovers.  Popovers are not that common (you can find them at BLT Steak in LA).  The ones at Wayfare Tavern are not as good as BLT Steak, but they are still a great complimentary starter.  The outside of the popover was nice and crisp and they were light and airy on the inside (and addictively warm).  I wish they were a little less buttery/greasy on the outside.\n\nI started with their Kobe beef tartare and it was good.  The raw chopped beef was mixed with French mustard dressing, crispy onions, capers, and an egg yolk.  The tartare had a very good flavor--nice tang from the mustard and the beef was moist and fresh.  I was not a huge fan of how they chopped the beef--it felt a little too ground beef to me.  I also thought the portion was actually too big.  I would have preferred something smaller and less expensive.\n\nThe tartare was served with a warm and sliced popover.\n\nFor my main course, I had the ahi tuna carpaccio and it was like a tuna nicoise salad.  The base of the plate consisted of ahi tuna sashimi.  The sashimi was topped with greens, sun dried tomatoes, olives, petit potatoes, a soft boiled egg, aioli, haricot verts, and anchovies.\n\nI thought the toppings were great.  I liked the potatoes and the haricot verts.  I also really liked the soft boiled egg, which had a creamy and rich egg yolk.  The sun dried tomatoes were good as were the anchovies.  At times, the salad felt a little overdressed--too vinegary and maybe too briny from the preserved elements like the olives, but it was still a good dish (with not many overpowering flavors).\n\nThe ahi tuna itself was moist enough, but it was definitely not as fresh and soft as tuna you would find at other places.  In the end, the tuna was okay, but it was not a standout.\n\nFor dessert, I went with the burnt goat cheese panna cotta, which was topped with coriander blossoms and walnut pavlova, which was like a crispy meringue.  The panna cotta came with a side of smoked honey ice cream.  The panna cotta itself was very creamy and smooth.  It was also quite tangy and sour from the goat cheese.\n\nThe panna cotta could have used something sweet.  The pavlova provided a great crispy texture, but it was very light in flavor.  The smoked honey ice cream was good.  It was lightly sweet and very smooth, creamy and dense.  I think they should have maybe topped the panna cotta with the ice cream or something because the dessert definitely needed a sweet element.\n\nService was very good.  My server was efficient, attentive, friendly, funny, polite, and seemed like a perfect fit for the restaurant.\n\nWayfare Tavern is a casual spot, but it is still very upscale so you can expect higher prices than your run of the mill lunch spot (though they do have several entrees just below $20).  That being said, portion sizes on many of the entrees are more than generous and you probably do not need to order a starter.\n\nWayfare Tavern is a good lunch spot that combines a good atmosphere with well prepared food and strong service.  While none of the food I had was amazing, all of it was satisfying and I think Wayfare Tavern is worth considering if you are looking for a good and substantial lunch (also, the familiarity of many of the dishes combined with the more refined touches could probably please a wide range of people).\n\nParking in this area is difficult; there are paid structures and lots nearby.", "author": "Anthony N."}

Living in the City I go for special occasions, but it has been slipping in service and quality and I WON'T BE BACK. My most recent trip was a disaster. Reservations at 5:30 for 7 (some from Australia). We were seated in a booth on the main level with one person forced to sit at the end in a chair in the walkway, constantly having to move her chair so people could get by. We were next to the kitchen and busing station and it was a nightmare. Our waiter was cranky from the minute we sat down. After about 20 minutes he took our drink/appetizer orders and they came in relative short-order. TWO HOURS LATER when we still didn't have our entrees, our waiter said the \"kitchen was busy with big orders\". Mind you, the booth next to us turned over twice in this time period. I went to the manager to complain. Waiter brought us a \"watermelon salad to share while we waited\". This consisted of four chunks of watermelon for the table of 7 to share. Two and a half hours *SOME* of us received our meal. They forgot to put in the order for the guest shoved at the end of the table. She sat without food while we ate. They finally brought her meal about 15 minutes later. They comped her meal and the appetizers, but the bill was still over $225. I ordered scallops and they were way too salty; two people ordered gnocchi and neither finished. I was really embarrassed that I took people to this restaurant. The kitchen and wait staff need to be replaced, as does the management. If the restaurant continues this spiral downward it won't remain in business much longer.

If you are on a diet or don't want heavy foods, you're just going to have to break down and chow down.  It's well worth it.\n\nTry to get a seat at the chef's table so you can see all your wonderful dishes being created.  They start you out with fresh popovers (basically Yorkshire pudding), and the goodness continues throughout the whole meal.  Standouts include deviled eggs (very happy NM shared his with me) and lamb poutine (seriously, this is amazing).", "author": "Chris C."}

How wrong was I, where do I begin!   The dry pop overs just throw me, traditionally  these are served ( in England ) with a roast dinner but historically were served as a starter with gravy, that aside I can forgive as the were beautifully made.   The stater, I had the smoke salmon and my husband had the beef tartare both both uninspiring but okay.  Now for the main course.  I would have hope that there would have been more on the menu.  I had the fried chicken my husband had the belly pork minus the gigante beans ( he's diabetic so couldn't eat the beans) at no point was he offered a substitute and was literally served two pieces of pork on a starter plate.   For pudding I had the strawberry cobbler. This was dry and looked like it had been cooked the night before. My husband had the chocolate mouse which was served with what appeared to be cold bits of pasty thrown in at the last minute.   He had one glass of wine with his meal.   \n\nThe service was very good but for $173.00 I expect s whole lot more.  Sorry Tyler, I respect you as a chef and business man but yesterday I felt robbed", "author": "Jeanette B."}

Their cocktail menu is fun and I have never had a drink that wasn't delicious.  Just depends on what your poison is. \nHere are a few of my favorites when I come here:\n\nAmerican Kobe Tartare - The beef is so tender and their seasoning of french mustard, garlic powder, and egg is a perfect combination. Served with their chips this is great appetizer.\n\nWayfare Deviled Eggs - (Only on their Lunch Menu) these are dressed and seasoned well.\n\nPoutine - Essentially this is potatoes with mozzarella curd and fried kale. It is actually more delicious than it sounds.\n\nNew Bedford Scallops - Cooked to perfection and oh so good\n\nOrganic Fried Chicken - This is one of their staple dishes. It's breaded and seasoned perfection with the perfect crispiness.\n\nCharred Broccolini - Not overcooked and goes well with the fried chicken\n\nBakes Macaroni and Cheese - What more can I say, it's Mac and Cheese, and oh so good.\n\nDesserts: We had the doughnuts and Chocolate cream pie! WOWZERS, these were so sweet and very good.\n\nOverall, the food is awesome, the drinks are stiff and refreshing, and the staff is friendly and on point.

It's in a great location in the financial district close to Fisherman's Wharf and the Ferry Building.\n\nThe space is divided into a few areas - the downstairs booths, the bar where you can watch the kitchen activities, and the upstairs seating. Service is attentive and prompt. I made a reservation 6 weeks in advance and was immediately seated upon checkin. I did notice a small cluster of guests waiting to be seating in the lobby.\n\nItem that's a must try on the menu: FRIED CHICKEN. Seriously. Don't walk out of Wayfare Tavern without trying the fried chicken. It has independently changed the way I rate fried chicken from other places. Really good.\n\nThe popovers are perfection. Fresh, warm, airy, and delicious. They were the perfect companion to the Kobe Tartare, which was also impressive. We also ordered the Burrata, and Black Cod. The entrees were outstanding. \n\nAlso very impressive was the attention we got from the management.

It's nice to be able to sit outside (their tables are now much better) after work with a refreshing drink and some Beef Tartare and Deviled Eggs. Both are must tries if you're into that sort of thing. For lunch or dinner, they also have a good selection of raw oysters and the Fried Chicken with a spritz of lemon is pretty amazing. For whatever reason, the lemon adds a little something. On my visit this week, we surprisingly were able to grab a last minute reservation minutes before 11:30am so we went for a not so quick lunch. It's so cozy downstairs seated by the fire and the place overall is decorated very nicely. I had the daily special of Scallops over Black Eyed Peas and it was superb. One friend had the Chicken Salad Sandwich and it was supposedly as delicious as it looked. The Cuban Sandwich that passed us was highly recommended and it looked impressive. It's a new addition to the menu and I will have to take my hubby back so he can give it a try. My other friend had a Salad with the daily Fish and the Fish was served separately which we were pleasantly surprised with. That also looked great and everything was prepared well. The service is attentive enough though they always want to clear your bread plate before serving your entree even if you have bread on it. I've been to a few large parties in the private room for lunch and the service and food during those times was great too so if you can afford it, their private room is very nice.", "author": "Jen L."}

Ok, truthfully, we waited more than a bit, & my man was gettin agitated; but once the food arrived it was all good.  Actually, it was all outstanding.  The organic fried chicken.

It had been featured in F&W magazine, & I had been REALLY looking forward to trying it.  Sigh.  Fortunately I didn't hold a grudge, cuz the fried chix/mac & cheese/donut combo was effin amazing.

The location brings back a sour memory though. Yes, Rubicon. A fine restaurant but let me explain. So I came out to SF from DC in the late 90s to seek my fortune, though I already had some fame. On the way out my new car was on one of those car hauler trucks and when I went to pick it up in Fremont the man said to me. O, you are Mr. Black, did you know what happened to your car. No I replied. O, it was in an accident. OMG, the hood was smashed. That is incident #1. Then upon entering my new house a few weeks later after the hood was fixed the sliding gate smashed into the door of this then new car. Weeks later, I went to Rubicon and handed the key to the valet. Upon leaving after a good dinner I went to retrieve my car from the Valet. O, you are Mr. Black, Did they not tell you that your car was towed. Say what!!!. Yes. I know. Hours later I got my car back and had to deal with the Rubicon management for months for the money they owed me.\n\nNow for Wayfare. The place was packed with some locals and tourist on a Tuesday evening but they found a seat for me at the kitchen counter. Let me say it was a very tight fit and not comfortable. I usually like sitting at the kitchen counter but in this place the non TV bar has way more room and the stools are not meant for Willie Shoemaker. No matter. The wonderful waiter took my order. Then up popped this wonderful warm turnover. Not quite as food as the BLT Restaurant turnovers in NYC but close. My tiny iffy martini then arrived. Soon after I had the prime rib tartare. Wow. Huge portion, that should be shared. Wonderful. I then had the to die for fried chicken, which again was a huge plate of food with no sides but you didn't need that to fill up, that's for sure. Just amazing though I needed a sauce to go with it and the waiter came out with a few options. I ordered great though looking around I saw a few things. The burger looked amazing and I heard that exact comment from a eater of such.  The mac and cheese people were all over. The fish portion looked minnow like as did some type of pasta dish. \n\nWell, I didn't valet park and I will be back, though I think a table is in order.", "author": "Rickey B."}

I requested for a quiet area in the restaurant. We definitely got that space. In fact, next to the fireplace (well, actually on the side of it). Turns out, it is the COLDEST SPOT in the restaurant. It was quiet, I must say. But towards the end of our meal, my girlfriend and I had to rush eating our dessert. I had to put my gloves and overcoat on. Mind you, we consumed a bottle of wine by this time, hoping that this would heat our bodies up a bit.

The food alone would get three stars, the atmosphere and service bump it up to four. That being said, what others have observed is true:  even with reservations, you are rarely seated immediately or even quickly. I've waited at least 10-15 minutes two out of the three times.\n\nOn to the food:\n\nOxtail poutine:  I've had this twice and don't understand the fuss. The kale on top really serves no purpose (except adding some color maybe?) as it doesn't enhance the flavor of the dish in any way. The first time, the potatoes were nice and salty. The second time, not so much, and that lack of seasoning really affected the dish, along with something really bitter tasting that I couldn't identify.\n\nAvocado salad:  I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. So much avocado and a very nice combination of flavors.\n\nBurger:  Nothing special. For a nice restaurant, I expect to be wowed by something as simple as a hamburger, but nothing stood out with this one. Even adding the egg didn't save it!\n\nShrimp cocktail:  Very good. The shrimp were large and tasty, and the herbs on top were a nice touch.\n\nDeviled eggs:  As others have said, they are very heavy on the mustard, but that's one of my fav condiments, so it was all right by me.\n\nI'll go back again for sure because I enjoy the atmosphere so much (upstairs in particular feels like you're in someone's home circa the mid-19th century) and have consistently received excellent service, but I'll probably just keep it to drinks and apps.", "author": "Jessica M."}

I booked a reservation here a month in advance as I read that this place can get very busy. For a Monday night it was indeed, very busy. I liked that it was smooth getting sat. The hostess found my reservation very quickly and proceeded to seat us up stairs.\n\nThe decor here is very nice. I loved the rustic floors and the antique mirrors. There is a bar upstairs and down stairs so getting a drink is no problem. We were sat at a quaint little table for two next to the stairs. Our waiter was very friendly, however he did not check on us as often as I'm used too ( this made it a little frustrating when you needed something). We also noticed our food took a very long time to come out. A couple who was sat 20 minutes after us got their food way before we did (this could be due to how long we waited to order) \n\nThe best part of the place was the drinks. My boyfriend is a huge fan of gin and the cocktail he had was made very well. The hints of cucumber were very refreshing. I had a rose margarita that was light and floral. I like that they don't go crazy on the alcohol pour. It tastes like an actual mixed drink and not just pure alcohol. Also the popovers are a nice touch. The sea salt and butter was so good on the flaky pastry. That was about as good as it got unfortunately. \n\nWe ordered the steak tartare to start. This place is very generous with portions. But it was almost too much for this appetizer. The presentation was very nice but we wasted quite a bit since we wanted to save room for dinner. The taste was ok but that was it, very mediocre. \n\nThen came dinner (after a very long wait). I ordered the famous fried chicken and my boyfriend had the burger that was recommended so much by fellow yelpers. The waiter recommended a side since the chicken doesn't come with one so we also had the broccolini . Again the portions were huge! A whole half chicken comes fried with lemons. The lemon was a nice touch but I only ate the fried chicken breast before I was over my meal. The chicken was ok, but not great. The texture of the batter was nice and the chicken inside was moist and cooked perfectly, but it just felt like it was missing something. My boyfriends burger was also very plain when it came to seasoning. There really wasn't anything spectacular about it. I actually enjoyed the fries that came with his burger more than my own meal. \n\nIt was my boyfriends birthday and I mentioned it when I booked the reservation. They remembered at the end of the meal and brought us two cookies with a happy birthday plate. This was very thoughtful and much appreciated. \n\nAll in all We thought that both meals were not really worth the high price. And for a restaurant with a James Beard contestant, I was very disappointed. All in all I would say the food here is just very bland. Maybe we are a little spoiled since we live in Las Vegas, but who knows. \n\nIf you're coming to grab a drink, then this place is awesome for atmosphere and their crafty cocktails, but I would skip if you're coming for dinner.", "author": "Crystal C."}

The avocado and hearts of palm salad was a disappointment (and a rip off).  For $13, you get 1 avocado, a small amount of shaved hearts of palm, and a drizzle of dressing.  We also got the poutine with oxtail which was similar to chili cheese fries except the chili fries would have had more flavor.  The portion was fairly small, which was fine because we didn't want more.  \n\nOur main courses were better.  I had the fried chicken, which was moist and flavorful. The chicken was more on the \"herbaceous\" side with rosemary and thyme as the primary seasoning rather than spices. It was good, but not as good as the chicken at Town Hall or Maverick.  Like others mentioned, the chicken came solo so I also ordered the grilled broccolini as a side dish.  The broccolini was way too salty.  My husband got the  burger which he seemed to enjoy.  Overall, the food at Wayfare Tavern is overpriced relative to the quantity and quality of the food. The food is only average-to-slightly above average.

I first came for lunch six months ago, and I really liked the vibe and the feel of the place; it's much like an exclusive Men's Club, with red brick, ornate wallpaper, dark wood paneling and trophies on the wall.  It's very 19th century; not dissimilar to the atmosphere at Club 33, except there's not even a trace of Disney here :-)\n\nFast forward to visit #2: it was Christmas Eve.  Earlier that day, we had ridden our bikes over twenty miles - all the way from the Embarcadero to the ferry landing in Tiburon with only one brief stop for water in Sausalito.  The ride was phenomenal, but by the time we got to Wayfare Tavern, we were almost hungry enough to actually enjoy a pizza from Little Caesar's!  We were really hoping for something better though, and Wayfare did not disappoint.\n\nAs elegant as I remembered the place being from my previous lunch visit, I brought a bottle of Jordan 2005 Cabernet to enjoy with our meal.  To set the mood for the kind of service we were to enjoy the rest of that evening, not only did our waiter know (without being told) how to use my trusty aerator, he recognized the wine and he engaged me in a brief discussion on the merits of the 2005 vs. the 2003...\n\nBy combining experience from my first visit to Tyler Florence's FiDi restaurant with some Yelp review scrutiny, I concluded that there were two things not to be missed: The fried chicken and the burger.  Fleshing that out with both recommendations from our savvy waiter and a little menu contemplation, we ordered:\n\n- Mozzarella Burrata - paired with figs and eggplant caponata. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wayfare-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=OvqB7N049t4aBovkAbfKfw#LgpDzWvH3SiQ9NGwOYxUYA The Burrata was incredibly fresh, while the fig and eggplant gave a nice salty, sweet balance to the dish.\n- Oraganic Fried Chicken - buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herbs, and lemon. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wayfare-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=OvqB7N049t4aBovkAbfKfw#Twfx2D8877mZPl3rDTLgPw If you're going to go here only once, order the fried chicken - it's the 800 lbs gorilla of the menu for sure!\n- Wayfare Burger \"Le Grand\" - grass-fed proprietary grind, Marin brie, roasted onion, smoked bacon, brioche. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wayfare-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=OvqB7N049t4aBovkAbfKfw#XdFTcnisw-FWh_bNb1wW3A The burger was juicy, the flavors were in glorious harmony, and the meat was cooked to perfection.; the bacon and brie were supurb flavor stand-outs.\n- Baked Macaroni & Cheese - Vella dry jack & smoked olive oil. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wayfare-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=OvqB7N049t4aBovkAbfKfw#VzmPI0BDSJPFJcOuicnfug Mac & Cheese doesn't usually get my motor racing, but this side was as sophisticated and excellent as can be; one of the best I've had in a long time.  \n\nPraise Mammon for that bike ride, otherwise after a five star meal like this we never would have found room for dessert.  Not just any dessert either - we had Chocolate Cream Pie made with tcho chocolate pudding, salty caramel ganache, and devil's food cake. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wayfare-tavern-san-francisco-2?select=OvqB7N049t4aBovkAbfKfw#UDdqXFTUWEsh3OEZ042AVg So amazing it defies description; order it and you will NOT be sorry!\n\nThe net result was the best meal I remember having during this (or any) Holiday season :-)", "author": "Glenn G."}

So, I was feeling quite excited when I walked up to the restaurant for lunch.\n\nThe restaurant opened a little late on the weekday lunchtime but I was able to get a table at the counter despite not having a reservation. When I dine on my own, the counter is my favourite spot where I can watch the chefs at work.\n\nI spent a polite amount of time perusing the menu before ordering the fried chicken. I knew that I was heading out for a big dinner that night and I was being restrained in ordering. However, an 'American sized portion' of an 'American sized chicken' arrived!\n\nIt was served in what I have since discovered is Californian style - with a big bunch of deep fried herbs on top\n\nThe meat was moist and the coating crispy. It was very nice chicken but I wanted a little more excitement from the coating - a squeeze of lemon did add some zing. I did enjoy it very much but can't say that it was my best fried chicken ever.\n\nI did have some nice chats to the chefs and servers, getting some tips from them for other must eat venues in town.\n\nOn my next trip, I may have to explore the other best fried chicken rumour I've heard about Ad Hoc.

We still opt for one of each: Beausoleil, Fanny Bay, Kusshi, and a Miyagi. Having feasted on oysters in Seattle, where they normally get to be the size of your palm, Wayfare's oysters, despite the enticing variety, were quite puny. Oysters also paired with your typical cocktail sauce, lemon, and Tabasco.\n\nBeef Tartare $16 - http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?userid=5jUlCtMCI9Z7poi1vHq6cQ\nA must-order!

Though salt roasted, it caramelized beautifully with the marrow (see close-up here - [http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/bY5i22V3OgX8HdzznaMhAQ/l.jpg]), and with the rutabaga jam, it made me second guess if I was enjoying a dessert, rather than an appetizer!

We had reservations, which was good, because even at 9pm they were still busy. The tavern setup is really nice - you feel very cozy with your table and you tend to forget there are other diners around you. \n\nUltimately, we decided to let our server guide us on what to have - a move I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Wayfare Tavern. To start, we had the Pheasant Terrine with a beet marmalade and toasted sourdough. It was one of the best dishes we had on this trip to San Francisco. My only complaint is that they didn't willingly send home a pound of that stuff with us.\n\nFor dinner, my partner ordered the buttermilk-brined Southern Fried Chicken and I had the pork chop. We both split an order of Brussels sprouts. Silence fell over the table as our food arrived. Mouths dropped. Drool began to spill. The pork chop was the size of two good filets and it sat atop a small order of spaetzle; it was also topped with a delicious apple and cinnamon jam concoction (kind of like a really good applesauce).\n\nThe chicken was equally remarkable, but the ooh's and aah's were definitely directed to the chop. The sprouts we ordered to split were also so, so good. I mean, when you cook things in bacon, how can they be bad?\n\nBellies were pleasantly full, so unfortunately, there's no dessert to reminisce about.\n\nSince we originally hadn't planned to visit Wayfare Tavern during this trip, our experience there turned out to be a very nice surprise.

Bf and I got there 30 minutes before our reservation but it was early enough in the evening that it was okay, and we were promptly seated at the chef's counter. It was fun watching the food be prepared, but I would've preferred a regular table because the high chairs were not the most comfortable. \n\nOn to the food- we ordered wayy too much but it was hard since there were so many things that sounded good and I'd waited so long to come here! We went with:\n- fried oysters (appetizer): surprisingly light, for being fried, and not at all fishy like oysters can be. 4/5 stars.\n- deviled egg salad with rye toast (appetizer): nothing too special, but still good. Not a must-have. 3.5/5 stars.\n- fried chicken (entree): the much raved about dish that comes with plenty of chicken! I think we got one drumstick, 3 breasts, and a wing? The drumstick was extremely juicy and all the pieces were beyond flavorful. 5/5 for the drumstick, 4/5 for the other pieces (the white meat just couldn't compare to the dark meat)\n- hangar steak (entree): juicy and well-cooked, it came with potatoes that I would've liked to be more cooked. 3.5/5 stars.\n- mac and cheese (side): my least favorite of the night, it lacked flavor to me. It was creamy and gooey, but didn't have the needed or expected oomph. 3/5 stars.\n- donuts (dessert): definitely both of our faves of the night, fresh out of the oven or fryer, with 3 sauces to accompany the deliciousness- raspberry compote, lemon curd, and strawberry jam. These were light and airy, and even though we were stuffed from our over-ordering, we thoroughly enjoyed this perfect end to the meal. 5/5 stars.\n\nOh, and can't forget the complimentary popovers you get before your meal. Light, airy, and buttery, I could feast on just these and be happy (not really, but close!). Overall, 4 stars for a very satisfying meal that comes with great service and ambiance.

In what level of reality are you the hostess above the patrons of the establishment, I was simply appalled at how they spoke to us as if they were better than us, I couldn't believe it!  When we sat down next to the bar, we ordered drinks, when we went to pick up our drinks at the bar, the hostess sat someone at our bar table - WTF!

Decided to visit because of Yelp and also because I used to watch Tyler Florence's food network shows all the time. Thought that we might be a bit under dressed as it a nice restaurant but it was pretty casual and they were more than happy to have us especially because of all our giants gear. \n\nI was pretty impressed with this place. We sat upstairs for an early dinner and there was almost no wait at all. We sat next to a private room which looked very cool for a big party or reservation. It was sent up like a library or billiard room with a gigantic pool table in the middle on which they serve you dinner (it is covered over the top so it looks like a regular table of course). \n\nAnyways, we started off with a Kobe beef tar-tar which was absolutely AMAZING! The meet was so fresh and flavorful and the egg yolk on top was a perfect touch. Also, the bread they gave us to begin was very good.\n\nI opted for a burger because I was in the mood. I also got it with a fried egg. It was a pretty good burger, but not the best and was a bit overcooked. I asked for medium but it was slightly over done as there was almost no pink in the center. It came with melted Gruyere cheese which I love and the fried egg went very well with it. My sister got the fried chicken which they are well known for, and I had some of that which was fantastic. \n\n Service was also superb in case I forgot to mention.

Attentive enough.  \n\nFood = beautiful presentation. \n\nPopover with butter on the side = beautiful alternative to heavy breads in the beginning of the meal.  It was a nice way to whet the appetite.  \n\nFor an entree, I tried their blue plate special (Friday's):  B.L.T.T. Bacon, lettuce, heirloom tomatoes and truffles.  Oh and a softshell crab.  And this is NOT a sandwich.  It was delicious, light in weight, heavy (in a good way) in flavor, and very enjoyable.  The flavors just danced on my tastebuds... sweet tomatoes, buttery lettuce, perfected cooked apple smoked bacon, slivers of truffle and slightly crisp softshell crab of heady seawater.  ($27.00)\n\nThe mac-n-cheese...it fell short of my salivating expectations.  Sorry but I thought it was way too creamy, and the flavor was overwhelming, as the pasta was too-too soft (for my tastes).  Sorry but I like my mac-n-cheese in a certain way, and they did not crisp it enough.  Is it inedible? No.  But is it something I would try again? No.  BUT I know enough people who'd go gaga for this mac-n-cheese though. lol  ($8.00)\n\nDecor = very, very masculine. Classy but feels like an old-fashioned men's club (think Olympic Club, not Gold Club).  \n\nWhat makes them lose stars though, is the pricing.  Prices are moderate to pricey.  In this economy, it's hard to want to spend $38.00 on a lunch, for one, and then add in tip.  \n\nAlso, even though I'm not a vegetarian, I found it disturbing to see so much animal fat in everything...one way or another.  \n\nI'll keep this place in my backpocket for impressing out-of-towners who like American cuisine and want to drop the dough.", "author": "Fannie S."}

I've been wanting to go here ever since I started working in San Francisco back in 2010. My coworkers at the time had promised me that they would take me there for my welcome lunch so I could have their amazing fried chicken, but alas, they never did. \n\nI had to wait 2 long years before I finally went for my birthday (and now I go there every year for my birthday). And let me tell you, it was worth the wait! Fried chicken galore!!! So perfectly crispy and juicy at the same time. So many perfect flavors. FRIED SAGE! I love fried sage. I am drooling as I am writing this. The fried chicken is to die for. I've been to Wayfare Tavern three times and every single time I've had the fried chicken. There are so many other things that look so good on the menu that I want to try, but every time, without fail, I get the fried chicken. Unless the scallops start coming with a side of fried chicken, it's going to be hard to get me to stop ordering it.\n\nSo I have tried a few other bites of things besides the fried chicken. Their poutine...drooling. I am part Canadian so I do love poutine. But fair warning, this isn't your traditional poutine. But anything with truffle oil on it and I'm sold and this was no exception. The first time I went there I had the bone marrow appetizer. So good. So tasty. I wanted it again the second time I went there, but they weren't serving it anymore. I even dared to try their fried oysters and I don't even like fried oysters! Raw oysters, yes, sign me up. Love them. Could eat them all day every day. But fried? Nah, not so much, not my thing. But Wayfare's fried oysters were good!! They didn't have the consistency that I hate and tasted delicioso.\n\nDid I mention that they serve freshly baked popovers instead of bread? No? Well they serve freshly baked popovers instead of bread. Enough said. \n\nI could go on and on about how much I love Wayfare Tavern, but I'll stop just because I'm drooling too much. I cannot wait for my birthday to come around again so I can go back and hopefully try something new. Ah, who am I kidding.

A tiny bit on the plain side but there were two pinches of salt and pepper on my plate that I used to dip my bites in (yes, I ate my fried chicken with silverware) -- that's what that's for, right? It worked out -- made the chicken have a much fuller taste. It also came with two slices of lemon to squeeze on the chicken -- not used to that, but I participated and it was good. It was hot and had great, juicy texture but a little bit of the meat was red so I left that on the plate.\n\nMy girlfriend had the poutine and the broccoli cheese soup. Poutine was outstanding with the gravy covering all of the potatoes - thanks for that! The soup was more broccoli than cheese -- I finished it for her as she wasn't too into it. I loved the egg in it -- the broccoli pieces themselves had some weird seasoning on them so I left those in the bowl.\n\nCan we talk about those incredible popovers they give you to start with? We were delighted with those more than our entrees/apps hahahaha.\n\nAnyway, I guess I over-hyped this place in my mind all of these years because I expected to be blown away but I was just regular-satisfied, you know?

The server then tried to push us on the appetizers which was a bit irritating.  \nTo cut to the chase, I feel like most of our food was frozen before it came out.  To start with the sides, the Mashed Potatoes were whipped to the point of watery consistency.  It had the taste of burrata but none of the creaminess.  They tasted like instant potatoes with a hint of cheese.  Almost Inedible to be honest.  The Mac and Cheese had a strange smokey flavor and left a strange chemical aftertaste in the mouth.  We barely ate a third of it.  The Brussel Sprouts had five overcooked and oversalted Brussel Sprouts in the dish, along with overcooked sweet potatoes. \nThe Steak were the biggest disappointments of the night.  They were cooked med rare and pink which we ordered.  However, they tasted of water and the steak was so chewy that it was hard to cut.

While this certainly isnt true about every waiter and bartender there, it seems to be for a good portion. \n\nWe sat down for lunch without a drink since I had been waiting 15 minutes, our waiter (Joshua) doesnt acknowledge us, finally saunters over as if he were strolling in the park.

Wait staff seems like they would bend over backwards for you, constantly refilling water and refilling the bread, instantly picking things up for you if you dropped them etc etc..\n\nNow onto the food. \n\nBoyfriend and I being a big fan of eggs and me reading so many rave reviews about the deviled eggs ordered the deviled egg salad (I believe they just recently changed their deviled egg appetizer to this). This salad had tons of fresh herbs and spices with a lot of flavor going on, however was not something I particularly favored as a pairing with my eggs. Not bad, just not my personal preference. I think we both would have much rather preferred the old deviled eggs that came with fried shrimp on top than the salad that was served. Oh well.\n\nI absolutely love burgers and would spend a pretty penny on a beautifully crafted patty given I believe it's worth the price. I have been dying to try the one here for awhile so of course this was my go to long before I had even arrived. The egg was perfectly cooked with yolk running down the center of my burger, brioche was super soft and melted in my mouth but the main attraction of the burger (the meat itself) was a little too dry. I ordered it medium (mean't to say medium rare) and it arrived on the more well done side with no particular excitement going on with tastebuds coming from the actual meat itself. Fries were decent but seemed more like a side attraction, and despite the bun, egg and bacon my meal was somewhat disappointing. I probably would have been better off taking the patty off and eating the rest as a \"sandwich\"...maybe it was my fault for getting medium vs. medium rare but even at that usually if the patty is really good quality i'd still be more satisfied.\n\nBoyfriend got the highly acclaimed fried chicken, which I had to admit WAS really good. Lightly crispy on the outside with tons of great flavors going on and super moist chicken beneath the surface. \n\nI honestly think the best thing about our entire meal was the donuts.. they were SOOOOO moist and honestly didn't need the dipping sauces that it came with (but I indulged anyways). Highly recommend the donuts here!

I love olives, but there's something about taking a pit out of your mouth at a nice restaurant with friends that just isn't attractive. Malbec was good. \nI got the halibut, friend got bass, another in our group got the vegetarian pasta, and another got the fried chicken. We shared the Mac n cheese. Mac n cheese was interesting..not usual cheeses. That usually can be a good thing but the flavors weren't astonishing or anything. My friends bass was alright, sort of strange that they left the skin on. And my halibut had the potential to be good but dang.....it was so fishy. There was a sauce underneath that put me off so much, I only ate half. Half of the group really loves that restaurant and were the ones who recommended it, so I didn't show that I was a little put off. Even my friend tried it and just thought \"meh\". \nI didn't try the fried chicken or veg dish, but like I said, the ones who ordered those dishes are the ones who recommended the restaurant so I'm sure they loved it. \nProbably will not be back and definitely won't recommend.", "author": "McKenna F."}

Our reservations were for 9:30 pm and we were seated right at about 9:30. \n\nThe restaurant is really warm and cozy inside. We were first seated at a table in the way back (almost a dark corner) and we asked if we could move upon sitting down. It was really a horrible place for a table (squished between two tables all the way in the back where you could not enjoy any of the ambiences of the restaurant). However, with no problem, they moved us to the upstairs dining area which was MUCH better.\n\nThe warm pop over bread that they server is amazing and we each had two pieces. We also ordered the fried chicken, scallops and mac and cheese. \n\nWhen dinner arrived it was on the cold side. My husband was telling me his scallops were cold at the same time I was having him feel my chicken because it was cold. The server heard us (have no idea how she heard) and quickly took the plates away. The new plates arrived about 10 minutes later and we were expecting them to be piping hot. Unfortunately, they were at the same temperature the original dinner was...cold.\n\nThe food had excellent flavors and despite the dinner being cold twice, we enjoyed the food. However, it could have been much better if the meals would have been served hot.", "author": "Julie L."}

My parents took me here tonight for an early birthday dinner (and early Sunday dinner, at 5:15 p.m.; my parents eat at senior citizens' time, what can I say?).  Now I have crossed it off my list and won't be coming back... it was severely underwhelming.  \n\nThe service was mediocre. The hostess who didn't acknowledge our presence until I waited a few minutes and finally approached her about our reservation.  The waiter seemed a little green, but A for effort, and he was friendly.  The bus boys (two assisted us) were definitely UNfriendly and perhaps hated life.  \n\nOn to the food.  Amazing deviled eggs don't need to cost $9.  Maggie T. makes good ones, and I ate those for free.  So I didn't order the eggs.\n\nHere's how the food went down:\n\nSTEAK TARTARE 16\norganic fresh chopped beef, French mustard dressing, egg yolk, garlic popovers\n--- Skip. This had a decent flavor but it was very one note.  I felt like they built a good foundation and just stopped.  On top of that, this is pretty much pureed meat.  It's like baby food.  There's nothing to chew, if not for the popover, and I felt like I should just be swallowing it like fro yo.  I couldn't taste the steak flavor.  I've never had steak tartare where you had no bits to chew.  Frankly, it was freaking weird.  Also, the popover is not a proper vehicle for pureed meat.  If you're going to give me baby food, give me something with a little more holding power than floppy (delicious) bread.  For the record, my favorite steak tartare can be found at Chez Papa.  \n\nSALT ROASTED BONE MARROW 14\nrutabaga jam, grilled sourdough, parsley\n--- Skip.  The rutabaga jam didn't go well with the marrow, and the grilled sourdough was drenched in grease.  My mom commented that she had never seen me drink so much water.  I had to wash the greasiness down as well as the saltiness.  The parsley leaves are served as a sprig.  Sometimes it works (rosemary in lamb dish I had once).  Here it didn't.  Just mince it and sprinkle it on top, okay?  And use less oil on your bread.  And get rid of the jam.  Then it's okay... I'd rather the marrow at Marlowe.  Best bone marrow (though this may be unfair) can be had at Masa (roasted crusted bone marrow, removed from bone... they were perfect bites of bone marrow).\n\nBAKED MACARONI & CHEESE 8\nVella dry jack, smoked olive oil\n--- Order this. This was one of the better dishes of the evening.  It's a side though.  I would eat it again, but considering it's a side, I would need an entree to order it on the side of.\n\nWILD MUSHROOM PAPPARDELLE 19\nwhole grain pasta, swiss chard, poached  farm egg, parmesan broth\n--- Order this.  This was actually really good.  I would definitely order this again.  If I somehow ended up here (probably at someone else's insistence), I would order this and be happy.  I wish it had other protein, at $19, but I do like a good egg and overall it was a good dish.  The mushroom flavor was nice and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  \n\nWHITE SEA BASS 26\nbuttered potato puree, sea bean salsa verde, caviar, grilled lemon\n--- Skip. The fish was dry and honestly, a little boring.  The caviar was a nice touch, though.\n\nGRILLED BONE-IN PORK CHOP 29\nblack pepper spaetzle, braised cabbage, spiced apple pulp, grained mustard cream \n--- Order this. This was solid.  Tender, flavorful, and all the flavors came together.  The spaetzle was a great addition to set this dish off from similar pork chop dishes found at other places.  The apple pulp was perfect (not too acidic and they give you enough).", "author": "Erika C."}

Amazingly people were still coming in after us!  Dinner started off strong and ended strong but the middle was a miss. Why the two star rating?  The entire middle of dinner and service. \n\nTo start they give complimentary popover bread and it was warm and delicious. Definitely deserves a place on the Wayfare Tavern highlight reel. We ordered the steak tartare for our appetizer.  The steak tartare was my favorite thing we ordered. It comes with chips but I preferred it on the popover bread. \n\nOur entrees are where things started falling off the rails. First, while waiting for our entrees, our server came up to clear off our salt and pepper then realized we didn't even get our entrees yet!  \n\nI ordered the fried chicken, my husband ordered the burger and we ordered a side of Mac and cheese. The server asked how my husband would like his burger and he ordered it medium rare. The burger came out medium well to well. We sent back his burger and it took an extremely long time to come out again and came out about medium but came out with an onion sauce my husband asked for on the side and he ended up not eating his burger because he didn't like the sauce. When we told the server, the server went to the kitchen then returned and said, \"the cook specifically said he didn't put the onions on,\" as if we were lying and they weren't visible on the burger!  Also, there was a creamy sauce which I didn't see disclosed on the menu that he didn't like but we didn't even mention it because maybe we missed it on the menu. My chicken came out correct but had a strange burned taste.  The crust on the Mac and cheese also has the burned taste but the underlying Mac and cheese was fine. After having issues with both burgers and not wanting to wait another 15 minutes for a 3rd they took the burger off our bill. \n\nAt this point I wanted dessert but it was getting uncomfortable in the restaurant because we were sitting near the kitchen and the kitchen was not so quietly closing up shop. It was before 11 when they were doing this and I believe 11 pm is closing. For a Saturday night I was surprised this was happening so early and in plain view of guests. I ended up ordered the cream pie anyways which appeared to be pre made but was very good nonetheless. Definitely the 2nd highlight in a not so great dinner experience. \n\nFinally, our server brought over the check and commented that he was sorry for the issues with the burger but \"it was in no way his fault.\"  This was a very unprofessional and disturbing because 1. He should have made sure the burger was cooked correctly the second time, 2. He should've never argued with us, and 3. It was very clear he was saying that to get us to tip him as if we didn't know how to tip. We routinely give 18-20% minimum tips but gave him 15% of the GROSS (including the burger) bill because we were put off by his comment.", "author": "Elyssa S."}

Service was great. Very attentive server. Very personable and friendly and I tipped him well in the end despite food being pretty mediocre. My client was in a casual mood and ordered the burger. I did as well after the server talked about it being one of the best items on the menu with a special grind of meat, etc. I ordered it medium rare which the server agreed was the perfect way to order it. It came well done. Not medium, or even well. It was WELL DONE. Very dry and overcooked. All the brie, brioche and bacon in the world couldn't save this thing.  No flavor. I would have sent it back but I was at a business dinner and did not want to disturb the experience as my client seemed to be happy with his.

We got there on time, but had to wait around for awhile for the table to get set.  I had called ahead of time to let them know that it was my boyfriend's birthday, so when we sat down at our table, there was a signed card from the restaurant -- very thoughtful!  The tables were set pretty close to each other (as is most places in SF), so it got cozy really quickly.  We ordered a bottle of wine, which was probably one of the best bottles of Pinot I've had.  Unfortunately I don't remember which bottle it was -__- (Sorry!)\n\nWe ordered the Steak Tartare 16, and while it was delicious, we thought it was second fiddle to what we had at Chez Papa Resto a few weeks beforehand.  For the mains, I had the Organic Fried Chicken.  I was prepared for a large slab of chicken, that had breaded and deep fried beyond belief, but instead what I got was a light, flaky crust around the chicken, and a deep/juicy inside.  The chicken itself was cooked to perfection, and the portion size was big too!  My boyfriend had the Pork Chop and ordered the side of Mac n Cheese.  We had gone to Baker & Banker about a month before and got the Pork Chop there, and I think that the general consensus was that B&B's pork chop was better.  That being said, the Mac n Cheese side made the dinner a success, especially seeing his face when the bowl was put in front of him.  For dessert, we had coffees, and a small little birthday cake that was brought out with a candle.  We passed on the dessert menu since I recall barely being able to stand after eating all of the chicken.  At the end of the night, we were both happy with our experience at Wayfare Tavern.  Not sure if I would wait 3 months for a reservation again, but the food and hype definitely live up to the situation.", "author": "Lisa I."}

After all the great reviews, but slow, unfriendly service, undercooked (raw) chicken, plates missing ingredients (no speck in the pasta) and tiny portions really ruined it. \n\nThe bartender seemed annoyed that we had a reservation, but were happier sitting and eating at the bar. The fried chicken was not hot, and the drumstick was actually uncooked. My wife's pasta was not only missing main ingredients, but was cold. The cream based sauce was congealed on the plate when it was served. The Mac and cheese was ridiculously amazing though. Absolutely out of the park incredible.\n\nInteresting to note that their head chef left in September and since then, the reviews have been fairly negative.

The hostess told us there will be a 10min wait even though we were literally the 2nd group in the restaurant. Thirty seconds later she told us our table was ready and led us to one of the ten well-set empty tables upstairs. Hmmmmmm (giving side eye). No need to trick us into buying drinks at the bar, we flock to alcohol like white on rice. But no points docked for that since we were looking cute that night; looks can be deceiving. \n\nFor apps we ordered French Onion Dip and Fried Oysters. Presentation for the dip was outstanding and definitely unique, but it was literally some pieces of chips and an onion filled with sour cream.  Fried oysters would've been awesome but somebody had a loose wrist with the salt. \n\nWe waited 45 + min for our entrees to arrive, and had to flag down our server to check on our food.

I saw that they make it differently now, but when I went, the fries were smothered in a truffle sparerib sauce and covered with cheese curds - my date and I thought we were in heaven. I'm gonna sound corny, but it was like in \"The Fault in Our Stars\" where they eat a dish and say something like \"I wish this food was a person so I could marry it.\" Yeah, the poutine was like that.\n\nEverything else was definitely solid, but the popovers and poutine were the action.\n\nGo Tyler Florence!

The starters were tempting, as we wanted to try the majority of them.  We ended up having the half dozen raw oysters (fresh like the sea), salt roasted bone marrow with rutabaga jam and sourdough (buttery good, with nice sweet contrast from the jam - my fav of the night), monterey bay sardines (parsley butter added to the smokey flavor).  For our entrees we ordered the organic fried chicken (light crispy buttermilk batter and tender chicken with rosemary and thyme accents, big portions), the Guinness braised lamb shank (tender fall off the bone good), and a side of their shishito peppers grilled with white anchovy paste and fried garlic (had a nice little kick - loved these).\n\nFor dessert they brought out a plate of complimentary fresh baked cookies with a nice chocolate happy birthday written on the plate (very nice touch).  We also shared the butterscotch charlotte (brioche filled with warm butterscotch sauce, butterscotch brittle, orange-sicle ice cream and kumquats).  Coffee and tea were served in their own individual pots.  We rolled out of there, not knowing that the portions were so generous...\n\nService from the beginning to end was impeccable.

The entire staff, from hosts, to the server, to the bussers and the manager were all extremely friendly, and the service was quite prompt. I read reviews of challenges with service, but we didn't experience any...perhaps because it wasn't too slammed since we were there on a Sunday night.

Jesus, Joseph and Mary - these are not just bread items, these are the popovers.  They're like light, airy pieces of heaven - even better when slathered with the whipped butter they provide.  \n\nWe had several of these - if bread is your downfall, get ready because you're going to want more than one.\n\nRight away the girls gravitated to the fried chicken - I was a little irritated with that because I wanted that as well; but, what fun would that have been if we all got the same thing?  I asked our server how the burger was and she said, \"best in the city\".  Now that's a challenge in my book - so I got it, medium rare, with the fried egg on top.  The chicken was amazing - from what I got to taste (which to be honest wasn't much - they went to town on it) and the burger...\n\nThe burger lived up to its billing - meat perfectly cooked, egg yolk oozing out, homemade pickles.  Damn, that was a mighty tasty burger.  The fries are pretty damn good also and so are the pickles.\n\nSo, we had a great meal and great service with really no negatives.  The place isn't cheap; but, hey - you're going to have a great time and a great meal.  Our tab was just a hair under $150 and that included a round of drinks, the 2 apps, 3 entrees and a shared side - mashed potatoes (these were pretty awesome as well)..\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Darin W."}

However, the quality of food is lacking. The service isn't bad for a busy place. I didn't get to try the drinks so that's not weighted in this review. I ordered the mac and cheese, smoked mushrooms, fried chicken, and shared a seasonal vegetarian dish (wasnt worth remembering because it was whatevers). I'm going to focus on the fried chicken because it's my top ten guilty pleasures... Quantity wise, I couldnt eat all of it, and the pieces were favorable. With regards to the seasoning, I'm surprised people were capable of even tasting seasoning. Having said that I think the rosemary added some visual appeal, however it still was pretty bleh. The hot sauce was a good touch and the chicken DEFINITELY needed a kick or something to redeem itself from blandness, so props to the restaurant for having hot sauce, especially since it wasn't generic store bought sauce.

Our table was nice on the second floor and it wasn't terribly crowded at noon on a Tuesday, so the noise level wasn't as bad as I had expected. When the guy with the warm, fresh brioche stopped by to give us ours, I wasn't too sure I would indulge but I'm glad I did! The whipped butter on the brioche or popover was so delicious! I could have eaten just that!\n\nWe ordered fries and the broccolini for appetizers. I didn't eat the fries but the broccolini was amazing. It came with a light coating of shaved parmesan and had a bit of a kick to it too. I should mention I am by no means a \"foodie\", so my review is from a layperson's point of view for what it's worth. :)\n\nI ordered the skirt steak and it was supposed to come with cornbread but they were out so they gave me another popover which I ended up taking in a doggy bag. It was odd though that I had to ask where the cornbread was. It was one reason I ordered that entree, so had I known it wasn't available, I might have gone with something else. The skirt steak was very good and tender, and the flavors of the accompanying greens were also good. The portions, especially for the fried chicken, were very substantial. I felt the skirt steak was good but the plate that I got was overpriced at $36. The waitstaff weren't in our way, but towards the end our gal was nowhere to be found which was disappointing. For not being hugely busy, it was really hard to wrap up our lunch but luckily I had a flexible schedule. \n\nI gave three out of five stars because at the beginning to middle our waitperson was very attentive and our food came rather quickly, however I took one point off because she seemed to forget all about us at some point, and it took a really long time to get the check and then get it back to sign for it. Also, their machine wasn't working so they used carbon copies (like the olden days), but they didn't fill anything out on the form so that was a bit annoying to have to fill the thing out myself.  Pressed REALLY hard with their pen. Another point removed because as good as the skirt ateak tasted, the presentation was unimpressive for $36, and I would have liked to have been warned about the cornbread shortage ahead of time. \n\nI like the decor and the warm popovers could bring me back to give it another try.", "author": "Anne T."}

Seeing how well reviewed they were on Yelp, I decided to make the pro-move and called in for reservations. \n\nAlthough small in space, I completely adore the ambiance of this restaurant. The decor had a vintage charm, extremely elegant. Although the restaurant was packed, it wasn't too loud, we were still able to engage in great conversation. \n\nAs for the food.... One of the most pleasant surprises was their choice in bread starter. Instead of serving the conventional sliced baguette, each person gets a fresh popover, which was delicately crispy on the outside and extremely airy on the inside. It was actually the first time I'd ever had a popover and I don't think I will easily find another that will taste this nice. I ordered the avocado salad and the scallop entree. The avocado salad was delightful with great presentation. 1 full avocado thinly sliced in a fan formation, drizzled with a light dressing, it was the perfect way to manipulate such a heavy fruit to taste so light and fresh. The scallops were also delish but did not made a significant impact to my experience, but that's fine since my experience was already exceptionally well.\n\nIf I ever have a reason to fine-dine after work again, I would definitely come here.  According to Yelp, one of the most popular dishes is actually the organic fried chicken.

The Champagne flutes were not collected (and we weren't asked about them), which was okay until our [large] red wine glasses came and we had a lot of glassware on the table (\"water\" glasses, \"water\" goblets, champagne glasses, and large red wine glasses).  At one point our waitress was filling waters, and L. asked her to take her Champagne glass away.  I gave our waitress my \"water goblet\" for her to refill my water, and instead of filling it, she took it away with the Champagne glass.

I typically go there for work lunches though so I often forget just how much I love it until I'm there. I love this restaurant not just for the food but for the aesthetics. It's gorgeous inside. It has those East Coast touches that take you back to New York mixed with a lodge cabin feel combining into a beautiful, comfortable feel. Classy but not pretentious, a little more formal, but you can wear what you want, you can just feel good about life when you dine here. You really can't go wrong with anything- aka just order everything, it's worth it.\n\nHighlights:\n\n- They bring you a popover fresh out of the oven at every meal. They pair it with a delicious butter topped with black sea salt. Sooo good. Don't worry about getting too full for dinner- this popover is worth it- eat it.\n\n- The deviled eggs- they change seasonally but I've never had one that was anything less than exceptional here. Last weekend's version was topped with whole mustard seeds.\n\n- Fried Chicken! If you didn't know about the fried chicken, now you do. Get it. They are ridiculously good, perfect cuts of meat. I usually have it for lunch and it's a generous portion so I naively assumed the dinner portion would be similar. So wrong. They give you a half chicken of fried goodness. It was 5-6 pieces in total of dark & white meat.\n\n- Mac and cheese- I think this also slightly changes seasonally but is a great side to get for the table to share. Who doesn't love them some gourmet mac n cheese?\n\n- The Burger. Right up there with the fried chicken and equally delicious. When trying to decide between the two, I just opt for which I'm in the mood for. It's amazing, juicy, a perfect bun, and all the right toppings. Can't remember if it comes with bacon, if not, it's usually a good idea to add it, because really, why not?\n\n- French fries- they're my favorite food and I'm always satisfied with them here. Get the side of aioli and it's perfection.\n\nThey also have a great cocktail list with a variety so there's something for everyone. The desserts always sound amazing but since I always seem to order the whole menu, I'm too full by the time dessert rolls around- even though I love dessert. Maybe one of these days I'll save room for it.", "author": "Amanda M."}

I expected to be blown away by the food at Wayfare Tavern, and when i say \"blown away\" i mean like eyes rolling back into my head as i enjoyed each savory bite. Unfortunately, food was good but not incredible.\n\ni got the Le Grand burger ($19 + $2 for an egg on top).  I've had better gourmet burgers at Marlowe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/marlowe-san-francisco-2) and Garden Court in the Palace Hotel (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-garden-court-san-francisco).  They use brie in the burger, but i would've preferred a saltier cheese. Maybe it's just preference.\n\nThe complimentary bread called pop-overs were delicious!  They're like a yorkshire pudding + a cream puff.  So fluffy, warm and yummy.\n\nWe ordered the Beef Tartare + Deviled eggs appetizers.  I don't like mustard so i didn't expect to like these dishes.  I was right, but we ordered them anyway coz the rest of my party wanted to try.\n\nThe FRIED CHICKEN was seasoned well with herb & very juicy.  But at the end of the day, you're still only eating fried chicken that costs $23.  Steep!\n\nThe best thing i ate that night was a bite of my friend's HALIBUT ($30). My God, that thing was cooked PERFECTLY.  I am SO picky when it comes to how my fish is cooked, because so many restaurants overcook fish.  The halibut here was definitely eyes-rolling-back-in-my-head-worthy, but everything else was just good.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

Like truffle mac 'n' cheese, bacon wrapped dates, or any host of food trends that have seeped into the masses over the years, it looks like my favorite ovo-lacto hors d'oeuvres item is set for a thunderous comeback! And upon hearing rave reviews of Wayfare Tavern's version of the classic Roman creation, I've been meaning to pop in... and I finally had a chance to follow through this past Saturday.\n\nOl' Ty-Flo's Financial District gastropub menu certainly has other notable nibbles brimming with accolades (like the fried chicken and complimentary popovers to name a couple), but I was literally there only for the huevos, and nothing else (well, I supposed I did order a glass of Prosecco as well, but hey - it was a Saturday). Six halves of hard boiled eggs, stuffed with bacon, mayonnaise, Dijon mustard, smoked paprika, celery leaves, and black pepper. As you might imagine - they were incredible. By far my new favorite in town, edging out the little buggers at Trademark, Elite Cafe, and Jasper's.

Unfortunately, all other portions are SUPER SMALL that one has to really fill in the gaps with popovers. A lady beside me had the scallop entree, and I felt badly for her since she literally had about 3-4 scallops with what seemed like an assortment of edible decorations.  My husband ordered a similarly tiny but fancily decorated pork tenderloin dish, and he ended up having to share my chicken (which actually didn't come with any vegetables or substantial accompaniments (giant sprig of thyme doesn't count!).\n\nFor appetizers, we had ordered the deviled eggs, and while they were pretty, they weren't the stellar put-you-in-a-new-bracket kind of deviled eggs we'd expected for such an establishment.\n\nAlso, I don't know about the first floor, but the second floor has ONE nicely decorated but disgusting-with-use unisex bathroom, which is way too few for the number of people seated nearby.\n\nI'd like to go back for the popovers, but there are just so many discouraging factors at the moment.", "author": "Deborah C."}

Best fried chicken I've ever had...like ever.\nBavette Steak -- My boyfriend ordered this and he loved it. I think it had kind of a weird taste that I couldn't put my finger on, but it was a solid yes for him.\nRoasted Mushrooms -- So awesome. My only complaint is that I wished I had more room in my stomach to finish them. The mushroom puree within the mushrooms (so meta) really took it over the edge.\nBurrata Whipped Potatoes -- Frigged up good. It was like eating butter in the best way possible. My boyfriend said he wished they had a little more texture, which was true as they are so whipped and thin they don't really hang on your fork, but the taste was so great I forgive them.\n\n\nMinus one star for the grilled octopus, and because our server was kind of rude in a strange way, but I get everyone has off days so it wasn't that big of a deal.

If you've read any of my other reviews, you have probably concluded that any kind of warm bread is my kryptonite. Seriously, I don't know how people do no carb diets. Back to the popovers....warm, flaky, soft centered and served with house made fluffy butter. What a great way to start a meal.\n\nI dined her twice for dinner on Saturdays. Once downstairs at the bar area with the bf and the other time upstairs with the parentals. Both times had great experiences and tried different dishes. \n\nNow when I think about Tyler Florence and his cooking show I automatically think of hearty hearty meals. I do enjoy lamb, so I ordered the braised lamb shank. It was fall off the bone tender and so flavorful. Cooked with TLC. It was topped with flash fried brussel sprouts and I love me some brussel sprouts! Bf ordered a white fish topped with caviar. The fish was cooked perfectly but we thought lacking a little bit of seasoning. Maybe bc the caviar on top added a lot of saltiness? We ended with cream puffs with lemon filling and berry compote...drool! \n\nThe second time I had dinner there, I ordered the mendocino sea urchin and had the ahi carpaccio as my entree. The sea urchin was presented in the half shell and topped with with foam. However, I wish there was a little more urchin. I think there were only 3 pieces and one of them was a little gritty. The bottom of the shell was filled with a potato mash. The tuna carpaccio was amazing! The portion was huge and definitely grade A tuna. Parents shared a starter salad which was very fresh. Papa had lamb stew, which he thought was great. Mama had a seafood pasta dish and would have preferred if it was warmer in temperature. We all shared a strawberry rhubarb tart for dessert. It wasn't what I expected....it was deconstructed. I suppose artsy but I think I would have enjoyed a slice or mini tart instead of pieces of crust, strawberry and cream placed randomly on a plate. The waiter had also recommended some bubbles for us. It turned out to be $20/glass. I don't mind paying for good booze, but I felt that the waiter could have mentioned that before just giving us the tab. \n\nMost people come here bc they want to try this acclaimed restaurant owned by T.F. I think I would like to try other place around SF before returning. If you haven't dined at Wayfare before, check out the hype and decide for yourself.", "author": "Liv A."}

I've been here a couple of times, but tonight knocked my little cotton socks off.\n\nWhere do I begin?  Ok. Yes. It began with a gimlet. It was a hot SF day, and I needed something cool and refreshing, since my poor SF skin can't handle 80 degree heat.  With that, we naturally decided to order a dozen oysters (East Coast & West Coast), which my favorite bar tender, Marky D, decided to hook us up with some champagne. Ladies, watch out. He's a cutie.\n\nThen we moved onto the pork ribs ($26) and sauteed mushrooms.  The pork ribs were out of this world.... they were so tender and juicy, they literally fell straight off the bone.  They were also served with grilled corn, and a roasted plum, which sounds weird, but was a completely awesome sweet and tender compliment with the spicy and sweet BBQ sauce - albeit messy, but so worth it.\n\nTo finish, we had the chocolate cream pie ($9)..... and let me warn you.... the crust is actually cooked with pork fat, which is why this is so deliciously amazing. Although it might sound like a heavy dessert (caramel ganache, devil's food cake, Scharffenberger chocolate pudding, and then topped with whipped cream) I promise it will be something you'll never forget. \n\nAlso, since I was last here they've taken the asparagus and the burrata off the menu.... \n\nWayfare, I was truly impressed with you tonight.

Booths feel sunken in, bar seats 8 and was empty throughout our visit.\n\nGo and order the following things in this order.\nDrink: Ty Flo reserve cab, just get the whole bottle.\nAppetizer: Kobe tartare with garlic popovers (flavor explosion!)\nMeal: fried chicken (great version of a classic dish)\nSide: collard greens (gotta have veggies!)\nDessert: free choice, you can't go wrong.\n\n\nExtended review-\nAs other have said, service can be lacking. The employees who brought out our dishes and refilled our drinks were considerably more friendly and personable than our assigned server, though nothing actually went wrong- just felt stiff and a bit unprofessional; had to request a few items that should have been anticipated. However, he was meticulous about clearing the table including brushing up crumbs between courses and retrieving all plates and silverware in a single trip.\n\nUnderwhelmed by some of our other dishes, the ones above were the stars.\nOur party mostly drank various beers, and all seemed pleased with selection.\nDeviled eggs were a bit too creamy for me and had undertones of a cheese-like taste? Didn't work for me. Also had a dozen mixed oysters, which I did not partake of but everyone else enjoyed.\nOther entrees at table included sturgeon (not my thing, found it bland and root veggies and sauce it was plated with to be fairly tasteless), flank steak and beets (decent but not Impressive), lamb (moist but not as flavorful as menu description led me to expect).\nDesserts included the donuts with pomegranate, sweet potato, and apple sauces (very interesting, worth a shot), chocolate pie (as expected, good but a bit predictable- safe choice for less adventurous eaters), and the brown spice cake (one dish, many different flavors with the ice cream and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e mousse).\n\nSide note: a few other review stress that parking is difficult in this area and advise springing for valet. This was not my experience at all, and driving an extra block down, same side, we found several spots available.

This is really an excellent situation as the bartenders at the Wayfare are fantastic, friendly, personable and they have a sense of humor. \n\nAdditionally, being in a more communal dining experience, we were able to observe some of the goings on. My cousin clocked the chick who was obviously there to pick up, single lady on the lookout for men of a certain type and income level. You know her.\nThe FUN couple, with the big smiles and exuberant energy, who are tickled pink when you order the same dessert they did.\nThe after work crowd, who stayed to work on a project till 7pm, then,\"Guess what i feel like?!?!\"\nThey were all there, and it was a blast.\n\nWe split a ceasar salad, which was good as caesar go, but the avocado salad with butter lettuce that i had last time was a better choice. More unique and textured.\n\nThe popovers were fantastic. The last time I was there, they came out on the look warm side, but this time they were perfect, and the black salt in the butter shot me over the moon, OY! What a combo. My cousin thought so too!\n\nWe both ordered the burger. She was wanting a grass fed burger, and there it was right on the menu! It was very good, I wouldn't say amazing, but very good. The onion was a little much, literally a solid inch thick wheel of (baked?) onion. It bothers me when restaurants put too much onion on a burger, it's a cheap way to fill it out, but can completely overpower the balance of the rest of the ingredients. Good thing about onions is that they are easy to remove.\n\nWe finished off with the S'mores dessert. This was very good, topped with a couple of dried pair slices and I think it was cinnamon ice cream. The chocolate cream pie i had last time was better, but the S'mores was an interesting choice and I wasn't disappointed.

The place was almost empty and even when we wanted a later reservation they said there was none even tho there were plenty of tables left empty even at 6:30. \n\nWe started with a beef tartare that was served with chunks of popover. They should have used something else because you also get a popover with butter when they seat you. The beef was in bigger chunks and wasn't as minced as you would typically find in other places and the favor was just ok, not horrible but wasn't the best I've tasted.\nThe second appetizer was the french fried oyster with a cauliflower sauce was a much better dish. The sauce was a little tart but complimented the oysters well. The oysters were nicely battered with good flavor even by itself while the inside was almost semi-raw. I think this dish was my favorite. \n\nOur entrees consisted of their famous fried chicken and we also got a half lobster from the raw bar. The chicken was nice and juicy inside although the outside could have been a tad crispier. It also seemed like they used the same batter as the oysters but thankfully it wasn't bad. I understand restaurants would reuse the same ingredients in different dishes to save on time and resources. \nThe lobster we could have done without as it was a super small portion and didn't seem as fresh and crunchy as anticipated. Glad the chicken dish was large enough to fill us both up.\n\nWe didn't order a dessert so they gave us two pieces of complimentary of pate de fruit which was a nice surprise. \n\nThe decor was very nice, dark wall paper and paint with gold accents, vintage decor & dim lighting gave off a cozy and warm vibe. This is definitely gave off a nice intimate ambiance but beware as some of the tables are relatively close to one another making it a bit intrusive to have a private conversation/dinner. \n\nUpon paying and leaving they nicely box up your leftovers and give you a ticket to pick it up downstairs, very fancy. Only problem we had with this was that I accidentally lost the ticket under a dessert plate and spent a good 5 mins looking for it. Even though we managed to find the ticket we got home and to our surprise they  had given us someone else's leftovers...total fail....\nWe were so disappointed the next day when we wanted to finish off the juicy fried chicken. So check your food before leaving.\n\nSo all in all this place wasn't bad but I don't think it was memorable enough for us to come back when there are so many other restaurants in the bay area to try.", "author": "Bunnie L."}

I made a reservations on OpenTable but you can't a reservations for 1  person so I made it for two and when I checked in I told the manager that I was by myself and I'll just sit at the bar and not occupy any of their tables.  She said great and thanks for letting us know.  About 30 seconds later I got a notification from OpenTable that my reservation was cancelled!  I guess she was trying to save the restaurant $2 for cancelling my reservations.  Moving on, I ordered a martini and the bartender actually asked me if I would like 2 or 3 olives which I thought was a nice gesture and of course I ordered 3 and received my martini with 2 olives (no big deal!) but why ask if you're not going to listen?)\nMoving on to lunch I ordered the red beet and cranberry cured hamachi crudo it was very dry and very small about 3 ounces all together for $18 . The avocado salad was excellent both in presentation and taste but again too small $13 and I had to wait for a fork to eat it with for a very long time, I flagged down the pm manager to see if he could get me a fork and he made in his opinion a funny joke to the bartender about how he's told him a hundred times that this was not finger-food.  I wasn't laughing!  The grilled prime skirt steak was way overcooked, awful taste and presentation $36. I simply had to return it the.  The manager told me that it was a thin cut steak and that is why it was over cooked!  Really? Thank you for making feel like an imbecile!  You sure did prove me wrong Ms. manager!  The bartender said that she would comp the wine and I told her that there was nothing with the wine and she can go ahead and charge me for the wine and remove the steak from my bill.  Wine that was good $14 steak that was bad $36 I guess one can see what they were trying to do. By the way it took exactly 47 minutes to receive bread and once it arrived it was Yorkshire pudding, I must say it was probably the best Yorkshire pudding I've ever had in the U.S. but I was surely not expecting to be served Yorkshire pudding when I asked for bread!  Needless to say that I would never return to this god awful place nor recommend it to anyone!\nDuring my entire meal, staff including managers were congregating in the corner of the bar and having what appeared to be great conversations.", "author": "Alex N."}

My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken which was also amazing, the meat was nice and tender and almost fell off the bone which personally I liked. The seasoning was on point and being someone that always has to have some kind of sauce with fried chicken found it perfect on its own. People have complained that the tables are close which don't provide much privacy but I didn't see this as a problem, the tables were pretty close but we were seated near some lovely ladies who talked to us from time to time which I actually liked even though I was with a date.

The menu has asian accents and a significant selection of raw items, but entrees definitely skew towards the heartier fare with the chicken apparently being a standout.  Other favorites were the deviled egg delights and the lobster bisque with corn.  \n\nWe had a huge assortment of food including a number of the oysters, uni app, delicious vino (oops at lunch) with a wine list to die for, hamachi crudo.  The restaurant was also very accommodating as I was wavering between a couple salads and they allowed for modifications, deletions and editions.  \n\nI definitely enjoyed myself and for the high rollers there is an amazing private room on the second floor.  The private room doubles as a dining table which can later be converted to after hang out with pool table (converted from the dining table).\n\nIf you are looking for fun inventive local organic pub fare, Wayfare Tavern is top notch.

I loved how the acidity of the pickled carrot cut through the rich curried egg yolk for a more complex bite.\n\n-Best Steak Tartare I've ever had! This was definitely my favorite dish of the night. Served with a raw egg yolk that you mix in yourself, the beef was exceptionally creamy and undoubtedly top quality. It was perfect with the garlic popovers.\n\n-The Organic Fried Chicken was fried to perfection - perfectly crispy skin on the outside and juicy, succulent meat on the inside. It retained its crunch even when the meat became a little cold! Amazing! Although some have complained about the amount of rosemary used in this dish, I thought it was seasoned perfectly.  \n\n-We ordered Baked Macaroni & Cheese to go with the chicken. Nothing too special here, but the dish was done well and the crispy bread crumbs on top added nice texture. \n\n-For dessert, the Summer Berry Shortcake was good, but a little on the tart side for me.

A large room, rustic but with high ceilings and large windows adding some levity to the taxidermy, wood, and leather the service at Wayfare Tavern was professional if not friendly and after brushing aside no less than three suggestions to order wine or a cocktail I placed my order and within moments was enjoying the first of two buttery popovers served with salted butter that, had I not limited myself could have easily turned into a half dozen.

I bit the bullet and came here on a Thursday night around 9 because I needed to try some Tyler Florence fried chicken before 2014! \n\nEven though we had reservations, they were running a little behind. The hostess kindly walked up to us while we were waiting and offered us a free appetizer, which was totally unnecessary of her since it wasn't even that long.

It felt like we were dining in a fancy cabin! For starters, we ordered the kobe tartare and the french fried oysters. Yes, beef tartare in general is not the most visually appealing dish in the world. If you eat with your eyes, this might not be the best choice but if you were to make an exception once in a while, I think it's worth it in this case. The dish had many good elements to it, including a slight hint of anchovy that gave it a fun kick. \n\nFor the entrees, we shared the fried chicken and the scallops. The way I would describe the fried chicken would be that it tastes like it was in a rotisserie covered with rosemary and herbs and then breaded afterwards to add the fried chicken effect. Either which way they did it, it works and I'm sure they will keep this dish on their menu for a long time until the next chicken famine. The scallops were cooked well and the flavors worked nicely together. The mini sweet potato biscuits that I've never had before added an interesting texture to the dish.

And I'm glad that I finally got to cross it off my restaurant Bucket List, but unfortunately I wasn't as thrilled about it as the other 4 and 5 star reviewers. I started with the mushroom Poutine which I had no idea meant french fries...The sauce for it was okay, it was the only thing besides the deep fried potatoes that had some sort of flavor to it.  \n\nFor the entree, I had the scallops which came 4 to a plate and it was advertised with sweet potato biscuits which came 5 to a place and were a hair smaller than the size of a quarter. The scallops were seared on one side which left a skin-like texture on the rest of the scallop. I've never considered being a vegetarian, but after trying to chew on what felt like skin, I'm considering it... Also, the scallops reeked of that \"fishy\" smell and good fresh seafood should smell like the ocean. If I'm going to spend a little more for 4 scallops ($29) then I expect at the very least, fresh ones.  Since a few people dining that day ordered the scallops, the whole restaurant stunk like Chinatown's open markets.  \n\nThe evening ended with the brown butter cake dessert. I didn't think I'd be able to finish it after ordering, but fine dining portions allotted me a total of 2 bites of the cake and all its accessories (a custard and a spoonful of ice cream) in a single fork full. My sister shared the other 2 bites. As an experienced baker, the cake was exceptionally disappointing. It was over cooked and packed with butter to hide its, otherwise, dry texture.  \n\nWhat I enjoyed was the cocktail. But I wouldn't stop by for another one if I were in the neighborhood. \n\nAs for the service, it was incredibly slow. I didn't believe the reviews that commented on the same issue, but no they were right.

Reservations are definitely needed and lunch reservations are much easier to get than dinner.\n\nWe started off with two orders of the Steak Tartare.  I ordered the Steak Frites, and my friends ordered the Wayfare Burger \"Le Grand\" w/ Sunny Side Up Petaluma Egg, Organic Fried Chicken and Pot Roast.\n\nThe Steak Tartare was delicious.  It came with garlic toasted popovers which you could stuff with the tartare...very tasty.  My steak was cooked just right....still pink and juicy.  The fries were crispy and very plentiful.  I go to try my friend's fried chicken and it was cooked just right so the chicken was still juicy.  They give you a heaping pile of chicken, so it would be a good dish to share.\n\nThe service was good.  The food was brought out quickly, and the staff was very attentive.

The salads were lovely and delicious, but the \"famous\" fried chicken was sort of strange. The boneless breast portion was pretty good, nice and crispy. The leg, however had a sort of funky texture and flavor. Gave the 2 wings to the hubby, who said they had very little meat. \n    Hubby had the burger, served much rarer than the \"medium\" he ordered, and while he said it was very good, it wasn't $20.00 good. He is no stranger to spendy burgers in nice restaurants, and this one was far from a fave. \n    The charred broccolini had a bizarrely intense SMOKE aroma and flavor- I mean, we get it, it was grilled/charred, whatever. But this tasted so weirdly charcoal-ish- hubby wondered if they had actually smoked it???\n     Thankfully, the strawberry-rhubarb cobbler was delicious, though when we asked to sub vanilla ice cream for the proposed FENNEL (really?), they only had BUFFALO MOZZARELLA VANILLA GELATO. Please! Thankfully, it just tasted like vanilla. \n    I have always liked Tyler Florence on the food network- he seems like a good chef and sort of a down-to-Earth kinda guy, but I think he needs to step up his game a bit on the food, and not rely in his name when setting menu prices. Seriously, the flatiron steak on the menu is $39.00! Tyler, the food needs to be better to price it like this!", "author": "Margaret O."}

The place is really lovely, lots of dark wood, a fireplace in the back, a small bar in the front and the \"chef's table\" in the back that is basically a counter where you can sit and watch the food being crafted.\n\nI took my seat at the \"chef's table\" (perfect for a party of 1) and began to review the menu.  My server was just delightful and she popped over and starting suggesting things left and right which is just the way I like it.  Having heard about the amazing \"fried chicken\" and macaroni and cheese- I threw my diet to the wind and ordered that with abandon, along with 6 oysters to start.\n\nBut even before I could eat my appetizer, someone came over with bread for me which was the most amazing popover ever.  Delicious!  And if you don't say no, they will bring you another and another so plan ahead as the real food stars of the evening are still yet to come!\n\nThe oysters were as expected but when that chicken came out- I was pleasantly surprised as this was a lightly battered, boneless moist, pieces of chicken unlike any fried chicken I have had.  And that mac and cheese?  I had to force myself not to eat the entire dish.\n\nAnd although the dessert menu looked tempting (the special that night was a Boston Cream pie, the guy next to me offered me half of his as he couldn't finish it but it looked delicious!) by now I had eaten enough food for two days and I needed to walk the 15 blocks back to my hotel to justify it.\n\nThe prices are reasonable for the quantity and quality of the food that you get.  Dinner ran me about $65 including a couple of drinks, appetizer, entree and side.  And the space is just lovely albeit it has the vibe of a pub so don't expect a quiet, romantic dinner.  This place has an energy and the noise level to accompany it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-03-15", "description": "Where to begin...\n\nIt was my wife's birthday last night and I wanted to go to a special restaurant to celebrate.  Knowing that this restaurant is hard to get a reservation (made mine a month in advance), I am expecting a 'well oiled' machine due to the volume and good reviews from fellow yelpers, although it was anything other.  \n\nMy wife and I had the WORST dining experience ever at Wayfare Tavern last night. \n\nThe evening started off nicely in that we were several minutes early for our reservation and I was expecting to grab a drink at the bar to wait.  This was not the case, they sat us down immediately upstairs.  Once we sat is when everything went to hell.  Our server was the worst and ruined that evening for us.  We needed to wait roughly 15 minutes for our server to come to the table to greet us and ask if we needed a drink.  Both of the drinks once received were great.  My wife had red wine (forgot the name) and I had the cucumber mule.  Then it was probably another 15 -20 minute wait for him to take our starter order.  Once he finally came back to our table to take our starter order, my wife and I should have known to put in our entree dinner as well.  But we were still debating what to order since all of the items sounded so good.  Its never a good sign when your appetizers come to your table and you still have the menus.  Well that happened to us.  We needed to place our entree orders with the person who delivered the starters.  We also mentioned to her that it has been an extensive amount of time waiting for our server.  We ended up ordering the potato chowder which was amazing and they also pre-split the starter for us, which was a nice touch.\n\nMy wife and I finally decided to go with the burger and fried chicken.  I went towards the fried chicken because the server (when he was around) said that they could make the dish \"all white meat\" because I am not a fan of dark meat.  When our meals arrived, I immediately had order's remorse.  There was only 2 pieces of white meat chicken on my plate and the rest was dark meat.  The chicken was moist, but not the greatest fried chicken that I was told to believe from this restaurant.  The charred broccolini was delicious and the burger was amazing.  I felt so bad because my wife needed to share her burger with me because there was only two pieces of chicken for me to eat on my plate.  I wanted to tell the server of this mistake but once again he was MIA.  At the end of the meal when a person came to clear the dishes, my wife mentioned that the dish was wrong and immediately he scurried off.  In about another 10-15 minutes a gentlemen in a suit came by to discuss the goings on during our meal.  That was when my beautiful wife took charge and laid out everything that went wrong with the meal tonight.  The gentlemen apologized and wanted to see how he could make it better.  His attempt was great, but the experience we had during the night was too far gone to rectify.\n\nThough we mentioned to our server at the beginning of the night that it was my wife's birthday, it was not remembered by the server at the end of the night.  Unfortunately, there was no special attention given at all.  I am not expecting a lot for a restaurant to do for birthdays, but a small gesture would have gone a long way, especially when I see other tables have candled desserts coming out to their tables.  \n\nTo sum up the night, we had very high expectations for this restaurant maybe too high knowing that this place is owned and operated by a tv celebrity chef.  The restaurant didn't live up to any of our expectations.  The food and drinks were amazing and tasty, but the service aspect fell flat on its face.  I can honestly say that I will never go back to this restaurant.  I was a great disappointment and made it even greater that it was on my wife's birthday.  I guess I can't plan for everything.  Oh well, I need to think of next year's birthday dinner to make up for this ruined one.", "author": "Christopher M."}

My wife, her cousin (visiting from Minnesota) and myself all met for an early evening reservation for good bites and tasty drinks. It was the end of a long work week and the timing just could not have been better.\n\nThe parking gods were smiling as I found free street parking just a few blocks away. This in itself saved me a cool ten bucks as I did not have to valet my car. I walked inside my wife and her cousin were also arriving, I checked in at the front and were quickly seated at a nice table upstairs. I must say that whenever I go back, that I really do prefer sitting there verses downstairs. Upstairs is quieter, more intimate and the dining area much more open and less activity. Then again, if you like a more vibrant atmosphere, then downstairs might be your cup of iced tea.\n\nOur waitperson (I wish I could remember her name) immediately presented herself and handed us two of the most important things one could ever want on a Friday night..The wine and cocktail list! Of course we just had to start to evening off right and ordered a round of drinks before going into wine. My wife had a \"something something\" that eh, did not really wow me, my wife's cousin found a cachaca based drink that was kick ass great! For myself a Bulleit Rye Whiskey sidecar which was perfectly made and not too lemony. \n\nDeciding what to order could not have been easier. I have been attracted to the fried chicken beacon for months. My wife's cousin being a huge fan of fried chicken also ordered it as well. The one slight miss was when my wife went to order, she really wanted the steak frite, but I commented that \"you can get steak frite anywhere\" and at the last minute went with the ravioli made with seasonal vegetables. Now do not get me wrong, the dish was really good. But I just felt bad because I could tell that my wife had a serious case of buyers remorse, especially after seeing one of those plates of steak frites land on the table right next to us. Cooked to a perfect medium rare they use a trip tip that looked succulent and juicy. Our entire table kept eyeballing that plate throughout dinner hoping that slab of meat would some how come to life and walk over to us. And those frites looked out of this world perfect. \n\nThe chicken is just as awesome as advertised, the seasoning was perfect and packed full of flavor. But be warned the serving is HUGE! Two plates were way more than enough and we ended up taking home more than we ate and now have enough for three more meals. If the Donner party had our leftovers they could last 10 winters before having to take down one of their friends. \n\nThe side dishes came in with mixed reviews. The asparagus was a nice surprise with both my wife and loving it. The mac n cheese however disappointed both my wife and her cousin who thought it was too \"smoky\". I liked it, but then again anything with cheese is always going to score major heart points with me. \n\nThe desserts were amazing. The apple cobbler was gobbled down within a few seconds and the sticky toffee pudding fought hard to stay alive but by the end of the night was left to just a few sad crumbs. Both went well with our dessert wines.\n\nOur server was awesome and we could not have asked for better service. The ambiance is perfect and a great place to catch up with old friends. The pricing is a bit on the steep side ($300 pre tip) for a party of three. But if you limit your cocktail intake, order a lesser priced bottle of wine and split the fried chicken you can get out of there for a reasonable price.", "author": "Rene C."}

This Tyler Florence restaurant is an absolute staple in the food scene here in the Bay Area.\n\nUpon walking into the restaurant, there is a rustic, speakeasy, vibe that's plain swanky. The pre-prohibition-esque ambiance suits the restaurant well. As the menu centers around Tyler Florence's take on different American comfort foods, you will by no means leave here hungry. On the flip side, you're going to wish your stomach could hold more of the delicious eats!\n\nPopovers - This complimentary, fluffy, croissant-like, pastry is to die for! Something about these crunchy yet soft little things just keep you wanting to scarf down as many as humanly possible. Be careful not to get too full though, wouldn't want to spoil your appetite for the rest of the meal! I had two/three regardless. They're just too good!\n\nDeviled Eggs - On point! As other yelpers will attest to, the deviled eggs are a must here! I'm a huge fan. At least give them a try, pretty delicious.\n\nKobe Beef Tartare - Served with a garlic popover! The steak tartare comes with a raw egg yolk plopped in the center. Everything blends so perfectly together, from the egg yolk to the steak to the popovers. This unique combination of flavors definitely did it for me.\n\nOrganic Fried Chicken - As my main, I keep going back to the fried chicken. You'll see every other yelper talking this up too. I'm usually not a fan of white meat, but they keep this real juicy. With the rosemary, this chicken was perfectly seasoned. The crispity crunch on the breading is excellent, and you won't feel super heavy after consuming which is always a plus! I mean you'll probably want to take a nap regardless, but it's not too bad in my opinion. I would say this ranks up there as a close second to the fried chicken at Foreign Cinema (amazing). Still it's one of the best and you have to give it a shot!\n\nWayfare does it right! I would highly recommend it as a cool spot to eat at and to visit whenever you get a chance! You won't regret it!

Our waiter was more personable as the evening went on, but seemed very pre-occupied for most of the time.  Unlike most SF restaurants, I had to continually ask for a top-up of water.

The Chocolate Cream Pie and Summer Berry Shortcake were both delicious, though couldn't find the pavlova in the shortcake.\n\nThey need to add some fabrics to absorb some of the noise, it gets quite loud in there.

You can eat these babies with something savory, you could eat them with something sweet, no matter how you eat them they will have you wanting more! I had to refrain myself from getting more then three because I really didn't want to spoil my appetite. \n\nThe boyfriend and I started out with two cocktails, mine being the \"Beast of Burden\". Interesting name. I'm really not much of an alcoholic beverage fan, but after a couple sips of this, I was quite addicted. It's very mild and sweet and the taste of alcohol goes away after the third sip or so. \n\nWe shared the kobe tartare, the collard pea tendrils, the organic fried chicken, the 28 day dry aged ribeye, and the amazing Darlene's peach pie. First off, the portions here are huge! You definitely get what you pay for. The tartare is a MUST try for you tartare lovers out there! It was silky and super good. The collard peas were oh so buttery and delicious - probably sitting in butter to get that amazing texture, but still. The fried chicken was good - just not as amazing as the hype led on. It was just lightly seasoned and fairly simple. The 28 day rib eye is pricey for a reason. The beef is delicious and cooked to perfection, not to mention that it is perfectly accompanied by mushroom puree and roasted mushrooms. \n\nLast but not least was the Darlene's peach pie, which was a perfect ending to a splendid meal. The pie was everything a perfect dessert should be - balanced. The pie crust and dough was so buttery, orgasmic and flaky. Pie filling and peaches were tart and not too sweet, because that brown butter ice cream took it home with the sugar! If you were to choose any of the desserts, I highly recommend getting this while peaches are still in season! \n\nTo be honest, I didn't know what to expect at first...I mean,Tyler Florence, heh.  but the Wayfare Tavern has a grungy rustic charm that strangely made a romantic candle light dinner all too lovely.

I honestly couldn't decide whether I liked it or not because there was so little of it. Way overpriced at $14. Should have tried the deviled eggs or escargot instead.\n\nOrganic Fried Chicken - Had a taste of this as my husband ordered it. I was impressed with the flakiness of the batter and the tenderness of the chicken, but I'm not sure I could eat a whole plate of it. Which leads me to the next entree...\n\nWayfare Burger \"Le Grand\" - So glad I ordered this instead of the chicken! Probably one of the most satisfying burgers I've had (good thing because it was $19). I asked for the medium rare and that's what I got. Not a hint of dryness or toughness in the patty and ultra flavorful. Loved the cheese and bacon but loved the brioche bread the most. Best idea ever to flank their burger with brioche!\n\nShishito Peppers - A little on the salty side but not too bad. The peppers aren't all that spicy, but there is a tiny kick when you eat the seeds.\n\nBaked Macaroni & Cheese - Creamy, cheesy artery clogging goodness. That is all I have to say about this. I'm a sucker for good mac and cheese and this was goooooood!\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding - a little more upscale version than what I'm used to but man, delicious! It was very sweet, but I enjoyed this dessert thoroughly. Especially loved the dried figs on top and the ginger crumbles.\n\nOverall liked the ambiance of this place a lot. It's not uppity and has a very casual, laid back kind of atmosphere. Really liked the nice tilework too.

My family split almost everything so we could try all the sides. The mac and cheese was really rich. \nI had the yellowtail sandwich and it was pretty good. \n\nI really wanted to like this place. But the thing that makes me take away a star is the awkward feeling my party got after we left this place.\n\nThe menu and website says that they add 20% tip for parties of 6 or more. So when the check came, my father who was too happy celebrating paid and signed the bill, not checking the details. As we were leaving, I could see our server looking very unhappy as he was talking to who I assume was the manager. My dad went to check to see what was wrong and he said we did not tip him. My dad said he thought it was 20% already. The waiter said that it's discretionary. Really? Since when? I have never had this happen to me. So of course my dad apologized and changed it. But it just left a weird taste in all of our mouths. \n\nAnd honestly, the service wasn't even that great. He did not check on us. And never smiled. Not once. He didn't ask if we were celebrating anything and he was just cold.", "author": "Melissa T."}

So our expectations were high coming in. Fortunately (and surprisingly), the chicken didn't disappoint! The chicken was so tender it didn't even taste like it was fried (in a good way). The skin was crispy, but not to the point of crunchiness. In fact, it had this way of melting in your mouth. Strong rosemary and lemon taste. I can't say for certain it's the best fried chicken in the city, but definitely the best I've ever had.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the Poutine fries. Just think a gourmet version of chili cheese fries but infinitely better. It's fries topped with braised lamb and cheese. Amazing taste. And not too greasy either.\n\nDessert was the peach pie. It wasn't just a slice; it was actually a miniature whole pie. A bit heavy on the crust in my opinion, but still very good. It's topped with butterscotch ice cream, which totally made the dish. \n\nIt's a very classy environment. The lighting is dim, and even the Victorian decor has an old, dark oaken tone. Despite all that, it's actually a very lively place, with a lot of chatter. Service was also amazing, with waiters coming by every couple of minutes.\n\nGreat place for any casual meal (though kind of pricy). I know I'm definitely going back.", "author": "Richard Z."}

Simple, yet delicious with a slightly upscale take on classic American comfort foods in a dark, but sexy and intelligent tavern setting.\n\nStart off with large, warm, puffy popovers (crispy, airy, flaky, and similar to a croissant). These are phenomenal, especially with butter. Our server asks if we want more and I can't say no, my already ecstatic taste buds won't allow it. I think to myself, \"bring me a whole basket of them when you return, please!\"\n\nShared plates: \n- Steak tartare topped with an egg and accompanied by sliced garlic toasted popovers. This was a pretty massive appetizer, very flavorful, excellent and served with more popovers...you kidding me!?! Smiles all around.\n- Poutine. Braised short ribs and mozzarella over a bed of fries. Very good braised short rib meat, though not the best I've had in recent memory. \n- Wayfare Burger \"Le Grand\" with cheese, a Petaluma egg sunny side up and smoked bacon in between a brioche bun and also served with a side of some tasty truffle fries. First of all, the burger with the egg was pretty massive. The burger patty and egg also had a very smokey taste throughout as if it had been cooked directly over a campfire. Simply sublime! One of the best burgers I've had. It was pretty magical. \n- Look out Foreign Cinema, the fried chicken served here is really good! Nice crunchy breading with noticeable herb flavors and moist, quality meat. Delicious. \n- Pineapple upside down cake with coconut ice cream and macadamia nut crumble. So many delicious desserts on the menu, but we chose this one based on the recommendation of our waitress. It was a very good rec. Warm, sweet and sticky with deliciously moist cake.  The coconut flavored ice cream and mac nut crumble complemented it very well, giving the old traditional American dessert some tropical flare.  Excellent dessert!\n\nTo say that the three of us left feeling full and satisfied would be the understatement of the year. I will be back and be back pretty regularly. They could actually count on a daily stream of revenue from me if only I could count on them to help front any future medical costs for clogged arteries.

Prior to actually making a visit to Wayfare, I was extremely excited and this place was really hyped up in my head and I wasn't disappointed.\n\nThe service was top notch.  The staff here were not only friendly but they knew a lot about the different beers and foods they offered, if they were lying to me they sure had me fooled.  ON TOTHE FOOD!\n\nPopovers - I've heard wonderful stories about the popovers, and I'm going to be honest, it's bread to me.  Yes it was flake, yes it was delicious, but in the end to me it's just bread.  It wasn't star of my meal.  \n\nEscargo - I don't have much experience with real quality Escargo, so I won't say too much about the dish.  It was good but it was very oily, seeing as it was smothered in a delicious butter and other fine herbs. \n\nOysters - Fresh oysters can't complain, until you get the tab for them :P\n\nSteak Tartare - OH MY GOD...notice not only did put that in all caps, but I chose to spell out OH MY GOD instead of using the acronym.  This was by far my favorite dish of the night, even if it was an appetizer.  The meat just melted in your mouth, well until you bit into the crunchy fried onions which was a wonderful addition in not only texture but also flavor.  I drool every time I talk or even think about this.  If you're a beef guy and eating it raw doesn't bother you, you will LOVE this dish.\n\nFried Chicken - I've heard so many things about this fried chicken.  Yes it was good, yes it probably was the best fried chicken I've had, but when I think of fried chicken I don't think fine dining.  But you definitely could notice the herbs in this dish and the chicken was perfectly cooked.  Overall, the dish is still fried chicken and to be honest I enjoy fried chicken from KFC, so you can judge it for yourself.\n\nPot Roast - I ordered the pot roast as my entree and it was delicious!  The gravy, the veggies, the potatoes and the pot roast itself was just absolutely splendid.  I can't say it stood out for me obviously because I don't remember it that much but I remember I enjoyed every last bit of it.\n\nBurger - My friend ordered the burger and I'm not going to lie, I wish I did the same.  I had one bite of the burger and I was reliving my moments with my beloved steak tartare.  If i went back I would definitely want to order the burger.\n\nPrice wise, I think the prices are fair.  The quality of food and service that I received definitely justified the whole in my pocket.  But clearly my party and I ordered more food than we really should have but it was worth it.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend Wayfare Tavern to anybody and I'm looking forward to the day I go back.

But his restaurant doesn't live up to the hype.\n\nSpace is a precious commodity in SF, and while I realize that, I don't always want to eat in my neighbor's lap.  Unfortunately, that's how nearly all the seating is at Wayfare Tavern.  I felt especially bad for the servers, who had to wedge in between tables to take orders and deliver dishes.  Speaking of, our server was fantastic.  He offered great recommendations and was always pleasant.  I wasn't a fan of the manager, though, because she came to both tables on each side of us and gave them a complimentary order of the deviled eggs.  We had already ordered them, so I understand that she didn't bring us more of them, but maybe they could have taken ours off the bill?  Or offered up something else?  I mean, I felt like the kid left out after watching everyone else get special treatment.  And since we were all sitting up close and personal, I can assure you that these people didn't do anything to earn the freebies.  :|\n\nAs for the food, the deviled eggs were pretty good, but my mother-in-law's taste better.  The fried chicken had nice flavor, but it wasn't very hot or crispy.  Parts of it looked pink, but the texture felt cooked so I ate it anyway.  My fiancee ordered the filet with onion rings.  He loved it, but again, temperature was an issue.  Also, it was heavy on the onion rings and light on the meat, despite being nearly $30 bucks.  Everything tasted like it rested too long or was sitting and waiting for a food runner.  \n\nThe absolute stand-outs were the hot popovers and the peach pie.  Both were hot (which apparently isn't easy to do at this place!), and they kept the popovers coming.  As for the pie, peach is not my first choice when it comes to pie, but I'm so grateful the waiter told us it was not to be missed.  He was so right!  It came out whole, but a mini-pie, enough for three to four people.  We shared half and saved the other half for breakfast.  The crust was perfectly cooked, flaky and tender, and dusted with a hint of ground sage and sugar.  Interesting and tasty!  The brown butter ice cream on top was also complex in flavor and fantastic.\n\nOverall, I'd say go, but maybe just for drinks and dessert?", "author": "Sara A."}

I have been waiting for a perfect time to dine here and, luckily, a reservation opened up around my friend's birthday. \n\nWe arrived right on time for our reservation and was seated upstairs. I noticed that the seating upstairs is a bit more private and quiet while seats downstairs, because close to the bar, is a bit more casual and loud. Our waiter was initially helpful and came around very frequently when we were deciding what to order and did help us out with some selections. \n\nI'm not going to add any fluff to this review. Basically, the food was extremely overpriced and like spruced-up diner food. The fried chicken was juicy but, in all honestly, just slightly better than KFC. I must agree with fellow Yelpers that squeezing lemon over the chicken is recommended. My friend's pot roast was tender but the flavors just weren't there. Our side of mac 'n cheese was bland. Extremely disappointing considering we ordered the \"top two\" entrees on the menu. The popovers were probably the highlight of my night, but that's not saying much. They were hot, eggy, and went well with the creamy butter that was provided. At the end of dinner, we also ordered the Chocolate Hazelnut cake which came out hot but wasn't very impressive. \n\nWe also ordered a bottle of wine and after pouring the first glass for us, our waiter ceased to come by and we had to pour our own wine for the remainder of the evening. Our water glasses were filled frequently by the busboys though. \n\nThe final nail in the coffin was the fact that the restaurant did NOTHING for my friend's birthday. I SPECIFICALLY mentioned when I made reservations that we were celebrating his birthday. We did not get a birthday greeting or even so much as a candle on our dessert plate. EXTREMELY disappointing. I'm glad we already had a previous birthday celebration for him or I'd be SERIOUSLY upset. When we walked downstairs to leave, I saw that a waiter was bringing a dessert with a candle to a patron at the bar and singing \"Happy Birthday.\" I know I've said it many times but I'll say it again: disappointing. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend eating here and I will not be back ever again.

Good food, attentive staff and a comfortable old world ambience make for a very comfortable lunch or dinner.\n\nHaving popovers brought to the table instead of bread is a nice change from the normal. The long running highlight of the menu is the steak tartar, one of the best in the city. It is also served with popovers and herb butter, which again is a nice change from the usual toasted bread slices. The poutine was also very good.\n\nFor main dishes they change the menu just enough to make it worth coming back every few months. The ribeye was extremely flavorful but overcooked on the edges. The chicken paillard disnt stand out when compared with the other dishes.\n\nThey have a good wine by the glass section and I've always been pleased with any cocktail I order. The overall atmosphere and attitude is classy without being pretentious or overly artist.", "author": "Michael S."}

The place is beautiful and the service is great, the food is spectacular! The oxtail poutine was so good, if I go back I will eat it again. The meat is so soft and the gravy and cheese, ooooh! The kobe beef tartar was also excellent. I was hesitant to eat raw beef, but the flavor is so amazing, I couldn't stop. Perfect on the garlic popovers. The popovers were eggy and soft and way better than bread at the table! The organic fried chicken with rosemary was also really good! The broccolini was flavorful and a healthier choice.

The lunch time crowed was suits and power lunches, except us who were in jeans enjoying catching up siting at one of the outside tables.\n\nThe bread was awesome, airy and yummy, be careful and don't fill up.  We then ordered the deviled eggs and steak tartar.  Both were yummy, although the steak was amazing, nice flavor, not bland and had some acidity to cut the richness.  The eggs were great too but nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nFor my entree I got the fried chicken, I have to say I was disappointed.  It was not crispy, the butter knife did not really cut it and there was nothing else on the plate, I would have liked some vegetables, something to accompany it and make it less boring.  This was also a recommended dish so it was even more lame that it wasn't good. The other dishes at the table were the burger, Thai snapper and smoked salmon, which everyone loved.   \n\nFor dessert we had the red velvet cake, which was also amazing and some coffee.  \n\nAll and all I would give this place another chance, but given the prices of the entrees, I want to expect it to wow me.", "author": "Inga W."}

It's a total win, in my book.\n\nAwesome ambience - kind of dark, with typical rustic \"tavern\" touches but also elegant with vases of fresh flower arrangements and other details that give it a warm, inviting vibe. \n\nNice wine selections, to start. We each ended up ordering 2 glasses of the Blue Slate Riesling. It's like biting into a crisp Granny Smith apple in the middle of Fall - so do yourself a favor and get a bottle, ok!? It just makes more sense that way.\n\nPopovers - served immediately when sat. warm, buttery, almost croissant-like.\n\nButter Lettuce Salad - light, fresh. Perfect starter.\n\nAs a party of four, we ordered the filet, the fried chicken, the burger, and the halibut. I ordered the burger (couldn't resist after I saw one come floating out of the kitchen) and added a sunny side up egg...it was amazing. Love the house aioli and fries, too. The brioche bun was soft and buttery, with melty brie, and the produce was fresh. It was the perfect burger. My mom's filet was tender and cooked to perfection, and my sister's fried chicken (the house specialty) was crisp, not greasy, with a bright squeeze of lemon juice on top. Didn't snag a bite of the halibut but in my humble opinion, skip the fish dish and go for the comfort food, because that's what Wayfare Tavern is known for! For sides, we shared the collard pea shoots and the mac n cheese - both equally outstanding. Everything was so good.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the peach pie, which came out literally as a small whole pie, with sugared rosemary on top and a scoop of brown butter ice cream. Warm, gooey, fresh and juicy. All the flavors of summer enveloped in a thick, buttery crust. The rosemary added a fantastic element of surprise - it almost tasted like the holidays... comforting and homey with a pine-like flavor.\n\nI'm craving all of the above, right now, and I just went there last night for dinner. To me, that's what 5-star restaurants are made of. Wayfare Tavern serves up a memorable meal that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy. Awww.", "author": "Kristen S."}

Ordered the half dozen oysters, foie torchon, fried chicken, and the salmon. First sign of trouble was the fact that our waitress disappeared somewhere between the foie and the entrees.  Second was that it took from time of order to our entrees over an hour and a fifteen minutes...now I understand coursing out a meal but that seems a bit ridiculous no? Well...after we lost our server our entrees came (finally), and we were starving. Fried chicken was great, though the breast pieces were a bit dry...but overall really good. The salmon that the fiance got...well that was a salt lick disaster. Salmon was salty, and combined with the salty beans...it just read as salt. No servers checked on us so I waved down a server and asked them to take the salmon back since it was too salty. Server asked us if we wanted something else and recommended the scallops, so we went with that. Came out and guess what? Was still SUPER salty. At this point we were just reeling from the salt, and by this time, had also made friends with the table next to us we also had a super salty ceasar salad. We donated a scallop for them to try and they agreed...also salty.\n\nAnd the icing on the cake? When we got our check they had removed the salmon, but added the scallops (which was two more dollars). The two bucks didn't piss me off, but the fact that no one came back to check on us, and the fact that just on principal they charged us more for another salty dish really makes this place a \"avoid at all costs\" type of establishment. Now I agree, this is a bit of a harsh review on a crazy night like Valentines day...but if you're gonna charge me more for my meal, I expect more from you, it's as simple as that.", "author": "David H."}

Good thing about this place is that it is one of the few restaurants that is actually open on the holiday. The environment was perfect.. nice enough for a date, and not somewhere you have to whisper or completely hold your composure. \n\n*pictures provided*\n\nStarters:\n1) Kobe tartare: GET IT! 5/5\nOk warning, this consists of rare meat and a rare egg, so if that doesn't fly by you then don't get it. But I will also say that I am not usually a fan of rare meat or rare eggs, but THIS was an exception. It is slightly on the salty side, but because you eat it with the pop-overs, it tones it down a lot. Definitely recommend you try! \n\nEntree:\n1) Fried chicken: 4/5\nWorth trying since everyone is all raving about it, but it isn't something to DIE over. The chicken is VERY tender and juicy, it is actually really good. There is enough chicken to feed two hungry men haha.\n\n2) Pork chop: 4/5\nAnother decent size portion. They are very generous with their meat! Their pork chop is actually juicy, unlike many restaurants. The dish comes with these small grilled onion balls which are soo good! I would give this dish a try as well. Slightly on the more oily and salty side again, but nothing to complain about.\n\nSide:\n1) Asparagus: eh.. can do without\nOur waiter actually recommended us getting something light on the side to weigh off the heavy dishes.. the asparagus didn't really do that. I mean it was good, but something I could've gone without. \n\nDessert:\n1) Goat cheese panna cotta with smoked honey ice cream: GET IT! \nMy boyfriend and I didn't want to just eat the typical desserts like red velvet cake or chocolate cake. Those you can get anywhere. We decided to try the panna cotta. We DID NOT regret getting this at all. Despite being full off everything, there was room for a light/medium dessert such as the panna cotta. The smoked honey ice cream WAS DELICIOUS!! I was sad that the portion was a bit small. The panna cotta portion though, was enough to feed 3-4 sweet tooth girls. Worth trying definitely! \n\nOverall: \nOur waiter Jason was awesome. He gave us our space but also gave us great recommendations. My boyfriend and I literally sat in the restaurant for 3 hours, and we were never once rushed even as the restaurant got quite busy. The ambiance was PERFECT. If you're looking for a place for a date but not somewhere that is super fancy to the point that you have to whisper, this is the place! The bar area downstairs is more rowdy, and upstairs is more of a quieter spot. But even so, it isn't quiet to the point that you need to be conscious about what you're saying.\n\nMy only complaint is that I called in earlier before my reservations and told the restaurant that it is my boyfriend's birthday so I had requested them to do something. I asked if they can either write a happy birthday note on a plate or SOMETHING and the front desk said \"oh yes yes of course, i'll put in a note for you\". NOTHING happened. I was so disappointed! I waited after our entree plates were cleared, when our dessert came out, and even when the check came out. NOTHING! I mean considering I, a GIRL, payed for the entire bill, you would think SOMETHING was up right? It's cool. Next time I'll just emphasize it a bit more that it is my boyfriend's birthday.\n\nDefinitely try though! I will come back again one day. ENJOY!", "author": "Annie T."}

The flavor and texture  of the octopus was hidden by the beans. \nSteak tartar. Nothing special at all. Under salted and a little too pasty.\nOrganic fried chicken. The only good thing I had. Moist and crispy with good flavor. \nFrench fries. Absolutely terrible, decent flavor but too much salt and very soggy. I get better fries at McDonald's. \n\nThe macaroni cheese. We were recommended the Mac 'n cheese by the waiter and a couple next to us and all I could take was a couple bites. this should be taken off the menu.

This rating should be zero stars.\n\nWe were really looking forward to a lovely dinner at Wayfare Tavern on a Saturday evening.  We had ok drinks, 1 ok popover, and a nice pear and endive salad.  But that's all.\n\nWe had to ask for cocktail refills, ask to order, ask for the specials, and ask where our meal was, or if our meal was ever going to come out. Thirty minutes into our dinner experience, we sat at an empty table, with no service or attention again.  No food.  No waiter.  No explanation.  Quite annoyingly, the tables 3 inches to each side of us had their drinks, dinner, dessert, coffee, check, and left while we waited for our meal.  \n\nSo, one hour and fifteen minutes from being seated, there was no acknowledgment or apology from anyone - waiter, floor manager, hostess, or manager.  There was no real awareness of what we had just experienced, and no discernable concern.  Even after we went downstairs to the hostess stand to ask for our check.  Or when the manager came to the hostess stand to inform us there wouldn't be a charge.  No one cared for feedback, or offered an apology of any kind. \n\nWe left after having been completely disrespected by a rude and indifferent staff. We are both in service industries, and we understand having a bad day.  But we have NEVER actually had to walk out of any restaurant mid-service. But we did.

The gravy used in poutine in brown veggie gravy and the curds are never mozzarella. The gravy in this version was just pieces of oxtail. Even the fries were too slender and small to be real poutine fries. It was bland, boring and overprices.\n\nThe Grilled octopus salad was a hunt for tiny bits of octopus in stew of undercooked beans. It tasted ok but was so oversalted that it was impossible to finish.\n\nThe deviled eggs looked good and were creamy but so bland, it didn't even seem like I was eating an egg, one of the most perfect foods in the world.\n\nAnd the fried chicken, the crust was nice, the portion was good but there was so much rosemary which at first I loved but quickly overpowered my sense of taste not to mention the meat on the leg was seriously undercooked.

From the moment we walked into the Wayfare Tavern, we felt like we were in London in a pub. Really cool details and an awesome bar downstairs. When it was time for us to be seated, we were led up the giant staircase in a building that seemed very old and was really nice! We got a table for two set apart from everyone else which I thought was just perfect. I started off with the watermelon mojito which was to die for. Chunks of watermelon and lots of mint leaves. Next, a man came to our table with a wooden basket of fresh, warm popovers. Man, they were hotter than a fever! Fantastic!!!! For my appetizer, I ordered roasted corn and lobster soup. One tablespoon of this soup had more taste than all the corn in a field! My boyfriend had the hearts of palm and avocado salad. For our entr\u00e9es, we both decided on the ahi tuna. It was melt in your mouth excellent! It had a salted caramel glaze, very, very light. The potato and tomato accompaniments were fabulous! In the middle of the dinner, Tyler Florence came up to our table and asked if we were having a good night. I admit I was a little starstruck! My boyfriend told him we were having a great evening and he told us to enjoy. Wow! The added bonus of The Boss himself! And he wasn't there just to greet diners at the tables. He was working. A great surprise to see him! An even better surprise that he stopped at the table. Dessert was the end of a glorious meal. We had warm doughnuts with three different dipping sauces. The donuts were gigantic and you got two of them along with two donut holes. The dipping sauces were raspberry jelly, peach pur\u00e9e, and whipped coffee cream. Seriously, the best dessert ever. The service was phenomenal and unlike any I've ever had in any other restaurant. I'm originally from Philadelphia and spent a lot of my days at LeBec fin. This meal was way better than that. We will absolutely return to the Wayfare Tavern and have been telling all our friends to try it. It truly was a fantastic find and absolutely not overrated. If anything, it's underrated.", "author": "Sandra P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-26", "description": "Love this spot! I've done lunch, dinner, and group events here ~ all rose to the occasion.\n\nI'll start with the fact that this place is my favorite burger as of now. I've had amazing ones from Paris (Vegas), Sauced in Livermore, Art at the Four Seasons in Seattle and from the W that used to be in Newark. Tyler Florence's rendition holds the crown as champ - any upsets would mean you'll need to read any following reviews: rewrites are for chumps that think a single visit review means something...\n\nThat said, I can let you know about my handful of experiences. Elaborating on the food to begin (other than the burger)... All the hype about the popovers, Mac & Cheese, fried chicken, deviled eggs, and tartare are well warranted!\n\nIf you don't love pastry then you probably hate pictures of lol cats, make your own memes, and SomeEcards. Popovers are the airy version of Yorkshire pudding without the roast beef grease: AMAZEfaced substitutes for your run of the mill sourdough or ciabatta. Mac & cheese is a hard to go wrong situation, right? I've had cold mac & cheese in a sandwich and still been all smiles. Wayfare's rendition is much like all the \"refined\" versions of the classics I've tasted, but the smoked olive oil is a great curveball. Yes, you might not call me a fried chicken expert but man is that stuff great! Herbaceous, juicy, crispy, and hot: what else would you need from some fried goodness? It's really great though. Salt and lemon to adjust the seasoning as you like (for you \"saltiness = flavor\" kooks) means this can be a somewhat interactive dish. While I don't eat eggs, I try stuff. The deviled eggs I tried had golden raisin, chicharon, and hints of curry: super interesting. My only gripe was the egg whites reminded me of why I don't like eggs ~ no shocker there! Lastly, I'll try and go a little deeper for the tartare...\n\nNow, I'm a beef lover. I take my steaks medium to rare (depending on the cut) so the first time If had tartare was at the Wayfare: Family Style! Yup. We had a large work group and all the dishes were prepared to serve a table of 10. Understanding the idea of tartare I was intrigued, but wary at the idea of a raw egg yolk being the 'dressing' to raw beef. This large portion was premixed and set alongside the garlic popovers. First tastes made the fresh herbs and tart dressing pop at the start, then the richness of both the meat & yolk overtook the palate, all tied together with an acidic finish.\n\nYup, apart from the burger this dish stood out the most to me. I've had it several times since and each was just as pleasurable. I will admit that I've had a better tartare, but anything with a Tagima F1 is a different league than a proprietary blend.\n\nOne recent callout would be the poutine. I've had poutine with duck & beef gravy, but Wayfare's version with vegetable gravy (surprisingly rich) and oxtail was divine richness... Poutine has definitely earned a a lot in my menu of guilty pleasures.\n\nAlso note that while they have a stellar dessert menu, I've got the kind of sweet tooth that disqualifies me from reviewing confections... Give me fresh donuts with amazing sauces and you'll get a giddy mouthgasming Dane. Prove to me that there is chocolate creme pie worth eating outside of Nations? I might follow your religion. Give me \"smoked\" honey cheesecake and I'll drink whatever your cult is serving...\n\nI'd agree with other reviewers that reservations are a great idea, as we barely got a table on a weeknight at 5pm.\n\nService has always been great. Having servers that are terrified to open champagne is ridiculously annoying, so to have a confident server that can both open a bottle and appropriately keep and break conversation will always impress me. In my eyes this is indicative of management that pays attention to detail: no surprise considering my observations of the kitchen. Watching an expediter send back fish destined for my seat (sitting at the counter) without discernible flaw again shows attention to detail.\n\nLong shorter: this should be on your SF must try list. Chicken, burger, and deviled eggs... It might sound like a picnic, but turning one into a gourmet experience is exactly what you'll get at Wayfare. This is worth a try or seven ~ do it and enjoy!!!", "author": "Dane P."}

I ordered a side dish of mac 'n cheese, a slice of pie, and two Diet Cokes, which cost me a whopping $29.00 (not including tip).  I admit that that the mac 'n cheese and chocolate cream pie were delicious!  However, the mac 'n cheese portion was tiny and not worth $9.00.  I was hungry again mere hours later.  Moreover, why does a slice of pie cost $11.00?  I was also disappointed to discover that there were no free refills on the soda.  I was pissed to discover that each Diet Coke cost me $3.50.  I basically spent $7.00 on two skinny glasses of soda.\n\nAnother gripe is the service I received.  The waiter was incredibly aloof and unfriendly.  I could tell he was annoyed that I only ordered a side dish, but perked up when I asked for a dessert menu.  Plus, I had to flag someone down for a popover.  When I finally got a popover, I was disappointed to discover that it was cold and sitting out for awhile.  I wanted a second popver, but my waiter never came back until it was time to pay the bill.\n\nI am happy I tried the Wayfare Tavern at least once.

I especially appreciated the cut of the chicken parts, made it easier than usual to get to the meat with less work/mess.  Mac and cheese was pretty good, but mostly just super rich.  A little boring actually.  My friends burger and fries was excellent per her report.\n\nTried a couple house cocktails, they were nice but did not register in the old memory.  Should have done beer/wine in hindsight.  The simple food and the elaborate cocktails didn't match for me.\n\nI was also hoping to find some non-super-rich side dish options and there were few.  A little more green would make me happier, but then this definitely feels like a place to splurge.\n\nGreat service, though correcting my mispronunciation of \"Financier Cake\" was annoying and I promised my companion that would cost them a star and go right into the yelp review.  Just kidding about the star, this place was great and I would go back.\n\nValet was efficient and just fine.

A friend recommended it, and by the time we tried to make reservations, they didn't have any for the night we wanted to go.  We decided to stop in anyways, and see what would happen.  I am always hesitant to go to celebrity chefs' restaurant after a weak experience at Mesa Grill.  I was going to be proved wrong.\n\nLuckily, we were able to get seated immediately upstairs.  The restaurant was very nice inside.  It was really nice without being pretentious.  My wife commented on the beautiful flowers they had arranged around.\n\nWe decided to order beers, but skip apps.  I had the burger, and my wife had the salmon.  We also ordered a side of mac and cheese.  The popover that they served was spot on.  Just thought I'd throw that out there.\n\nOur food was phenomenal.  I can't say it better than everything was expertly executed.  The burger was cooked medium, and the bacon and brie was just a real unique combination that worked.  The salmon was some of the best I've ever tried, and my wife still talks about it.  I commented to the waiter that the mac and cheese was just as good as we get in Wisconsin.\n\nWe opted for dessert, and got the peach pie.  What I didn't realize was that it was actually an actual pie, not just a slice.  It easily fed two people.  As a pie aficionado, I can say that the crust was flaky and filling awesome.  Also served with a scoop of brown butter ice cream.  They really knocked it out the park.\n\nOverall, a great meal.

For appetizers we shared the poutine, onion dip and fried oysters.  All were great, but I HIGHLY recommend the fried oysters!!!  Fresh, plump, juicy bits of goodness in a nice crispy pocket.  Soo good!\n\nI ordered the much renowned fried chicken -- soo much chicken!  You usually get about three pieces or so...this came with at least 5!  It was a little less crispy than I was expecting, but a lot of yummy herbs and great flavor.  I usually prefer dark meat over white meat, but I started with the white meat since it was less messy (it was a work dinner so I didn't want to go all caveman and pick up the drumsticks with my bare hands).  The breast was so juicy!!  In fact, I stuck with white meat the whole time and didn't even get to eat the drumstick and wing (too full at this point).  \n\nThe scallops also looked very delicious, and my companions seemed to enjoy their dish.  We also shared a mac n cheese.  Fine, but a bit too cheesy and rich for me.\n\nWe finished the meal with a chocolate cream pie and a doughnut to share.  The doughnut is quite good and comes with three dipping sauces.  I tried the pumpkin butter...fantastic!

But damn were we made to feel that way.  I think by the 5th time our waiter came to urge us to order food it was already annoying (this was over a span of 10mins). So we said ok, we can order drinks and appetizers. Our waiter responded oh well our chefs suggest to place full orders all at once. So basically, order F**king right now, but order everything now!!  And he was sure to remind us this very two minutes afterwards. Ok, thank goodness this was a business dinner, everyone kept a cordial and polite manner. The last straw however was after we ordered dessert and were enjoying the dishes we were urged to pay. My business partners felt bad and paid. But while we were finishing up, our waiter came came by, knocked on our table and said they should be hurrying up. I repeat-- HE KNOCKED ON OUR TABLE in front of our faces and basically told us to hurry the fuck up indirectly!!! Are you fucking kidding me??!?  That was the last straw.\nI called the manager over and told him politely but sternly that this was the worst service I have experienced and that he needs to address this with his staff to ensure that future patrons will have a better dining experience. The manager was very apologetic, but in my opinion in most establishments with such reps, some type of  discount or hospitality is shown when patrons have had such bad experiences. The assistant manager simply apologized and asked me well, what do you want me to do??--  You're kidding me right? I shouldn't need to ask. Y'all should know.\nI simply replied-- hey, you should know, but never mind. Just make sure to have a talk with your staff and make sure your service backs up the quality you guys boast.\nTo be quite honest, I don't remember what the appetizers, mains, and sides tasted like. I do remember that dessert was good and the drinks were on point. Also, when I asked about certain things on my plate, the waiter looked at me and turned away. This happened a few times.

From the hostess to the waiters / waitresses, nothing short of snobby and indifferent service. In no way felt welcomed. The exact opposite really, it was as if I was doing them a favor being at their restaurant. A smile, a personality, a simple hello glad to have you join us tonight, would have been better than nothing. Kept thinking during the dinner, do the staff really hate their jobs? Are they mistreated? Working conditions that bad? Did everyone just have a terrible day? Either the answer is yes, or the staff needs a serious education in friendly customer service.\n\nNext, the food. Started with the deviled eggs. Boring, simple and poorly made. If you love curry, you might like it, I found it awful. The Tuna dish was very small and also uninspired. Carrots served three ways with Tuna just does not work. The chef must like carrots and tuna, and decided gee, they would go great together. I like chocolate ice cream and oysters, does not mean they belong on the same plate. Carrots did nothing for the Tuna, and for the high price charged, expected a lot more.\n\nFinally, each of us ordered a coke and had a few refills. The glass was very small, maybe 5 ounces and filled with lots of ice. When we got the bill, we were charged $3.50 for each refill! The waiter never mentioned this when ordering. It is so rare for any restaurant to have this high a price in the first place for a coke, but than to charge for each refill? Says volumes about the restaurant and why you should never dine here.

If the meal was sublime, I'd happily pay $29 for a main.\n\nCocktail - maple sidecar.  Although I appreciate being able to order a sidecar, the maple twist on it just didn't add anything special.  Wine - a Merry Edwards Pinot Noir that was excellent, but expensive at $18.  Appetizer - the Spring Pea Soup for $12, which was exceptional!  Wish I could have taken a photo of how beautiful it tasted. Main - Pan Roasted Alaskan Halibut was overcooked, a bit dry, nice black eyed peas and pepper salsa (piperade), but the bacon aioli was completely unnecessary. Flavor can come from fresh, well-cooked ingredients, so mayo and other added fats should be superfluous.  Dessert - the Steamed Lime Pudding Cake was light in texture, with a nice contrast from the blueberry, but too sweet for my taste.  The intense odor of truffle oil was a problem as it was \"paired\" with every dish in an unfortunate way.  Very pretty, tho (see photo).\n\nIf I went back, I'd order the Pot Roast - everyone around me who had it  loved it.

Though I wasn't able to get a reservation (I decided at the last minute that I wanted to try to eat there), I had been advised by the hostess to either go very early, right when they opened, or later towards the end of the evening.  We got there at 5:15 and were seated at the kitchen counter where we could observe the chefs and ogle at the delicious dishes.\n\nThe thing I love about this restaurant is that it takes comfort food and kicks it up a notch, refining the flavors by using high quality, fresh ingredients.  It also takes typical fine dining items (foie gras, uni, etc.) and makes them accessible, tasty, and simple in a non pretentious way (similar to comfort food).\n\nFor dinner, you're given some sort of very egg-y, fluffy, crispy, airy roll, which is rich enough to skip the butter (though dabbing it with butter makes it quite delicious).\n\nI HIGHLY recommend the steak tartare appetizer (rich, savory), the FRIED CHICKEN IS A MUST HAVE (perfectly crispy outside with a slightly sour brine, complemented by the rosemary and lemon, juicy meat inside), and the burger (I got it topped with the optional egg).  The burger is humongous and tasty, though I would go for medium rare.\n\nThe mac and cheese is very decadent (think ooey-gooey cheese topped with truffle oil), as is the poutine appetizer (french fries with mozzarella and short rib, also topped with truffle oil).  \n\nThe interior is beautiful; very cozy and warm with dark woods and a fireplace.  Definitely evocative of a welcoming tavern.\n\nService was great both times...I also got to meet Tyler on my birthday!

This is as fine of a dining experience as I've had in recent memory. Everything is done so elegantly and exquisitely. I truly had a transcendental foodie moment.\n\nI came here for lunch one day because you know I'm fancy like that. My expectations were sky high, but Wayfare Tavern managed to take me to the heavens. This is not unexpected considering this is one of Tyler Florence's many restaurants. Okay I admit it, I didn't even know who he was until my best friend Google told me all about it. \n\nThe ambiance is uber-classy. This is your world class investment banker's favorite lunch spot. The decor is dark and rustic with a modern American charm. I especially enjoyed the various animal themed artwork and decorations.\n\nBut in the end, the food matters the most and at Wayfare Tavern the food here is otherworldly. For starters they bring out a piece of bread that is, well, puffy. The edges are crispy and crunchy, but the inside is hollow, which gives it a light and airy taste and feel to it. I've had some good bread before, but this is arguably one of the more memorable offerings. And this item was free! This was only the beginning. \n\nFor starters, my friend and I had the poutine and the smoked salmon. There aren't enough synonyms in the English language for the word nom nom to describe how delicious both these items were. The poutine is a bed of French fries topped with mozzarella, short rib and something heavenly called truffle gravy. This in itself is worthy enough to be called a meal. This is as decadent and as rich as french fries can possibly get. Again, truffle gravy!! What is this deliciousness?! If you can possibly believe it, but the smoked salmon was even better than the poutine. Imagine fresh pieces of salmon topped with caviar! Again, exquisite presentation and taste. These two starters alone were worthy enough to be called a lunch, but like true foodies (or true fatties same thing!) we continued on our delicious food journey.  \n\nFor the entree, I had the duck gumbo and my friend had the Wayfare burger. To be honest with you, I can't recall half the things that came with my gumbo. Duck confit something, with andouille sausage something, topped off with a whole lot of fancy stuff (like fried okra, at least I think it was okra). Pardon my elementary sentence formations, but this dish was way beyond my immature taste buds. To fully comprehend the flavors and complexities that make up such a fine dish requires a more mature palette. I am not worthy of such deliciousness. \n\nThe Wayfare burger, arguably the most expensive burger I've ever had, was cooked perfectly medium rare. This was a grass-fed this, roasted that and smoked something masterpiece. Talk about a juicy burger! Again, in terms of otherworldly, it's hard to use that adjective to describe a hamburger. On par with some of the best fancy burger offerings in San Francisco? Most definitely. Plus the side of fries were crispy and perfectly seasoned. \n\nUsually when I try a new place, I like to order dessert as well because honestly how often am I going to come back to restaurant of this caliber? But after eating all those above things I was stuffed beyond belief. Good thing this place has major replay value. I will definitely be back.\n\nIn the end, we all know that fancy food comes with an even fancier price tag. Lunch for two came out to be $100 after tip. $50 a person for lunch! Excessive? Probably. But still a nice every once and a while treat. In the end you are paying for exceptional quality. Treat yourself, you deserve it.", "author": "Allan Y."}

It was busy but we lucked on getting parking across the street from the restaurant.  There is valet, if you do not want to drive around to look for a spot.  We were early so that we can enjoy some drinks and I ordered the pear martini which was okay.  I enjoyed the Tavern Sour much better - which I ordered later on.  We had the grilled octopus and deviled egg salad as appetizers - both were very good.  Octopus tender and not overcooked.  My entree was the fried chicken which was very good - had crispy and flavorful skin and moist and tender meat.  For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cream pie and the donuts.  I didn't taste the donuts because I was too full and it looked like regular donuts from the donut shop except that it came with 3 different sauces.  It looked extremely sweet.  I did try the chocolate cream pie which I thought was delicious.  \n\nWe were seated at the booth downstairs which was across from the kitchen. The good - you can see everything that's going on in the open kitchen.  The bad - it was extremely hot and we were sweating like we were going through menopause or something.  Would suggest not sitting in that area if you do not like being hot and sweaty during dinner.", "author": "S L."}

Well here's a quick tip for you yelpers. Celebrate 2 occasions during 1 dinner.\nI reserved here in between the dates of Our 9th anniversary as a couple and V-day. We don't celebrate V-day so we just used it to justify the money we're spending. Plus I don't like to be surrounded by couples celebrating vday. So \"celebrate\" early.\n\nThe downer, we got here on time for our reservation but wasn't seated until about 20 minutes later.  We got seated infront of the kitchen, though it wasn't that comfortable, it was fun watching the chefs cook our food.  \n\nService was good but the busyness got the servers a little distracted.  On with the food.  Warning:  Arrive here with an empty stomach.  Food here is hearty.  \n\nWe ordered poutine.  Fries and gravy with some meat, yum.  I'm no Canadian so I don't know if it's close to the real thing.  Hubby ordered their fried chicken.  So moist, so herby so yumm.  Don't tell Thoma Keller, but I prefer Tyler's fried chicken than Addendum's fried chicken.  Close but I'm still thinking about Tyler's fried chicken.  \nNow I wish I can tell you what I ordered, it's either it's because it's been a year ago or it wasn't memorable.  I think it was short ribs or something.  But I preferred the fried chicken.   \n\nDessert, we got the pineapple upside down cake.  We wanted something a little bit lighter since we were so full, but uhh that wasn't light.  Too sweet for me, but the ice cream that came with it was good.  \n\nThis place was busy last year, not sure if it's  still busy until now.  But reserve early, come early.

This was my third time here and for the third time, we had to order the organic buttermilk fried chicken.  I cannot say how amazed I still am that it is perfectly hot and juicy and so good with a squirt of lemon even though I could definitely use some more fried sage with it.  Even though it doesn't come with a side, I don't think you really need it as you want to be able to eat every finger licking good piece of it.  \n\nUnfortunately I didn't plan well enough as everything is so good that before my chicken even arrived, I had 2 popovers which is the most memorable \"bread\" that you'll be served anywhere, the kobe beef tartare that I slathered on pieces of garlic popovers, and most of the poutine which is definitely a heavier appetizer.  Blame Kelly Ripa for getting me hooked on trying poutine wherever I can find it (which has only been 2 places in SF) ever since she had it what seemed like everyday on her remote.  For $14, this was an upscaled version of poutine which is fries, oxtail gravy, mozzarella curd since you can't get day of fresh curd from Canada over here, topped with shaved truffle which shines through and surprisingly pieces of meat within the dish (tasted like a short rib maybe).  Since I was already half full by the time entrees came out, I only had a bite of the pacific cod entree which I thought was a little too salty for me but since I ordered the fried chicken, it didn't take long to switch back.", "author": "Joyce Z."}

Our party of 7 was crammed into a booth that should only sit 4 people.  6 little people.  And then our 1 friend was given a seat at the edge of the table.  \n\nThe service was okay, but nothing stellar.  The food was tasty, but not mind blowing.  Oh, and that chicken that everyone talks about.. it's full of rosemary flavor.  I like to have my friend chicken just plain and simple.  Maybe a dash or rosemary and garlic would have been okay, but it was really strong.  The mac n cheese was too rich for me and the fish dish my friend ordered... it was so small that we had to go eat again after the show.  \n\nThe drinks were probably the star of the show.

One of my gf's commented that it was like dining at one's elegant (\"but not stuffy\" another gf chimes in) dining room.  The restaurant was dark, narrow and divided into  different sections. Main level is where the open kitchen is located  where you might  see Chef Tyler Florence in action if you are lucky like us.  Upstairs dining has its own  bar. \n\nSERVICE: Professional, efficient but slightly stoic.\n\nSOCIAL SCENE:\nThe place was packed with mostly mature  (30's and older) with some 20's nicely dressed holiday merry-makers.\n\nDRINKS:\nUm, we had quite a few. We had 10 between 4 of us. I wouldn't say who had how much but the drinks were nicely crafted and strong! We pretty much tried almost every mixed drink on the menu of about 5 drinks including MAPLE SIDECAR, LIEDESDORFF and dessert wines. \n\nI had the OCCIDENTAL  which  probably could also function as a horse tranquilizer. :)  Tangy and too strong for me but well-made, then  another glass of a nice Chardonnay. I was still intoxicated 5 hours later!  (I took the BART train home.)  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=nq5JR5tBdCyj3mPNRDYAHw\n\nSTARTERS:\nPOPOVERS: Complimentary hot, custardy pastries  instead of traditional baked loaf.  The server generously offered us more before our main dishes arrived.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=t3blBSvI_mV_OHKl7ma_Dw\n\nLOCAL FORAGED MUSHROOMS $8\nOlive oil & garlic. Oh, so simple yet so delicious! The mushrooms tasted earthy and fresh. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=e8FlsKs1Heve4ZVuxAmTwA\n\nGRILLED MONTEREY BAY CALAMARI $9 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=1JfwsAPNELj_4xeXQyDXIA\nToasted garlic, squid ink vinaigrette, smoked chili oil, breadcrumbs & celery. Another OMG! I didn't want to order this at first because I thought it was the greasy deep-fried kind. This dish was a delicious combination of garlic and spices.  The crunchy breadcumbs were a very nice addition. We really enjoyed this one! \n\nAUTUMN GREENS: A nice platter of  freshly picked green salad with Ricotta cheese.  \n\nMAIN DISHES:\nHANGTOWN FRY  $23-  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=t9K_xvwd4P2XodlMeM62AA\nA dying man's last meal: fluffy Petaluma eggs, crispy oysters, smoked bacon, Jack cheese, Sausalito watercress & potato hash. I've had this few times before at different places. This was the best I've had with the fluffiest egg omelette topped with tender oysters sans bacon.  This  was my dish as well as my friend H's.\n\nGRILLED SANTA MARIA TRI-TIP STEAK $26 - \nSlow roasted heirloom onions, truffle butter, crisp Kennebec potatoes. My picky carnivore friend J loved it!\n\nVEGAN \"CUSTOM MADE\" DISH\nOur friend A is vegan. She asked the server if the chef could make a custom made vegan dish for her.  She told them to just surprise her. And they surpised her with a nice dish of polenta with mixture of fresh veggies. Maybe Chef Tyler made this dish for her.\n\nDESSERT/DESSERT WINES:\nFRIED APPLE PIE $9 Orange caramel, sage ice cream.  We liked the apple filling but not fans of the crusty thick pie crust. The sage  ice cream with fried sage leaves were exotic and nice. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=GvgYOtHqgnHQ28syLmMsUw\nG1 TAWNY PORT $10 and  DOISY DAENE $18\n\nCOMPLIMENTARY GINGERBREAD COOKIES: Yummy and sweet touch! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=b77wnScrlJvVju8LEpXXjA\n\nOVERALL:\nChef Florence creates dishes that are are comforting and familiar but taken to the next level. They were delightful and not overwhelming  ambitious. The potions were generous that despite our hefty tab we had leftovers to take home. Prices are reasonable with $8 for starters and mains priced at less than $30. Our tab was because of all those drinks we imbibed but we had so much fun!! A definite must return for me!\n\nTAB: $360 including 10 drinks, tax and 20% tip. ($90 per gal.)\n\nCHEF TYLER FLORENCE: I didn't expect to see him but he was working and very visible in the open kitchen last  evening.  I had the biggest crush on Tyler when I used to watch him on the Food Network when he was still hot and single. He is still cute as I imagined. It was  pleasure to see him in action. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=_b4zmeNVhTmwcAf06o3JRQ\n\nWe were buzzed, happily fed, presents were exchanged and went home with plenty of holiday cheer to share with our hunnies.\n\n4.925", "author": "Leah E."}

Not only am I constantly day-dreaming about their food, but I always feel compelled to go out of my way and voice how AMAZING this restaurant is to every person I meet.  Everything I've breathed, seen, and tasted has been absolutely divine and nothing less than perfect.  Tyler Florence's ingenious creations will not disappoint your taste buds and won't empty out your pockets.\n\nWith such a soulful menu, it's only appropriate that the atmosphere and decor match this concept.  The brick and dark wood panels, inviting fireplace, and open kitchen emits warmth and comfort to every guest that enters.  If you're lucky, you'll get a glimpse of Tyler Florence himself when he happens to be cooking right before your eyes. \n\n***\n\nMy FALL Menu Experience:\n\n* POPOVERS - This is literally the best bread ever served!  If it was at all possible, I would buy dozens of these and eat them everyday!  Light and fluffy, yet somehow still flaky.  The hint of egg aftertaste is indescribably heavenly.  \n\n* CAESAR SALAD - Although seemingly simple, this is actually no average salad.  The secret to this dish is the dressing, which is perfectly seasoned and nicely complimented with capers, shaved parmesan, and garlic breadcrumbs.\n\n* ORGANIC FRIED CHICKEN - This is by far their most popular dish and a must-try at least once.  Somehow, it doesn't taste all that unhealthy?!  It's forgivingly crispy and scrumptious.  However, when I feel like binge eating, I might prefer Popeye's over Wayfare Tavern's. \n\n* SEARED WILD ALASKAN SALMON - I typically don't like fish, but with this fish -- I do!  It has a little bit of everything: sweetness, smokiness, and crunch!  (Portion is small though)\n\n* ROASTED LIBERTY FARMS DUCK HUNTER'S STYLE - Another favorite of mine!  You can never go wrong with juicy, mouthwatering duck covered in bacon lard.\n\n* BAKED MAC & CHEESE (side) - Out of everything, this might be the most ordinary.  Its uniqueness stems from the white cheese being used, but mac & cheese will always be just mac & cheese to me.\n\n* ROASTED BRUSSEL SPROUTS (side) - Who knew veggies could taste so good when they're roasted with mustard and ham hock.  Great side to order if you're feeling guilty about your entree selections.\n\n***\n\nTips & FYI's:\n\n* Make reservations well in advance -- especially for dinner\n* Great spot for a client lunch, a romantic night out, or just because\n* Only dinner is served on weekends\n* Entrees are best if shared.  Who would want to eat 5 pieces of fried chicken by themselves? \n* Request for waiter, Lane!  He is so charming and comedic.  Loved him!\n* Could really use a drink?  Ask the oh-so-wise bartenders (who are cleverly dressed as scientists)!  I was recommended \"The Eve,\" which is a sweet mixture of champagne, vodka, and other fruity ingredients.  It was very Judy-like :)\n\n***\n\nSeriously.  You can't go wrong at Wayfare Tavern.  I can't wait for my next visit!", "author": "Judy C."}

My husband and I hardly ever get to go out to dinner (minus the children) so this was a big treat for us - and I may be a little biased since it's been a while. ;-)  We had a fantastic time!  They were a little behind when we arrived at 10 pm so we had to wait in the bar for about 20 min.  Standing room only, the place was packed.  We didn't mind (again, dinner w/o kids, couldn't be happier!). We had a couple cocktails (can't remember the name) that were tasty. \n\nOk, the food - the popovers were delicious, nice change from the usual.  We ordered the steak tar tar (rather large portion, could have split that) which was awesome.  My husband got the toasted bread with greens, lemon, and cheese, VERY yummy.  I ordered the pot roast (cooked for 48 hrs) which was absolutely amazing!!  I kept wishing I was hungrier so I could eat more of it.  My husband got the burger with egg, which he said was really good, but I was so in love with my pot roast that I wanted nothing to do with his burger. ;-)  We were too full for dessert, sadly.  The wait staff were very nice, just the right amount of service... and they weren't breathing down our necks to get us to go home since it was so late either.  Very happy with our experience here, we would love to go back next time we're in the city.  \n\nOh, and very reasonably priced.

The bar area was packed and definitely appears to be a popular happy hour spot.  Now on to the food and service.\n\nFOOD:\nI had the Roasted Early Girl Tomato soup.  This was by far my favorite dish of the evening.  You can order it hot or cold.  I had mine hot and it was absolutely delicious.  The charred strawberries and the black roasted garlic were beautiful accompaniments to the bisque style soup.  For my entree I had the Wayfare Le Grand Burger with a sunny side up Petaluma egg and kennebec fries.  It as a decent burger,but can't say it's the best I've ever had.  I do love a grass-fed burger with brie, and I thought this would \"WOW\" me.  Unfortunately, it didn't.  It was a bit on the salty side and other than the salt the meat didn't have much flavor.  The fries were just okay.  \n\nOne thing I might add to this review is that this restaurant has very limited vegan options, however, my friend had the Avocado and Hearts of Palm salad and was really enjoyed it.  She also had the Grilled Broccollini and Kennebec fries.  \n\nSERVICE\nHere is why Wayfare only gets three stars from me.  While we were pleased to get a table without waiting, everything after kind of fell apart.  Service from that point on was very, very slow.  Drink orders took long, appetizers took too long and we waited 35 minutes from the time they cleared our appetizers until they brought our dinner out.  I should point out that our waitress was nice but definitely could have checked in with us more often.  Not sure if this had to do with the fact that we were outside.\n\nI may give this restaurant another try one day since many of the reviews here are about the chicken.  I'd like to try it.", "author": "Stacy G."}

I was so disappointed in my experience there last night. Especially for the money we paid and how much our group of four girlfriends was looking forward to this. I don't think I can go back after that.\nWe had an 8 pm reservation for 4. My girlfriend is 8 months pregnant. At 8:30 I approached the hostess about what was going on as we had continued to wait for a table and buy drinks at the bar. She casually apologized and indicated they were waiting for a few tables. Ok. I checked in again, at 8:45, and was told the table would be ready shortly. We sat down just before 9. Pretty ridiculous.\nGranted, the fried chicken is still ridiculously delicious. However, despite this, you would think the restaurant would be kind enough to comp maybe a side dish, a glass of wine or two? Nope, nothing but a non challant apology. Why would they care since we continued to buy more and more drinks after all?\nOn top of all else, my girlfriend had her purse on the floor and someone someway, her entire wallet was stolen. \nSorry Ty Flo, poor form.", "author": "Kristin B."}

The service this time was good but the food was mediocre at best. I ordered the chicken \"salad\" which wasn't really a salad at all. It was 3 leaves placed on top a few pieces of dry overcooked chicken.  The portions were big but not that tasty. I asked the waiter if he really thought the chicken salad was a \"salad\". He said salads are just a bunch of stuff thrown together....well...according to Webster Dictionary:\n\nsalad noun \\sa-ld\\\nDefinition of SALAD\n\n1\n: any of various usually cold dishes: as\na : raw greens (as lettuce) often combined with other vegetables and toppings and served especially with dressing\nb : small pieces of food (as pasta, meat, fruit, or vegetables) usually mixed with a dressing (as mayonnaise) or set in gelatin\n2\n: a green vegetable or herb grown for salad; especially : lettuce\n3\n: a usually incongruous mixture : hodgepodge\n \nI guess he's right because at Wayfare they use definition # 3. Incongruous the chicken salad was. By that definition my coworkers steak was also a salad then because he had more greens on top of his beef than I had in my entire salad. \n\nAnyways, *sigh*, I am sad to have to downgrade my rating.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-16", "description": "This may be one of those many instances in which my dining experience was due to my lack of knowledge about the menu and the restaurant itself. I had heard nothing but great things about Wayfare Tavern and its hard to miss how busy they get every day throughout the week. I can't say I am familiar with the chef that everyone seems to know, so I came into the place pretty blind. It was my first time there and I was with my colleagues from work for our company's \"holiday\" dinner. \n\nThe ambiance and setting of the restaurant is very cool. Dimly lit, great furnishings, with an upstairs and a downstairs area. I had reservations and the host and hostess informed me that since my table was not yet ready and the rest of my party had not yet arrived, I should stick around the main bar area downstairs. It was crowded for a Wednesday night with nothing but business-y people hovering around the bar. I finally got the bartenders attention and ordered an Old Fashioned. Delicious! At last the rest of my party arrived and we were seated in the (thankfully) much more quieter upstairs area which also has a small more intimate bar. \n\nJennifer was our server and she definitely knew her stuff. We pestered her with questions pretty much all night and she was nothing but welcoming and very pleasant to deal with. Firstly, the popovers were AMAZING. I've never had a popover before and had never heard about them prior to this meal. Is it a thing, like the cronut, or is it exclusive to Wayfare Tavern? I have no idea but it its' pretty much like a very substantial light, tasty, fluffy roll of bread with croissant-like qualities. SO GOOD! We ordered a starter salad with avocado, which honestly was nothing to write home about and the Kobe beef tartar. This was served with yet again more popovers which I didn't feel like they were completely necessary on the plate and no one ate them. On top of the tartar was lightly fried thin onions and a raw egg yolk. Once all of this was mixed together, it was my absolute favorite part of the meal. It was tasty, the onions added a wonderful texture to the meat and it was just heaven in raw meat. \n\nNow, on to what I ordered as a main course. I went with the black cod, prematurely because I love black cod and have never had a black cod dish that I didn't enjoy... But this was sadly the case in this particular instance. It was served in a shallow dish with a lot of sauce and it was honestly so dark I couldn't clearly distinguish what was what on my plate. I definitely tasted that something was oyster or clam based, probably the sauce. Not my favorite pairing to be quite honest... It just seemed very soup like and the cod didn't taste very flavorful at all. I was quite disappointed.\n\nOverall, the dining experience in itself was good. I believe I ordered something that I probably shouldn't have ordered and I should have just ordered the Fried Chicken like everyone else. But I didn't and this is how I pay for it. I would go back to try more items from the menu and to allow them to win me over. I believe they can do that.", "author": "Mariko M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-10-04", "description": "I'm just the IT guy and taste tester. My wife writes all the cools stuff\n\nLast week I was fortunate enough to enjoy another dinner at Chef Tyler Florence's Wayfare Tavern.  The last time I was there was opening week, and everything was delicious.  With an update menu I had the opportunity to try some new dishes, as well as revisit a dish from my previous visit.  Again, everything was insanely delicious and hearty.\n\n\nPopover\n\nLight and Airy Popover Interior\nAfter waiting for some time with drinks at the bar, even though we had a reservation, we started our meal with a dozen oysters, all from the West Coast, Poutine, and Deviled Jidori Eggs.\n\nThree varieties of West Coast oysters were available, so we got four of each type, each offering subtle variations in sweetness.  One in particular tasted like a fresh, light winter breeze off the ocean.\n\n\nWest Coast Oysters\nPoutine, which is traditionally a classic late night greasy snack served in Canada, is jazzed up at Wayfare Tavern.  French fried potatoes are topped with oozy, fresh mozzarella curds, tender and tangy braised short ribs, and decadent truffle gravy.\n\n\nPoutine\nThe Deviled Jidori Eggs is a dish we had before, although some slight changes were made.  This time around the eggs were Jidori, which I learned today from a Japanese magazine, is a species of Japanese chicken, which has met free-range requirements.  The yolks are whipped with mustard and cr\u00e8me fraiche for a sweet, tangy, and fluffy filling.  The topping of radish, celery leaves, and bottarga offers subtle crunch and saltiness to offset the rich yolks.\n\n\nDeviled Jidori Eggs\nFor the main course my husband chose the Pork Shank.  For a side he ordered Baked Macaroni and Cheese, a dish he cannot pass up, ever.  The mac and cheese is a rich classic with oozy Jack cheese.  The smoked olive oil adds a welcoming unique touch to the dish.  The pork shank is absolutely enormous.  Served with whipped potatoes, mulled apples, Brussels chips and house mustard.  Again, easily a dish shared by two.  He had enough for breakfast the next morning, which I was looking forward to making into tacos, but we didn't.  Ah well, next time.  The savory, succulent pork just falls off the bone.  The creamy, light, whipped potatoes make an excellent accompaniment to soak up the juices from the pork.  The mulled apples provide sweet and tangy flavor to the dish and the Brussels chips add nice crunch and a touch of green to the plate.\n\n\nPork Shank\n\nMacaroni and Cheese\nFor my main course I chose the Wayfare Burger \"Le Grand\".  It's grass fed beef, Wayfare Tavern's own grind, with local Mt. Tam cheese, roasted onion, smoked bacon, on a brioche roll, with the option of adding an egg.  I chose to include the egg.  Served, of course, with a side of French fries, which are sprinkled with sea salt and parsley.  The burger is absolute decadence, and it is huge.  The meat oozes with juice and gooey, tangy cheese.   The onions and brioche add a subtle sweetness to the burger.  Of course you cannot go wrong with bacon, ever.  The egg just tops it all off, adding a delicious rich, creamy sauce when the yolk breaks open.  I could only eat half the burger, so I could have easily shared with someone.  Of course I also needed to save room for dessert.\n\n\nWayfare Burger \"Le Grand\"\n\nFrench Fries with Parsley and Sea Salt\nFor dessert I had the Sticky Toffee Pudding.  A sweet and chewy sliced date lay on top of the tender, moist toffee pudding, all drizzled with toffee sauce.  A sweet, juicy roast pear with crispy crumbles (ginger cookie crumbles perhaps?) sat next to the toffee pudding, topped with ever-so-gently seasoned black pepper ice cream.\n\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding\n\nRoasted Pear with Black Pepper Ice Cream\nMy husband ordered the Carrot Cake.  Sweet grated carrots and crunchy nuts filled the moist, dense cake.  Pure white tangy frosting topped the cake off.  Candied oxheart carrots, glazed with syrup dotted the plate.\n\n\nCarrot Cake\nWayfare Tavern offered a delicious dinner from start to finish, just as it did back in June when it opened.\n\n\nMy Original review here:\nOpen just a week, one of San Francisco's newest restaurants, Wayfare Tavern, has already received a lot of attention.  Not surprising considering the chef is none other than celebrity chef and Food Network star, Chef Tyler Florence. We were lucky to get a reservation for Friday night and let me tell you, the entire restaurant experience lived up to all the excitement.\n\nThe atmosphere was a lot like what I was expecting based on reading a previous interview with Tyler Florence posted by EaterSF.  I guess the posted pictures also helped me out.  The exterior of the building is commanding and inviting at the same time.  The green of the old Rubicon place has been painted black, and the black and white awnings add a classic flair to the brick building.  At night the lanterns offer a welcoming, warm glow.\n\nInside it looks, well, tavern-like.  But a grand tavern with a high ceiling, state", "author": "Chad G."}

'Twas so delicious that I ate the entire thing with my eyes closed so that I could savor every bite. Heaven is a Wayfare Tavern burger with brie and bacon, m'friends.\n\nWe came here for a celebratory dinner on a Saturday night. I was shocked - and happy! - that I was able to secure a reservation for two only 24 hours in advance (apparently that isn't common). We walked to the restaurant in the pouring rain, hungry and grateful for our umbrellas. The scene that greeted us was warm, boisterous, and decidedly cheerful. A fire twinkled in the fireplace, and the smells emanating from the open kitchen made my mouth water. Upon being seated, we were served popovers, hot and fresh from the oven. Oh Wayfare, such a quick and dirty route to my heart, not fair! We ordered the baby kale salad with persimmons, pomegranate, and honey walnut vinaigrette, the organic fried chicken in buttermilk brine with roasted garlic, lemon and herbs, the Wayfare burger - grass-fed beef, brie, roasted onion, smoked bacon served on a brioche, and a side of Brussels sprouts with garlic, pinenuts, and parmesan. \n\nIf your mouth isn't watering, it should be.  \n\nMy dining companion was pleased with his fare, even going so far as to declare the Brussels sprouts \"among the best he'd ever had.\" Thing is, I was all but ignoring him due to the meat-gasm I was having. The burger was juicy, the flavors were in glorious harmony, the meat was cooked to perfection. I drooled and licked my fingers and was a slob and didn't care. In a feat not previously accomplished by any other burger-makers, I was so obsessed with my burger that I barely touched my (delicious, salty) side of fries. In case I haven't been clear: MEAT.GASM.\n\nIf you don't mind shouting over the din of diners and clang of cutlery in order to talk to other people at your table, bring friends; if you want a meat-gasm of your own and don't care to share, come alone!", "author": "Ray J."}

Service, decor, food...loved it! The dimly lit restaurant is great, whether for a romantic, intimate dinner or enjoying the company of a small group of individuals. From the hostess, to our server, to our busser...each encounter we had with the staff was pleasant. Our server was very friendly and accomodating and his recommendations were great as well.\n\nInstead of ordering separate entrees, my group of 7 opted to order several appetizers and entrees and eat family style...THEE best way to taste a bit of everything on the menu. We did some damage but our mouths definitely thanked us for it.\n\nFor starters, we had:\n* Steak Tartare - pretty tasty and went well with the accompanying toast; the portion is plentiful and definitely enough to share;\n* Beet Salad - this was definitely a winner! it was served with grapefruit segments and figs. very tasty...I would for sure order this again.\n* Oysters on the half shell - chilled, fresh, sweet tasting oysters...can't go wrong with these bad boys\n* Grilled Calamari - it was good but I'd be ok if I didn't have it again; the taste was not the norm in a restaurant but that's also a good thing, right?\n\nSide dishes:\n* Brussel Sprouts - this vegetable is sooo underated! in my opinion, it was one of the best brussel sprouts dishes I've ever had; it was very tender, flavorful (bacon makes the world a better place) and didn't have that strong bitter taste. definitely\n*Baked Macaroni & Cheese - I loves me some mac and cheese but this one, unfortunately, is just ehhh. Kinda of on the bland side and a bit too oily for my liking. \n\nOur main entrees were:\n* Organic Fried Chicken - tasty, tender and moist but I'm glad we shared because I wouldn't enjoy a whole plate of it; don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad but I expected a bit more since I've heard so much hype about it; I enjoyed the accompanying fries more than I liked the chicken\n* Wayfare Burger \"Le Grand\" - this is a good burger! a big fatty hunk of meat that tastes fresh...awesome; it was served with cheese, onion and bacon which are just what I likey on my burger. having it on brioche instead of a regular bun was a great addition and made it seem classy, hehe.\n* Beef Short Ribs - tender, fall of the bone meat...that's how it's supposed to be, right? well folks, that's how you get it at Wayfare Tavern\n\nand last but not least, my fave dish of the evening (drum roll, please)...\nSONOMA PORK BELLY!!!!!!\n*juicy, tasty, fatty, full of flavor...every reason why you should taste this entree full of goodness. maybe you'll even have dreams of it...maybe you'll have pork belly withdrawals. whatever you do, make sure you order it if it's on the menu. if you don't like it, i will give you your money back...pffft, yeah right. \n\nand for dessert?\n* Tolan's Carrot Cake - tastes like, um, carrot cake; good but nothing that'll knock your socks off\n* Sticky Toffee Pudding - the pudding itself was a bit too sweet but the ice cream nicely offsets the sweetness; the roasted pears were fab\n* Rocky Road - the combo of Scharfenberger mousse, marshmellows, caramel popcorn, cocoa nibs satisfies your sweet tooth and the end of a meal. the presentation was also nice...looked like a mini cityscape.\n\nAt the end of the night, my gal pals and I each paid a whopping $60 each.

I would advise any first-time visitor to try this dish for their main. Delicious!!!\n\nI've tried a majority of their appetizers (they've got a small-ish menu). The poutine is what can be described as heavenly sinful. Smothered in gravy-it is deep-fried goodness. The steak tartare was light, not as rich as some I've had, but quite tasty with the popover complements. Which brings us to their famous popovers-something they provide in lieu of bread rolls or the like. They're essentially a well-done croissant shaped like a muffin. They are fluffy, flaky and fabulous. These were reason enough to visit again. \n\nThe cocktails were generally good, but can be hit or miss for some reason. At our table, we had several orders of the Pear 75. After a companion had a sip and was impressed, she ordered her own.

The lime kicks you with its tartness, otherwise, nothing to brag about.\n\nAt the end of the meal, we still had a piece of chicken, mac/cheese and mushrooms left.  We had that doggy bagged for us.

Mind you that the conversation needs to be good as portions are very small. Everything about this place is okay, as expected, but without the \"wow\". \n\nThings I really liked:\n- the bread is delicious. I wish they offered more than one piece of that. Crunchy, warm, absolutely wonderful. I believe they bake it right before serving. Yum!\n- the service is outstanding\n- you get to choose between still and sparkling water. Nice touch. The european in me loves my sparkling water\n- a little something sweet (we got two small squares of cake) for free at the end of your meal\n\nI had seared tuna and it was very good and... very small. I did order dinner size but it looked more like an appetizer. I was really hungry and, thus, disappointed that my almost $30 bucks looked so puny. So I'd say plan to get a side (or two) if you are hoping for a real meal. Though, depending on how you look at it, small dinner portion does leave more room for dessert!\n\nMy friend got their burger and spoke very highly of it. It came with fries and looked great. We passed on the appetizers, though I am concerned that they would have been hard to find on the plate, given the size of my dinner. \n\nOverall, not a cheap dinner and not bad, but I've had so much better in San Francisco in the similar price range.", "author": "Maria N."}

He's dreamy and has the best tomato soup recipe on the Internet. I made gallons of it over the summer.  \n\nFirst impression was great. Wayfare Tavern is a very handsome restaurant with its dark wood, warm fire, and high ceilings. I pulled up to the bar, delighted to find homemade potato chips ready for me. Hubby, on the other hand, was very excited about the fresh popovers. They were huge, light, and fluffy. \n\nI had trouble deciding what to drink so I asked the bartender if he had anything special in season. Just my luck - he did. Something he came up with just that morning, he said. It has grapefruit, bay leaf - he had me at bay leaf - sage, tequila, and ginger beer. I love all those things so he made it for me. It doesn't have a name yet, but hopefully you'll find it on the menu in the summer. Even though the ingredients screamed more \"Fall\" than \"Spring,\" it was a very bright, refreshing cocktail. I hope the word, \"Garden\" makes it into the drink's name. 5 stars for the bartender. \n\nI wanted to try at least two other cocktails, but we had SF Beer Week's Opening Celebration to attend that night so I certainly didn't need any more alcohol. So I ordered an iced tea and it came topped with lemon sorbet - what a fun treat!\n\nHubby and I decided to share the deviled eggs (one of our favorites), the burger (did you know that Food & Wine magazine named Tyler Florence's bacon burger one of the best in the U.S.?), and the fried chicken (even though I already knew it couldn't compare to Thomas Keller's). \n\nHalf a dozen deviled eggs arrived in a darling porcelain egg carton. They were whipped beautifully and topped with fried shrimp. I really enjoyed the relish. 5 stars for the deviled eggs. \n\nUnfortunately, after the deviled eggs, that's when lunch became lackluster. I was hoping for that special something, but it never came. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the food was good, but that's all it was. \n\nAt $21, I was expecting a mind-blowing burger. The best part of our burger was the perfectly cooked sunny-side up egg. I love how magical egg yolk is. Our requested medium was just a tad overcooked IMO, but it was still exceptionally juicy. The bun held up fine and the bacon, as promised, was delicious. However, the brie was no longer Cowgirl Creamery. It was unmemorable. The pickles needed to be thicker and ... I don't know. It was a solid burger, but it was nothing special. I would consider Umami's burger to be the better one in San Francisco. Oh, and the fries were pretty boring. \n\nThe chicken was almost too salty, but only almost. It was also fried a bit darker than I'd like. I enjoyed the intense presence of herbs (rosemary?), but my hubby didn't. I also liked the roasted garlic that came with the chicken. However, the most disappointing part was that nothing else came with the very expensive fried chicken. It was just chicken. No mashed potatoes. No creamed corn. Zip. \n\nI'm pretty bummed I didn't love Wayfare Tavern. I can't get over how overpriced everything was. Add San Francisco's ridiculously expensive parking fees and I probably won't return, but it's okay. I still think Tyler Florence is dreamy.", "author": "Christine N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-02-10", "description": "The people here were douchy. That's the first thing that turned me off. We had a 10:15 reservation, yes 10 p.m. We walked in and the hostess said it would be 5-10 minutes for our table. No prob. Then I remembered all the yelpers had recommended the chef's counter, so we asked for that, and she said, \"right this way\". Well, we got the disabled seats for the chef's counter. 1. neither of us is in a wheelchair. 2. those seats should be kept open for someone who IS in a wheel chair. Yeah, this close to the end of the night (kitchen closes at 11:00, more on that later), odds were pretty slim a wheelchair would come in, but still. And, 3. we couldn't see shit. The seats are just way low so you can't really see into the kitchen. I was bummed, but resisted the urge to whine.\n\nThe food, however, was very good and the entrees reasonably priced. We started with the steak tartare (ah-mazing). They give you more of the popovers with it, drizzled with a garlic butter- can't really say much more about it here that hasn't already been said, just order it! Hubby had the filet which was beautifully presented in 3 segments with crispy fried onions and a shallot compote, I think. And I had the half a chilled Maine lobster ($20), which they brought with drawn butter, with lemon, herbs and garlic floating in it. We shared bites and it was like a surf and turf deal. \n\nBack to the douchy-ness. First,  is the wine mark-up. A $10-$17 glass of wine should be more than a 4 oz. pour. Period. I would bet money that they have a measuring device back there to make sure they don't accidently give a 6 oz. pour, which we be more reasonable and still a good profit margin. That's just b.s. But what really turned me off, was how I was able to tell that it was 11:00 o'clock without looking at my watch because the kitchen staff rolled out the Cambro's and started packing up all the leftover garnishes, etc. Then at about 11:03, one of the cooks called a manager back there and showed him a ticket that had come through. The manager, instead of being a manager and saying, \"You better get cooking\", went and got the server and made her explain why she put in a late order. Are you kidding me?! what were they going to do if she didn't give a good enough explanation? As can be expected, they filled the order and went back to packing up the kitchen. I would have rather been able to see the food being prepped than all that drama. It just made a horrible impression. Our total bill was $115. with tax. I'm not sure if we would go back. If we do, we will be drinking the $5 root beer.", "author": "Tess S."}

Though I was a broke unemployed law school graduate (still am) who had just finished taking the bar (I passed!), I agreed to go with her because she really wanted to try WT (she has some kind of a crush on Tyler Florence). Well, I did really want to try the popovers so it wasn't that hard of a decision for me.\n\nThe interior is very rustic - reminded me of Rickhouse but with more elegance. They seated us right in front of the fireplace - how romantica! It was pretty busy and loud - looked like the spot for people in the FiDi to go for drinks after work.\n\nWhile perusing through the menu, we snacked on their much talked about (and might I add, complimentary) popovers. So soft and buttery! I had to stop myself because I knew we were going to order a feast - as always.\n\nWe started off with the Kobe Tartare and Poutine. Very different dishes - while the Kobe Tartare is light, the Poutine was very heavy. Both were good, but IMHO, the tartare was better. The dish itself not only looked more colorful, but the kobe had a very delightful taste. It didn't hurt that the dish was quite generous as well. The Poutine was good but enough as a lone appetizer.\n\nMy friend really REALLY wanted to try their Lobster Corn Chowder (no longer on the menu) but we didn't want to order it since we had already ordered quite a bit so she asked for a sample. And out came two bowls of corn chowder simply because the chef felt it was worth more than a sample. Aww, so sweet! He was right. It was so creamy and perfectly sweet. And the lobster tasted so fresh!\n\nFor our entrees, my friend got the Fried Chicken and I got the Sonoma Duck. The Fried Chicken had a very intense rosemary taste though the meat was impressively tender. The Duck was also pretty salty though cooked perfectly. \n\nWe also got a side of the Mac n Cheese (I told you we ordered a lot) and it was disappointing. I don't know if it was because we were stuffed to the max by then or what but it was dry and not cheesy at all. Definitely not the way a Mac n Cheese should be.\n\nWe went with the Peach Cobbler for dessert because my friend REALLY wanted it. I don't like peaches so I was already inclined to dislike it. It was a really big piece of cobbler but the peaches in there were not soft nor did they taste ripe. My friend was quite disappointed too. I had to bite my lip from saying, \"See I told you we should've gotten the Chocolate Cream Pie.\" Other than that big doozie, we had a pleasant experience - the food is hearty and mostly generously portioned.", "author": "Linh V."}

The \"popovers\" were overcooked.  (Yorkshire Pudding Popovers at House of Prime Rib is 1000x better).\n\nThe waiter was knowledgeable and nice, but tried to \"upsell\" everything.

I love tyler florence and I've actually been meaning to try this since it first opened a few years back. My mouth watered at the thought of the succulent fried chicken. \n\nWell, \nI came here with a party of 5 for a birthday celebration - and Yeah, it was nice, but def. not great. I think the real root of the problem was the genre of food. Can you really expect fine dining from dishes like fried chicken and a burger? They were good, but there's really only a certain point you can reach before it's something you can get at in-n-out or KFC/Popeyes for 1/100000 of the price and just as good. \n\nThe Chicken - YES it was succulent and delicious. Its true. I just can't say i can pinpoint the one thing that makes it better than other places. Maybe my palate is not fine tuned enough. \n\nThe Burger - YES it was delicious. (although, I think I have to admit that as far as gourmet burgers go, try mission beach cafe =x). It was VERY large and almost impossible to eat. The fries that came with it were OK (again, I prefer MBC's truffle fries) \n\nWe also tried this steak dish which was unoriginal... The mac n cheese which was nothing special, and a poutine thing which was OK as well. \n\nI like the idea of the popovers as bread service though - airy and buttery - yum! \n\nWould I come back? meh. maybe for lunch. \n\nOn another side note - there was kind of a strange incident that happened with our wine and the server... so we had a bottle and the server was pouring a glass for my friend, but then missed and it spilled on her (dark) dress. He profusely apologized, but still ... it was weird and should we have been offered something complimentary without even having to ask or feel guilty? Eventually we were offered ONE free glass of wine - and it wasn't even offered to the girl the wine was spilled on, AND it was super delayed. weird.\nalso, there was some crazy drunk lady in the bathroom downstairs --- my girlfriends recalled the story: \"I was sitting in the stall next to this lady, and she was CRYING really LOUDLY and asked for some tissue... so i gave her some and all she could say was ' THATS ALL YOU CAN DO ?!?!?!!111'\" \n\noh dear.", "author": "Tim B."}

It's fine dining on the great frontier, leave the pretentiousness at the door. I also love the coats the bartenders wear - reminds me of soda shoppes!\n\nI'm so easily starstruck - eating at a celebrity chef restaurant is so exciting! I've always been a fan of Tyler Florence, so when the time came to come eat here, I made sure to do my due diligence by sifting through yelp reviews, photos, menus, and online articles to make sure we got the FULL experience here. I knew the menu would be seasonal so we'd have a few surprises, but for the most part, I knew what we were ordering before we got there! A day before our reservations, I noticed an article in the SF Chronicle noting that the steak tartare here was among the top 6 in the city. This is definitely NOT to be missed.\n\nWe came extremely early (4:45pm!) but that was fine. I love beating the crowd, I always feel like you are treated like a princess. We sat down and were promptly served warm popovers which were pillowy and crisp, perfect way to start a meal! I then proceeded to order for three of us: Braised Short Rib Poutine, Steak Tartare, the famous famous famous Fried Chicken, Le Grande Burger, and Mac'n'Cheese. I wish we had one other person here with us because it was a lot of food but we were not willing to sacrifice one dish - all were absolutely delicious and memorable! I would eat the exact same meal again! All of the portions here are huge and the food is down home hearty - I recommend eating family style. \n\nThe short rib poutine is BETTER than poutine in Canada which I ate the following week! In fact, I think this dish has ruined poutine for me hereafter, nothing will hold a candle to this one. The burger is HUGE (thickest burger ever!) and topped with mt tam triple cream cheese from those lovely cowgirls in the Ferry Bldg. The mac'n'cheese is so cheesy and gooey! And admittedly, I am not a big fan of fried chicken but this is not your typical fried chicken. It's broken down into five pieces and easy to eat, it's crispy, not oily and topped with lemon and herbs. I loved it! I am now a believer.\n\nThe only negative thing I can say is when we sat down, our server came by and gave us a little schpeel about the restaurant since it was only three months old. He mentioned \"Tyler Florence in the kitchen...\" and my eyes lit up! There are three floors and on our floor, the kitchen was in open view so I kept looking to see if he would pop up.

But the stellar appetizers were the deviled eggs (I could eat these daily) and the terrine which was a chicken liver (to die for, so smooth and fluffy...yum).\n\nWe ordered the fried chicken (the best I've had to date, crunchy crust, perfectly cooked and with that squeeze of lemon on top...I'm thinking about my leftovers as I type). \nAlso the steak frites...double yum yum. \nOh my gosh and the POPOVERS, we will go back for those alone.\nNow for dessert, the sticky toffee pudding was a big hit followed closely by the steamed lime pudding cake. The chocolate and hazelnuts was wonderful but didn't stand out among the others. \n\nEveryone enjoyed their entrees at our table and we can't wait to go back. The portions are enormous!

And while the above description isn't unfair to this place, I really did enjoy the fried chicken that I ordered, and the complimentary popover was particularly divine, although I don't speak from much experience with popovers, much to my waistline's gratitude.  The mac and cheese side was only okay, and unless you are in deep need of comfort food, I would probably skip it.  \n\nYes, it is still pretty pricy, which is what probably prevents me from giving it a full five stars, and realistically I'd probably give this 3.5, but unlike most other New American places, the food is not only really good and well presented, but there's actually a pretty solid amount of it.\n\nWe did experience a small hiccup in service, though, in that the server almost brought our table the wrong dish.  It belonged to another table, but it's worth noting, especially since there were maybe a total of 4 tables when we were eating.", "author": "Norman S."}

We were seated promptly and served their famous popovers before our entrees came out. Between the two of us we split the Organic Fried Chicken and the Wayfare Burger \"le grande\". The meal was great and the service was superb. We did find that a piece of our chicken was still pink in the middle, our waitress assured us that because the meat is sous-vide that it was safe to eat but can be replaced free of charge.

Several pieces of the fried chicken were undercooked (chicken shouldn't be served rare!) but cold. The chicken had obviously cooked ahead of time to keep up with the lunch crowd. The popovers, while warmer than the chicken, were dry, also appearing to have been cooked ahead of time.\nAs for the price, what can I say? $25 for the chicken with no accompaniment. With a $9 side of whipped potatoes, tax and tip, $80 for lunch for two. For almost the same amount of money, two of us could have eaten at House of Prime Rib and received fresh hot sourdough, salad, prime rib, potatoes, vegetable and Yorkshire pudding.\nDisappointing and expensive.", "author": "Karen K."}

Because FRIED CHICKEN. \n\nI came here for a business lunch having heard wonderful things about this fried chicken. Generally I think even bad fried chicken tastes good so I was curious as to see how WT could surprise my taste buds. \n\nBefore I get to the main course, I want to give a shout out to the oysters and popover I ate. The oysters were cleaned properly (not rocky at all) and were served with some cocktail sauce and lemon. Totally fresh and refreshing. \n\nThe popover was out of this world. I devoured the whole thing and declined the second round for fear of looking unprofessional. I deeply regret that decision. The popover was flaky but soft, and the butter/salt combo was magnificent. \n\nOkay, so, the fried chicken. Wow. Wow wow wow. It was herbed but it must have been soaking in that brine for days because it was extremely moist and the flavors were prominent without being overwhelming. I would definitely recommend squeezing the lemon that they provide over it to cut through the heavy rich taste. It reminded me of eating japanese fried chicken (karage) mixed with a really yummy herbed gravy. Sounds weird but that's what I was thinking as I was enjoying it. \n\nIt's served a la carte so I got some mac and cheese which was good but I've had better. \n\nMy friend got the burger which looked awesome as well but the waiter told me their chicken is what their known for. Couldn't say no to that sort of endorsement. \n\nThe ambiance is a two story comfortable and modern yet homey feel. There is a private room in the back upstairs that is a big long table that coverts into a pool table. \n\nI can see why this has become a SF food must-go. It's excellent.", "author": "Carmen K."}

It was surrounded by an equally impressive tomato-chorizo jam. The other ingredients on the plate, including perfectly prepared and sized sweet onions, were perfect compliments to the octopus. \n\nWe followed the lead of others and ordered the hamburger and fried chicken, splitting a side of greens, which was a good decision because we could barely finish (they don't skimp on portion size). The hamburger was wonderful, packs a powerful punch of flavors and textures, including a roasted onion that was cooked to perfection. The fries were perfect, but I wonder if adding a light and unique seasoning might hit it out of the park.\n\nThe fried chicken is a must have. Five appropriately sized pieces, all super moist and seasoned to perfection, with the skin being super thin, delicate and crispy. Our server mentioning the chef recommends a splash of lemon with the chicken--amazing touch, but I found the couple slices provided was not nearly enough. Still kicking myself for not asking for more lemon.\n\nThe side of greens we shared was overall a very good dish. It may be too peppery for some, but we loved it. The combination of vinegar and bacon was excellent and really complemented our dishes. \n\nEating at the bar watching the chefs doing their thing looks like a lot of fun, so if you're into this type of experience, I highly recommend it.\n\nWe had a great time at the Wayfare Tavern, received wonderful service, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who might be wondering if it deserves all those stars.

One of my friend's is practically a regular here and I would drool every time she told me that she was eating there. I could not wait to eat here!\n\nHowever, our trip to SF was a bit spur of the moment. Unfortunately, dinner rsvp's were booked for that evening, so we decided to get there as soon as they opened and get a seat in the bar area. It worked! There was a group of 4 of us and we were going to eat family style so we opted for one of the two small round tables in the bar area instead of the bar counter.\n\nHere's what we ordered and my my humble opinions about the items:\n* Deviled Eggs: I thought my mom's deviled eggs were excellent, but sorry Mom, Tyler has you beat. I think it was the mustard creme fraiche because they were so darn good!\n\n* Organic Fried Chicken: Now I see what all the fuss was about. So completely moist and juicy and yet, it wasn't greasy! I almost wanted to do the \"I love my chicken\" song from that young kid on youtube.\n\n* Braised Beef Short Ribs: Since we were sharing, one of my friends wanted to cut it in portions. She barely touched her knife to the meat and it all just fell apart. No knife was needed. It was beyond tender. Soooo tasty! The potato puree was perfect with it.\n\n* Grilled Santa Maria Tri-Tip Steak: I love tri-tip! And truffle butter? Oh, that was my first time having truffle butter and it was delightful! Someone had a slightly heavy hand on the salt though since the meat and the fries on this dish were slightly too salty for my tastes but it was still edible\n\n* Baked Macaroni and Cheese: Talk about a little piece of heaven. So rich and yummy but oh so good.\n\n* Rocky Road: So awesome! It was edible building blocks. The marshmallows were my favorite part!\n\n* Fried Apple Pie: Yummy and comforting. The sage ice cream though? Another piece of heaven. I would seriously buy that stuff by the gallon if I could.\n\nExtra kuddos to the fresh and hot popovers that were served as we were waiting for our entrees. At the end of the meal, we were served warm out the oven gingersnap cookies. I don't even like gingersnap cookies but THESE ones? Excellent!\n\nActual restaurant vibe and decor was warm and inviting. Very rustic feeling. It was comfortable! Didn't feel stuffy or overly fancy. \n\nService was excellent.

I've been watching him on TV since he was invading people's houses to help them with their lack of cooking skills in a little show called Food 911. I've cooked some of his magnificent recipes with great aplomb and to great applause from my family and friends. So it pains me to give a 3 star review on my first exposure to his flagship restaurant.\n\nI happened to check OpenTable and lo and behold a Saturday night reservation popped up a couple days beforehand. Joyful exuberance! My lady and I went there, although unbeknownst to her until we walked near there and she noticed the building as we walked closer to it. She was definitely happy to see this surprise.\n\nWe checked in and got seated upstairs. Depending on where you sit, the tiny spotlights can either illuminate your dining area or leave you in the shadows. We got the latter. Not a big deal. The food would make up for it. Or would it?\n\nWhat we tried:\nComplimentary popovers: They are the hit that everyone says they are. A cloud enrobed by a golden crackly coating. I inhaled the each one and couldn't wait for the server to come back with more. Too bad they only came with butter. If I had some jam to go along with a half dozen more, it would have been the breakfast of champions.\n\nRoasted bone marrow, grilled sourdough, roasted brussel sprouts, sea salt, smoked olive oil ($14): Butter of the gods! I wish the bone was larger, only because there would be more marrow to spread over the sourdough bread. It is heavenly. The acidity of the pickled onions and parsley counteracted the unctuous marrow sublimely. \n\nRoasted winter mushrooms, olive oil, garlic ($8): This was one of their side orders. A myriad of different mushrooms sent my fifth sense of taste into overdrive. Very well cooked, tender, and delicious.\n\nOrganic fried chicken, buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herbs, lemon ($22): The signature entree. My lady ordered this and after sampling a couple pieces, it was quite simply the best chicken I've had to date. Meltingly good. The brine Tyler uses definitely creates a moist, flavorful chicken. Squeeze some lemon on top, take a bite with some of those fried herbs, and enter heaven. \n\nWayfare burger \"Le Grand\", grass-fed proprietary grind, Mt. Tam cheese, roasted onion, smoked bacon, brioche bun ($19, add $2 for fried egg): My order and the fail of the evening. I specifically ordered it WITH the fried egg. After taking a bite, tasting no eggy goodness, and perusing layer by layer of the burger, there was no egg to be found. I flagged down the server to say my egg was not in the burger. I thought she would take the whole burger back and give me a new one WITH the egg I requested. Instead I wait while the burger gets cold, and she comes back with a plate adorned with a freshly fried egg. Inserting the egg in between the burger, I am now disappointed because it's not the experience I was hoping for. I can only eat a couple more bites before packing the rest to go. The fries also were way oversalted. \n\nNo dessert was ordered because frankly I just wanted to leave. The server comped the side of mushrooms for the mistake but I think giving me a new burger would have been the right decision. This experience soured me on Wayfare Tavern.

We had the deviled eggs (great texture - really light and fluffy), the fried chicken (good execution here too - crispy, not oily and moist) and the blueberry tart (crust had a good snap/bite to it.  Not soggy, great blueberry flavor).  I wasn't as enamored with the popovers as other reviewers (ours were a little warmer than room temp.).  But the service was notable.", "author": "John N."}

I don't think so.  To get around this annoyance, we ordered for pick up and had a picnic in our hotel room.\n\nWe ordered:\n\n1. Fried Chicken - Moist, tender and delicious, I like the herby essence they added by throwing in fresh herbs in the fryer with the chicken.  The crust wasn't as crispy as I like it, but that might be because of the to-go container.\n2. Fliet Mignon - Mmmm, meaty tender goodness.  Loved this dish.\n3. Rib Eye - same here, RE is my favorite cut, and this doesn't disappoint.  I was expecting a larger piece of meat for the price, but I guess it is what it is.  Delicious nonetheless.\n4. Black Cod - THE BEST!  MUST ORDER!  I don't even like capers, but the fish was so tender, well cooked and fresh that it didn't matter.\n5. Pear and Gorgonzola salad - wilted, not a good to go item.\n6. Short Rib Poutine - soggy, not a good to go item.\n7. Chocolate Cream Pie - very delicious.\n\nAnother fun fact - it was very hard to order to go, they put me on hold many times double checking if they could make the dishes I wanted to order for take out, and ultimately they wouldn't serve many items due to quality control, as a result of being put on hold so many times, our order got mixed up big time.\n\nNext time I'd definitely try to make it to the restaurant to give it an honest shot.

Well that happened to me at Wayfare Tavern, Mr. celebrity chef Tyler Florence's place. His show on food network always gets my chops watering in delight for American classic/comfort food. I left with some serious mixed emotions.\n\nStarters ordered:\nSTEAK TARTARE!- Unbelievably delicious! To be fair I don't have steak tartare very much if at all, but this is the dish that electrified my taste buds. Fresh chopped filet, french mustard dressing, egg yolk with garlic toasted popovers. I just loved breaking that egg yolk and mixing it with the meat. The mustard dressing isn't overpowering. The blend is just right. I will be ordering steak tartare at other restaurants from now on to compare. (5 stars)\n\nDeviled Jidori Eggs- It's good, but Deviled Eggs are just that, Deviled eggs. I remember the first time I ever had a deviled egg I almost cried so I can understand the rave reviews. The curried yolk is a great touch, but I feel like one could easily make something similar with some curry powder and the end result wouldn't be too far off. I have a friend who makes some mean deviled eggs btw. (4 stars)\n\nMain dishes:\nOrganic Fried Chicken- Quite disappointing imho altho the fried chicken which I measure all high end fried chicken to is the almighty Ad Hoc's. It's an unfair battle I know, but it is what it is. Sure buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herbs, and lemon was used, but the flavor just didn't pop. The chicken was reasonably juicy. The portion was significant. (3 stars) This reminds me to write a review of my Ad Hoc fried chicken experience, stay tuned, I'll link it up once it is done.\n\nDungeness crab louis salad- The salad came in in these giant balls of iceberg lettuce w/ smoked bacon, avocado, soft boiled eggs, radish, beets, and apples. Overall it was very uninspiring. The crab wasn't particularly great. (1 star)\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant is what you should expect, a high-end dolled up tavern aesthetic, which has a cozy effect. I liked the brick walls, but I'm a sucker for brick walls in a loft or art gallery, or restaurant. My party sat upstairs and the service was excellent. I think I drank at least 6 cups of water because they kept refueling my glass. I felt like the guy was daring me to drink more. \n\nI have yet to try any of the other dishes of Tyler Florence, but I was let down by the mains unfortunately. I have faith that burger and veal chop could possibly be great. My friend who had dined there before told me after the fact that the bone marrow is excellent. Sorry Tyler, got to go 3 stars on this experience. Better luck next time?", "author": "Jack C."}

The moment I arrive, there's a valet parking, I already got a feeling about it. I hate to to drive around to find a spot. Yes, I'm lazy to walk in my heels!\n\nBeautifully decor, a main floor with booths, bigger bar & an open kitchen, but it was packed like a zoo on a week night, with all the financial guys fill up the booths, & single girls at the bar, hope to get 1 of those guys to invite them to sit down! (Oh please, don't hate!)\n\nDown stair is the washrooms & another kitchen! Love the comic pictures on the walls! Up stair, another small bar & small tables, more intimate, reminds me of Babbo lay out in NY. If I didn't have to fight the crowd to go to the washroom each time, it would be nice!\n\nI came to dine with 1 of the talented & uprising men designers I know. So we were glad to get sit up stair, away for the craziness on the main floor, this alone - 1 star! Tables are very closed so I can hear neighbor conversations! Arrr!\n\nOur server Jane was absolutely wonderful, introduced us the menu & walked us through. The the sommelier Ken offered to coll & decant the bottle for us, he then chatted up with me about wines & all, really a great guy (an Aqua veteran). & corkage fee is only $20, wow, that's unheard of around here!\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n- Popover - they serve it fresh as good as The Rotunda in Nieman Marcus! \n\n- Steak Tartare - French mustard dressing, shallot, capers, organic egg yolk, Tabasco, summer herbs - served with sourdough toast, it was really well seasoned & tasty.\n\n- Seared Sonoma Foie Gras, roasted plums, grilled sourdough, tarragon & sea salt - this was such a big portion, perfect to share for 2. You know my relationship with Foie Gras & pear! This time was the grilled plums, sweet, succulent, perfect paring! \n\n- Salt Roasted Bone Marrow, parsley-shallot salad, veal demi, sourdough toast & molasses butter - oh so much for control my diet before the 5 fashions I have coming up this week till next week haha! It was worth it, I'm telling you!\n\n- Mac & Cheese, Jack cheese, garlic breadscrumbs, chive & smoked olive oil - big portion, so yummy!\n\n- Leg of Lamb, grilled Pozzi Farm lamb, cranberry bean rago\u00fbt, fresh pur\u00e9e - this was thick cut, at least 12 OZ of meat, perfectly pink, juicy, & tender!\n\n- Dessert, I don't eat sweet, but we ordered the Porto 10 years, perfect way to end the dinner!\n\nWine list was mainly US & major in California, which I love, good collection, all bottles are from $36-$150, 1 bottle at $235; Half bottles all under $50; by the glass from $9-$17, very reasonable. & 8 types of beers on tab!\n\nI didn't order anything dishes got mix reviews, so I need to come back to order all different dishes to see! Oh I met chef Ty-Flo, even the kitchen was crazy, but he was kind enough to let me take a picture of him! \n\nOverall: 4.5 stars\nFor value: 5 stars\nFor Food: 5 stars\nFor Service: 5 stars \nFor ambiance: 4 stars\nFor Crowd: Too crowded!!!!\nFor location: Valet is only $10, but they are not nice!!! $ collect in advance, before I even get out of my car!

The first time the chicken was over salted and the brussel sprouts were left home alone too long in the oven. I chalked it up to the grand opening honeymoon and them still working out the kinks.\n\nMy second attempt recently was all about the MEAT. We ordered the steak tartare, which was excellent and complimented by crispy slices of popovers brushed with a fragrant green sauce. The burger on the other hand seemed not well thought out. Like many other yelpers have commented, the addition of bacon and fried egg as toppings I think actually detracted from the patty, which is extremely clean and light in flavor, and the bun, while delicious, was much too fluffy to hold everything in. The fried chicken was expertly cooked but still seemed to be missing a special something that I couldn't quite figure out.\n\nDon't get me wrong though; it's a fab place with a testosteroney ambiance and top notch service. I'll give em more chances though probably not with dinner - next up will be a night of sampling cocktails paired with the much praised deviled eggs.", "author": "Claire C."}

I had to switch my demeanor into a \"classy Rosanne\" to fit in.  The restaurant is two floors with a bar upstairs and downstairs. I loved its decor with a rustic American feel to it. \n\nMy boyfriend brought me here for my birthday dinner. We made reservations a week early and the only time slot available on Opentable was 8:15! Make the reservations two weeks early if you insist on eating during the normal dining times. When we got there, we were on time but they didn't have our tables ready for another 15 minutes. While waiting, we sat at the bar and sipped on some yummy cocktails... I don't remember the names of the drink (and its not listed on their website) but it was very tasty. \n\nWe got seated and at our table, there was a SIGNED birthday card (not mass printed) from Tyler Florence. Too bad he wasn't there! \n\nService was impeccable. We were served right away and ordered. \n\n-The Poutine - Delicious. Truffle fries topped with mozarrella cheese, braised short ribs, and slices of truffle. This dish was heavenly. I almost filled up on only this and was half-way full by the time my entree came.\n-Mac & Cheese  - A bit too cheesy. Lots of heavy cream... Not one of my faves.\n-Braised short ribs - More tasty truffle gravy. It went sooooo well with the whipped mash potato sides. The meat was moist, tender, and just SO \nGOOD. I couldn't stop eating my boyfriend's entree.\n-Organic Fried Chicken - I think the batter was too salty. I would take a bite of my chicken and sip a bit of water just to even it out. It's a nice crisp batter and the chicken was moist. The taste is very herby, if you're into that. A bit too much rosemary on my plate. I took some pieces of chicken and dipped it into the truffled gravy... Hehehe. \n\nWe were too full for dessert (as usual) but we did get some complimentary caramel-covered kettle corn for my birthday. It was in a tiny cute cup and a cute way to end dinner.\n\n\nThe bill was surprisingly cheap. Meal for two and under $100 after tip and 20% tax?? Wait a minute....... That was ridiculous.

The party held at Wayfare Tavern was headlined as an after-party for the Saturday evening fundraiser that took place in the Grand Tasting Tent set up at Union Square.  Scheduled from 10:00 PM until 1:00 AM the party was announced as such:\n\n\"Hosted By Tyler Florence\nThe official after party of the SF Chefs Saturday Night Fork It Over Foodraiser 2010 in the newly opened Wayfare Tavern featuring classic San Francisco cocktails and bites.\"\n\nTickets for the event were $45 and the event sold out well in advance.  So knowing that I'm stunned at how ill-prepared the staff at the Wayfare Tavern was, and I'm certain I was not the only disgruntled attendee among the estimated 400+ people they managed to stuff into the second and third floors of this dingy, tight space.\n\nI arrived about five minutes before the 10:00 PM start time, and the chaos and confusion had already begun inside because it appeared they still had diners on the second and third floors.  After a mass exit down the staircase by a large group of people occupying the party space ticket holders were directed up to the second and third floors.  \n\nI followed the masses up to the third floor to find a small, darkly-lit space with maybe two dozen chairs and staff still arranging plates and utensils on two serving tables.  I'm assuming the third floor space is a wine lounge for it houses a very impressive display of bottled wines.  Three wines were offered to the masses, a rose, a chardonnay and a cabernet.  I stood in line and ordered the cabernet uncertain of the vintner or the wine.  The red wine had very little depth to it.  The flavor was too mild for me, and it just didn't have a favorable taste.  I finished the glass though since there were no food options, and I'm not a big fan of white wines.\n\nI'm assuming the second floor is a regular dining floor.  It had a large grouping of tables that were all occupied, and the only bar there was serving only one type of drink to everybody in attendance.  It seems the \"classic San Francisco cocktails\" they advertised was a highly-diluted, almost soda pop-like whiskey sour.  I consumed the entire glass, because once again, there were no food options and nothing else was available.\n\nFifty-five minutes passed before we got the first glimpse of food as a waiter carried a tray of three hamburgers halved (six total pieces) out to the vulture-like crowd which snatched up the burgers in less than 2 seconds.  How the heck do you have the nerve to serve six burger halves to several hundred hungry guests?  When food was finally presented to that mass of people stuffed in on the third floor it was a tray of maybe a dozen pieces of fried chicken and five deviled egg halves.  As expected, as soon as the server put the trays down the food was gone.\n\nFood began to arrive more regularly approximately every ten minutes with very small platters constantly snatched up in mere seconds.  I finally tired of this fiasco, and I left at midnight after consuming only three items.  I had an overcooked piece of very dry fried chicken breast that had good flavor on the outside and zero flavor inside, a deviled egg half which was super creamy and a quarter of the over-publicized Wayfare burger that a kind stranger insisted that I share with her.  While the burger had excellent color and the thick beef patty had a nice beefy aroma to it the burger itself was juiceless and not flavorful.\n\nI'm hoping the money charged for this event went to a very good cause because it was definitely a waste of my time.  It will be a long time before I return to the Wayfare Tavern!!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Bummer for him (though I got my beloved Dim Sum in Chinatown fix) ....Two weeks later we try again, now again it's a Friday. This time it was open to the public and bustling with people. It was about 1:15 and there was still a bit of a wait. \nUnless....\nWe were willing to sit at the bar (this bar area looks over the open kitchen where they make many of the appetizers). My husband and I were fine with this since we were hungry.\nService was supreme, and while waiting for our food it was interesting to watch as they made the different apps. for other patrons. \nWhen my Buttermilk fried Chicken arrived (half a chicken cut up and fried) and a order of amazing french fries, I have to say I was in deep fried heaven. This chicken wasn't greasy or heavy, it was light crispy and oh so juicy tender on the inside. Plus with my overdose of salt with my fries, it was a \"don't bother me moment\". My hubby had the short ribs drenched in some sort of dark wine sauce that looked pretty damn amazing too, even though I don't eat red meat.

While the restaurant is separated by two levels I always felt squeezed in. We were seated on the more \"spacious\" second floor that is reached after hiking up a long staircase. There isn't really any music besides the low thwacking of a jazz cello. The decor is unpretentious yet handsome with old style American iconography such as eagles, top hats, and hand drawn illustrations. The private room has quite the look.\n\nThe service was excellent. I felt like they had an extra step to work through because of the two story divide yet this was never felt throughout the service. I suppose they throw the food on a dumbwaiter from the first floor kitchen to raise to the second.\n\nThe food is good but ultimately not memorable. Wayfare Tavern serves up solid comfort food but I never felt like the dishes ever exceeded the quality from which these dishes were inspired. The avocado and heart of palm salad was a total joke. The deviled eggs were pretty but just okay. The poutine is good but it feels like this could be coming from anywhere; although, the bone marrow flavor was nice. The bread they serve is great however it would've been amazing if it wasn't cold.\n\nThe highlights were the fried chicken and black cod. If nothing else get the fried chicken, it's pretty damn good. I had the veal schnitzel. It's humongous. It comes bone in on large white plate. I barely ate a third of it. Yet the main reason it's so hard to eat is because there are hardly any sides to this dish. They sprinkle some purple cabbage along with 1/9th of an apple on the veal like that's supposed to help. Why skimp on cabbage? Is cabbage expensive? I love my cabbage.\n\nThe desserts are a letdown. The chocolate pie is so mediocre especially for San Francisco. If the crust fails, the pie fails. And the crust failed. The smoked honey cheesecake comes served in high dramatic fashion with a glass unveil. The flavor is unusual but intriguing. My mom hated it. It's not for everyone. The mint chocolate chip ice cream is a text book \"ehhhh\". My dad pointed out that for $10 you could get a huge sundae at Fenton's. Yeah, disappointing no matter how much TCHO chocolate you drizzle on it. At the end they gave us complementary (bad/dry) coffee cake pieces. What a fizzler of an ending.\n\n_______\n\nEasy and casual atmosphere combined with spot on service. But for a restaurant of this reputation I'd expect more surprises rather than retreads.

Maybe it was hyped up too much for me, but I settled on 2 stars because I don't think I'll go back. \n\nLet me preface this review by noting that the service and presentation were superb. Wayfare Tavern is a great space, and I hear they have a private dining room with a pool table. But, on food alone, it couldn't muster more than 2 stars for me. \n\nWe went for the steak tartare. The steak was incredibly fresh, and the tartare is served on 2 garlic toasted popovers and a single quail egg to drizzle over the top. The serving size is huge, and was perfect for sharing with my fellow huntress for the best steak tartare in town. Alas, other than the fresh meaty flavors, it was lacking in other flavors. I didn't really taste any of the mustard dressing and had to sprinkle some salt on top to enhance my enjoyment. Not the best steak tartare, but not the worst either. \n\nRoasted Organic Beats, I could have done without. I'm not a good assessor of beats, since I'm not a huge fan, so the only thing I will say is I didn't enjoy it, and my dining companion thought the avocado mousse was too salty. \n\nPoutine! I thought I would love this. I mean, who could not love fries, braised short ribs, and truffles?!?! But, I didn't love it. I'm so disappointed in myself. I might have to demote myself from being a true fatty. It was described as including \"truffle gravy.\" I didn't see anything remotely resembling a gravy. Instead, it was fries with a rather dry, albeit tender, chunks of braised short ribs topped with shaved truffles. \n\nThe biggest disappointment of the night was the Grilled Hawaiian Tuna. The 3 large square chunks of tuna were seared nicely. But, it was quite bland, and where there was flavor, I didn't care for it very much. Each chunk was topped with what I think is soy caramel. I scraped that stuff off after a taste. The mushroom-yuzu \"vinaigrette\" drizzled along the side of the plate was also not so fabulous. \n\nAll of the above plus a glass of prosecco and a glass of sauvignon blanc with a generous tip resulted in a $120 bill.", "author": "Christina L."}

I wanted to give him a nice dinner-- and I definitely got that. When we stepped into Wayfare Tavern, the decor was vintage and luxurious. It looked like a bar/restaurant out of the 1920s. The lights were perfectly dim and definitely set the right mood. The place wasn't packed but there was a good amount of people eating and drinking there already.\n\nThe first review I read about this place said the service was slow--- but that was definitely not the case for me-- but probably because the restaurant wasn't that busy yet.\n\nWe ordered the french fried clams, organic fried chicken, and mac and cheese. All of these were mediocre. The french fried clams only came with four clams--- and the bulk of the plate was fried cauliflower-- which was kind of disappointing for the price I was paying. The organic fried chicken was a bit dry and not as flavorful as I would have wanted it to be. However, I still thought it was good and had a nice herby taste to it. The mac and cheese was really flavorful-- and may have been a bit too cheesy. Still, in all (maybe it was the great design of the place of the perfect lighting), I had a great time and the birthday boy did as well. We also had some cocktails in us (mezcal sour-- mezcal, pineapple siracha syrup, egg whites, and tavern sour-- yellow chartreuse, herb syrup, egg white, and a Goose Island) which probably helped to make the food taste a bit better.\n\nThe bill came out to a little under $88, which definitely hurt my wallet-- but was well worth the occasion. I don't know when I'd be back here-- but probably only on another special occasion-- definitely not on a typical Saturday night.", "author": "Julie H."}

Last night Tam took Alan and me to Wayfare Tavern for an early dinner before hearing Diana Krall at Davies Symphony Hall in celebration of Mother's Day, Father's Day and our birthdays.  It was a magnificent gift that pleased us both greatly.   The restaurant space is beautifully old school, w/ worn wooden floors meeting floors of hexagonal tiles, dark wood and warm lighting.  You enter on the ground floor.  Stairs lead up to the second floor dining room.  Bathrooms are in the basement, which are also reached by stairs.  An elevator serves the building, so it's possible to take the elevator to the basement and then to the second floor as well as to higher floors that house other businesses.  \n\nWe were taken up to the second floor in the elevator by the hostess, who seated us at a table by a window overlooking Sacramento Street and Leidesdorff Street.  Alan commented jokingly on the great view and the hostess told us that Friday Woody Allen had been shooting his new film on Leidesdorff, which we all agreed was very cool.  We sat and perused the menus, looking at the adjacent tables to see what others had ordered.  Tables were close enough that you could engage in inter-table conversations, but not so close that you felt an unwilling party to others' conversations.  I ordered a cocktail, the Sutro Sour, which combined gin, honey, rosemary and Chartreuse, but our waiter apologetically told me they were lacking an ingredient for it, so instead I ordered an Aviator, which combined gin, lemon, maraschino liqueur and Liqueur de Violette.  It was delicious, nicely balanced, not too sweet.  It had house-made maraschino cherries.  Alan had a glass of Lost Coast Brewery Downtown Brown Ale while Tam contented herself w/ water.\n\nWe were brought popovers, the best any of us had tasted, and salted butter.  Tam ordered corn-lobster bisque to start, Alan ordered grilled calamari and I ordered a butter lettuce salad.  The bisque was delicious.  The lobster was almost superfluous.  Alan liked the calamari, but found the sauce too spicy for his taste.  The salad, which was dressed in the Palace Hotel's Green Goddess dressing, had a few perfect pieces of avocado and thin slices of radish.  It was a lovely salad.  For our mains Tam and I ordered fried chicken and Alan ordered Alaskan halibut.  As sides we ordered mac n cheese, a melange of summer beans, green, yellow and flat, and and roasted eggplant w/ cashews, garlic and chili, although Alan requested no chili after his experience w/ the sauce on the calamari.  The chicken came piled, a wing, a leg, a thigh and a breast split in two, a small bunch of fried thyme on top.  The halibut was accompanied by shaved truffles and I forget what else.  It was flavorful but slightly overdone, Alan, Tam and the man at the adjacent table agreed.  That feedback was given to waitstaff.  The mac n cheese was good, but not as good as Tam's.  The beans were marvelous, as was the eggplant.  There was leftover chicken which they sent home in a charming container marked w/ the restaurant's signature retro label.  Tam and Alan had coffee, which Tam will tell you about.  I had organic Earl Grey.  The beverages were served in metal pots and the cups were large.  Tam and I shared a slice of chocolate cream pie.  It was made of TCHO chocolate and magic, w/ the richness and texture of my very favorite childhood chocolate pudding, topped w/ whipped cream and tiny crunchy balls of what Tam thought were house-made malted milk balls.  Eventually Tam, who's less enthralled w/ rich dark chocolate than I, left me the filling and concentrated on the crust.  It was a lovely, lovely indulgence, one I would happily repeat.\n\nService was engaged, attentive and charming.  Water was refilled, as were popovers, and requests were accommodated.  Tam was given a claim check to pick up the chicken downstairs at the hostess stand, a nice touch I'd never seen before.  It was a marvelous dining experience and we all agreed we would return.", "author": "Toni M."}

What a sweetheart. \n\nWe had a party of 7 and to our amazement, got seated in their beautiful private dining room that fits up to 15. All throughout our 3.5+ hour stay, we never once felt rushed and service was impeccable from beginning to end. In the midst of opening gifts, our server even tried to clean up the wrapping paper and ribbons from the table, not wanting us to lift a finger and just enjoy ourselves. Our glasses were never empty and someone would periodically check in on us to see if we needed anything. Service was definitely on par with upscale places like Gary Danko. Their kitchen was running behind so our food took longer than anticipated, but it was worth the wait. \n\nComplimentary popovers and a half order of steak tartare to share. A must-try! I sampled each of my friends' entrees and the short ribs, duck, and pork belly were definitely the winners (in that order). They also do not skimp on the portions! Complimentary gingerbread cookies and their delectable sticky toffee dessert ended our meal on a high note. We also had the rocky road dessert that sounded awesome on paper but felt it was too sweet and rich for my taste. \n\nMy only gripe was that there was only one restroom to share. \n\nA well-deserved 5 stars for Wayfare Tavern! Thank you for making our Christmas dinner magical and definitely one to remember!", "author": "Vivian D."}

That is not to say it is not tasty - it is - but it is not fabulous and certainly not unique. \n\nWe arrived a bit late for lunch and walked right in and sat down. Not sure if it was a fluke, but there were plenty of seats available. We decided to sit at the bar and later decided that was a poor decision as the service was abominable. The menu is, well, \"American\" and rather limited.

Situated in a quaint alleyway in the financial district, you enter the restaurant to find a rustic, yet elegant, interior characterized by dark wood, a grand fireplace, a tall staircase leading to second floor seating, and a formidable bar in the entryway.  The decor is the best part.  The food is good, paired with an excellent beer and cocktail menu.  The service is decent, though a bit pompous.\n\nBut when the bill came, our overall experience didn't come close to matching our amazement at the bill we'd racked up.  While the decor is unique, the food doesn't live up to other nearby restaurants serving the same thing.  We tried the fried chicken.  It was good, came with lemon on the side which added a nice citrus element to the salty fried taste.  We liked that it came cut into smaller pieces.  But Hops and Hominy down the street has a far superior fried chicken.  They bring out popovers before your meal - a treat, but also not as good as the Cliff House or the Rotunda.  Everything is a la carte, so you don't get any sides paired with your entree. The beer list is well thought out and reasonably priced.  The cocktails are great but again a bit steep at $11.  \n\nWayfare is a unique spot, definitely worth trying once, but the overpriced menu makes coming back difficult to justify.", "author": "Ben Y."}

I regularly use recipes from Tyler Florence at home and was excited to try some of his dishes at the restaurant. We started with the deviled eggs, which we were told was one of their specialties. They were very good and the addition of the crispy shrimp on top was ingenious. I have only had bone marrow a few times but the serving at Wayfare Tavern was definitely the best that I have tried. My main course was the Sonoma Duck and was possibly the best preparation that I have ever had, so I would highly recommend it. I tried a few bites of my wife's Butcher's Filet, which was good but not out of this world.

Not only is the food absolutely incredible, the service is just as wonderful. My family and I came into Wayfare Tavern without a reservation on a Saturday night at 7. It was really packed but we were given a bar table and ended up with a booth because of the very accommodating service (thanks to the host, Adam). I can not stress how great the service has been every time we eat there. It's very professional and the staff is very polite. We go here every time we are in San Francisco, it is absolutely our favorite restaurant. But make a reservation because you don't want to miss out on this place.

There was not much flavor to it. For entrees, my dad ordered the pot roast, my mom ordered the pan roasted alaskan halibut, the bf ordered the steak frites, and I ordered the fried chicken. I thought the fried chicken was very bland, but the side of fries I ordered was good. My mom said her halibut was the best dish all night. My dad said the pot roast was pretty tasteless too. For dessert, we ordered the sticky toffee pudding and chocolate and hazelnuts. Both desserts were really rich and EXTREMELY sweet. \n\nFor some strange reason, they had the AC blasting even though it wasn't even hot outside. It was actually gloomy and drizzly.

Had reservation but still had to wait by the crowded bar as there was no where else to go. Standing akwardly to the side of the packed bar trying to get someones attention, seemed like everyone was a service bartender, right in the way of everyone it seemed, but really not in the way at all of anyone. Still standing waiting for acknowledgement, but nothing, not cocktail to start, no bourbon, no beer no nothing, just standing and waiting. Then finally we order our drinks have a few sips the tables ready, phew close call. \n\nThe food, oh the food. It was good but I wanted to love it and I just didnt. It wasnt bad but it didnt blow me away and I really wanted it too. The mac and cheese was good but not great, the burger my friend got he said was good but not cooked properly, the fried chicken was good but again not great. The best 2 things I had was the Poutine and the Kobe Tartare, the beef really was sublime. The tartare I would go again just for that, when I know its gonna be slow in there\n\nI lived in Charleston just like Chef and just came in with really high hopes. Our service was good and came with a little attatuide at no charge, the bartenders were quite stand off-ish I felt, the whole experience from start to finish just blew me away in a not so positive way.\n\nAll in all food was good like I said, but it just didnt do it for me and there are so many spots in SF it would be hard to go back full bore.

With a 9:30 PM reservation, we were happy to wait for a table and sip the amazing cocktails being poured and review the menu.   The menu is a fabulous read: marrow to duck with everything in between.  While waiting for a table, popovers were delivered to us which were a lovely.\n\nOur table was great, service was spot on, wine list was amazing ( our foursome is from the wine industry) and so we were off to a great start.  \n\nThe salad courses were all mediocre but the soup with lobster beignet was very nice.   When our entrees came, each one was beautifully presented.  I think the food is more concept than execution as each dish had fairly big flaws.   I ordered the chicken with smoked chicken hash: the chicken was  dry and void of flavor, the parsley foam added nothing except color and design, and the petaluma egg was rubbery and overdone so it didn't coat the hash with yummy rich yoke.   The hash was good. \n\nTwo at the table ordered the duck with Tortelloni.  Once again beautiful presentation but the duck ( medium rare) was so tough it was challenging to eat.  The sauce was fabulous as were the tortelloni.  \n\nThe fourth guest at our table ordered the fried chicken and she is from the South.  It was ok but not close to Emeril's at NOLA in New Orleans.  \n\nToward the end of our meal, the Wine Director came  to our table and this is where you would have  had to have been there to appreciate.  I will simply say the Wine Director announced his title three times and then belitted the three women at the table.  \n\nHis comment that ruined our meal as he looked over to the only man at the table and said\" Oviously you ordered the wine because you are the man at the table.\"    Yes, he did.   Truth be told, it was the Assoc. Winemaker, a woman, that ordered the wine at our table.  \n\nTo make matters worse, he came back while we were deciding on Tawny port.  He offended the women once again with \"ask the man which would be better\".  Possibly he clued in at that point as he brought us a comp. sip of port  but the damage was done. \n\nHe recommended the Boston Cream Pie and when it came, it  resemblled something from a Claim Jumper chain, enormous.    It lacked the finesse of a reinvented comfort food.  \n\nI would go back for the hamburger, the service, the ambiance and would hope the Wine Director was short lived due to his clumsy communication points and sexist views.", "author": "Sunni V."}

I can say that I was blown away.\n\nMy main recommendation: reservations are a MUST! Especially on a Friday night.  I called about 2 hours before dinner time and there was absolutely no availability... and it was just for one person.  I ended up eating at the bar, but even had to wait a while for the bar seat.\n\nThe decor is comfy, cozy, yet elegant.  \n\nThere seemed to have been a pretty large \"happy hour\" crowd - lots of people hanging out at the bar having drinks.\n\nSo, let's disect what I had to eat:\nDrinks: watermelon mojito... I had to really try hard not to just down these drinks.  They were so refreshing! Make sure you pull out the alcohol-soaked pieces of watermelon after you've finished the drink :)\n\nAppetizer: bacon-wrapped dates. They call them Devil on Horsebacks.  Yeah, it's a bit old-school, but it's still delicious!  Bacon is after all the duct tape of food.\n\nEntree: Living in the South, I was having a hard-time going with their house speciality, the fried chicken.  My expectations are really high.  So, I opted for the Butchers Filet.  I had to say that the onion rings that came with it were my favorite part of the dish.  They should just offer those as a side item.  I would have ordered a basket of those... probably the best onion rings I've ever had.  The beef was tender and perfectly cooked.\n\nSides: I had the twice baked potato.  That was probably the only item in my meal that I could've done without.  Potatoes were bland to me.\n\nDesert: I had cantaloupe sorbet... yum!! From my understanding the desert portions are intended to share or for someone with a tremendous sweet tooth who hasn't eaten all day.

We ate like it was The Last Supper, and if something were to have happened to any of us after leaving, we would have gone happily.\n\nEverything we ordered was fantastic. If you're a trusting person, I'd highly suggest asking your server (especially if it's Alvin) to order for you. We did this with almost all of our cocktails too. The bartenders are all master mixologists, so if you just give them your base liquor of choice, they will whip something incredible up for you. Our favorites were the Bourbon Sidecar and their version of the East Side. Both perfect summer drinks. I also had the Occidental Sour, which was a version of a Pisco Sour. \n\nAs for the food, these are MUST orders:\n* FRIED CHICKEN - five pieces of buttermilk fried chicken that goes head to head with Ad Hoc's\n* WAYFARE BURGER - succulent beef patty topped with Mt. Tam cheese and bacon on homemade brioche bread - share this, it's huge\n* DEVILED EGGS - super creamy\n* GRILLED CALAMARI - seasoned and grilled to perfection\n* SALT ROASTED BONE MARROW - large bones cut long ways with decadent marrow spread on sourdough toast with molasses butter\n* STEAK TARTARE (I didn't have any, but those who did loved it)\n* 1/2 CHILLED MAINE LOBSTER - great as a starter if you're with a large group\n* CREAMED CORN - better than the creamed corn I've tasted in the South\n* PINEAPPLE UPSIDE DOWN CAKE - We tried 4 desserts, and this was hands down everyone's favorite\n\nOur server Alvin was the man. And actually, every single staff member we encountered was so hospitable and accommodating. The manager must have stopped by to check up on us at least 3-4 times during our 3 hour meal. We even got mac 'n' cheese, banana pudding, peach pie and coconut macaroons compliments of the chef. By the end of the night, we were stuffed silly to say the least. In fact, I am still stuffed 18 hours later.\n\nThe restaurant has a super masculine feel to it - it's a cross between a hunting lodge and a gentleman's club - but obviously, because of the hot celebrity chef behind the place, the ladies flock here like a moth to light. Tyler Florence obviously was not in the house last night, as there weren't a group of women pressing up to the counter looking into the open kitchen.\n\nWe toured the 3-story space, and were really impressed by the billiards room and the private dining space that also houses the wine.

I booked my reservation three weeks in advance because I knew how hot this restaurant was.\n\nHe & I shared:\n*Mac N Cheese ($8)--Super creamy & the noodles were cooked just right.  I can't take large amounts of dairy so bf ate most of it and we took some home, but I loved it, and I'd sacrifice a little tummy ache later that night for more bites of Tyler's mac n cheese.  We did this as an appetizer.\n*Organic Fried Chicken ($22) --LOVED the fresh herbs used to differentiate this standout dish.  We got 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs & a wing.  The meat was juicy and I did squeeze some lemon on the chicken to give it a little more flavor.  The skin was so crispy and not really greasy.\n*Wayfare Burger ($18)---So juicy & oh so messy!  I wish I could have tasted more of the famous Cowgirl Creamery's Mt. Tam cheese though.  I loved the smokey flavor from the bacon & the brioche bun was tasty too.  It's served with garlic fries which were perfectly cooked and not oily.\n*Side of Asparagus ($8)--Drizzled with just the right amount of sea salt & olive oil.  It was super tender!\n\nThe popovers were served very hot & I like how WF serves these instead of bread because it's less filling...who doesn't love free, but I came here for the entrees, I don't want to be half way full by the time my fried chicken came out!  Needless to say with the big portions, we had taken home leftovers, and had no room for dessert, but they did provide complimentary cute little coconut macaroons.\n\nThe service was great, the decor is very manly but admirable by us ladies due to its classiness, prices were reasonable, and last but definitely not least the food is very satisfying.  I can't wait to come back to Wayfare Tavern to sample other dishes, and hopefully get a glimpse of Tyler Florence (he was out of town for the weekend when we went)!  \n\n*Note: The bathroom is a random unmarked green door to the left of the bar upstairs.

Case in point for me: appetizer of seared sonoma foie gras, entree of buttermilk fried chicken.  At the end, I thought I was pregnant with poultry.\n\nI went with three friends so had a chance to increase my caloric intake even further with bites of their dishes.  I think that I chose two of the best dishes on the menu, but the steak tartare was fabulous too.  I would skip the tomato salad and deviled eggs (nice and creamy but not as good as my mama's), and the tuna was good but this is not the place to order a delicate piece of fish, in my opinion.  I loved the frog hollow peach pie, but each bite brought a bit of pain to my distended abdomen.  Martella grenache was tasty, but the cheesy subtitle \"home away from rhone\" made me almost not want to order it.\n\nService was strange. I don't think our waiter liked food, we didn't have forks for awhile, and sense of humor was nil.  The celebrity gawking was over-the-top because we weren't seated until forty minutes past, undoubtedly because some ladies from Dallas were waiting for Tyler to walk by and propose.  The manager came by a lot and waved and smiled, kind of like a mime.\n\nPraise to the lord that Paula Deen hasn't opened a restaurant in SF, otherwise we'd all get big just inhaling her food through the air.

Even with a full house & still being a relatively new establishment, they've got their routine down pat.

We shared a half lobster. The bf had bone marrow & steak & eggs (possibly the richest things you could order at WT.) I had the dungeness crab baked avocado (creamy, huge portion of crab) & the hangtown fry. I'd never had oysters before (I don't eat anything raw) & thought I'd try it for the first time at WT, since it came fried. One bite & I was done; it's official, oysters are just not for me. I did think the petaluma eggs were the fluffiest I've ever tasted.\n\nWe shared two desserts:\n* peach pie w/ goat's milk ice cream: omg, the crust was generously sprinkled with sugar & it was awesome with the slightly sweet peaches & syrup. Perfectly cooked. Five stars.\n* banana cream pudding: served in a cup topped with amazing meringue. The vanilla cookie crumbles in the thick pudding just made the whole dessert.

Not even a heaping portion of Yoppi Yogurt can help.\n\nSo, after a very, very long afternoon at work, a few of my coworkers and I trudged down the hill to Wayfare Tavern after talking about it for weeks.  We spotted an empty table outside, and we asked the hostess if we could take it, especially since the bar downstairs and upstairs were PACKED.  Like I had to elbow my way to get through to the bathroom downstairs (which, by the way, must've been the most ornately-decorated bathroom on earth).\n\nWe ordered a few cocktails ($11 and delicious) and the Mac 'N Cheese side dish, as well as the Oysters Rockefeller, since we were going out to dinner elsewhere later on.  The mac 'n cheese was in a garlicky oily creamy Jack or white cheddar cheese (or I think it was.. because it sure as hell didn't taste like anything I've eaten).  The pasta was cooked too much past al dente and was just a soft mush, essentially.  The cheese was way too creamy and rich.  I couldn't handle more than one bite.  Plus it tasted more like an alfredo sauce than an actual macaroni and cheese dish.\n\nI didn't have the oysters, but that's because I only like raw oysters.  My coworkers seemed to really enjoy them though.\n\nI'm down to try other things on the menu, but only after the hype dies down.

The couple times that I've been out here it has been impossible to get into some places that I've had on my list of places to try, Wayfare Tavern being one of them. \n\nCame into Wayfare on the recommendation from my client while I was out in SF on business.  It was just myself and one other colleague on a Monday night circa 6/630 pm, and they weren't taking reservations for the main dining area any longer.  There was an hour wait for the 'chef's' bar (I guess its a nicer bar where you can see the food being prepared as opposed to the drink-bar), and the actual bar was first come first serve, but patrons are able to order off of the full restaurant menu.  We put our names down for the food bar, but ended up snagging a seat at the bar-bar after an hour wait.  \n\nThe food was definitely good, solid American.  Nothing to complain about.  I had the Burratta as an appetizer which was deeelicious.  Since I was pretty stuffed after that (and was tempted to order another round for my entree-- sorry I'm not sorry? #cheeeese), I ordered one of the seasonal entree salads and requested grilled chicken on top for my main course.   It was pretty good, definitely could tell it was fresh and made with seasonal ingredients, and was certainly unique -- definitely not a usual salad option that you'd see on just any menu.\n\nMy favorite aspect of this place by far is definitely the ambiance and decor -- rustic, high end tavern/lodge feel with high ceilings and a noticeably attractive crowd.  The bathrooms downstairs were gorgeous!!!  \n\nNext time I'm headed out to SF on business, I'll definitely make a point to make a reservation well in advance for the main dining area!", "author": "Tara O."}

While smooth and creamy, it was a touch dry, but mostly needed more flavor/seasoning.\n\nPoutine - Meh.  Maybe because ours came out warm, not hot?  Fries were a bit soggy, curds were rather clumpy/solidified.  Tasted rather nondescript.\n\nBurger - Good, not great.  Patty was nicely sized, with decent char and flavor, but a tad dry (not overcooked, just dry).  Could use a bit more fat in the grind.  The fried egg helped a bit.  Also, while a tall burger stack looks impressive, it's a total mess to eat (and I don't think my mouth is abnormally small).  Bacon was nicely thick and crispy (not so thick it's chewy, not so crispy it's dry and brittle).  Patty directly on the bottom bun is a bit of a faux pas IMO - juices soak directly in to the bread, making for a soggy/greasy bun (unless there's a good coating of mayo/etc, or lettuce).  This bun did hold up pretty well though, maybe because the patty wasn't particularly oozing with juices.  Fries were nothing special.  How about spritzing some truffle flavored oil on them TyFlo?", "author": "T C."}

I did feel that the food was a little overhyped, but the fried chicken did live up to my expectations.\n\nI ordered a Dandelion Wine cocktail, that had lychees in it!  It was divine.\n\nFor appetizers - we shared deviled eggs with shrimp on top.  The shrimp on top is the real deal, so good!  My coworkers ordered steak tartar and calamari as well. Apparently the chorizo jam that accompanies the calamari is to die for. \n\nEntree - I ordered the much talked about Fried Chicken. We couldn't help but quiz the waiter Portlandia - style, we asked him if the chicken was local, and yes the waiter did know and was able to answer with a straight face.  You get half a chicken, which is a lot since we did order all the sides on the menu, so I only ate two pieces.  The chicken itself is sooo good, and juicy.  \n\nI also tried my coworker's salmon (with apricots in curry sauce), it was delicious.  And it's North CA Salmon, in case you were wondering.  Yes, we asked (I'm a Portlandia junkie). \n\nSides - We did order them all.  The Mac and Cheese, Whipped Potatoes and Eggplant were winners, in that order.\n\nDessert - Popcorn icecream and Chocolate pie.

This should be 3.5 based on today, but I rounded up given what the restaurant has demonstrated in the past.\n\nPromptly sat by an uber nice host team; however, there was no offer to hang coats or umbrellas on a rack, which would be nice on a rainy day.  The menu was not special for Easter as the website had implied.  I guess I should not have inferred anything special when they offer brunch and ala carte.\n\nRaquel was responsible for our table.  When my mom ordered the Mandarin Breeze (?) cocktail, she explained the concoction, suggesting it wasn't properly described.  I then ordered my mimosa with blood orange juice, which she stated they did not have.  Puzzled, because the mandarin cocktail indicated it would have this, she said, \"Oh no.  We are out, so we are just using small mandarins.\"  Probably not the best way to handle that.  Just sayin'.  Popovers and room-softened butter delightful per my parents.  Raquel was knowledgeable about which items could be made gluten free - such a relief from some of my other recent dining experiences where it takes a relay team to communicate what is and is not.  \n\nWe ordered a half dozen of the \"briniest\" oysters.  Raquel recommended the Blue Point (Conn.) and the Buckley Bay (B.C.).  The latter truly satisfied the salt craving, although the mignonette was a bit over shalloted/herby.  Next course was the wild mushroom soup, with cr\u00e8me fraiche and pesto.  Outstanding blend of earthy and creamy, brightened by the pesto, for $12.  \n\nMain course: two Crab Louies for my parents and I had the Anson Mills grits with foraged (oyster) mushrooms and requested two poached eggs served atop.  The deconstructed Louies looked brilliant and both my parents were fans of the flavors.  One of my two eggs had evidently sat a bit too close to a heating lamp, given the solid mass of a yolk.  It was taken away and replaced immediately, upon my request, but I honestly think whoever ran the food should have noticed the lack of movement in that yolk.  The side order of brussel sprouts followed just a minute later.  Perfectly charred and the proper proportions of parm and pinenuts.  The only trouble was that we were not provided tip plates upon which to enjoy.  Again, promptly remedied, but only upon request (as was me obtaining a soup spoon to eat my silky-creamy grits).\n\nSo far we would be on par with a 4 star service, until I went to the upstairs restroom.  Overflowing trash can. Check. Out of one roll of t.p. Check. And evidently the soap dispenser had exploded, and someone had piled paper towels around the pool of glistening soap, but had not cleared any of that away.\n\nThe atmosphere and can-do attitude of the staff along with the food quality are grand.  However, if my party spends $175 on Easter brunch, some of these rough spots need to be rounded, which really requires anticpating the customers' needs.", "author": "Charla W."}

But the moment I stepped inside, my mood and perception changed completely.  The deep, \"manish\" color choice for the interior and various woodland creatures' (are they real?!) heads mounted on the walls made me feel like I'd been initiated into the Handsome Men's Hunting Club, with Tyler Florence as the chairman.  Even the table settings were fitting to the \"manly hunter\" theme but in the most refined and upscale way possible.  It was up to the food to deliver the same surprise.  The verdict:\n\n- Puff Pastry in replacement of baguette/boring bread is an excellent start.  You can have as many as you want but probably want to hold off because the portions are HUGE.  If only I could eat this for breakfast every morning... with butter and jam... mmm...\n- Wayfare Burger \"Le Grand\" with its every so juicy and THICK cut of grass fed beef brisket, savory cheese and bacon top my list of best burgers in SF (I DEF think it's better than NOPA... yea, I said it...)  Good god, I love this burger.  Not only is it the same size as my head, but the flavors work incredibly well together and the bun is grilled to perfection.  AND THE BACON...what a bonus.\n- Organic Fried Chicken was tender and cooked perfectly but it doesn't beat Angeline's fried chicken.  I found it odd that the chicken dish didn't have an automatic side dish included but luckily, we ordered the mac n' cheese and it was a match made in poultry heaven.\n- Mac n' cheese: Creamy, warm, comforting, and oh-my-god-so-bomb-diggity good.  You have no idea.  Just get it; don't ask questions.\n- Deviled Eggs  with mustard yolks, san francisco sea salt, paprika and chives was smooth like silk and light-tasting.  I want to spread the mustard yolk on bread but that would be carb overload.  Fun to watch the chefs make them, too! \n- Pineapple Upside Down Cake was crumbly tastiness on a plate.  The caramel ice cream was sweet but still light and flavorful.\n- Chocolate Story is quite the fairy tale.  Felt like I was socked in the face by this unbelievably decadent and SCRUMPTIOUS chocolate madness of a dessert. \n- Peach Pie was my favorite!  The sweet and fresh tasting fruit and the crumbly pie had me floating.  \n\nOur waiter even brought out macaroons to end our feast (as if we weren't overloaded with sweets already).  I'm not a fan of shaved coconut or macaroons but the crunchy sugar coating on the outside was yummy.  \n\nOverall, I'd give the food 4-stars.  I really appreciate the fact that the food isn't afraid to be flavorful and on the heavier side.  It fits perfectly with the theme of the restaurant and I feel like I got my money's worth of grub (high-quality grub).  The 5th star goes to the amazing Tyler Florence for making the experience so memorable.  His polished and ever-so-friendly staff never misses a beat with refilling your water glasses or checking up on your table.  As the chairman of the Handsome Men's Hunter Club, women flock from all corners of the area to catch a glimpse of him working his magic.  In all honestly, a group of us came here for a double b-day dinner and requested the chef's table so we could stare at him all night (our boyfriends were not amused).  \n\nI'll definitely be back for more.

The fried chicken was the best that I've had. Savory, crispy and juicy chicken was fried to perfection and little drizzle of lemon juice made it even better. I loved my mac & cheese, it was just how mac & cheese should be like---creamy, cheesey, and comforting.

In fact, it's so good I'm still thinking about it and it's been over a month since I've had it. And now that I'm back in NY who knows when the next time I'll get my hands on it. Tyler Florence takes a more elegant approach to this traditional classic and it works. We had left overs and had the fried chicken for breakfast and it was STILL incredible. \n\nThe chicken liver pate was also top notch. Really appreciate the playful take on the jelly that should be served with the pate, where, instead you had a string of roasted grapes.

The first thing we all got were cocktails.  My wife got a Gin & Jelly, which was a really tasty and refreshing take on a Gin & Tonic with fruit.  However, my friend and I both got 2 drinks that were out of sight!  The Mezcal Mary was a take on a Bloody Mary with Mezcal instead of vodka.  Mixed with some Chipotle, it was like a smoky taco in a glass!  One of the tastiest cocktails I've had in a long while.  We also got a Texas Kiss, which was a Bourbon based drink.  It was good, but not as good as the Mezcal Mary!  My wife and I got fresh and fried oysters.  Both were really excellent!  We all shared pea tendrils and shishito peppers for side.  Both were prepared well and tasted great.  We all got the fried chicken.  It was very good.  Since we all were in Memphis last summer, it sadly does not compare to Gus's - but what does?  For SF, this fried chicken was delicious and a true comfort.  Also, unlike other plates...this one was GENEROUS!  I'd recommend sharing if you want to try more stuff...  The desserts were also good.  They are known for their cream pie, but while my wife liked it...I was indifferent.  However, the house-made doughnuts rocked!\n\nService:   Very good.  Sarah did a fine job keeping up with us.  \n\nHints/Final thoughts:  The Wayfare tavern looks really cool and it a fun place to dine.  The mixology is really excellent.  The menu isn't that adventurous...but mind you, the idea is comfort food", "author": "Andy R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-06", "description": "There are many aspects of this restaurant that I absolutely love and a few that really bugged me. \n\nDecor is very manly man (manly man white guy though b/c not many of us brown folks A) hunt and B) hang the antlers on the wall so our friends can ask us about it) which is a great change of pace. But honestly, I don't give a damn about the decor. It could have been painted pink and neon green, as long as the food is good, right??\n\nProblem number 1:\n\nWe ordered oysters and were told they were fresh out. Really? Hot summer weather in San Francisco, 4th of July weekend and no oysters? To make matters worse, we saw a group seated after us chowin down on oysters about 20 minutes after we were told they were out. Not cool Tyler. \n\nMain Lobster (full order)\nCooked to perfection, I just don't like working for food. I understand the concept of presentation, but it's just as easy to yank all the lobster meat out of the shell in the kitchen and serve it to the guest. AND if you are going to force the guest to do that much work, PLEASE provide more than that tiny fork and please give us a lobster bib.\n\nSmoked Pork Chop\nThis was a thing of beauty. Pork was cooked to perfection, it was smoky, moist, tender and delicious. Served with a roasted peach, fennel puree and something that resembled brown sugar was on top. Absolutely great balance in the dish and I'd order it again.\n\nRoasted Salmon\nAnother great dish. A bit over seasoned, but other than that it was moist, tender and had a nice smoky flavor. I only had a few bites, but I'd probably order this dish.\n\nDessert\nPineapple Upside Down Cake\n\nI am not sure why I ordered this b/c I usually don't dig it, but they have made me a fan. It is served with a macadamia nut brittle and wonderful scoop of salted ice cream something or other. Great compliment and balance of sweet, savory and salty. \n\nThe service at this restaurant is exceptional! Molly, our waiter, had such a great personality, great charm and was a character. They are on top of everything. Guys walking around checking each table every few minutes, water filled often, clean forks after appetizers and when my friend went to use the bathroom, the waitress saw her napkin spread across the table and quickly swooped in with a fresh one taking the used one away. Maybe that's something that most people wouldn't notice, but those are the simple things that make a difference. \n\nI would come back, but would probably wait a few months and let them figure things out b/c it did take a very VERY long time for the food to hit the table, which is always a drag. We were seated at 845 and didn't walk out the door until about 1045 or so. That's way too much time for an impatient guy like me. All in all, I am glad that Tyler is the current star in a location that has been home to so many great chefs.", "author": "Hector G."}

The BF took me here for my birthday dinner and after making the reservations a month before I could hardly wait! Our reservations were not until nine so we decided to go early and grab a drink at the bar. To my surprise they were able to seat us as soon as we got there. \n\nAfter making our way up the stairs to the very cozy dinning area, my mouth was already watering for the fried chicken I had been thinking about all day. We decided to start with a bottle of wine and went with an 05 syrah from California. Tyler has done a good job of assembling a wine list with many great Cali wines. \n\nWhen it was time to order I of course went with the fried chicken and the Bf went with the hangtown fry , which is fluffy eggs with oysters inside topped with bacon and cheese. They say its a dying man's last meal, and I believe it could be mine if i couldn't get fried chicken. For the sides we choose the baked macaroni and cheese and creamed corn. \n\nNow growing up I spent many of my summers in Alabama eating my grandma Mary Bell's fried chicken, which is still my fav. But Taylor knows what he is doing and his comes in a close second!!! Yes it is that good. The skin is so light but so crunchy and is infused with rosemary. It was also a very large portion which I liked too. The hangtown fry was also amazing. The egg made it so light and fluffy, then you get the richness from the oysters and cheese. The baked mac n cheese was some of the best I've ever had as well, rich and cheese without being overly greasy. The creamed corn had the fresh off the cobb taste and was a perfect addition to the rest of the meal. \n\nTo end the meal we had the TCHO Chocolate pudding, layered with crumbled cookies, topped with marble ice cream and little malt balls. They brought it out on a plate with happy birthday written on it in chocolate. It was sooo good and chocolaty the perfect end to a perfect meal. I was so impressed with Wayfare Tavern, I'm already planing the next visit.", "author": "Corynne O."}

In a city with tons of nice, pricy restaurants I expect at least decent service if I'm paying hundreds of dollars for a meal. \n\nWe made our reservation a month in advance and ended up with an 8:30 on a Saturday night... earliest available. So when we got there my boyfriend and I were hungry! We waited for at least 20 mins for a table, and I had a nicely-prepared Manhattan at the upstairs bar. When we were finally sat we waited for another 20 minutes before even being greeted. By then we knew exactly what we wanted and put in our full order. Another 20 minutes for our wine. +10 more for the appetizers. By the time we got something to eat it was about 9:45, over an hour after our reservation.\n\nA few people had raved about the bread and it was good. They give you one piece and you have to ask for another. We DID ask for another piece and they totally forgot to give it to us until the end of the meal. Thanks. \n\nThe appetizers were delicious! The steak tartar was divine. We also got blue cheese stuffed prosciutto wrapped dates, which were a bit rich but very yummy! For me the appetizers were the star of the meal\n\nI got the rib eye and it was cooked perfectly. It was a huge slab of meat, which I'm not complaining about, but there's no way I could finish it. It came covered in mushrooms and sauce but didn't have a starch. I felt like, for $38 you could give me some mashed potatoes to soak up all this sauciness, right? I would have preferred a smaller piece of meat and a more balanced plate. My boyfriend got the burger and was happy with that.\n\nI don't have many complaints about the food, but it simply was not special enough that I'd bother going back when they had such awful service.", "author": "Amber C."}

I stalked it online waited for it's opening and then... nothing. A year goes by and I still never partook in the delicious. Then all of a sudden within 4 months, I went 3 times. \n\nThis place did not disappoint and was just as magical as I had hoped.  It accomplished this by serving three of my favorite things. \n\n1. Freshly Baked Popovers\n2. Bone Marrow\n3. Fried Chicken\n\nI'm salivating just thinking about it. \n\nThe popovers come out instead of bread and are warm, fluffy, light to the touch. I've learned in my 3x here to pair it with salted butter and devour as quickly as possible so when the waitstaff stops by again I can ask for more. \n\nThe bone marrow comes out in a generous portion (which is rare) and is served without capers which I personally think is way too salty to eat with bone marrow. I try to sop up all the deliciously flavorful oil with bread or the popovers. \n\nThe organic fried chicken is amazing. The batter is light, but crisp, evenly coated on every side. I also love that the seasoning isn't a rosemary base, which I think overpowers fried chicken most of the time. It is made with a buttermilk brine, roasted garlic and woody herbs. \n\nWe also tried the mac and cheese which was ok, pretty standard. I really liked the deviled eggs, so much we looked up the recipe to make them. But there are so many ingredients in it, that it deterred us from actually making them.\n\nThe dining area itself is beautiful, but the large rooms for private parties are fantastic. I booked the Billiards Room for Colonel Mustard with a candlestick and it was quite lovely. Ok, yes that was a cheesy reference, but I actually did book the Billiards Room for a larger dinner party of 12, and it was such an easy going experience. \n\nThey set up the table on top of the pool table and arrange chairs around it. It's actually pretty spectacular as they need booster cushions for everyone as the table becomes so high. I sitting next to a shorter friend of mine wondered how they were towering over me at the table, and notice... my cushion was missing. But the staff was extremely helpful and rectified that situation quickly. \n\nAlso great is that once the doors are closed, it's like we were transported into an old fashioned drawing room.

The brussel sprouts were cooked perfectly as well, I like that it had a char on the outside without being completely mushy or overcooked on the inside. \n\nBecause we liked both appetizers so much I had high hopes for the main course. Sadly, that's when the meal took a downhill course. We got the burger and fried chicken for main entrees. The burger was ordered medium, it came out well done and dry. I really liked the brioche type bun it came on and the gooey cheese and mushrooms on it, unfortunately the overcooked meat completely ruined it. The fried chicken was good but OMG good. It's definately cooked well because even the breast meat was juicy and tender. \n\nAt the end they came out and give you a small bite of dessert.

My daughter and I were walking down Sacramento Street intending to walk few blocks south to give Tadich Grill a try and we spotted the Wayfare Tavern from across the street. We were intrigued by the Wayfare's charming exterior and had to stop there. Were even more intrigued once we got inside. As we walked in the door, I felt as though we took a step back in time and we were walking into a country tavern in England. Someone has gone to great lengths applying the finest attention to the detail of the decor of this restaurant. Even the restroom that I visited on the second floor was well decorated. \n\nInstead of bread or rolls, diners are served popovers, which we loved, and we loved the way they are served by waitstaff out of a wire basket. Again, another example of the detail that has gone into this restaurant. \n\nMy daughter and I started off with the wedge and found it to be delicious. While we are used to wedges being smothered in blue cheese dressing, this wedge was finely flavored with a vinaigrette dressing and chopped sauteed red onions. \n\nI had the grilled branzino with roasted winter broccoli, mustard green pesto, house raisins and mustard flowers, and lemon pur\u00e9e. My daughter had the Santa Maria tri-tip, truffle butter, watercress and French fried potatoes. We finished our meal with a warm apple crisp.

Our waitress was very fake, quick, and not very warm, but the food was nothing short of AMAZING. The popovers were amazing. I HIGHLY recommend the poutine as a started - it was out of this world - so tasty!! We had gone wine tasting that day and had stopped here for dinner afterwards so we brought in a bottle of wine to have with dinner. The wine corkage was extremely high in my opinion.\n\nAs far as entr\u00e9es, the filet I ordered was veryyyyy salty. The waitress never came back after she initially served our entr\u00e9es, so I just dealt with the salty meal and cut off the exterior of the meat where it seemed to be the most salty. The waitress came back to check on us when we were pretty much done. I didn't complain about the filet since I was just exhausted and didn't have the energy to deal with it.\n\nThey did serve some decent yummy warm cookies when our bill was brought over, complimentary.\n\nOverall, the food was good. It probably would have been better with a better waitress. I would definitely check the place out again, if I'm ever back in the area.", "author": "Mandi C."}

After waiting a week for a weekend reservation, I ate at Tyler's much anticipated SF restaurant, Wayfare Tavern.  \n\nFor all newcomers, do not come here on a diet.  While most people would describe the menu as far from light, I found it to have an interesting dichotomy, comfort food with a California twist.  Now I am not from California, but I do know of Alice Waters and the birth of California cuisine: whole foods that use clean, crisp and light ingredients and flavors.  Tyler uses his southern upbringing and regional resources to bring an interesting take on California-esque comfort food.  I found it to be an compelling marriage.\n\nWe ordered the: \n\n- baked avocado with dungeness crab louis, smoked bacon and arugala\n- fried chicken\n- steak and eggs: petit filet, sunny side egg with toasted dungeness crab, asparagus and bearnaise\n- baked mac n  cheese\n- roasted heirloom summer squash and tomatoes\n- pineapple upside down cake with salted caramel ice cream and macadamia nut brittle\n\nThe food was simple and delicious, with the fried chicken definitely being the best entree of the night.  However, the true highlight of our meal was the dessert.  The cake of the pineapple cake was actually kind of dry, but the pineapple had a nice crispy texture (a la creme brulee) on top; but what blew us away was the homemade salted caramel ice cream and the macadamia nut brittle.  Serve that to me all night long, and I'll be a happy man.\n\nThe space and decor is really well-done, cozy, classy and rustic.  This probably contributes to the premium they place on their menu.  Overall, an enjoyable setting with good food and great dessert!", "author": "Brian S."}

Next time I go, I want to sit there :)!\n\nI loved the interior, it was a really warm and cozy decor. \n\nFor drinks, I started with a grey goose dirty martini- I wish I asked for an extra dirty martini since it was ok... \n\nBread: LOVED their popovers they are the best!! \n\nFor appetizers we got:\n-Ceasar Salad: Yes, its a salad... but it is a pretty awesome Ceasar salad. They say it is not too large but I personally think that one salad can easily be shared by 2 as I found it to be large. \n\n-Kobe Tartar- I usually order beef tartar when we see it and this was no different, they served it with their popovers with garlic & herbs.. If you love beef tartare, this one is AMAZING! \n\nDinner:\nFried Chicken- YUMMMMMYYY! This is pretty awesome fried chicken, it is pretty light, flavorful, super juicy, and I loved the addition of Rosemary... They give you a half a chicken. I would definitely have one of us order this again and share it while one of us gets something else to try. \n\nTwice baked potato- Loved their version of this as it doesn't feel too processed and you know exactly what they put on it. Simple but great. \n\nDessert: \nTheir doughnuts! They are so freaking good and you can dip them in jams and a custard like sauce. I loved it best with the plum jam. They change their dippings for their doughnuts every week. \n\nCappuccinos & espressos were great too especially with the doughnuts. \n\nTips: Get a reservation because people at the bar are annoying in getting in your space (but what do you expect it is a bar and some people don't really get when you are too close for comfort)... \n\nAlso- Good wines by the glass, I had a glass of wine with dinner. \n\nGreat for dates and had a very classy vibe but isn't \"fancy\" per se.", "author": "N N."}

Be sure to make reservations during the week, as a lot of business people like to come after work. And definitely check out the escargot and pineapple upside-down cake. \n\nI came for dinner with a friend on Wednesday, 25 May 2011. We made reservations to sit at the chef's counter, which gave us a great view of the kitchen. I highly recommend sitting at this counter. We ordered:\n\nEscargot ($13.00, French Burgundian snails, roasted garlic, parsley butter, bacon) - The snails were fantastic! They were very plump and tender. However, I thought the pesto sauce was too heavy on the olive oil... I was just in Paris the week prior, and over there I had escargot in a butter-pesto sauce.  I have to say I much prefer the butter-pesto. However, I would not hesitate to order this dish again (just wish it were more butter heavy).\n\nRoasted Beet Salad ($13.00, citrus aioli, goose berries, avocado mousse, quinoa) - This salad was good. I love beets.  The only complaint is that there was way too much aioli... it did overpower the rest of the dish too much. I'd order it again; however, I'd request for the aioli to be on the side next time.\n\nFried Chicken ($22.00, buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herbs, lemon) - I ordered this because everyone was talking about it. It was good and I could tell the meat had been brined because it was nice and juicy; however, I thought it could have been crispier on the outside, and thought there was a bit too much rosemary on the outside. The chicken definitely tasted better the next day straight out of the refrigerator! \n\nSteak Frites ($27.00, Tri-tip, truffle butter, watercress and french fried potatoes) - My friend ordered this and he loved it.  He'd order it again.\n\nForaged Mushrooms ($8.00, side with olive oil and spring garlic) - I ordered this as the side to my fried chicken. The mushrooms were so buttery. I loved it and would order it again.\n\nPineapple Upside-down Cake ($9.00, coconut ice cream, macadamia nut crumble) - They bring out the pineapple cake in a small pot, and flip it upside-down and onto a plate at your table.  The cake was delicious and went well with the coconut ice cream. I'd definitely order this again. \n\nAlong with a glass of wine ($18.00), French-press coffee ($5.00), two ginger beers ($3.50 x2) and sparkling water ($3.00), our total came to $125.00 + 12.30 tax + 4.40 Healthy SF tax + 30.00 tip = $171.70 for the two of us.", "author": "Rick S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-23", "description": "I was pretty disappointed with my experience here given all the hype. Let me count the ways:\n\n1. Wait even with reservation - We had reservations for 2 and arrived right on time, and ended up waiting about 20 minutes for our table.\n\n2. Everything we wanted to order was \"out.\" - First we wanted the cod entree. But our server didn't tell us they didn't have that until quite a while after we'd sat down with our menus and already made the mental decision to order that. \n\nThen we ordered the mushroom side dish. Our server took our order, but returned a few minutes later to tell us that they were out of that dish. He suggested the mushroom poutine as a substitute, which we ordered. He left for the kitchen and then came back again only to tell us that they were out of the mushroom poutine as well.\n\nSeriously, don't recommend things that you are \"out of\" and get better at your food inventory! We were there at 8pm, not even that late in the evening!\n\n3. Long times to get served - The table who sat next to us after we'd gotten there got their drinks before we did. Even our appetizer came out before our wine did!!\n\n4. Then it was the popovers fiasco - One of the popover servers saw that we were done with our first ones, and offered to get us another popover, which we thought was nice. We agreed because we were starving waiting for our food. But that person never came back with the popovers. Ten minutes later, another bread person came and offered us popovers, and we said yes, again. That 2nd person never came back either. Mind you, they proactively asked us two times if we wanted any popovers, but never followed through. Seriously?\n\n5. Redeeming qualities:\nThe food that we were able to order was good. I agree with the reviews that the grilled broccolini was great, as was the deviled eggs which was a redeeming. \n\nDisappointed so many times by all the dishes not being available, I couldn't find anything else that I wanted on the menu that we decided to just split the fried chicken entree instead. The nice thing about this is that it's such a large dish that the kitchen split it for us onto two plates.", "author": "Adelyn Z."}

They gave us anchovies in request.  \n\nMaybe having a view of the food prep wasn't so great.    A guy was making steak tartar and mixing it with a spoon.   He took the bowl behind a pillar, tasted it with a spoon and continued to mix it with the same spoon after adding more spicey sauce.  I appreciate the fact that he bothered to go behind the pillar to do that but he did it right in front of me!   He did this with several batches of steak tartar.    Remind me never to order that there.  \n\nWhen we were done we asked for a box for left overs and for our check.  The check they gave us was way way too high.   Upon inspection they have us someone else's check.   Glad I looked at it before turning over my credit card.  \n\nAfter getting back we realized we didn't get our left overs.    They have us a claim check to claim it from the front desk.   Why couldn't they have just given it straight to is so we wouldn't forget?\n\nThe food was good.   The experience was poor.    Not the way I like birthday celebrations to work out.   I would give lower rating but give them extra star for decent food.", "author": "Lawrence C."}

We had the place to ourselves. Loved the Di Stefano Burrata as an appetizer. For my entr\u00e9e, I finally got to taste fried sage, which was atop the buttermilk fried chicken. A big wow on the sage, semi-wow on the fried chicken (I've had better fried chicken, but kudos for the buttermilk brining), but the meal overall was very good. We had a side of the saut\u00e9ed green peppers, which was delicious, my husband loved the prosciutto & brie sandwich, even though its open-face aspect was a surprise. I paired it with the Manhattan, which as a dry version, didn't go great with the meal or my general preference, but the long day of driving to get to San Francisco made rye the best choice. My husband was very satisfied with his beer choice, his old standby of Lagunitas IPA in a very. Tall. Pilsner glass.\n\nWe're very glad we found this place, very near our hotel.

We also had the tri-tip steak and the beef short rib. Both were perfectly prepared and full of mouth-watering flavor.  We finished with fried apple pie - not something you see on every menu.  Nicely done.  Beautiful apple filling inside and shaped sort of like a turnover.  Our server was Sam - and he was impeccable.

Delicious. \n\nWe had a large party and were celebrating my sister's birthday. We made lunch reservations for a Saturday afternoon and were seated immediately. I appreciate the cozy, comfortable interior. \n\nWe were able to order several starters since we had a few (hungry) people in our party. For me, the stand outs were the tartare and the deviled eggs. I haven't met a deviled egg that I didn't like but the eggs were cooked perfectly and delicately seasoned but flavorful. The tartare was savory and moist - perfect with the popovers.\n\nSpeaking of popovers, Wayfare Tavern serves all you can eat popovers with butter in place of bread. The popovers were crusty on the outside but eggy, light and airy on the inside. As other reviewers recommend, try to not go for 3rd, 4th and 5th servings. If you ask, they will provide, of course but don't ruin your appetite for the main course!\n\nI made a crucial mistake - I changed my mind on what to order based on what everyone else was ordering at the table. I wanted to order the fried chicken but since 2 other people were ordering that at my table, I went with the grilled salmon sandwich. The salmon sandwich was just ok - good but not memorable. I opted for the side of fries and they were tasty but I would've been much happier with the fried chicken. Luckily, I was able to snag a few pieces off neighboring plates at my table. \n\nThe chicken was so moist! And the light fried batter was seasoned perfectly for me. I appreciated the accompanying fried herbs such as the thyme sprigs. The lemon on the side was juicy and provided a nice tang to the chicken pieces. Next time, I will not be dissuaded from ordering my first choice.\n\nAnother dish of note at our table during the main course was the burger. Wow. A fried egg is a must on that dish.\n\nService was stellar and very accommodating in helping us to celebrate the special birthday at our table. Can't wait to visit this place again - special occasion or not and get my hands on more fried chicken.", "author": "R L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-27", "description": "Tyler, I was impressed with you the first time, not so much the second.  I would rate my first experience 5 stars while my experience last night 3 stars, therefore averaging to 4 stars.\n\nMy friends and my first visit was Tuesday, July 13 for an 8:45pm reservation.  Although we waited almost 30 minutes to be seated, the staff was all very apologetic, it was truly a 5 star experience.  In fact, we liked the place so much that my friend decided to make reservations before we left for his birthday for 8:15pm yesterday.  We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation time and the table the hostess wanted to seat us at wasn't ready yet.  Although I walked by to go to see if there was an open table and the table we eventually were seated at was clear, we had to wait 25 minutes without as much as an apology for having us wait so long.  \n\nTo my disappointment, certain decadent dishes that were offered 2 weeks ago (the baked avocado and the oysters Rockefeller) have been taken off the menu.  NOTE:  The following food was ordered over a span of TWO visits to Wayfare.\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n*Oysters Rockefeller ($13) - YUM!!  Delicious baked oysters contained spinach, fennel and pork belly crumbs on top.  \n*Steak Tartare ($16/half order, $23 for a whole order) - DELICIOUS and a must order!!  Although I've only had steak tartare a couple of times, this is my favorite!!\n*Baked Avocado ($12) - YUMMY!  The baked avocado had Dungeness crab placed in the center and a strip of bacon placed on top.  The ingredients PERFECTLY complimented each other.\n*Salt Roasted Bone Marrow ($14, 2 pieces) - I love eating bone marrows but I thought this one was okay.  The molasses overpowers and drains out the natural marrow taste.\n*Grilled Monterey Bay Calamari ($10) - The calamari was okay.  \n*California Avocado & Hearts of Palm ($10) - Because the baked avocado is no longer offered, I decided to order this - no thank you.  Although the avocado had the perfect ripeness to it, the dish as a whole was too tangy and salty.\n*Baked Hog Island Oysters ($13) - Salt overload!!  The oysters were baked with roasted carrots, fennel, and pickles.  Upon biting into the oyster, I cringed at the amount of salt I tasted.\n\nSIDES ($8):\n*Baked Mac & Cheese - YUM!  A perfect amount of Jack cheese is used to create a not overly cheesy dish and then sprinkled with bread crumbs which gave the top later a slight crisp.\n*Roasted Asparagus - I hate to admit it, but we had to send the first order back to the kitchen, it was WAY too salty.  If you order the asparagus, request no sea salt.  Once the new dish was brought out, it was so much better.\n*Creamed Corn - Yummy.  I thought the baked creamed corn was delicious.  Some of my friends didn't like this, but hey, more for me.\n\nENTR\u00c9ES:\n*Organic Fried Chicken ($22) - Good, but I wish the exterior was a bit thicker to add that extra crisp.  A mix of white and dark meat comes on the platter.\n*Summer Corn & Goat Cheese Ravioli ($21) - Pass.  The dish has tons of corn, zucchini, and olives, but it all doesn't blend together very well and the dish lacks flavor.\n\nDESSERT ($8):\n*Peach Pie- YUM!  The crust was amazingly good and flakey and the peaches were sweet.  A scoop of goat's milk ice cream is placed on top and has a sweet and delicious flavor to it.\n*Baked Alaska - Yummy, this is the first place I've seen other than on a cruise ship, to have Baked Alaska.  Although the meringue was a bit sweet, it complemented the Napoleon style ice cream in the center.\n*Chocolate Story - OMG GOOD!!  Similar to the same texture as a chocolate mousse and containing rice crisps, this is certainly a must try for all chocolate lovers.\n\n$8 cake cutting fee per person, you might as well buy the desserts there.\n\nSERVICE:\nBoth times I was here, our waiters were great!  They were helpful and recommended dishes or wines we weren't quite sure about.  They were attentive without being overbearing.  \n\nAMBIANCE:\nWayfare is decorated similarly to a cabin with deer heads hanging on the wall in various areas.  There is seating on two floors with a library and pool table on the second.  Wayfare tends to get loud, so don't expect to have a quiet conversation.  Your best bet at a conversation is a table on the second floor, it's a bit quieter up there.", "author": "Nicole S."}

Yes, I know they're not something you eat everyday. Yes, I know you skipped lunch anticipating a high caloric dinner. Yes, I know your eyes are bigger than your stomach. But......its only bread. Besides you can easily make them at home.\n\nTIP #2: EAT YOUR VEGETABLES!\nChef Tyler sure loves his meat and potatoes, so I would suggest ordering a salad or side veggie like the roasted brussels sprouts as an appetizer. You'll thank me later......and your mama will too.\n\nTIP #3: SHARE AN ORDER OF DEVILED EGGS!\nOnly if you're a deviled egg person......and only after you've eaten your veggies. Don't make me nag you! \n\nTIP #4: DON'T SHARE THE COUNTRY STYLE PHEASANT TERRINE!\nWith beet-citrus marmalade, served on grilled sourdough. Don't pass this one around the table! Be a selfish hog. Just this once. Its ok.\n\nTIP #5: SKIP THE MAC & CHEESE!\nReally. You've had better. I'm sure.\n\nTIP #6: ORDER THE GUINNESS BRAISED LAMB SHANK!\nWith horseradish whipped potatoes, orange glazed carrots, toasted barley and watercress. This is SO Tyler. Big dinosaur lamb shank and taters. Its what's for dinner.\n\nTIP #7: SKIP THE GRILLED BONE-IN PORK CHOP!\nWith black pepper spaetzle, braised cabbage, apple pulp and grained mustard cream. This is a behemoth of a pork chop. This takes the cake over the dinosaur lamb shank. But bigger is not always better. Very few restaurants can make a decent tender mouthwatering pork chop. Wayfare Tavern is not one of them.\n\nTIP #8: ORDER THE SAUTEED SEA BASS!\nWith Savoy cabbage, forest mushrooms, potato puree and English mustard breadcrumbs. It was a bit of a strange and heavy combination for sea bass, but it grew on me. Maybe it'll grow on you too.\n\nTIP #9: SKIP THE CHOCOLATE CREAM PIE!\nOr skip dessert all together......unless you want to roll home with your pants unzipped. No nightcap or late night clubbing for you. \n\nTIP #10: GATHER A GROUP OF FRIENDS AND RESERVE THE POOL ROOM!\nYes, you heard me......the pool room/private dining room on the second floor where the dining table doubles up as a pool table! Phucking brilliant. You too can close down the restaurant and share some good times with your friends.\n\nYou're welcome.", "author": "Anastasia B."}

Well, we find out the hard way, not on Sunday.  I would say the table was awful - in a horrible location and super uncomfortable, getting in and out was awkward.  The service was okay - nothing memorable.  What was more disappointing was the food.  The highlight of the meal were the popovers, but that isn't what should make a restaurant stand out.  The burrata starter I had was covered in hard pears and was way too sweet, the shrimp cocktail was lackluster and the presentation was awful.  Entrees were okay - I had the fried chicken, but laying on top of my chicken was a bundle of herbs (tons of them).  I always understood that you should put something on a plate that you can't eat?  My daughter had the Waygu Beef Bourguignon, which was inedible - it was swimming in red wine.  We tried to end the evening with the doughnuts and some espresso drinks.  They were okay, but when I went to ask for just a plain coffee refill on my finished latte, the guy said, well that will be another $4?  Seriously?  We just spent $350 for a meal and you want to nickel and dime us for a coffee refill.  We also noticed later on the bill that they charged for soda refills (a pet peeve of mine).

This server truly made our Christmas celebration as wonderful as could be on Friday night.  5-stars for service.\n\nWe specifically asked for upper floor seating when we arrived an hour early for our reservation. The hostess said no problem and we sipped our cocktails in the tiny, noisy, packed, bar area while we waited, standing up.  The drink glasses, both martini & cocktails, were laughably tiny.  I mean really.  2-stars for the smallest drink glasses we have ever seen.\n\nOur group was guided toward a table downstairs in the noisy bar promptly at our reservation time - oops.  No.  Not happening.  Not a problem, the hostess promptly found seating for us upstairs on the 2nd floor.  Whew!  Perfect.   \n\nWe ordered a bottle of delicious red wine and relaxed, enjoyed our dinner, our guests, and soaked in the cozy & festive atmosphere.  5 stars for atmosphere.\n\nThe fried chicken was good, other yelpers described it perfectly; crispy, tender and juicy with an herbal flavor.  The bacon-wrapped filet was cooked perfectly.  A special request for a side of plain mashed potatoes - not a problem.  The green salad with green goddess dressing was salty for my taste but absolutely acceptable.  The hearts of palm salad was basically a whole avocado with sliced hearts of palm scattered w/ cucumber and a drizzle of lime dressing on the side.  Interesting but you better like avocado.  I was not a fan of the popovers.  I did not find them tasty, a little too hard and plain for me.   Solid 3-stars for food, the most important category of all.\n\nDinner entrees were overpriced in my opinion, sides are sold separately.

After all the rushing, the wine didn't arrive for 30 minutes.  \n\nAs starters we ordered the chips and onion dip.  The chips were so salty they were inedible.  My popover plate with half the popover on it was removed before I was finished.  We also ordered the oxtail appetizer.  We were disappointed in that it was served over soggy slimy  French fries which did nothing for the oxtail.  Seemed like sloppy Midwestern diner food.\n\nNow onto dinner.  Despite my direct query about the portion size of the chicken entree, he said it was suitable for one person's meal. Further, he suggested we should order more sides.  Who eats 4 pieces of chicken in one sitting?!  We felt like the server was selling us a used car.\n\nThe broccolini  was too salty, and again,  inedible.\n\n Two guests in our party ordered the scallops and thought they were good.\n\nOverall, it was a totally disappointing experience.  The restaurant clearly has an eye toward upselling but missed the mark.  We would have ordered more wine and perhaps dessert if they hadn't been so hurried in trying to get us fed and out the door.  Oh, and by the way, for this grand experience of two apps, four entrees, one side, and one $60 bottle of wine, our total (with gratuity, which I'm not sure why we paid) was almost $400.

I have been to Wayfare both for lunch and dinner countless times, so it was a no-brainer to have our wedding reception here. Who would have ever thought that our reception would end up being a complete nightmare? \n\nBefore finalizing our contract through Wayfare, we scheduled an appointment with the Private Dining Director, so we can take a look at the dining room upstairs, go over the menu and to have any questions answered before we make a final decision on making this our venue. As I was rushing to Wayfare after work for our appointment, I decided to give the Private Dining Director a call to let him know that I will be running 5 minutes late. Someone else at Wayfare picks up the phone and tells me that the Private Dining Director already left for vacation. He apparently completely forgot about our appointment. I was heated (for obvious reasons). Yup, complete nightmare for a bride. \n\nAfter emails & calls apologizing for the mishap, my husband and I gave Wayfare the benefit of the doubt and decided to book our wedding reception at Wayfare. Everything was working out great until it was time for our wedding reception. \n\nMy brother bought us bottles of Dom Perignon as a part of our wedding gift. I specifically requested to have these bottles chilled in our dining room, since I knew my brother would appreciate seeing these bottles and also my husband and I both wanted him to know that we appreciate his kind gift. When it was time for the champagne toast, we noticed that the champagne was served lukewarm! (Who serves Dom Perignon at room temperature?!?!?!) I apologized to my brother for this - I was ready to blow my top, but tried to keep calm. \n\nWhile we were all eating our entrees, I noticed that none of the bottles of wines that we brought for our reception were being served. I asked one of the servers what happened to the bottles we brought in, he mentioned that he served one entire red bottle to only the first table. I asked him what happened to the rest of the bottles and he mentioned that he wasn't sure if the bottles that I brought in were enough for the entire party, so he decided not to serve them. I was livid at this point. We paid for corkage fees for all the bottles that we brought in and yet he makes the decision on his own to not serve the wines we brought in?? Our party consisted of many guests that do not consume alcohol, so we brought a total of 10 bottles. The arrangement was that in the event we needed more wine, we were going to purchase the wines at their restaurant, so what he did was completely uncalled for. \n\nYES....THERE'S MORE. \n\nWhat completely set me off was my husband's best friend was still enjoying his filet when one of the servers took his plate away without asking if he was done eating. My husband's best friend couldn't believe it. This same exact thing happened to my dad as well. We had more than enough time, why the rush? What kind of server does that?!?! My husband's best friend asked for a plate since the food he was working on was taken away from him and the server's response was \"I guess that's fair.\" Uhhh....REALLY? \n\nI was completely embarrassed in front of my guests at our wedding reception. My mom was crying because she couldn't believe any of this was happening on my wedding day. \n\nWayfare Tavern was more than happy to take my money while providing awful service.   I understand that things do not always workout as planned, especially on our wedding day, but clearly these \"incidents\" were not accidental, which is why I had to write this really long review. (Sorry for the novel!)\n\nTo all the brides out there, I DO NOT recommend Wayfare Tavern. They made my wedding reception memorable......in a horrific way.", "author": "Juli S."}

I love the atmosphere and decor of the place.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I thought the service could have been better (note: I'm in the food business and I love great service).  Our server was pleasant but I wouldn't go so far as to say she was nice or friendly. \n\nI also included a message in my open table reservation stating it was a birthday celebration but it seems my message was ignored.  There was no acknowledgement of our dinner being a celebration AT ALL.  It's not a big deal, but it also doesn't give them 5 stars.  I didn't want anything free, but a verbal \"happy birthday\" from someone would have been nice. \n\nFood:\nStarters: \n-American Kobe Tartare: Very good!  The tartare was tender and moist.  It wasn't chewy and did not have any (noticeable) sinew.  It was delicious with the garlic popover. \nWarning= There was a raw yolk, so if you're not comfortable with that request to have it omitted.\n\n-Deviled Eggs: The deviled eggs were good but not rave-worthy.  \n\nEntrees: \n-Organic Fried Chicken: *** OMG.  I loved the fried chicken!!  It was juicy and delicious. I obviously recommend it.  It was herby and cooked well.\n\n-Ahi Tuna Carpaccio: I could have skipped this dish.  It was okay, but the ahi needed more omph.  I didn't care for the plating of this dish either; it was a bit cluttered and messy.\n\n-Grilled Asparagus: YUM!  There were cooked perfectly and were very tasty.  I love garlic and these were covered with toasted garlic.\n\n-Baked Macaroni & Cheese: This dish was very tasty as well.  It was made with vella dry jack and smoked olive oil.  It was rich and creamy.\n\nDessert:\n-Latte:  The latte was made with Peet's coffee and whole milk.  It was decently made; the espresso wasn't pulled too long and the foam was a little airy (not as creamy as I would prefer) but I lived and still enjoyed my cup of latte. \n(We skipped dessert in order to get ice cream @ Smitten!)\n\n\nService: \nThe service as a whole was decent, but there were certain things I didn't like.  It was hard to capture the attention of our server (Raquel, so said our bill), even when she was at the table next to us.  It seemed she had tunnel vision and didn't scan her tables.  I dropped my knife on the floor at one point of the meal -we had a lot of food for our little table- and it made this huge clattering sound on the wood floors and yet NO server or SA came over to give me new knife. I couldn't even get the attention of anyone so I had my boyfriend reach behind and get me a new knife (lucky seating ;) )\nWe couldn't finish all our food so we had the left overs packed to go.  They gave us a claim ticket for our food.  When Raquel gave it to us she just tossed it on the table instead of placing it nicely on the table.. WTH?\n\nAll in all recommended!", "author": "Nikki L."}

Unfortunately, the only reservation available was at 9:00 PM, which we consider to be too late for dinner. Frustrated by this, I frantically searched Yelp for another restaurant to go to. After an hour of searching, I stumbled upon Wayfare Tavern. My boyfriend decided to give them a call and luckily, they had a 5:00 PM reservation open on a Tuesday Night.\n\nAfter dining at Wayfare Tavern, my boyfriend and I both agreed that this was the best dining experience that we've ever had.  The food and service were both AMAZING. We will definitely return here again if we travel to San Francisco in the future.\n\n\nThe Food: Everything came out in a timely manner. \n\nWe started off with a Virgin Mojito and a glass of 2007 Ancient Peaks Cabernet Sauvignon Paso Robles. Both were decent drink options, but not ones that we would have again.\n\nOur appetizers included the Roasted Kabocha Squash Soup and the Deviled Eggs. We enjoyed that the soup was poured into the bowl right in front of us. The soup, however, was a little bit salty for our tastes. Although, the ravioli at the bottom of the bowl was a nice touch. The deviled eggs were delicious! My boyfriend, who doesn't care for deviled eggs, loved them -- that shows how good they were.\n\nWe decided to have the Grilled Santa Maria Tri-Tip Steak and Sonoma Pork Belly for our entrees with a side of Baked Macaroni & Cheese.  The Grilled Santa Maria Tri-Tip Steak came out perfectly cooked and the Crisp Kennebec Potatoes that it came with were to die for!  The Sonoma Pork Belly was another winner.  Even though the entrees were good, I must admit that my favorite dish (out of the entire meal) was the Baked Macaroni and Cheese. I've tried several macaroni & cheese dishes, but none of them compare. This one was rich, creamy, and DELICIOUS! I crave it sometimes, but I know that I will never be able to taste it again unless I visit San Francisco.\n\nFinally, we finished the night with Wayfare Tavern's Spiced Pumpkin Pudding Cake.  This was another winner.  It was soft, moist, and straight out of the oven. What more could you ask for? All the ingredients were so different but they came together in harmony. What attracted us to this dish was that it had honeycomb from Tyler's backyard, which was yummy.\n\n\nThe Service: EXTRAORDINARY. This is the most attentive service that we have ever received at a restaurant. Each time our water glasses were half empty, one of the workers were at our table refilling our cups! Also, my boyfriend happened to drop his fork on the floor and no sooner was it replaced with a new one.  We thought no one had seen this happen, but to our surprise one of the other servers did. This shows just how attentive the servers are to their customers!  Also, whenever we had a question, any of the servers were more than willing to answer it.  The bartender was also a very nice and sophisticated gentleman.\n\nOur server was very timely.  He was kind enough to take the dessert off of our tab because it didn't arrive within a reasonable amount of time.  We found that unnecessary because we didn't even notice how long the dessert was taking, as my boyfriend and I were enjoying each others company and the restaurant's atmosphere. Thank you Alvin for being such a great waiter!\n\nOverall, I would have to say that I LOVE Wayfare Tavern.  EVERYTHING about it was great.  My only complaint is that there isn't a location in Honolulu, Hawaii! Hopefully Tyler Florence will soon expand his operations and open one here :)", "author": "Lynn W."}

We were seated just an arm's length away from another table and could hear everything they were saying, so that kind of killed our romantic night. \n\nService is all super nice though. Our waitress was really sweet. We overheard one waiter politely ask a table if they wouldn't mind moving to accommodate a larger party coming in and throwing in a glass of wine for their inconvenience. \n\nI thought the food was sadly just okay. We ordered:\nthe famous fried chicken\nside of mac n cheese\navocado and palm of hearts salad\ngrilled octopus appetizer\nbutcher's filet with fancy onion rings \n\nand a glass of champy for me and a very strong and well-made manhattan for the hubby. We were served the popovers upon seating, which I liked because they were quite hot and fresh. Yummy.\n\nI was quite disappointed by the fried chicken, which was my main dish. The first piece I had was way too dry, and I tried to squeeze extra lemon on it to soften it up. The second was actually underdone and was a bit bloody in the middle - gross! The mac n cheese was okay, didn't have that much flavor at all. I like mac n cheese to be either super cheesy or peppery, and this was slightly bland with breadcrumbs on top.\n\nNone of the food was that spectacular, but the ambiance and drinks were really nice.

The panzanella just didn't work with the sauce not fitting the rest, and the ricotta salata was hardly noticeable, the butcher's filet was overdone, and we couldn't even be comforted by the service (we were served with dessert menu after the foie - guess our faces looked sour enough to the extent that they thought we needed something sweet, we repeatedly lost our butter despite asking that it remain on the table, etc. etc. etc.).\n\nI remember things to be substantially different, but at the moment the city has too many better dinner options for me to return here any time soon.", "author": "tal n."}

It's high end and elegant \"pub grub.\"  This is just plain awesome.  I suspected I was in love with this place immediately upon reviewing the menu ;)  \n\nWe hopped in at lunch time without a reservation and our best bet was at the bar.  The bartender started us off with some amazing homemade potato chips.  Then he made me a perfect bloody mary (the best one i'd had in San Fran yet).  \n\nAnd then, out of nowhere this waiter brings out some bread.  After looking at it I realize it's homemade Yorkshire pudding.  My absolute favorite.  It was delicious.  Had I not ordered lunch already, I would have been content to get drunk and eat the Yorkshire all day long.  \n\nMy steak tartare came out and it was elegant and delicious.  My wife ordered the asparagus salad and it was equally good.  \n\nWe split the steak frittes and loved it.  Sure, we went with the safe bets, but it was our first time.  This at the top of my list to go back to when I get back in to San Fran.  Next time I will do the deviled eggs (now that I know I should've had em before) and the fried chicken.

I love the old school lodge-y feel. \n\nOur waiter was nice enough but I think he was forgetful. It took awhile to get anything we asked for...which was mildly annoying.\n\nOnto the food!\n\nPopovers: They give these babies out instead of bread. Served piping hot with a crusty outside ond pillow like inside. Slather with black sal butter. Yum.\n\nDeviled eggs: They're curried deviled eggs. Cute presentation. Delicious...but they're deviled eggs. I could make them.\n\nButter Lettuce Salad: Apparently whole leaf lettuce salads are trendy in SF. I find it annoying but besides that. There was pretty much zero dressing on the salad. I totally understand the 'lightly dressed' thing...but only the top leaf had a drizzle of dressing. All of the other leaves were bone dry. We asked for more dressing and it took forever to come out. After the dressing the salad was fine. Nothing exciting.\n\nButcher's Filet: The sauce was great and my companions loved the meat. I think I had an end piece because I found it a bit tough. Great onion ring on top...nice and crunchy.\n\nVeal Schnitzel: I'm generally anti veal for all those PETA reasons but someone else chose it. It was very good. The exterior was very crunchy and the braised cabbage was great accompaniment. I found the pickled apples to be too strong on the vinegar but everyone else liked them.\n\nPacific Black Cod: Coming from Hawaii we love our butterfish. This was a beautiful thick piece of cod. Perfectly cooked so it was soft and falling apart. The cod fritter was so-so but who needs that when you have such a great piece of fish already?\n\nChocolate Cream Pie: Great crust and a perfect filling. Well executed\n\nMandarin Sorbet: Very refreshing. The taste was spot on. I wish I could buy this by the carton.\n\nOverall I thought it was very well done. The food was done well and tasted great.

A mound of burrata accompanied by tender figs made my heart sing, and citrusy avocado and hearts of palm did an enjoyable pas de deux in my mouth.  Marin tomatoes were a delight, but please, Tyler dear, remove the stems prior to serving.  You know I'm a lazy beast.\n\nThe butter lettuce, crisp and engaging, was like smelling fresh cut grass on a summer day and my halibut with tomatoes and artichoke hearts was a dream.\n\nYou dashed my hopes by thoughtlessly removing the 7-layer coconut cake for which I had been pining, so alas, alack, dessert was not had.  Perhaps on a later date, mi amore.\n\nYour waitstaff minions were attentive, though the 40 minute break between our app courses and entrees (which initially came luke warm) was frustrating and went unrewarded.

I've heard nothing but praise for the food, atmosphere and service. Maybe my expectations were to high.. maybe they were having an off night.. who knows.\n\nWe came for a friend's 30th birthday and luckily had a reservation because it was beyond PACKED. You have to squirm your way through the initial bar area to get to your table which is kind of awkward. \n\nOur server came and acted odd from the beginning. She was kind of cold and standoffish but we just made the best of it and laughed it off. The popovers came shortly after and I quickly forgot about the snooty waitress- HEAVEN IN MY MOUTH. Those popovers are to die for. That alone is worth a trip to Wayfare Tavern!\n\nWe ordered 4 appetizers amongst 5 of us- deviled eggs, steak tartare, burrata and poutine. Being a Canadian, there is a high standard for poutine but I really liked Wayfare's interpretation. All of the appetizers were amazing.. definitely the best part of our meal.\n\nI ordered the buttermilk friend chicken as my main and was semi disappointed. I don't eat tons of fried chicken to compare it to but I think Little Skillet's fried chicken blows it out of the park. Wayfare's chicken was dry and overly dressed with rosemary and other herbs. There were no sides or sauce which was also a downer. \n\nWe ordered a couple of desserts but the standout dish was the sticky pudding. Delicious! I will definitely be back for dessert again :)\n\nOverall a fun experience. Not a great place for a date night, it is better for groups.", "author": "Seema M."}

I've had fried chicken at lots of places in SF and in the South and this was, by far, one of the best.  I'm still amazed at how moist the chicken breast meat was.  The buttermilk brine must allow it to retain all the juices because in all seriousness, that breast meat was more moist than the rotisserie chicken at Limon Rotisserie.  It had the right amount of crispiness and flavor - the herbs used in the batter makes it  SO GOOD!\n\nI also had the Fig and Melon salad which was very refreshing but probably should have been plated differently.  The mac n' cheese was very cheesy and could have been extra delicious and rich with just a few drops of truffle oil.  My friend had the Butchers Filet and it had a smokiness quality that was so yummy.\n\nWe were lucky that there were two no shows at the Chef's counter (we did have reservations which you need - the place was packed).  Highly recommend sitting there if you're a foodie and like to watch the show.  \n\nWill be back to try the duck and the desserts.

We went to Maverick, House of Prime Rib and this place blew us away. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n- Kobe beef tar tare with pesto popovers and raw egg!  - this was incredible.  We've had carpaccio at Flemings Steakhouse in SD but this place went even further with the raw egg! Madness.\n\n- Fried Chicken - whoa.  Best fried chicken ever.  The breading attached actual herbs to the skin! There was a giant sage leaf inside the crispy goodness.\n\n- we added the curried squash and mac and cheese.  The curried squash was the best it was sweet and silky.  The mac and cheese was a little too soupy for my taste.  I usually like denser mac and cheese.\n\n- for dessert we ordered the peach pie with brown butter ice cream and fried rosemary - exquisite.  They even put a candle and sang happy birthday to my bf!\n\nThe server was really sweet.  A super tall woman with brown hair - she was great and very accommodating.\n\nThe ambiance of the place was very stately - with taxidermy and equestrian paintings all over.

Perfect portion size, the fried rosemary, thyme and sage along with fresh lemon, it was just perfect.\n\nHad the garlic Kennebuc fries which were pretty decent, served with ketchup and a mustard sauce of some kind.\n\nMy dining partners also had the fried chicken and one had the halibut which she raved about.  Two more sides of mac and cheese (another OMG moment) and creamed corn (this was the miss of the meal).\n\nThe creamed corn tasted like white sweet corn with light cream poured over. No salt, no pepper, no spice, no butter (that I could taste) no depth of flavor, just SWEET corn.  It was more of a sweet dish than savory. It just needed something, but maybe that's what creamed corn is supposed to taste like?\n\nAlso the popovers that come just before and along with the meal were probably the best popovers I've ever had. Kudos on those.\n\nThe place was packed, service was over the top good. I'd definitely go back...three meals with three sides and three soft drinks (no alcohol or wine) came to $135 with tax and tip.

Although it was busy, it wasn't packed, and the two of us were quickly seated without a reservation. Tavern is an apt description - it's dark, with lots of wood and leather. \n\nService: Friendly and prompt. Explained the special and made some conversation, but not too much. We were served the much-touted popovers soon after being seated and getting water. Sever had the kitchen split our appetizer salad onto two beautifully presented plates without us having to ask, and did the same with our burger. Not a long wait between courses, but we never felt rushed. \n\nFood: \n\n-Shared the heirloom tomato, cucumber and couscous salad with greek yogurt and honey base. Tomatoes were colorful, firm and tasty. Couscous added great texture. The greek yogurt/honey base was subtle- not at all overly sweet. A few shaved onions added a little kick. Perfectly portioned for two to share. ($16)\n\n-Burger was cooked perfectly to our specification of medium. A think patty was layered with melted brie, grilled sweet onions and thick, hand-cut bacon. The onion, brie and bacon were evenly distributed, so every bite had all the flavors. The bun was simple but fresh. Accompaniment of outwardly crispy, inwardly warm fries seasoned with parsely and seasalt were tasty and plentiful. House cured pickles, served with the burger, were tangy. This burger was a real winner and quite large enough to share if also sharing a simple starter. ($19) \n\nWine: \n\nWines by the glass list had about 15 solid choices, but most were in the $14 range. There was one Pinot Gris for $9 and a few reds for $10. I chose a Foxglove Cab Sav ($10). \n\nA couple of minor points (truly minor, but the reasons it's 4 and not 5 stars in my book):\n\n-While the other tables around us were offered 2nd, 3rd and 4th popovers. Not that anyone needs more than one, but they are delicious, and our waiter scooped up our bread plates after we had only one a piece and never offered us more. \n\n- There was a noticeable and awkward gap between when our salad/bread plates were cleared and our burger appeared. It was probably no more than 15 minutes, but during that time the waiter never came by. So, a bit of a timing issue. \n\n- Although it is a pricy place, It would be nice to see a few more wines by the glass in the 9-10 buck range. \n\nOverall a super great choice and well worth the splurge.", "author": "Jenni D."}

The fish itself was cooked pretty well and a just tad underseasoned, but the tomato/vegetable sauce that came with it was soooo salty.  I thought I would be able to eat it so I kept eating the fish and by the time I realized it was salty beyond acceptable, I felt bad to ask them to make it again.  Plus I didn't want the rest of the group to wait for me to get my dish either.  When they cleaned up the plates, I let the waiter know and he simply said, he'll let the chef know and that was it.

It was pretty good.  To be honest, most tartares tend to taste pretty similar to me, at least in terms of texture and spices.

However, I have to warn you that the oxtail gravy is more just oxtail.  There's no real gravy.  I\"ve never really had poutine before, but I have to say this was pretty good.

It was nice and all, but it was a little too much for my taste.\n\nProsciutto and Brie Sandwich - 3 Stars - It's an open faced sandwich.  I wish it'd say that on the menu.  I'm giving this 3 stars because I don't like prosciutto that much due to how salty it is.  So make sure you take my review of this item with a grain of salt (haha!).  Comes with some mushrooms.

Normally, I don't like cooked salmon but this one was cooked perfectly with a crispy edge and buttery interior.  The fava mash (looks like guacamole) brought the dish together quite well.  The butcher's filet with bone marrow bordelaise and onion was also a hit although not as spectactular for me.  The only disappointment for me was the chicken paillard, which I thought was a little dry and bland.  The crunchy turnips, however, that accompanied the dish, were amazing.\n\nThe housemade doughnuts were good but especially liked the sides of lemon curd and ollalieberry & raspberry jams.\n\nFor drinks, the Texas Kiss sounded great (bourbon, sweet potato syrup and barbecue salt) but it was way too sweet.  Served with essentially a BBQ potato chip on top.  Meh.\n\nOn the other hand, both red and white wines were a hit, especially the Tyler Florence Cabernet and Sauvignon Blanc, which were pretty pricey at $17 and $12 a glass, respectively.

I'm a huge fan of Tyler Florence and as my first dining experience at one of his restaurant I expected wonderful deliciousness...I was not disappointed! \n\nOur group of three decided on a few shared dishes:\nTo start- \nDeviled Eggs- simply seasoned with Old Bay and topped with rock shrimp. Your basic deviled egg, dressed up with the addition of a small rock shrimp. \nButter Lettuce Salad- lightly dressed with a fresh green goddess type dressing and tossed with mandarin orange segments and sliced avocado. Refreshingly delicious!\nAdditionally, instead of a traditional bread basket or dinner rolls, they bring you these warm, light, airy and flaky popovers. So good! \nFor our entrees-\nOrganic Fried Chicken- Crispy and flavorful (and not super greasy) juicy half chicken finished with a bundle of fried herbs piled atop it and a few roasted garlic cloves. Loved the perfect crisp crunch and the tender, juicy chicken. The fried mixed herbs gave it an added hint of flavor. \nSliced Steak (don't recall the exact name!)- Cooked medium, sliced and served atop a bed of creamed corn with a rich au jus sauce to complement the dish. Super tender strips of steak and the fresh creamed corn combined for a great comforting but sophisticated dish.\nWe were all a bit full, but saved space for one of their delectable desserts.

This is what it is known for (well aside from it being owned by the Famous Tyler Florence).  It is hard to make the normal \"American\" cuisine fancy but this chef did it.  Nothing really striking about any particular dish (deviled eggs, soup, etc) aside from the fried chicken cooked to perfection.  Also, the Mac & cheese was really good but really heavy.  Left the place about to burst and pass out from a food coma.\n\nI do want to try the Kobe Tartare next time!

It all emanates his style that is reflected in his show, \"Tyler's Ultimate\" and recipes that are featured in some of his books.  \n\nThis place has a very urban yet kind of rustic feel to it, but mostly very homey with a fireplace and comfortable seating in large booth styled tables.  Upstairs has more dining room style seating with a very nice decor. \n\nThe bar near the entrance is a very nice full bar with an excellent selection of wines.  The people that I meet here are usually very influential people of San Francisco but are some of the nicest people as well.  This place has a great crowd.\n\nIf you're with very few people, I'd definitely recommend sitting at the bar where the food is prepared.  Here you can see all the chefs prepare all the meals and even talk with them about the food or anything.  I met a pastry chef there who had the molecular structure of chocolate tattooed on his forearm.  So cool!\n\nThe popovers you get are excellent as well. Light, fluffy and tasty! \n\nMy favorite dish is the fried chicken.  The fried chicken is prepared in a buttermilk batter with a few spices then the oil is flavored with herbs such as, thyme, rosemary, sage, and garlic.  It is served to you with all the sprigs of toasted herbs scattered on the chicken with a few wedges of lemon on the side.  The chicken is so aromatic and fragrant from all the herbs you just can't wait to dig in! This is the best flavors of traditional fried chicken with added soulful depth; I can never look at fried chicken the same again.  \n\nOh ya, best creamiest Mac N Cheese ever!\n\nAs a person who is not much of a dessert perspon, I get dessert here every time I am here because they are freshly prepared dishes with some of the best ingredients.  I highly recommend dessert.  \n\nOne thing that must not be looked over at all is the staff.  They are so professional and on top of their job.  Not just that, they're all very social, nice, personable, people.  Every time I come here we always meet a new waiter/waitress or some other staff member who talks to us about the restaurant or various other subjects.  This is a place that must not be overlooked hidden in an old building off of little sacramento street.   I'm here every time I'm in the city!", "author": "Adri\u00e1n G."}

I DVR'ed \"Food 911\", which a show where seemingly eager, mostly yuppie-ish white girls would look puppy dog-eyed at Tyler Florence as he took over their yuppie-ish apartment kitchens and taught them how to cook salmon and sea bass. He was super awkward and sorta dorky and he taught some great principles and I loved it and him and watched it religiously when I was on leave taking care of my newborn son. Fast forward to last night when I got to go to Wayfare Tavern, his restaurant in the city, for a birthday dinner with a friend.  I was psyched! The food was good for sure, but underwhelming and sorta bland, and the service was okay, but not top notch. The company was awesome, so we had a great time, but the \"warm olives\" were neither warm nor presented well and that's a huge miss, because I think if it's presented better and actually warmer, the olives would be buttery and fall off the pits, but instead, this was just a plate of well...olives.  We had the sea bass and I secretly pictured a 24 year old girl making it for us now that she's mastered it under Tyler's tutelage, and that was definitely good, the octopus side was good, but the mac and cheese and tagliatelle were both pretty bland and disappointing. The best thing is probably the donut dessert, as the apple crisp wasn't super great.  If you're thinking of going, I would say, there's probably someplace better, but you don't have to go into the city...there are so many good ones elsewhere, like in the east bay. I don't know that I want Tyler to be my bff anymore, so that's sad, but the donuts were yummy.", "author": "Mike D."}

I have to admit, the desserts weren't my favorite, and i probably should have had the peach pie which i was eyeing from the start.  Oh well, next time...\n\nThe highlight of the meal...and my month thus far was when Tyler himself came out of the ktichen to greet us and ask how we liked our food.

The bartenders hair was a complete mess, she kept fixing it in the mirror on the floor behind the bar.

I thought they should have given more than three tiny pieces of crostini, (especially since it was the cheapest thing on the plate.) \nBone marrow: I tried it, it's not my thing, but others seemed to like it. \nDeviled eggs: these were good, but once again, nothing spectacular. \n\nI had the halibut entree that was supposed to come with clams. When I noticed they were missing, I flagged down a floor manager, (he was the only staff member I could find)  he apologized, and brought me out a bowl of clams in the sauce they were supposed to be in. He said Tyler cooked them himself, I don't know if this is true, but I will say the broth they came out in was MUCH more flavorful than the (supposedly) same broth that was on my original dish. \nI liked my dish, and the halibut was cooked well, but it didn't blow me away. \n\nI did steal a bite of my guy's burger and fries, and both were great.

Since we had a party larger than 10, we were given a special menu where we were to pick three appetizers dishes to share, three main course options (where we got to choose our own on the night of), and two different dessert options to be shared as well. It was a flat fee of $70/pp +tip/tax. \n\nAppetizers:\n* Steak Tartare - absolutely amazing. I love beef tartare, but this dish just made me love it even more (is that possible?)\n* Seared Ahi Tuna with Roasted Beets Salad - This dish was pretty well executed as well. Enjoyable.\n* Di Stefano Burrata - It just reminded me of cheese spread on a crostini - I could've had the meal without this; it  didn't seem like anything special and didn't blow me away either.\nDefinitely wish we could've tried the deviled eggs, but majority ruled and the eggs lost. All us diners also got a popover to consume, however I don't know why it was so special! I heard so many people talking about it, but I just didn't think much of it - maybe it just wasn't for me, because I didn't even bother to finish it. I was expecting more of a flaky texture.\n\nEntree:\nI chose to get me some Fried Chicken, y'all! Portions for this was larger than I expected - a whopping FIVE pieces of chicken (white meat, dark meat, wings and more). The meat was juicy and it was finger-lickingly good.\n\nDessert:\n* Sticky Toffee Pudding - my expectations were too high for this one. I was expecting something amazing, and only consumed something average.\n* Huckleberry cream puff - This was surprisingly nice. The cream was light and delicate but packed full of huckleberry flavor. The actual puff could have been crispier and less dense though.\n\nOur group ordered two bottles of wine, a red and white. Unfortunately, I can't remember the red, however, we got the 2010 Cold Heaven Voignier which was just like the name said - heaven! I'm not usually a white wine gal, but I truly loved this one and would order it again in a heartbeat next time I wine and dine. \n\nService was pretty good, decor was lovely beyond imagination (really put you back into the early 1900's era). \n\nIf I ever get the privilege of dining here again, I'd love to sit downstairs right in front of the kitchen - hopefully to catch a glimpse of Tyler Florence!\n\nTF wasn't at the restaurant when we went, however our waitress was so kind enough to get us pre-signed cards from Tyler himself thanking us for dining at his restaurant.

The breading itself was super light and flavorful, and the meat was tender and juicy, I mean you knew it was gonna be good the moment you cut into it. The leg, of course, is the best part, so really if you're a slow eater and like to save the best for last, like me, eat that last.\n\nAlso, the sea urchin appetizer. Who knew sea urchin could taste that good in an american dish. With the butter lettuce and what I believe was a burrata cheese or something resembling it, was really good. It brought forward the natural sweetness of uni that I love so much. \n\nThe wayfare burger was perfectly cooked as well. We ordered it with a fried egg on top, which really only made it better.

I heard so many good this about this restaurant but our experience was AWFUL! The waiter was extremely rude, barley ever came to our table and did not deserve the tip we left for him. It took 45 mins to get our drinks and over 90 mins for our dinner. At the end meal, two people asked for boxes and the meals we're put into the same box. We explained to the hostess the two people were going to two different house and they threw a fit about providing us a second box...beyond disappointed and would never recommend this restaurant to anyone I know!

THIS THING IS HUGE) a chocolate cream pie. i truly think about this every day and ever since, i have been ordering the most chocolately desserts at restaurants hoping to get the same effect, but i have not yet. if i were to have a wedding, i would want wayfare tavern to give me a giant chocolate cream pie (i hope you're reading, tyler). if you love chocolate, get this. no matter how full you already are, just get this", "author": "Veronica L."}

For one thing, the service was incredibly lax - it took an exceptionally long time for every step in the dining process to occur.  We didn't even get the popovers until after we had been served with our meal, defeating the purpose of bread being served prior to a meal.  \n\nSo anyway, onto the food - I ordered the hamburger, after reading numerous reviews that it was the best burger anyone had ever eaten.  And let me tell you, it's just not.  The burger has brie, roasted onions and bacon.  Brie is just not an appropriate cheese for a hamburger, in my opinion.  There's just not much flavor there.  Don't get me wrong, I like it on a cracker, but on a burger, I just think a cheese with a stronger taste is better.  The bacon was soft and fatty, and the onions were hardly cooked.  The burger was just lacking in flavor and seasoning all around.  For $19, I expected the burger to at least be seasoned.\n\nI ordered the peach pie with brown butter ice cream, which was good, but it was difficult to overcome the disappointment of the burger.  Keep in mind that the pie is freaking huge, so best to share between two.  \n\nThe only standout for me were the late arriving popovers.

As a family we order one of everything and just share them all so out of all of them I'd have to say the cheesecake was the best.

We didn't have reservations, but right as we walked in a bar table opened up and we snagged it.\n\nIt was the typical 6pm Friday evening crowd: lots of downtown preppies meeting their friends for the start of the weekend.  We did some crowd watching while we started with our drinks:  wine for her, Manhattan for me.  Just OK on the Manhattan.  Nothing to write home about.\n\nWe ordered:  Start with deviled eggs; Salmon dinner for her, fried chicken for me.  Side of Mac/Chz to split.\n\nThe popovers came just before the eggs.  Popovers are excellent here.  Deviled eggs were great too.  No complaints.\n\nFried chicken came and was very good, though a bit on the salty side.  Mac/Chz was outstanding, yet very greasy.  Knew what I was getting into though with the grease.  Not exactly complaining.\n\nGirlfriend's salmon was good, but still raw in the center.  She didn't send back since she smiled and said, \"sashimi!\"  Not good to send out half cooked and half raw.  Where's Gordon Ramsay when I need him?\n\nNo dessert tonight.  Typically they bring sugar cookies with the check, but server didn't bring.  Wasn't impressed with the service at all.\n\nThe food is typically good so I'll go back, but I hope the service is better and they cook the food next time!", "author": "Todd M."}

Delicious.\n\nThe end.\n\n(Okay not really.)\n\nMy boyfriend loves the Food Network, so he was really excited to try Tyler Florence's place. Unfortunately our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. In addition to our entr\u00e9es, we ordered one starter and one side (thinking portions would be small since this was an upscale trendy restaurant -- boy were we wrong!). Plus they gave us their house bread, which was egg-y and puffy and fantastic. So we were already full halfway through the meal! But no way was that going to stop us.\n\nOur appetizer was steak tartare, and it was superb. Enough for 3-4 people to share. For dinner I had a burger with a side of the brussels sprouts (which has ham/bacon bits in it). At that point I was only able to eat about half my food, but it was fantastic. My boyfriend got the fried chicken and said it was so good he would kill himself to eat it all if he had to. We shared a side of the mac & cheese, which I thought was a *teeny* bit too rich, but he really liked it. Unfortunately we had no room for dessert.\n\nIf we ever make it back, we'll be sure to come *very* hungry. And we would definitely come back, because the food was unbelievable, and the atmosphere was fun. It reminded me of the pubs and taverns we went to in Ireland, but with a decidedly American feel.

Unfortunately, the only time available was a 9:15pm day after Valentine's.  We did try to make the meal a bit less late by snagging an empty table at the bar and having our appetizer and first drink there while waiting for a table.\n\nAppetizers:\nAnother surprise hit:  We had the steak tartare again, but this time they served it with GARLIC popovers, which is MUCH MUCH better than the regular French bread they served it with b/c the garlic from the bread makes the tartare's flavor POP!!!  It's REALLY good now!!!  :)\n\nWe also had the poutine, which is pretty good, but it's a bit rich.... and this is without the mozzarella curd too (we asked for it without!)  We love the dish, but our stomaches can't handle that rich a dish.  I also suspect there's still dairy in the gravy of the poutine too for some reason.  Not a good thing if you're allergic to dairy.\n\nEntree:\nOne of the minor disappointments was the ribeye (special of the day)  It was tough in spots!  :(  Most of the steak was tender and hubby does think that it reminded him of good roast beef!!!\n\nI had the duck gumbo, very good eats here too!  The duck breast meat was nice and not fatty at all.  Nicely spiced, but not too spicy for me!  :)\n\nMy one surprise thumbs up was the roasted organic beets with quinoa, avocado mousse and citrus aioli which I had as a side dish.  Not only was it taste and light, but it was almost too pretty to eat.  ALMOST!!!  ;)  \n\nAnyway, if they can get me to eat beets, that's a good sign!!!  :)\n\nDessert:\n\nThe other surprise slight disappointment was the apple crumble.  The ice cream was good but it was just meh.  (I liked their sage ice cream from the last time?  That would have gone better with the apple crumble.)  The apple part of it I really liked, but it still needs *something* to make the flavor pop, but I can't put my finger.  Hubby thinks more cinnamon.  I think it's the sage ice cream!  :)  \n\nPart of me wishes we got the chocolate and hazelnut cake instead, especially since we do LOVE our Schaffenburger chocolate and part b/c we know they can put a pop in the dessert by adding a small amount of salt.  Alas, there is a bit of a wait if we want that dessert and well, it was getting REALLY LATE as is for dinner and we're getting REALLY tired!!!\n\nThey did redeem themselves in the desserts department by having soy milk for their lattes!!!  Most restaurants do NOT serve soy mllk -- not a good thing for those who are allergic to dairy but still wants to enjoy their latte!  :)\n\nI also wished that Tyler is there.  Unfortunately I think he will only make occasionally appearances at the restaurant now that the place is more stable since it first opened and he can leave the place to run on its own.  Sad, since that's one of the reasons I love coming here!\n\nI'll still leave it at about 3.5 to 4 stars for now.", "author": "Joanna R."}

Have to say Wayfare Tavern edged out El Paseo.  \n\nMy friend and I arrived early for our 6:15pm reservation and were seated immediately.  Jennifer, our server, came by and greeted us.  She answered our questions about the cocktails available and made great suggestions.  I wanted the Wayfare Tavern Egg Nog but it was no longer available.  We were at the tail end of the seasonal menu and it was too late in the season.  C'est la vie.  I did a 360 away from the frothy drink and got the Doctor's Orders subsituting Ketel One for the gin.  With the ginger, pamplemousse rose, lime, grapefruit and ginger beer, it was very refreshing.  My friend had The Conservatory, a frothy drink with tequila, elderflower, chartreuse, lemon, hibiscus syrup, egg white and bitters.  Yummy.\n\nWarm popovers appeared on our table very quickly.  For starters, I was going to have the rabbit terrine but it wasn't available.  No worries.  They had a pheasant terrine instead.  My friend had the fresh burrata with mission figs, eggplant caponata, marjoram and grilled sourdough.  Both were very tasty.\n\nA second round of popovers.  Offered, not requested.  Yippee!  Somehow the Wayfare Tavern Gods knew how to make me happy.\n\nFor our main course, I ordered the Guinness braised lamb shank with horseradish whipped potatoes, orange glazed carrots, toasted barley and watercress.  My friend had the white sea bass with buttered potato puree, sea bean salsa verde, caviar and a grilled lemon.  We could not find fault with either plates.  Delicious.\n\nJennifer came by and offered a Lost Coast Brewery Downtown Brown Ale.  The bartender had pulled an extra one and she dropped it off on the house!  Great service.\n\nAs always, I had to have dessert.  To quote from a Sarah Michelle Gellar movie, \"I love dessert. It's the whole point of the meal.\"  My friend and I shared the huckleberry and Meyer lemon cream puffs.  There were 3 on the plate and my friend, being the gentleman that he is, told me to have two of them while he settled for one.  I'm not as generous.  I told him we could split the 3rd one.  Well, after the 1st bite, he saw the wisdom of my words and split the 3rd one!  With french press coffee, the meal ended perfectly!\n\nAnd to top it all off, I had asked our busboy if he could sneak a popover in with my leftovers.  He came by with my claim ticket and told me he got me two!  WooHoo!  This was actually my third visit to Wayfare Tavern and I've always had a great meal and time there.", "author": "J. P."}

This was one of the most disappointing meals I've had in a long time, especially at the price.\n\nFor $27, I got a piece of salmon big enough for just two pieces of sushi.  I know wild salmon is expensive, but this was ridiculous.  It was on top of an insipid \"curry,\" some sort of watery cream that did nothing for the salmon.  It said \"almonds,\" I think there were two pieces.\n\nWorse, my friend got a pork chop that wasn't even warm inside.  I don't mind eating steak or tuna like this, but not pork.  And there were a lot of apricots with it that were bitter.  If you are going to serve fruit with pork, find something sweet, or make it sweet, but don't put second-rate bitter fruit on the plate.  It was on top of apathetic mash.  The pork chop was better after it went back to the kitchen, but I was almost finished with my meal by the time my friend got his.\n\nThe wine was overpriced.\n\nI guess it's no surprise Tyler couldn't keep his other restaurant going.

But can a restaurant be judged solely by the quality of its raw dishes?\n\nThus far I'd say that the appetizers are the shinning stars of the menu. The deviled eggs are subtle and wonderfully chilled. According to my significant other who's been there before the oysters are wonderful and the sardines which are on vacation from the menu were screaming good. \n\nWe split a caesar salad, to die for. Creamy dressing, lovely hearts, shaved cheese and garlicy bread crumbs and the not the giant kind but rather crumbled, small, almost a dusting. Loved that about it. \n\nOnward and upward. After countless yorkshire puddings, their bread, we finally ordered a the tri-tip. I can't say I was impressed. First of all I don't think the tri-tip is my favorite cut of the cow, the sauce although nice lacked any real character. The carmelized onion was delicious but wasn't exactly the perfect accompaniment a few slices of beef. For some reason I thought it was a bit on the tough side even though it arrived properly pink inside. Probably just the cut. Tri-tip lacks the marbling of other pieces of the cow so beware. The burger looked amazing and I'm still game to try the pork belly and duck, but a little gun shy now after the lack luster entree.\n\nThe bar, here's where I'm not sure what to think. I liked the cocktails I had, A mayor which was a bourbon driven delight and a negroni which also was quite good. The other cocktails which was a tequila sort of fizz with egg white, not my favorite. I'm a little shocked that the folks behind the bar aren't measuring using jiggers, I'd think that with a mixological bend to the menu one would absolutely ensure the proportionality of spirit to mixer etc. The final result was good, meaning I liked my drinks, but they were ever so slightly heavy on the booz. \n\nWill I be back? Yes. Do I hope things develop, absolutely, it's a good place, just seems like a few kinks to work out, that's all, and the guy behind the bar, can't remember his name, gave me hope that he'll set the bar high.", "author": "Len S."}

I had made reservations about a month in advance so we were seated right away. Upon checking in, I told the hostess that it was my mom's birthday and if it was possible to have Happy Birthday written on her dessert's plate and she told me she would leave a note with our server.\n\nWe were given a choice or either the bar or a table right next to the kitchen and my mom chose the table. The interior of the restaurant is dimly lit but had a nice cozy cabin feel to it, well a really nice polished cabin. The restrooms are downstairs and there are pictures all along the walls which were fun to look at.\n\nFor appetizer we ordered the Devil on Horseback which were delicious. I love sweets and the California dates were definitely sweet. My mom is not a big fan of sweets so the capers were a nice touch to balance out the sweetness. My mom ordered the organic fried chicken which was absolutely delicious. I ordered the braised short rib and omg, it was heavenly. The best short ribs I've had so far. It had really nice flavor, very tender, and the truffles...yum! We also shared a side of the baked mac and cheese which was pretty good as well.\n\nMy mom chose the caramel walnut tart with buttermilk ice cream for dessert and when it came out it had Happy Birthday elegantly written at the bottom of the plate and a single candle on the side. I'm glad that our server didn't sing Happy Birthday because I'm sure my mom would've been embarrassed. The caramel walnut tart was warm and comforting. The buttermilk ice cream I didn't care for too much by itself by when eaten with the caramel walnut tart it was pleasantly better.\n\nMy only complaint is that service was kind of slow. My mom and I had been sitting for quite some time in between our appetizers, entres, and dessert. Our whole dinner lasted just over 2 hours which is kind of long for a party of two. Wayfare Tavern seems like a nice hang out spot for after work drinks as the atmosphere is very lively and the drinks here are strong. I suggest making a reservation to avoid a long wait.", "author": "Tracy Y."}

The moment we were close to the restaurant, we were put off by the amount of broken glass in front and around the restaurant. When we walked in, the restaurant was empty except for staff, we had a 11:30am reservation, & was greeted by a very snotty hostess! After haggling to be seated because one person in our party had not yet arrived, she reluctantly seated us since the whole restaurant had no other patrons. We sat at our cramped table for quite awhile before our server asked us what we'll like to drink & that they were OUT of the soup & pasta!!! How can a restaurant be out of dishes that's on their main menu & the restaurant had just opened for business?!?!?!  When we were ready to order, our server said something's wrong in the kitchen & wouldn't be able to take our orders yet. This continued for awhile & the server kept saying something was wrong with the gas pipe & don't know what's happening. He finally served us bread after we asked; but we finally asked for our check after we made reservation at another restaurant.\nTyler, you have just lost four customers due to the terrible service we received! We arrive with great expectations & left 100% disappointed, & that's without even tasting your food!  No one offered any incentive of any kind for us to return at another time, so you have lost four customers & others!", "author": "Nancy L."}

Make sure you make reservations well in advance.  I made these reservations 2 months ago and while I was able to get a reservation - the available times were very limited.\n\nWe used the valet to park - $10.  We arrived a few minutes before our 5:45 p.m. reservation and were immediately seated upstairs.  I didn't care for how packed in and close the seating was.  Also there were a couple of young children who were screaming and crying and whose parents allowed them to run around the restaurant unattended. \n\nI was looking forward to trying the popovers and was unfortunately disappointed when they arrived at the table burned and hard as a rock.  We did tell the waitress (who was GREAT by the way) and she brought us less well done popovers - they was good but still a tad bit overcooked.\n\nWe had the bone marrow appetizer.  Now that was delicious!  It comes with three small slices of toasted sourdough, but ask for an extra order of sourdough when you order this appetizer - you will need more than the three slices for sure.\n\nThe waitress recommended and I ordered the Pork Chop.

The Yelp reviews had been mostly raves, so I eagerly anticipated this meal.  I decided to do three appetizers in order to see what the kitchen could do. \n\nAfter a very good (and free!) popover....\n\nFirst up, the grilled calamari.  Perfectly cooked, tender, packing a little heat and with wonderful herby and crispy breadcrumbs, this was an extraordinary iteration of calamari.  Really - it was that good.\n\nSecond - the organic Marin heirloom tomatoes with aioli, black-eyed peas, goat's feta, smoked olive oil, shaved onion and herbs.  Another winner.  The tomatoes were so sweet and summery, and the accompaniments a nice counterpoint to that sweetness.  I particularly liked the consistency of the black-eyed pleas against the soft, silky tomatoes. Yum.\n\nLast, I had the sardines roasted with garlic parsley butter and lemon, which my wonderful and perky server recommended highly.  She was so right.  The fish were cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and moist and tender inside.  The flesh separated from the bones pretty easily, although you will still get a few fine, edible bones in each forkful.  A fine rendition!\n\nI opted to forgo dessert, but my neighboring diners seemed quite taken with their pineapple upside down cake.  I received a terrific ginger snap cookie fresh from the oven with my bill.  \n\nI will definitely be back and will happily recommend this place to my friends.

First off, it's easy to park around here on the weekends, but they do have valet.  The inside feels like... a tavern - deer head on the wall, small classic bar, etc.  Each story is pretty small, so it never gets too noisy, and it feels pretty intimate. \n\nTo start, drinks: \n- Tavern sour: Eagle rare single barrel, yellow chartreuse, and egg white.  I got it without the herb syrup. and it was nice and tart\n- Pear 75: pear cognac, pepper syrup (very subtle). topped with prosecco\n\nOnto food.. we usually order a lot, but I haven't felt this stuffed in a long time.\n- Fried oysters: I liked the batter a lot. It was marinated in tabasco, and I actually really liked the fried cauliflower (more than the oystrers)\n- Mac n cheese: cheesy, topped with breadcrumbs, well seasoned; it would have been better with some bacon ;)\n- Steak tartare: garlic popovers, fresh beef, egg yolk - standard\n- Poutine with oxtail: loved the oxtail, good gravy, melted cheese.  I love poutine and wish more places would have this on the menu\n- Shrimp cocktail: pretty standard\n- Seared octopus: seared nicely, good spice from linguica, with a charred scallion hollandaise\n- Burger: BEST dish of the night.  Melted brie and the fried egg were amazing.  The pickles were good, fries were well seasoned.  One of the best burgers I've had in SF\n- Fried chicken: it lived up to the hype for me, but you have to like herbs, lemon, and salt.  Even the breast was super moist, and all the flavor got into it. It had just the right amount of batter.  This probably came in 2nd to the burger\n- Scallops: seared, biscuits weren't great, not amazing but not bad\n- Short rib: fork tender, served with carrots and red cabbage, good flavor but also not super unique\n\nDesserts:\n- Donuts: AMAZING.  With dulce de leche, salted caramel, and grape jam for dipping.  Served freshly fried, warm, glazed.\n- Chocolate custard: with TCHO chocolate, very rich. Toffee ice cream and ground up chocolate crumbles were good, but this was a really rich dish\n\nThe food was definitely filling.  It's a comfort food type of place, and it's much more low key than I expected.  In the end it was $100/person including tax/tip (we each had 2-3 drinks). Our server was awesome - he had a great sense of humor and knew the menu well.  \n\nI would definitely go back again for the burger, poutine, and fried chicken.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

Do try the fried chicken and if you are feeling like you don't want to indulge it all on your own- split it with a friend. I did and I actually would recommend that you do. When you order the friend chicken, you just get chicken. Although it's a whole chicken (~5 large pieces) and enough for 2 people in my opinion. The chicken is really really flavorful and so surprisingly moist inside! (I had the breast and it was juicy- how do they do it ???) The herbs are definetly fragrant and you can really taste it in the breading and chicken itself. (again- how do they get the herb flavor in the chicken???) I also really like the breading- it's not a thick skin of fried dough- rather it is a little thinner and with all the great flavors!!! The breading reminds me of homemade breading- lightly dusted but still delivering that satisfying crunch. \n\nI am also a brussel sprouts fan and had to order it! It was roasted so well and very flavorful. A tad bit salty for me- but it pairs well with the chicken. \n\nOfcourse- the popovers are fab. If it I was here for brunch, I would probably just order coffee and eat popovers after popovers. I am not sure if that  is allowed... \n\nThe devil eggs are good but nothing amazing as what others rave. True, the actual yolk is very creamy- but to split this dish among 2 people is very filling. \n\nRecommendation: Order the friend chicken and brussel sprouts (or any other sides/ appetizer) and enjoy family style. The portions are big and even if you have left overs- they provide such a cute box for leftovers.", "author": "Anna C."}

The waiter, while friendly, seemed a bit out of a it while he was taking our order. After that initial interaction it was fine, but we did mention to each other that we had a feeling that something wasn't gonna be up with our order. \n\nWe ended up ordering two entrees and then two dishes to share: \n- Wayfare Caesar Salad: They offered to split it for us so it ended up being the perfect amount for both of us. I was craving a salad all day so this hit the spot. \n- Baked Macaroni & Cheese: A pretty hefty portion, but a little disappointing since it was a lot more bland than I expected. \n- Organic Fried Chicken: This was the dish I ordered since I read so many people raving about it on here. I notice that the pieces like the leg were definitely salty like some reviewers mentioned, but the rest of the pieces were a little bland. I did enjoy it nonetheless. They really do give a good portion. I ended up taking the rest for lunch the next day. \n- Wafare Burger \"Le Grand\": Boyfriend ended up ordering this of course. He added the egg as well. While you can't really go wrong with a burger he said he wasn't that fond of the meat. Again a really big portion, and it comes with a side of fries. \n\nThe macaroni didn't end up coming out so we asked the waiter if it was just taking a long time, and apparently he had forgotten to put it in. We weren't surprised, but since were so full we were going to let him know it would be okay to just forgo the order. He let us know though that he would comp it and give it to us to-go. That was a really nice gesture, and worked out for us since we both ended up having the leftover chicken and split the macaroni for lunch the next day. \n\nSo overall we had a really nice experience here. Would we come again? Probably not. None of the dishes themselves really blew us away and there wasn't anything else we saw on the dinner menu that interested us either.", "author": "Jenny C."}

Last night was a disappointment.\n\nThe service was generally poor.  We arrived as they opened on a Sunday night.  If you're open, you're open.  You're not a somewhat-surly upstairs bartender.  And why were we not able to transfer our drink tab to our table?  You just plopped the receipt down in front of us and told us to pay up.\n\nI had such a good experience earlier this year that I had high expectations.  Three diners each had mistakes on their entrees - one 'no blue cheese' got blue cheese, one 'no fried egg' got a fried egg on a burger, and one 'no corn' got the corn anyway.  We brought this up to our server, Sarah, who basically shrugged her shoulders.\n\nOne thing that I vividly recall from February was how the food was served on hot plates...one of my pet observations for a good restaurant.  You serve hot food on a hot plate and it's still hot when it's delivered.  It appears they've given up on this practice.  My ribs were lukewarm on arrival.\n\nIn their defense they did a very nice job presenting a fresh fruit platter as dessert for our birthday guest.  And the people at the front desk couldn't have been more accommodating.", "author": "Cameron R."}

If you don't have a reservation, this is a good time to come. \n\nMy husband and I shared the following:\nLobster Corn Chowder: the sweetness of the corn and the savory of the lobster really went well together. since we were sharing, they actually brought the soup out in two separate plates. it feels like getting two soups, which is always great.\n\nButter Lettuce and Grapefruit Salad: this was ok, a standard salad in San Francisco, I guess. It didn't blow me away, but it was pretty refreshing.\n\nPotrale Sole: this was an interesting dish. it came with a clam chowder like soup base. the clams and fish were cooked just right and the crispy Brussels sprouts added the right texture to the entire dish. I would say this was a success.\n\nA side of grill eggplant with chili: good, but I can't help to associate it with the eggplant dish in a Chinese restaurant. lol!\n\na side of green/yellow beans: tender and cooked just right. very fresh! \n\nthe popover on the side was good, too. I like how they give you whipped butter, it was soft and easy to spread on the popover.\n\nOn our way out, we ran into Tyler Florence carrying some green (looks like the stuff in my coup) that's still growing in the planter's box. My cousin recognized that it was him. I was totally oblivious. The waiter was pretty cool. We had a good conversation with him about wine and he brought some out for us to try.

Avoid this salad!\n\nService was disappointing also. My friend asked for another popover given that we weren't going to be satisfied with the salad.

Last night, our service was attentive but inconsistent (sometimes 3 guys on us asking what we needed, sometimes no one to be found, never clear who was in charge of our table). We ordered an app that never arrived, and when we reminded one of our seemingly interchangeable waiters, the deviled eggs (seriously, they're good) came at the same time as the entree. The chef came to our table and offered to hold and re-fire our entrees when we were ready. Maybe should have said yes. So we kept the fish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-03-13", "description": "The Wayfare Tavern was very \"wavering\" in consistency, as a summarizing sort of statement. After waiting a year to eat here (they were fully booked last time I rolled into town--they had just opened), I was super pumped to get a reservation for 6 of us. With all the fame, it better have blown me away, no?\n\nI really like the vibe, though it is a touch too dark and closed-in. Very prohibition style eating. The fare itself is a good sort of take on comfort fare, though many of the offerings did not really blend together for a meal overall, in my opinion. Nonetheless, I found the experience to be pretty awesome and inviting as a whole.\n\nNow, my main beef was the famed fried chicken. Their flagship dish sort of dragged down my overall impression. If it is going to gain you accolades, it better really impress a Texas boy who travels across the South eating oil cooked battered pieces o' poultry. Here, it had sort of a not super crispy exterior, it possessed a sort of chewy texture, and the seasoning was not spectacular. The gussied up presentation did not help too much. At least the portion provided 5 pieces.\n\nMoving on; most creamy mac and cheese, hands down. I honestly have no idea how they added so much cheesiness while allowing the noodles to be pulled apart. What kind of noodles do they use here? So much mystery, so much goodness and cheesiness to be tasted!\n\nThe fries were a good version of upgraded McDonald's, which is saying a lot. Too bad the $8 price tag turned the rather good fried tuber strips sour. The parsley and Parmesan failed to come out, and the fries were not piping hot. And I love piping hot fries.\n\nThe unlimited popovers were certainly a nice touch to the dinner, but I mean... man cannot live by bread alone, right? Not a bad alcohol menu; my Anderson Valley oatmeal stout went well with everything.\n\nWT is a restaurant that stakes its claim, if not for its fried chicken at least for its association with good ol' Mr. Florence himself. I found my time with my friends here to be very much enjoyable, just with a touch of pretension looming over our time.", "author": "Solomon W."}

I never knew I would want to pay for poultry liver ever again. The Foie Gras was delicious. Paired off with the plums? nectarines? that they came with, the combination of sweet and salty was out of this world. (PS, I normally dislike swt salty combinations). Luckily I was saving room for the rest of my meal otherwise my date would have had to suffer through me forking his hand for the Foie Gras. I didn't think too highly of the Bone Marrow. I did not think that paying ($14) for the parts that puppies eat was entirely how I wanted to do this + it was a little on the saltier side + there was two tiny teaspoonfuls at the most... Skip the Bone Marrow and just save room for dessert.\n\nYes, we HAD to get the fried chicken because all you Yelpers were on that! Sadly, I can not agree. The fried chicken was good, but not $22 good. It was lightly crisp and had a nice light taste, the chicken was borderline dry but definitely taken out of the fryer just in the nick of time. Tara P. who has been here highly suggested the steak over the chicken, girlfriend that is why we are going here together next time!\n\nThe Mac and Cheese is as good as everyone says it is, oozing with delicious dairy deliciousness (see it was that appetizing) and nicely constructed with a non-overbearing cooked top.\n\nDessert, there was this delicious peach? apricot? pie contraption laced with sugared rosemary. The crust was nice and flakey but not too flakey so you didn't have to chase the crust around the plate, the peaches were a delicate sweet that was nicely complimented by the ice cream... Mm... The Chocolate Story is a whole other story. While I thought the dessert was good, it was too rich did not have enough mousse to counter the ganache. I was not a fan of the Chocolate Story, I would've rather had my own pie contraption.\n\nOh and yes, try not to stroll into here without reservations at dinner time. We called in the afternoon to grab a 9:45 reservation on a random weekday night. That is nuts... But well worth the late night eating!", "author": "Win\u00e8 C."}

The noodles were super creamy.  My dining partner enjoyed that but I would have preferred a gooey, stringy factor too.\n\nOrganic Fried Chicken: A whole lot of fried chicken!  The buttermilk brining makes the meat under the fried breading feel juicier than the Colonel's.  Loved all the fried herbs to add an extra zing.  So much chicken I barely noticed the sides were pretty much missing.\n\nWayfare Burger \"Le Grand\": Probably not their signature dish.  Decent patty and runny cheese.

App was okay; we had the deviled eggs and some were overly salty, but still edible. Entrees consisted of the fried chicken, which apparently is their specialty and steak frites.

I highly recommend the deviled eggs, burger (with egg), ribs (if they have them) and ordering at least one side.  The menu changes periodically, but everything I have had from meat to seafood to veggies has been cooked and seasoned to perfection.  The desserts are innovative, yet comforting and delicious so definitely try to save room.  \n\nThe service at Wayfare is top notch.  The servers are all personable, welcoming and knowledgeable.  They won't give you a dirty look if you ask for two popovers (which you absolutely should because they are delightful).  On my most recent visit, the server brought us these warm, wonderfully chewy ginger snap cookies with our bill since we were too stuffed for dessert.  Be prepared for a leisurely meal though because the service is not the speediest.  I definitely see this as a plus though because it gives me time to savor my food and digest to the best of my abilities.\n\nAlso be prepared for a heavy meal, though perhaps that is avoidable.  I just always stuff myself silly when I go because I want to try everything.  I once went with 3 people and got 2 appetizers, 3 sides and 4 entrees (we shared the fried chicken entree).  \n\nThe one thing that I really dislike about Wayfare Tavern is the long staircase that I have to navigate after the meal.

The hostess was very pleasant and led us upstairs to our table. Our server Jason was a bit on the serious and non-enthusiastic side when he took our order. We selected the grilled calamari ($15) for appetizer and I ordered their Organic Fried Chicken ($24) and my friend ordered the Wayfare Burger ($19) plus we shared a side order of broccolini ($8).  \n\nThe bus staff brought us still water from a carafe and offered us the popovers, which were tasty. When I commented that I really liked them, the bus boy asked if I wanted another one. I declined since I didn't want to fill up before my much-anticipated fried chicken.  It took a few minutes before we received the calamari. The presentation was beautiful with the calamari nicely grilled. However, since the calamari was left whole, I cut it with a knife and discovered that it still had the cartilage inside.  I figured they must have missed cleaning that piece but when I cut into my second piece, I found another cartilage in it.  I'm guessing most people know that the cartilage is NOT edible and this should be a Prep Cook 101 felony to fail to remove it before cooking the calamari.  I certainly expected a renown chef such as Tyler Florence to train his kitchen staff (i.e. prep cooks) better. Other than that, the calamari was tasty and cooked properly.\n\nAfter our appetizer, it took a very long time for our main entrees to arrive. We saw  other tables of diners who had arrive way after us getting their food and one table even ate and left while we were still waiting for our main entrees. After almost half an hour, I flagged down another server and asked about our entrees. Even he made mention that we should have gotten our entrees by now since he also noticed that everyone around us were eating their meals.  Our original server was in a side room taking orders from a large party but I thought that another server should have checked on our order. The second server whom we asked brought out our order and told us that he had \"just\" seen it ready in the kitchen.  \n\nWhen we tasted our fried chicken and burger, it was very obvious that they had been sitting for awhile in the kitchen. The burger was not hot and some of the french fries were hard while other pieces were limp but they were barely warm. Although the fried chicken was delicious, it would have been better if it was brought out sooner.  And for these prices ($24 for the fried chicken and $19 for the burger), I expected much better.  The grilled broccolini was just okay, nothing to write home about.\n\nI hated to give Wayfare Tavern only 3 stars but I had to consider the entire dining experience, both food and service.  The bus boys were very attentive, refilling our water glasses, etc, but the server should have brought out our food when it was hot.  Long wait and lukewarm food = bad service.  By the way, the dining room wasn't even full when we placed our order so I can't really think of a good excuse for them. Sorry Tyler.....but there is definitely room for improvement.", "author": "Zoey W."}

I've always enjoyed Tyler Florence's show on the Food Network and his restaurant definitely showcases his style.  Luckily for us the restaurant was only located a block away from our hotel and the walk over was pleasant despite the cold temperatures.  Our appointment was for 8:30 at night and the place was still packed with people.  We had arrived early and ordered a few of the signature cocktails.  One \"Doctor's Orders\" and a \"Stage Coach.\" \n\nI didn't personally try the Doctor's Orders but was told it was refreshing and just a little sweet.  The ginger was present, but not over powering.  The  Stage Coach I really enjoyed, it was basically a jazzed up version of an Old Fashioned, which is one of my favorites.  It took them about 15 minutes after our reservation to be sat.  We were taken upstairs where the dining room was.  It's a very small space with maybe 20 tables.  There is also a small bar thats far less crowded than the one downstairs.\n\nTyler Florence is known for his popovers and I see why.  They were warm fluffy and oh so delicious.  Our appetizer course included the Salt Roasted Bone Marrow, Raw Oysters and the Tomales Mussels.  All were delicious, the bone marrow savory, rich and full of flavor.  We could not get enough to smear all over the crispy toast points it came with.  The west coast raw oysters were fresh, very sweet and a tad briney, which is what I prefer.  The mussels are served in a cream sauce that is flavored with pork belly, celery and lemon.  At first looking at the dish I was afraid the sauce was way too heavy and probably would overpower the sweetness of the mussel.  I was mistaken.  The sauce is rich, but there's enough acid to tone down the heaviness of the cream, just fantastic.  Pork belly and celery provided the savoriness of dish.  \n\nOur main course included orders of the Bone-In Pork Chop, the Organic Fried Chicken and the White Sea Bass.  I was able to sample the pork chop and the seabass.  Pork chop was cooked perfectly medium and was extremely juicy.  I just loved the braised cabbage and spiced apple pulp it was served with.  The sea bass was on the other hand average for me.  My fiance, it was her dish, agreed also.  Unfortunately I didn't have a chance to sample the fried chicken, however my friend thought it was cooked perfectly, crispy and juicy.\n\nFor our dessert, I know, how did we have room?  We're gluttons really.  The Warm Toffee Cake with the toffee sauce was rich, and buttery.  The Profiteroles were surprisingly light and with the raspberry sauce, a nice contrast to the decadence of the cake.\n\nWe brought our own wine, as we were in Napa the previous afternoon, so corkage was $25.  The meal was a wonderful experience, truly what I thought Tyler Florence's food would be like, rich and flavorful.  Surpassed my expectations.  Will I return?  Oh, yes!", "author": "Eddie T."}

Just a heads up, it's in the Financial District so the crowd can be kind of douchy when the business men get a few drinks in them. Maybe make a reservation past 5pm?\n\nThis is honestly the best fried chicken in San Francisco. Hands down. So delicious. The broccolini wasn't as good as Beretta's but I was in heaven during my whole meal so that was the least of my worries.

Next, I'll add \"Mac & Cheese, Mac & Cheese, Mac & Cheese\"!!!!  \n\nSeriously, this place is comfort food heaven!!!  Tyler Florence has managed to put together a very comfortable yet trendy restaurant, with nice staff and great service.  The food, however, is the real treat.  \nOK, so here's my run-down of the yums...\n\n-Appetizers: crab cakes, deviled eggs and tartare: Fantastic!!!\n\n- Rabbit Terrine: delicious if not just a touch on the dry side.\n\n- Frog Hollow Peaches with watermelon radish, olives, feta: A gorgeous plate to look at, super fresh and  tasted absolutely divine.\n\n- Organic butter lettuce salad with green goddess dressing: not overdressed, and the dressing was superb!\n\n-Prosciutto with melon, pickled onions, fava beans: OK, I gotta be honest. Prosciutto is kinda like bacon.  Put prosciutto with anything and you have a winner.  This dish was as good looking as it was good tasting.\n\n-Organic Fried chicken: I immediately came home and tried to find the recipe in my Tyler Florence cookbooks and on google - although there are lots of chicken recipes I don't think I've found this exact one.  If anyone finds the recipe, it's golden!!!  I'm not a fried chicken person, but in my most ladylike way I found myself picking up the bones and just sucking all the meat off of them (yeah, real glamorous).  \n\n-Seared scallops: this was a no for me, but I have never liked scallops, so it had no chance with me to begin with.  My husband who loves scallops said they were fantastic and perfectly cooked, so you'll have to take his word for it.\n\n-Mac & Cheese: The only thing this was missing was a giant To-Go bucket.  If I could I would have bought 10 pounds of this stuff to take home.  Flavored with smoked olive oil and dusted with breadcrumbs, this is heaven on a plate.  Bust the kitchen door down and go directly to Mac & Cheese!!\n\nAnd people, people...before you go thinking I'm a total piggy and ordered all these dishes myself, it was an event served family style...I had lots of help lapping up all the phenomenal food.

They really outdo themselves here in terms of the upscale feel. \n\nMe and my group of friends tried an assortment of starters following with 4 out of 5 of us option for the famous fried chicken:\n- Popovers: Just not sure if I just got unlucky in terms of when I got to try them (maybe they were not too fresh) but this substitution for bread just fell a bit short of my expectations, they tasted a bit stale and hard to eat\n- Poutine (Oxtail): Really yummy flavorful oxtail served with french fries, the meaty juices and gravy make this dish great\n- American Kobe Tartare: This was OK, I feel that the dressing served with the tartare along with their flavorings overpower the meat, I like my tartare to taste at least a little meaty... and again it was served with less than fresh popovers (or so I felt)\n- French Fried Oysters: Served with a lot of cauliflower, these oysters were okay, very fried to a point where I didn't really know if I ate an oyster or not though\n- Baked Mac & Cheese: Pretty good stuff, very smoky flavor that was filling along with my fried chicken\n- Organic Fried Chicken: This chicken really fell flat of my expectations, probably because I was expecting so much. It was kind of dry and the breading was not crispy enough and a bit too oily. I didn't end up finishing the chicken and wish that I had filled up on the Mac & Cheese instead... maybe I just went on a bad day, since I've heard in the past that this is the place for chicken.\n\nAs mentioned, I was very happy with the service, bartender, greeters and waiters were all excellent which merits an extra star, the food however was definitely more of a 2 considering price.", "author": "Tracy Joy K."}

It was fun to walk off the spitty, gummy streets of downtown SF and into a wooden, cozy space. \n\nWe started with drinks at the bar. It gave us plenty of time to check the place out and pick up the vibe. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, the food seemed to lack health but not class. (Think fried chicken on a fancy plate with enough forks for twice the table settings). Once all in our party had arrived we headed up to our table (two story restaurant). \n\nOur server arrived quite promptly but certainly lacked effectiveness. He stopped by our table at least five times before actually taking orders. There was some serious carbonated versus still water confusion. Anyway, I think everyone at the table learned what 1 part carbonated, 1 part distilled water tastes like (it's really not so bad). Eventually orders were taken and we were left to enjoy each others' company. About 30 minutes into the wait we realized that the popovers that Wayfare Tavern is known for were not being served to us. At our request we were able to join the rest of the customers in enjoying some fluffed bliss. Unfortunately we didn't get them until just before our starters came, but better late than never! \n\nAs with many fancy restaurants the food wasn't so much issue. I ordered the cauliflower and oyster soup to start and the Sea Bass for my main dish. Both were pretty good. I mean, be sure to enter the place knowing it's not a wheat grass getaway and you'll have no trouble at all enjoying the rich dishes. Opting to stay for dessert we ordered the cream cheese drizzled pears and some sort of caramel chocolate cake dish. Both were presented well and came out comparatively timely. \n\nOverall the place wasn't bad.

We decided to save it for my bf's bday this year, and made a reservation to eat beside the kitchen and watch the chefs cook.  \n\nThe feel of the restaurant is very nice, but the food was just not up to par.  My bf's sister ordered the white seabass which was super undercooked, it tasted like sashimi inside.  When she asked about it, the server stated that it's the way the chef prefers it made, but it might as well be a sashimi seabass! My bf ordered the organic fried chicken, which was good and nicely seasoned with fresh-tasting ingredients, but it was dry and not as tender as I had expected it to be.  I, myself, ordered the tri-tip steak and frites, which were good.  The steak was cooked perfectly and marinated in a nice sauce, and the fries were delicious.  I was satisfied with my food, but the other dishes were definitely below average.  \n\nOur appetizers included the salted bone marrow, which my bf enjoyed, but I thought it was just too oily and fatty-tasting.  We also got the steak tartare, which was probably one of the better items that we got.  \n\nOverall, it was a decent experience, but this place is definitely way too overrated and overpriced for the mediocrity of the food.\n\nOh, and btw, even though we got seated next to the kitchen so we could watch the cooks, we got placed at the farthest end where our table was a lower level, and there was a counter in front of us blocking our view, so we could hardly see much but the workers' heads.  Yes, I must admit, it's partially my fault for being short and Asian, but even my bf and his sister who are close to 6' tall were unable to  get much of a view.

The halibut was tender and juicy but the flash boiled beans were crunchy. The pasta dish was the best, buttery and lightly creamy sauce . The Mac and cheese had a bread crust over the top which I didn't like, I've had much better Mac many other places. The mashed potatoes were very good , creamy and salted perfectly.

The garlic bread crumbs topped the texture of the dish with an added crisp \n\nOrganic fried chicken: the breading is flaky, flavorful, and full of herbs. The chicken fell off the bone; it was so tender and juicy. The dish comes with at least 4 big pieces of chicken so it's very filling and shareable. This lives up to its hype!\n\nSteak frites: I substituted the fries with asparagus. The tri tip was cooked to a perfect medium rare, pink center. There were about 5 pieces. They also placed a lot of tasty, soft asparagus. This dish is also shareable in my opinion.  \n\nChocolate cream pie: THIS IS WHAT I'VE BEEN WANTING TO RAVE ABOUT. Surprisingly for a big slice of creamy, sweet-looking pie, it was not so sweet which is perfect for any adult taste. The whipped cream was pure and unsweetened and it balanced the sweetness of the chocolate pudding. The pudding was made out of Sharffenberger chocolate and tasted SO scrumptious, I can't describe how amazing it melted in my mouth. Sharffenberger really is the best chocolate I have tasted and it's awesome how Chef Florence incorporated it into his most famous dessert. \n\nI love this restaurant and I can't wait to come back again to try the steak tartare and the rest of the entrees.

This burger can feed a whole village the Fukin province of China. The burger was so good and large my wife didn't even finish her fries that came with it. I had the steak frites and what makes the santa maria tri tip stand out was the truffle butter they infuse the meat with.

The scene is bustling with suits - businessmen from the Financial District. It's quite easy to feel underdressed here. If the theme is to impress clients and the like, the food doesn't come off as pretentious. \n\nMost of the items on the menu fall into the category of classic American comfort food. We were served popovers, instead of bread while we waited for our food. These hollow rolls were very light and delicious. I liked that it didn't fill us up before the entrees arrived. We started off with deviled Petaluma eggs. The fried crispy shallots on top made all the difference. For entrees, I eyed the Wayfare burger for the longest time, but I just couldn't justify paying $20 for just a burger. I ended up ordering the lamb shank, which came out perfectly braised and was fall-off-the-bone tender. I was quite impressed by the accompanying horseradish whipped mashed potatoes, orange glazed carrots, and the small, delightfully crunchy Brussels sprout leaves. They reminded me of miniature kale chips. Other entrees at the table included the organic fried chicken and the white sea bass. The fried chicken was battered well, but some pieces were dry. I can't imagine having to eat an entire fried chicken meal here, but it's a great dish to share. The sea bass was a great, lighter alternative to the chicken or lamb shank. Lastly, the baked macaroni and cheese was a nice side dish to share, but it was a little one dimensional in cheese flavor and heavy. \n\nAll of the food was cooked very well, but everything we had on the menu (except the sea bass) was heavy. After this meal, I wanted to eat a salad or any fresh vegetables that weren't drenched in sauce. Still, you're going to get substance for what you pay here.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

It's a bit pricey for lunch. \n\nThe meal started out with these awesome popover things. They were light and flakey and I had 2 of them. The Mac and Cheese was excellent, if a bit rich. The cheese was quite refined (I'm sure it was made using some obscure cheese and not anything akin to cheddar).  I ordered the Steak Frites (basically steak with pomme frites). It was very tasty and the steak was cooked perfectly. I thought the fries were pretty good, but definitely not the best I've ever had. I had a taste of the Chicken Waldorf Sandwich and it was very good. I liked the way the savory chicken was blended with the apples and celery mixture. I also tasted the Fried Chicken. The Fried Chicken was good and the chicken was seasoned well. I will say that Hard Knox is better. But this Fried Chicken was totally yummy. \n\nIf you're pinching pennies don't come here. All of the lunch meals are $18 and over. I seriously think they took the dinner menu, labeled it \"lunch\", and then took off $2 for each item. The food is actually a bit heavy and rich. This is also not a place to come if you want a light meal. If you go here for lunch and are heading back to the office be forewarned that you will not be productive the rest of the day. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food and service at Wayfare Tavern.

I've been waiting so long for this spot to open and I'm so happy it didn't disappoint!  Tyler Florence's new restaurant downtown is fantastic.  We went the very first week it opened.  While we were expecting there to be some opening week hiccups, the dinner surprisingly ran very smooth.  The food was excellent and the service was spot on.\n\nDon't miss out on the complimentary piping hot popovers being passed around.  This man walks around with a basket of these hot croissant-like buttery popovers.  When you open them up, your face is instantly stuffed with yummy fresh baked smelling steam.\n\nWe ended up going on a Thursday night which offered up a smoked Sonoma pork rib blue plate special.  We decided to start with a baked avocado and the Monterey bay calamari.  The avocado was stuffed with crispy smoked bacon and Dungeness crab, which they weren't skimpy on.  The crab and avocado just seemed to melt in my mouth.  The calamari was delicately grilled and served drizzled with olive oil and lemon. Both were great starters.\n\nFor our mains, the date went with the Sonoma pork ribs which came out on a massive plate accompanied by roasted corn, bbq'd beans, potato salad and coleslaw.  While $24 may seem like a lot to pay for ribs, this dish was so massive, it'd be very difficult to finish everything.  It's worth every bit of the price.\n\nI decided to go with the Wayfare burger \"Le Grand,\" which apparently Tyler Florence refuses to give anybody in the kitchen the recipe for.  It's his secret (although it's rumored that he grounds up filet mignon, brisket, and prime rib!) The burger came topped with delicious Cowgirl Creamery cheese and crispy bacon.  I ordered it medium and it was done perfectly.  The meat was tender and juicy, and the flavor just exploded in my mouth.  I'd put this burger up there with Fish and Farm's.\n\nFinally we were so full after our meal, however the desert menu looked so delicious so we had to get something.  Taking the waitress up on her recommendation, we went with Pineapple upside-down cake with macadamia nut brittle.  If you have a sweet tooth, this is definitely the desert to get.  Moist warm cake topped with glazed pineapple and served with salted caramel ice cream and macadamia brittle, drool, so good!\n\nThe service was great too.  Our waitress was very attentive.  It seems like they had an abundance of staff; we noticed each waiter only had three or four tables.  Ours was very helpful with recommendations and even brought us deviled eggs (on the house) when our entrees were taking a bit longer than expected.  \n\nWayfare Tavern was excellent and I will definitely be coming back again.

The only reservations available for a Saturday evening were 4:30 pm and 10:30 pm.  I opted for 10:30 and now wonder if that affected the quality of the food, because the fried chicken honestly underwhelmed me.\n\nThe meal started off very promisingly with their delicious popover bread.  It was so light fluffy and slightly cheesy and super warm.  Since it was 10:30 pm and we weren't too hungry, we decided to share an order of deviled eggs, organic fried chicken, and mac and cheese.\n\nThe deviled eggs were quite delicious.  The chicken, as I stated, was underwhelming.  I appreciated that the pieces were small due to their organic nature.   It was juicy and tender and you could taste the rosemary, but I just found something in its flavor to be lacking.  It didn't hit all the notes for me.  The mac and cheese was a bit too heavy.  We each only had a bite because we were too full already to enjoy it.\n\nI would come again just to see if the fried chicken thing was a fluke and also for the amazing amazing popovers\n\nLoved the ambience and if you go, be sure check out the restrooms on the basement level.  I felt like I was transported to a different age and it smelled so good down there which can so rarely be said about a restroom.", "author": "Attila T."}

I am back in San Francisco for a short trip home and I really wanted to have a nice meal out with my family. We got here a little early for dinner (around 5:30 pm), but by the time we left it was packed, especially for a monday night. I love how the menu changes every so often so there is always something slightly different, but you can always expect your favorite to be there. We started with two cocktails, The Rocketeer and the Tavern Sour, and both were excellent. Mine, The Rocketeer, tasted like a spiked pink lemonade. For appetizers we had the deviled eggs and shrimp cocktail. The whipped yolk of the deviled egg tasted like butter and was topped with mustard seeds, making it slightly spicy. The shrimp were so fresh and HUGE that we ordered a second round. As an entree I got the skirt steak, because I had only ever ordered the fried chicken and wanted to get something different. The steak was served on top of corn bread muffins, and was topped off with a peach-corn compote. The juices from the steak were absorbed by the corn bread (which was baked  PERFECTLY, it was bouncy, not crumbly or dry), and the peach and corn were both sweet, but the flavor of the steak was so deep and rich. All while drinking a nice malbec. I swear, a meal here is all about indulgence. And for dessert- YES WE ORDERED MORE- we got the strawberry shortcake and the donuts. The strawberry shortcake was one of the most beautiful presentations I had ever seen. Who doesn't love edible flowers? The shortcake itself was so good, it tasted like a quick bread, cinnamony and clove-ish. BUT THE DONUTS THE DONUTS ALONE WERE WORTH THE WHOLE BILL. I am a very big donut fan, so when I received the dessert menu I was quite ecstatic. After my first bite I burst out laughing. It was a \"Stupid Good\" experience. They were so chewy and doughy, but the glaze and exterior of the donut gave it the best crunch. It came with three dipping sauces: caramel, raspberry and strawberry. Not necessary, but again this is a meal for indulgence. Best donut I've ever had. \n\nThe service was just as good as that donut. Our waiter, Ali K. (I hope that is spelled correctly), was so attentive, personable and polite. Anyone that laughs at my Dad's jokes is a very sympathetic soul. But seriously, the busboys, the hosts, everyone was just so friendly. It has a very elegant atmosphere, but the service and food is so comforting. It is pricey compared to your average restaurant, but this isn't an average restaurant. It's amazing. THIS IS MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT.", "author": "Isabella G."}

I could not let this accomplishment go by unrewarded.  \n\nI have been to Wayfare about four times.  The food is consistently very good, but you can read about that in others' reviews.  I want to talk about dessert.  The dessert is consistently amazing.  \n\nI grew up with professional chefs in my family and have lived in the bay area for the past ten years.  I have had the fortunate opportunity to experience many of the bay area's best restaurants and hands-down, Wayfare has the best desserts.\n\nEverything I have tried - including chocolate cupcake, caramel walnut tart, pineapple upside-down cake and rocky-road chocolate mousse - has been stunning.  There are no words to describe the carrot cake, but I will say that if I could only eat one dessert the rest of my life, that would be it.  Clearly, I take carrot cake very seriously. \n\nThe dessert menu changes seasonally.  The pastry chef always uses locally grown/produced, quality ingredients that are in season.  Last week we went in, sat at the bar and just had dessert.  We had the peach pie and chocolate cream pie.  They were immaculate in both presentation and taste.  It definitely made our hour long commute into the City worth every minute.  \n\nThank you Wayfare Pastry Chef.  Please stay in San Francisco forever.", "author": "Meghan M."}

First, we were a party of 6 and they gave us a booth(terrible) then the waiter started taking all the plates and wine glasses from the table and asking us to passed them to him.  That's when everything started going down the hill.  We had to wait about 10 min for just water.  We asked for a bottle of wine and they took another 20 min.  We had to get their attention to bring more water and finally they came and asked us what we wanted to eat.  Some of us had the fry chicken( not cooked well) and others had pasta which it was not great.  Again the passing of dishes to the waiter was terrible.  Why do you have to pass dishes??? Come on WT that is super annoying and tacky for a restaurant like yours.  The service was terrible because you have to beg for their attention.

Steak tartare: This was good but what I really loved about it was the crispy crostini you put the tartare on. Usually, the crostini will be so crispy that you'll feel like you're breaking your teeth when you bite in, but this was perfectly crispy but still soft enough where you didn't feel like you were gnawing on something. Loved it. Would order this again as well\n3. Gem salad: Typical with avocado, strawberries, etc. Good salad but nothing out of the ordinary\n4. Fried Chicken - You gotta order the signature dish. While good, I didn't think it was anything amazing. The crispy skin though was very delicious but other than that, the white meat was a tad bit on the dry side.

Despite my husband finishing his cocktail during the appetizer and ordering another before the appetizer was removed, our entrees arrived before we are able to get a second drink from our waiter-- who came to check on us during the entree and said \"oh, you're waiting on a drink\" after mentioning to the server bringing our dinner to the table that we were waiting on another drink. In short, we were consistently ignored and waited unacceptably long to get very basic things-- and for me, the mark of fine dining is feeling that you're being attended to as well as getting a delicious meal.  Simply not worth it and won't be back.", "author": "Amy S."}

Half the time we sit at the bar but wherever we are, the service and ambiance are always great and the food, cocktails and wine are delicious.\n\nIt was no surprise that \"boyfriend\" made a reservation here for my birthday dinner.  Romantic table for two... or so I thought...  He had reserved the private room upstairs - the one where the table is actually a pool table - and a dozen of my beloved friends were there to celebrate with us.  I was so happy I could've eaten cardboard washed down with water and been satisfied, but the meal and the service and the room were spectacular!  Having worked in many restaurants I'm familiar with the challenges a large party can present but our server, Katie and the kitchen staff are pros. Everything was impeccable but wonderfully fun.  After dessert we drank and played pool till closing and went home fat and happy.\n\nThank you WT, my wonderful love and friends for my best birthday ever!", "author": "Chaele C."}

Right when we got there, we were immediately greeted by the staff and seated within a couple of minutes.  Our waiter was super cool.  He was on top of everything and made great recommendations (especially the Saint Simon, Shippagan, New Brunswick oysters).  The staff ensured that our water never dropped below a half full glass (I'm an optimistic person), cleared plates immediately, and checked on us often (but not to a point that was annoying).\n\nA problem that my GF and I run into is ordering too much food.  When we're hungry, we let our stomachs order everything it desires.  By the time the entree comes out, we barely can finish half of it.  Maybe one day we'll get better about ordering...\n\nHere's what our stomachs ordered:\nPomegranate fizz:  Just how it sounds.  A fizzy pomegranate cocktail\n\nSaint Simon, Shippagan, New Brunswick oysters:  Fresh, small, and slightly sweet\n\nMaine lobster corn chowder:  A rich chowder that has the perfect flavor of both lobster and corn\n\nOrganic fried chicken:  WOW!  I had to be judge of this one since everyone raves about it and now I totally agree that this chicken is awesome!  The chicken is super juicy, not oily, contained the perfect amount of batter, and was delicious. BTW, the plate came out with 5 pieces so you can probably share this one or have some leftovers.\n\nWayfare burger:  I had to try this out since it was voted as one of the top 25 burgers in SF by SF Weekly.  Lately, I've been liking eggs added to my dishes so we added a sunny side up egg.  The beef they use is flavorful and the patty was cooked to perfection.  The cheese, along with the egg, and the soft patty made the burger melt in your mouth.\n\nBaked macaroni and cheese:  I can't really comment on it since my stomach was full and barely touched it.\n\nAfter ordering all this food, we eventually had to tap out and got a doggy bag.  2 pieces of chicken, mac and cheese, and fries was packed up for lunch the next day.\n\nSo how much did all of this hurt our pockets?  A lil over $100 without tip.  \n\nWas worth it?  Did the Giants just sweep the Tigers?\n\nWould I go back?  The 5 stars answers this question.", "author": "Suzi K."}

I perused the menu online beforehand so I was pretty set on what I was getting when we arrived. We started the night with a round of cocktails (good cocktails, though not the best) and then ordered appetizers to start before delving into entrees. For apps, we opted for the beet/buratta salad, the sardines and the piquillo peppers. Everything was exceptional (I was surprised out how much I liked the sardines, actually) but the beets took the cake -- sooo good. \n\nFor dinner, I ended up with the ahi salad (great, though not overly filling for bigger eaters) but fried chicken, chicken paillard and a pork chop also graced the table. My guess -- based on everyone's reactions -- is that the pork chop and fried chicken were the best orders of the night. We also had an order of brussels sprouts and mac & cheese for the table, both of which were incredible. Though not part of the menu, I have to say their bread (popovers, actually) are delicious. I'm normally not a huge bread fan, but I definitely opted in when the server came around with seconds! I was pleasantly surprised with the wine, as well. I'm not a huge red wine drinker, but the Zin (Stuhlmuller, maybe?) that we had was remarkably good and fairly reasonable considering the environment (and considering the fact that corkage hovers around $25/bottle). All in all, great experience. In terms of attire (I know there are ladies out there wondering), it kind of ran the gamut. You could definitely go in business attire, dark denim and a nice blouse, or you could play dress up for an evening and fit in equally either way!", "author": "Shannon E."}

But this time around, I found the food to be a be a bit hit or miss. However, I am still giving it 4 stars because when it hit, it was great, and I loved the wonderful atmosphere and the attentive service.\n\nWe ordered the following between three people\n\nRabbit terrine - I really like this dish. I found the fruity flavors to be complementary with the rabbit and all the elements combined pieced together the dish really nicely.\n\nDeviled eggs - These were really great as well. However, my impression of the dish is that I feel like the curry had the strongest influence which dictated the dish and was a bit over powering all the other ingredients. \n\nMac and Cheese - This dish was arguably the most well executed. I have nothing else to say except that it was heavenly to the palate.  \n\nOrganic Fried Chicken - Sadly, I did not enjoy this dish very much at all. It may be that I'm not a a big fan of fried chicken to begin with.\nSpeaking from an objective point of view, I did really like the way the chicken was breaded. It was very lightly breaded with a very nice crisp and crunch. \nHowever the meat itself was a bit bland and a bit on the dry side. It was not infused with rosemary or garlic flavors which was a bit disappointing. Instead it was served with a whole plant of rosemary on top and a few roasted garlic pieces on the side. I enjoyed the roasted garlic pieces quite a lot, but I was left in confusion about the concept of how to combine all the elements of the dish together.\n\nSmoked Sonoma Pork ribs - The star of the dish was definitely the roasted plums. They were very nicely complemented by the barbeque sauce! I did not find the sauce to be very spectacular. It was definitely great to taste, but there was nothing special about it. The ribs were also a bit dry and was not very tender but I think I can forgive that because they haven't been slow cooked for a long period of time.  It was over all just an okay dish for what it was, but I wouldn't say that this was anything special if the ribs were meant to be the main focus. \n\nNV Caposaldo Prosecco Brut Veneto - I have to mention the wine here because I was very impressed with the service of how our waiter was very attentive and made sure that all our glasses were filled with wine and water through out our meal. \n\nThank you Wayfare Tavern. I did have a wonderful dinner with great company in a very speakeasy, energetic, and classy atmosphere. I will come back but I will definitely explore other options next time.", "author": "Zu W."}

The beef tar tar and deviled eggs never fail.  The Fried Chicken is the moist and crispy star of the show and should not be missed.  The salads are always exceptional fresh and filled with the most colorful and crisp farmer's market quality produce available.  The fresh from the oven complimentary popovers are a huge tasty plus as is the solid wine selection. The wait staff is hit or miss but always good-natured.  This is a great lunch spot and I recommend the chef's counter for a fun show but don't expect to be in and out in a standard hour.

No problem checking in early, grabbed a few seats at the bar.\n\nThe service here really shines. Both bartenders were quick to recognize us (before we had seats) and listened attentively while my wife (who isn't a big drinker) described what she liked and didn't like - recommendations were a hit. Red wines were good, maybe a little pricey per glass.\n\nDinner: Kobe tartar - ridiculous and clearly top-cut and fresh. Bread that came with it was worth eating alone. \n\nDeviled Eggs - really? I was confused. Had been told this was a high-end dinner establishment. I do not like eggs. I do not eat eggs. I stand corrected. These were delicious and I would order again. You've never had deviled eggs like these. \n\nChicken - I was hesitant at ordering \"plain old fried chicken\" but my friend almost demanded that I order it. Probably the best I've had in my life. I will compare this to Ad Hoc next week, but I think they have their work cut out for them.\n\nRibeye - PERFECTLY cooked. Delicious. Hard to go wrong with this dish. You can taste the dry-aging. Worth every penny. \n\nDesert - we were full and passed on desert, sans one small bowl of sorbet. Waitress brought us each a bite-sized piece of spice cake for free anyway. Excellent. \n\nGreat atmosphere, can be intimate or crowded depending on how you choose to experience it. I would easily go back for either lunch or dinner.\n\nI am not an SF native, and would tell anyone passing through to set aside an evening to dine here.", "author": "Nathaniel H."}

WT is delicious, and a crowd-pleaser.  It's hard not to be happy here, which counts for something.\n\nAPPS\n- Popover: I want to live inside of this thing.  Ask for seconds, don't be shy.\n- Poutine: Not my favorite dish at WT.  Fries get soggy, which is hard to avoid in a Poutine, but more than that I find the dish a little bit boring.  It's certainly good though - dining companions all loved it.\n- Beef Tartare: Garlicky, creamy and absurdly delicious.  Can't go wrong here.\n\nENTREES\n- Filet: I ordered this one.  It was good, not spectacular, though I'm not a huge filet fan in general so I'm not sure why I ordered it in the first place.  The onion rings on top kind of blew my mind, though.\n- Fried Chicken: Moister than a living chicken.  They must've brined the hell out of this bad boy.  Great spices, great portion, absolutely lives up to the hype.\n- Burger: I'm confused by some of the negative reviews here.  This burger was spectacular, and I'm not easily impressed by burgers.  Don't be an idiot and order anything other than medium-rare.  I would come back here just for the burger.\n\nSIDES\n- Broccoli Rabe: Sleeper hit of the meal.  Buttery breadcrumbs and raisins complemented the bitter rabe.  Very, very good.\n\nDESSERT\n- Chocolate Cream Pie: Basically a butter crust filled with superlative chocolate pudding and topped with not-too-sweet cream.  Fantastic.\n\nAMBIANCE/SERVICE: \nAmbiance is one of WT's strong suits.  The restaurant is old and classic in a good way, without seeming dated.  Hard to pull this off.  It just feels good to be here, which makes up for any slight unevenness in the food and service.  The service is good, not great.

My first time here was for a Yelp Elite event so I was unable to form a solid opinion of the restaurant because we didn't actually get to sit down to eat.\n\nWe came in the middle of the lunch rush and were promptly seated at the bar. The very friendly bartender served us some of their house made potato chips (yum!) and took our drink orders. I had their signature Manhattan and my friend ordered a classic margarita.\n\nThe Manhattan gets 5 out of 5 stars. They use white rye from High West which they age for 6 weeks in their own small oak barrels until they extract enough oak to be a lighter, fresher, friendlier rye. The Manhattan is expertly prepared, beautifully balanced and I enjoyed it very much. My friend loved her margarita which was made with their well tequila.\n\nWe were served popovers with honey butter which were a great start to the meal. They were crispy and flavorful without being heavy.\n\nI ordered the fried chicken entree. It came topped with fried woody herbs (sage, thyme, rosemary), roasted garlic and lemon wedges. It was absolutely delectable. The breast was juicy and the dark meat was perfect. It was not fried too much or too little; it was absolutely divine. My friend ordered the burger with the fried egg which she also enjoyed very much. My only complaint there is the $19 + $2 egg price tag seems high for a burger, even if from a fancy place.\n\nWe ordered the peach pie and a glass of their Mosel riesling for dessert which was a nice accompaniment for the dish. The peach pie was fantastic. It was beautiful, not too sweet and I loved the ice cream & candied rosemary garnish. My only complaint is that the crust of the pie seemed a bit heavy and not flaky like traditional pie crust, but I suspect that was just the style they were looking for. It was not flawed in any way and I still enjoyed it very much.\n\nThe service was timed well and very friendly. The whole experience was quite decadent without being pretentious. I knocked a star because I think the prices are high, but it's not uncommon for restaurants trying to do something similar to serve food that is not nearly as good for the same prices that you find here.\n\nI would definitely come back for dinner. This is definitely a \"special occasion\" place, not a casual dining experience but I really enjoyed it and look forward to coming back.", "author": "Tala D."}

They have a subtle curry flavor, are topped with golden raisins and flowers, and I could probably eat all 6 myself, calories and all.  The fried chicken was crispy, it didn't have layers of fat (perhaps they skinned the chicken and then battered it?)  and it had an awesome peppery flavor to it.  We also had the ahi tuna, which were little chunks of pretty tuna and dollops of pureed sweet potato.  Awesome!  We didn't have any room for dessert at all although it was a birthday dinner, so the waiter gave us complimentary mini crumb cake bites.  Those were the only thing I didn't like, actually.

The waitress accidentally dropped a bowl of soup on his brand new iphone 5, which is OK because mistakes happen. They quickly cleaned up the mess and the manager, Evan, came over and told us to do whatever it will take to replace our phone and they will take care of it. Sounds painless doesn't it? Well...it has been everything but that. \n\nMy boyfriend is extremely busy so I took half a day off to wait at the phone store to get his phone fixed. The phone ended up being so broken that they couldn't fix it. We were both annoyed - I had to wait a few hours and he was phone-less for half a day. We ended up having to purchase the phone at retail and sent Evan the receipt per instructed and didn't hear back till almost a week later. We were then referred to another manager, Tony, who called my boyfriend and asked a few questions but we didn't hear from him for two weeks. Last week, we called him again to follow up and he said he'd call him back the next day. No response. We called and emailed again. No response. It has been a whole month with no updates. The phone was so broken we had to purchase one at retail price - We had no insurance. no upgrade since we JUST got the phone. So it cost us $1k to replace it. And it's not even just about the money - it's the principle and customer service that they clearly lack. \n\nYour team broke our phone. Why should we be the one chasing the restaurant for a reimbursement/replacement? I would imagine they would feel extremely apologetic and try to get this resolved as soon as possible. Instead, it's been a month and we haven't heard a word.\n\nSo bottom line - we spent $1k replacing the phone, spent a few hours waiting at the phone store, lost a few strands of hair being so frustrated with the manager who would not get back to us or give us a solid update. They are so fortunate my boyfriend is so patient and nice. If it was my phone, I would be calling Tony or Evan everyday or even waiting outside the restaurant. How can you blow someone off after you break his phone?\n\nAnyways, I would never take my clients here to eat and I would never recommend any of my friends to eat here.

The server was super efficient and extra friendly, qualities I appreciate as an eager eater. \n\nDespite being solo, I ordered the kobe beef tartare to start and prawn salad for my entree. But before all that, a warm, delectable popover was delivered to the table accompanied by room temperature butter dusted with coarse salt. Not familiar with popovers, I was surprised at how light and soft the interior was compared with the hard baked crust.The kobe beef was delicious, topped with an farm egg yolk, crispy fried shallots and fresh pepper. It was served with a quartered popover drizzled with an herb infused olive oil that made for a great texture combo. A word of caution: this dish is best for more than one person, especially if you're hoping to stay awake through the remainder of the afternoon. Food coma. The salad was good. The perfectly seasoned and gently cooked prawns were awesome; the highlight of the salad. The rest of the salad was okay: thinly sliced fennel and field greens with a super light vinaigrette that could have used a little more punch. Add to the mix a glass of wine and I can't complain about my Wayfare Tavern experience. \n\nThe financial district is a fun place to lunch for people watching. As someone who wears pajamas to work, watching the high-end outfits roll through the doors was definitely entertaining. Go early and sit at the bar or get a reservation but be sure to pop over (oh yeah) to  Wayfare Tavern if you're looking for a well-crafted meal.", "author": "Corey F."}

The cocktail list was fabulous, with an equally as wonderful wine list. The meal started with buttery, warm popovers that melted in your mouth. The butter lettuce salad was superb with fresh vegetables and a light vinaigrette. The mac n' cheese was surprisingly light (for mac n' cheese) with a breadcrumb topping. The salmon was the most disappointing part, but still delicious. Just not as much flavor or finesse as the rest of the meal. We ended on a high note, enjoying the peaches n' cream dessert. I am a sucker for tres leche and the poached peaches with homemade peach ice cream rounded it out perfectly. Oh, and not to mention it was topped with the best meringue kisses we have had.", "author": "B D."}

The deviled eggs texture was smooth but the flavor fell short since all I could taste was vinegar and salt. The burger was meh as well where it was nothing special. The bread was very greasy to the point where it was not a good feeling having your fingers soaked in grease all the time. Also the patty had no charred flavor or any flavor for that matter and the cheese overpowered the whole thing. I had a bite of the fried chicken and it was better than the burger but not the best I had. I felt it just had a really thick coating which gave a nice crunch but I like my fired think with a think coating that is still crispy but super moist inside (think bon chon in NYC or LA)", "author": "Chris S."}

And a celebrity chef to boot!\n\nWe went on a not-so-busy Sunday night (Easter) and were seated right away at the bar that rims an exhibition kitchen. Very interesting and comfortable place to sit and watch the show. The kitchen was a well-oiled machine turning out beautiful dish after dish without a hitch.\n\nI ordered one of the specials, a veal rib chop that was slightly pounded and grilled with a puttanesca topping. Slightly over-done (the waiter didn't ask how I wanted it cooked, thought that was a little odd), it was still juicy and flavorful with a rich jus underneath the chop. Didn't care much for the topping. Whole anchovies and huge croutons just weren't a nice compliment. The BF ordered pot roast and raved about how tender it was. I can attest to it's gravy being wonderful.\n\nThe mac & cheese side was delectable. Rich and creamy with the perfect contrast crunch of crumb topping. Took a couple of bites and dragged them through the meat jus...heavenly stuff! The side is perfect to share, might be too much of a good thing for one.\n\nI was really looking forward to trying the sticky toffee pudding for dessert and it did not disappoint. Moist pudding cake with caramel pooling underneath and a small scoop of ginger ice cream on the side...WOW!! Probably should have just split that, but we were gluttons and got the carrot cake too. Impressively moist and so cute, it was also a stand-out dessert. \n\n\nOur waiter was very smooth and personable to start, but about midway through our meal he picked up a larger party. Suddenly, the three couples he was serving at the bar were much less of a priority. It didn't become bad service, just disappointingly average.\n\nAfter debating between coming here or going somewhere a little fancier, I'm really pleased with our choice. Warm and inviting on a chilly night, it made for a memorable San Fran dining experience.", "author": "Amy J."}

The buttermilk batter was very tasteful. The chicken was moist but lacked flavor. No side dishes. This is probably better to share among a few people instead of having as an entree.\n\nGoing based on another review that the bartenders here are mixologist. I decided to shoot a base liquor out and let her decide what to make for me. Waitress took my order and walked over to the bartender. To my surprise, I could literally see the bartender shaking her head with the WTF look on her face like she didn't know what to make. Well, what came out was Grey Goose, Ginger beer, grapefruit juice and something else for about $14. Tasted good but I should have just stuck to a draft beer.\n\nAll in all, a $50 including tip experience that wasn't very memorable. Was the chicken OK enough for me to come back? Nope.\n\nOn a good note, the service was good.", "author": "Ken N."}

We were all excited and looking forward to it, and we had a fantastic evening-- but not because the food or service was good -- exactly the opposite!! It was one bungle after another. At first we were merely amused and gave each other *the look* while our waiter said or did one rude or inept thing after another. Still, given Tyler Florence's reputation, we thought the food would make up for the bad service. Wrong! We ordered many dishes, but they were so tasteless or unpalatable that we only took a bite or two from each. Even the popovers mentioned by many other yelpers were sub-par hard shells. We were incredulous as one bad dish after another came from the kitchen. The sole saving grace was the doughnuts which were amazing! We eat out a lot, in a wide variety of different kinds of places, and I don't think any of us has ever experienced such largely mediocre -- and in a couple of cases, inedible -- food. By the end of the evening, we were laughing over all the bad food, pathetic service, and multiple mistakes -- talked about it for days! Very fun evening though ... in a perverted sort of way!\n\nSave your money and go almost anywhere else in San Francisco. With all the fabulous restaurants in this city, it's astounding that Wayfare is still in business.", "author": "E. G."}

It has a very old-school vibe with a mod flare....hard to describe, but I liked it.  We sat upstairs at a corner table, and it was perfect.  There's a special room for private parties-- good to know if you're with a big group or having an event.\nWe ordered the deviled eggs to start, and they were yummy!\nMy companions ordered the pork chop and fried chicken, and they were happy.  I went with the white sea bass, and it was cooked nicely.  Not overdone and not overseasoned, which is tough to come by.  Two thumbs up.\nWe ordered the brussel sprouts and mac and cheese for the table, and both were good.  I like the brussel sprouts more, but that's just b/c I love my veggies! :)\n\nThe wine list is also extensive and has some great choices at reasonable price points.\n\nThis is a place that would be difficult for vegetarians (I do fish so I was ok, but I had to pass on most of the sides and starters), and it's definitely not a good choice if you're counting calories.

So we opted for just stopping by around 7ish to see if we could snatch seats by the bar or maybe even be lucky enough to get one of those unicorn tables reserved for walk-ins.  The place is packed at 7.15.  Tourists in jeans, locals seeking a happy hour good time in suits, hip diners with important celebrations, and us, the hopefuls.  We left our name with the hostess and proceeded to the bar, eyeing the couple behind us, with a bite or two left in their plates.  Then something happened: Before I could even take a second sip of my delicious bourbon cocktail, a table was available.  \n\nYou know the disclaimer made by those fancy restaurants about tables reserved for walk-ins, that basically it's just an urban legend kind of marketing scheme to make the restaurant look off the hook busy.   But we got a table upstairs.  I was in shock.  I usually make a reservation way ahead of time and still have to wait forever for my table to get ready.  Never had I experienced the reverse.  How lovely.\n\nThen came the food.  We were pre warned that portions here are huge.  So we decided to share the sardines, the avocado salad, a side of shishito peppers, and an entree of steak and frites.  Would that be enough...?  I wondered in the back of my head.  Yes.  More than enough.\n\nThe sardine appetizer came with two big sardines, head to tail, grilled to perfection.  That alone could've been someone's entree.  The avocado salad was split in the kitchen into two plates for us, and even half of the salad was impressively large.  I guess Wayfare serves everything 2X bigger.  Both the sardine and salad were delicious.  \n\nThe side peppers were also great.  They brought me right back to Barcelona, that tiny seafood bar in the market, where a old couple insisted that I tried some of their appetizer, even though we could not communicate otherwise.  They were spicy, salty, and for $8 that was a lot of yummy peppers.\n\nSo by the time the steak and frites came, I was pretty much full.  Steak was juicy and tasty, and fries were crunchy.  Finished with a chocolate cake with my name artistically written on the plate...  I was floored.\n\nJust like Tyler, providing the best without an attitude, this place has won me over.

The meat did not have that nutty fresh ground taste that other steak places seem to be able to cook up...it may be due to not having a really white hot open flame...making the wayfarer burger oily and gummy.  \nI by passed on the egg, deciding it was a token fillmeupforcheap add-on...however the complimentary bacon and onion on top were both not edible again in part to the cooking temperature.  \nThe poor X pieces of bacon were not crispy and the meat was much too chewy to be swallowed,  \nOne piece of butter lettuce and maybe a tomato was on the plate...but for goodness sake if you want to be local and you want to be all about fresh ingredients then that fuckin burger should have condiments that look like a salad bar on the side with fresh regional produce.\n\nThe cream corn tasted like it was prepped...freshly cooked white corn cobs scrapped  of kernels then served tepid with cream...it needed salt & pepper and the cream to be heavier...I would have preferred the corn on the cob be left alone perfectly par boiled and served as a side with a buttery dip.\n\nOK...sorry for the bad write-up but I have to disagree with all the 5 star OMG best meal ever reviews...I followed and now need to provide balance to this place.\n\nChef said the gold standard will always be Chez Panisse and I have to agree...for my next big occasion I will remember to just go to the gold standard.\nWhat has been created here is an Applebees. \nWill not ever return and will now take the TF fast food place on the Napa waterfront Off my recommend to others list.", "author": "Cee G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-04-13", "description": "Popovers, Poutine, Baked Macaroni and Cheese, Duck Gumbo, and a Triple Order of Surly\n\nIt was a quick walk from the hotel to Wayfare Tavern, Tyler Florence's new restaurant nestled in the middle of the Financial District. We arrived just before 11am but found the door open and ourselves, by design, the first party to arrive.\n\n\"Table for three,\" I say, smiling and glancing down at my daughter in the stroller.\n\n\"Do you have a reservation?\" asks the rather dour greeter, glancing down at my daughter in the stroller.\n\n\"We don't.\"\n\n\"Welllllllll...I could either seat you at the bar or at these stand ups over here. I guess I could give you a table, but I would absolutely have to have it back by noon.\"\n\n\"We'll do the table and have it back by noon.\"\n\nShe looks like I've just taken away her birthday and stomped her left big toe simultaneously.\n\n\"Please follow me,\" she said on a tone that sounded a lot more like \"Please jump off your choice of either of our city's convenient and picturesque bridges and be sure to take the stroller and its contents with you.\"\n\nWe get seated and a server literally races over to us. \"I understand we're in a bit of a hurry? I can get your orders into the kitchen immediately.\"\n\nLuckily, he's dealing with people who study menus online before they show up. We know pretty much where we're heading, so we get them started on the poutine while we figure out an entree to split. We settle on duck gumbo and a side of macaroni and cheese.\n\nWhile they get to work on the food, we speculated about the source of the attitude. It seems odd to complain about our taking a table that was unoccupied and was unlikely to be so for the hour it'll take to eat our meal. Our thoughts turned to the location: maybe our decidedly casual attire and the presence of a baby clashes with the Financial District chic they are attempting to affect. However, I did call the night before and ask about whether Ainsley would be welcome, and was assured that she would be...though, come to think of it, the woman on the phone followed that up with the fact that they didn't have a reservation available until 9:30pm. And it was five on a weeknight when I called.\n\nPopovers arrived. I'd read raves about them. Maybe Sourpuss' attitude was sufficiently unpleasant that it made me resentful and harsh on them. Hard to say for sure, but I found the popovers to be just ok. They were eggy and the cheese taste is strong, but aside from those two notes, there's not much going on. I really would have preferred a regular bread, to be honest. I tried them with the butter and didn't really find them to be anything more special even when doused liberally.\n\nNothing but a thumb to the eye from St. Peter himself could have ruined the poutine, however. With all of the previous brittleness working against it, our table fell silent as we devoured that plate. Nicely crisped and slightly browned potatoes were already wilting under the weight of mozzarella curd, a rather generous portion of tender-as-my-wounded-father-feelings braised beef short rib, and some deep, complex truffle gravy, topped with several shaves of black truffle for good measure. I am grateful that I very carefully split the order onto our two plates prior to eating as, had we simply eaten off the same plate, I might have forgotten that I am a generous husband and gone feral and greedy. As boring as I found the popovers to be, they do make for a fine sop for truffle gravy.\n\nAnd it's downhill from there. The macaroni and cheese arrived and has the texture and flavor of a plate full of glue. I'm usually pretty harsh when it comes to mac and cheese -- it's one of those dishes where chefs tend to cut corners and the final product shows it -- but when Loria pipes in saying \"that is terrible\" before I've said anything, I know it's a pretty poor plate. She usually loves even the most unlovable macaroni and cheese. Limp pasta, barely browned bread crumbs, and an unpleasant cheese sauce binding it together. $8 completely wasted.\n\nThe duck gumbo is a better written dish on the menu than actually arrives. There's nothing overtly wrong about it, but it's nothing extraordinary beyond being a perfectly nice bowl of gumbo with duck confit. To make things worse, Ainsley apparently sensed that she's unwelcome and began to fuss, so Loria took her off to a restroom to feed. I shoveled down the rest of the gumbo, asked for Loria's half of the gumbo to be packaged to go, and beat a hasty retreat through a dining room full to the brim with two whole occupied tables. Whew, sure glad we made it out by noon to avoid what is clearly a lunch crush in the making.\n\nIn the only nice moment of service, I was given a coat check ticket at the table and, when we're ready to go, I hand it to Sourpuss in exchange for our leftovers that have been neatly packed into a bag.\n\nThanks Wayfare and fare thee well!

Love the speak-easy/prohibition era theme the place has going on inside. Love that the place is two story. The decor is very reminiscent of 1920/1930 era, which I love. Not to mention the music all consisted of jazz legends such as Fitzgerald, Sinatra, Holiday, etc. Our waiter was incredibly friendly and helpful and staff were exceptionally nice and polite. The deviled eggs were spectacular! We also ordered the the rotisserie chicken (their famous chicken) and the halibut. All were delicious, but my friend mentioned her chicken was undercooked since it was a bit raw from the inside. The macaroni and cheese was to die for!!! The handmade doughnuts were out of this world good! They are not your typical doughnuts from a bakery. Overall, Wayfare Tavern is a really wonderful spot to have dinner with friends, a date, or even family. Classy but not formal setting is the perfect spot for everyone to bond over delicious food!", "author": "Lanai L."}

I really enjoyed the burrata.\n\nMy husband had the steak frites.  He ordered them medium rare and they were cooked perfectly.  But, the steak was really, really chewy.  They use tri-tip.  Not sure if it was type of meat or because they cut it very thick (if you slice meat thinly on a diagonal, meat is a little more tender).  If you want a 5 star steak frite, go to Florio on Fillmore.\n\nI got the fried chicken.  It was good but the fried chicken at Street (only on Sunday nights) is so much better.\n\nAlso had the Loster salad.  It was the worst salad I've had.  It had so much salt on it.  I really should have sent it back since I paid $24 for it.  Worst thing I've eaten in a long time.\n\nThe mac & cheese, chocolate cream pie, and brown butter cake were good.\n\nService was not the greatest.

I believe now in retrospect that it was a classic of case of trying to do too much.  A truly great burger should be able to stand on it's own accord with minimal toppings (maybe one, two max).  Wayfare throws bacon on there and the option of a fried egg.  Even without the fried egg (mmmm cholesterol) methinks the bacon might have been too much.  Ended up being a grease-fest that just tasted like greasy meat.  Not that this was bad, it certainly TASTED good but it didn't satisfy on that other carnal level that a truly good burger does.\n\nOverall that's my main knock on Wayfare...other than the salads and the bread, everything came out sopped in butter.  Again, not that this may be bad in most cases (who doesnt love butter?), but the liberal application of it seemed to overpower the true taste of the dishes.\n\nI would go back for a drink, if for nothing else than to sit under the deer head above the fireplace.", "author": "Jon M."}

If you have ever been to Europe, you know they have a special magic with fries. Frites there are light, NEVER greasy and crisp with a dusting of salt and that's that. These are just like the frites from overseas, which is saying a lot. \n\nGrilled Branzino will have the skin on, lending a crunch that is unbelievable and beautiful in your smattering of lemon puree and mustard greens pesto. \n\nPoutine will be a different take on short ribs, mozzarella and fries that you won't believe. Blink and it's gone. \n\nYour steak will be perfect. Your drink will be grandiose. Yes, a satisfaction will pour over you with every bite, but let's not gloss over the star of this show. \n\nYes, you all mentioned the popovers. Did you say that they are in place of the generic bread basket? NO. Did you say that they keep them comin as long as you keep wolfing them? NO. I LOVED these light, eggy and parmesan topped oblong baked treats. I excited tore into the first one. They are served with butter, but who even needs it. Hot, steamy, moist inner, crisp and dry outer all together make for a delectable cohesion of butter, egg and flour. I loved the first one. I loved the second one. I looooved the third one. \n\nOrder the winter mushroom side. Trust me. Take the popover, tear it open and stuff it with those earthy, meaty, savory, gorgeous mushrooms and you don't even need dinner.

It is also why we chose to contact them as this place is a big enough space that it shouldn't be an issue to have a group dine. And it is why I called and tried to have a conversation with them and see how we could make it work...\n\n**********\n\nTried to get a reservation for a weeknight dinner for 11 people. Their website says groups larger than 12 need to contact their event staff and make special arrangements. I called and spoke with their reservationist and explained we wanted a table or two tables near each other - for 11 people. She said their event coordinator would call me back. I should have questioned at that point, but being in a hurry I said that would be fine. \n\nTwo days later I get a call and the woman left me the following message: We have availability in our 'blah blah' room upstairs, the room fee is $400, food and bev minimum of $1500 not including tax and tip. Please call me if you would like me to reserve the space for your group. \n\nI called her back and said, I think there is some confusion, we don't need a private room and we are a party of less than 12 (as it states on the website) We just want to make a reservation - maybe two tables, split us up? We were totally willing to be flexible... unfortunately this restaurant was not willing to be flexible... flat out they would not take our reservation unless we agreed to the minimums and fees. We said NO THANKS! \n\nWe knew that we would be paying over $200 per person and probably only eating and drinking about half of that due to the minimums and fees imposed. Just perusing the menu online and knowing what we all eat - $100 +/- per person was probably about accurate - so we fully expected to blow about $1200 that night (maybe more) \n\nSad - I would have liked to have eaten here... oh well. Their loss - as we did find a wonderful place and 11 people learned that Wayfare Tavern isn't flexible. Not good PR.

I will allocate real estate in my brain to remember a good burger or a hearty mac 'n' cheese five years after eating it. That's why I was so happy to get a last-minute table at Wayfare Tavern and yet so sad when it the food didn't live up to the Tyler Florence hype.\n\nI brought my friend Catherine N. here for a belated birthday. The best part of the meal was the popover, free red wine, and caramelized popcorn (all of which we received on the house). Everything I actually shelled out  for was overpriced or underwhelming. We shared the steak tartare ($16), California dates wrapped in bacon ($12), the deviled Jidori eggs ($9), and the organic fried chicken ($22).\n\nFirst, the steak tartare wasn't bad but wasn't comparable to that at Chez Papa Resto (http://www.yelp.com/biz/chez-papa-resto-san-francisco-4). Next, the bacon-wrapped dates were a nice contrast between salty and sweet, but $12--really? Then our server recommended the deviled eggs; I don't think Market Bar does anything right except for its mean deviled eggs (http://www.yelp.com/biz/market-bar-san-francisco)! \n\nFinally, we had the much ado-ed over fried chicken. Neither of us were impressed. How could garlic, herbs, and lemon be that inspired anyway? Has anyone tried the fried chicken slider at the Sycamore (http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-sycamore-san-francisco)?

A search on Open Table will normally yield either an incredibly early or unreasonably late time slot.  Based on that, I expected food to die for, impeccable service and an awesome interior/atmosphere.  Usually two out of three isn't bad, but not when your in the business of serving food and it's not one of the standouts.  \n\nI've dined there twice and the consensus both times was that the appetizers were the stars of the meal and the entrees merely played meager supporting roles.  The steak tartare was by far the best thing on the table.  It's too bad they removed the entree sized portion of the dish from the menu.  It is easily one of the best renditions of the classic dish found in the city and I for one wouldn't mind it as a main course.\n\nWhile the entrees were not bad, they were not particularly memorable.  On one visit, the steak frites was bland and I had to drench them in the accompanying sauce to for flavor.  One third of my meat hidden under the pile of fries and were well done instead of the medium rare that I had requested.  There was no way a single a piece of meat could be cook to two different extremes like that.  On another night, I had the Wayfare burger and it was juicy and full of flavor, but I've had similar and arguably better tasting restaurant burgers for less.  There was not really anything that made it stand out.  \n\nI will come back again but would not go out of my way or compromise to eat at an inconvenient time just to dine at Wayfare.  It's strictly a late dinner or a quite bite at the bar type of place for me until the undue hype dies down.", "author": "Wei K."}

Here is my review.\n\nAtmosphere: Tyler and his team clearly stepped away from the hip and trendy scene. Wayfare Tavern looks what it sounds like; tavern/cabin-like with hunted trophies, rustic booth, dark wood throughout the restaurant, antique lighting, regal details and art that set up a timeless scene. Overall, the vibe is quite masculine with a modern twist to a bucolic flair.\n\nSeating & the kitchen: We were seated on the main floor of the four floors, front and center with a full view of the open kitchen. Best seat in the house, though it would have been better if Tyler Florence was there that night. Although they warned me ahead of time that my request for a meet and greet may not happen since none of the staff ever knows when Ty-Flo decides to pop in, I was still hopeful. Unfortunately for me, he was not there that night, bummer.\n\nService: Service was friendly. They did not suffocate us with overt hospitality.\n\nImbibe (6 dishes between 2 people...yes I know...we're oinkers):\n\nSteak Tartar\n\nFrench mustard dressing, tobasco, shallots, capers and organic egg yolk.\n\nThis was tasty compared to most steak tartar I have had.

The only problem is that it's hard to get a lunchtime reservation because the place is pretty small. We decided to just stop in to see if we could get seated at the bar or one of the high tables - those are first-come, first-serve. We managed to find three seats at the bar. It's actually a really nice bar and I'll probably be back at some point for happy hour. The menu is small with just a few choices for appetizers, entrees and sides. Two of us got the chicken salad sandwich and one of us got the salad + macaroni and cheese side dish. The chicken salad sandwich was pretty good - at least the chicken salad was good. It was served open-faced on a very chewy and kind of burnt piece of bread. I think it was supposed to be toasted - but it was just very difficult to eat, even with a knife and fork. It was hard to cut. It came with a side of fries that were good. I tasted my friend's mac and cheese and it was just OK to me. Kind of bland and not very cheesy. Anyway, I'll probably be back to try something different - maybe the burger. A lot of people at the bar were ordering the burger, so maybe that's the thing to get.", "author": "Allie H."}

And I get to brag that I was here first. MWAHAHAHA! (cue evil laugh)\n\nFirst, where some restaurants serve you bread before the rest of your meal comes out, here they serve you popovers, and man, those things were all warm, buttery and flaky goodness!  And they just keep coming around with them and refilling your bread plate before you could even think to order more.  \n\nThen, the appetizers.  We tried their Deviled Jidori Eggs, their Half Dozen West & East Coast Oysters (a sample of their raw oysters of the day), their heirloom tomato soup, and their side of heirloom tomato.  All of them were freaking delicious!  My favorites though were the oysters and the deviled eggs.  Oh, those oysters were just calling my name!  So briny, so fresh, so good as I slurped them from their shells.  And the deviled eggs were definitely different from any that I've tried before. It was creamy, with a hint of curry, and although I know that's a rather odd-sounding combination, it actually worked.  \n\nFor our main courses, I ordered the famous fried chicken, and my dining companions ordered the lobster cobb salad, and the cowgirl ricotta ravioli.  OMG, that fried chicken was even more finger-lickin' good than the original finger-lickin' good fried chicken.  The chicken was so moist, tender and juicy that I wanted to lick not just my fingers, but my plate, too! I also tried the lobster cobb salad, and while I'm not a fan of rabbit food by any means (see my review for Mixt Greens), I will say that if I had to eat salad, that's how I want my salad to taste like.  The ravioli I didn't much care for. Maybe it was all the fried blossoms they serve it with, but there was something about the flavor that was a little off.  \n\nLastly, dessert.  And we just ordered one: the chocolate cream pie.  When I die, I want the coroner to find that chocolate cream pie was the last thing I ate.  It's that good.", "author": "Meg P."}

Had a 5:45 reservation, but got to the restaurant about 20 minutes early and they were able to seat us.  Yay!  We were seated in a very large booth.  The seating along the kitchen would be fun next time!  We were promptly greeted by a friendly server, offered still or sparkling water-we picked still.  He came back with water and a wine list.  We had a glass of wine before dinner so were trying to decide between sparkling, white or red. None of the bottles sounded familiar. Our server acted as if we were taking too long to decide. Came to the table a few times to see if we had picked one and finally gave a few suggestions (both bottles well over $100).  Not a big deal but came back quickly and said \"If you'd like something more economical here's another option\" which I found rude and degrading.  We ended up ordering the Tyler Florence Zin which was very good ($50ish) and a bottle of Red Car Rose ($50ish).  We then needed to decide on food.  We wanted to try the deviled eggs so told our server, but he said we could not place an appetizer order without our entire entree order.  So he left us to decide.  We decided to get the fried chicken, lentil soup, the burger and a side of mushrooms.  The eggs came out quickly and were one of the best deviled eggs I've had.  The yolk has a slight kick, maybe from horseradish, and the shalt on top compliments it well.  The entrees also came quickly.  The chicken was ok but not $25 worth for fried chicken.  The burger was amazing but my sister had ordered it well done and it came out definitely more like medium.  I think if you're asked how you want it cooked and it's a $20 burger it should come out correctly.  And well done isn't hard to mess up.  The lentil soup and side of mushrooms were the most impressive.  The lentil soup has small dices of peach which were unexpected but very delicious. \nWe decided to get a slice of the chocolate pie because it looked so good in the YELP photos (despite being so full!) and when the waiter brought out it was a bowl of chocolate mousse which he stated was the \"new\" chocolate pie.  Not quite sure about that and maybe he should have clarified the change from the menu.  \nOverall service was attentive and food was good.

I just wish there was some mention as to portion sizes on the menu.  On the saltier side.  Still acceptable, but salty.  Decent, but nothing I'd write home about.\n\nBroccolini - way, way, way over salted.  Nearly inedible.  They oversalted it, then added shaved salty cheese (think it was pecorino).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-04-12", "description": "I had no idea that this was a 'celebrity chef' joint until I just logged to review our experience here.  We were not greeted with a visit to our table, and maybe that's because of having to send 2 entrees back.....but I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nVery cool interior and vibe.  I was here for a party some time ago (which I barely remember, it was the 3rd leg of a day at North Beach Festival), but knew even then that I dug what they were going for.  The rustic, turn of the 20th century tavern look is really, really cool.  And it matches what they serve food-wise.  \n\nGreat service I thought.  From the hostess to our server, very friendly and attentive.  \n\nThe food.  \n\nWe went with what our server affectionately called the \"heart-stopper\", as it was so full of heavy meat oriented dishes.  All the items were recommended, so we said let's do it, we can clean the clogs out of our arteries later.\n\nThe apps had some interesting choices.  The Steak Tartare was good, though I've had better.  The Bone Marrow app was really fantastic.  The bone has to come from a dinosaur or something because it was massive.  It was pure meat lovers decadence to smear it on the bread and fatten myself up.  I thought my buddy was going to pick it up and start chewing on it (and probably would have if we weren't in the presence of the ladies).  Great start, right?  From there it veered off course (pun intended).\n\nThe other recommended app was the Poutine.  Apparently a Canadian dish, it consists of french fries, cheese, braised short rib and a truffle gravy/sauce.  I mean the description may just sound like a piece of dirtball heaven, but the dish itself.....meh.  It just wasn't good.  For one it was pretty d*mn cold (maybe a fresh one would have been better), and just not good.  Soggy fries, with meat and gravy on it just don't do it for me.  (See Canada, you can't even take a surefire dish like this and make it good!)\n\nThe entrees were a mess as well.  Though I liked my fried chicken, I was really the only one at the table who liked their entree at all.  2 people ordered the duck gumbo, and it was not only bland and uninspired, but the duck was literally raw.  I'm not a guy who sends things back normally, even if I hate a dish overall, but if something is raw like this duck, you just have to.  The server looked at it mortified and took them away.  Again the service was great, someone immediately came out to ask if they could do it again, or make something else, but we politely declined.  There was also a salmon dish at the table which was just mediocre at best.\n\nOverall not great.  They were really nice about the duck gumbo and took both off the bill, and even comp'd a final round of wine in apology (again, great service).  I just don't think I could give it another shot based on how bad some of the dishes were (bad is one thing, inedible is another).", "author": "Andrew M."}

Really.\n\nI wanted to love Wayfare Tavern.  \n\nThe decor is sexy and dark and feels like Old San Francisco mixed with two parts mystery movie and one part gastropub.  \n\nThe drink menu is artfully crafted and skillfully prepared and if you order two or three then I guess the food doesn't matter to you.  But here's the issue, I never order two or three and food is dreadfully, unappealingly important to me, and everything after the drinks and delicious complimentary pop overs at Wayfare was a disappointment.\n\nI should preface this with telling you that Chef Florence was not there the night we were....\n\nThe appetizers were alright.  Dates wrapped in bacon were tasty, but with that said, you could wrap a piece of big rig tire from the side of Hwy 5. in bacon and I would happily ingest it, compliment you on your fine culinary prowess and ingenuity and ask for another.\n\nI ordered the fried chicken, because if you haven't picked this up from my 300 plus reviews, I like bacon and I like fried food, and if either are on the menu then you know what I am eating, please and thank you.\n\nSadly, my poor little fried chicken was soggy.  The chicken was juicy, but the skin wasn't crisp and could have used about 4 more minutes in it's lovely hot fat bath.\n\nB's tuna steak was ridiculously dreadful.  It was so sinewy and hard to cut/chew that halfway through I looked over and saw him sweating his way through it.  \n\nA trip to a culinary master's restaurant, like Florence's, should not be an episode of Man V. Food.\n\nSadly, Food won.  And we all were conquered by its mediocrity and its price.  \n\nDessert , fortunately, was a bright little northern star of hope.  A Walnut Tart that I would easily eat five more of and left us all feeling a little sweeter than our entrees had left us.\n\nSo...I like Chef Florence.  I admire Chef Florence.  And in general, I think Chef Florence is a heck of a guy, but unfortunately my birthday dinner at Wayfare left me feeling that maybe if Chef Florence isn't actually cooking my food, then there is only one reason to visit his establishment and it's his pastry chef.\n\nCall me!

The brining and buttermilk clearly made a difference. My friend had the Irish stew and it too was tasty. The lamb was fresh and really tender. The stew wasn't soupy -- it was more of a rich roast of lamb and veg. Other items from the kitchen also looked great -- the bone marrow, the pork chop.

The perfect blend of sauce created a cheese to pasta ratio that trumps the cheese-holding ability of the average elbow! A little too heavy for me though, and the oil separated from the cheese to create small pools of grease that kind of killed my appetite for this dish.\n\nBrussel sprouts were delicious- coated in light layer of honey mustard-based sauce with generous thick chunks of well-seasoned bacon. \n\nChicken was yummy and well seasoned with rosemary and thyme cooked under the chicken skin but didn't wow me enough considering the hype. Legs and thighs were actually quite small (albeit no mention that this was due to them being natural birds..).\n\nPumpkin pudding dessert, as recommended by our waitress, was sublime.

The bone marrow appetizer was beautifully presented and the Mac n' Cheese is what every 6, or in this case, 26 year old dreams of.\n\nThe pot roast was tender, succulent, and gently broke apart as my fork ran through it -- perfectly cooked and executed. When I burped 6 hours later, the taste of pot roast ever so gently danced past my tongue which was a delightful yet disgusting reminder of how good dinner was and how many calories my glutton ass needed to burn thereafter. The Organic Fried Chicken reminded me a lot of Thomas Keller's Buttermilk Fried Chicken (http://www.seductionmeals.com/2010/03/thomas-kellers-buttermilk-frie.html). There's something in that chicken that turned my Indian/Persian boyfriend into a black man for half an hour. I would try to have a conversation with him but he would just give me one word answers like I was trying to take him away from his chicken. Go on witcha' bad self, babe. I was enjoying my pot roast.\n\nAfter the main course I asked our waiter if he had a forklift because that's what it was going to take to get me outta the restaurant. Even though I was already full, passing up dessert would be shameful. The apple cider ice cream atop the Apple Cobbler was uh-mazing. I would eat a whole bowl of that ice cream by itself if they'd let me. My boyfriend had to use the bathroom but he didn't want to get up because he was afraid everyone would see his cheesecake boner. I grabbed my fork, took a bite and what do you know, the two of us just started a secret sword fight under the table because I too had a boner.\n\nOur adorable waiter was flawless that night and as we did the walk of shame down the stairs upon leaving we saw a glimpse of Tyler Florence in the open kitchen tasting the food making sure everything was up to his standards. It made me smile because after my experience, I can say with confidence that Wayfare Tavern will be around for a long time.", "author": "Jen Y."}

I was mesmerized by your broad shoulders, your attractive smile and your big hand that devoured mine when we shook in introduction. I almost died a happy chick. --- \n\nHad Christmas dinner with the girls last Sunday, and I must say, it was a great choice to have our dinner at Wayfare! They gave us a private dining room that is secluded from the other patrons- catch this - with no minimum or additional charges! Very rare will you find a restaurant that will accommodate you for free. Vivian D. beat me to it with the review so this will be a bit of a repeat if you had already read hers. \n\nAnyways, back to the review. Food was exquisite! To be honest, I heard from others that the food here is just average but I was very impressed with the dishes that were served at our table. \n\nFor starter: \n-Complimentary popovers \n-Steak Tartare marinated in a mustard dressing, Tabasco, capers, shallots, and egg yolks. \n\nDELICIOUS! If the meat (any meat or fish) is raw and edible, then it is MY kind of food! \n\nFor entrees: \n-Tomales Bay Mussels: cooked in a salt pork chowder, herbs, vegetables and smoked chili oil. \n-Organic Fried Chicken seasoned in herbs, garlic crisps, and lemon \n-Braised Beef Short Ribs served with potato puree and drizzled with black pepper cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and topped with pear, truffle and celery. \n-Sonoma Pork Belly cooked with beluga lentils, candied rutabaga, thyme and served with salt and vinegar potato chips. \n-Roasted Liberty Farms Duck Hunter's Style prepared with a red wine sauce and topped with bacon lardon, prunes, onions and parsnip puree. \n-Grilled Hawaiian Tuna served with roasted cauliflower, figs, olives, arugula and smoked chili oil. \n\nNothing was disappointing at all! My favorites were the pork belly and the fried chicken. Pork belly was soft and flavorful while the fried chicken was crispy, juicy and tender! \n\nFor desserts: \n-Tolan's Carrot Cake served in a spiced syrup and coriander. \n-Sticky Toffee Pudding served with roasted pears and black pepper ice cream. \n\nOur winning sweet dish was the sticky toffee pudding. We couldn't stop digging our spoons into it! \n\nWe ended the evening with gifts. Our waitress was very attentive, she came in a lot of check on us and even cleaned up our table to allow us to have more space for us to open our gifts. \n\n4 stars for the dining experience!", "author": "Jenny K."}

I made the reservation a month in advance just to be sure we got a table on time, but the place wasn't even that crowded at 5:30 on that Saturday. Everyone was super friendly, telling us we looked stunning and to have a good time at the prom. We were seated upstairs; the atmosphere is great, the theme is unique, everything looked perfect. We had been studying the menu for a month and knew exactly what we were getting before we even walked in the door. My girlfriend ordered the burger plus the egg, and I ordered the notorious fried chicken. The bread that came while we were waiting was great. It was nice and flaky and tasted delicious, you could taste the egg so you know it was made fresh at the restaurant.  The food came at a reasonable pace. The presentation was superb for both of our dishes. As for taste, I haven't tasted anything like this fried chicken. It was tremendous! You could taste all of the herbs but they weren't distracting form the tender and juicy chicken. My girlfriend loved her burger as well. I tried some of the patty and it was great. She described it as, \"flavors I've never tasted on a burger before.\" As much as we wanted dessert, we didn't want to be dead on the dance floor at prom so we skipped, but we both vow to come back and try different items on the menu and hopefully some dessert.", "author": "Jeffrey A."}

It was more creamy and less cheesey than others, but not in a bad way at all. It felt very much like I was eating a gratin with macaroni.

My water glass was constantly refilled.  \n\nWe split two entrees and two desserts. \n\nFried Chicken: After reading all the hype on Yelp I was excited to try the chicken but it didn't live up.  The portion size was pretty big, but the flavor was a little too subtle for me.  I could taste the thyme but I think the batter the chicken was dipped in could have used more seasoning.  The white meat was also dry which was really disappointing.\n\nButcher's Filet:  This dish came with a \"bone marrow bordelaise,\" which I'm guessing is why this \"filet\" was served as three small pieces of meat that were supposed to mimic pieces of bone marrow.  We ordered it medium rare but it came out heavily seared on the outside and medium to medium plus on the inside depending on which piece you were eating (probably because the meat was served as 3 small odd shaped pieces).  The bordelaise sauce was good but there was some other sauce that basically tasted like fresh herbs mixed with mayo that i found clashed with the rest of the dish.   \n\nCoconut Panna Cotta:  I think there was way too much going on in this dessert.  I probably should have read the rest of the description better; \"chai ice, coconut candy, mango pearls, mint, lemongrass.\"  I think the chai ice was what i thought was some sweet sauce over the dessert.  The mango pearls turned out to be some mango puree/gel with tapioca in it and the sourness in the mango seemed to overpower the whole dish.  (This was probably fresh mango but I guess it wasn't a very good mango.)  I liked the coconut candy. The mint and young lemon grass went ok.  There were just so many things on the panna cotta all I wanted was the panna cotta by itself.  I also expected the panna cotta to be deeper, instead of just a thin coating on the bottom on the dish it was served in.   \n\nSmoked Honey Cheesecake:  I would describe the way this dessert is served as pompous.  It is served in a glass cheese dome filled with smoke.  The dome is removed by the waiter when served, and the smoke floats out everywhere.  I just didn't get this dessert. The first bite of cheesecake tasted like smoke but the second tasted more like cheesecake.  The honey donut was ok.  I didn't really enjoy the smoky flavor.  \n\nAll the food looked pretty but I judge restaurants on taste.  For $25-30 per entree and abotu $10 a dessert I expected more.

It's not a very big place, the upstairs is pretty cozy and loud.

There was 4 of us so we shared everything. I didn't care too much for the poutine. The deviled eggs were good, but nothing really worth mentioning. For the entrees we got the fried chicken ($22), short ribs ($27), chicken paillard ($20) and the seared salmon ($27). Out of all the dishes, the fried chicken was the best...both in taste and portion size. Everything else was just ok. We did share a side of mac n cheese ($8) and that was delicious! For dessert we shared the fried apple pie with sage ice cream.  The ice cream was a little weird for me (but I'm a vanilla kind of girl) and the fried apple pie was nothing special either.\n\nService here was fantastic and very friendly!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-19", "description": "I confess we came to the Wayfare Tavern somewhat defiantly -- it is one of the hottest restaurants in the city, but we were never big fans of \"American\" food. And while I am a certified chef groupie (even going so far as Toronto because I fell in love with Susur Lee's ponytail), I've somehow completely missed Tyler Florence. Don't know who he is, what he looks like, or what he cooks.\n\nSo after waiting for few weeks for a reservation, we definitely showed up with a \"show-me\" attitude. And, boy, did the restaurant deliver!\n\nI started with the tuna/fried oyster. Interesting and unusual combo that was really delicious with the 3 sauces. My husband had the bone marrow which he loved. Of course, we had the starters with the popovers, which were as incredible as everyone had written about.\n\nFor the entree we decided to share the fried chicken and the mash potatoes with truffle gravy. The portion was huge as advertised, and it is now by far my favorite fried chicken in the city! Perfectly crispy coating, moist and flavorful chicken. Not at all greasy. I've never had fried chicken that was so herby/lemony yet still perfectly traditional. The mashed potatoes were a surprise -- infused with truffle flavor and a perfect combo with the chicken.\n\nAs good as the starters and entrees were, the desserts were even better. My husband's sticky toffee pudding was good, but the pineapple upside down cake was heaven. They de-pan it table side, and the buttery cake was topped by a wonderful caramel. So delicious with the coconut ice cream. I'm always in search of good cake, and am sure we'll be stopping in many evenings just to have cake!\n\nThe much written about space was nice, but much smaller than I expected. We sat at the table right in front of the fireplace, and it was fun to see the action in the kitchen. No wonder it's hard to get in -- there are hardly any tables. The bar area was unpleasantly packed on a rainy Friday night. Can all you people stop coming so we can enjoy it more? Trust me, it's really not that good... no really, not good at all... stay home, don't come....\n\nWine list was well-selected mostly featuring the west coast bottles (California, Oregon). Mark up was reasonable. With all of our recent adventures with awesome Italian and French vintages, it seemed a bit mundane, but there are lovely wines on the list and it goes well with the theme of the restaurant.\n\nMy only quibble was with the pacing. We had to wait quite a while before we were served with cocktails. The popover guy walked the floor but ran out before he got to our table, so we had to watch longingly as other diners moaned with happiness over theirs. Our chicken came as soon as the starter dishes were cleared, and a bit of a breather to enjoy our wine would have been appreciated.\n\nBut these are small issues for a newish restaurants that's crushed by volume. The food is absolutely delicious. I'm sure this will be a SF staple for years to come.", "author": "Judy D."}

It does take a lot to be on that list - great location, excellent service, nice atmosphere, but most importantly the food! \n\nWayfare Tavern is comfort food taken to another level, but still manages to provide large portions to keep your stomach satisfied.  Both the cocktail list and raw bar also worth checking out.  A couple of must order items - the Fried Chicken (buttermilk brine) and The Bone (best bone marrow presentation in SF).

Nothing sounds super inventive but I kept on hearing good things about Wayfare Tavern.  Maybe they are just really good at making the classic dishes. \n\nAfter four of us seated, they brought us some warm popovers.  That instantly won me over.  They were these little brioche-like buttery cups perfect to smother creamy butter all over.  I was ecstatic when they asked if I wanted another.  You mean, I can have more than one of those, for free?  Yes, sometimes I am incredibly easy to please.\n\nFor appetizer, we shared the Poutine.  The fries and braised short ribs were really tasty.  They were especially satisfying when you are hungry---in other words, they are delicious because they are so fatty and rich.\n\nI ordered the pot roast for entree, lured by the description of \"48 hours\" short ribs.  48 hours?  must be super tender.  And it was.  I didn't need a knife to cut through the meat.  And it came with perfectly done mashed potatoes.  \n\nMy friends had the burger which they loved.  The duck gumbo was tasty and came with a bit of a kick.  The steak tartar was good.  Mac and cheese was very delicious, even though I am always hesitant to order something that I can make at home at a high-end restaurant.  The only disappointment was the fried chicken.  I can't believe it was their most popular dish.  The chicken was really dry and bland.  Maybe we just got the off dish.\n\nWe were enormously full by the time we worked through part of our entrees.  So no dessert for us.  But we did get complimentary gingerbread cookies.  And they were warm!  What a nice way to end a good meal. \n\nIt's not a cheap restaurant, but they do the classic dishes so well that you can't really go wrong taking anyone here.", "author": "Candice B."}

The service was excellent at the \"Chefs Counter\" and the food was also good, but overall felt each dish was quite heavy, and I would've enjoyed some lighter options to counter the bulk. \n\nIn summary...\n\nPopovers - Very \"eggy\" but light\n\nDeviled Eggs - Favorite dish we had, the dijon and crunchy topping really made the dish shine.  Park Tavern's zing still wins my top vote, but this was a close 2nd.\n\nBrussel Sprouts - I LOVE b.sprouts, and the grainy mustard was a really smart choice, however the butter and heaviness from the pork/bacon really overpowered it for me.  I wish it was just the mustard and perhaps crispy bacon versus the overload of oil/fat that really left me feeling guilty consuming this usually quite \"healthy\" option. \n\nMussels - Each mussel seemed pre-stuffed w/ every little aspect of the dish for a scrumptious bite (delicious)!  However ultimately, i felt the cream base was heavy as well, when i was hoping for a light refreshing way to mix the meal up. \n\nFried Chicken -  As you must know by now, the fried chicken is a favorite here at Wayfare, really herby and well-cooked.  Definitely the 2nd favorite dish of the night.\n\nOverall, each individual dish was quite delightful, and really had a punch of flavor, but combined, felt the overall meal was a little too heavy and could use some added lightness to counter the \"fat\" of some of the favorites on the menu.", "author": "Renae K."}

We weren't seated right away so we grabbed drinks at the bar and it didn't take too long before we were seated. We were at a small table right by the stairs on the second floor in a busy thoroughfare. I wish we could have had a slightly less crowded/busy table but it looked like a packed house so I guess someone has to sit where we did. But literally a few times a minute, someone is walking by you. The upside being that other diners were not right next to us so we didn't have to hear other conversations. There was a also a nice Happy Anniversary card on the table waiting for us.  Nice touch.\n\nPopovers, delicious, as we all know. It was hard not to want a second one but we had a big meal ahead of us. I will say this place has inspired me to get a popover pan soon, so I can try and make them myself.\n\nWe ordered:\n-Caesar Salad to split - Huge, definitely glad we split it. Pretty tasty. I liked that they were larger leafy greens without being giant 8 inch spears of romaine.\n\n-Kobe Tartare - Mmmmm, my favorite thing we ordered. The tartare melted in your mouth and was nicely seasoned AND they serve them on pieces of garlic popovers! Just when I thought I was being good about not getting more popovers. The portion is pretty huge. For 2 people, it was generous, though I think we basically polished it off. Could easily serve 4 or more with smaller portions.\n\n-Burger - I didn't order this one but I'd say it's a pretty solid burger. Pretty good, but, for $20 I was hoping it would be phenomenal. This town has some banging burgers for  a better price (usually still like $15 but you really taste the premium your paying with these other burgers). This one just felt like, \"alright I'm paying $20 for a pretty good burger.\" Nicely cooked, ordered medium and was pink throughout which was good.\n\n-Fried Chicken - Tasty and I can see why so many people like it, but, I think it's just a personal preference of mine to have nice thick and crispy skin on my fried chicken with a little more Oomph. The skin on the chicken is seasoned nicely but it's just a little too thin for me to recommend this whole-heartedly. The rosemary is a nice addition, but this felt like Fried Chicken Lite to me and when I order Fried Chicken, it's not for health reasons. Meat was pretty juicy, so good on them for that. I'm not a white meat person and the white meat was tender.\n\n-Mac n Cheese - Again, decent and pretty good mac n cheese but not the best I've ever had.\n\n- Doughnuts - Oooh these doughnuts were heaven. They came warm and with 3 different dipping sauces strawberry jam, lemon curd and salted caramel. Really delectable. Took some home for the next morning.\n\nCocktails - I had the Gin Mule which is served in the traditional copper mug and it was delicious. I don't like things that are too sweet, but this was a perfect light and refreshing cocktail. Hubby ordered the Tavern Sour which was also really on point. I only had a sip of it but it was nice.\n\nService was just slightly hit or miss, but again about 4 stars. Definitely a more fine dining experience so the service felt more attentive than any old place but it was a little inconsistent. The timing of the courses was a little random but fine. We asked someone for a  new fork because we dropped one and had to ask another person because we're not sure what happened with the first person. Water came by maybe once or twice the entire meal. But everything else was well orchestrated. They've got the person bringing you new silverware after each course, the popover guy, the guy to cleanup all your popover crumbs =), server etc. Our waiter, however, was very generous with us at the end of the meal as we let him know our drinks from the bar weren't on the tab, so he refilled our after-dinner drink.\n\nAll of the food was very solid. Best ever? Maybe not, but pretty good and the sum of having a lot of good food and nicer-than-average service was a really lovely dining experience.\n\nI would recommend this place and will go again. Might be a nice place to bring parents.", "author": "Karen J."}

But alas, the jolly, rotund boy within was a bit heartbroken...\n\nAll in all there was nothing spectacular especially considering this restaurant was opened by a famous Food Network Chef and our new Bay Area neighbor. And maybe it's that same celebrity status that warrants the higher premiums. As for how it all went down, it was just too heavy and fatty. And those that know me know that I live for heavy and fatty. For (enter your spiritual being)'s sake, I once used a romaine leaf to wipe up the fat and meat juices off an iron skillet. Oh, what did I do with it? I ate it of course. I digress.\n\nHere's the run down... hopefully short and sweet... to combat the heavy and fatty...\n\nThe Bone - Big bone, lots of marrow, topped with Panko instead of being served with bread, not big on flavor. Flavor muted by breadcrumbs? The sauce below the bone was the highlight. Meaty and  full of flavor. Used my popover to wipe up the plate (see popover below).\n\nSteak Tartare - Standard. \n\nAngels on Horseback - Standard.\n\nPopover - Fluffy and flaky. Yum, we each had 2+. A grand total of 8 between 3 people.\n\nFried Chicken - Meat was Soft and Dry. Great as a women's deodorant, not good for chicken.\n\nPork Belly - Sear gave a sweet balance to the fat. Not heavy considering it's pork belly. Nice touch with the lentils, great textural contrast.\n\nBraised Short Rib - Meaty goodness, tender, hint of truffle oil. Everyone's favorite.\n\nMac 'n Cheese - Overly salty. I hear it's usually great, but the salt killed it for all of us. Very low on my Bay Area mac 'n cheese totem pole. I might give it another chance since I hear good things about it.\n\nBrussel Sprouts - Drenched in dijon from the braise. No respect for the sprout!\n\nSavoy Cabbage - Drenched in butter and fat from the braise. Good, but surprising heavy for a plate of cabbage with bits of bacon. \n\nFried Apple Pie - The old McDonald's Fried Apple Pie meets the Food Network. That's what I call McDreamy.\n\nI suppose Wayfare's worth a try, but don't rush to get there.

We guessed that it was going to be either really good, or really bad. So on the safe side, just so all was not a loss if the play was a flop, we decided to try out a much talked about restaurant - Tyler Florence's, Wayfare Tavern.\n\nFriday was one of those beautiful, sunny, warm February days around the Bay. I jumped on a high speed boat, dressed all in various shades of purple and pink with my oversized Italian sunglasses and raced across the choppy cool waters of our beloved sea port; I zigzagged under the Bay Bridge before docking at the Ferry Building marina. I walked through a metropolis of business workers ready to start a weekend of unbridled mayhem. The entire financial district buzzed with excitement. Ahhh, I remember the days of working on Montgomery at the turn of the century, when lunch consisted of Martinis and oysters, and Friday at 5:00 PM meant party time.\n\nI made my way to the front doors at the place where Rubicon once made its home. Two hot potatoes in uniforms opened the doors for me. I like it already. I smiled at the hostess and provided Mr. Fusspot's name for our reservation. She looked puzzled and a bit distress and told me that there was no reservation. A few moments later a Rhett Butler looking gentleman sauntered down a long staircase, while smiling he said, yes Mr. Blade, Mr. Fusspot, your dining partner is waiting for you upstairs - we are ready for you. I was lead to an intimate table for two. I smacked Fussy on his supple lips and ordered a cocktail from Rhett at the same time. \n\nIn keeping with the theme of our theatre performance, Fussy was dressed in army fatigues and a Red Cross baseball cap. I laughed every time his dog tags jingled when he sneezed. \n\nTyler came to our table and asked,  \"what do you two pretty boys want to eat?\" We asked, \"what'd ya got?\" Tyler winked and walked towards the kitchen. Hot popovers hit our bread plates. They were puffy, light and bright. Three types of oysters on the half-shell covered our table as well as some roasted beets with an array of little bits and bling. Delicious. I checked out my surroundings, and loved the antlers on the walls, the pewter dishes on the old-like wooden tables and the giant floral displays that adorned the dark and masculine room. It felt like an upscale Elks Lodge but decorated by men with taste.\n\nTyler then sent out some wonderful salmon that was picture perfect, along with some good old fashioned steak and frits. Dinner was just delightful and I do look forward to my next visit. Upon my return, I think I want to try the downstairs dining room with a group of friends. Upstairs is a bit more quiet and intimate, downstairs is noisier and great for people watching. Both areas have a great vibe but in different ways. \n\nWe jumped on Fussy's Harley, went shoe shopping (Fussy could not resist,) and made it to the theater with time to spare. The play was unusual and entertaining enough to entice us to stay for the entire performance. Hopefully, if there ever is an apocalyptic disaster, the Wayfare Tavern, Tyler and his staff will survive so that a lineage of spectacular farm to table food could and would continue. By the way only Fussy can carry off wearing army fatigues and Prada at the same time; amateurs should not attempt doing this on their own.", "author": "Blade L."}

We got lucky and 2 seats opened up at the upstairs bar shortly after we arrived. \n\nNow, when it comes to preferred restaurants, I am more a fan of the ambiance and service than the food. No... wait, maybe I wouldn't go quite that far, but Id rather go to a place with good food and great service than great food and crap service. It just makes the experience.\n\nThe service I received at Wayfare has by far been the best I have ever experienced. On my first trip I was obsessed with my waiter's speech. In my opinion he has the greatest voice, I recall telling him this, as well as noting that he was very \"culturally ambiguous.\" I saw him tonight, well actually I heard him first. Months later, he not only remembered me and the conversation we had, but the table we sat at. Priceless. \n\nOur bartender for the evening was Chris, he was similarly culturally ambiguous and completed our night with his pleasant and persuasive (without seeming to be) personality. \n\nThe food: comfort food with an elegant twist. Decadent, fried chicken that melts in your mouth... complete with the perfect herbs. For dessert, Sticky Toffee Bread Pudding. It comes with black pepper ice cream and roasted pear. Our bartender Chris and I were talking throughout the evening about how tonight was my preparation for birthday celebrations this weekend. He was convinced it was close enough to the actual day to start celebrations. He treated us to a fantastic glass of champagne, and when the dessert came out it was lit up with a birthday candle and \"Happy Birthday\" was scrolled beautifully in chocolate across the plate. It was quite the surprise. \n\nI couldn't be happier with my decision to end up here tonight, and after a second memorable experience, it was well deserving a yelp review!", "author": "Hailey P."}

We had an early reservation, but the dining area was already filled, so I took that as a good sign.\n\nOnto the food. We started off with the Bone Marrow and Uni Toast appetizers. Then I got the Duck Gumbo and my gf got the Fried Chicken for our entrees.\n\nI was surprised at how greasy the Bone Marrow dish was. It came with bruschetta-like bread and various greens. The bone marrow itself had a rich, buttery texture, but not that much flavor going for it otherwise. I probably could do without.\n\nNext was the Uni Toast. To be honest, I don't like sea urchin - I'm just not a fan of the aftertaste. My gf likes it so she was pretty excited to try this dish, and while I was willing to accommodate, I was fully expecting to take one bite just to try it, then pass her the rest. \n\nWhen it came out, it had slivers of raw button mushroom and a raw radish on top. Not exactly winning me over here. But unlike the plain uni I was used to, this was seasoned with a little citrus, salt and pepper on top of that brioche toast and VOILA! I threw all my notions about uni aside. And the raw veggies really added a nice sweet, mellowing quality that counteracted the aftertaste of urchin that I usually don't like. \n\nMy Duck Gumbo came with a lot of okra in it (yeah!), and the rice went really well with the spicy flavors of the dish. The pieces of sausage were perfect - it's so tender you can literally spread it on your toast.\n\nThe Organic Fried Chicken was cooked perfectly. Crispy and tender, it's probably juicier than a Chicken McNugget. But I have to say, it's very herby with lots of rosemary, thyme, and sage. It's cool for one piece, but after that I kinda just want the traditional savory/salty fried chicken.\n\nFinally for dessert, we ordered the Gooseberry Cheescake. Our waitress recommended it, and noted that it had the goat cheese funk. We tried it and she was right, there was that goat funkiness, but it's not overbearing at all. Best cheesecake I've had in a long time.\n\nThe staff here was excellent. All servers was friendly, our iced tea was refreshed regularly, and the guy with the Pop-overs kept offering us more even without us requesting it. There even added a nice extra touch onto our dessert plate .

Great value considering how much food you're receiving.  I would give it a near 5 stars however I was a little disappointed in our server.  He was a bit arrogant and not very friendly...thus I knock down one star.  The hostess', on the other hand, were fabulous and very sweet!   I'll be back again next week with a girlfriend.

Tyler Florence was there and a few of my friends took a picture with him, so I'd like to believe he is a nice guy for doing that on such a busy day.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful, seriously the bathrooms are awesome. I felt like I was in a charming old movie.\n\nWe were seated outside since we were such a large group. They put the heat-lamps on as well as provided blankets for those who still felt a chill. \n\nFood: We got popovers with whipped butter which were especially delicious (unless you don't like that egg-y taste). I shared the organic fried chicken. It wasn't out of this world, but that might be my opinion because I don't like to eat meat with bones in them as I don't like the texture. It was quite crispy though and the portions were generous. The mashed potatoes were like silk! absolutely delish. They had a bunch of custom cocktails and interesting beers on their list. \n\nService: Our waitress/hostess was a bit clumsy. She would clink the glasses together and just made some unnecessary commotion during our dinner. A friend of mine had to order bread for his bone marrow dish like 5 times so I was a bit disappointed with that. When they did finally heed his request, the bread came right out of the oven and onto his place. Not bad.\n\nThis place def has charm.

But hey, we loved it as it gave us alot of privacy to enjoy ourselves plus we didn't have to fight over the other patron's chatter. \n\nOur waiter, Jason was extremely awesome. He joked and engaged in our conversations and was very helpful when it came to serving us. We ordered a bunch of appetizers of escargot, poutine, steak tartare, dates and wrapped in bacon. \n\nEveryone loved the escargo, No complaints whatsoever. We also loved the steak tartar. I personally enjoyed the dates wrapped in bacon, but others thought it was a bit too sweet for their palette. Poutine, which in my mind was souped up carne asada fries was good. It is the same meat as the pot roast so if you are indecisive about your entree and want to try everything as much as you can, you can try a snippet of the pot roast through this appetizer. \n\nFor entree's, I ordered the pot roast and it was REALLY good!!! I loved it so much and just thinking about it right now makes me drool. The fried chicken was good. Good batter and chicken was still juicy. Others ordered the halibut which also received good oohs and ahhs too! \n\nNow for dessert, we ordered the upside pineapple cake which is Tyler's signature dessert. The employee staff's favorite is the sticky toffee pudding. If you are a fan of ginger, this may be the dish for you as it is served alone ginger ice cream. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of ginger, so I didn't really care for the pairing. The sticky toffee was good though. Very flavorfull. The steam lime pudding was a really refreshing after eating a right meal. \n\nIt's a good restaurant for what it's worth.

It was a thank you from a co-worker and the thanks came in the form of three courses of ridiculously good food. Celebrity Chef Tyler Florence is the mastermind behind this \"man cave\", and I must say he did an amazing job. I'd like to gush on about the decor, service, and what not, but I'm a-gonna skip right the good stuff.\n\nFirst course brought to the table a lovely tray of the most smooth and delicious smelling deviled eggs I have ever locked eyes with. Just the slightest garnish of capers, anchovy and celery really made the flavor of the egg creamy and flavorful. Also in the first course we had Local Mushroom Soup with creme fraise, crispy brussel leaves and rye.\n\nSecond course was an amazing salad that did not get captured on film, but did give me the idea that a unique way to present a salad is using orange zest, olive oil and mustard seed to make a dressing which you place on the plate. THEN add the greens, this particular salad had shaved parmi and pomegranate seeds. Never overdressed, but super flavorful.\n\nThe real star of the meal though was the highly recommended Wayfare Burger \"Le Grande\". This was the first time I have ever had a fried egg on a burger or really on anything and it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!! I don't usually eat bacon, but to honor the burger I went for it and with the egg and high, high, high quality, well-cooked and perfectly seasoned meat, it was beyond words.\n\nNext time you are in the mood to have your mind blown and want to spend $20 on a burger, now you know where to go.\nDessert was Fried Apple Pie with Sage Ice Cream.\nGo ahead, take a minute to think about all that.", "author": "Erica E."}

He's in the kitchen, doing what important chefs do back there, consulting, supervising, looking all celeb-fabulous.  Deal sealed; I'm gonna wait me out a table.\n\nWe got two seats at the bar only after about 10 minutes of gawking at Tyler.  Good golly, that was fun. :)  Honestly, the excitement of tasting the food of a favorite chef that you only have seen on TV and getting to really know the flavor profile of his food heightened the experience tremendously.  And, yes, I do perpetuate this whole crazy phenomenon of food celebrity-dom (oh, and food pornography).  I can't help it.  It's fascinating and my tummy gets happy.\n\nTOMALES BAY MUSSELS: in a pork chowder.  The chowder is thin but full in flavor, sprinkled with little chunks of what tasted to me like ham hock. Sweet potatoes in it are just a little bit divine, what can I say?\n\n[We requested bread - out came Tyler's popovers.  It's just perfect, fluffy where it counts, doughy where it should be and even flaky on the crust.  Better than the Rotunda, if I dare say.]\n\nWAYFARE BURGER: smoked bacon, mt. tam cheese, red onions, on brioche bread.  It was a great-tasting burger, no doubt about that, but if I came back, I don't know that it would be a repeater for me.\n\nFRIED CHICKEN: lemon, flash-fried rosemary (and thyme?), roasted garlic. Sprinkle that lemon and slather the roasted garlic onto the most moist piece of white meat you have ever had in your life!  In addition to the amazing flavor combination these ingredients yield, the skin/breading is light but crispy and PERFECTLY seasoned.  I love fried chicken and this is currently the best fried chicken on my list.  I will honestly come back just for this.  In fact, I think I'll dream about it tonight.\n\nMAC N CHEESE: jack cheese, garlic breadcrumbs, chive and smoked olive oil.  I must confess; I don't generally like gourmet mac n cheese.  Give me some Kraft mac n cheese and I'm cheddar cheesily happy.  However, this could be the exception - first bite of mac n cheese was heavenly.  I do have to say, though, that when the cheese hardens b/c you haven't had time to eat it all yet b/c you're too busy licking your fingers from the fried chicken. . . the mac n cheese just loses its luster unfortunately.\n\nAll in all, I was fully satisfied and overwhelmingly happy.  It was definitely the best meal I had in a long time.", "author": "erika n."}

The only reservation I was able to get was at 5pm... and we somehow managed to get there early, but we were seated right away at 445!   We had already studied the menu and yelp reviews (LOL) prior to coming and already had in mind what we wanted to eat... with a few extra things that we we wished were still on the menu from the summer menu!  \n\nWe started off devouring our popovers.  I had seen an episode of \"Best Thing I Ever Ate\" and saw that one of Tyler's fave things was a popover, so thought it was cute that he used popovers for his restaurant.  We ended up with the Steak Tartare, Poutine, Fried Chicken, Le Grande Burger, and Mac and Cheese.  Everything was so good, it's hard for me to choose my favorite thing of the night.  The steak tartare was so fresh and delicious, now I know why Michael Bauer named it one of the top 6 in the Bay Area.  The poutine was super delicious with the braised short rib and the yummy cheeses.  The fried chicken was so flavorful with every bite and you get a BIG portion of it.  The burger was soooo thick and juicy and it had my fave mt tam triple cream on the tastiest brioche bun. (On another episode of \"BTIEA\", Tyler's fave grilled cheese was from a Muir Woods cafe inside the Redwood Forest and they used the Mt Tam on their grilled cheese, so I wonder if he got this idea from that too.) The mac and cheese was soooo creamy and cheesy!  We were super stuffed and couldn't finish what we ordered which was basically only two appetizers and two entrees and a side between the three of us.  We actually said no to dessert.  \n\nThe service is very friendly but what makes me stop from giving the 5th star is that they were a little forgetful or hard of hearing... they walked away in the middle of my friend asking a question... and never brought my husband his popover after they had offered... and forgot to bring a beer/cocktail menu after the hubbo had asked what beers they had on tap and didn't even ask the rest of us if we wanted drinks....  but those things would definitely not stop me from coming back!

This was the only food they had in common in the preceding week+.  Having worked in the food service industry, (executive chef), I am positive it was the chicken.  Shame on you Tyler Florence.  \nI would not recommend this restaurant for the following reasons.\n1.  Sanitation is suspect.\n2.  Prices are based on celebrity chef stardom and not quality or originality.\n3.  Lack of value for the $ spent.\n4.  NOISE level, probably around 20db.\n\nOne nice thing I failed to mention is, your doggy \"bag\" is taken away from the table and nicely packed and held for you at the reception and you are given a coat check to pick up when you leave.\nBTW:  The service is very good and the staff are all very pleasant.", "author": "Charles O."}

I so wanted to give it at least 4 stars, but there were too many screw ups with service and some food items. The food is awesome, but the kinks marred the experience.\n\nWe had reservations for a late lunch, but the restaurant was still very busy. We were seated quickly and then it seems like we were forgotten. Were they so short staffed that day that our primary server was the bartender? The waiter at the next section tried to help and cover, but he was very harried. We finally ordered and the popovers were brought out as the bread service. Half of the popovers were overcooked and crispy, but we made do with the decent ones. The appetizers, oysters on the half shell, deviled eggs, fries, and mac and cheese were delayed. When they finally came the main course was ready as well. Luckily the table was large and all the dishes fit. I don't mind getting appetizers and the main course together at a lesser restaurant, but it was highly unseemly here.\n\nThe food preparation was for the most part excellent to superior. The fried chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and deliciously fragrant, savory and tender on the inside. The goat cheese ravioli was also superior, a good bite to the pasta and a delicious creamy interior. The ravioli was tossed in a fragrant butter sauce with seasonal vegetables. I ordered the pea soup which was very good, sweet and fresh tasting. The mac and cheese, fries, and devilied eggs for the kids were also very good. The bechamel used for the mac and cheese was decadent and we almost didn't give it to the kids. The wines by the glass are expensive but an excellent selection of local and imported bottles.\n\nHere are a few more missteps during the meal. The manager was trying to help the bartender serve us and he inadvertently rubbed his suit sleeve into a devilied egg. He mumbled an apology and quickly left leaving us wondering what was going to happen. He did replace the egg, but we felt like we were hanging for a bit. Some of the oysters on the half shell were mangled and missing its juices. It looked like a rookie tried to shell them. If a bad oyster or a mistake is made shelling the oyster, don't serve it! The final misstep is the lack of opportunity for feedback. The staff seemed a bit sheepish and the manager was scarce. I was too tired by the end to call him over to tell him my thoughts, and we just got out of there.\n\nThe sheer number of superior restaurants in the Bay area mean that it isn't likely I'll be back to give them another chance. I hope someone in charge reads this and makes some changes so that service is improved.", "author": "G N."}

Unfortunately, we must have been there on an off-night, as the food was average at best. Oddly enough, everything was over-salted, as though someone in the kitchen had generously dashed each dish on its way into the dining room. My friend's burger was well done, although he asked for medium rare. Service was impeccable, quickly dealt with the issues, and produced a new burger as soon as we brought it to their attention. They also offered a complimentary dessert and remove the cost of the burger from our bill.

Seriously, these were some of the worst fries I've ever had. Extremely chewy, it looks like they tried to cover up this aspect with all sorts of herbs and stuff.\n\nThe burger was also just not that great. This is the only place I know whose standard burger comes with bacon and cheese (and is reflected in the price). Why? Because it has to cover up the lack of flavor of the grass-fed meat (Tyler Florence, please talk to NOPA about how to make a good grass-fed burger).\n\nMoreso, I ordered my burger rare, but it was more like lightly seared, with most of it uncooked. Come on, if In N' Out can cook my burger rare to perfection every time,why can't you? Perhaps the grill chef was also preparing the steak tartare that day and got confused? Worst of all, I was in a rush and didn't have time to send it back.\n\nPerhaps I'll give it a second chance as everything on the menu sounds so amazing, but it is a bit difficult at this price point (really? no cheaper prices for lunch?)\n\nPopovers were pretty good.

One of two best tartares I've had in SF this year\nFoie Gras - order\nBaked Oysters (off menu) - order\nMarrow Bone - skip (panko was greasy, sauce was under the bone, and the marrow was underseasoned, so you really need instructions to eat the sauce with the marrow)\n\nPork Belly - order. crispy skin, a little tough on the bottom, but flavor was perfect.\nBlack Cod (special of the evening) - well prepared, a little salty for my taste\nDuck - skip.  flavor was good, but meat was too chewy (served rare)\nShort Ribs - skip.  not special.\n\nFried Apple Pie - order.  a little sweet, but the sage ice cream is interesting (tastes like a Necco wafer to me)\nSticky Toffee Pudding - order.

I wouldn't order this just to try the ice cream.  I'd order it for the pudding.\nRocky Road - skip.  the chocolate mousse wasn't chocolatey enough for me.\n\nWe were seated at a booth and it was very cozy.

It was busy, but not packed. The place had a good vibe to it...chatty without being loud, and very appropriate decor.  \n\nThe wait staff was accommodating, and very friendly.  I ordered a scrimshaw pilsner, which was better than I thought it would be.  All while enjoying their popovers, which are served instead of a standard bread. It's a drastic improvement over having a normal slice or two of bread... I started with the butter lettuce salad.  It's full leaves of lettuce, with the perfect amount of green goddess dressing in every bite. The dressing was a little heavier on the tarragon than I expected, but the flavor was excellent.  I truly enjoyed this simple salad.\n\nThen I got the fried chicken. It was a pan fried chicken, served with a ton of freshly fried herbs. Rosemary, thyme, and sage.  It was very tender, and flavorful, though I think it could have done with just a touch more salt.  I'd have it again for sure though.\n\nThe lunch was topped off by a goey brown butter cake. This was excellent.  The verbena ice cream was bright and flavorful.  the honeycomb on top of the cake was decadent.  I definitely liked the food and the experience.  \n\nWhy not 5 stars you may wonder?  Well, the value felt a little off.

At that point, the popover guy should have been waiting tableside and just left us the basket, but it was still several minutes until we saw him.  That combination of factors is where the knock off the star count comes into play.  Thankfully this restaurant is so lovely to look at, I was able to put the wicked hunger pangs out of my mind momentarily.  It's just pretty.  I would like my house to look like this.  The decor has actually made me rethink my stance on animal heads (please no one let my husband read this).\n\nMoving along, our waiter was awesome.  Friendly, swift and professional.  You can see that the entire staff is trained at some sort of special academy of loveliness.  We ordered the deviled eggs and the burratta and a bottle of rose to start.  The eggs were good, not life changing, but I wasn't mad at them.  The burrata was unreal.  All food should be required to taste that delicious.  We each ordered something different so we could Top Chef it out.  Here's how it went down:\n\n**The burger with caramelized onions, bacon, cheese and a fried egg on top was blissful.  I was hesitant on the egg but it has opened up a door for me.  The fries were awesome (and I'm not a huge fries fan)  Big portion too.  Even after sharing bites (which I won't lie, I was hesitant to do because it was so good) I couldn't finish it.\n\n**The fried chicken was super yum, but I agree it needs to be served with a side.  \n\n**The Steak Frites was a bit of a miss for me.  It was nicely cooked, but I expected something miraculous and it was just a nice bit of tri tip, average.  \n\n**  The salmon -- didn't try it so I can't speak to it.   Not my thing.  \n\nWe shared the macaroni and cheese and it was ridiculously amazing.  Fries were being dipped in the sauce.  That's all I need to say.\n\nWe shared the pineapple upside down cake and the sticky toffee pudding.  Good GODDDDDDDD.  I was inspired to come home and make sticky toffee pudding for my husband the following day.  He took a bite and when I asked how it was working out for him, he actually shushed me because words would ruin the moment.  So that's cool.\n\nI left there feeling fancy, full and surprisingly, not broke.  The bill wasn't shocking and for a fun birthday celebration, it felt just right.", "author": "Audrey C."}

I'll start with the atmosphere.  Beautiful building that reminded us of the East Coast, a two story, thin long building with a fireplace burning and an upstairs dining room.  The downstairs was very loud, packed with businessmen having cocktails, the bar wasn't too big, there was a raw bar next to it and then some large booths on the other side of the room with a few small tables by the fire.  We ate upstairs and at first I wasn't sure since it was early and the upstairs was empty but by the time we were eating the small upstairs bar was full and other tables were filling.  What I ended up liking about it was the quite, we could still hear the rustle downstairs but we were also able to hear each other talk which would have been questionable down stairs.  Upstairs also felt more fancy.\nWe started with a cocktail and a beer.   Not a place I would drink a bit pricey.  My thin vodka soda was $11 and that was the lower end one but not Sky and hubby chose a beer not realizing it was $13 so pay attention they do have less pricey beers.  Next was the bread, popovers.  They were hallow hard, flaky rolls with a hallow center.  If yours is a bit too hard get another because my second one had a bit more of a soft center.  The butter was salty and delicious.  Loved them.  Finally for an entree I had the scallops.  They were perfectly seared with a touch of spice from the hot oil, it was served with a couple tiny sweet potato nuggets with gravy over top.  The overall presentation and appeal was odd.  These two things just didn't go together.  They referred to it as breakfast mash up (not in those words) but I don't want my breakfast food messing up my scallops especially if the gravy is on the cold side.  I would order again only if the scallops were served differently.  My hubby had the pork tenderloin.  He thought it was tasty but not special.  Neither plate had a lot of food but in the end it was plenty.  Almost forgot we also shared a side of mac which I will never order again.  It looked good but the thyme took over the dish, giving it that black licorice taste, not good at all which was unfortunate since it looked like creamy goodness.  They need to 86 all that thyme", "author": "Dianne M."}

He made sure we had an excellent experience. Popovers with butter were OFF DA HOOK. The drinks were amazing. I had something with pear and egg... Pear brandy sounds weird. But it was amaze. I had the burger with the egg. OH EM GEE. What a burger, holy moly. I wanted to marry that burger. Take it home to meet my parents kind of thing. \nWe didn't have dessert but Ross let us taste a little bit of some. \nMy friends and I were blown away by this place. Ross was awesome and I might insist upon sitting at the bar again. \nI'm hoping to meet Tyler here when I go back because he's kind of a QT yadidamean??", "author": "Natalie C."}

I arrived early to the reservation to make sure it was noted that we were celebrating a special occasion and the hostess confirmed we were all set.\n\nAfter getting seated, I was waiting for the server to acknowledge even one time that it was my friend's birthday. Coming from a hospitality background where were always trying to create memorable experiences I could not believe there wasn't even a \"happy birthday\" muttered the entire meal, not to mention any type of surprise birthday amenity.\n\nFurthermore, the waitstaff was not bubbly or friendly--made no menu recommendations after we both indicated it was our first time at Wayfare Tavern.\nThe icing on the proverbial cake was when we had to ask how much longer lunch would be at 2pm after being seated at 12:30pm--and it wasn't even busy!!!\n\nNeedless to say, this dining experIence was underwhelming and our hotel staff will no longer be sending recommendations their way, even though I thought the food was pretty good!!", "author": "Elizabeth A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-10-13", "description": "After reading about this much-hyped opening--and seeing so many four- and five-star reviews here--I booked early and nabbed a early evening reservation at Wayfare Tavern. I'd actually met Mr. Florence once before at an in-store event at Macys. He was very warm and pleasant. However, the experience at his restaurant was quite a letdown. \n\nThe hostess was a bit curt when I arrived early and I parked myself at the bar. The specialty cocktail menu seemed a bit thin for a place of this caliber, so I opted for a Manhattan. It was decent but not particularly memorable. \n\nWe were seated upstairs in the dining room, which was quieter than downstairs but still deafeningly loud. Even early on a Tuesday, this place was packed. The decor is incredibly kitsch and cozy in a WASPy-clubby kinda way, but not necessarily overdone. \n\nAnd we sat. Awhile. Eventually I tried my dad's patented \"where's the waiter\" expression and someone showed up and took our drink order. In fact, we didn't seem to have a single server that night--three very nice gentlemen stopped by at different points. \n\nI never really comment on iced tea, but the way they add citrus at Wayfare was notably different--and unnecessarily so. They use some sort of lemon ice instead of a simple lemon wedge. If you don't like lemon in your iced tea as I do, this was a real pain to scoop out, and by then the flavor is already there. So much ado about something so trivial, right? So while I normally wouldn't make a fuss over it, I had to repeatedly ask the servers to leave the \"lemon whatever-it-is\" out of of my drink. And I had to always ask because refills were never proactively offered. \n\nThe food at Wayfare Tavern--at least what we ordered--was all decent, but unextraordinary and overpriced. (I wasn't really sticker shocked considering the FiDi location; the overall middling quality of everything was the bigger letdown.) The $11 fall salad was indeed hearty and had a nice blend of earthy, sweet, and acidic flavors. The $15 tuna crudo had large, fresh chunks of tuna that were unfortunately coated in a rather overpowering sauce. \n\nPacing was a huge problem for the Wayfare kitchen. Our cold apps came out rather quickly, but the time in between courses was inordinately long. So long that our second server came out multiple times to inform us that our main courses would arrive soon. (At least he did that.) \n\nStill, when our main courses arrived they failed to impress. The \"tri-tip with heirloom onions and organic potatoes\" that I ordered turned out to be a $27 plate of Steak Frites. (Wayfare was often very guilty of piling on with the colorful menu language. \"Foraged mushrooms?\" Puh-leeze.) The meat itself was cooked at the correct temperature (and had a wonderful sauce), but was so tough that my jaw tired from chewing it. The fries were well cooked but so salty I quickly gave up on them. I considered sending the dish back (because of the meat), but frankly I feared how long I would have to wait for a replacement. My friend's $28 salmon fillet wasn't much better--decently cooked but overall unimpressive, especially considering the price. \n\nWe also ordered the $8 macaroni and cheese side dish. It was well cooked and had a nice burn on top. However, while this may just be personal preference, my friend and I both found it so incredibly rich and creamy that after three bites you couldn't manage another. (It also left us feeling so stuffed we were turned off to ordering dessert.) \n\nOddly enough, my two favorite food items were \"free.\" The popovers--which were difficult to come by--were flaky and wonderful, with just a nice touch of egg. And the ginger snaps that came with the check (which also had errors, which were quickly corrected) were right out of the oven and heavenly. \n\nSo, combined with the friendly-but-spotty service, misfired kitchen pacing, and middling, overpriced food... Eh, I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. Too bad, really.", "author": "Aaron L."}

Our server was excited about the menu, and it showed.  He talked about his favorites, and also introduced us to the v-day tasting menu, which is what we ultimately decided on.\n\nFirst course was a chilled kumamoto oyster with caviar and a sprig of cilantro.  salty, fresh, and tasted like the ocean! \n\nSecond course was a cauliflower soup with lobster, brussels and hazelnut salad, and finished with a bit of smoked olive oil.  the soup was smooth, and even though I know it was loaded with cream, it was as light as a cloud.\n\nThird course was pharaoh's quail with braised mustard greens, Anson Mills grits, dried orchard fruit, and smoked bacon.  the grits were a velvety bed of goodness for the quail, and bitter (in a good way) mustard greens.  the dried fruit was a bit sweet for me, and while the sauce was slightly over reduced, still a wonderful third course.\n\nFourth course, insert drum roll please...Beef and bones!  Grilled ribeye cooked sous-vide with roasted bone marrow, shaved Perigold truffles, watercress, and green peppercorns.  Wow, I dont think there is much out to say about this dish...divine! \n\nFinished the meal with a warm flourless Scharffen Berger cake, brown butter Frangelico ice cream, and hazelnut pavlova. the dessert was tasty, but I would have been happy finishing with another piece of the above roasted bone marrow.\n\noverall, great food, great service, great vibe.  looking forward to heading back to try the fried chicken, and burger.  keep doing what you're doing tyler, it's awesome!", "author": "David M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-22", "description": "I was torn about the actual number of stars, as we had a mixed experience, but in the end, this feels fair.\n\nI called the same afternoon to see if we could get in and we were promptly given a reservation.  I was pleased that we could get a table, since I heard they were booked for the coming weeks.  \n\nUpon arrival, even though we were early, we were seated right away.  However, that's where the promptness ended.  We sat for at least 10 minutes with our menus before someone asked what type of water we preferred.  After about another 10 minutes, we were asked to place our drink orders.  I should clarify that we were STARVING, and every minute that passed without out waiter taking our order was painful.  He was very sweet and friendly and helpful, so it was hard to hold it against him.  Finally, we were able to order our food, and I could relax a bit.\n\nWhile I was sipping my wine and checking out the surroundings, I couldn't help but feel I was transitioned back to the 50's or 60's.  I both loved the decor and felt like I was intruding on some old boys network spot.  My friend joked that it looked like the kind of  place fat old white men would take their mistresses decades ago.  The other downside was that our table was at the top of the stairs in a narrow walkway and we often had to lean a bit to avoid having a waiter or patron bump us.\n\nFinally, our appetizers arrived. I've been craving steak tartare lately.  I don't know why, it's just all I've wanted.  So, of course, we got the steak tartare.  We also ordered the poutine, which is my new favorite way to clog my arteries.  First--the poutine--it was delicious.  A short-rib gravy mixed with fries, and then topped with a cheese blend and shaved black truffles.  It was delicious.  It wasn't technically a poutine because they didn't use cheese curds, but it was yummy nonetheless.  The steak tartare, on the other hand, was a disappointment.  It was a good serving size, but very bland.  I was really let down.  And, why don't they ever give you enough toast to eat your steak tartare--at any place?!?!?\n\nAnyway, for our entrees we had the duck and short ribs.  The short ribs were delicious and the mashed potatoes were phenomenal, if not drowned a bit too much in truffle oil.  But, the most amazing part was the lardon that was in the duck sauce.  The MOST AMAZING BACON I've ever eaten...hands down.  I wanted to cry it was so good.  Luckily, my friend doesn't like bacon and gave me all of it.  I savored each bite and it made the short ribs pale in comparison.\n\nFor dessert, all I wanted was more lardon.  I couldn't stop thinking about it.  So, I asked and our waiter was amazing, he took it all in stride and brought me a small bowl of lardon pieces.  I was in heaven...This is what brought them from three to four stars for me.", "author": "Jessica L."}

The sauce however was very salty. \n\nthe well-reviewed chicken was good, crispy skin and tender meat. loved the roasted garlic and deep fried rosemary on top. but again, seasoning is a bit salty for my taste (I didn't finish eating the perfectly crispy skin due to the salty-ness of it).\n\nthe hang town fry was good only b/c i loved the combination of oyster + eggs. but that was only 1/10 of the total dish, the other 9 bites of the dish was kind of heavy for me. \n\nwe shared a pumpkin cake for dessert. definitely enjoyed the honeycomb from tyler's backyard, and the hot, moist fillings inside of the cake.

Overall a good feel to the restaurant.\n\nTheir menu is a little boring to me, but it does represent what Tyler Florence is all about which is comfort food.  Mac and cheese, fried chicken, ribs, etc.  We started with the steak tartare and the Avocado/Hearts of Palm salad.  The tartare was very, very good and served with incredible popovers.  My wife loved the salad, although avocado and hearts of palm are two of her favorites.  For dinner we split the ribs and mac and cheese.  I found both to be average.  As in you could find the same elsewhere that were just as good if not better.  They  weren't bad, just ok and expensive in my opinion for about 1/2 rack of ribs.\n\nWe had drinks at the bar and sat outside before being seated.  I had a whiskey and they served it with almost crushed ice, which if you drink whiskey is a big error in my opinion.

The food is hearty, the staff is knowledgeable and welcoming, and the ambiance is masculine and sophisticated.\n\nI love how they have such an eye for detail. The thing that impressed me the most was that even if you don't order dessert, they provide you with a little something sweet (one time it was warm gingersnaps and the other time it was warm caramel popcorn). The menu is great because every guest could find something he/she would like. \n\nThe burger is amazing. Also, they have the best carrot cake ever.\n\nThe service is outstanding. They are very attentive to food allergies and don't make a fuss over any requests, such as splitting the check.\n\nHow could Wayfare Tavern improve? Doing bathroom checks to stock up paper goods would be one. The other: hosts should manage the walk-in area for guests so people don't have to get into arguments with strangers.

And let me tell you...Wayfare Tavern's GREATNESS has NOTHING to do with it's beautiful 1920's decor (adorned with deer heads and antlers hanging over the walls and the \"smoking room\" doubled as a pool table library/cozy dining room), the amazing service, especially from Sam-our waiter (hands down, my favorite waiter thus far), the tantilizing and irresistable food and of course, it has NOTHING to do with Chef Florence (Who, sadly was not there).  Wait...no.. IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH ALL THAT IS WAYFARE TAVERN!\n\nI usually don't like tavern/saloon type decor, but walking into WT, we got an immediate feel of 1920's meets the socialites of San Francisco.  The bar was packed, but we did not go unnoticed.  The nostalgic drinks were served perfectly, packed with subtle, surprising flavors.  Watch the bartender...The \"scientist\" is making a concoction that will knock your knickers off!\n\nOnce seated, our waiter, Sam (I heart Sam!) recommended a few dishes (who could resist his recommendations?) and was very patient while we teetered between choices.  He even gave us two complimentary glasses of wine...Who does that?  Sam!  \n\nWe finally set our hearts to a half dozen oysters, mac n cheese, steak and eggs and of course, the already famous fried chicken.  The popovers were a nice touch, especially with the asiago (or parmesan?) baked in...I couldn't resist.  I had two.\n\nI'm not an oyster fan, but I have to admit, coupled with the vinegar and cocktail sauce, it was actually pretty good...an afrodisiac, if you will...Was it all in my head?  \n\nAnd finally, the main dishes.  Oh my, the fried chicken with the fried sage and thyme and roasted garlic were all to perfection.  Moist pieces of chicken, delicately seasoned and lightly breaded with a hint of buttermilk.  Now that is heaven.  \"Last meal on earth\"?  Organic Fried Chicken, please!  (with a side of bacon...thanks!)  The side of mac n cheese with the garlic breadcrumbs was a good compliment to the meal...yummy comfort in my tummy.\n\nMy love had the steak and eggs: soft eggs, dungeness crab atop succulent petite filet mignons with savory bearnaise drizzled to complete his idea of the ultimate \"Last Meal on Earth\".  He needed a moment.  Actually a few...\n\nTwo \"last meals on earth\" under one roof...what could be better than that?  The Chocolate Story.\n\nTCHO Cho-co-late pudding, fudge marble ice cream, cookie crumbs, caramel ganache and cho-co-late covered rice crispy bits...We were already full, but could not resist the goodness sitting in front of us.  Easily the \"Last Dessert on Earth\".  \n\nI look forward to trying out the burger next time...in the running for the best burger in SF?  I'm sure it will be!  GREATNESS at Wayfare Tavern...I wanna experience it over and over again!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Getting to meet the Chef when we were finished with dinner (it was just past 11 pm at this point) and since I went with a few fellow foodie friends, we immediately transformed into fanboys/girls when we saw him on the patio space in front of the restaurant.\n\nHe stopped to chat with us and we snapped a pic. =) \n\nWe came when Wayfare had been opened just a while and it was super crowded... we ended up waiting a bit over half an hour after our reservation time but the hostess kept us apprised of the seating situation and all and the open kitchen and interesting bar kept us occupied. Also caught a glimpse of Willie Brown in one of the booths. \n\nDeliciously melty cheesy popover served as the \"bread basket\" and OMG... I could have eaten a dozen of those (if not more).\n\nThe food? Took a while to get to us due to the newness of the restaurant and the utter crowd... but it was great when it did get there. Between the four of us, we tried the bone marrow appetizer (yumm but prob not worth the $$), the uni toast (yummmo), rack of lamb, fried chicken, bass, sardines, mac n cheese (deliciousness!) and for dessert - pineapple upside down cake (highly recommended by our server and for good reason - definitely try it if you can), an apple tart, and some sort of pouf drizzled w/chocolate. \n\nAnother great thing - the awareness of the customer service. Knowing that they were working out some kitchen service kinks, they comped our numerous desserts... and the Chef even apologized to us for the wait himself during our brief chat after dinner.\n\nFor private events, there is also a \"library\" room with a pool table - looked like a great place to hang out with some drinks and have some apps with friends.\n\nCan't wait to go back. =)", "author": "Rachel M."}

Nice clubby look and feel. Had a drink while deciding (son loved the root beer, a bit sweet though). \n\nIt's mostly comfort food with some twists, although we started out with Devils on Horseback-loved the combo of dates, almond & bacon.Son is a steak & fries type and since we hail from the Central Coast, he takes the Santa Maria tri-tip, natch. (Just like home.)  Wife had salmon which was done perfectly--seared crusty exterior and almost obscene creamy pink interior. Succulent indeed. I had the fried chicken, (served with a great local Scotch Ale, can't remember the brewery right now) and it surpassed anything I could have imagined from my childhood Sunday dinners. An apotheosis of fried chicken if you will. Tender, hot, moist, light and crunchy.  Huckleberry mess and chocolate terrine for dessert, artfully decorated for our anniversary and son's Bday (great dessert artistry there)\n\nThis food looked and tasted like everyone cared about the food, how lit tasted,  looked,  was presented.\n\nThat's becoming all too rare in my recent restaurant experience, one reason why I highly recommend this place and will return as soon as I can. \n\n-oh, and don't forget the popovers!

Not necessarily because the food is great, but because the location is great if you are in the financial district and it does have that name pizaz, with Tyler Florence being the big honcho.  In fact I have seen him plating food here a couple of times.  In the end though I don't think I can return here.\n\nBut this last experience was unacceptable.  I was upstairs and having dinner with a friend I haven't seen in quite sometime. He hadn't eaten at Wayfare despite being a self proclaimed foodie and living in SF.  So I agreed.  Everything was fine (btw have the Hanger One Kefir Lime martini, it is awesome) until we were seated.\n\nOnce we were seated we had this horrible waiter, a gay guy with glasses, if you get him ask to change tables.  This becomes relevant later.  But basically we order the appetizers (always order Poutin) and that was fine.  Then I ordered their famous fried chicken.   I cut into my first piece and it was salty but I thought ok this is fried chicken after all so let it go.\n\nBut when i got towards the bone, it was bloody.    I stopped eating it.  Now most people will ask why didn't ask for a new dish or send it back.  It is because the aforementioned waiter is incredibly rude and really didn't want to look our way if he wasn't forced to.  The only way I could get his attention was either by waiving down the bread guy or the water guy and asking them to get our waiter's attention or by acting like I was directing air traffic on the runway.\n\nSo I just didn't bother.  Big mistake.  I ended up getting very sick that night, basically lived in the bathroom of my home for the next 4 hours.  My wife called the next day and they said they would look into it. Really?  That just means get off the phone and thank you for your $200.  I would expect something more from them, but obviously with the number reviews they have they just don't care.", "author": "Sid R."}

Nothing really blew my socks off, but I liked everything I ate.  In fact, everything I've tried there has been one of the best versions, if not THE best version, I've ever had.  It's not innovative or surprising - and it's not meant to be.  It's comforting, and that's a good thing.  \n\nThe best stuff:  burger w/ sunny side up egg; steak tartare, fried chicken, beets, baked mac 'n cheese, french fries, pot roast (appears to be seasonal).  \n\nIt's my new favorite go-to in San Francisco.  I don't have to dress up, I don't have to reserve two months in advance or wait in line at 5pm to be seated at a bar (or a table 3-hours later -- some of you know which SF restaurants I'm referring to), and I can count on reliable, good food and a cozy setting.\n\nOh, and save room for dessert!

I only sampled the dates (picky eaters unite!), they were amazing delicious. My colleagues demolished the others so it's safe to say they were tasty too.\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e I shared the fried chicken, totally a wise move as the serving was huge, something like 5 pieces? The herbs in the fry batter were delicious, maybe a little salty, but not so much that you couldn't taste the rosemary and other good stuff. The batter itself was a little thicker than my waistline would have preferred, but the flavor was soo good I appreciated it.  We also split mac and cheese side (very good!) and some broccoli, which wasn't on the menu but we were lacking veggies so they steamed some for us.  The wine list is great, and the dessert menu looked amazing, I wish I'd been hungry for dessert.\n\nSmall issue: I sat on the deep end of one of their long booths, and the server couldn't reach me. I was constantly taking things from her and handing things to her, passing my water glass down the table to be refilled. Seems like, with such a price tag, the servers should be able to reach their guests.\n\nAlso, taxidermy on the walls really doesn't do it for me. Kind of gross when you're eating?

With someone with the level of fame of Tyler Florence expectations are really high - you don't expect a single error and if you do run into one - especially a big one - it can be hard to get past.\n\nSince we were dining on a weeknight we had no problems in getting a reservation nor being seated.  (Since we were meeting our friends after work, we were even seated before our reservation.)  We did manage to get in a drink at the bar before the hostess took us upstairs to the table.\n\nThe physical space fits perfectly with the classic San Francisco restaurant feeling they were going for.  Although it is not a huge space, it feels roomy and wasn't overly noisy the night we were there.\n\nWe were first greeted with popovers which were excellent.  Had it not been that we wanted to sample more items on the menu, we would have requested several refills of the bread basket they were that good.\n\nSadly, we were all greatly disappointed with our appetizers.  At the table there were two orders of the foie gras, one order of the bone marrow and one order of the watermelon and radish salad.  Within moments of sampling our food, a hush came over the table as we all began regretting our decisions.\n\nMichael Bauer's description of the watermelon in the watermelon and radish salad as \"...a slice of translucent fruit that had the texture of something forgotten in the refrigerator too long,\" was spot on.  The salad was so underdressed that one only items on the plate that had any taste were the black olives and feta. \n\nThe bone marrow was described as being tasteless.\n\nThe portions of foie gras were exceptionally generous but neither flavorful not memorable.  They were served with roasted peach halves.\n\nTyler redeemed himself with the entrees.  Three of us selected his signature fried chicken and it was unanimously declared a hit.  The chicken was hot, moist and flavorful and not overly greasy.  All of us ate every bite on our plates.\n\nEqually as well received was the pork chop.\n\nWe had a number of sides including the macaroni and cheese and the French fries.  Both were very good, but truthfully more food that even four large appetites needed.\n\nDesserts were as good as the entrees.  The \"Chocolate Story\" which features TCHO chocolate pudding was one of the best chocolate desserts I have ever eaten.  It was well worth however many points it put me over on the day as a Weight Watcher's member.  (I had to ride up Mount Tam several times to work that one off...)\n\nOur server was friendly and professional.\n\nEven though there were some glitches with the meal, all of us would go back and are looking forward to it.\n\nAs an aside, this is not one of those Yelp reviews where the reviewer makes negative comments and then hides in the anonymity of the web...  The picture in my profile is of me and is pretty much current.  I live in Mill Valley and shop at Tyler Florence's store...  Indeed, I have met him several times at book signings and just around town...  For whatever it is worth, I'd say the same to him in person.  (Hopefully he wouldn't punch me...)

Awesome. \n\nUnfortunately, we had no silverware with which to eat them (the food runners didn't notice this when they dropped off the food) so we had to wait a good 5 minutes for our waitress to show up with silverware so that we could eat. \n\nNo one explained what was in the dishes when they arrived and our waitress had clearly fired the ticket on our entrees early in an attempt to turn over the table.\n\nBusboys and the waitress hovered throughout the remainder of the meal, clearing dishes even though everyone at the table wasn't done...trying to grab dishes inbetween bites...it was just so rushed, so obnoxious, and made the entire experience feel like eating at a Denny's off an interstate highway in New Jersey.\n\nOnto the good things: the food. The crispy-skin halibut was divine. It may be the best piece of fish I've had in SF in terms of execution and flavor. Other standouts: steak tartare, fig almond semifreddo, and Frog Hollow peach pie. Everything else was \"ok\" but not amazing. The deviled eggs were actually kind of gross - the anchovy flavor was unappealing and overwhelming. I would have loved having a mix of different types of deviled eggs since there were 6 per order (some w/truffles, some w/capers, etc) instead of them being the same - but that's just a preference.\n\nOverall, service = 0 and food = 4. Do yourself a favor and wait a few months for them to get their act together before trying this place (or go for lunch and sit at the bar). If you order the right things the food is actually outstanding, but it's very hit or miss.

Gotta go to the gym later or I'm going to go into a coma for sure.  \n\nMy friend and I split the steak tartar for appetizer.  Nice, fatty, meaty goodness.  Comes with the egg yolk on top, mixed with some sharp greens and fried onion bits.  Take one big spoonful and place it on top of a handmade brioche lathered with pesto (I think) and you are in meat nirvana.\n\nFor main, I first was going to order the Steak Frites, but when I asked for it rare (more acurately, I asked the waitress to just take it through a warm room *I like my meat rare as you can tell*), she said they can only serve it medium-rare because of the marinating process.  Points added for the waitress telling me that!  So, she offered that if I wanted some rare beef, go for their burger. Another point for being kind enough to suggest an alternative based upon my indicated like.  \n\nThe burger was indeed rare.  It was greasy heaven - I had to work my napkin like a champ wiping his brow in the corner at a prize fight - I had to be sure I didn't get some of that greasy goodness on my nice dress shirt and give my co-workers back at the office any jealous fits at my lunch location.  The pommes frites (or freedom fries to us Yanks) were pretty good.   Not the best I've had - hello, if you go to Belgium, order them there, that's the shizzle.  But they were darn good.  \n\nService was stellar.   Attentive but not annoyingly so.  They took their time bringing the food - which is what you want for a place where a burger costs $28.  It gives you time to enjoy the experience and talk.  This is not a place to grab a quick, cheap bit for lunch (or dinner).  It is pricey and slow, but in the way a fine eatery is supposed to be.  \n\nWay to go Tyler Florence!  Gotta take my wife to have try your FiDi must-eat-at-place!", "author": "Greg R."}

The seared sonoma foie gras, with figs, almonds and french toast was an improvement over last time and was a proper starter - 5 stars.  The deviled eggs were a hit once again.

The oysters on the half shell were 5 stars as well.\n\nNext were the potato puree, figs on a plate, buttermilk fried chicken, and steak and eggs.  The organic fried chicken was once again a home run, crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked chicken inside - 5 stars.  The steak and eggs, was well, amazing.  It was a perfect \"mess on a plate\" - 5 stars.  My favorite food dish name ever - Figs on a plate - an obvious dig at David Chang and his comments about SF Chefs, was well presented and tasteful, and the potato puree with truffles were both 5 stars.\n\nWe ended with the Pineapple Upside Down Cake, a perfect ending to a perfect meal - 5 stars.\n\nChef Tyler Florence, you and your kitchen and staff rock!  40 stars out of a possible 40!

You guys were awesome!\n\nI was super excited when I found out I would be dining at Tyler Florence's new restaurant and there was a chance the Food Network chef would make his rounds.  Sure enough he stopped by our table (at the request made by my friend Julie K) and took a photo with me.  Yay!  \n\nGiven that it was only the second week of opening, I expected some service issues.  I wish our party of 7 had a little more space on our table to dine more comfortably.  We were cramped into a banquette while the table next to ours was emptied.  This was nothing majorly offensive and hopefully the service will smooth out over time.  \n\nOverall the food was very good.  We had a nice start with super airy popovers instead of bread.  We followed with some of the best appetizers on the menu, perfectly cooked deviled eggs with a soft velvety texture, thinly sliced carpaccio, and super creamy roasted bone marrows that tasted like butter with the sourdough toast.  I would definitely order the bone marrow again on my next visit.  \n\nFor entrees, our table had fried chicken, crisp halibut, steak and egg, lamb, and 21 day aged grass fed sirloin. The prices were reasonable for the portions being served.  I love lamb so I had the lamb two ways.  The dish had a lot of flavor with the lamb chop cooked perfectly to a medium rare but the braised lamb shank was a little too salty for me.  My friend loved her fried chicken and couldn't finish the serving.  The other dish which I thought was super delicious was the steak and egg.  Medium rare filet mignon topped with Dungeness crab meat and a fried egg on the side. Oh wow.  I never thought comfort food would include steak and egg.  I loved it.  \n\nFor desserts, the waiter brought me the ultimate chocolate cupcake.  It was one of the best cupcakes I have ever tasted.  Moist dark chocolate cake with amazing frosting that was creamy, light, and not too sweet.  It was heavenly.  Everyone loved it so much more than the upside down pineapple cake and the 8 layer coconut cake.  We devoured the cupcake immediately. The frosting was so yummy I even licked the plate.  Hey it was my birthday so it was forgivable. :)\n \nOverall our table of 7 did not have any negative things to say about our entrees.  I had a great time and I was so happy to have some of my closest friends to enjoy a wonderful birthday dinner with me.  \n\nI definitely wouldn't mind returning for the steak and egg and have another order of the ultimate chocolate cupcake.

Seeing the man himself sling accents and accoutrements onto various plated dishes in the kitchen below.

The masters of mixology really blew us away with their cocktails, incorporating ingredients and tastes that really tingled the taste buds if you know what I mean...\n\nFor starters we had the hearts of palm and avocado salad, never knew avocado could taste so good.

That rosemary scent, the absurdly moist and brined chicken, and little bulbs of roasted garlic littered about my plate (that was enough for 3 meals for me, gotta stretch out the love), pretty much sealed the deal for the best chicken I've ever had. \n\nThe ambiance is part hunter's lodge, part Ron Burgandy's dining room, hints of rich mahogany and men in suits who would wear Sex Panther fill the room. It's also iconic, an old SF feel and just plain...classy. \n\nEveryone who was there seemed to be enjoying themselves, from the couple to our left on their anniversary date, to the fledgling couple and somewhat bumbling Marina girl to our right, but the entertainment was in the food, and at my own table, no one else's.\n\nOh, I'll be back.

The popovers they serve you are BIG, but light and buttery- you don't even need to add butter. We then started with the shishito peppers, rabbit terrine, and frog hollow peaches. I've typically only had shishito peppers with salt (a la Alembic), but the added tang of garlic and anchovies was spot on! And the serving size was probably twice that of Alembic's... I could have taken a doggie bag home just filled with shishitos.\n\nThe rabbit terrine was by far the best starter we consumed. And did we consume it!! The bread it came with was perfectly toasted to a light brown, and the terrine was so flavorful I honestly could have shoved the entire block of it in my mouth. This is a MUST try appetizer.\n\nThe best thing about the peach/radish \"salad\" was that the peaches were insanely fresh, juicy, and delicious. But the overall concept of the salad was a little \"meh\" to me.\n\nOn to entrees!.... He got the Petaluma Chicken. It was very thin, as if they slit a whole breast into thirds and only served on layer. I had one bite, and it wasn't memorable. The endive and bacon on top were cold, as intended, but it didn't seem to add anything to the chicken.\n\nI, on the other hand, went with my heart's delight and got the bbq pork ribs that were on the menu that night. They were so well marinated, tender,juicy, and accompanied by semi-charred corn on the cob. Definitely the highlight of the experience after the rabbit. So delicious!!! There was no doggie bag needed for this dish ;-)\n\nFor dessert, we went with the waitresses recommendation of the chocolate cream pie. It was also outstanding. It had just enough whipped cream, to just enough chocolate (and not heavy, dark, chocolate, but milky and fluffy), to just enough flaky crust. \n\nBUT.... ABOUT THAT WAITRESS...... she is either the happiest person I've ever been served by....OR she's a robot.... OR, she was high :) Both myself and my friend and the three women dining next to us couldn't help but comment to each other that the waitress had (seemingly unknowingly) delivered the SAME pitch for the menu to my table (TWICE!!) and to the other table IN THE EXACT SAME WORDS AND INTONATION!!  But is doesn't matter. The food was good, the ambiance was rustic vintage but the scene was mellow (even with the tables WAY to close together in some areas). I had a good meal, and I aint complaing....\nexcept I think that waitress should either be drug tested or re-wired.", "author": "Raquel C."}

Well, finally made it on my recent trip to SF  and honestly can't say it was a fabulous experience. We had an 8:15 reservation and were coming from another event and running a little tight, so we called just to let them know we \"MAY\" be a few mins late. The reservationist/host kind of made a big deal that they would only hold the reservation for 15 minutes and were we sure we would make it in time. With that in mind we hustled our way over and had our driver drop the 3 of us at the door while they parked. We were at the host stand at 8:16. When we checked in the Host remarked that they were running a bit behind \"ALSO\"  and it would be a few minutes. ALSO? I'm thinking a minute past my reservation is not running late. OK,  so at  9:11 just short of an hour past our reservation,we were finally seated and we were all so hungry we were ready to gnaw our hands off. The manager did offer us a glass of wine for our wait, which was the right thing to do.\nSo Ordering, I'll skip the cocktails, we ordered a variety and they were perfectly fine, nothing exceptional.  WE ordered the Deviled Eggs which I had be dreaming about for 2 years (and my daughter raves about) Personally I was disappointed, not sure I really liked the flavor profile B-, they were OK. POUTINE C, just OK, I've had way better and there was hardly any gravy. For mains my son had a Burger and LOVED it, I tasted and it was quite good and cooked perfectly to request and the brioche bun was awesome  A,  Black Cod, CHicken Paillard and Brussels were shared by the other 3 of us.  None of them were knock your socks off memorable B, B- ish.  The service was good right in the sweet spot between being annoying and making sure we had everything needed. \nSo overall I'd rate 3 1/2 but It just wasn't good enough to warrant the hour wait so 3 stars it is. I would definitely come back at some point for a burger and a cocktail :)", "author": "Ann K."}

Decadence can be good, even great, but sometimes you just want them to pull it back a little.\n\nCame here on a Tuesday night for dinner. Online reservation at 8pm was easy to make a few weeks prior. The host and hostess were very pleasant. When we got there about 10 minutes early, they were preparing the table and we could wait at the bar. There are actually two really nice bars (one downstairs and one upstairs), where you can hang out and throw down a martini while you're waiting. The whole decor of the place might seem stuffy if you were to look at it when the place is empty. It's something like British hunting lodge meets pub. Dark green walls, polished wood and brass, stuffed stag heads hanging on the wall. The atmosphere is lively, though, which requires raising your voice a little to have a conversation. There are booths downstairs along with seating in front of the open kitchen, although I would assume those would have to be requested when making the reservation. The place seats quite a large number of people. \n\nThe menu has some very interesting options. I didn't get to try the steak tartare, which was recommended by a friend. Instead I chose the poutine. Poutine's one of those dishes that you can't really believe exists. The WT version is french fries covered in braised short rib, mozzarella curds, and gravy. It was awesome. The braised short ribs were so tender and the mozzarella curds and gravy were so rich. I wish the fries would have stayed crispy a little longer, because in the end it ends up somewhat mushy. About halfway through, though, I was already starting to hit a wall. At this point, I also started drinking a lot more water. The combination of fries and gravy and short ribs made for a very salty dish. And that was just the appetizer. The burrata on crostini was excellent, with the braised mustard greens a great combination with the crusty crostini and the soft burrata. \n\nFor my entree, what better to follow up my appetizer of fries and meat than with fries and meat? I got the steak frites. The tri tip was a well-cooked medium rare and came out sliced. Here, too, the dish could have used less salt. The fries were practically inedible, they were so salty. I guess it's a good thing I got my fries fix during the appetizer. The fries were nice and crispy, though. I also tried the fried chicken. Well seasoned, very tasty. \n\nFor dessert, we got the pineapple upside down cake. It comes with mac nut crumble and coconut ice cream. They pop the cake out onto the plate at the table. The cake part was good and the pineapple sweet, but the amount of butter and brown sugar they stuff into the bottom of that cake was overkill. You couldn't really taste the coconut ice cream, let alone anything else. I would have like to have tasted more of the pineapple or even the cake itself. \n\nOverall, I loved the food, but hope that next time I'll get something where the flavors are more reserved.", "author": "Saunders C."}

We decided to get there right when they open.  Walking distance from where we were staying, \"Westin\", we trekked on over to Sutter and there were already 2 people waiting at 4:50pm.  They open at 5:00pm.  Within 10 minutes of opening, there were 12 people already waiting in line.  We were second!  \n\nWhen you walk in, there are white tile area that are on a first come first serve basis.  Within 30-45 minutes of being there, the whole bottom floor was filled with guests. We decided to head over to the Chef's counter.  It's great to see all the food made before your eyes.  Plus, quality control is always nice =P.  \n\nOn the menu:\n\nPoutine - French fried potatoes, mozzarella curd, braised short rib, truffle gravy (The truffle flavor was great.  It actually tasted better when we sided it with the burger)\n\nRoasted Bone Marrow - the bone marrow went straight into the oven with no seasoning.  Out it comes with a sprinkle of sea salt, a drizzle of smoked olive oil.  You can spread it on the sourdough that comes with, but it's really teeth breaking bread.  The salad complimented it well with the pickled onions.  (I believe it was pickled onions, I could be wrong)\n\nUni Toast - Mendocino sea urchin, raw mushrooms, uni butter, grilled brioche, radish, chervil & lime (My absolute favorite dish.  It was AWESOME.  Two big chunks of uni + bread + all of the other ingredients, it was just a combination of flavors that synced together so well with final bite from the citrus.  Heaven...)\n\nOn to the Entrees\n\nKnown for their Organic Fried Chicken and Wayfare Burger \"Le Grand\" - We decided to try both\n\nOrganic Fried Chicken - several pieces fried to perfection.  Golden on the outside and juicy on the inside.  It was good, but not great.  I was expecting more Southern style, not so much of the Herbiness of it all; nonetheless, it was good.  If you like Herbs, go for it. If not, I would stay away.\n\nWayfare Burger \"Le Grand\" - Le Grand is right on the money.  It's HUGE.  It's a must-have with the egg.  It's one of those burgers where you take a bite and you can feel the juices flowing down your fingers.  Drip, drip onto your plate. Yumm....It comes with fries, but we ordered the Poutine so they let us substitute for the Baked Macaroni & Cheese.  Very heavy and I could only eat a little of it.  \n\nOne thing that I noted was that the couple next to us got offered seconds on the bread and we didn't.  We were also there first and ordered more.  We were also not offered refills for our drinks.  Both glasses of Beer and Root beer remained empty by the end of the dinner.  Too full for any dessert, all that is left is to ask for the check.\n\nApproximately $130 for all, including tax and tip.  Not too bad for all that we ordered.  3 Appetizers and 2 Entrees.  They gave us each a small piece of caramel corn before we left.  This is a great ending to the dinner.  We're too full for a whole dessert, but leaving with our mouths with just a bit of sugar...just right... \n\nOne of the nice things about the restaurant is that when you have togo items (leftovers), they give you a claim ticket to pick up on your way out.

With a celebrity chef like Tyler Florence, you expect greatness. You expect to pay more and be amazed. Maybe because he was away from the restaurant this weekend? Maybe the kitchen had an off day but this place is at best 3 1/2 stars when we ate here today. With a name backing a restaurant like this, you ought to be wowed. Unfortunately, we weren't. \n\nPopovers...........great way to start a meal. This place along with Sea cliff restaurant in the Richmond district are the only restaurants that I like popovers. I think sea cliff might have the edge. \n\n2 orders of the bone marrow. I would say one of the best dishes on their menu. Well seasoned and tasted like butter. \n\nMac and Cheese. I had mac and cheese two days in a row. Once over at Tee Off and today. Tee Off will put this mac and cheese to shame but it is still decent. It's just that Tee Off has it down. \n\nDeviled eggs. Good. At the end of the day it is still a deviled egg \n\nWhole order of the Steak tartar.. Is it as good as Bix? I don't know. Bix has the table side presentation where they actually mix and season the steak and raw egg together right in front of you. We actually had to mix the tartar ourselves. Edge has to go over to Bix. \n\nAvocado with the hearts of palm...... Very good. Something different, light, refreshing. I really liked this dish. \n\nCobb Salad..............Average, nothing special, maybe the lobster bits added some element to it. I understand that you use organic tomatoes but do you really have to leave the stems on them. Don't get me wrong the green tomatoes were great but come on for 18 dollar a salad can't you at least take the stems off? \n\nGrilled Chicken breast. Probably their weakest dish of them all. Portions were ridiculously small. Both of my brother and friend had to head up to Kung Fu Tacos to grab a taco after wards. \n\nSteak and egg...........Said it was probably the most tender steak he has ever had. It looked great. \n\nFried Chicken...........It tasted as though it was baked. It wasn't crunchy, almost soggy to be honest with you. Didn't taste like the flour was fried off. Texture and seasoning were good but this was something that I really wanted to like. It was a 22 dollar mess. \n\nHamburger...............My friend said that this burger was better than 5A5's Kobe burger and he is a burger aficionado. \n\nFries....................tasted a little stale. Just wasn't good and not very impressed. \n\nService was their saving grace. Service was excellent. There's is definitely room for improvement.

This menu is so full of rich, delicious and decadent goodness, I thought I'd died and gone to heaven.\n\nUnfortunately, if you like professional and refined service, you must simply hope thing have improved by the time you give it a try. Yikes.\n\nThe complimentary popovers are tasty, though no, not as good as those at The Rotunda. But at least the butter is nice and soft. The appetizer selection is good, though either my whole party of 6 lacks refinement, or the bone marrow nonsense is a trend that should die. What about this bland, congealed fat yuck is good? Ew! I'm glad I gave it a try, and I'm glad never to do it again. Might I suggest focusing instead on the avocados and hearts of palm (one of the only \"light\" things on the menu). The figs are also outstanding. \n\nThe menu really outdoes itself in the entree department. I struggled to decide between the fried chicken (which I ultimately tasted - very good), the pork (which I ordered - great!) and the Sunday chicken pot pie special (sold out - damn). The burger also sounded great and looked every bit as worth $18 as a burger can be when I saw one float by our table. Whatever you order, definitely add a couple of sides. Might I recommend the fries, mac 'n cheese (amongst the very best I have had) and creamed corn (delish with a spicy kick!).\n\nDesserts didn't disappoint, thankfully. The banana pudding and cobbler/crisp were both really good. There was some chocolate goodness as well, but now that I think about it, my fork didn't make it into that dish somehow - clearly my bad!\n\nThe only downside of this dining experience was the service. I am not going to say anything bad about our waiter because I honestly think he was trying his hardest. But management should be ashamed of themselves for putting such a junior waiter in the position of serving a table of 6 at 8:00 on a holiday weekend. This poor guy couldn't even pour wine without his hands trembling. It actually was uncomfortable to watch. He (and others who served us) kept asking our party to pass them plates and shuffle things down because they couldn't figure out how to move around the very long booth that accommodated us. At one point, a server warned someone in the party that her plate was \"truly hot,\" and then proceeded to hand it to the guy in the middle to pass it down to her. Good idea. \n\nAgain, I don't mean to disparage these folks, who were obviously trying and said \"please\" maybe TOO many times...but the amateurish service just did not match the high quality food or the sky high prices (our bill came to almost $500 and included a 20% gratuity - WOW). \n\nStill, I will definitely return because this is comfort food at its best (minus the marrow) in an atmosphere that suits it beautifully.", "author": "Kiesha R."}

We had a big booth for the six of us on the ground floor, a pretty great spot to take in all the action.\n\nBeing in such a large group, I was able to taste a number of items. The clear winners were the grilled calamari (my favorite dish of the night) the deviled eggs, the fried chicken, the creamed corn and the roasted bone marrow. I had the burger and it while it was a solid burger, I didn't love the bun. I have no problem paying $18 for a burger but for that price I expect perfection and this fell just a bit short. The fries were good but not quite hot enough.\n\nService was fantastic from start to finish - the bartender, the cute hostesses and even the manager who stopped by our table a number of times to check in all treated us like royalty and all seemed genuinely happy to be there.

Then I learned it's Chef Tyler Florence's new restaurant.  She is a huge fan.\n\nTo get a table for dinner on a Wednesday night we waited patiently for TWO weeks.  I was slightly skeptical that the name contained the word \"tavern\", half expecting it to be a casual place with sailors toasting with pints of beer....    Well it wasn't quite like that.   \n\nWe were warmly greeted by the hostess and lead to our table upstairs.  My friend and I couldn't help ourselves but ogle at Chef Florence who was in the open kitchen, and ho!  he waived at us with a friendly smile!  \n\nThe menu offered many tempting options and it took a lot of back and forth among the three of us to negotiate what to order.  In the end we got: \n\nFigs on a plate (with melty fresh burrata)-simple and delicious with perfectly ripe figs.\nSalt roasted bone marrow (a whole shank halved and topped with parsley shallot salad, capers, and served with a side of toasted sourdough bread drizzled with molasses butter)-the richness of the marrow appropriately offset by the pickled shallot and great with the sweetness of the molasses butter\nOrganic fried chicken-apparently one of the most popular items but a little dry and under-seasoned on my order\nWayfare Burger-huge and tasty\nwith side orders of French fries and (chunky) creamed corn\nThe cocktails were also delicious.\n\nFor dessert we shared the pineapple upside down cake (with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream, macadamia nut brittle, and a fresh cherry)--I asked our server, \"will the pineapple upside cake be really better than MY version?\" to which he replied \"If it is not, I will buy it for you\".  Oh well, needless to say, HE WON.   He was kind enough to say \"I am sure your cake is just as good, just different\".  The truth is, it's the salted caramel ice cream that really takes the combination to a whole new level.  The buttery sweetness of caramelized sugar and pineapple slices of the warm cake combined with the salty bits in the melting cool ice cream--it was special indeed.\n\nThe service was attentive, professional, and friendly to the end, even when we asked a million and a half questions about the food.

Any restaurant with a celebrity chef attached to it could easily become a recipe for disaster, but I found Wayfare to be fairly low key with fantastic food and excellent service; a great addition to the city. I am a fan and I will be back.", "author": "Joe C."}

We came here opening week, and experienced a few hiccups in the service. \n\nThe appetizers were hit or miss.

Fried chicken was very juicy, with a thin batter, relying on fresh herbs for flavor. The sirloin on the bone was cooked perfectly medium rare, fresh and juicy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-07-02", "description": "I have a little confession to make.  The main reason I wanted to try Wayfare Tavern was because I have a small crush on Tyler Florence.  He and Bobby Flay are my two favorite Food Network stars!  So I think I already made up my mind that I will love eveything about this restaurant even before I set foot in it.  I have to add that this review has been in my draft box since February and is long overdue.\nOur whole dining experience was pleasurable, from the service to food, drinks and ambience.  The wine list was extensive but we opted to order cocktails instead.  I don't remember the name of my drink but it was made of caramelized pineapple syrup, Ginger and pisco sour.  It was so good, I could've drank a whole gallon of it.  My husband had the traditional Nigroni drink.  His only complaint was that it came in a small martini glass.  \nWe read some of the reviews on Yelp about Wayfare Tavern and we were curious to see why people loved the \"popovers\" so much.  We had no idea what it was and we looked for it on the menu but couldn't find it anywhere.  So we finally asked our waiter and he explained to us that the bread they serve to the diners are called \"popovers\".  We couldn't wait to try it!\nIf I had a huge stomach, I would've eaten a dozen of those popovers!  They are that good!  They bake them individually in a muffin pan and fill each container up to the rim so that they \"popover\" the sides of the container when they're baked.\nMy husband and I split the Yellowfin Tuna and fried oysters for appetizer.  The combination of fresh ahi on top of a crispy fried oyster was new to me.  The two worked really well together-it was a harmonious blend of crunch and chewiness.  \nEveryone on Yelp raved about the Fried Chicken so we decided to get it along with the Pot roast.  \nThe fried chicken was, hands down, the BEST fried chicken we have ever tasted.  It was flavorful, moist and crunchy!  The mixture of herbs and spices that came with it were unique and refreshing.  No wonder it's so popular.\nThe Pot Roast was equally satisfying.  It was succulent and flavorful.  I immediately smelled the aroma of truffle as soon as they set the plate down in front of me.  This dish was made with veal jus and came with truffled onion confit and a side of whipped potatoes.  I usually can't finish my food but this time, I forced myself to finish my plate because I didn't want any of it to go to waste.\nFor dessert, we split the flourless chocolate cake made with Scharffenberger chocolate.  This dessert can take up to 20 minutes to make so order ahead if you don't want to wait that long.  This dessert is definitely worth the wait though.  It is decadent and delicious topped with ice cream and hazelnut pavlova.  We would definitely come back.\nThe service is impeccable.  They never let our water glasses go empty and they cleared our plates as soon as we were done.  Our waiter was friendly and efficient.  Overall, we had a very pleasant dining experience and we can't wait to try the other dishes on the menu.", "author": "Cherry Ann W."}

We ended up getting a private room (turned out not to be a good thing) because some people cancelled last minute. I didn't get any say since I arrived late because I had just gotten off work. Our server was SUPER condescending. We wanted to share a couple items and he made us feel stupid saying that what we were ordering was barely enough for two. I figured he knew best and went with his suggestion and ordered way too much! We were SO FULL! Took a lot of food togo which we didn't want since we were going to stay out for the night. Maybe he thought we were too young and wouldn't leave a good tip, or was mad because the party that was supposed to be there cancelled. Not sure but it did not make for the best experience. The friend that the dinner was for strongly disliked his attitude. Whenever he would check in it was super casual like we were friends (know your role).

Our waitress was great -  she had a charming French accent and acknowledged the slow kitchen. Our sardines were excellent but my lamb and the baked avocado were uninspired and boring.\n\nFor my second Wayfare experience (July 8th), my friend discovered a rather large FRIED MOSQUITO EATER (???) in her food. We were upset but soldiered on with my birthday dinner. Our waitress kept trying to make up for her inattentiveness and our growing dissatisfaction by offering us things that we didn't want - when my friend found a bug in her food, she asked if she wanted a cocktail to be comped, then a dessert, then an appetizer. Eventually this escalated up the ranks to the general manager (with no words from my friend, just dissatisfied looks) as they comped our entrees and two desserts, which I thought  was generous. \n\nFinally, my third and probably final time at Wayfare.  Third time's a charm, right? Unfortunately, I'm over it the hype. I should've learned my lesson after the second experience.\n\nThey didn't recognize that I had been here 3 times in the last week - I guess I'm not a city celebrity, which is also leads me to the next point of getting shafted by the slow service.\n\nOur reservations were for 9:30 pm but we didn't get seated until 10:15 pm. Drinks came 15 minutes after ordering them and we were eventually served appetizers at 10:45 pm. Then waited for about an hour before we got most of our entrees with the exception of my friend's fried chicken which came 5 minutes later. The fries for my burger were lukewarm, the sea urchin dish tasted like raw seawater mixed with sewage, the soft shell crab (the blue plate special for Friday) was COLD, the cocktails were not to par with other establishments of this caliber, and the service just blew.\n\nNormally, service wouldn't affect my meal that much, but they did not acknowledge our presence at all during the time in between the appetizers and entrees. Unfortunately, there's not much to say about this except that they tried to \"save\" our meal (or their tip) by giving us stale macaroons.\n\nI feel like I'm being generous with 2 stars; the burger and 21 day new york strip were great; but nothing blew me out of the water - you can get better American in trusted establishments all over the city.", "author": "Anthony K."}

I have been very anxious to come to Tyler's restaurant.  So my expections were very high.  We arrived and really enjoyed the historic look of the restaurant. It reminded me of something that would be in Boston.  Then we were brought upstairs and sat at a table so close to another couple...we might have well have been in a four top together.  That was akward, but oh well.  I ordered the special root beer. It was pretty good.  Hubby had diet coke...flat and not that great.  \nPopovers came and they were excellent with the lava salt.  Staff was quick to tell us that was \"lava salt\" but had no idea why it was \"lava\".  \nMy husband had the Burger and I had the fried chicken.\nBurger was average but the kennebeck fries were excellent that came with it.\nMy fried chicken came as is.  Just fried chicken, so I had to order a side. I ordered mac & cheese.  Mac was boring. I didn't mind it, my hubby hated it.  Nothing special.  White sauce with a citrus crumb topping.  The fried chicken had a nice crunchy exterior, but some of the meat looked pink and I got turned off.  \nThe server was dry and cold.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-07-04", "description": "Giving Wayfare Tavern and Tyler Florence less than 5 stars pains me because I was so excited to dine here and I love his cooking shows. But after eating at WT twice since it opened, I have to give it 3.5 stars, primarily due to service issues. I know they're new and are probably still smoothing out the rough spots, but for the amount of money we spent, everything should have been perfect.\n\nVisit #1: Saturday night at 9 o'clock, the place was packed and loud. But waiting in the bar for our table to be ready was fine because I was able to watch Tyler in the open kitchen! My date ordered our drinks. Mine was made quickly, but we waited about 10 minutes before his came. In that time, the bartenders laughed it up instead of making his drink. I don't drink alone, so by the time his came, mine was no longer chilled.\n\nWe were seated upstairs, and I was immediately struck by how unsure our server seemed. I wrote if off as new-job jitters. The carpaccio and deviled eggs appetizers came out fairly quickly. And the deviled eggs were fantastic. I felt silly ordering something I can make at home, but the capers and anchovies (and maybe horseradish?) gave the eggs just the right amount of salty zing.\n\nI'd planned to try the fried chicken, but my friend did, so I went with the lamb two ways. My date had the rib eye. All the entrees were good, especially the chicken. But the other two had some issues. The rib eye, ordered medium rare, was a surprisingly thin cut and closer to medium. My lamb chops were a perfect medium rare, and the braised portion was divinely tender. Unfortunately, the sauce was too salty. I love salt, but this was too much.\n\nService was just ok that night, when I was expecting more from a staff representing Tyler Florence. Our server disappeared for long periods. His wine suggestion wasn't particularly good with our food. And when I asked if they waive the $20 corkage fee if a bottle is also purchased, he didn't know, said he would find out, but never got back to me.\n\n *3 stars for Visit #1*\n\nVisit #2: Surprise birthday dinner night. We all managed to hide in the upstairs bar waiting for our friend to arrive. The bartender was very attentive and made us some of the signature cocktails. The Occidental Sour with elderflower, moscato, and caramelized pineapple syrup is my new favorite!\n\nOur party of 7 was seated about 30 minutes after the 8:45 reservation time--at a table really meant for only 6. Four of us were crammed together on the banquette while the next table over sat empty. Thinking it was reserved for another party, I didn't ask if we could have that table added to ours--but neither was it offered to us. That table remained empty.\n\nIn all, we had two bone marrow orders, deviled eggs, and carpaccio for starters, along with a bottle of pinot noir. I was amazed by the generous bone marrow portions: two halves of a six-inch-long bone. It was my first marrow--and it will not be my last! But serving it would have been easier with a marrow knife or simply smaller utensils.\n\nIn anticipation of our mains, my boyfriend asked Kiyoshi for a wine recommendation, to which he said he'd send over the wine steward. Wine steward? Did they hire somebody after our meal Saturday? Apparently the steward was not to be found after all, but we selected a bordeaux blend.\n\nAfter an extra round of popovers, our entrees arrived: fried chicken, the Wednesday special veal T-bone, rib eye, halibut, steak and eggs, and two orders of the lamb. Everything I tasted was wonderful, but my fried chicken was possibly the best fried chicken I've ever had. The portion was huge, maybe a half chicken, and at $22 is probably the most value for your money on the menu. The lemon, garlic, and rosemary perfectly accentuated the moist, tender chicken encased in crunchy fried goodness. It was so big that I couldn't finish it, so I asked that it be boxed for me to take home, along with the remainder of my side dish of creamed corn.\n\nAfter a requested table visit by Tyler for the birthday girl and a priceless photo op, she also received a complimentary chocolate cupcake with candle. The cupcake was super rich and moist, and won us over more than the good but not amazing pineapple upside down cake and coconut cake.\n\nAt that point, I was thinking 5 stars. Our experience had been so much better than our first time. As we exited the restaurant, we were all very full and happy. Fast forward five minutes to me driving away from the restaurant and realizing I never received my leftover chicken and corn. I immediately turned the car around and went back inside. After I explained what happened to the bartender, the dining manager came down. My leftovers were nowhere to be found, but he did offer me fried chicken on the house when next I return.\n\nWhenever that is. I'm not convinced the third time will be the charm and we'll have a wonderful dining experience from start to finish. After all, a $700 tab didn't ensure a 5-star experience. We'll see.\n\n*3.5 stars*", "author": "Julie K."}

So I was happy to get one for 8:15 pm the following Friday night. (It's actually not that difficult... I think lots of people cancel reservations, so it's easy to get one last-minute. Also, I think they save a lot of tables for walk-ins).\n\nOf the dishes I tried: Calamari tasted a bit burnt. Angels on Horseback (bacon-wrapped dates) were delicious, but anything wrapped in bacon would be, right? Kabocha Squash Soup w/ chestnut & onion ravioli was amazing. Get it. And oh my goodness - their Nor-Cal Mussel Chowder is so good too. It's brothy, kind of like the chowder at Hog Island, but better! And the mussels are large and very fresh. Yes, I think the soups were the highlight of the starters. \n\nThe fried chicken was perfect: very moist and not overly oily. Mac and cheese was good as well, but I think I had really high expectations based on the reviews. So, expect good mac and cheese, but not life-changing. That, you can get at Waverly Inn in NYC ;)\n\nGood service and ambiance. Lots of dark wood, stuffed animal heads hanging on the wall, that sort of thing. Our waiter was really nice, and he was good about asking us if we wanted more popovers, pouring our wine, replacing dishes/utensils. One drawback is that this place is pretty loud and I had to lean in to talk to people across from me. Looking around, I noticed everyone else doing it too.

I was wrong...and unfortunately, I think a lot of the other reviews are as well. \n\nIt is a beautifully set restaurant. The staff is incredible and the service was very attentive. The food's presentation was beautiful, but unfortunately, that is as far as it goes. We had ordered the following:\n\nSalt Roasted Bone Marrow - This came with very crisp sourdough toast slathered with molasses butter. The bone marrow had very little flavor to it and the molasses butter overtook any flavor the bone marrow had.\n\nRaw Sea Urchin - With raw food, it is pretty much a no fail and anything that accompanies it should really enhance the flavor. However, this was paired with the corn puree that overtook the strong flavor of the sea urchin, hence losing the essence of the sea urchin. \n\nRoasted Peppers - They were okay. A bit on the greasy side - which I found odd for roasted peppers.\n\nFried Chicken - Came highly recommended by our friendly waiter. Was moist, but very bland. \n\nHand Cut Pasta - Incredibly bland. It was topped with a lot of ricotta cheese, which is the only thing that really saved it, but even the ricotta did not add much flavor to it. And I'm not quite sure what mushrooms were used, but the mushrooms had no flavor to it either.\n\nBanana Pudding - Our dessert, however, was amazing and to die for. The waiter explained that this was Tyler Florence's father's original recipe. Great job Mr. Florence senior! If you haven't already, you need to open up a restaurant.\n\nOur total bill came to $110.

Certainly not the best I've ever had, but it was a good match for the chicken.\n\nMy boyfriend really enjoyed the burger, but said that the accompanying french fries were off.

It used to have more of a zing and now it was rather bland.  Call me picky but this is the dish that brings me in.  Another thing was that we could not get any fresh popovers.  When warm they are  another draw but these were cold and a little off putting.  All in all I still like this place.  I recommend this place and I have reservations for Monday with another client so we will see how they do then.", "author": "Sam L."}

I'm so underwhelmed by experience at Wayfare Tavern last night. \n\nThe decor of the restaurant is really beautiful and we were seated right at the time of our reservation. But upstairs so I couldn't gawk at the chef, but no big deal. But it was FREEZING cold in the restaurant upstairs. And I almost slipped on the floor and I hit my head on a beam that I was seated under. Maybe I'm just a clutz. I'll let it go. \n\nCocktails. $11 a piece. We had to ask for the cocktail list and after seeing it, we chose our bar standards. \n\nAppetizers were the tomatoes and the deviled eggs. Both of these dishes were fine. There was nothing bad about them but they weren't amazing. The deviled eggs had a nice flavor but a little oversalted. The tomatoes had too much aioli on them. \n\nFor our entrees we had the fried chicken and cheeseburger and a side of macaroni and cheese. The chicken was good, again, but it wasn't amazing and I've certainly had better in the city for less than $22. My boyfriend ordered the cheeseburger medium well. His burger came medium rare. For $18, you would think you could have your burger cooked the way you requested. The macaroni and cheese was so bland. I put salt on it to give it more flavor. The noodles were so overcooked and the sauce just lacked something. I thought this was supposed to be amazing, but again, it wasn't. \n\nThere were floor managers in the restaurant who were attentive but our server totally missed the mark. When I asked him for a wine suggestion, instead of sending over the sommelier, he said, \"I know this one is a good wine (pointing to a wine on the list).\" I was like, \"Nevermind, I'll order this one (a wine I've had before).\" \n\nThe only saving grace was dessert. Get the peach pie. I don't even like peach pie but I would probably go back sometime just to order it. It's pretty amazing and HUGE so definitely share it (you could share it with like 4 people). \n\nI really don't think I'll try this place again. I got to see a glimpse of the chef for like two seconds upon arrival so I got that celebrity fix and now I think, I'm over it.", "author": "Jessica P."}

Come 'on. BUT I was proven wrong b/c this is definitely not KFC status. \n\nWe had our reservations for the past 1.5 months so we could come on a Friday night, and Tyler Florence was cooking in the kitchen! I must say he's pretty cute in real life ::bonus::. The hostess had prepped a table for us upstairs but asked if we wanted to sit downstairs so we could gaze at him some more.....unfortunately we were a party of 5, and the table they offered us was too cramped. :(\n\nWe all shared 2 starters, bone marrow and deviled eggs, 2 sides mac & cheese and fries, 3 entrees - fried chicken, salmon & ricotta ravioli. Finished it off w/ some of the strongest espresso I've ever had that went perfectly w/ the provided ginger snaps. \n\nI was very optimistic about the bone marrow but it was very hard to eat and we didn't discover that it only tastes amazing if you eat it w/ the parsley and chopped onions. So for an entire half of the appetizer we ate the marrow w/ perplexed expressions, wondering why the crispy baguette slices (which there def should have been more of) were so sweet and the bone marrow was so rich yet flavorless. Once you add a sprig of parsley to the mix however, the flavors really come together, and I was convinced. \n\nThe star of the meal was DEFINITELY the fried chicken. So crispy yet tender. Very well seasoned with lots of thyme and the squeeze of lemon on top...PERFECT. I'm not a huge fried chicken fan, but this one really was as amazing as all the reviewers said. \n\nAs for the rest...\n-the mac & cheese: SOOO good. Rich and thick, very creamy. a MUST!\n-fries: don't order the fries- totally overrated\n-deviled eggs: also very good, incredibly creamy w/ a snap provided by capers. Not super memorable but a solid starter. \n-salmon: A solid choice. Get it medium-rare for sure. The uni-butter was a very nice touch, but the fava beans did nothing for me. \n-ricotta ravioli: i could have bought this at costco. definitely do not recommend.", "author": "Teresa L."}

I didn't have reservations but you can just take a seat at the bar if there is room. The bartenders were great and had some awesome recommendations. The chancellor to Austria or some big wig was visiting that night, so his security was everywhere, kinda cool, felt like every move I made was being watched, albeit discreetly and unknowingly. \n\nThe steak tartar was amazingly good, raw egg in the middle, mix it up, and scoop it up on their version of toast points. Seemed kind of like a breadier Yorkshire pudding. Delicious. I shared this with my coworker and we both loved it. \n\nFor our mains, my coworker had the baby back ribs, and I had the steak frites. The ribs were great, fall off the bone, with nice flavor. The steak was cooked to my liking, and served with fries. The fries were a little overdone, and not in the good crispy way. The steak frites (tri-tip) was a little gristly with a lot of sinew. Lots of chewing involved. I still had a great time and devoured my food. I actually ordered the Veal chop, but received the tri tip by accident, no big deal. I'll order it the next time I'm there! \n\nDesert was a warm peach pie with ice cream.

The first time, we were seated at the lowered kitchen counter facing the chefs as they prepared food.  Don't be fooled into sitting there though; there's really not a lot to see as the actual cooking takes place far in the back.  At most, I think I saw some plating and maybe a bit of chopping going on. :\\\n\nThe second time, we were seated at a small table near the fireplace (and the side exit door just in front of the server station).  Needless to say, there was the occasion draft from the door, and we often felt that we were in the way of the servers speeding by.  \n\nNonetheless, the service was wonderful.  Our water glasses were constantly topped off and the timing of the food preparation was adequate.  \n\nOn to the food... My friend told me that she had been watching Tyler Florence on television a while back and he as raving about the wonderful popovers he discovered while dining somewhere.  Well, he bought them to his Tavern and you'll get to see what he meant.  They're light and crispy and served with butter as the bread before your meal.  :P\n\nThe fried chicken was crispy without the standard grease.  Our server informed my dinner companion that the chef \"recommends\" that the lemon on the plate be squeezed onto the chicken--a cute little tip that came off sounding like a valuable insider tidbit that was being delivered just to us because we were special (nice touch).  It didn't come with sides, so it we went with the potato puree which was smooth and buttery, so buttery in fact, that it was collecting at the edges of the dish on my second visit.  \n\nThe grilled tri tip came with crispy thin cut fries.  Tasty!  The steak itself was tender and juicy the first time, but tough and fatty and the second time.  I'm pretty meticulous when it comes to slicing the fat off of my meats, but this cut had way too much of it scattered throughout that I found it difficult to maneuver through.  I eventually gave up and asked for the check.  I tried again the with leftovers the next day in the privacy of my own home.  This time, frustrated, I tossed the knife aside and went at it with my fingers, again, without success.  I ended up throwing out two thirds of that tri tip.  Kind of a waste, but at least the fries were good. \n\nWayfare Tavern has the right idea, but the food can be hit or miss and the seating is not easy to come by.", "author": "Carol Y."}

I won't even try to compare it to the almighty Ad Hoc chicken, but I think it should be good enough to satisfy your SF organic, free range, $22 w/ no sides craving. The chicken is buttermilk brined, coated with a deliciously seasoned batter, then garnished with fried herbs. Squeeze of lemon will make it more reminiscent of Ad Hoc. I got 5 small dark meat pieces which I thought was generous. \n\nUpscale comfort food is nothing new to San Franciscans. Nothing on the menu shocked me, but I thought the food was tasty. $8 mac n cheese is how I'd make it: creamy, mild cheesy noodles topped with breadcrumbs. We had a late reservation so they had run out of their Thursday blue plate special, bbq ribs. So we had the steak and eggs which were topped w/ fried crab and covered in Bernaise. Didn't understand the concept; not bad, but one bite was enough. \n\nI'd definitely come back to try more cocktails and appetizers and there has to be more in his dessert arsenal. We made sure to save room and settled for the pineapple upside down cake because of the salted caramel ice cream (this was comped since our entrees took a long time). And how can I forget about the POPOVERS? Free, in place of bread tide us over until our entrees came. Bumping my 3.5 stars to 4 for the popovers alone. \n\nNo need to rush to the restaurant... taking over this space means Tyler's here to stay.

Some people maybe disappointed that Tyler Florence has taken over the space. Now don't get me wrong, I can't stand Applebee's but the money from that front was the initiator of being able to get him back into cooking in a professional kitchen. I always thought Tyler's Ultimate was a very intelligent show and still watch it to this day. It was better when he traveled to the origin and did an in  depth study of the history of the  dishes he was re-creating, but I'm sure that got cost prohibitive for the show production after a while. Also let's not forget that he once worked for Charlie Palmer at Aureole, so I was curious to see what he could produce after watching his programs after all these years of just observation.\n\nAs I said, I don't know what Rubicon looked like before but Wayfare as it is now is a beautifully renovated space with retro/vintage decor highlighting almost speakeasy  style flair. The first floor boasts a large bar area with booth dining. As you make your way to the second floor there's another small bar area and the main dining room with the small private party pool table area in the back. Finally on the third you find the private dining area with a decent sized wine cellar. \n\nWe actually arrive half an hour earlier than our reservations but were seated immediately anyways. I was actually hoping to hang out at the bar and have a few cocktails before the meal to take in the ambiance but letting the lesser night owls in my group eat before their bed time was eagerly accepted. After mentioning speakeasies, I'll first half to talk about the bar program. Wayfare has the employ of Josh Harris and Scott Baird aka the Bon Vivants, who are turning around some of the City's bar culture with interesting crafted cocktails (see 15 Romolo). I started out with a Leidesdorff, named after a former City Treasurer, that contains Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Benedictine, Royal Combier, Orange Muscat, lemon, egg white, cinnamon tincture. I'm a big fan of the old school drinks (yes some people think my soul may have grown up during the depression or something)  and the Leidesdorff creation did not disappoint. \n\nAfter receiving a round of drinks, we did some cross consulting and ordered the following:\n\n-DEVILED EGGS ~ mustard yolks, San Francisco sea salt, crispy anchovy and capers\n-SALT ROASTED BONE MARROW ~ shallot pickles, herbs, molasses and toast\n-SELECTION OF COUNTRY HAMS ~ Interestingly enough there was one from Oakland, though I forget where the other one was from\n-EMIGH FARMS LAMB CHOPS ~ braised shoulder, ricotta dumplings, corn, carrots, and marjoram\n-WAYFARE BURGER \"LE GRAND\"~ grass fed beef brisket, Cowgirl Creamery cheese and bacon\n-PETIT FILET MIGNON - With crab (I forget the sauce)\n-HALIBUT Fish Special (I believe) - with Romano beans and clams\n-PEACH PIE - with goat's milk ice cream\n-BANANA PUDDING - soaked vanilla cookies, banana custard, fresh banana and meringue\n\nThe food was exactly as I imagined it; it's gussied up comfort food. I thought it was delicious all around and the number of things I wanted to try on the menu was quite vast. I definitely want to return and try more food. Now I thought some of the items were on the pricey side (hams) while some of the others were more than reasonable. Overall, pretty good price performance value. There were some lulls in the delivery but for just opening such a large place, it was quite smooth. Our server was very cool and when the clams (the only big hiccup for us) were forgotten on the fish special, one of the floor managers got to it immediately and said the Chef himself cooked them up. Whether that was just to make us feel better who knows, but it was taken care of. \n\nAs we were leaving and I was getting my car, the gawkers in my party watched the Chef and his family finally sit down and have a meal. I think they looked back at us wondering \"what are those people staring at?\" :)\n\nBeautiful space, solid food, and interesting drinks. I'm sold. 4.25 stars", "author": "Kim N."}

Super glad that he opened his first restaurant---Wayfare Tavern, here in the City!!!!  This was the old Rubicon restaurant. I worked in the financial district for years and glad to see Rubicon go. But it was time. \n\nThe best thing about Tyler Florence (and this restaurant) is that he is usually in the kitchen as he was last night. \n\n We had the deviled eggs, and it was the best I've had ever! The egg white was soft, but not rubbery and the yolk filling was so so smooth & silky. My wife is not a fan of deviled eggs, but she is now.  Our server & the manager suggested we order the Fried Chicken. Do I argue with them? No. The chicken (comes in four pieces) was crispy on the outside and so tender & juicy on the inside.  I will almost never ordered fried chicken nor do I ever crave it, but this was super good. Again, simple basic food--done superbly. We also ordered grilled asparagus--it was perfect- crunchy, not wilted nor over seasoned. The avocado salad was so tasty because the avocado was was ripe, a hint of cilantro, lime, olive oil & the special Asian black pepper they use just fuses all the best elements of the ingredients. \n\nBottom line here: it's a simple menu that is prepared, presented very well. And the food is outstanding with generous portions. Yes, you heard that correctly from a big eater. Ok, this is no surprise: you may have to wait for awhile even if you have a reservation. Lots of big groups will here here, plus the \"tourists\" will hang around to try to speak with Tyler and take photos with him.  Let's just say, that it's not necessarily a fast meal. My recommendation is to make a reservation LATE--like 9:30pm or 10pm. If you want to be 3-5 ft away from Tyler Florence, ask to be seated in the bar style seats in front of the kitchen.  Not the bar area seats now, but in front of the chefs & line cooks. Our server was a rockstar!!!! We had an awesome time and look forward to dining at Wayfare again.", "author": "Al G."}

The preparation here is a baked omelette, with fried oysters inserted into the omelette while baking.  Dry eggs, overcooked, overbreaded oysters.  Three strips of good quality, smokey bacon on top do not save the dish.  Also, the proportions are off, way too much egg for the amount of oysters and bacon.  If you want a good hangtown fry, head to Brenda's, Just For You, or even Tadich.  Do not get it here.\n\nOn the plus side, everyone loved the steak tartare, nice quality beef with a higher fat content (like beef butter).  It could use a bit more seasoning (mustard, Worcestershire), but minor quibbles.\n\nAlso, the beets with grapefruit olive oil were great, as was the creamed corn, not overcooked, a lot of crispness and sweetness to the corn.\n\nOn the okay side, mac and cheese and fries were decent, nothing special.  The folks who had the burger said it was tasty but too salty.  The fig and burrata salad had high quality ingredients, but the combination was neither objectionable nor particularly interesting.  Ho hum.\n\nTo be honest, the menu is a bit boring.  Fried chicken, steak and eggs, pork chop, leg of lamb.  And for such standard food, the prices are high.  Considering that more than a few entrees are a la carte, the price point is around Boulevard (maybe a hair less) and the food is not nearly as interesting or delicious.

But the man seriously can put a good spin on down home cooking that makes you feel comforted.  It's comfort food at a whole new level.\n\nWe'd been dying to try this place since it opened, BUT as anyone can attest who has tried to come here on short notice - \"fooorgeeet about it\"  Fortunately, we were able to get reservations (10:15 p.m. on a Thursday, mind you).\n\nAmbience:  Lodge feel, or English bar type feel.  Small inside with high ceilings.  Long bar.  Loud, but not noisy.  \nFood: Stellar\nService:  Grand, attentive, fun\nDrinks: cannot comment on anything other than the wine, which was very good\n\nWe got there early and there were seats open at the Counter, which we decided to take because then we could see where the magic happens.  That was our second best decision.  The first was just coming here. \n\nThere are many dead animals hanging on the wall, but tastefully done.  Not tacky and it aids in the feel of the Lodge, or Montana/English bar type feel.  Exposed beams, dark blue wall.\n\nIt is on a side street with nothing around.  Be prepared to need to go over a block or have them phone a taxi for you.\n\nAt the counter we were immediately brought pop overs.  Light, cheesy topped (I think Asiago) and lightly salted.  They  literally melt in your mouth.  Salted butter comes out with it, which isn't a necessary, but is sooo good.\n\nThe people seated next to us got the bone marrow.  I am not that experimental (I kept thinking people donate theirs to leukemia patients so I can't eat that), but my date did.  He indicated it was the best he ever had.  Being the foodie he is, I will take his word on the subject.\n\nI don't remember what the special was, but I do remember my meal:  FRIED CHICKEN.  Now, for someone whose only experience with fried chicken is KFC (so sad) I knew it would be a significant improvement.  I don't recall my mom ever making it in my household, and there are only a handful of times I had it at KFC...so I was expecting something wonderful. \n\nIt is a perfectly crispy browned chicken.  And a LOT of it.  Rosemary garnish, and not overly greasy like it was just left in friers (and it wasn't, we could see in the kitchen).  \n\nRest of the menu:\n\nBeets (I love them)  So many beets, so little time.  Some kind of vinegrette tossed on them.

The previous times we've come, we left was a jaw dropping 'wow' because the dishes were blow your mind terrific.  This last time the umph was gone, and although I'd go back,  I'm hoping this was just a fluke...hence a 2 star deduction for now since nothing set this experience apart.  \n\nIt almost seems like they have made their impression, but now can sit back and enjoy the ride.  In this city, with places popping up all over the map, you can't take anything for granted.  I will give this another shot when the menu changes, but this menu was sub-par. \n\nStarting with the apps, we got a salad, oysters and the lobster corn chowder.  Salad was fine and as unique as you can make salad (not my style, but the table enjoyed), the oysters yum (but I'm not giving any restaurant props for serving raw oysters...note these were pricey compared to other places).  Now the soup...whoa this was tasty...a creamy brew with lobster and corn.  The plate was licked clean.  So far so good and comparable to our previous visits.\n\nNow the reasons for the deduction: the mains.  The previous times we have come, the mains seemed like they just had some effort put on them if that makes sense.  The 2 fish dishes were very simple, with a seared then baked fish (the halibut was a bit overcooked, the salmon was fine).  However, it was such a simple prep compared to last time I was underwhelmed...in essence there was nothing that made me remember this dish compared to other places I've had similar eh fish dishes in the city that I have easily trashed.    We got a duck dish, and it was enjoyable by the table, but didn't seem to blow the eater away (the portion size of this was actually huge which wasn't necessary).  The sidekick got the vege dish.  You may stop reading and not care about the vege option, but please note this: the first time was this unbelievable grits dish, then an amazingggg pumpkin ravioli, now some brown rice risotto.  The dish was ok, but not worth it as a main, and simply not up to par for a place like this.\n\nWe went with the waitress recommendation of the chocolate pudding cake, and although edible, again was nothing like the wow factor of previous visits.  I was still raving about the buttery apple crisp with the caramel ice cream that I was pissed other people were eating from the last visit.  This time there was cake left over, and the crust seemed under buttered and off.  It wasn't any better than a pastry shop in town. \n\nNow the service and facility are still great, but I'm not here for that.  I hope you haven't made the money and moved on, or letting lazy chefs conjure up lazy food.  That's what it felt like this time, but lets see...", "author": "A A."}

It's a little tight with a first floor sitting area and bar with stairs by the entrance that lead to a second floor with a sitting area and a four or five stool bar. We had the oxtail poutine which was rich, flavorful and the perfect blend of fries meat gravy and cheese. Highly recommend! The grilled octopus was delicious but could've used more squid. Show us the squid! And I usually don't eat raw meat, but the kobe beef tartare was really good folded into a warm popover. \nI went with the short rib I believe in some type of beet reduction sauce. So good!  A little bread to soak up the sauce. Perfect!  I also tried the famous fried chicken. It was very flavorful but a bit light on the crisp, but overall I would probably order if I go again. Of course, the Syrah wine went very well with everything!  The only thing I wasn't a Fan of was their policy on not being able to sit until your full party is present  a friend was running late (literally running because no cabs) and we were holed up by the door with people coming and going.

SUPER impressed. We came in for an early dinner on a Saturday. Seated right away. Service was awesome. Food was AMAZING. We got 2 apps: the deviled eggs which had a hint of curry, and the escargot which was in a pesto sauce. Best escargot I have ever had, despite the non-traditional preparation. Both fantastic. Entrees were the veal and salmon, both great as well. Veal came with a panzanella and the salmon was set over a nice potato salad with a caviar garnish. We also tried 2 sides: asparagus & salt roasted potatoes. Everything was amazing. $140 is a steep price tag for dinner, but for the quality of dinner we had plus the 3 glasses of wine, we really got what we paid for. I will definitely be back.\n\nP.S.

Usually give restaurants at least a couple of months before you really judge the experience, and let me say a couple of months wasn't long enough for this restaurant. \n\nWe had a 9:15 rez and in the time we were waiting (we didn't get sat until 10) we had drinks at the bar. The drink menu is terrible (as someone who has been a bartender I feel qualified to say this) luckily the bartender on duty saved the situation by making decent cocktails of his own. \n\nThe service was friendly, helpful and attentive.\n\nThe food was lackluster.

It had the star chef, the awesome interior - pool room and all, and a \"proprietary grind\" for their burger that TyFlo gushed about. Unfortunately my lunch experience there was so bad it was bordering on slapstick by the time we left.\n\nAfter waiting a little for our table to be ready we went upstairs to be seated. It really is a gorgeous space and pulls off the high-class saloon vibe to a T. \n\nI ordered the \"Le Grand\" burger and my wife - a salad. After waiting for half an hour I asked our waiter about the food and he told us it's coming momentarily. Incidentally, while the place was busy when we got there it was half-empty by this point. We had to wait another half hour before a different waiter came back and informed us that the there was an \"issue\" with the kitchen and that our order would, for realsies this time, be here momentarily and that she would comp us a desert as thanks (never mind the fact that by this point I just wanted to get back to work). \n\nWhen the food arrived my wife's tomatoes were not ripe, and the rest of the salad was just a few bland greens. The burger was decent at best, but nothing compared to the Burger Bar or Taylor's. After finishing off our entries quickly, since my burger was tiny and my wife's salad was half inedible, we got the dessert - a banana pudding. I will say that this was stellar. In fact it gets its very own star. From the meringue to the cookie crust it was absolutely perfect. \n\nIn fact this pudding was so damn good that when the fire alarm started blaring right above our table I continued eating it. Befuddled by proper fire procedure the restaurant's staff turned up the music to drown out the fire alarm. This did not work. I continued eating my pudding, as my wife got more nervous and both of us got more deaf.\n\nYou would think that with a fire alarm going off above our heads the waitress helping us would try to get my card and bill back to me quickly, but that was not the case. I guess she didn't want to interrupt my enjoyment of the pudding? Upon receiving the bill we left, getting a \"sorry about that - we're just starting our lunch program\" from the manager. I guess this was also everyone's first day working in a restaurant?\n\nIt seems that the prevalence of positive reviews have been from people who are crushing on Mr. Florence with all the intensity of teenage girls on \"Team Edward\". Nothing wrong with that, but unless you're obsessed with the man enough to affect your taste buds Wayfare Tavern is a way's away from stellar.", "author": "Max G."}

I've met him a few times at varoius demos and at the Food Network Festival in NYC a few years ago. He's a sweetheart and very approachable.  Regardless, I've learned to keep my expectations somewhat low at celebrity chef's restaurants as I've been bitten in the booty once or twice before. However, there was no need for booty guarding here as TF really outdid himself!  \n\nEverything we ordered was almost better than the previous dish. \nWe started out with the deviled eggs and the roasted beets. Both were VERY good but the real stars at WT are the entree courses.  We deciced to order three entree dishes and share so we got the buttermilk fried chicken (recommended by several friends), the wild mushroom grits, and the pot roast. We also ordered a side of the mac n cheese.  Although the fried chicken was as delicous as everyone had said, the three of us agreed that the pot roast and the grits were really the stars on our table. The pot roast was literally melt-in-your-mouth delicious... braised for 48 hours and literally like butter to slice with your fork.  As for the grits, I like grits but have never been what you'd call a 'fanatic' about 'em but OMG, these grits could turn anyone into a grit-aholic! They were super creamy and slathered w/goatcheese, pine nuts and these fabulous meaty mushrooms. I could've just eaten a big bowl of these and been a happy happy girl! \n\nDessert was sticky toffee pudding and steamed lime pudding cake. The toffee pudding was good but a tad dense for my taste after such a rich heavy meal. The lime pudding cake, on the other hand, was the perfect ending to our night.

The burgers were tasty ($19 for very fresh meat, brie, griddled onions, home made aoli, and unfortunate-tasting not-quite-dill pickles).  The atmosphere is clubby/old-world.  The fireplace is a very nice touch (unfortunately it's gas, not real).  Ideal place for any civilized business lunch.  Or cocktail hour.\n\nThe only thing that rubbed us the wrong way was that they charged for EVERY Coke we drank - $3/pop.  Oye!  Don't all nice restaurants like this offer free refills?

I returned hoping to have a better experience than the first, yet this experience was worse. Upon entering the restaurant, the hostess did not greet us with a smile, instead she seemed more bothered that we had even stepped foot in the restaurant. We inquired about seating for lunch, she made a near annoyed response about open seating in \"section with white tile\". We sat ourselves at the two empty chairs at the bar.  During our time sitting at the bar we received splashes of water and alcohol as the bartender was a bit aggressive in his movements, resulting in spatters of poured drinks on us. One time we received such a splash that the bartender chuckled as he apologized. After sitting for a bit and waiting and waiting and finally a waiter, in passing, inquired if we had been helped did we receive service.  The food arrived fairly quickly. We began to eat our food, my wife mentioned repeatedly that her dish (Mushroom Poutine),  one she has ordered previously, was not similar to her previous experience. Indeed it wasn't, the menu reads \"hand cut potatoes\" but today's dish strangely entailed day old, dry steak fries. Additionally, there was barely, if any, roasted vegetable gravy as the menu indicates. Her poutine dish basically was steak fries, topped with some mushrooms, tidbits of mozzarella, and a piece of kale. After choking what we could of our food down and clearly finished with our food we waited 25 minutes before any waiter sought to attend to our needs, at which we stated \"check please\" and informed him of the awful poutine. Truly, with so many other high class and better serviced restaurants in San Francisco, seek to enjoy a great meal elsewhere, and save yourself from the poor food and service at the Wayfare Tavern.", "author": "Kimberly S."}

I liked the ambience and decor, although the top 40s hip hop music felt inappropriate alongside the rest of the tavern.  \n\nThe five of us were seated in a long booth, which felt cozy until the our waitress tried pouring us water/serving us popovers - she could not reach anything; the booth arrangement was extremely inconvenient, especially since it was such a long one. \n\n- Popovers: good!\n\n- Steak tartare: very generous with the portions (I think we got a full serving). It was good, but a little too much.\n\n- Roast duck: best entree of the night. tender and very flavorful.\n\n- Pork shoulder with truffle mashed potatoes: i love mashed potatoes. The pork was tender, but I expected more of a wow-flavor.\n\n- Hangtown fry: what? this was weird. The description sounded really good, but it was a definite miss. The portion was too much and there was nothing memorable about it.\n\n- Fried Chicken: we ordered this because my foodie friend heard it was the thing to get here. We shared it between the five of us, and every single piece was too dry except for hers, which was severely undercooked. We asked for it to be taken back, and the waitress brought out a new plate of chicken, and all the chicken was cooked perfectly, but it was not too pleasant seeing a bloody piece of friend chicken.\n\n- Mac n Cheese: YUM. But I suppose you can't really go wrong with mac n cheese? I'm a big fan of cheese. delicious.\n\n- Complimentary Ginger Cookies that came with the check: BEST PART OF THE NIGHT. which is kind of sad. I generally don't like ginger cookies, but they had just the right amount of ginger flavor and sweetness. \n\nIt was a little pricy for the quality of the food we got, and no one ordered drinks. All in all, a little disappointed.", "author": "Julia C."}

Friday afternoon, around 3pm.  The atmosphere was just hopping enough so that we didn't feel weird being ravenous for dinner food at 3 in the afternoon.  The service was impeccable -- attentive, helpful with suggestions, and prompt.  And the food . . .  wow!  If the food is as good next time as it was this time, I'll definitely upgrade them to 5 stars.\n\nPoutine: the \"gravy\" in the poutine was so good, it was more like a demi-glace in the perfect quantity.  The fries were thin and crispy, and the dish came together well in a contemporary, non-homestyle way.\n\nSteak tartare: the tartare was not what I expected, but it was really good, just very rich.  I personally prefer my tartare with a bit of acidity to cut the richness, but if you are in the mood for a decadent dish, this one delivers.\n\nOysters: very fresh.\n\nDeviled eggs: the yolk was very smooth and creamy, but didn't have a kick.  If you like yours to have a kick, then you may not like this classic, but it was a wonderfully executed classic.\n\nBroccoli side: yummy!  such a nice mix of broccolis, and flavors to complement.\n\nMac and cheese: this came out piping hot, with a perfectly baked top.\n\nSticky toffee pudding with ginger ice cream: the pairing of the ginger, on top of a bed of crispy gingered brown sugar, and a not-too-sweet toffee pudding was the perfect finish to a flawless meal.", "author": "Lisa S."}

The host was friendly and sat us right away.\n\nWe looked over the menu and just could not make up our minds, so we threw our diner to the discretion of our waiter who seemed to know the menu inside and out and let him choose for us. (Which from reading some of the other reviews helped us avoid possible pitfalls)\n\nAs we anxiously waited for course one, we were gifted a basket of hot-out-of-the-oven pop overs! These bakery treats were light fluffy and melted in our mouths. Such a nice change from the tired french, sourdough and focaccia bread that seems to have the restaurant bread market cornered.\n\nFirst course brought us such delights as: \n\nDeviled eggs: (best I've ever had) \n\nBurrata: with warm greens. Oh Burrata, so light and creamy, like buttered angle kisses.\n\nRoasted Bone Marrow: If the burrata was angle kisses, surely you are the devils temptress. So wrong--but oh so right!\n\nMain Course had a hard act to follow with those apps.\n\nOrganic Fried Chicken: Who the hell orders fried chicken at an upscale joint? Well, if it tasted this good--who would order anything else!? \nbuttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herbs and lemon butter, GO KICK ROCKS Col.

These ribs are MONEY!\n\nSalmon Vichyssoise: thyme infused potato soup, smoked salmon roe, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche & celery. OK Seriously at this point I was so indulged I felt like Nero.\n\nDessert:\nUMMMMM, pop-overs, Deviled eggs, Bone marrow, Burrata, fried chicken and pot roast!

I had heard good things about Wayfare Tavern, although I'm not generally swayed by celebrity chef-owned restaurants.  In my experience, they are often overrated.  In short, I wasn't prepared for how much I would enjoy my dinner at WT.  \n\nThe menu perfectly compliments the ambiance.  They work in concert to provide an excellent experience. \n\nI started with the Tomales Bay Mussels.  I was absolutely intrigued at the concept of a starter combining local mussels, pork belly, and sweet potatoes in a herbsaint cream.  I'm now a fan.  What a unique combination of flavors and textures!  \n\nLamb shank, in some ways, is the test of a quality kitchen.  It's so often done poorly.  My entree, the Guinness Braised Lamb Shank, knocked it out of the park for me.  The lamb was perfectly medium rare, and amazingly tender.  This entree was prepared and executed in the sort that makes you want to slap the passionless chefs who have nearly ruined this type of dish for you in the past (okay, that was a little overboard, but you catch my drift)!   It was accompanied by carrots with an orange glaze and whipped potatoes with horseradish.  Completely satisfying.    \n\nI'm really looking forward to my next visit.  The only WAY to make my WAYfare experience WAY better, is to experience it with my WAY-cool wife of 17 years.  Next time, no co-workers!  Ha!! (Just kidding, gents!)", "author": "Jeffery G."}

My friend calls Wayfare Tavern and attempts to book a table for four, expecting to be declined because the last 5 times we tried we were unsuccessful.  But no, we got a table.  It was like hitting the jackpot.  \n\nFast forward 2 months and we are sitting in the upstairs dining area of this gorgeous restaurant.   The ambiance is amazing.  The crowd is a mixture of different age groups, all having a great time.  It is an energetic crowd.   \n\nWe came here for the first time this past Friday.  The service was amazing from start to finish.   Among the four of us, we ordered 14 items.  Yes, we are fond of food.  For appetizers, we ordered the mussels, grilled squid, deviled eggs and the bone marrow.  They were all fantastic.  We were also each given a warm popover.  It was excellent.\n\nFor our entrees, we had the crab louis salad, the hangtown fry, the burger, and the salmon.  We ordered two side dishes, the mac & cheese and the brussel sprouts to enjoy with our main dishes.   They were all very deiicious and the servings were big.  My favorite was the hangtown fry.  It is an egg dish with an amazing creamy sauce served with bacon and fried oysters.   They do not call it \"the dying man's last dish\" for no reason.\n\nAs for dessert, again we went all out.  We tried the carrot cake, rocky road, fried apple pie, and sticky toffee pudding. My favorite was the carrot cake.  It was surprisingly light and creamy.  It is not the traditional super sweet and heavy carrot cake I'm used to.   The rocky road is fudge served alongside marshmallows and toffee popcorn.  This was good, but not as good as the others.  The fried apple pie served with a scoop of lime ice cream was to die for.  But then again so was the sticky toffee pudding.  My friends loved this dessert the most.  \n\nI have only one minor complaint about the bar.  You would think that a restaurant like this would want to keep the drinks coming, but we had to keep on reminding the waiter that we were waiting for them.  This minor setback will not keep me from coming back to try the remainder of the menu.  \n\nOne other tip.  The hardwood floor in this restaurant is extremely slippery!  Be extra cautious especially if you happen to be wearing heels.  \n\nTo sum up this long review, reserve now and maybe you'll get a table in February or March of next year.  It will be worth very second of the wait.", "author": "Gloria Y."}

Not only did I finally get to taste Tyler Florence's food, but I got to watch him in live action!  \n\nBased on Joanna R.'s review, I requested the chef's counter for my boyfriend's birthday (Thanks Joanna!).  Tyler Florence is my boyfriend's favorite celebrity chef, so I knew that he would appreciate sitting right in front of the kitchen.  We sat at the low counter table, which I consider the best seat in the house because it's directly in front of Tyler. \n\nWe had early reservations for 6:15 because opentable.com doesn't have the 6:30-8:30 block available online.  We were able to get street parking right in front, but FYI: Valet parking is cheap- only $10.\n\nThe hostess led us to our table where we met Tyler's beautiful wife, Tolan.  She was so warm and friendly- she even remembered that it was my boyfriend's birthday!  Perhaps it was her that called to confirm my reservation?\n\nWe started with the salt roasted bone marrow.  Wow, those fried capers were a really nice, salty touch!  The entrees took a long time to come out (30-40 minutes?)  Tyler came over, shook our hands and chatted about the bone marrow.  He must have noticed that our plates were empty because he mentioned that our entrees would be out soon.  It took so long that our server (Toshi?) brought back the tiny plates that indicate that popovers should be served.\n\nI ordered the fried chicken, which was fantastic!  I've never had such juicy, tender fried chicken.  I love that it came with fresh lemon wedges, roasted garlic and fried herbs: rosemary, thyme and sage.  My boyfriend ordered the braised lamb.  OMG that was one of the best things I've ever tried in my life!  It was so rich and tender.  The sauce was to-die-for.  I'm now a lamb convert.  \n\nWe ordered the squash and heirloom tomatoes as a side but it never came.  They also didn't charge us for it, so it wasn't a big deal.  However, although the fried chicken comes with 5 pieces (!), it didn't come with any vegetables or sides.  I actually would have preferred less chicken with a side.\n\nWhen my boyfriend left for the restroom, our server told me that they were going to bring him a chocolate cupcake with a lit candle and happy birthday written in chocolate.  Honestly, it was equal parts cake and ganache!  LOVE the salt and chocolate covered crunch on top.  It was very rich, so coffee was great with it.\n\nAlthough the server left two bottles of still and sparkling water at our table, there was always someone ready to refill my glass.  I never had to refill it myself and I drink A LOT of water.  Our server, Toshi?, was very nice and attentive.  I could tell he was busy (the whole staff looked like they were working very hard), so it was really sweet that he brought back the popover plates because I was definitely  hungry waiting for my entr\u00e9e.\n\nThis place is very crowded- you need to walk single file to get anywhere.  However, it was nice because I had 4 inch heels and it wasn't a big deal to walk slowly downstairs to the restrooms in the basement. \n\nI forgot to mention that while we were waiting for our entrees, Sammy Hagar stopped by for dinner with Tyler's wife.  On our way out, we took a picture with Tyler, said thank you to Tolan and shook Sammy's hand.  I have to admit that he has quite soft hands for a musician.  And I really think it's refreshing that his wife is not only beautiful but most importantly, age appropriate.\n\nI will most definitely come here again!!!  We've already made plans to come next month! haha", "author": "Teena O."}

(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=-fKeOo0d0k1_e2r6Oe1Oow)\n\nBeing the ambitious eaters that we are, we went a little overboard with our ordering and got 5 appetizers, 2 entr\u00e9es, 2 sides, and 1 dessert to share. Most restaurants will serve your food in a staggered manner so as to not overwhelm you with food. Wayfare Tavern is not most restaurants - our 5 appetizers all came at the same time. Not only was there not enough room at our table but some dishes got cold before we even touched them.\n\nOur meal started with the amazing complimentary popovers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=ylFuV1UtJwcRqsrNxf4Fiw). Fresh out of the oven, they were crispy, airy, had a slight eggy flavour, and weren't too greasy. They looked big but weren't that filling since they're hollow inside (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=mBK4ts-ztb1VxOYTat8ydg).\n\nAfter the fantastic popovers, I had high hopes for the rest of our meal. Unfortunately, my expectations weren't met. First, the appetizers (which as I mentioned ALL came at once). I wasn't a fan of the very thick Heirloom TOMATO BREAD SOUP (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=jHmhYgj3BZ57TBxy_lhFUQ). It had very bold flavours (e.g. garlic) but was way too acidic and salty. The croutons were great in the beginning but got really soggy not long after. As for the salt roasted BONE MARROW (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=OjTueX3NkVxXjqA-7PT07g), heart attack alert! It was a very, very rich dish - imagine eating pure chunks of fat. Unfortunately, it wasn't that flavourful and could've used more salt (unlike the parsley-shallot salad it came with, which was so salty it was inedible), though I really liked the molasses buttered sourdough toast. While I thought the seared FOIE GRAS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=qrr4JNYeKbxpMxIz6nQuLw) was cooked perfectly, the huge plums it came with were extremely tart and overwhelmed the foie. The ingredients in the roasted OYSTERS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=Okuk0oSS8ETELWEp5xJ8pg) were very flavourful but I would've liked to been able to taste the oysters themselves more. The STEAK TARTARE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=7obIWT4jtDxRVcnm_5i8Og) I actually liked. The beef was very finely ground so it had a mousse-like consistency - it was great with the tangy sourdough toast.\n\nFor our entr\u00e9es we just got the hangtown fry and leg of lamb. If you like eggs, you'll love the simple, hearty, and satisfying gigantic omelette that is the HANGTOWN FRY (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=-A7SbE7cYjKJSDZ-vo2naw). 6 to 8 eggs + 3 fried oysters + 3 bacon strips = the ultimate comfort food! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=-ZMb_f_uLTNrC-NecXYSpQ). The LEG OF LAMB (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=eKXspxDYjXXJdN84tsLKiA) wasn't as successful. Though seasoned well, the meat was dry and not that tender. I didn't like the cranberry beans either.\n\nWe were pretty happy with the sides - especially since the portions were huge! The baked MAC & CHEESE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=QGNJAHT8rHuyASSnXYRuYA) was very rich with lots of cheese sauce. It was good, but not great. I liked the CREAMED CORN better (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=gDFO6mYoNqJY7_8DgPCryA) - sweet, crunchy, and slightly undercooked corn kernels with an abundance of cream. Yum!\n\nI wanted to get two desserts but they were out of the peach pie by the time I ordered, so I just got the PINEAPPLE UPSIDE-DOWN CAKE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ykvr3ib1gHQHI4tznSn8iA?select=zNX6JXE960rXTXKdblPUSA). The pineapple was good and the cake was decent. I wasn't a fan of the salted caramel ice cream though; it was really salty but not very caramel-y. Bi-rite's is infinitely better.\n\nWith the ginormous portions of salty and fatty food, Tyler Florence is certainly doing his part in keeping America a country plagued with obesity, hypertension, and high cholesterol!", "author": "Steph L."}

We arrived right on time and grabbed a cocktail at the bar while the hostess checked on our table. We were seated upstairs and enjoyed our popovers while taking forever to make up our minds on what to order. \n\nThe service was fabulous and I was happy to recognize our lovely server from the nail salon I just recently started going to. She was so on top of everything and made our experience that much better. \n\nApps: \nBone Marrow - YUM!! This was my first experience with bone marrow and it was delicious. The bone they bring out is huge! Don't leave without trying this.\n\nPoutine - The meat melts in your mouth! Very tasty. Although it was my first time trying this dish I had spent a good amount of time looking at photos and discussing it with friends....&&&....I expected it to be more cheesy. Not complaining but I am curious to try this at other restaurants to see how it compares.\n\nMains:\nFried Chicken - I was very hesitant to order this dish because I am not usually one to order chicken...especially fried chicken. Thanks to all of the yelpers out there, I went for it and was not disappointed. Such great flavor! Best fried chicken I have ever had.\n\nSteak Frites - One of my friends ordered this and I of course had to try it. Very tasty! The french fries were also delicious.\n\nCrab Louis Salad - After eating the bone marrow, poutine, fried chicken, and trying the steak.....let me tell you, a few bites of salad were definitely in order. This was quite refreshing and the only thing that could have made it better is if I could have halved my chicken with some salad for a more balanced meal. Oh well, SO good! \n\nAll-in-all this was a great dining experience and I would LOVE to come back. Infact, I plan to come back at least for happy hour so I can eye all the sexual business men that come in after work.

My fiance and I were here Saturday night for an early v-day celebration. Our reservation was for 9:30, however we didn't get a table until will after 10. That was our only complaint, although the upstairs bartender was really nice and gave us a drink on the house for our long wait time. Tyler Florance happened to be there and seemed very friendly.. and cute.. :-) I was so bummed though because since it took so long for us to get seated, when we finally were, he was out the door and I didn't get to get my picture with him. \n\nWe were seated at the counter by the kitchen, which was very cool. It was a lot of fun to watch the cooks prepare different dishes. We started with the poutine, which was better than what I remembered. We shared the mac & cheese and sauteed mushrooms for sides, and I had the grilled branzino, fiance had the pot roast, and then we split the flour-less chocolate cake. Everything was amazing. The pot roast was so tender and very truffly tasting. The mashed potatoes were so buttery and fluffy. Food is very heavy and rich, so it's not a place you can eat at every day.. although I wish I could!! \n\nMake a reservation well in advance - I made one at least 3 weeks before and 9:30 was the only available time.", "author": "Kristen V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-20", "description": "Oh wow. A 5-star review for Wayfare Tavern. Shocker. \n\nSeriously though, this was one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. I went with two foodie girlfriends on a Sunday night, so we were excited, focused and determined to Wayfare-ourselves to the fullest. And that we did.\n\nWe were seated upstairs at a spacious table for four, which was great because we were going to need room to spread out. I love the decor - it feels very NYC or Chicago, and frankly, I find it a bit refreshing. I'm a big fan of the sleek, minimal decor (I'm talking to you, Wexler's) and unassuming comfortable elegance (Nopa, that's you), but Wayfare goes in a completely opposite direction and, IMO, nails it. It's rich, it's masculine, it's tasteful...in short, it looks like it would smell like a cigar. And it's cozy, which is great, considering there are few nights in this city that lend themselves well to anything but \"hurry let's get inside it's freezing out here\".\n\nAnd now...to the food. The entire menu is amazing and inventive without going too far off the charts. We started with the seared foie gras and the calamari. I will likely hold a grudge forever over my friends for nixing the steak tartare, but that's a different story. The foie gras was...well, as it should be - like soft rich butter. Served with roasted sour plums - delicious. And the calamari was outstanding - grilled with lemon, garlic, parsley and breadcrumbs. We almost punted on this dish and I'm SO glad it made it to the table - perfectly tender and simple.\n\nFor dinner, it was a simple decision - the steak and eggs. Think the richest, dinner-version of eggs benedict ever. Filet. Asparagus. Roasted Crab. Bernaise. Soft eggs. It was honestly one of the best dishes I've had in a long, long time.\n\nDessert was just as impressive - go with the banana pudding. The waiter told us it's Tyler Florence's dad's recipe. All I can say is why can't MY dad cook like that?!\n\nService was great - knowledgeable, precise and unpretentious. Very reasonably priced considering how delicious the food is and how well taken care of you are.\n\nYum. I'm coming back.", "author": "Kate S."}

Our reservation was for 8, and we show up at 8:05 (we had called the hostess to let her know we were running late).  She said it would be a few minutes, so he had a drink at the bar.  Come 8:30 we still were seated so I go ask the hostess again (she said a lot of tables have their checks, they just need to leave).  We get seated at 8:45 so I'm already annoyed since what is the point of having a reservation if you aren't going to be seated until 45 min after you were supposed to.\n\nOrdered steak tartare, which was reallly good.  My friend ordered a prosciutto something, which was okay, but my tartare was definitely better.  Also had a half dozen oysters, which were okay but I'm not a huge oyster fan anyway (my friend seemed to enjoy them though).  I had the steak and frites as an entree.  It was flavorful, the meat was juicy, the fries were seasoned well.  My friend got the fried chicken which I didn't try but she said it was good.  They also serve this awesome, buttery, delicious popover bread while you're waiting for your food.  \n\nSo if the food was pretty good, why the low rating?  The food took FOREVER.  We didn't leave the restaurant until almost 11:30! I know it was super busy, but a couple that sat down next to us that ordered apps/entrees/dessert finished before us (and they were seated after us).  It got to the point that I was so hungry from waiting for the food that I ate too much popover bread that by the time my steak and frites came, I was pretty much full and couldn't fully enjoy my steak. \n\nWould I try Wayfare again?  Maybe, but there are a few other fine dining establishments I'd go to again/or try first before I cam back here.", "author": "Pornsakdi T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-14", "description": "A number of reviewers have already professed their love for Tyler and I'm not going to disappoint. The dude helped me get over my grill pan prejudice and he's not afraid to use a heavy hand with herbs. Add to that my affinity for his beautiful all things kitchen shop in Marin and I'm sorry, but he's just dreamy.\n\nThe digs at Wayfare are reason enough to check this spot out. Whoever outfitted this place really hit a homerun with the interior. They went with the same hunting lodge theme that a lot of places are doing these days but it seems more elegant and better edited here. Great wallpaper upstairs too. A pool table, beautiful bar, a row of counter seats outside the kitchen to watch the chef's at work, and outdoor seating. Perfect.\n\nThere were four of us and we ordered a ton of food. Creamed corn, baked avocado with crab salad, and marin tomatoes to start. All were terrific, but the corn was the real winner. Creamy and smoky...I'm still trying to figure out how they made \"creamed\" corn with only olive oil. \n\nWe also sampled the fried chicken, halibut, chicken paillard, and corn and goat cheese ravioli. The fried chicken was the standout - so perfectly crispy and piled high with fried but fresh herbs (told you TF wasn't afraid of a little herbage!) and lemon wedges on the side. The paillard was too salty, no doubt due to the hefty sprinkling of bacon lardons but that's what also made it hard to resist.\n\nIgnoring the cries from our overfed stomachs, my fellow diners and I also split the mac 'n cheese. It sounded too good to pass up but I can tell you now, you should. On a menu full of wonderfully reimagined classics, the mac 'n cheese really lacks that flavor punch you'd expect from Mr. Florence, and it's just not worth the stomach space.\n\nHowever, neither our disappointment nor our full tummies stopped us from ordering dessert. We ordered the coconut cake but they also brought us the banana pudding on the house which was fine by me. The pudding was way better than the cake and I'm a sucker for all things banana.\n\nMy absolute favorite thing about Tyler Florence's cooking has always been that he takes classic dishes and succeeds in making them modern, whether by an unexpected use of flavor or herb or the fact that he uses locally grown and cultivated produce. I was superbly pleased to see this shine through in not only his dishes, but reflected in the feel of the restaurant itself.", "author": "Sarah M."}

I enjoy the show Tyler's Ultimate on occasion, so I was interested in trying this place out. That, and I've generally read pretty strong reviews of the place.\n\nMy mother and I came in for a weekday lunch stop. We were first served popovers. Light and airy, with a crispy exterior, they had a subtle cheese flavor. Quite nice.\n\nPOUTINE braised short rib, French fried potato, truffle Jack cheese, veal jus - We started off with the poutine - always a heavy appetizer. The fries were nice and crispy, but I thought there wasn't enough meat. There was one large chunk, and smaller pieces spread throughout, but I felt most of my bites were just the fries and cheese. I liked the addition of the black truffles, though scant. When I could get a bite of fries, meat, cheese and truffles altogether - this was really good.\n\nSEARED WILD ALASKAN SALMON mustard braised brussels sprouts, chanterelle mushrooms, ham hock, smoked honey - I thought it was interesting that they cut this into small chunks before cooking it instead of serving a larger fillet. It was nicely cooked and the addition of the chanterelles was a key component, adding an extra earthy flavor. I liked that the skin was crisped up into something like a chip! The brussels sprouts were tasty - tender and well-seasoned.\n\nPOTATO PUREE shaved truffles - We ordered this one side. The potatoes were very smooth and creamy - nothing exceptional, just a good plate of mashed potatoes. Similar to the poutine, the truffles were primarily an aesthetic feature; there weren't a lot and their flavors were not really evident in this dish.\n\nORGANIC FRIED CHICKEN buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herbs, lemon - This has to be Wayfare Tavern's most popular dish. It's a generous portion of a half-chicken cut up. I thought it was pretty good - the batter was crispy on the outside, and the chicken was pretty moist. However, the white meat wasn't too juicy, but I wouldn't call it dry. Not exactly memorable, but good.\n\nIn all, I would say my meal at Wayfare Tavern was solid. Nothing was particularly memorable, but everything tasted good and there weren't any real disappointments. This is just the first of Florence's planned restaurant openings (Rotisserie & Wine has already opened in Napa) as he builds up his presence in the NorCal area.

As we sat, some walk-ins with no reservations were seated at the counter overlooking the kitchen.  When staff (and there were about 20 people buzzing around who worked there, god knows what they were actually doing) finally came to seat us at 1:40 (reservation was for 1:15), we were seated at the same counter as the people with no reservations.

Burger's is something I rarely indulge in, but watching the guy sitting to my right with his sleeves rolled up, I wanted to push him out of the way and do some serious damage to that burger! (those were just some thoughts running through my head)\n\nAnywho, onto my first experience at wayfare. We sat at the bar/kitchen area, highly recommend if its just two. The whole experience of watching how each plate gets put together, and how carefully it is executed is quite entertaining. The steak tartare prep girl was amazing to watch, considering everytime she whipped one up she had a spoonful to taste, thats a lot of raw beef for one evening. \n\nThe service was pretty great, we were never once unattended, the water kept coming (flat or sparkling), and the server was very patient with us, as sometimes I just yap away, and it takes me forever to figure out what I want to drink, mind you what I'm going to eat! So, we ordered some wine by the glass, which from what I recall they had a fairly nice selection, and they also have a full bar.\n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the Poutin (sp), this was my first poutin experience, and definitely not my last, who wouldn't want fries covered in pulled hmmm... can't remember if it was beef or pork, smothered in cheese. It was a meal in itself. For an entree I ordered the branzino and my friend got the salmon. I secretly envied the salmon, as it looked extremely delicious. My branzino was a bit on the dry side, and while I usually enjoy branzino, not so much at Wayfare. But that being said, it's my own fault for not ordering that burger, which I can't seem to kick the thoughts of out of my mind.\n\nHighly recommend giving this place a try!

The deviled eggs were good but really just eggs with curry flavor. The rabbit terrine was very delicious, the fried chicken tasty but overrated, the ravioli forgettable, and the scallops a nice, lighter accompaniment to the heaviness.\n\nI personally thought the popovers they served were overcooked and reminiscent of a giant piece of bread crust, but maybe that was just a bad batch.

That's how good it was.\n\nCame here for lunch with a friend on his firm's expense account, and I'm still dreaming about the experience.  The bacon-wrapped dates were incredibly good--crispy, smokey, and just the right amount of sweet--and I don't even like dates.  The burrata crostini appetizer also stood out for how good each individual component of the dish was; I could have eaten the crostini, the burrata, and the olive oil and caper sauce on top separately all day long.\n\nI had the bone-in veal chop as my main dish, and it was a blast.  Not the best hunk of meat I've ever had, but definitely delicious, on par with steaks costing a third more.  The manager also heard my friend and me discussing whether to share a side of mac and cheese, and brought us a bowl on the house.  Maybe free food tastes better, but the mac was amazing.  So creamy, not too salty, with perfectly cooked pasta.  What's better?\n\nThis place will kill your productivity at work, but who cares?  So freaking good.", "author": "Matt Y."}

No need to spread with the butter they offer on the side.\n\nStarted with the Calamari, and it was fantastic.  Yes, the flavors that accompanied it were heavy - but that is what we liked about it.  The calamari was fresh, cut with your fork tender and savory.  Would order that again, hands down.\n\nI had the lobster cobb, and it was fantastic as well.  Served with a buttermilk dressing which was mild and not too heavy.  Lobster had a sweetness to it that was great.  Avocado, thick bacon, kalamata olives and bleu cheese that was thick and creamy - not crumbly... the only complaint I had was that the tomato that was part of the salad had some yellow/green on it, as well as the brown where it was pulled from the vine.  Not what I would have expected and was disappointed.  \n\nDining companion had the Halibut on a bed of broccoli rabe that was also fantastic.  The top of the Halibut was actually crunchy, but it still maintained most of its moistness.  \n\nAlso had a side of fries with two dipping sauces - ketchup was one, and I thought there could have been a bit more creativity - but ketchup does appeal to the masses.\n\nService was great.

Wayfare Tavern = well made modernized American comfort food in a lively, fun setting.\n\nOur visit was for a Sunday night dinner.  We were seated promptly on the second floor, near the pool table.  Soon after ordering our meal, fresh, hot popovers arrived. Oh my!  They were crisp and light and left us wanting for more.  \n\nWe ordered the tomato bread soup, seared foie gras and roasted sardines to start.   One  friend loved the tomato soup and the other loved the foie gras.  I had ordered the sardines and found them to be fresh, perfectly cooked and well seasoned.  I only wish this dish had come with some grilled bread to eat with the roasted lemon and garlic cloves in the sauce.  \n\nFor entrees my friends ordered the steak and eggs and halibut and I ordered the fried chicken.  We also ordered a side dish of the macaroni and cheese.  I didn't try the other dishes but my friends declared them to be absolutely wonderful.  My fried chicken dish came with a garnish of deep fried herbs, roasted garlic and a lemon wedge.  Goodness, this was some of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  The meat was tender, juicy and very flavorful.  The crust stayed on the chicken and was not the least bit soggy or too thick.  The addition of the herbs and lemon was the perfect touch to round out the flavors of this dish.  The macaroni and cheese was ooey, gooey, creamy, rich and very, very tasty.  The fact that we each had a foodgasm after our first bite says it all!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the chocolate story, summer berry pound cake and the peach pie.   Wow.  I'm not usually big on desserts but two of these dishes just blew me away.  The peach pie comes with a light, tender, flakey crust.  Yes, it's big enough to share but you'll wish you didn't have to after you take your first bite.  The addition of the sugared herbs (rosemary, I think) brought that dish to another level.  Yes folks, this dish is THAT good.  The pound cake, which was recommended by our server, comes with a heavenly cabernet sorbet.  The fruit sauce, sorbet and fresh fruit combined with the pound cake made for one satisfying way to end our meal.  The chocolate story, on the other hand, was a bit too rich for our taste and seemed to have too much chocolate in it, if that's possible.  We started to combine the fruit and sorbet from the pound cake dish with the chocolate pudding / ganache and that seemed to lighten things up considerably.  Just when you think you're done, you're not.  Out comes a place of warm ginger cookies.  Sigh.  This place just knows how to do it right.\n\nThe service was attentive, friendly and efficient.  Our waitress had a great sense of humor and definitely contributed to our wonderful experience there.  The noise level can be high at times but that's to be expected when everyone is having a great time.\n\nThe one down side of the evening was that Tyler had already left for the evening when we were there.  Oh well.  Another reason for a return visit!  I highly recommend this place for great food, great service and a great time.", "author": "Melissa L."}

Reservations were a bit tough to come by, even one month in advance.  However, I was able to secure a reservation for 7 for 5:45 p.m. on a Sunday.\n\nThe evening started off nicely.  We sat downstairs and at one point we all became star struck because lo and behold who was working in the kitchen but our lovely Tyler Florence.  Now, we don't know if his presence was a good thing or bad thing, because after he came on board things went downhill.  \n\nWe ordered at about 6:15-ish.  It was 7:15 and our dinner had not arrived.  We were on our 3rd bottle of wine with no food in sight.  When our entrees arrived, they were average . . . just OK.  \n\nI ordered the tri-tip steak medium rare.  It looked more rare than med-rare and it tasted cold.  I know that the temperature I asked for doesn't require much cooking, but at least whenever I order my steak in the past it comes out hot, not cold.  So that was disappointment #1.\n\nMy friend's fried chicken was cold.  \n\nOne of my friend's side dishes was missed and she didn't get it until we asked for it and it was fired up and brought to us about 8 minutes later.\n\nMy dear birthday girl's dish was too salty, as were the french fries that came with mine and another friend's entree.\n\nThe mac n' cheese was just okay, I've had better and that appeared to be the consensus re: the mac.\n\nThe one thing that was delish: the popovers, Mmmmmm!!! Oh, and the obviously freshly baked ginger/sugar glazed cookies at the end of the meal.\n\nOverall, I tried and I probably won't return.

Thanks for an amazing meal!\n\nA run-down of our experience at Wayfare Tavern:\n\n*Drinks: had cocktails at the bar while we waited for our table to open up.  The Leidesdorff's main component is the bourbon- very strong and yummy!  The mixologist finessed every drink that he concocted.  One person in our party ordered the Devil's Canyon root beer- I like the fact that they're a local brewery and offer it here at WT.  With our meal Tiff brought a bottle of Viader for us to partake.  They also feature Viader on the wine list.\n\n*Food: Even after perusing the menu at home and deciding what I wanted to order, I still wasn't sure what to choose, especially after smelling and seeing the other dishes around us.  We decided on the following:\n\n-Starters: \n~a dozen oysters: raw, fresh, and sweet.  They tasted fine just on their own, second best with the mignonette, and third best with the cocktail sauce.\n~Steak Tartare (whole): absolutely divine, just the right amount of capers and saltiness to smother on to pieces of toast.\n~Poutine: a Quebecois dish, with an American twist.  Fries smothered in truffled Jack cheese, veal jus, and studded with shredded braised beef short ribs.  We were told that it's the same short rib as the entree, but I went ahead anyway and ordered that!  The poutine just melts in your mouth- I had three helpings.  :P  \n\n-Entrees:\n~Braised beef short ribs: meaty, tender, succulent.  It's a huge chunk of short rib that just collapses once you put your fork to it.  \n-Sonoma pork belly: my husband ordered this and he said it's the best pork belly he's had.  He said it even beats Gary Danko's!  Wow!\n-Rosemary fried chicken: a mountain of fried chicken that was quickly consumed, although some had to be boxed up.  We just had so many appetizers!\n-Tri-tip: cooked medium rare, just right.  This came with an overwhelming amount of fries.\n\n-Desserts:\n~Toffee pudding with black pepper ice cream: The toffee was absolutely what is needed in a dessert: just-right sweetness, crunch, and a best friend called ice cream to go with it.\n-Carrot cake: not too sweet; almost as good as my sister's.  :P  \n\nAll in all, a fun and laid-back atmosphere to enjoy your friends' company and delight in the food, drink, and ambiance.", "author": "jen a."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-02", "description": "For my first posting I thought it only fitting to start with the greatest new addition to the SF restaurant scene: Wayfare Tavern (http://www.wayfaretavern.com/main.html). Tyler Florence, you have outdone yourself yet again.\n\n\nIf you are in search of a fine dining experience where you can indulge in traditional comfort food, Wayfare Tavern is your new favorite place. About a month ago I visited 558 Sacramento Street with my family for a birthday celebration. I had been wanting to try this new restaurant for some time, but I was a bit skeptical because of mixed reviews I had read.\n\n\nAfter entering the restaurant, I began to understand why you have to call a month in advance to book a reservation. In true San Francisco fashion, Wayfare Tavern is intimate, which makes seating in the formal dining room quite limited. When I arrived, the great big old fashion doors opened into an old fashion Victorian restaurant. Taking a closer look, I was blown away by the vintage yet modern decor. Rustic tables and chairs gave the restaurant an old world feeling, while elegant place settings made you feel like you could be in a swanky NYC establishment.\n\n\nAfter sitting down at our table, a fresh baked pop-over was immediately placed on my bread plate. To accompany the pop-over, fresh butter sprinkled with sea salt was placed on our table. Upon first bite, I was in bliss as the warm, moist, pastry like concoction melted in my mouth. Our meal began with deviled eggs, which were anything but ordinary. The sheer massiveness and buttery sweet saltiness of each egg was a surprise to my taste buds. The steak tartar had a twist as well. When the dish was first placed on our table, I immediately thought that our waiter had accidentally served us ahi tartar. But when I took my first bite, I was consumed in the familiar mustard and onion aromas.  \n\n\nFor my entr\u00e9e I ordered the much talked about fried chicken. Without a doubt, this is the best fried chicken I have ever tasted. I am not the biggest fan of fried food, mostly because I think the batter takes away from the purity of the flavors, but this dish was exceptional. Tyler has found a way to make fried chicken crispy, yet moist and extremely flavorful. As a side dish our waiter recommended the mac and cheese. Although the flavoring was quite excellent, admittedly I have had better mac and cheese dishes at other restaurants.  \n\n\nFor dessert, we tried the fried apple pie as well as the sticky toffee pudding. While the fried apple pie was cooked perfectly, there was too much crust and not enough apples for my liking. The sticky toffee pudding, however, was immaculate. Served with warm poached pears and pepper ice cream, we could not have picked a better way to end an enjoyable meal.\n\n\nThe Wayfare Tavern is a new landmark in San Francisco and will be serving generations to come. I commend Tyler Florence for a great new addition to the city and I am looking forward to my next trip back to the Victorian era.", "author": "Lauren K."}

Yes I know I've said that Boxing Room and Front Porch are the best. Well... All I can say is can someone organize a three way line up and tasting so we can all judge each alongside the other?!?  Fabulous. And as good as it looked on tv. Popovers, too, are a unique offer (from what I can tell) and make a nice, if over the top, change from bread or tortillas to start.\n\nPersonally, this place is one of my favorites in the city - not completely for the food/wine but for the people I've met and the types of relationships I've formed by simply starting a conversation with the person who happens to be sitting next to me.   Is it the location? Is it the dim, proximate interior or the way the bar seems to invite close-ups? Not sure but this is one of our favorite places to hang at the bar for an extended period of time. Not only have we met people from all over the world (now FB friends) but we've engaged people on a deeper level and had long, wide-ranging conversations. Wayfare makes SF feel like an international city full of fascinating people and their stories.\n\nRecently my BF and I had an extra interesting experience. Sitting at the bar, we overheard the couple next to us talking. The conversation was hard to not tune in to - erotic, intellectual, full of conflict.  I got so intrigued, I had to put down my popover and concentrate. Turns out these two are having a hot affair (seeing most of each other in SF bars and restaurants from what I can figure) but it's all starting to go seriously off the rails. They are thinking of leaving their spouses for each other. They blog as a way of \"asking the Internet\". They were a great couple (how weird is that to say?!?). They also have a different take on what makes a good bar. We're intrigued, we plan to meet them for a drink every week (different places of course) to see how things are going for them. I thought this sounded a bit like a modern \"Tales of the City\" in the making and I want to follow the story. I'm going to plug their blog cause I really liked this take on our favorite bars!\n\nhttp://findingfidelity.com/2012/07/16/5-best-bars-to-take-your-lover-in-san-francisco/", "author": "Rachel H."}

This happens to be one of my wife's favorite spots to grab some comfort food in SF - so I really wanted to like it - but my first impression (it was my first time in) is that the place is a bit overrated.

Support staff then tried to deliver 3 different items - at different times - that we did not order. The family had a good laugh about that episode, so I guess there was some entertainment with the meal. Food gets a B, simply because it is a bit better than average, but nothing memorable. Perhaps a couple episodes of Triple D could inspire Tyler to dig deep and add some extra excitement to the dishes? Kitchen staff must be pretty bored with the lack of depth in the menu as a whole.

And although it can get a little noisy as the place fills up, at no point did I have to shout across the table to hear my dinner mate.\n\nThey start each table off with a warm popover while you await your first course to come out (and they're generous about giving you another if you so desire, but watch out or you might fill up on popovers before your main course arrives.)\n\nWe had the deviled eggs starter (6 perfect deviled eggs topped w/1 round of a crispy onion ring), and went with the waitress' recommendations of the lamb and the pork chop, both of which were excellent. We ended our meal with the pear tart w/ coriander ice cream which definitely exceeded expectations (we've had a lot of sub par fruit tarts lately.)\n\nGood cocktail list, and great wine list. I was impressed with the coordination of the wait staff, and the overall attentiveness without being pesky. Service was on par with what I'm used to at Boulevard, which doesn't happen too often. Plan to definitely head back for a special occasion. The only reason this isn't a 5-star review is I didn't feel like the appetizer selection had enough items to share.", "author": "Miss E."}

There are typically hiccups - something too salty, drinks too watery, staff lukewarm.\n\nWell expect the OPPOSITE at Wayfare Tavern. This locale already performs like a well-oiled machine and you will eat incredibly.  The burger is so good you will cry while eating the crispy fries. The deviled eggs (and I am a mayo hater - not sure if there is any in there) with fried capers are truly epic. Oysters Rockefeller creamy and well-presented. Fried chicken, yes prepare to be utterly blown away especially with the citrus flavor that makes it pop. And speaking of POP, the POPOVERS will ensure you never eat them at The Rotunda again. \n\nDessert - well the chocolate cupcake with the hidden truffle is extraordinary, and was inhaled quickly because the Banana Pudding was floating on a tray in front of us with delicious meringue on top.\n\nCocktails - killer. Plum Scrub was fresh, seasonal and delicious.\n\nStaff is well informed, enthusiastic, and hip.\n\nThe upstairs billiard room is super cool and the private dining room upstairs with the long table is going to be perfect for private parties.\n\nPrepare yourself for an amazing new American dining experience at Wayfare Tavern.", "author": "Mariangela S."}

The best thing you can get here is the macaroni and cheese. It's creamy and delicious! The other thing that was pretty good was their hamburger. We enjoyed the pretzel bun that they made with.  I think what I don't like about this place is their food temperature. Our fried chicken was luke warm the two times we ordered it. We also tried their Friday soft shell crab special which was okay. For appetizers, we tried the grilled calamari (nothing special) and the crab/avocado dish (tasty). The ambiance was nice like having dinner in a library, intimate and cozy.

If I could rate the service and front of the house, I'd give them only 3 stars, so I have to give the entire experience 4 stars.  I feel like a judge on Top Chef.  \n\nFirst, the disappointing parts: I made reservations for Wayfare about a month in advance so I was disappointed that we still had to wait at least a half hour before we could get seated.  Bummer.  The service started out awesome, but there were serious issues with timing - we waited almost 45 minutes between appetizers and entrees, and our 2nd bottle of wine wasn't brought out until right before the check was dropped.  Seriously.  Pounding wine after eating a shit ton of rich, tasty food is never easy.  And - Popover Guy, we had a problem with you.  The waiter who was handing out the awesome popovers was also stingy with them and didn't offer them up unless asked - what were they, dusted with gold and filled with blood diamonds?  No, they were popovers!\n\nThat being said, the highlights were really the great wine list and the food, and hey, isn't that mainly what eating out is all about?  In short, I loved the amazing oysters, truly delicious salads (try the Sliced Avocado, Cucumber & Hearts Of Palm), probably the only deviled eggs I'd ever honestly enjoy, a kick ass burger, steak and eggs to die for (my boyfriend could feel his heart ... slowing ... down ... as he was eating it), and rosemary fried chicken that might be the best we had ever tasted.\n\nIn closing, go there for the food, bring your patience and order your wine early ... and don't leave without a popover ...", "author": "Veronica Y."}

I know it's probably hard to keep all the oysters wet and sparkly in such a busy restaurant environment. They were good and fresh, though. I don't hold this against them. \n\nWe also had the butter lettuce salad. Nice, simple, with good dressing. Good portion.\n\nWe have the fried chicken and the lamb shank. Both were superb. The lamb shank came with wassabi mashed potatoes, fried brussel sprout leaves, and caramelized carrots. The meat was delicious and fall-off-the-bone tender. Yum! \n\nThe fried chicken was cook perfectly. Crispy on the outside and tender-juicy on the inside. It came with lemon and roasted garlic, and a hint of fresh thyme. \n\nWe also has a side of braised greens. Very good.\n\nOh, not to forget the popovers they give you before the meal  - the first one i had was right out of the over ... it was one of the best things i have ever eaten!! Eggy and warm. Wow. It was spectacular. \n\nThe prices aren't astronomical for the portion size and quality of food. Fried chicken al a carte was $19, my lamb shank was $27, the steak special was, I think, $35. \n\nThe starters like steak tartare is $19 (didn't have it this time but want to come back to have a starter meal - large glass of red wine, steak tartare, deviled eggs, maybe a salad. \n\nWe have the dessert, too - a chocolate pie thing. It was good, not spectacular. They had several creative options to chose from. \n\nAll in all, great place - nice atmosphere, great food, nice people, not out of the work expensive.

His recipes are straight forward and easy, yet delicious Yet I was underwhelmed here. It was food that I could make at home. \nWe got in and had to wait for our table, even with reservations, so we had a few drinks at the bar. They were really great. No problem. Forty five minutes later, we found out they skipped over us after we went up and questioned. Like, they just gave it away. Then, somehow, they were able to squeeze us in, but asked if we could keep it to an hour at the table. There may have been a snarky response. Plus, the service was slow enough that we got out in about 2 hours. \nAnyways... the food. It was fine. I tried the chicken and yeah, it was good, but I just wasn't blown away. I had a pork chop that was fine. Decent flavor and juicy, but again just okay. My husband, always the burger lover, was the same with his burger. It was just okay. \nWe did not get to order dessert because we had plans for dessert elsewhere, but I was tempted. \nI would go back, though probably for lunch. I was just a bit let down by it all.

We sat on the first floor, near the fireplace, right by the kitchen. After reading numerous Yelp reviews which describe Tyler sightings, I felt that it was attainable, well after calling the restaurant to add a note to my rezzie, \"would like to meet Tyler if possible, it's my birthday.\" Well that went to shit, no Tyler! However, I really liked our table and being close to the action. I think it also helps to make an early reservation which doesn't hurt but just builds up the anticipation more. I made my reservation two months it advance! Excellent service. To my recollection, here's what we ate:\n\n-Complimentary popovers, instead of the usual bread: best idea ever! Even better than the cheese toast at Sizzler or the bread at Red Lobster, oh yes it's that good, light and airy, great plain or with butter.\n-Santa Barbara Uni with cauliflower pudding & fried clam bellies: uh-huh, yeah, bomb.com. My boyfriend said the best uni comes from Santa Barbara so I thought, this shit better be the shit and it was.\n-Deviled eggs: There were a lot of mixed reviews from Yelpers but I enjoyed this but needed a bit more salt\n-The Bone: sorry not for me, way too rich but at least I can say I've tried it\n-Foie Gras: uh-huh yeah, bomb.com again. Not gamey at all.\n\nFor entrees:\n-Fried chicken: Another dish held in high regard but given mixed reviews by Yelpers, so I didn't know how to pre-judge! It was just okay for me. It was served with lemon so I put a squirt on there and it tasted better after that. There were five pieces of chicken, good sized too. Not huge like KFC style or small like wings.\n-Side of foraged mushrooms: I'm no mushroom expert but these were good. Simple, not too buttery, the mushrooms themselves were hearty and tasted just like Cream of Mushroom soup!\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the fried apple pie, which is supposed to be a fancy McDonald's apple pie. Since it was my birthday, they served it with a candle and \"Happy Birthday\" in chocolate sauce. Aww special star for that one! The apple pie was aight, McD still takes the gold!\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my experience. I'm definitely coming back because it's not far from work and I must try that pork belly!

It needs to use different cheeses than what they use for a little more oomph.\n\nI have to rant about my second experience, which was yesterday. TERRIBLE SERVICE! We were seated at noon and ordered shortly afterwards, but didn't get our food until after 1pm!!! after the adjacent table who was seated after us was happily enjoying their entrees 15 min before we got ours. The kicker was that our server never once acknowledged that things were slow or apologized. It's unacceptable for a place like that charging those prices and in a business district with lots of people expecting to be in and out within an hour.

Me and my boyfriend had dinner there last night (December 10) and I made the reservation back on October 15... nearly 2 months ago!!! That is not necessarily a bad thing. The only part I hated was waiting because I wanted to eat there right away!!!!\n\nThis is my second time eating at Wayfare Tavern and Tyler Florence is 2 for 2! First of all they completely changed their menu. Two or three of the dishes I named in my last review was not on the menu this time.  I was excited though because I knew I wanted to try something new.\n\nFor an appetizer we ordered the Grilled Monterey Calamari. For some reason I didn't notice the word 'grilled' and only saw the word 'calamari,' so when the dish arrived I was surprised to see unbreaded, unfried squid. Haha. I was a little skeptical because I'm not used to eating grilled squid, but I ate it. I ate ALL of it. The squid had a vinegar-y taste, which I liked. Plus it had garlic, which I really liked! You could tell it was grilled because it had a bbq-y (almost charred) taste. If you're seafood person you'll love the grilled calamari. Even if you're not a seafood person I think this appetizer will convert you.\n\nFor entrees I had the Braised Beef Short Ribs with celery and a potato puree. These are fall-off-the-bone goodness! That meat is some of the most tender meat I've ever had. They give you a knife, but I don't understand why because you don't need it. There was a guy sitting at the table next to me and my boyfriend. He order the braised ribs as well, but he didn't finish it! WTF?\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Hangtown Fry. The description on the menu describes it has \"A dying man's last meal...\" and it is: Eggs, bacon, oysters, and potatoes mixed together. That's probably what I would want to eat if I knew I were dying. It was sooooo good. I mean how could you go wrong with breakfast?\n\nFor dessert we ordered the Spiced Pumpkin Pudding Cake. Now this was interesting. The 'pudding cake' was basically a muffin with the pudding inside. It was pretty good. It tasted like a mini pumpkin pie. However it also came with blue cheese, honey comb, walnuts, and grapes. I mixed the cake with each one and it had an interesting contrast.

Lunch was that good.\n\nBrilliant comfort food kicked up a notch. Lunch for three seated at the kitchen to watch the magic happen. Ordered a pint of scotch ale on the recommendation of the waiter. Great choice on a cold, rainy afternoon. Food service begins with a warm, puffy popover served with a side of butter. After devouring that cloud of happy, we dove into the steak tartare served with sliced, toasted, garlic popovers. Divine. Three diners, so three entrees to share. The fried chicken (squeeze the fresh lemon all over it) had the moistest, tenderest meat with the most flavorful, crunchy skin. The skin was so good, I undressed a second piece just to eat that fatty deliciousness. I should be ashamed, but the balance of seasonings and fresh rosemary suppressed any shame I might have had. The hamburger served with a cone of fries drizzled in truffle oil. Oy! Medium well patty, thick sliced bacon, creamy cheese, fresh pickle, tomato and lettuce on a toasted bun was tasty. Those fries dipped in the side of mayo was a perfect accompaniment. On the recommendation of our waiter (again), ordered the mushroom grits. The key to enjoying the grits...mix it all up. The creamy grits, goat cheese and mixed sauteed mushrooms meld together into something special. I'm not really a grit fan but those are the best damn grits I've ever eaten! Looked at the dessert menu, but had to pass because it wouldn't fit.\n\nGreat ambience - sort of a warm, wood, pub like feel. Sitting at the kitchen allows you to watch the chefs prepare the meals and also gives you a clue that the most popular orders were the fried chicken, burger, mac n cheese and some kind of fish dish that I completely missed on the menu. Service was fabulous - prompt and attentive enough without being invasive. Price - on the high side (entrees were $20+), but it's not my daily lunch place. And those popovers...they keep coming around with fresh ones, so feel free to share an entree and eat a couple-few of those things.\n\nI heart you Tyler Florence.", "author": "Christine B."}

These are the kinds of establishments that awesome guy nights or bachelor parties can start out (or finish) at.  With dark decor, dark woods, deer heads, private pool tables with gigantic flat screen tv's, and a menu full of testosterone (see steak tartare entree, fried chicken, burger with a fried egg), I can only imagine how awesome this place can be at night.\n\nStarting off with the popovers that nearly gave Fleur De Lys' brioche a run for its Francs, they were very airy and buttery with just enough salt and butter to taste.  \n\nNext we had the grilled calamari appetizer.  Very fresh and tender pieces of squid were drizzled with olive oil and other spices that embarrassed any of the similar fare I had in Greece.  This was a very light start to what turned out to be a fairly heavy main course (see manly comments above).\n\nNext, my lunch buddy got the fried chicken and I went for the recommended burger (over the steak tartare entree).

Ridiculously tender and juicy pieces of chicken were fried in a way that the skin seemed to be infused into the chicken meat.  You'd bite into it, and the rest of the skin wouldn't fall off, leaving you with a mouthful of fried chicken skin and a plateful of bare chicken meat.  It also played a great balancing act between being too salty and lacking flavor.\n\nMy burger was amazing.  The closest thing to the creation would be the Royal Red Robin burger..........but this one uses better meat, has a better brioche bun, and uses froo froo eggs and bacon.  The result?  Yes, twice as good as the Royal Red Robin (which is quite a compliment actually).  It also comes with fries that are just right without trying too many fancy things (truffled etc..) and sides of ketchup and a mustard aioli.  Unfortunately, for Wayfare Tavern, I went to Chop Bar in Oakland not too long ago and feel that Chop Bar may have edged slightly over WT's burger, only for texture.  The taste may have been ever so slightly better than Chop Bar's, but it wasn't enough to rival the texture of CB's which melted in my mouth.  While this burger was far from dry and far from bland, it still was a tiny bit tough to rip apart.\n\nWith that said, the lunch was still one of near epic proportions at a place that I can see myself going back to plenty of times.", "author": "Jeff N."}

We had reservations and upon arrival were taken to our table in the upstairs dining area.  Our waiter was very pleasant and attended to us immediately for our drinks and soon after we were given their signature popovers.  They were served warm but had zero flavor, BUT that was a freebee so who I am to critique them on that.  \n\nOn to our starters: \n\n\"The Bone\" which is bone marrow with rutabaga jam. This was a huge dissapointment as it was bland.  Yes it was rich, and warm but with out flavor it did nothing for me.\n\nGrilled Monterey Bay Calamari was well seasoned and full of flavor,  We enjoyed this very much and could have continued to have this for the rest of my meal.\n\nThe entrees and sides:\n\nMy boyfriend had the organic fried chicken which was delicious...absolutely more then just Southern Fried Chicken.  This was done southern style with just the right amount of seasoning and a crust of breading that was light and airy.  He ordered this with the baked Macaroni and Cheese which was comfort food to the fullest.  \n\nThis is sad but my entree left me little to remember-I mean literally, I remember I didn't think anything out of the ordinary about it and can't even remember what I had a month ago.  \n\nAll-in-all, I was disappointed with my experience at Wayfare.  It seemed to be hit-or-miss.  From vast differences in appeal (flavorful to bland), the only thing I can assume is that I had the same chef somehow prepare \"The Bone\" and my meal?

The food was absolutely incredible.  In planning the dinner, the restaurant was incredibly accommodating to our requests to have the food served family style, and they were even able to bake us a beautiful and delicious wedding cake.  We had a few canap\u00e9s served before the dinner, and although they were smaller than I had thought they would be, they were very flavorful.  We ordered 2 starters, 3 main courses, and 2 sides to be served family style for our group of 14 people, and we had WAY more food than we needed.  No one went home hungry! All of our guests raved about the food and said that it was the best food they have had at a wedding.  One of our guests has a gluten sensitivity, and they brought out individual gluten free servings for her without any issue or additional cost.  The servers were attentive and always kept our wine glasses full, and our main server was always on top of what was going on so that I did not need to worry about anything.  They were friendly and helpful and treated all of our guests with respect.  I highly recommend the Wayfare Tavern for events! Jasmine was great to work with and arranged for flowers and name cards to be set up on the table.  We did not need to add any decoration to the room, which was great for the low-maintenance wedding that we wanted.

The mac 'n' cheese was ridiculously good, we couldn't stop eating it. The tri-tip was delish, as well. I tend to like my meat cooked closer to well, but the BFF likes hers closer to rare. The taste I had of the lovely pink tri-tip was almost enough to convert me. Almost. ;)\n\nSince we both have crazy sweet tooths, we ordered 3 desserts between the 2 of us: fried apple pie, toffee pudding, and the carrot cake. So many different layers of yummy in all 3. Several of the staff asked us which we liked the best and we couldn't decide.\n\nAll in all, a GREAT experience here.

Tyler Florence's Wayfare Tavern disproved all of my previous concerns. I knew right away it was going to be a great experience upon walking in. It is a beautiful restaurant with a nod to the past while still being modern and elegant. The ground floor is mostly made up of the bar/tavern and seems to be mostly for walk-ins. We had a reservation so we were seated upstairs. Love the dark wood and great lighting. The tables were also surprisingly spacious. The menu is a good size with some intriguing dishes and some more traditional ones. They also have some raw selections which was a nice touch. I will go out on a limb here and say that the appetizers we had here were among the best I've had in a very long time. We started with the mussels - these were mind blowing. If you like mussels at all, you need to get these. The broth had this incredible balance between the umi butter and kumquats. We sopped it all up with some extra bread. We also got the chicken liver pate, which was equally impressive. Using the edge of the pate and covering it with a balsamic glaze was genius! For Entrees we both went with the famed organic fried chicken. This is definitely the first time I ever ordered fried chicken in a restaurant like this and it was worth it. Perfectly crispy and moist on the inside. The fried herbs were delicious and created the perfect bite. The portion is large but I recommend getting a side so that you can have something to offset all the fried textures. We went with the asparagus, which were very good. For dessert we had the strawberry rhubarb pie. The highlight of this dish was absolutely the basil ice cream - wow! \nService the entire time was great with solid wine recommendations.

Don't bother to make any special request when you make a reservation either because they won't honor it, and will lie when they call to confirm the reservation and you ask.  It's beyond loud inside, probably due to the fact it's located in the financial district, so needless to say it's filled with a pack of idiots right out of the \"Wolf of Wall Street\".  I can't review the food because I was so put off by the way we were treated by the hostess and the loud mouths jeering downstairs that we all got up and left.  And on one last note, the place has a weird and unpleasant odor as you make you way inside.  I wouldn't ever go back, there are plenty of much better places in San Francisco to enjoy and spend my money.  Oh, and for the hostess looking me up, I went to Hog Island and dropped over $400 and left a $100 tip.", "author": "Mark T."}

It was Friday the 13th, but we were lucky enough to grab a seat at the 4-space upstairs bar.  Wine and a cocktail were consumed while popovers spread with some amazing salty butter substance were munched.  The hearts of palm and avacado salad was understated but amazing with a light vinaigrette.  \nDining partner had the fried chicken, which I nibbled happily, and I went for the chicken paillard, mostly because it came with lardon.  Salty but flavorful.  The sides: mac and cheese (rich and delicious) and asparagus (pretty standard).  \nDespite sitting in the corner at the bar, the dark victorian American ambiance was apparent, and the service was impeccable even though the bartender serving us was slammed.  \nOverall a great experience.  $60 per person for all of the above, and well-worth it.", "author": "Eric S."}

This place doesn't need anymore reviews, mine being the 556, but I wanted to put my two cents in.\n\nthree stars service\nthree to three and a half stars food (each food has it's own break down)\n\nMy sister is visiting from out of the country, and wanted a little flashiness her last few days here, so she wanted to have lunch here.   Not surprisingly when she called at 11:30 she was told they were booked and to come in at 2:10.  Fine, they hungrier we are, the more food we will consume.  We arrive at 2:10, the lunch crowd is long gone bc it's almost empty.  We check in with hostess, who proceeds to tell us, \"No your reservation is not at 2:10, it was at 1:45.\"  Sister \"Oh that's funny, the person on the phone told us 2:10.\"  Hostess \"Yea, we don't make reservations for 2:10, we wouldn't do that.\"  Really lady, why are we having this conversation??  it's empty, just smile and say oh there seems to have been a mistake, no worries, come sit down.\n\nAfter seating us, the waiter seemed nice at first.  Came took drink order.  Came back to say bread was coming.  Then disappeared.  For a long time.  Now granted, I said I needed another minute, but one minute doesn't mean 12 minutes.  He was the only server in the area, and he had to take orders for all the people sitting at the bar counter, which was full.  \n\nWhen he finally came back, we ordered the bone marrow, and my sister asked for the humbolt squid.  Oh we're out.  Ok, can we have the burrata?  Oh that's out too.  Um, ok (in head, shouldn't you have told us that before??)  Without thinking, we got the deviled eggs.  \n\nFor the rest of service, besides being attention about water glasses and bread, the waiters answers were short or sometime sardonic.  I don't need that, esp not at this type of restaurant.  I should be able to ask about every single item on the menu, and not given short \"whatever\" answers.  \n\nFor entree's we had duck gumbo and the pot roast.\n\nBone marrow- this is something that is so decadent, I always want to have it and regret it.   here there were three big pieces of bone, three pieces of toast, some pieces of confit red onions, and brussel sprout leaves toasted.  It was rich and good and having a little bit of the onions and sprout leaves helped cut the richness.  To me, the marrow could have cooked a little bit longer to render the fat down further- some pieces came out in grisly pieces, like the fat that some people (not me) cut off from their steaks, and it didn't spread onto the toast, but just looked like a piece of fat on toast.  That only came form the middle of the bones, but was still unappealing, it should have been cooked longer to be more spreadable.  for taste, 3 1/2 stars.\n\nDeviled eggs.  The yolk is mixed with creme fraiche, and the eggs should be topped with bottarga (cavier).  Yes, it came with botarga, those two grey dots, literally, on the plate.  Eggs were rich and almost overly decadent, the flavor of the yolk almost too sweet.  three stars.\n\nGumbo-  the duck breast was nice, what I didn't expect, and excuse me if I didn't understand the description, but I did ask and wasn't told, was that the gumbo is full of a liver taste.  it's not that it was bad, but it wasn't expected.  3 stars.\n\nPot roast.  Tender meat.  Potatoes were great.  Could taste in some bites a burst of truffle yum.  I really did like this dish, it was a good flavor.  I'll give it 3 1/2 stars,  But really, how hard is it to make pot roast.\n\nI didn't mind this restaurant at all, but for the prices, I expected more.\n\nPS  Tyler was not there.  Maybe lunch at 210 isn't his thing.  =)", "author": "Nancy R."}

And, the day I fell in love with Wayfare Tavern. \n\nI have been dreaming of coming here since the day this restaurant opened. I'm a HUGE fan of Tyler Florence and also a huge fan of the restaurant space. My boyfriend works with the owners of the real estate and we had been there a few years ago for a Christmas party. \n\nDay after day we have driven by the restaurant on the way home from BART and observed the hustle-and-bustle of the magic happening inside.\n\nOur experience began with the $10 valet parking (what a blessing!) Our reservations were at 8:00 and we were actually able to show up just moments before our reservation, have our car parked and walk right in to be seated for our experience.\n\nOur table was perfect. We sat downstairs and my back was facing the fire. I had a perfect side-angle view of kitchen where I watched at the edge of my seat all night long. \n\nWhat started as as celebratory dinner turned into a brief love affair with the sights, the sounds, the food, the smells, the noise, the background music, the lighting, the wait staff. I watched at the kitchen crew worked in perfect harmony together to create tasty dishes of which are perfectly plated and garnished. \n\nOur meal...the popovers, the Valentine's Day complimentary champagne toast, the wine, the lobster, the steak friites, the mac n cheese, the sea bass, the mushrooms, the flour-less hazelnut chocolate cake. A meal ft for a king and queen. Every last bite was heaven. Let's not forget the love affair I had with all of the plates that were being delivered to those who sat near us. \n\nThis was an absolutely fabulous evening at one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. \n\nI left glowing, feeling as is I were on a romantic vacation...and the very best part is the perfect little apartment we live in only blocks away with a view better than any hotel we could ask for. \n\nAn experience to remember.\n\nIf you dream of being a restauranteur, a pastry chef, a traveling food blogger or if you just love the atmosphere of a successful, small gem of a restaurant, you must come here!\n\nAnd the wine is calling me to sleep...\n\nUntil next time - Happy Eating!", "author": "Tiffany G."}

I've been wanting to try Wayfare for a very very long time (huge fan of Tyler Florence) and what better time than to share a new experience with the family. \n\nFirst of all, I love LOVE the decor of the place - the wooden table, the fire place, the leg of ham hanging by the kitchen, the rustic table settings. Service was impeccable, each course was timed perfectly and we weren't left waiting too long for our next course nor did we feel rushed. \n\nPopovers: Now I know why these are on the 7x7 list. Amazing. So light and fluffy with just the right amount of crunch on the outside. And the best part is these are complimentary, they just keep coming. I had to stop myself at 2 since we ordered a ton of food also. \n\nAppetizers:\n- Kobe Beef Tartare: I'm always wary of ordering beef tartare because if the quality of meat is not good enough, it will taste like raw beef which I don't think my parents like. But I had to give it a go and it was spectacular. It was tender, flavorful, made with the best of the best Kobe beef served with wedges of the popover drizzled with olive oil and garlic. Parents loved it and I was glad they could try something new. \n- Bone Marrow: I always try to order bone marrow whenever it is on the menu and I've had my fair share of them. Wayfare's bone marrow appetizer hands-down ranks among the top. It was flavorful, not overwhelming and just the right portion. It is served alongside some grilled sourdough, rutabaga jam and a salad of parsley, marinated onions and capers.\n- Oysters: We went with half a dozen of the Kusshi and Kumamoto which I do recommend since the smaller oysters pack more flavor and are much less fishy.\n\nEntrees:\n- Pork Chop: I was already pretty full by the end of the appetizer but still managed to finish most of my pork chop since it was so damn juicy. I love the small rustic carrots that was also roasted and served alongside the chop. I def prefer my pork chop to the fried chicken and the sauce of the chop goes perfectly with the whipped mashed potato. \n- Fried Chicken: A heaping piled of perfectly seasoned, breaded and prepared fried chicken. Plenty to share. It does make me wonder how in the world they got the chicken to be so tender and flavorful. \n- Irish lamb stew: Dad loves lamb and he was in love with this dish. Falling off the bone leg of lamb served with plenty of peas, pearl onions and mashed potato. Lovely presentation and bold flavors. \n- Grilled asparagus and whipped mashed potato sides: Just do it!\n\nDessert: \n- Strawberry Rhubarb Tart:  I was expecting something that looks more like a tart but the presentation was so much better than what I envisioned. A block of creme brulee-esq custard with huge sliced strawberry and strawberry rhubarb compote. Excellent end to a great meal.  \n\nUnfortunately, Tyler wasn't there but I'll definitely be coming back in the future and trying the other dishes on the menu!!!", "author": "Kelly C."}

Oh, and it being Tyler Florence's restaurant didn't hurt, either.\n\nWe were promptly seated for our 5:00p reservation for six (my choices were 5p and 9p...opted for the earlier one). And note, they probably can't take reservations larger than six since their booths can't fit anymore people, and the aisles are too narrow to place a seat at the end. I believe there's a lounge upstairs you can book out, however, I didn't check it out.\n\nSo we started with CALIFORNIA AVOCADO & HEARTS OF PALM and SEARED SONOMA FOIE GRAS (I'm not yelling, just copying and pasting from their PDF menu :P). Both were quite good and flavorful, with the foie gras being rich (as usual). However the avocado and hearts of palm were super fresh and of really high quality. I definitely recommend the avocado dish.\n\nWe also got a dozen oysters for the table of different varieties, each with it's distinctive and fresh flavor. I don't know too much about oysters and rarely eat them raw. In any case, these seemed good and fresh in my book.\n\nFor entrees, I and two others go the steak & eggs, and other people at the table got the Saturday duck special and fried chicken. Fortunately, everyone was willing to share and I was able to sample everyone's dishes:\n\nSteak & Eggs...AMAZING. Filet mignon as a base, with bits of crab, topped with two perfectly poached \"soft (as they called it)\" eggs. The eggs, when broken, had a perfect custardy consistency. It didn't run, and it wasn't solid. Just ooozed perfectly, melding the rest of the flavors with the bearnaise sauce.\n\nDuck Saturday special - Duck (breast), duck (leg confit), duck (egg), and duck (sausage)! If you love duck, you should get this. Most unusually, my favorite part about it was the duck sausage.\n\nFried chicken - extremely moist, with the right texture and flavoring of the batter. It's quite a generous serving, as well. I think I'll order this for myself next time....or the burger...or the....something delicious....\n\nDessert....though we were stuffed...was BIG PAPA'S BANANA PUDDING shared amongst the table. The combination of banana pudding and vanilla \"Wayfares\" caught my eye and brought me back to eating Nilla Wafers when I was a kid. It was certainly a sweet and delicious way to end dinner.\n\nOh, and don't forget about their \"bread\" aka popovers. They're warm, slightly savory, and delicious with butter.\n\nConcept: 5\nHigh quality ingredients enhancing classic dishes in a very cool and inviting, \"tavern\" gastropub setting. The star power of Tyler Florence isn't just hype...it's well worth it (though it didn't seem like he was there that night).\n\nValue: 5\nWe split appetizers and dessert. So, this may have contributed to the overall lower cost of the meal. However, we were ALL stuffed by their generous and rich portions.\n\nExecution: 5\nQuality ingredients cooked to perfection tasting amazing. Server was attentive, provided quality recommendations (STEAK AND EGGS!) and provided a great experience. Food runners and bussers were attentive to filling waters, and providing popovers when requested.\n\nI will be back....oh for sure.", "author": "Ellis A."}

We sat upstairs which seemed quieter than downstairs but that was only because we arrived at 6:00 and it was not yet full. Downstairs seemed more hectic and noisy and lot's of action in the kitchen and the bar. \n\nOn to the very extensive menu. There were a lot of things that sounded good and I would imagine most everyone could find something to please their palate. \n\nWe started with the Tomato Bread Soup and the Foie Gras. Our friends had the Sardines and the Butter Lettuce salad. First of all, I don't really like sardines but I tried my friends they were tasty and very fresh! The salad looked beautiful although I didn't taste it. Oh, and we shared an order of deviled eggs that were delish! So, the soup was awesome! So fresh and tasty and I wanted more, but the killer appetizer was the Foie. OMG, the best Foie Gras I have ever eaten! They served it with roasted plums, which were the perfect accompaniment! I would return just for this dish alone. Amazing! \n\nEntrees were the Steak and Eggs and the infamous Fried Chicken. The S & E's was delicious, perfectly cooked and a lovely combination of flavors. Now for the chicken. It was tasty, very fresh with some lovely herbs and a nice citrusy flavor but was it the best fried chicken I have ever eaten? Sadly , no. I like my fried chicken with a crispy, more spicy skin and this was just not what I was expecting. \n\nWe also ordered several side including the creamed corn, mac & cheese and fries. All of these were good but nothing spectacular. \n\nWhat was spectacular was the Peach Pie! Another OMG! I don't really even like fruit pie that much but this was amazing. Looking like a little chicken pot pie, big enough to serve four people and served with some delicious goat cheese ice cream. I just couldn't get enough! This was graciously comped by our server, Jennifer because there was a minor snafu with our en tree's and Jennifer, I can't thank you enough! \nThey other dessert we had was the Chocolate Something and it was decadent and rich and delicious! \n\nOur party of four was there for over three hours and we never once felt rushed or that they wanted us out of there. Granted we spent close to $400 but we had some great food, excellent service and on the way out got to meet the man himself, Chef Tyler Florence who could not have been more kind or gracious! \n\nWe will definitely return as there were many other things on the menu we wanted to try and I must have that Foie Gras again!", "author": "Scott C."}

My coworkers leave Wishbone ads with Tyler's picture on my desk. I refer to Tyler as my Food Network husband.\n\nMy true real-life husband, realizing and accepting my love for Tyler booked a table for my birthday at Wayfare Tavern. Go real husband!\n\nI had a great time but I am sad to say (sorry Tyler) I was underwhelmed (still love you though).\n\nI really like the decor. Masculine but not overly done. Approachable. In fact, I think that everything about WT is approachable, nice and classy but very approachable.\n\nThe service was very nice. Everyone was friendly. Our waitress was a bit stiff initially but warmed up throughout the evening.\n\nOn to the food:\n\nAperitif - Happy Birthday to Me! We each had a glass of the sparkling wine. Yummy! Happy Birthday to Me!\n\nAppetizer:  I had the chilled lobster. Good not great but maybe that's my fault, I prefer crab. My husband had the steak tartare. That was really good. According to my hubs, steak tartare connoisseur, it's the best he's had in SF. It's served a bit too thin though, so maybe we'll get a larger portion next time.\n\nMain Course:  I had the special of the evening:  ribs w/ sides. Sorry to say that I was disappointed :( The beans were underdone and salty. The potato salad was also too salty. The coleslaw was underdressed. The ribs were a bit dry :( I'M SO SORRY!!! The corn on the cob was yummy. I did eat until I was full but still...I expected more.\n\nMy husband had the \"steak and eggs\". A petit filet with poached eggs. It was gooood. Maybe my husband is a better at ordering??? Husband said that the eggs were a bit too soft for him which is funny because hubs is french and the french love raw egg on everything. There's some crab in there somewhere but really it gets lost. Four stars for my hubby's dish.\n\nWe also shared the mac n cheese. It was good but again, too salty.\n\nI had a glass of cab with my dinner. MMMMM wine is good. Hubs had a glass of zin. MMMMMM\n\nDessert: Hubs had a chocolate mousse like thing in a big Daiquiri glass. I had 2 bites of if. It was good but really rich. Hubs ate every last bite so it wasn't too rich for him.\n\nI had the pineapple upside down cake with salted caramel ice cream and peanut brittle. I saw it on the menu and jumped for joy. I asked the waitress if it was from Bi-rite. No. Made at WT. Maybe that was a dumb question...but I looooove Bi-Rite's salted caramel ice cream. Asked waitress if it was good. She responded, \"Of course, everything is good here.\" She sounds so sincere. It was cute :) So i ordered it but sadly, I was disappointed. WTF? Maybe it's not meant to be, me and TF.\n\nThe cake wasn't very smooth. Maybe that's the nature of upside down cakes because I had one at Oliveto a few months back and I wasn't impressed then, same thing with the texture. The main issue with the dessert, the ice cream was very very salty. With the cake as a complete bite, good; alone, SALTY! *sigh*\n\nBummer because I really wanted to give WT 4 or 5 stars. i will return! I will! I am confident that everything will be cooked perfectly and that there will be no issues with saltiness.\n\nPS I did get my glimpse of TF. \n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!", "author": "Kiristen R."}

I am quite the TyFlor fan so I brought a camera in hopes of catching him.  When I arrived the place was buzzing with energy.  The hostess told me to just check back with her once my friend arrived.  I sat at the bar and ordered the Occidental Punch and my my, it was delicious.  Once my gf arrived I informed the hostess, and for some reason she told us that \"there were a few tables being cleared\" and that it would be just a few minutes.  This is the second time that I've had to wait longer despite a reservation.  Okay, that aside, here's the review on the food:\n\nPopovers = UH-MAYZ-ING!  I would go back just for those!\n\nPoutin = OMG; rich, succulent, and delicious.  Don't plan on eating much after this dish though as it's super rich.\n\nRoasted Liberty Farms Duck = I usually make it a habit of ordering food that I wouldn't make at home, so I opted for the duck.  This was really tasty.  The cherry sauce was so rich and full flavored.  I was still full from the poutin so my husband got to enjoy the leftovers haha.\n\nFried Chicken = This is what my gf ordered and thankfully she let me try a piece.  The crust is super flavorful and light.  The only complaint that it was a bit overpriced considering you don't get any sides with it.  Speaking of sides...\n\nMustard Braised Brussel Sprouts = Originally we weren't going to order a side dish on top of what we had, but we were so happy that we got the sprouts.  They were absolutely scrumptious.  I've never had them braised with mustard before, and with ham hock?  Oh heck yes.\n\nMeyer Lemon Huckleberry Mess = After much debate on what dessert to get, we decided to go with something more tart to cut through all of the deliciousness of our dinner.  The lemon curd was perfect and the huckleberry sorbet was a great compliment.  \n\nI definitely want to come back to try some other dishes...like the bone marrow (my gf wasn't adventurous enough) and the pork belly.  Maybe next time I'll catch a glimpse of the celebrity chef!  I would probably give 3.5 stars only because the service wasn't as stellar as I'd like it to be.

So fresh, so good, so flavorful, everything I imagined! The Poutine, on the other hand, was very salty. We couldn't even finish it. \n\nFor the entrees, we had the fried chicken, the mac and cheese as a side, and the Steak Frites. Just like all fried chicken (read my Hard Knox review). It's FRIED CHICKEN. I have yet to experience fried chicken  that blows my mind away and is worthy of my $22 dollars. The mac and cheese was just \"all right.\" I wish they used a thicker cheese, but it was decent. Nothing to complain about, but also nothing to rant and rave about either. The steak frites was probably the best entree of the three. It was soft and cooked perfectly. \n\nFor dessert, we had a lava cake type concoction and it was good! Nothing too crazy, but who doesnt love hot chocolate cake with ice cream?! Overall, good dinner, good company", "author": "Victoria B."}

He should really have his friend do a surprise shop of the restaurant because service is terrible!\n\nI came here w/a couple of my coworkers. Waiter asked us if we wanted sparkling water or stilled, and we asked specifically for sparkling. Same waiter came back in about 30 seconds, and started pouring stilled water in my cup and asked if I wanted stilled water!? I said no, we asked for sparkling-he then rolled his eyes at me and walked away, then another waiter came back to grab my half filled cup with stilled water. No apologies, nada. Terrible service already!? Anyway, I brushed that off to not let that ruin my experience.\n\nPopovers were great. HOWEVER, until I realized it took 1 hr and 15 minutes to get our food during lunch hour. We kept trying to flag anyone for assistance, no waiters gave eye contact. We finally got our 2nd piece of bread after 30 minutes, and we were starving by then. FINALLY-our food comes, all entrees and our appetizer out at the same time.  First-appetizer is supposed to come out early in order to stimulate our appetite--simple definition of what an appetizer is. Then I thought, does it take THAT long to make beef tartare when there's no cooking required, especially when there's nothing much but a raw organic egg on top? Failed.\n\n Waiter suggested fried chicken as highly recommended item. Here's my review: fried chicken was just fried w/rosemary. Nothing special, I kept thinking I should've went for Popeye's instead, and not paying $24. Beef Tartare, C'mon, using the same popovers as toast?? I was sick of popovers by then after waiting for an hour for our food. Beef Tartare didn't have much of a flavor. Mac and Cheese wasn't bad, but had better Mac N Cheese as well.\n\nAnyway, serious disappointment for all 3 of us and will not come again.", "author": "Carmen L."}

The place was packed for 9pm Tuesday night!\n\nService was very attentive and on point.  Conversational and friendly.  Professional and thankfully not stuffy.  \n\nI started with Shrimp Cocktail. It was good and real shrimp - not bay shrimp.  I think the red cocktail sauce could have more kick.  It was bland.  The shrimp, however, was wonderfully seasoned. \n\nMy entr\u00e9e was Fried Chicken and Mac and Cheese.  Impressive portions.  These two items made a full meal.  I was expecting smaller portions due to the nature of the restaurant.  This was a pleasant surprise.  I found the Chicken to be lightly fried and wonderfully seasoned.

Spread it on that ridiculously good puffy bread they give you and you're in heaven.\n\nEntrees:\nFried Chicken for me and Braised Short Rib for my gf.\nThe fried chicken was really flavorful. Not a regular batter but more of a light and panko'ish rolled batter. A bit on the salty side for me but tasty none the less. A nice touch was the roasted whole garlic it came with that you can squeeze out on pieces of your chicken. Totally changes the dish when you do that. \n\nThe short ribs were fork tender and the parsnip puree sooooo good. I kept stealing fork fulls of it from my gf.\n\nSides:\nMAC AND CHEESE!!!!! Order it. It's decadent. It's really decadent. But it's oh soooooo good. Our plate of mac and cheese was completely eaten clean by the end.\n\nNearing a coma we still ordered a desert to share. The Pumpkin pudding cake with honeycomb from Tyler's back yard and a yellow blue cheese. It was really interesting.

My expectations at WT were too high (my own fault) since I've been wanting to go for months.\n\nWe sat at the bar upstairs, which only seats 4 people, so we had a nice intimate relationship with the bartender/server. Mark was wonderful and he treated us so well. He made the whole experience much more pleasurable. \n\nHonestly, my favorite part of the meal was the popover (free). Served piping hot and full of egg and butter goodness, I found myself stuffing all my food in my popover. I even asked for more popovers when our entrees came. Here's the breakdown of our meal:\n\nPoutine\nMy issue was that you couldn't taste the truffle oil AND the fries weren't fried enough so they got soggy. I mean don't get me wrong... Short ribs, mozzarella cheese, truffle oil on top of fries...I ended up eating most of it but still...it could have been better. I will say that it is better than the poutine at the Salt House.\n\nBacon wrapped dates\nWe wanted to order the uni toast but they sold out. Dude, this was awful. Dates were WAY too sweet and the bacon wasn't crispy. It just felt oily and heavy and the combination did not work.\n\nDuck Gumbo\nHonestly, nothing to write home about. The slices of duck were kind of tough and I mean it's just gumbo and rice. It wasn't offensive or anything though, but I didn't really think it was anything special for $26.\n\nFried Chicken\nI'm not a big rosemary fan so I'm glad I didn't order it. My roommate thought her chicken was dry. I tried her piece of chicken and didn't think it was dry at all. Thought it was cooked pretty well. I liked that the batter wasn't heavy. However, the roommate didn't think the batter was crispy at all and did not think it was good fried chicken. I actually thought the fried chicken wasn't that bad, but definitely not the best in SF.\n\nSticky toffee pudding\nIt was a sticky toffee cake with a scoop of ginger ice cream. Ice cream is house made and I really like the spiciness of it with the sweetness of the cake. It actually reminded me of the lumberjack cake at Frances because it has dates in it. Not bad... but I'd want to try a different dessert next time.\n\nI'd really love to go back to WT but try different foods. I wouldn't order anything that I ate that night again (except for the popovers). I'm really interested in trying the uni toast and the meat loaf. Also, I hear that the menu does change. \n\nWT didn't meet my expectations but I look forward to going back and trying different things. Also, service is stupendous.", "author": "Jackie T."}

Both were delicious. The waiter also brought over popovers, which I believe were complimentary. The poutine had a VERY strong scent of truffle oil-- definitely not something I want to gobble up and eat as it's such a rich flavor.

We were seated promptly and the service was adequate. The restaurant is beautiful. I picture myself coming in on a foggy SF night; this would be the perfect place to stop in, have a hearty meal and a solid beer. \n\nPop Overs: Freshly baked, light, and delicious. I actually think this was the best part of the meal. In fact, I'd come here just for them. \n\nDeviled Eggs: bland, but the yolks were creamy and the presentation was nice. I think it would have been better with more capers. \n\nKabocha Squash Soup: I was really hoping for a stronger flavor profile ...my gf actually added salt and pepper to give it some kick.\n\nRoasted Organic Broccolli: Delicious. Unfortunately, this was served as an appetizer even though we wanted it to come with our entree...so it was cold by the time the  entree came around. However, they were good when warm. \n\nBraised Beef Short Ribs: really salty! I love truffles, and that flavor with the creamy potatoes could not tone this down. \n\nI'm not sure if the kitchen was backed up, but it seemed like we waited a long time between courses. By the end of the meal, we really didn't want to wait around for dessert. \n\nI also had one of their house drinks, but can't say it was memorable. I didn't feel any alcohol, and after finishing it was ready to try something else. The waitress never asked if I wanted another drink, and I wasn't trying to get hammered, so I had water the rest of the night. \n\nI have to admit, I was really craving sushi the night we came, and we just ran a half marathon...so maybe my conflicted mental state and physical soreness played into this.

You can sit downstairs and watch the chefs prepare the food and sit in the bar or near the fireplace. We sat upstairs. It was lovely up there as well. Also the service is fantastic! I have no complaints there!\n\nWe started off with the blue cheese wedge salad. It was wonderful. I loved that it was lite and tasty. It was honestly, one of the best I've ever had. They then served us these piping hot popovers. You cut into them and ya get a steam facial! Again, wonderful! Ok so far so good. We were impressed. Oh but wait, we ordered the fried chicken and 3 sides and shared everything. The chicken came out nice and hot and a pretty good portion but  the 3 sides were pretty small. We ordered broccoli, mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese. There is so much hype about the fried chicken that my husband and I were like what's the big deal here. I mean, it was nice and hot and tender but I guess I'm partial to my Italian mama's wonderful super cripsy and moist fried chicken. I dunno I guess I have to say it was good! When ya say good that means it was not great! The broccolli was not good at all. The mashed potatoes were pretty good (almost great) but the portion size was barely enough to wet my lips. The mac and  cheese was good but once again not the best I've had. So for now I'm giving it  3.75 stars but we're gonna give it another chance.

When we got there, it was right at 5pm, when they just opened.  We were a bit worried that we didn't have the reservation - but the maitre d's took us in to the chef's counter (it's not the chef's table as you'd know, it's just the area where you can see the chefs cooking - which provided quite a show throughout our meal).\n\nThe server came within seconds to see if we wanted drinks.  The wine list is pretty impressive and well priced, and the tab beer menu's also pretty out of ordinary.  We opted for a couple beers to start with.\n\nThe menu, as anticipated, boasted a good array of comfort foods.  Nothing out of ordinary or crazy interpretations of regular dishes.

You spread a dallop of the marrow onto crispy bread pieces provided and top it with some picked onions - once it goes down in your mouth, it's pure heaven...nicely done.\n2. Deviled eggs - creamy and tangy.  I would have preferred it to be less salty though.\n3. Fried chicken - very well executed and the coating was just perfect.  the problem i had though - the meat wasn't seasoned consistently.  when i had the wing piece it was bland, but then the breast piece was well seasoned and moist....consistency please!\n4. Pot roast - I didn't really care for this one too much.  The sauce was way too salty, but then the sauce failed to really penetrate into the meat.  The meat itself was tender and moist though.  The mashed potato and the eggplant were a nice complement to the dish.\n\nAfter a couple fernets and camparis, and some espressos, we left the place happy.\n\nA note on service - the server was so hasty and kept asking if we were done with the meal - he made us feel antsy and nervous.  and to spite that, we took all the sweet time we could.  after all - i am the king!! i kid, i kid...

I'm glad to report that I was wrong.  The service and food are both incredibly well thought out and delivered. \n\nThe place is alpha male meets Parisian bistro - a very good way to impress a lady.  Taxidermy and chinoiserie don't normally go but here it manages give a nod to the history of San Francisco.  \n\nA group of us came here to celebrate a Tyler-crazy friend's birthday and was tickled pink to see that he was working the line.  In fact, for most of our meal we had a very nice view of the open kitchen.  I had to ask our server if he could come by and wish her a Happy Bday.  She said that she would see what she could do.  \n\nIn the mean time we ordered a bottle of Pine Ridge and began the celebration.  I love that Tyler (or his Wine Director) chose to give Cali wines their respect and fill his wine list with them.  Way to win over locavores like me.\n\nWe started out with local oysters Rockefeller - incredibly tasty little kumamotos with cheese, spinach and bacon.  The steak tartare was very meaty with capers and lovely grilled bread.  I feel compelled to order bone marrow when I see it on a menu - this version is nice but could be bigger.  We also tried the deviled eggs which didn't have enough flavor for me.\n\nI ordered the crispy halibut with Romano beans and watercress (if you do not recall, I had fried chicken just last Monday).  I loved that our server asked me how I wanted my fish done - that is way it is supposed to be! I I tried some of  the butterflied pork chop - I'd come here to get that again.  I also filched a piece of my friend's fried chicken and it was amazingly similar to Ad hoc's.  \n\nThe bday gal ordered the peach pie which was super tasty and served with goat cheese ice cream.  The peaches were incredible - tender but not an overcooked mush mess.  Since I'm mildly obsessed with upside down pineapple cake, I had to try Wayfare's version.  The desserts were huge - a whole table can share one.  \n\nAfter dinner, we headed up to the pool room which is open to the public if no one has reserved it.  I can see this being a great place to watch the game while having an anchor steam and pretending to play some pool (b/c I really stink at it).  \n\nAs we headed back downstairs, we realized that the bday girl didn't get her photo with Chef Florence.  So we hovered by the kitchen like groupies and got pictures taken with him.  Chef Florence was incredibly gracious and totally charming; I'm sure he gets this A LOT.

That waiter, he was unattentive, apathetic, and generally unpleasant for a restaurant of this caliber.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just used to Southern Hospitality.  \n\nBest dishes in our experience were the tomato and bread soup, avocado salad, burger, lamb, and creamed corn. Each were well executed with an interesting and unexpected note.  The worst dish was the pork chop; the marcona butter just didn't work either texturally or in taste.  I thought, \"how can you go wrong with marcona almonds and pork?\"  Apparently, you can, so just avoid that dish.\n\nThe atmosphere is just incredible and my husband noted that he wants to decorate his \"man room\" in a similar style.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-07", "description": "Food: 4 stars\nService: 3 stars - 4 stars (I really liked our waiter despite the long wait for the food)\n\nAfter looking on Open Table for available dinner spots Monday night, bf and I decided on Wayfare Tavern as it was spotlighted as a top 10 hot spot. After looking up the menu on the restaurant's website, I realized that this was Tyler Florence's new restaurant that all the food blogs (Grub Street, Eater, etc) were buzzing about. In anticipation, I read the most recent articles about the restaurant and what to order (Thank you, Yelpers!). \n\nHere's how my experience went:\n\nDecor: old American, dark wood, warm lighting. Open kitchen view, which I love! Space is medium size, not really set up for large groups but maybe they can accommodate. \n\nFood:\n\nPopover: like everyone who have reviewed the restaurant already, the popovers are really that good. I wish I asked for more... \n\nSalt Roasted Bone Marrow: Delicious, complex salty and slight sweet flavors (from the molasses butter). I like the added sweetness since it makes this dish different from the other restaurants who are serving the popular bone marrow appetizer. \n\nSanta Barbara Sea Urchin: Oh, this is the only dish that made me sad. Sea urchin is such a delicate, rich flavor on its own that when topped onto the sweet corn puree, I could barely taste it. At least from what I could taste, it was fresh. \n\nOrganic Fried Chicken: Very moist and flavorful. Loved all the plentiful herbs that was cooked with the chicken. I would order this again. (So excited I had leftovers!)\n\nRoasted Summer Squash and Tomatoes: Nice side to the fried chicken. Slightly sweet summer squash with sun dried tomatoes and kalamata olives. Wouldn't have thought to mix those three ingredients but goes well together. \n\nWayfare Burger: Very good burger, wayyy better than Marlowe (people rave about Marlowe's burger but I thought it was too salty). I'm not a burger aficionado but I enjoyed it quite well. Tasted fresh, not overly complex (like those burgers with 10 different toppings that cover the taste of the meat). Love how you can put an egg on top! (Eggs make everything taste better... five spice chicken with egg! steak and egg! hehehe I can go on and on ...)\n\nService: Despite what my bf might say, I didn't think the service was that bad. As the restaurant has only been open for about two weeks, there's a lot of coordination that is still being worked out. I really liked our waiter (wish I got his name...). He was very excited that the WT was finally open and I couldn't help but be enthusiastic with him. Food did take a lot longer than it should so be warned if you go within the first month or so, dinner might be longer than anticipated. I think I may stop by in about two months and try the restaurant again.\n\nP.S. Chef Florence is working at the restaurant. I kept on staring over to the kitchen (not very slick, I had to turn around since my back was to the kitchen) and asked so many questions that our waiter asked if I worked in the restaurant industry (I wish!).", "author": "Jane K."}

Ladies if you like \"suits\" come here for happy hour. \n\nSERVICE: From the hostess, to bartender and server. Service was not outstanding or memorable but they were professional and got the job done. Sometimes that's all you need. \n\nCOCKTAILS: Very well crafted so try one of their drinks. If you order a rum and coke I hope the bartender slaps you. \n\nFOOD: The pot roast was to die for!!!!! It melted in your mouth like butter. Mmmm. \n\n\nCons: \n\nFRIED CHICKEN: This was a huge disappointment!!! Maybe they were having an off day but this was unacceptable. The chicken was not crispy at all. It was super greasy and had too much of an herbal flavor. Even though there are more pros then cons I am giving this 3 stars because as I tried to eat my chicken I start noticing it was undercooked!

The eggs were phenomenal with the perfect amount of kick and not heavy with mayo. The carrot soup was a perfect start to the meal on a rainy day; i was mild with a spoonful of cream at the bottom of the bowl that gave a nice compliment with each spoonful. The wedge salad wasn't impressive but I loved the thick pieces of bacon!\n\nI ordered the burger with the egg topper for my meal. Holy cow- literally! Excellent burger with bacon, I could only eat half but it was divine! So much for my \" I\"m not eating beef \" stance that lasted about 2 weeks.\n\nI sat downstairs in a booth with my friends. The lunch crowd got kicking around 12:30 and it was quite busy but not as congested as the dinner/happy hour crowd.\n\nThere is multi-level dining with two bars, and private room on the second floor. The decor is rustic with hunting \"trophies\" gracing the walls. The downstairs bathrooms are my favorite. The black and white checkered floors and cartoon caricatures that decorate the walls give you the feeling Bing Crosby is about the turn the corner.\n\nEach person in our party of 5 thoroughly enjoyed their meals and can't wait to go back. From what I hear the fried chicken is divine!\n\nAfter  a second bottle of wine I finished my meal with a cappuccino. I believe the waitress said they used Peet's coffee but I can't confirm.

Walking into Wayfare Tavern, I was head over heels.  Devilish dim lighting, dark wooden beams and ceilings, old-fashioned decor, a printed carpet covered staircase at its entrance and servers in white coats, I felt as if I had been teleported to the early 1900's.\n   After a couple of old school, expertly crafted cocktails, we sat down to order. Handmade giant buttery and flaky popovers came out within seconds. The best complimentary \"bread\" course to date.  Period.  After we devoured the savory baked goods, grilled Calamari with crispy polenta and a chorizo tomato jam was the beginning of our lavish meal.  Chris' Filet Mignon made with shallot confit, bone marrow bordelaise, fresh marjoram and crispy torpedo onion was flawlessly cooked with a medium rare temp and the most fantastic fixings to ever accompany a prime cut of steak.  It cut like butter and was so diverse in rich, fragrant flavors.  Saving the best part for last- my Organic Fried Chicken, prepared with a buttermilk brine and fried to perfection with roasted garlic, lemon and an abundance of woody herbs was a mound of meat I'd deem magical.

The bartender tonight was sure pouring on the heavy side.\n\nWhen it was time for dinner, I was on a buzz. We ordered a bottle of Pinot noir to start and the poutine for an appetizer. the appetizer was amazing! French fries with a truffle gravy and braised short rib.

The macaroni and cheese was also a little little to be disired. it wasn't creamy enough.

So much that I'm writing this review when I'm really supposed to be finishing my stats take-home exam.\n\nWe arrived at 8PM sharp and saw people lingering around the host stand and the bar was unbelievably packed with the usual FiDi crowd, sipping on wine and munching on delicious Deviled Eggs (which we ordered for our appetizer as well). I almost felt a bit out of place amongst the business suits and manolos. What's that phrase again... oh yes, the crowd here comes correct. \n\nWe ordered a round of drinks before we were seated upstairs, squeezed between two tables--so close that my friend actually had to move the table for me to get to the shared long bench along the wall. (Damn, am I getting chubby?) It was a good thing that I was slightly tipsy because the dining room was more noisy than I'd expected, which I did not mind. I enjoyed the entire atmosphere. It felt friendly, outgoing, and yes, quite loud and lively.\n\nOk enough talk about the feel of Wayfare Tavern. The food here was wonderfully prepared and served. \n\nThe meal started out with the Popover, serve promptly after we ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir. The Popover was flaky on the outside and warm on the inside. Delicious, I'd take this over bread any day.\n\nThe wine selection was great also, and even the least expensive bottle of Pinot Noir on their wine list satisfied. \n\nSo we copied our swanky businessmen downstairs and ordered the Deviled Eggs. The yoke was whipped to a light fluff and perfectly seasoned. Then came our entrees: Duck Gumbo and the famous Fried Chicken. Both dishes looked simple on the menu, but it went beyond our expectations when the entree actually came. Yes, only Tyler Florence can make fried chicken look so good. Every piece was juicy but cooked all the way through. And the skin was fried to a beautiful golden color and had the right amount of seasoning. And the Duck Gumbo... oh, the thick pieces of Duck leg confit and the warm and hearty gumbo loaded with duck sausages... (sorry, wiping away drool) the dish was everything I wanted it to be and then some.\n\nWe were too full for dessert, hence 4 stars instead of 5... after all, you can't have a complete meal without dessert.

Our food took way too long and when it finally did arrive, our waiter ran over to say \"Oh I was just about to check on what was taking so long.\" \n\nI ordered the \"Petaluma Chicken Paillard\" (which I'd had before) and although it was good, it was not what the menu detailed it to be. Instead of having smoked bacon and chicken jus, there was some sort of fig/fruit reduction instead (which ended up leaving me with a burnt/bitter aftertaste). I wish the waiter would have notified me of this, because I would have ordered something else. Overall, I was extremely upset by the service and will probably not be going out of my way to return anytime soon.", "author": "Megan O."}

The restaurant is dark, with a tavernous look, there are dead animals on walls and the food is heavy, filling and delicious.\n\nThe popovers to start were pretty delicious and much more unique then just giving some bread and butter.\n\nSince I had a big lunch that day, I decided to skip the bone marrow and get a carrot soup. The soup was nice and creamy and it was delicious. Probably filled me up a little too much though before the entrees. \n\nGoing with my sister was a very strategic move because she can't eat that much, so whatever she orders I get to eat more than half of it.\n\nMy sister ordered the Wayfare Burger and I ordered the fried chicken based on the praise it gets on yelp.\n\nThe Wayfare Burger was really good and probably my favorite in the city. The meat was a perfect juicy medium rare and the bun worked perfectly. The Mt. Ham cheese was creamy and went perfectly with the meat and the onions and bacon added a salty crunch. A really great burger.\n\nThe burger came with a side of fries that were pretty good. Nothing mindblowing, but good nonetheless, but I couldn't eat them all because I was so damn full.\n\nThe fried chicken was pretty tasty. The meat itself was very very juicy and you could definitely taste the herbs and lemon infused in the brine. My only issue with the chicken was that the crispy skin wasn't dense enough. The exterior had a good taste, but it wasn't very thick and I feel the chicken needed to be fried longer or the chicken needed more coating to make a thicker crust. Good chicken which I would recommend.\n\nFor dessert, the server recommended the spiced pumpkin pudding cake with blue cheese, candied walnuts and honeycomb.\n\nThe dessert was extremely good and I would highly recommend it. The combination between the cake, blue cheese, walnuts and honeycomb combined to make a dessert that exemplifies sweet and salty goodness. A great end to a great meal.\n\nThe only reason I don't give five stars is for the chicken. It was good, but it wasn't five star worthy. I will definitely be back to try the bone marrow and some of the other entrees that sound amazing.", "author": "Thomas D."}

From the wood used on the bar, to the tiles on the floor, to the cutlery, and MOST importantly the staff and the food.  What a fabulous dining experience!  The entire staff had genuine smiles and you could tell they enjoyed the place and the food.\n\nWhile we waited for the rest of our party to arrive, we ordered drinks at the bar.  I ordered a Greyhound and the grape-fruit juice was freshly squeezed; always a good sign to me!  Not long after finishing my drink, a staff member came over to where we were standing asking if I needed another or a glass of water.  I love that attentiveness!\n\nOn to my favorite part- the food!  The PopOvers/Yorkshire Pudding served (rather than a dumpy breadbasket) were fresh from the oven.  They had a delightful flaky and buttery texture and I would have gladly eaten 6 given the chance.\n\nAPPS\nFor appetizers we shared the deviled eggs and grilled calamari.  I am not a mayo-lover so was thrilled to have the Deviled Eggs made with creme fraiche, mustard, and then topped with fried capers... yes I will eat them every day thankyouverymuch.  Calamari is one of those foods that is hard to cook properly.  Delfina in the Mission always has a great grilled calamari, and WT was just as awesome.  There was a nice spice added to the oil drizzled on top and we all enjoyed it!\n\nENTREES\n85% of the time I eat a vegetarian diet, but nothing compares to a good burger.  Wow.  the Le Grande burger with Peteluma fried egg, bacon and Cowgirl Creamery Mt Tam Cheese made me go weak in the knees.  Honestly, anything served with Mt Tam is a winner in my book; however on a burger it was truly a transcendent experience.  The perfect compliment to contain all of the burger components was the freshly baked brioche bun.\n\nMy other friend ordered the fried chicken and there was a plate of empty bones remaining at the end of the meal.  I tried the batter for the chicken and the combination of rosemary, lemon and goodness tasted most excellent.  Our final companion de-VOU-ered the Hangtown Fry.\n\nIf mac-and cheese is on the menu somewhere, you can be sure I will order it.  I was equally in love with the decadent bites of pasta with cheesy bliss as I was with everything else that was served.  This is one RICH mac and cheese so I recommend sharing it with a group!  Or........ go run a couple miles before dinner to earn the calories and sighs of happiness that come with every bite.\n\nDESSERT\nIt was quite a difficult decision to make, but after a long conversation we settled on the Peach Pie and Banana Pudding.  I have never had pie crust so flaky and tender at the same time!  The Frog Hollow peaches inside couldn't have tasted better.  As for the Banana Pudding, Tyler said it was his father's recipe and I would now like to ask Mr. Florence to marry me because that custard took my breath away.\n\nNeedless to say we left with a few pant buttons undone and smiles all around.  I am a fan of Tyler Florence, and asked if he ever comes to greet his patrons.  Sure enough, he showed up two minutes later and couldn't be more lovely.  You can feel his passion for food as he describes the dishes and it then translates to every single bite.\n\nWe will be customers for life.  Thank you for an amazing meal.", "author": "Kyra W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-25", "description": "Food: 4 stars\nService: 5 stars\n\nFirst off - the portions are generous. The size of the apps were probably entree size for most fine(r) dining establishments.\n\nWe had:\nbone marrow: Sad to say, a miss. I don't know if it was necessarily the preparation. I've had European/American style marrow at other places and I found it to be bland and not too appealing. So I couldn't really take away any stars for this.\n\nsteak tartare: The texture as a bit more \"ground-up\" than I am accustomed to, but it was really flavorful and I enjoyed it. The half portion was huge. My favorite is still Chez Papa, though!\n\navocado/hearts of palm salad: I have to admit that the salad was the best appetizer we had. My boyfriend who normally hates avocados, loved it. It was really fresh with just the right amount of tang from the dressing and some crunchiness from the hearts of palm. I wish it was still on the menu.\n\nfried chicken: Not the crunchy fried chicken you may expect. It's sort of a baked chicken, almost. It was the juiciest chicken I've ever had. SO good. I was a bit worried when I saw rosemary (I think rosemary can be overpowering) but the herbs were great and really complemented the chicken. I want to say there was some fried sage on it that was really tasty. Believe me, I never thought fried sage would be something I would comment on.\n\npork chop: Really juicy, cooked well, and what can I say? Tasted like a pork chop should. It came with a great (sweet) almond paste and grilled peach. I also really liked the fact that the waiter \"warned\" us on how the kitchen normally cooked it - medium. I've been to places that didn't warn us on medium-cooked pork and while I didn't mind, it would have been nice to make that call myself. So if you freak out at pinkish pork, beware. But I trust Tyler's pork is handled with care...and our tummies were happy and were not affected at all.\n\nsteak and eggs: I only got a teeny taste of this, but it was good. A bit strong on the sauce, maybe. The steak was really tender and the eggs looked perfectly cooked.\n\nmac and cheese: Personally, I like my mac and cheese a bit sharper, but it was pretty good. Really creamy.\n\ncreamed corn: I loved this. You could definitely still taste the freshness and sweetness of the corn.\n\npineapple upside down cake: Really good. I almost wish it was smaller - that way, there would be more caramel-y/burnt sugar goodness. The middle of the cake was still good - but I prefer the edges.\n\npeach pie/tarte: As with the theme of our dinner - a large portion and good. The goat's milk ice cream was really good - it went really well with the pie\n\nbanana pudding: The only thing I really hated. Disclaimer - I really don't love bananas. I do like banana cream pie and I do eat banana/nilla wafer pudding...but I just could not eat this. I think it was the hit of citrus in it, but something about this pudding was chalky, overly sweet in a fake banana sort of way, and just plain blech. Those at the table who did like banana pudding thought it was good, but it was not the favorite dessert at the table and was the only one not finished.\n\nOverall, the experience was really good. Oh, and you have to go for the popovers! They are free and they are one of the best things there.\nService was amazing, helpful and extremely friendly without being overbearing.\n\nThe atmosphere is sort of vintage, upscale hunting club...but still pretty enough to count as a \"romantic\" dinner. I think it would be interesting to sit at the counter facing the kitchen next time!", "author": "fi l."}

Filling into the pews of our booth, our waitress brought out our ordered drinks along with magical pop-overs. These buttery, flakey buns was nothing short of crack in bread form. I had to refrain from continuing to order more as I knew I probably could fill my belly with these things alone. Known for their fried chicken, I knew what I had to order. Probably one of the best fried chickens I've ever had. It was crispy, juicy and surprisingly not too greasy or oily. Our party paired our entrees with sides of mac and cheese which was expectedly good, but I've honestly had better. And to close it off, we ended our meals with adorable espressos served in what looked like mugs for little girl tea parties and a diabetic-combo of mud pie and bread pudding. I'm not a huge dessert person, so I wasn't gaga over these, but they were good. \n\nBesides the good food, I have to say that the service was pretty stellar. Hosts weren't annoyed a-holes when we walked up, the waitress did a great job of pretending that she genuinely cared about our meal, and our waters and complimentaries were consistently refilled.

So a friend living here in SF recommended this place, but she had never dined here, her experience was just drinks at the bar.  \nSo of course I yelped it. And thanks to Yelp, he made reservations.  I didn't think we would need it being that it was a Sunday night, but apparently we did.\n\nI love the old rustic decor with dark wood throughout the cool staircase leading up to the 2nd dining area.  The inviting bars on each level was definitely an added plus.\nTwo of my girlfriends showed up so they joined us for dinner.  They reseated us at a better table on the 1st floor over looking the chefs... create their flavorful dishes.\nThe wine list was excellent.  I'm so fortunate to have such a generous friend, because the choices he made were outstanding.  And I know, if it were just my girlfriends and I, I'm sure we would have been intimidated with the price of the wine bottles.  \n\nSo let's just say, if you are on a budget, this is not the place to go, because it is pricey.  As far as the food... the apps we tried were: the burrata, deviled eggs, and east coast oysters... my favorite of the 3 was definitely the delicious burrata. Oh and the fresh warm light texture bread... almost like a croissant... sinfully yummy.  So my friend ordered the the infamous organic fried chicken, the girls both had the grass-fed beef burger, and I chose the grilled pork... and we also had to try the mac & cheese. We all were quiet as we all devoured our succulent choices.\nI think we were all pretty satiated, but my friend insisted on ordering dessert. None of us could decide, so he ordered the top 3 that the server suggested.  OMG each and every one was so bitter sweet... I hated tasting it... knowing the caloric content would kill me, but they were so ungodly good, Ugh.  I was really hoping they would suck:(\nMy favorite was the nutty tart, but the butterscotch cake and chocolate cream pie were fabulous as well.

His restaurant in the Financial District is everything you would expect from a man who has a show on Foodnetwork (Tyler's Ultimate).  They are doing things at this restaurant like brining their own locally-grown olives (some of the best olives I've tasted outside of Italy), making incredible bread & butter pickles and baking their bread.  The emphasis at Wayfare Tavern is on  ORGANIC, Artisan, hand-crafted food.  I had the lamb, which is procured from local farmers who are raising them on good old fashioned sweet grass.  You can taste it in the meat.  My boyfriend had the braised pork shoulder, which was layered in dense unctuous slow-cooked yumminess with fall off the bone tenderness.  We also shared the oysters, which were salty, briney good.  The atmosphere is cozy and feels like a home I once dined in while visiting the Scottish moores...very old-world elegance without trying too hard.  Our waiter was especially attentive and made us feel like Family.  I also found their wine list intriguing and innovative.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-04", "description": "I don't give out five star ratings willy nilly.   My first experience at one of my favorite celebrity chef's Wayfare Tavern was nothing short of excellent.  I've met Mr. TF, personally, at some food conventions, have tasted his cooking,  and found him to be approachable and he IS a very good chef. I have most of his cookbooks, and have made several of his recipes. So, I kind of feel like I know his cooking style. Tyler has brought his own style to the Wayfare Tavern and it works.  His cooking, to me, is unpretentious.   He's all about color, texture, presentation-- and doesn't fall short on flavor.  \n\nWith that said, we arrived as a party of four.  We were promptly greeted, and seated, though we arrived 30 minutes early.  We were seated upstairs-- a bit of a schlep, since I have a knee disability that made my progress a bit slow.  To be honest, I didn't look around at the dining room much. I was hungry, and was more interested in visiting with my friends, who rode BART from the East Bay to have dinner with us.\n\nEach of us ordered a different menu item-- the \"famous\" fried chicken (for my husband), lamb shanks with horseradish mashed potatoes, the pork chop with braised red cabbage and spaetzle and (for me) the pumpkin ravioli, with Chanterelles, Crispy Kale, toasted pecans and cranberries with a brown butter sage sauce.\n\nAs was foretold, we were served delicious popovers.  I stuck with eating only one, so I would have room for dinner.  My friend ordered the butter lettuce salad, which had a beautiful \"stacked\" presentation.  I had a taste of the Green Goddess Dressing, which was actually quite lite and I love tarragon.  \nOur meals arrived without a terribly long wait-- about 20 minutes.  I had a taste of the lamb shank sauce, and it was divine; the potatoes served with it were very creamy with a slight bite of horseradish.  I tasted a bit of the fried chicken, and it was tender and had a nice crust to it. Loved the herbs, though I was surprised that there was nothing served on the side! I was glad I didn't order the chicken, as I wanted something a little different.  With that said, my pumpkin ravioli was as good as I had hoped it would be. It was a generous portion, with a very creamy filling.  Loved all the flavors and textures from the Chanterelles, Kale, nuts and cranberries.  Hubs ordered a side of mashed potatoes that were very silky in texture, loaded with butter-- but a little pricey at $8, since everyone else had other sides-- such as the Shishito Peppers (had some surprise heat to it), and mac 'n cheese (this were good).  We ordered two glasses of wine, two glasses of Prosecco (for me) and one beer. \n\nFor dessert, I could not resist trying the Sticky Toffee Pudding with clotted cream.  The dessert was a small serving, and I was glad. It was exactly how sticky toffee pudding should be.   We each ordered coffee, which was served in a French press-- fresh and hot, and perfectly made. Total dinner tab came to $245.00, which I though was very reasonable-- for San Francisco, and for what we got.\nThe small brown butter cookies, that came with out dinner check was a nice touch. \nI read the bad reviews, and it goes to show that you just can't please everyone.  Some of the worst reviews seemed to come when the restaurant first opened. In my case, I would definitely come here again, when I visit San Francisco.  We had no complaints about the service, which was very attentive. Kudos to Tyler Florence for the success of this restaurant.  Everyone in our party was very happy with the food.   \nThe ambience is very dark, though, so I could not take any decent photos, unless I used a flash-- and I don't like to do that.

However becasue of his name and fame, I had such high hopes up..and for the amount we paid ($45  a person without alcohol or dessert) I expected more!\n\nThe biggest issue was that everything we had was super salty. Here's a rundown of all the food i ate/tasted:\n\nPoutine: The poutine was sitting in salty sauce, although the truffle oil/slices were amazing! \n\nFried chicken: The fried chicken that everyone raved about, was way too over salted, that it took away from the thyme and other herbs.\n\nPork Shank: HUGE portion, big bone size of my face! It was sittig in really salty sauce too, and i couldnt really taste the meat.. unfortunate!\n\nMousse: friend got the mousse pate and that was really good,but also really really salty.\n\nDate wrapped in bacon: now THAT was SUPER SUPER yummy.

My recommendation is to sit at the kitchen bar where you can watch the line chefs prepare your dinner.\n\nIndulgent food.   Think rich and heavy.   After a platter of deviled eggs and the burger (with another fried egg on top) I had to go home and sleep for 10 hours.    On another visit the pork chop was simply perfectly cooked.   You could taste the smoked flavors of the wood grilled salmon.   And don't forget the padron peppers.\n\nFort Ross Pinot and Handley Pinot Gris by the glass were more than sufficient.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-06-25", "description": "For those under-a-rock dwellers among you, Wayfare Tavern is the signature restaurant in the empire helmed by Tyler Florence: author, Food Network personality, chef, master of hospitality.\n\nWayfare conveys a specific image, embodies a specific zeitgeist, and excels at brand consistency.  The room itself is fabulous.  If Ralph Lauren designed a restaurant in the 1940s, it would look like Wayfare.  Old school all the way: dark wood floors, antiqued sconces, weathered wood tables, Blue Note blaring through the speakers, lively (too?) conversations, ginormous flower arrangements - Wayfare has it all.\n\nServices is professional and friendly (though there are lapses - more later).  The menu is comfort fare through and through.  The popovers - when you get them (more on that later as well) are superb - light, airy and a perfect vessel for the salty (x2) butter that comes with them.  The signature fried chicken - my choice - was cooked to perfection, although as with most fried chicken, the dark meat was more succulent than the breast.   The butter lettuce with Green Goddess dressing was perfectly dressed, and the grapefruit segments pair unbelievably well with the creaminess of the dressing.  The chocolate cream pie was silky and actually tasted like chocolate.\n\nNow.  The service.\n\nWe were seated on the second floor, and our server was handling not only our table and our four-top neighbor, but also at least twenty people in the private room nearby.  This caused her obvious stress and occasional lapses in service (where the hell did she go? Did she forget our coffee?), though that issue rests with management, not with her.  My humble suggestion would be that the private room be serviced by a designated staff member rather than someone in the main dining room.  Everyone will be better off.  Given her workload, she did her best, but our sometime treatment as a tertiary customer (who cares about the two-top when there's a private room and a four-top in my stable?) left me wanting.\n\nFinally, the popovers.  Ever have one of those restaurant experiences where you get the sinking feeling that every table around you (and I'm not exaggerating - EVERY TABLE) is getting something that you're not?  That's our popover story.  We spent a good twenty minutes watching everyone else getting bestowed with these little bites of magic.  After watching the fifth table get theirs, I politely (and I do mean politely) ask the man with the popover basket if he might be willing to share the bounty denied us.  He, in quick passing, says yes, then runs off.  A few minutes later, still popover-less, the manager shows up to take our salad plates (which had been sitting for quite some time), whereupon we asked him, politely, would it be possible to get a popover that everyone else in this place but us seems to be enjoying?  Like magic, popover boy shows up.  Are they good?  Hell, yes.  Is it acceptable for inconsistency in service like that?  Actually, not.\n\nOverall, I liked this place.  Would I come back?  Probably.  Would I adjust my service expectations?  Absolutely.", "author": "James M."}

The bartender took a long time to take our order and then when we asked for an appetizer he told us \"the food order will have to wait.\" When I asked for some bread in the mean time, he repeated himself: \"the food order will have to wait.\" Later, the woman passing out bread zoomed by and I chased after her but couldn't find her. I asked another staff member where I could find the bread and she asked me if I had ordered food (not sure why that was relevant). When I said we had tried but weren't allowed to order food, she said she would come help us. Once we had ordered from her, I asked if the tab could be transferred to our table when we sat for dinner and she said we could close out the tab now or they could transfer the tab if we preferred (seeming to want us to close out the tab at the bar). When our table was ready, the hostess came up to us let us know our table was ready. When we asked if we could have the tab transferred, she said we would have to tell her what we ordered so that she could go tell the bartender and get the tab transferred. (?) This seemed inconvenient for all and strange, considering how commonly we have transferred the tab at other places. Once we sat, table service was good. We got a printed \"happy anniversary\" card - thoughtful but generic. Overall, the food was good but we were not pleased. It seems better staffing at the bar, a more attentive staff, and an effort to make transferring the tab easier would bring big improvements to the service at Wayfare Tavern.", "author": "J B."}

Honestly, I expected a bit more. All in all, the atmosphere is decent, the food is good and the price is reasonable. Its a bit of a 3 star restaurant, but I would go back and see if maybe some of the other dishes have more of a wow factor.\n\n1) I know it is a small restaurant, but the tables are very close together. Luckily, since we were the last table along the bench I was able to scoot my table over a little without anyone noticing. This kept me from being elbow to elbow with my neighbor.\n\n2) The music was a little loud and you had to talk over it a bit, which was annoying because you are so close to the party next to you everyone can here what you're saying.\n\n3) I had the Butcher's Filet. It was good; I had it cooked Medium rear. It was tender, but a little stringy, Overall, the beef was good. However, it was served with a reduction of caramelized onions on each of the three small filets. Then each one was served with an onion ring, and then there were shallots. It was almost like Onion Three Ways (I know, a shallot isn't really an onion, but close enough). I can still taste the onion the day after.\n\n4) The menu said twice baked potato, which typically consists of a baked potato being scooped out, mashed up with other ingredients like butter and sour cream, and stuffed back in the potato and baked a little longer with maybe some cheese. What I received was just a loaded baked potato. I heard the person next to me comment to his date, \"I don't see what it twice baked about this potato,\" so it wasn't just me.\n\nI didn't have room for dessert, but they did give my wife and I a little piece of their coffee cake, which was really good. Oh, by the way, my wife had the charred corn and farmers cheese agnolotti, and they were really delicious. We just wished there were more of them on the plate.", "author": "Steven G."}

For parties over 10 you have to reserve the private Billiards Room upstairs and you're limited to a prix fixe menu which means shared starters and desserts, and an individual entree for $70/person. There's one giant table in the room and you feel like you're eating in someones man cave, which is actually kind of awesome.\n\nWhat we ate:\n1. Starter puff - who doesn't love warm puffed bread that looks like a bread version of a chicken drumstick?!? A cute way to start the meal.\n2. Appetizers - we got the steak tartare, seared ahi tuna with beet salad, and the burrata on crustini. Of the 3 the stead tartare was by far the best, it looked less than appetizing but tasted great. Ahi tuna was medicore. I typically love burrata but their version was boring and didn't showcase the creaminess of the cheese at its best.\n3. Entree - BF got the fried chicken (omg huge portion) and I got the steak. The fried chicken was super juicy and didn't leave you with too greasey of fingers considering what you were eating. The flavor of the rosemary showed and I would definitely order this again. So many pieces though, easily enough for 2 to share. The steak was also yummy, it was tender to cut and came with fries on the side which I love!\n4. Dessert - sticky toffee pudding and huckleberry cream puffs with extra brown butter cookies courtesy of our waitress. I liked the sticky toffee pudding but wished it was served hot so you would get that melty yumminess feeling when taking a bite, like the cake melting in your mouth and the extra toffee dripping off your chin - that's what I was expecting at least......\n\nOverall, decent meal.

It was so full, though we were really early, we didn't hang out in the bar area. We came back for our reservation time and as I've seen in other reviews, it was really full and we didn't get seated until about 15 mins after our 9PM reservation time. No worries though. \n\nWhen we began ordering stuff, we had the bone marrow with jam and oysters. Marrow was interesting. It's definitely more of a looks thing, but it was really really good. The jam makes it have a sweet taste that complements the bone marrow blandness. The oysters were really fresh and we could have eaten many more of them. For our entrees, we had the fried chicken which is probably the best deal in the house. It's crispy, it's fresh, it's hot and moist. I had the tri tip. It was cooked just right and came with a ton of fries. And truffle butter. Lots of it!\n\nFor our sides, we had the potato puree and the mac n cheese. Again, lots of truffle oil on the potato puree. All great choices. \n\nAs a tip, with the amount of fries you get with the tri tip, you don't need to get the potato puree. It's just too much starch, choose carefully. \n\nHere are my two small gripes. First, the fries that I got were too salty. I didn't eat a lot of them. The second gripe is not food related. When we walked in, there was a distinct dirty water smell. Yes, it was raining, but it was that dirty wet mop smell.

Some of my coworkers and I attempted to eat lunch there (and arrived on the dot 11:30 am) and were turned away. So you can't believe that they have tables for walk-ins.\n\nThankfully, after we made \"real\" reservations (on Open Table) we were granted access. The decor of \"tavern\" lives up to its name. It's very homey, not pretentious. Our waitstaff was outstanding -- very attentive, always coming back to the table to refill water glasses (sparkling and still). The server was very friendly.\n\nI had the Monterey Bay Calamari, which was quite tender and seasoned well. Quite different than the breaded stuff I'm used to seeing at other restaurants. That's a good choice.\n\nFor my entree, I had the Steak & Eggs, which seems to be a favorite on the menu. The filet was very good, not exceptional. My one other complaint: the entree did not arrive in front of me steaming hot. In fact, it was barely warm enough. I believe that food should be placed in front of me right out of the oven. Overall it was quite tasty, the crab was light and the sauce was a nice addition. If you have a big appetite, though, you might be disappointed in the portion size of this entree. The filet seemed rather small.\n\nDessert was Banana Pudding, which was extremely creamy. I shared it with a coworker and she thought it was a little too sweet. After a few bites, I had to say I agreed with her. The sweetness took away from the creamy consistency -- it should have been milder. With a little tweaking that could be one of my favorites.\n\nAnother one of my coworkers had the peach pie, which is by far the best item on the menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-24", "description": "You would think that the equation of comfort food + Chef Tyler Florence would equate to, what smaggits these days call linning.  I used that equation along with fellow Jedi Knight Allan Y.'s review in making my reservation.  Unfortunately, the force was not with Wayfare Tavern.  How tragic, as it was a goodbye meal of sorts between myself and the Admiral.  I made reservations a week in advance and had no trouble.  Due to its proximity to the Financial District, being super crowded during lunch hour is to be expected.  Walking in, we were immediately greeted and led upstairs to a booth.  First off, I have to say that the d\u00e9cor of Wayfare Taven was pretty badass.  They had these rustic pewter dishes in front of you that were for display only.  The d\u00e9cor reminded me of a really elegant yet homely age...the period escapes me...I wish I paid more attention during high school AP Art History.  \n\nI heard the whispers well before I came of the fried chicken.  I have also heard that the fried chicken had magical properties such as curing UTI, Herpes Simplex II...some of the most atrocious diseases that plagues mankind.  As a result, when the waitress was about to plunk down a menu, I immediately told her to desist from such unnecessary action and ordered an order of fried chicken with a side of Yukon gold whipped potatoes.  The Admiral followed suit and ordered the same thing.  Before our meal, we were given a warm popover, which I never had before.  It is a hollow airy roll with a flakey exterior.  It was good to eat with butter and most importantly, did not fill me up.  I am always guilty of overloading on bread and butter and am glad Wayfare Tavern had overeating bread mitigation programs in effect.  Our food arrived pretty quickly and man, did it look pretty.  The chicken didn't really look like it was pan fried, more like oven fried chicken and was very tastefully presented.  Upon first bite though, all my positive vibes about Wayfare Tavern vanished.  The chicken was moist but just lacked that \"wow\" flavor.  It certainly was not worth the price at all.  In addition, they provided no sides for the chicken.  It was just a heap of like 5 pieces and nothing else.  As a result, I got sick of it after the third piece but just sacked it up and ate with an unhappy heart.  Damn I hate doing that.  The chicken was really salty and to be quite honest, would rather eat Popeye's.  The Admiral liked it, however, I don't really count his rating based on two things:\n1. His restaurants of choice are Red Lobster, Outback...those type of chain restaurants.  When I went to Hawaii, I asked for remmencations.  My supervisor recommended island favorites such as Sidestreet, Alicia's Market.  He recommended the most expensive hotel Halekulani BUT said that the best thing he ate there was the Outback Steakhouse and heartily endorsed it.\n2. He can't taste anything.  He told me that for the past month, everything he eats tastes like metal.  He theorizes he has a sinus infection.

The main entr\u00e9e was very large in size, so one side between us more than sufficed.  In addition, the waiters were very attentive, constantly refilling our cups and asking us if we wanted more popovers.

We sat at table 27.\n\nMy friend is a huge fan of Tyler Florence. She was chatting with our server to start off. She mentioned how she was visiting for the weekend from Arizona, and booked the dinner 4 weeks in advance, and was hoping to catch a glimpse of the celebrity chef. \n\nWaiter: \"Great. He's in a meeting right now, but I will be sure to let him know there is a guest waiting to see him.\"\n\nMy friend was giddy through the entire dinner.  She's about to explode.  It's 6:20, we wonder if Florence was still around, so we ask our waiter again.\n\nWaiter: \"Yeah, still in his meeting, but I will be sure to let him know that you're waiting to meet him.\"\n\n6:25.

Really?\n\nHere's the situation: \n\nThe food at Wayfare Tavern is among the best I have had in ANY restaurant in this city or any other. I'm not kidding. The food is beyond excellent. Our table ordered oysters, bacon wrapped dates, chicken liver mousse, the burger (with egg, natch), the wild mushroom grits, the salmon vichyssoise, and the steak frites. We couldn't decide whose meal was best - it was all excellent. Also, the popovers they bring in lieu of bread are fantastic. I ate two. 5 stars for food here, no question. For the food, I can't wait to come back again. \n\nUnfortunately, the experience was nearly ruined by our server. Indeed, had the food not been as amazing as it was, the experience would surely have been ruined. \n\nOur server, Jennifer (according to my receipt) was awful. It was among the worst service I've had in any restaurant in a while, actually. She seemed unsure of herself and the menu. She didn't seem at all interested in our restaurant experience. (i.e. she gave the distinct impression that her mind was totally elsewhere. Maybe it was, I don't know.) Jennifer was totally inattentive, was slow to take our orders, was even slower to bring the wine we ordered (this took 20 (!) minutes to arrive despite considerable staring after the 15 minute mark). My friend who ordered the burger asked for a second napkin  right after we got our entrees because the burger was such a juicy mess and Jennifer finally got around to bringing it when she was nearly finished eating. Not helpful!\n\nI am sad to say we didn't sample any desserts because Jennifer was so slow in coming to take our dessert order that our fullness set in after the entrees and by the time she finally visited our table again, we just asked for the check. \n\nAdding to the service problems, our table was not ready when we arrived, so we ended up being seated fully 45 minutes after our reservation time. For this, the hostess was unapologetic. I feel that is a rather long time to wait for a table, even if you do have a cocktail. I will say that the bartenders were quite nice and responsive, and the house-specialty cocktails were great, as was the wine selection. \n\n1 star for service. Mostly because of the bartenders.

I mean, how can you go wrong with popovers?! They're delish!\n\nFor apps, we got the grilled calamari, foie gras, and bone marrow. The calamari was cooked just right, not over cooked, and garlicky in a good way. The foie gras is nicely contrasted by plums. The bone marrow I liked; it's very fatty-feeling, which I guess it's supposed to be (it was my first time having bone marrow). \n\nFor dinner, I had the steak & eggs and a side of macaroni & cheese. All was delicious! (Just don't let the eggs get cold, cuz that's just gross.) \n\nMy friend had the blue plate special - the Maryland softshell crab BLTT. Just in case there's any confusion, it's not a sandwich. It's like all the makings but better and plated beautifully. She said it was great and she'd get it again. \n\nMy other friend had the Chef's salad. She quite enjoyed the bacon and lobster in her salad (as well as everything else in it).\n\nFor desserts, I got a summer berry pound cake with cabernet sorbet; the pound cake and berries combo isn't anything new, but really well-made and good quality. It was the first time I had a cabernet sorbet and it was GOOD. Different and delicious. \n\nMy friend had the banana pudding. Also very good. The meringue was not the typical light/fluffy stuff; it's more dense & creamy. Way better, in my opinion (but I'm not a great fan of meringue). \n\nMy other friend had the peach pie with goat's milk ice cream. That was something! I'd pictured a slice of pie, or even a piece of something more peach cobbler-ish. No, no, no... it's a whole mini pie. (Except it's a pretty good size.) The ice cream is mild and nice. The rosemary sugar sprinkled on top is a nice complement.\n\n2 of us had a glass of dessert wine (Oro Puro, I believe). It was really sweet, with a kind of honey-like taste and a mouth-coating feel.\n\nThe food and service was very good and portion sizes were not lacking.\n\nAfter I asked if he was in, Tyler Florence came to our table and greeted us.

I had looked over the menu online and decided that it wasn't going to be that exceptional.  However, Friday night rolls along and it's almost 9pm and I'm trying to find somewhere decent to eat without a huge wait.  I called NOPA, Delfina, StarBelly, Beretta, Zuni Cafe, Range, and all were at least an hour and more wait.  Finally I tried through yelp's open table app to find reservations for Wayfare Tavern and got seats for 2 at 945pm.  We show up 20 or so minutes early and are seated early at the bar of the open kitchen. Woohoo because we got to watch the food being prepared and I got to eye stalk Tyler Florence who was working that night.\n\nWe shared the foie gras- plums plus foie=yum.  My bf got the steak and I got the fried chicken (waiter's rec) with a huge side of creamed corn.  Boy did I need my Lactose pills.  All I can say was that I shouldn't have listened to the waiter because I really didn't feel like eating fried food that night and I totally regret not getting the halibut.  But the waiter was so insistent that the fried chicken was out of this world, that when I got it, it was more like \"ugh...its good but thats it\" Sad. We didn't get dessert because we were too full (good old american portion sizes) and had a bottle of pinot in our bellies.  I wish we had tried some more appetizers, but alas, there is only so much two people can eat.\n\nSo yes the food was good, but what made it four stars for me, was the service (superbly amazing) and the ambiance.  The restaurant was homey and foodsy, like a hidden gem in a forest town.  It wasn't pretentious, but it did have an air of \"I am rich but unpretentious and I hunt deer\"  The highlight for me was definitely the open kitchen.  Sitting so close I got to watch almost every dish being prepared.  \n\nI would recommend this place, but maybe late night so it's not too crowded full of disgusting wannabees and yuppies (OMG let me just complain about the crowd. yueksjdsjhgd- ughhhh) You'll see for yourself.

There was some mayo below that and a butter lettuce leaf.  The whole thing tasted like the mayo, which was light but I did not order this for mayo.  Then, we ordered the fried chicken and a few sides.  The chicken was under cooked for the leg, but the breast was cooked.  The best part of fried chicken is the skin/batter.

The deviled eggs were exquisite, but the pickled anchovies out-shined the other dish.   The pickled anchovies come in a mason jar with fennel, onion, carrot, bay leaf, olive oil, I'm probably missing a few ingredients.  Eaten on top of toast points they were absolutely amazing.  I can't recommend the anchovies more highly.\n\nFor the main course my wife had the fried chicken which she says was very good.  I had the salmon, which I normally wouldn't consider ordering out, but it was great.  It came with small sliced crispy fried potatoes, roasted fennel, and some green that I can't identify.

However, the manager Jimmy, upon hearing about the steak, took great steps to mitigate this and more than made up for the less than perfect piece of meat.\n\nI also mentioned my previous visit (see below)  to Jimmy, and it's clear that it was an isolated and unusual experience. Again, Jimmy was very attentive and apologetic about that.  \n\nI'm a fan now!\n\n\nOriginal post from 9/26/12:\nWaited at the reception desk for 10 minutes, two hostesses walking up to desk and...they start gabbing with each other, and totally ignore me patiently waiting to put my name in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-02", "description": "This is a long review, so for quick one-liners -- scroll down to the bottom.  \n\nMade reservations on Sunday night for me and my friend on Tuesday at 7:15pm using Open Table.  I got VERY lucky.  Every other day for the next week or two was either at 5pm or 10pm.\n\nI spent most of Monday staring at the menu online and debating on what to get.  My coworkers were as excited, if not more, for me to try out this new hot spot.\n\nTuesday finally comes.  I stick to coffee for breakfast and munch on pita chips and hummus for lunch because I know I'm going to do some serious eating for dinner!\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant slightly early but were seated promptly.  The wait staff was super friendly and nice.  \n\nThe bread-man (I have no idea what else to call him) came by and served us popovers.  They look like yummy adorable-shaped croissants - but less butter, more egg.  We immediately devoured it and ordered our food.\n\nBaked Mac and Cheese:  Looked amazing as it came out.  Tasted good for a second, but I slowly came to realize I was eating a plate of melted cheese with little bits of mac here and there... It should have been called mac IN cheese (pardon my corny pun).  Anyway, it was way too cheesy for me -- and trust me I LOVE cheese.\n\nPoutine: I am one crazy fan of poutine (aka disco fries).  I once drove all the way to Montreal from Boston to get \"authentic\" poutine.  The poutine looked amazing (not the kind you get at 3am in some diner in Canada -- although that's a different kind of amazing).  Short ribs on top of the fries with melted mozeralla and truffle gravy.  Sadly, the ribs were pretty dry and the truffle gravy almost non-existent. \n\nSeveral times, the wait staff came by asking if we wanted to clear out our appetizers.  They were half-eaten, so we said, \"No thank you.  We'll work on them until our entree's come out.\"  About 30 minutes passed.  No entrees.  I finally ask (very nicely) the manager (aka man in the suit) if our entrees were coming out soon.  He was very polite and said the server was scared to bring our entree's out because there was no place on the table he could put them.  I look down on our table to see our two appetizers (mind you -- small plates) in the middle of the table and our empty plates in front of us.  I'm confused.... but the manager was very nice, apologized for the delay and said the server would be coming out shortly with our entrees.\n\nBurger:  I am not a burger person.  I like them, but I never CRAVE them.  If there ever were something to crave -- this would be it.  Medium-rare with the egg (MUST GET THE EGG).  As we cut into the burger, the red blood and egg yolk came gushing out and I knew this burger was going to be amazing.  AND IT WAS.  The meat was outstanding -- everything about this burger was just perfect.\n\nFried Chicken:  I was absolutely wowed by the first bite of this chicken.  The skin was crispy and the flavor of the herbs is prevalent.  But I think because I took a breast (and not a thigh or wing) there was just too much dry chicken meat.  Overall, it was good but a bit too salty for me.  Maybe I drank too much water afterward, but I very much felt my lips blow up from the salt when I got home.\n\nTakeaways:\n1) Service is good, but it's not outstanding (slightly slow).\n2) Food: the burger was the only thing that won me over.  I will be back for the burger -- and would like to try out other dishes.\n3) Portion Size: Good. We didn't finish everything and I still feel like I'm digesting...\n4) Atmosphere:  Great place for dates, business meetings or \"I want to splurge on $ and calories\"\n4) I think I may have over-hyped it in my mind... but all-in-all, it's a good restaurant and I wouldn't mind coming again.", "author": "S R."}

Immediately we started making backup plans while getting some wine at the bar.  Apparently I said \"y'all\" when inquiring about the beer menu when the young couple at the bar whispered to us: \"You sound like nice people.

Gary, the bartender is very professional and was busy making lots of holiday time cocktails. We ordered the caesar salad and the burger. The salad was had assertive flavors with filets of anchovies on top. Lots of lemon, garlic and anchovy flavors in the dressing. Very nice. The burger $20 was epic!! My wife and I have been on a tear lately, eating burgers at lots of different spots. Everything about it was great. The seeded bun, the roasted onion, the house made pickles were all great! the patty? Large and delicious with lots of seasoning. Juicy but not greasy. It came with smoked bacon and brie cheese. I was hesitant about the brie but it really went well. We split a side of mac n cheese. It came out warm but not hot. It was over the top rich and decadent. We both agreed it was too much for 2 people to share-better for 4 people. A fork full of the stuff will satisfy most people. The atmosphere here is great. It is noisy so I wouldn't recommend it for a business meeting. the only bummer is that the popovers that everyone raves about came out as we were eating and not before and they were a little overcooked-bummer.

The avocado and hearts of palm salad was all avocado and 2 slices of hearts of palm.  It was tasty but different than expected.  The service was underwhelming.  Our server had a chip on his shoulder and seemed to want to be anywhere but our table.  There was no offer to provide explanation of things or suggestions and he snagged the plates and menus abruptly off of the table.  I think I saw an eye roll at the order area on the computer, but not certain.  We had the fried chicken which I wanted to love.  It was way over seasoned on some pieces and not so much on others.  Not as crisp as I would've liked, but the chicken was tender and moist.  We also had the Mac and cheese, I've had better.

We were some of the first people there so not crowded at all which was nice.  I asked to add one person to our reservation as well and it was no problem which I appreciated.  I ordered the fried chicken, mac and cheese and iced tea.  My companions had the burger and ordered a side of squash.  \nThe fried chicken lived up to the hype, really juicy on the inside with a crisp flavorful exterior.  The crispy skin was infused with herbs which really knocked it out of the park for me.  You also get  a good sized portion of different cuts of chicken.  The mac and cheese was also quite good.  Tyler got it right by baking it in a cast iron pan with crunchy bread crumbs on top.  These two methods are key for me to enjoy mac and cheese.  The cheese used was a little soft and runny for my taste, I prefer cheddar and a firmer four cheese blend, but still extremely tasty and satisfying, real comfort food.  \nNot much to say about the burger and squash which I tasted but did not leave an impression.  Burger was definitely made with high quality ingredients (good grind, brioche bun, butter lettuce, etc) so it was good. \nOne surprising standout was the iced tea.  It came with a granita like ice ball which was slightly sweet and citrusy.  I loved it because it was not too sweet but definitely added a punch of flavor.  \nService was non-obtrusive though did expect maybe a little more personal attention considering how empty the place was.

The food itself was good. Beyond the popovers (I'm always a fan), we had steak tartare, veal sweetbreads, hamachi crudo, and tuna carpaccio.  The seafood items were good, but by no means special.  The sweetbreads had a great crust on them (if you like your sweetbreads like I do, that's key).  The standout though was the tartare. The marbled fat from the kobe beef made it so creamy and luscious.  In fact, this was the tartare that reminded me most of one of my all time favorites, made at Craftsteak NYC (RIP).

I asked her if she was sure, and she replied that she \"doesn't serve popcorn\".  She was completely rude and unhelpful.  I then asked her if she could ask the chef, she came back and said that the chef doesn't have any popcorn and that it is only for private parties.

The sort of thing you crave every now and again.   This time I left a little bit unhappy.  Not so much due to the food but rather the service.  \n\nLet me explain.  After ordering I waited nearly forty minutes for my wedge salad to appear.  When it finally was plunked in front of me, and after my server disappeared I noted that the promised tomato confit was not part of the plate.  When I caught my server and commented on this he apologized.  Case closed as far as I was concerned.  But at meals end he approached and told me the Tyler Florence was unsatisfied with the tomato confit this night and had left if off the salads.  Untrue.  As I was seated at the chefs counter I could see Tyler add the confit to the first few salads that left the kitchen.   Why lie when all I needed was my eyes to know that there had been a glitch?  \n\nEven without the the tomato confit, the wedge salad was nice.  Well portioned with plenty of blue cheese and large chunks of bacon.   \n\nThe fried chicken was also nice, although the frying oil that drained from it caused the paper under the chicken to fall apart.  I almost pulled some of the oil soaked paper up with the chicken as I ate.  But I didn't and I still liked the chicken. \n\nA side of baked mushrooms was wonderful.  Two or three different mushroom types, each tasty and each retaining its own earthy taste. \n\nThe moral of this tale is that even a good restaurant can be subverted by a poor and silly server.

The service was un-attentive. The menu was not very unique and quite frankly, boring. The food, while somewhat tasty, had some issues. I thought only 1 of 4 appetizers was outstanding, the Marin Tomatoes. So good. The deviled eggs, sardines and calamari were all just average. Three of four main dishes had serious issues. The NY strip was order medium and came beyond well done. The Lamb was ordered medium rare and came medium well...borderline well done. And finally, the pork chop was nearly all fat. The steak and pork chop had some great flavor, but I seriously expect perfection here with a brand name like Tyler Florence. Well, I did find perfection in the desserts. All were fantastic. I say skip the meal and come for the dessert.\n\nI almost gave this a 2-star just to be harsh, but that wouldn't be fair or accurate. SF is a tough food town, with great choices an stiff competition. Maybe that why the celeb chefs have stayed far away.", "author": "Scott M."}

Daaamn.  It is definitely a popular place but the atmosphere and vibe of the restaurant makes you forget there are other people eating around you.  And the servers make you feel so comfortable so quickly.  Now down to the important stuff...\n\nThe food to me was hit or miss.  A couple of the dishes were amazing and a couple were just alright.  The amazing: the cheese popovers (sweet, custard-y and flaky), Steak Tartare (a complete upgrade from the ground beef that's usually served at other places), House Smoked Alaskan Salmon, and the Fried Chicken.  In terms for deliciousness, the appetizers blew the entrees away.   The mediocre: Braised Beef Short Ribs, Dungeness Crab Louie Salad, and the Roasted Liberty Duck.  Don't get me wrong...these dishes weren't bad, they just didn't wow me the way the appetizers did.  \n\nOf course, dessert...we ordered the Spiced Pumpkin Pudding Cake.  It came with blue cheese and honey from Tyler Florence's backyard!  And it is similar to a chocolate lava cake but with pumpkin and it is definitely the best pumpkin dessert I have ever had.  (I'm a HUGE fan of pumpkin everything!) It was a great way to end the meal!\n\nAnd the service was top notch.  We always had our water glasses filled, the bread boy offered my friend two cheese popovers, and our waitress was very helpful in answering questions (blue cheese with pumpkin??).  What really topped it off was her bringing us hot water and lemon to help soothe our stomachs before we were able to dig into dessert.  \n\nThe bill definitely racked up but the food and service was worth the price.  Cannot wait to come back!", "author": "Helen V."}

The wait staff at this place are awesome and they are very attentive.\n\nAs far as the food, it was remarkable. My wife and I started with the dates wrapped in bacon. I loved it! My wife thought the dates were way too sweet. The sweetness of the dates and smoke flavor of the bacon. Yummm. Did I mention the popovers? Oh yeah, baby! Fresh+hot=good. My wife ordered the crab salad and she loved it. She said it's not the best, but it ranks as one of best she's ever tasted. We also ordered the mac and cheese, which was okay. I've tasted better. As for me, I ordered the organic fried chicken and it was very good. It actually taste like home cookin'. The chicken was tender and juicy. The seasoning was just perfect. However, it loses its crunch after twenty minutes sitting on the plate. Lastly, we ordered the pineapple upside downcake. One word: Awesome.\n\nThe restaurant has a quaint feeling, which makes it interesting. This place is wonderful and I believe my wife and I will be back. I highly recommend this place.

This was a birthday dinner --mine--and every part of the experience was memorable. it's nice to see a new SF spot succeed so well, as could be seen with the many smiling faces on a bustling Saturday night.\n\nYou have to hand it to a place that takes care of every element of the dining experience --the warm lighting, the decor, the center table where servers grab things, and the extraordinary freshly baked popovers that are brought to you the moment you sit down. Like the feathery light wonders at BLD in New York City, these are amazing and totally addictive. The menu thrills and so too does the wine list.\n\nWe ordered two excellent entrees --the halibut and the pork chops. The sides were spectacular, including a mac and cheese that easily defines what this even means. Cheesy and oozy but not overpowering and so packed with flavor. \n\nThe only slight minus I'd give here is banana pudding, served with nostalgia-inducing vanilla wafers (remember those?). The sweetness was just too cloying. It was really good, but it's hard to plow through after a couple of bites without going into a sugar overload. Much better though not perfect was the mini pineapple upside cake, a retro classic and certainly one of my favorites of all time. Here you get an individual cake, caramelized with lots of sauce, a moist cake, a pineapple slice, all served warm with a scoop of salted caramel ice cream. Yeah, all that. Nearly as sweet as the pudding so you can see that the dessert chefs have a bit of a heavy hand, but delicious all the same. \n\nThe wine list was impressive --a San Giovese and a Merlot made the evening all the more memorable.", "author": "Alfonso L."}

I loved that it was served with a raw egg but I wish it came with a different type of bread--or at least not with the garlic popover.  The tartare flavoring was excellent on its own and didn't need added flavor with the popover. \n\n-Salt Roasted Bone Marrow was delish!  I'm always hesitant to get bone marrow because I worry that I end up eating a dish that just tastes like lard.  Tyler Florence's take on it didn't turn out that way at all!  I think it might be the best bone marrow I've had! The rutabaga jam was a nice touch!\n\n-Organic Fried Chicken was a bit dry in my opinion but I did like that they cut up the pieces of chicken making it more shareable between my girlfriend and I. \n\n-Guinness Braised Lamb Shank was decent but I wasn't blown away. The horseradish whipped potatoes that came with it was heavenly! \n\n-Side order of Baked Mac and Cheese is always a must if I see it on a menu!  I liked that it was cheesy and not overwhelmed with butter and cream.\n\n-Sticky Toffee Pudding was extremely sweet(not complaining), the texture was like a carrot cake.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-31", "description": "More sizzle than steak and although I had great hopes, nothing was memorable that I would return multiple times.  \n\nFried Chicken-Heavy on the rosemary and requires the lemon to be squeezed to really balance the meal (and most don't use the lemon).  The chicken isn't that moist and the breading isn't necessarily as crispy as one would expect from something fried.  I don't know for sure, but I think the fried chicken is baked and possibly double breaded.  I think its way more hyped for how good it really is.  Although I will say that scanning every table, there had to be at least one, to two fried chickens on every table.  It is the dish of Wayfare Tavern.  I'd go to TownHall for their fried chicken, 9 times out of 10 before I'd go to Wayfare Tavern.  \n\nSteak Tartare-Not prepared tableside (which is should be) and nothing is mixed together nor is anything told to you about how to prepare the tartare.  For some, I think this would be a turnoff as the egg needs to be mixed with the tartare.  I did like it nonetheless.  Portions for the half size are plenty for two people.  \n\nBraised Short Ribs- Actually braised very well but the sauces are really thick and the amount of soy sauce present is really overbearing.  Goes really well with the black pepper creme fraiche and bosc pear.  The bosc pear is masked with the creme fraiche and almost has this texture of jicama.  By itself, I'd say it was ok.  But with the braised short rib sauce and the bosc pear, it almost seems like they were meant to be eaten together.  Overall, a heavy dish when you consider that the short ribs are served on the potato puree.  \n\nLocal Mushroom Soup- The best dish of the night.  The crispy brussel leaves will remind you of the crispy brussel sprout chips at Marlowe and the creme fraiche balances the savory finish of the mushrooms.  Not too hot and very hearty.  Must love mushrooms though (obvious) cause there was plenty of them there.  Well worth the price of admission. \n\nThe food came out really fast and the service was attentive. \n\nI don't know for sure what I expected.  I possibly had visions of a true Gastropub, but I left short of neither the pub nor the gastronomy.  Far short of what I'd consider the upper echelon of Gastropub fare, and that is Standard Tap in Northern Liberties, Philadelphia.", "author": "Mark K."}

Nothing like truffle gravy on fries smothered with cheese to make you happy.  The shaved truffles on top didn't hurt either.\n\nThe duck gumbo had a good amount of spice and was very filling.

Hubby and I arrived with stroller and toddler to a near empty restaurant at 11:15am, but it filled up by noontime.  They were very accomodating by giving us a table with plenty of space for our stroller.  I did feel a bit out of place, because the restaurant was mostly suits and business lunches, but luckily, our kids behaved today.\n\nI loved how every one is served a popover as soon as we're seated.  We started with a seasonal pear, blue cheese mousse, and walnut salad, which was delicious.  The blue cheese mousse was creamy, flavorful, and so much better with pear than just blue cheese crumbles.  We also ordered the steak tartare based on yelp reviews, esp one that said it was the best ever, but my expectations were set too high.  It was ok.  No bursts of flavors or melt in your mouth feelings.\n\nFor the entree, we ordered the famous fried chicken.  My son and I really liked it.  The batter was light, crispy, and flavorful.  The dark meat was moist and juicy.  The white meat was a bit dry, though.  Maybe it sat on my plate too long?  We also had the fall-off-the-bone ribs.  It had a traditional bbq sauce..on the tangy side.  But the tenderness of the meat alone makes it worth ordering.\n\nWe had two sides, shishito peppers and cream corn .  My 3 yr old said the corn was \"super yum\". And shishito peppers are a new fav for my husband and i.  We both agreed it was done well, esp with the fried garlic bits.\n\nOver all, it was a good lunch, but at these prices (entrees in the mid to high 20s and sides for 8), i wouldn't expect any thing less.

When we got there, there were PLENTY of spots open, as well as a couple who showed up behind us and got seated right away. -_-' I sorta wished we had just shown up a little later too, but we had to play it safe! Deceivingly spacious on the inside, the restaurant has a dark, old school feel to it. The booth that we got to sit in for the 2 of us was huge! We're considering bringing blankets and pillows for the next time so we can nap after eating.\n\nSince we were both still really full from a late lunch and coffee, we decided to grub on two things -- the Organic Fried Chicken, and the Wayfare Burger \"Le Grand\" (w/o the egg).\n\nThe burger features grass-fed beef, brie, a chunk of roasted onion, and smoked bacon between a soft, toasted brioche bun. On the side, what they don't tell you is that it also comes with butter lettuce, thinly sliced cucumer/pickles (I say this because it tasted like it was in an in-between phase), and french fries. Cooked to a perfect medium rare, the burger was definitely tasty. The bacon was thick, and had a nice smoky flavor to it, while the fresh vegetables were perfect for lifting your palate of all the heavy flavors. However, the thing that bugged me was that if you didn't have it all together, or missed a piece, then it just felt like something was missing. As far as the patty goes, it was juicy, but lacking a little bit of flavor. I commend the chefs for perfectly cooking the meat, but maybe I should have sprinkled a little salt and pepper on it! You DO get a fairly large burger if you go with this choice, so make sure you're eating this thing on an empty stomach, and to make sure that you get a piece of everything with each bite.\n\nThe fried chicken... was the sh!t. Straight-up. Although it comes a la carte, the flavor and the texture of this dish totally makes it worth getting your hands dirty and just ordering it by itself. The chicken is battered and fried with some woody herbs, which releases this aromatic scent and flavor into your face, mouth, fingers, and stomach with each bite. It's awesome that with each bite, you can literally see the herbs underneath the chicken skin (and not to mention the ones that come on top of the chicken). The roasted garlic is also a perfect addition to the meat. Since it's roasted, the cloves are soft, spreadable, and probably the only way to make the chicken taste better than it is by itself.\n\nIf you're ever here with a group or friends, or on a date (first or last, it doesn't even matter), you'll really enjoy the ambiance here. But most importantly, if you order the fried chicken, then you'll REALLY enjoy your time eating here.", "author": "Patrick K."}

Not a huge fan of dead animal heads on walls but hey, to each his own.\n\nDefinately request reservations at the Chef's Table if you're a big TyFlo fan.  It's comfortable for a party of three, maybe four, otherwise you're trying to scream down the length of the table to talk to other people.  It was fun being able to see the kitchen staff construct beautiful dishes - dining entertainment!\n\nLet me just start off by saying that you will end up eating A LOT here - so be prepared and come hungry!\n\nI love that you get popovers instead of the typical baguette or roll.  They are super flaky and oh so buttery.  \n\nThe group decided to split the deviled eggs for the appetizer and they were hands down the best deviled eggs I've had.  Super yummy and the anchovy on top gave it that nice saltiness!  It ended up being the perfect amount too - 6 for an order and 1 for each of us. =)\n\nI decided to have the Wayfare Burger and it was HUGE (and still delicious for leftovers the next day).  The burger was juicy and cooked to a perfect med rare.  I didn't mind the bacon on the burger but I also could have done without.  The fries that come with the burger are also super tasty.  I also tried some of Kat C's fried chicken which was SUPER flavorful and juicy.  We also split a side of mac n cheese and some beets magically appeared at our table compliments of the kitchen.  The mac n cheese was dangerously cheesy - so cheesy it was almost TOO rich for me to eat it.  The beets were fresh and sweet - a nice addition to help balance out the saltiness of all the other food we were eating.\n\nAfter eating all that I'm not sure how we decided on splitting three desserts.... but I'm glad we got to try a bit of everything!  My favorite was the peach pie - the rosemary....... man oh man what a winning combo.  I'd definately recommend getting it.  We also tried the pineapple upside down cake which was good but nothing outstanding.  The TCHO Chocolate Story was freakin ridiculous.  Definately for the chocolate lovers.

And I got to meet the chef himself (who was in his pearly whites) - Tyler Florence (see profile pic)!!\n\nI love the concept of everything on the menu is local, all from california.  What a good idea Tyler!\n\nWe ordered steak tartare, the tamale oysters, sea urchin, and the bone marrow to start.  The steak tartare wasn't bad but definitely have had better in France.  The oysters were cooked, had good flavor, didn't get too much of the pork belly but tasted the cumin which made it seem smoky.  The sea urchin was very clean and fresh tasting.  But we would have liked the briny-ness to come through more. It was kind of lost in the creamy corn below it.  The bone marrow was tasty especially with the parsley and pickled shallot salad on top of it.\n\nThe entrees were the halibut, the steak and eggs, and the fried chicken.  The steak and eggs with dungess crab and a bernaise sauce was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!  So good and well-seasoned.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  The fried chicken was the best I've ever had - super juicy, naturally sweet, and tender.  There are fried herbs and roasted garlic as accompaniments to the chicken which further enhances the experience.  The halibut was perfectly cooked and also very tasty.  \n\nThe desserts we had were the banana pudding, the fig/almond semifreddo, and the chocolate pudding.  The banana pudding was outstanding (see pic)!  The fig and almond semifreddo was good but it was full-freddo in the fact that it was completely frozen.  Unfortunate because what I could break off was extremely tasty but we couldn't finish it because it was all frozen.  The chocolate pudding was least exciting but I suppose that he has to put something chocolate on the menu.\n\nOverall the meal got better as the dinner progressed. ALL entrees were stellar!

You won't be disappointed with either choice. This is probably the only place I'd pay 20 bucks for a burger. It was worth every penny.

The first time I was here only for happy hour, but the place had left an impression on my and I wanted to come back later to try more than just cocktails and appetizers.\n\nThe 1st time I was here we had ordered foie gras, steak tartar, and grilled calamari. All were great including the calamari which I am usually not a big fan of.\n\nWhat drew me back was the great atmosphere and the foie gras (it was the best I had since dining at some great French restaurants in Quebec).\n\nThe 2nd time I went (10/31/2010) I ordered togo. My sister was craving foie gras, but she had to work late.  I tried to think of a restaurant where I could get foie gras togo, and just my luck, Yelp says that Wayfare accepts togo orders.\n\nWhen I called, the host 1st asked for how many people. I said 2- No problem. The 2nd question was if I was ordering an appetizer. I said yes- she said she had the ask the kitchen if the would accomodate.... Yay! They'll do it!\n\nI ordered seared foie gras, roasted duck, and Hawaiian tuna.\n\nThe foie gras was very good; not as good as what I had in Quebec, but good enough. The foie gras ontop of French toast might seem like an interesting combination, but it works well with the sweet and tangy huckleberry sauce. The duck crackling also added a nice crunch accompaniment every few bites.\n\nThe roast duck was excellent. Very nice texture, bacon added a nice bit of saltiness w/o being too salty, and the parsnip puree it was served on top of was amazing.\n\nThe Hawaiian tuna was a bit of a let down at the time only because it seemed much too small to be an entree and was not what I expecting (expected grilled not crudo [sashimi]).  I later discovered that they had given me another tuna dish that was an appetizer and had charged me accordingly.\n\nSo what was actually given to me was the yellow fin tuna crudo.  The crudo was good, but it just seemed like it was lacking something. The boniso dressing was tangy and very good, but there wasn't much of it. Perhaps more might have helped. The texture was very good; what you would expect any high quality raw fish to be. The description of the appetizer indicated mushroom crisps, but I do not recall mine having any mushrooms.\n\nOverall? I'd probably lean more towards 3 stars under other circumstances b/c 1 of my items was wrong and the pricing seems a tad high for what I could get at other similar restaurants. However, I have to lean more towards 4 stars b/c the host was quite accomodating (exception of wrong item) and the food is really good. I look forward to coming back and trying other items that have caught my eye.", "author": "Dennis Z."}

I love Tyler Florence and have always had success with his recipes, but Wayfare Tavern leaves a little to be desired and I cannot place my finger on it. \n\nSpeaking of fingers, they were nice and greasy after eating the infamous fried chicken. Damn good fried chicken for fine dining, I must say. Is it my grandma's fried chicken? Nope. Is it my famous fried chicken? Nope. But, I give it an 8 on a scale of 10. To accompany my chicken, I ordered the french fries. In & Out has better fries than Wayfare Tavern, unfortunately, for about 1/4 the price. These french fries were tasteless, limp, blah. Some of the best fries I have ever had were at The Beverly Hills Hotel and I have yet to find another restaurant that lives up to those crisp, perfect, delectable spuds.\n\nThe burrata was delicious, creamy and perfectly situated atop mustard greens with a nice burst of lemon. I didn't order this, the nice man sitting next to me offered a taste of his (along with his sticky toffee dessert later, which was soooooooo good). I ended up having a great conversation with him about traveling to Italy, wherein he hoped that I find \"body contact\" there. \n\nI walked in on a weeknight, around 6pm with a reservation and the place was packed. I was lucky enough to be seated at the chef's table and it worked great as I enjoy watching chef's in action. Plus, one of the cooks kept eye-fucking me and he was pleasing for the eyes.\n\nAll in all, really good. I recommend it, just do NOT order the fries.", "author": "Alah R."}

I have stalker I mean loved Tyler since the days of Food 911 ummmm kay...  So we got there a little early although we had late reservations 9:30 I believe. The hostess was very sweet and the vibe was relaxed. We waited maybe 15 mins for our table. She offerered us seating at the chef's table or a regular table. Sit at the chef's table...yes PLEASE. Now granted it is a little cozy and you will get to know your neighbors but that is what sitting at the \"chef's table\" is all about. \n\nNow the \"chef's table\" gives you a view into the kitchen and also some of the heat so be prepared...plus you get to see Tyler do his thang...it was pretty late so he was more in and out of there. I did not get to see him do much but hey it was still great to sit there.\n\nI must admit I got all school girl giddy when I made eye contact with him because a) the man can cook and b) he's FINE!! Ok so back to the food and service. We ordered the calamari, and steak tartare for starters I really wanted the marrow but the hubz was a little weirded out by that. The steak tartare was amazing I did not want to share the calamari was well calamari although it is grilled and not fried. The vibe at the counter was chill we were talking to the people next to us and the girls working the prep counter were so amazingly sweet!! They kept asking us \"how we liked the food\" and \"what our favorite thing was?\"\nWe also got to try the watermelon salad AHMAZING...I seriously want to go back and try every appetizer offered. The deviled eggs looked delish and so did the grilled peppers and foie gras. \n\nThe couple next to us recommended the Fried Chicken and Mac and Cheese...which we ordered along with the Burger. Needless to say the chicken earned its props it was so tasty without being greasy. It was crunchy without making your mouth bleed. Basically it was damn good....he should have called that restaurant TFC and only serve that chicken. \n\nThe portions are not skimpy and we had more than enough to take home and eat the next night for dinner. The Burger was tasty and juicy the one thing I would be sure to ask  for next time is that the bacon be a little more crispy. I am so planning to go back and try the Pineapple Upside Down Cake, they were all out that night...also props to our server he was a pretty cool guy with a chill vibe...the staff makes this place seriously fun, friendly and totally CHILL..all in all it was a great way to spend my birthday. \n\nAlthough I am really sad not to have met TyFlo in person I mean even though my sweet husband mentioned to the hostess that it was my birthday and if possible could he come by...needless to say he did not!! I'm not mad at him because he bounced for the night it seems...our reservations like I said was late, and we were the last two people in the restaurant seriously. But hey I understand Tyler leave us wanting more and then we come back I feel you... I have stalked him.... I mean loved him since I was in HS so fo show next time I go back I am hoping to land a much needed facebook photo!!\n\nThe Good: Ambiance, Service, Food, Sitting at the \"Chef's Table\", The staff, the wine list!! \nThe Bad: Not meeting Tyler :-(\n\nJust go already...", "author": "T H."}

I love that restaurants that do that, not too often where the main attraction is no longer available, but often enough to change it up and bring some delicious new creations to the table (literally). I had the organic chicken, and it was moist, soft, tasty, and not dry (which is really hard to find). They had a salad special that day which was a 5/6/or 7 (can't remember) tomato salad which brought a colorful array of different tomatoes together that blended sweet and tart with flavor and intrigue. I had their signature pear cocktail and another cocktail which involved pomegranate (no longer available). Both were delicious, but lacked the type of alcoholic kick that people who order cocktails were looking for.

The popovers are very tasty. I had the fried chicken since it was apparently their thing. I am apparently the only person that doesn't like it.  Two of my pieces were slightly raw insde, which was a slight turn off, but that aside, the skin was soggy greasy, not crunchy greasy like it should be.  I also didn't like that it was more herb flavored than spicy/traditional fried chicken flavor.  Most people had this.  Two people had the chicken, which I thought would be healthy but was also super greasy [and I love my grease] but it was kind of gross.\n\nThe second time I went was last week.  I planned our holiday party here in the billiard room upstairs.  Note that the pool table is the dining table so you can't eat and play at the same time.  They were busy and we had to wait 20 minutes because the party in the room was still in there.  That's hard to do with a party of 15 when there is room for about 5 in the waiting area.  \n\nWe had to do a fixed menu.  They failed to notify our waiter, who started passing out the regular menus.  The whole handling of it I thought was sub par compared to work holiday parties I had previously planned in NY.\n\nFood. Appetizers were served family style.  We had the ceaser salad [love it - very traditional with strong anchovy flavor], beet and ricotta salad [ok - a lot of beets and a little ricotta] and the tuna thing [thought it would be more like tartare, but it was like square inch chunks - tasted good but awkward sized].  For the main course our group was split between the fried chicken and short ribs with 2 people getting the salmon.  Every loves the chicken [I tried it again - still don't get it], the short ribs were really tasty [I would recommend them] and the salmon was average.\n\nDessert was the chocolate torrine thing [tasted like chocolate jello kind of - not a fan] and the carrot cake [amazing].\n\nSo all in all a mixed review.  Good service, cool but loud interior, good food depending on what you get. As for me, I won't go unless others invite me,and if I do, I'm getting ceaser salad, short ribs and carrot cake.", "author": "Kirsten M."}

Wayfare's take, fillet mignon topped with crisp, lightly breaded crab and a perfectly cooked egg to compliment the crispness of the crab. Asparagus and potato sides were also good, but beyond the main course, the best thing on the table was the side of baked mac and cheese.

I really loved the decor and the wood rustic ambiance.  Seating was nice in a large booth and the tables were very nicely prepped.  We started with the octopus and the fried oysters.  The octopus was phenomenal and had a very nice portion size. There was a bitter brown sauce which blended with the octopus so well, that it brought out a smokey flavor.  The fried oysters were cooked to perfection with a nice spicy heat.  Now I heard the burger at Wayfarer was supposed to be the best burger in town.  I may have hyped it up too much, but It was a  bit of a let down.  The burger had some massive size to it and it was cooked medium rare perfectly.  However there was a lack in flavor.  The meat was not seasoned and the bun was flavorless and crumbled in hand.  It seems the chef figured with bacon, grilled onion and an egg to combine the ingredients it would blend into a seasoned meal.  It just came off as a big bland burger with egg yolk.  It became more of a task to eat, then an enjoyable dish.  On the other hand, my sister had the flank steak which was seared perfectly in a tangy sweet and spicy sauce.  And I have never had better fried chicken.  The fried chicken had a rosemary herb spice that was aromatic and delicious.  And I have never had a better crispy, non- oily crust.  It was superb.  I will definitely comeback for some fried chicken and an old fashioned.", "author": "Christopher K."}

It's pretty amazing that almost all the food, sans the prep, is cooked in this little kitchen.\n\nI was hoping to spot TyFlo as my buddy is a line cook there and he said dude is there every day. Our super attentive friendly waiter also confirmed this and said he gets in at about 11 and leaves at 11. Sure enough he spent some time in the kitchen as well as floating around the dining area. I got my gitty school girl pic and chopped it up with him for a sec.\n\nBone marrow app was awesome with the crispy sweet crostini bread thingy. Watermelon salad was a little boring. \n\nFried chicken to me was as good as any I've ever had. I happen to think Costco rotisserie and kfc is some of the best chicken around and I would say this tops them. The batter wasn't too heavy, it was crazy juicy, and tender as could be. This is no doubt the product of a lengthy process which includes a 24hr buttermilk brine then a low heat sous-vide. Squirt some lemon and it's a done deal.\n\nBurger wasn't as wowwy as I had hoped. I read that's it's a grind of four cuts including short rib, filet mignon and prime rib.  It was pretty good but I've had burgers just as good that are half the price. The accompanying fries were quite tasty crunchy..good mustard aioli.\n\nPineapple upside down was pretty amazing. I really savored the parts of the cake that were close to being soggy that had sucked up the sweet juices.\n\nPrices are pretty reasonable and I would definitely be back.

It's never going to be one of the Bay Area's cutting-edge restaurants or win awards, but it's a decent, convenient Financial District place.  It's the sort of place you should take people on business, or out of town guests who want to visit San Francisco and feel urban and elegant, but who would probably rather not encounter any really unfamiliar and scary-type freaky San Francisco food.  (Which for me is the whole point, but I digress).  I had the fried chicken, which was quite good, even if it's not going to challenge the fried chicken at Pican or Casa Orinda (or even Popeye's Spicy) for Best of Bay Area.  It could have been cooked 5% longer, there was a little red near the bone and the meat wouldn't fall off.  My friend got the steak frites, cooked medium, and one piece of it came out way closer to the red end of the spectrum than to well done.  The cocktails were excellent, particularly the Sazerac.  The popovers were served hot from the oven and were just wonderful.  \n\nWe got Brussels Sprouts, also yummy, and really nice smoky mac 'n' cheese.  For dessert, we split a chocolate cream pie.  Like some of the other choices, it was very good but not outstanding.  It goes without saying that none of the food is for the overly health-conscious.\n\nOur waitress was Sarah, who could not possibly have been nicer.  Upbeat, enthusiastic, and attentive without being smothering.  The reviewers who have mentioned bad service obviously were not lucky enough to get Sarah.  \n\nI'm not sorry I went, but given the cost, I probably wouldn't seek out the restaurant again, unless I was in the area.  Or maybe next time I'm in the FiDi I'd just go to the Ferry Building and sample a zillion weirdo things for the $60 I ended up spending at Wayfare.  Like, strawberry balsamic ice cream, caviar, an affogato from Blue Bottle, some chocolate from Recchiuti, the most pungent cheese I could find at Cowgirl Creamery, absolutely anything from Delica, a big bowl of Pho from Out the Door, spreadable salumi from Boccalone...", "author": "Lira K."}

We were quite excited to try the restaurant but were a bit disgruntled to find out there is a month wait for a decent table on a Friday or Saturday night. If you want a table at 5pm or 10pm then it's wide open but for a decent 8pm table, the wait for the common folks is at least a month. After much anticipation, we finally had our dinner at Wayfare Tavern last Friday. \n\nThe restaurant is located in San Francisco's Financial District. It's a modern space with dark wood, an open kitchen and lots of white walls. I liked the minimalism of the restaurant in hopes that the food would do the actually talking. We were sat at a nice table in the back. Our waiter was quite aloof and had absolutely no enthusiasm for his job. For such a hot restaurant, I'd hope the server would have smiled at least once, but not this guy. We ordered the Tomales Bay Muscles and Steak Tartar to start. The mussels were OK at best. The best part of the muscles was the pork belly in the milky Herbsaint cream sauce. The Steak Tartar was much better and plentiful. The tartar was mixed with a delicious French mustard dressing and topped with an egg yolk. Only 4 garlic popovers came with the large tartar, causing us to leave a good portion of it behind. For the amount of steak, the bread does not match at all. \n\nFor our entrees, John chose the Steak Frites, a Santa Maria tri-tip with truffle butter, watercress and French fried potatoes, and I chose the Organic Fried Chicken and a side of Baked Macaroni and Cheese. The Steak Frites was good, but I'd say the fries were better. The Fried Chicken was perfection. I was so happy with the flaky skin and tender meat that I had a hard time sharing. I was 100% disappointed that for a $22 plate of fried chicken it didn't come with any sides. Sides cost an addition $8. The entrees aren't pricey at around $20 each, but to not include a side is ridiculous. An $8 Mac and Cheese or side of Brussels Sprouts is a bit much.\n\nThe food was good, but I wasn't overwhelmed. If the service was better, the experience would have been a four rather than a three star. When we paid the bill, we used a gift card and the server was clearly annoyed. We had two cards and said one had $200 and the other $50 but we weren't sure which was which. After a scoff he took our gift cards and left. The server should be trying to please the customer, not the other way around. Overall the meal was a decent price, a good bottle of wine, 2 entrees and 2 appetizers all for under $200.", "author": "Alice S."}

Our salad and appetizer was served an hour after we ordered it.   Our main dishes were served an hour and a half later too. The food was okay.   We ordered the poutine which  was pretty good.   We added oxtail which was flavorful and tender.   We also ordered the fried chicken and the hanger steak.   The hanger steak was extremely tough making it very difficult to eat.  Other reviews raved  about the fried chicken.   I personally didn't really experience anything special about it.  A little salty but good fried chicken.    For dessert we orders some chocolate mousse pie and that was pretty amazing.  Maybe because everything took so long to come out and we were pressed for time,  we did not have enough time to just enjoy the food.   Because they did notice their slow service,   they did comp us for dessert and coffee.  That was nice, thanks.   Would I come back???   Maybe but would definitely plan on setting aside at least 3+ hours...", "author": "Conrad S."}

The deviled eggs were good, but a little salty (I had to pick off the chunks of sea salt).  \nFor the mains, we got the fried chicken, salmon and halibut.  All were really good. Frankly speaking the fried chicken is good, but I think I can make it better. Sorry Tyler Florence!  Nothing beats the Buttermilk fried chicken recipe from the Tuskegee institute. I would have to say the salmon was my favorite of all three dishes. This was recommended by our server. \nFor dessert, we had the pineapple upside down cake. I was a bit disappointed. It was dry.  We probably finished half of it.  We got a molasses cookie at the end which was delicious. \n\nThe service was superb and the ambiance was very nice too.  I would definitely go back. I would like to sit at the counter to watch the commotion in the kitchen. I think that would be cool. \n\nI thought it odd that a family with 2 younger kids were sitting next to us.

I arrive first and am shuffled between upstairs & downstairs like cattle. The 3 of us (wine rep, winery rep, and my) then consume 3 glasses of Henriot (19 bucks *each* - WTH) while waiting. Upon finally getting seated downstairs, we order a dozen oysters. It takes about 15 minutes for our server to come back to get the rest of our order and the oysters show up soon after that. We ordered 6 Effinghams and 6 Beau Soleils; the Effinghams were my fave, a little smaller and brinier. Interestingly, the oysters were not served with mignonette of any kind, just cocktail sauce which I loathe because it masks the oyster's fresh taste. The popover guy also never came by with another one, which was a shame because mine was half dried-out. We then shared 2 apps, which were the best thing about the meal. \nSteak tartare: presented as a huge mound of raw meat, topped with a glistening egg yolk and surrounded by garlic-toasted popover shreds. We mixed everything together and went to town - the flavor on the tartare was exceptional! There was a spicy hint that we were trying to figure out... jalapeno? Tabasco? Anyway, it was absolutely delicious and worth 5 stars on its own.\nSpring pea soup: presented in a shallow bowl with the carafe of soup poured over it - my favorite thing in a restaurant! The soup was full of springy pea flavor and topped with whipped buttermilk and some smoked salmon roe. The whole sprigs of dill were a little overwhelming, I did have to ask for extra side bowls since we were all sharing, and I also wondered how the soup might taste served chilled. Otherwise great flavor and execution though. \nOn to the entrees... we ordered somewhat ambitiously, with 4 entrees for 3 people, but we just couldn't decide.\nBerkshire pork hash: a dish with really good flavor but not so much on the execution. The \"hash\" was described as containing potatoes, carrots, turnips, and pearl onions. I did not find a single potato, and for the love of God cut off the tops of the blessed carrots & turnips - this added nothing, presentation-wise, since the hash was mixed together. Peas were randomly included as well, and there were also some unfortunately fatty chunks of pork (though most of the meat was really flavorful and tender). I also didn't understand the egg on top. Was this supposed to be a breakfasty dish? Because if you made yourself something like this for breakfast, you'd be in a food coma for the rest of the day. This is a seriously heavy dish that belongs on the winter menu; I would gladly eat it then and sop up every bite but not on a 72-degree day.\nAlaskan halibut: not much to say about this one. The pan-roasted fish had a nice crusty sear on it, but the rest of the plate was not really memorable. I didn't get any bacon aioli or chive blossom as in the description, and the black-eyed peas were kinda meh. I've definitely had better fish plates, and for $30 at lunch? Come on.\nFried chicken: seriously overrated. Five pieces of chicken come served tower-style with some lemon wedges on the side. There are whole woody rosemary and sage sprigs in the batter itself, so the chicken is really hard to eat. What made it even harder to eat was that several pieces were still bloody pink inside, even pretty far from the bone. First of all, disgusting to look at. Second of all, can you say health hazard!\nRicotta ravioli: Holy hell, was this a mess. Three extremely al dente ravioli were absolutely smothered by a mess of vegetables: roasted zucchini and summer squash, cherry tomatoes, corn, and basil.  There was no rhyme or reason to anything on the plate - it was completely haphazard, none of the flavors really meshed well, and you couldn't even taste any of the famed Cowgirl ricotta. I picked out the sweet corn and that was about it - this was one of my least favorite restaurant dishes all year.\nSo after all that, we sat among our uncleared plates for a really long time. Our server had vanished and never really checked on us, so the wine rep finally said she'd have to leave to get to her next appt on time. So she left and the two of us sat and sat... waiting for the dessert menu or the check or *someone* to notice us. Finally, the busboy (!) gave us the dessert menu. I was so bummed everything took so long because I really wanted some peach pie. Well, guess what - I could have ordered it and finished it in the time we finally got the check. The bartender (!) had to flag down our original server so that we could get out of there at last. We literally waited 20 minutes to get the check. The reservation was for 12:15 - we left the place at 2:55. This is absolutely ridiculous for what was supposed to be a quick wine lunch of no more than an hour and a half. Who has this kind of time to waste?! I sure as hell do not, and I can't see myself returning.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

Opened only a few weeks ago, this restaurant was truly exceptional.  We started the evening off with fresh popovers.  I'm guessing that this is a nod to Tyler's southern roots.  Next, we shared a few appetizers:  deviled eggs and grilled calamari.  Both were excellent.  \n\nWhile waiting for dinner, we had the fortunate opportunity to be seated in a booth with a great view of the kitchen.  The darker, lodge-like motif of the dining and bar area were nicely muted to set off the bright subway-tiled kitchen.  You could see everything in action, including Tyler himself ensuring each plate was produced to his satisfaction.  \n\nWe wound up having three separate mains (two had the same dish).  The first dish was a fried chicken dish.  In addition to our approval of the dish, I've seen daily nods to Tyler via Twitter indicating the same.  Two had the salmon dish.  Both liked the dish.  Though I didn't try the salmon, I did have a taste of the Kennebec potatoes underneath.  If I come back, I'm getting the salmon dish just for the side, I think!  My dish was a pork chop with roasted peaches, Marconi almond butter, and fennel (both shaved atop and pureed underneath).  This was a marriage I'm going to have to recreate at home.  Pork and fruit, peaches and almonds, juicy meat and crunchy fennel....need I go on?  \n\nI would highly recommend this very new, destined to be successful restaurant.", "author": "Brian L."}

It's a very classy upscale restaurant located in the financial district. After enjoying a few drinks I decided to Yelp it to research the reviews. Being from SoCal I was surprised to find myself sitting in one of my favorite Foodnetwork chefs restaurants! We quickly made friends with one of their amazing servers, Jennifer, who squeezed us in on a Saturday evening! After wine tasting in Sonoma all day we were really looking forward to a nice relaxing dinner and that's exactly what they served up. Sat in the back by the fireplace and started off w/ their famous Petaluma Deviled Eggs (highly recommended). Then followed up with the beef shank bone marrow... a word to the wise, share it w/ 3-4 ppl. Jennifer suggested this but I went against her better judgment. Super rich and tasty like eating a stick of butter. My entree was the fried chicken w/ a side of mac 'n cheese! I knew I wouldn't be coming back for a while so I went all out. Fried chicken was spectacular! Perfectly seasoned w/ a touch of sage. Took some to-go and the next day it was even better for the drive home! Mac 'n cheese was rich and flavorful also another side that could've been shared. By the time the dessert menu came around we were spent and didn't have room. Next time for sure. My only complaint is that I didn't get my photo taken w/ Tyler but considering he's busy opening up another restaurant I'll let it slide this time. Btw look up his Yukon Gold mashed potatoes w/ whole grain mustard seeds. Served it up for last years Christmas and everyone love me for it. Can't wait to go back!

I made reservations about four weeks in advance for a celebration dinner.  I received a confirmation call about two days in advance of our dinner to confirm my reservation.  On the day of our reservation, one of my friends was unexpectably busy at work (on a Friday!) and so I had called at 1pm to ask if there was any way we could push our dinner reservation back one-half hour.  The hostess advised me that they were fully booked and that they would only hold the table for 15 minutes.  She recommended that we arrive for our reservation and that our friend could join us late.  Accordingly, we arrived for our reservation about ten minutes late and, after waiting about five minutes, we were seated.  We ordered drinks after being reviewing the wine list, and took some time to peruse the menu and enjoy the delicious popovers.  We ordered the American Kobe Beef Tartare from the menu and the Short Rib Poutine, which was that evening's special.  We all LOVED the American Kobe Beef Tartare.  The dish was incredibly seasoned and delicious.  Probably the best appetizer I've ever enjoyed, and most certainly the best tartare I've ever tried.  The Short Rib Poutine was disappointing.  The truffle gravy simply overwhelmed the dish.  Our waiter was patient with us and upon getting confirmation that our friend was in SF, we went ahead and ordered our entrees.  We ordered the Organic Fried Chicken, the Butcher's Filet, the Alaskan Halibut, and the Wayfare Burger \"Le Grand\".  Our friend arrived just in time to order a glass of wine before our entrees were then served.  The Alaskan Halibut had a tasty crust and paired well with the creamed kale and corn.  The Butcher's Filet was perfectly cooked to order.  The Organic Fried Chicken was juicy and crispy.  We ordered the Yukon Gold Whipped Potatoes on the side, but these were heavy and the texture was thick and unappealing.  The Wayfare Burger \"Le Grand\" was anything but.  It was layered with bacon, which made it difficult to eat.  My friend actually removed the bacon from the burger after a couple bites.  To finish, we ordered the Darlene Peach Pie.  It arrived quickly and was actually a mini pie.  However, the crust was thick and not very well seasoned.  There weren't very many peaches inside the pie relative to the amount of crust.  The Brown Butter Ice Cream didn't even taste like browned butter.  Truthfully, we regretted ordering it because the pie was not up to par with the appetizers and entrees and really fell flat.  We also regretted ordering it because it was clear that we had overstayed our allotted time for seating, with the waiter and hostesses lurking about our table.  \n\nMy major complaint about the restaurant is the noise level.  It made it really difficult to have a conversation.  Funny enough, a woman at the table next to us asked us to \"take our conversation down a notch\" because we were apparently interfering with her dinner date's Facebooking on his iPhone.   \n\nI would rate the American Kobe Beef Tartare, Organic Fried Chicken, the Butcher's Filet, and the Alaskan Halibut with five stars.  That being said, the other items weren't really at five stars and, coupled with the noise level and so-so service, I'd give the dining experience an overall rating of three stars.  I doubt I would return to Wayfare Tavern in the future given the breadth of amazing restaurants in the city.", "author": "Melanie E."}

The fried chicken was the best, and everything was served piping hot.  The mushroom soup was a bit salty but favorable.  The smoked salmon needs to be served with toast or something.  Dessert portions can be tiny.  A slice of the carrot cake is about four bites.  The sage ice cream really stood out, but the carrot cake and apple turnover were fairly basic.

The service was wonderful but the quality of the ingredients used in the preparation of dinner was frighteningly bad. The lobster was rubbery, the sardines were inconsistent (three to an order and found only one somewhat fresh tasting) and the lamb shank, which was a handsome looking dish, but the meat was dry and mealy in texture.

There was something very tasty about the butter too, as if the salt was just a smidge saltier than unusual. \nKobe tartare: Crazy good and I don't eat red meat unless I have not other choice. The raw egg cracked over plus the garlic popovers was over the top good. Order this no matter what.\nButter lettuce salad: great compliment to the heavier kobe tartare we ordered. \nOrganic fried chicken: terrificly yummy. Batter was light and the chicken most and perfectly seasoned. \nTai snapper: fish was perfectly cooked and the sauces were delicious\nYukon gold whipped potatoes: seriously whipped and creamy. Mad good.\nStrawberry rhubarb: not your usual strawberry rhubarb. Wonderful but more like a stiff flan.\nRed velvet cake: velvety and delicious. The coconut shavings on the cream cheese frosting was a nice touch. Ate all of it.\n\nI'd come back in a heartbeat but there are several things working against this fine dining establishment:\n\n1. Snotty hostesses, especially the blonde who was excessively rude to us. She told us there was absolutely no room in the entire restaurant even though there were two seats and the bar and a 6 top upstairs.  Even if those spaces were reserved, the snotty attitude was unnecessary. \n\n2. I arrived about 10 min late to meet up with my friends and was asked (not greeted at the front by a brunette hostess (this was before the blonde interaction). The brunette said I could go right upstairs and after I looked around, a server asked me if I was looking for someone. I told him I was and he pointed out a table to me with 3 Asian women and he said: are you with them? I glanced around the room and noticed that was the only table with all Asians and thought: what the hell?? My spidey senses were telling me that there was some serious racial dining profiling going on here.\n\n3. We ended up sitting outside and was told that a table should open up for us in about 30 min. 30 min came and went and no one ever came back to let us know about an inside table, as it was clear that we were freezing our asses off outside. \n\nWhat redeemed the experience was that the outside service was great and well-timed despite the freezing, windy temp. The food was terrific but this place is no joke - the wait is long and the hostess staff are intolerable, so go in with a focus on eating the food and tip your server for good service but ignore the rest.", "author": "Dawn L."}

I like regular fried chicken, take out the rosemary and thyme and it'd taste better. The steak had a lot of fat. I prefer to cut my own steak, not for you to slice it. The free popovers in substitution of bread made me feel like my cholesterol went up a few points because they're bland but fluffy because it's made of eggs. The deviled eggs were ok. My burger was overall a consensus of my table to be juicy and the best dish ordered. Although the fresh bacon came with it, pure fat, not crispy, and no meat was on the bacon! I wouldn't come back. Ambiance is nice, but too crowded. French fries were good.", "author": "Ting B."}

In the past we have been pleased with the experience.  This visit was far from pleasurable and sadly ruined our last night in the city with our boys. We did not have our appetizers after one hour of being seated.  At that point our server let us know that the oysters we ordered were unavailable.  I had to request the complementary chips twice before they were served. Our entrees arrived at least 90 minutes after being seated only to find that the parsnip pur\u00e9e had dairy even though I was very specific about my food allergies.  This is the first review I've made on yelp and I am doing so because I walked away from a very expensive night with my family and I didn't even get to eat dinner. By the time they brought the main course with dairy I couldn't wait for a redo considering the fact that my family had been waiting for at least 90 minutes for our dinner.  It was such a bummer because we had been looking forward to a restaurant we considered to be consistent and quality.  Our \"complimentary\" dessert was also ruined because the plastic container with the ice cream we took to go because our kids were over it was cracked and leaking all over the other items.  This review does not come close to expressing the frustration we experienced this evening.  The purpose for my review is to let both patrons and the owners know about the current quality of the service.", "author": "Kate A."}

But not to be petty, my overall take:\n\nLiked-\nAtmosphere - felt like I was on the Boardwalk Empire set\nFlavor - all the food we tried was pretty tasty, though some of that flavor, especially in the much lauded fried chicken, came at the expense of a lot of salt\nMac and Cheese - layers of flavor and not a hint of chalky texture\nWine bottle prices - wines by the glass pretty inflated but bottle prices decent \n\nNot so much -\nService -  super slow\nPopovers - cooked to order is cool but they just weren't as tasty as I would have hoped\nPortions - we aren't in Texas for gods sake, just give me the right amount to eat in one sitting", "author": "Leah S."}

Its location between downtown skyscrapers adds to the charm. \n\nThe first time I dined there, the service was friendly but perhaps not attentive enough.

Our server also promised to bring us warm, fresh popovers, which is what they do for bread, but the popovers never came. \n\nThe other times I've been there, the service was good but it does feel like they are aiming for quick turnover.\n\nThe menu is exciting American with lots of refreshing options. My lobster cobb salad was perfect for a warm summer night, although it was skimpy on the lobster, containing just one measly tiny lobster claw. The oysters were great. The fig-on-a-plate is a funny name and was relatively flavorful.\n\nI've been back, primarily for the atmosphere and to check out more of the menu, like the burger, the watermelon salad and the sides which all sound great.\n\nWorth considering.", "author": "Heirloom Z."}

Similarly, 5 star would indicate that I'd come back tomorrow or on the next meal but that's definitely not happening here. \n\nI didn't get that 4 star feeling as I left.  I did feel pretty satisfied in terms of food, ambiance, service, and just the overall experience for a family dinner, but returning would take some effort or interest not on my part\n\nThe food was good, but it didn't meet the expectations others had set in previous reviews.  And seeing that I had recommended this to my family for a birthday dinner, I was hoping to bring them to something spectacular.  However, as much as the service was great and we got to dine in a private room, the food wasn't all there.  And for a family of foodies.....that's an important factor.  \n\n-Steak Tartare - This is the first thing I remember because I actually like this dish.  However, I can't bring myself to praise a place solely on one appetizer\n-Deviled Eggs - Pretty good but nothing spectacular\n-Bone Marrow - I had Monk's Kettle's bone marrow earlier in the day and it seemed to be all the same with panko sprinkled onto the marrow spread onto a toast.\n-Beets - This didn't do anything for me.  Just any other pickled or boiled beets served cold\n-Mac n Cheese - Sadly a disappointment since it was ridiculously heavy and a spoonful just seemed overwhelming heavy with little compensation of cheesy flavorful goodness.\n-Kennebec Fries - Good but not outstanding\n-Brussel Sprouts - drenched in a sauce that was just too much.  The reason I like brussel sprouts is because it has that semi sweet bitterness, like hops.  Didn't get any of that due to the overpowering sauce\n-Popovers - truly a delicious and nice variation to your everyday bread out of the oven.  \n-Fried Chicken - disappointingly dry and lacked flavor.  As the raved dish that seems to drive some of the hype at Wayfare, it comes out somewhat juicy but missing that crisp and flavor.  The best still resides at Ad Hoc IMO\n-Pork Chop - The sauce that goes with this was excellent and perhaps the best of the entrees on the menu.  However, pork chop these days aren't hard to find, like that at NOPA and that at Park Chow.  \n\nIf anything, I'm contemplating on coming here for a glass of scotch at the bar and a nibble at the steak tartare.

Our party of three ended up ordering a la carte to accommodate the one person who did not want to do heavy four course menu.  Just after we were finishing our appetizers and salads,  we were informed by our server that an item that had been ordered as entre\u00e9 was not available:(  Kitchen should have informed server beforehand. My guest did her best to not show her disappointment, and ordered another of the same appetizer she had because no other entree appealed to her and did not want to hold up the works for the rest of us.  When the waiter asked her if she wanted more wine, we thought it was a courtesy for not having the entree she ordered but we were billed another $16.00 per half glass anyway.  The best part were the pop-overs (would have been nice to been offered 2nds!) and deviled eggs. My friends liked their fried oysters and my hamburger patty was DELICIOUS, but none of the things that were served with it appealed to me and were left uneaten. The collard/pea shoots were tasty but stringed ham hock overwhelmed this dish. The poutine with ox-tail, was fat laden and hardly touched.

I had heard good things, so I stopped by for dinner with a friend. I was told that reservations were necessary, but it seemed like there was a decent amount of open seating around the bar when I arrived. \n\nThe menu had a lot of enticing items, but I definitely wanted to try the salt roasted bone marrow -- I'm a sucker for some bone marrow. The bone marrow itself was an appetizer, but I chose it as my entree. To start the meal, my friend and I split the appetizer of burrata paired with figs and eggplant caponata. The burrata was incredibly fresh and fig and eggplant gave a nice salty, sweet balance to the dish. For the main course, the bone marrow was deceptively filling. It doesn't look like a big portion, but I was stuffed afterwards. I absolutely love the almost gelatinous texture of bone marrow and it was seasoned perfectly. The rutabaga jam was a nice touch that added an extra punch. My only gripe with Wayfare Tavern is that the grilled sourdough served with both the burrata and the bone marrow was way too hard. I felt like I was going to crack a tooth every time I bit into the bread. My friend had the Lobster Waldorf Salad and said it was pretty underwhelming -- there was a decent amount of lobster, but was under-seasoned and bland.\n\nI definitely recommend coming here for the cool, rustic vibe and the great local fare. The restaurant has upscale food and service, but it's still casual and unpretentious. Looking forward to another trip here with friends the next time I'm home.", "author": "Charlene W."}

I was lucky enough to get a reservation for KS, SA, VC and myself while SA was still in town.\n\nAMBIANCE: Hunting lodge/boys club decor. Very noisy. Despite being seated in an isolated corner near the kitchen I still had difficulty hearing the person across the table. Mixed crowd, but on the night we were there it tended toward older. The (drunk) cougar + (not) silver fox at the next table over were certainly putting on quite a show.\n\nSERVICE: Friendly but extremely slow. Staff members disappeared for long periods of time, which is great if you're having an intense conversation... not so much if you're hangry and need sustenance in the form of a popover.\n\nFOOD: 4 little piggies gorged themselves AND had dessert.\n- Popover: Not that great. The ones I got were deflated, barely warm and not at all crispy :(\n- Deviled Jidori eggs: The yolk-iest deviled eggs I've ever had. Its creamy and fluffy... but I don't get the hype. I actually thought this was a bit bland. The pickled carrot and fried shallot were nice touches.\n- Steak tartare: Very rich. I enjoyed this (mmm with popovers!) but it was too \"raw meat\" tasting for some.\n- Mac n cheese: WAY too creamy/cheesy for me. Even too much for Ms. Le-Fascina-El-Queso KS.\n- Fried chicken: Kinda disappointing. I blame it on the portion I got (white breast meat... ick). The breading wasn't very crispy, and even though the chicken is supposedly brined, it wasn't as juicy as other fried chicken I've had. \n- Veal chop: MMM so juicy, tender, and MEATY. I used my nimble little fingers and excellent fork/knife skills to strip the bone bare.\n- Peach pie w/ goat's milk ice cream: Delicious! I wish the pie crust was more tender... it was hard as a rock. The goat's milk ice cream tasted like Haagen Daz vanilla ice cream.\n\nOVERALL: Portions are HEFTY.

The menu and food are very satisfying. We ordered the deviled eggs, Caesar salad, and the chickpea tortelloni. Everything was very tasty and fresh. The deviled eggs were excellent, though a bit too heavy. You definitely have to share them because no one can eat that many eggs with all that cream filling himself. We also tried their popovers and like them, but prefer bread. For dessert we had the homemade donuts and strawberry shortcake. The donuts were great and tasted fine without the need for the sauces.

First, the restaurant is beautiful. Love the feel and and atmosphere. I really loved the wallpaper in the bathroom (yes I snapped a pic...no i'm not crazy). \n\nWe started with the popovers. Since we got there when whey opened they were fresh out of the oven. They are as good as everyone says. They are hot and flaky and melt in your mouth. Our server said he'd bring us more if we finish them before his rounds but we wanted to leave room for all our food (he did come by and offer though). \n\nFor our starters we shared the foie gras and the deviled eggs. The deviled eggs were just okay. I've had better (Beast and the Hare FTW!) but they were not bad. The foie gras though was outstanding. When they brought it out, it looked like strawberry shortcake and I was thinking, we didn't order dessert. But it was on a salt & pepper biscuit and topped with rhubarb marmalade. The foie was smooth and buttery and melted in your mouth. The biscuit was flaky and warm and delicious and the rhubarb was a surprising and enjoyable addition to the foie. It was incredibly delicious. \n\nFor dinner my sister-in-law and I had the famous fried chicken. My brother had the rib eye and we shared the Brussels sprouts and the mac & cheese. Every bite of all our dinners were amazing. The fried chicken was moist and crispy and you could see the herbs right in the skin. They give you a generous portion too. I was thinking it would be probably 2 pieces, a breast and maybe a leg or wing but they split the breast in half and gave you the wing, the leg and the thigh. My sister-in-law and I could have easily shared the meal. My brother had the rib eye and doesn't usually like fattier pieces of meat but he devoured the rib eye. The demi-glace on it was so good I sopped some up with my left over popover. The brussels sprouts were great and so different with the creaminess to them and the mac & cheese was rich and creamy but wasn't the best i've had in the city. \n\nWish we had time for dessert but we had a movie to make and were so incredibly full by that time that we were going to have to roll out of there. We definitely will be back to try dessert though. \n\nOur waitress was great and attentive. She was sweet and had good insight into the menu. They came by often to fill waters. \n\nI would have given them 5 stars but I had one issue that was with our drinks and the check. We ordered their root beer, which they have on tap. Our waitress came by after we had ordered to tell us that they were actually out. We ordered different drinks instead but were decidedly bummed about it. After we received our alternate drink orders another waiter came by (while our waitress was there) and delivered the root beers. He said that they weren't out and just had to replace something. All of this was fine but now we had 2 drinks and water each, which we did not finish all of them. However on our bill we were charged for both the drinks and the root beer. I think they should have not charged us for one or the other. they could have comped us  the root beer since they had told us they didn't have it or comped us the other drinks since we would not have ordered them if they hadn't told us they were out of root beer. Unfortunately they charged us for both drinks. I think it would have been great customer service for them to do that. I would have said something at the time of service but since we were in a hurry I didn't go over the bill as thoroughly as I would have if we didn't have to leave. it is not  a deal breaker though and I will definitely go back.", "author": "Tab C."}

My sis and I have been big fans of the handsome chef, Tyler Florence and his handsome show, so it's just given that we gotta check this place out and hoping that we could get a glimpse of him in action in the kitchen ( yeah, right! \"_\"). Yeah right is right..no Tyler on site last nite. Boohoo :(. \nBack to focus...the interior is dark, almost like a casual version of steak house with dark furniture, dark walls and some manly decor with the buck head hanging. They have 2 bars, downstairs and upstairs. The place was pretty busy last night. We met up with 2 of our friends there and although we had a reservation, we still had to wait a little longer. So we checked out the bar. The service is pretty fast, direct,not too friendly but that's alright. I ordered \"the doctor's order\" cocktail, which has ginger, gin, some other ingredients that's yummy and should be a doctor's order everyday ^_^. Ok..table is ready.\nBetween 4 of us, we had fried chicken for me, steak frites for my sis, chicken paillard and pork chops for our friends and bone marrow plus shisito peppers to share. Our waitress started our meal with some popovers that's pretty yummy but I think Neiman Marcus' is still the best supposedly. Our foods came soon. I must say everything tasted good but a little on the salty side for my taste. The fried chicken was simple, pretty good but not great :(. My sis' steak was better, the pork chop was a bit on dry side. The bone marrow was good but salty. \nOverall, I hate to say but this place is just ok :(. Sad I know,given how excited we were and perhaps our expectation of the food was way higher (like Gary Danko..which was exquisite). Would I go again?hhmm..yeah, but I won't be as excited as I was (unless Tyler shows up and gives me a hug..lol).", "author": "Levy O."}

I think the three stars comes due to my very high expectations going in, due to Tyler Florence being one of my fav celeb chefs. \nI came with my gf, we are from NYC and had been waiting to come for months. First we got the steak tartare. This was absolutely amazing and was by far the best thing we ordered. I got the halibut. It was good, but that's all I have to say about it. It was not a memorable dish. My gf got the fried chicken and we got the Mac and cheese and kind of shared everything. Fried chicken was very good, but after reading pols reviews on it, I guess I was expecting something more? I dunno, it just seemed like good fried chicken that can be had at many southern  restaurants for cheaper. Mac and cheese was the same, good but not the best I've ever had. \nI guess this review should be taken as 3.5 or even 3.75 stars. Steak tartare deserves a solid 5 and I recommend anybody going to order it and enjoy it with the fresh popovers (also great).", "author": "Daniel H."}

It is not a huge place but it is set up where you can choose about 4 different areas to sit in. They have bar seats of course, a chef's counter where you can watch them in action, the downstairs tables which are very lively and the upstairs which is more quiet. For me I like the chef's counter and the downstairs tables. Unless you are having a serious conversation, it is good to be in the middle of the action!\nThere are a dozen great things that have been listed by other Yelpers so I won't get long winded. But, you have to have the deviled eggs!\nThe two reasons I won't give it 5 stars are the lack of beers and the prices. When it opened about two years ago the deviled eggs were $9 (now $11), the famous fried chicken was $19 (now $21) and corkage was $20 (now $25). I know it's not the end of the world but it adds up and changes it from a great place with value, to just a great place. The value used to be the main reason I would tell friends and out of town guests to go there. I still will go and recommend it but maybe not as often. \nOh yeah forgot the beer part! Beer drinkers don't really like to try new things. For most of us, just going to a fancy place like Wayfare is out of the comfort zone as it is. It is normal to look at a long menu for wine and not know half of what is there but for beers that is weird. So I would suggest to stock the top 6 that everyone likes and have a few brown/ organic/ dogfish or whatever those smelly beers are to make you feel good about supporting people in Mendocino.", "author": "Jim M."}

The food was absolutely nothing special and the service needs improving. Why?\n\n1) The French Fries were served cold and the waiter tried to explain why the fries were cold on top and warm on the bottom. No Sir! Fries served from the fryer are always HOT, top and bottom. No excuses and don't try to make up one.  We had to ask for a new batch of fries and he reluctantly  bought it to us. \n\n2) Their famous fried chicken was bland and the skin was soggy. The chicken was very moist, I give them credit for that but what's fried chicken without a crispy outside and marinated meat? The batter came off the chicken and onto the knife and fork. Also, why were the chicken pieces so small?\n\n3) The lobster salad was served with too much dressing which resulted in limp greens by the time we ate it with our chicken and fries.\n\n4) The devil eggs had way too much salt which we all unanimously agreed. The chef should have put some of that extra salt into the chicken.  \n\n5) We had to ask the waiter 2 times for beverages, at least 3 times for an extra popper. The waiter was either overworked and couldn't come by the table or he went home. We never saw him after he served us the chicken. There was another waiter who tried to accommodate us because he noticed we were not being served. \n\n6) We had to ask at least 2 times for a dessert menu, never got one. And by now we had lost our appetites for dessert. We had to flag down the bus boy to get our check. I felt if we had walked out the door, no one would have even noticed. The service was truly lacking at what is touted to be excellent customer focused. \n\nAny positives with this restaurant? A few. \n\n1) The Poppers were delicious with the creamy butter.\n2) The fireplace kept us warm from the night air.\n3) We got a parking space right in front of the restaurant.\n\nTo pay what we did for poppers, a seat by the fireplace, and free parking; No thanks, we're not coming back.", "author": "Dinah Y."}

Went on a Sunday night at about 7 PM with no reservation. The wait for a table for 2 -- 2 hours. That's the first sign they're doing something right.\n\nWe had a drink at the bar & within 20 minutes, 2 wonderful spots at the bar opened up & we were able to sit. I almost prefer to sit at the bar at a place like this - The brick walls, dark wood, dim lighting and soulful music really set the mood & sitting at the bar while you drink your Pinot Noir or Bourbon just feels right. \n\nThe service at the bar wasn't the best. I was a little unimpressed that when I asked the bartender a question about one of the dishes, he had to look it up. I mean, come on, at at Tyler Florence restaurant I am shocked they aren't being tested daily on menu knowledge. But I'm just being difficult.\n\nThe food was, duh, phenomenal. \n\nRarely do I comment on a restaurant's bread - but the popover's served at Wayfare Tavern are like a dream come true for bread lovers like myself... & Aladdin. Straight up amazing.\n\nFirst was the Sea Urchin - served with fried clam bellies & a cauliflower ricotta pudding, which made the dish. It was little too \"fishy\" at first but the pudding really broke up that taste & made it quite enjoyable.\n\nThen was a Caesar Salad which was perfect. The dressing is hands down the best Caesar dressing I have ever tasted. Really creamy but the exact amount of lemon/acidity to make it light. Perfect flavor & texture. Capers & anchovies were super yummy. I hate ordering Caesar Salad at a restaurant, especially with such an impressive menu like the one at Wayfare Tavern, but I was not disappointed with my choice & would even say this is a must order.\n\nThe Steak Tartare, which we ordered a half portion of was even too much for 2 people. I think the portion definitely could be cut in half and no one would bat an eyelash. Really delicious though. The Tabasco flavor is very strong but makes the dish. \n\nAll in all, I'm a fan.

I made the reservation a few weeks in advance which I go an 8:00pm seating which was perfect.   The place has a great d\u00e9cor with all the dark wood almost a feeling of being cozy until you hear how LOUD it is.  We sat upstairs which was dark and again very loud had I known I would have like to be seated downstairs.  \n\nI was looking forward to the Sunday's special which is Chicken Pot Pie but was disappointed to find out that they did not have it.  So I opted for the fried chicken it was good, very tender but slightly greasy, slightly cold and slightly overpriced.  My husband got the Wood grilled Chicken Paillard which had a great smoky taste and the chicken was very tender.  We shared the Mac and Cheese which was oozy with delicious cheese,  Mmmm, mmmm.  We also tried the deviled eggs for an appetizer which had great twist to them with the crispy anchovies.  The staff was ok.  \n\nIt was not my favorite place I dined in San Fran but it was very good.

I had the Shandy to start with and that was a refreshing kick in the pants, I nursed that drink through the meal and I'm not by any means a light weight. The puff bread thing was slap yo' momma good. I didn't find out till later that you could have more than one, which is probably better for my waistline in hindsight. Now onto the main course. Let me preface this by saying I'm southern. With Grandma from Arkansas who has been using the same cast iron skillet (that has not been washed with soap in my lifetime- if that grosses you out then you don't understand cooking with a cast iron skillet). I say all of that to convey that while I can see why the average SF'er would die over the fried chicken it was just 'good' in a kind of bless your heart sort of way.

Ordered hardboiled eggs appetizer and fried oyster - yawn on the eggs and got a piece of cauliflower fried as my oyster. This was at waiters recommendation - WRONG!!!! The server kept saying how great the fried chicken and burger were so my husband ordered the chicken and I ordered the burger cooked medium. The chicken was boring and the sauce that came with it tasted like mayonnaise. My burger undercooked to rare and I just said forget it I want to get this over with...greasy undercooked and really I have had better at Beer, Burger and Jazz at the Ritz Half Moon Bay on a busy Thursday night. Oh the fries - forget it - crisp but boring. Didn't want to bother with dessert. The chicken portion was large so my husband brought a piece home. It is still in the refrigerator and if it was good it would be gone in our house. I would never go there again and highly do not recommend. Our friends said that they ate at the bar before and said it was great - Me thinks they were having the drunkies. I can recommend good burgers at the Ritz HMB, Godfathers in Belmont and Burger Joynt is better. OH also the prices are alittle overboard $19 for a burger. AS a server myself I would never recommend the chicken or burger at all. Everything is ala carte and over priced - oh the atmosphere is kind of back east pub like --- okay.

This time around we weren't to impressed with the deviled eggs. From our previous visits the deviled eggs had bacon bits which gave it a bit more depth to the deviled egg. Park Tavern wins on the deviled egg category for you egg fans. For the main dishes we ordered the Fried Chicken, Pork Shank, and Skirt Steak. And, we all agreed that we would order those dishes again. They were all good and seasoned very well. I recommend the broccolini as a side dish. For dessert, definitely go with the doughnuts with three different dipping sauces. The setting in place is a bit loud downstairs and the bar is happening. Upstairs is a bit more less noisy, but the tables are very close together. They need to spread out the crowd upstairs or rearrange the table sitting in some other way. The service is very attentive.

But I'm not sure how long we would have stood there had a manager not come by who knows my boyfriend, and whisked us to the kitchen-side seats.

It wasn't about letting flavors sing, or whatever, it was straight up about the duck fat. I couldn't eat it and we swapped plates, which is how I know how delicious the chicken was.\n\nEven my bf, who loves duck fat, thought the ribeye was too fatty.\n\nHOWEVER, then we ordered dessert.

My husband and I were incredibly hungry after a cross country flight and this was positioned close to our hotel in the financial district.\n\nIt was a bit more upscale then we were expecting but we were not treated any differently. We were there on a Thursday and were seated upstairs right away amid a sea of attorneys and investment bankers.\n\nThey have a sophisticated menu but my husband and I did manage to find a lobster roll and a hamburger. My lobster roll was good but there was too much butter on the roll. The staff were attentive but quiet.\n\nWhen our waitress came with the dessert menu, we declined but happened to mention we were on our delayed honeymoon, she returned with our check and two brown butter cookies with \"Happy Honeymoon\" written in beautiful script.

The steak was overcooked and appetizers wasn't gluten wheat free even after the server was advised that I had a wheat gluten allergy.  They ran out of Drake's Ale beer and the wine wasn't chilled.  It took 15 minutes to get toast for the Burrata appetizer.  Never heard from Tony after I emailed him feedback and complaint.  Obviously, they really don't care about your feedback or they would at least acknowledge receiving it.  I've been to this restaurant many times in the past but don't see myself going back.  Not very efficient, not very friendly especially after spending $450.00 that evening...should have gotten at least a reply back from them.", "author": "Lexie D."}

We started with the deviled eggs for the appetizer.  It was topped with capers and full of flavor.  Before the entrees came, we were served fresh from the oven popovers.  Crunchy and fluffy, it had a nice buttery aroma.  I had the Smoked Pork Chop topped with a grilled peach that was tender and flavored well all the way through.  My wife had the Fried Chicken that was well seasoned and tender.  I had a Bear Republic Racer 5 beer that hit the spot.  For dessert, we had the upside down pineapple cake with salty ice cream and nut brittle.  It was moist and fresh tasting.  \n\nOur experience was the top notch.  The food was high quality and the flavors unique.  The ingredients were from our local's finest.  Not only was the food delicious but the portions were very generous.  After watching Tyler cook on TV all these years, we can confirm his dishes tastes as good as it looks on TV. The staff from top to bottom was attentive, professional and friendly.  It was fun to watch them in action and all the energy going on.

We waited a bit for our table but was able to score some local brewed beer at the bar, which is always a plus for me.  When we were finally seated upstairs in the main dining room, we were greeted by Elaine who I can describe as simply amazing.  Elaine was attentive, funny, super helpful and wonderful...we really just wanted her to join us for dinner...she was that cool!  Elaine recommended us to try a bunch of things and go family style.  We ended up ordering for appetizers the beef tartare and flash fried oysters, for our main course we got the fried chicken, steak and a side order of mac-n-cheese and twice baked potatoes and ended our meal with a chocolate pie and doughnuts.  The food was AMAZING...seriously it was like Thanksgiving Part 2.  Everything was delicious and my favorites were the fried chicken (really juicy and crispy), doughnuts (with dipping sauces...the pomegranate jelly was the sure winner here)  and the mac-n-cheese (so rich and creamy).

The restaurant would be more fitting in a cold, snowy town with flakes falling gently outside with its coziness, but nonetheless I am glad it's here.\n\nThe only thing I would point out is that they have a beautiful fireplace downstairs which is the highlight of the room, and with the blazing fire it was really nice to see. However, after about five minutes they put a group at a table right in front of it so none of the rest of the restaurant could see it anymore - seemed to defeat the entire purpose of having it. That was the only disappointment.", "author": "Robert B."}

No problem, I think. Glass is now empty. Flag someone down for a refill. They tell me they are OUT OF ice tea. Weird, but okay. Order a cheese plate for dessert.

We arrived early and was excited to see that Chef Tyler Florence was working that night (my sister had brought along her cookbook for him to sign, a Christmas present from me).  We were seated in the cozy upstairs dining area. \n \nOur waiter asked if it was our first time (which it was), gave us our menus, and informed us that the menu had just changed and the kitchen might be a little slow due to getting up to speed with the new menu.  We were pleased to hear that the buttermilk fried chicken remained on the menu, something we had both wanted to try. We ordered the poutine, a fries appetizer with mozzarella curds and braised short ribs, two entrees, the organic buttermilk fried chicken and the pork shank, and a side of roasted brussel sprouts to share. As we were waiting, we were served the most amazing light and delicious popovers.  Impossible to refuse, we were assured that they were \"air-filled and calorie-free\" - =P  The appetizer came shortly afterwards and we found poutine delicious, both savory and hearty.  We found the wait staff very friendly and attentive.  \n \nDinner was a little slow arriving, but when we asked about our entrees, food was brought to us immediately. The waiter was very accomodating and helped to make room on our table when we asked for two plates to share family-style.  The organic buttermilk fried chicken was crisp and moist, served with fragrant crisped herbs and fresh lemon.  The pork shank (falling off the bone tender) was served over mashed potatoes, alongside apples and roasted brussel sprouts. Food was fantastic and service impeccable.  I was really surprised when management stopped by our table personally to apologize for the kitchen wait and to ask us what we thought of the food. \n \nWe wanted to order dessert   but my sister had concerns about time because she had to be up for work early the following day.  We asked our waiter if dessert would take long and he assured us that he would get the order in and turned around quickly.  We ordered the apple pie with sage ice cream to share--and dessert came in record time.  The apple pie was warm and the sage ice cream deliciously unique.  The sage ice cream had a very nice and subtle herb flavor and balanced wonderfully with the  apple pie. It was a fabulous meal--we even had leftovers to take home with us. Even more surprising was that our apptizer was comped due to the delay! \n \nBefore leaving, we stopped by the kitchen to see if we could meet Chef Tyler Florence and have him sign my sister's cookbook.  We were told that folks occassionally did this and that we should just go up to him and ask.  Though he was busy in the kitchen, he took the time to stop and greet us.  Friendly and very personable, he seemed sincerely delighted to meet with his patrons.  Not only did he sign the cookbook but we also were able to get a photo with him as well.  For a downtown restaurant, Wayfare Tavern has a warm friendly neighborhood ambiance. The food and service made for a very exceptional evening.", "author": "Terry W."}

The space is beautiful, if oddly decorated with taxidermy on the walls. Really? I'd rather not look at a stuffed goose during my dinner, thank you. And the menu reminded me of eating at Boudin's -- but I think it was just the font they used. At first glance, the food looks like pretty typical American fare, and that is in fact what I ended up ordering: prosciutto with melons, steak frites, and roasted asparagus. Perhaps not the most exciting selection, but the food that came was pretty close to sublime. The prosciutto was divine: lightly drizzled in an almost sweet olive oil, with small morsels of melon throughout. The steak was cooked exactly to my request, with a delicious but not-too-heavy sauce. The frites were crispy and just salty enough without overpowering the steak. And there was this sweet, roasted onion on the side that perfectly offset the other flavors and textures on the plate. All in all, a perfect combination. Oh, and the Riesling they had by the glass: amazing! Tyler Florence: I was never that big a fan of yours on the Food Network, but you sure do know how to impress with perfectly executed simplicity.", "author": "Ethan T."}

The restaurant had reserved in my opinion the most romantic table in the restaurant which was a two seat table in the back against the focal wall which was close to the kitchen (great views of the chefs working) and also provides a view of the entire restaurant.  The feel of the space was cozy and romantic, a little loud but not a bother.\n\nOur server was very nice and attentive.  For drinks, I had Doctor's Orders (I couldn't really taste the gin but it was fizzy and not cloyingly sweet) and Occidental Punch (I liked this one better, pineapple and lime combined made for a refreshing drink for our heavier dishes.)  We started with a dozen oysters, they were fresh and tasty.  For entrees, we had the famous fried chicken and classic steak frites. The fried chicken has a delicious crunchy coating with hints of rosemary which was a nice touch. I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't taste overly greasy, however the breast meat was a touch dry compared to the rest of the juicy chicken.  The steak was perfectly cooked to medium rare and the fries were also hot and crispy, very nice.  We didn't order dessert but was presented with one anyway for my birthday. I'm not sure if it was complimentary or if my fiance had pre-ordered it but it came with a small candle and the server kindly offered to take photos for us.\n\nThe restaurant also has an upstairs dining area but the place got crowded quickly so we didn't have a chance to take a look.  The bar area had a speakeasy vibe with vintage decor. Overall, the atmosphere of Wayfare Tavern felt cozy and unpretentious for an upscale place by a celebrity chef. There is no hype here, the food is good.\n\nMy fiance said he had asked when he made reservations if chef Tyler Florence would be there but sadly not on the night we visited, perhaps next time because we will definitely be back.", "author": "Lisa H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-23", "description": "Based on the flaws that I have encountered during both of my dining experiences at Wayfare Tavern, one would assume I'd give it two - maybe three - stars. However, with each strike that the restaurant received, they were able to redeem themselves and still managed to impress me.\n\nThe first experience included an unbearably over-salted soup (minus one) that caused some yelling in the kitchen upon my return of the dish (so I was told - the chef tried it and was shocked at the sodium level). Still, the soup and the restaurant were redeemed when they brought me a fixed version and then took the soup (which was my main course) off of the bill (plus two). \n\nThe second experience started out with an hour wait after my reservation. Certainly I understand that restaurants do not have full control over when diners leave, but an hour seemed a bit much considering we were finally seated close to 10 PM (minus one). However, they brought my party of 3 complimentary drinks of our choosing as we waited (plus one) and then also started us off with our appetizer of choice, once again, on the house (plus one). And then they did not charge us for our corkage fee for the wine that we brought (plus one).\n\nSo for every fail, Wayfare Tavern redeemed itself and surpassed expectations in the restaurant's response. \n\nOn a good night, where everything goes smoothly, the restaurant is almost certain to surpass expectations in terms of food. With a preference toward healthier cuisine, a restaurant known for dishes such as fried chicken, burgers, and mac and cheese doesn't necessarily excite me. However, I'll be the first to admit that the fried chicken at Wayfare Tavern is the best that I have ever had. I'm not a connoisseur and hardly ever even eat fried chicken, but I gave it a shot (split it with the boyfriend - the portions are large!) and was thoroughly impressed. The herbs and perfect amount of crispy breading made me think twice about my traditional distaste for fried chicken. As a table, we also split the Mac and Cheese and Roasted Broccoli. The Mac and Cheese was thick and elevated to a level way beyond the childhood favorite with complex flavors and an aura of divinity that made you forget for a second how unhealthy it was.\n\nAnd the popovers - I cannot fail to mention one of my very favorite aspects of the restaurant. The crispy, airy, puffed bread of perfection are the ideal way to start a meal that is sure to revive memories of childhood with food that has been transformed and elevated to suite your refined palate of today.", "author": "Katie S."}

Boy, this place did not disappoint.\n\nQuick observations - the place has a cozy, lodge/bar feel. Very comfy and not stuffy at all. The wait staff are all so friendly and quick to serve drinks and answer your questions. No sign of Tyler Florence, so that was a minor bummer.\n\nWe started off with the amazing popovers. So buttery, but light. The deviled eggs were creamy and flavorful. The steak tartare was perfectly seasoned and paired perfectly with the pesto popovers.\n\nBased on all the rave reviews here, I went with the fried chicken. OMG. The batter was light, the meat was tender and (based on the the server's recommendation) the fresh lemon squeezed on the dish made it absolutely perfect. I rarely eat fried chicken... but this did not leave you with that \"yuck-i-feel-sick\" feeling afterwards. This was fried chicken that didn't feel greasy at ALL. HIGHLY recommend this dish/\n\nMy brother ordered the cheeseburger. That was also amazing - the burger was topped with brie, the traditional fixings - and a fried egg. Tryly decadent but SOOOOO delicious.\n\nMy sister-in-law got the ravioli. Pass on this. Nothing special about it.\n\nFor dessert, we went with the strawberry shortcake topped with fresh berries and creamsicle ice cream. The cake was a bit dry, but the berries and ice cream were fab.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad we went there. The fried chicken alone made it worth the trip. But the prices are tad too high for what you get. Chicken for more than $20? A burger that was almost $30? Bring the prices down about $5 and it would be perfect.\n\nStill, good food, great service and PERFECT fried chicken and burgers.", "author": "Cami F."}

Also, I'll admit that I was sad too that Tyler wasn't there the night we were. \nI'll go in bullet-points since we ordered a lot of food. We ordered from the fall menu, which is no longer available; it is nice that they change the menu based on seasonal offerings. 5 of us went for our annual Christmas/New Year dinner, and we split most of the entrees.\nPopovers- Crispy on the outside, fluffy and soft on the inside. Paired excellently with the honey (?) butter on the table.  Better than Rotunda's.. there's a reason they're on the 2011 7x7 Big Eat list. We asked for two refills.\nSteak tartare (full serving)- Good, but not amazing. I think steak tartare is steak tartare, so I think a full serving was too much, even between 5 of us.\nEntrees: \n-Roast duck with bacon lardon- Sooo good. The portion isn't huge but the duck was done perfectly. Very tender and flavorful. \n-Pork shoulder with truffle mashed potatoes- The pork was tender but somewhat overpowered by the truffles.   \n-Hangtown fry- omelette with cheese, oysters, and a whole lot of other stuff. For me, it was the miss of the night. It was too heavy and reminded me of a okonamiyaki.\n-Organic fried chicken with rosemary- I was eating the first piece, which was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside, but it turns out that my piece was RAW. There was blood on the inside of the chicken, near the bone. We cut open the other pieces to see if they are raw as well, and turned out they were overcooked and as dry as sandpaper inside. We gave it back to our waitress and I asked for new utensils. She returned with a fresh plate, all of which were juicy and crispy, but by that point, we were full. \n\nSides:\n-Mac n Cheese- get this if you are a lover of mac n cheese. It's extremely creamy and heavy, but SO GOOD. One of the standouts that night.\n-Brussel sprouts- They're roasted brussel sprouts. \n\nWe skipped dessert and just had their amazing, complimentary gingersnaps that came with the bill. Sad to say, the gingersnaps were standout over some of the entrees. \nFor ~$40 each (no dessert, no drinks), I have to say that Wayfare was a bit of a letdown. The food wasn't terrible, but  the execution of the food was a little underwhelming for the price we paid. That's not to say it's bad food though--the concepts and the flavors are there. However, I will likely be back down the road, when they're a little more established.", "author": "Jen T."}

It was a special occasion and we would have liked to stay for the evening without feeling rushed because they wanted to seat the table again. I really thought a place this expensive would allow guests to savor each phase of the experience. \nWe enjoyed our apps which included very fresh oysters, salad choices were avocado salad, put together nicely and tasty. The caesar was fantastic. We enjoyed the side of broccolini and mac and cheese, which was good. Our entrees were exceptional scallops, perfect salmon, and the chicken. The chicken was crispy and ok. Just chicken on the plate. For the price they could have thrown in some potatoes or?.\nThe blueberry pie was really good, but again, we were rushed at that point.

As for the physical aspect of the restaurant, they really went with for the old \"tavern\" look, but still managed to throw some modern class in there- solid effort that paid off. The bar had these delicious homemade (I think) potato chips to snack on [dank!] and then they served us their famous popovers for a pre-meal bread like substance. The popovers were SOOOOOO fluffy and delectable.. I'd go back simply to get one and bounce. My co-workers and I were celebrating a few birthdays so we pretty much ordered everything from appetizers to dessert and it was all delicious. My menu looked something like this: Oysters and Deviled Eggs for an appetizer, Fried Chicken and I tried the Salmon for entrees, and then the Sticky Toffee Pudding for dessert. I saw someone order the fried chicken as I walked in and could NOT pass it up.. I am on a diet but I said \"F it\" for the day and went for it. It was amazzzinnnggg. Some of the best fried chicken I've had- it was tendor, juicy, and very flavorful. Not thrilled that it didn't come with a side dish or anything, but I guess that fancy restaurants can get away with it. The deviled eggs were very creamy and had a very subtle but delicious curry taste that made them very good. Sticky Toffee Pudding was a great way to finish the meal.. Every mouthful was low key heaven. They also wrote \"Happy Birthday\" for my co-worker on the plate quite elegantly. Impressed, again. \n\n\nWhat I recommend: Deviled Eggs (delicious), Fried Chicken (will probably be some of the best fried chicken you'll encounter), Popovers (you'll get them once you order), Sticky Pudding (very flavorful and rich, yet not toooooo heavy with the Ginger Ice Cream). \n\nNotes: Entrees here were about 20-30$ for lunch..

My review will echo many of the other reviews! \n\nWe sat on the first floor across from the kitchen. I was quite impressed with the quiet calm that the kitchen exuded, until i realized that there was definitely another one (likely much more bustling) on the floor below. The booth was very comfortable and our server was quite prompt in getting drinks and taking our order. No mess ups and service was good. The only negative thing is that she shouted unnecessarily, even though the restaurant was not that loud, which was somewhat awkward, but that was easily overlooked.\n\nI started with the CA burrata: killer, though the mustard greens slightly overwhelmed the delicate cheese, but highly recommended. I also split some oysters with our group: also delicious. The ones we had were delicate and briny, perfectly shucked, and absolutely fantastic. For entree I had the fried chicken: light crunchy crust, incredibly moist and tender chicken. My favorite actually were the breast pieces. The essentially give you half a chicken broken down and deep fried. One of the pieces was slightly oversalted, but overall the seasoning was spot-on. One of my dining group had the burger, which I snagged a bite of: juicy, tender, bursting with the Mt. Tam cheese and egg. The special tonight was a chicken pot pie stuffed to the brim with veggies, chicken and gravy. I had never had such a complex bite of chicken pie before. The veggies were perfectly cooked, not soggy as they are apt to be in many pot-pies, and the gravy had layer upon layer of flavor somehow stuffed in it. \n\nI don't know how we managed to find room for dessert, but I selected the sticky toffee pudding (*note, definitely a traditional british \"pudding\" rather than the america custard-y idea of pudding). SO GOOD. I substituted buttermilk ice cream for the ginger ice cream and I am so glad I did. The buttermilk ice cream had the tangy aftertaste of buttermilk without any of the lingering sour that one gets when drinking buttermilk straight. It was the perfect balance to the sweet, sticky, teeth-sticking toffee pudding. \n\nOverall, great meal, great atmosphere, and great time. \n\nOh and a side note, valet parking is only $10 so you don't have to stress about finding parking or hailing a cab afterwards.", "author": "Rachael B."}

After discussing w/ the ladies, we decided to make a reservation here about 6 weeks in advance.  The earliest time they had available was 830, which was slightly annoying, but it was fine and we only had to wait about 10 minutes.  The classic Victorian era cocktails reminded me of those from Comstock Saloon, so did the feel...It was very dark and manly, like some sort of a man's club from back in the day.  It was also SUPER noisy, we basically had to yell across the table to one another.\n\nOur party of 4 was guided up the steep staircase to the second floor where it was sweltering hot (as yesterday was the HOTTEST day of the year in SF).  On that note, I wasn't feeling as hungry as I normally would be and didn't take full advantage of the entrees like I should have.\n\nImbibe and devour consisted of: \n-2 bottles of Groth, which was a lovely and refreshing Sauvignon Blanc\n-2 fig on a plate salads which came with FRESH FIGS (my fav), roasted onion, burrata cheese, sunflower seeds, and a honey-black pepper dressing.  This was by far the best salad I've had in quite some time.  Such a perfect summer treat.\n-1 watermelon salad with radishes, ricotta salata, Kalamata olives, fresh fennel and herbs.  The watermelon was beautiful in color and tasted super fresh.  They totally skimped on the cheese and olives though.\n-Grilled Monterey Bay Calamari, which was INCREDIBLE! The flavor combination couldn't have been more of a party in my mouth...The grilled pieces of calamari were drizzles with a lemon, chili, olive oil, garlic, parsley & herbed breadcrumbs sauce.  The breadcrumbs combined with the calamari was a great texture.\n-Sardines, also from Monterey Bay-personally, I wasn't so into the presentation of the sardines, they were huge and seemed to be creepily looking directly at you...Taste on the other hand, was delectable, not too fishy, they were served roasted with a garlic-parsley lemon butter sauce. Mmm.\n-the Alaskan salmon was cooked without flaw and I loved the fava beans and pancetta that came with it.  I thought the dish was super creative, have never had salmon with that kind of a touch.\n-the Cowgirl ricotta ravioli was another winner--came with a roasted summer squash pur\u00e9e, shaved dry Jack cheese, spiced pistachios, which added a nice crunch...I'm a sucker for anything with ricotta cheese though!\n\nDessert was so fabulous it deserves to be it's own category just for this review!  After studying the menu at work and asking the server's recommendations, we decided on the Frog Hollow Organic Peach Pie.  Wow. Goat's Milk ice cream is basically foodgasm-worthy and the pie itself was so large, I really do not see how one person could kill it.  The peaches were very fresh and exactly how peaches are supposed to taste and the rosemary sugar atop the ice cream was a nice addition.   The one issue I had was the server's explanation stating it was \"full of lard,\" which doesn't seem appetizing, but after biting into that flaky awesome crust, I guess I'm ok with the way it was made -- with lard AND love!   \n\nThanks, Tyler, for an amazing new restaurant in San Francisco!", "author": "Jenny W."}

Every dish, from the light, fresh and warm popovers - just like the best Yorkshire pudding - to the sweet sticky toffee pudding for dessert. The Mussels have an incredibly flavorful sauce flavored with pork belly and sweet potatoes. If you are looking for a very quiet place for dinner, this may not be the place for you. The bar and open kitchen on the main floor are the centre of the action. The steak frites is a great entree, however, my steak was served quite rare although I ordered it Medium. \nMy second visit, the mussels were no longer on the menu - which was disappointing. I ordered the Fried Chicken everyone said was the signature dish. While it was well cooked, not too greasy and nicely seasoned - I can't say it will be extremely memorable. I was looking forwared my husband trying the steak frites, however it was replaced on the menu by another steak. My husband is a steak lover and wasn't that impressed. While it was cooked rare to his liking, he could get something better at The Keg. On the first visit, I was intrigued to try the Mac and Cheese...It was very rich, but perhaps a little too rich compared to the Fried Chicken. The volume in the restaurant on this visit was even higher - so definitely not the best for a quiet dinner with my husband.\nOverall, I think it is a good restaurant - but perhaps a bit inconsistent.", "author": "Alissa H."}

I've been to the restaurant twice before - once for lunch and the other for dinner.  On both occasions, I had great service.  On Saturday, 10/9, that all went out the window.  We were a party of 7 with reservations at 9:15PM.  We all arrived around 9 and my partner went to check in with the hostess.  She clearly saw all of us walk in, but, told my partner she could not seat us until the entire party arrived.  Seriously????  To top that off, she kept insisting (with major attitude) that the party was suppose to be for 6 people, yet, her computer clearly noted a party of 7.  Her last words to my partner was \"I'll see what I can do!\"  Really, B**ch!  She was so pissed off that she had our waitress seat us!\n\nOur waitress was nice enough.  With a party that large, she should have taken out a note pad to jot down our orders.  As you might have guessed, she missed some of the orders.\n\nHopefully, this was just an off night.

We showed up about 10 minutes early and the hostess told us there was a group leaving and we'd be seated asap.

She said she was trying (though I saw at least 3 other parties being seated during this time frame) and sent us over a plate of deviled eggs.  Very nice gesture, but in my opinion our drinks should have been comped since we waited so long.\n\nThe dinner was mostly excellent -- the fried chicken is to die for! The steak was delicious.

We went here for Friday night dinner with reservations at 8:30 n we weren't seated until 9:30 due to people not wanting to get up from the their tables. The restaurant is a bit small but it does give it a cozy feel. The bar area is the place to be. Super cute small area but it works. So the sad part of the night is Tyler wasn't in and that was going to be the highlight of the day since I came from Dallas to see him. \nSo we sat upstairs which the spot we sat in wasn't the best but we made the best of it. So we just settled in and that's when the circus acts started. Someone comes up with the dishes, then the wines glasses, then the water boy. It was a funny scene like a circus. So finally the server showed up who seemed was a little too busy with all her other tables but we didn't complain. We ordered the mussels and can't remember the other one but it doesn't matter they were sold out of it. It was only 9:30 n sold out already?? Ok so we ordered the half lobster. We went ahead n put in our dinner items too. Our table ordered the lamb shank, the Scottish Salmon, and Steak frites. This is why I give this place a 4. We didn't see our waitress for a good 20-40 minutes which included no starters either. The other waiter who looked like n actor who I can't put my finger on kept coming by to check on us. He kept looking at our empty table n would go to the kitchen. This happened about 6 times. We aren't complainers but 2 tables who came in after us got apps before us. So finally it has arrived...the mussels werent hot but not cold just warm, a little odd. So there is about 20 mussels n out of the 5 I had 3 of them were missing mussels. And didn't complain n just ate cause it actually was pretty good except I would have loved bread to dip in the sauce but there weren't any with the app. The lobster dish is TINY. U get one bite for $18 not worth it for an app. So our food arrives n this is were my 5 star would come in. Yummy. The salmon was de-lish with clams. Wonderful flavors, tender fish just great mix on the dish. The lamb shank was wonderful. I had a piece and I'm not a lamb person but yummy. It looked like the popular item of the night. I didn't try the steak but it did also look amazing. No dessert for us so we were going to pop but got some great cookies at the end from the actor looking guy, who was real nice. Overall a great dinner, wonderful flavors. I would have given a 5 but service wasn't there so had to give a 4. Enjoy your meal.", "author": "Sun M."}

Overall, however, the food was good. We started off our meal with the complimentary popovers which my girlfriend and I agreed were fantastic. We had the deviled eggs and fried oysters as starters. The deviled eggs were very good but the fried oysters were great. We had the \"famous\" fried chicken which was good but not great. The steak was a bit dry. The chocolate cream pie was good but not great. I expected a bit more. As a footnote, I would like to comment that I believe Tyler Florence is a fantastic chef. I purchased his Tyler's Ultimate Cookbook many years ago and have made many wonderful recipes from his book. It's safe to say that I learned how to cook through that book and it sits as one of my primary cookbooks in my kitchen. I would recommend the restaurant to others but I was a bit disappointed with the service. Our server was inattentive, offered no recommendations and over a 2 hour meal visited our table less than 5 times. The couple next to us were offered complimentary popovers 3 times while my girlfriend and I were offered one each. To make matters worse, they took over our popover plates which made me think the popover guy didn't think we wanted any more popovers but he was wrong..... In summary, we had a good meal, but, given my admiration for Mr. Florence, I expected a fantastic experience.  We had a very nice experience.  By the way, the hostess was very friendly and we sat at a good table on the upper level.  Great ambiance.", "author": "Tom D."}

I haven't come across a 5-star restaurant in a while, but Wayfare Tavern deserves every star. \n\nWe came in late for our reservation on Valentine's Day due to all the traffic, but was surprisingly seated immediately. If you make reservations and call to confirm it, they'll hold the table for you! I started off with the Pomegranate Fizz (delicious!) and bf got a beer which was also great. Their fluffy bread was to die for. Nice and moist in the middle yet soooo airy. We got deviled eggs for an app, which was good but I kinda wish I had tried the Poutine instead. For the main course, I got the butcher's filet (medium) and bf got the fried chicken. While he didn't think their fried chicken was the best ever, I thought the butteriness and crispiness was amazing. The fried batter literally fell off the meat as I was biting into it and crumbled and melted in my mouth all at the same time. *dies* My Butcher's Filet was also delicious and not overcooked or undercooked like at many other restaurants. The bone marrow sauce...you guessed it, amazing. We also got the mac'n cheese which was good but not the best I've had. My belly was also bursting at the time, so that might've distracted me from fully tasting the mac n cheese.\n\nThe ambience was also perfect for Valentine's day and staff was very friendly.

We didn't have any reservations, but they sat at the bar area in front of the kitchen area - which was nice since we could watch them prepare meals. \n\nOur first waitress was nice and was going to take our order after we had a chance to decide.  But then another waitress took her place instead and she was not friendly at all. Her comments, tone, and rolling of her eyes when she thought we weren't looking was hardly appropriate.   When the food was being brought over, they didn't know who ordered what.  For this price and supposed quality, I would expect you to be able to place the dishes in front of the person who ordered it. The food was also mediocre and way too salty.  I couldn't taste anything but salt and pepper.

Food sitting on the pass, the sous chef slapping food onto dishes, cooks playing on their phones -- the only time they acted like a professional kitchen was when the head chef appeared. Then everything was carefully treated and garnished.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-26", "description": "Wow.\n\nI mean wow.\n\nSo... I had heard a lot of hype about this restaurant due in large part to it's infamous owner. Since my parents were coming in town, I figured it was as good of time as any to try it out. Upon our arrival, we were seated promptly, even though we were a few minutes early, to our wonderful table upstairs. On a side note, my parents and I (who are HUGE food network fans) totally scoped out Tyler Florence who was standing in the kitchen overlooking the fabulous dishes being meticulously assembled in the kitchen. ALSO on a side note, my parents and I were discussing just how much it meant to have Tyler Florence present on a day-to-day basis in the kitchen of this amazing restaurant because it adds such a personal touch to the overall experience. There are many famous chefs/actors/singers/artists that own restaurants across the US, but it becomes so impersonal because it feels like just another piece of their multi-million dollar empire, whereas having the chef in the kitchen at all times, makes it feel like really in the end, he just cares about serving damn good food. and they do. I mean... this food is amazing. There wasn't a dish that we tried that we were not oo-ing and aww-ing over. Even with the bone marrow appetizer... it was VERY different, but we wanted to try it because none of us had ever had it (and I had read on Yelp that it was good).\nAnyways, we just felt that having the main man present to look over his kitchen really added a special element to this restaurant experience.\n\nOkay... now for the food. WOW. It was amazing. I mean, everything down to the bread was phenomenal. They make these \"pop-overs\" that put every bread basket to shame. SO good. (I contemplated throwing one into my purse to save for later... but thought better of it :)\n\nFor appetizers, we had the grilled calamari (which I thought was fantastic) as well as the bone marrow, which is worth trying if you've never had it. I think it was a pretty positive experience, especially with the balsamic reduction that is already placed on the toasted bread that adds a wonderful sweetness to the overall dish.\n\nMoving on... the entrees that we chose were the New York Strip (medium rare), the Roasted Duck Breast (Blue Plate Special), the Burger and the Roasted Beets. Ohhhhhh...my...heavens. To start the Duck Breast was the best I've ever had... I can't say that I am a duck connoisseur but this dish was amazing! The duck leg confit was cooked medium rare and served with duck sausage, a duck egg and figs. So good. I had the New York Strip (my first time ever ordering one) and it was so decadent and delicious, cooked medium rare (maybe a little more medium than I prefer) but still it had SUCH great flavor. Not to mention it was topped with mushrooms. Yum. My dad ordered the burger that came with THE most amazing fries. I didn't try his burger but he was pretty happy with it, trying it out with the egg (which he'd never had before). Mmmm... I still dream of those fries. So good. The side order of beets were definitely a good choice. I LOVE roasted beets and these definitely did not disappoint.\n\nAlong with our meal we enjoyed a Pinot Gris recommended by the Sommelier who was very helpful. \n\nTo finish this amazing meal, we were sure to order the Frog Hollow Organic Peach Pie, which we noticed everyone around us ordering. Once again, it did not disappoint.

I wanted so much to like this place, but it was a total disappointment. I was completely underwhelmed by every aspect of my experience. Here's the breakdown:\n\nAtmosphere: Beautiful decor, excellent location - you walk in and there is an awesome vibe - cozy, modern with a sprinkling of luxe. The problem: the noise level. Let me be clear, the obnoxious girl at the table next to me who didn't have an inside voice didn't help, but seriously the noise level was deafening. Maybe it's the amazing lofted ceilings, but man I couldn't hear myself think.\n\nFood: The food was good. I give it a solid B. The menu is fresh, seasonal and local. We split the beets, burger, short ribs and pudding pumpkin cake. Everything was good, but in San Francisco, that's just not enough. Tyler just didn't win me over with interesting flavors. No big complaints, but no surprises and that's kinda the worst part. \n\nService: There is no other way to say this - it was by far the worst dining experience I have had in recent memory. I am not trying to be dramatic, but honestly, not acceptable at a restaurant of this caliber.  Our rezo was at 8:45 on a Thursday. We were seated a bit after our time, no biggie. We then sat for close to 10 minutes before anyone even came over. We didn't get our food until 10:15 - and it's not the delay was on our end. We were ready to order shortly after we sat down. Our experience was one of those were they were trying to rush us through - we were sharing plates and they tried 3 times to take the plates out of the way before we were finished, yet our waiter was MIA. My boyfriend asked for extra condiments for the burger (since we were splitting) and those never showed. The waiter never checked on us. I finally had to waive him down to ask for the dessert menu and check.  The attitude was a little snooty, like \"you guys are lucky you even got in\". I mean, this is San Francisco, not LA. \n\nAll in all I left dinner so frustrated that the restaurant was so far from meeting my expectations because I really wanted to like it. I just don't get it, how can a world class chef run such a mediocre spot?", "author": "Gretchen S."}

If you look beyond the flash of celebrities, and the expensive prices, you don't find much substance here.  It felt like everything was designed to appear sophisticated as long as you don't look too closely.  It's a dinner theme park.  I don't recommend it unless you don't really care about food and just want to go see and be seen, in which case it's fantastic.\n\nIf you care to read the details:\n\nWe had to wait 45 minutes for our table despite the 9:30 reservation so we had a drink at the bar.  The cocktails looked like they would be good and the bartender put a lot of effort into them.  I think he had to go searching for ingredients at one point because we didn't see him for about 5 minutes during the process, or maybe the drink recipe called for aging.  In any case, my drink tasted like pineapple juice.  Hm.\n\nWe finally got seated and they took our drink orders and left.  Our waitress didn't come back for at least twenty minutes to take our orders.\n\nThe appetizers were hit or miss.  I liked the organic watermelon because it was a slice of watermelon.  The salt roasted bone marrow was good.  The sea urchin with corn puree and pickles tasted odd, like not every ingredient in that dish belonged there.  I thought it might just be a matter of taste but nobody at our table liked it.\n\nThen we sat around and waited.  Props to the guy who refilled our water.  He was attentive.  The waitress ignored us.  She never came by to apologize for the wait or to explain what the hold-up was or to see if we needed anything.  We didn't get our entrees until 11:45, with the exception of my entree which came 5 minutes later.\n\nI had the fried chicken.  I thought a famous chef could make it into something special.  It was tasty but it was just fried chicken with nothing to accompany it.  The steak was very good.  The french fries that came with the burger were terrible and cold.  One of the other entrees was cold.\n\nWe didn't even consider dessert because we wanted to get out of there before sunrise.", "author": "Jocelyn W."}

It is absolutely on spot with the 'turn of the century' theme. As soon as you walk in, you are transported back to early 1900's. Everything in the restaurant was made sure that it stayed true to the era, even down to the plates and utensils. Very elegant. \n\nOK, now to the food. I loved most of our dishes. We started out with the complimentary fresh popovers! I LOVE fresh bread! Then we had the steak tartare with the organic egg. It was superb!! The half order was plenty and can feed 3-4 people. EB ordered the organic fried chicken. He really enjoyed it. I had a few bites and I really wished I ordered his dish. Meat was flavorful and moist while still maintaining the tasty crunch on the outside! It was perfect. I had the Wayfare burger. I thought it was above average but not stellar. The burger patty was medium rare (the way I like it) but the bacon made the burger a bit too smokey for me. I guess some people will like that but I wanted to taste the burger more. It was a messy entree but that means the burger was juicy. While we were enjoying our food, we also had several different glasses of pinot noir. Wayfare has great wine selection. Some may not even be on the menu. You will have to ask your waiter. Speaking of waiter, we had the BEST service! Ethan, you rock! \nFor dessert, we had the pineapple upside down cake that had the salted caramel ice cream. What a great twist to a traditional dessert! It was good but I wished I tasted more of the pineapple. It was more on the sweeter side. I still liked it and the macadamia nut brittle was perfect to help calm the sweetness of the cake. \nChef Tyler is always in the kitchen. He makes sure everything that comes out of his kitchen is picture perfect and Chef Tyler approved. So, if you're lucky, you might bump into him. \nI really enjoyed my dining experience at Wayfare Tavern. I can't wait to come back.", "author": "Molly T."}

And actually I think I kind of like Louisiana Fried Chicken better, but the wife thought it was the best.\nWe sat at the bar and had a glass of beer and a glass of wine.

We can be a little picky but Wayfare Tavern did not disappoint.\n\nDRINKS / BAR\nWe started off at the bar with drinks.  The bar area is in a smaller space as this is not a cavernous restaurant  which to me makes it more intimate.  Full bar with wine, cocktails, and beer on tap.  I had their Occidental Punch which was quite delicious.  \n\nFOOD\nFabulous.  Everything we ordered was delicious.  The popovers were huge and tasty, but I don't think they were to die for (ok, the first batch was a little burnt so that lowered the points).  They take a little while to bake so it can take awhile to get seconds so pace yourself and save a little to eat with your tartare.  Here is what we had:\n\n- Steak Tartare ($16): You have to get this.  Yes, it is raw beef and has a raw egg, but it isn't like you're getting this from McDonald's.  Perfectly seasoned, texture, and popovers with some buttery garlic.  My only wish would be they serve it with more one more popover to eat with the tartare.\n- Dates Wrapped in Bacon ($12): Good, but when are dates wrapped in bacon not good?  So while I think this was delicious, it wasn't anything special.\n- Chicken Liver Mousse with Toasted Brioche ($14):  Love the presentation as the mousse comes in a little glass jar, four halves of brioche toast, pomelo marmalade.  Tasty and a generous portion. \n- Duck Gumbo ($26): An elegant version of gumbo with duck confit and a delicious duck andouille sausage with the perfect kick.  This was delicious and I would consider getting this next time.\n- Pot Roast ($28): The braised short rib was perfectly tender and juicy. This isn't your mother's pot roast.  The shavings of truffle were divine.  I personally prefer slightly less whipped mashed potatoes - they were a little too light and airy for me.  I just realized the delicious sauce was a veal jus - personally prefer not to eat anything related to veal and think this dish could be equally as delicious using something more humanely raised.\n- Steak Frites ($26): Delicious and exactly as it should be.  Steak was perfectly cooked for me (pink in the middle) and fries were thin cut and crisp (not shoestring).\n- Yellowfin Tuna Crudo ($15): Technically not an entr\u00e9e so not an entr\u00e9e sized portion.  You get 3 or 4 of these wonderful and unique crudos (think nigiri sized).  Cornmeal battered and fried oyster with a light julienne celery root remoulade with a thin sliver of tuna on top.  I really liked the unique flavors and textures.\n- Mac N' Cheese ($8): Thank you Yelpers, you did not steer me wrong.  Great flavor, perfect cheesy texture with the required crunchy topping to make a great mac n' cheese.  \n\n\nSERVICE\nGreat.  Attentive without being overbearing.  Friendly.  Knowledgeable about the menu.  And we lingered a bit that night so I'm sure they wanted to turn our table over but unlike some other restaurants, they were classy about this.  They didn't rush us out but eventually subtly collected our leftover tickets (they keep this for you so you don't have bags all over your table) as a hint.  I didn't mind at all, they have a restaurant to run after all.  \n\nAMBIANCE\nBrink walls, high ceiling, open kitchen, traditional design with a modern twist, great booths, and a fabulous fireplace at the end.

The place was busy, and if someone had come around to explain that to us we wouldn't complain, but these people just ignored us, acting like what we experienced was what we should expect. \nAnd I'm sorry, paying 22 bucks for fried chicken that takes an hour and a half to arrive just sucks. I really hope I don't have to explain that any further to anyone. It's just lame, and it sucks that the experience was so shitty. I wish I had better things to say about this place, but forgettable food after an hour and a half is just inexcusable.\nI guess I should've expected a disappointing experience since 90% of the reviews for this place give it 5 stars because the people reviewing are fans of Tyler Florence and his amazing contributions to Applebees, but I held out hope that the experience wouldn't suck.  The menu needs serious work.  We got a bunch of appetizers, and while they looked interesting on the menu the execution was poor and there wasn't one I'd be excited to revisit.  Bear in mind that these appetizers arrived before the hour and a half that we just sat there doing nothing, so my mood wasn't all that crummy as I tried them, they were just way overpriced.\n\nOh, and if that wasn't enough a friend went there the night before and there was a fried bug in their salad.  It was like a mosquito eater or something.

The lady and I enjoyed two glasses of dolcetto at the bar while we waited for our table. We scored a really small table upstairs along the banquet, and waited for 10 minutes to be greeted by anybody. Our server, although super friendly, rushed through his introduction to the menu. Giving us his personal highlights to certain dishes, but not explaining why they were his favorite. \"I really enjoy the bone marrow and the Halibut\" instead of saying... \"The bone marrow is roasted in the oven \nso its nice an crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, then garnished with crunchy capers, breadcrumbs and a lovely herb salad.\" We ordered a few things to share. \n\nMontery squid- slightly spicy and nice and tender. Nothing to write home to mom about though.\n\nHearts of palm and avocado salad- the whole salad itself was delicious and really well balanced in flavors. Sweet, rich, crunchiness from the hearts of palm and slight acidity from the dressing. They should switch the name around to an Avocado salad though because they give you a whole avocado and maybe 3 slices of hearts of palm.\n\nBone Marrow- aka \"beef butter\" so yummy. 2 huge long halves of beef shanks, crispy capers, herb salad served with 2 tiny crostini. The portion is huge and probably could give you a cardiac arrest. But that didn't stop us from letting beef gelatin run down our chins.\n\nCreamed corn- the cobs of the corn are cooked down with veggie stock. and some of the kernals are pureed then its put in the oven. Dairyless creamed corn? Yes please! delcious\n\nService was pleasant, although our server did seemed a tad rushed and slightly stressed. He also pressed the fact that we needed to order our apps and entrees at the same time. Even after we requested that we wanted a few apps then wanted to see if we were hungy enough for entrees. He said I'll give you a few more minutes to decide on your entrees and walked away annoyed. We get it, he was the Turn and Burn your table kind of server. There also was this random lady, dressed in black slacks and a black tank top that would carry one drink at a time from the bar to a table. We sat a tried to figure out her role in the restaurant? Was she the sommlier? No, she wasn't engaging enough to her guests, nor did she help refill wine glasses. Was she a Manager? No, she definitely wasn't dressed to be a floor manager, nor was she able to direct the staff. Was she a drink runner? Who knows?!

Two years ago, I made his recipe for pb and jelly cupcakes (even bought a little squeezy bottle for the jelly to be pumped into the middle of the cupcake).  But they weren't tasty.  TyTy dissapointed me.  Then last yr, Hubert's hyped burger bar so dissappointed me, I wrote a scathing review with terms such as \"sucks BIG BALLZ\" and \"SHIT-tastic\".  I felt like an angry white male.  So you see, celebrity-chefs and me, not so great a history.  With that in mind, fast forward to last night. \n\nTHE VERDICT:\nRedemption. TyTy's fried chicken has restored my faith.  My immediate reaction upon taking a bite of the fried chicken: \"omagod, omagod, omagod\"!  It was effing amazing. the exact opposite of my knee jerk reaction to burger bar.  all the yelp reviews are not hype.  This chicken was juicy and so moist and tender on the inside and the fried flavoring/seasoning was SO delicious.  with all the fantastic herbs.  At first I was using knife and fork. Then I got my grubby hands on a drumstick, ditched the utensils which served no purpose but to get in the way of me and chicken.  So I ate it like drumsticks were designed to be eaten.  Hands were greasy.  I was picking up the fried herbs that were on the plate.  Bits of chicken were stuck to my face. I felt savage.  Perhaps the taxidermy staring down at me from the walls fueled the savageness. But it was oh so good. WOW.  Maverick, farmer brown and that KFC colonel ain't got nothin' on my TyTy's fried chicken!\n\nBy far, the fried chicken was the best thing I ate at Wayfare.  They were out of the frog hollow peach pie.  So instead we got the upside down pineapple cake.  Which was super sweet and big too!  They give big portions here and it's heavy with all those ingredients TyTy likes: buttah, buttah, and sugar (for desserts).  Definitely a meat-heavy restaurant.  \n\nOk, sorry TyTy, cover your ears/eyes, b/c I'm gonna constructively critique your service. Lady who took our order was rude, seemed angry or suffering from severe case of PMS and/or PMDD. (Maybe she just ate at burger bar?)  She pretty much barked at us. We asked for a wine reco and she said in a huff: \"well, what do you want-- white or red?\".  when we asked for a rec for main course # 2--the fish or the pork chops, her one line huff:  \"the fish\".  no explanation, no description. no expression on her face. (too much botox?). and the fish was NOT good. come dessert, she didn't ever offer us coffee. TyTy, work on service, please! I like your fried chicken so much I was making up excuses for her behavior!\n\nSKIP:\nThe crispy skin halibut. Halibut, stewed tomatoes. Boring.\n\nWHAT NOT TO EXPECT:\n-To look smokin' hot in your skivvies the same evening. \n-Also, probably don't plan on hitting the beach within 24 hours of gorging here.\n-Consistent service", "author": "Caroline I."}

Most of the reviews raved about the fried chicken and popovers, so I headed over there.  Seated at the bar, I ordered a cocktail which, while good, was about half the size you would expect for a $12 cocktail.  There were fresh potato chips set out on the bar and they were great ... but little did I suspect at the time that they would be the best part of the meal!  The butter lettuce salad was also quite good, though the green goddess dressing was more acidic than expected.  The popover was good, but identical to the ones I have been eating for years at The Rotunda, so nothing really special.  Then the fried chick arrived -- five small pieces with herbs on top and lemon wedges at the side (not sure why).  I eagerly dug into the first piece only to discover that it was pink on the inside.  I tried to get the bartender's attention to show him, but he was busy, so I cut into the next piece.  Not pink inside, but not especially moist or tasty either.  (By now, I was wishing I had gone to Miller's Deli on Polk, which has better fried chicken for about one-third of the price ....)  I took the last three pieces home with me and will hope they aren't pink when I heat them up tomorrow.

My friend had to make a reservation a week in advance to make sure we got a chance to eat here. I felt chic and sophisticated eating with the rest of the business crowd for lunch. Fancy American comfort food and new spins on old favorites. I enjoyed the rich and creamy macaroni and cheese and seared sonoma foie gras. I could have done without the dry french toast with the foie gras but I liked the sweet contrast of the Oregon huckleberry. I ate the organic fried chicken - buttermilk brine, roasted garlic, crisp woody herbs, lemon with a variety of pieces. I also had the Sonoma Pork Belly - beluga lentils, candied rutabaga, fris\u00e9e, salt and vinegar potato chips, cider jus, and thyme. I've liked every pork belly I've tried and continue to scope out more places with it. The richness and fattiness that melts in my mouth.

Hostess was nice about it though.\n\nDecor, old school, loved it. It made the atmosphere inviting, to me. Reminding me of old hunting cabins or libraries. \n\nService... great actually, despite some of the other yelp reviews.\n\nFood: just ok. The popovers were very good, although it would have been nice to have some kind of flavored butter w/ them (even though they don't need butter). Florence is known for bold flavors, which this food definitely had. \n\nGrilled Monterey Bay calamari, $10... good, although perhaps a bit too much olive oil (and butter?)... the calamari were practically swimming in the sauce.\n\nOrganic Marin tomatoes, $12... should be called 'organic Marin tomato' as we only received 1 medium red tomato cut into 4 pieces. NOT WORTH $12. Maybe 2 tomatoes are worth $12, but not one. The accompaniments were tasty, although they did not make up for the fact I paid $12 for one tomato.\n\nWayfare burger 'le grand', $18... what is 'le grand' about this burger besides it being grass fed? it was so small, probably 3 inches in diameter. It was very tasty and all the toppings were yummy, but b/c it was so juicy it made the bottom bun soggy and my hands smelled like grease the rest of the day. The fries were great, I could not stop eating them. I'd like to know how 1/5 lb. ground beef + sides can be $18.\n\nCrisp pacific halibut, $25... I think this was the best dish, although it was swimming in butter like the calamari. The fish was cooked just right- moist and flaky. Although it had a heavy sauce, the fish itself was light. Sides were fine.\n\nOverall the service was good, but the food was disappointing. It wasn't horrible, but it just didn't meet up to the standards I have of Florence, and the food was not worth the price.

What a way to talk to your customers. We started off with the Barrata. It was tasty but I've had similar dishes in other restaurants. Then we ordered two sides which really should be taken off the menu. The mac and cheese was so bitter from the jack cheese. The worst mac and cheese I've EVER had. It was so bad, no one ate it ! I took a bite of it and my friend tried a small serving and no one touched it after that. I ordered the Halibut as my entree. It was so salty I didn't finish that either! The other parties at the table ordered the fried chicken, pasta dish, and steak dish. We each tried a bit of one another's dishes and nothing tasted that memorable. Dessert was also not very impressive either. We ordered the creme brulee w olive ice cream and chocolate pie. The pie was so decadent that we each took a bite and couldn't eat anymore.

Also plan for an hour and a half to two hours for a meal and paying a bit more for decent (not great) food. \n\nLong story - My husband and I went here twice during our vacation to San Francisco. The first time we tried the Mac n cheese and both had burgers and iced tea. We didn't have reservations and were seated in the bar area promptly. The service was ok, the highlight of the meal were the popovers. The burger was pretty good, though extremely rich and a bit rarer than we like. The iced tea was full of flavor. The Mac n cheese we should've skipped. Not worth it.\n\nStill, we came back a second time as I had to try the deviled eggs and fried chicken recommended by a few of my friends. This time we had reservations. We were seated quickly and were greeted by a friendly waiter. The chicken was pretty good and I enjoyed the eggs. This time the husband got a coke and I stuck to the iced tea. Then things started to take a dive. We watched another table get offered more popovers while we were skipped (no big deal - though a bit of a disappointment since they're delicious), then it took forever for anyone to notice we were done with dinner. On a whim we decided to get dessert and were excited to also try the free little cakes other tables were getting. Dessert was pretty good, but no go on the cakes - we didn't get any and it took another ten minutes to get our check. Again, we could overlook this since hey, we bought dessert. Um, then the bill came along with a nice charge for $10.50 worth of soda. When the waiter asked if everything was ok, I mentioned I didn't realize the soda didn't have free refills to which he apologized...I wasn't looking for them to comp anything but we definitely left with a bad taste in our mouths after the lengthy service, being overlooked multiple times, and ridiculous soda charges.

My wife, college grad son and I were seated promptly upon our arrival by a very pleasant hostess next to a pair of gentlemen who were merrily enjoying their meal. A conversation was stuck up between our 2 tables and soon recommendations were being proffered as to what we should order. My son who had never had Steak Tartare was intrigued enough by the suggestion that we order it that he did just that. In fact the 3 of us ordered just about everything that was suggested. My wife enjoyed the fried chicken and fried potatoes. My son happily started with the Hearts of Palm salad with avocado, followed by the previously mentioned Steak Tartare and the Mac and Cheese. I started with the Butter Lettuce Salad followed by the Scallops. Our dining companions left before we finished our dinner but before they left we all agreed that their suggestions had been most appreciated. Portion size was as expected for an restaurant that is positioned as a fine dining establishment. Same can be said for pricing. I would recommend Wayfare Tavern to anyone.", "author": "Marc L."}

I feel like he was a major presence on Food Network and big in the early 2000s but has since sort of faded away in terms of press.  I hadn't really thought about eating at one of his restaurants but upon the recommendation of my family, I ate at Wayfare Tavern tonight and I was really pleased with my food and experience considering the circumstances.  First of all, I was not hungry at all.  I had eaten a huge dim sum brunch, gone hiking and was tired, cold and a little bit cranky.  But after waiting about a half hour (we were very early for our reservation), I felt the stirrings of hunger and it was on.  We started the meal with complimentary popovers which were tasty and fluffy and the way a great popover should be.  Then we split the deviled eggs for an appetizer.  These were some of my favorite deviled eggs ever.  They were topped with a little fried shrimp and pickles and the filling had a nice celery flavor.  For an entree, I had the fried chicken with a side of mac and cheese.  The fried chicken comes with roasted herbs so it has a nice earthy look to it when it comes out.  I also appreciated the sheer amount of chicken in the dish.  I felt like it was 3/4 or maybe even a whole chicken (I'm assuming since organic chickens do run smaller and this seemed to be a lot of chicken!).  The chicken was moist and juicy and had some nice flavors and I appreciated the roasted garlic cloves that came on the side.  The mac and cheese was fine, nothing mind blowing and I did feel like the fried chicken would be better served by coming with a side vs me having to order one unless I literally just wanted to eat fried chicken like some crazy carnivore.  The servers were very pleasant and smiley and friendly.  The window was open and cold air was blowing directly in my path, leading me to be freezing.  I asked our waiter to close the window which he kindly obliged but maybe 10 minutes later, someone else opened up the window again (a smaller crack but still).  If the restaurant is that overheated for the servers, maybe turn on the air conditioning to regulate the temperature or open a window that is out of the way of patrons!  The meal ended with some complimentary brown butter and sea salt cookies that were super buttery and a lovely sweet note to end our meal on.", "author": "Lisa W."}

I can't think of one negative thing about my experience here. The deviled egg appetizer was our starter. My family raises chickens and I could tell the eggs were extremely fresh.  The curry flavors were perfectly complemented by the crispy shallots on top. I was expecting maybe two or three deviled eggs, but there were six.  I had the cowgirl creamery ravioli, the seasonal vegetarian dish. The flavors were complex, it was beautifully presented and like the eggs, I could tell the ingredients were  fresh.  My boyfriend had the hamburger...he loves hamburgers and says this is his new number one. It came on a brioche bun, with cheese and thick sliced caramelized onions.  I tried the bread and butter pickles that came with it and they were very good.  Oh, and the popover (straight out of the oven) was a nice surprise.   I had the financier cake and he had the chocolate cream pie, they were both melt in your mouth good. We will definitely go back every time we are in SF.", "author": "Sara B."}

With a new five-month old baby we rarely get to eat out anymore so we when we finally got a date night to ourselves, we went a little nuts. Between the two of us we managed to put down:\n\n- Bottle of 2007 Littorai\n- Steak tartare with egg yolk\n- Roasted beets with housemade riccotta and grapefruit\n- Yellow fin tuna crudo\n- Bone marrow with shaved fennel and panko breadcrumbs\n- Seared foie gras with huckleberry reduction\n- Fried chicken\n- Mac n cheese\n- Sticky toffee pudding with black pepper ice cream\n- Lemon curd and huckleberry sorbet\n\nWhile everything was fantastic, my faves were the steak tartare, bone marrow, and mac n cheese. I was a little wary of the bone marrow because of how rich it can be. I didn't want it spoiling my appetite for the rest of the dinner. But this bone marrow was actually quite light, and instead of being served with toast it was sprinkled with panko bread crumbs on top. That really provided a nice crispy texture to complement the richness of the marrow. The fried chicken was more than enough for the two of us so thank god we didn't order two entrees (plus we wouldn't have had enough room to order all the small plates).\n\nFood aside, I just have a few criticisms: 1) the service was spotty (after we were seated it took awhile for the waiter to come and take our order); 2) the timing of the meal was a bit rushed (as soon as we finished one course, they would immediately clear the table and serve the next course within five minutes). I'm not sure if it had to do with us sitting right by the kitchen and the fact that it was a busy Friday night, but I kind of like a lag between courses so I can digest, enjoy my wine and anticipate whatever is coming next; 3) the table was too small! (with all the food we ordered it was like a game of tetris trying to place all the plates and glasses so they would fit on the table). Also, although the space is pretty large I really feel like they packed us in there. The closely spaced tables and the huge crowd gathered at the bar at the front of the restaurant made the place feel more cramped than cozy. Now I know for next time when I make a reservation to request a table upstairs.\n\nOh and one thing that I've never seen at a restaurant before. They have a claim check for your leftovers! We couldn't finish our mac n cheese and had it wrapped up. Instead of handing us our doggie bag at the table, they gave us a ticket so we could pick it up on the way out. What a nice touch!\n\nTyler Florence really does comfort food right and we can't wait to go back.", "author": "Amy H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-11-15", "description": "Back in July my husband whisked me off for a weekend in the city.  Included in our weekend away was dinner at Wayfare Tavern (something I was eagerly anticipating as the reviews at this point were mostly good).  I made the reservation with ease on Open Table and after drinks at the hotel bar and a brief stint at the Giants game, off we went.  To say that Tyler Florence has transformed the old Rubicon space would be an understatement and I invite everyone to just go see it as the place is remarkable.  Like stepping into a grand, old east coast residence you're transported; the wood paneling and old English vibe give this restaurant a coziness and sexiness not typically seen until recently with new places popping up all over the city that are offering up an experience for all five+ senses.  \nUpon arrival, we were asked to wait as we were a little early.  We noticed the bar downstairs was packed so we headed upstairs where a tiny, four-person bar awaited us with two empty seats.  After deciding on a glass of Roederer (my favorite pre-dinner drink) and a beer for S we were left to people watch.  As I mentioned before, the space is incredible although upstairs it felt a little cramped.  Every table was full of diners which meant that the wait staff had to continually try to navigate around themselves which was difficult as the main thoroughfare running the entire length of the upstairs restaurant was an aisle wide enough for only one person.  This was why it wasn't entirely surprising when an entire tray's worth of food ended up on the laps of two guests who had been previously enjoying their meal.  The staff was right on top of it but there was no discounting the fact that that would be the most memorable part of their meals and not the food. The hostess arrived to escort us to our table but had to quickly bring us back to our seats at the bar when she realized it wasn't quite ready.  The oh-so-charming bartender quickly refilled our glasses given the great inconvenience we had just faced (me being cheeky) especially since we had to continue waiting at the bar for, get this, 5 whole minutes!\nShortly thereafter we were brought to our table which faced a private dining room that in addition to tables also housed a pool table (I'd like to sit there next time).  Warm popovers and butter were brought to the table before our starters and I could have stopped there.  I'm glad I didn't as the steak tartar was incredible; mixed with the raw beef was a mustard dressing, capers and crispy shallots which all combined to melt in my mouth.  While it looked like a dog had vomited on my plate (sorry but it's a perfect description for what I found staring back at me) it tasted delicious and will definitely be something I order again.  S's lobster looked delicious and came in grand fashion in a silver bowl topped with shaved ice which meant he was the envy of everyone in the restaurant.  \nThe main event was next; fried chicken for me and the burger for S.  Of course an order of macaroni and cheese and creamed corn were thrown in for good measure.  My chicken was out of this world - it came on what looked like a platter; deliciously fried chicken pieces with fried herbs on top which was a nice touch as many of the herbs could be tasted intermingled throughout the meat itself. The crispy coating was light but flavorful and is typically my favorite thing about fried chicken.  This chicken however was so moist and so incredibly flavorful that I daresay the coating was merely a vehicle for the tasty meat.  The creamed corn was incredible in its own right - made with no cream at all but an emulsified olive oil, it was sweet, silky and creamy all at once (I understand this is a seasonal dish and I'm so happy that we chose summer to enjoy it).  The macaroni and cheese was a great example of what good, simple cooking should taste like and was creamy and rich without being cloying or stringy. S's burger was described by him as being the best burger he's ever had and I'm sure it had something to do with the house made brioche bun - it looked divine.  Plus, if you throw grilled (or roasted I this case) onions on anything, S will consider it to be ten times better than without.\nAlthough it was a struggle, we decided to do dessert and chose the coconut cake which turned out to be a good choice.  It was lighter than angel's food cake but was so intensely flavored that one didn't miss the heft that comes with a good layer cake.  For the life of me I don't even remember the frosting which is usually a high point for me so it's pretty obvious I was smitten.\nWhile I had never been a huge Tyler Florence fan before I can now see why people are so over-the-moon about him; he's elevated simple, country cooking to fine dining without the stuffiness that usually comes with it  and I can appreciate his sense of humor. I can't wait to return to Wayfare Tavern and already know what I'll be ordering: steak tartar and fried chicken on the side please.", "author": "Erin H."}

I've been there for food three times now and have loved every bite.\n\nRestaurant has a great friendly vibe.  The bartenders always remember patrons and quickly pour you a drink while you're waiting for a seat at the bar.  Gavin stands behind the oyster bar and shucks at a million miles an hour while turning out a beautiful plate of delicate oysters with just the right finishing touches.  My personal favorite oysters are skookum bay and bearing pt but I also like plumper and less briny oysters.  I think the oysters at Wayfare are better than that of Hog Island or WaterBar.  It has to be neck to neck with Swan's Oyster Depot.\n\nThe fried chicken (juicy and well seasoned) was fantastic and so was the Mac and Cheese.  I also tried the Cobb salad with lobster (not on new menu) and the ingredients were top notch.  The only thing I would pass on is the Avacado palm salad (which is not on the Fall menu).\n\nDon't forget to try the popover bread that is fresh out of the oven.  They are so flaky and addicting.\n\nConclusion:  Wayfare Tavern is one of my favorite weeknight restaurants right now. Just don't expect to get a table by walking in.  It's a bit pricy but worth the money.  Great Service too.\n\nI love the fried chicken but the last time I was there, we cut into the drum and it was a bit red and undercooked on the inside and our neighbor sitting behind us had a similar situation so I'd just double check your food.

You'd think since we had to wait so long to be sat he'd be more attentive.  Ultimately the service was slow and inattentive.  He barely checked on us and we had to track him down twice to wrap up our leftovers and get the check.

If only his food gave me the same feeling.\n\nThis isn't a bad restaurant by any means, but a 5 star, pinnacle-of-a-celebrity-chef's-career restaurant... methinks not.\n\nWe got the much-lauded burger and fried chicken and were underwhelmed by both.\n\nFor the chicken, we got 5-6 small portions of meat (do they actually find miniature chickens for this?), and the breast pieces had been stripped from the bone and cut into 3 separate pieces, so they were more like overgrown nuggets.  I found the chicken to be surprisingly bland and dry.  I kept eating it, hoping for at least a tinge of what all the other reviewers have gushed over...but to no avail.\n\nThe chicken was positively blanketed with fried herbs, which is great if you had ordered a fried herb platter, but not if you actually wanted to taste the chicken. For $20+, they could at least throw in some sort of side dish, but the creamed corn was another $8. To say that this rivals Ad Hoc's is like saying that my junior high basketball team rivals the Lakers.\n\nThe ($18, mind you) burger was equally bland.  I've droolingly watched that burger episode of Tyler's Ultimate, so I was really thinking this one would be a home run.  But nope - Tyler bunted.  The meat wasn't well-seasoned, and I couldn't even taste the cheese.  The fries served with it hovered dangerously close to those potato stick snacks you get at Walgreen's - extremely crisp on the outside, but with no soft potato goodness in the middle.  I actually complained to my dinner companions that my fries were empty.\n\nThe creamed corn was fine and the mac and cheese was pretty tasty, but man cannot live on side dishes alone.  The tomato bread soup starter wasn't bad, though from a guy whose last name is Florence, I expected a true Tuscan bread-tomato soup, not a creamy tomato soup with two croutons tossed in.\n\nAnd you will rarely find me criticizing anything in the realm of dessert, but the pound cake with berries was so dry it made me cough.\n\nI don't mean to say that this is a bad restaurant, and I probably would have given it 3 stars had it not been for all of the Tyler hype, the profusion of incongruous 5 star reviews (are there two different Wayfare Taverns and I went to the wrong one?), and the price.  It was nearly $70 per person, including an undisclosed 4% Healthy SF surcharge (my pet peeve).\n\nI wanted to like it, but it just didn't live up to my expectations.

That being said, it was very good.  Here are our reviews of the food and atmosphere.\n\nFood:\nThe best thing, by far, was the popover that comes complementary with each meal.  While it's tough to mess up something that solely consists of a fat plus dough, this was spectacular.  Comes with a softened butter and olive oil spread.  Yum.

Solid cocktail sauce accompaniment.\nLobster Cobb - 5/5 - For what we thought was a pretty easy salad, this had a complex mix of flavors and texture.  Rich lobster, fresh tomatoes, corn and beets, and a great saltiness from the thickly diced bacon.  Soft boiled egg was a nice touch.\nFried Chicken - 4/5 - Not your typical 'fried' chicken, with the incredibly crispy texture.  This focused more on the tenderness and juiciness of the chicken.  My preference is a crispy exterior, but the chicken itself was succulent.  Comes with fried rosemary and thyme - best part.  \nChocolate Cream Pie - 5/5 - Great way to end the meal. Chocolate lovers would kill for this dish. Highly recommended\n\nAtmosphere- Really cool decor and feel to the place - like an old school, upscale tavern.

The bone marrow was a good portion and pretty scrumptious. The foie was also good (though I usually prefer it seared). Ours came cold, in a mason jar that night.  I found the combination of the roasted grapes, foie and roasted garlic on crisp toasts delish!\nWe sat at the chef's counter, which is fun to try at least once.  At the counter, you see some of the apps being prepared literally inches from you. Sitting here also made us aware that they had prepared our entrees too early. We saw the staff look over a couple times at us and then at our entrees, perplexed at what to do.  They ended up giving the lamb to another table but my fried chicken went under the heat lamps.  The lamb was done two ways -  a ragu and grilled, cooked perfectly med rare - both were delish.  The only disappointment was that when we flipped over the second piece of lamb, we realized, the originally perfectly cooked lamb was overcooked as the plate was so hot, it continued to cook. Oh well, it was still tasty.\nFried chicken is almost always delicious. So for me, what really sets apart good fried chicken (warranting $20+) from just okay fried chicken is whether or not the breast pieces remain moist.  Sorry to say, that wasn't the case with Wayfare's fried chicken.  It even prompted me to increase my review of another fried chicken place as I now appreciate it all that much more that their white and dark meat is always moist - and for 3 big pieces with 2 sides for $11 (a gem in the Dogpatch.)\nWe didn't get desserts but I will say, that all the ones I saw at other tables were gi-normous. \nOur server was just ok- not so attentive as 1, she didn't realize we were not even close to ready for our entrees and 2, took a really long time to come by and notice my wine glass was empty.  I ended up asking another server to help me. \nI once commented on Facebook (which I almost never do) as I was annoyed at Andrew Zimmern for his disparaging comment about Tyler. And then I got a friend invite from him (or at least I think it was him)!  He'll probably de-friend me after this review but I got to be honest.

Let me just say, even walking into the door I was amazed at how home-y it seemed. The decor reminded me of some country home in the woods. The deer heads didn't hurt either.\n\nWe sat down and were immediately greeted by our server. Our water came in Wayfare custom wine bottled - very ecofriendly - and the silver chargers on the table definitely brought to mind images of an English/Scottish tavern. We split an order of deviled eggs (so good with that crisp fried shallot on top!) and she ordered the mussels while I opted for the pumpkin ravioli.\n\nIt was like eating Christmas. The pumpkin filling was oh-so-creamy, and there were mushrooms, pecans and cranberries... the takeaway is, I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch. It was a little noisy due to the lunch crowd, but my coworker and I were both able to talk at a comfortable level and not have to shout to be heard.\n\nI think what impressed me most, though, was their attention to detail. Instead of putting your leftovers in a box and handing it to you, they give you a claim ticket. This way, you don't have an awkward bag/box taking up space while you finish up your conversation/enjoy some dessert/wait for the check. Then you give the hostess your ticket at the entrance and she sends you along your merry way with your (extremely) tasty leftovers.\n\nI absolutely loved my first visit here. Can't wait to go back!", "author": "Marie K."}

I adore Tyler Florence and was looking forward to visiting this restaurant since we booked our trip to San Francisco.  We walked a mile out of our way just to come here because I was so excited about it.\n\nWe got there at about 4:30pm on a Monday.  It was pretty slow, as the after work crowd hadn't yet arrived and it was still early for dinner.  We were looking to get a few drinks and appetizers.  We were dressed casually as we were touring, so we were in jeans and plain t-shirts--I think this was why our experience was so bad.  I felt that the host was pretentious and probably didn't think too highly of us because we weren't in business suits.\n\nWe stood at the door waiting to be seated for about 2-3 minutes.  Just to put this into perspective, it was not crowded.  There were about 5 people at the bar, 1 bar table and maybe about 3 tables in the restaurant occupied.  The host then walked over and said \"yes?\", not \"how can I help you\" or anything like that.  I said that we would like a table for 2 and that we would be having drinks and appetizers, and he said \"the bar tables are open.\"  Instead of either walking to seat us at one of the tables or asking if we had a preference, he just stared at me.  So I asked if we could be seated at one of them.  He pointed to the table, we sat, and the threw the menus on the table and walked away.  We waited for 10 minutes before anyone came over to us.  I believe that the only reason that someone even came over after the 10 minutes is because my boyfriend stood up, looking pretty angry, and walked toward the door.  At this point, a waiter came over and asked us if we would like a drink and if we wanted water.  As we observed the restaurant, other people who came in after got service more quickly.  Also, other customers were seated with menus and got water immediately, as well as bread and chips.  We never got bread or chips.\n\nI have to give a bad review because I have never been treated so poorly at a restaurant.  The host was flat out rude and pretentious, and we were completely ignored.  The waiter was not rude and once he came over he was slightly more attentive.  The food was pretty good and the drinks were decent (the spiced horchata was excellent, the watermelon mojito was ok, but didn't really taste like a mojito).  Unfortunately, my love for Tyler Florence and the good food and drinks could not wash the bad taste out of my mouth that I got from our terrible experience.", "author": "Victoria S."}

Food--not even ordinary.  Ambiance--great if you're looking for a hopping crazy, super-loud bar scene.  Pretty lame if you're paying Tyler Florence prices for dinner.\n\nHint #1: make a reservation AND be prepared to wait.  Don't expect to be seated when you arrive.  Oh, and if you're just one person, expect to be told to find a seat at the bar.  (Gosh, thanks.)\n\nHint #2: You know that woman whose high-pitched squealing laugh can be heard all the way up in Chinatown?  This is where she's sitting.\n\nHint #3: Be a celebrity, or a regular.  It's very clear that the greeters and wait staff have their favorites.  The rest of us are just tourists.  (Thanks again.)\n\nHint #4: I can't tell you what food to order.  I'm guessing that there are times, or situations, where the food can be really good--otherwise my best bud Yelpers wouldn't be so high on this place.  But I can also tell you that there are times--and I hit one of 'em--when the food doesn't measure up.  Best dish: creamed corn.  Asparagus: over-cooked, fat and mushy.  But the biggest crime was what got done to the Halibut.  Maybe that fish was sitting under the heat lamps as long as I was waiting for a table.  I *love* halibut.  I've never had a halibut that I didn't like.  Not until tonight anyway.  Not flaky, not moist, and not seasoned in any way.  OK it was flat-out bland, tasteless, dry and overcooked.  That gorgeous golden-brown flesh?  It *clicked* when you hit it with a fork.  Clicked.  As in--this *fish* makes a sound when you hit it.  (And no, that wasn't the \"sear.\")\n\nI suppose I should have said something to the wait-staff, but I had already been forgotten twice tonight--once for my table and once for my glass of wine.  Why bother?\n\nCount me as Not A Fan.\n\nThe place, by the way, was completely packed and absolutely hopping.  Clearly Wayfare is popular.  Especially as a bar.  Maybe even mostly as a bar.  But as a single-seat trying to eat a dinner ... this was a complete downer.  In walked in looking forward to one of the hottest menus in town.

Didn't have reservations but two seats were available at the chef's counter. We ordered the beef tartare and deviled eggs for appetizers, fried chicken and scallops for entrees. We also ordered a side of charred broccolini per the waiter's suggestion. The tartare was served with potato chips stabbed upright into the meat which forced the server to remove all the chips and set them on the side before mixing the egg into the beef. The dish was good, but a little under seasoned and not enough chips. The deviled eggs had an overwhelming taste of dijon mustard...so much that I could barely taste the egg. The fried chicken was decent but I might choose Popeye's over it if asked. The scallops were well cooked but oddly enough only one side was seared.  The restaurant itself was packed for a Monday night but not so unbearably noisy that you couldn't hear yourself think. The server was nice but I wouldn't take her recommendation of the broccolini again...it was too spicy and the cheese they sprinkled on top tasted bitter against the char.", "author": "C L."}

We both have been highly anticipating trying out this establishment and reading reviews on how it's Tyler Florence's restaurant made it even more compelling. Reservation was hard to come by, so we had to settle for a 5:15 PM reservation for a Friday (booked I think 2 days in advance?). \n\nIt's nestled in the Financial District, so based on the location and the time, it was expected to see a bunch of suits roaming the bar area. The restaurant has 3 floors I believe; we were seated on the main/1st floor in the back near the kitchen. We got a great view of the kitchen and the staff, but alas Mr. Florence was probably off opening another restaurant or shooting a show. Decor has a rustic feel, and their plates have \"Wayfare Tavern\" slapped onto them. That's cool... and ballsy... can't reuse these plates if Wayfare ever decide to close its doors or decide to change up the restaurant. \n\nAnyhoot... on to the food. We ordered the Steak Frites and the Wayfare Burger as entrees, plus Mac and Cheese as a side. For drinks we both went with the 22 oz. Hefeweizen. \n\nThe food came out in literally 5 minutes. Either the kitchen read our minds on what we wanted to order, the microwave was empty and ready to nuke as we ordered, or possibly because we were one of the earliest dinner tables and the kitchen staff is really THAT talented with making food. But seriously, the food game out so fast. From our seating I can see they do serious work in the kitchen. Every staff is moving at a frantic pace, and they seemed to have at least one person just there to \"clean\" the plates before they're being sent out. Now I know... nice restaurants do that... but this guy was meticulous. Homeboy could have taken out a toothbrush and scrubbed those plates down... \n\nSteak tri-tip cooked medium rare was perfectly cooked. Nice reddish pink at the center and so tender. It came with watercress and french fries. I tried a chunk of the burger, and it too was juicy and savory. The fries were standard fare... although the garlic aioli resulted in me completely annihilating the fries. \n\nBut the Mac and Cheese. Damnit... this was NOT Mac and Cheese.. it was Mac and Cream. Where is the cheese Taylor? You gotta put some cheese in the Mac and Cheese man. And cut the heck down on the cream... eating it felt like a heart attack. And add some truffle oil on that establishment... I know you got some truffle oil in the kitchen... less cream, more cheese, and a dash of truffle oil! \n\nBesides that, everything from the atmosphere to the food to the service was splendid. So does the place really deserve 3 stars due to the lackluster Mac and Cheese? No. But you lose a star for charging $19 for a burger. Even in SF that is a little steep.", "author": "Kevin L."}

For the mains, they looked great but could have been just a tad warmer as they seem to have sat a touch long waiting for Tyler's blessing before serving.  We also ordered a side of potatoes the could have been warmer.  it seemed as though Tyler was more concerned talking with customers, checking his email and IMs on his new 4G iPhone than timely working the pass and getting food out in a timely manner.  To finish, we had the enough to feed a village Peach Pie with goats milk ice cream.  While tasting great, our expectation is that the pie would have been warm to compliment the outstanding ice cream, rather than room temperature.\nService was very attentive and the wine we ordered matched very well with our food.\nOverall, quite good food and entertain time while watching the staff cook in such a small space.

Maybe because TyFlo was not on the line that nite?\nI must say they did acknowledge our friend's bd since I had alerted them-with a card signed by TF waiting on the table.  But then it went downhill.\nFirst off we ordered 2 app's: steak tartare and the octopus.  We deliberated on the fried oysters and decided against them, while the server was standing there-but they still showed anyhow.  Didnt want to make a big scene in front of guests so just kept them. Apps were meager-sized esp the octopus, and none of us raved about any of them.  \nServer was fine, doe-eyed and all business, forgot about husband's allergy which we mentioned several times to her-which I find annoying.  I know they have several tables, and we aren't trying to be difficult and make subs, but if you could just alert us if there are those particular ingredients, it would be appreciated/(he will stop breathing).\nI ordered the fish, Halibut, but that evening they had to switch it to sturgeon.  Fish was nicely cooked but was served in an unappetizing looking white sauce with (un)colored (bitter) root veggies, I was far from excited to dive into my plate.  That's right: a bland looking piece of fish in a white sauce.  Not even a speck of some green parsley to spruce it up.  Tasted like it looked-I was beyond disappointed, TF.  I would have rather had our friend's agnolotti-and btw he was the only one at our table of 4 who was saying they loved their meal.  The pork loin my husband tried was meh also.

No problem there. We sipped our cocktails and chatted for about fifteen minutes. We were ushered inside when our table was ready. Three of us ordered the signature dish of herb fried chicken. We all agreed that it was moist and delicious. The serving was far too generous, it turns out. A platter of the chicken and then a platter of vegetables could have served all three of us. Which causes me to mention that the chicken dish is a la carte; maybe I hadn't read the menu's fine print. There wasn't so much as a sprig of parsley served with it.

We had the beet appetizers which were fantastic and perfectly presented.  Our entrees were the Fried Chicken and Braised Ribs.  The chicken was moist, deliciously seasoned and had a lot (and I mean a lot) of white meat.  The braised ribs over mashed potatoes were delightful and perfectly cooked.  Dessert consisted of the fried apple pie (which was dry and only okay) with a dolup of sage ice cream which was suprisingly refreshing.  Overall, the food was very, very good and perfectly cooked.\n\nHowever, I must say beyond the stunning decor, the ambiance of the place was overwhelmingly lacking.  The staff seem overwhelmed by the crowds in the bar and the small entry fills by guests. The waiting area is virtually non-existent.  Even with reservations, we waited and felt trampled by the constant coming and going of bar patrons or diners.  While I understand piped music in the bar, I don't understand why it has to be piped upstairs in the dining room.  With the noise of the diners, the extra piped noise made it very difficult to hear and sustain a conversation without yelling or making your neighbors unhappy.\n\nAnd speaking of neighbors, the seating is so extremely close to each other that it was rather uncomfortable.  All through dinner, I could hear the date next to me and the family on the other side, so I was competing with those levels to have my conversation with my partner.  It's so close that the waiter cannot get in between the tables to serve the guest that sits against the wall. They had to stretch over my shoulder to reach the table.   \n\nSo this is the main reason for 3-stars.  Go for the food but don't expect much from the ambiance.", "author": "MJ H."}

It would've been nice if they would've helped us form a table at the bar as people were to leave. So, with 7 girls, we just ordered a bunch of food at the bar area and made the best of it. Luckily, the food made up for the unpleasant greeting from the hostess. Must try: Steak tartare, Poutine, jedori eggs, raw oysters, Uni toast, scottish salmon, wild mushroom grits, crab salad, burger le grand (with the egg!). I would say, pass on the Duck gumbo unless if you're still hungry. For desserts, the chocolate hazelnut is a must, but the Apple cobbler is a bit too sweet (coming from a sweet tooth gal). I would given this place all 5 stars if the initial experience at the door was better, but it is what it is. :D", "author": "Samantha C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-12-21", "description": "Nothing short of ridiculously AH-MAZING. I had heard that Tyler Florence owned a restaurant in San Francisco and shortly after found that it was the Wayfare Tavern on Sacramento. I didn't even know, even though I had eaten next door at Wexler's. \n\nWell! I soon found out that I had been missing out. I tried to make a reservation on Open Table-booked for that entire night (I later found out that sometimes it can take up to a month to find an available reservation). However, my boyfriend and I were set on eating at Wayfare THAT NIGHT. We stumbled in from the rain and it was PACKED; we proceeded to ask how long of a wait it would be: 2 hours. Instead of moaning and groaning about the wait, we hoped for the best, thinking we might score a table in the front bar area, which is first come, first serve. So we moseyed on down to the bar; I ordered a signature cocktail, The Leidesdorff and GC ordered a dirty Grey Goose martini. My handmade drink with bourbon, orange, egg white and a few other ingredients was absolutely lovely, as was the gracious bartender. After finishing my first drink, what did I see, a group of people preparing to leave from a table behind us! We quickly stood by to claim our territory among the other hawks. \n\nAfter the group had cleared, we sat down and our table was promptly cleared, cleaned and set. We looked over the menu, even though we had already scoured it online and ordered the following: \n\nAppetizers: \n\nDevils on Horseback \nPoutine \nOysters \n\nMain: \nOrganic Fried Chicken \nCabbage \nMac n Cheese \n\nOur server brought out each plate with the utmost attention to timing between dishes. She was also very good about making sure our drinks were full! I wish service was always this good!!! Now, the food...wow. The oysters, fresh, creamy and delicious. The mignonette they came with was fantastic also. The poutine was french fries, covered with truffled cheese and braised short rib meat....to die for. The rib meat was succulent and flavorful and the truffled cheese was amazingly complimentary. The devils on horseback, very very good also, but not as stellar as the poutine in my opinion, however, still great. It could just be that dates aren't my thing, because I felt that even with the bacon, the dish was just a tad too sweet for me. Don't get me wrong though: they were very good, it's just that everything was SO good, it's hard to compare. Let's say they were the least spectacular-that's the only way I can put it. \n\nThe main course we shared and we were glad we did. The portions are HUGE! The chicken came with about 5 large pieces of chicken! The sides could have fed 3 people each. The chicken was probably the best fried chicken I have ever had...crispy and mildy spicy breading with tender, juicy meat. The cabbage was phenomenal with the bacon..mm mm mmm. The mac n cheese was screaming also...rich, creamy, with a little texture from the garlic breadcrumbs and a little bite from the chives. I am definitely going to modify my own recipe to mimic Tyler's. \n\nDuring the course of our meal, my boyfriend asked our server if Tyler ever visits his restaurant and how often. She ended up telling us, you know what he's actually here tonight! My stomach dropped...I am obsessed with food...I am obsessed with Tyler's food...I am a religious viewer of Tyler's Ultimate. Oh-em-gee..he's flippin here. She says, \"I can send him over if you'd like.\" I think I just stared at her. Then my boyfriend proceeds to tell her that that would be great. I immediately become nervous and wonder what I should say when he comes over. Well, he never ended up coming over and my nervousness subsided, however, I was a little disappointed. Then immediately after I began to calm my nerves, our server says, \"Oh, he never came, let's go get him.\" And there it is again, my stomach has left me. My boyfriend and I were led to the open kitchen by our server and she walks in, taps him on the shoulder and I pray that he isn't mad! He turns around, steps out of the kitchen and shakes both of our hands with a smile. I ask him if I could \"be the dorky fan who wants a picture with him.\" He laughs and says sure. My boyfriend snaps one with my Blackberry (my new Yelp profile picture) and he angles his body back towards the kitchen. Thanks to the Leidesdorffs, I muster up the courage to ask, \"Tyler, I have a quick question for you, when you prepare your beef wellington, if I did not want to use Chateaubriand, what could I use as an alternative?\" What I thought would be a quick answer, turned into him telling me step by step on how to prepare a wellington using a pork loin. I have never spoken to someone with such deep passion for food and teaching. I listened intently and took mental notes. What a stand up guy!!! I thanked him and we left. I was ecstatic. \n\nMy experience at the Wayfare Tavern was a night to remember. I heart you Tyler.", "author": "E G."}

Although we did not have a full meal, walked in on a Friday night and snagged a spot right away at the bar.  As an old Rubicon patron, it was nice to see the bones and features of the place have been retained.  New details and sprucing up made it look like a little nip n' tuck versus a full cosmetic procedure.  I found the deer head hanging on the focal point wall a nice, charming touch, which set the lodge-y feel and retro vibe they are trying to capture.  The food, from the few plates we shared, were delightful, nicely seasoned.  Perfectly cooked and crispy delicious fried chicken--TyFlo ain't afraid of salt and we commend that! Surrounding the chicken was a generous confetti of an assortment of fried fresh herbs (rosemary, sage, among others).  Fleur de sel and lemon wedges completed the ensemble.\nThe foie gras served in a mason jar--so plentiful it could have served 3 people easily.  My only advice is that it should be noted on the menu whether it is a torchon, seared or cold--partly my fault for not asking but somehow I assumed it would be a medallion, seared and mouth-wateringly unctuous.  The grilled sardines were nice, fresh, briny and the lemon and herbs obliterated any of the undesirable fishiness.  Cocktails were prepared classically, properly, expertly and although the wines by the glass weren't a thrill, it served its purpose.  Will be back for a full meal there and July and already anticipating a great meal.  TyFlo by the way was in the kitchen, expediting and I will bet my lifesavers that the lighting was professionally studied and installed in the open area of the kitchen so that all the star-struck Food Network groupies could oggle at his cute-as-a-button-ness.", "author": "Angelo S."}

Especially with Tyler Florence's name I thought it'd be a for sure winner.  I called a week in advance to get reservations on Sunday @ 9:30pm.  I called the day of to see if there were any cancellations and they were able to squeeze us in @ 7:30pm.  NOTE: \"Squeeze\" though?  There were about 3 tables available @ 7:30pm and that was just on the 1st floor.  \n\nWe shared the Grilled Calamari starter and it was very tasty with lots of garlic.  I opted for the Fried Chicken, since my bf got the Burger and we shared the Creamed Corn.  Despite the mixed reviews on the chicken, I thought it was very good.  You can tell it was marinated in buttermilk because it was so moist and I loved that they garnished the dish with 2 lemon wedges, rosemary, and other delish green herbs.  It's better then my oven fried chicken!  The creamed corn was tasty with an almost (bb)q'ed flavor.  I had a bite of the burger and I thought it was out of this world.  It was so flavorful and hands down better then Marlowe's.  Fries were bomb!  \nFinally, we shared the Pineapple Upside Down Cake.  Since I'm a huge fan of Salted Caramel ice cream, the dessert had me at hello.  It was very sweet and the bf kept asking me is the cake supposed to be cold?  So it wasn't cold, but it was barely room temp - FYI.  \n\nGreat service from our waiter, Marty.  We wanted to check out the 2nd level since we could see they had a cool little bar.

The atmosphere is amazing, my boyfriend LOVED the stuffed deer on the walls and I liked the high ceilings and general ambiance.  When we called, they told us there was plenty of seating in the bar and if there was a cancellation we could get a table.   When we arrived, there was no available seating, so we stood at the bar.  The bartender came around to take our order, which I thought was a very nice touch!  I had a martini and my boyfriend had a Racer 5.  We were hovering to see when a seat would come available and an older couple snagged the seats I was eyeing, so that was annoying.  But, everything ended up being okay since a table opened 2 minutes later.\n\nWe had Stephanie as our server and she was wonderful!  She made great recommendations on food and wine.\n\nWe ordered the fig appie and loved it! \n\nFor dinner we shared the halibut, fried chicken and mac and cheese.  The halibut was my favorite and my boyfriend loved the mac and cheese, the chicken was also very good, but not the best fried chicken ever.   Overall, it was a good experience and we would likely come back!", "author": "Carolyn B."}

We reserved the billiard room upstairs and ordered a bunch of apps, like everyone else on here my favorite was the burger which could quite possibly be the best burger I ever tasted. The overall experience was great, our server was awesome, and Tyler came upstairs at the end of the night and introduced himself to everyone in our group. The only thing that's preventing me from giving 5 stars is that I found the liquor selection at the bar to be a lackluster.

I have been to quite a few places over the years and I decided to start with Wayfare Tavern since this is Tyler Florence's establishment. heard about this place for a while and I have always wanted to try it.\n\nI made a reservation for lunch on Open table app via iphone. no problems there! so far so good.\n\nwe parked at a garage a few blocks away near Chinatown. street parking would be difficult to find especially during the day.\n\n1. ambience: nice interior, elegant and  timeless design yet says this place is great for all ages. has 2 floors. my wife and I were seated upstairs on the 2nd floor. space is smaller than I'd like. had to let a few waiters walk by me as I left our table. Tables were far enough that you couldn't hear the other party's conversation. this is a good thing. noise level is quite loud that I had to speak very loud so my wife could hear what I was saying. I had to ask the waiter once or twice to repeat. lighting was good during the day. plenty of windows upstairs to see outside.\n\n2. service: Amy, our server was very good. not exceptional. she was pleasant and friendly. knew the menu fairly well and made recommendations on the oysters. it turned out her reccs were very good choices. our food came out in good order. she checked on use once or twice. she didn't seem overbearing which I liked. Tyler wasn't there that day so we were bummed.\n\nthe popover guy just came once to put one in each of our plates then never came back to ask if we wanted another one. that was the only disappointed thing. was already full from all the food but from the other reviews, popover were like the bread on the table.\n\n3. Food: lots of it! I don't think I have ever that full. for starters, we ordered steak tartare over the garlic toasted popovers and the raw oysters.\nthe tartare was the best dish of the meal. plenty of steak tartare which had an egg yolk in the middle. I highly recommend this if you like beef, raw that is!  oysters were fresh and chilled well. we ordered 3 types of oysters that were available. my wife loves oysters. we've had better at Hog Island oysters at the ferry building. for the entrees, I ordered the warfare \"le Grande\" burger and my wife ordered the Dunginess Louis salad. the burger and the fried chicken is what I kept hearing as their signature dish there. I just couldn't get myself to order the fried chicken at a fine establishment. I mean, come on. so I went with the burger. cooked to how I  liked it, medium. tender and juicy in the middle and pink but not raw or bloody. wayfare's food is in large amounts and the burger is no exception. a huge egg on top with mayonnaise and bacon with brioche bun. over a thousand calories? you betcha. very messy but oh sooo good. my wife loved the salad. they serve thousand island dressing with it but my wife asked for it on the side. she said the dressing wasn't necessary.\nI had a Pilsner with my burger and went well together. \n\n4. Price: pricey. ended up spending over a hundred for lunch. we had lots of food though. a great choice for a business lunch or a special event.\n\nOverall: 4 stars out of five. will look forward in making another visit!", "author": "Milton C."}

We had a reservation for 9pm but didn't end up getting our table until 9:30pm - we were cramped at the bar for that 30 minutes, clearly in the way of the wait staff & people sitting at the bar which was really uncomfortable. There is not much room to wait at the front of the restaurant.\nBesides that, I really enjoyed the food. Definitely comfort food! I had the Ricotta Ravioli which was earthy and delicious. It was rich but the portion size was perfect.  I also enjoyed the popovers which were something I'd never had before and were a nice change from the typical bread you get before a meal. I also tried the mac and cheese which my mom ordered with was also very rich - good but not the best I've ever had. The biggest let down of the night was the peach pie. I went in there having heard from my friend that she read reviews that it was the best ever. I found the top crust so sugary that it was hard to eat  and this is coming from someone with a major sweet tooth. And then the filling was cold inside, I'm not sure if this was intentional or if it was just cold. The best part of the peach pie was the goat's milk ice cream it was topped with!  My friend ordered the Chocolate Story which is a chocolate pudding & it was to die for!\nOverall, the food was good and the restaurant is beautiful. Our server was a little slow but not terrible.

The food was good. I had the fried chicken which had excellent flavor, but just a tad bit too much salt. Everyone else seemed to think their dish was just ok. Two of the others had the halibut and two ad the steak. \nThe prices were expected considering we were in the restaurant of a food networks star, not outrageous, but more than I'd normally spend on fried chicken. The staff was S-L-O-W. It took 10 mins to come by and give us water, about 20 mins to get our order and about a half an hour after that we finally got our food. It wasn't really all that busy either. The waiter never came by a second time to see if we wanted anything else to drink, and come to think of it, he never even came by after to food was served to see if everything tasted good, or if we needed anything else. After our meals we sat around for another 10-15 mins waiting for the check. I've had better service at Mel's Diner.\nThey only get 2 stars because Tyler smiled and winked at me, and because the macaroni and cheese is seriously something from sent from the heavens.

Turn of the century 20s vibe. Think SF saloon/ lodge. They also have an open kitchen so you can watch Tyler and team preparing meals.

They asked if we'd prefer a counter or booth seat and, knowing my mom is a big Tyler Florence fan, we opted for the counter, which overlooks the open kitchen.\n\nWe had the two stools on the end, near the stairs down to the restrooms, so they weren't the best seats.  There's a small servers' station right by the last seat so it's a little distracting.  The stools weren't the comfiest seats either, and they seemed a touch far back from the counter.  But, it's always fascinating to watch a kitchen, though, and the attention to detail Florence was putting into approving each dish was charming.\n\nWe started out with cocktails (Dutch Plum Shrub and Occidental Sour), both of which were tasty, if not spectacular.  We split the bone marrow and Oysters Rockefeller. The marrow was really good; the oysters were okay, but I'd probably not order them again.  Dinner was fried chicken and creamed corn for me and the sirloin and fries for my mom. The fired chicken was so good. For a fried dish, it was surprisingly light, with just-right tastes of lemon and herbs. The creamed corn was fab as well.  My mom's steak was tasty, if not a little on the chewy side, but perfectly medium-rare. The fries were very good as well.  Dessert was pound cake with cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, berries, and Cabernet sorbet for me and the coconut cake for Mom. The pound cake and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche were a great combo, though I could have done without the sorbet and so many berries (though there was nothing wrong with them...I just thought it was a little much). My mother loved her cake and the small bite I had (we were stuffed!) was good.\n\nOur server was a doll, but the service was very, very slow.  Now, I know this is their first week open, so I'm willing to let it slide and try again (and I know it takes about a year for a restaurant to totally find its groove), but they need to work on getting things out of the kitchen a lot faster.  Our meal lasted over three hours for three courses.  \n\nOn his way out for the evening, Florence came over and introduced himself and shook hands with everyone sitting at the counter.

There were four of us, and we ordered a lot of different things, and everything was absolutely, positively delicious. I will be dreaming of the steak tartare and the chicken liver mousse for some time (no this is NOT light cuisine - but it's soooo good).  Food is 5 stars in my book, no question.  Everything else was 2 stars at best.  Service was slow and inefficient (though friendly) - we had to scream out to people multiple times for assorted things and finally asked that they just leave the wine bottle on the table so we didn't have to wait so long for refills - unacceptable at that price point. And the atmosphere was unpleasant - so loud and crowded.  It's small and furnished with big, heavy furniture (lots of dark wood - food and decor both are tavernesque), and there are people jammed in everywhere - lots of jostling.  I don't mind a little energy or noise, but this was simply too much.  The entry way is an absolute madhouse; they really need to do something about it.  It took a full eight minutes to even check in with the hostess.  Maybe have one of the hostesses walk around and see who has reservations and assist them first, and politely ask those who don't to step aside?  I know it's unlikely that a restaurant would ask someone to leave, but having people milling around in a tiny space, in hopes of getting a table in an hour, ruins it for everyone.  It has to be fixed - it is an incredibly bad way to start an evening.  And unfortunately the chaos continued throughout.\nI will try it again because I loved the food so much - maybe for lunch, definitely never again on a Friday or Saturday night.", "author": "Ellen H."}

For some reason or another I never posted this until today. I have been here since then and the kinks were worked out and Wayfare Tavern has turned into a spot I recommend to everyone.\n7/11/2010\nI came here last night with a friend to sit at the bar and try some appetizers. Walked in around 8pm to a full house. The bar was two deep which means like 12 people were trying to get a drink at the same time. Luckily I knew one of the barmen who acknowledged me so I didn't wait long for a libation. \nWithin 10 minutes all the people that were waiting at the bar sat down for dinner and so my buddy and I took a few spots and asked for menus. It looks like they are doing a take on classic continental cuisine as I saw many dishes in the starter portion were items such as baked avocado, deviled eggs, steak tartare, hangmans fry and such.\nWe tried all of the above items as well as the watermelon salad, The foie gras and the grilled calimari. I found most of the dishes pretty good with the exception of the steak tartare which was probably the best I've ever had and the grilled calimari which definitely wasn't.\nThe steak tartare was of good size, well seasoned and light and delicious accompanied with the wood oven roasted bread ( slightly charred) while the calimari was rubbery, bland and seemed to be missing something.\nThe cocktails were crafted quite well however the wait was a tad long. I feel tjat once this place hits it s stride and irons out some service kinks it will definitely deliver a top notch product. I look forward to going back.", "author": "Bill H."}

Granted, it was a Friday night, but good luck trying to eat or drink without a reservation.  Luckily, I was by myself and snagged a bar seat overlooking the kitchen.  Waitstaff was great, especially given how packed the place was!  I ordered the smaller portion of the steak tartare (still huge, especially for just myself), roasted beets and ricotta (fine, pretty standard fare), and macaroni and cheese (a huge portion!).  The food tasted great.  It was typical California food without anything that stood out in particular, just done very well.  Wanted to try the bone marrow and foie gras appetizer, but I couldn't be too greedy.  The Pisco Sours I had were good, but for $10 a pop, I should've waited until after dinner and walked a few blocks over to the Rickhouse which has cheaper drinks.  I want to come back to try more of the menu, but with crowds being the way they are, I wouldn't really want to subject too many people to committing to eat here.\n\nEdited to add: In response to Anne A.'s review, you are not crazy.

As an aside, what an awesome way to experience this restaurant since he is such a big foodie and knows so much about Tyler Florence. \n\nWayfare immediately started off on the right foot by sending over fresh made popovers instead of bread.  I love a place that starts with a good popover. It is so unique and these popovers were particularly tasty. \n\nAs apps, we ordered the Poutine and Scottish Salmon and both were excellent. My only criticism of the salmon was the potatoes were undercooked, but totally forgivable given the awesomeness of the dish. The Poutine was to die for! \n\nFor our mains we shared the Fried Chicken, Crab Louis Salad and the Chicken Salad.   Of the three, my favorite was the Crab Louis. The smokiness of the bacon, coupled with the lightness of the crab was perfection.  While the chicken salad was very interesting with mint and watercress as the main greens, it just didn't stack up against the fried chicken and the crab louis. \n\nWe also shared a side of Mac n' Cheese and the bechamel was so rich and creamy...one of the best I've had. \n\nIf all this food wasn't enough, we also split the Sticky Toffee Pudding and again, just really good. \n\nI can't wait to come here again and neither can my colleague...", "author": "A T."}

We started out with the organic roasted beets & quinoa--WOW--if you like beets, do not miss this excellent dish!  The deviled eggs were nothing special; rather dull.  For a main dish, the branzino was okay (but the veggies with it were perfection).  Nice selection of wines by the glass, including Cold Heaven viognier.  We finished off with the pineapple upside down cake, which is nice and dense, but the best part of the dessert is the coconut ice cream, which is perhaps the best ever.  Service was excellent and attentive.  As I said, we'll be back!", "author": "Litta R."}

I have to say that although the fried chicken was delicious, it is not fried chicken in typical sense.  It's very moist and the fresh herbs give it great flavor.

Anything that has meat, bacon, or is fried is likely to be fantastic. \n* Caufliflower soup - super tasty but more than a little cream\n* Beet salad - good but it didn't need the heavy aioli beneath it (but since all dishes on the menu need a saturated-fat element, I understand it)\n* Sardines - the only miss of the night. Fishier than I'd like, poorly deboned, and the plate was kind of an unappetizing disaster after the server attempted to debone it.\n* Burger - expensive but tasty beyond your dreams. (topped with a huge slab of brie, some bacon, and some tasty caramelized onions)\n* Fried chicken - essentially an orgasm at the table. I'll never enjoy it anywhere else after tasting this. Seriously - please try this and tell me I'm wrong. And squeeze lots of lemon on it while it's hot.\n* Mac n Cheese -- we ordered this for my 6 year old daughter but she didn't get to eat very much of it. It was incredibly good. Beyond good. Everyone at the table was in shock.\n* Deviled eggs -- Best. thing. ever. (If you go for this kind of thing)\n* lemon/blueberry cream puffs - Why were we ordering dessert after such a cholesterolfest? Because we could. And the creampuffs were outrageous.\n\nWe probably had like 5 other dishes that I'm forgetting because my arteries just seized up afterwards preventing my brain from functioning.\n\nYou can't eat this stuff very often. It's really really heavy food. There is bacon in almost every single item. But the preparation is so well-done -- it helps you remember how these dishes are supposed to be made.\n\nSome knocks:\n- Our server was \"fine\". She was clearly not their A-team.\n- I watched the kitchen and certain things we ordered sat on the counter way too long before being delivered, so they weren't terribly hot. This even though we asked for everything to be brought to us as soon as it was ready.\n\nWe were there for lunch, with kids, so we didn't try the cocktails or wine list, so I can't comment on that... \n\nEat here now.

(as for the rest of you out there, I don't want to eat risotto with asparagus, mushrooms or butternut everytime I go out-if that's your one veggie option you have not satisfied your obligation, much less been creative).  The butter content of the sauce made my heart race in the best kind of way.  The ravioli had just enough cinnamon to add depth without making the dish taste like cinnamon.  Excellent.\n\nThe table split desserts-the apple cobbler, flourless chocolate cake and sticky toffee pudding.  All were really delightful, but a spoonful of date (from the sticky pudding) and ginger ice cream stole the show for me.

Yes, the popovers are delish and a great way to settle into the atmosphere.\nChef Florence was impossible to miss in the open kitchen, and the entire crew seemed to quietly work together without any stress.  I love steak tartare and ordered a half portion, while G couldn't wait to dive into her fresh dungess crab salad.  My grilled calamari arrived simultaneously so I switched over to the hot dish to savor its flavor.  The mix of garlic and chili in a lusty sauce had the perfectly grilled squid popping my taste buds.  G ate every leaf of her salad and finished her meal with a slice of fried apple pie with sage ice cream.  I tasted it and found the crust rather heavy and doughy but I give high marks for the imaginative treatment of an old American standby.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-05", "description": "So the food was great, but the night started off very strange. My date and I started with our usual martinis at the bar before dinner, but didn't bother ordering another. Sorry to say this, but the woman bartender didn't make the best martinis. First of all, the bar layout was a little odd. There was a huge pillar blocking the distance between us and our bartender serving us drinks. Our bartender could hardly reach over to hand us our drinks. Not a HUGE deal, but whatever you do, don't sit at the corner of the bar where the pillar is. \n\nThis is another thing..while waiting for our table, the entire bar smelled like wet rags or something foul. I can't imagine what the guy who was having a full meal was thinking..or smelling! In addition, the bartender asked me to pass her the dirty dishes and used cocktail glasses because she couldn't reach them and didn't walk around the bar to clean it herself. I promise, I am not a PICKY customer and I don't mind if you ask me once, but twice? Not the best service or impression for a first time customer.\n\nHOWEVER, when we finally sat at our table, and entirely different experience...in a great way. The bread-like croissant to start with was probably the best bread I've ever had as a starter. It was light, fluffy and warm. For our appetizer we had the half lobster, which was fresh and delicious. Surprisingly I chose to have the Bratwurst for my main entree with sides of brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes. The bratwurst was really good and tasty. I believe it was on top of mashed potatoes as well, but I didn't bother eating the potatoes on my plate because  the side dish I ordered were so much better. Either there was garlic in it or it had an abundance of butter, either way the flavor was heavenly. My date had the friend chicken and was very pleased with it as well. It wasn't overly greasy and he almost ate the whole thing! The service at our table was wonderful and I was really pleased with the food. I would recommend this place.", "author": "Reese L."}

The restaurant offers two levels with the lower level having an open kitchen for patrons to look into.  Everywhere sat people who were ready for a good night and they all seemed happy.  We sat upstairs and the decor is very much like an old school tavern and a bit like Bourbon and Branch which has the library.  They have cloths for napkins which kind of goes hand in hand with the tavern feel I think or like those French bistros.  \n\nOnto the food.  We ordered several appetizers and sides to share.  Shisho peppers, grilled calamari, sardines, avocado and hearts of palm salad, and chilled roasted beets.  All dishes were fantastic and very filling.  At this point the four of us thought we should cancel one entree but decided not to.\n\nFor entrees we ordered leg of lamb, steak and eggs, fried chicken, and hang town fry.  The leg of lamb was sliced into pieces so if you're looking for a whole leg you will be disappointed.  Since the gf couldn't finish her dish the hang town fry, I barely touched my lamb and helped her out.  Initial bite on the lamb was it was too salty.  The hang town fry, known as the dying man's last meal, well, I think you may die because it's so heavy.  I think this was the most disappointing dish just because of how heavy it was.  There were eggs, cheese, bacon, potatoes, and oysters.  I don't care for oysters and everything combined together was just too much.  The steak and eggs were two small pieces of filet with two perfectly cooked eggs on top.  I had a bite of it and the one bite I had was DELICIOUS.  And then the fried chicken.  This I think was the best entree of all.  Perfectly fried, not too crunchy but juicy, soft, and seasoned with herbs and a bit of lemon, gave me the feeling of summer in San Francisco when biting into it; perfect weather, not too hot or too cold, walking down the Embarcadero without a single care in the world.  When I bit into it, it was just perfection, just what I would want from a piece of fried chicken.  For dessert, we all shared the pineapple upside down cake.  The salted caramel ice cream and pineapple cake were decent but nothing to rave about.  Perhaps I was too full or perhaps I had too much pineapple sauce in Hawaii to have any feelings for pineapples.  \n\nBefore I forget, their pop overs are great!  Hot, extremely well made, and I think better than the one at Neimans.  \n\nService was attentive.  Waitress was on top of everything and was happy to explain everything on the menu.\n\nI don't care too much about whether Tyler Florence was there or not because he probably wouldn't be cooking and I don't know much about him.  I am happy that he opened a place in SF.  I really enjoyed my dinner not only because of the company but because the ambiance is fantastic, the service was excellent, and the food was fulfilling.

The mains were great, and while I thought I could use more choices, really there was enough variety.  The portions are hearty and presentation is casual.

As soon as I heard he had a restaurant opening in SF, I knew I had to come. I'm happy I had a client lunch as a reason to try this spot out. I've read and heard so many reviews about his fried chicken that I decided to try something else to see what else he had to offer. So I ordered the salmon. Let me say, I am not a huge fan of salmon. I mean, I like it, I cook it at home but it's not my favorite fish, so if I could be wowed with salmon, then I knew Tyler was onto something. Boy was I wowed. The salmon was tender, moist, cooked medium rare (which I didn't even know a fish could be cooked medium rare) and served with buttered whipped potatoes (yum) salsa verde and sea beans. I was blown away. If I could recreate this at home, I'd eat it almost every day. The popovers are also very good. I'm not a huge bread person but they were quite tasty. If you are a bread or popover person, you'd be pleased. For anyone who hasn't eaten here yet, go. Go now.

All I knew about this place was that they served mac and cheese you yelpers say its good. We got there and were given a HUGE table for two that was no big deal but I felt really weird after we looked at the menu. NO LUNCH choices.The meals were all around $20 and were beef and seafood based and I didnt feel like fried chicken. So we decided to have a side of mac and cheese and a side of roasted baby carrots.Yes our meal totaled $20 but the mac and cheese was so good we ordered two. It ended up being a perfect meal. I was the only one who liked the carrots but a whole side was too much. The brioche they give you to snack on is really fabulous. We ended up asking for another one for each of us we were happily accomodated. All in all this is a great place for dinner but not two people looking for a light lunch.

So when I spotted Wayfare Tavern, which is owned by one of my absolute favorite foodnetwork chef Tyler Florence, I knew I HAD to go. \nI made reservations via opentable, damn this place is busy! No tables were available from 6-9pm for good two weeks. So I booked for a 9pm on a Sunday night, hoping it won't be a madhouse. Plus parking would be a breeze as I found a spot right in front :)\nI get there and the place is nowhere close to empty. Even on a Sunday this place was lively. We were promptly seated upstairs, but I must say the seating was quite cramped. I was hoping for a less noisier atmosphere, but with about a foot of distance from each table it was hard not to ignore other people's conversations (unfortunately I had to hear some dude sitting next to our table repeatedly use the words 'shit' and 'fuck'. thanks.)\nThe popovers were delicious! Warm and soft, ugh I wanted to eat more but I know that will just fill up my stomach. Ordered the bone marrow for appetizer. That dish is insane! Sheesh I never knew it can be serves like that. It comes with two crispy breads and two sliced bone marrows topped with italian parsley. You must must must eat with the parsley, the combination is AMAZEBALLS. They should include more srispy breads though...they were awful small to eat with all that buttery bone marrow.\nFor main course I had the Alaskan salmon. Mine was cooked medium, but I should of gotten medium rare, as I like my fish more soft and moist. Hate over cooked dry fish. blegh. \nAs a chocolate fiend I had to get the chocolate pudding for dessert. So rich and creamy, felt like very bite went straight to my thighs. And it was topped with small crispy chocolate balls - now those are what I call TASTY balls! You gotta taste for yourself, it's a slap in the mouth.\nWhen the bill arrives, they serve you warm, soft gingersnaps. MMMM gingersnaps. Perfect size, (about a half a dollar) perfect way to end your dinner. \nAs for the waiter, he was very nice and attentive the whole entire time, but he was pretty monotonous. Seemed like a guy who dealt with one too many disappointments. But who knows, maybe that was his good mood face.\nMy birthday is coming up, I think I will individually hint to my friends to take me there....unfortunately Tyler Florence wasn't there so hopefully I will catch him next time.", "author": "Chiaki N."}

Again, do I need to elaborate how great this place is??\nI came here with my friend V for her birthday. There were a ton of people at the bar for Friday happy hour. Luckily, we made reservations for an early dinner and were quickly seated. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive (well we are super paying for their service too). Additionally, I really liked the atmosphere. It was dark but classic; I kind of felt like I was at the Haunted Mansion in Disneyland.\nV and I shared an appetizer of half a dozen mixed oysters (Kumamoto and 2 others that I forgot). They were fresh and delicious, but of course expensive (we should have hit Waterbar before going to Wayfare). Of course we also received complementary popovers which were amazing.\nFor my entree, I got the grilled bone-in pork chop since I really wanted to try their spaetzle. The pork chop was thick and grilled medium, so it was juicy. My only con was that the pork chop was so hard to cut. The spaetzle and cabbage was really good and tasted just as great the next day.\nV got the fried chicken, which was definitely their signature dish. The skin was just perfectly flavored and crispy, which was not TOO crispy, and the chicken was moist and juicy. This was a definite must order, but the only con is that it doesn't come with sides. This dish was large since it came with 5 pieces.\nWe also ordered 2 desserts. V ordered the pumpkin pudding because she is insanely obsessed with pumpkin. Although it was pudding, it looked more like a cake and it came with cinnamon ice cream. She really liked her dessert. I got the Wayfare Tavern Chocolate Cream Pie, which was so rich and delicious. Anything made with Scharffen Berger chocolate is just heavenly, and their devil's food cake was off the charts! I couldn't really taste the salted caramel ganache, but this dessert is really there to highlight chocolate.\nYes this place is expensive but it was really worth it. For an appetizer, 2 drinks, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts, our total including tax and tip was $130, which is cheaper than a meal at House of Prime Rib with drinks and desserts. \nThis place is a definite must try and I would for sure go back again!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-17", "description": "I would give it 3.5 stars overall- good but not stellar.  \n\nMy friend and I came here for an early dinner on a Sunday evening. It wasn't full when we arrived at 5:15 but by the time we left, it was packed with people waiting.\n\nSo I thought Wayfare was good, not great, but has potential to be better.  The decor is very tavern-esque with dark wood, feels very masculine to me.  We sat upstairs where they have a small bar and mostly table seating.  Instead of bread they brought out popovers!  But Denise bit into hers and it was Not warm.  What a bummer!  If only they warmed it up, it would've been really good.  The butter they served with it was nice, creamy and salty.  The menu is good- good variety of things, lots of apps, seafood, different entree choices to satisfy any craving for downhome american type food- potroast, fried chicken, fish, fries, burgers, etc.\n\nFor appetizer we shared the poutine.  Wayfare's is served with braised shortribs, mozzarella cheese curds, gravy and shaved truffle.  Yum.  Overall I thought the fries tasted good and were crispy, lots of toppings, definitely on the heavy side, but my friend noticed that it wasn't hot when it arrived.  They serve in a little cast iron skillet which was only barely warm but the fries themselves were not warm.  The fries were amazingly still crispy, maybe that's why I didn't notice the temperature thing until she mentioned it.  We also considered the roasted bone marrow but skipped that.  If you're ok with the heavy meat, cheese, gravy, I would recommend trying the poutine.\n\nFor entrees we both ordered the fried chicken since we'd read raves about it.  The portion was generous so I ate less than 1/2 of my entree.  The chicken was nice and moist with a light and crispy herb crust.  It wasn't a thick heavy, super crunchy crust. It was an herb bread crumb crust served with crisped up herbs and lemon wedges on top (you had to order veg or sides separately).  I enjoyed the chicken but wouldn't say it's to die for.  It's definitely healthier and not that greasy, heavy-batter kind I grew up with.  I'm not sure I would recommend cuz it wasn't That good.\n\nFor a side we ordered the mac n cheese.  The menu said that it was made with jack cheese but the dish was super heavy.  Just Tons of heavy creamy cheese all over.  I had maybe 2 bites and was done. I wouldn't recommend.\n\nEven though we were both so full, we figured that we had to at least Try 1 dessert.  They had a bunch of things like a warm chocolate hazelnut cake (which would've been my go-to except I was chocolated out), sticky toffee pudding, apple crisp.  Again, a nice variety on the menu to satisfy different tastes.  We went with the lime pudding cake.  It was served cold with some buttermilk ice cream. It was kind of creamy like a cheesecake but not as heavy.  It had a nice lime flavor and was refreshing after a day of big eating.  I liked the buttermilk ice cream but really couldn't eat more than a few bites of the dessert. If you like lime, I would go for this one.\n\nGo again?  It wouldn't be My first choice, but I would go if somebody else wanted to go.  There were lots of interesting things on the menu to try and they do have room to improve.  But to drive up from Menlo Park to SF just for Wayfare, probably not worth it.  We didn't see Tyler that day, but an appearance by him would be a big draw. =)", "author": "J L."}

My lamb was good, but not the best I've had.  I love the lamb chops at Tamarine in Palo Alto.   Rest of the group had fried chicken, steak and eggs and the burger and all raved about their dishes.  For dessert, we all shared the peach pie and rosemary sugar and the chocolate pudding.  I didn't care for the chocolate pudding at all, but the peach pie with rosemary sugar and goat's milk ice cream  was heaven!   The service was stellar.  A couple people from our group visited Wayfare before and had the same server.  She remembered where they sat and even what they ordered.

The truffle scent and flavor was overpowering so I didn't really like the gravy... but that's just a personal preference.. The wedge salad was really good even though I'm not a huge fan of iceberg, the salmon vichysoise was really delicious and the fried chicken was prefect!

Good dish & presentation but I think I'll pass on the ocean flavor next time. The dessert chocolate pie was very good - unique design of whipped cr\u00e8me piping & rich (like expensive chocolate) pie filling and culinary crust. It was even too big for 2 people. But we had to force it down ourselves to not let it go to waste. Service for fancy place like this is always top notch - I even asked our server if Tyler was in the kitchen. (no, he wasn't). Side note on the host booth: we were 15 mins early for our reservation.  They said they are getting our tables ready, please wait by the bar - blah blah blah. This whole time, there was this empty table for 2 that we were staring at.

To top that off, the hostess gave me attitude for asking for an update after we waited for almost a half an hour.  40 minutes in to our wait they offered us a free drink, which was nice of them.  None the less, a business should book reservations based on how quickly/slowly they turn tables over.  Because of the ambiance, people are likely to linger in a joint like this, account for that and lose the attitude.\n\nThe food was really good and our server was just present enough to keep us happy and invisible enough to not really be a part of our experience.

Thought it was cool he's sharing one of his favorite things with his patrons.  \n\nAppetizers were ok.  We go the bone marrow, sea urchin, baked avacado, calamari, fries and mac & cheese.  My favorite was sea urchin (which is surprising, as I normally don't eat uni).  Calamari was also cooked very well.  The rest was just so-so, nothing special.  \n\nFor my main course, I ordered the Organic Fried Chicken.  Portions were generous as this came with 5 pieces.  My first bite, I was like \"wow, this is great\".  (this is the drumstick)  I chowed that down pretty fast.  Next piece \"ooo, what is this, how come it's so dry\".  3 of the 5 pieces were white meat and it is no where near the juicy texture the drumstick had.

Upon entering, the ambience was quite pleasant, bustling with aromas and Saturday \"busy-ness\". \n\nWhat was ordered were 2 appetizers - grilled calamari (nice garlicky flavor) and California Avocado with hearts of palm (nice refreshing dish - actually really good). \n\nEntrees ordered - Fried chicken (which was heavily reco'd by the waitress) and Pacific Halibut. Let me say that the fried chicken was \"hella good\". I likened the comparison to Roscoe's but with an upscale twist. It was not oily or greasy (like fast food) and the flavors - Ohmygoodness - with a squeeze with lemon (suggested personally by tyler himself as we were sitting at the chef's table), it was soo good! The halibut was fresh but lacked the flavors I was expecting compared to some other restaurant. \n\nDessert - The Peach Pie was highly reco'd again by our waitress but someone ordered the last one. Our second choice was the Pineapple Upside Cake - hmmm, nice combination of cake and vanilla cream. Just a tad sweet but hit the spot. \n\nOverall it was a good experience. The only negative was that we waited for about 30 minutes between appetizers and entrees. I know it was primetime (seated around 8:30PM) and finished approx - 10:15PM. I'm sure that'll be worked out...\n\nWould definitely go back! Enjoy!!", "author": "Warren T."}

For dinner, hubby got the 28 day aged ribeye and I got the ahi tuna carpaccio.  The ahi tuna carpaccio was delicious!  Thinly cut, fresh tuna topped with haricot verts, anchovies egg, and some greens.  Tons of flavor packed with every bite.  We also got the Mac and cheese...it had bacon bits in it and was very cheesy... Not my favorite Mac and cheese but that's just me. It was still good.

We didn't make any reservations, but the hostess managed to get us a tiny table, since it was still 5:30 PM, Sunday night. Apparently, this place gets booked up fast. The decor is beautiful, very stylish, with rustic personality. Good ambiance and service, but we were expecting a lot more from their Southern style food. To begin with, I ordered a bottle of sparkling water, Pellegrino, or Perrier, or Voss, which to my surprise they didn't have any!!! They have a bar, for God's sake!!! We were told that they make their own sparkling water, which tasted awful! We were served this kind of pop over bread that was kind of still wet and not totally cooked inside. Every time I tried to get a piece of it, my hands would get all gluey with wet dough. For the appetizer, we decided to share the burrata dish with figs and eggplant. (I love burrata, and I grew up in Europe eating a lot of it!). Unfortunately the one they served was terrible, unseasoned, totally bland... Tasted like nothing! We had to add salt and pepper to make it edible. The one slice of bread served underneath it all was too, too hard, almost impossible to break, and we were sharing it! The only good thing about this dish was the eggplant tapenade. I would also have preferred fresh figs instead of dry figs with the burrata, but that's just my taste. For the entree, we ordered organic fried chicken, but our waitress advised us to order something else with it , since they only serve the chicken, with nothing else!!! We then asked for the mac & cheese, and the Brussels sprouts as side dishes. The chicken was ok, good flavor, but they used whole peppercorns to season it, and for a couple of times, I turned all red after accidentally chewing them :) The mac & cheese was really good, rich and decadent, the way Southern food should be. The Brussels sprouts were the best I've ever tried, and that's basically why I'm giving 3 stars instead of 2 for this restaurant! These 2 side dishes actually saved our dinner! Overall, I would say that good ambiance is not enough to give a restaurant a good reputation. Something is missing here. The place has a lot of potential, but the food is disappointing and pricey... We spent $100 sharing an appetizer, an entree and 2 side dishes + a glass of beer.  For that kind of money, I would expect to be wowed.", "author": "Marcia C."}

Parked right in front.  We got seated immediately at an intimate table for 2.  The decor is like a cozy den/living room.  Lots of SF places have weird old decor, especially downtown, but this place has a little bit of that quirkiness, but with a modern edge.  Our server was Lane and he was awesome!  So helpful and very knowledgeable about the food and it's preparation.  Always nice to have a server who knows what he/she's doing.\n\nBack to the food...here's what we had: \n*Complimentary - popovers...mmmm so good, could eat a ton of these!\n*Bone Marrow appetizer \n*Organic Fried Chicken - buttermilk brined and partially sous vide served with crispy herbs and lemon and garlic\n*Smoked Pork Chop with roasted peach, marcona almond butter, fennel puree\n*Sides: Creamed Corn & Mac n Cheese\n*The Chocolate Story\n*Coffee: French Press\n*Wine: Pinot Noir & Viognier\n*Fresh Ginger Snaps with the bill!\n\nGreat wine list. Did all we could to not start licking the marrow off the bone.  The fried chicken was juicy and perfectly fried, crunchy on the outside and moist in the inside...nice touch with the herbs, lemon, and garlic too.  The pork chop...had so many elements and every bite was scrumptious.  On their own, the ingredients were good, but all together it was perfection.  I'm kiinda of a sauce girl, so I hate it when you run out of sauce with your main dish...but this one had plenty to go around and never ran out.  The creamed corn was not a heavy milky mess, but refreshing and light.  The mac n cheese was to die for...so good, also restrained from licking the plate again.  I was stuffed after this, but my husband couldn't resist the dessert temptation.  He got the Chocolate Story that is chocolate on a different level.  It's serious chocolate.  With the impressive french press coffee, it was a great pairing.  \n\nVery nice presentation of the restaurant and all of the courses.  This place is now in our top 5 of our favorite SF restaurants.  Service was great.  Food came out fast and tasted amazing...even though we were a late party.  My husband is a chef, so we are always looking for quality late night eats cuz he has a late schedule.  \n\nThe only ding that I had was that there was so much goodness on the menu, that I wanted to try everything.  Next time, I wanna try the oysters and calamari, and the fish entrees.  Can't wait to go back.  Great job, Tyler!", "author": "kim b."}

I both live and work in SF so it was a natural to check it out.  We had our department holiday lunch there last year for a group of 8. We got a private room and ordered off the menu.  I ordered the fried chicken which came boneless and was overwhelmed by the flavor of herbs.  It came with nothing on the side. I ordered the cream of mushroom soup as a starter.  The waiter came with a pitcher and bowl and as he poured it, he warned it was very hot.  This was December. Did he not notice NO steam coming from the soup? It was actually lukewarm at best. We were ahead of another party using the room after us and were constantly checked on to see our progress.  I was not impressed.  The group wanted to go again this year for our department holiday lunch.  I contacted the restaurant.  A group of 8 (only 8) now consitutes an event.  We were sent the menu which stated it would be served family style.  Our group was to pre-choose from the menu 2 starters, 3 entrees, and one dessert....a holiday party where there would be VERY FEW choices with a group that contains one total vegetarian, one vegetarian who eats seafood, and one person with multiple food allergies.  So, we said....NO.  I won't go there again.  Not ever.  Way beneath the hype.", "author": "Karen S."}

This review is specific to their Sunday lunch service which I believe is relatively new - they really need to step it up here if it's going to take off.  We arrived at 12:30 and during our 90-minute meal the dining room was at least half-empty, but still the food delivery was horribly slow - we waited at least 20 minutes between our appetizer and salad course.  The portion sizes were also surprisingly very disappointing - I often have the (excellent) ceasar salad which is usually large enough for at least 2 people to share.  On this visit the two of us each had barely a handful of lettuce and the dressing was very uneven as if the salad hadn't even been tossed.  The octopus came next after a long wait and was excellently prepared but again, a woefully small portion compared to prior visits.  Finally, the beer lines were all messed up and they had only 2 of about 6 drafts available; things happen but then the server explained they've been having the same issue for the entire 5 years they've been open!", "author": "Paula M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-08", "description": "I am a Smitten Kitten!! \n\nWhat: An amazing burger; delicious American comfort food; great service; a chance to swoon over Tyler Florence if your date is lame. :) \n\nWhere: Wayfare Tavern (in the old Rubicon space) \n\nI imagine that if I were a dude, this is how I would decorate my restaurant. The restaurant is decorated in dark hardwoods, and black and ivory wall paper. Iron-cast lighting illuminates the space and there are antler hangings on the wall. It is a beautiful, manly space; I felt in touch with my masculine side. :) \n\nThere is a mezzanine dining area and the downstairs has a bar with booth seating. \n\nWhen: July 3rd (in the mezzanine dining area) and July 4th in the bar area. \n\nWhy: \n\n1. Service: \n\na) July 3rd: My dates (a married couple) and I were very impressed. First of all, the rest of my party was late by half an hour. I was on time; apparently Tyler Florence is the only man that can make me break into a sprint to make sure I make a reservation. The hostess and server were not phased by my party's tardiness and stopped to check in on me as I waited. For the rest of the night, service was friendly and attentive. \n\nb) July 4th: At the bar, they serve you homemade chips as you drink! The dude I was with told the bartender his drink was \"icky\" and the bartender was very gracious. Meanwhile, I wanted to melt into the floor - I was so mortified. \n\n2. Tyler Florence: I have had a crush on this man since I was a wee lass watching him on the Food Network. Then, he moves to the Bay, opens a restaurant with delicious food and is dreamy and nice to boot. Poor guy, he took a picture with me while I was very obviously swooning like a giant dork much to the amusement of my married friends. \n\n3. Food: \n\na) Popovers: I am convinced these have crack in them, because I had three of them before our appetizer arrived. They kept disappearing down my throat, and a new one kept appearing on my plate. They were perfection: hot and airy, crisp on the outside, they melted on my tongue. \n\nb) Bone Marrow: I am not a huge bone marrow fan, but I have never understood why. What is not to like? I think this dish was well-executed, but bone marrow and I are just not meant to be. It's not you, bone marrow, it's probably me. \n\nc) Mac & Cheese: PERFECTION!! I love love Wayfare Tavern's mac & cheese. If I were Goldilocks, it was like I found the little bear's porridge, this was delightful: not too salty, not too cheesy, not too creamy, just the perfect blend of everything. I purported to \"share\" this dish with my companions, but they didn't have a snowball's chance in hell of eating any of this dish once it touched my lips. \n\nd) Burger: A blend of four different meats, smothered in creamy Cowgirl cheese and avocado, topped with grilled onions. Then, comes the bacon, perfectly crisp and salty in perfect contrast to the richness of the meat. Yes, this divine heart attack is wrapped in homemade brioche. I decided to go all out and threw an egg, prepared sunny-side up on top. When the simple creaminess of the egg yolk, mixed with my burger, I was blown my way. Revelations do come in burger form. \n\ne) Baked Alaska: I have never had one, so I felt compelled to order this. Trust me, I was not disappointed! I dived into a warm, fluffy meringue, that was caramelized on the outside and served a perfect contrast to the cold, rich chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream on the inside. The strawberry ice cream was especially delicious; it was both tart and sweet. Happiness is something this delicious on a hot summer night. \n\n4) Drink: \n\nWayfare Tavern offers a good selection of local wines and a menu of cocktails. I personally enjoyed the Bedrock Syrah (yum!).", "author": "grace c."}

The mixed drinks were fantastic.  My friend had probably the best martini I've ever tasted and I had the Darkness at Noon, with rooibos tea bourbon.  It was not a sweet drink, and heavenly.  I also tried another drink listed right below it on the drink menu and it was too sweet.  The only issue I had with the drinks is that service was really slow.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the calamari and mac and cheese.  We were told that the calamari was not being offered fried that night, so we opted for the carpaccio instead and we are glad we did.  This place is super crowded and definitely a work in progress as there are some kinks that need to be worked out.  For example, the mac and cheese came out with grilled calamari, even though we had told the bartender that we did not want the calamari grilled.  So it was a while before we got the carpaccio.  \n\nThe mac and cheese was just ok.  There was not much of a crust, and the mac and cheese was not very well flavored.  I still think that the mac and cheese at A5A is much better.  I would not have it again.\n\nThe carpaccio on the other hand was very good.  The meat was fresh and it was highlighted by some horseradish dressing (I believe).

Halfway through our meal, the busboy asked us if we wanted \"another popover.\" Seeing as we weren't offered one pre-meal, we accepted. Our server returned a little later to take another drink order and we requested another popover. She said \"yes\" but never brought them over. At this point we were a little annoyed, as we had been looking forward to this meal for a while. We finished our entrees and as she was clearing our table she smeared butter across the top, stared at it and walked away! She asked if we wanted dessert and seeing as we had only been sitting for 35 minutes, we decided to finish our glasses of wine before ordering.

Although it was loud, the dark interior was cozy, and service was good. I wasn't too impressed by the popovers, which were slightly cold by the time we received them, but wow - what delicious organic fried chicken (it better be, for $22!)! The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. My friends got the pork tenderloin, which was divine - so tender (there's absolutely no other way to describe it). The side of brussels sprouts we ordered in an attempt to health-ify our dinner was delicious, but also counter productive what with the thick greasy bits of bacon that gave it its wonderful flavor. Overall, the meal was solid, but I wouldn't call it one of the most amazing dining experiences of my life. Would I go back? Yep, I'd take visitors, but the prices, although reasonable, do not make it a candidate for regular dining (at least for one of my meager circumstances).", "author": "Emily C."}

We went to Wayfare on a Saturday afternoon. We sat at the chef's counter and were disappointed when we saw people other than cooks, walking in and out of the open kitchen -- handling food on the plates going out (no hand washing). For example, the hostess, after handling menu's, managing the hostess stand, and doing other tasks around tables, walked into kitchen, worked on the plates going out, handling food, rearranging cooked food, adding additional food components to plates as if she was at home. A Manager ( in a suit) walked in the kitchen, also over handling food on plates..... I don't think this is good practice... This happens at inferior restaurants all the time, but should not happen at a restaurant like this. We were disappointed that the kitchen is run like this.... Its unprofessional. Also,grab a cloth and clean off the counter surface between the front and back work areas. So, yes, we thought the food we ordered was good - but not great. We really aren't focused on price unless something is so obviously overpriced and there are some overpriced items on this menu. If you are accepting of non-cook staff using unwashed hands ---- over handling your food ---- then this review is probably meaningless to you. Other than this, the service was good and food is okay. We ordered safe options like Popovers and mac &cheese which were delicious. We were just disappointed to see the inappropriate food handling  ---- being fans of Tyler.

While dining at this establishment earlier today for lunch & seated at the bar, I witnessed three cooks without appropriate head covering, i.e. hats. which involved the fry cook, a young lady who was toasting bread and a young man who was manning the grill. The young lady, while cooking, grabbed a handful of some type of salad topping, hand not gloved, and threw it in her mouth. She then garnished plates using a spoon and proceeded to suck the garnish off her thumb only to then use her fingers & thumb to push the garnish off the spoon and onto the plate. The fry cook was drinking an iced beverage from a cup, no straw, which is a huge no-no with the health department. Another young lady who was directly in front making salads proceeds to crack two raw eggs on the side of the counter, leaving a trail of raw egg whites and behind her was a young man who sliced tomatoes in the same area as the raw egg whites. Shortly thereafter, another person sliced French bread on the same counter where the raw egg whites laid. HELLO...MAJOR cross-contamination. Extremely disappointed that Mr. Florence operates his establishment with such loose standards and has no regard for the safety/sanitation of his patrons. Doors need to be closed for a day so the staff can be trained on proper food handling 101 before the health department pays a visit and closes the doors for you.

However, when my dish returned the fish was hot, but the kale and corn were still cold. Side note, there was very, very little of this very inexpensive side; which may be why it couldn't stay hot. I didn't say anything, because I was hungry, and how many times can you send your dish back without looking like an a-hole. The dessert was amazing! They also served warm popovers, which were tasty.

I had the steak frites this past visit and the meat was cooked perfectly and the fries were delicious. Oh, the Mac and Cheese is really good too. Save room for dessert because they have a great selection. My friend had the chocolate cream pie, which was rich, but tasty and I had the steamed lime pudding. It was a lighter version of a key lime pie, but with a more subtle lime flavor. It hit the spot and wasn't super heavy after everything that I ate for dinner. The best part of my past visit was that Tyler Florence was working in the kitchen that night and when he left for the evening, he stopped at a few tables, one of which was mine.

Service was great. the restaurant looks beautiful. Tyler Florence also deserves all the praise in the world for all the local ingredients he uses here. \n\nBut. I feel like it was a little overpriced for what I got. I ordered the Steak Frites. This should be the easiest thing to execute but it was a terrible experience. I got it medium rare because that is what our server recommended. Well, when the food came out it appeared medium at best visually. It was tough and dry and difficult to cut and chew. What was worse is the steak knife they give you for this place. It's not ergonomically designed correctly. How so? The handle is too thin and round, so when I try to cut this leathery steak the knife just keeps spinning in my hand. What a nightmare of a situation! And what was up with the watercress? It was laid all over the top of my food. How am I supposed to eat something so big? Cut it you say? Well-- there's the issue of the knife. And number two, my plate is so full of food, how the heck would I cut it? Okay, I think part of why this dish was not so great was because it probably sat out way too long after being cooked which could first of all explain why the steak appeared visually to be cooked right but probably got overcooked by a heating lamp or something. this might also explain why my truffle butter had all but disappeared into the onion it was served in. I would have loved to slather that butter all over my steak. Thank god the fries were done right. \n\nin other news, the deviled eggs were tasty.", "author": "Davin A."}

First, I chose this restaurant because I am a fan of Tyler Florence's work. Also, this place is more casual than typical restaurants in its class--wooden tables, dimly lit tables, wooden chairs, and an air of \"Mr.Toad's Wild Ride\" themed decor. Our waitress was very attentive to our table, and suggested dishes that they were known for (e.g., deviled eggs, fried chicken). Also, our food only took approximately 10-15 minutes to arrive at our table! I ended up ordering the Sea Bass, which was cooked perfectly...delicate yet a thinly crisp skin topped with capers, sea beans (which were prepared perfectly), and lemon. I also ordered a side of the Mac and Cheese, because, really who could resist? It was definitely not complementary to fish, but was absolutely tasty and decadent. My family ordered the fried chicken and the burger. I sampled the fried chicken, and it was the best flavor I have ever experienced on fried chicken--although I prefer more crispy and thick texture on the outside. I did not try the burgers, although they looked delicious. For dessert, we shared the Chocolate Cream Pie. I must say, the salted carmel layer at the bottom complemented the Sharffenberger chocolate. The coffee was french-pressed, which is always a preferred method of experiencing coffee. I definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting to experience high-quality ingredients cooked to perfection.

The issue was that there wasn't anything particularly inventive or special, certainly not enough to justify this level of hype.  I don't need mad scientist molecular gastronomy to get excited, nor do I even want it, but \"high-end comfort food\" is a concept that is hardly new in SF, or even in Houston, where I live.

The service, however, was AAAAAAAATROCIOUS.  This is a restaurant in the heart of the financial district.  As one might imagine, it would be expected to draw a large number of \"business\" dinners, many of which last a long time due to the nature of talking shop while eating a good meal.  My co-worker and I had a 5:00pm Tuesday night dinner scheduled with the founder of our firm.  He was coming out to do the whole big picture \"view from a thousand feet\" shpeel, so our dinner lasted a long time.  That is beside the point, since we started getting dirty looks and nasty body language from our waitress as soon as we asked her to give us some more time before we ordered.  By the end of the dinner, the bus boy was literally removing anything left on the table to get us out of there (with aplomb and NO attempt at subtley).  I'm not normally thrown off, but it was truly embarassing to experience this in front of our founder.  Tuesday night.  Starting at 5pm when the place was fairly empty.  Uh, yeah.  I get turning over tables, but this was outrageous.  French culinary greats should be turning over in their graves!  I know Americans (of which I am one) don't eat the way Europeans do, but I mean come on.  I'm too old to have a twenty-twoish year old waitress hit the back of my menu with a ruler.  If I needed a dominatrix, I would have picked a more appropriate spot to receive my spanking.  I like food.  Good food.  I'm not into being \"seen\", so am 100% unwilling to be treated like a two-dollar whore (biatch, money is on the dresser) because I couldn't perform fast enough to suit the wait staff's (that's right, ME making THEM happy) pleasure.

Also 100% for the popovers. More please!  For entrees we got the fried chicken and the ribs. The chicken was to be expected from a house dish, classic and awesome. The meat was so tender and juicy but the skin had a nice crispness to it. The ribs were surprisingly great, i mean fall off the bone tender and a nice bbq sauce on them as well. I was pleasantly surprised. We tried the mac n cheese which is apparently very popular. It was good but not quite what I expected. I thought that it was very very rich and you tasted more butter/cream than actual cheese, a little disappointing but had high expectations going in. The asparagus was grilled and fresh. For dessert we had the peach pie, nice finish to the meal. We were so stuffed by this point so it was nice to have a lighter dessert, very fresh tasting. The service was top notch, very nice wait staff but it was very slow. I don't really mind I like to enjoy my meal with a drink but it was noticably slow to me. Our waitress was even nice enough to make sure we had a cab waiting outside for us when we were finished our meal. We ordered a fairly cheap bottle of wine, total bill around 200$ with tax and tip. We will definitely be back, the total experience was awesome.", "author": "Kate N."}

Had lunch there today and after being seated promptly, waited a good 15 minutes for our drinks and we were seated in the booth across from the bar.  \nThere were 4 of us for lunch and 2 of us ordered salad and soup and we shared the deviled eggs.  We had the butter lettuce salad which was very good and the tomato soup was very tasty.  The deviled eggs were good but too salty. From there it went downhill.  We waited over an hour to get our entrees and had to flag the server to order a 2nd drink.\nMy steak tartare was really good but not nearly as good as Bix.  I got the full order as I knew I'd be sharing and there was plenty. The chicken paillard, however,  was very small for the price and the burger (with egg) was bland.  My daughter did enjoy her avocado and hearts of palm salad.  Our server was very pleasant and I don't want to put the blame on him for the slow service but feel that if the kitchen was backed up he should have said something to acknowledge the fact that an hour had passed before our entrees were delivered.  The popovers were great and luckily came pretty quickly as they saved us from starving between courses.\nWe also ordered the mac and cheese to share and didn't realize until we got home that they never came.

The wait staff seemed confused at most times.  When our oysters came they didnt know which were which.  Someone went to find out and never came back, upon seeing that, our waitress ran away!  Eventually someone came out and said told us they were not in fact kumumotos at all, that they wer wellfleet casue they were out of the others.  they replace 3 of them with Tomales Bay which we didnt like.  Next I was excited to order Foie Gras.  When they described how it best should be eaten, that sounded good.  When it came to actually spreading the foie gras on the toast and then working with the shallots and grapes, you had to use your hands as they were not presented right.  My hands were sticky the rest of the night and the foie gras was bland.  My husbands ribeye was very thin, he actually thought it may be flank steak at first but it had a bone, so it was the rib eye just very thin.  My pacific halibut in tomato sauce was wonderful.  I am not sure if it was the wait for our food, the mix up with the oysters or the confused service, but they decided to comp us some desserts of their choice.  They were all pretty bad, except apparently for the coconut cake which was placed in front of me- I am allergic to coconut so had to carefully slide it away.  We had 2 decent bottles of wine, they would use more wines by the glass.  Total bill for 4 people- $500.  In no way was it worth it.

In my first visit I overlooked some of the mistakes as with any restaurant you have to work out the kinks so I didn't write a review.\nFirst off the service is exceptional.  We arrived at the time of our reservation and promptly seated at a very nice table.  Menus were provided as was the wine list, and there was no rush to make decisions, however the waiter was close by so when we made up our minds on the wine it was presented in a timely manner.\nThe popovers arrived a bit late and we only had one helping of them before the courses started to arrive.  I guess there was a lack of communication between the wait staff and the server. Oh, BTW the popovers are yummy.\nI should have heeded the advice of my fellow yelpers with regard to the fried chicken.  While the flavor was good it was greasy as can be.  Tyler you are from South Carolina, no one wants greasy chicken.\nOne of my dining companions had the Tai fish, that was yummy the other one had the pasta dish, which was ok, but not great.\nThe fries in duck fat were too greasy and soggy, even though they came right from the kitchen to the table.\nI was the only one who ordered dessert, It was the strawberry/rhubarb creme brulee tart.  The strawberries were under ripe and I couldn't find the rhubarb.  The dessert description was very full of ingredients.  Keep it simple and flavorful.  Basil oil, creme fraiche, etc. and it didn't live up to the descripton.\nI would give the service 5 stars if I could.\nI was disappointed there wasn't any Dungeness Crab on the menu, this is crab season in San Francisco and it's truly the best crab in the world.\nPerhaps I'll give it a try again in a few months to see if it has improved.", "author": "don b."}

They went over kill adding squid ink to calamari... flavors muddled and oily.  Got the beets.  Beets are always good, but the walnuts, ricotta, grapefruit was so flavorless, the entire plate was just bland... Got the burger.  It was cooked exactly to my specifications which is a plus, but is was very underwhelming. Huge burger, but NOTHING special about it. Sure the meat was juicy and well seasoned, but the cheese and mayo/aoli had no flavor... added nothing to it...the roasted onion thing on burgers is so over done and I just wish it wasn't there. The bacon was REALLY salty.. the bun was soft and buttery.  There were 3 little pickles on it and I totally looked forward to the bites with pickle in it so I could get some kind of tang and flavor to cut through the heavy denseness.  THe fries were good and plentiful... well cooked.. crisp on the outside, but after a few long ones, the rest were just fry-crumbs and again... WAY over salted.  The entrees my companions got did not blow them away...I heard complaints of too-salty....

In addition to making the reservation, I got 3 calls to confirm my reservation.  1 a few days before, 1 the day before and a call again the day of to make sure i would be there RIGHT on time for my 8 pm reservation on a Wednesday night.  My group and I arrived right at 8 pm and we were told there was going to be a wait...WOW, after 3 confirmation calls to make sure we were on time, you would think they could at least have the same courtesy.  We were going to grab a drink at the bar while we waited, but the bar was WAYYY to crowded to even think about it.  After a 15 minute we made our way to our table.  It was packed in the restaurant that night, and once we got seated it took our waiter almost 10 minutes to come over and get our drink orders.  I will say the only reason why I even gave this review more than 1 star was because the waiter was wonderful (once he was able to serve us).  He was very nice and helpful with menu questions.  The first thing that we were told was that they had just changed the menu to their \"fall menu\" the day before...which we were excited to try...the food was a MAJOR disappointment.\n\nSquash Soup: Came to the table cold- however we were so hungry at that point we ate it...\n\nMixed greens salad- Wow, kinda hard to mess up a salad, but this was BAD...basically just some radicchio with pomegranate seeds...\n\nFried chicken- Salty and Greasy!

I love the bar downstairs for after-work drinks and the grilled calamari as an appetizer, but beyond that, I found everything to be just, OK. We did the grilled calamari and Marin tomato salad as appetizers, and the calamari is outstanding, the tomato salad was pretty good, but not as flavorful as a good heirloom tomato salad. The warm popovers they serve are OK, and didn't have that much flavor.  I had the burger, which looked amazing, and my girlfriend had the steak with crab meat entree. Her meal was better than mine, but I found it hard to taste any independent flavors, everything seemed to blend together. My burger was disappointing, they forgot the fried egg and I didn't get it until I had finished 3/4 of my burger, and when I put it on, the yolk overwhelmed what was left and made it so soggy/mushy I couldn't even finish it. I really wanted to love this place, I am a big Tyler Florence fan, but I may have just caught them on a bad night.

I visited it on Friday night and the place was buzzing with friendliness. There was hardly any standing room left but we managed somehow to get a place at the bar and watched carefully as Gavin behind the counter prepared Oysters. They had at least 6-7 variety of oysters that night. The decor remeniscent of a hunting lodge or an older hotel was very familiar as it did not change much from Rubicon days but the food pleasantly suprised me.  We shared appetizers - Steak Tartar - one of the best I had,  Broiled Calamaris - amazingly prepared - rarely someone does it this way in US; last time I tasted calamaries so well prepared was in South Africa, and Avocado and Heart of Palm salad  with an amazing lemon vinegrette dressing that added uniqueness to this simple dish. We washed all of these down with a bottle of Hitching Post Pinot from Santa Barbara County which was just one of many great wines ( although not cheap) on their expansive wine list.

The menu was classic comfort food with an upscale twist to it... I guess so they can squeeze a few more dollars out of you.  Regardless - Its amazing!

The other 2 people with me ordered the fried chicken, which I think is supposed to be one of the best things on the menu.  I opted for the berkshire pork dish that was sitting atop some cippolini onions, carrts and potatoes... topped with a sunny side up over easy egg.  mmmmm fancy pot roast..  Served up in a sizzling hot mini cast iron skillet.  To finish we split the chocolate hazlenut torte with the frangelico ice cream (mostly because we wanted the ice cream).  All in all, I would definitely go back to this place.  The atmosphere was really nice and comfortable.

Being a fan of \"Tyler's Ultimate,\" I was happy to see Wayfare Tavern's largely excellent reviews here. I was looking forward to it but was largely disappointed.\n\nI arrived at the restaurant at around 9pm on a Wednesday night. It was busy, and I was told I would have to wait at least 45 minutes to get a table. That is completely understandable, and I was happy to take a seat at the bar, especially since I was dining alone that night. Unfortunately, I sat at the bar for at least 5 minutes before a bartender asked me if I knew what I wanted to order. When I asked if I could see a menu first, she seemed confused, not realizing I never got a menu. After perusing the menu and chatting with the gentleman next to me (who apparently eats there often and claims the service is always bad, but the food makes up for it), I decided to order the burger. I had just had the burger at the Spotted Pig in NY a couple of weeks before, which I thought was fantastic. So I was curious to see how this burger would compare. After I placed my order, I realized I had forgotten to say how I wanted my burger cooked (medium rare). I grabbed the attention of a bartender to correct my order, meanwhile thinking that this should have been caught when I placed my order. Not a big deal, so long as it comes out medium rare.\n\nSoon my burger came out, looking delicious and perfectly medium rare. (Unfortunately, it arrived before my neighbor's food, which he had ordered before I had even arrived in the restaurant. Suffice it to say, he was pretty annoyed and was soon complaining to any staff that would listen. Maybe he is just chronically unlucky with service, but I had my burger and nothing was going to stop me from biting into it.) Sadly, the burger was underwhelming. While the flavors were very good, more than anything else, it was *extremely* greasy. I don't have a problem with grease or delicious, delicious butter, but there was just simply too much. I didn't even touch the fries and felt sick by the time I was done eating. I chalk this up to the liberal application of butter to the brioche. I like a buttered bun, but this just seemed to go too far. The onions (also sauteed in butter, it seemed) and copious amounts of cheese didn't help either. I left the restaurant feeling sick and gross from a $19 burger and service that seemed to mostly ignore me. As far as comparing the burger to the Spotted Pig's burger, this one fell far, far below. I may go here again but will certainly try a different option.", "author": "Salman B."}

We were trying to go to Harrington's but didn't know that it was closed on Sundays. We were stuck in the Financial District on a Sunday night with our three children, I was exhausted from running my first half marathon that morning, and nothing around us was open. I really wanted a pub-type atmosphere where I could get a good beer. My husband started searching around on his phone, and told me he'd found a tavern and they were open. When we walked in we realized it was more upscale than your average tavern. They first told us they were booked but then, seeing how desperate we looked, said we could have a booth if we could be done in an hour. No problem! Our meal was great, especially the fried chicken. We ordered it because we figured the kids would eat it, but wished we'd ordered two so we didn't have to share. I had a pasta dish with mushrooms, asparagus, cheese, and other yummy ingredients. For not being a kid restaurant they were really nice to my daughters, bringing samples of their root beer on tap and giving them fresh-baked macaroons on the way out.

We laughed this off and were still looking forward to a great meal.  The starters were OK - deviled eggs, devils on horseback, and fries (luke warm).  The mains came and the salmon was very dry, the burger OK, and the fried chicken salty - actually, a lot of the dishes were very salty.  On the bright side, the mac 'n' cheese and poutine were good.  And then came the dessert.  Who can ruin dessert, right?  We had the pumpkin pudding cake and the special which had \"berry\" and \"mess\" in its title.  Neither of the desserts looked good, but we were willing to forgive the strange presentation for taste (the pudding cake had a bunch of very wrinkled grapes, a hunk of blue cheese, rough chopped nuts, and honeycomb, apparently from Tyler's back yard and the \"berry mess\" looked like a kindergartner's art project - melted sorbet, randomly strewn sponge cake, meringue, and lemon curd).  Well, this time looks were not deceiving - it was a bit of a chore to eat and we gave up after a bite or two.\n\nWe also had the same issue that another Yelper noted, three of us paid in cash and one on a credit card - the credit card was charged for 1/4 of the meal AND the entire meal?!\n\nIf you do go, try it for lunch before you commit to dinner!", "author": "Lori G."}

I was thrilled we got a res for 4 for 8pm on a friday. We showed up a few minutes late (maybe 5min) and were told just to wait at the bar. We ordered a bottle of wine there, planning to each start on a glass and then take the bottle to the table. We waited for at least 20 minutes before asking again about our table and then about 5 minutes after that, we were seated upstairs.\n\nThe place has a great feel, I really like the decor and viewing the menu before we came, I thought this would be my new favorite place. I can't believe I didn't like this place more, and maybe it was just a fluke, but we didn't have a good experience. The service was terribly slow and at this calibre of place, certain things should not have happened (asking for water to be refilled, needing to ask for an escargot fork for my escargot, asking for bread to go with my escargot). In general, timing was totally off, again, something I would not expect at Tyler Florence's restaurant. Our appetizers came fairly quickly, but it was a long wait between that and the entrees. I asked if Chef Florence was in, unfortunately he wasn't, but I was jealous when my friend got a signed card from him since we were celebrating her birthday. I can't remember for sure, but I don't think they brought a comped dessert.\n\nFood: my friend's boyfriend loved the Poutine, my husband was happy with the fried chicken, but I wasn't blown away and I don't remember what my friend had. I think overall we were in the mood of celebration so we still enjoyed our night, but I was most disappointed with what I ordered. I was so excited they had escargots, but I literally had to go home and go to bed after dinner as the amount of garlic was making me sick to my stomach. I love garlic and that's how escargots should be prepared but this was extreme. It didn't help that I had to ask for bread, which is almost the best part of eating escargot. My entree was gumbo, again, one of my favorites and again, a disappointment. I've made gumbo several times myself and I know you need to let it cook in the beginning beyond was smells normal until it's chalky brown and the flavors open up to almost a nuttiness. This again was too extreme, the whole dish was this intense smokiness that left a bad aftertaste. Finally, I had the mac and cheese (or at least some of it). Mac and cheese is my guilty pleasure and I order it almost anytime I have the chance. It was good here, but not the best I've had.\n\nBased on the service and my disappointment in the food, I said I'd never come back here. But as it's right across from my work and I pass it every day, I may give it another chance. I hope they were having an off night, I really want to love this place.", "author": "Lauren M."}

We had had such abysmal service (actually we didn't make it past the host station because we were treated so terribly) at another restaurant with a similar menu that we almost called it a night and went back to the hotel for dinner.  The evening was almost ruined due to the treatment at the first restaurant.  I called my hotel, Hotel Monaco, to ask for a recommendation, and the concierge recommended a personal favorite of his called Wayfare Tavern.  The experience at the Wayfare turned our night around.  We sat at the bar (they were completely and deservedly booked with reservations) and were given Star treatment despite my jeans and converse shoes.  We arrived at the Wayfare at 9pm, and being ravenously hungry, our eyes were bigger than our stomachs - so we completely outdid ourselves with appetizers.  We ordered the foie gras (magical), steak tar tar (yum) and bone marrow (AMAZING! Highly recommended!) and after being served we were given complimentary glasses of champagne by the adorable bartender.  Like coffee beans in between perfume selection, we had their deviled eggs to cut the flavor of the rich apps and they were as good as my grandmas. We were full after only appetizers, so a couple of waiters then brought us their fall desert, Spiced Pumpkin Pudding cake filled with BLUE CHEESE with candles and sang happy birthday.  It was an exquisite dining experience.  \n\nAs a side note, although I am a religious user of Yelp I never took peoples' reviews of the ambiance of a restaurant and the graciousness of the staff into account.  After this particular night in San Francisco, and the juxtaposition of this welcoming restaurant staff to the appalling treatment of the first, I now understand that it takes not only a FANTASTIC menu, but a charming, courteous and knowledgeable restaurant staff in order to complete a five star dining experience.   And the management of a restaurant obviously drives the staff, as we met the manager briefly at the host stand because he was overseeing the seating and he is amazingly considerate and friendly.  Do yourself a favor and go to Wayfare.", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

Second to all those here on Yelp who gave The Wayfare Tavern a bad review, I say, shame on you. This place is still in it's conception stage and is working out the kinks. I read every negative review, and to be honest, they all sounded like bitter, negative and critical people, so Tyler don't take it to heart. There is this small group of disgruntled people here in SF, that feel they are the last word when it comes to cusine and dinning. They all need to get over themselves. Enough said!\nThis was one of the best dinning experiences I've ever had in my 11 years in SF. Everything we ordered was PERFECT. I especially enjoyed the Fried Chicken and Beet Salad, also worth mentioning is the Steak & Eggs. The atmosphere is fabulous, the bar area is very urban-NYCish...the entire concept is probably the BEST THING THAT'S HAPPENED TO SF IN YEARS.\nNot only do I recommend The Wayfare, but I feel it will become a SF tradition as time goes on. Tyler, I've been following you for years on the FoodNetwork, you have seriously out done yourself. I will go as far to say, that The Wayfare Tavern is currently THE HOTTEST & BEST RESTAURANT IN SAN FRANCISCO, BAR NONE! Congratulations To Tyler Florence and his incredible staff, I give you 5 Stars *****. I hope to return VERY SOON.\nVince Furfaro", "author": "Vince F."}

We had a 9pm reservation and were lucky enough to sit at the chef's bar, a special treat. The food was amazing. Beautifully prepared (watching your food being lovingly put together absolutely enhances the taste, and it doesn't hurt when the finishing touches are added by the top chef himself). However (yep, sorry, there is a \"but,\"), some key elements were missing. Note to Tyler: more attention needs to be paid to service/waitstaff. Our initial wait at the bar was met by a bartender who couldn't understand what we were asking for, drinks that were so-so, and overall general confusion. Our waiter was adorable and very sweet, but we waited way too long for the infamous popover, ordered a drink and watched it sit on the bar for pickup, at least 10 minutes (ice melting), if not longer. Our server paid no attention, wasn't serving other people, making it all the more annoying. Plates were removed before both diners were finished, and there was just a certain air of roughness the food didn't deserve. \n\nI hope that this is something time will heal. Obviously other diners have experienced the less than great service. Will go back for the food in a heartbeat - maybe they can prepare it to go?", "author": "Christine D."}

Pork ribs were falling off the bone delicious, with a good amount of fat but not weird bits.  Yummy!  Strawberry Shortcake was fantastic, a notch above.

We were hoping to see Tyler Florence, but unfortunately, he was not there that day.  The atmosphere of the restaurant was great.  It was hustling and bustling even at 6pm, so I'd definitely recommend getting a reservation way ahead of time.  We got our own private room, which was a nice surprise.  However, the table was very big for us six girls, so a smaller table would have been appreciated instead of us yelling at each other across the table.  I ordered the bone marrow.  It was very good, but I kind of wished it came with a little more.  Another couple appetizers our table ordered was the mussel dish and the uni with fried clam belly dish.  They were both very delicious, especially the uni.  It came on a ricotta pudding, which was super good.  For my entree, I got the fried chicken, which was very good.  If you like rosemary, definitely get the fried chicken.  The breading was very crunchy.  Another good dish was the ricotta dumpling, which was very buttery and filling.  Dessert was a little disappointing, however.  I got the rocky road dessert and it was really sweet.  I was only able to eat about half the dish because it was huge.  The toasted marshmallows were good and the caramel popcorn was delicious, but due to the sweetness of the dessert, I couldn't finish everything.

What was nice about the menu is that it was diverse yet not too long and complicated.  A good assortment of dishes that all sounded wonderful.  My friend and I shared the fried chicken and the scallops, which were very tasty (although serving on a bed of chilled gazpacho was a little odd to me).  I would say that $8 for a side of 10 skinny spears of asparagus is a bit crazy but I guess that's what you expect in the financial district.  Service was excellent - always there just when you needed them but not bugging you when you didn't.  We tried 2 desserts, the lime pudding and the berry shortcake.

It's close to where I work; the space is wonderful; and the ingredients are first-rate.  Much, although not all, of the food is just ok.  Which is a shame given what they have to work with.  \n\nTo start, the popovers are wonderful, with a nice crust and rich, soft center.  We ordered the heirloom tomatoes, which were simple and quite good, but most of the work there was done by mother nature in the form of sweet, wonderful tomatoes.  Next, we split the ribs (a special) and the fried chicken (a staple), as well as some mac 'n cheese.  All were pretty good, but none were special -- and a person expects more from a place like this.  The sauce on the ribs was sweet, but the meat was overcooked and no longer juicy.  The chicken, brined, has a nice flavor, but lacks the crunch that usually accompanies good fried chicken.  Finally, the mac n' cheese is creamy, but that's it.  The dish lacks the subtle flavors, whether it be nutmeg, smoked pork, dried mustard, or good old fashion pepper that can balance out and contrasts with the creaminess.  Things did, however, end on a high note.  The chocolate cream pie was a great success, with deep flavors and great textures, including a flavorful, flakey crust.", "author": "Nick S."}

It was good, but the other stuff was even better in my opinion.  We had the winter greens to start since it looked like there wasn't too much other veggies to be had.  It looked just ok on the menu, but tasted fantastic! That quince jam...mmm.  The fromage blanc dressing was fancee too.  I never quite had a dressing like it.  Got the friend chicken, burger(well done), and mac & cheese.  Chicken was delish.  Burger was so good with those carmlized onions.  I was skeptical of my gf's well done burger since in my opinion its always better medium with good meat.  Then I took a bite of it, and it was still awesome.  Mac & cheese was guilty good pleasure.

In addition, we had the grilled calamari which I found a bit tough but no one else seemed to mind. For entrees, I got the organic fried chicken. Fresh and tasty, but not as crispy as I wouldve liked and definetely nothing die over like I read in some yelps. Maybe my expectations were too high, but it didnt wow me at all. Also, it doesnt come with any sides, and I think the waiter shouldve warned me of that which he didnt, so I ended up with a plate of just chicken. My boyfriend got the burger which was a really good burger so he said, but again nothing specatacular. Luckily I got to nibble some of his fries which were thin and crispy but a bit too salty. We were there with another couple who loved the place...they got the lobster and salmon I believe, so maybe those dishes are the way to go.

I had the burger. It was delicious. Cooked medium the way I like and the Mt. Tam cheese and onions gave it an extra oomph! I didn't add the greens because the burger is already huge and it would be hard for me to open my mouth even wider. The appetizer we chose was the oysters with chorizo. Different but flavorful.

We topped if off by sharing the goat cheese panna cotta dessert, which was very tasty.  We sat facing the kitchen, which added an interesting ambience to our dinner, and although it was fairly noisy, we were still able to hear each other when we conversed. Our waiter was Kevin, who was most attentive and helpful.  Water refills came without having to ask for them. The place is not cheap (we had two of the lowest priced entrees), but our out-of-pocket was not bad since we used the $50 gift card our niece had given us for a Christmas present.  We parked at the Portsmouth Square Garage at 733 Kearny Street in Chinatown and paid only $6 for our slightly less than 2-hour stay in the garage.  It was only about 1/4-mile walk to the restaurant from the garage, so reasonably priced parking was conveniently located.", "author": "M T."}

The mojito was sooo strong, a bit too strong for me but hey things can be worse ya know. So we had lunch there with some clients the other day and it was good. They brought out some deviled eggs & popovers on the house, which were good. Then we all had lunch, one had meatball sandwich, another had a hamburger etc and I had the crab louie salad. It was good, a bit different than others I'd had in how it was presented but good. The reason I can only give it three stars is because I had a major gastrointestinal episode after eating here. Major stomach pains etc. It was awful. The three stars are for our wonderful waiter who was awesome. So you can see why I've got mixed feelings about this place, yeah? Also it was really expensive and not really worth it in my opinion but its the hot new spot for now.", "author": "Kristin L."}

The food was pretty darn good. Shared the devil eggs (damn tasty) and the sardines (yummy) for apps. For dinner i had the steak & eggs.  Was bummed when the plate only came out with one egg when the menu cleary states 'EGGS'..where did the other egg go?  Regardless the entree was really good. Steak was cooked perfectly as was the one lonely egg.  I also tried the fried chicken and that was really tasty as well.  The popovers rock.  What i didn't care about my meal was the desserts. We ordered the coconut cake and the banana pudding.  The cake was dry and nothing special (i think we left half of it on the plate) and the pudding was disappointing. It had way to much of the meringue on top that there was barely any pudding.  Plus the cup it was served in was tiny. So a sad ending to a really good meal.  Will go back and order different desserts though.", "author": "Dilly M."}

A feeling of mischievousness overcomes you, and you begin to wonder about all of the secrets this place might have, just like in the 1800's. The bar is packed and the open kitchen is full of action. It feels a little chaotic, while I wait at the bar for the rest of my party to show. Despite, the opening week crowd, the bartenders are upbeat and do not give off the \"I feel the pressure, I am too busy\" vibe. There is a whirlwind of staff buzzing around and attending to your every need. At times, it feels like there is more staff than patrons. The general manager is very kind and talks to us in length about the making of Wayfare Tavern. The size and style of the menu is very representative of Old America, with a modern-Californian twist. It's large with ample choices for the meat lover and pescatarians. However, there is only one vegetarian entr\u00e9e with quite a few salads and sides to pick from.  We watch Mr. Florence  carefully inspect and perfect each dish before it goes out, which is really amazing to see. He even tries to take a few minutes away and talk to patrons, which I really appreciate in a celebrity and chef.  As for the taste, I am a little disappointed. Maybe, my expectations were too high, but as a gourmet foodie, I find the food to be good, not great. The entr\u00e9es are a little overpriced, but justifiable for the neighborhood. Though, I do plan to go back, just not too soon.", "author": "Nimisha G."}

There was about a 20 minute lull between each course, which was really too long.  We were not impressed by any of the courses.  We tried the pears to start, which were sweet and succulent on their own, but not too much was done to them to highlight them in the dish.  Then, we had oysters, which were fine.  I had the salmon, which was quite salty overall, and my husband had the chicken paillard, which was tasteless and somewhat dry.  We were so discouraged by dinner that we didn't bother with dessert.

The server we had was professional and very pleasant.  The complimentary popovers were fabulous.  I could eat a thousand.  The Cadillac Margs were brisk, icy and the hint of Grand Marnier was the last sip.  Excellent.  The Marin organic tomatoes in Aioli with black eyed peas and greens were outstanding.  Have the burger. The brioche bun alone is worth the 18 bucks.  The french fries were ordinary.  The beets are the best.  Such flavor.  But the mac and cheese is tooooooo die for without a doubt.  My sister had the Cobb salad with Maine lobster no less.  What a treat.  Now on to Tyler.  What a prince of a man.  He was working the line.  We asked if we could meet him, and they said of course.  Our server even prompted us when to go down to the kitchen.  He was personable, pleasant, warm, friendly, and when my sister told him that she came all the way from Topeka, KS to see him, he said come on over here and shook her hand and let us get a picture.  She is still walking on air.  He made a 50 year old woman very happy.  We may make this a yearly experience.  Oh please I forgot the desert.

It's not a place I'd go back to but it's worth trying it out. We weren't too hungry so we ordered some appetizers and a side of brussel sprouts. We got the deviled eggs and beet salad first. The deviled eggs were hyped up so much in other reviews but to me they were just ok. No matter how sexy you try to make these things they will still be boiled eggs with mashed yolks in the middle. The beet salad was very good. I've had beets that taste completely like dirt, but these were well seasoned, firm and mild in flavor. Our next dishes took so very long to arrive at our table. Our entire dinner lasted 3.5 hours because the second part of our meal took so long. All we were waiting for were the brussel sprouts, beef tartare and spinach salad. Our waiter was a sweetheart and comped our desserts because even he knew that was an incredibly long wait. I love brussel sprouts and I enjoyed the bacon that was also in this dish but I didn't like how these were lightly coated with cr\u00e8me fraiche. I just feel like it took away from the fresh flavor of the vegetable. My friend liked her tartare. I'm not a big fan, but she enjoyed it very much. For dessert we ordered the butterscotch charlotte and sticky toffee pudding. I wasn't impressed with the butterscotch as it had a bitter after taste. The toffee pudding was great. It wasn't too sweet and seemed more like a good moist cake to me.", "author": "Yelp O."}

Tyler oversees the orchestration of all the elements, and he's a handsome and commanding presence as always. If it were not for the very beautifully prepared fare, all this orchestration would be for naught. My companion & I found the halibut a bit salty, but moist and flavorful in the center. The ravioli was delicious, new combinations & elements, tasty sun-dried tomatoes, delicious sauce. The whiskey/rye cocktail was surprising, delicious, like a meal in itself. The wine pours were a bit short. And...my being a coconut nut, the complimentary macaroons to finish were scrumptious.

The cocktails, on the other hand, were great.  Service from the hostess stand to the end of the meal was hit and miss.  Lots of staff, and they seem to be busy, but I had to get up and fill my water glass after it sat empty for 15 minutes; and both times I was there I had to wait between 10 and 20 minutes for my \"reserved\" table to be ready (at lunch, when it can be hard to find 20 minutes to blow).  And the last time I was there, the food took forever.  We suddenly realized that we had been sitting for over an hour at the table and had only been served salads.  No excuses, no apologies.  I realize a lunch rush can get the best of any restaurant:  but a little waiterly attention goes a long way (and it doesn't help when you suddenly see your server returning from the kitchen after a prolonged absence chewing something).

It was buzzing with people and I thought it was nice.  As soon as I walked in, I was greeted at the door and offered to seat down.  I thought that was really nice.  (Later I learned that it was the famous Tyler Florence himself, greeting the people.)  I went in the direction I was told to go and, after looking around, spotted an empty chair near the counter.  There were no waiters near by, and no sign that the place was reserved or otherwise unavailable, so I sat there.  After that I tried to get waiters' attention for the next 10 minutes or so, but nobody came.  Finally, I got off my chair and went to look for a waiter at the bar.  But there was no waiter in sight!  The bartender seemed completely mobbed and couldn't care less.  Finally, I located a waiter who was standing in the corner, observing the hassle.  But when I asked him for help he seemed annoyed and said he would look for MY server.   Mind you, all I wanted was to get a drink at the bar!  Then another server came, asked what I wanted and then vanished.  10 more minutes later, a very cordial server came to offer me a drink.  Whew, a live person, finally!  I placed an order.  But the order never came.  Instead of my order, I was politely asked whether I had a reservation.  Of course, I did not.  So, at that point I was told that since I didn't have a reservation, I could not seat there and should go upstairs and start all over again.  Never mind my drink.   Never mind food.  So, at that point I got frustrated and just left.  I am still very angry and disappointed.  Had I known there was a bar upstairs, I would have gone straight there in the first place.

I have been wanting to go to Wayfare Tavern, but didn't think of it until we walked by. We had already walked into another restaurant and it was a 1.5 wait for the bar at 6:15, so the chances of us getting a table at one of the most popular restaurants in the city was really low. I walked in and they had a spot open for us at the Chefs table. What a great way to see all the commotion of the restaurant. We were somewhat torn what to start with, but ended up trying the Roasted Bone Marrow. Before that they passed around some of their signature popovers accompanied with some butter with sea salt. What great flavors and so fresh. Next was the bone marrow. I didn't know what to expect, but was excited to try it. The dish came out and it was full of flavor, and deliciousness. My boyfriend decided on the Duck Jumbo, I decided on the fried chicken, and then we shared the mac and cheese. His gumbo had just the right about of spice to give it a kick, and the duck was perfectly cooked. My fried chicken was perfectly cooked and had a delightful crunch to it with a hint of herbs that was not overpowering. The mac and cheese had a roasted top, and was creamy in the middle. The cheese was not overpowering, but was perfectly combined to create a sinful treat. The over all experience was excellent. Our waiter was beyond helpful and was so enjoyable to speak to.

Background: My wife just got hired by a local tech company so we went to wayfare to celebrate this special occasion.  It was a very special occasion to me and her because she had been unemployed for 1 year.  Wayfare was the place we chose because it was close to our house and had a great buzz. We got dressed up in a Suit and a nice dress and walked over to Wayfare.  It was a Thursday night and we had no reservations at 7 pm.  We asked the hostess (she was polite and perfect) for the next available table and she suggested we try to get a seat at the bar or go on a list for a 9:45 table.   So we did what many San Franciscans who spend way too much money eating/drinking out do; we ordered drinks from a friendly bartender and patiently waited for a bar seat to free up upstairs.  After spending money at the bar on Premium rounds of their best and waiting patiently with great company and great atmosphere, a Castro host ran upstairs and distracted the bartender with ridiculous restaurant politics banter; when a couple left at the bar and our hour of waiting was about to payoff with a two seats and a scrumptious meal, the Castro host grabbed both bar stools like a old woman at a store sale and told us the seats were reserved for a \"special couple.\"  The well tipped Bartender did nothing while two bourgeois bribed a host for two seats right in front of us and the bartender.   I am a 42 year old professional, that kind of play to someone in their twenties ends in a fist fight. This place sucks; they belong in Washington with the lobbyists who use payoffs as a daily business routine.

It takes an average arm to create a Martini with icebergs! 5) Food Network clientele.  If you want cholesterol clogged arteries, bad food, ridiculously bad service, bad pours of wine, below average martinis, and dead animals on the wall, this is your place.

Coming from Chicago and traveling often to NY, my friend and I have high expectations when it comes to restaurants -- and Wayfare met them with flying colors.  From being greeted by a friendly hostess, we were pleased to be seated near the open kitchen, where Tyler Florence himself was keeping things cooking.  The ambiance was great -- perfect for catching up with friends, celebrating a birthday or a client dinner (all of the above for me).  When I asked for a specifc wine, the server checked with the sommalier and brought me exactly what I had in mind.  Same for my beer-loving friend.  There's something for everyone on the menu -- we opted for the Marin tomatoes and baked avocado for apps.  LOVE!  The presentation itself was amazing -- and I've told about everyone I know about the amazing baked avocado with crab and bacon.  My friend had the signature fried chicken -- which she said was unlike any other - delicious.  I opted for the pacific halibut which was crispy, flavorful perfection.  And our chocolate cupcake dessert was beyond decadent.  In short -- can't wait for another trip to San Fran so we can go back and try more!", "author": "M S."}

Walked in at 5 and -- the only negative to our evening -- were treated a bit rudely by the \"girls\" at the front.  I don't know what makes hostesses, yes, in SF think they are supermodels who look their nose up at you.  We were dressed quite nicely and were polite, but really...Tyler, you need to improve here.  Other than that, the servers and everyone who came to the table was so, so nice and friendly and took their time even though the place became packed instantly.  I was impressed with the service.  But I was even more impressed wtih the food...Starting with a glass of Viogner and a popover and steak tartar, HEAVEN!   It could have ended there.  The entrees were equally as good -- fried chicken, short ribs and tuna, delicious.  And another popover!! Also amazing the sticky toffee pudding with black pepper ice cream and outstanding coffee French pressed at the table.  All this for under 150 is truely a bargain in SF.  Wanted to see Tyler, but alas he wasn't there.  One other minor thing:  In a first-class restaurant, it should be someone's job to check restrooms for supplies.", "author": "Janet H."}

I loved the building and the ambiance. It felt warm and inviting and not alt all intimidating. The valet attendant was even friendly and took pictures of us outside. As soon as we were seated we asked if tyler was there. The waitress said to go downstairs to te open kitchen and he would be happy ti sign autographs and take picures. He was so nice and not at all irritated with us interupting. It was packed on a monday night too. 2 of us ordered fried chicken, 1 ordered crab louis salad and 1 ordered mac n cheese. Best fried chicken i have ever had. My only negative is that i think the waitress should have told us how huge the portion was because we could have shared and ordered a couple side dishes. Then the dessert... Sage ice cream and pepper ice cream.. Sounds weird but i wanted to order a pint of each to go. An the pear and pudding that went with the pepper ice cream was amazing. I would reccomend anyone to this restaurant. Yummmmmy", "author": "Megan T."}

Taking the classic San Francisco tavern - think Taddich or John's and cross it with classic Southern and San Francisco comfort food and you have just what the city needed - a place you can go where everyone would know your name and still use as a destination spot. The food is fabulous - the Fried Chicken was the best I've had outside of the South as were the Ribs. The Mac and Cheese and Cream Corn were off the hook. The desserts were simply not to be believed. The pineapple upside down cake was the best I ever had and more than enough for the 5 of my dinner companions to share. In fact, all the portions are extremely generous and truly deliver value for money. The one negative is that right now this place has a lot of buzz so it was very crowded and things were backed up pretty badly - 15 minute wait for our table, long waits between courses, etc., But the wait staff was very communicative so we always knew what was going on and what to expect. Also, minor nit, the salt is a little heavy on the entrees - not too much, but it could be lightened up ever so slightly without losing out on taste. Congratulations to Mr Florence and welcome to San Francisco! This is a place I will be frequenting with pleasure and anticipation!", "author": "David A."}
