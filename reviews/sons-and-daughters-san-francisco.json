We get there exactly on time after having rushed to the restaurant... only to find out our table was not even ready yet. They then proceed to ask us to wait outside (in the cold???) or asked if we wanted recommendations for a bar around the area. This was very offsetting and really started the meal on a bad foot. They finally called us inside at almost 9pm. We were considering leaving. \n\nFood was pretty bad. My favorites were the Bread and one of the desserts... which says A LOT. Everything was too bizarre. Lots of contradicting earthy herby flavors and combinations that just didn't make sense.\n\nI do like the chocolates and the personalized menu you get at the end. And the bread. That's it.

Ambience 5 stars; beautiful design and on the smaller side so it's a comfortable place to be for 2.5 hours. Service a high 5 stars; everyone was very warm and completely unpretentious and the dishes came and went seamlessly. The wine in the pairing was all lovely -- we liked it so much that my partner and I will be purchasing two of the selections. I was also drawn here because the tasting menu was on the more reasonable side. Believe it or not, I cancelled my reservation for Benu because I was just not into paying $1000 for a meal!!\n\nBut the food! I generally trust Michelin and Yelpers with a good frame of reference, so that made it all the more sad when, dish after dish, I never had that \"YES\" moment after taking a bite. And in fact some just plain grossed me out. I won't go through all the dishes, but suffice it to say: 1) almost all were over salted (and I am a person who will probably get a stroke one day from my love of salt). 2) some dishes arrived cold or there were cold parts inside what was supposed to be warm. 3) A couple tasted like a dressed up version of frozen meals. 4) The flavors didn't feel very well balanced, and when there was a clear attempt to put weird things together, it didn't taste like it was thought through...I imagined someone in the kitchen with a bunch of random ingredients thinking, \"yeah, why not?\" and throwing them together...and at times it was blech. 5) Almost all the dishes had a very earthy herby profile, which makes sense given their tag line. But when you get like 5 dishes in and you're still tasting Mother Earth, it gets tiresome. I *really* wanted to see something bright in between the salty earthy stuff. I will say that they were very beautifully plated. The care and attention that went into that was obvious and it felt like getting a little present each time.\n\nSo sigh! I wish it was better, and I might even return because it did seem like a fluke.", "author": "Cersei L."}

Some of my favorites were the foie gras profiteroles; chilled sugar pie pumpkin soup with seeded granola, pomegranate and shaved foie gras; lobster and corn en papillote with lime and opal basil; and flash fried tai snapper with fermented cabbage, grapes and lovage.  The only dish I did not like was the hibachi grilled duck breast.

I have to say that I don't tend to like giving five star reviews because a restaurant really has to blow me away for me to give five stars, but Sons & Daughter did just that. \n\nFOOD:\n\nMy goodness, some of the combinations of food and dishes were absolutely delicious. My personal favorites were the chantrelle mushrooms with zucchini, the grilled suckling pig with X.O. and eggplant, and the almond cake with mulberry granita. Let me just tell you that the plating was incredible - it was pure art, even for a restaurant of this calibre it far exceeded my expectations. \n\nI loved the Asian inspired dishes such as the use of miso or X.O. in unconventional ways. The flavors worked beautifully together and I was actually blown away by the dishes I listed above (though all of them were fantastic). I will say that the almond cake and mulberry granita (the final dish) were ones that I will probably remember for a very long time. It was just such an interesting combination of flavors and textures and it tasted delicious on top of all of that, so kudos to the chef for coming up with one of the best desserts I've ever had. \n\nFinally, I'd say that the fact that you get to try three types of bread (sourdough, a squid ink hush puppy, and a sweet roll) made it even better because they were nice touches between dishes to give us a few more flavors to try. \n\nSERVICE/ATMOSPHERE:\n\nA 5/5 for impeccable service and atmosphere here as well. It's a cozy restaurant, only 28 seats I believe and the kitchen is tiny and situated in the middle of the restaurant. The chefs come out to finish the plating for several of the dishes and all the waiters/waitresses were extremely knowledgeable about the food, flavors, and how they worked with one another. All of the little touches as well such as refilling water, folding up napkins when someone goes to the bathroom, and cleaning up between courses made it that much better.\n\nAll in all, I cannot recommend this place enough. Considering that the overall price after tax & tip is below $200, you're in for a pretty good deal given the quality of the food. If you are looking for an occasion to go to a nice restaurant, Sons & Daughters has to be at the top of your list.", "author": "Michael L."}

The food itself was quite excellent with several good items - the grilled white asparagus with caviar, the fava bean pithivier, the rainbow trout and the New York strip.  The fresh baked (hot off the oven) breads and the house cultured butter were really excellent. The desserts were outstanding and they introduced me to black truffle ice cream!

The inside decor gave off an antique-old school vibe. Everything was blue-colored which was a little strange - it matched my dress color. There were no other reservations available except for 5:30PM, so when we arrived, it was still bright outside (would strongly encourage making reservations). The table we sat at was also interestingly close to the table next to us, to the point that we can hear their conversations. I understand the restaurant was probably going for the homey vibes, but it was a little too close for comfort. \n\nMore importantly, I expected the food to be more unique after paying all that $$$$. My expectations are higher if I am shelling out 200$ a person for a meal. The food was not bad, it just was a little more bland than I would have liked. Granted, we ate the summer special - possibly it was an \"off day,\" but next time, we hope to leave having the impression that it was an amazing meal. The appetizers were professionally plated and I left full. If the staff explained the origin a little more, I might have understood the effort and history it took to create the entree. Also, on a side note, I am lactose intolerant and they substituted cheese for an egg yolk... I'm glad they substituted it for something else but was surprised to see an egg yolk of all things.

I let the restaurant know in advance she doesn't eat lamb, one of the signature dishes at the restaurants.  It got replaced not with another protein, but a plate of carrots!  They were excellent carrots, but our reaction went from shock, denial, acceptance, and finally laughter.  Even our vegetarian friends would scoff at getting served carrots for their main entree!  Still, I'll give 3.5-stars since we really did enjoy the rest of the dinner and excellent service.  So, rounding up to 4 stars.

Roasted Morels: A few bites and you get nice texture and umami!\n\n2. Radish and Abalone: Creative bite-sized salad here, with the use of fiddlehead fern for the greens.  Crunchy and chewy dish.\n\n3. Foie Gras Terrine: Rich, but balanced with strawberry glaze and a red-white strawberry salad on top of braised swiss chard.  Bitter and sweet helps balance out the richness of the foie gras.\n\n4. Rainbow Trout: It looked closer like skin-on salmon but tasted less oily and was lighter. Perfectly cooked and paired well with black garlic sauce.\n\n5. Dessert: Spring cherry ice cream with pistacio, verjus granita, and juniper foam.  Multi-layered dessert that comes tartness and sweetness. Great end to a meal.\n\nRestaurant is small, and intimate with black and white decor.

We came to SF to celebrate my now-hubby's birthday last year and wanted a special, Michelin dining night out. Sons & Daughters fit that bill perfectly.\n\nWhen we arrived at our reservation time, the table wasn't ready so they recommended we grab a drink down the street for 1/2 hour.

And it's not an unusual name. So 1/2 star off for that.

We did start with three salted butters and they were all so delicious with the bread.\n \nFirst course: Tofu with ginger and summer savory. It was a nice start to the meal.\n\nSecond course: Rabbit with white peaches and black garlic.  I've not had much rabbit in my life and this was flavorful.

Just the right size.\n\nFifth course: He had a beef dish, I had the cod with zucchini and oysters. Another winner.\n\nSixth course: Dessert. Plum with marigold and popcorn. Beyond amazing. We dreamt of that plum dish for days after.\n\nSeventh course: We finished off with strawberry with lemon and creme fraiche.  Another winner.\n\nOverall the food was amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-02-16", "description": "I've been meaning to write this for a few months now (I went in September 2016). I'll do my best even though I don't remember every detail.\n\nSons & Daughters is a very dimly lit, minimally decorated restaurant that is pretty typical of a San Francisco establishment. The food is American (New) as most places are now. The ingredients are locally sourced from their own farm in the Santa Cruz mountains, which is awesome. The set tasting menu is seasonal, depending on the ingredients on the farm and what is grown. On the back of the menu (which is personalized for you, might I add) is a list of what is grown on their farm. This was so fun to read. I enjoyed learning about hybrid fruits and vegetables they cultivate and grow. \n\nMy favorite part of the dinner was not the courses, but rather the appetizers in between every course. Let me emphasize how a tiny piece of bread (but not so tiny that it's unreasonable) is brought after each course you finish. Bread that is definitely baked in house with specific butter that is also made in house. My favorite was the pretzel bun. Not only because it was so cute, but it was really good! A little on the salty side, but I just picked the salt off. \n\nThe courses were interesting. I enjoyed the uni in the first course. One that stood out to me was that one of the courses had a mushroom in Douglas Fir broth. Yes - Douglas Fir. I thought it was unique, but like I was eating a candle (how my friend so accurately described it). Super aromatic and literally what you would think tastes like Douglas Fir. It wasn't a lot of broth, so I was able to finish it, but if there was more I would not enjoy it at all. The one course that did stand out to me was the duck. It was grilled perfectly, and it was very tender. The desserts were also very aesthetically presented - cute and small and on a tri level wooden plate stand. The cookies and jellies and sweet milk shots were okay. I remember the milk being kind of fun and sweet, but the cookies I could've passed on. \n\nOverall, I think it's a unique idea with all the fusion of locally sourced ingredients, but the execution was not great. I had an unmemorable experience. The one thing I think of is the Douglas Fir, and it's not a good memory, more like a queasy one. I think it's somewhere you can go to once if you're dying to try it, but there a lot of better options to spend your money on an innovative menu in San Francisco.

Go for the wine pairing to make the courses really pop.  The interior is intimate playing an interesting mix of tunes.  The servers are spot on, engaging and professional but not stiff. The Fromage blanc was a bit salty (as it should be) and paired exceedingly well with the huckleberry gastrique in the first course.  This was followed by fish, then asparagus, then one of my favorites a Fois gras terrine paired with strawberry (to die for). then potatoes with caviar, followed by the main which was lamb.  The only course that did not send me over the moon was the the lamb which seemed a little tough and one note.  \n\nWe also came away with two favorite wines that I will be looking for.  This makes for a great place for a special event like a birthday or anniversary and they do a great job of calling those occasions out.  \n\nCan't wait to come back this summer and see what they have cooked up!", "author": "Heather D."}

Spectacular, attentive, unpretentious service, beautiful presentation and pacing, in an intimate and cozy dining room setting. \n\nEvery table seemed to be celebrating some sort of occasion: an anniversary or a birthday. Including us, my boyfriend brought me here for my birthday this year :)\n\nPricey at $135pp, and +$89pp for wine pairing. Fifteen percent service will be included.\n\nOur 9-course tasting menu with wine pairing: mostly hits, with some misses.\n\nFrom our menu, the buttermilk panna cotta with sorrel granita with thyme caramel shards was our least favorite. The nickel-sized panna cotta left much to be desired (if not just one bite more), and paired with the granita crystals and caramel shards, it was an experiment in texture contrasts that didn't quite work as well as some of the other courses.\n\nThe sturgeon with celery root and brussel sprouts, and the ribeye with sunchoke gratin and bone marrow mousse were the two courses that shined. And also the two best wine pairings.\n\nAlso pleasantly surprised by the intermezzo palate cleanser: sourdough ice cream with brown butter sauce and rye crumbles. Savory and unexpected. \n\nAnother big highlight of the dinner: their 3-courses of daily baked breads - the celery seed toast, sourdough boule, and the pretzel roll - served with cultured butter and whipped lardo... to die for.\n\nGlad to have finally made it here!", "author": "Ashley S."}

Service was excellent. \n\nWe were treated with fantastic sparkling wine for the birthday, followed with the seven course meal. There are generally two mainstreams of farm to table: one emphasizes the natural flavor of ingredients themselves and the other focuses on the use of spices/condiments to amplify the flavors. Sons and daughters definitely fell under the latter. All the dishes were extremely rich in flavor, which were great for the meat dishes but a little overwhelming for seafood dishes. Overall, very interesting mix of different and contrasting ingredients which created unusual taste profiles. The food portions, number of courses, and overall quantity of food were on the low end for prix fixe. \n\nTLDR: excellent service, average ambiance, flavorful and creative dishes though in precious quantities", "author": "Nancy Z."}

I can't tell you what we had to eat, because it just wasn't memorable or special enough. But what I can remember, was just how bad the service was, and how the meal dragged on far longer than it should have, because there were so many long pauses while waiting for the next course to arrive. By long pauses, I mean there were times that we thought something happened in the kitchen because nobody was getting any food. The pauses were 25-30 minutes long, if you were lucky. Longer, if you were unlucky. It was also excruciatingly hot in the dining area. It was so uncomfortable heat wise, that I started losing my appetite because all I could focus on was the temperature in the room. \n\nLe bf and I will not be back.

Everyone in the restaurant seemed to know it was my date's birthday - pretty sure every single waiter and hostess came by said happy birthday to him, it was kind of sweet. The menu also had a little birthday shout out which I was semi-suspecting they would since they had called me before and asked. As we were seated we were offered champagne to celebrate the day, which was a really nice touch.\n\nThe experience alone was great, as the restaurant had a little booklet that talks about the background of each dish and where all the ingredients are from. No other restaurant I've been to has ever had that and we really liked that. So as we were waiting between dishes we would read to see what was coming up next. Unfortunately all of the dishes were just okay and ordinary. Nothing stood out to me other than the bread - but bread is always good (they brought out 3 different kinds between the main courses). If I really had to choose something I liked it would probably have to be the salmon and the pork. Some of the other dishes we had like rabbit and sweetbread didn't seem to be paired properly with the other ingredients they included with the dish - it felt forced and a lot of the tastes didn't complement each other.\n\nHoping that we just went on an off day, saving grace for this restaurant was how friendly and great everyone was there.

Waiters are attentive and friendly.  One of them was great at remembering our names (they also had names preprinted on the menus), which made it a bit more personal.\n\nValentine's Day 2016 tasting menu ($150):\n--beef chawanmushi with caviar and nori chip--a bit hard to eat with the smallness and shape of the tiny bowl meant to hold a boiled egg. Decent taste, nori chip was fantastic, caviar pairing made the dish super salty though.\n--hamachi crudo with mussels, celery, and sea beans--great fish, good taste, but overall overly salty and would have been perfect with just a bit more celery.\n--bread #1--fennel toast with soft local butter--tiny but fantastic, super moist with the fennel baked in, and super rich and extra buttery since they pan fry after slicing.\n--crab with citrus in a creamy broth--excellent, perfectly cooked crab, rich but with the perfect bits of citrus to cut the richness and differentiate the dish--bowl-licking good.\n--bread #1.5--mushroom puff--bite-sized, light and tasty, but cold (presumably because the mushroom cream inside probably holds better when cold).\n--foie gras with raspberry marinated beets and hazelnut granola--I love foie gras, but I am tired of the whole peanut butter and jelly-esque montage that literally every other restaurant has on their menus.  Try something different, people!\n--roasted endive with black truffle, mushrooms, mushroom broth--earthy and so tasty--this was the star dish of the night.\n--bread #2--pretzel roll--drool worthy and buttery, but with a bit too much salt on top.\n--rib eye, sunchoke gratin with bone marrow mousse, and bitter chicories--I don't normally prefer rib eye, but this was the best rib eye I've ever had--perfectly prepared, consistent throughout, very tasty.  Sunchoke gratin with bone marrow mousse was tasty and went perfectly in terms of texture with the chips.  But I was not a fan of the bitter chicories--way too bitter for my taste.\n--bread #3--wheat bread--biggest bread portion of the night, good but nothing to rave about.\n--cheese with custard/pear butter and fennel/black rice cracker--not a fan of the cheese, felt it needed more sweetness to accompany it--I added honey, and it was much better.\n--citrus soup with panna cotta--panna cotta was good but it was just a couple bites, and the citrus soup was way too sour.\n--chocolate cream, malted milk ice cream, chocolate ganache, milk meringue--milk chocolatey goodness, I could have eaten 2. \n\nDownsides are:\n--temperature.  Kitchen is in the middle of the restaurant so they have the front door open half the time, which makes it very cold.\n--lengthy time requirement.  8:15pm dinner reservation.  Halfway through I urged them to lessen the time between dishes since I was starving, so they brought out an extra toast which was very nice.

The restaurant is small and divided into a few little rooms with low lighting.  We were seated immediately and given personalized menus which we could take home (I liked that touch).  We chose to do the wine pairing, which I highly recommend. They brought us an amuse bouche and shortly afterwards the first course, a tiny blood cracker with fromage blanc on the top - delicious but gone in one bite.  It was paired with a light Chenin Blanc from Anjou, perfect.  Next we had a small serving of hamachi crudo with a mineraly Gruner Veltliner. At this point I thought, we are going to be starving when this meal is over.  Next a small Maine lobster with winter citrus and Chardonnay from Burgandy.  Next a petit fois gras terrine paired with a berryish Pinot Noir.  Wow, I am thinking, this restaurant gives incredibly generous pours on their wine tastings!  Then a smooth mushroom broth with a Spanish Tempranillo. At this point I am full and mildly buzzed, forget what I said about small plates, they add up. After all of that, the main course, duck with farro and a peppery California Zinfandel.

I am still happy to have gone and experienced this. \n\nAll in all it was a unique experience that I surely will not repeat. There are so many excellent restaurants in SF that I'll never run short. I suspect there are some... perhaps many that love this place ... which just reminds me that diversity fuels our world . My goal in writing this post is to set realistic expectations for those folks like myself who might be expecting simple arrangements of food that are recognizable and filling. \n\nBon appetit!!", "author": "Andy K."}

This review was worth the time, as the entire team here at Sons & Daughters really is the creme de la creme of service and extraordinary taste level- from working with me to ensure a gluten free and dairy free tasting, to the presentation to the service all around 5 STARS!!!!!!\nI am a huge tasting fan and you will not be disappointed at Sons &Daughters- they are thoughtful, creative and the food is insanely delicious with bursts of intense flavor that is all around satisfying.", "author": "Jill S."}

I realize that as I got older, I find myself less impressed by the structure and show in \"fine dining.\"  All the culinary extravaganza in formal and well-orchestrated presentations and service have to some extent lost its appeal on me. I'm possibly jaded and surely less impressed. Lately, I leave farm-to-table restaurants more satisfied and less poor.  Win-win!\n\nHowever, Sons and Daughters successfully meshes the concepts of locally-sourced ingredients, changing nine-course menus, exceptional wine pairings, relaxed/warm/superb service in an intimate expanse that reminds you of your grandmother's charming house mixed with clean lines of modern touches.  The talented chef himself proudly serves the sixth dish and while he pours the delicate sauce over your truffled savory dish, you also get a glimpse of his heavily-decorated inked arm that he wears with superiority and deliberate formality.  Nothing snooty or uppity about this place.  Just quiet confidence, warmth and impeccable execution.\n\n\nTonight, I ate from my grandmother's plates with Asian-inspired modern utensils. I supported our local farms and experienced expert cookery with seasonal and the freshest ingredients.  Think monachelle heirloom beans, poached abalone, pistachio butter, pickled quince, fennel meringue, Big Rock Blue cheesecake, Limequat ice-cream, sesame with buttermilk snow, agastache and carrots (for dessert!).  Experimental in flavor and texture and it works!  Each ingredient successfully stands its own.  You'll taste each distinctly while you enjoy the complexity of all the flavors in every bite.  And don't be deceived by the seemingly small servings.  You will leave very satisfied!\n\nI left thinking buckwheat honey over tart gelato, topped with fennel fronds for dessert when I host the next dinner at my place.  I'm reinspired!

This place is small, intimate, & everyone seems to come here for a special occasion. Beautiful table settings. Incredibly pricey. It was worth coming here once, but I'd find it hard to justify such a pricey meal again.\n\nTHE SERVICE: Amazing! When they called to confirm my reservation, they asked if this was a special occasion (my birthday) & asked how to spell my name. Upon arrival, they brought us straight to our table, told me happy birthday, & gave us menus with \"Happy Birthday Ziyan!\" printed on top. We also got complimentary glasses of Prosecco right away. Everyone who served us was friendly & professional.\n\nNote that the whole tasting meal is supposed to take over 2 hours. We needed to be out of there in 1 hour 45 minutes & told them when we got there. They immediately notified the kitchen of this & got our 2 desserts out at the same time at the end of our meal. We went about 5 minutes over but it was fine.\n\nTHE COST: ~$350 total for two 7-course tastings at $115 each, a bottle of pinot (Amalie Roberts, 2009, Willamette Valley), tax, a 15% automatic gratuity, & our additional gratuity (much deserved)\n\n* Pre-amouse-bouche: Fruits - 3 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sons-and-daughters-san-francisco?select=ROUheSnopVj-v9Tffzd7Aw\nThe blackberries and strawberries weren't quite ripe.

Something about the texture (soft & mushy) & flavor (cherry glaze + savory sausage) just feel right to me. I ate half of my piece & had my bf eat the rest.

The fava beans were lightly charred, the sauce was unique, the fresh components were great. The meat was so tender!

The breast had a lightly crisped skin. The peas were a little crunchy. The slice of meat on the left the photo had a sweet glaze.

We had such a nice meal tonight.  Solid 4/5.  When I rank S&D 4/5, this is in the context of big league players.  Michelin league you could say.  Here's the breakdown.\n\nAtmosphere:  Surprisingly casual.  Is elegant casual a thing?  That's what it felt like.  The place was dimly lit, but had some nice natural lighting early in the night.  Its an intimate space with a clear view of the kitchen in the main dining room.  It struck a very comfortable but elegant cord, which we enjoyed.\n\nService:  From top to bottom, the service was impeccable but not overly polished.  It was the type of place that says , \"Are you done enjoying?\" vs \"Are you finished?\"  Our waitress was Juliana.  Nice, funny, thoughtful and well-spoken.  My girlfriend liked the soap from the bathroom and mentioned this during the 2nd course.  Juliana wrote it down and slipped this note in with the check.  Well done!\n\nFood:  Very good but not perfect.  It was a well executed farm to table meal.  Actually, they only use one farm.  The way I understand it - restaurant owns the farm, the restaurants uses almost exclusively things that are grown or raised on the farm.  Only hiccup was that the rabbit and 2 of the breads were a little heavy on the salt.  The breads would have been fine, but the butter was also salted.  We felt assalted.  Small hiccups in an otherwise excellent gourmet feast.  \n\nIn summary:  Highly recommend Sons and Daughters.  Foodies...enjoy.\n\nShari V Quote:  \"I want our waitress's voice\"", "author": "Chris B."}

We had such high expectations going in to the evening and after each course we were just more and more let down. The food was so mediocre. Innovative, sure. But what a lack of flavor. Nothing blew us away. Nothing melted in our mouths. Not one dish did I want more of. We all left really sad. \n\nOne positive of the evening- the staff was great. Everyone was friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nWe did not do the wine pairings (we brought 2 bottles and paid the corkage fee). \n\nIf I had to pick, the two dishes that were decent were the ribeye with sunchoke and bone marrow mousse. As well as the apple/squash dessert. But, still, nothing special. I've been to many other restaurants in SF that have left a lasting impression on me. This one, so lack-luster. And for $1000 for 5 people.....not worth it. \n\nWe all decided that our favorite thing we consumed that evening was their homemade toasts with Straus salted butter.

Everything (including the butter) is made in house and ingredients are sourced from a farm in Santa Cruz. \n\nWe tried the vegetarian tasting menu, which appeared to be 7 courses. At first, we felt the portions were on the smaller side but we were both stuffed before the two dessert courses.

With each sampling, the server provided a description and how we should eat - which was awesome.\n\nEverything tastes fresh and well balanced.

The restaurant itself is small and has a French tavern feel which I liked. The staff was quite lovely, very knowledgable and attentive.  Unfortunately our table was not available right away so we were seated at a \"waiting room\" and served some champagne and rose lemonade, nice touch.  Once seated it seemed the pacing of our courses was a little slow.  We were hungry since our dinner reservations were late (9 pm) and the wait of course did not help so the slow pacing felt quite significant for us.  \n\nThe food was presented quite nicely but fell short on taste.  My husband and I have been to many great restaurants in the city and we felt that Sons and Daughters' attempts at innovation was commendable but their flavor profiles just felt a little off.  A few more iterations maybe, and they'll get some of those dishes just right.  Also, we felt a few courses did not meld well with the others. For example, midway into our dinner, they served chicken ice cream with crispy bits of skin.  It was very interesting to say the least, and not at all as bad as it may sound, but how it fit in the entire dinner sequence I am not sure. \n\nNothing really left us wanting more which is highly disappointing.

Once stepping inside, I noticed that for that evening, the restaurant was filled with European young lovers and middle age people. I am middled aged, and I'm heading for Europe for the usual summer holiday. This seemed like a perfect joint for dinner on a Sunday evening. No trouble with parking. Personalized menu printed on paper one should find in French Landry, Benu or Saison or Coi. Food is very light, reminds me of Coi and Commonwealth. Then it starts to get intense when salmon and veal were served, which reminded me of Lazy Bear or Saison. \n\nThe meal started very light and airy, with vegetables served more like a modern art composition than editable things. I did not realize that you could actually eat marigold. I started to feel that I should harvest a bunch of them from my yard but that thought was soon gone as I realized that harvesting is one thing, but to make it tasty is yet another. Those who cannot create amazing dishes, eat. I'm good at the later apparently. \n\nRoasted beets were very tender but crunchy, pairing was with Riesling which frankly was magical. As I'm heading out to Bavaria next week followed with a visit to Mannheim and Stuttgart, I make a note to get myself a bottle of Donnoff Estate 2013 Nahe Risling while in Germany. \n\nThe next dish spotlighted squash blossom. I cannot understand why not more restaurants serve squash blossom, because it was simply divine. \n\nI am a huge fan of salmon with skin on. This next dish was that. Salmon with quail egg and avocado was quite delicious. Rose of Zinfandel from Turley Napa Valley was the pairing and it was quite nice, I usually do not care for rose but ever since spending time in Europe I find that you can get a good one, you just have to be selective. Veal was the main and final course and it was tender, served with endive and chanterelle mushrooms no less. \n\nYogurt and Lemon whipped yogurt with vanilla beans as a palate cleanser. Yum. I could eat that all night. The blueberry polenta and lime basil dessert was strange, especially when you serve with a scoop of corn ice cream, which was savory. Whomever is reading this must make note, make savory ice cream please. Immediately. It'll be the latest and greatest trend. I for one will be buying them in gallons. \n\nSons and Daughters is a hidden gem in Nob Hill. Parts of Nob Hill reminds me of upper east side. This restaurant is close to that part. Restaurant itself is quite understated. Service is impeccable. While the food is innovative and superbly executed, the undercurrent is that it is too cool to be compared to other Michelin start restaurants. It is quite happy to be in its own creative world.

They serve a 7-course tasting menu, but also included a few other Amuse-bouches & bread plates in between.\n\nThe restaurant itself was small and cozy. There weren't that many people on a Wed. evening so the atmosphere was comfortable and quiet. \n\nI finished with two favorite dishes: Black Cod with japanese eggplant & summer bean and Pork Belly with baby corn and nectarine. Both were executed well and the flavor profile was great. \n\nOverall thoughts: While this place is a bit out of the average price range it is definitely worth it for a special event. It is great that they source all their food from their local farm, which drives their changing seasonal menu. The food was great and the service attentive without being pretentious. I will have to say that I...hope...to visit again (as my wallet would be angry if I said otherwise).", "author": "Stephanie K."}

Everything that was made had a gluten free alternative for her.\n\nWe started with a pallet cleanser pickled meyer lemon/kumquat hybrid, then an amuse bouche of goat milk foam with buckwheat berries.  Our first course was then salmon and cucumber with trout roe.  Second we had beets with almonds.  Third halibut with green tomatoes.  Fourth, Pork three ways (pork belly, pork cheek, and pate campagne style) with porcini and morel mushrooms, and fava beans.  Fifth was a duck course with fiddleheads. Sixth and Seventh dishes were both deserts, geranium ice cream and then a strawberry shortcake type plate.  Sprinkled in were three bread amuse bouches, including the salted toast, a pretzel, and a sourdough slice.\n\nThe meal was amazing.  \n\nThe service staff were equally amazing, from our host, to our servers, and of course to our sommelier, whom helped us pick the right bottle against our preferred flavor profiles.

After determining that it was Michelin one-star rated and listed as one of Michael Bauer's Top 100 Bay Area restaurants, I had it down as a place \"to try\". \n\nThe day to try Sons and Daughter came this past weekend for my birthday celebration. To ensure its customers have a great dining experience, the restaurant called the day before to ensure there were no food allergies and our waitress also asked us upon our seating as we looked over the evening's menu and wished me a happy birthday. A nice touch was that our souvenir menus were personalized with a birthday greeting.  The wine captain came by and gave her birthday greeting and poured us a glass of complementary champagne to celebrate. \n\nWe ordered a wine pairing with our menu and each wine from Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain and Portugal complemented each course so well.  The menu consisted of:\n\nAmuse-bouche: Trout roe with smoked avocado on a rustic cracker. A nice starter with the slight saltiness of the roe.

(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sons-and-daughters-san-francisco?select=LHkOgs4FuVK5VotHZ6y38A#qUcPciBzotZwWv5dWef-ig)\n\nButtermilk bread topped with sea salt served with Strauss Creamery butter.  Bread was so good, it tasted fine without the butter.

I'd say the environs were clean with a rustic flair, punctuated by a contempo-provincial theme with stone grey linen table cloths and a few black & white framed artworks adorning the naked walls. Large glass windows let in just the right amount of natural light to make the space inviting yet still intimate and quiet. \nThe menu embraced a farm to table tradition which I was delighted to see. A list of all the locally sourced ingredients used in the evening's tasting menu were conveniently listed on the back of the menu, which immediately prompted me to peruse through the various interesting components utilized in my subsequent dishes. With that said, this is a prefixe only restaurant, meaning no a la cart menu. With the exception of food allergies, you will eat what they've preset for the evening.  On that note, I was confident my pre fixe meal would be a good one, considering the restaurant was awarded a michelin star, which is not easily achieved in this city. Staff were more on the obsequious side but began to warm up to us as the evening progressed. \n\nAmuse\nCrunchy chicharrone-like texture buttermilk tapioca crisp coupled with  caviar cradled inside popped in my mouth with a pleasant briny flavor.\n\nChilled Tomato Soup with Ground  Cherry and Merigold \nBright acidity imparted by the heirloom tomatoes and ground cherry added just the right amount of sweetness to this refreshing gazpacho like cold soup \n\nSalmon Avocado & Sea Grapes\nFresh and subtle in flavors, this dish was complex in texture yet simple with a clean finish \n\nCornbread toast with local Strauss butter lightly dusted course with sea - decadently buttery, the accompanying butter was really unnecessary IMO. Very much like brioche, this thickly cut toast would make an indulgent grilled cheese sandwich! Just saying\n\nRoasted Baby Beets Greek yogurt with vadouvan spices & mustard seeds - very prominent curry spices with a strong flavor of licorice noted. Not necessarily my favorite dish.\n\nCaraway Sourdough Rye Bread - came out warm and toasty. Not quite as buttery rich and decadent as the cornbread toast but a satisfying intermission nonetheless \n\nPork Three Ways Pickled Romesco Cauliflower Grilled Peach\nCroquette, Braised Pork Belly, Cured ham and flash fried kale\nOne of my favorite dishes of the evening. The clever use of the pork proteins three ways lent to a dish not only complex in texture and flavor profiles but inspiring and richly satisfying.\n\nPretzel Bread\nWarm and firm to the touch, this dense bread was a welcome addition our dinner intermission \n\nSquab\nMagnificently fatty with a tender supple and juicy flesh. Flavors were remarkably subtle yet irresistibly satisfying. Coupled with the roasted sunchokes, the dish had a earthy and rustic flavor that made me pine for another enticing mouthful. \n\nD'anjou pear granita with whipped lemon curd - refreshing and texturally successful. A perfect palate cleanser to the last few rich savory dishes we enjoyed\n\nWe enjoyed a beautiful glass of port in between our dessert dishes compliments of the house and how outstanding it was. Sweet full bodied and a wonderful addition to our final dessert, which was a chilled chocolate covered nougat log with hazelnuts hints of orange & anise. A chocolate lovers dream. Rich smooth creamy and absolutely divine.\n\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my dinner here, my only wish was that it didn't feel so cold in the beginning in regards to service. That being said, the cuisine itself was simply clean delicious and plating was exquisite.  Additionally, the farm to table experience was also what drew me in and I'm glad I had the opportunity to enjoy the seasonally inspired dishes in the city without having to trek out to wine country.\n\nHappy Eats!", "author": "Kent D."}

Total meal time was 1hr 40 min and, frankly, it was the perfect pace for us.  Often times, gaps between courses are just too long and we ache for a quicker pace.  \n\nWe had 6 courses plus amuse bouche and three breads.  The breads are amazing -- all three of them!!!  Definitely the highlight of the meal.\n\nIf I had to describe the experience in one work, I would classify this meal as \"earthy\".  Very pure, exposed greens that are minimally dressed to impart that fresh, farm to table, picked-from-the-garden essence.

Revisiting this place for the second time I wanted to see if the food was as good as I remembered it to be. \n\nImprovements from my first visit were the addition of 3 amuse bouche snacks; crab bisque, potato latke with apple and sugar cured green tomato. They also added an inter-mezzo palate cleanser of sourdough ice cream with brown butter sauce and rye crumbles before the meat course and the addition of two more mini desserts making the overall value better than my first visit. The service was also better as well; attentive yet not obtrusive and very amiable when asking questions about the food preparations and the restaurant. \n\nFood-wise the restaurant is a farm-to-table concept and the food is from their farm in Santa Cruz. Proteins were balanced with vegetables and even the vegetable dishes shone with their own flavor. My favorite dishes were the seafood ones in the beginning; dungeness crab w/ winter citrus, avocado, and paprika and sturgeon over celery roots and brussel sprouts. Both were well balanced and the textures helped accentuate the flavor of the individual ingredients to meld into one harmonious dish. However there was one dish endive roasted over oak w/ black truffle and mushroom broth that was very strong in flavor and slightly salty. Way too much of an umami overload, but there was sweetness in the endives that did little to balance the dish. The final savory course was ribeye with sunchoke gratin and bone marrow mouse with bitter chicories. For this the sunchoke definitely eclipsed the ribeye and the bitter chicories were a little too bitter and sour from the seasoning. Interspersed throughout the savory course are 3 breads that were as good as I remembered from my first visit; rye toast, sourdough, and a pretzel with a whipped butter.\nDessert was OK, nothing extraordinary but still delicious nonetheless. A cheese custard with pear butter and flax seed cracker combined sweet and savory/salty. The main dessert was roasted apples and poached squash with vanilla ice cream; an homage to apple pie I suppose? \n\nOverall I'd say 3.5 rounded to 4. The beginning seafood dishes were definitely my favorite and the vegetables were equally as good with the meal tapering off towards the end. Maybe a seafood main would have been better instead of ribeye? Creativity was there forsure and the farm-to-table aspect was also inherently present, but the meal seemed to lose power towards the end. The pairings were good; the 3 white wines that accompanied the 3 seafood dishes were well paired and helped complement the flavors of each other, but the other four were just OK. For $89 the pairing isn't too expensive. If you choose not to go with the pairings, they do have a good wine list with some beers and non-alcoholic beverages such as sodas, coffee, and tea. Service was great and definitely homey. They even included a brownie to-go and a case of their celery salt seasoning they used for the breads! A good meal but not one I'm dying to return to anytime soon again.", "author": "Chad S."}

It seems to be a trend to add an ampersand to something and then call it fancy. Nevertheless I LOVED Sons & Daughters.\n\nThis is probably ranks as one of the best meals I've ever had. Seriously. Not only that, the staff was amazing and knowledgable instead of being pretentious as some well reviewed and delicious restaurants tend to get. \n\nBooked this on Opentable to celebrate a friend's belated birthday. We were seated promptly on arrival and I had previously given some guidelines on what it was my friend could eat as she is an expectant mother to be. They come out immediately with champagne and sparkling rose lemonade for my friend so that we can toast her birthday in style. The lemonade is so good we end up ordering it to pair with the main course. \n\nAs long as we're splurging here I decided to do the wine pairing, might as well right? This might be one of the last bff girlfriend outings for 18 years lol. I'm going to make it last. \n\nHere's what we ended up having with our prix fixe meal (only I drank the pairing):\n- Roasted baby beets with vadouvan spices and mustard seeds paired with a 2012 Donnhoft Riesling (anything baby is delicious especially the beets)\n- Chicken consomm\u00e9 with egg yolk and parsley paired with a 2012 Domaine de la Cedette 'Le Chatelaine' \n- Washington Oysters with garden radish and thumbelina carrots paired with a 2012 Cabernet Franc Rose M Plouzeau 'Les Devants de la Bonneliere' \n- Artichoke with kale and yellow foot chanterelles paired with a 2012 Gamay from Guy Breton (this was one of my favorite pairings)\n- Grimaud Farm duck with sunchoke and pearl onions paired with a  2011 Pinot Noir from Maison Ambroise (this pinot was amazing as well)\n- Garden meyer lemon with rhubarb and herbs\n- Cheesecake with blood orange and tarragon paired with a 2011 Moscato Giallo from Vignalta.\n\nNot only was everything farm fresh, seasonal and delicious, they were plated impeccably, there was a custom menu with birthday wishes to the bday girl. Also I adored the tasty mini pastries/breads that were served along with the meal. They were the perfect size to satiate but not fill. While the courses were small, the amount of them left us feeling full. \n\nThe ambience was modern and well done, staff was kind and cheery.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-02", "description": "KenScale: 8.5/10\n\nI recently went on a week-long trip to San Francisco/Bay Area, where I had lived for three years for school before coming to NYC. I was looking forward to exploring all the exciting restaurants in the area, characterized by focus on seasonality and freshness of ingredients. I will start posting reviews for the restaurants that I had visited during my stay. First stop: Sons & Daughters, helmed by two chefs Matt McNamara and Teague Moriarty. \n\nThe restaurant serves only one tasting menu at $98 per person every night, with many ingredients sourced from a nearby farm. I was very impressed with the freshness of each dish, and could clearly see the emphasis of California cuisine on ingredients. Scallop that came with quinoa and limequat had a very nice smooth texture, and I couldn't stop thinking about the sweetbread and black trumpet mushroom immersed in cauliflower mousse. Both meat dishes (pork that came along with fennel and satsuma and lamb that came with celery root and juniper) were perfectly cooked, although I felt the seasoning could've been toned down just a little bit to further enhance the meat's texture. In the course of the meal, you'll get three types of bread, each very warm and delicious and complementing the savory dishes nicely. The desserts were also pleasant, from the light touch of meyer lemon with cranberry and salad burnet to sweet chocolate that came with pistachio and bay leaf.  \n\nThe restaurant has an extensive wine selection (there is also an option for wine pairing to go along with the tasting menu), and a bottle of pino noir from the area worked very well with the food. Sons & Daughters has a rather small but intimate dining room, so it may be necessary to book a table in advance. I was a fan of the elegant yet not stuffy dishes coming out from the kitchen, and believe Sons & Daughters is a great place to explore the approach and philosophy of California cuisine, with its devotion to seasonality and nature.", "author": "Ken S."}

But the idea of spending $100+ on a tasting menu that looks amazing in presentation but small in portion has always made my weary. But living in SF you're swarmed with restaurants with amazing reputations like this left and right so I knew it was only a matter of time until I tried my first!\n\nI went tonight with work (thank you Sosh!) and this was truly one of the best dinners I have ever had. Amazing, attentive service, and a feast of farm fresh food that was out of this world. \n\nOur menu included a salad dish, roasted beets, an oyster course featuring poached and fried oysters (hands down, spectacular), a chicken dish (which goes down in my book as the best chicken I have ever had.. moist, seasoned, SO smooth), followed by lamb (a piece of shoulder, loin, and rack -- each very gamey), and then dessert. \n\nIn addition, in between our courses we had 3 rounds of homemade bread served to us. This was probably a close second to being my favorite part of the meal. The bread was unbelievably good -- topped with Strauss butter. My favorite was the pretzel bread.\n\nI was worried about being hungry after dinner because the portions were generally smaller than what I'm used to, but by the third dish of roasted beets I was already feeling perfectly satisfied with the portions and how dinner was going. \n\nEach dish was so jam packed with ingredients and flavor that I was truly blown away. Best of all, I was completely full (but not to the point of being stuffed which is exactly the way it should be). Now looking back, this meal was well worth $100 and I suggest it to anyone celebrating a special occasion or if you simply want to treat yourselves. Your truly realize the difference between processed food vs. farm fresh/ prepared in the kitchen for hours on end (which this definitely was). \n\nFor dessert, first they served us with a scoop of meyer lemon sorbet which was more of a palate cleanser than a dessert. It was so fresh and icy -- literally the perfect thing to wash down dinner with and prepare me for dessert.\n\nThe actual dessert course was a strawberry polenta tart, with ice cream on the side. I think the ice cream was for sure my favorite part because it tasted exactly like cereal. One of the best flavors.", "author": "Naseem K."}

Beautiful, modern, natural-chic feel with a fireplace giving an added cozy feel to this intimate space. Every course that came out of the open kitchen became my new favorite. The plates are gorgeous and thoughtfully arranged, and each seasonal, farm-fresh ingredient is balanced perfectly with the others.  Black cod with Japanese eggplant was the best, though every course was an incredible marriage of fresh flavors grown on their farm. \nBut the BREAD. Oh that bread..made in-house with Cowgirl Creamery butter...to.heaven.and.back. Excellent wine pairings, especially the cava that came with the egg in-shell - one of the amuse-bouches.  Good God I have to eat that again before I die.\nThe only thing that wasn't out of this world were the desserts.  The last was a hazelnut-chocolate that was simply too strong and heavy for me at that point.  Plus I'm not a chocolate lover.  I know.   And the pairing of semillon just felt like over-kill on the sweet scale.  Aside from that, all the courses flowed together seamlessly. \nThey remained gracious and hospitable even as we were the last ones standing - or sitting, and a little lingering, rather. Very accommodating, friendly and knowledgeable service.  Perfect special San Francisco spot.  Take a date or someone you'd like to impress.", "author": "Angie H."}

That said, organic and sustainably raised ingredients are great, but if the chefs don't have the skill to pull it off, then you're still left with a substandard experience (albeit with a clearer conscience).\n\nLuckily what sets Sons & Daughters apart is their execution.  The presentation and service was great, but most importantly, the food was delicious.  My favorites were the Squash with Basil and Curds (plus finger limes, which adds pops of citrus as you bite) and the Duck with Fiddlehead Ferns and Mint.  The fiddlehead ferns look a little intimidating, but its fresh crunch was a great counterpoint against the rich and fatty duck.\n\nThe meal isn't cheap, but if you can splurge, then I'd recommend you give Sons & Daughters a shot.", "author": "Alan W."}

I ended up coming here myself on a self date - and honestly, the service, the food it was all impeccable, on point. \n\nI had gotten a bit late, but they gave me a quick call (which I didn't answer, but it was definitely kind they called).  I was seated at table 6 (yes I was paying attention to them calling my table when I was getting my food all night), which was right next to the kitchen. To be honest, it's one of the best experiences I've had recently. Also the menu - so great. They print your menu and any message you want on it. Since I wasn't celebrating anything special, mine just said \"Welcome, Nina\"\n\nDishes - \n-Sheep milk cheese (Amuse bouche): definitely pretty good. Small piece, but it was the start of a great meal. In addition, I got a glass of prosecco (my favorite!).  \n-Sheep milk with honey (Second Amuse): Oh this was a little spoon of happiness.  The sweet and salty was a great combination. Some seeds and a little flower on top for decoration. \n-Squash with sheep milk: The sheep milk was a great combination with squash. Again, it was some milk with the sweet squash. It was definitely beautifully plated and I really enjoyed it. \n-Trout with kosho and cucumber:  The trout was raw and went great with the cold cucumber.  Kosho is this pepper that was added on top and very sporadically.  In addition, the flowers added were an interesting combination. \n-Carrot with egg and Parmesan: This was one of my favorite dishes. The egg was a great combination with all the types of carrots . There were sweet and the egg was cooked in an  immersion circulator so it made the egg yolk perfectly oozy.  The parm added a great salty flavor to it. \n-Breads (buttered toast, rosemary focaccia, and pretzel): All the breads were delicious. I think my favorite was definitely the buttered toast. It was the best bread out of all of them - I really wanted a lot more pieces of them. \n-Pork with mushroom and fava bean and pork terrine with cherry: These were delicious. I liked the pork with mushrooms and fava beans. It was a small piece of the pork tenderloin, but it was probably the most delicious one of the two. The terrine was good, but I think unnecessary for the meal.  \n-Duck with farro, fiddlehead fern, and coriander: This was definitely my favorite dish. Not sure if it was because it was duck or because it was the best plated one in my opinion.  It was one of the best dishes I've ever had. Something I would definitely want again and again. \n-Yogurt blueberry and lime sorbet: The combination was absolutely divine.  The yogurt was sour and so was the lime sorbet, but the sugared blueberry and graham cracker crumble were great counterpoints.\n-Strawberry with lemon verbena: There were multiple types of strawberries included and the lemon verbena. The topping on it was really sweet and delicious.  \n-Truffle, Caramel, and Gelee (last dessert): The truffle was probably my favorite of the three, but honestly, it was a great ending to all the great dishes I had previously. \n\nOverall, an amazing meal and one that I don't regret at all. I spent quite a bit of money, but it was all worth it with the amazing food and the wonderful service. \n\nProtip: Just do it. Especially if you have a special occasion!", "author": "Nina Y."}

Got a delightful welcome once we entered. \n- Custom menu: put my name on it for a nice birthday greeting and souvenir (fun for my tasting menu collection)\n\nMidlights:\n- View: very fun looking into the super small kitchen front and center, however the opposite side of the table view out onto the street was a sign that said \"touch our junk, porn star...\" :-O\n- Oysters: enjoyed the fried one but other was a bit fishy and both were pretty small \n\nLowlights:\n- Service gap: before the oyster course there was almost a 30 minute wait \n- Lack of another entree course: felt like it needed another meat or fish course in place of the veggie ones\n- Turnip: way too bitter for me\n\nNice dining experience with fresh ingredients. Everything was just fine and I left with a bit of curiosity about what other dishes they'll come up with, so we'll see.", "author": "Eve K."}

Being a vegetarian (and my wife being a good sport) we got two vegetarian tasting menus.  First, the good.  Beautiful restaurant.  Wonderful hostess and attentive and kind wait staff.  Presentation/plating--each dish was more beautiful than the next.  Attention to detail--exacting and uncompromising.  Now the bad--the food just wasn't that good.  The pairings, while exotic, often didn't work (e.g., a plum sorbet with popcorn--a mistake), and the dishes were either too salty, too lemony, or simply too boring.  While there was certainly nothing that was terrible, there was also nothing that left us shaking our heads as to its excellence.  I appreciate that vegetarian cooking presents a special challenge but I have certainly been to several restaurants that have conquered that challenge. \n\nWould I go back?  Nah.  Is it possible that someone with a more refined pallet may feel that my review misses the boat?  I suppose.  But for this man, upon leaving, I looked enviously at the folks chomping down on their pizza in the restaurant next door.

We came last night, and it was a great experience.\n\nWe were running late, so I called ahead to let them know. They said they can only reserve your table for up to 25 minutes, and after that they would have to give up our reservation. We were just running about 10 minutes late so it wasn't a big deal. Parking was fairly easy to find in this area surprisingly!\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant and got seated immediately. They gave us personalized menus that said, \"Happy birthday Mom!\" and gave us a glass of sparkling wine on the house for her birthday. A few waiters also came up to my mom to wish her a happy birthday too. It really made her feel special on her birthday.\n\n$115 for 7 courses and $79 for wine pairing. All of the 7 courses we received tasted SO good. Not one of them was disappointing. The wine pairings that went along with the courses complemented the meals so well. I would definitely recommend the wine pairing with your dinner. The courses were made with fresh ingredients from local farms, and you can really taste the freshness of it. The thing that stood out the most was the bread that they served in-between the courses. All the breads that were served to us were so delicious, especially paired with the butter.\n\nSad to say my stomach was not quite satisfied with the 7 courses though. I left a bit hungry still :( I've had 4 courses at Gary Danko before, and I left with a full stomach! It's ok though because I honestly think Sons & Daughters is better than Gary Danko. \n\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant if you're celebrating a special occasion!

The printed menu with the party name on in for you to take home, the kind of service of a 2 Michelin Star resto-in-the-making. \n\n     Another changed was the new Maitre'd Nathan Hall, Mr. Hall made sure everything from before we got to Sons & Daughters to the time we left, everything was on point, top notch service. Additional to the team was the new sommelier, she's young and talented. The wine list is longer than before and it covers old world and new world wines. She recommend a 2011 Hiedler \"L\u00f6ss\" Gr\u00fcner Veltliner, a beautiful choice to go so well with the first few dishes we had. Later it was the 2006 Bouchard Pere & Fils Aloxe-Corton, Cote de Beaune, Burgundy, fantastic choice.\n\n      Chef Matt was in the kitchen and so chef Duncan, I know the meal is going to be fantastic. \n\n- Monterrey sea grapes, creme fraiche and green onion - think of toy, so pretty to eat.\n\n- Buff Orpington egg, early spring roots and miners lettuce - egg was deep fried, but the yolk was running inside, nicely crispy outside and juicy inside, love.  \n\n- Roasted baby beets, Vadouvan spices and purple mizuna - Think grden, beautifully presented and equally refreshing.\n\n- Sacramento sturgeon, smoked green garlic and Tokyo turnips - you got to see my photo, it was so beautiful, and this was very GENEROUS portion dish! Perfectly buttery texture, soft and delightful! \n\n- Farm raised chicken, wheat berries and Perigord truffle - I don't eat a lot of chicken but this was delicious and I guess the truffle makes it all worth it on every bite! \n\n- Akaushi beef, sunchokes and maitake mushroom - this was so marbled, melt in your mouth goodness, generous portion.\n\n- Bergamot curd, sweet woodruff meringue and new yarrow - this was so picture perfect, it wasn't sweet, just a perfect finish!\n\n- Geranium ice cream, wild huckleberry and black pepper - yumm and chef wrote \"Manda Bear\" on the plate, I feel special!\n\n          All the dishes were AMAZING, it was like we were taken on a journey that it was progressively fantastic and we didn't want it to end; but every journey has an end, and so was our meal. My broski, his lady and my friend, they all loved it. I can't wait to come back soon. Thank you for staying true to the philosophy of what you serving since day 1!

We each had varying dietary restrictions and preferences (read: a chef's worst nightmare) yet the staff were nice and accommodating and we were treated to complimentary champagne and juice (for the non alcoholics). The ambiance is beautiful with a fire place, chandeliers, and exposed brick, but is not stuffy at all -- several diners were in jeans which is rare to see at a Michelin starred restaurant. The food was uneven, if I'm perfectly honest. There was a fish soup my friends unanimously loved. I however am allergic to fish so I was treated to the same dish that used zucchini as a substitute for fish and was underwhelmed. I believe that due to my allergy, I could not appreciate the full effect  of this particular dish and I wish Sons & Daughters had experimented a little more and given me something totally different! That being said, some diners may appreciate the discretion used by the restaurant by giving us similar dishes. It's a personal preference that I can't hold against the restaurant!

Since I spend a limited amount of time in San Francisco nowadays, it's always been on my list of places to try but never high enough to the point where I've actually gone. Until now.\n\nWe arrived slightly early for our Saturday night reservation and our table was not yet available. The hostess surprised us with glasses of sparkling wine for our wait, an unexpected but welcome gesture.\n\nbuttermilk chicharron trout roe, finger lime - The meal began with an amuse bouche from the kitchen. I found the 'chicharron' to have a crispy but sort of stale crunch, and the lime's tart flavor overpowered everything else.\n\nhamachi salad burnet and caviar - The fatty piece of hamachi was a nice pairing with the salty caviar; a slightly smoky dashi broth underneath completed the savory bites.\n\nAt this point, our first piece of bread (a buckwheat toast) came out of the kitchen, hot and fresh.\n\nroasted beets aromatic spices and fresh tarragon - Sweet beets were countered by a tart yogurt, while the curry-like flavor of the vadouvan provided more savory depth.\n\nfennel seed soup garden roots and bitter leaves - I found the soup to be very creamy and subtly sweet; the bitter greens provided a nice balance to the sweetness. Crispy radishes and carrots provided a little bit of crunch.\n\nA classic in San Francisco, sourdough was our next bread. Again, it came out nice and hot.\n\ncharred endive pasta bone marrow and preserved apple - I really liked the charred endive filling of the pasta. The pasta was cooked to a nice chewy al dente (with the exception of one rather gritty piece); sweet apples and rich bone marrow provided a really nice tandem which worked well with the pasta.\n\nbraised chanterelle black garlic and clover - I thought the chanterelles were pretty tasty though not particularly special. The crispy layered potato, kind of like a mille-feuille, was excellent with delicious buttery slices of the starch. The black garlic puree provided a very mild garlicky flavor.\n\nOur last piece of bread was a pretzel bread, which was maybe my favorite of the trio.\n\nsquab marcona almond butter and citrus - The squab was pretty tasty on its own, cooked a nice medium, while the rich marcona almond butter provided a welcome nuttiness to the meat. I thought the citrus segments (grapefruit?) really helped to brighten everything up.\n\nfresh chestnut pear and vanilla rum - Asian pear, a hibiscus gel, and chestnut ice cream formed an interesting mix of flavors. I can't say I loved this, but it was unique.\n\ndark chocolate flavors of young eucalyptus and anise hyssop - Lastly, we were served a chocolate dessert infused with a floral, woody flavor of eucalyptus. Anise ice cream was a nice complementary flavor to what I thought was a much more successful dessert.\n\ntangerine pate de fruits - One last sweet completed our meal. I enjoyed the bright tangerine flavor packed in these jellies.\n\nI thought our meal at Sons & Daughters was just okay. I wouldn't say anything about the meal was impressive, and the food, while different, was altogether unmemorable. Service was excellent, but it wasn't enough to redeem the overall experience. While the price point wasn't outrageous, I was definitely expecting more from this meal.", "author": "Darin L."}

However, the food was far from my expectation.  Some of the food & dressing combination does not seem to compliment each other. Different breads were served.  If I have to identify one good item, it would be the pretzel bread.  One of the bread was burnt to a charcoal crisp which could be toxic.  I read thru the other reviews and am seriously wondering if I just went on a off day.\n\nThe first course was a Hamachi with Asparagus and Asian Pear.  The Hamachi have a stale fishy smell, felt stale slimy and tasted old.   The next dish was Turnip with Romain and Treviso. The turnip was bland.  I expected the turnip aroma and sweetness. One of the dish(Cannot remember which one) have a dressing with some really strong sour vinegar that was splashed at random.   Some vegetables have it and some does not.  One mouthful was bland and the next extremely sour.   Unpleasant experience.\n\nThe YellowFoot Mushroom dish with Fiddlehead fern and lapsang souchong was next.  The dish was extremely salty in random mouthful.  Not sure if the salt was spilled by accident. The soup did not help.\n\nThe quail with Artichoke and green garlic:  Quail tasted bland and the meat have absolute no flavor on it's own.  If meat is farm raised and fresh, the meat would have subtle sweet taste of the fowl.\n\nThe lamb dish was a disappointment and I love lamb.  The meat was tough and chewy.

Pre-Michelin star, the tasting menu was a reasonable $48. Post-Michelin star, the price has more than doubled at $98. Luckily we beat yet another price hike because just last week, they raised the tasting menu to $138 (now including service). At that price point (should be listed as $$$$ not $$$) and with a distinguished Michelin star, one should expect culinary excellence for every dish.\n\nA Saison knock off (my review: http://bit.ly/U6Z2f5) and a Commis wannabe (my review: http://bit.ly/Uvu0xO), Sons & Daughters was a Michelin star disappointment. Although all the delicate ingredients from their Los Gatos garden was beautifully presented, some dishes lacked cohesiveness while others had a distinctly unappetizing flavor profile. Had not been for the stellar service this could have easily been a 2 star review.\n\nLadies, leave your man at home or be prepared to make him a post dinner of Top Ramen since he'll scrounging for quarters in the cracks of his couch after this one. Thankfully, I went with my girls because someone would have had a heart attack having to foot the nearly $350 bill (for two) for an ordinary weeknight dinner. \n\nF O O D\nExpect to spend close to 3 hours for the tiny eight course dinner with one amuse bouche and three intermezzo bread courses. Though Dr. Atkins will be giving you the evil eye from above, do NOT skip the bread; otherwise you'll miss the best part of dinner (no joke) and leave hungry. \n\nSeasonal Eight Course Tasting Menu ($98): http://bit.ly/PBawuo\n(1) Buttermilk Chip w/ Trout Roe: http://bit.ly/YD9n8a\n(2) Sea Urchin w/ Local Seaweed, Cucumbers & Dashi Vinaigrette: http://bit.ly/RdKSdz\n(3) Leek Soup w/ Sturgeon Caviar: http://bit.ly/SxLz0D\n(4) Beets w/ Vadouvan, Tarragon & Pickled Mustard Seeds: http://bit.ly/YDa8hs\n(5) Black Cod w/ Yukon Potato & Brown Butter Bearnaise: http://bit.ly/UvtJuX\n(6) Squab Breast w/ Marcona Almond & Blood Orange: http://bit.ly/VQQPwP\n(7) Geranium Sorbet w/ Salad Burnet & Vanilla Sable: http://bit.ly/PATc8Q\n(8) Dark Chocolate Ganache w/ Young Eucalyptus & Chocolate Mint: http://bit.ly/VQQVEM\n\nThe Buttermilk Chip (chicharron) w/ trout roe was an inventive surf and turf first bite but way too minuscule to be considered a course. The Sea Urchin w/ local seaweed felt disconnected as the crunchy texture of the snow fungus like seaweed distracted from the creaminess of the sea urchin. Comfort in a bowl, the Leek Soup was divinely creamy with a pop of saltiness from the caviar. Although a light and refreshing dish, the Beets course was way too simple and lacked an oomph factor. An utter disappointment, the Black Cod was over seasoned and the bearnaise was watery and shockingly sour. The Squab was a standout dish of the night; perfectly cooked to a medium rare with a nice citrus punch from the blood orange. Too bad there were just two bites of it. Then, came more disappointments. Just a tablespoon given, the fragrant Geranium sorbet was more like a palate cleanser and laughable as a course. Looks are very deceiving as was the case of the Dark Chocolate Ganache.

I didn't taste any ingredients or flavors that I haven't experienced before. I thought the cooking was restraint and colorless. And to add insult to injury, only 2 of the 7 courses had any protein in it. Thank god for the bread courses in between because, otherwise, one would leave the place hungry.

Our favorites turned out to be a fun mix of breads between some of the larger courses.\n\nThe staff is helpful and friendly exuding a good balance of casual but knowledgeable and sophisticated service.

For some reason, when I hear Sons & Daughters, I think cool bar and that's what Sons & Daughters is like.  The tables are a nice dark brown wood and there is (what looks like) wrought iron throughout the room.  The open kitchen is very close to the dining room, which creates a stronger connection between the staff and the diner and there is great use of the existing space--a nice fireplace and a great narrow staircase down to the restrooms.\n\nSons & Daughters is a tasting menu-only spot (a vegetarian tasting menu is available).  The tasting menu consists of eight courses, which are supplemented with fresh bread courses (something I've seen at a few Bay Area spots recently like Atelier Crenn and The Restaurant at Meadowood).\n\nThere is a wide variety of proteins and ingredients in their tasting menu and the cooking is very strong.  Several of the courses also feature generous portions.\n\nThe first course was two kinds of canapes.  There was a nice crisp that was topped with salmon roe (a burst of juicy flavor), citrus and creme fraiche.  There was also a very good and fresh miyagi oyster topped with a cool, airy, sweet, and tart watermelon topping.\n\nThe next course was very good sea urchin (lightly sweet and tasting of the ocean).  The garnishes were fine--really good seaweed, cucumber and quail bush (the quail bush was a little salty).  While the garnishes were okay, there were too much of them and the salty and vinegary notes overwhelmed the creamy sea urchin.\n\nThe next course was very good gazpacho (very smooth and a great flavor) that was topped with fragrant greens, crisp radishes and fried mussels.  I really liked the fried mussels (they kind of reminded me of fried mushrooms and fried clams from the east coast).\n\nA generous beet salad came next.  The beets were great--juicy and flavorful.  The beets were garnished with mustard seeds and very good vadouvan (a nice granola and seed-like curry seasoning that had great spice and heat).\n\nThe fish course came next and it was line caught salmon.  The salmon was a generous portion for a tasting menu and it was very good.  They got a great crispy and flavorful skin on the salmon (you could hear the sizzling and popping of the salmon skin from the nearby kitchen).\n\nThe salmon flaked very well and was very moist and good.  The sides were good.  There was some good summer squash and I liked the tartness from the green strawberries and gooseberries, but the star here was definitely the salmon.\n\nThe meat course was squab breast and it had a great crispy skin too.  The flavor of the squab was good and the meat was tender.  The squab was mostly juicy, but I would have preferred a more red/pink color.  The sides were great.  I liked the freshness and flavor of the plums and the marcona almond puree was nutty, creamy and smooth.\n\nThe first dessert course was nice melon with a very good geranium sorbet, which was very fragrant and floral (it had a great unique flavor and was a perfect transition from the savory courses to the final dessert).\n\nThe final dessert was a chocolate accentuated by eucalyptus (it ended up having a chocolate lavender like flavor).  There was also cool and refreshing chocolate mint cream and good bing cherries.  While I really liked the ice cream, the ganache was just okay.  It had a good rich chocolate flavor, but it was kind of a simple and straightforward dessert.  I would have preferred something with more of a pastry element to it.\n\nThe bread courses included a very good cornbread toast and then just okay sourdough and pretzel rolls (both of the rolls were too dense).  The butter was good (a variation on Strauss), but the big flakes of sea salt made the butter too strong.\n\nService was great--personable, polite, professional, and attentive (the food came out at a good and consistent pace).  The best server I had at Benu is now here and he did a great job.\n\nThe price of the tasting menu is high, but it is less than a lot of the other highly rated SF fine dining spots.  In many ways, Sons & Daughters reminds me of Commis in how it provides a true upscale fine dining experience at a relatively low cost (I found the food at Sons & Daughters to be far superior to what I had at Commis though).\n\nI really enjoyed Sons & Daughters.  They did a great job cooking the proteins and the quality of ingredients really stood out (great freshness throughout the meal).  With tasting menus, there can often be a lot of subpar dishes, but Sons & Daughters really excels at putting out one great dish after another.\n\nStreet parking is hard to find, but there are a few nearby parking structures and their rates go down at night.", "author": "Anthony N."}

I'm not sure I would recommend taking out of towners here, unless they are looking for a full wine and dine experience all with home grown roots and vegetables. S&D is definitely more of a novelty experience, but still offering top notch service and food. My advice is to book this place for a special occasion like an anniversary. \n\nThe service here is phenomenal. They take care of every detail. You have to make a reservation in advance, but they will call and confirm if you're celebrating anything and if you have dietary restrictions before they plan your meal. You arrive and a personalized menu is at your table. Each meal is thoroughly explained and accompanies a delicious piece of bread. Each dish also features a flower from their own garden, which is really neat. \n\nAs for the food. It is fresh, original and well complemented. But for $98, I don't think I'll be coming back. \n\nOf my 7 course meal, the standouts were the Scallop and ground cherries, and the white mousse and geranium ice cream. \n\nLoved the service and unique experience.

That was the only time we could get reservations for. We told them that we needed to make our 7:30 movie and they said the tasting lasts about 2:30 minutes. (not true). We were out of there in less than 2 hours- and that wasn't because we rushed to make our movie time. We had 5 courses with a sample of bread between every sample. The bread was AMAZING. If I could buy their bread, I would in a heartbeat.\nThe reason that I give them 4 stars is because:\n1. they wouldn't let us push our dinner back and when we got there it was empty and we were the only ones there for at least half an hour.\n2. The food was good. But my bf spent almost $300 on our meal and we didn't even get wine. For $300 the food should have been the most delicious thing I ever tasted. The bread though was definitely- top 3 breads I ever had.\nOne thing that I did love of Sons and Daughters was the teamwork.

Attentive to wine pours, description of food, clearing plates and generally friendly demeanor. \n\nAmbience: Modern but small space.

Also, you definitely don't want to have any intimate conversations here, unless you're very comfortable with the other parties around you hearing. \n\nFood: Fantastic. This was my second trip to Sons & Daughters (different menu). Both times there were some consistent dishes (beets w/ Indian spices, some variation of Pork, crisp w/ roe). All of these dishes are prepared very well (especially the beets, which I normally hate, but when you combine them with some awesome Indian spices they're not so bad). The pork! Oh my! They have belly, shoulder, and loin each with different preparations. Coffee and tea are available during dessert (which was 2 parts, a  small lemon bite (some variation of a lemon square and lemon gelatin and a chocolate  cake like dessert). \n\nRandom: They put your name at the top of your menu which is cute but somewhat awkward.

And I finally went, with my three cousins, this past weekend. I can say that it was definitely worth the wait. Reservations are pretty much required, and I made ours about two months in advance. We did arrive a little early, but our table was ready and we were seated near the fireplace. At first it was a little warm, but quickly became the perfect temp in there. The ambience and the d\u00e9cor of the restaurant is perfect for a place that grows its own food on a farm and then brings it into the city to cook up. It just fits. The menu is a pre-set tasting menu, with the option of a wine pairing. I did not get the wine pairing, since I was driving, and I always get pretty liquored up with wine pairings, but my three cousins did. They all commented throughout the meal that the various wines were tasty and perfect with the plate. The highlights of the meal were the Sunchoke, Scallop, Rock Cod, and the Blood Orange. All of these had such unique ingredients that created amazing flavors, and were just flat out delicious. Each dish was a pleasant surprise from how it was beautifully, but simply, plated to the flavors all mixed together. Also, the breads and butters. There was three servings of bread, that they bake at the restaurant, and they were delicious. With the second serving of bread, they brought a bone marrow spread - it was nothing like I had ever tasted and I loved it.

The evening started extremely awkwardly as we arrived on time, but because our table wasn't cleared yet they took us down into a waiting area where they told us to \"watch your head\" because of the low ceiling. The waiting area was claustrophobic and felt like the game room of a senior center. What's weird about it is we asked them if we could just sit at the table as they cleared it--we didn't mind--but they told us we had only two options: wait in the waiting area or wait outside. And if you know anything about the Tenderloin that's not much of a choice.\n\nSpeaking of having no choice, I am totally down for the one-menu-for-everyone thing, but if the menu itself is weak that's not a good choice. It has been two weeks and I can't think of a single memorable dish. My general impressions of the food were:\n\n- excellent quality ingredients. Clearly they put a lot of thought into sourcing their food and you can taste the \"locovore\" nature of the place\n- very nice wait staff. Other than the initial awkwardness they were very accommodating and professional\n- unoriginal and downright boring dishes. The flavors were distinct and excellent, but they seem like they put very little thought into how the flavors went together. The combinations were either typical or faux-original (like they were trying to be original but it didn't work at all).\n- they made very good alternative dishes for our pescatarian companion. The fish was excellent and it's difficult for restaurants to accommodate all dietary needs so I appreciate that\n- the meat was high quality but too plainly prepared\n- I liked the simple decor but the atmosphere was too stilted for my taste (but that's a personal preference)\n\nI would give this place 4 stars on food quality alone (because even below par fine dining is fine dining), but given the price and  reputation of S&D, I was expecting more and felt like I got much less.\n\nSo an unfortunate two and a half stars taking into account the entire experience.", "author": "Foodie B."}

The inside of the restaurant is small but nice.  Service was good.  \n\nOnly complaints are the following: we probably went on one of the hottest days of the year, and it was oppressively, distractingly hot (well over 80) in the restaurant.  Very hard to enjoy the food in that atmosphere.  The door was open but there were no fans, so air barely circulated into the restaurant despite it being 9-11pm and the outside temp being quite pleasant.  Probably due to the heat, it felt like it took forever to get each dish, and I really just wanted to get out of there and get some air.  The staff did accommodate our request to move closer to the door, which was nice, but it barely helped.  I know this is likely only an issue on a handful of days during the year, but still, some fans might be a good investment :)", "author": "Kristen B."}

The tasting menu is one of the more reasonably priced in the city and after 5 visits, I can state it is always fantastic.  Plus, every time we go, there is at least 1 or 2 of the wine pairings which really blow me away - just perfect compliments that make you stop and rethink what you just tasted.\n\nWhy I love this place:\n1. Not completely impossible to book! at least not for midweek bookings\n2. It is all about the customer! from the moment you arrive you are treated like royalty\n3.

Here, I will do the latter.\n\nFor my 29th birthday, my partner in crime said they were taking me to an \"undisclosed location\" -- this restaurant was kept so top secret, I was not allowed to know its name until we arrived! All I understood beforehand was that neither of us had been there prior, and that the restaurant had apparently requested how to spell my name.\n\nThat all made sense upon entering Sons and Daughters, and seeing the personalized menu, with a \"Happy Birthday Garett\" message printed at the top! Connected the dots...\n\nOnto the menu! It was a prefixed seven-course meal, almost always served upon organically shaped stones and wood carvings -- interesting in itself. My favorite servings were of the local herring with pearl onion and buttermilk, and the squab with currant and hazelnut. Exquisite!\n\nEverything else was still delicious. Appreciated the egg yolk within the consomme. The Vadouvan spices were a flavorful, unique combination with the baby beets, adding a French-curry flair. While I'm not normally a fan of \"typical\" shiitake mushrooms (which are thankfully not included!), the hedgehog mushrooms within the pork shoulder dish did not detract from the pork flavor one bit, perhaps even improving it. I do love cheesecake, but was enticed at least as much (if not more so) by the citrus curd.\n\nStellar service was provided throughout the evening. What probably elated me most was interacting with the friendly folks that were seated beside us. Not only did we all get along swell long before learning of their connection to Duckhorn Winery, but they repeatedly complemented me about who I was dating.

It should be rated ten stars. \n\nIt's better than Jean Georges, better than Corton, better than WD 50, better than Momofuku, better than anything New York Chefs are even thinking about doing right now. New York established chefs have all of the tools, produce, help, and media (crazy, crazy amounts of media). And yet, they're so boring right now. Scared of failure maybe? I know the souffl\u00e9 at Gordon Ramsey is 100% chemical. Please tell me not all CIA graduates turn into robots in a gourmet assembly line.  Whatever is driving our great chefs down, I know if they had one meal at Sons and Daughters they'd be inspired because the experience is a true wake up call.\n\nIt's so chill.

I didn't feel shy to ask about ingredients and they are very well educated in their wine list as well.\n\nTheir menu changes very often so I'm not sure if you'd be eating the same thing I did-- which was a four course meal for around $60 (rounding up).\n\nEach plate was an adventure--- some of the plating were intellectualized but it didn't leave the diner behind to really struggle with reverse engineering wtf it all meant. In other words, it was just delicious. The yummy sounds we made were obscene when we at our squab. The skin was so perfect and the flesh was perfectly rare with a very satisfying tender bite.\n\nThe only issue I had with my meal was dessert. I ordered the stone fruit one with this salty cheese and I have to say it was super weird. But I also thought it was really fun and brave. I really like that they experiment but they're not uneven. Even if it's a dish I don't really quite get I do get that each component is on it's upmost peak of deliciousness for that ingredient.\n\nYou go Sons and Daughters. You are destined for fame.

Really good stuff. \n\nThe service is where this place really fell down for me. Huge gap between the first and second courses. Timing btw. other courses was erratic.  Then, towards the end, well before we received either the palate cleanser or the final dessert course, they brought us our coffee (we still had wine pairings to go). On top of that, my coffee cup was still wet from the dishwasher (I dried it with my own napkin), and my coffee spoon was dirty.\n\nOne other weird note: they offered us a french press coffee (we said yes, for two please), but when it was served, it came in a tea/coffee pot. And instead of leaving the pot they took it away from the table after pouring our two cups (though there was clearly more left in the pot). Later they asked if we wanted a refresh, to which we said yes (assuming we were going to get whatever was left in our original pot). Instead, they took our now empty cups away, brought completely fresh ones, and then did the whole pouring mini-ceremony again. It was thoroughly confusing. Sometimes it's just ok to pour a normal coffee and leave the pot on the table (esp. when it's a pretty china pot). \n\nThis place is clearly trying, and they're nearly \"there\".

There were a number of amuses too.\n\nThe menu changes constantly. I recall enjoying each dish, especially the squab with textures of honey. Here's hoping it has a starring role sometime soon. While I could taste/see/smell that all the ingredients were outstanding, I felt that the matrimony of the ingredients in the dishes obscured the key flavors. In the foie torchon with peach and dehydrated yogurt I could not really detect any of the above's signature flavors. Ditto with the black cod/dashi/uni dish, but not so with lobster/coral/caviar dish. That was a delight.\n\nI loved the wine list. It's short and to the point, didn't overemphasize any particular region, and had some unique choices that I loved, such as a cabernet sauvignon from Lebanon, and a red txakolina which I ordered my dining companions to select. Long live Basque wine! Hope it's still there.\n\nService was very helpful and enthusiastic, with excellent taste in music (though at the time a big loud for me and my library voice.) I hear that the SF twins used to frequent the gaudy place that was here before, so I was hoping to see them around, but no. Lived here for almost ten years and still no sighting. \n\nMy more authoritative two cents is that S&D should have been included in Bauer's Top 100. It was not as refined as Commonwealth's food (at least on my early visit), but is close and by other people's accounts it seems that they've smoothed out some of the initial (and expected) flaws. \n\nDespite the snub, I expect S&D to flourish and evolve, but I hope they keep their youthful approach to great food.", "author": "Joanna M."}

Everything was perfect...from the Dungeness crab starter, the Squab, to the Pork Shoulder just to name a few.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-24", "description": "(See pics)\n\nSo I have been here twice. The first experience was so mixed I ended up keeping the draft and did not publish.\n\nExactly 6 months ago to the date, the first experience was mind-blowing delicate cuisine with the worst wine pairing. It might not be because of the wine region, but the producers.\n\n6 months later, after being told by a true wine guy, that the previous snotty wine guy no longer worked there and I finally gave it a try again and it was so good that I am ready to rave about this place.\n\nThis review consists both visits.\n\n---\nThis visit:\n\nWith wine pairing they greeted with a Prosecco. Nice touch.\n\nThe 4-course tasting menu is excellent and makes you want to have everything. Every dish had an assortment of ingredients and trumps up like a mini-symphony on each own with wine pairing that brought out each tone of the delicate dish. Some of the dishes were more substantial than the normal tasting menu and were like a main course on their own.\n\nFoie Torchon, horseradish, dried burrata chips, bronze fennel and a bit of flowers. Paired with Riesling. The foie gras pate was absolutely excellent. It was creamy chilled and softly melting in your mouth. The burrata chips was a pleasant surprise with its perfectly crunchiness on the contrast. The pairing was great with a Riesling that was not overly sugary sweet.\n\nRabbit, dandelion greens, baby fennel, Egg yolk, white strawberry. Paired with Gamay. Very smooth and subtly rich taste. The Gamay was an okay pairing.\n\nLamb, barley, fiddlehead, artichoke, king trumpets. Paired with Syrah. It was quite a bit of lamb to enjoy. The rack was more cooked than the smaller meat piece which I believe was the loin. It's juicy and very flavorful and I particularly liked the artichoke vegetables and the small barley bites. Syrah pairing perfectly matched the dish by bringing out the taste without overwhelming it. The blackberries and earthy tone made this dish a highlight of the courses, moving from a fun, lighthearted theme to a serious and drawing your attention.\n\nAll the desserts are still savory ingredients but with a sweet tone, totally inventive and charming.\n\nCandy cap mushroom cake, black truffle ice cream, porcini strips, cinnamon, caramel, Douglas fir. Paired with Vin Santo. Such an enchanting and stealing your heart dessert. The sweet ending of Vin Santo, generally served as a dessert on its own, totally infused with the cake.\n\nThis time they did not serve sugar cane style for the coffee but did heated up the ceramic mug for the coffee. This itself easily tells you this wonderful place focuses on every detail of the experience, and not just the food itself.\n\nDid not try my friend's dishes but they all looked very pretty.\n\n-----\n\nFirst visit: perfect food but the super sugary wines made the food less enjoyable.\n\nWines to pair: Chenin Blanc, Riesling Spatlese and Pinot.\n\nRaw oyster amuse bouche: with cucumber juice was absolutely stunning and refreshing in a beautiful stone bowl seated on a bed of sea salt as garnish.\n\nRaw lobster tail with lime basil, pomegranate caviar was beautifully made, delicate and translucent. The little caviar was a nice touch but did not add any real taste. The pomegranate was a great compliment even I generally don't like the hard crunchiness.\n\nThe beet soup with marjoram and creme fraiche was very tasty. Rich fushcia color and the creme fraiche was excellent bringing out the taste.\n\nSeared foie with green apple ginger oats was refreshing and clean little apple mini strips were perfect chasers after each rich bite of the light foie gras. The oats was a clever texture and just magically brought out the dish. Pumpkin can be challenging to be part of a main course but they baked a delicious light honey top and a nice chewy bottom. I absolutely love the textures. The ginger definitely brought the taste to dance!\n\nSquab breast Confit leg Pate Pear Hazelnut Shallot: the squab was very nicely done with the skin browned and very lightly sweetened. The hazelnut (cream and crumble) was perfect with the confit leg. The pear with brown onions, eaten together, was a good palate cleanser. The pate was on the lighter and velvet taste.\n\nLamb loin Cheek Barley Tobacco Quail egg.  The lamb loin was perfect medium rare, super juicy. sprouts and what we believed was the tobacco leaves were a great touch.\n\nWhile we were surprised by every dish, it did not stop at the dessert.\n\nApple pear crumbler with foie chantilly gave you the warm fuzzy feeling. Yes foie with chantilly to give you savory and the sweet chantilly cream were just incredible.\n\nThe chocolate truffle cake with mint ice cream and pistachio with the cake that tasted more like flourless cake. The mint ice cream was such a wonderful pick me up with a small kick of pistachio.\n\nVerve coffee from Santa Cruz, a more rustic taste and that little sugar on a wooden stick was a nice touch.\n\nThis place was very New York style, black and beige tone, yet all ingredients are very Californian.", "author": "T L."}

But my rating is 4 stars. \n\nAfter our experience, my advice is to be more mindful of your meal's pacing than we were. Sons & Daughters serves dishes that are very good to excellent, but a notable seasonal tasting menu requires a lot, and patience by the customer is one of them. So go there and throw down some do-re-mi.\n\nUnfortunately in our case, and this was dumb of me, I delayed the start of our dinner. For some reason, street parking seemed like a \"must\" before a meal that I knew would cost me over $300. Pretty dumb, right? \n\nCompounding that serious error in perspective was my (our) failure to alert anyone in Sons & Daughters that we had tickets to a show later that night. Our dinner cruised at a Continental pace, which is slow by American standards, and ended a bit over 2 hours. We watched as other tables got their courses more quickly and left earlier, and heard conversation that indicated S&D's understanding of their after-dinner plans.\n\nOK, you have my opinions and mistakes.

It was stunning. \n\nS&D has a Michelin star.  We wanted a place to  satiate our lust for a memorable holiday dinner.  They also had space at 930.  It seemed like a straightforward relationship.\n\nUnfortunately the $550 bill for three was wildly out of proportion to the actual quality of the food. \n\nIt was a tasting menu, so obviously portions will be small.  But for that price you expect at least a few of the plates to be MY FUCKING GOD CAN I HAVE ANOTHER!?  And they weren't.  The only things I really liked were (1) the bread (2) the butter and (3) the wine, which we bought ourselves.   There was an interesting use of bitterness that threaded throughout the dishes, but that bit of off-the-beaten-path exploration couldn't compensate for the fact that the food just wasn't that good.\n\nTo be fair, the chef was off that night due to a new baby (if I understood the waitress correctly) but still, even the seasoning was all over the place.  \n\nI wasn't going to write a review since the staff were actually pleasant and seemed like nice people.  But looking at the receipt the stupidly insulting $40 corkage fee and the $21 coffee makes me feel I have to warn others.\n\nIf you want a Michelin one-star I'd say go to Commis.

I never pay much attention to service but when service is this good, and the waiters are that professional and considerate, you can't help but soak in the experience.

(Heck, I even have a hard time naming my favourite type of cuisine.) Many of them are good, some are mediocre, only a handful are great. But after a dinner at Sons & Daughter, I now have an answer--at least in the contemporary American, fancy-but-won't-burn-a-hole-in-your-wallet category. \n\nSadly, my passion for eating has also made me somewhat jaded when it comes to dining out, especially at fine dining restaurants. Sons & Daughters was like a breath of fresh air. I honestly can't praise it enough. Care is put into each component of every dish--the way the ingredients are cooked, the seasonings, the play of textures, and the presentation were all impeccable. The novel combinations of flavours and ingredients in the dishes were delectable and so inspiring. I savoured every morsel and didn't want my meal to end.\n\nTheir menu is simple: 4 courses with a choice of 3 dishes for each. The 4-course tasting menu is an incredible deal at just $48 but everything is also available a la carte. Since ordering the whole menu at a restaurant has always been a fantasy of mine, my mom and I got two prix fixe plus two dishes a la carte. (Ok, so we didn't get EVERYTHING on the menu, but 10 out of 12--that's 83%!--is pretty close.)\n\n*BEETS with bergamot ice cream, goat cheese, broccoli (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=haHCQEefiboDhW1oLaF8bw): Beets are beets. What made this dish special were the refreshing bergamot ice cream, the meyer lemon gel, and the creamy yet somewhat gelatinous goat cheese that really complemented the beets.\n\n*CREAM OF PARSLEY ROOT SOUP with black trumpet, maitake, and enoki mushrooms (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=Q6V93t7HyRUTNq0ikVznIA): Creamy and flavourful. Loved the textures the mushrooms added to the soup, especially the fried enoki.\n\n*FOIE TORCHON with apple, horseradish, burrata (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=2ODv7nuLjoJ5yZ8F2hM_Zg): The apple gelatin provided just the right amount of sweetness and tartness to balance out the saltiness and richness of the foie. Genius!\n\n*ABALONE with burdock root puree, celery, salsify, olives (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=Hd2jNDL_Secn4wuyf7hwKg): Fresh and perfectly cooked abalone paired beautifully with the crunchy and aromatic shaved celery and creamy burdock puree.\n\n*KABOCHA SQUASH with hedgehog mushroom, rapini, dried fruit (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=sPvO0RJPkF-KzcYEPx_-eQ): The squash acted as the perfect vehicle for the even better accompaniments--the combination of pungent rapini, earthy mushrooms, and sweet & tangy raisins was greater than the sum of its parts.\n\n*VEAL TONGUE with brussels sprouts, cipollini onion, arugula pancetta spices (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=54c0BCc0KFFnlLwT9aUVYg): Unquestionably my favourite of the appetizers. The veal tongue was flavourful, fatty, and melt-in-your-mouth tender. Its richness was offset by the tangy and crunchy pickled cipollini onions. Brussels sprouts added a lovely slightly bitter note.\n\n*SQUAB BREAST with confit leg, pate, pear, hazelnut, shallot (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=1-OAuVicgGsHoZpyUBS_UA): Sous vide then seared, this beautifully cooked squab breast was some of the best I've ever had - moist, tender, and flavourful. The crunchy crushed hazelnuts, creamy hazelnut butter, and sweet juicy pear worked surprisingly well with the squab. The best part of the dish was the exceptionally flavourful pate (made from squab liver, kidney, and heart); I couldn't get enough!\n\n*WAGYU ZABUTON STEAK with chicory, yogurt, turnip (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=vBftdBi4fo4j4eL1QNfR8w): The sous vide steak was incredibly decadent--fatty, flavourful, and so tender, but still had a nice \"crust\" from searing. The beef was seasoned with ground coffee, which added another really interesting--and tasty!--dimension to the dish.

It was delicious, refined, complex, and very light.\nI enjoyed the crunchy, bitter mustard seeds, the hints of tarragon, and rye crumble.\n-The fennel seed soup was buttery and aromatic.\nI loved how the bitter leaves inside were peppery and bitter.\nSome of the pickled roots while pleasant, had too much of an acidic presence.\n-The charred endive pasta resembled more like Chinese wontons and potstickers.\nThe fatty oils it was coated in was heavy, but it was delicious.\nI was very impressed with the layering of acidic and bitter flavors.\n-The braised chanterelles were generally delicious albeit controversial at our table.\nI loved the mushrooms and the buttery yukon potato.\nWe were on the fence about a more harsh vinegary sauce that we weren't sure worked for us.\n-The squab with marcona almond butter was very comfortable and delicious.\nThe meat was rich and intense.\nThere was a wonderful sweeter almond butter that reminded me of a lighter peanut butter. \n-The chestnut ice cream and chocolate ganache desserts were pretty good but not great.\nI didn't find them to have the same level of innovation or simply as delicious as the savory courses.  \nI felt although they weren't bad, they were certainly the weakest link to our dinner.\n\nValue is reasonable, not bad, but not great.\nAt $135 for a 8 course tasting, the price is a tad higher than average but the 6 savory courses were impressive enough where I felt more than justified the asking price. \n\nService was good.  \nThe staff were friendly, informative, and professional.\nPacing of the courses was notably consistent and brisk, we never had to wait more than a few minutes between courses.\n\nAmbiance is very pleasant and comfortable.\nIt feels like you're dining in an upscale and cozy house with some subtly modern touches.\nThe ventilation isn't optimal but it isn't uncomfortable either.\n\n-Pics of interior\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sons-and-daughters-san-francisco?select=mfsKPLMwt5bT2dd79jKwsw#hfzJE6JDZ0eiqp7Ers4Ejw\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sons-and-daughters-san-francisco?select=mfsKPLMwt5bT2dd79jKwsw#hfzJE6JDZ0eiqp7Ers4Ejw\n\nDetailed Review will look more into individual dishes.\nThere will be a few 'updates'  that might be difficult to see with a smartphone.\n\n***Detailed Review\n\n-buttermilk cracker with sea grape and salmon roe (Dish Rating, 83%)\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sons-and-daughters-san-francisco?select=mfsKPLMwt5bT2dd79jKwsw#TP-gKY5VCqJXh04sLax9sA\n\nThis was our amuse course.  The 'buttermilk cracker' seemed to resemble more of rice cracker and might have been dusted with a seaweed powder.  This offered more salty briney flavors from the seaweed and juicy salmon roe.  I found the saltiness to be generally pleasant.  The sea grapes used were quite sour and almost bitter.  The bitter flavors seemed most prevalent, although the texture of the sea grapes less apparent.\n\nThe cracker itself was generally light and crunchy, lending more texture than taste.  It wasn't a bad amuse course, being more interesting than delicious, yet quite comfortable as well.\n\n1) Hamachi.  Salad burnet and caviar. (Dish Rating, 84%)\n\n-Pic;\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sons-and-daughters-san-francisco?select=mfsKPLMwt5bT2dd79jKwsw#jEWXsgGp9KbeHnN_uk-vGw\n\nThis was dish of raw yellowtail belly with some sterling sturgeon caviar on top, submerged with a dashi broth.  The flavors were focused and worked well together.  There doesn't seem to be a lot of ingredients at work, but everything transitions elegantly.  The focus appears to be the fish.  I found the fish to be fatty, and sweet.  It was tasty and delicious by itself.\n\nThe condiments are nice.  The caviar's flavor is fairly robust.  The caviar's flavor blends in well with the fish, giving it a slight briny and subtly fishy presence.  Towards the end of the flavor notes, the dashi broth seems a bit sweet and savory.  There was also an interesting herbal presence from the 'salad burnet' leaves I couldn't identify.  It seemed very subtly minty.\n\nTo be continued, please refer to 'earlier review'", "author": "Adrian Robert H."}

I do have one piece of criticism but don't want to take away any stars because this place is top notch. \n\nI have a dairy allergy. We called ahead to let them know, and they were ready and promised to take care of me. Upon presenting the menu, the server proudly pointed out that they had made soy ice cream just for me. That was classy, and made me feel like I was in for a great meal.\n\nUnfortunately, the dairy accommodations ended there. For the rest of the meal, their solution to my allergy was to just delete yummy stuff from my meal (sauces, garnishes, toppings) and replace it with nothing. This included the three bread servings, which were given to my date while I got nothing. For someone who loves bread, that was a big disappointment.\n\nWhen you're paying over $100 for a meal, you expect better. I've dined at Manresa and received a dairy-free meal that was lacking in nothing compared to the regular preparations. It can be done.\n\nI hope the folks at Sons and Daughters read this and think about making a stronger effort to give allergy sufferers a meal that meets their high standards.", "author": "Joe H."}

It's that good.\n\nFirst course: soup [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=g1EpHc6N7d4ls_2ke0NElA] and foie torchon [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=XvE2p0z5Ai7_30Yi3TYbvw] - $5 supplement.  The soup was really thick and creamy, too much for my taste.  Didn't stop me from slurping it down to the last drop, though.  *piggy*\n\nSecond course: abalone [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=LOZbT4-6mZSPUJMdM-zQNw] and veal tongue [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=MD8tPM9pO-YurjHjhVXc4A].

My other friends who know their food loved this place, so I'm glad I got to come back and try it again because it really was so much better the second time around!  \n \nFirst off, they had a personalized menu printed for me for my birthday and started us off with champagne, which was a nice touch.   We went with the wine pairings, which were all pretty interesting.\n \n- Amuse: salmon roe on a puffed chip in the style of a chicarron. I love the saltiness of roe and the feeling when it pops in your mouth, and the chip was a nice contrast for texture. This was served with sparkling wine\n- Scallop: lightly poached (pretty much raw), very sweet and fresh, served wit puffed quinoa and an uni cream. The uni cream was very rich, but it the scallop itself was very light, so it went well together. This was served with a sauvignon blanc (Chateau la Rame, 2013, Bordeaux)\n- Bread service: with Strauss butter whipped with yogurt. The breads were all served warm and included a thick toast, a caramelized onion and poppyseed sourdough, and a pretzel roll. All of them were really good, but the first toast really stood out for me\n- Roasted baby beets: with Greek yogurt, a hint of curry from Vadouvan spices, and nice crunch from mustard seeds. I personally love beets, so I really liked this dish. It came with a dry riesling\n- Sunchoke: sunchoke chips and an amazingly fragrant sunchoke consomme with black garlic veal sweetbreads and chanterelles. I don't usually love sweetbreads (texture and flavor), but the sweetbreads weren't bad, and sunchoke part was really good. It was paired with a sherry, which I thought was random because I've never had sherry in the middle of a meal, but it worked well\n- Pork: served 2 ways with a super tender loin and then pork nelly. The tenderloin had a ton of flavor, and I love the fall flavors of kale, apples, and pearl onions.  This was served with a Barbera from Alba\n- Chicken: it was a chicken breast roulade with a nice smoked flavor (yes, I prefer breast over thigh..), served with black burgundry truffles and a runny egg yolk burried in the center of the plate. The chicken was done very well and was not dry at all. This came with a syrah\n- Lemon curd with bartlet pear ice, lime, and basil: this was a great palate cleanser\n- Persimmon cake with creme fraiche mousse and a persimmon sorbet with toffee and mint. Again, there are lots of fall flavors, and I this dessert wasn't overly sweet and was well balanced in terms of textures. It was served with a Russian River valley viognier\n \nThey even ended my meal with a birthday candle, which was a nice touch.  Coffee was also nice and strong (french press and tea only, no espresso).\n \nI'm so glad I got to come back another time because it more than made up for my first visit!", "author": "Marilyn T."}

My friends and I had planned to dine at Sons & Daughters for months now, and of course, they raised their prices from $98pp to $135 (service included) two days before we were actually able to dine there! Our menu consisted of:\n\n-Buttermilk Chip, Trout Roe, Dill, Green Onion Salt: Good, but the tangy buttermilk overpowered the other flavors. I liked the crunch of the chip though.\n-Hickory Smoked Five Scallop, Sturgeon Caviar, Quail Bush: Delicious! One of my favorite dishes. The scallop was perfectly cooked, and you could taste the smokiness of the hickory.\n-Cured Fort Bragg Sea Urchin and Local Seasonal Seaweed in a Vinaigrette: The sea urchin was super fresh, but I didn't enjoy the crunchiness of the seaweed.\n-Fennel Soup w/its Own Pollen, Radish and Bitter Leaves: Another one of my fave dishes. The soup was really creamy, and the radish gave the soup a nice contrasting texture.\n-Roasted Baby Beets, Yogurt, Vadouvan and Pickled Mustard Seeds: Eh.. just ok. I usually love beets, but didn't think this dish was that great.\n-Grilled Monterey Abalone, Artichoke, Castelvetrano: Meh. The abalone was.. good.. but.. I wouldn't order this dish again if given an option. The taste of the artichoke took over the other components.\n-Chanterelle Mushrooms, Black Garlic, Yukon Gold Potato: Again, ok. I love chanterelle mushrooms, but they didn't have enough salt, or seasoning, or creaminess, or something. The potatoes were also missing seasoning, and not as tender/fluffy as I'm used to for a Yukon Gold. \n-Seared Squab, Orange, Marcona Almond Puree: Best dish of the night! The squab was perfectly cooked, and I loved the puree.\n-Andante Goat Cheese, Prune, Coffee, Winter Greens: Eh. I would have preferred if they served the cheese with a slice of toast, or some sort of carb. The cheese tasted good with the prune reduction and winter greens, but I wasn't a fan of just eating pieces of the cheese.\n-Fermented Pear and Fresh Chestnut: Eh.. ok.. but not really my cup of tea.\n-Young Eucalyptus Steeped in Dark Cocoa w/Agastache Ice Cream: Not very tasty. I don't think any of us really ENJOYED the dessert since the eucalyptus taste was so overpowering, and not in a good way. It was a shame since you could tell they used really good chocolate and the texture was nice and silky.\n-Bread Served in 3 Courses Throughout the Meal: I think the first was a buckwheat? bread, which was pretty good and came out warm. Then came a sourdough, which was very dense, and on the bland side. Lastly we had a pretzel bread, which was also on the dense side, and not very good. \n\nMy biggest gripe is: What is the deal with chefs trying to use all these crazy ingredients in their dishes that make them taste worse?? I understand being unique/memorable, but you don't want to be remembered for ruining dishes (ex. the horrible eucalyptus chocolate dessert)! Honestly, I think chefs should cater to the 95% of normal folks who enjoy a dish cooked well with day-to-day ingredients versus the 5% who want to try something \"new\" and \"inventive\". The majority of people don't use fermented pear to cook with at home for a reason! /endrant\n\nAside from my disappointment with the food, I did like the ambiance (albeit a bit on the quiet side) and the mod decor. The kitchen is an open kitchen, but you won't be able to see much depending on where your seated. The service was very efficient and accommodating, and they ask if you have any allergies or foods you don't like when you start the meal. Parking can be difficult in this area, but there are options on the side streets. \n\nOverall, I didn't feel the food was worth my $135 (before taxes), and agree with other reviewers that there should be more proteins (we did not opt for the vegetarian menu for a reason!). Unless I see an amazing menu online when they shift to the next season, I don't think I'll be back.", "author": "Amy D."}

Our waiter Deontre and Hostess and Sommonilar was very friendly, warm and easy to talk to, not making us feel too uncomfortable as some more formal establishments can do.\n\nEach meal was delicious...full of impact with powerful flavors with each bit.  The bites are a bit on the small side but with accompanied with the wine paring option, it can be filling.  \n\nOur first dish was the amoush boush.....almost like a shrimp chip with creme fresh, fresh popping roe and a basil leaf to cleanse the palate.

With using these types of preparations, I would have enjoyed explanations from our waiter on how things were prepared and unique.  Some dishes had the foam that stood out but besides that it was hard to tell.\n\nUsually we're the ones that order less food and stay away from Pris fix menus and leave some on our plates but here we were just hungry and wanting more.  The plates are very small tasting portions and even the entree selections are small, to the point of you really just get 3 bites and it's gone.  For the price this just didn't seem worth it, a $24 lamb dish needs to have a bit more dish to it.\n\nWe began with ala carte selections and ended up getting the tasting menu to satisfy our appetite yet I was still wanting more.  The food is definitely fresh but not overly rich, everything felt light and preparation was for the most part well executed.\n\nSome things that stood out was the sweetbreads and arctic char tartar, the flavors were balanced, unique and exceptionally well blended together. Every bite was amazing and left you wanting more.\n\nThe salad, lamb, and risotto was just OK as far as we were concerned.  There was nothing special here, no bold or unique flavors.  The salad was too acidic for my taste, the risotto was a bit on the watery side and the squash in it was chunky and didn't complement the texture but fought it.  \n\nThe finale was a chocolate cake with mint ice cream and coffee.  The cake was dry and poorly made, it tasted like something out of a box.  The ice cream was amazing, home made and you really tasted the fresh mint. \n\nThe coffee was served in mugs, I found this completely lacking in class and ambiance for this place, I would have also enjoyed a nice espresso if they had a machine.  \n\nSome dishes were good and some completely missed the mark for me and with the prices, I feel I could go to many other places and walk away more satisfied and impressed.", "author": "Inga W."}

I love that their menu shows every single ingredient that may be featured in your dish and it seems like the menu is constantly changing to go with what's in season. Service is excellent and every single dish we had was consistently good. Most restaurants, there's always a few standout dishes and a few meh dishes. I def. prefer a place where every single dish was consistently good, no matter what it was.

Regardless of whether diners order the menu or select individual entr\u00e9es, all portions are mercilessly miniscule.\n\nFennel soup with morels and kale was deep and rich in flavor, the crispiness of the sauteed sweet woodruff topping playing against the smoothness of the fennel velout\u00e9e.  The starkness of a tiny rackof rabbit with dandelion greens was removed by the addition of sweet fraise de bois (wild strawberries).  While tasty, the arctic char with sun choke, turnip, tarragon, and potatoes seemed rather pedestrian in comparison to the other dishes.\n\nWhile the wine list has a balanced selection of not unreasonably priced (for The City) Old and New World wines, the real treat is the wine pairing (quite expensive for tasting sized pours at $42).\n\nService was knowledgeable and attentive, a good thing since the menu is so ambiguously written that diners will need an interpretation to actually understand what each dish really is.\n\nSons and Daughters is high on execution, taste, and service, but low on value.

Overall, recommended.\n\nSome thoughts:\n- I made the reservation very far in advance via OpenTable, and I mentioned in the notes field it was for my wife's birthday. Apparently they got the memo because there was a \"Happy Birthday from Sons & Daughters\" card on the table when we were seated. Nice touch.\n- An extension of that was impeccable service. Detailed, non-rushed, attentive, and all around fantastic (with one small exception, see below). \n- They have an alternate 8 course tasting menu for vegetarians. We didn't need that, but probably a great option for some. \n- Standout dishes include the green garlic soup with marin mussels (packed full of flavor), kampachi crudo style with lime kosho (phenomenal), and the asparagus in quail consomme w/ quail egg (also incredibly flavorful). \n\nWhy not 5 stars?:\n- Dudes, do you have to be that stingy with the pour on the wine pairing?  Not expecting overflowing glasses here, but I mean... out of this style/caliber of restaurant, seemed a little thin for what you're paying for the pairing add-on. And if I happen to mention that I'm really loving one, how bout just a little more?\n- I felt like the tasting menu lost some steam the more it went on. Lots of the best dishes were in the front half, with some of the less-memorable stuff coming in the second half. \n- Didn't love the squab dish with pistachio and fennel, which unfortunately was the last savory course. \n- The person serving the wine -- who was quite nice -- brought us the previously mentioned asparagus in quail consomme dish. She compared the taste to a Big Mac. Like, from McDonalds. For reals!\n\nLast thought: \n- Seen some people take issue with the food here being too small/too light overall. Personally I really liked that aspect of Sons & Daughters because you don't feel over-the-top stuffed. 8 courses + bread, and I felt a perfect kind of full.", "author": "George C."}

Plus some seafood and an awesome piece of squab.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the food itself was tasty... each dish was met with enthusiasm from each guest, but for some reason, I felt like it just wasn't satisfying enough.  I'm not even a huge meat-eater but looking back on our meal, I feel like there could have been a bit more to it.  Most of our dishes consisted of REALLY GOOD vegetables (from the Sons & Daughters garden) that were beautifully presented but most of the diners at our table left somewhat unsatisfied and wanting a bit more.  \n\nWhat really made the meal was the staff here, the ambience, and all the stuff that came in between the courses.  I loved the simple and earthy design of the restaurant from the fireplace to the tree bark coasters.  I also loved how unpretentious this place was - even the MUZAK which awesome.  I remember being in the bathroom and thinking, \"ooh, I love this song!\"  The atmosphere was great.  It's a mixed crowd but I definitely could have come in with sneakers and jeans and that wouldn't have been a problem.

I think of S&D as the place where you go if you really are into food - the dishes might not be as accessible to people who want to be blown away with big proportions and wild flavors. It's more subtle, though, at times felt a little scripted.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-13", "description": "Sons and Daughters offered one of the best dining experiences I've had.  I liked its philosophy behind eating locally and its strong emphasis on details on both aesthetics and tastes,  and on creative control from the kitchen (tasting menu only, no a la carte).\n\nTo start, I loved the look of the menu.  Unlike traditional descriptions of dishes, each plate is described with names of four ingredients listed with no punctuation: \n\nEgg  Bottarga  Baby Bok Choy  Dill\nFoie  Blood Orange  Oat  Geranium\n\nThe method with which you order is just as simple and poetic: 10 dishes, 5 courses, you pick one of the two.  In fact, if you came with a date, you can pretty much toss the menu and say \"we will get everything.\"\n\nThe dishes may sound very minimalist with 4 ingredient descriptions, the actual plates are far from being simple.  Many are adorned with edible flowers and fresh herbs/veggies in season from the Chef's mom's garden.   Unlike Benu (Another favorite of mine that serves modern and innovative California cuisine) that shows a lot of Zen and restraint, Sons and Daughters' dishes often remind me of walking into a Spring garden in full bloom.  Colorful, vibrant, celebratory, chaotic but harmonic all at the same time.  \n\nDon't be afraid to ask the waitstaff questions on what exactly you are eating.  Many questions come with many interesting answers.  We learned about the hay ash they use to darken the sauce and add earthiness.  Who knew you can throw some hay in the fire and eat that?  \n\nAnother feature of the restaurant that I really enjoyed was the bread courses: I am glad that they don't consider themselves too fancy for bread.  Considering how difficult it is to make perfect bread, I wish more restaurants would take them seriously and include them in their menus.  I also like that the breads were portioned small so they were meant to be enjoyed, and not as afterthought stuffers. \n\nMy two favorite dishes of the night were probably the farm egg and bok choy and the sea urchin and pickled cauliflower.  Great ingredients, great flavors.  The meats like the venison and squab were also done really well. Tender, not tough. \n\nThe prices are fair ($86 for 5 course menu) and service efficient and well paced.  The location of the restaurant is sort of between Nob Hill and Union Square where parking wasn't too difficult.", "author": "Candice B."}

The details escape me but it was oh so very good. And remembering a dish after two years? Now that's saying something. \n\nAnyhow the most recent visit was the third part to my Xmas present (THANK YOU BF!!!) and it was superb. We made reservations and were seated as soon as we arrived (make reservations! I saw a couple parties turned away bc they didn't have one). We were then presented with our own personalized tasting menus- such a nice little touch :) \n\nAs everyone mentioned, the bread here is the best bread you'll ever have. And it's paired with this yogurt butter that is so soft, creamy, and spreadable. Yum! Our server even gave us an extra serving of our favorite bread! \n\nDishes that stood out- the hamachi & caviar... need I say more!? The squab was cooked perfectly! Very rich and flavorful but not overbearing at all. \n\nThe dessert listed was one with chocolate and since both my bf and I have a strong aversion toward chocolate, the kitchen cooked up an alternative dessert! So nice that they gave us that option :) I don't remember exactly what was in it (writing this review has made me realize what terrible memory I have...) but it was very very good and a perfect end to our meal. Just remember, if you have any allergies or even simple aversions, S&D will gladly accommodate your needs. \n\nWhile the price for the tasting menu has increased, its still completely worth it. And while each dish might seem small, it all adds up- we were so stuffed by the end of our meal!

In the case of Sons & Daughters, the conversation has nothing to do with sustenance and you'll find yourself not even regarding each bite as food, pulling back from the table, looking around at others wondering if they are experiencing the same thing, perhaps leaning your chair back on two legs balancing.  Tastes pulse electric and you can't do anything except make that face that says \"Oh my\" and wait for the next dish.\n\nThe 5-course menu was well worth the price, starting in order: quail egg, sea urchin, wild boar, NY steak, and then the utterly rambunctious and masterly chocolate dessert.  My favorite portion of the evening was of the wild boar, however, the nicest personal touch you'll notice is the different array of breads individually delivered in between.  \n\nOne can enjoy and brag about meals taken at Danko or Boulevard or La Folie or Quince...these are restaurants where you have an army of wait staff and machine-like precision chefs churning out dishes...yes, the food is amazingly delicious at each of these, but Sons & Daughters manages to make you feel as if you're at home and all of a sudden your mother is one of the greatest cooks in the world, but, like a splash of cold water on your face, you turn and glance over at the kitchen and see a bunch of guys toiling away.  \n\nIt's like that scene in Big Night when, after the meal, one of the female guests is sobbing and saying \"My mother was such a terrible cook\"...yeah, it's like that, but better in its own way.", "author": "Eric H."}

We were running late from the opera and they were awesome about it. We were created as we arrived with smiles and asking how the opera was and who was the birthday girl so they could personally wish her a happy birthday. We were seated and at the table by the door with a full view of the kitchen and all the wonders it creates. We were then given our menus that had Happy Birthday Mary on them, just a special personal touch that mean a lot. We then had a quick glance at the drink menu and decided on some champagne. Then the food started coming. Now I have seen reviews about the price or not getting enough food, A) where else can you order 7 delicious items for under $100 and B) none of us left hungry we could barely get up to leave we were stuffed to perfection with food! It would take way too long to go over each of the 7 courses but let's just say non disappointed. They all had layers or unique flavors that blended into the perfect bite! I will be going back for the amazing staff, great service and wonderful food!  Thanks for making it a great night!", "author": "Kathy W."}

The Front and Back of House do a wonderful job to maintain the wonderful service without being pretentious. The open kitchen is a tiny space that just adds to my amazement that these wonderful foods come from a space so small.\n\nThe dining room is not the white table clothed restaurant one would normally associate with a well respected restaurant. Instead it is what I feel is an intelligently stripped down version of what a classic dining room is. The bare tables and minimally adorned floor  hint at the San Francisco architecture that has become iconic in and of itself.\n\nLet's talk about the food shall we? I thought, when looking at the menu, that it was a straightforward tasting menu where you choose which of the two options in each course you would like to receive. Looking at the menu it seemed quite obvious that one was the safe option and the other was the challenging one. Thank you S&D for proving me wrong. Thank you for playing with my expectations and giving me and my dining companion one surprise after another. An example would be the foie gras course we received. Reading the menu I thought it would be an earthy and warm rendition, but instead it was a cold and refreshing dish where the foie gras was not the flavorful star but the textural binding. \n\nThe Front of House staff was excellent, informative, and not pressured by the expected routine of a high end restaurant. There was some very casual descriptions of the wines, occasionally the staff would take a casual standing stance or lean by the wall next to our table as they would tell us about our courses or wines. The laid back attitude was a shockingly welcomed surprise that started when I was in their waiting room tucked behind the dining room. When I entered the room I was welcomed not by jazz or classical music, but by Naughty by Nature's \"Hip Hop Hurrray\" and some other 90's hip hop classics.\n\nSons and Daughters takes expectations and turns them upon themselves. There's definitely something to be said about every aspect, but who has the time? The Chefs have definitely made a fan out of me. Can't wait to see what turns up with Sweet Woodruff.", "author": "Jay V."}

Along with Atelier Creme one of the most innovative, creative places in SF.\n\nAtmosphere is really nice.  Casual elegance.   Holds on to some of the feel from Mozart Cafe which it replaced while updating the look.   Felt like a special place to dine without being stuffy.  Open kitchen allows you to see all the action, but  its understated presence doesn't require you to if you don't want Only quibble might be that its small enough space so that there is no way to shield the draft that inevitably comes through the front door.  Best advice would be to ask for a seat away from it.\n\nMenu is pre fixe and has multiple small courses.  You get a choice of two in each course.  Many of the courses have adventurous ingredients which I love, but others may find challenging.  If so they can opt for the Vegetarian option which is equally creative and good.     \n\nThe food was exceptional in presentation, freshness, balance, creativity and choice of ingredients.   Not one miss in the menu.   I would go into it course by course but the menu changes almost weekly so chances are you wont get what I had.  One of the lovely touches I haven't experienced since dining in Tokyo  is bread pairings with the courses including desert, really fun.  Also they have more than one Amuse Bouche which feels like Christmas several days in a row , or maybe more like Hanukkah :).\n\nHighly suggest going with the wine pairings.   It is totally worth the price.  The pours are very generous (so much so you should take a cab home if you can), and the selections were very unusual and went perfectly with the courses.\n\nService was great as well.  you can tell the staff really enjoys themselves and works well together.   \n\nReally nice experience.", "author": "Robert G."}

It's not mentioned in the menu, a gift from the chef, presented on a plate though it could have been served on a spoon as an amuse buche. \n\nbetween the garden greens and the first course they served a bit of bread and butter. and as we later learn they brought out different kinds of breads and butters between courses. \n\n1st course-  Foie Blood Orange Oats Geranium- a modest helping of foie, with blood orange coat on top was a great way to ease into our night ahead.  the blood orange added a sweetness to the foie which i found refreshing. not mentioned on the menu is the celery sorbet that comes with it. it's a nice cool taste but i'm not the biggest fan of celery.\n\n2nd course- Sea Urchin Cauliflower Dashi Sea Beans- the menu description didn't do it justice. its much more than it is listed. this dish looked like a top chef quick fire. the thoughts put behind this dish were thorough. all components of the dish went well together and if the evening to follow were anything like this, it was a delicious foreshadowing.\n\n3rd course- Wild boar Apple Hay Pink peppercorn- hit the spot. up to this point i was craving something that i couldn't quite describe. as it turns out i was wanderlusting for some chewing. lets not forget that chewing is how we connect with out food. the first two course were soft and didn't need any chewing whatsoever. i was so happy when the wild boar came. this game meat had a crunch on the first bite followed by a tender savory second bite. \n\n4th course- Venison Hedgehog mushrooms Brussel sprouts- seared and left rare, the venison had a hint of savory sweetness with every bite that had me coming back for more. game recognize game and this meat was prepared with me in mind. \n\n*Kumquat Yogurt Citrus Mint - another gift from the chef, again served on a plate that could have been served on a spoon. a palate cleanser that prepared the tongue for the dessert to come.\n\n5th course Chocolate Salted caramel Milk Hazelnut- the exclamation point to the meal. a warm, soft, gooey, chocolate that brings sweet and salty together. \n\nThe meal was delicious my compliments to the chef. the price tag was a little high compared to other similar restaurants. the portions were just enough for the multiple courses. i could have passed on the bread and butter between the courses. a less patient patron may find it a little portion but i found it filling when all is said and done. reservation at 8:30pm and left around 11pm. it was a delicious journey.\n\nuntil next time\n\ncheers!", "author": "Jerico P."}

The chandeliers are a great touch as are the black and white photos. Everyone that works there is super friendly and nice, it reminds me more of an LA spot (even compared to the Mission dist. it was LA seeming which = good thing). The music was odd, SO PLEASE CHANGE IT! It started off with this soft funk and then switched to 90s rock and then went to Bowie, it was obviously on a cd changer and it needed more focus. Find a theme and stick with it. It was odd going from soft and soothing to loud rock. \n\n   I' m astonished as to how anyone can handle going up and down those darn stairs with a tub full of dirty dishes, it was bothering me just watching folks have to do it yet I suppose with the size constraints and the cute open kitchen its the way it has to be -- \n\nBoth amuse bouches were lovely as was my tasty curds and way salad, and the risotto main course, I can't remember the app. but it wasn't too too memorable. The chocolate cake was like a thick brownie that had been taken out of a fridge for an hour to soften up (not a fan) however the bread pudding was super good. \n\nIf we had skipped the dessert wines, which easily racked up an extra $40 it would have remained reasonable and worth it but it somehow seemed just a tad bit too much in the end. \n\nI'd go back.

I thought it was going to be too 'gastro' for me, but I ended up enjoying all the unique combinations per meal. The attention to detail, flavors and presentation were phenomenal.

If you check out my other reviews my top meals of the year came from the spring menu at David Kinch's Manresa and Ludo's Trois Mec...but Sons & Daughters I argue holds down the fort in tasting menu exquisiteness and perfection. Everything was perfect and together enlightened my experience leading to an outstanding meal. The true highlights for me: three fresh loaves of bread, marvelous baby beets that was complemented by wonderful spices, a moist moist chicken is to die for and S&D got it perfect, great portion of lamb and the best dessert I've ever had. The strawberry with polenta and coriander is simply a god. Maybe strawberry is my favorite fruit so I'm super biased...but I know a lot of people who love it too and if they tried Sons and Daughters' they would agree completely. Truly a special experience for me...my mom who is really hard to please also really loved the meal and thought the wine pairing was spot on. Really fantastic service as well, and the kitchen signed a copy of the menu for me too (: Thanks for the superb experience S&D, keep cookin'!", "author": "Sean L."}

Sons & Daughters was recommended to me by a friend who said the food was great, the prices were not yet too high, and the vibe was unpretentious.  I must agree with him because it is all true.  \n\nI didn't do the wine pairing because we had drinks beforehand and I knew that I wouldn't be able to handle the 6-7 wines they poured.  Instead I got a glass of the Pinot that they paired with the duck dish and it was delicious.  My friends got the wine pairing ($58), some of the pairings were spot on, others I thought were a little askew.  The sommolier was super cute and gave some very generous pours.\n\nThe meal itself was quite long (we didn't sit down until 930pm and so we were a tad impatient), the time between dishes was even and no too long.   The only choice was a fixed menu that had two choices for each of the 5 main dishes.  If I remember correctly, they also served 3 breads with special butters, and 3 amuse type courses.  The five dishes I got were:\n\n1. Raw halibut with caviar and puffed rice\n2. Farm egg with ground cherry (looked like bacon bits)\n3. Seabream with pickled carrots\n4. Duck with olive caramel\n5. Lemon tart\n\nThe food was delicate, crisp, and most of all delicious.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves food and doesn't mind spending a bit of money for quality.", "author": "Skye W."}

I could eat that dish every day and still be finding nuance.\n\nThis is not a place you come to for large portions, but if you want flavour and texture combinations that are artfully composed, Sons & Daughters is it.

I was lucky enough to have the 6 people at our table including some vegetarians, meaning we got to see and TASTE everything that was offered on the menu that night, MULTIPLE TIMES!\n\nOne of the main draws for me to S&D was the fact that it was a combination of super chef fancy dishes but with an emphasis on \"simple\" and local foods.  The experience was casual and relaxing, not too loud, not too hoity toity.  Just perfectly simple and inviting.\n\nWe all got the Set Menu an Wine pairing, it was delicious.  The wine was certainly the best part for me. We had 6 or 7 different wines, and they were all delicious.  Each were went great with the food, and there were some really unique ones, like the sparkling sake. \n\nEach Dish was gorgeous and sooo pleasing to the eye.  Many of us didn't want to start eating so we can admire the beautiful dish just for a few more minutes. The best was probably the wild boar: two perfect sauces, painted on the plate like a some kind of modernist painting.  And the colors are so perfect because express the taste of the ingredient, like the black for the charred wheat sauce. Then the tender wild boar on top, so perfect. \n\nAs you can see many of the foods had a lot of chef sciencyness to it.  Other dishes we received had interesting such as foams and gels, which added flavor in interesting ways. Yet the dishes kept an air of freshness and simplicity that was a real treat to experience. \n\nOverall the restaurant was great in every way.  It is hard to ask for anything more.  However all the dishes did not blow me away, plate after plate.  Is that too much to ask (I am not sure if my expectations were too high)?  Some dishes were kind of a downer compared to some of other more perfect ones. Also at the price, other restaurants do get a perfect 5-courser, so I think it would be unfair to give S&D 5stars.

Then you walk into Sons and Daughters and that image is dashed from your mind.\n\nThe space is tiny but elegant - black paint accented with chandeliers and a spectacular open kitchen where you can watch the chefs cook dish after dish without breaking a sweat or flashing a grimace. True pros.\n\nI did the prix fixe with wine pairings with my dinner companion, and we each ordered different dishes off of the menu which is really the only way to do this. Every single dish was impeccably presented and there wasn't a single one that I didn't absolutely love. Service was casual but truly helpful and friendly - I was most impressed that the hostess who seated us and was seating other tables was the one who brought out each of our wines with each course and described them all without missing a beat - region, year, name, and why it paired well with our dish.\n\nWe were started off with an amuse bouche of creamed cauliflower and caviar. The fois torchon was rich and decadent but not greasy like I've experiences other fois gras to be. Cream of parsley root soup was a delight. The veal tongue was tender. I wanted to build a house of the abalone and eat my way through it. The mains of squab and pork loin were perfectly proportioned and accented gracefully with things like brussels and burdock root. Every glass of wine complemented each bite perfectly.\n\nYou may read that they are \"tasting\" portions - but I can't stress enough that all together, you will be one hundred percent satisfied, not overly sated, and after the delicious wines you'll float home on cloud 9 and sleep well.\n\nI recommend Sons and Daughters without hesitation.

We arrived a little early for our reservations and were brought downstairs to the back lounge to wait for the rest of our party and for our table to be ready - AWESOME little room, I hate it when there is no place to wait for your table, often times the bar area, if there is one, is filled with diners eating at the bar so you are usually left standing in any available spot feeling like you are hovering over people as they eat or dodging servers to get out of their way.\n\nThe hostess/sommelier was fabulous, we didn't even notice that they were late seating us for our reservation.  She checked on us, brought us drinks and gave us updates.  I appreciate when people level set your expectations instead of avoiding/ignoring you.\n\nOnce we were seated the wait staff was equally as hospitable.  They went through the entire menu and helped answer all our questions.  We all went with the pre-fixe and hubby went with the wine pairing (which was very reasonably priced).\n\nThe kitchen is tiny and it's amazing how well they timed everything.  They had noted that hubby is deathly allergic to shellfish/seafood yet they forgot when bringing out the amuse with caviar, but they quickly swapped it out.  As dishes were presented, they were explained.  Not only was the presentation lovely, the food and flavor combinations were perfectly balanced.\n\nFavorite description of the night when looking at the walnut paper on K's plate - especially amusing for recovering catholics and not written verbatim, but it went something like this:\n\nme:  does it taste like paper?\nserver:  it kind of reminds me of church\nme:  so kind of like communion?\nk:  so you're saying it tastes like Jesus?\n\nafter tasting we decided it tastes better than Jesus  (apologies to anyone offended)  - quite humorous, yet delicious\n\nLots of little exchanges here and there throughout dinner which was appreciated as it's no fun when servers are stuffy.\n\nDuring the pairings, hubby asked for another glass of the syrah and proceeded to ask our hostess to write the name down cause he loved it so.

Yet, I was equipped only with my trusted iPhone 4 (without the S) and this nifty app called instagram, so I apologize for the photo quality here.\n\nTucked away in the less-touristy side of Union Square, across Nob Hill Theater, was this gem. Through a glass door was the white walls and rustic interior of wood and leather. It was an open-kitchen, facing the quietly buzzing crowd.\n\nQuail egg   Malt   Yeast   Ground Cherry: \nthe quail egg was poached with the yoke runny. Pierced with my fork it ran onto the small salad of shaved celery root and radish flowers. At the base were the ground cherries, consistency alarmingly similar to that of bacon bits. Hidden in between were green berries with miniature bursts of tangy delight.\n\nSea Urchin   Sea bean   Cauliflower   Dashi: \nmy absolutely favorite dish of the night, though likely biased due to my fervent love for sea urchin - the soft, creamy taste of the ocean. In its fresh entirety, this piece of sea urchin sat amidst a vibrant purple from the cauliflower, that formed a breathtaking beauty. Squashed sea bean laid at the bottom, providing a necessary crunch; while the dash mixed to become gelatinous, taken the plate to a different level of umami.\n\nSea bass   Green Farro   Leek   Caviar: \na nicely balanced segua between the last and the next, though a shade less memorable. The sea bass was nicely grilled with skin crisp to my taste, next to the caviar beurre blanc. Leeks, also grilled, oozed sweet autumn memories that the farro complimented.\n\n30 day aged New York steak   Chanterelles   Brussel sprouts   Charred onion: hearty without losing its basic elegance would be the summary of this dish. The steak was tender, juicy with just a hint of blood. The vegetables tossed in (likely) a generous dose of butter, bringing the warm flavors of foliage.\n\nYuzu   Pop corn   Seasame   Passion fruit: \na playful finish of light yuzu custards with small sesame chips and reduced passion fruit drops so tangy my brows farrowed. And, days later, I still couldn't get over how much the ice cream tasted like kettle corn!\n\nIt was a lovely dinner.

The 2 courses of amuse-bouche:  1 at the beginning of the meal, one before dessert.\n\nWhat we ate:  the oysters, foie gras, char tartare, herb salad, sweetbreads, lamb, squab, risotto, and 2 desserts:  chocolate cake and a watermelon granita.  All were delicious - with the \"must-haves\" being the oysters, foie gras, herb salad, and squab.\n\nThe portions are reasonable size, not huge, which is why it makes sense to try every dish that you can.\n\nWho would like it here:  A date, New Yorkers, friends who are really into food.\n\nIt has all of the makings of a cult-classic, hidden gem, and is a great addition to the area.", "author": "Liz S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-09-08", "description": "The waiter told us a cute story about how the two young chefs met in culinary school and started this place.  Sounds like the trailer for the sequel to \"The Social Network.\"  Except without the billion-dollar valuation, the lawsuits, and ... the success?\n\nLook, I hate to give an ambitious new place two stars.  I try to find any reason not to go to this level.  But seriously, I've eaten at damned near every fine dining joint in town, multiple times, and I can say with absolute certainty this one won't last without making serious adjustments, and soon.\n\nThe food starts with nicely made brioche and salted butter.  Cheers.\n\nThen there's a bland \"honey balls\" amuse-bouche.  It's just sad.  I've never had an amuse-bouche that skimpy or sad anywhere.  Your use of sodium alginate and calcium chloride (note to foodies:  both chemicals) doesn't make up for the fact that it's just boring little honey balls.\n\nI had the herb salad.  Note that I didn't actually ORDER the herb salad, but that's not why I am giving them such a low rating.  I'm a good sport and miscommunication happens.  It's nicely seasoned and dressed, fresh, but there's something (whey?) that has the very unpleasant texture of stale grape nuts.  Get rid of it, and fast.\n\nThe sweet breads with lobster claw is the high point of the meal.  Nicely cooked but somewhat under-seasoned sweetbreads, forgettable chickpea puree, nice jus, nasty-looking and useless dijon foam.  Over-seasoned lobster in little bits underneath a perfunctory baby greens salad.  But overall, well made, tasty.  Hits the right notes.  \n\nThen the lamb.  Look, this is a sad dish.  I took one look at it when they set it down and I knew I wouldn't like it.  And I didn't.  It's pitiful.\n\nIt's four little slices of lamb loin.  They are perfectly even all the way through with a little crust.  There is no jus, no fat, nothing to make the dish unctuous or rich.  There are a few fried potatoes with roasted tomatillo sauce, and some odd green (cloves?) strewn about.\n\nLook, this is what the cooks did.  They took this great piece of lamb, hacked every bit of fat off it, then stuck it in a sous vide machine.  When the ticket was fired, they took it out, fried some potatoes, seared off the lamb, and dressed it with some pre-made tomatillo sauce.\n\nThis is an insult to lamb.  You can't serve lamb without any rendered fat, no jus, in tiny little pieces like that.  Guys.  Go to any other restaurant in town serving lamb at similar prices to yours, and try it.  Go to Frances.  Go to Aziza.  Go anywhere.  Taste it and tell me it's not an order of magnitude better.  \n\nYes, Thomas Keller gets away with serving perfect dishes with sous vide machines.  Including lamb.  You know what else he does?  He spends twenty hours making triple veal stock to moisten it.  You can't serve a freakin' lamb dish for over $20 with four little tiny pieces and no sauce or rendered fat.  It's insulting.\n\nThen there's this sweet amuse bouche with berries and vanilla powder.  It tastes like something at the condiments stand in Starbucks.  I could make a ghetto latte with their vanilla powder.\n\n*calms down*\n\nThe watermelon granita dessert was the best thing I had.  Nice balance of melon and syrup.  In a four course meal, the granita should NOT be the best thing I try.\n\nSeriously, the folks giving you three stars here are being nice.  Each one is really thinking \"meh.\"  If you get a Michelin star for this food, I'll never trust the guide again.  I'll swear off the Bible and wander the desert, damn it.  For around $90 after taxes, tips, food, wine, there's no way this meal is even close to worthwhile, not at this level, no way.", "author": "J W."}

The experimentation, the presentation, the flavors are hard to tell apart from the dishes you might get at a Michelin two-star (think Manresa or Coi). But the pricing and the atmosphere are much more welcoming to those of us on a budget and not wanting to dress up for dinner. The environment and staff are warm and welcoming too and the open kitchen where you can watch the tatooed, hipster chefs work their magic is a nice touch. \n\nMy husband and I went here prior to a concert at the Masonic Center...I wasn't sure what to expect but the casual bistro vibe combined with the haute cuisine was a big winner for us.

I was surprised when we walked through the front door and was greeted by one of the chefs. It was interesting that the kitchen was right in front of the entrance. We were brought menus personalized with a birthday greeting and my boyfriend was immediately wished a happy birthday. It was a nice touch that we were given glasses of bubbly. It definitely gave the night a great start! The 7 courses were perfect. We got the pairings and I embarrassingly will admit that I was pretty tipsy by the third course. There was even a pairing for the amuse bouche! I really enjoyed and savored each bite of my vegan menu. My boyfriend really enjoyed his meat dishes. The service was perfect. Everyone was really attentive without being annoying or pretentious. The entire experience was phenomenal. The only thing I would complain about is not having any bread. My boyfriend was served 3 different breads throughout the meal. Other than that, I was very, very impressed with the quality of the presentation, taste, and creativity of my courses. I admit there were a few ingredients I didn't recognize and had never tried before. The portions are small, yes, but it is a tasting menu, and I was left with wanting more. The second to last dish was very memorable. The best way I can describe it is little tear drop shaped satsuma ice. My dish had buddha's hand but I'm not sure if the fruit's flavor was just infused or what. It was interesting trying to figure it out, especially since it was vegan. The soy ice cream that was part of my dessert was so creamy and smooth; it was nothing like anything I had ever tried before. The moscato paired perfectly and the dessert was a perfect finish to the evening. This was a fantastic dining experience. My boyfriend and I left very happy and satisfied.\nThings I appreciated: being called to confirm dietary restrictions and my bf's birthday, the kitchen's ability to accommodate requests, simplicity and elegance of the restaurant, absolutely fantastic service, the friendliness of the staff, the creativity and tastiness of dishes.", "author": "Tee C."}

My dining companion and I did their 5 course menu plus wine pairings and absolutely loved it.  Portion-wise, it seemed on par with restaurants of its caliber and we left satisfied, though not stuffed.  Overall, all the dishes we had were creatively plated, without being overworked and the flavors were well balanced.  Yes, you do have to work a bit to make composed bites so you get the full effect, but it's well worth it.  We also felt that the wine pairings were very well matched with each course.  We also appreciated that it exposed us to some wines and some wine producing regions (like the Canary Islands) that we didn't previously have any experience with.\n\nThe service was also great.  Our waiter and the sommelier were both very approachable, ready to answer our questions and to allow us to linger, even though were there at the end of service.  Our courses were spaced out enough for us to slowly enjoy our wine and socialize, but not so slow that we found ourselves waiting around.  Overall the pace of the meal seems good.\n\nIf there was one thing I had mixed feelings on it was the ambiance of the place.  On one hand I liked that it was small, cozy, intimate and approachable.  But on the other hand, it felt really tight.  Our table was quite close to the next table so it gave little in the way of privacy.  Also, there's no bar, which means if you have to wait for your table you're in an awkward waiting room that reminded me of my grandma's basement.  Neither detracted substantially from the meal, but were my least liked elements.  \n\nBut overall, a great meal and a highlight of my trip.", "author": "Kelly A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-23", "description": "Sons & Daughters provided me with one of my most memorable meals out in SF for a long while - surprising me with fresh ingredients, inspired dishes, and flawless execution. The 4-course tasting menu with its exceptional wine pairing is the way to go, giving you the chance to explore all the kitchen has to offer.\n\nThe chefs dabble in molecular gastronomy and have a few creative flavor combinations (like the seared foie gras with yogurt, concord grape granite, and balsamic foam), but mainly Sons & Daughters impresses with its thoughtful food choice and precise execution. Squab breast is accompanied by a delightfully sweet pea coulis; instead of salad, they pair lamb loin with the much more unusual, grassy flavor of redwood clover leaves. Even their bread rolls are delicious, well-seasoned with San Francisco sea salt and served with warmed butter. Other nice touches include two complimentary amuse bouches and glasses of prosecco with the wine pairing.\n\nWith chandeliers and fine art photos adorning the black walls, the ambiance manages to feel upscale without being pretentious. This is probably enhanced by the relaxed (yet still classy) service and open-air kitchen, allowing diners a sneak peak at the chefs at work.\n\nAt $48 for the tasting menu and another $36 for the wine pairing, I would describe the meal as pricey but not overpriced - they are, after all, serving lobster, foie gras, and lamb. For a special occasion or simply a nice evening out, Sons & Daughters will leave your curiosity piqued and your palate satisfied.", "author": "Britt M."}

They offer any menu item a la carte and in retrospect I should have ordered 4 of the gnocchi and two of the choc cake with mint ice cream. (Ice cream was to die for btw)\n\nService was cordial but very slow between courses. Maybe this was intentional to let your food settle so you don't leave starving? \n\nEverything was delicious and beautifully plated. We welcomed the surprise oyster appetizer. Tasty, but the cucumber juice was a little overpowering. Also a surprise was the strawberry spoon w/ vanilla powder served right before dessert.\n\nI had heard they played great music, but I could hardly hear it.

Your first course arrives on a piece of slate. \n\nDon't get me wrong, this is a positive review. I just want to prepare folks for the scene, if you think you're signing up for the usual prix fixe \"fine dining\" experience.\n\nWe had the raw lobster tail, seared foie, squash, abalone, squab, foie dessert and chocolate dessert. Of those selections, I really enjoyed the raw lobster tail which was pounded into a beautiful translucent circle topped with caviar, pomegranate, weed-like sprouts, flowers and lime basil dressing -- a gorgeous piece of culinary artwork! The plating here is breath-taking, but sadly in most cases, the dishes were more beautiful than delicious. Everything was good, but not as sumptuous as their visual. I'd liken it to attempting conversation with a male model.\n\nBesides that, the service is definitely better than your normal hipster dining joint. Had to ask for bread twice, water jug never got re-filled, silverware was taken but not replaced, etc. On the other hand, everyone was very kind and full of recommendations.\n\nRE: ambiance -- it's a bit odd.

It hasn't gotten much play on yelp yet, so I decided to check it out while I could still easily get reservations. And for $48 for a 4 course prix fixe with $38 wine pairings, I knew the price couldn't be beat.\n\nThe interior is small but cozy and chic with great chandeliers, a parlor area and beautiful purple walls and ceilings. The small open kitchen is adorable and though it feels homey the food certainly is more refined. Contrary to other reviews, I actually liked the music selection. It felt like they cycled on their favorite Pandora station that was full of youthful electronica and funkalicious beats. \n\nTheir amuse was beautiful but not exactly memorable. For first course, I had the lobster carpaccio and the boy had the foie with peaches and brioche. The lobster with sturgeon caviar and coral was delicate and absolutely decadent with very high quality caviar. The foie was luscious served with a wonderful sauterne.\n\nFor second courses, I had the sweetbread and lobster claw while my date had the scallop with \"veal tea.\" My sweetbread was cooked perfectly with a chickpea puree but the standout really was the perfectly cooked scallop. And by \"veal tea\" I mean super rich jasmine flavored jus. It was actually mind blowing.\n\nMain courses were actually the most underwhelming part of the meal. I had the lamb loin, which was not memorable in the slightest; and he had the squab, which was beautifully presented and a great texture.  I also thought the wines paired with both of these had too many tanins. \n\nThe pluot foam refresher was astonishing because it completely cleared our palats. Following that came the chocolate cake and honeydew melon soup deserts. The soup really surpassed my expectations and the dessert wines paired with both were exceptional. As parting gifts, the restaurant left us with bruleed pineapple pieces. \n\nThe timing of the meal was excellent (not terribly hard with the size of the restaurant) and the service was attentive.

Loved it - but couldn't detect any menthol hints at all so wondered where the eucalyptus came into play.  The fois is to die for good. Lightly dusted in flour and sauteed it had a caramelized crunch. I enjoyed it by dipping my spoon into the yogurt and grape granite and then adding a slice of the fois. I am not a fan of eating just fois - I need it on a raft of some sort - but this was refreshingly different and I didn't miss my requisite raft.   MMMMMM.... I then had the squab - it was a tad underdone for my taste and slightly challenging to eat. though presentation was magnificent and daring with the little claw foot sticking up ever so slightly. :) \n\nDo not miss the watermelon granite - over the top refreshing. A cup of french press coffee in a diner mug and stick a fork in you are done. \n\nMy companion enjoyed the ahi with quail egg. she said it was delicious.

My husband relished in the challenge and found harmony more often than I did, but heck I didn't come to a four course tasting menu dinner to work that hard. \n\nThe foie torchon was brilliant, i'll admit, and the harmony of flavors of the squab dish were well composed, but the greens with the rabbit were bitter to a fault, and the rabbit by itself was too salty unless you could get the perfect amount of egg yolk and strawberry. Don't even get me started on the lamb, the marriage of flavors with the barley underneath total overwhelmed rather than complemented the flavors in the lamb. The wine was also really young, and would have been much happier to pay more for more better wine. \n\nSo the food here is interesting, but it turns out not always in a good way. Sad making as I really hoped to love this place.", "author": "Michelle M."}

All the food we had was good, but I have to admit with the plethora of farm to table, organically grown, sustainable restaurants in San Francisco, this one seemed more expensive and less memorable. What I do remember was that in between each course, we were served a different kind of bread/toast and unique butters, which were delicious.

I'll be honest --this tinged my entire experience.  I did ask them to turn up the heat and our server said the room wasn't heated.  I had an incredible new dress and didn't want to choose between dining in my coat or shivering.\n\nAll the food was very good, but at that price, it really better be.  Nothing was particularly memorable.  \n\nEqually important is that I expect IMPECCABLE service if I shell out 300+ clams for two people.  The service was lacking.\n\nOur problem was clearly that we arrived just as they were opening.  Yes, I know that nobody eats dinner at 5:30 , but we had plans for a night of holiday boozin' staring at 7pm.  Knowing we should start with a good meal we made an early reservation.  \n\nClearly the reservation was unnecessary because the restaurant was empty.  However, when we arrived, we stood at the door a good ten minutes while they tried to find the hostess to seat us.  (I guess she was necessary to choose which of the empty tables to seat us.)\n\nThe staff was wholly unprepared.  The menus for the evening were not yet printed, the ovens weren't on, the staff wasn't even sure what the specials were yet.  Nobody really had their shit together.  \n\nGranted there were no giant blunders, and we were the first table, but I *did* have a reservation.  They knew we were coming.  You'd think they could have had their aprons on and some bread cooked.\n\nSorry but despite all the reviews I've read lately, I just didn't feel like Sons and Daughters warrants the hype.  Given the investment for dinner, I'm not too likely to give them another chance.  I'd rather hit somewhere that I know will do it right.", "author": "Amy A."}

They have yet to combine their talents with the dining experience, however, which created a general feeling of dissatisfaction for me and my guests. \n\nGluttonous typical American portions aside, $14 for one scallop borders on the ridiculous, no matter how expertly prepared.  As far as touting the \"deal\" of the tasting menu, at $48 each plus wine and tip, the total hovers around $90 per person, depending on the wine selected.  If that is a deal to you, knock yourself out.  (Note: the dining menu is very small itself, by the way, so unless you eat everything, you may find picking all four courses a challenge.) \n\nOur server, while very nice, couldn't elaborate on the bottle of wine we chose not because it was awful, but because the varietal 'wasn't her thing'.  That is not a good enough answer if I'm forking over almost $100 per person.\n\nOverall, the experience reminded us of the esoteric dining of the late 90's that offered affected, labor-intensive food at a premium back when everybody was making money- just without the polished surroundings and stunning execution.

There were a few things I didn't recognize.\nOk..... for the 4 course:\n\n1) Roasted potato skin consomme : This was really good. It was dumpling like. Kinda like gnocci.\n1) Foie Torchon: I never really liked this and I still don't but my bf liked it.\n\n2) Abalone Burdock: This was quite good but I've had better abalone. The Chinese restaurants mastered the cooking of abalone so you can't really compare.\n2) Rabbit Dandelion: My first and last time eating rabbit. I told myself I would never eat rabbit but felt adventurous for my bf's birthday. It was actually really good. It's kinda like chicken/and duck put together. If I didn't have a pet rabbit before I may consider having it again. but no.....\n\n3) Squab Breast: Extremely tasty. I can see why some people didn't like this because they present it with the claws. It's for presentational purposes but I can see why some people from the reviews can get grossed out.\n3) Lamb: Really good. Lamb is always good but that's another animal I try not to eat.\n\n4) Candy Cap mushroom Cake: good\n4) roasted pepper cake: good. Didn't expect these cakes to be sweet and savory. This was new to me and I found it really delightful. Flavors were complimented nicely.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience.

We did not do the wine pairing (more on that below), but did have a nice Ventliner plus a glass of sparkling Chenin Blanc.  Service was attentive and friendly, but not bothersome.

The squab was fine, but not great.  Overall, we both enjoyed the meal and the atmosphere.\n\nHowever, given that this is a fixed tasting menu, it needs to be compared with other SF restaurants.  S&D does not hold up against Saison or Benu.  Both have more variety, consistency and depth of flavor throughout the meal.  Also, if you are going to offer a wine pairing, you need to have a deep enough wine cellar to do it.  S&D does not.  They simply picked a few wines off their limited wine list.

This was my first visit to S & D and I thought the experience was fantastic, and I will definitely be back. You will get a 7 course meal for the price of $98 which isn't that bad for SF standards. We started off with Scallop which was good but not great. The chef should consider serving the dish warm and not cold. Baby Beets followed which was nice, but I would have added soemthing else to the dish. The Sunchoke was excellent and rare. The Pork and Squab dishes were very top-notch but I wish they would have given a bit more serving on the plate. Tangerine was refreshing to cleanse the palate, and to finish we had the Chocolate with pistachio and bay leaf which went well with the port (20 year Sandeman) I was served. Our service was excellent and our server was very attentive and attractive as well. I would recommend sitting away from the front door entrance to avoid foot traffic and the cold. The bathroom has a strange smell, which I would recommend some air freshner or beautiful scented flowers or candles. The wine list looks good, but lacks some more California wine. Put some Shafer, Caymus, or Duckhorn on the list. The restaurant is small with only 11 tables, so reservations are highly recommnended. Overall, this could be a 5 star restaurant on my list with a few tweeks here and there. I will definitely be back soon...", "author": "Mark L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-29", "description": "I really enjoyed my meal here. I was staying at the Golden Gate Hotel down the street and came here for a solo dinner on a weeknight. I ordered the tasting menu ($48!) with wine pairings and asked the waiter for his recommendations. He was very friendly and offered some more in-depth descriptions of the dishes and which ones he thought were the most interesting. I ended up choosing:\n\n-Foie torchon\n-Abalone\n-Squab breast\n-Strathdon blue cheese\n\nI loved that the components of the dish were listed on the menu and sounded logical enough, but were incorporated in totally unexpected ways. For instance, the \"Foie torchon/apple/horseradish/burrata/bronze fennel\" came to the table as a portion of delicious foie, served over a tart apple gelee and topped with delicate burrata crisps, horseradish salt, and mini fronds of bronze fennel that punctuated each bite with a subtle green note. Once I picked up on the approach, it was fun to try to predict what inventive presentation of the ingredients in the next dish was in store. The foie was wonderful, as was the perfectly crispy squab with earthy pear and hazelnut--definitely the two best picks of the bunch.\n\nMaybe because I was alone and they were trying to give me some extra attention, maybe because I was alone and they thought I might be reviewing the place, or maybe because they do this for everyone, I was also served an amuse and two additional courses (each with a wine pairing): the roasted potato skin consomme, which was rich and warming and familiar without being heavy, and the baby carrots, which were, surprisingly, one of my favorite dishes of the evening. \n\nThe wine pairings were very good, but honestly, I'd probably just order the tasting menu with one recommended wine next time. I tend to get a little overwhelmed by wine pairings, and with a tasting menu of only four courses, it felt a little fussy. That said, that's completely a personal preference note, not a complaint about the pairings themselves.\n\nI thought the service here was excellent, the food interesting and delicious, and the atmosphere cozy and modern--I loved the open kitchen right in the front of the restaurant. I can't wait to return here with company and try more of the small but thoughtfully curated menu.", "author": "Cam S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-06-24", "description": "Sons and Daughters is one of those new (old) trends in restaurants--prix fixe, eat-what-we-serve-you. The menu is the menu for that night, printed with the diners' names and all of the paired wines so there is no need to get copies of labels. They do ask about allergies and dislikes, so there is some flexibility in the menu, but probably not enough to swap major ingredients that aren't already on the menu.\n\nSince the menu changes every night, details of specific dishes are probably not important. Wine pairings featured labels not commonly available, like a sparkling Basque white. As for the food, my first thought was that they are like Manresa, but a bit more daring and more affordable.\n\nThis restaurant is definitely on my \"must dine\" list for San Francisco.", "author": "Steve F."}

The food is unique and creative, without seeming to resort to a lot of fancy shenanigans.  We appreciated the delicious, refined interplay between the flavors.   I heard about the restaurant through my sister who is a professional chef.   I chose the $48 4-course prix fixe which is a very good deal.  \nI had: \n- cream of parsley root soup, with black trumpets, enoki and maiteke mushrooms.  The mushrooms added just the right amount of richness to the soup, and different textures \n- abalone, with burdock root puree, celery, and olives.  The way it was presented, there were two different ways to taste the abalone, one with the creamy puree, and the other a little saucier with the celery.  Both tasted great, and I really enjoyed the flavors and textures, yet again.\n- seabream, with watercress, honey lemon foam, sunchoke puree, and pepitas.  I was getting full by now and I generally don't like firm fish as much, but this was still very good.  \n- beet cake (looks like red velvet cake, tastes quite different), chocolate mousse and cocoa nibs - another great dish.  The nibs added a nice texture and crunch.\n\nThe amuse bouches were also delicious.  The first was a cauliflower puree, pickled cauliflower and caviar.  Great start to the evening.  The other was a pear soup and spiced walnut.  And the last petit fours were lemon macaroons.  \n\nMy boyfriend had:\n- kabocha squash, hedgehog mushroom, rapini and dried raisins, which he really enjoyed.  I liked it without the raisins which added an Indian spice to the flavor. \n- the sea bream (above)\n- squab, confit leg, liver pate, pear, hazelnut, and shallot.  Our server described this as a staple and this was definitely head and shoulders above the sea bream.  The squab breast was done souvis and was perfect.  The leg was crispy.  The hazelnut added just the right delicate flavor to the dish.  \n\nAll in all, the food was excellent.  The ambience is so-so.  We were there on a Sunday night so not a fair comparison, but i prefer the vibe of a Nopa or Frances (more energy).  Maybe this is more romantic, but for a small restaurant the acoustics made it quite hard to hear each other without leaning in.  Regardless, definitely recommended.", "author": "Vivian W."}

You can tell the staff really enjoys their work and eachother.\nAlso, the chefs are cute so i wish i could give another star for that alone.\nWe did the 5 course tasting menu but no wine pairing, as i'm a broke college student who had to save up for a month before i could even make the reservation. I realize these are the epitome of white girl problems but o well, feel sorry for me. \nEach course has 2 options so we each ordered one and split dishes the whole way through.\nEvery dish was so surprising and smart, you can really tell that each ingredient on the plate has been thought out. The plating was so beautiful i wanted to snap a picture of every dish but didnt want to blow up my spot with a flash, it was a pretty serious dilemma.\nThe foie was delicious, everyone saying the oats werent necessary are up their own asses, nothing is necessary lol and i thought the contrasting textures were really nice. These guys obviously know what their doing.\nI wish i could pick a favorite dish but they were all amazing. I think the squab and wild boar were the ones i couldnt shut up about on the way home but then my brother reminded me of his abalone and a new rant of deliciousness was born. We also got an off the menu crab dish with carrot puree, serrano peppers and pomegranite seeds that was so good it was ridiculous.\nThe only dish i didnt care for was the broccoflower with with celery root and thats really only because i cant even look at anything even remotely resembling broccolli without gagging although somehow i was able to finish my plate so if that's not a true testament to how talented everyone in the kitchen is then i dont know what is.\nThe warm mini carb treats in between each course was an awesome way to end one dish and begin another. Did i mention i love anything miniature? Well i do. Each bread came with their own butter, my favorite being the slice of white bread with salted butter.\nFinally came the dessert, we got one of each. the chocolate tart with salted caramel was so good, it was completely unexpected when all the delicious caramel began oozing from the tart after i cut into it. As i was stuffing my face with chocolate my brother reminded me that we were sharing, I was tempted to say hell no we're not, as i thought i had reached the pinnacle of desserts but my sisterly kindness prevailed and THANK GOD it did because the yuzu and popcorn ice cream was the murderer of every dessert i thought i loved. I want to put popcorn ice cream on everything, every course here should be served with a scoop. Also i hope the japanese realize how lucky they are to have yuzu everyday. The japanese dont eat yuzu everyday, you say? Well they should because its the world's best citrus. I need to stop this dessert rant or this review will be 2 pages long.\nThe decor was so welcoming in a classy hipster kind of way, which lets face it, is right up my alley. The chandeliers, fireplace and giant gold framed mirror mixed seamlessly with the worn wood tables and open kitchen for an elegant environment that didnt feel stuffy at all.

From start to end, the service was excellent and everyone we interacted with was very friendly and attentive. We both got the summer pre-fixe for dinner. Overall, I'm a pretty adventurous eater and down to try new foods....so it didn't concern me that I'd never had some of the foods on the menu (i.e. squab, sea urchin...etc.). However, as I learned after eating all of the courses, it is actually really important to know that you'll like all the courses if you're going to spend nearly $100 on a pre-fixe. As it turns out, I do not like sea urchin and squab (even though they were prepared with great care).  So those two courses were rather disappointing for me. Out of all 8 courses, only two were really outstanding. The other six courses were nothing to write home about.\n\nWhile the service and wine was great, I would not come here again.

I'm sure they have good intentions, but if I'm going to drop $400, I want to be full and satisfied. BTW- that is how the meal ended ,by the server asking in a droll boring hipster, I don't give a f&$k tone - , \"Are you satisfied?\" = um no I am not. \nAlso, every table before us & the one next to us were offered coffee or tea with their dessert - we were not.

If you are reading this, read no further and go check it out for yourself right now. \n\nI knew about this place because my good friend grew up with some of the owner/chefs. We were lucky enough to go and try this place out before the hordes of people figure it out, and it turns into a 3 hour wait spot like so many SF establishments. When we went, it was busy, but not packed - after-all, it had only been open for a week. \n\nThe remodel they did to this place is great. Modern, clean, hip (not not snobby), and great decor. It's a bit intimate, i.e. cramped, but that is fine too. We didn't need to lounge in the hang out spot, but it looks like a great place to hang out while waiting for a table. \n\nThe service was friendly, polite, and prompt. They came at just the right pace - not fast, nor slow. \n\nThe food was fantastic. There were 4 of us eating, which meant that we tried nearly every thing on the menu. My favorite on the menu was the sweetbreads. The main that I got was the risotto which had an egg on top, but I like my wife's lamb much better. The Foie torchon was excellent as well. We knew the chef's are obsessed with it, and it shows with each bite of this dish which takes up to 4 days to prepare. \n\nDefinitely go here for a romantic, special dinner. You will not go wrong. The price is nothing to scoff at, but then again, you pay for what you get. \n\nThe only knock I have is the music selection! While eating a romantic, kind of pricey dinner, they were blasting music ranging from Elton John, to Tom Petty (the cheesy stuff), to Dylan and beyond. Not that I don't like all the music they played, but it was loud, and didn't suite the mood. \n\nI hope this restaurant takes off and does great.", "author": "Morgan F."}

One of the best meals of my short life.\n\nThe decor is dark and clean.  Take a french manor in the country, bring it into the 21st century.  Clear chandeliers, big mirrors on the walls, and a fireplace.  The dining room is small and intimate.  I showed up in a college sweatshirt, but many other men were wearing blazers and turtlenecks.  I appreciated being able to show up wearing jeans and a sweatshirt.  Turtlenecks are too distracting.\n\nDo the 4 course meal.  It's completely worth it.  it's $54.  Add $38 for the wine pairing--also completely worth it.  We were pleased to get 3 extra courses!  We were give an amuse bouche of mashed califlower, the fluke crudo (which blew my mind), and a final amuse bouche of a fruity molecular-gastronomical creation that burst in my mouth with flavor.  I also had the abalone (for the first time) and it was awesome.  The taste was like a mild tasting clam, but with flavor.  For my main course I had the pork loin and jowl--cooked to perfection.

They've opened up recently after Cafe Mozart closed down.\n\nFirst off, this place is VERY different from Cafe Mozart. The whole interior has been spiced up with a great casual and contemporary feel. The clean and simple black and white photography decor go perfectly with the furniture set up - not cramped at all, cozy yet not cramped.\n\nThe large windows allow outside light to spill in (and especially now while it is summer, it remains bright even late) - as the night progresses, the staff will light up the chandeliers and doorstep lamps. The ambience is perfect - upbeat yet not overbearing.\n\nThe open kitchen in the center of the restaurant also adds to the experience - you feel involved being so close to the food preparation; they have nothing to hide.\n\nAnd I haven't even got to the food yet - the food is incredible! The menu is a great mix of Californian and Italian. Sons & Daughters has found a great combination of fresh ingredients, clean presentation, and interesting flavor combinations to create a wonderful tasting menu. You can't go here without getting the tasting menu - the portion sizes are small, so you can't have a full meal without 3-4 courses.\n\nThe main courses were so good that they overshadowed the dessert - not particularly memorable, but the experience and food, especially for a brand new restaurant, combine to make a 5-star winning experience and comes highly recommended!", "author": "Willy C."}

A gripe I have about the place made me feel a bit mad.  Let's get that out of the way.  Since I cannot eat sugar (the obvious health reason), I decided to order three courses a la carte rather than the 48 dollar prixe fix dinnner.  Imagine my surprise when three courses cost more than four!  Imagine my surprise when the sablefish course cost more in the restaurant than on the menu that is on line.   If they want to give you a break of a dollar or two on the four course dinner that's fine.  But to charge more if you don't want dessert than if you do is a bit loony.  And insulting to those of us who must pass on the sweets.  Unless they want us to get a dessert and not eat it to save some money.\n\nDespite leaving with a bad taste in my mouth, the food was actually pretty good.  \n\nThe herb salad was beautifully plated and perfectly sourced.  Better yet the components of the plate were in perfect equilibrium.  \n\nSweetbreads with crab seem an unlikely combination.  It worked although the large knob of sweetbread was less to my taste than smaller bits of the meat, well fried, would have been.

We made the reservations before they handed out the Michelin Stars and once we saw Sons and Daughters receiving one we were quite excited.\nLocated on Bush Street, a block away from Masa's is a small restaurant that honestly feels somewhat depressing.  Perhaps it's the dim lights, the light fixtures or the dark wood in the restaurant but aside from the open kitchen everything kind of reminded me of an old home that has a spooky butler who would greet you by saying \"gooood evening.\"  The open kitchen is quite amazing; a small space, perhaps one of a small house and yet it seems they are able to do most or all of their work there.\n\nFive courses for $84, you get a choice of A or B for each course.  I chose the endive salad, sea urchin, wild bass, New York steak and chocolate cake dessert.  The endive salad's portion was small, a couple of bites and it's gone.  I did enjoy the carrots but I didn't feel the flavors mixed and matched well.  My friend got the quail egg with yeast and ground cherry, he agreed his salad/appetizer was too small as well.  The sea urchin dish is probably more of what I expected from a Michelin star restaurant.  Bold, distinctive flavors with creativity which makes you think what El Bulli would be like.  There was a dashi gelee, clam foam, sea urchin and cauliflower.  We were impressed with this dish, very impressed.  Next was the wild boar for my friend and wild bass for me.  He said his boar which came with a piece of black truffle was very good, even if it was without the truffle.   My wild bass was perfectly cooked and had bits of caviar and some greens (not sure what it was).  Then the fourth course which we both got was the New York steak.  I would definitely classify this as disappointing.  The chanterelle mushrooms that came with it were quite strong, the two pieces of meat weren't well cooked (I probably could have done the same job) and dish lacked creativity the last two offered.  Finally for dessert, he got quince cake and I got the salted caramel chocolate cake.  Both could have been better for sure.  If you ask me what was wrong, it just didn't impress me.\n\nSons and Daughters definitely has potential as highlighted by the few dishes we had on the second and third courses.  However it seems they used all their creativity and energy on those few dishes leaving little time to create something just as good for the other three.  When you go to a Michelin star restaurant and pay a good amount of money, you want to be wowed and want to leave wanting a bit more of what you just got.  Unfortunately we left wanting a lot more of what we didn't get; creativity, larger portions and better food.", "author": "Pierre L."}

The scallops were good, but slight old because they had that old seafood taste that tells you something is old.  The sweetbreads weren't bad either, but the lobster that was part of that was way tastier.  Why? Because the sweetbreads had an intestinal taste to them. Risotto was to die for! Right amount of creamy with truffles and the egg! The egg with salt added flavor and gooey-ness. YUM!  Dessert was okay. We had the panna cotta with raspberry and Riesling gel. Neither of us wanted a date milkshake.  I changed my panna cotta to a vanilla bean ice cream with a Riesling gel.

You practically walk right into the kitchen as you enter. The super high ceilings were painted black to bring a more intimate air.  We were seated by the window with a lovely view of the Nob Hill Theatre-awesome. One wonders why they didn't add sheer window treatment to dampen the noise (it gets really noisy in there) and diffuse the street view.  \n\nWe started off with a compressed melon amuse with one pink peppercorn to garnish.  I loved the burst of pepper with the dense melon - it was the perfect way to start off a meal clean and complex flavors.\n\nSince we opted for complementary courses of the pre-fixe, we got to try everything. I didn't know which I liked more the lobster carpaccio or the foie torchon.  Both were amazing for exactly opposite reasons - the carpaccio was sweet and light while the foie was rich and decadent.\n\nI also really enjoyed my sous-vide squab.  It was cooked rare like I like it and was very flavorful.  I also tried the marscapone risotto with truffles - amazingly decadent.  \n\nI much preferred the chocolate cake to the panna cotta - the panna cotta had not set yet and was soupy.  \n\nIf the panna had been on point, I would have been inclined to award S&D five stars.

The only misstep was the raw scallop.  I LOVE raw scallops so I like to taste them.  The dressing was overpowering and  basically made the dish taste like tuna fish salad.  I scraped it off. But everything else was so delicious managing to be both innovative and traditional at times.  Definitely recommend but be warned the servings are really tiny.

After a quick glance we decided to go in and were promptly seated (with no res at 10 on a Saturday night, pretty sweet). We both got the 4 course tasting menu. Beet soup, herb salad, gnocchi, sweetbreads...all yum.\nI unfortunately received an emergency call and had to leave before the entrees came out! But the staff, having noticed my abrupt exit, chatted up my now solo friend. The waiter and the chef were super friendly and also wrapped up my last 2 courses to go (which were delicious even as leftovers).\nI can't wait to go back and stay for the full meal.

The food was phenomenal and I was so pleased to have a tasting menu dedicated to vegetarians.  The service was even more phenomenal than the food.  One of the servers gave us the wrong initial plates in a tasting menu and the entire staff spent the rest of the meal trying to make up for it.  It was a small mistake to us but they went out of there way to ensure we left feeling well taken care of.  I would highly recommend this place.  Great food, cozy ambience and exceptional service.  I believe they also get most of their veggies from their own from down near Los Altos.  Amazing!  Try it.", "author": "Brianne O."}

If you are looking for something intimate, not too pretentious, and solid delicious inventive food, then this is the right place. You can tell that they really care about what they have created. My friend took me here for my birthday last weekend. The menu is a 5 course tasting menu with 2 selections for each course. I really liked this since they are not forcing a menu on you and in reality if you are with someone who likes to share (I was) you can actually taste 10 courses! One of the other things that made me like this place is that they actually have some non-alcoholic drinks for non-drinkers. I had a elderflower soda which actually tasted like there was some lychee in it as well. Very light and refreshing. \n\nSome of the courses that we especially enjoyed were the abalone, the wild boar, and the venison. In between each course, they bring out a different housemade bread. They were all delicious and accompanied with different butters as well. My favorite was the buckwheat biscuit. I am surprised by the reviews where they said they left hungry. I eat a lot and I was almost to the point of being uncomfortable! My friend is a Four Barrel Coffee fan and enjoyed a 2 cup french press at the end of our meal.\n\nThis place may not be for everyone. For some, it may be too different and for others not enough. I think it is the perfect blend of inventive delicious food without trying too hard to be over the top. I believe the Michelin Star is well deserved! Will be back in a couple months to taste a new menu.", "author": "M S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-29", "description": "I had been wanting to revisit this place after a solo dinner right before the holidays (!) and finally got my chance when my boyfriend was in town this weekend. I redeemed an OpenTable dining check and we had dinner together on Monday night. They've upped the price of the 4-course menu in the meantime, but it's still one of the best deals in town (especially since you get more like 7 courses with all the \"amuses\"). The wine list is still remarkably well-edited, and the lovely & talented somm (Carlin) is very knowledgeable. She also let us have a taste of the Dom. Banan Rose of Mourvedre before we decided to get the bottle - delicious.\nThe first amuse was a slate decorated with red & gold beets and emulsified goat cheese, and dusted with porcini \"soil\". The beets were so fresh they were almost sweet, and the porcini garnish was appropriately earthy. My boyfriend chose the summer squash dish as a starter. As far as veg dishes go, this was very well put-together. Roasted green & yellow pattypan squashes rested on a bed of sweet corn, with wax beans and chanterelles alongside. Two perfect little white strawberries provided a flash of sweetness. Speaking of sweetness, the torchon of foie was amazing. The foie was served cold, with pure grated ginger and sea salt crystals on top. On the side were halved cherries, a square of cherry gelee, and what seemed like compressed oatmeal tuiles. All the flavors together were sublime - this is probably my 2nd favorite foie dish ever (the hot & cold app at Spruce takes top honors). I also enjoyed my 2nd course, which was simply described on the menu as baby carrots with walnut & orange. What arrived was so much more complex: roasted carrots of every color were presented on another slate slab. The dish was topped with an egg-white foam, with sweet little orange segments as a good counterpoint to the roasty flavor of the carrots. I didn't quite understand the walnut \"paper\" on the side, but it tasted good! I was very happy with my boyfriend's abalone dish as well. I was nervous because it had been my least favorite dish when I was there the first time, but the kitchen has really mastered it and conquered the rubbery mollusk! The abalone was very tender, and the salsify and burdock root provided a good earthy note. The Castelvetrano olives also brought a hit of brine, but it was all in balance.\nIt took quite a while to get our mains after this course, but as soon as I took a bite of my arctic char I was swooning with forgiveness. The crispy pan-seared skin gave way to bright-pink flesh cooked to a perfect medium; the accompanying vegetables (fingerling potato, sunchoke) were expertly turned, along with thinly shaved turnip and sprigs of tarragon. A little carafe of bright green \"garden coulis\" was poured alongside; the light, springy pea flavor really complemented the dish. My boyfriend's lamb was a mini-rack, roasted with agastache (a type of mint) and surrounded by a barley pilaf with artichoke and king trumpet mushrooms. The lamb was a little gamey for me but he did give me the endpiece :)\nTwo dessert amuses were served in rapid succession after our licked-clean plates were cleared. A single scoop of pink lady apple sorbet was surrounded by micro-brunoised celery (seriously - so much freaking technique at work here!); the flavors were crisp and refreshing. On the opposite side of the spectrum were the sweet potato doughnuts with orange-geranium glaze. The doughnuts were crisp but fluffy inside, while the glaze was good but just a touch too floral for me. The actual desserts were plated beautifully. I chose the strawberries, which came with a quenelle of long pepper ice cream (is the long pepper supposed to be the numbing pepper? because I didn't get that), a puff of whipped ricotta, and a drizzle of honey. The corn cake was moist and studded with chorizo bits, topped with bourbon ice cream and a smoky creme anglaise - very good flavor combination. Last but not least, I returned from the ladies' room to find an elderberry pate de fruit waiting for me. It was a sweet end to a wonderful evening. We left satisfied but not stuffed, which is always appreciated. Many thanks go out to the experienced team - they all work together in unobtrusive ways and obviously support one another, which diners notice more than you think.

Why don't more restaurants pay attention to acoustics on the walls and ceiling, floor even.  A bit of attention there would so enhance the diners pleasure.

The consome was under seasoned which really sucked because you not supposed to order salt in a fine dining establishment.  The fish was perfectly cooked though the kelp favor went really good with the dish. \nThe  Testun al Barolo sheep's cheese plate was pretty disappointing and  real boring. The cheese was dry and it had no sweetness to balance the saltiness of the dish. It came with some nuts that weren't even roasted and some apple slices. and my wine paring for the cheese plate tasted like cough syrup.( DONT ORDER, SRSLY).

So why don't I agree?\n\nATMOSPHERE: Almost cool, kinda funky.  The waiting room was nice, but the garage sale furniture and LED tea lights on the tables made it feel super cheesy.  Are they attempting to be ironic? \n\nFOOD: I convinced the same friends I had dined with the week prior at Prospect to join me, promising them it would be amazing.  The tasteless nectarine with honey caviar amuse bouche was indicative of the rest of the meal.  They were out of the lobster carpaccio so we each had the herb salad because it was highly recommended by our server.  The salad was pretty, that's about the only positive thing I can say.  To be honest, it lacked acidity and the whey was completely flavorless.  I also don't believe you should place foam on a dish unless it really adds to the flavor, which it clearly didn't.  We decided to order one portion of the cauliflower soup, which turned out to be super delicious ... semi-rich and really well balanced.  For my second course, I had the sweetbreads with lobster claw salad.  Again, not too flavorful and unbalanced.  The lavender pork belly and loin I had for my third course was edible, at least most of it.  Half of the medallion was completely red so I didn't touch it and decided to only eat the edges.  Call me unsophisticated if you want but pork that rare .... no gracias!  And what's with the dried up puree and crunchy-chewy barley, which tasted like burnt rice?  Finally, my chocolate truffle cake was delicious, but it was the size of a tiny brownie that was cut in half diagonally.  \n\nPRICE: I had thought to myself, four courses for $48 ... wow!  Well, when they say scallop on the menu, they literally mean that you get one scallop.  That analogy goes for almost everything on the menu, so don't get too excited..  \n\nSERVICE: Our attractive hipster server was nice enough, even though his recommendations were a clear miss on every instance.  Aside from that, the service was consistent. \n\nCONCLUSION:  Is there something I just didn't get, fellow Yelpers?!  The concept is over-developed but under-executed and the food not as refined as one is led to believe.  However, if you must go I highly recommend ordering a bottle of the Lucien Albrecht Cremant d'Alsace Rose, as it was the most delicious thing I consumed that evening.", "author": "Doug V."}

The sommelier is a very talented woman who will happily tell you everything you want to know about the wine.  Okay, enough with the \"lounge.\"  Move on upstairs to the cozy dining area and select the 4 course menu, of course!  $48 can't be beat.  The wine pairing, at $36, is yet another bargain for the quality you of service, food, and beverage you will experience at this place.

Serious experimentation happens at this place but not in an \"oh not sure that's a good thing\" kind of way.

The squab was to die for as was the beet soup, the sweetbreads, the lamb tartare (and I usually hate lamb), the foie, and the quinoa salad.  It was all amazing those just come to mind right now.  Dessert.  Oh, dessert.  If you get enough people to join you you'll get to taste each one!  U n R eAL.  This goes for the whole menu which is why I can speak to the flavors of so many dishes after having been there just once.  Bring your peeps, peeps!    \n\nAs other yelpers have mentioned, the open kitchen is an added perk.  Not only can you peek as they prepare exquisite dishes, but you can smile and sing their praises as you leave.  We'll definitely be back for more and hopefully soon.  As a sidenote, Monday night is industry night so those of you in the industry, carpe diem!", "author": "Diana K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-11-04", "description": "It certainly has potential but it also has some work to do to realize it and the work required is in the cooking, service and ambiance. \n\nFirst, the space. This is the old Mozart Cafe. Not much has been done to it. For dinner we sat in the lower room by the window. The room, in the shape of a cube, is all parallel walls and hard surfaces (window, mirrors, art behind glass frames). This made the small room incredibly loud...far too loud for a spoken conversation. We had to raise our voices quite a bit to be heard. Most unpleasant but this can be fixed with perhaps some wall treatment (drapes along one wall, different kind of framed art). The ambiance from a visual perspective was boring.\n\nNext, service. My guest is lactose intolerant and initially we were assured most things on the menu were dairy free only to go through it closely to see the opposite was true. So most things were off menu and certainly she had no dessert tonight. A glass of water was spilled on the table by our waiter. I understand accidents happen but these lapses of attention add up.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the food. Conceptually interesting, the cooking always tasted bland. An oyster presented in cucumber juice with a splash of citrus was a waste. The juice had far too little flavor to enhance the oyster. (One wonders why oysters are usually served with a mignonette, horseradish or hot sauce.) The beet soup was quite good. It's rare to see a borscht on a menu these days and with the cooler weather coming it's a welcome sight. The intense color with a dollop of creme fraiche in the center was visually appealing. The third of four courses (the oyster was an amuse bouche) was a vegetable course. Squash with white chantarelles, rapini, dried fruit and pineapple sage was fairly flavorless...more of a texture dish I suppose but in the end boring. The main entree was lamb loin and cheek with barley, a tobacco onion sauce and a quail egg. It was \"fine.\" Again, the lamb was cooked sous vide and then seared. It was all just a bit too flavorless.\n\nDesserts were Persimmon cake with fennel ice cream and Coffee panna cotta with pear, cardamom chantilly and pistachio. Both were just ok. I preferred the cake but again, flavors were all too subtle. \n\nI may return at some point in the future but there is certainly nothing compelling pulling me back.\n\n2.5 stars", "author": "Gary C."}

My favorite of the evening was definitely the Sea Bream with the geoduck, grilled Little Gems lettuce and lettuce foam. This was paired with a Gamay that was a home run. Actually let me change that, the poached pair with Cedar ice cream and oatmeal streusel was so good that we ordered another right after we finished. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very small and only seats about 30 people.

They are attentive to detail, inventive but well-edited, ambitious but unpretentious, and every aspect of the restaurant, from decor to food to service, reflects an eagerness to please.  Though a stranger, I felt like I'd wandered into my favorite neighborhood bistro and they were serving my favorite dishes.  We showed up a little late for our reservation and rather than making us stand awkwardly in the vestibule or next to the door getting elbowed by patrons, they seated us in their low-lit and cozy lounge at the back where we ordered a glass of wine and waited (not very long) for our table.  We started with some buttery kumamotos with celery juice and a mild horseradish garnish, and went with the $48 four course menu.  Cream of beet soup the color and texture of purple crushed velvet topped with tender small chunks of beet and topped with creme fraiche; gamey oxtail tartare with miso, chervil, juniper berry & potato chip; delectable seared foie with sweet grape granite, tart concord grapes, and yogurt; tender sweetbreads interestingly accompanied by somewhat salty dungeness crab meat and a pleasant dijon dressing; a gorgeous duo of crisp-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside sage pork belly and tender pork loin; a pretty good but not stellar squab breast with maitake mushrooms; and one of the best panna cottas I have ever had -- topped by a razor thin layer of incredibly subtle lemon verbena gelee, and filled with plump blueberries.\n\nThe decor -- dark wood, vintage-looking crystal chandeliers, Fortessa flatware -- and service, from an open though somewhat out-of-view kitchen, are engineered to create a sense of ease and comfort.

Dark and cozy without seeming like a cave, lively without feeling crowded or rushed. At first I wondered if it would be too noisy, but we were able to talk without yelling and also without feeling like our neighbors (who were pretty close) would be a part of our conversation.\n\nThe food was...high and low. We both ordered the 4 courses and shared everything, so we ordered 8 out of the 13 items on the menu (we skipped the starter type offering, might have been a mistake). In order of best to least enjoyed:\n\nOut of the 8 items, there were 3 we absolutely adored. The beets, the carrots and the bream were all amazing. Absolutely amazing! I was sad when we finished them. I can't even describe what was so amazing but every aspect of each dish worked on every level. \n\nThe abalone and the red pepper cake were very good. Not quite as mind blowing at the three above but delicious and satisfying and I'd definitely order them again.\n\nThe lamb was just ok. We enjoyed it but it felt a little boring. \n\nThe mushroom cake was extremely interesting and I'm glad I tried it, but I wouldn't choose to eat it again if I wanted a satisfying dessert. This might be because I'm not a huge fan of the flavor of mushrooms though. I enjoy mushrooms but, typically, because they've soaked up different flavors. But eating a dessert that had such a solid mushroom flavor made me realize that mushrooms on their own aren't my thing. Again, glad I tried it though. Was definitely an experience.\n\nI was most disappointed with the foie torchon. It just didn't work for me and I really wanted to love it as I love foie gras. I did enjoy some of the other components on their own and the torchon was improved by trying it on some bread but I had high hopes for enjoying the dish as presented and that never happened.\n\nThe bill, including 4 glasses of wine total, came to $180 before tip. The experience was not quite worth the price, in terms of food, but it would be totally worth it if more of the courses were as amazing as those 3 noted above.

There clearly was a lot of careful thought placed into each dish from presentation to flavor profiles.  \n\nMy piece of advice is certainly to do the pairing as this really is the best way to understand the themes that run through the food (both in look and taste).  I am also a big fan of their pairings, which I had heard were a bit off upon open, but have clearly been adjusted to match the deliciously inventive food. The show stopper for me was a wonderful Vouvray that I wished I had asked to have more of/written down the producer.  Totally dry with classic lemon peel and soft minerals.  However, I digress.\n\nI would really recommend being experimental in your ordering especially the desserts.  The candy cap mushroom cake was PHENOMENAL like mind blowingly delicious.  Mushrooms for dessert...who would have thought.  The texture is ethereal and the caramelization (my term may be off here) of the mushroom is superb.\n\nThe decor was homey and very Nob Hill San Franciscan.  If you arrive early, which I recommend, they have this really awesome waiting area and I advise checking out all the nooks and crannies of this location.  \n\nOnto why I didn't give them 5 stars.  The service was good, prompt, and attentive, but for the love of God, please tell me what I am eating.  I may have ordered the food, but have a little pride in what you are presenting.  This is not a steak and potatoes meal, so when you place a consomme or a foam or hell, even some squab in front of me just tell me what I'm eating and what I'm eating it with.  I was incredibly surprised that at the amuse bouche and even the gifts from the chef that I had to actually ask what I was eating before the waitstaff ran off.  I am not knocking the service because everyone was incredible friendly, but more be proud of what you serve and know it.  People really care about your craft, so share with us.\n\nAnyway, I would certainly go back and highly recommend this place to anyone who is up for highly conceptual food that is approachable and delicious.\n\nps. get the carrot dish. seriously.\nppss. their bread and butter is awesome.", "author": "Justin S."}

I have to say, it was a disappointment. I'm not sure why people LOVE this place so much. We love the atmosphere as it is a small space without being crowded, nice lighting, good ambience, very romantic in some ways. The service was fantastic - casual but professional, timing of food was perfect, very attentive wait staff. \n\nThe food - sorry to say - was a disappointment although there were some ahhh moments. We started with the fish crudo which was fantastic. The consomme and foie torchon were fine but nothing too exciting. The same for the next course (abalone, carrots, veal tongue). The entree was a mix. The squab was great (one of the best preparations I've had) but the fish was a bit too salty and the pork was good but not very exciting. Finally, dessert which is typically my favorite course. This part was the most disappointing. We really didn't like the flavor of the red pepper cake, although I have to give the chef credit for being creative. The other two choices were just so-so. We actually ended up walking over to Fleur de Lys afterwards and having our second dessert at the bar there to make up for it.\n\nI think the value for money is there since a 4-course meal for under $60 in San Francisco is a steal.

The second course of sea urchin (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=-bxsw9CdPBN76REhvkHxDQ ; description: sea urchin sea beans cauliflower dash) or broccoflower (broccoflower maitake celery root bronze fennel http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=RAIfq80rU4dqfv8ZKmeSpQ) were not our favorites, either. \n\nThankfully the wild boar with apple (course #3 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=61Cet2-IQQALe9AhuFfjtA) and squab with fennel (course #4 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=2AFUDVENACwQRyM1hkrDXg) made up for the first two courses.  Still I would've liked the portion to be a tad bigger and the whole thing to be a tad less froufrou.  \n\nWe did like the pastry chef's work though - 3 courses of bread with different kinds of homemade butter (our favorite was the mini croissant http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=H9ZH8bip99k4LefUFKAXzQ) and the dessert of yuzu custard with sesame crackers and pop corn ice-cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GoIbbBYDyr8W46YmxJct-g?select=Tr3CUOfpNJZtpDQtGoxnKA) were amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-28", "description": "OVERALL\nVenue is cute, romantic. Not good for Happy Hour. Good for talking or snoozing between courses, it's not a noisy venue. The food can best be described as \"tiny\" and ridiculous or whimsical if you want a less judgemental word. 2 stars.\n \nDETAILS\nWhat is usually called an \"amuse bouche\" at any other restaurant of any importance, they call \"gifts from the kitchen\" at Sons and Daughters. These \"gifts\" were so tiny the best way to describe what was served is like -- a finger smear of foam and one leaf of an exotic variety of artichoke that you try to eat with a tiny fork. Another \"gift\" was plated like it was a creamy soup with a beautiful tiny garnish -- both Beth and I jammed our spoons into the bottom of the dish to find nothing there (with a clank - how embarrassing).  The bottom of the dish just looked like creamy soup, the microgreens in the middle of the dish on top of 3 kernels of caviar was the \"gift\".  I put down my spoon (why did they provide a spoon?) I pushed it all onto my fork with the knife and after fiddling with the kernels of caviar I finally rolled the \"gifts\" onto my finger (as if picking up crumbs) to stem further embarrassment with the utensils and tiny kernels of food.   \n \nOver to the 5 course tasting menu (the only option on the menu - choose 5 from a list of 10) -- It went on and on for 5 courses like this with 2 mythical \"gifts\" in between. I asked the waiter what the squab was deglazed with and he promptly scolded me saying \"we never deglaze\"! -- as he stared me down.  I apologized and then my NY instincts kicked in and I pointed to the sauce on my plate under the miniature squab breast and he said \"Squab jus\".  I raise an eyebrow as if to say liar!  And he described \"jus\" as a 4+ hour boiling of bones, marrow and other tiny squab carcass. I felt his attitude not worthy of 2 stars - certinaly not 4.5.  The dessert was the best part of the tasting menu, but I wish I had more than 2.8 spoonfuls, which I dragged out to 5 or 6 by portioning to tiny sizes which I was now very savvy at balancing on the tines of my fork. The bill was $258 before tip for 2 people and we opted out of the wine pairings. We each had 1 glass of champagne and 1 glass of wine. \n\nSUMMARY\nWhen I could scoop up enough of the tiny food to actually taste it, the food tasted simply divine - the abalone was heavenly (deserving of a Michelin star from my personal experience with Michelin rated restaurants). But it was like performance art eating at Sons and Daughters and it was expensive and not worth it.  I would not recommend it. Other Michelin rated restaurants I've frequented in the US and France satisfied me with appropriate portions and warm service which was not condesceneding or if it was it was inperceptible and certainly not the heavyhanded brutish rudeness I experienced at Sons and Daughters after asking an innocent question.  The other 254 Yelp reviewers must have gone to a parallel dimension or they didn't feel as stupid as I did trying to eat 3 caviar kernels under microgreens in the middle of a large soup bowl with no soup in it. Chatting with my new friend Beth was great though .... Worthy of a second chance? ...for the food maybe, the service definitely not!", "author": "A D."}

We made our reservation on open table and let them know it was a special occasion and that one of us (sadly me) can't eat wheat (and no, it's not just in my head).  We were greeted promptly at the door and seated quickly.  We were then brought 2 complimentary glasses of Prosecco for our anniversary which was a nice touch.  They were very accommodating when we asked to move away from the drafty stairwell.\n\nOur server was attentive but a little stiff and seemed somewhat perplexed about how to handle the no gluten thing.  We had to solicit information about what on the menu I could eat.  We decided to both get the tasting menu and he was able to find out what was available to me after a few trips to the kitchen.  They were very willing to make adjustments and things proceeded smoothly from there.  \n\nThe tasting menu is definitely the way to go.  4 courses for $54 and they bring you a yummy little amuse.  We each got different items so that we could try as many things as possible.  It was obvious that a great deal of care and thought went into every dish.  The flavors were interesting and the presentation was exquisite.  It was truly a pleasure to taste such artistry and and we had fun comparing the dishes for each course and deciding whose was the best.   I was inspired to try things I don't usually order like the abalone and was happy I did.  Oddly, the only dish we weren't wild about was the more traditional Wagyu beef.  The vanilla bean sauce was sweet and overpowering and completely overwhelmed the beef.

In fact I think they gave us a complimentary extra wine tasting which was a very nice touch.\n\nNext up was the Black Cod with Uni and mushroom. SO GOOD! The tender texture of the cod was like eating a soft egg-white. After this was yet ANOTHER complimentary bite (these guys were really trying to please) the Risotto with black truffle. My only slight criticism was that it was quite salty. For my main course I had lamb that had been cooked in hay, with a very green herbal oil drizzle. The lamb was sweet, tender and just perfect. Finally the desert. I tried both the chocolate truffle cake and the plum cream thing. Both very tasty.\n\nThe food was contemporary, interesting, and delicious. The staff were young and enthusiastic. All in all it was a great evening. I can't wait to go back. San Francisco needs more places like this.", "author": "tom c."}

That being said it was still a very \"young\"restaurant with opportunities for improvement but overall it was great.\nWe had the 4 course tasting menu which really is the best way to eat there - you get to try all their fabulous creations.\nThe service was fast and friendly although you could tell it's a chef-centric restaurant by the way they operated. Which is fine.\nI really appreciate their ambition! Neither chef comes from a long tenure at a big name restaurant - and you could tell - but in this case it was a good thing!\nTheir dishes were beautifully executed but a little rough around the edges too which was nice. So many restaurants play it safe and boring in order to please everyone but there was no compromising their vision here.\nHighlights:\nThey had nuts in every dish . THANK YOU. They are often ignored/underused \nSquab. Damn. Seriously amazing.\nOysters with cucumber water.\nThey didn't have anything with bacon and only one item with pork products in it. Now don't get me wrong I love bacon etc. But so many places fake flavor with it. These guys didn't.\nBest dish of the night: lamb tartars with beets. Or wait it had to have been the squab.

Bottom line...thumbs up.\n\nThis is definitely for all you foodies, I have been shifting toward more innovation myself so this enterprise is along these lines.  \n\nWe had the 4 course tasting with wine pairing, I had the beet soup (very tasty),  Squash White chanterelles Rapini Dried fruit Pineapple sage (very nice), Abalone pork cheeks (overall very good one abalone was a bit tough but that can happen sometimes with them), and for dessert the foie gras with some citrus tasting granita and caramelized nuts (OK, not sure the sour/savory worked for me).  Everything was beautifully presented.\n\nI must note that to kick things off we were given one Beausoleil oyster each with what tasted like cucumber juice, that was a nice touch.  I love oysters and the fact they presented a Beausoleil instead of the kumamoto that everyone seems to have was appreciated.\n\nLoved the wine pairing, they had a D. Ventura 'Pena do Lobo' 2008 mencia that I just loved, need to find a bottle!!\n\nService was good, only glitch was a knife was not replaced and while I was asked if I would like another brioche, my wife was not.\nBut overall we enjoyed it and would go back.", "author": "Ron B."}

We had heard such good things about this restaurant and could not believe our good fortune in getting a reservation.  I think the menu changes each month and perhaps we just got a bad month.  The courses were very small and all except 2 were simply vegetables and mushrooms prepared in various ways (and not many of them either).  Not very exciting at all, and for $98 pp not including wine pairing, I would have expected some interesting protein courses.  The two protein courses we had were a pork belly that was not even crisp on the outside (was just fatty pork), and a duck course which again was fatty and not very flavorful.  With all of the amazing dining options in San Francisco, these folks should step up their game.  I get wanting to showcase the vegetables from your fancy organic garden, but come on.  We felt foolish taking our family here who respects our taste in cuisine.  Shame on us for not trying it ahead of time.", "author": "Lisa K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-07", "description": "We were looking for a spot to have a quick dinner and had been wanting to try Sons & Daughters for some time, so we popped in... and, as it turns out, it was a mighty good call. We were immediately accommodated by the lovely hostess at a table by the (faux?) fireplace and served promptly and consistently during our power meal. The decor and atmosphere are instantly winning: the restaurant sports a retro vibe with chandeliers, a fireplace, and dark wooden tables (perhaps vestiges of the old restaurant that inhabited this locale not so long ago?), but with a refreshing modern and zen twist -- dark purple ceiling included. \n\nThe food is concept-based. You're really supposed to get four plates (which I believe is a fixed $54), because the portions are fairly teeny -- albeit strangely fulfilling -- and the idea is to get a taste of all of the adventurous, yet wildly successful and innovative, combinations of textures and flavors. Being on a time budget, we unfortunately did not, but have promised to go back to do it right next time. We did, however, verily enjoy the courses that we did get: my boyfriend was besotted with the roasted potato skin consomme with asparagus, black trumpets, leeks, and parmesan, and the juicy lamb with agastache, barley, fiddlehead, artichoke, and king trumpets; and I devoured -- nay! devastated -- the buttery-soft raw albacore with caviar, grapefruit, muscat, and micro-mint licorice, and the savory squab breast (claw and nails included!) with sunflower, ramps, nasturtium, and baby radish. (I especially and very strongly recommend the albacore.) \n\nAlthough the list of ingredients for each dish on the menu was, at first glance, somewhat overwhelming and seemingly excessive, each course is composed with such finesse and impeccable attention to detail (and by detail I mean not only aesthetic detail but also the micro-flavors of each drop, petal, and flake) that the result is a bewilderingly immaculate perfection and harmony of tastes. In fact, I was so shocked by how easy they make it seem, that it is only in retrospect that I can appreciate the intricacy of each elaborate composition... All the more reason to go back with more time to savor every delectable item on their (surprisingly condensed) menu.\n\nIndeed, the pervasive theme at Sons & Daughters seems to be understatement: from the menu, to the service, to the decor, to the actual cuisine, every element of this restaurant is a hybrid fusion of almost completely contrasting trends that are blended and refined with such flair and effortless elegance that it is utterly seamless. Thus, the experience is not only gratifying at the moment, but in fact grows a posteriori as well (as you may be able to tell by my ridiculously long review that I promise to wrap up soon).  \n\nTo add to this already exceptional experience, we were pleasantly surprised by the complimentary but equally inventive appetizer and dessert bites (an increasingly lost art), the home-made brioches, and the attentive wait-staff, which rounded off the meal nicely and were the ultimate icing on this post-modernist culinary cake. The bill sets you back a touch, but it is well worth it for the quality and creativity of the cuisine, the warm and chic ambiance, and the shockingly unassuming attitude of the restaurant and service. Overall, and without being particularly enthusiastic about the minimalist, deconstructionist gastronomical trend of late, I have to say that this is a fine example of all of the redeeming and superior features that this movement has to offer.", "author": "G.

An Herb salad with curds (I'd never eat goat cheese again if I could get my hands on that stuff) with eucalyptus?  Amazing.  The risotto was rich and creamy (raw egg, marscapone, and truffles).

I don't like my risotto smoked for nine hours until it tastes so intense I can barely eat it.  And even though I ordered the vegetarian menu, there were fish eggs on the first dish (they kindly made a new one when I brought it to their attention.  So I wouldn't say, honestly, that they are the most vegetarian-friendly restaurant I've ever been to.  That aside, they had, hands down, the best wine pairings I've ever had in my life.  They worked perfectly with the food and they were all something really special.  It is a rare and beautiful thing to have a wine pairing that is anywhere near the experience I had at Sons & Daughters.  The food aside was mostly very good.  But I felt like there was constantly something off about every dish.  As if, a vegetarian dish was a bit of an after-thought.  Nevertheless, no one I went with was a vegetarian and they all loved their meals.

And the flavors?  Meh.  Just meh.  There was nothing wrong with any of the dishes (except for the hamachi, which had been flash frozen too long so the flesh was soft and mealy) and the combination of the ingredients was pleasant and refined. However, for all the hype, I expected something more memorable.  For example, at Frances the chef makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.  Her dishes are wonderful surprises and yet not heavily sauced or overly fussy.  Nor were the flavor combinations really that new or different.  We had one of everything on the menu, and I thought the quail was the best dish. Oh, and the bread is sublime, but for $75 prix fixe and an inflated wine list (bring your own, corkage is $20 and worth it) it better be!
