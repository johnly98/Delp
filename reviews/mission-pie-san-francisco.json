I always make an effort to get a slice of pie here whenever I'm in the neighborhood. Slices are currently $4.85 per slice, which is more than reasonable. I love that their pies are on rotation based on whatever fruits/nuts are in season, and that all of their pies are full of actual pieces of fruit...versus other places that just have some kind of artificial-tasting puree. My favorite, if I had to pick one, would probably be the peach blackberry (add a scoop of ice cream if you're feeling a bit indulgent!)...although I have yet to eat a pie that I didn't like.\n\nThey are open for long hours, so it's also a great place to get some work done in or to catch up with friends if you can get a seat.", "author": "Clarice C."}

This place was super packed and the line couldn't move fast enough. The pies looked so good in the display. I wanted to buy a whole one, but seeing as this was my first time I figured I better try a slice first.\n\nThere were gigantic pieces of peach, fresh, very delicious, but then the crust was so thin, crispy and flaky. I was expecting a thicker and softer crust, certainly a crust that would be able to hold it's contents with each bite. The peaches were sliding out so easily, I had to place the crust back on top to eat them together.\n\nSo glad I didn't let my eyes get the best of me. For almost $5 a slice (and would have been $29 for a whole pie) it was just okay. Disappointed my craving wasn't satisfied.", "author": "Ash K."}

I've been to all of these nice ice cream places in SF and I've been wondering where all the pie is...\n\nAnyway, this place is warm and cozy. There's plenty of seating (even a dedicated kids table, which is adorable) and a sort of farm-to-table feel. I'm from the east coast, and there are tons of places like that. This definitely tasted like one of them.\n\nWe had the mixed berry/peach pie. The peach pie was pleasantly not too sweet, and the crust was perfect (I don't even like pie crust, but I did like this crust). The mixed berry was probably my favorite, it had a sugary-oaty topping and fresh fruit underneath. It's a small detail, but I like that they milk (in different sizes!) on their actual menu and not just the kids menu. I feel like too many places don't acknowledge the fact that who doesn't love a nice glass of milk with their baked goods??? They have other drinks too though if milk isn't your thing--pretty much your standard coffee and tea drinks. Also, they have a daily 'refresher'. Today's was watermelon and I'm pretty sure it was straight watermelon without the pulp. It tasted super fresh and like no sugar was added at all, which was amazing!", "author": "Claire C."}

It is good overall!\n\nThe ambience is low key and feels a bit like a retro diner mixed with a living room. They have games and some comfy chairs mixed in with metal tables of varying sizes. They also have some board games. It's a nice place to relax and pass some time! They have self serve water and utensils and you order at the counter. It tends to be busy but it's not usually difficult to find a seat when you need one. \n\nFood-wise, they serve a variety of sweet pies along with some savory pie and food options. They make excellent coffee drinks (love the Americano!). Everything is clearly made from scratch and the pie fillings are delicious. I have enjoyed the mixed berry and banana cream pie the most! I'm not a huge fan of their crust, which has a flaky, dry consistency as opposed to a more moist one. I think this is a preference mismatch as opposed to a failing, though. You can also add vanilla ice cream to your pie and the ice cream they serve is unusually good - it's creamy, indulgent and tastes like it is made with \"real\" ingredients. I also like that the portion sizes aren't overkill (they give you a size of slice that is just enough for you to feel satisfied, without feeling regretful! Haha!). \n\nLastly, most of the servers have been very nice and helpful, but I've had occasional weird interactions that were off putting. For example, I once asked what chess pie was and got a judgey response for not knowing that in a pie context, it's apparently pronounced \"chuss\". What? Why make a thing of this? Also, I'll admit that I'm a person who throws down money for expensive food on the regular, but for some reason I always leave feeling like this is expensive for what it is.", "author": "Christine G."}

Their pie is just sooooo good!\n\nI had a delicious mini banana cream pie to go the first time I went here.  My dad needed a pick-me-up, and banana cream pie is his favorite.  We usually go to Nation's in our hometown since that's the only pie place in our tiny city.  To no surprise, local bakery is far superior than mass-produced pies.  And the banana cream pie from Mission Pie is just beautifully made - a good crust with bite, sweet banana filling, with cream that didn't push the sweetness over the top.  I don't like whipped cream.  I usually push it off to the side.  Not for this pie.  It's all good, and best eaten in one bite.\n\nI went again to take my friend because I knew she would love this place.  She got a walnut pie, which is like a pecan pie.  I got a peach-blueberry crumble.  Each bite was so heavenly.  The pie really showcased the fruit, and if they added sugar, then they added the right amount because it seemed like it the sweetness was all from the fruit.\n\nThey also have coffee, teas, and alcohol available, as well as savory pies, which I need to try.\n\nIt's also a cute date place, but not sickly cute.  Some of the tables can be shared, and two gentlemen on a date sat next to my friend and I.  They actually ordered the same slices as us!  Well, they were talking, holding hands, looking lovingly at each other.  And it wasn't awkward to sit next to them at all.

My recommendations:\n\n-RASPBERRY CHESS PIE: I've never had a chess pie before, but was drawn in by the unique custard-looking consistency of the pie. Tasted like a firmer but equally as creamy egg tart, studded with tart raspberries. The neutral, salty crust complimented the sweetness of the filling quite well. \n-CHOCOLATE CREAM PIE: on the sweeter side. Same satisfying crust layered with a rich, chocolate cream then topped off with a generous layer of whipped cream. Liked the quality tasting chocolate -- deep and rich, no artificial chocolate pudding taste or anything. \n\nHowever, my friend tried the peach cobbler and another fruit tart but found them less appetizing. We both agreed those fell a bit flat, similar to putting macerated fruit on top of a dry crust. Would've been nice with some ice cream or custard filling.", "author": "Patricia Z."}

I came here with a friend at around 8pm on a Saturday and it was packed! Even though there was limited seating, there was a high turnover rate, so just wait your turn, and you're bound to grab a seat soon! There are plenty of pie options, from sweet to savory. I got the Shaker Lemon, which is a lemon peel pie with a crust that is used in apple pies and such. I didn't expect the pie to be made of lemon peels (which they added plenty of sugar to counteract the sourness), but it was delicious when eaten with the crust, so the filling isn't too overwhelming. The service was great and efficient. Overall, I would definitely come back if I'm in the area to try more of their pies!!", "author": "Lisa C."}

It was the right amount of banana paired with a handsome amount of cream and the crust was just right. The lemon shaker was also tasty but too tart for my liking. Both were fair on the sugar levels and it wasn't overkill.\n\nThe lemonade here was also really tart!

However, one of the things that I do enjoy from time to time is a good piece of pie.  Growing up in the south, pecan pie and apple pie are two standards that I absolutely have grown to love.  That being said, when I was recommended to come here on a date, I leapt at the chance to not only meet someone new but to try out a very famous pie place in my new home here in the Bay.\n\nI have to admit, I was blown away at this apple pie.  It came out warm and of course, I had to have it with ice-cream (a la mode).  The pie was very generous with the apple filling - to me this is very important.  If there is too much juice, it can make the pie crust somewhat soggy.  However, if the apple to crust ratio is just right, then you not only have a nice, rich, and abundant filling, you also end up with a ridiculously good and still flaky crust.\n\nI'd totally come here again to get another slice.  It's difficult to find a good pie, especially one that is made fresh.  While definitely not something that is blowing my socks off, I am sincerely a fan.", "author": "Vera L."}

Like I always tell my friends, I don't want cake for my birthday, I want pie! My friend was essentially taking me on a dessert tour of SF and since we were at Anthony's, we walked a couple blocks to get to Mission Pie on a sunny beautiful Sunday. There was a small line and not too many tables available since there were two tables reserved for a party. It has a very cute coffeehouse feel to it and it's an order and sit down type of establishment. My friend said their banana cream pie was his favorite so we got that to share. The waters were conveniently placed near the cashier with the utensils and napkins. The bathroom is one stall unisex that is a little strangely located, where you need to walk through the bakery.\n\nAs for the banana cream pie, it was amazing! The crust was flaky and so buttery which contrasted the sweet banana pudding and banana slices. I think if I had a whole slice by myself, it would have definitely been a guilty pleasure but sharing it was perfect. I was so satisfied with my sweet tooth after the pie. I can't wait to come back to try their other pie flavors like chocolate cream pie!", "author": "Ada C."}

Mission Pie flaunts a fun and relaxed atmosphere. Up front by the cash register, theres a section to purchase fresh flowers and fruit. Every Monday an artist is chosen to play live music. \n\nWhen we arrived, a bit of a line had already formed. Luckily, it wasn't long enough to make us feel too antsy. When we made it to the front of the line, we were greeted by a kind and quirky staff member who patiently answered all of our questions. I was pleased to see that there were plenty of vegan and dairy free options available for both pies and lunch. We ultimately sprang for the vegan mixed berry pie with vanilla syrup on top! Syrups are 25 to 50 cents extra, and a scoop of ice cream can be added for a dollar or so more. \n\nThe pie was delicious! It wasn't as sweet as I expected, which I quite liked considering we had purchased the vanilla syrup to drizzle on top. As always, my favorite part of the pie was the crust! Perfectly flakey and a beautiful match for the juice of the berries. My only regret is sharing the slice with my boyfriend rather than fighting him for it.

So don't expect a hostess to seat you, and if there's no seats you just have to wait for one. \n\nWe got a Raspberry Rhubarb mini pie with a scoop of Vanilla bean ice cream ($7 + 1.50 for ice cream + tax = $9.20 total). They give you a placard which you put on your table and they deliver the food to you. The mini pie was a good size for two people to share, and a better deal than getting two slices ($4.50 each) for two people. They should have put more ice cream though, we barely got a scoop. The ice cream made made the pie so much better. The pie itself had the nice buttery flaky crust I was looking for, but the rhubarb and raspberry combo was much too sour. I like that they use real ingredients as you can actually see the rhubarb cuts, but they should cut it smaller imo. I'm excited to come back and try their tons of other flavors, like banana cream pie, multi berry, strawberry rhubarb, and white peach tayberry!!\n\nNo free wifi even though their website says they do.

The crust is drier and overall the filling is sweeter.  The exception seems to be the Shaker lemon pie, which is extremely bitter (it's traditionally sweet/tart). I will say that the pot pie remains delicious -  the chicken is far better than the others.\n\nThe last time I brought home a piece of pie it was less than half the normal size.  I mean it was almost shockingly small (if one can be shocked by pie).  That might have been a one time thing, but I'm not in a hurry to find out.\n\nThe portions of the set dinners, of entree/greens/grain, are too small, at least for takeout. I've had the same dinner (pork) twice and the first time it was super delicious, but the second time the pork was almost flavorless and kind of dry.  Which was just frustrating.\n\nThe iced coffee has a problem that is one of my pet peeves (mentioned in my other reviews). The coffee cubes - ice cubes made out of coffee - have an unpleasant aftertaste. Imho, coffee cubes need be to be made with filtered water, in a freezer with nothing that has an odor, and used almost immediately. But at least one of those things isn't happening.\n\nI just generally get the sense that there's some carelessness and/or inexperience at play that's leading to a quality decline. I'll stop in when I'm craving chicken pot pie, but otherwise not so much.  I hope this is just a bump in the road and Mission Pie will return to its original excellence", "author": "Joe B."}

I remember coming here often, but I hadn't come here as an adult after I started living in San Francisco. I'm not sure how I made excuses for so long... probably because I never BART to the 24th and Mission station for anything anymore. I should, since it's so conveniently close by.\n\nFor my 26th birthday, one of my best friends made my dreams come true by buying me a strawberry apple pie from Mission Pie. My eyes lit up as she opened the box, and I had to stop myself from grabbing a fork and digging right in. I needed to grab the ice cream, of course. Caramel swirl ice cream sounded like it would go well with strawberry apple pie.\n\nLike a decent human being that likes to share her pie, I cut it into slices, divvied it up, and scooped ice cream on top of all the servings. Totally worth the short wait. I was in heaven and wanted to cry out of happiness. I wouldn't want to eat Mission Pie ALL the time, for fear of losing it's appeal, but I do want to try more of their fruity pies, like apple and pear blueberry. It seems like some think Mission Pie is overrated, but it's my go-to place when I start feeling that pie craving coming on.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

Let me just say this, the pies aren't cheap but it's delicious and worth your money. My friend bought an apple pie from here couple years ago and it was literally love at first sight. The apple pie isn't super sweet which is good because the ones you buy at Safeway supermarket is just full on sugar and sweetness. After my first apple pie experience, I decided to order pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving. The pumpkin pie was $29 (it's a bit on the expensive end) but it's to die for. I've been ordering their pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving for the last three years now. The ordering process is super easy too. You just go on their website and you pick which pies you want then pay for it. After that, you pick which day you want to pick up on either Tuesday or Wednesday before Thanksgiving then you just show up and tell them your name then wait for your pie to come out. Super easy process! They have other things on the menu like quiche which I never tried but I would love to one day. \n\nThe only downside to this place is parking sucks. Obviously you're in the Mission area so you'll have to park on the meters or if you're lucky in the neighborhoods couple blocks away but usually its pretty difficult to find one during the afternoon hours.

I picked this pie up for a dapper group of amazing friends to enjoy since I was on that side of town. We went with the White Peach with a berry (I cannot recall the berry) and as usual it was out of this world amazing.  Their crust is the best crust I have EVER had.  I am OG from the Bay,  but am not living in the South.  Let's just say the Texas jokers have a lot to learn from you!  Sheesh, happy lil tummies were in the house!

For $8.50 I could get a burrito or even a bowl of pho. Taste-wise, nothing grand or special; something you can make at home. Crust is pretty good though. \n\n**Apple Pie: probably one of the worst homemade Apple pies I have ever seen. Usually pies hold together fairly well when cut into slices but this is just a damn shame. Basically just crust filled with seasoned apples (which were cut terribly); filling was completely nonexistent. \n\nSERVICE: okay but needs improvement. We ordered a slice of apple pie, she asked if we wanted that first while waiting for our pot pies so we said yes. It never came, no biggie. We ate our pot pies first, finished it, 10 minutes after no apple pie so we went to politely ask. They apologized and said they'll bring it right up, 15 minutes later...we finally got the apple pie....only to see what it looked like. \n\nPARKING: in the mission so completely nightmare to find parking.

Its your typical pot pie but mini version....carrot, peas, chicken...it was kinda watery but the juice had some flavor. The crust of the pie was crispy in a way. It was a decent dish. Its best if you get their dessert pie. $8.50 is quite expensive for this dish.\n\nI also had their Banana cream pie: $4.50 a slice. You can get whole pie if you want for $27. I would give this pie a 4 stars. It was very yummy. It was light, fresh, and creamy. They used real bananas. They give decent size if you eat it by slice\n\nThis place can gets really busy there was a nice before and after i came. Rarely any seats are open.

It's got a buttery crust set in wavy edges. The creamy filling tastes like pudding with fresh banana slices that blend in smoothly. Lastly, the pie is topped with surprisingly light whipped cream. It's sweet and satiating, but not too sweet. All this time I thought I wasn't a pie person (with the exception of pumpkin pies). Maybe I am a pie person. Maybe I've been eating the wrong pies all this time.\n\nSlices are ~$4 w/ Straus whipped cream, $1.50 to add Straus vanilla bean ice cream.\nWhole pies are $27.\n\nThe pies all look very rustic and homemade, not the perfectly uniform style. There are a lot of sweet pies - fruit & nut options. They also serve meat pies, vegetable galettes, and quiches. I'd be more interested in trying a savory option for a return visit.\n\nFor a small business, Mission Pie is a pretty large venue. It's very commendable that Mission Pie's business is so community-minded. They're all about sustainability. All the ingredients are sourced locally. They sell items from local distributors including fresh flowers and display local artists' work.

The peas quiche tasted bland and there was no ricotta flavor. \n\nI tried the pbj pie on a whim to see how they could surprise me. The pie was just a slab of peanut butter and little smear of jelly on top. How unoriginal. I was hoping they would make a light peanut butter filling and incorporate a fresh and un-sugary jam.\nI could have smeared peanut butter and jelly on my bread at home. \n\nI spent $9 on such poorly made food.

This review is on my last experience, and not my overall experience, but it frustrated me enough that I felt it justified an overall review of 2 stars. To be fair, the pie is always pretty good and probably 4/5 stars. \n\nThe reason for my 2 stars: \n\nI was completely lied to by the guy who handed me my 2 slices of pie, simply because it was busy and he wanted to move on. \n\nWe ordered 2 slices of pie and a side of whipped-cream. The slices always come in very small cardboard to-go boxes, and the two boxes are always stacked on-top of each other and tied together with a string. The whipped cream always comes in a small 8 oz paper coffee cup with a coffee cup lid. \n\nWhen I was handed my 2 slices, I asked for my whipped cream. He told me it was in the box. I said I wanted it on the side. He then told me it was in a cup inside the box. Since the box looked too small to fit the cup and the whipped cream, I checked and saw that it was dolloped on the pie. I explained to him that we weren't going to eat the pie for a few hours and originally asked for it on the side. He stood there for a few seconds before asking (in a a non-inviting way) to redo them. I said, no worries and left. \n\nAfter walking out the door, it occurred to me that he flat out lied to me. There was no way that one of those 8 oz cups would even fit in the box on it's own, but if it did fit, there's NO way it would fit in there without completely crushing the slice of pie. He didn't think I would be able to peek into the pie box the way they were tied together, so he just told me what he thought would get me out the door. \n\nThe mistake, I cared a little about but I know they were busy so I could get over it and understand completely. The lie.... well that was just so frustrating as a loyal customer.", "author": "Kristen M."}

Secondly, a high quality pie should have fresh ingredients and in their case, the pumpkin and apple taste fresh.

Not joking. \n\nThis place is perfect for an afternoon snack or even a post-dinner stroll when you're craving pie. They also serve tea/coffee/drinks in cafe fashion, but the PIE is what they're known for. I'm glad they only serve pies because if they start introducing cakes and pastries, it would take away from their signature dish! Having a nut allergy, I looked at all of the pie crusts with wariness...especially because I'm pretty allergic. The cashier confidently told me that all of the pies were nut-free except the one with walnuts...so I was VERY ECSTATIC to learn that the strawberry apple one was safe.\n\nThe ambiance is very open-space, loft-ish, and clean/bakery-organic style. All of the workers have that sound-of-music/apron-wearing/flour-on-face vibe that makes you feel like the pies here are baked with love and warmth.

Pie, of course! I was sad to find out that they didn't have blueberry pie (my absolute favorite type of pie), so I settled for a slice of the banana cream. My boyfriend ordered a slice of walnut pie with fresh whipped cream on top. \n\nMy pie was good, but not great. I appreciated that the banana pudding appeared homemade with specks of vanilla bean inside and was perfectly balanced in sweetness, but the texture was a little too gelatinous for my taste and not as soft and custardy as I expected. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed his pie more, which tasted like a nice twist on a pecan pie without being cloyingly sweet. My biggest complaint with both pies was the crust. I've had some amazing pie crusts, so this one just didn't cut it. Instead of being light and flaky, the crust on both pies was tough, nutty, and very hard. It almost seemed overbaked, but I couldn't figure out if it was on purpose or not. I reluctantly ate the crust because I was hungry, but wish I could have just left it there.\n\nThe place itself is bright, airy, and hipster. You order at the front, get a little placard for your table, and they bring you your order once you're seated. Prices were fair (~$4 for a slice of pie), and there were no real complaints with service besides the cashier failing to tell my boyfriend that the whipped cream that she asked if he wanted would be extra. We didn't find out until we checked the bill. Oops. Besides pies, they also do scones, muffins, and coffee cake, among others. I tried a sample of the coffee cake at the front and it was really good.

To be fair, pie is my favorite dessert, so I'm somewhat biased... In any case, the location is convenient, the pie is amazing, and the atmosphere is laid-back and great for casual hanging out!\n\nA few pies that I've tried and highly recommend:\n- Banana Cream: I think everyone recommends this, and it's no surprise. The banana cream is just the right amount of creamy and delicious. It's not overwhelmingly sweet or fatty (at least, it seems that way...no guarantees on actually nutritional value).\n- Pear Raspberry: This is a winning combination of fruit tastes: sweet, mild pear and tart-y raspberry go together really well. It's not overbearingly sweet or artificially fruity.\n\nThe crust is always perfectly baked and crispy, not soggy or hard, which is the case with more inferior pies. It's pretty impressive that the pie is (usually) served cold but still so delicious. It's also really impressive that they charge $4 a slice (about 1/6 of a pie) and I'm still giving them 5 stars.\n\nIf you love pie, you need to stop by.

I'm someone who will try all those funky pies, but in the end I'm someone who wants the comforting, familiar pie. \n\nThat pie is the banana cream pie. It is soooo yummy!

Banana cream pies are normally stacked as follows:\n\nWhipped cream on top\nVanilla custard\nSlices of banana\nCrisp crust\n\nAnd Mission Pie's d-d-d-dominates! It's so crispy, not at all soggy, and I particularly like the strong vanilla essence.

I see restaurants all around adding surcharges, raising prices, etc.\n\nHigher prices I can take.\nPassive-aggressive SF employer mandates surcharge I will put up with.\nExtra charge for this or that, understood.\n\n*Provided* you make it clear to me in advance of my purchase what the price is going to be so I can make an informed decision.\n\nSurprises on the check are not okay.\n\nSo when you start charging for whipped cream on the pie you need to put it on your menu right near the price of the pie. Tonight, I didn't see a Whipped cream +.25 anywhere.\n\nHad you told me ahead of time, I likely would have happily paid it. Instead, you've lost me as a customer.\n\nThe sad part is I know what I'm missing. Instead of win-win, it's lose-lose.\n\nSo, 5 stars for the food minus 2 stars for the dis equals 3 stars for the review.\n\nBye, Mission Pie.", "author": "Charles B."}

I've been back to San Francisco more times than I can count, and now I'm just discovering this little gem. Mission Pie is THE TRUTH.\n\nI wanted to take back something sweet that my wife could snack on, so based off a suggestion from my friend, he suggested that we visited Mission and get a pie. When I think pies, I think to myself... if I take an entire pie back, it's just not going to hold up well on the plane ride. Well, when I heard they have the option to sell by the slice and how tightly they packaged it, I was sold.\n\nTheir menu is fairly simple, consisting of ten different pie flavors: apple, vegan raspberry, pear raspberry, walnut, sweet potato, cranberry chess, apple blackberry, banana cream, shaker lemon, and pear blueberry. They might be subject to change up their flavors, but the last two times I've visited, it's remained fairly consistent. \n\nIf you go by the slice, it costs $4.00, with complementary Straus Family Creamery organic whipped cream. For an additional $1.50, you can add a scoop of organic Vanilla Bean ice cream. Totally worth it if you plan to eat in!", "author": "Steve N."}

Fresh, seasonal fruit pies in a very quaint and a little kitch atmosphere. \n\nI've always had lovely service here. Last night I ordered two slices of Apple,  a decaf Americano and coffee cake to go. They threw in a broken piece of Apple on top of what ordered, which was generous. I think the prices are very fair, especially for SF. \n\nI will say that I've gotten a few bits of pretty dry crust, but the long flake makes up for it. I appreciate the lack of sweetness since the fruit tends to be pretty sweet already. \n\nFor those who complain about the fruit being in its mostly unchanged form, why would you want good market-fresh fruit to be cooked with a shit load of sugar? I would rather experience high quality fruit that needs minimal prep. I love that the whipped cream on my pie was unsweetened, or maybe barely sweet. It paired with the apple pie nicely. \nCoffee is always great too.\n\nMission pie does a great job or attracting a diverse crowd and they have a diverse staff which is really lovely to see.", "author": "Natalie J."}

My family always keeps the pie next to the rice cooker. Apple, peach, banana cream, mud, pot, 3.14, etc. I've had plenty of them all! Pie is the appetizer before the meal where I was raised so I could make a great argument for why Mission Pie is one of the best.\n\nCrust: Light, not too thick and not too buttery. Cooked to perfection and really balances out the fillings. I do, however,think the crust could use a tad more butter.. But then again, I think everything can use more butter.\n\nFilling: So far, I've had the Banana Cream, Apple Rhubarb, Mixed Berry and Strawberry Rhubarb. The filling really makes these pies go from good to great! Not too sugary and plenty flavorful. Also, their filling to crust ratio is on point.\n\nService: I usually call in my orders if I need full pies and the workers are very nice. I suggest calling ahead and asking what time your pies will be made. Sometimes they don't finish baking until 10:00-11:00am. They get me in and out quick, love it!\n\nMission Pie is always a solid choice. I HIGHLY recommend the Banana Cream since it's one of the best I've had.

I decided on the strawberry apple pie. Apple is my all time favorite pie and if you add strawberry, one of my favorite fruits, it only makes it better. I would say this was a good slice of pie but not the best. There was not enough fruit inside for me. Also they rely on the natural sweetness of the fruit. There is not a lot of added sugar or even very much of the gooey apple sauce in between the slices of fruit. This is a personal preference because you might like it to be a little dryer and less sweet. The crust was great and there was a bit of a crumble on top. Also since I was going to see a friend the next day, I picked up a mini pie for them. They only offered one that day and it happened to be the strawberry apple pie. A slice is almost five bucks and then the mini pie is about $8. Not bad. They take credit cards. And I wasn't asked if I wanted it to go or to enjoy there. But they must've assumed I was taking it to go because of all the pie I bought. Haha. But after they delivered it to me, I settled into one of the few tables/chairs and ate my slice there.

Verdict? Good pie, but nothing special.  They taste fresh and they're made with locally sourced/organic ingredients when possible (which is a huge plus), but I didn't have that wow factor that I was looking for. If I were judging on taste alone, I think Nation's pies are just as good, if not better. \n\nThe blackberry peach pie felt like it was lacking fruit and a lil bit of sugar. I think there were a total of 3 peach slivers and a few blackberries tossed in, with a sprinkling of crumb topping. I wanted more fruit! And more crumb topping! The homemade whipped cream didn't taste like there was any sugar added either, which means I got all the calories without the flavor! The Banana Cream Pie was the better of the two. The bananas were firm and fresh and not at all brown and mushy. The custard was light, creamy, sweetened perfectly, and topped with a satisfying layer of cream. I was hoping both of the crusts would be thicker and flakier, but they were thin and walking a fine line between a stale and flaky texture.\n\nWhole pies are ~$22 and slices are $3.50-4.00. They also have a wide array of coffee drinks, along with tea and milk options on the menu. Cash only!\n\nI still think Mission Pie is a great place to sit down with a friend and enjoy a slice of pie.

The moment you walk out of the BART station, you KNOW your no longer in FiDi district.  And because of the recent iPhone snatching that occurred in this area, I was on my guard as we walked down the street to this location.

That was really easy.\n\nAs you enter, you can't help but notice the patrons happily devouring slices of pie.  That is always a good sign.  In the pie window case, there were different types of pies that looks like grand-ma-ma baked them.

When I finally decided to buy a slice, I got in line with one other person ahead of me.  What I noticed is the cashier was ubber nice to that lady ahead of me.  But when my turn came up, the cashier turned her smile upside down and wasn't very courteous or friendly.  She took my order, my money and didn't bother to thank me, even though I thanked her.  When my pie came out in a box, she handed it to me with a frown and I tried to get her to smile or say something nice to me by offering my Thank You.  Nope...not a peep out of her.  Not cool. 1 point deducted due to bad customer service to me.  \n\nI compared my notes with my co-worker.  She bought several whole pies and I thought maybe they were nicer to her.  But her reaction was that she acted weird towards her.  So, we both didn't have good service from the same cashier.  \n\nEven with this sad service, the pies speak for themselves.

I opted for whipped cream on the mixed berry, since my child tend to love whipped cream.\n\nThe mixed berry was ridiculous. No form at all, just a slopped mess on the plate. There were whole strawberries in it, making it more troublesome to eat than a slice of pie should be. It was incredibly mediocre; the flavors were not fresh. The pie was more or less bland until you got to the end crust which, with the berry liquid baked into it, tasted nice. The whipped cream was a MISTAKE. It had the most unpleasant noxious flavor and lacked sweetness almost entirely. \n\nThis famous banana cream pie... I do not get it. I didn't come in with unreachably high expectations; I'm not the type to base my opinion on what I see on Yelp (my friend had suggested this place). It was, as I said before, incredibly mediocre. The filling lacked much flavor, the cream lacked sweetness, and the crust was brittle. \n\nSpending $9.28 on two slices of pie should've resulted in a much more pleasing experience, not one that left me feeling completely \"meh\".\n\nLastly, the decor is annoying. I rarely let a food place's decor affect my opinion too much as long as it isn't filthy, but Mission Pie clearly needs to get its life together. A lame painting of Paris Hilton? Really? Come on. It's giant right on the wall when you walk in. I cannot.\n\nSorry, I won't be back, Mission Pie.", "author": "Liz G."}

They offered a coffee station complete with sugar/milk for patrons in line and they came around with a bowl of fresh mini mandarins, while I waited in line in the store. What a sweet gesture and greatly appreciated! \n- There was a local vendor setup in the store promoting and selling cute totes for picnics and groceries, nice that they support local businesses. \n- Pear and raspberry pie: must try! scrumptious large pieces of pear with raspberry and topped with a crumble top. It's the perfect amount of tart and sweet and absolutely delicious with a side of ice cream to pair with it. Guaranteed a hit dessert for any gathering! \n\nImprovements\n- Showed up about 20 mins after they started serving the first come, first serve walk-ins and they were already out of both pumpkin and walnut pies by the time I got to the register. No biggie, since I got to get 3 pies including a few of my favorite pear and raspberry but bummed I wasn't able to try these classics that others have raved about. \n\nTips\n- Parking is hard to find in this neighborhood, street and metered parking only. \n- They also serve savory mini pies, which I definitely need to try: chicken pot pie (sold out for the day when I arrived in store), Italian wedding, and minestrone.

For some time, I've been meaning to try their pies and finally went in last night for dessert. Perhaps my sojourns in the Midwest have spoiled me, but I still think San Francisco needs a pie shop with more oomph. We all know San Francisco takes its coffee seriously and we know we're \"no joke\" about local and farm-to-table cuisine, but down-to-earth hearty American staples like an all-around-exclusively-sells-pie pie shop?... I'm still in the search for one.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered a slice of the banana cream pie and apple pie. Because they are classics, I like to measure a pie shop on the classics and then get into the \"creative\"/\"nouveau cuisine\" stuff later. Well, unfortunately, I thought both were (in the words of the 2-star Yelp barometer) \"meh.\" \n\nThe banana cream pie, at its most basic, was just too custardy for my liking. I was hoping for an airer filling with large chunks of fresh banana and dollops of whipped cream. I was expecting the words \"refreshing!\" to jump out of my mouth with verve. This felt and tasted more like banana-flavored vanilla jello. Moreover, there were only a few slices of banana which - to me - is the central component of a classic banana cream pie. For the apple pie, I ordered it with whipped cream (which is complimentary). Since they posted a big sign that says, \"it's apple pie season,\" I was more than compelled to taste it. And again, much to my surprise, I was slightly disappointed. The apple pie filling needed more spices and the apples themselves seemed a bit over-baked. It wasn't that hearty, warm, gives-you-all-the-feels apple pie you expect. It wasn't homey and on the other extreme, it wasn't luxurious either. Sadly, the apple pie was quite generic and almost like an apple pie you'd get from Marie Callender's (which actually might've been slightly tastier based on this pie experience). Lastly, the crust on both pies was also un-memorable. It wasn't golden or rich (and frankly, buttery) enough. When you bite into a slice of pie, you need to get a little bit of filling, topping, and crust... and the boring crust almost marred the other flavors because it was so bland. \n\nThe pie shop itself is quaint. The wooden tables and chairs, accoutrement, and \"country\" feel attempt to evoke true-blue Americana in the middle of a cosmopolitan metropolis like San Francisco. It's a good place to meet a friend, go on a date, or take family to when they're in town.\n\nTrust me. I don't like writing less than glowing reviews for a place --- especially a pie shop! But there are definitely better pies elsewhere. In the case of San Francisco, I hope another pie aficionado out there decides to enter the \"pie market.\" There are some vendors in the city who bake delicious pies, but don't have a store. We need more Hoosier Mama (Chicago), Bang Bang (Chicago), Pie Hole (LA) and 4 & 20 Blackbirds (NYC) pie shop types out here! Sigh. Sadly, Mission Pies wasn't doing it for me. And like always, I will give this place another try down the road, but for now, I think I'll make my own pies at home.", "author": "James Z."}

I'll start with the crust, it was phenomenal. Just the right amount of flakiness and sweetness. My friends loved their fruit slices, but I can't say I was the biggest fan of the Lemon. Maybe it's just me but I wasn't keen on the amount of zest that was in the Lemon Shaker Pie, it made it very bitter. But maybe that's just the way Lemon Shaker Pie is supposed to be and it's just not my cup of tea. When they offer you the homemade whipped cream make sure to get it, it's super tasty and fresh.

I love the idea of supporting local businesses, and I appreciate their business model. I know that like many businesses in the area that have tried to stay afloat in this era of gentrification in the Mission, they had to raise their prices. However, my friends and I were shocked that pies that once sold for $22 are now $27. The woman who works there said it was due to a raise in rent. I'm not surprised, but I was surprised with the automatic tipping screen that popped up on the tablet when I paid. In total, the pie was about $31. \n\nFor those of you who have just moved into the neighborhood in the last 2 years, you may not think that $5-6 is a big deal, but that's because you just moved into the neighborhood, and you have no idea what it used to be like. This increase in price is indicative of a larger movement toward catering to a population of rich, privileged people who think that this neighborhood came into existence when they moved here.

I was actually quite surprised at the latter part...I may have just been lucky that day.\n\nFinding seating can be difficult as it's a small place. Note that this is cash only!\n\nNow let's get this straight: I hate bananas. No...it's more like I'm phobic of bananas. However, my coworker, who also hates bananas, swears by this banana cream pie. I was like, \"Wut? Dude, I thought we HATED BANANAS TOGETHER,\" and he was like, \"I know, I know, but trust me...and here. Here is a whole dollar toward getting a slice of banana cream pie for the table.\"\n\nHe gives me a dollar. Dammit, I will not let my pride and fear of bananas get in the way of my enjoyment of life. So at first I order a savory quiche because I realize I hadn't had dinner yet and book club was happening SO SOON, and I also ordered tea. I was pleasantly surprised at their tea selection. When a place thinks tea is important enough to carry not just a single brand of loose leaf tea, I trust them. +10 points to Gryffin -- Mission Pie!\n\nThe quiche was pretty amazing. I'm no quiche expert, but I have an allergy to eggs that are not all the way cooked. These are cooked perfectly. Not dry, not rubbery...it's as if the egg was on the cusp of being too cooked. Wow. Such quiche.\n\nAlso, the walnut pie was amazing. That's the one I got for myself.\n\nAnd the thrilling conclusion to the banana cream pie? I bought one and took it home for the boyfriend, who enjoys banana cream pie. He said it was quite good (though his father makes a better one) and so I tried it.\n\nIt was delicious.\n\nI may no longer be *that* phobic of bananas anymore if they can taste that delicious. So thank you, Mission Pie, for allowing me to enjoy a food I've been avoiding my whole life.\n\nThings to do next: Pi^2, or, Pi and Mission Pie.", "author": "Robbin A."}

I ordered 2 pies for $22 each, which may seem a little steep but the pies were actually quite large. The party that I tried to feed were all hungry tennis players, so I really needed to get more than an average amount of food. I took the Bart here on 24th and walked a block.

Alright let's take a step back, I tried this kind of pie for the first time a week before I began this pie craving habit, and had a bite of banana cream pie from my bf. We bought it at Nation's, I tried a bite and though, hmm not bad (and this is coming from someone who irks at the thought of whipped cream). I visit Mission Pie's page and instantly craved their pies, more specifically their fruit pies, pot pies, everything but cream pies! \n\nI finally convinced my bf to come here with me on Labor Day as part of our Mondate. I bought a slice of raspberry peach pie and he got banana cream pie. Each was roughly $4 and slightly smaller than Nation's, in case you were wondering. However, when it comes down to taste, hands down Mission Pie gets it. The crust was buttery and crispy and well balanced by the tartness of the fruits.

I tend to like my fruit pies/tarts more overcooked, where you can barely detect where one slice ends and the next one starts. This one wasn't quite there with the fruit still holding a little bit of crunch, but that's just personal preference. I also found it was a bit too sweet/syrup-y, a little overglazed on top as well.\n\n* Pumpkin Pie - 4 stars\nphoto: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-pie-san-francisco?select=Jz7jgSaw6sDIRqFncvqkRg#NuPt-syJwxvGKDcILgS3bw\nNICE. Nice, nice nice. Really natural flavors - we even detected Chai, or something close to it! My only small complaint was the crust was a little hard.\n\n* Banana Cream - 4 stars\nNice as always - love the fresh slices of banana, and their cream is fantastic (I always ask for it on the side with all slices of sweet pie we get - it has this fluffy yet creamy/dense consistency, and is't overly sweet).\n\n* Split Pea Quiche w/ Goat Cheese - 4.5 stars\nphoto: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-pie-san-francisco?select=Jz7jgSaw6sDIRqFncvqkRg#n6z2dWYXrpNmNxzOl3cqmQ\nNow this was the big surprise of the night! Being as I have a major sweet tooth, I never even considered getting a savory pie here (considering it a \"waste\" of my stomach space), but my friend opted for this and I REALLY liked it! The consistency was incredibly smooth and soft and it had a fantastic subtle savory flavor. Plus, the crust on this one was more flaky and buttery (especially compared to the pumpkin pie).

The staff is friendly.\n\nAnd yesterday I just discovered they are kid friendly too. OMG. They have a kids table with toys. High chair. Changing table! \n\nI have been here so many times but never truly appreciated it until now how good they are and hence this review. \n\nFirst about the pie --- my favorite flavors are banana cream and mixed berry. The only one flavor I never liked is Meyer lemons because I thought they would be tart but they are not.\n\nThen yesterday I went in for lunch. The staff was uber patient as he let me sample both stews and picked the sausage beans. It came in a bowl with delicious brown rice and kale. My kid and I devoured it along with a broccoli cheese quiche. \n\nThe ambience is just right. People who go there sometimes just pick up a pie and leave. Some stay and chat. There's no real pressure to leave as soon as you are done unless there are people waiting for empty seating (which only happens in evening). Rarely is there a line and even so it moves fast. \n\nI'm so happy this place is close to me.

They have a great selection of sweet pies as well as savory pies, and are now serving soup from 11 AM - 8 PM. \n\nThoughts on Mission Pie:\n\nFood- It's a strange thing to say, but Mission Pie gets better as you eat it. The first time I had it, I thought it was just alright. The more I eat it, the more I crave it- and Mission will continually surprise you. Stop in often because there are seasonal pies that you'll miss if you don't go for a while. Currently, my favorites are the pear raspberry pie (the crumble on top is the best thing ever) and pumpkin pie (reach chunks of sweet pumpkin). The savory pies were just okay. I've heard their coffee is also quite good.\n\nGeneral ambiance- Great place for a catch up or a post-date dessert. Outside seating for those rare sunny SF days.\n\nService- People are really nice here when it's not busy.\n\nTips - Get the whipped cream! They make it onsite with organic Strauss milk, it comes complimentary with every pie and is just a tad sweet, so goes well with those tart pies. Once you order the whipped cream, it's important that you check that the whip cream is there if you're taking it togo- they forget to do this a lot.", "author": "Margaret T."}

So it's very tart, and very bitter, but also a little sweet and overall a taste explosion in your mouth. Overall I found the pie to be good but not great. Maybe a little too bitter for my taste. Almost as if there was too much pith in the lemon peel (the white part of the peel that isn't very palatable). The crust didn't really blow me away either but in all honest I rarely go nuts for a pie crust. It's the filling that I'm after. \n\nI've heard great things about a few of the other slices so I'd definitely go back and give another a try. I went on a Saturday night and it wasn't very crowded but there also wasn't much to choose from. They'd had a busy day, I guess! Hope the next time I come in I catch them with more stock. The banana cream in particular has got my name alllll over it.", "author": "Annette J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-27", "description": "NOTE: This review is solely for the banana cream pie.\n\nI'm not an expert on pies, nor food in general. The most important thing to me is very simple. How does it make me feel after taking the first bite?\n\nMy first bite of the banana creme pie was very good, but it wasn't nearly as mind boggling as my first bite of Nation's. The main difference lies in the crust and whipped cream.\n\nMission's crust was very thin and got completely lost in combination with the banana custard and whipped cream. It didn't taste very buttery and as a result, didn't add much to the pie at all. Nation's crust is buttery and flaky, and was substantial enough to hold its own among everything else.\n\nWhile I could tell that Mission's whipped cream was freshly whipped, it didn't have the fluffy texture of Nation's, which I feel works better on a banana creme pie. However, this is just me nitpicking. Both whipped creams were exceptional.\n\nAs for the banana custard itself, Mission's had a stronger banana taste and less custard-y consistency than Nation's. It was good, I just wish it had more bananas to give a little more bite.\n\nI hope to come back and try some of their other pies, especially the savory pot pies. From the looks of everything else I anticipate giving Mission Pie a higher rating for my second review. The downside is that everything here is expensive ($4 per slice of pie, $24 for most whole pies). But that is expected of any artisan shop, especially in San Francisco.\n\nTLDR -- Banana cream pie was good, but Nation's version is better in my honest opinion.", "author": "Vincent C."}

Kind of random from the Mission district in SF, but when I got back from my vacation I realized I've never been to a specialty pie shop in the bay. And so began the search for some good Bay Area pie.\n\nWhen searching on yelp, there were numerous pie shops in SF with great reviews. Lots to choose from but decided to go with this one: Mission Pie. No regrets! Sometimes good yelp reviews and actual experiences don't match up... But that isn't the case here. Here's what we tried\n\nBanana Cream \nMixed Berry *\nVegan Peach\nLentil and Cauliflower \nChicken Pot Pie\n\n- My favorite would have to be the mixed berry. If you're looking for a sweet pie, go with this one! The cream that comes on the side really adds to the flavor, texture, and pie experience. I'd get this again and again.\n\n- The banana cream had a great fresh and real banana taste. Not the overly-sweet artificial kind. \n\n- The peach pie had great texture. I'm no expert, but the crumble-like thing on top was delicious. The crust had a unique taste to it too; almost whole-wheat like. The pie had a good balance of sweet and not too sweet. The sugary crumble on top was the main source of sweetness for the rest of the mellow pie. It was a good pie but not really my type. \n\n- Lentil and cauliflower was really flavorful! Surprisingly really good and delicious. I'd definitely recommend this to any of my vegetarian friends or even just lentil loving friends! \n\n- Chicken pot pie is a classic. Can't really go wrong. Love the crust and the ingredients they chose. Mmmm I'd go for this one again too. \n\nSo reason why we got to try so many pies was because we ordered Beef and Cabbage but they accidentally put in the wrong pie. Soo they gave us two extra slices or any other pie, on them! I love it. I was in pie heaven! \n\nGreat customer service + cute/clean space + delicious and tasty pies = without a doubt 5 star rating.

We stopped here for breakfast one morning and I enjoyed its hipster vibe, Etsy-rustic decor, and tasty pies.\n\nThe space is fairly large, but there aren't a ton of tables inside, so you might want to have someone grab a table while someone else in your group goes up to order at the counter. They offer sweet and savory pies, quiches, muffins and scones, and tarts, as well as a little gift-shop area with things like Cuppow lids, local honey, and fresh-cut flowers.\n\nPrices seemed reasonable - most things were under $5 (pot pies are $7) and you could easily grab a couple of items and a coffee for around $10. The steak pie was a hearty portion for one, with lots of flaky crust and maybe just a bit too much juice inside. \n\nThe cash-only part is kind of inconvenient, but as long as you're aware of it, you can plan to have cash on hand.

They have a diverse selection of pie, from their regulars to their seasonal specials. I went with a slice of the banana cream pie that seems to be a specialty, as well as a peach blackberry slice that is a summer special.\n\nThe banana cream was smooth and light, with slices of banana underneath the banana cream. The whipped cream on top was not at all overwhelming, and the actual banana cream was rich without being sticky sweet. The crust was light and flaky, which contrasted well with the creamy softness of the pie. \n\nThe peach blackberry was my favorite because of the crumb topping on top! The pie was primarily pie with a few blackberries folded in, but the peaches were extremely juicy and soft. I liked the crust on this pie better because it had a touch more butter, giving it the gooier texture that I love. Once again, I appreciated how the pie wasn't overly sweet, allowing me to really enjoy the flavors of the fresh fruit.\n\nI love pie and it can be so hard to find sometimes, so I'm so glad I ventured out to the Mission to get my pie fix!", "author": "Ashley T."}

Came back after having a late burrito lunch and a quick stop at a gallery nearby. There was a long line in front of us (a group of coworkers just came in for coffee) but it went by swiftly and gave my friend and I time to deliberate on our pie choices. They have a nice display case with all their offerings available neatly labeled from salads, pot pies, cookies, and of course, pie. The day we went they had a vegan apple strawberry, shaker lemon, walnut, apple strawberry, and strawberry rhubarb from what I remember. I went for the strawberry rhubarb, and my friend had the shaker lemon. We both added a scoop of organic vanilla ice cream for $1.50 to the pie slice which I think was $4.50. The strawberry rhubarb was very light, not too sweet, and the crust complimented it very well. The ice cream also reminded me a of a soy-based ice cream, that made this afternoon snack not too heavy. We also had a mocha and latte (single shots) and our total was just about $20.\n\nThere was plenty of seating with lots of windows (some open).

That's all very admirable, but how's the pie, you ask. \n\nIt's good. At least the slice of Banana Cream Pie I had was good (see photo). Very creamy but not too sweet with a nice flaky crust. No swirls of Reddi-Wip on top, just good eatin'. The fruit pies look delish - the apple rhubarb was on display on the counter - and will be worth a repeat visit in itself. But they also make savory pies like quiches, galettes, and pot pies using the same principles of fresh, local ingredients. \n\nLamb, chard, dandelion greens, Niman ham, potato gratin.

I guess we were expecting something a bit more like lemon meringue, tart and sweet but what we got was pretty bitter with only a hint of sweetness (maybe).

I called to reserve a pie and pickup was relatively easy. I dropped in on a busy Saturday afternoon, forked over my $22 and I was on my way. I was pretty excited to go home and slice into this pie that I had heard so many good things about! So that's exactly what I did...\n\nThe Filling: Good banana and vanilla flavor with a decent amount of bananas layered over under a nice fluffy top of whipped cream. The cream's consistency was a little more gelatinous and less cream than I had expected. Not a bad thing, just a different consistency than I had expected. Filing: 4 stars. \n\nThe Crust: Definitely not what I would have expected for a \"luxury\" pie ($22). The crust was hard, almost a burnt flavor. There was very little layering and it was quite hard to cut into. For what's claimed as a butter crust, it definitely didn't feel as rich or flaky as I had hoped. Maybe it works out better on the savory pies or the others that aren't refrigerated. Here however, it just didn't work for me. Crust: 2 stars.\n\nI really really wanted to like this pie and this place, but for me, a good crust is a necessary component to a good pie. Unfortunately this wasn't it and I'll have to search elsewhere to satisfy my banana cream pie cravings.", "author": "Justin S."}

It was light and tasted so fresh. The crust is to die for and the pie is topped with a delicious crumb topping. I could eat the crumb topping alone and be happy.  \n\nOur all time favorite pie is the Mixed Berries, which is only in season during the summer. We also like the apple huckleberry pie. Honestly, we have tried a couple of pie slices that we weren't a huge fan of but the ones that we really love are definitely worth the 5 star review. We tried the Pear Frangipane which was not our favorite. The pear flavor was too light and it didn't quite hit the spot. \n\nAnytime we come to the city, we bring back a pie. $22 a pie is steep but for us, it's all worth it!

The banana cream pie, like others have stated, is delicious - light, not overly sweet, with an excellent custard filling and tasty crust. The peach blackberry, albeit still tasty, was far less stellar. The pot pie, when it finally came out, was a disappointment - lukewarm and quite bland (and it takes a lot for me to consider something bland), I'm glad I'm already full from the much tastier banana cream pie by this point.\n\nSo while I'm sure I'll be back, I may just stick to their sweet pies in the future (a shame, considering their savory pies and quiches SOUND delicious).

For me, a good chicken pot pie starts with a nice blend of chicken, veggies, maybe some potatoes in a rich and cream \"gravy\" or sauce.  This filling is completely encased with good, flaky pie crust -- bottom, sides and top.\n\nThe Mission Pie version was basically chicken soup in a foil bowl with a slab of crust on top.  The filling was nothing like the saucy version I expected; it was just \"watery\" chicken soup, no sign of any thickening agent at all. (not bad soup, although i did add some things to spice it up a bit...but still just a chicken and vegetable soup).  The crust on top was nice and crispy...but no crust on bottom or sides.\n\nSo, if you like a chicken pot pie that is basically a chicken soup with a piece of flaky pie crust, you'll like this.  If your vision of chicken pot pie is more in line with mine, though, i think you'll be disappointed.\n\nI may be back to try the sweet pies, but I don't think the pot pies will be on the list.", "author": "John R."}

The place is really cute and the service is great. Mixed berry pie = LIFE. I bought a whole one once. Just for me and my boyfriend to split...yep. The first time we came here was for dinner and honestly, I didn't thought I would like it too much. I'm vegetarian and when I think savory dinner pie I think chicken pot pie. NOPE. The vegan eggplant bok choy pie they had when I was there was AMAZING. I can't wait for that seasonal pie to come back :) And their little seasonal rice salad with the tomatoes and zucchini...ugh I'm making myself so hungry. Mission Pie, I will be back so so soon.", "author": "Kirstie B."}

I mean, I LOVE pie. a) who doesn't love pie, b) I'm from the Midwest (ever listen to Garrison Keillor talk about tales from Lake Wobegon? yeah, it's like that).\n\nBut this pie falls a little short. Sure the banana custard filling is tasty, and there isn't too much whipped cream on top making it overly sweet, but the crust just doesn't jive. It was like a savory tough puff pastry. A traditional graham cracker would have been soooooo much better. My buddy's fruit pie was super fruity, and again, not too sweet, so I have to give props for that (it's why this review has three stars instead of two), but there was way too much acid, and it was hard to finish. Just became overpowering after a while.\n\nNow this makes me want to open up my own pie shop to show how it should be done.  Plus, they're cash only. Sure, I can rationalize cash-only for places with small orders, but if someone orders multiple pies, who's gonna have that much cash on them? Get with the program people.", "author": "Amanda S."}

Easy enough to remember. However, Mission Pie's awesomeness is not just limited to their artisinal pies. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YV9PYdUD0O4sLDz1DUk0Gw?select=hvR1syU2SQqevPt_KmN0kQ\n\nToday, I treated myself to a sumptous and tasty lunch of\na.  PASTA WITH ARUGULA PESTO\n b. STRAWBERRY GALLETTE\n c. ICED TEA\n\nThis trio of savory and sweet, hot and cold food delivered a simple yet one of the deliciously satisfying lunches I have had in a while.\n\nPASTA W/ ARUGULA PESTO: One bite of this cold salad woke up my palate. The simple combination of arugula, garlic , pamersan cheese and white beans produced  very refreshing and bold flavors. I  enjoyed and finished the whole bowl. $5  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YV9PYdUD0O4sLDz1DUk0Gw?select=slET-hAceGiFaBxiUoZwVw\n\nSTRAWBERRY GALLETTE: This hot round pie was oozing with the flavors of strawberries. The crust was flakey and contrasted nicely the gooey berries. So simple but so good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YV9PYdUD0O4sLDz1DUk0Gw?select=Cz7h4utoi3jAWemjss5UGw\n\nICED TEA: I considered this nice fruity drink in an ice-cold sweaty glass  on a hot Spring like today where I walked probably 10 blocks one of  life's simple pleasures! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YV9PYdUD0O4sLDz1DUk0Gw?select=rWbEyE_kIYjTkOYKe38cSg\n\nDuring my previous visits, I also had : \n\nPERSIMMON GALLETTE WITH BLUE CHEESE AND WALNUT:. The sweetness of the persimmon satisfied my sweet tooth and the blue cheese was its perfect creamy-savory accompaniment.  The filling was very tasty but the crust was overly crispy because the server left my pie too long in the oven when he reheated it.  ($5.50)\n\nCOFFEE: I paired it up with one of their coffees from Latin America. What a lovely meal!\n\nDECOR:\nPies are made in the open kitchen and baked in big industrial oven that is  visible in the dining room. The pie flavors are handwritten on the chalkboard wall. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YV9PYdUD0O4sLDz1DUk0Gw?select=f1PwJZRASODkqnBYTOqh5w\n\nMission Pie is spacious, rustic and charming. The  almost floor to ceiling wraparound windows make the place bright. You will get a nice view of the bustling Mission Street. A long communal table is also available but plenty of tables for solo or group.\n\nAMBIANCE: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YV9PYdUD0O4sLDz1DUk0Gw?select=mvRVzi8AJBQQMl12IzB4SQ\nAside from the irritating group who was having their staff meeting at Mission Pie (I do not need to hear how you are trying to get your Federal funding! I am running away from work myself!), the place provides a nice reprieve from the 9-5 over a cup of coffee and delicious pie.\n \nPRICE: \nSweet pies are pricey at $20 or more and savory pies are $26. Slices are more affordable at $5.50 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YV9PYdUD0O4sLDz1DUk0Gw?select=XL8fcbDPSvDW-bcnd80mBg\n\nFLAVORS:\nThey change weekly. Check their website for the pies available as well as community work they do such as Youth Advocacy.\n \nSome of their savory pies are:\n *Persian galette \n*Corned beef and cabbage galette \n*Cauliflower and olive quiche \n* Potato gratin tart with braised fennel \n* Beef chili tamale pie \n* Chicken pot pie \n* West African Peanut Stew pot pie Vegan \n\nA sign at the restaurant says: \"Mission Pie is a corner caf\u00e9, bakery, and neighborhood gathering place.\"\n\nFor me, Mission Pie is  my \"Pie in the Sky\" in the Mission. \n\nTAB: Iced Tea, Pesto Bowl and Gallette $14\n \nCASH ONLY.", "author": "Leah E."}

A rustic spot with rustic food including a few scones and muffins it should go without saying that although I'm sure those items were good the real reason to visit is the pie and with over a dozen options on the shelf that day I chose one slice for myself and deferred to the cute young lady behind the counter for the other, a slice of Plum Frangipane and Walnut, respectively.  Topping both off with house made whipped cream the early morning scene was hipster-free and much like everything else in the area the quality of the locally sourced items truly shined in both desserts - magnificent plums with a tinge of almond overlying butter, flaky crust in one hand and caramelized walnuts, toasty and slightly bitter in the other - it was only the fact that I had more dining plans shortly thereafter that prevented me trying the apple or peach.", "author": "Michael U."}

I had to restrain myself from inhaling it while I waited for my double cappuccino. \n- Cherry custard: interesting flavor but the pie itself was a bit dry. I'd opt for a different flavor next time. Maybe the walnut - that looked yummy.\n\nI also had my eye on their rack of fruit preserves and jams - butter lemon, apricot raspberry...I meant to ask, but I'm guessing they make these in-house. I also love their eco-friendly approach - silverware rather than disposable spoon and forks, natural rather than processed sugar, and little signs reminding you to save a tree by taking only as many napkins as you need.\n\nAs I sat in Mission Pie and watched customers flow in and out, I realized just how much the area has changed over the years. When I was growing up, 25th & Mission was not a place you'd want to find yourself in at night. But now there were young couples and groups of friends, all bundled up in their hats and scarves, sitting at a corner table reading a book or on their laptops. It has changed indeed.", "author": "Mariela D."}

It's pretty easy to find, but there isn't a whole lot of seating available.  I saw a bunch of people come in and order their pies to go.\n\nThey have a good variety of savory and sweet pies.  We tried the Mixed Berry Mini Pie, Walnut Pie, and the Pear Frangipane.\n\nLong story short, they were all quite good.  I'm not a big guy on sweets, but these pies seemed to hit the nice balance of sweet without drowning out the fruit flavors.  The crusts on all of them were nice and flaky as well.\n\nAnother cool note is that they get all their ingredients locally.  They have a nifty map up on the wall showing where in CA they get all the different components for their pies.\n\nPie Descriptions:\nThe mini pie consisted of apple, blueberry, and something else reddish.  It's costs more than a slice, but it's a mini pie!  You can have a whole pie without the guilt of...well eating a whole pie.\n\nWalnut pie was like a pecan pie, just with walnuts!  It's a sweeter flavor pie than I'd normally go for, but my buddy seemed to enjoy it plenty.\n\nThe pear frangipane wasn't actually a pie.  It was more like a fruit tart, but again like all the other pies was well balanced and the fruit came through.\n\nThe only thing that could have made the pies better is if they came heated up.  Maybe that's why everyone was taking their slices to go!  Definitely try it out, or better yet, take it home and heat it up for noms.", "author": "David K."}

I met my friends up in the Mission today and we were going to do the standard burrito and then one of my friends suggested this place. The store is a couple of blocks south of the 24th street BART station (which makes it very convenient for me!) in a little bit of a sketchy area that's gradually getting hipster-ized with various restaurants and bars. That being said, there's still a real rogues' gallery of neer-do-wells and rapscallions loitering out in the streets.\n\nMission Pie has an old skool feel to it with a nice big airy space, plenty of tables to sit at and a large counter that looks back into the kitchen. I say old skool because it has that classic San Francisco architecture look with the old wooden floors and big windows to watch the world go by. It is VERY clean and tidy though!\n\nI ordered a meat pot pie for my meal and then  noticed what looked like pecan pies on a rack behind her. The nice cash register girl informed me that they were actually walnut pies, so I got a slice of one of those too. My pot pie was put in the oven for about 10 minutes and then brought out to the table piping hot with a crispy, flaky crust. The crust was delicious with a nice mellow flavor that complimented the savory meat, veggies, and fresh herbs inside. It's a singles serving pie which is somewhere in size between a Peasant Pie and a Marie Calendar pie. I didn't feel overstuffed by the time I was done eating it which was great since I still had the walnut pie to go. The walnut pie was a lot like pecan pie with the sweet filling being offset by the crunch and slight bitterness of the walnuts. It was easily as good as any pecan pie I've had!\n\nI totally love this place and I'll be coming back again soon!", "author": "Jason W."}

Of course their ingredients are locally sourced and seasonally focused and of course the product is delicious (some of the best I've ever had ever) but I have to say that the most refreshing part of Mission Pie is that in spite of being an institution, they are incredibly gracious, generous and community-minded. We felt that they were a part of our wedding and genuinely cared about making our experience special. And they did. Everyone devoured our pies at the event and we enjoyed the leftovers the next day.

Perfectly matched that criteria with good pie and good space. \n\nAfter weeks of eating in and saving the monies, husband and I splurged with a whole slice of pie each! A seasonal peach-blackberry for me, and banana cream for him. The peach-blackberry definitely highlighted the natural ripeness of each fruit and I so enjoyed the crumble and (not-soggy) crust, that I ended up picking out the fruit and crumble and crust when I got too full to eat it in normal bites like a normal human being. The cream on our slice of banana cream was light and fluffy without overwhelming the banana. Husband declared it a true representation of classic banana cream pie (his other fave BCP is Wexler's Bourbon BCP with salted caramel). \n\nWe had to run across the street to get cash from the Chase ATMs, which was a bit of a bummer, but we enjoyed our pie and decaf coffee.

Apples were not over cooked, so texture and tartness remained.\n\nIf you are a fan of sweet pies, you need to try this place.  I think I've just found the 'Pie in the Sky' in the Mission.

I've only been here in the evenings, when the place is softly lit, with cozy furniture and a nice homey charm.  It's just really simple and nice.  \n\nAnd then I'll give one more star for the pies themselves, which are good, but didn't blow me away.  I've tried several varieties, and was happy with the fresh eats, but to be honest, the pies aren't the main draw for me.  (That's why I'm leaning towards 4 stars instead of 5.)\n\nHowever, I still really like this place.  Some of my favorite kinds of adventures are the quiet, creative ones you go on with your friends, when you're just sitting together, eating food in a comfortable place like Mission Pie.  The place just feels comfy, the staff is really nice and friendly, and I can't quite explain why it feels so good, but it just does.  \n\nThanks, Mission Pie.", "author": "Vivian C."}

The Mission streets around it are nasty, but once inside you are treated to unicorn pies (sustainable, sourced, free range, etc, etc.) I get the quiche and a slice of pie-so I restrain from going very often if possible.

Other than the obvious, one is a tart - a  more firm and crumbly crust. Mission Pie's crust is a more crispy and flaky crust. \n\nTo keep Tartine's crust from getting soggy, the crust is coated with dark chocolate and caramel before the creamy pastry filling and sliced bananas are placed. Mission Pie's a fresh, crisp crust, a lightly sweetened cream and sliced bananas. Nothing mushy, nothing soggy - it's freshly baked on site. You can feel, taste and sense the freshness of it in every bite! No banana pudding and no banana artificial flavoring here...\n\nI've been on a hunt for some good Banana Cream Pie.

It was reminiscent of banana pudding with cool whip on top, not good at all.  I left about half the pie on the plate.\n\n Better pies are easily sourced at any road side diner found all over the South.  \n\nIf you are in the mission during the day, just go to Dianda's Italian bakery and get some amazing desserts.

The place was packed and there was a line. It took us 15 minutes in order to place an order. But it was OK because I could take my time to decide what I want since all the pies looked pretty good. \n\nI ordered: \n\nBerry Pie - It was so good. very fresh ingredients. The pie had a lot of fruit and seasoning but it was not overly sweet at all. Perfect crunchy crust. YUMMY! \n\nApricot Pie - It was very good too. The crust was a little bit hard but it was still delicious. \n\nThe pie was $3.50 for a slice. A very good place for dessert. \n\nBTW, they also have savory pies!!!!", "author": "Liza T."}

Came through on a Saturday night looking and feeling like a super tourist as we stood in line debating on what to order for a good 5 minutes or so.\n\nBanana Cream Pie:  Not to sweet but had that home made flavor. You can tell their whip cream is home made and the crust was buttery and flaky without being overly rich. It could have used more banana flavor; either from the fruit itself or the filling but it was still a decent piece of pie.\n\nStrawberry Rhubarb: It was everything it should be-sweet, sour, and appetizing. Though it wasn't the most presentable pie as it came to us in an exploded state, it sure was enjoyable. The sweet cream balanced the sour fruit medley and the crust added the necessary touch to create perfect balance.", "author": "Allison M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-29", "description": "Had dinner with the fam-bam while out on vacation in The Bay last week, and my nephew and I decided to swing by Mission Pie for dessert after dropping off my parents at SFO. I've had my share of pies in my lifetime, and I'm not too discriminatory when it comes to them at all. Honestly, I will enjoy everything from home made pies to the cheap $1.99-Hostess apple pies you find near the check-out line of your local grocery store. \n\nI'm def not a pie snob.\n\nBut as my nephew and I were told (and we had also read online), Mission Pie's banana cream pie was (is) one of the most amazing ever. I must say, though, that after giving it a try for myself, I was totally left just \"whelmed.\" I wasn't as over-whelmed as most, but definitely wasn't under-whelmed at all. I was merely \"whelmed.\"\n\nWhat I did enjoy about MP's BCP: the flaky crust. Unlike other pies that have either a \"too thick\" or \"too dry\" crust, MP's crust was a perfect concoction of flaky & moist. I also loved the fact that the banana cream wasn't overly sweet at all. The freshness of the bananas added that extra push I needed to appreciate its overall goodness. \n\nThing is, I wasn't exactly moved to tears by it, nor did it blow my mind. But to MP's credit, I think it's because I had set my expectations too high... Sort of similar to how 90% of people tend to judge a cupcakery by it's \"red velvet.\" But why? Of all the cupcake flavors, red velvet is as varied as they come. You can't judge a cupcakery by its red velvet; you're better off judging it by something more conventional like a vanilla or chocolate cupcake, or a black & white. As simple as that sounds, its the basic cupcake that a cupcakery should be able to do best. Perhaps in the pie world, the BCP could be that conventional pie for which a pie place should be judged. But to me, I think the BCP is also somewhat tricky in the same way that the red velvet cupcake can be. What I need to try the next time I'm in The Bay, and visiting MP, is a traditional apple or cherry pie.\n\nDespite this analysis, Mission Pie is loveable in many ways. I love the neighborhood feel of the place, and the coffee it serves adds a nice touch. I also appreciate the menu's diversity: sweet and savory options for all palates. \n\nIf you happen to be in the Mission area, you definitely should give this place a try. Hopefully, unlike me, you won't happen to notice a woman with uber hairy legs enjoying herself some Mission Pie during your visit. While I'm glad she was enjoying it as much as everyone else, it took everything I had within me not to go out and buy the poor girl a razor! (EEK!)", "author": "Wendel L."}

When I think of dessert in the Mission, I think Mission Pie! True to their name, Mission Pie serves American classics as well as creative originals with ingredients sourced  from throughout California (they have a map marked with where each ingredient is from if you're into that sort of thing). It's a homely space, with various sized tables to fit different parties. Service is good and it's conveniently located near the 24th/Mission Bart Station.\n\n Of the 3 pies I have tried, Peach Berry is my favorite. The tartness of the berries plays well with the sweet peaches and the hearty crust. I love the texture that the crust has with the oats or whatever grain they use adding a nice crunch. I always have them add a dollop of their house whipping cream! Not too far behind is their Banana Cream and Plum Frangipane. The Banana cream is not as sweet as some other versions, but is more refreshing and natural. I have no idea what Frangipane is, and I still don't, but the plum frangipane is also a solid choice. \n\nMission Pie has a thorough menu with sweet and savory pies, quiches, and other baked goods. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place, so skip the ice-cream and get some PIE!", "author": "Josh Y."}

Instead, the guy will be known in perpetuity as the \"Pie Fucker.\"  Sometimes, it is best not to have a lasting contribution on society.  \n\nHow unlucky was Mr. Biggs?  Well, pretty much everyone on Yelp has already showered Mission Pie with laurel upon laurel for their sweet offerings.  I am here to say that the savory options hold up as well.  Eschewing Yelp reviews, my eyes sauntered over to the pork & olive savory pie.  You mean I get to combine tender chunks of delicious pork with the unique flavor of olive all within the context of a decadently heavy pot pie filling covered with a genuinely flaky crust?  Hell yes!  This pie was incredibly delicious.  The decidedly buttery crust meshed perfectly with moist pork, green olives, carrots, and potatoes.  There is no question in my mind that this is the proper update to your mom's chicken pot pie.  \n\nIf you somehow don't manage to finish your pie, don't be an asshole and engage in fornication with your leftovers.  Not only would you fail miserably given that the pie will have lost its warmth, but also you would be an incredible tool for attempting to do so given that leftover pie from Mission is actually quite tasty.  Indeed, two days later, I polished off the pork/olive pot pie and it was still marvelous.  \n\nIn any event, so long as you enjoy warm pie for the right reasons, you will probably enjoy this place.  It is definitely worth a visit if you happen to be in the Mission.", "author": "Yelper N."}

Absolutely. \n\nThree of us shared four slices... two apple, one pear raspberry, and one walnut tart slice. I could have gone for the banana cream as well, but apparently that's \"not breakfast food\". Just goes to show what my companions know about breakfast. Pah.\n\nMy personal favorite was probably the walnut, because it was one of Mission's more unique choices (and so much better than pecan). The nutty to sweet flavor ratio was spot on, and the crust was fantastic. Pear raspberry was also pleasantly awesome, considering I've never had a good pear tart or pie. The crumb topping makes this one, and there's a tangy, lemony flavor that really compliments the sweetness of the pear (which by the way, is not mushy at all. Bravo!). The apple was good... but it's not my grandma's, and I'm a little bit partial to homemade apple pie, even though this one left nothing to be desired.\n\nOn the the down side, the brewed coffee was too bitter for any of our tastes. I literally could not force myself to drink it, even though it's local and supposedly had notes of all kinds of tasty things in it (dark chocolate? fruit?). I recommend not ordering it and instead, having another slice of pie to compliment your first slice of pie.

Oh yeah, and cash only.\n\nAlthough Mission Pie is located in a semi-shady area on Mission, the place is well worth the visit. THE BANANA CREAM PIE IS BOMB. 5 stars baby. Very creamy, lots of bananas, not overly sweet but sweet enough, yummy crust... this is the BEST BANANA CREAM PIE I have ever had. I believe it's $3.50/slice, and $20/pie.... great to bring to any occasion! \n\nAll the other pies are also made of fruit but less decadent than the banana cream pie since they are traditional fruit pies (not cream). I tried a piece of the peach pie one time, but I wasn't a big fan since I usually don't like \"baked fruit\" pies (ex. like apple pies). But if you're a fan of these type of pies, I'm sure the variety at Mission Pies would be very tasty (there's usually like 4-6 diff pies)! I'm more of a fatty, Marie Callenders pie type of gal :) and this place definitely has a slightly more \"healthy\" choice of pies/desserts if you know what I mean.\n\nI've come here a total of 4-5x, so I'm definitely a fan! Just don't come here if you're expecting to go to a super decadent pie shop since they only have simple fruit pies here and other savory items like quiches.

Mission Pie came highly recommended, and I seemed like a specialty place.  \n\nInitial impression is that everything looks amateur; the pies especially.  Many are lop sided and break apart when sliced.  But, after looking around, I get that sense of the entire environment.  \n\nTaste of the pie was not especially good.  Maybe, mid-diner level.  Also tried the coffee (drip only).  Again, alright, but not very good.\n\nOn a third occasion, I visited with the idea of trying another slice.

Chicken Pot pie- Husband liked it, ate every bite of it. He said it was good, but didn't give a quick response about the goodness of it...so it was just ok. I had one bite of it and I think I like the KFC one more- yes I had one last week when I was sick! yum! \n\n2. Slice of Quiche of the day- I think it had Spinach and mushrooms This was so good! It was eggy and soft and souffle textured! superb! I wondered why it was so much better than other quiches and I think it is because they use way less cheese than other places so it makes light and airy...not heavy like many of my homemade quiches have turned out. \n\n3.  Wheat berry salad- superb! talk about cancer fighting salad! OMG, this is one to replicate- I am buying the ingredients tomorrow: wheat berries, radicchio, cauliflower, green onion, parsley, olive oil and probably salt, oh and I think i tasted lemon. That was incredible. Husband loved it too! \n\nSweet\n1. Apple cranberry pie (Vegan)- husband loved it. This was he was sure of! He said that he would order this again and it had a good balance of apples to cranberries. I tasted it and enjoyed it as well. \n\n2. Shaker lemon pie- Wow, this was quite interesting -was almost like a love-hate relationship for me. I didn't love it when I first tasted it, but the second bit was amazing. So, the peel makes me kind of hate it, but the lemon curd like filling makes me love it! It was like bitter/sweet/bitter/sweet/bitter/sweet...all gone! I am thinking that whipped cream might have created more of a balanced taste, but I didn't get it because we took it to go. Anyway, I think this is the most interesting pie I've ever had. I will try it again and again maybe...\n\nAll in all, solid place!", "author": "Yva D."}

But, it is really true.\n\nI was super-excited to check out Mission Pie, because I heard that it was owned and operated by the same person who does Destination Baking in Glen Park, which I totally love.\n\nSo - I went to check out Mission Pie just days before Christmas of 2010.  I stood in line (which moved smoothly) - and eventually got up to the front and was greeted by the young lady behind the counter.\n\nShe seemed frazzled (which was not why I am giving Mission Pie ONE star for the rating) -- I would have been frazzled too - with that many customers just before Christmas.  \n\nI was asking her about the pies I could purchase as whole pies to take home.  She really was not-so-helpful -- really not able to recommend one pie over another... not particularly enthusiastic about any pie, exactly.  \n\nI chose the cranberry-apple pie and the sweet-potato pie.  \n\nI also chose two chicken pot-pies to go.  I wanted to serve the pot pies for dinner, and serve the other pies for Christmas dinner and Christmas Eve.\n\nI followed the instructions on the pot pies before serving.\n\nWhoa.  \n\nThese have got to be the worst pot pies I have ever tasted.  My sweetie took the first bite, and pulled something out of his mouth -- which elicited a grimace.  \n\n\"what is this?\"\n\nsome mystery chicken connective tissue?  cartilage?\n\nnot sure.  \n\nnot good.\n\nI tasted mine - the chicken was tendon-y.  \n\nAfter only one bite each, we tossed the pot-pies out into the compost.  I didn't even feel comfortable giving these pies to my kittens.\n\nI felt horrible about throwing away the food -- something I NEVER do, because it is so wasteful.  \n\nBut these pies were really awful.\n\nI was optimistic about the sweet potato pie, because it is my FAVORITE at Destination Baking Company.\n\nwrong.\n\nJust terrible.  \n\nI did actually finish a small piece -- but then brought the pie to the hospital where I work - knowing that scavengers would take care of it.\n\nThey did.\n\nThe cranberry apple pie actually deserves at least a two-star rating.  It was not terrible.\n\nnot great.  But not terrible.\n\nTwo personal-size chicken pot pies, 1 sweet potato pie, and 1 cranberry apple pie = $52.00.  \n\nThey didn't take credit cards.  So, I paid by check.  \n\nI won't be going back.\n\nAnyone else know of a good bakery in the Mission?", "author": "Amy P."}

Finally, I can give up Nations and get decent pie.\n\nSo I ventured here with friends the other day and was pretty impressed. The corner location was full of life, even at 8:30, and not to mention, the pie was pretty good. I got the Shaker Lemon, which I liked, except for the pieces of lemon peel in it, which made it a bit bitter. Was not expecting that at all. Banana creme was pretty good, no complaints there. The apple definitely took the cake (I mean, pie), it had pretty big chunks of apple pieces that made the entire thing super delicious.\n\nI would say next time, I would try to be there a bit earlier.

Luckily I was with a large group and got to try many different pies, so the mediocrity wasn't just a single pie, but spread equally throughout.  I watched in confusion as most of my group devoured their pieces like it was Ambrosia, but I nibbled politely at mine, offering as many people as many bites as they wanted.  It just wasn't that good.\n\nThe apple pie was apple sauce in crust.\n\nThe pumpkin pie was bland and could use a few (hundred) shakes of cinnamon.\n\nThe walnut pie was my favorite, but still has nothing on a pecan pie that anyone could make themselves.

I had banana cream and he had a pear tart or something super fancy looking. They both looked great, but my banana cream was more like instant banana pudding with thick, flavored gelly instead of bananas and cream.\n\nI don't honestly know how my friend's was though he said it was good, but I heard so many great things about this place and was disappointed by the flavor and consistency in that pie filling. I've had way better. The crust was good, though and crusts are hard to get done right.\n\nAlso, their pie selection was minimal; banana cream, something with chocolate, or the pear tart was all they had. Maybe it was because it was Pi Day, but even then they should have been stocked up knowing it was coming. And their portions were small slices when I've had large big ol' slices of pie at places like Denny's that tasted better! And this is coming from someone who used to be a pastry chef and overnight baker...including of course many things, but of all things OF PIES. So I know a good pie when I taste one, and this was not it sadly.\n\nBottom line: $3.14 special on Pi Day was not worth it, so I can't image what the regular price is they charge.

It just didn't live up to my expectations, which were pretty high after reading the Yelp reviews and another review on an online San Francisco magazine. The atmosphere of the shop and community partnerships are down-to-earth, positive, and family-friendly, and parking is so-so, but the pies themselves didn't live up to their hype. \n\nSho and I ordered a Malaysian tofu curry pot pie, the organic chicken pot pie, the banana cream pie, and the apricot frangipane pie. The variety of ingredients in the savory pie was promising, but the savory sauce in both of the savory pot pies seemed to lack a spark. They seemed a bit bland-- perhaps because the pies were lukewarm and the crust really hard? We had our Malaysian tofu curry pot pie reheated in the oven, where it was forgotten and burnt, but the lady working at the counter apologized and gave us a salad in addition to a new Malaysian tofu curry pot pie. -- so, the service was friendly and fair.\n\nThe apricot frangipane was well-constructed, but the crust was really hard and I suppose apricot frangipane's strong tanginess isn't as much to my liking. The pie that probably saved Mission Pie for us was the banana cream pie, which was light yet satisfying. The crust was flaky and the \"custardy\" contents delicious. Banana flavor was very natural and lifted the pie's overall appeal. \n\nMission Pie has a good story and promise. I look forward to seeing improvement!", "author": "Gigi L."}

If you love pie, get yourself down to Mission Pie. They have a daily selection of both sweet and savory pies that will satisfy. \n\nI came here for someone's birthday. The place is charming. Lots of art on the walls, a nice long communal table on one side of the shop. Large windows to watch the traffic in the Mission roll by. Pretty friendly service. I learned that they have a mentoring/internship program for at-risk youth, so these kids have an opportunity to come in and learn the business and help out. That's pretty cool. \n\nSo I didn't get to try the savory pies, but the chicken pot pie looked very good. Nice flaky crust covering a steamy, creamy stew of veggies and chicken. Not huge, but good for a meal. I tried the apple pie a la mode. It wasn't bad. The crust was good, but a little dry. I think it's sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. The filling was juicy, but not runny, with decent flavor. I'm not the biggest proponent of apple pie, so for me it was pretty good. I ordered a slice of the banana cream pie to go. Now banana cream pie is where my heart lies. The version at Mission Pie was just ok. It only had a layer of bananas at the bottom, but I think banana cream pie should be stuffed to the brim with banana slices with the vanilla cream/pudding as a filler to keep structural integrity when the pie is sliced. The pudding itself in the banana cream pie had good vanilla bean flavoring, but the crust was a little too tough. Sadness. \n\nNice place to get some pie.

Nor was there much appreciable texture to the fruit; the only real texture in the whole thing was the crumb topping, which was tasty and crunchy, but just ladled sweetness on top of the overly sweet fruit. I had a taste of the banana cream, and the crust seemed a little bland.

Children used to wait for school buses there, people used to pause on their way home from work and have conversations there. But Pie thought it would be better to tear up that space and plant trees instead. Extra noise and air pollution? Sure -- no one's using this anyway, they said. The result? A sidewalk so narrow that only one stroller may pass at a time ... and 40 feet by 10 of garbage-strewn dirt. Week after week, the duties of their disempowered-youth workforce do not include cleaning up the jetsam. Week after week, energy is spent on self-righteous murals and promotional materials and not on addressing this growing problem. What kind of a \"community-oriented\" business is this?\n\nI understand that my brand of liberalism -- in which cities are wonderful gathering places for people of all classes to share ideas and common spaces -- contradicts theirs -- in which cities are cesspools where the lowest of the low are forced to live until their souls are liberated and they may live on a farm. I know I should be talking about their locally sourced peaches and affordable decaf. But as a pedestrian in this neighborhood, I just notice Mission Pie literally and metaphorically marginalizing me.\n\nRant over. Customer service is spotty. Coffee is good.

That was not convincing so I asked her where she had her best banana cream pie. She told me that it was not her thing but many people buy it so I decided to buy two of them. \n\nThey were $20 each, I am not a miser but that is not cheap when you consider Marie Calendar has a pretty damn good banana cream pie for $7 but I bought them and took it to the office. \n\nUpon my arrival, the staff was in anticipation because of the wonderful things people have written about this pie. Well.........out of six people who ate it, not one person was impressed with the $20 pie and here are the reasons:\n\nPie crust was not flakey at all, pretty thin but dense and offered no buttery flavor. It is just something that holds it together and nothing special.\n\nThe inside cream was pudding which could be an overall good texture but was thick and help little favor\n\nBananas were plentiful in a way but not ripe to the point of a superb banana\n\nTop layer of cream cheese, once again, just an addition without too much substance.\n\nOverall as stated from eight people now, good pie for $10 but I would not go back for $20.

The staff was collecting dishes, pulling pies off the shelves and packing up to go home after what appeared to be a very busy day, judging from the fact that the place was still packed. Instead, this lovely pie fairy welcomed us warmly, told us they were closing, but we were welcome to order, as long as we didn't mind takeaway containers. We ended up getting 2 slices to share, banana cream & pear-raspberry, accompanied by free coffee and a warm, casual atmosphere.\n\nAll I can say is that upon tasting each pie, I instantly realized that if my friend hadn't had the foresight to divide up the slices before we dug in, there was the distinct possibility of a fight to the death breaking out between us over them.

Golden and flaky butter and just the right touch of salt, the crust smacked of butter and contain a fantastic wonderland of rich pudding, rounds of banana and a healthy dose of whipped cream. The fruit itself was ripened to the ideal sweetness, with enough brown and give to be just the right amount of mush. This creation should constitute its own food group, but there's decidedly not enough of the stuff nor is it pretty looking.\n\nIt's clear the emphasis and care is on what goes in: locally-sourced, seasonal and sustainable ingredients determine the half dozen or so flavors. There's also several savory quiches, a gratin and several varieties of tarts and muffins. My ass (and I literally mean my behind) is lucky I'm no longer dating the dude whose house is located such that I'm \"forced\" to pass by here on my way from the subway.\n\nWhat also sets Mission Pies apart is their commitment to the community, creating social advocacy programs to hire and train local youth.

It doesn't get much better than this.  \n\nI think comparing it to a Tartine Banana Cream Tart is unfair because after all, this is pie and Tartine's is a tart.  And that tart has a lot of other  things in it like caramel and chocolate which can get a little overly sweet.  They are both good, but Mission Pie does pies.  \n\nI'll be returning for some of the other flavors of pie!", "author": "Amy W."}

The slice was a decent size for the price I paid and it was yummy.  The only thing is there was an apple pit, like the whole middle part of the apple, stem and all in my pie.

The Malaysian Curry came in a little mini pie tin and it was very filling. Unfortunately, it lacked flavor. The pie was too watery inside, it needed a stronger curry flavor, and basically more spice.

Perhaps it was because we were really craving hot sandwiches, we were underwhelmed by the offerings from Mission Pie.  We each got a stew - one veggie and one pork - and while they tasted ok, it was a very small portion for the price.  We also each got a slice of apple pie and again, it was just ok and a very tiny portion.  Will have to come back and give the banana creme pie a try since it seems to be quite popular!

When your establishment has pie in the name, then I expect your pie to blow me out of the water. We tried the pear frangipane and shaker lemon pie. Something was off with the pie. This is going to sound horrible, but I think it's because half of their pie crust is made with whole wheat flour. It throws the consistency off and I felt like the crust wasn't as buttery and flaky as I'd like it to be. I guess that's the lesson learned-don't be healthy (I kid). The pear frangipane taste had an almond filling and I like the fresh pieces of pear on top. The pie almost didn't have enough almond flavor though and I also didn't like the grainy consistency. The shaker lemon pie had thinly sliced layers of lemon in it and so it had a great sour, citrus flavor (I really like my lemon desserts sour). But the lemon pieces kind of made the pie awkward to eat because it was hard to cut into without taking slices of lemon with each bite. I was disappointed in the pie. I think the pie at Marie Callender's is better.\n\nRead more reviews and see photos on my blog: http://rbjello.wordpress.com/2012/02/07/tuesday-mission-food-crawl/", "author": "Jackie T."}

Sweet, savory, vegan, you name it. You can buy by the slice or by the whole pie, and you can load up a pie plate with a selection of slices to take home, which was a big hit in my household last Thanksgiving.  Also: good coffee.\n\nYou can buy local honey and other Bay area edibles here, and you can eat with a clear conscience, regardless of calories consumed, knowing that all the ingredients in your splurge were locally sourced, and in many cases grown on the organic farm that Mission Pie is affiliated with.  Plus the restaurant and the farm both employ and train at-risk youth, and do a lot of other cool stuff that works for the greater good.\n\nHowever: Mission Pie's counter service is wildly inconsistent. One time it's all johnny-on-the-spot, and the next time you need to explain what iced coffee is, beg for a fork, and help count out your own change, so that by the time you get your order it's time to touch up your roots.\n\nBut hey, waiting is good for the soul - especially if pie is the reward.", "author": "Judi A."}

I meant its not bad but its not that great either and I really dont know why this place is always packed.\n\nWell, now I know. Thanks to Tb's sweet tooth, we came here. At first he said we's share a slice (sure, i say...*wink...lol) but then, I saw them serving a walnut pie with fresh whipped cream to another customer and my mouth watered. So I ask him if I can order another pie on top of his banana cream pie, of course he wouldnt say no, he said go for it.\n\nSo we ordered and the Cashier and the Servers were all great. Our order was sent to a different table, and the schmuck put his finger on the whipped cream and walked away. So when I told the Server that it probably was our order, I told him I dont want that one because the guy already put his finger on it, he apologized which is all good, no harm done, I just dont want that peice of the the pie. So the Cashier/Manager came over to our table apologized and brought us our order and gave us complimentary cards for a free pie and coffee for our next visit. Now isnt that awesome customer service. I declined because there's really not much to it for us, but he insisted. \n\nSo after enjoying our Banana Cream Pie and Walnut pie and a glass of whole d milk for me, we were happy and came out smiling.\n\nCustomer Service really does the trick.

Or so I thought.\n\nUpon walking in I liked the feel and decor of the place - very lounge-y and relaxed.  Not being able to make up my mind about their pie, I got a slice of the peach-raspberry and a slice of the mixed berry to go with a cup of coffee.  When I asked the cashier if they had ice cream to go with my pie, he said they didn't serve ice cream, only whipped cream.  A place that specializes in pie and no ice cream?!?  Really?  I asked him how many times a day someone asks for ice cream and he said, \"A lot.\"  That should have been clue #1...\n\nI served myself coffee from their table (they DO have good coffee), sat down and five minutes later two small slices of pie were brought to me.  Cold.  I suppose I should have realized that when I ordered, they didn't ask me if I wanted it warm or cold.  I was too impatient and hungry to wait, and while I prefer it warm, well - good pie is pretty good at room temperature, so I dug in.\n\nI will forgive many things in a restaurant if the food is good - bad service, mixed up orders, dirty bathroom among them - but I wasn't impressed.  The pie wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't anything memorable.  Between finding a giant piece of peach that single-handedly took up most of the peach content in one slice, and the overly sugared filling in the other, well...  it was just disappointing.  The fact that it was room temperature didn't help either.  I know pie.  All Mission Pie's offerings managed to do was make me miss my mother and her 8 sisters' baking.\n\nDuring the hour I spent at one of the window tables drinking my coffee and reading, I watched several people get up and refill their coffee mugs.  I had gotten mine in a paper cup because I wanted to take it with me to my appointment and was under the impression that one refill was free.  I figured one cup in Mission Pie, the refill for the road, so when I got up to leave I went over to refill it.  As I was walking towards the door, one of the staff came up behind me and informed me that refills cost $1.25 in a \"to go\" paper cup, and that the free refill was only given in one of their \"for here\" mugs.  He didn't charge me, but wanted me to know the policy \"for next time.\"  Instead of having a conversation about the lack of signage informing customers of this policy, or the fact that the coffee is self-service, I happily walked over to the cashier and forked over $1.25 for my refill before walking out.\n\nI really wanted to like this place, especially because it's in my neighborhood and the thought of being able to walk a few blocks from my house to get a warm slice of pie was extremely appealing.  But for me, there will not be a \"next time\" at this establishment.\n\n2 stars given solely for their social mission and their coffee.", "author": "Dirty D."}

The pie on the other hand -- not so great.  I ordered a slice of the mixed berry.  The pie was somewhat warm, no complaints there, but there was hardly any crust on that pie at all.  It just felt like I was eating some sort of berry soup.  Definitely nothing to write home about.  I felt like I would have been much more satisfied if I had just gone to Costco and bought a whole pie.  I will probably be back because I liked the feel of the place and want to try their other pies.  I would still recommend a visit to someone that hasn't tried it.", "author": "Jordan J."}

Flaky.. like flaky when you make great plans to go to the museum with someone and they FLAKE... still back to the pie.  So delicious that when you have your slice and cutting into it with your FORK.. yeah.. eat a pie with a FORK...just like that same friend with a FORK tongue... sticking it out telling you ...\"oh yeah.. lets go to the museum\" and instead of showing up..they FLAKE.   Oh well.. back to the pie.. and as i was eating the pie, people around me finishing up their camped out spoils at the many tables... its was quite the treat.. \nI loved the staff..so.. nice.. really..  so funny.. very!!!\n\nSo stick your fork into my flaky friend.. oh.. i am sorry..

I split the banana cream, walnut and peach pie with 5 other people.\n\nThe banana cream pie was good but didn't have as many bananas as I'd hope with each bite. The walnut was really  good that I could have eaten one all to myself. I like how it's wasn't as sweet as other nut pies. Lastly, the peach was average. I had high hopes since it's peach season but I  felt it lacked in sweetness.\n\nOverall:  I like how the pies look and taste like homemade pies.

We weren't really seeing anything and thus figured we might as well just grab a box of donuts from Walgreens. Enter: Mission Pie.\n\nWalking in from the windy, brisk evening weather we were greeted by a beautifully cozy and warm interior in this little mission pie shop.  I was actually a bit skeptical--I had not had a good piece of pie in literally years and thus had developed the opinion that pie was in general just not that great.  Boy was I wrong.\n\nMy sister and I decided to split a piece of their fresh peach raspberry pie. The guy manning the counter was very friendly, adding to the homey ambiance of the place.  The pie arrived with a generous dollop of cream on top, and just the appearance of the pie was beautiful--this was clearly homemade.  The flavors were exquisite, peach blending with raspberry in a sweet tangy mixture of oh-my-god-foodgasm-yumminess.  Even the crust, which I usually don't notice, was absolutely delicious.  \n\nThe pie was so good we decided we needed a second piece.  When I went back and expressed my desperate need for another slice of that peach-raspberry heaven, the guy behind the counter smiled and gave me the second slice on the house because apparently it was \"too small to sell.\" If by too small they mean bigger than my original piece, that's totally fine by me!\n\nI cannot wait to go back here and try more of their pie flavors. Also, they have a great selection of jams and honeys for sale, and they made the best chai latte I have had in years. I basically want to live in this place.

The crust is tasteless and burned -- oh, ok, burned is a taste, I suppose. No texture to speak of. A crust should be flaky and sweet and crunchy and a bit salty -- I KNOW pie, I KNOW pie crust. I make it a thousand times better than Mission Pie's. And the peaches? Well, those that are in there (it's not got many, so I'm not quite sure what that EIGHTEEN DOLLARS goes to) are NOT good. They're not sweet and they're not even peeled. OK, with most fruits I like when they're not peeled, keeps more nutrients in, yada yada. But peaches? You ALWAYS peel peaches because they're FUZZY.

Each of the slices of pie I've tried have been phenomenal.  The crust is buttery & flaky & tender, & everything tastes like it was pulled out of the oven no more than an hour beforehand.  My fave's the walnut pie, & I swear to you I hated walnuts until I tried this pie (it's particularly cool that they choose to make walnut pie instead of pecan pie because walnuts are local).  There's a bacon, tomato, & blue cheese galette there that's also amazing...I suppose you can't really go wrong with bacon, but it was delish either way.\n\nService each time was incredibly friendly, helpful, & patient (because seriously, it's difficult to decide with so many choices!).

However, the pies themselves here aren't really anything to write home about. I have been several times and, while the pie is perfectly enjoyable, the price per slice is reasonable, the service is friendly and the place is clean and inviting, I wouldn't wait in line for a slice. I've had their pear and raspberry pie and their Dutch apple, and, maybe it is because I am from 'pie country' (the Midwest) and have been spoiled by amazing pies, but I remain somewhat unimpressed.

Their shop was pretty small, and everyone working at the front of the store looked really young. Now, the shop has expanded and is bigger than ever! I'm so happy for them!!\n\nWe came here yesterday so my lovely could get coffee, but I knew we couldn't leave without at least one slice of pie, even if it was the late morning. We got a slice of the pear-blueberry pie to go. It was delicious - really flaky pie crust, not-too-sweet fruit filling, and a crunchy and buttery oat/granola-type crumb topping, which I really loved. The prices are not cheap - $3.50 for a slice of pie, but almost all the ingredients that Mission Pie uses are either local or sustainable, so you are really supporting local businesses by coming here. \n\nThe coffee is pretty strong here, and one of the ones that I tasted had nice fruity notes to it. The service is also very friendly. I'd love to come back here to try the other pies, especially this chicken pot pie that I saw this guy eating at the table across from us.

The banana cream pie didn't disappoint, and neither did the mixed berry pie I got for dessert.  Both pies had a great, flaky crust that was buttery without being overly full of fat and the fillings are really tasty- I especially enjoyed the large chunks of strawberry and raspberry in the mixed berry pie.  The crumble topping helped a bit as well.  The banana cream pie was also good- the pudding filling wasn't too sweet and it had a nice banana flavor.  Given the summer season, its good to take advantage of the bounty being offered by Mission Pie right now- I wouldn't mind going back for a slice of the other pies being offered.\n\nSo, why the 4 stars even though I clearly enjoyed my pies?  Unfortunately, the price is a little restrictive- $18 for a whole pie is a bit much to pay on a regular basis.

I have always been a big dessert person but I never developed a love for pie... until today. Usually when I think of pie, I think of that canned fruit taste. Cherry pie? gross. Peach? eh. But if I had to pick a favorite, it would be banana cream. Still I could never tell if it's fresh, even if it was. And the crust could be too hard or not thick enough to go with its content. There'd be too much fruit or too much whipped cream. The list of things that could go wrong with any pie is endless and exhausting. This is why I was never a pie person. I could never find the right one!\n\nI probably never would have gone into Mission Pie on my own but I was seduced in with a free slice coupon from the Green Zebra book.

I took one lick of the whipped cream and just knew this was going to be AMAZING. \n\nThere was none of that canned whipped cream taste or consistency (even though I love canned whipped cream haha). Their whipped cream was silky, sweet, had the PERFECT thickness and it just gave you a feeling like someone had whipped it by hand, just for you. This cream was perfectly balanced with the banana portion. I got flavors of cool vanilla, smooth banana pudding, and fresh banana slices carefully placed into the most amazing crust. OMG the crust... it was flaky yet had a buttery firmness but still lightly crisp because it was so fresh.

The pecan pie is really satisfying; the cinnamon pear pie tastes fresh from the tree. If you missed your farmers' market eggs, you can sometimes get eggs here too. You should also visit the Pie Ranch across from the ocean down on the 1 past Half Moon Bay where all the fillings come from. It's a magical place where they have volunteer work days (planting strawberries, hacking down raspberry bushes) and potluck barn dance hootenannies. The new, enlarged space isn't as cozy as the original, but it's probably better for them in many ways.\n\nAnd if that weren't enough of a reason, how could you not love a place where employees think up signs like this:\n\n\"One day a customer took *eleven* napkins for one piece of pie!

Get that wrong and it doesn't matter what the filling is like, you'll feel like you're eating cardboard. Conversely, a good crust will carry a mediocre filling with aplomb.\n\nAt Mission Pie you get a great crust - flaky but not greasy, crisp, spry and generally delightful. The fillings are good - not brilliant, but I have no complaints at all. The walnut pie is a little on the dry side, but the flavour is good. The apricot fricase is sublime. Their berry pies have just a tinge of tartness to really activate the salival glands, I've not eaten a pie there that I wasn't enthusiastic about.\n\nDefinitely worthy of a mention are their scones (both sweet and savory), These have good body yet are just a little bit fluffy, which makes them perfect. Too often scones eat like house bricks, but not these ones.\n\nAt about $3-$4 for a pie/tartlet the prices are tolerable, but not quite as palatable as the pies.\n\nGuys, if you want to make your woman really love you, take her to Mission Pie.

And I must admit, bringing their white-and-red-peach pie to a picnic and then heating it on the charcoal grill (with the foil bottom still on, of course), worked wonderfully, and the fruit slices and glazy syrup certainly have the all-natural taste that's become de rigueur in California.  For the true test, I'll have to come back in winter for one of the nuttier/creamier/pumpkinier pies that are more to my heart's delight.", "author": "Wes M."}

The bananas were ripe and the cream was was whipped to perfection.\n\nThe other thing I really loved about this place was the atmosphere. It was very welcoming and very relaxing.

They make the world a happier place with their thick, flakey crusts and fresh, flavorful fillings and commitment to urban education and protecting natural resources.  Very nice.\n\nI threw down $5 for a \"Mini\" Banana Cream Pie and $2 for a walnut tartlet that was roughly the size of a Reese's peanut butter cup.

The staff was friendly and the vibe in there was very mellow.\n\nI can only think of 2 negatives.\n1) My mocha was more lukewarm than hot although it was very tasty. \n2) As I enjoyed my pie and conducted my interviews I should have been studiously paying attention to every word the participant was saying; instead, I was thinking  things like \"I wonder what I should write in my review about this place?\" and \"mmmmm, pie.\" I am sure I didn't miss anything important.", "author": "Lilly O."}

Kids work out on the \"pie ranch\" where the fruit is grown, they make it into pies in the Mission Pie bakery, and they sell it to their friends, neighbors, and local customers at the Mission Pie cafe.\n\nI do not care about any of this do-good nonsense.  I am serious about pie, and I would buy pie from the Devil himself if it was tasty.  Fortunately, Mission Pie also makes the best pie I have ever eaten.  You can tell that the fruit filling has been made from fresh, high-quality fruit (not frozen or canned).  The crust's taste and texture is absolutely perfect.\n\nWhether you're a big-hearted earth mother who loves helping children or an Ayn Rand quoting, self-interested capitalist, \"Mission Pie\" has both the fuzzy vibes and blue ribbon quality pie to make everyone happy.", "author": "Akdov T."}

I was uncomfortably full from lunch, but I'd heard such wonderful things about the pie that I still wanted a slice or two to sample after my long BART ride home.  At the time, I got Banana Cream and Walnut.  Both were absolutely delectable.  The fresh whipped cream is what really makes the Banana Cream special and the Walnut was not too sweet as many nut pies tend to be.  At the time, I was in love with the pie, but found the space to be awkwardly crowded.\n\nI went in for my second trip and was pleasantly surprised by the remodel.  Mission Pie is really nice and spacious, and I really love how they've changed the space.  They also make great use of having a bunch of large, communal tables rather than overcrowding the space with too many two-person tables and a sea of clunky chairs.\n\nToday, I sampled the Mixed Berry pie with the crumble topping and it was just as delish as I remembered the other pies to be.

I had the vegetarian pot pie with side salad, which was on the 7x7 list of places to go in the mission for under $10 or something like that. Since it came with a side salad, I was expecting something small, but no, it was big for a lunch! It's the same personal pie size as the Whole Food pot pies they sell (which are still my personal fav).  Like many SF places, this uses food fresh from the farms, and their bakery is green certified. The crust was some sort of soft, sweet, whole wheat sort of thing, and inside was full of a bunch of different veggies. The sauce wasn't your typical white cream sauce, and it had spinach and I don't even know what in there. Stuff that's in season. I love that. It was really tasty, and the only thing that kept it from being my fav veggie pot pie is that I don't have a sweet tooth and it was a bit sweet for me. The salad it came with was a side of cole slaw or rice salad. I chose the rice and I was STUFFED after my pie, so I ate the rice with dinner. YUM! Short grained chewy rice with greens, maybe kale?

An iced latte is espresso, milk and ice. If you have those 3 things then you can make an iced latte.\n\nAt first, their pies didn't really hit the spot.

Because the first time around, (a couple of months ago) they had \"mini\" banana cream pies, $5 each. It was perfect - I shared it with my girlfriend and we were in pie crust heaven...everything about that mini-pie was perfect and I made a promise to myself that the next time, we'd get our own mini pies - yes, it is that good. A perfect dessert for two. \n\nTo my disappointment, however, the next time we went (about 2 weeks ago) they no longer had the mini pies! We had to buy 2 small slices...at $3.50 each. A lot less pie. A lot less joy. \n\nBRING BACK THE MINI-PIE.", "author": "Dora A."}

My first bite of sweet potato pie at Mission Pie made me realize that other potato pies I've experienced have all been drag pumpkin pies. But this sweet potato pie knew who it was -- knew its flavors and the spices that were right for *it* -- and it sang the most beautiful aria of sweet potato flavor. \n\nSimilarly, the strawberry rhubarb was epic deliciousness. Chunky, tart, and fruity with a light and flaky crusts. \n\nExtra points for letting us sit and finish our pies and teas as they swept the store and put up chairs around us.

Not fancy by any means but decent pies, we had Banana Cream & Peach (a la mode, YUM) pies, coffee and a mocha. My only complaint here was my mocha didn't come out until the ies were almost all eaten and when it did they serve it in a cute little GLASS. Yes, a glass. It was so freaking hot, with no handle to pick it up by, it burned my hand. Really inappropriate way to serve a boiling hot beverage. However, when it did cool down enough to drink, it was enjoyable. It was quiet, not crowded and very cozy. Definetly would go here again.

Everything necessary for it to join the upper echelons of pie-dom. \n\nIt's the new year and myself, like 99.9% of the population, had resolved to lose weight.  Now, I say resolutions be damned!

I'm in serious heaven overload right now, and loving it.\n\nBut honestly, I have only been to Mission Pie once before today, and to say that it was magical is pretty accurate.  Only because it's this tiny place, that's so damn charming and cute it makes me want to open up my own bakery just so I can sit behind the counter and watch people play Parcheesi like I did while eating pie.  Have you watched Waitress with Keri Russell?  Go rent it, watch it and then go to Mission Pie and see how you feel.  If it's warm and fuzzies in your belly from the thought of a warm Saturday afternoon baking pies with sunlight streaming in just perfectly into the kitchen, we've got something in common.\n\nAnd I understand other reviewers feelings about the customer service being a little lack-luster, which I'm actually totally cool with.  I mean, is it wrong for me to want to purchase my pie and then be left alone so that I can pretend that they're not there while I shovel deliciousness into my (ha!) piehole?  I get a little eeked out when employees are overly friendly anywhere anyway.  I mean, I'm sorry, I've got a mouthful of food, I really can't answer your barrage of questions right now.\n\nWorth a try, and I definitely recommend the banana cream pie over the apple pie.

Oh my! Of the two, the banana cream was the superior -- it had actual flecks of vanilla in it, along with silky smooth banana puree (pudding?) and subtle, not overly sweet cream. The crust was total perfection -- buttery but not heavy.\n\nIt was clear the peach blackberry pie was made with uber-fresh fruits. I liked that the pie wasn't sour or tart as many fruit pies are -- it just tasted naturally sweet, like, well -- peaches and blackberries. The crust on this one, though, was not perfect like the other one. It was dry and a tad overcooked, with less buttery flavor. \n\nI recommend enjoying your pie with their coffee. Though it could've been a tad hotter, it was very flavorful and was the perfect accompaniment. \n\nThe restaurant itself was well-lit, felt homey, earthy, and I loved that there were several tables of varying sizes scattered throughout. Makes it convenient to go there whether you're by yourself, with a sweetie, or with a whole gaggle of people. We were there from 8:30pm til 10pm on a Friday night -- it was full but not crowded, and my friend and I didn't have trouble getting a table.\n\nThe service was courteous enough but a little surly and curt.

At the time they didn't have a lot of inventory (I don't remember seeing any desert pies at all) but out of curiousity and a desire to help a new local business I bought one of the four meat pies (the steak one) in the display and took it home to heat it up.  It was pretty good, a little greasy and that was that.  Let's just say that I didn't hold much hope in my heart for a place with only four menu items lasting too long in that location.\n\nWell a few weekends ago I was out on a sunny afternoon in the Mission with a few friends and we decided to do a quick food tour.  We went to El Faroltio on 24th and Mission (best place for a burrito that I've found yet btw) and stuffed our faces with mexi-goodness.\n\nAll during lunch my friend V kept going on and on about some amazing new pie shop nearby that we had to try and so we followed her down the street a block or so to Mission Pie.\n\nThe place had totally changed.  Its still a small, hole-in-the-wall sized shop, but instead of four sad little meat pies sitting on an otherwise empty shelf their display case was full of more traditional pie fare (think sweet potato, apple, bananna cream etc).  Luckily I had three friends with me so we got to do a little sampling.  By far the best was this pear and raspberry-crumbled joybomb that we all fought over like 4 toddlers with 1 crayon.

It's a tiny little space and the entrance is on 25th Street.  No large sign outside but a listing of their pie flavors for the day.   This place had to be serious about their pies if they're making \"mincemeat\" pies.  So we decided to walk in.  \n\nIt was nice and warm inside with just a few tables.  It looked like the place was getting ready to expand into the empty space to the right of the cafe.  I started to read about the cafe as I waited in line.  It helps learning disabled kids by teaching them the ins-and-outs of running a business.  How cool is that???  \n\nTo be honest the pies didn't look that great.  They initially looked a little flat so I was wary.  The pies didn't have that gorgeous looking crust with fancily piped cream, etc...  (e.g., Tartine).  I asked what their specialty was and the polite guy behind the counter  suggested pumpkin or apple, but we decided to go for the pear raspberry.  \n\nIt was heaven.   The pie crust was thin and super flaky to really let the fillings sing.  The pear was perfectly ripe before cooked because of its perfect texture and super sweet profile.  The raspberries formed a nice duet with the pears.  It was a good thing we asked for the whipped cream on top.  It was homemade, fresh whipped cream and it was nice alternative to heavy ice cream which would have drowned out the pie.", "author": "Tom K."}

There is no wireless, which works in my favor as i get the most studying done without internet distractions like yelp. And that also keeps out competition for outlets. Anyway back to the important stuff. The pies are nothing but the freshest ingredients and there are so many. Yum. As far as the savory pies, I've only had the chicken but I suspect the pork and veggie ones are excellent as well. Mission Pie isn't cheap but it is worth it!", "author": "Nina B."}

A friend and I ordered one Chicken Pot Pie and one Beef Cottage Pie and a slice of Apricot Frangipane Pie. After waiting 10 minutes for our pies to be heated, both arrived cold. We sent both savory pies back for another 10 minutes only to be disappointed when the pies were still cold. Not warm, definitely not hot, but cold. Rather than waste another 10 minutes to get the pies heated to lukewarm we decided to eat, despite the danger of improperly heated food and the risk of food poisoning. Plus, my chicken pot pie desperately needed salt. By the time I salted it myself I was just not into it because of the temperature. One nice gesture was that we were brought a free side of cole slaw as an apology for the wait and the ice cold pies. Too bad the cole slaw had a strong flavor of cumin and nothing else. We couldn't finish it. \n\nThis place seems like it excels more in the sweet pies because our Apricot Frangipane pie was excellent. Buttery delicious crust and fresh ingredients. Yum.\n\nThe coffee is excellent! Service was friendly and nice.", "author": "Foodie F."}

I've yet to master the perfect homemade pie crust, so I try not to miss the opportunity to try other people's perfect pie crusts.  Mission Pies has a big variety of delectable pies with tender flaky crusts.  I ordered the chicken pot pie and banana cream pie to go.  I was a little disappointed that they didn't ask me if I wanted my chicken pot pie heated up (even if it was a to go order).  I didn't have access to a heating source, so I ended up eating it cold  :-(  But it wasn't bad cold, and I sensed that it would have been excellent at the right temperature.  The pie itself with pretty big and full of big chunks of chicken and veggies.  The banana cream pie was flavorful and appropriately creamy.

Then at some point you just stand up, close your computer and smack me upside the head with it!  Then, and this is key, I hurl you through the plexiglass case containing said pies and away we go!!  It'll be pie and more pie everywhere, so much yummy tasty goodness flying in all directions!  In three dimensions!!!  God, I can't wait....\n\nOk well now they've moved next door.  Wonderful location, spacious, airy, corner shop with windows on two sides, all that good stuff.  BUT: pies are now behind much sturdier, what looks to be glass, cases.

Ordered one slice of the Shaker Lemon to split, two slices of the potato gratin tart and a glass of milk. $13.56 for three slices and a glass of milk. Could be worse.\n\nGot the Lemon right away. Crust was nice and flaky, filling was tasty. Potato tart took them 15 minutes to heat up. I was concerned that they had forgotten about it. A woman came over halfway through and said she was shutting off the oven and to not forget about the food in there. Wasn't worried - ovens stay hot. When we got the slices, they were warm-ish. A little frustrating, but at least they weren't cold. \n\nWhen I went up to get the potato slices, I asked for the glass of milk we had never received. The guy behind the counter asked what kind I had wanted, I told him, and I sat down. (They had been bringing everyone's drinks to them and I had sort of been lurking looking for my tart slices, so I figured I should sit.) I kept looking back at him to see if my drink was coming, but he was just sort of hanging out behind the counter, doing nothing. Okay - I ordered it, paid for it, waited, reminded you that it was missing, waited... We'll just get a refund. When we asked for a refund, he gave it to us, but seemed unconcerned that he had forgotten twice.\n\nSo, the pies are super tasty - I can still taste the potato gratin, I swear - but the service was awful. It's a super cute space, but I agree with some of the other reviewers. No one seemed particularly  happy to be there. I'm sure I'll be returning for more potato goodness, but I might see if I can just get it to go instead.", "author": "Jen R."}

We sampled some of their delicious mini walnut pie/tarts (buttery flakey crust, toasted sweet walnuts, and a filling that was not overly sweet), and also talked with Kristin, the owner, about their use of locally-sourced and seasonal ingredients (hence the walnut and not pecan pie).  Kristin also talked about the youth advocacy efforts at Mission Pie, which we thought was super cool of Kristin and the Mission Pie staff.  We bought a savory Red Bean, Collard Green and Andouille Pot Pie to take home and enjoy.  The savory pie was super flavorful and weighed a TON (for $7, the pie fed both me and my husband).  We'll have to come back to try other menu items.  For about $5, you can come in and enjoy a slice of pie and some coffee.

Curry = bland...no.  The strawberry rubarb had a nice bite to it, flavorful w/o too much sugar sweetness and a dolup of whipped cream - the real stuff, not from a pressurized can.  Alas the crust was only ok, not flaky and buttery.  From the other reviews I thought there would be lots of pies but the area where the pies are displayed is pretty small so unless they stack them up in the back I can't believe they would have a large number of pies.\n\nIf they ever move, they should look for a space where the baking and the eating spaces can be next to each other.

I am continually on the hunt for good pie in SF - and the hunt continues.  I'm a pie-lover from way back.  Growing up, my mom thought I was nuts because I never wanted birthday cake - always birthday pie.  I sent my husband to pick up a couple of their signature banana cream pies for a dinner party last night.  The pies were not terribly flavorful - just alright.  Seems like there was a lot of pudding filler and not a lot of bananas to be found.  The cream on top was fairly tasteless.  The crust hard as a rock.  I could barely chop through it with a large serving spoon.  Why a large serving spoon you ask?  Well, we had to serve our guests banana cream pie crumble in bowls dug/scraped out of the box with said large serving spoon.  You see, the cashier offered to have one of the girls working there tie up the two boxes so it would be easier for my husband to carry them back to the car.  A block away, the strings gave way and, voila, we had banana cream pie crumble.  So I did take off an extra start for no string-tying skills - and having to deal with a crabby and disappointed husband when he got home.", "author": "Bobbi C."}

I regretted the apple and pumpkin at that moment, which means I wasn't going to go full five star. Then again I think I can give a fiver on account of the best lemon pie I've ever tasted.

Every day we'd pass through the Mission, she'd say \"Hey wanna go get some pie?,\" or every morning she'd say \"Hey lets go get pie for breakfast!\" Who the hell eats pie for breakfast? That's just crazy talk.\n\nI finally gave in and gave Mission Pie a try, and it looks like I am going to be eating pie for breakfast more often now. We shared a savory spinach and cheese pie and an apple galette, and both were delicious. The ingredients were fresh and organic, and the organic orange juice I had was very good. I was surprised, yet delighted, when I saw they did not use canned whipped cream. The crusts were so good, I could probably eat them by themselves.\n\nParking has the posibility of being a major drag in this area, but we found easy parking on Sunday. The 14 and 49 MUNI lines run right past the building where Mission Pie is housed, and the 24th Street BART station is only a few blocks away. Public transportation is relatively easy to Mission Pie, and is worth the trek.\n\nAs for the address, it's not technically wrong, but it's a little misleading at the same time. 2901 Mission Street is Southern Exchange. On the side of the building (down 25th Street) is Mission Pie. They didn't really have a visible sign (the sandwich board wasn't out when I went), but they do have a small paper sign above the door.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend Mission Pie. I'll definitely be going back again.", "author": "Alexis C."}

I much prefer the Banana Cream Pie from Fat Apples in Berkeley-and it costs about the same.  The one from the fat apples is so luscious, so banana cream pie ish, not to sweet with a delicate crust. can't compare them.\n\nand the other reason i give it this rating, is sadly, the people there were not so nice. i had such a great feeling when i was on my way there-i was like \"pie! and it helps the kids!! it can't get any better!\".  but when i went in, expecting nice folks who believed in the mission of mission pie, i got some not so friendly person who acted like it was a bother to help me.  and then i decided to buy more pie than i had originally asked for, and this person acted like that was even more of a bother.  i was nice, i was apologetic for adding more to my order. but the person helping me was none of those, and seemed so happy to get rid of me.  \n\ni came in happy and left thinking i will probably not go back there for a long time. and you all don't know what that means...when i found out there was a place that sold just pie....it was a DREAM come true. living in dc for the last few years, i have searched the city, the internet, for a good pie. for 3 years i have asked, googled, yelped, and all. so when i found there was a place in the bay that sold only pie i thought i will never search again.  it really meant a lot to me.  but, this experience broke my dreams of my pie in the sky....\n\n\nwhen the apple pie is in season i will try again to give it a fair chance.  and i will update my review, because i really don't like giving negatice criticism.  and i always give a second chance.", "author": "maya m."}

All I need is another fattening place to add to my weekly list of 'must eat'\".  \n\nIt was amazing! I had a slice of pear/ raspberry with a crumbly top.  I don't know how else I can get my point across.  It was so f***ing good!  Mission Pie also passed one of my most important standards for good dessert - FRESH whipped cream.  I hate canned whipped cream, so I was thrilled when I saw them spooning fresh onto my pie.  My friend ordered banana cream pie, which was just as well made.\n\nBesides the skill that goes into the pie baking, the ingredients also make this place 5 star worthy.  Everything comes from the farm run by mission high school and a staff of volunteer farmers.  Even the flour is made from the grain grown on the farm just south of Pacifica.  The pie varieties change depending on what ingredients are available from the farm. Totally awesome!  And, each pie slice is only $3.50 or $18.00 for a whole pie.  You would have to spend about $7.00 for a slice of lesser pie at Whole Foods or any restaurant.\n\nThe interior is really cute too.  Just steps off of crazy Mission Street, I felt like I was in wine country when I was inside.  Totally quaint space.  This place is gonna cost me an extra hour at the gym every week, but it will totally be worth it for what I anticipate to be weekly splurges.\n\nNote: The entrance is on 25th Steet.  After walking up and down Mission, determined to have pie, I finally called 411.  It may have added an extra $1 to the expense, but still absolutely worth it.", "author": "t l."}

I had the banana cream pie and the walnut tart.  The banana cream pie was okay -- not sweet enough to me but my bf really liked it. I took one bite of the pie and was deciding how I felt about the flavor profile when I broke off a piece of the crust to nibble on and was stopped in my banana cream pie tracks.  Blecch! The crust was terrible -- bland, whatever the opposite of light and flaky is, and tasted like it was made of some too-good-for-you grain that pie crust should never be made out of.  I wondered aloud if the crust was gluten free or vegan or something (nothing wrong with vegan, I just like to prepare my palette for it).  Anyhow, that crust left a bad taste in my month and forced me to switch to a different pie.  I chose the walnut tart because they were out of every single berry pie  (not cool) and it was okay.  Better than the banana cream pie but that crust was equally unflavorful.  Overall I was left thinking fondly of every good slice of pie I've had over the last year and scheming on how soon I could have another slice of great pie.  So three stars to Mission Pie for putting me in a pie-frame-of-mind and sending me into my own kitchen to whip up a three berry pie with a delicious, light, flaky, and buttery crust.", "author": "I.

The first was precisely what I was hoping for, and the second markedly surpassed my expectations. The banana cream pie really is a standout.\n\nIn general I tend to steer clear of desserts because I feel that most sweet treats do cloy, but these baked confections prove the exception to that perception.

Mission Pie. The key to a good pie is a good crust and this place does not mess around. I have had every single pie they offer and each one is more or equally as delicious as the first. They currently have a walnut pie (like pecan, but bolder,) a pumpkin pie (served with cloudy home made whipped cream on top,) a banana cream (which they started to put actual slices of banana in that totally sets this pie above the bar), a traditional apple (with monster hunks of succulent granny smith apples) and my all time favorite, the pear raspberry which has literally quater cuts of pear tossed together with tangy raspberry with a little bit of crumble crust on top. They also offer savory pies which, like the sweet pies, can vary due to available produce. The savory pies are individual lunch pies which vary from rosemary garlic beef to curry chicken and spinach cheese. The coffee is fair trade and everything (minus the meat pies obviously) is vegetarian friendly. i.e. no lard in the crusts.\n\nMy favorite thing to do is to go to Mission Pie with some friends and order a meat pie each and then order a whole pie and share it between us. There are few things better that fork battling your friends for the last piece of pear soaked crust. \n\nIt is part of an organization that teaches kids how to grow produce and harvest it and then use it to make product and then sell it. You can usually find the two owners sharing a meal and one highschool kid working the counter when you go in.\n\nMy only qualm is that it's a bit small inside and they really aren't used to people coming in to get pie yet as they only opened at the begining of the year.

It seems to me that homemade pie is always a good idea, even more so when made with sustainably organic ingredients. These lovely little slices come from the best stuff that Pie Ranch has to offer. Even if the word organic doesn't strike your fancy, eating a piece of pie from Mission Pie is not just good for your tummy, but great for the community of people who work the farm in Pescadero. For those of us who never see the light outside the city, Mission Pie offers a slice of small town inside its' wooden-walled, wide windowed sunny cafe nestled along Mission Street. Sometimes there's just nothing better than a slice of banana cream and a cup of mint tea ala Mission Pie.", "author": "Michelle K."}

I sampled the strawberry rhubarb and the walnut and enjoyed them both. The walnut was sweet and custardy and rich. The strawberry rhubarb filling was very jammy with big chunks of fruit, but possibly a little too sweet and syrupy. The crust seemed too heavy and dark to me on both-- but to be honest, I am so violently biased on the subject of pie crust that it is almost impossible to ever completely please me.\nThe whole concept of this place is so great, with the school kids learning to bake and the locally sourced produce, that I am tempted to give it an extra star.

Vegan apple also good though not as memorable as the banana cream.

I bought a $7 vegan pot pie. It took quite a while to heat up (more than 10 min), When it arrived at the table, it was only lukewarm and cooled quickly. The pot pie was filling and crust tasty. More importantly, I did not experience any itching afterwards. J got the banana cream (but would have preferred it to be colder) and my friend F&L split a pecan pie (they raved over it).

Mission Pie is simply heaven when you stroll in and feel the warmth of the pies (after your banana cream or raspberry or apple pie, you quickly feel that sensation, which is physiologically comparable to a stroke, is the euphoric cloud that drapes over you).  Coffee, you need this, both to wash what God just served you as pie and to rouse that constriction you're gripped by, will makes things all better.\nThis place has sentimental value for me, but please don't let that stop you from enjoying P.I.E.\nFYI: if you keep missing out on banana cream when you get there, try calling and ordering an entire pie to take home.  They've said that many folks have began calling and putting dibs on a pie as early as 12-2pm.  It's something to think about for that next dinner party you might go to and want to delight your company with by presenting this to them.\nEat pie, it's creamy good.", "author": "felix c."}

It went easy, the crust was thick, not too flaky, and I was able to dish out the first one in a single sweep.\nThere could actually be a tad more bananas in the custard.  The whipped top was scrumptious.  Anything with fresh whip cream is amazing.\nLast night after dinner, my friends and I ended up to the shop for some sweet treats.  We shared the banana cream, and also the pear ginger.  The pear had great flavor, ginger glaze bursting and lovely pear texture.  The crust wins in my book.

It might very well be a good cause, but does the food taste good enough to keep coming back?\n\nI had high hopes when this place opened. It's not too difficult to make good, American-style fruit desserts, and there wasn't really a place in my the immediate neighborhood that pulled it off.\n\nMy first big complaint is that not all of their creations are that good, and any particular creation may suffer from inconsistent quality. Apple pie, banana cream pie and strawberry tortes tend to be pretty good, but apricot tortes can be downright bad. While the fruit filling is pretty consistent over time, the crust is not--sometimes it can be undercooked (and thus doughy) or too salty and not buttery enough.\n\nMy second big complaint is the lack of consistency in what's available. Do they just decide what they feel like making for the day and make it? Why else would so many popular things be out of stock so often? The lack of attention to customers' desires baffles me. I'd go there more often if I knew I had a good chance of getting one of my favorite desserts.\n\nMy last complaint is that, given the quality issues, the prices are too high. They sometimes charge more than Noe Valley Bakery & Bread, which is a truly professional, consistently fantastic outfit.\n\nIf it's open and you can make the trip, I'd recommend Noe Valley Bakery & Bread over Mission Pie any day.

The fruit inside was so perfect and soft. I devoured that pie in a matter of minutes.I'm usually a very slow eater but magically this pie was gone quickly.I've come three more times since then and each time I fall more deeply in love.

I'm not exactly sure how it happened, I think Icka baked a pie for Josh, then he twittered about it, then someone threatened to steal it, then the twitterverse exploded in a veritable piegasm.  Everything from the Peculiar Purple Pieman of Porcupine Peak (Strawberry Shortcake's nemesis) to Warrant's seminal Cherry Pie video were invoked in a day-long, unwinnable contest to proffer the most profound pie-related promulgation.  It may come as no surprise, but this caused my mind (and stomach) to wander towards the idea of actually consuming pie, instead of trading 140 character messages about it.  This led me to MIssion Pie, which offers both fantastic pies and a fantastic mission statement.  Ultra fresh ingredients and ultra fresh baked goods make for some damn fine desserting, and they also offer some interesting looking savory pies (which will be sampled at a later date).  At $18 a pie, it comes out as a little pricey, so I'm reserving a 5th star until I sample more of their wares.", "author": "Steve G."}

However, I really, really have a bone to pick: I think the woman who owns this place is unnecessarily unfriendly, to the point of seeming almost hostile. She walks in and out, in and out, like she owns the place (well, she does), her boots thudding on Mission Pie's nice wood floors, and she not once SMILES, not once. Nor does she acknowledge the folks sitting there reading, eating, whatever.... In fact, she almost seems to be not indifferent but actively unfriendly. And as I left last time, I saw her sitting outside, and she just looked at me without a smile or a wave or anything, which I thought was particularly problematic as I had been sitting there, watching her stomp in and out, for over an hour. OK fine, I know that her business is for a wonderful cause and I know that she is doing wonderful things for the community (although I hated the article in the SF Chronicle that mentioned over 3 times that the kids working there have \"special needs\" or are in \"special education\"-- hello?\"), The bottom line is,  I think some friendliness might also be nice too. \n\n\n\n\nThe pie is super yummy and it seems like they add new flavors everytime I go. And they've also added a VEGAN muffin although they haven't had it everytime I've been. The coffee is great-- super strong and flavorful. I just feel that $3.50 a slice is a bit expensive for a slice of pie and so I feel guilty every time I come here. Yes, I know it's for a good cause and it's nice to see local folks working here (although, I have to say, I've only seen a high school student once-- all the other times it has been mission hipsters and the woman who seemingly runs the place-- she always has a laptop and doesn't come across as super friendly but maybe she is just shy.)", "author": "Michele F."}
