City View offers that service, as well as an English picture menu for you to order items you're too impatient to wait for.  This place is great for tourists and those who are intimidated by the frenzied pace of your typical Chinese restaurant.  The staff is friendly and professional, and the restaurant itself is very clean.  Although the servings are quite expensive for dim sum, I don't mind paying that extra money for the top-notch service.  Make sure to come before 1-2pm for a variety of dim sum options.  Also, there is street parking, but you will have to circle around quite a bit.  I'd recommend just parking in a structure.  There always seems to be a wait here, so I'd suggest making reservations, although I only waited 20 minutes on a Sunday noon.  For those who are beginner dim sum eaters, City View is a good starting point.", "author": "Charissa S."}

Just back from China (granted, not Guangzhou, but still...) and I dare say the dim sum quality is better at City View.  Variety is spot on, and the wait wasn't too bad on a Saturday at 1pm - maybe just 10 minutes.\n\nMust-haves are the turnip cake which is especially crispy and not too oily, the kung pao shrimp which is a nice take on a classic shrimp dumpling, and the crispy-top dessert buns (I didn't get a name) that was the absolute perfect dim sum dessert for a sweet tooth that also likes a bit of substance.\n\nThe only miss is the price.  Dim sum for 3 ran us $90 with only a pot of tea to drink.  Ok ok, this is SF, but it's DIM SUM.  It's cheaper in London and NYC, two other pricey cities.  Tho fine, it's really good food.

They close at 2:30pm so you really have to time it correctly as there is usually a huge line of people on Saturdays waiting for a table, and the hostess is running around with a legal pad filled with names operating on a system that will make zero sense to you. Just take a seat on the curb and be patient. \n\nIt's a white table cloth restaurant but it's not fancy- you'll get a mix of locals and tourists, families, hungover USF students, and Chinatown regulars who have been coming for years. They are one of the last dim sum restaurants in the city I believe who still have the carts, but they also have a menu you can order off of which I prefer because you know what you're getting is hot and fresh (out the kitchen). \n\nMy favorites are the shrimp and chive dumplings, shrimp siu mai, xiao long bao, char siu bao, and the eggplant and tofu. The hot tea is also really nice. For 3 people who eat A LOT with a couple of beers, we usually get out of there for about $80.", "author": "Lauren M."}

When it's only open for a few hours each day and yelp sometimes has a warning for unclean business practice yenno you're in for a real treat! There's almost always a wait and plenty of Chinese patrons so you know it's the spot! \n\nMy most recent experience went like this: my coworker and I arrived a few minutes after 12 which was pushing the lunch rush. Since we were only 2, there was no wait! Lucky us! When we arrived it looked as though every table was full except for the one we were seated at. \n\nMy coworker and I have both spent time (a year for me in Shanghai & 5 years in Beijing for my coworker) so we know what to expect dining in a Chinese place but They had great service. Waiters were attentive and all the carts were filled with variety. \n\nMy coworker does not eat pork so we let the waiters know and they had great options for us. A few highlights of the food: onion pancake, scallop& shrimp dumplings, chicken shui mai, deep fried shrimp egg rolls w sweet chili sauce, and my own personal pork dishes of Shanghai soup dumplings & bbq pork pastries which were my absolutely favorite! For dessert we shared the sesame balls that were filled w red bean. \n\nThis was enough for the two of us to even have a few things leftover for to go. Our bill came to $55 which also included one coke (no tea). \n\nspecial tips: never go close to closing as they won't have carts anymore and will have the regular menu which isn't the full dim sum experience. If you're entertaining people visiting the area or have a large party they have plenty of large tables to accommodate but definitely will have a wait especially on weekends. If it's too crowded R& G lounge up on Kearney is a great replacement.", "author": "Jazmine S."}

The BBQ pork noodles were by far and away the stand out on the menu.  I was underwhelmed by the siu mai (they seemed overcooked), and I prefer a greasier, more gelatinous filling.  The fried taro wasn't as greasy as I'm used to, which is not a bad thing!  \n\nThe service was impressive for an Asian joint, but I'm surprised that six dishes totalled more than $40 for lil ole me.

It was busy, but not too packed and we were seated right away. We ordered tea (guk boh - black & chrysanthemum tea! DELICIOUS!) and the carts started coming around pretty quickly. \n\nI enjoyed the food here...just not the usual dim sum. Generally, my go to is the shumai and hargow, and unfortunately, those were sub par! I did enjoy the soup dumplings, crab claw, lettuce wraps, honey walnut shrimp, and peking duck!  Sadly, most of those were premium prices, bringing our total to $75 for two people. Womp, womp. The chili also leaves a bit to be desired on the spice level. \n\nOverall, not bad if you're looking for more non-traditional dim sum, but prices are a bit on the high side.

I don't have to describe every single dish because they were all good. The taro cake is already, a winner. Love this place. Only issue, we didn't get all the different types of dim sum to choose from so we got a limited choice to pick from.

Not sure if the downstairs is typically used during this time, but the place was fairly busy. The restaurant is more spacious than other dim sum spots, with a little more space in the aisles to walk by. The space looked clean and the inside was nice and bright. The place is located in Fidi/almost CT, so there are other dim sum options not too far from this place. \n\nWe were seated immediately and the food carts came around quickly and pretty frequently, so we were always given more options before finishing what we had and waiting for more. That's the great thing about going with a larger group of people to dim sum is that you can taste a greater variety of dishes. \n\nI will say that the vegetarian dishes were really tasty! But my favorite was probably the xiao long bao. They had some dishes that are not typically offered at dim sum, like some chicken dishes. They even had green tea mousse as an option for dessert, different than the typical sweet buns you would order. The main dishes were pretty standard, but the food was still pretty tasty. The calamari had a better type of breading than I'm used to-more of a soy sauce taste which was a nice change. And you can't go wrong with sesame balls. I do wish they had a little more of the red bean paste, but I still enjoyed them.\n\nGood dim sum spot for lunches with coworkers if you don't want to make the trip to another spot in CT.", "author": "Meghan J."}

Once seated, they promptly get you the pot of that amazing jasmine tea, the dim sum carts start coming by. We opted for our usual favorites - the pork dumplings, BBQ buns, BBQ duck, Shanghai dumplings, sticky rice in lotus leaf and spare ribs. Everything was amazing! The duck was fabulous. It came with a bun and the combination was so perfect! All through our brunch, the line outside never ceased. However the staff handled it well and kept the guests moving! This place is very close to the Coit Tower, so makes a good place to drop by for breakfast/brunch.

I am literally drooling even thinking about them. So soft, served hot and filling was just amazing. Great flavor !!!!!\n\nChicken skewers - Crispy yet tender chicken thigh on a skewer. Paired well with the spicy red sauce, enough for 2 people as you get only 2 skewers in a plate. \n\nAmbience and Service - It was packed when I went in, had to wait for 15 minutes to get a table.

We were a bit traumatized from our $100+ dim sum for 2 at Yank Sing a while ago so we approached this place with a bit of reservation. Located in a cute quiet street off the main hustle and bustle of Chinatown. When we arrived on a Sat around prime brunch time, the wait for 2 was only 5-10 min. I loved the feel of white tablecloths and the large open space. Lots of carts were already rolling around with goodies to be selected. Upon being seated, our eyes quickly darted around and we had a good idea of what we wanted to order. We started with tea and the food arrived so quickly that I completely forgot I had wanted a beer to go with my meal haha. Yes they charge for hot tea but I'm not sure why that's such a big deal that you would dock off stars. The food quality, freshness  and selection is excellent here (not to mention pricing and efficient service). Chicken Siu mai and spinach dumpling were just ok; have had better elsewhere. Pan fried chive dumpling was good and i was surprised by the high quality of their XLB (they sit in cute foil holders so you can easily slurp up all the juices). My favorites were the rice noodles roll with shrimp and they also had a shrimp toast like dish.

Chive dumplings had what Cantonese people call \"wok hei,\" hard to describe in English, but basically that you can tell the oil was sizzling when food was cooked / mark of a good chef. Sesame balls looked normal. Tip: Xiao long bao isn't a normal dim sum dish, people.\n\nI always lol a little bit when I see that Yelp warns me that the restaurant I'm reading about has poor food safety...unfortunately, I'd probably argue that the more authentic a Chinese spot is, the poorer the food handling (and yes I'm from Hong Kong).", "author": "Nicole H."}

It's clean and well-lit, close to their hotel, and the dim sum is it too Americanized. The quiet Commercial Street is also plus as I'm skeptical of the loudness and poor hygiene of most dim sum places in Chinatown. \n\nAs my friends are from Dallas, where they normally don't eat dim sum, we ordered a variety of dim sums to taste. This place still retains the tradition of dim sum carts. Carts full of bamboo crates with steam billowing through the lids will parade down the dining room. Customers (mostly non-Chinese) could see what might be of their interests. \n\nEach order (ranging from $3-$9) usually has three to four pieces. The har gau (steamed shrimp dumplings) is good, but the siu mai (steamed pork dumpling) is a bit dry and the wrapper gooey--sticking to the top of the mouth. They have a good variety of dumplings with a mix and match of ingredients like leeks, spinach, watercress and meat. \n\nThey have good selection of steamed, grilled, and deep fried plates. My health-conscious friends only shared a small order of deep fried egg rolls and they were crispy. But there are no shortage of calamari, fried dumplings, fried taro puffs and the like. The food we had were tasty and authentic. They also serve lunch portion of dinner entrees like the honey glazed walnut and shrimps, Peking duck (two pieces of duck with steamed buns), and spareribs. \n\nService is adequate enough. Empty plates and crates quickly bused.  Water glasses always topped. My only gripe is that they are pushy--ready to run us out to turn the table. As soon as we put our chopsticks down and the food running thin on the table, the cashier clerk would come and ask if we need anything else with a check ready. She did it three times. But we only wanted to take a break and chatted so my friends kindly told her we are still looking forward to tasting more food.

We can not get Dim Sum on the Big Island of Hawaii and if you want good Chinese food, you'd have to fly to Oahu and go to China Town. My first time to San Francisco and China Town was on top of my priority list. My party and I asked our Lyft driver to take us to the most recommended Dim Sum spot. He drove us to this little restaurant, but they didn't offer Dim Sum. So.... We went to Yelp. Luckily, City View was right across the street and up a block. We walked in and this place was PACKED! The entire place was well lit and extremely effervescent! So many people, so many carts! The noise level is a little higher than average, which is fine with me.  We were able to get a seat immediately. We were all given water and was offered hot tea. Then, the carts came by, one after another!!! Unlike the Dim Sum places in Oahu, you have a WIDE variety of different foods, not just Dim Sum (Chicken Feet for example). We were fortunate in our timing because shortly after we arrived, a plethora of guest showed up, lining all the way out the door!!! With the fast pace service, I didn't realize how fast we ate. With a party of four, we were in and out in less than an hour and we ate to our hearts content! The quality of food was spectacular and personally, so was the customer service!!! This is definitely the place to go on lunch break just because of the quick and quality of service. They have different sizes tables, ranging from big to small (two person).

We mostly avoided those and stuck with normal dim stuff items, which were generally not bad, but the limited selection left my dim sum craving somewhat unsatisfied.\n\nPrices weren't too high: $3.85 for small dishes, $4.40 for medium, $5 for large and $6 for special. Tea was $3/person. Service is what you'd expect from any Chinese place. They don't have very many carts going around but they're surprisingly good about making their way around all the tables, even the ones in the corner.\n\nOn the plus side, they take reservations even for dim sum (though it doesn't seem to get as packed as a lot of other places). And they validate 2 hrs parking at the Chinatown Portsmouth Square parking lot nearby.\n\nGET:\n* Shrimp Siu Mai ($6, special) - Amazing texture! Super tender and soft. Comes with 3 siu mai.\n* Mushroom Fun Gao ($4.40, medium) - Comes with 3 dumplings filled with wood ear mushroom and veggies. Delicious!\n\nSTANDARD:\n* Shrimp Dumpling ($5, large) - Comes with 4 pretty large dumplings.\n* Turnip Cake ($3.85, small) - A little greasy had a good texture\n* Chicken Feet ($3.85, small) - Tender and flavorful\n\nSKIP:\n* Chinese Broccoli ($6, special) - SUPER greasy\n* Beef Rice Noodle Roll ($5, large) - The rice noodle had a weird mushy texture and the beef tasted odd\n* Stuffed Bell Pepper ($5, large) - Comes with 3 green bell peppers topped with shrimp. Not really a traditional dim sum dish. Shrimp was the same as the shrimp dumpling or shrimp siu mai, but each bell pepper was sitting in a pool of oil. Kind of gross.", "author": "Jessie L."}

Not overly pricey like Yang Sing but not cheap as it caters to the FIDI business crowd on weekdays.  Great option to bring out of town visitors staying at the Portsmouth Square Hilton.  I give it a four for being a place that you would take people to impress without overly spending.\n\nCustomers get treated to the push cart experience instead of the mark your dish on the paper experience - where you are at the whim of receiving a dessert before your first savory dish.  I know, I could order dessert at the end of the meal in those paper establishments and not mark it at all.  But for some reason, Baked Custard Buns are always the first to run out on weekends in most dim sum restaurants!  Ha, Ha.  Oops, I digress.  Oh, by the way, since it is a FIDI restaurant, Management will try to turn your table over quickly on weekdays.  \"Do you want anyhting else?\" was heard more than a few times.\n\nThe food is of decent quality although the wraps on the Mushroom Dumpling were too sticky and broke apart as you tried to pry it from the bamboo steamer.  The Walnut Shrimp were a bit to gritty as you could feel the sugar granules on your tongue.   Better to feel the granules on someone else's tongue right?  (Snuck in to see if anyone reads my write-ups).  The Peking Duck could be crispier but I understand that when you're serving fast food (FIDI fast) Peking Duck you settle for a less perfect version.  Who doesn't want Peking Duck for two?  Now if they could serve a Pork Belly Bau - that would rival their individual Peking Duck Bun as a seller.  Hear me traditional dim sum sit-down restaurants!?  Back to critiquing... the main stays like Xiao Loong Bao, Har Guow, Siu Mai, Fried Taro Cake, were passable.\n\nAll in all, a presentable dim sum restaurant for out-of-towers and business acquaintances.", "author": "Scott L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-04", "description": "I'm writing this review from the perspective of a tourist in the city. I grew up eating dim sum pretty often, but my wife didn't. Because of that, I spent a lot of time online before our trip to San Francisco trying to find a good dim sum place - somewhere with good food, but that wasn't a hole in the wall. (I'd be down for trying the dirtiest, non-English speaking place if they had the best dumplings in town, but I didn't think that would go over too well with the wife.)\n\nThe website for City View made it look like it would probably be good, so that's where we headed. As we walked there I began to get nervous. The street it was on was more like an alley and there weren't any signs that a nice restaurant would be anywhere near there. We got close to where it should be and, sure enough, there was a little wooden sign on the sidewalk with the name of the restaurant and an arrow pointing to it. The windows were heavily tinted and I figured this place must be a dump... but then we opened the doors and were greeted by a lovely, clean interior with plenty of linen-topped tables and carts running up and down the aisles. There were also Asians and white people eating here - a good sign that we would get good food, but also be able to order (plus I saw one of the white guys with one chopstick in each hand... clearly we wouldn't be the whitest people here today).\n\nWe ordered a ton of dumplings, sticky rice, honey walnut shrimp, and other goodies. Everything was delicious and exactly what I'd been looking forward to. I don't want to say the food was perfect, but it was pretty great and we enjoyed everything. The waiters were all very nice and, while some spoke English better than others, none of them had any trouble understanding our orders. They did a good job coming by with the carts and seemed to always be there just as we were thinking about getting another plate of whatever dumplings we just finished. The prices were also pretty reasonable, especially when it's possible to rack up a pretty hefty bill eating dim sum.\n\nCity View ended up being perfect for our needs. It has the delicious food and good variety that I was looking for, but was also clean and accessible for someone less adventurous (like my wife). I would definitely return here myself and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for anyone else looking for a good balance of authenticity and accessibility.", "author": "Jeremy M."}

It's relatively on the pricey side in Chinatown (near Financial District). There's a wide assortment of dim sum, all of which I must say are fresh (hot), beautifully plated and of course, delicious. Most of the dim sum are delivered by moving carts which come pretty frequently. However, if you want something you don't see, flag someone down, he/she will bring it to you. The service is prompt and attentive without the usual attitude you'll find in most dim sum places.\n\nClean and spacious dining area, a good selection of dim sum, all of which made the whole dim sum experience a pleasant one.

City View is actually one of the few, if not only places, in SF that actually takes dim sum reservations, which is pretty nice when you don't have all day or want to take guests to dim sum but want to eat at a notable hour. They definitely deserve a fourth star for that alone.\n\nWe however, didn't have reservations and went into the wait queue with everyone else. The place was definitely the epitome of chaos because we were seated within a few minutes on a lucky whim that a waiter saw us standing and pointed at a random table and seated us.. while neglecting everyone else. oops.\n\nAnyways, the food here is decent! We got the typical dim sum classics -- siu mai, shrimp dumplings, rice rolls with shrimp, pai gu, and some other things. The menu here is fairly limited relative to other dim sum places (no porridge, no basic fried noodles), and it's pretty clear that the places caters to the nontraditional crowd based on a) how great everyone's English is b) how Americanized some of their newer creations were c) the fact that they have a set menu that's basically just various forms of chow mein lol. \n\nThat being said though, the dim sum dishes themselves were decent. The pai gu was not very good though, but everything else was quite comparable in quality.

I took my family there on a weekend (the place was surprisingly busy), and my two sons (one picky, one not) really enjoyed it.

I've been to dim sum places where everything tastes suspiciously similar; not the case at City View. I've also been to other places where an hour after eating I developed a tingly upper lip and a headache (I assume from too much MSG). Not the case here.

In past visits I would have just picked one off of Grant that looked appealing, but truth is, they all really look the same. This trip I was fortunate to have City View recommended by friends who live in the Bay area, and I was not disappointed.\n\nFirst, I loved the layout of the restaurant, the tables are strategically placed to allow carts to move freely and efficiently through the aisles. Little things like the clean white tables cloths, ceramic tea pots, and quality chop sticks were nice. The professional service, attention, and attitude of the wait staff is a welcome change from the typical dim sum place.\n\nI thought the food was outstanding. I liked the smaller portion sizes of the dishes. For example, the baked char siu bao were about half the size that you normally see. I thought the quality of all the dishes was outstanding, but my favorite dish was easily the Peking duck. The duck was cooked just right; tender, moist, and flavorful. It is served with steamed baos that are a perfect compliment to the natural saltiness and oil of the duck.\n\nMy other favorites included the Shanghai Dumplings, Pan Fried Chive Dumplings, Stuffed Crab Claw and the Pork Sui Mai. The Shanghai dumpling are smallish and served in individual alumunum pie shells to contain the wonderful juices. The Chive Dumplings were not greasy, and maybe the best I've ever had. The Crab Claws were king crab claws with a tasty shrimp stuffing. The Sui Mai dumplings were tasty and my daughter's favorite.\n\nCity View was a great experience for us. It is a bit more expensive than other places, and the dishes are generally smaller, but I thought it was worth it. It's a clean restaurant with good service, and great attention to detail. The quality and variety of dishes rival other Dim Sum places that I've had. I strongly recommend and would definitely come back.", "author": "Paul C."}

The line was so so long and when we wrote down our names to get a table the lady said it would be a 30 minute wait. However, it was much longer than 30 minutes. When we got seated, around lunch time, it was super tight and pack. The waitress and waiters hardly had any room and I felt squished. The service was not too bad but not so great either. Now the food. The servings were very small compared to SoCal dim sum. And when they were stamping our orders, it did not list any price it just says small, medium, large, special 3, etc. So my party was confused with the price and not sure how much we ate. I really enjoyed the spinach dumpling, this crab meat plate, and sesame chicken. Not sure if their dumplings are meant to be sticky but after a while it got sticky that I couldn't get it off from the plate. They don't offer chili oil so I was disappointed because I love chili oil and soy sauce together. Our total bill came out to $187 for 5 people which is pretty pricy to me. But it was overall good.

This test is almost always accurate.  This time it's no exception.\n\nThe har gaw and siu mai are excellent, and so are most of the items we ordered.  The Shanghai siu long bau is particularly good.  The skin is thin and the filling is moist with the juice wrapped inside the skin.  The sticky rice is yummy, and better still, the leaf peels off easily without the rice sticking to it -- which highlights the skill of the chef. \n\nService is above average among Chinese dim sum restaurants.  The cart ladies have radios and they can be paged if you need to find a particular item.  Prices are expensive, especially compared to those in nearby Chinatown.

Their siu mai were pretty small, and the dumpling skin was inconsistent between dishes. The shrimp dumplings' was thick and not soft, while the chive dumplings' was oily and slippery. Overall the popular dim sum dishes were not terrible, but left something to be desired. There was an eggplant and fried tofu dish that I liked, though, because the fried tofu had a shrimp embedded in it!\n\nThe main redeeming factor for this restaurant was their Peking duck and fried shrimp and crab balls. Peking duck is usually ordered during big family dinners and banquets, so I was surprised to see it here. It comes with two buns per serving for the diners' convenience. The duck isn't excessively fatty, and the bun was still warm, despite it being the last one on the cart. My only complaint was that the green onion should have been sliced more neatly, but that's a minor detail. The fried shrimp and crab balls are one of my favorite dishes, and it was perfect here. The shrimp outside was lightly fried, so there wasn't more breading than shrimp, and there was a nice big chunk of crab waiting inside.

It's the usual Cantonese cart fare, but taken up a notch in terms of healthiness, ingredient quality, and ambiance. I stick to seafood except for the pork and crab xiao long bao (petite but juicy and intensely flavorful). As always, if you see something unusual, grab it before it goes (at my last visit, there was a vegetable dumpling that was deeply shiitake flavored, with a great kick to it). You can order special items, but it's not worth the extra expense (tried the Peking duck and found it disappointing, flaccid and greasy).", "author": "Lisa O."}

On my past visit, I tried the fried noodle for the first time (amazing) and got the sesame chicken again (way better than any Panda Express).

And that's not to say there's a lack of dim sum, because there certainly isn't: it's to say that, in spite of ALL the dim sum the city has to offer, they're all a bit lacking. Given that, to date, the best I've found in the area is Hong Kong Lounge, so compared to that, City View is even more... just okay.\n\nGoing with a few coworkers, the four of us ordered a slough of things, from dumplings, to buns, to rolls, and etc - admittedly, some more Americanized dishes than I'm used to. But, of all these things, not a single one stood out as being particularly good (or bad) - just all very consistently okay.\n\nThat said, the prices aren't too bad for this part of town, and coming in around noon without a reservation, the wait wasn't really more than about ten minutes. So, if I'm in dire need of some dim sum, I could see myself coming here again - though, there are a number of other places to try in the immediate area as well!\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - A fairly large restaurant, possibly with multiple floors (I wasn't paying particular attention to this part).

We didn't want to pay a lot, so Yank Sing was out of the question.  We knew the trek to Chinatown was inevitable and decided on lunch at City View.  On the edge of FiDi & Chinatown in the Commercial Street alleyway is City View.  Unassuming from the outside, it's actually quite nice (in Chinese restaurant terms) and a decent, but not huge in size.  We got there after 11:30 and there were only a few tables filled; this changed within the next 15 minutes.\n\nTop picks: Ha gaw (shrimp dumpling), steamed cha siu bao (bbq pork bun), scallop dumpling, ha cheung (shrimp rice noodle roll).  Good amount of shrimp in the shrimp dishes and the rice noodle wrappers were the right consistency.  I usually don't go for scallop dumplings, but enjoyed theirs.\n\nThe OK: Dan tat (egg custard) & potstickers.  These were all fine and standard, but nothing to write home about.  The egg custards are not served with the little wrappers and are on the smaller side, but still moist and buttery enough.  \n\nSkip: The siu mai was weird, as the roe just didn't taste right and there was too much of it.  I usually love pan fried shrimp and chive dumpling everywhere I go, but their's was super greasy, mushy, and not browned enough.  \n\nService was fine and the restaurant was clean.  I'll admit, part of me still likes Yank Sing more, as in taste wise and  quality wise it's a little higher up there, but I can't justifying their high prices, unless it's a treat.  My lunch here was only $37 pre-tip (no tea), this at Yank Sing would be definitely over $50 for sure.  3.5 stars for City View.  If only I was closer to Chinatown so I can just get dim sum to go.  But when I have time and the dim sum craving hits, I'll be back with a coworker or friend to get my fix at City View.", "author": "Cat C."}

The skins on the har gow and cilantro dumplings were quite thick and not as translucent and delicate as other places I have been too. The cheong fan (rolled rice noodles with shrimp) was my favorite dish. The noodles had a nice bite to them. The bill was reasonable for dim sum, about $20 each.

The roast pig they ordered and served was fresh, moist and was from good quality vendor. \n\nI would recommend City View for a private party and definitely if you are looking for a place to hold a Red Egg and Ginger party, they will do a great job.

The servings seemed kind of small here, the food looked kind of sad, and the taste was very underwhelming.  I also went at 2:00, so they were out of a lot of the stuff I wanted.\n\nWhat was ordered:\n\nTurnip Cake - this was ok, but hard to mess up\nSiu Mai - I've definitely had better\nHar Gau - not very much flavor, shrimp was fresh at least\nShrimp Cheung Fun - even this dish was kind of off... not even sure what it was...\nMushroom dumplings- just wasn't a fan, the mushrooms weren't very good\nHoney Walnut Shrimp - biggest disappointment for me since I love honey walnut shrimp.  this was just shrimp with a little bit of the honey mayo sauce on it (and I mean barely any sauce...).  It was fried, but there was barely any batter.  It also had a little bit of lemon on it, i like lemon, but it made it taste more like shrimp scampi and not honey walnut shrimp. \n\nThis came out to $40, it was $44 before we reminded them that we did not drink tea.

IT WAS SOOO DIFFICULT to find one which really surprises me. We finally stumbled upon this place and we got excited. However, it was a little too clean for my liking....Usually the good dim sum places are not pretty or clean inside so I thought this must be super Americanized or expensive. It was both.\n\nWe were so hungry so first thing we saw we just got. It was three pieces of siu mai for like $5. We were laughing our asses off because it was soo damn expensive for dim sum. If we were gonna feed ourselves at this rate, our bill would be easily over $100. We looked at the menu and the prices are RIDICULOUS. The food is average too so its not like we were paying for quality. My crazy friend yolod and got one of the cabbage leafs with the meat and it was about $6. I thought that was the price for four pieces, but nope it was just for one. We literally took a bite and passed it on and laughed our heads off over this whole experience. Our desperate search for dim sum culminated to eating three siu mai and one lettuce wrap for $16 somehow. We immediately left the place and found cheap, to go dim sum.\n\nThe only thing I liked about this place was that it was such a fun/funny experience with my friends. haha that lettuce wrap moment was total bonding time.\n\n**TIPS**\n1) Too expensive for dim sum.\n2) Get dim sum to go for cheaper, more delicious dim sum.", "author": "Amy H."}

I've\nbeen hampering to return due to rave reviews of their xiao long bao,\nbut I've been on the search for a better SF place to recommend for\nsome time.\n\nEnter City View.  Located in the heart of Chinatown on a side street\nclose to R&G Lounge, City View is a place you wouldn't find easily\nunless you knew where to look.   But it seems the crowds do know this place and on an early weekend lunch, we were told that every one of the large banquet tables had been pre-booked. Luckily, my friend was one of the pre-bookers.\n\nIt was actually my second visit and while I enjoyed my first, I came\naway more impressed this second time.  Not only did we order a greater array of dishes, but we actually arrived at a prime time just before they really got going.  A sample of our fare:\n\nPan fried chive and shrimp dumpling - nicely fried and with a warm and tender filling.  They do this well and the dumpling sizes are large\nand generous\n\nPeking Duck - I've seen this at a handful of dim sum places, yet\nagain, here it was better executed.  The duck skin was very recently\nskinned (vs. sitting on a table/cart for hours) and the buns were warm\nand soft.\n\nEgg rolls - while the traditional Chinese egg rolls contain lots of\nvegetable and a thick fried skin, the version here is more modern.\nLong and thin, it's mainly shrimp and was hot and\ncrispy as if just fried.\n\nXiao Long Bao - those these were a hit with our table, I found them to\nbe average.  The skin was thin but each dumpling had no soup.  They do serve them in tin individual containers, but that's also useful if you\nare worried about breaking the skin.  If there's no soup, why worry?\n\nShrimp Rice Noodle Rolls - our first entree. Standard. Nice amount of\nshrimp but could have been hotter.\n\nCalamari - hot, crispy, and freshly fried\n\nOverall, we had a good dim sum meal and especially enjoyed the selection.  It's hard to gauge the price of a place when dining with a large group, but I'd guess that City View is moderate.  Not as cheap as the bargain places in SF, but a more solid value than Yank Sing.\n\nIt's definitely made my recommended list.  Way better than the tourist\nTon Kiang, more value than Yank Sing, and a quality replacement for\nHarbor Village that I used to recommend until it closed.\n\nCity View accepts credit cards, including American Express.", "author": "Randy F."}

When friends ask if they should bring out-of-towners there because it's \"clean\", I always resoundingly disagree. It's way over-priced and too sanitized an experience. City View is way better value for the same quality of food but you still get the hustle and bustle of an early afternoon dim sum weekend brunch in a comfortable setting. \n\nI like the har gow and siu mais here. They are generous with the filling and the skin is never too thick. Overall pretty well executed dumplings. The peking duck is succulent here with the steamed bun, scallion, and hoisin sauce. Yummy. Pan fried turnip cake is another go-to order item and it's well-excuted here. Other deep-fried seafood treats are worth ordering here. I mean, it's freshly deep fried. C'mon...what's there to think about?\n\nWeekday lunchtime crowds come in waves right around noon so my advice is to get here a little before that to grab a table.

This is a large space, waited less than 10 mins to seat us 5. The place is also very clean and they bring the dim sum in carts or carry the special items in a round tray. We ordered 17 items and it came out to $25 per person including tip. It's pretty pricey but 6 of the items were special items and about 7 of those were large items. Everything tasted really fresh. They XLB is yummy. Would come back again. By the way, you don't get an actual city view when you dine in, maybe a view of the street.", "author": "Vinkin Ken T."}

Luckily, our party of 12 had reservations and we were seated immediately.  \n\nBefore I start, let me explain what dim sum is.  I usually like to call it Chinese tapas.  It's a bunch of small \"snack-like\" dishes that make up a meal.  It ranges from pastries and tarts to meat-filled dumplings and buns.  It's not really for vegetarians because Chinese cuisine usually has lots of meat - primarily pork and shrimp (shumai, ha gao, etc).  \n\nThere are two types of dim sum places.  \n(1) People walk around with carts with the dim sum and ask what you'd like.\n(2) You get a menu with all the dim sum varieties and you \"check\" what you'd like to order.\n\nThis place falls under the first category.  The ladies walking around with the dim sum can get kind of impatient.  I usually prefer the latter option because I just feel very rushed when people are constantly walking by me and asking if I'd like x, y, or z.\n\nThe dim sum is decent, but a little bit on the oilier side.  Prices were kind of high too.. We ended up paying around $22 a person...With 12 people.... hmm... I have a family of 16.. and I don't ever recall it being that expensive.   \n\nEhh.. Chinatown dim sum... so overrated.  It's totally a tourist trap or a FiDi professionals trap.", "author": "Cecilia S."}

One thing I didn't like was that the shrimp dumpling wrap are much thicker than what I'm use to, I noticed that with many of their other dumplings as well.

The portions are small enough that you can share with friends to get a taste of everything and leave feeling very satisfied.

I come here with coworkers when we want to satisfy our dim sum cravings. \n\nThis place caters to the FiDi professional crowd and it's evident by the medium to large groups that I often see here right around noon. For this reason, it packs here so I don't advise coming at 12-12:30pm. Either come earlier around 11:45am, or take a late lunch and come after 1pm (which I do). I usually come around 1:30pm and crowding is never an issue.\n\nAs for the food, City View serves most dishes by pushing cart that dim sum ladies push throughout the restaurant. Their dim sum is good. Not superior to the likings of Hong Kong Lounge, Yank Sing, or even Ton Kiang (which IMO isn't all that). But, for the FiDi, it's good, dependable, reasonably priced and fills an empty tummy. \n\nI usually come here once a month and get the beef or shrimp noodle roll, spare ribs, stuffed eggplant, deep fried taro dumplings, har gow here.

City View, with its tableclothes and location between Chinatown and the financial district, seems to straddle that line.  There are Chinese people in there, and it is certainly difficult for a gringo like me to communicate with the staff, but there are also other cultural (and probably geographical) tourists frequenting the establishment.  The non-Chinese can certainly feel comfortable here.\n\nThat being the case, the actual dim sum seems to straddle that line as well.  Most of what they brought by our table was fairly tame... Didn't see any weird stuff like chicken feet, durien gelatin, tripe, etc.  It was, when you really evaluate it, typical dim sum.  It was good, but I don't feel like I had to go all the way over to Chinatown in San Francisco in order to get dim sum this good.\n\nIf you haven't had dim sum, this would probably be an excellent place to try it out.  It's not intimidating, it's clean, and it has a nice ambiance.  I have no doubt, however, that there are much better dim sum places to be found if you know Chinese and you know whom to ask.  And at $45 for a light lunch for three people, I'm sure there are much cheaper places, too.\n\nIf you go, however, get the calamari.  It might be the best calamari I've had.", "author": "Jeremy P."}

The dim sums were very good to excellent as others commented.  I'll only add two points to show that these owners operate outside the box.\n\nFirst they open only between 10 am and 2:30 pm, unbelievable in a high rent city even if they are on a side street just off Grant.  Additionally the immaculate white covered tables are all given plenty of space, not at all crowded.  Definitely pleasing visually as well as being comfortable.  \n\nSecond, the service method is improved.  The server pushing the cart or showing the food without the cart can talk with the kitchen on her microphone to relay what a customer wants.  If they can do it, someone comes shortly to show the dish.  For example we always ask for a green veggie which is never on a dim sum cart.  It is always a special order which comes much later.  Here she asked the kitchen what they had,  gai lan (Chinese broccoli).  I was happy with that and someone brought two small plates later.  We took one and the next table took the other as soon as they saw it.  This turned the special order into a ready order sale.  They don't do that for everything.  But beautifully cooked green veggies are sure winners.\n\nCity View may set a new trend in that little area between Chinatown and the financial area.

And this place, from the outset, seemed sketchy because there was not a grandpa or grandma to be found, inside our outside the place.\n\nEvery month I organize a dim sum outing and it has usually been at Hong Kong Lounge in the Richmond. Owing to the fact that many people have to trek out there from the East Bay, we decided to mix it up and see if there was anything better than Gold Mountain in Chinatown. So we ended up at City View.\n\nAs mentioned above, the first warning was that at 10:30, the place was fairly empty. Most Chinese families arrive at around 10 or so (the Christian ones, who bring the largest parties, go to church early and then cruise in for dim sum immediately after.)\n\nThe second warning is that of those people who had arrived early, not a single one was Chinese (or even non-white.) Well, anyway, we were firm on trying a new place, so we went in anyway. Our party of 9 had half of the restaurant to itself when we seated ourselves at around 10:40.\n\nThe third warning was that we got forks and water by default, but this could have been a function of the whiteness of our party (quite high.)\n\nDespite this, we were actually pleasantly surprised with the food. As others have said, they have all the staples. An interesting thing compared to other places is that the food here is not as overtly greasy as other dim sum places (usually, the cheaper, the greasier, but even the tasty places do have a significant grease factor.)\n\nStandouts are the 'fancy' siu mai with shrimp that only come 3 to a steamer instead of the all-pork ones that come with 4, and the 'char siew soh' (sweet baked pork pastry with sesame seeds.) They also have a large variety of steamed dumplings (some of which appear to be very expensive, but you won't really know until they stamp your card. Good luck asking the lady how much it is beforehand.)\n\nOdd ones out include the xiao long bao (warning: expensive) which inexplicably come in foil cups. Our suspicion is that the goal is to assist people who puncture the soupy dumplings on the way to their plate, losing all the soup on the way. However, this backfires, because the dumpling sticks to the foil cup too! What's more they are nothing to write home about anyway. The skin is thin and not very stretchy, a far cry from the springy elasticity you can get at Kingdom of Dumpling.\n\nBut generally, we were satisfied. The only wildcard when we finished was the price. We expected it to be more expensive than most places because of the attentive service but by how much, we did not know. Additionally, you usually have a hint: dim sum bill cards usually have sections for \"Small\", \"Medium\", or \"Large\" dishes, and the price for these common sizes is printed next to the grid. Here, it was not, and menacingly enough, we had ordered many 'Special' dishes, which are more expensive than 'Large'.\n\nThe bill came out to slightly more than $180 after tax and tip for our party of 9. That is a bit expensive and as such this restaurant has not made it into our final restaurant rotation - it's still Gold Mountain and Hong Kong Lounge.\n\nIt's too bad, though, because it wins on many fronts, including proximity, cleanliness, and the fact that they actually use carts instead of taking your order. But that comes at a price, one that many in our dim sum group are not willing to pay. However, if you are accustomed to the opulence of Yank Sing, you will find City View to be a bargain with a similar level of service and presentation.", "author": "Josh K."}

Their spareribs had a bit of a strange taste to it and the egg tarts were just okay, which were my only complaints.\n\nYou'll end up spending around $20/person if you get a decent amount of plates on the table - sort of pricey - but you'll be a happy camper afterwards.", "author": "Jasmine A."}

The food is better than eating at some Togo dim sum places. Service is ok, although some people just don't speak proper English which makes it hard to understand what type of food they brought to u.\nI am giving this place 3 stars for the way they trick people. They never disclose prices when they pass by your table with amazingly looking food. You get one here, two there and before you know you are full, your bill comes up to something that you would never expect from a Chinese place. I went there with my coworker and we didn't order any alcoholic drinks, and I would say we ate a good portion of food for lunch. But we didn't go crazy and ordered everything and anything. So the bill came over $80 for 2... I'm not sure how other people feel about spending around $50 ( incl tips) for just a lunch, but I felt terrible. If I knew that 3 little pieces of dumplings cost over $7, I would probably think twice before going to that place. Common, other places have the same dumplings for 5 times cheaper...especially being close to Chinatown I would totally be sensitive to prices. It's not cool to hide prices is all I can say.", "author": "Aya J."}

So two stars.  \n\nLocated on the total outskirts of Chinatown, it feels like City View is banking on the fact that it is located close enough to Chinatown and still serves food cart-style to lure people into thinking their food is legit.  Well, it's not.  They only serve the stereotypical dim sum that everyone and their mothers are familiar with.  Portions are small.  The dim sum are poorly made.  And they don't list the prices or indicate which items are small, medium, or large-sized.\n\nI just so happened to come here because of a work luncheon.  And once we were ready to order food, the ladies pushing the carts assumed that we wanted most of the things they had and started piling food on our table.  Oh hell no.  Do not try to pull that one on me.  And so we forced her to take back the unwanted items.  \n\nIf you notice, there are no Chinese grandma and grandpas reading their newspapers here while sipping their cup of tea.

City View is tucked away in the center between two streets and you can hit it only on one side of the main street on Kearny.

You can order as well, but this is more of the quick pop and go type dim sum.\n\nVariety is definitely the case here as there are plenty of options.  The barbeque pork bun is steamed just right, the shrimp dumplings are tasty, the glazed pork bun is not that great, the chicken feet is what you would expect, skinny shrimp egg rolls are quite tasty, turnip cake was the best I had that I could remember, and the steam pork dumplings are solid but nothing extraordinary.

So, for your tourists, family member, VIPs, people who don't know dim sum (it's not as threatening; feels like an upscale place), it's the right place. Then there are a bunch of good places such as Hong Kong Flower Lounge (by SFO); Koi Palace (Daly City); Hong Kong Lounge (which used to to be the HK Flower Lounge two decades ago); and Ton Kiang. Those all are slightly better than City View.\n\nSo you might wonder: why City View? Well, they take reservations, which is not a small thing; they don't have a long wait; they are conveniently located for people coming from various places. And they are perfectly fine. Not great. But acceptable.\n\nThere is something to be said for reliability.", "author": "Frank W."}

No, they don't come around with the carts that people seem to love you so much but they do at City View.  So if that's your thing, great.  Aside from the carts, I can't really say much more positive about City View.  I guess I can comment on its cleanliness.  It seems clean and nice looking.  \n\nBut for dim sum?  Just not good.  \n\nThe reason I tried City View is, despite my addictive love affair with Great Eastern, I am always on the look out for another Dim Sum place.  I'm always willing to expand my dim sum selection.  A friend actually suggested this place to me and had the nerve to say it was on par if not better than Great Eastern. \n\nHe is no longer my friend.  \n\nAt least he's not a friend I can trust when it comes to asian cuisine. Every dish that came out was consistently disappointing.  I had convinced two other friends to come with me (two other dim sum fanatics) and they consistently complained about the quality of the dumplings we were receiving.  \n\nIn the end, I only felt the pot stickers and the leek dumplings were any sort of decent.  Everything else we ordered was bland or worse.  \n\nThere's a bunch of dim sum places in the city.  You can skip this one.", "author": "Joe M."}

That was the feeling my fiance and I had on our trip to San Francisco last November.\n\nAfter much deliberation (we originally had a reservation for brunch at the Garden Court in the Palace Hotel), we came to our senses and realized that a) we are not brunch people, b) we could never eat enough food to make up for the cost, and c) it's Thanksgiving and we can do whatever we want - let's eat our favorite food!\n\nSo began our walk to City View Restaurant.  We were staying at the Omni in the Financial District and our hotel was literally a two minute walk away.  It was wonderful.  San Francisco is JUST SO COOL.  I absolutely adore city life - and miss New York for that reason.  Being able to walk to dim sum was soo awesome, and the weather, although chilly, was comfortable.  City View is located along a side street - when you look ahead of you - you see a steep hill leading up to Chinatown.  Luckily - it's at the bottom of the hill so you don't have to do much climbing.\n\nI had made a reservation for 12:30PM, but really didn't need it.  I assumed that it was because it was a holiday and the financial district pretty much shut down, so their usual business lunchers weren't there.  Just other Asian families, having a nice Thanksgiving brunch - Chinese style! :)\n\nMy fiance and I were seated promptly - the restaurant is rather big, bigger than I expected.  Everything was clean, which was a huge change for me since I'm used to Chinatown style dim sum.  The servers were friendlier than the norm (meaning they didn't yell at you in Chinese and throw your plates and silverware at you),  and the carts kept coming.  I will say I was a little concerned because at first the carts were slow.  But they picked up and before we knew it we had a full table of dishes!\n\nThe beef flat rice noodles are always my favorite.  We also had the steamed rice in lotus leaf and all the shumai you could imagine.  We ordered hot tea, and tried almost everything we could, including the xiao long bao.  Everything was fantastic and we were soo happy with our decision.  We spent soo much less than if we had gone to brunch (our entire bill with tip was about $60).  Maybe we were just scared into thinking San Francisco would be super expensive but we were quite content with that cost.  \n\nAll in all - a truly wonderful experience at City View, the restaurant made our Turkey Day extra special.  No matter what city we are in, Dim Sum on Thanksgiving may become an annual tradition!", "author": "Kristy K."}

This is a really fun experience when dining with family, especially kids, or friends from out of town (ie, tourists), or just with local friends.\n\nCity View is a great value for the quality and portions of the food. Coming here in a group and ordering many different dishes, it still comes out to about $15 per person for lunch, which is only a dollar or two more than a lot of the sandwich places downtown.\n\nMy favorite dishes are the taro root, pot stickers, sesame chicken (a big hit with everyone who's tried it, spicy and sweet. A great dish if you're dining with picky children, or those new to dim sum), bbq pork buns, spring rolls, and the rolled noodle garlic thingies (that's the right name for them, right?). I love the egg custard, but the last two times I've visited they've been sold out. My family loves the shrimp hargow, it's their favorite dish here.\n\nThe carts seem to come around fairly often, and the food has always been fresh and hot. I like that if you don't see something you are looking for you can ask the waiter for it, or order from the menu.\n\nThe parking on the street can be tricky mid-day, and lots of the spots on Kearny are tow-away after 3 p.m.. Your best bet may be to park at the Hyatt down the street (Or, of course, take public transit). Portsmouth Square also has parking, but I'll never park there again after denting a fender on their impossibly tight turns down the ramps. Also, if you or your guests are disabled, the restaurant is located down a closed-off alley, so dropping off someone in front of the restaurant isn't an option, and the restrooms are located down a long staircase.", "author": "Umilia M."}

Even the \"small\" dishes are $3.50 each...growing up in Toronto, Canada where most dim sum restaurant price their small dish @ about $2 each, we found it expensive!  We have to admit the trade off was that it was less than 3 blocks walk from our hotel @ Le Meridien, where we had left our car there, so we saved on the parking plus, it appears as though sit-down dim sum is not as accessible in California, so we were happy to have found one close by.  Our total bill was $80 for 4 adults, before tip...\nThe 3-star rating is totally based on the price.  Will admit, by the time we left @ about noon, the restaurant was packed with about 30 + ppl waiting in and outside the restaurant...everyone here must be rich as I won't be able to afford such dim sum prices on a regular basis...hope I'll find somewhere for reasonably priced for our next visit to SF.", "author": "Amy R."}

I should have figured with a name like that that the offerings weren't going to be as good in value in comparison to the other dim sum places nearby. \n\nSure, the environment may be somewhat comforting to non-Chinese/ABCs since most of the customers are not Chinese here, but to me, that just means that the prices are going to be more expensive and that the food isn't going to be nearly as authentic. Yes, so their sign outside says \"Dim Sum and Cantonese cuisine\". And yes, some of the food was authentic. They seemed to serve too many dumplings though and not enough buns/chicken feet/et. al.\n\nI was also disappointed with the size of the dishes: tiny tiny egg custards for how much?! I've seen larger custards for less money. When I think about dim sum, I think of it as being filling, not as something dainty. I also just didn't like the environment so much, nor did I like the price tag. \n\nThe service was fine, I suppose...the carts came around often enough. Another plus is that they do accept credit cards, as opposed to most places in Chinatown. The place is also cleaner in terms of dining room/restrooms. \n\nHowever....next time I'm in the area, I'll be going elsewhere for better and cheaper dim sum.\n\nP.S.

Perhaps this influenced what we thought of the meal but what attracted us to this place was that it was \"clean\" and the food \"good.\"  It pretty much lived up to those reviews, and after about 8 dishes, we payed about $40 for 2.  The most expensive was the walnut shrimp, which was $8 --pretty pricey considering it's a dim sum portion.  It's all good though, we're on vacation!!  I should also mention the service was decent too.\n\nThanks to our little one for being zonked out and letting us have a quiet lunch to ourselves, and to Yelpers for pointing us to a delicious meal that hit the spot!!", "author": "Leni A."}

I have been to Yang Sink, which I like, but this is much closer to where I live.  \nOut of the times I have been here, more often than not I have been happy with the food and service.  The few times I have been disappointed was when I came right after they opened to beat the rush.  Most of the food was not yet ready and the servers were definitely trying to push some broccoli and high tickets items like Duck down our throat.  \nThere is normally a wait on the weekends, 15-20 minutes, and this place really needs to get a better system to take names.  \"The lady in the pink shirt\" is not my ideal way to sign in.  \nOverall the food is good, not as good as Yang Sink, but you are definitely going to pay less.", "author": "Devin C."}

Maybe they don't really appreciate good food?  Do they know what they are talking about?  Well, today I'm joining the club and it's all clear.\n\nSo yes, I came here today for lunch on a recommendation of a coworker (but of course I checked it out on Yelp as well).  And I truly do not understand the reviews of this place.  I've been to my fair share of dim sum places all over the world and although I wouldn't say this place was the worst I've ever had (that goes to the premade boxed dimsum from Trader Joe's), it certainly ranks close to the bottom of the list.  It's not even so ordinary and bland as to be forgettable.  It's just distinctly bad.\n\nAll the food came out lukewarm.  All the steamed dumpling wrappers were thick and chewy instead of being thin and almost transparent.  You could barely pull them off the paper at the bottom of the steamer.  Everything looked old (not made recently) and sloppily made at that.  \n\nIt was $14 for lunch and I felt like it was a complete waste of money.\n\nIf you don't want to go to a hole in the wall restaurant, then go to Yank Sing instead.  You may notice that Yank Sing is actually frequented by entire Chinese families. And please don't spread the rumor that this is the best dim sum in the city to others, you will give SF a bad name.", "author": "Jean K."}

There were new things coming out all the time and the only problem I had with it was that it was still coming out as I was full and waiting for my check. Before we all left the restaurant we were already conspiring what to get next time! \n\nThe chicken lettuce wraps were to die for!!\n\nOverall, this was a deliciously wonderful experience and I can't wait to go again.

A lot of the people working here didn't speak too much English and so I was able to get an ounce of customer service by using my scarcely used Mandarin.

When we were finally seated, I really liked the fact that it was like a traditional Hong Kong dim sum place where people that speak very little English walk around in carts hawking their food (+ points for keeping it tradish). However, it was a pain in the butt to decipher what they were charging for each \"level\" of plate and seeing that a lot of us were white, the more expensive carts came around over and over again. Hey, at least try to keep it a bit more classy (and less obvious), thank you very much!\n\nThe food was good, although I have to say, it was a bit on the skimpy side.

Upon our arrival, I noticed that the restaurant was more upscale than the typical, impersonal dim sum palace I was used to in Manhattan's Chinatown.  The spot was also full of Asian clientele, which we took as a positive sign.  \n\nEach cart that passed us displayed authentic dishes that were handsomely presented with bold colors and crisp freshness.  The BBQ Pork Bun possessed a sweet dough that was stuffed with tender pork in a savory marinade.  The Pan-Fired Potstickers were enjoyable, but nothing memorable.  Toasted Sesame Balls were filled with a sweet filling that packed the distinctive flavor of the seeds.\nThe shrimp dumplings were composed of large tender noodle balls encasing massive chunks of crisp shrimp.  Sticky rice noodles were also tastefully wrapped around tender shrimp and covered in a pool of soy sauce.  A delicious plate of egg-shaped fried taro domes were completed with a sweet custard filling of the same root vegetable.  Large prawns were served in a sweet mayonnaise and tossed with caramelized walnuts.  Lastly, we had fun composing crisp iceberg lettuce wraps stuffed with tender cubes of chicken, water chestnuts, and peanuts.\n\nThe City View Restaurant offered the most polished and flavorful dim sum experience of my foodie life.  I only wish it was located in New York!", "author": "Alison C."}

I love that they actually have cart service, the restaurant has lots of nice natural light, the staff are friendly and speak a reasonable amount of English, and the price is right! Some tasty items include:\n\n-Shrimp har gow (spelling? forgive me, I speak not Chinese)\n-Fried shrimp and chive dumplings - OMG sooooooooo good\n-Shrimp rice noodle\n-Shrimp and cilantro dumplings\n(I don't eat land animals so I cannot vouch for their pork dishes...)\n\nI also really want to try the eggplant/tofu dish - it looks quite large but I think I am going to conquer it when I go there tomorrow for my dim sum fix.

She says she likes it because it's very clean, the dim sum is just bite size and they have great daan-taats (custard tarts) and \"things that look like cupcakes filled with a really nice cream.\" She could not tell me what they are called in English or Cantonese...turns out she means laaih-wohng-baau (steam custard filled buns).\n\nWe passed on the daan-taats and went for the laaih-wohng-baau, which were definitely top notch.  The siu mai had a nice flavor, and were more of a bite size. The special dim sum we tried was one lovely, delicate chicken filled dumpling in a clear, light broth.  Their sticky rice chicken wrapped in banana leaves is yummy as well. And the wu-tau-so (ground taro fried in a whisker-like pastry) was wonderful - they were big, but the taro was mixed so that it was lighter than other wu-tau-so we've had.\n\nI can see why this place appeals to a non-Chinese crowd. I joked with my husband that this is the most white people I'd ever seen in a dim sum restaurant! When we first sat down, the most noise we heard was chopsticks clanging on plates.  My Chinese friends would have found that environment to be lacking \"yeet lau\" - noise and excitement.\n\nThe staff seem accustomed to working with non-Chinese patrons. They explained items in English as they carried trays and pushed carts around the room. So this would be a great place for dim sum newbies to go to.\n\nIt is a little pricey, but worth it. Very good service and quality food.", "author": "Lisa R."}

That was hard to find as most of the dim sum places either bring out a menu that you check off or maybe bring food items out on trays.  I called a few friends and wanted someplace moderately priced with the push carts.  They recommended City View and emphasized the validated parking at Portsmouth Square.\n\nIt is off the beaten path on Commercial Street on the edge of Chinatown and the Financial District.  It opened at 11:00 AM and our party of six arrived just at opening.  There was one or two other parties there and we were able to get a nice table.  The place was clean and reminded me of some of the nicer restaurants in Hong Kong.  Even the restrooms were clean.  Of course I would expect that early in the AM.\n\nTrue to form, the rolling carts came and we had our fill. Our table was somewhat in the middle and the push carts came by and turnaround there so we had plenty of gander time.   The service was friendly and excellent.  The servers constantly filled our tea and water.  We had a variety of dim sum and it is always nice to look at what you are ordering and ask the attendants about the items. I can't remember exactly what we ordered, but it was the standard pork buns, shrimp balls, pork siu mai, vegetables, etc.  For those unaccustomed to eating dim sum, it is nice to see what you are ordering.  When we ordered, they would check off a slip that was on our table.  Most of the items were excellent. We really did not know the price of each individual plate, but I had an inkling it was going to be expensive based on previous reviews.\n\nThe restaurant (even though it was comparatively large) quickly filled up and people were awaiting outside before noon.  Most of the diners appear to be business people and tourists and there weren't that many locals.  There is also dining in the lower level, but it wasn't open during our Thursday visit.  Maybe it is open during the weekends.\n\nWhen we got our bill, it was $120 or an average of $20 per person.  Of course, we had big eaters at our table.  I wouldn't say this is a moderately priced restaurant.  I would classify it on the expensive side, particularly for lunch.\n\nWe had free parking due to the validation and I think they are only open for lunch.  My advise is to come early. This is a great place to take out-of-town guests, but I am still looking for where the locals eat.  When we go to Chinatown, we usually get to-go food at Yong Kee.  If anyone has recommendations, I'd sure like to hear from them.", "author": "Robert J."}

But if you're hoping to try some of the best dim sum in San Francisco, hustle on down.\n\nCity View is crowded almost any day (and any time of day), especially on Sundays, but tables open up quickly (mostly because you'll get chased out once you stop picking food from the carts) and it's a fun way to have lunch.  I love the variety of food that comes around: steamed, fried, boiled dumplings with pork, chicken, or shrimp.  The steamed pork buns are fluffy, moist, and particularly delicious - probably the best bao I've had.  I also can't get enough of the fried pork dumplings, with their crispy sweet shells.  I don't understand the names of everything I eat, but it's all wonderful.\n\nHowever, they are running a money operating business.  While the dishes range from $3-$6, the little plates can add up fast if you're not paying attention.  Also, I've noticed the hostess and waiters hurry you along towards the end of the meal.  On one visit in particular, we asked for some Chinese doughnuts, only to be told that there weren't any.  As we were paying the bill, several trays of the doughnuts walked by.  It was obvious the hostess wanted us to scoot and didn't want us to wait for the next batch to come out.\n\nI always chalk the lack of service up to a cultural experience - something to joke about as we enjoy the delicious food!", "author": "Kristin M."}

Yes, more expensive than typical dim sum, but the decor is a lot fancier, and the staff are relatively nicer than the other places in Chinatown. Anything deep-fried is gonna be really good: mild taro puff piled high like a top hat, juicy crab/shrimp claw, the calamari that I had to beg four waiters to find was to die for, and the scallion pancake is crispy and salty and is complimented by the hot chili sauce perfectly. The shrimp in rice noodle roll is lacking, like some other users have said. The usual shrimp dumpling, mushroom dumpling, chives and shrimp dumpling, and soup dumpling were average. I don't care for soup dumplings at all. And basically my only criteria for dumplings at this point is that they don't fall apart when I peel it off the steamer, which has been a constant for me at New Asia. The fish cake in eggplant is interesting and tasty, but oily. The chicken kebab is good also but you can get those for a dollar a stick on Stockton Street. My only regret is not having ordered the crispy seafood noodle dish. Not sure if they charge for tea, but that seems to be the norm today and complaining won't change it. One complaint is that the egg tarts are super small and they are the price of a small dish when there are only 3? The middle jiggles pleasantly but there's no eggy flavor about it. But what my non-Asian MIL wants (and does not understand about Chinatown), my MIL gets. Overall, ten dishes added up to be about $65, and this fed 3 people to the brim.", "author": "Rachel H."}

Expect long lunch lines at 12:00-12:30.  It dies down a little by 1:00, but it still busy.  My favorite is the fried chicken and the pot stickers.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10, I give Yank Sing a 9.5 and I give City View a 7.

Its only open till 2:30 PM so our party was really lucky when we walked in at 2:15 which is a great time to come because the lines are shorter.

My wife remarked that she could tell by the way people were dressed, that it was a bit more upscale than the normal dim sum places we tend to frequent.  I really enjoyed their dumplings with chives and the shu mai.  And as Yosie G. mentioned in a review a few years ago, they really do use real crab claw in their crab claw dumplings--a real nice touch, I think.  My son declared that their char siu bau was the best he ever had anywhere (even better than Sportful Garden in Hong Kong).  And he ate THREE of them, so he must have really liked them.  I'm not a huge fan of char siu bau, but I did notice there were no hard bits of fat in these that I have encountered in other restaurants.  We had jasmine tea, and it was a pretty good quality brew.  All the tables were taken upstairs, and there was a downstairs too (where the restrooms are), but those tables were not being used.  Perhaps they are used when dinner is served.

I've been here many times for lunch during the weekday and have always been satisfied. I also think it's a value compared to Yank Sing because quite a few of their dim sum are about as tasty, if not more tasty, than Yank Sing, but for cheaper.  When my friend and I come here our tab averages about $40, but we tend to order quite a bit.\n\nMy friend and I were there on Monday and our tab was $42.  We were a little surprised that it came out that high since we thought we ordered less than usual, but this is what it got us if I remember everything: Fung chau (chicken feet), shrimp har gow, 2 shrimp siu mai, pork siu mai, shanghai dumpling, turnip cake, crab claw, pan fried chive and shrimp dumpling.\n\nWe think the fung chau is pretty great here and usually order 3 or 4, but this time opted for just 1. The flavor is savory and texture just right. It's not mushy soft or really hard.\n\nShrimp har gow is usually done well provided that you let it cool a bit before eating it otherwise the skin will still be pretty soft and you run the risk of your dumpling just falling apart.\n\nSiu mai is pretty standard; not really better than anywhere else, but definitely not bad.\n\nI don't know why I continue to order Shanghai dumpling here. When I first came here I remember them being half way decent, but now they're pretty lame. You get 4 dumplings that come in little aluminum pans (picture mini pie pans). Almost every single time I try to get them out of those pans, no matter how careful I am, the damn dumpling rips open and the soup pours out. Lucky me the soup goes into the pan and I can just sip it from there, but there isn't even much soup in the dumpling since it's mostly filled with meat. On top of that, they give you red vinegar for dipping. For really good Shanghai dumplings I recommend Shanghai Dumpling Shop in Millbrae. (note to self: stop ordering those damn dumplings here).\n\nTurnip cake I don't usually order since it's so filling for me, but this past visit I was craving it and I was happy with it. Can't say much else about that.\n\nFried crab claw is usually my friend's thing, but I've had it a few times and it's pretty good. Exterior has a nice liitle crisp and filling has good chunks of shrimp and crab.\n\nThe pan fried chive and shrimp dumpling has a nice crust on the pan fried sides and the inside usually has good sized chunks of shrimp.\n\nWe've had some other seafood dumplings in the past, but we felt that they just weren't worth it. Those items seemed overpriced for what we got. A lot of times it didn't seem like our dumplings had much seafood.\nFor example, in the past if we were to replace a few item from the above list with say some scallop dumplings or \"seafood\" dumplings our tab would be roughly $60! Boo!\n\nAnyhow, they've got the best reasonably priced dim sum near my work (that I know of), otherwise I'd go to Inner Richmond for even cheaper, good dim sum.", "author": "Dennis Z."}

Other than that, most of the dumplings and other dishes were really quite greasy, and the 'tofu' dish I ordered to expand variety was not really just tofu but some kind of unidentified meat with a unexpectedly strange tasting sauce.\n\nThe servers and wait help seemed very busy, and no one stopped to offer us water or tea after we were seated until we asked.  \n\nI think this place would be all right if you know what you want and are familiar with the dishes being served.  Overall, I wasn't very impressed with my experience, especially after seeing that it cost over $60 for two people when I've had better for less.", "author": "Anne I."}

What I like about this place is that it's between Chinatown and the Financial District, so if one is persistent, one can find street parking, or just park in Portsmouth Square garage for 2 hours of validated parking. This isn't a place one would happen to pass by on the street. It's located on Commercial Alley between Kearny St. and Montgomery. \n\nThere's two levels to this restaurant: a street level and a sub-street level. On this Sunday, the street level of the restaurant was full, but the sub level was closed. Bathrooms and kitchen are on the sub level. \n\nIt's a very clean restaurant. Waiters are frequently cleaning tables, and clearing off empty plates off of tables. Layout of the tables are efficient, yet not a tight, crammed feeling. Enough room for the dim sum carts to pass out through without banging on a customer's elbow. \n\nDim sum carts frequently make their rounds around the restaurant, and the dim sum was still hot in their steamers. \n\nWe ordered a lot from the carts, and I can't remember everything what we had. The ha gow (shrimp dumplings), were pretty good, thin skinned, nice whole pieces of shrimp. Both the chicken and pork siu mai were also good, but I found the pork version to be much juicier than the chicken. \n\nWe were waiting the the xiao long bao to come out. But didn't see it. Spoke with the manager, and he said he'll bring some out for us when they're ready. Few minutes later, he came by with 2 steamers for each of our tables. They were OK. Skin was too thick, and slightly doughy. Soupy insides were already absorbed into the skin. \n\nMy father-in-law also preordered Peking duck and dry-fried beef chow fun. The duck was really juicy, and the skin had the perfect combination of crispiness on the outside, juicy moistness on the inside. Went well with the freshly-steamed buns. Beef chow fun was OK, but by then I was too full. \n\nThe owner gave us a complimentary plate of fried sesame balls and coconut buns, which were fresh made, and really good. \n\nVery good service, and a very accommodating manager/owner. This as well as the food has been pretty consistent over the years.", "author": "Steve L."}

There were a ton of people milling about in the entrance area, and it wasn't clear whether they were waiting to be seated or just confused about how to put their name in for a table. Once we got there, we just went up to the host desk, which is a little ways into the restaurant, and upon asking to have our name down for a table for two, were seated immediately.\n\nThat was the good part. After we were seated, though, we were basically ignored by any servers offering tea or water and it took asking one of the bussers for some tea before we got anything to drink.\n\nCarts come around frequently, but because the place was so busy, you're fairly rushed to decide whether or not you want to get a particular item. We ended up getting most of the standard dim sum fare, but nothing stood out. The dishes were a little greasier than I'd have liked.\n\nOf course, Dim Sum is such a subjective experience and it changes drastically with what dishes you end up getting. With that caveat, I was disappointed with what we ended up with at City View. The har gau was good, but the rest of what we got (sticky rice, sesame balls, siu mai) was very ordinary at best. One tofu dish we tried was particularly disappointing.\n\nIn the end, we spent around 60 dollars for two people, which was more than the experience was worth. I'd prefer to go somewhere cheaper and less hectic.\n\nAlso, there is no city view at City View. Don't be deceived.", "author": "Dan L."}

Good - moving on.\n\n Are you willing to experience new things - things which you might not be sure what they are, but there is a guarantee that they will be good? \nIf you answered no, stop reading now and head over to Mc. Donald's. \nIf you answered yes....Congratulations! You made it.\n\nThe reason I ask this is because in order to entirely enjoy yourself and indulge fully into the culinary juggernaut that is Dim Sum, you have to keep an open mind. You may be able to stay safe with your Chicken Teriyaki dish at sushi places, but not here my friend. Carts will fly by; the cart lady will open the lids to reveal the unknown little treasures. You may ask what they are if you so please, but the response will most likely be unintelligible. It's just you and the food, and if you're like me, you couldn't ask for anything more.\n\nNow that's out of the way, lets move on to the actual restaurant, which is the star of this show anyway. \nCity View is concealed away beside the main Chinatown drag. The green banner and flimsy sign exterior do nothing to foretell the beautiful interior waiting for you. Inside, the restaurant is friendly, spacious, clean, and most importantly, busy. The food is nothing short of spectacular as well. The thing I love about Dim Sum is that it pleases my impatience and my stomach's eagerness; for once you are seated you are bombarded with the food carts. It's hard to summarize all of the food I've ordered in one review, because each dish could fill up a page of nonsensical bliss-filled insanity, so I'm just going to again tell you that yes - the food is indeed good.\n\nThe only reason why I have to give this place 4 star instead of 5 is the variety. The food here is pretty authentic, but they bring out the \"safer\" food (buns, shrimp and x) too much. While you can order whatever you want from the staff, it would be nice if you didn't have to. The other Dim Sum places tend to have a greater selection and more interesting things. But with that said, the items I've had here taste far better than elsewhere. \n\nYou just can't do wrong at City View.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-04-06", "description": "4.5 stars... when is Yelp going to allow us to do half stars?  Just a thought.\n\nThe word dim sum conjures up bizarre thoughts like loud carts, hole in the wall or large dining halls of huge family gatherings and a lot of little kids, loud noises, fried foods, egg custard tarts (not a fan), sesame covered fried mochi with adzuki inside (very good by the way), egg rolls galore...  Boy I really needed to get over this mindset and after this weekend I officially have.  I think I was traumatized when I was very young and that is why it created such negative thoughts in my head... my experience in LA was a bit overwhelming for me too.   \n\nSo I was kind of skeptical of dim sum... and no I'm not Chinese (Vinny) so I don't know everything about dim sum... in fact I've only been to dim sum 8 times in my life and 6 of those were at Yang Sink and that doesn't count in my book.  A good friend got a group of us to brunch over some dim sum and I kid you not my friends in the city have the most amazing palates (they are either chefs or cook better than most chefs naturally).  I trust what they select and I eat everything and anything but I was just not up for the Chicken Feet this particular morning.  I did sample the sauce that it was cooked in and it was spectacular and I could see how even chicken's feet would taste good in it.\n\nMy apologies I'm horrible with the Chinese names of dim sum, well Chinese food in general.  Ordering Chow Han all these years it was funny to see how many times Chow Fun would be in the take out box (flat thick rice noodles instead of friend rice).  Is that right?  A little help please.\n\nMost Notable:\nThe pork buns (char sui?) not your typical ones in the fluffy chewy white dough (they had those too) but in a more tan pastry shell think Chinese Coconut Bread dough...?\n\nSesame Chicken ( of course with a dollop of the red chili paste on the table)\n\nThe usual Shrimp and Vegetables steamed and served in pot sticker form... can't go wrong.\n\nAnd my Tsing Tao: just what I needed after 20 hours of straight drinking the day before.\n\nGood:\nAlthough the shrimp was smaller in size than most Walnut Shrimp that I've had in the past, it tasted great.\n\nThe steamed shrimp stuffed small shiitake mushrooms looked like something I would be addicted too... think shumai filling spooning a shiitake cap.  It was okay but served cold, it would have been nice heated.\n\nFried Tofu or Age-san served with stuffed Eggplant and Peppers (again this shrimp shumai like filling) looked delicious but was slightly deceiving.  I usually love the spicy and sweetness in dishes like saut\u00e9ed Chinese Eggplant but I had a bite of one corner of the tofu.  It was good but not that sweet and spicy effect I was looking for.  And stuffing steamed shrimp fillers in too many dishes gets kind of old.\n\nI didn't try the regular egg rolls but I did try their skinnier version their cousin.  Shrimp fried cigars... of course love all the dipping sauce, sweet & sour, hot sauce, a dash of soy and some vinegar (yes on the same plate).\n\nThe custard filled pastry-like thing was amazing.  Custard buns anyone?  Again reminded of Coconut Bread something we always picked up in Chinatown while I was growing up on our way home from Jr. Tennis Tournaments in Nor Cal. Which I competed in almost every weekend in the summer from age 10 to 16.\n\nThe Chicken Lettuce cups, had pine nuts, nice twist but even after I made 2 mini cups with my little filling it was still too salty for my liking.\n\nNot So Much:\nThe sticky  rice in what looked to be a banana leaf but the chefs at the table said it wasn't.  I'm just not a fan of this rice that tends to take on the flavor of the leaf (which got our table in a heated brief discussion about grape leaves and Dolmas).  A bit too earthy and herbal for me... and awkward with the rice which tends to be sweet.  However, I did see a few sliced Chinese sausages hidden in there and I'm always game for a little sausage.  Heart Sausage!\n\nThe Chinese Broccoli  usually served parboiled and chilled with a sweet brown sauce.  I tend to love these more refreshing dishes but I was too stuffed and it came after our dessert (sweet dishes) and friends were telling me it was the greasiest plate that we had ordered all day.  Strange and not appetizing.\n\nI hear their pan saut\u00e9ed/fried noodle dish was good but we didn't see anyone carting that over to us during our visit, it's probably a special order item so next time I'll get that for sure.\n\nMy New Mindset - discovery, Chinese style tapas, sharing, Tsing Tao, clean atmosphere, friendly staff, cultural learning center, veggies (love the string beans at Yang Sink), \n\nSo 25 plus plates and a dozen Tsing Taos later (there were 8 in our party) our bill was $210 with tip.   AMAZING and so RECESSION FRIENDLY! This bill would have easily been over $350 without tip at Yank Sing which is almost teetering on becoming my now 2nd favorite place to dimsum and yes that is a verb.", "author": "Shiho F."}

The food was mediocre at best, and I know dim sum. I grew up in Los Angeles near all the great Chinese restaurants. I really wanted to compare dim sum in SF to that back home. Unfortunately, this place was a complete let down. It was obvious the food was not freshly cooked and selection was rather small.  I should have known immediately as I stepped in and saw that everyone else was a tourist, like me. I don't think anyone there was a local. What really pissed me off was the price, nearly $40 for 7dishes. We had har gow, siu Mai, chicken feet, rice rolls with beef, two orders of steamed BBQ pork buns, and a deep fried taro dish. I liked the BBQ buns and taro dish the most, the rest was just okay.  \nIf you are in town and in for some okay tasting dim sum and want to pay twice the price, come here!

This time around I tasted pork & ginger dumplings that really set the bar up another notch! When in season, the soft-shelled crab is excellent here!\n\nThe room is big & cavernous and the name of the place was not meant to be ironic, but it is.

You can't go wrong with the bean paste filled sesame balls, either.\n\nThough it was really crowded for lunch on a weekday, since there were only two of us we got seated pretty quick--no complaints about the service. \n\nCan't speak for all the veg / vegan options as the offerings always rotate, but as a vegan, I would come here again. If the idea of a little fish sauce in your food freaks you out, do your homework really thoroughly (or just avoid Chinese food in general).

I also had some of the most amazing dim sum ever and came back with a craving.  Lucky for me, City View is literally half a block from my office. \n\nIn Hong Kong, they call going to dim sum \"yum cha\" or literally \"drink tea.\"  It is not just about the food but the entire experience and while City View is not quite as good as the places I tried in HK, I have to say it is doing its part to put the YUM in yum cha here in The City.\n\nThe tea is good and helps digestion.  The food that comes around (many in bamboo steamers) is pretty much all delicious and if you will excuse my butchering gwailo phonetic rendering, here are some of my favorites.  \n\nChar siu bau - Steamed (or baked) sweet buns with roasted pork and onion filling.  Think I could live on these alone if I had to.  But I dont.  \n\nHar gau - delicate steamed shrimp dumplings in a translucent skin.\n\nShao mai - small steamed pork dumplings in a thin wrapper and topped with crab roe.\n\nCheong fun - wide rice noodles that are steamed and rolled with a variety of fillings such as shrimp and then sometimes fried and sprinkled with sesame seeds or sweet sauce.  \n\nThere are many more that I love and many that I have no idea what they are or what they are called yet taste amazing.  But these all-stars should get you started.\n\nAs for getting the turkey in Hong Kong my only advice is this.  Start at 7-11, then head for the most famous alley there and continue drinking.  Then roll right up the middle of it - dont try anything too fancy or you may get the spins and end up in the gutter.  Stay focused and the pins basically fall by themselves.  Then repeat, and repeat and the turkey will present itself and you just have to feel thankful.

It's a close walk from the financial district, and it was pretty packed when we got here. Luckily I called ahead and asked them if we came right now, if we could get a table..and they said yes! Of course this was at 11:20 am - otherwise we would have waited til 1pm for a reservation. It's kinda shabby looking on the outside, but when you walk inside its surprisingly pretty nice. Not bad for a chinese restaurant near chinatown! \n\nQuality of the food was pretty good..everything was fresh and hot. They had most of the staples you see in everyday dim sum places: shrimp dumplings, pork dumplings, egg tarts, rice noodle roll, shanghai dumplings, etc. Although everything was good - its a little more Americanized for me. I like the dim sum places with more authentic dim sum: the chicken feet, the beef balls, the tripe, beef stew, etc. I guess they probably don't want to scare the non-chinese patrons off with that tho! Best thing about this is they have carts! I love ordering off carts!\n\nThe service here was pretty attentive..it probably helped that I was able to communicate with them in chinese. So we were able to get water, refill on tea, etc pretty quickly. Overall, not a bad place to come here to eat dim sum. A little pricier ($18 a head) than places I've been to - but its close to the fidi, so you pay for the ambiance and convenience.", "author": "Betty S."}

Maybe I expect too much.\n\nThe restaurant itself is very nice inside, very clean and tidy.  However, for SF and the proximity this is to China Town, you could do a lot better when it comes to Dim Sum.  While run by Chinese, this is really catered to the American crowd and not your traditional Chinese experience.  Sure the food comes out in carts and all but the selection is thin, and the serving sizes are small.  I dunno, but unless you really know Dim Sum (and I'm amused at how many non-Chinese people classify themselves as 'experts') you're really getting ripped off here.\n\nThe egg tarts are the size of a quarter, the BBQ pork buns have a tablespoon of meat in them, the Har-Gow are no bigger than my thumb, and need I go on?

Got to check some sweet bands at BFD, got to burn some of the fat that's been accumulating thanks to school, and got to confirm that City View is the best overall dim sum that I've been to in  SF.  That's a 3-for-3 weekend.\n\nSo why's City View my fave dim sum spot in the city?  Well the reasons are 3-fold.\n\n1.  Tastiness.  I think this is the best tasting dim sum I would go to regularly living in / around SF.  Everything's fresh , the food's seasoned just enough (if it's too heavy, I start suspecting that they're trying to compensate for poor quality ingredients), and the dumpling skins are perfectly firm (sounds dirty, I know).  My friends rave over Koi Palace, but I don't recall being wowed by the food there, but maybe I need to give them another chance.  The other places I recall being really tasty are Ton Kiang and Mayflower, but it is a royal PAIN to park in the Richmond at prime dim sum hours; which brings me to point #2...\n\n2.  FREE VALIDATED PARKING at Portsmouth Square garage.  It's essentially across the street from City View.  Compared with Koi Palace, with as packed as KP gets, at Portsmouth you can find find a spot there that's practically closer to CV than some of the spots in the lot at KP are.  The other benefit of the parking at CV is that you're not battling all the Po Po's for 40 parking spots in a restaurant that serves like 300 people.  I swear I almost ended up in the Circuit City lot once trying to park at KP.\n\n3.  Space / reservations.  Yes, they take reservations at CV.  This allows you to find when there's an open spot for your party and text your buddies to arrive at 12:15 when your reservation time is actually at 12:30 because you know they'll be late anyways.  But at least they'll only be 15 minutes late b/c of the free validated parking instead of the usual 30 minute tardiness that they usually pull.  You know it's true.\n\nSo...we had all the standard dim sum fare.  Har gow, siu mai, pai gwat, etc.  All good.  CV is a little more pricey, but it's worth it.  Ordered a little more than we needed all for $17 pp.  So we probably could've gotten away with $15 pp.  Also, the place is clean and has a tasteful setting.\n\nMagic ratings (out of 10):\nFood: 8\nAmbience: 7\nValue: 10 (for the factors mentioned above)", "author": "J S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-19", "description": "Ok, first of all, if you're going to name your restaurant \"City View\" I expect to see a city view.  Nope.  Should have guessed since Commercial is a freaking alley.\n\nSo this dim sum place is alright, but a lot of non Chinese people, which already means (to me) that it's more for tourists and Chinese people think it's a ripoff.  Part A is correct, obviously since it's like near Chinatown.  Part B is probably correct too, since you find the most Chinese people eating dim sum in Richmond where it's cheaper (except Ton Kiang). \n\nThe food is alright though, I mean it's not horrible but their egg tarts were so tiny I put the whole thing in my mouth at once (not a good idea cuz the custard was hot).  Their chili sauce seemed spicier than other places though, which is good.  And they have real crab claw in the deep fried crab claw with the breaded shrimp (not just shrimp ball). \n\nThe total cost for 7 people was 115$ before tip (and after calculating everything it ended up being like 20$/person).  Not that cheap for dim sum considering I love cheap dim sum places, you do the math.

I think most dim sum fans would agree that the best values for dim sum in the city are in the Inner Richmond.  However, when it is a Tuesday afternoon and you start craving dim sum - your options are somewhat limited.  In a nut shell, you can choose from: Yank Sing, Canton Dim Sum, or City View.\n\nAccordingly, the only sensible way for me to review this place is by comparing it to Yank Sing and Canton Dim Sum.  In this regard, City View is \"average\" - which is actually a really good thing.\n\nOf the three, Yank Sing is the most expensive (i.e. about $30+ for lunch) and Canton Dim Sum is the cheapest (i.e. about $12+ for lunch).  City View falls somewhere in the middle and will probably cost you a Hamilton.  \n\nAs for the quality, Yank Sing is probably the best (at least in my opinion).  Canton isn't bad - but is a little on the doughy side.  City View, on the other hand is a very close second to Yank Sing. \n\nAs for the specifics: the shanghai dumplings (my favorite dim sum plate) are great here - and you should never visit either Yank Sing or City View without ordering them.  The pot stickers here may be my favorite pot stickers in the city (though I'm not really all that into pot stickers).  And, the lettuce wraps are really great.  On the bad side, their shrimp gau are not as good as the shrimp gau at Canton and Yank Sing.  All in all, everything is at least \"pretty good\" here though.\n\nOh, and as a side note - everything is pretty much served in threes here - which is great if you are in a group of three - but slightly annoying if you arrive in a group of four.  \n\nConclusion: City View is cheaper than Yank Sing and better than Canton Dim Sum.  Since I loathe spending a lot of money on lunch, Yank Sing is only for special occasions for me.  Canton Dim Sum is the cheapest, but for the occasional treat, I'm more than ok splurging the extra couple bucks to go to City View.  Sometimes being average can amount to being great.", "author": "Matthew H."}

They also have this fried ball - with a savory filling in the middle.  It's similar in texture to the sesame balls popular at dim sum places, but not sweet. That was unique and tasty.

There was nothing spectacular to talk about regarding the flavor of all the dim sum and stir fry noodles we ordered. The dim sum selection was very limited to what I think of as safe for to the non-dim-sum going crowd of the financial district, and lacked some the tasty and common dim-sum items like chicken feet. Some of the meat used was not trimmed enough and had some tough sinue parts.\n\nI wanted to give this a one star, but the average food quality saved it from that fate.", "author": "H L."}

Siu mai were 4 ridiculously tiny pieces that also didn't taste good, I've had better frozen ones. Har gow was big but lousy and almost more garlic than shrimp inside. \nService was also pretty slow and the timing of the carts and new dishes was really inconsistent.

Unusual for dim sum joint on a Sunday in Vegas at least, maybe sf is different.\nSo this place was awful to me, but you may like it if you prefer more westernized asian food.

So I rounded up some friends, and decided to check this place on the recommendation of SFGate.com.\n\nI really enjoyed it.  We were a party of 10, but they were able to seat us relatively quickly.  To be fair, I was late, so my friends did most of the waiting, but still it was no more than 20 minutes before our entire party was seated.  This being around noon on a Saturday, in Downtown Chinatown, for dim sum.  I was pretty impressed.\n\nThey actually put two groups of tables together to seat us, but the place itself had several large round tables (12-15 people) as well.  They were taken up by a birthday celebration (Note to self:  har gow and Tsingtao before noon, now that's a great birthday idea!), so this place is ideal for bringing a large group.\n\nThe food was really good.  We tried all the staples many times and some of the more adventurous items as well.  The only complaint I heard at the table was that the portions were small.  One friend kept calling them \"dainty\".  Certainly I've seen larger shui mai, but I didn't really mind.\n\nHere's a tip for the more inexperienced dim sum-er.  If you are with a larger party that includes those who aren't as familiar with the concept, try to seat yourself close to the point of entry, so to speak.  This means if you're at a rectangular table, sit on the end towards the middle of the restaurant, or if at a round table, closest to where the carts come around.  This is key because usually you'll be tasked with the decision of yes/no each time the cart passes (a big responsibility, yes), but also you'll usually get first crack at whatever you order.  Also, when you pass something down the table, if it makes it back up to you, you can gun it guilt free.  (WIN!)  With great power, comes great responsibility.  But also great perks!\n\nThe service was really fast.  We were never at a shortage of food, and our tea was refilled as soon as we offset the lid.  Usually if a cart came by and ran out of what we wanted, we could make a special order that came within minutes, hot and fresh.\n\nAs for cost, it was a little pricey.  It came to be about $23/person including tip.  This is definitely going to be more than most dim sum places, but I also noted that we were ordering things left and right without regard, we had a bunch of soft drinks, and the place was clean, the service fast, the food delicious, so it was well worth it.\n\nWould I go back?  Certainly, but I think I should try some other places first.  Definitely good to bring someone who hasn't had dim sum before and who probably won't go for metal pan, hole-in-the-wall joints.", "author": "Zhi Q."}

It may have been a simple mistake, but it really ruined lunch for me as I had to double check the notation for what was being charged everytime. On the second pass of the cart, we ordered 2 dishes and the woman marked down two dishes, hesitated for a minute, looked around and then marked a third and walked off. I was a little shocked that she did that right in front of me and I asked someone to grab her back and explain why we got charged for an extra dish. The offender had an incredulous look for a few minutes and then switched to the \"I got my hand caught in the cookie jar\" look. The other server apologized about a million times and said she would only count 1 of the next two dishes we got just to even things out. She put down the next set of shrimp dumpling as a \"large dish\" and didn't stamp the siu mai, and now we were even. \n\nAt this point I don't know if I can trust anybody, are siu mai and shrimp dumpling considered \"large dishes?\". Other comparable dumplings were subsequently counted as \"medium dishes\". Not feeling like arguing over $0.50 a dish, I let it go.

This restaurant is a top SF request for our out-of-town relatives and the reason why two of our friends who are non-Asian and picky-PICKY eaters have become dim-sum enthusiasts.  Seriously, this place is that damn good!  \n\nDuring our last visit, we brought our cousins from Canada here who always budget time during their SF trips to include lunch at City View.  There were 8 of us and although we caught the lunch rush, we were seated promptly.  We ordered the Calamari, multiple servings of Shumai, Pork buns, Shrimp Dumplings, Chinese Spare-ribs, Honey Walnut Prawns, Tofu and plates of Fried Rice and Hong Kong style Chow-Mein.  We got 3 plates of everything (minus the rice & chow-mein) and everything disappeared within a matter of seconds.  All of the dishes were delectable and the service was pretty decent.  \n\nAnd last, but not least, they let us have the Sesame Balls that were fresh from the pan.  They were perfect, hot and crunchy on the outside with gooey, sweet bean paste on the inside. And I love that their Sesame Balls don't ooze out disgusting grease like some that are made at other Chinese restaurants or bakeries.  \n\nBy lunch's end, our bellies were full and our cravings were abundantly satiated.  We were in and out of the restaurant in less than an hour which is quite a task to be accomplished for a large party at noon on a Thursday.  Try to arrive at 11, you'll get the best dim sum picks and by the time you're done with your meal, you'll have dodged the mad lunch hour rush.", "author": "Jennifer P."}

I always let my boss do the ordering because I still can't get the names down exactly right. I know what I like, but can really only tell by looking.\n\nSo, here's a descriptor of the what I loved at City View:\n1. The sticky rice is my fave.\n2. White buns with pork in them (sho-pow).\n3. Steamed dumplings with mushrooms or shrimp in them.\n4. Green veggies in brown sauce.\n5. For dessert, these little brown balls of something with something in them that tastes close to peanut butter and covered in sesame seeds.\n\nI hate that I can't memorize the names but they are tough.

They need to have a set route  for the carts so they make sure they don't miss the tables in the corner.

You can find me at one of the dim sum joints in Chinatown or the Richmond almost every weekend around brunch time, working the lazy Susan like an oversized Technics DJ deck, chowing down on whatever the locals are eating. Ooh, that looks gross - let's try it!\n\n\n But most of all, I love dim sum because it's cheap. Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap! I am a cheap bastard! I love the idea of paying $6-8 a head, including tax and tip, for a delicious brunch.\n\n\n Unfortunately, City View doesn't meet any of the aforementioned dim sum criteria. The ingredients are fresh and distinguishable from one another. You don't see too many locals tucking into chicken feet or beef tripe. And at $20+ a head, it ain't cheap.\n\n\n As good as it is, City View really doesn't fit into my personal dim sum paradigm.\n\n\n But to their credit, they're the first dim sum place that had a toilet I wasn't scared of.

Very good and everything I've had here has been fresh. The prices, as others have mentioned are not the cheapest, especially compared to some of the other dim sum places in Chinatown but the quality is worth it. Definitely cheaper (and closer for me!) than Yank Sing. I think the peking duck and virtually anything with shirmp here is great. All in all, recommended.", "author": "Anita B."}

I'd review them but I can't always read the signs so I have to call them \"that place with the green awning\" and Google can't map that. Yet. \n\nCity View gets 4 stars from me because I think it's as good or better than Yank Sing sit down, but cheaper and you can order more things off menu (steamed custard buns, for example).

For all of you who have never had dim sum before, you sit at your table and wait for servers to come around to you and offer you a variety of small dishes. The idea is kind of like the Chinese version of Tapas, but dim sum is much different. The servers are on commission, so therefore come to your table every two minutes offering you dishes that either look disgusting (have crab legs sticking out of them) or you just don't want at that time. They put a stamp on your bill each time you receive a plate in order to determine how much to charge you in the end.\n\nGenerally, when it comes to food I am not usually a big fan of greasy Chinese appetizers, but if I am in the mood for them, they can actually be quite tasty. We tried various plates including: pot stickers, egg rolls, pork buns, rice patties (which taste like potato pancakes) and a few others. The food was actually ok.\n\nThe service on the other hand was a different story. As my friend Yan G. stated, \"Unlike their dim sum, service at City View is spotty, aggressive and abrupt.  Prepare to fight for the servers' attention, and do not be surprised when you're offered the same dish over and over again.  Oh, and get your credit card ready as soon as you get the check.  Otherwise, you'll be subjected to the dirty looks by the servers and impatient patrons alike.\"\n\nI would probably go back and try City View again, but this time I would definitely prepare myself for the culture shock beforehand. It almost reminded me of dining in an outdoor caf in Europe and being harassed by beggars, but of course these beggars are bringing you food. I just think that if the servers were not on commission, they wouldn't be as annoying.

A frequent visitor to NYC, I always try to get Dim Sum in Chinatown there and generally have a good experience but am never wowed. City View came as a recommendation from our concierge at The Clift Hotel. Also a dim sum fan, she told us this was one of the best in the city and told us it was off an alley, hard to find for tourists. With those words, we were game! Arriving a few minutes before Noon the restaurant was about 1/2 full. By 12:15, there was a wait. Seeing locals on lunch breaks made us feel at ease that this is a local fav. The carts are plentiful, pass more than once (a pet peeve of mine in NYC, they only come by once) and if you want a specific cart to come around again, all you have to do is ask and they oblige. Larger shared dishes came out of the kitchen to several tables, no sure how we could have secured one of those (a separate menu perhaps?), but quite frankly, we were so full from our selections, we needed the big walk back up Commercial Alley and the streets of SanFran for the remainder of the day to work it off!

So I asked in Chinese.  -1\r\n- shu mai - okay. was good compared to everything else. +1\r\n- some good uncommon dishes - mostly fried, but they were good +1\r\n- sand in my scallop gow (pretty common as it's hard to clean, but the scallop seemed to have been processed - didn't have the chewy texture  -1\r\n- ha gow - bad texture - soft and now chewy -1\r\n- near the end of closing, a guy walked up and mumbled - I didn't know what he said (it was something in Chinese), so I just shook my head and he took the check and calculated it -1\r\n \r\nMy friend said this place was almost like Koi Palace.

City View keeps to that tradition of over MSG- laden dishes that leave you thirsty for hours  and a nice bitter after taste to boot.  To be fair, the decor is great, the restaurant is clean and well kept, and service above average.  But the dumplings come out with mushy skin, the meats under marinated, and the cooked food too salty.\n\nThe saving grace - baked goods.  The baked bbq pork buns and the pineapple buns with custard work out well.\n\nAll in all - it's a 2 star experience in the middle of chinatown.  People in Richmond are better off at Tong Kiang which has better food, less MSG, and better decor. If you are in downtown, for the price, decor, and selection, you are better off with more nuevo dim sum at Yank Sing which uses a bit less MSG.  In the south bay, Joy Luck Place or Mayflower are about in the same league.

Really, though, my expectations weren't THAT high for the dim sum (I just wanted shu mai and those little football things). It was that walking into this restaurant, as everyone notes, you experience cleanliness, decor, all the things for which dim sum is not known. That should have been the omen.\n\nAdmittedly, there are white tablecloths. But if there is nothing tasty off of which to eat, then the table cloth is a non-issue. The main issues were as follows:\n\n* The shu mai were bland, their flavor consisting mostly of salt and their appearance more a sushi caricature.\n* The char siu pork pastries were fairly good, the pastry eggy, flaky and in good proportion to the pork.\n* Shrimp with chives left everything to be desired.\n* The sauce to accompany the flavorless pork buns were accompanied by a watered down sweet and sour sauce that made me wish I'd spent my calories elsewhere. (And I would have, except that when noon came, my patience couldn't last longer than five minutes of no carts or trays passing by.) \n* Little footballs (NO idea what their \"real name\" might be, but they're usually fried and filled with gravied goodness)? Non-existent.\n* Also, can I mention the large number of tray carriers in proportion to cart people weirded me out? It did.\n\nIt should be noted that I ate all of the above. And yet, I left hungry--and disappointed. Little, though, left me as disappointed as my bill for $15.40.

We had a reso and we were seated right on time (go early in the lunchtime window if you can), ate our way through the usual dim sum suspects, were stuffed, and got out for under $20 each.

Today was one of those days...\n\nMy friend suggested this place for lunch. I would say the quality of the food was slightly higher than average.  Not the most amazing tasting dim sum but it didn't disappoint, maybe because I was so hungry.  We had fried chicken skewers (which were pretty tasty), sticky rice with some kind of mystery meat that comes wrapped in what looks like a banana leaf (yuck, didn't like it at all; pass on that one), shrimp on a slice of green pepper (not bad), steamed porkbun (just average), thick pan fried rice noodles (in a really good light sauce), and last but not least custard buns (deeeeelicious! I would go back just for those!)\n\nNow for service and presentation....some of the servers coming around seem absolutely annoyed with having to keep repeating the same thing over and over and over to each and every table they walk by. I don't blame them, but hey that's your job, you don't need to bring me down too. I'm just trying to enjoy my lunch. The other criticism I would give is that there should be a way to signal to the servers that you are or are not ready for more food.  It can get a little annoying when you're trying to have a conversation and you get interrupted every 3 minutes by the servers offering you what just came out of the kitchen.  And I think that would take a lot of stress off of the servers as well to have some kind of signal system.  \n\nAs far as presentation, I found it a little annoying that everything comes out in 3's.  It's great if you're eating with 2 other people, but often times its just you and one other person, or even groups.  I don't enjoy fighting over the last piece of something, so I think it would be wiser if they prepared some things in 3's and some things in 4's to accomodate both odd and even parties.  \n\nWell, that's my two cents on that.  Hope you enjoyed my honest input. \n\n;-)", "author": "L. Renee D."}

Since I sat down, I should have waited a bit to see if more trays were going to be wheeled out. They keep them coming back pretty fast so I would suggest if you are a first time goer, pass the first few trays that come your way and wait and watch when they bring new trays out of the kitchen. that way you get teh freshest and most hot food. When you first sit down, you have no idea how long they have been wheeling those trays around and your food could be cold. \n\nOnce I got the hang of it, all my food was hot. I did not feel like the food was soooooo great. It was oik. but not anything so awesome that I never had anywhere else before. and since three of my plates were cold, it kinda took away from me liking the place. \n\nMy total bill came to $30 and with a tip, i felt that I had really eaten very expensive Panda Express. Some of the dumplings were good though. I just think getting the cold food ruined it for me. I did see a lot of Asian people eating there so that is always a good sign. Maybe I just got the wrong things. \n\nI was just happy I was able to hold/use my chop sticks instead of a fork :)", "author": "Food C."}

It was terrible, and I can still say that after its been a couple of months.  The service there was so bad.  I mean that's kindof what I've come to  expect at dim sum restaurants, but this was worse than most others.  They were simply not helpful.  There was this one woman there with dyed red hair whom I swear is like el diablito ur something.  She reminded me of some witch who was enticing me to eat city view's disgusting food.  (Disclaimer:I am not generally a fan of chinese food, in dim sum format or not).  The food itself reeked of acoupledays olditude and was simply not candastic or good.  I don't know, I'll stop before I start railing on city view even more or start making up more words,, but my one piece of advice which I wish to give is that you, my little dumpling, should AVOID this stinkin' place.", "author": "Kirk J."}

This place was never on our list of stops...probably because it hasn't been around that long.  It's actually kinda on the border of Chinatown and unless you frequented Commercial Street, you'd never have guessed there was a dim sum place here...and a rather nice place it is as well.  I arrived for a large gathering and was surprised to see the place was not even packed at 11am.  As the party gathered, it was evident that the ordering was going to go overboard.  They had all the usual dim sum favorites...chicken feet, tripe, fish eyes, etc.  I kid.  There was plenty of choices for the unadventurous as well as the dim sum connoisseur.  All were tasty.  Since it was a large group, it was hard to gauge just how much each dish cost.  By the end of the meal, it looked like the whole order card had been ticketed.  Brunch ended up being somewhere around $20 a person.  It's not bad if you're looking to get away from the crowded dim sum restaurants several blocks away.  Very clean and spacious.", "author": "JeFF T."}

But I suppose it is near the financial district.  We were seated quickly, and like usual, was asked what kind of tea we want.  I ordered the chrysanthemum tea which was very watered down and had no taste of the chrysanthemum.  There weren't that many dim sum being pushed around, but for the few that we had, it was decent.  The steam pork bun was not as great because the bread wasn't very good.  It sort of sticks to the roof of the mouth when you chew it.  The good one doesn't.  Another surprising thing I saw that you normally wouldn't see at dim sum place is that they have many of their main dishes put into smaller dishes and trying to sell it as dim sum.  For instance, peking duck and pawns with walnut.  Those are your typical ordered main entrees.  But this might be a way the restaurant wants to cater to their non-chinese customers.", "author": "Crystal L."}

This place focuses on quality and not quantity, even though at times I prefer the latter. Its a bit pricey for dim sum, just bring a few friends and split the bill. In a big group one should expect to spend $10-$15 a person and get their fill. They are fairly busy on the weekends and there may be a long wait, but its well worth it. I use to see a lot of local folks but now I see more and more tourist/out of towners in this joint, please don't blow up the spot!!! The wait is already torturous when they roll the cart of fresh tsa tso bow, ha-gow, siu-mai, around the waiting area to give you that little tease before the feast. My suggestion, TRY EVERYTHING!!! This one of my top three dim sum joints of all time. No. 1 in the SF city. This spot is in a small alley like street so its hidden off the main road. It is cleaner than most establishments in chinatown, so don't worry about sticky tables and wiping down your chopsticks/teacups/plates before you eat.", "author": "Ron T."}

We were told we were in luck, the best dim sum was only 2 blocks from our hotel.  Naturally we were skeptic that this particular restaurant had some kind of deal with our concierge.  The iPhone was broken out and Yelp was consulted.  A place that had a four star average with over 150 reviews was worth our time.  And boy was it.  There were five of us, three of us long time lovers of the dim sum, one of us who had spent the entire morning talking about how disgusting dim sum was and the two times he had eaten in LA were the worst moments of his life.  I wanted to smack him, nobody talks about my dim sum like that.  The fifth was a dim sum virgin, my beau's mother from Wisconsin who thinks just about everything is \"too spicy.\"   Surprise, surprise, everyone loved their lunch.  We ate all of our favorites and some new stuff too.  The newbie and former hater couldn't stop raving.  Hits were the pork and ginger dumplings, the steamed sticky rice, anything with shrimp, ohhh the duck, yahhh.  We went back a second time with a bigger group and really partied with food.  Yes the prices were a little higher than what we were used to, but hey we kind of eat like ugly Americans so we expect to pay more.

We were given a menu but then servers started bringing food around on trays. We had only chosen a few things when a server informed us that the last cart had just passed us by and if we wanted anything else we would have to order off the menu. I thought they must be ending their lunch service because it was a little late, around 2:00. But then we saw servers continue to walk around with trays and carts to the other tables, but not ours. Do you only get one shot to pick out what you want to eat? Also, the menu has no prices and you have no idea what kind of bill you're racking up until you get the bill. When we were in the middle of our meal, a server took away our menus and brought the check, eliminating the option to order more food or get dessert. Meanwhile, servers continued to pass trays of food to a nearby table. It was a very strange experience and I didn't feel welcome there. Most of the food was pretty good but it was nothing unique--I could have gotten it at another restaurant with better service. I would not recommend this place and I would not go back.", "author": "A.

We have enjoyed the dumplings and noodle dishes and one of our favorites is the shrimp egg roll- hot, deep-fried and crispy.  However in the last month or so they seem to have been experiencing some operational problems in the kitchen.  The food quality seems inconsistent - sometimes lukewarm food is served from their trays even though the servers have newly exited the kitchen door.  The time it takes for them to reach you also has been more considerable.  We waited for nearly 15 minutes before someone with a food cart came down our isle.  We have grown into the habit of asking for our orders rather than waiting for food carts to pass through.  Oh and by the way, if you're a \"two-seater,\" try to avoid the 2-top tables in the middle row.  The food carts tend to avoid this isle and make their way first to the bigger tables (round tables of 8 or more) before they come down the middle isle.  We hope they will correct this problem because we do enjoy their food.  To finish, one great thing to say about this place is they validate parking at the Chinatown garage.", "author": "Denny L."}

While big shot dim sum eaters will be disappointed with certain liberties and short cuts some of the dumplings demonstrate (like the famous HK dumplings with soup inside them- which City View omits in their \"version\" of xiao long bao), but ok value and consistent options, some of which taste excellent, should make City View a place to grab dim sum for brunch with a group of friends or family on a Sunday without felling like you are spending a ridiculous amount, or full of greasy food.
