A server clocked in while I was eating.\n\nIt is true--the lengua here has a depth of beefiness Taq' Guads does not have. It has a more velvety mouthfeel...melting like a meaty terrine, and it exudes a collagen rich nectar that has you licking your lips and fingers.\n\nI chose the Super Burrito. Good, but the other ingredients were simply distractions from the lengua. Each time I bit into a knot of chunked lengua, I collided with a moment of euphoria. On retrospect, the other reviewers were absolutely correct-- the regular burrito would showcase the lengua far better. \n\nThe salsas were also a notch up in authenticity. Somehow, the chilies and herbs were edgier and had greater contrast. I was practically drinking the creamy avocado enriched salsa verde and I liked blending the salsa roja with the bright green tomatillo salsa. They serve a tortilla chip here that is puffy--I prefer the translucent thin variety.\n\nThe large TV might have been tuned to Telemundo? A football (soccer to America) match was going that had the attention of just about every guest in the room.\n\nWatching the man behind the counter craft each order with immense pride was a great fun. He often hung back to watch us devour our food with a satisfied grin--almost like being fed by family.\n\nAll the staff were attentive and uber friendly--they glance at you periodically as they moved about the restaurant to see if you need anything. They were very patient with me and eager to answer my questions. The place is alive with Spanish speakers with broad economic diversity. I chose to speak English the entire time I was there. By the time my meal was ending, I half expected to walk out to a dusty litter lined-street and white painted tree trunks in Mexico.\n\nI am looking forward to my return. When I do, I shall have to order a taco trio of the other meats--chorizo, carnitas and tripas just to see how they stack up.\n\n\nADDENDUM 6/19/2016--the trio of tacos was educational. The chorizo is the typical, red tinted greasy tangy mess that is satisfying as it is messy. The Carnitas is good with moist chunky bits of caramelized flesh. The Tripas is actually very good with crunchy crackling bits and creamy clean interiors--no barnyard after flavors. I would suggest that you ask for the salsa on the side as the salsa is distracting for all three meats. A spritz of lime would have done it.\n\nAt the end of the day, the lengua reigns supreme here.", "author": "Lu-Shien T."}

I was a little tired of the usual places I go to and so I decided to venture off to the Excelsior. It was one of the best decisions I made that day. I got two super burritos, (al pastor, carne asada), order of ceviche and two churros (regular and caramel filled). \nThe meat is super juicy and tasty, the rice and beans inside the burrito was flavorful. Overall, it was a very solid burrito. The burrito was a fair size and I wasn't overly stuffed. The ceviche was DELICIOUS. It was acidic, tangy, and a very nice spicy kick to it. I preferred the regular churro as opposed to the caramel filled one because the latter was a little too sweet. The churros remained crispy throughout the car ride which was very impressive. \nThe service wasn't the fastest even though it didn't look too busy (might of been a bunch of phone orders) .

I heard a lot of great reviews from family's raving about the food coming from this restaurant is so good. So I better try it, it was a Friday night and of course, a lot of family and friends eating here having a good time. It is busy after 5 pm. Of course, a lot of customers are ordering anything seafood like shrimp cocktails, molcajete. Then some people are ordering combo plates like tacos, burritos and a lot of great cocktails to go with it. The ambiance here is so lively and casual. The waiting staff are so friendly, courteous and are very professional.\nWe ordered the following:\nMolcajete de Camarones - it is a sizzling molcajete filled with grilled seafood like shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams and crab legs. They put a butter garlic sauce and is not overpowering. My sister in law saw this at the other table but I think she ordered the regular size which is $25. There is a bigger one which cost $41 and has the specialty like the one I saw with Mark Wiens ate at one of the restaurants offer there, but they added seafood. So it is a bigger molcajete (a stone mortar that is sizzling hot filled with grilled flank steak, some seafood like shrimp, crab legs, scallops, grilled and charred Nopales hanging over at one side, onions and some sauce with it. It was sizzling hot. There are sides of rice and refried beans, and your choice of tortillas. This is a showstopper, and it was good like 3.9/5. $22.\nHuaraches is pretty simple but flavorless dish because it is just corn masa deep fried filled with shredded beef, sour cream, tomatoes, onions, and guacamole. Bleh!!!... Not the best I had! 1.3/5. $8.75.\nMy brother got the enchiladas and flautas combo plate with some Mexican rice and refried beans. It was satisfyingly good like their enchiladas sauce is great and had some flavor - 3.8/5. $15.95.\nI ordered the Gallina de Mole - so basically it is a rich sauce that is made from scratch and so flavorful with chicken thighs that are soft and perfectly cooked. The mole negro is made with chiles, spices, almonds, sesame seeds, carbs, cinnamon. I mean this sauce is rich and so flavorful served with a side of refried beans and Mexican rice, and hot corn tortillas. In my opinion, I had tasted better Mole but coming from a restaurant - this was great. I only ate 1/2 of it and was too full because of the sides. Their mole is worth it if you just want to explore and try what mole really is. I would rate this as 4.2/5. If I had a choice of beans like black beans - then this dish will be better in terms of texture and combinations of ingredients and flavors. If you eat any rich and spicy food here, always get an iced cold beer or horchata to go with it. The horchata here is not too sweet as in other restaurants. But I liked the slight sweetness, cinnamon of a cold rice drink. The prices are normal in the East Bay Area and it is dinner time. $19.\nThe service here is great especially serving customers on a Friday night and I think it is payday for most customers here. And of course, a lot of Hispanic customers ordering seafood because it is Friday and near Lent season. So yeah! it is expected.\nTheir shrimp cocktail is filled with clam juice, a lot of shrimp ceviche, and a lot of avocados which gives it the creamy texture and great combination. Their cocktail is on the sweet balanced side with lime wedges overhanging the rim of the glass. Then few folks here ordered Margarita to go with it. As if you were at the beach eating it. So their menu is so diverse, and a lot of variety here. The prices here are on the higher average range like $9 to $41. Drinks are $3 to $10.Appetizers are $6 to $9. Desserts are $6. \nIf you were to come here for great Mexican food that tastes like home and want authentic - this is the place. But expect prices ranging from $6 to $41. A lot of variety of dishes they serve. Here are their specialties, Molcajete combo plates, their mole negro (Gallina de Mole) and mole pipian (Gallina de Pipian - another type of mole made of tomatillos, pepitas or pumpkin seeds, and poblano peppers). They serve great cocktails here too.\nI would come back here for more for a special occasion. In the heart of the East Bay, you can find a restaurant that serves Mexican authentic home cooking that has a passion for great food with great people serving you with lively and vibrant personalities, and smiles.", "author": "Jade M."}

I am not sick of, B. doesn't have what I referred to as \"fake chips\" (El Farolito) but is also good and authentic. It was a toss up between Menudo and Tipico. I know I have been to both, but not recently enough to remember. \n\nWe walked past Tipico and I felt a little embarrassed to take her in there because it looked super dead and not extremely welcoming and then we walked past Menudo and the woman working inside kind of gave us a stink eye (which might not have been intended- I have resting bitch face too so I don't judge). I hopped on Yelp and saw my girl Cherylynn's rave review of Tipico and the choice was made. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered a wet burrito with shredded chicken and I ordered the enchiladas. The cashier who takes your order was so friendly and when my girlfriend asked if there were onions in the wet burrito she said yes in the pico and guac. She could see the stressed-out look on my friend's face that completely read \"but guac though...\"so she said, \"would you like us to just put avocado instead of guacamole?\" SO NICE. They seriously put at least half an avocado on her burrito. \n\nThe lady asked me what kind of meat I wanted in my enchiladas so I said \"can I have one steak and one grilled chicken\" and she said \"yes, and what about the other one?\" THREE?!?! Wow, talk about generous portions, only $9.95! \n\nEverything was a homerun from the enchilada sauce to the guacamole to the rice and beans. I also really liked how they put shredded lettuce, a nice RIPE slice of tomato and a dollop of both crema and guac on the plate. I feel like nowadays you hardly ever find places that do that anymore, everything is extra (i'm looking at you Santa Rosa Taqueria -_-)\n\nGreat service, real chips, great food, salsa bar, great prices.

There's Guadalajara AND Farolito's a few blocks down so in contrast, this place hides in the shadows..\nI've been a frequent customer at Guadalajara for a few years now and I didn't really even know about this place (or care to know about it..) I happened to be doing some Yelp research as my friend wanted Mexican food near his place, and I found that I had bookmarked Tipico a while ago.\n\nI bookmarked this place to try the menudo but that's only available on weekends.. GUESS I'LL HAVE TO COME BACK. I opted for the al pastor burrito instead so I could compare it with Guadalajara's.\n\n** COMPARED TO GUADALAJARA **\nVenue: smaller, and gives kinda the same gritty, casual restaurant vibe (but not dirty, by any means). Seating shouldn't be too difficult as many people just scarf their food down and bounce.\n\nSalsas: Self-serve and pretty standard. All seems to be home-made and the spicy salsas DEFINITELY have a kick. I like-y. Guadalajara's green sauce is bomb though and nothing can compare to that... they don't have a similar sauce here :(\n\nChips *free w/ order: They seem to be house-fried (not hot ) - crispy and on the thicker side. SO FREAKIN ADDICTING. Tastes more flour based than corn based (probably why it's so addicting).. not oily on the fingers.\n\nWait time: Seems longer than Guadalajara. Waited like 15 minutes for my burrito. SO HUNGRY. At least they give you chips though :)\n\nBurrito: In a nutshell: delicious, not too much rice, KIND of soggy and not warm to the touch (the sour cream/guac makes it feel a bit cold, actually) - but the taste factor makes up for the last 2 things.\n\nLOOKED a bit small but it was a beast. FULL of filling and not too much rice (don't you hate it when you pay for a burrito and all you get is rice?!) Even distribution of filling. A bit soggy for my liking though (I think it's b/c they put the pico de gallo in it already) and you definitely don't need to add any salsa to it as it's flavorful enough. Super flavorful and cooked well but doesn't feel heavy. Tastes more 'tomatoey' than Guadalajara. \n\nI don't remember what my friend got, but it was basically a chicken + rice + beans dish which came with tortillas (and they give you a plastic cover thing so the tortillas stay warm!). Meat is definitely on the oilier side, but MAN, was it tender and flavorful.... shitton of food for $10.\n\nGlad I came here!

They make everything fresh so it too awhile for us to get our order. This may sound weird but my burrito was TOO saucy and it made it very heavy for me to eat. They put way too much sour cream and cheese in it and I swear all the meat was on the bottom where I couldn't really eat the burrito anymore. Once I reached the bottom I just used a spoon to scoop out the chicken cause I didn't want the sauce. I must say their green salsa is pretty good though, as well as their chips. Their chips are different from other places, they are light, crispy and not oily at all which I liked. As for the lengua burrito the meat was okay...it was a bit too chewy. \n\nWhile we were waiting for our order I did see a lady hand making their tortillas which was pretty awesome, I think if I do come back next time I will order some tacos.", "author": "Sherry L."}

Once lunch time rolls around this place can get packed rather quickly.\n\nThe menu is good. A nice mixed selection of your usual items. They also include chips and salsa along with your order which I am starting to realize is not common in all Mexican restaurants.\n\nBecause this place gets so busy you may find yourself waiting for awhile for your food. Not sure if they take over the phone orders but expect to wait for a bit. When I was there they only had 2 cooks at the time working so just be patient and watch the TV.\n\nI paid cash but I believe that they accept credit/debit card as well.\n\nI food was good once I finally sat down. I had ordered a carnitas burrito and it was cool. It seemed a bit dry even though there was a mix of guacamole, cheese, and sour cream. \n\nThe burrito was very filling but I just would've liked for the burrito to have had a bit more flavor.

I asked for lots of lettuce on my burrito and not only did I get it fast within 10 minutes but they got the custom order of lettuce right!!  \n\nTheir food is sooooo good, so saucy, tasty, not dry like a lot of other burritos in the city - here, the burrito is hot, saucy and eats like a meal and is big!!!  I was surprised too with the chips- I would have thought they would just toss some old cold yucky chips to the order but no,the chips looked pretty fresh and heated and tasted fresh, warm, crunchy.  I wondered where the sauce for the chips were and was told you have to go to the area with the sauces (to the right of the clerk's counter) to choose from the various salsa and/or guacamole sauce(s) you want to accompany your chips.  I couldn't tell what each one tasted like just by looking at them so I got 3 tiny empty sauce bowls and filled them up with a different sauce.  Texture and heat spiciness were different for each.\n\nAnd finally, their aqua frescas  are fresh, cool, not too sweet, refreshing with a selection of cantaloupe, tamarind, horchata, strawberry) .  \n\nWhat's also great is they ACCEPT CC or debit cards!!!  How refreshing!! (Hello la corneta taqueria, taqueria cancun, el gran taco loco, etc!!! --- no one's going to DRAIN their wallets of $15 or more of cash all the time just to get a drink and a burrito!!!) \n\nThe restaurant is clean and pretty spacious with 4 or so medium tables(each table fitting 4 people) on one side and 3 small tables(if you're by yourself) on the other side.

It was my first time trying lengua. Succulent, tender... but lacks a little flavor. Much better when added hot sauce.\n\nMojado - Did not dig the sauce. Tastes almost like an italian tomato sauce.

We ordered one super burrito with grilled chicken and another with carne asada and then got some salsas from the salsa bar. Their selection isn't as extensive as the other place, but it was decent. We waited a really long time for our food and felt like people who arrived after us got their food before us, but I was fine with that as long as the burritos were good. \n\nWhen we got home I took a bite and felt the ingredients weren't as evenly distributed as they could have been, but both the rice and meat had really good flavor.

I quickly jumped on Yelp to investigate the pozole situation in our area. Mexico Tipico stood out amongst the options. As soon as the bf woke up, I was there to sweet talk him into joining me. \n\nAs promised there were two kinds of pozole that were only available on the weekend (red and green). I saw a family of 4 with two bowls of each kind of pozole and I awkwardly hovered over them, trying to hide the fact that I was sneaking peaks at their meals so that I could determine which kind to get. Ultimately, I went for the red pozole and the bf went with the chicken mole poblano. Holy cow, they were both insane. The pozole came out piping hot and full of meaty pork chunks (not just lots of pork bones like at other places) and hominy, and the broth had a rich deep flavor. It came with accoutrements of onions, lemon, radishes, cabbage, which I promptly dumped into the bowl. My bf took a picture of me happily slurping away and sent it to his mother. How embarrassing. Anyway, there was so much that I ended up having to take it to go and eat it for dinner! Boyfriend's chicken mole was also delish - chicken was tender, mole was sweet but not too sweet. \n\nThe prices were reasonable, portion sizes were generous, and service met all expectations.

This stretch of Mission is a bit dicey even at around 9PM, but I was lucky to find a parking space just a few yards away. We entered to see the yellow and orange place abuzz with activity. It appears to be a favorite with locals since most of the tables were filled. I spotted one table and told Jamie to sit there to stake a claim while I ordered our food.\n\nThey have a long photo menu along the wall that was kinda hard to read from my vantage point. Jamie decided on the $7.95 Bistek Ranchero, which was slices of grilled beef mixed with onions and potatoes topped with their special ranchero sauce. It came with rice and refried beans topped with queso fresco (see photo). It was pretty tasty for a hearty appetite, especially since it came with a half-dozen corn tortillas in a plastic bin. As for me, give me the $6.50 bowl of Menudo, prepared traditionally with tripe and beef stomach meat...mmm-mmm (rubbing my protuding belly).\n\nIt takes hours to simmer, and they added some chili paste to give it a rich red color. It comes with all sorts of spices on the side - dried oregano and crushed red chili peppers - along with a wedge of lime, chopped onions and chopped cilantro (see photos). Dump it all into the red broth and you have the perfect late-night treat, hangover be damned.

Since there wasn't any seats while we ordered (and it was gloriously sunny outside) we took the food to go.\n\nI ordered steak fajitas, guacamole on the side, and my boyfriend got a chorizo taco. Both were pretty bland, and they had refried beans instead of pinto like in the pictures and in yelp photos. She also forgot my side of guacamole, but the green salsa was to die for. \n\nI probably wouldn't go back there, there's too many other taquerias in this city to discover. 3 stars because it wasn't bad, just not great either.", "author": "Kylie F."}

I, on the other hand, choose to gnaw on cow stomach and trotters, a \"barnyard in a bowl\" to rid my hangover. Yup, it's the FOB in me!  \n\nIn the last 4 months, I've been coming to Mexico Tipico almost every weekend to get my hands on their bowl of menudo (only served on the weekends) and to satiate my post-drinking ravenous craving for something soupy. \n\nFor a mere $6.50, you get a huge bowl of menudo that's overflowing with honeycomb tripe and trotters (feet) that's gelatinous and so soft that it literally melts-in-your-mouth. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/N_-4AfYmNFKEkvgh3Qj5Eg?select=ZfFkC7Q0m60XSCJZl3MGcQ The red hued broth is rich, comforting, and packed with deep complex flavors with mild chili nuances. It's also accompanied with warm corn tortillas, diced onions, cilantro, lime, red chili pepper flakes and dried oregano. I normally add all the spices for an added layer of heat, tang, and herbaceousness. \n\nI've tried 3-4 places in SF and Mexico Tipico has the BEST menudo that's consistently good and several dollars cheaper than its competitors which keeps me coming back for more. \n\nSo how exactly does Menudo cure a hangover? It's believed that the tripe/stomach's sponginess will absorb the alcohol in your stomach. Makes sense doesn't it?", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Don't come here for ambiance.\n\nThe menu includes nachos, tortas, burritos ($4.90 for a regular, your choice of meat), soups (popular with the locals), platillos, enchiladas, beer and Mexican beverages.  They have a salsa bar with three kinds of salsa.  The one that looks like salsa fresca with onions, tomatoes, jalapenos, and cilantro is very spicy, fresh and flavorful.  \n\nI ordered two tacos ($2.35 each) and received a basket of free corn tortilla chips. These were thick, crispy, sweet and fresh.  The tacos (two small corn tortillas) were covered with meat, salsa, onions and finely shredded cilantro.  Simple and fresh, the way I like them.

Then i switched over to team cancun just for their wet burrito and melon agua frescas...still have mad respect, but my latest venture put me face to face with an unbalanced, lukewarm burrito, still the size of a newborn, but being mostly composed of rice. \n\nI have graduated to Mexico Tipico because the quality of the food is top notch without sacrificing price. I always rate a taqueria by the quality of their burrito and tipico chops their meat options into fine pieces, leaving out the gristle and fat and taking on this amazing charred flavor, which I find lacking in other major contending taquerias. The meat is also typically abundant, and well balanced with the other basic elements like cheese, guac, salsa, rice, etc. It's nice to get a little bit of everything in each bite!\n\nBut what I love about tipico is the fact that they have an extensive menu of traditional foods. I've tried the dinner plates and they are fantastic! Standouts would be the chicken mole and caldo de res (beef stew type soup), and they supply you with a little container of warmed tortillas to eat with your food. Hit up that salsa bar they have in the back (I always load up on the pickled jalapenos with the spicy salsa) and you have yourself a meal that will tickle all your senses. late night senses, even, as they are open late on the weekends so *DRUNK FOOD ALERT!*", "author": "Katie O."}

The first dish I sampled was the caldo de siete mares (\"seven seas soup\"): a spicy, savory red broth bursting with flavor and half the cast of \"The Little Mermaid:\" almost half a crab, some clams, some mussels, a small octopus, a generous chunk of some kind of fish, and a few shrimp.  It was also loaded with big hunks of carrot, zucchini, jicama, and potato.  At $16 or so with tax, it's not a cheap dish, but together with chips, tortillas, and salsa, it's a total meal for two hungry people or one truly ravenous individual.  I'd recommend getting it to go; the \"to go\" portion size (two -not one, but two- huge plastic tubs) seems a bit bigger than the dine-in bowl.\n    The super burrito con carnitas ($6) was awesome: an ultra-dense, tightly-wrapped, perfectly symmetrical cylinder of gastronomical bliss, it was full of deliciously porky chunks of Wilbur's corkscrew-tailed ilk.\n    Corn chips come with most orders, and there is a self-serve salsa bar in the back with salsa roja, salsa verde, pico de gallo, radishes, and pickled carrots and jalapenos.\n    Go to Mexico Tipico.

My family now never goes anywhere else for burritos, never returning to our past favorite, La Corneta, which seems like an over-priced gringo trap by comparison.  For a period of time, my son would randomly howl, \"Mexico TIPICOOOOOOO!\"; yes, it's that good.\n\nThe restaurant scores big on both quality and value.  The burritos ($4.90) are superb--large and chock full of rice, whole pinto beans, your choice of meat, and salsa and/or hot sauce, if you'd like.  They are moist and flavorful, never dry the way some burritos can be.  My wife often can only finish half, saving the rest for another meal.\n\nAlso excellent are the quesadilla suiza ($4.90), which are served piping hot with loads of melted swiss cheese and chunks of juicy meat morsels; and the tortas ($5.25), gigantic sandwiches with the bread hollowed out to hold a bounty of meat (roasted pork is our favorite) and vegetable toppings.  If you get the latter to go, get it home quickly; the bun can become soggy in transit.\n\nWe've eaten in the restaurant's cafe-like setting several times, but typically get our food to go.

Then, the ugliness came on... unpeeled tongue piece... I was chewing on an unpeeled tongue piece. Gross!!!\n\nNone of that happened today.  Soft delicious meat... fresh... good salsa with the right hot bite. The burrito came wrapped in tin foil on wax paper on top of a real plate!!!!  That spoke volumes to me.  I'm still Chinese enough to eat pizza with knife and fork and am the same way with a burrito.\n\nAlso, there's no strange stuff going on in this burrito of mine.  \nYou know... multicultural nightmares do happen in San Francisco where you get coleslaw on one end and fruit salad on the other. That didn't happen.\n\nI was so happy there was no corn in this burrito (like at  Taqueria Los Coyotes).  That's just wrong to me.\n\nI do miss the burritos I had at Taqueria Maria that used to be on Geneva Avenue.  \n\nI give Mexico Tipico Taqueria Restaurant my full approval.  The decor is so damn orange yellow and sunny.\n\n**********************************************************************\nAfter seeing a Barbara Stanwyck double feature (All I Desire and There's Always Tomorrow) at the Castro, I stopped at Mexico Tipico and ordered a super tongue taco.  Again, it was fresh with plenty of sour cream and guacamole... underneath it all was a lot of meat.  The tongue was tender and tasty.  Not at all sour like I usually get.\n\n**************************************************************************\nFor that, I upped my rating of this place from four stars to five. Recently I took my friend from Los Angeles, who is a picky eater, and he liked the place a lot.  He said the food was tasty.\n\nThe burritoeater's review below:\nhttp://www.burritoeater.com/restaurant.php?taqueria_id=6", "author": "Priscilla L."}

Free salsas and chips with every order is a plus.  The lady at the counter is also very friendly.  \n\nOnce I needed a pepper for cooking a meal at home but it was too late to go to the grocery store.  I popped in Mexico Tipico and asked if I could just buy a single green pepper.  They were more than accomodating with this unique request, and that wins them bonus points!\n\nOpen until 2 am on wknds.  I reccomend this joint over the other Mexican restaurants in Excelsior.", "author": "Ivan C."}

El Farolito's is the absolute staple, but I would chose this place in a heartbeat.  The burritos are bitchin, the service is quick and friendly, everything tastes fresh and homemade, just like a local joint should be.", "author": "Marilyn R."}

I always get to many and eat to much, but for lunch it is definitely a fast and affordable place to eat.\n\nAs for customer service, the cooks are usually quiet and talk amongst themselves, the guy who runs the front counter is very friendly and polite, and even jokes a little.\n\nI usually get my meals to go, but I have eaten inside a few times and would say I think it is best to pick up your orders and eat at home....", "author": "Brandon B."}
