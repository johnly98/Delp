This location has warm food, such as warm sandwiches, while the Clement location has different types of avocado toast. \n\nA must try for food is the Cinn-ful Sugar (sweet) and the Truffle in Paradise (savory).

They have two locations in SF and the one I went to worked out perfectly for the day I had planned out. \n\nParking is pretty easy (surprisingly) as its right in front of the store with plenty of spaces. \n\nThe shop itself is quite cute and has a friendly \"no laptops\" policy to endorse talking and hanging out with friends. They have a good menu and a variety of aesthetic looking coffee to try out. \n\nI got the famous Birthday Cake Latte (vanilla latte). The coffee flavor is amazing and makes you think twice about getting starbucks ever again. My friends got the Salted Caramel and Red Velvet lattes which were also really yummy. Not gonna lie though, out of all three, the Salted Caramel was the best. \n\nDefinitely try to stop by here if you're in the area and looking for nice coffee and wonderful service!", "author": "Nabiha A."}

Line wasn't too bad when we arrived but quickly started to fill up. We did have to wait a little for a table big enough For all of us but not too long and there was other seating in the meantime. We ordered a couple of pastries including the blueberry mochi doughnut and a raspberry almond croissant. Both were tasty. We also ordered a cinnamon sugar toast, an egg in a basket toast, and their specialty toast which had corn and egg and cheese. I think the bread that they use was really tasty but the toppings on the special toast could use a little improvement. It was essentially just canned corn thrown on the toast with an egg on top. The egg in a basket toast Was probably the yummiest apart from the cinnamon sugar.\n\nFor drinks we ordered a birthday cake latte which is what really brought us there because we saw it on IG. lol. The art on that was cute! My husband ordered a coconut iced latte or smtn like that that he enjoyed it! For the girls we ordered a nutella hot chocolate and they garnished it with cookie crisp. Also ordered an orange juice for the littlest one which was good. \n\nOver all the prices were about standard for a coffee shop of that sort and the vibe was very modern. \n\nI would recommend a Stop if you are in the area and have some time. They do also have some tables where you could sit and work with your laptop and some tables where they request you not have your laptop so more people are able to sit and come through. \n\nThere are more flavors of coffee that I would like to try so I'll stop by again someday.", "author": "Carmen A."}

I've seen their drinks everywhere and I'm glad I finally got to try!\nCame here around 3pm on a Sunday and it was pretty full. There was a short line but we were really scouting out where to sit down. \nThe place is quite small with some bar seating and tables alongside the right side. \nParking is on Noriega St so it can be easy or hard depending on the time you go. \n\nWe decided to try the Birthday Cake Latte since it is the most popular drink because of how pretty it is. I was really surprised in how good it tasted! It was really just a vanilla latte made all pretty. It wasn't too sweet and it was a pretty good latte overall. We came from lunch so we didn't order any of their food. \nThe only complaint is the people sitting there. Everyone had their laptops when I think there are signs to not use a laptop. I guess people don't know how to read? We sat by the window and these two girls sat in the middle leaving one seat on each end of them. I sat on the edge and they still didn't seem to get the clue until my boyfriend took the chair at the other end. Then they were like oh we can move down one so you guys can sit together!

The yolk from the egg on top marinated the whole dish together. The brioche toast was springy and perfectly toasted. \n\nOverall, I would come here again!

I discovered this cafe when I entered \"latte art\" in the search engine, and since then I listed this as the must-go places for coffee.\n\nThe cafe exceeded my expectations. One, the birthday cake latte wasn't extremely sweet despite the color and the name. I also ordered the coconut vanilla latte, so there were two coffees. They were sweet coffees, as the barista explained, so it was fine without ordering other dessert tarts or pastries. Both coffees weren't overpoweringly sweet, so they left a light aftertaste. \n\nBefore leaving, I also ordered the London Fog Latte, and this was very good too. The tea bag was left in the cup, but the tea never great bitter, so I realized they used a high grade of tea leaves.\n\nI would like to visit the other Home cafe on another day to explore other drinks too because all three were very delicious.", "author": "Mito I."}

I especially love how they don't skimp on the chicken sausage or pesto. every single bite is full of flavor. do yourself a favor and add a fried egg! \n\nMango pastry: again, absolutely delicious. the mango was crazy flavorful and the pastry was delectably flaky and delicate. the pastries are sweet, so keep that in mind and consider ordering a less sweet drink to pair with it. \n\nI'm sad I live on the east coast and can't go here every day.", "author": "Stephanie M."}

My friend ordered a matcha latte and she said it was just ok, as well.

It often seems there's always a few people with labtops doing work, so it def has a great work vibe.\n\nThe drink menu is pretty unique. There are interesting types of lattes. This time around I ordered a godzilla, which is sparking iced matcha. I don't like my drinks terribly sweet so the baristas were kind to accommodate and make it less sweet.

After visiting this cozy coffee shop in the Inner Sunset, my experience was nothing short of delightful!\n\nFirst of all, they have such a creative drink selection. From the rainbow-swirled Birthday Cake Latte to the Cookie Monster Latte topped with actual cookies, their whimsical coffee menu makes it hard to decide what to order. The insanely photogenic Birthday Cake Latte proved too hard to pass up. What a fun drink! I'm usually not a huge fan of sweet coffee drinks, but this one was sweet without being overly saccharine. It's pretty, tasty, AND topped with sprinkles -- what's not to love?! My friend ordered a regular latte and it was also delicious (as well as pretty). You can tell that the baristas put a lot of care and attention into crafting their lattes.\n\nBut what makes Home better than the typical trendy SF coffee shop is the genuine friendliness of the people who work there. I was asked how my day was going, the barista wanted to know if I liked my drink, and everyone who worked there was just so...nice. I'll take sincerity over apathy any day! With such beautiful lattes, I would have expected a bit more pretension. What a refreshing SF coffee experience! I'll definitely be back.", "author": "Elyse W."}

My friends and I had decided to come here on a whim, as they had heard much about the infamous Birthday Cake Lattes that Home was known for crafting.\n\nWalking in, Home was very aesthetically pleasing to the eye. To the right, adorned with hanging lights on the side, and the lit up name HOME, the atmosphere was very warm and inviting, yet very chic. To the left side of the wall, a wooden display held various bags of coffee from different locations, along with various types of succulents. The atmosphere of Home is calm and welcoming, with a very chill hipster vibe to it. Perfect for studying and getting work done, as it reminds me of a very modern but chill coffee house.\n\nThey also have WiFi (Just ask!), but also have tables where they have table markers that state some tables are 'Laptop free', where they ask that if you're sitting at a table with that particular table card, to respect the laptop free card and to talk to the person across from you instead. I know a lot of people personally don't care for these table markers, but I think it's actually kind of a sweet reminder to talk to the person you're with and not be so focused on your laptop. They also have tables facing the outside where it's laptop okay. HOME actually is a great place to study/get work done as well because of how calm/chill the atmosphere is.\n\nThe staff were extremely welcoming and kind as well helping my friends and I choose what to order despite coming slightly during their rush hour. They were also certainly accommodating when my friend asked if they can do different types of latte art on their drinks. While I certainly think and understand that the baristas are capable of latte art, I also think it depends on the skill of each latte barista, so please don't be too demanding on them although they can certainly try for your requests.\n\nI had ordered the infamous Birthday Cake Latte, and it certainly did not disappoint me aesthetically as well as the taste. Featuring the infamous rainbow latte art embellished with tiny rainbow sprinkles on the side, I was more than pleased with my drink, and I appreciated how although the drink looks like it would be overly sweet because of the Birthday Cake Latte name, it wasn't an explosion of sugar in my mouth, as I could still taste the notes of the smooth, enriched coffee swirled throughout my drink. Though I am certainly by no means any type of coffee snob, I was more than pleased with how my drink turned out to be.\n\nMy friend had also ordered a Birthday Cake Latte, which was equally as well received, and my other friend ordered a Mocha. As a proclaimed coffee snob, my friend had said that although it probably wasn't the best mocha she's had in her life (to be fair, she's had a lot of coffee to drink before though), she found her Mocha to be pleasantly smooth and she enjoyed it a lot as well.\n\nMy only downside and possible con that I could really think of when looking back at Home would be the wait time, but that also could be factored into the fact that I had come during the possible afternoon rush time. Finding an open available seat proved to be a challenge but I was able to find a place to sit with my friends after an allotted 10-15 minutes of standing and patiently waiting for people who had finished their drinks to leave.\n\nOverall I would definitely give Home two thumbs up for sure, and I would not hesitate to recommend for others to come and give it a try! I'd most definitely recommend giving the Birthday Cake Latte a try!", "author": "Allison O."}

Wow, and every once in a while you get that little jab of lavender aroma when you bite into the bits of lavender they sprinkle on top of this aromatic Latte.

We did struggle to find a table as there isn't that many here and most only seat two, which was good for us. The toasts were really pricey. I got the chicken meatball one?

God, I nearly teared up imagining this in my Instagram feed. It features rainbow latte art and funfetti; it tasted pretty similar to a red velvet latte, which also doesn't really taste like cake to me. \n\n-Special of the Day Toast (5/5): This had butter, corn, and bacon on brioche bread, and we added an egg on top. This was amazing! I've had toast from many cafes before, and this was honestly the best cafe toast I've ever had. The bread was perfectly toasted and amazingly buttery. I love that you can add an egg to any toast! I'm such a sucker for runny yolk.\n\nAll in all, I really hope I can come back here--I really loved this place!

I asked about the most popular drinks they have and decided to get the iced rose latte, as well as their Eggs in a Basket for lunch. \n\nThe iced rose latte was very pretty--put in an open mason jar with some rose petals to garnish. It was actually really delicious as well--creamy and sweet due to the condensed milk. The rose flavor was light and not overpowering. For about $5, it was pretty reasonable for a good drink as well as nice presentation. \n\nThe Eggs in a Basket was also really yummy. The toast was fluffy, buttery, and crispy. The slightly gooey egg in the center was also great because it soaked into the bread. While it was yummy and I might get it again for the taste, it was a little pricey at $6.75. \n\nThey have free wifi here, but even on a Monday it got a bit crowded, though people studying often don't mind sharing the other half of the table.

I wasn't a huge fan of the toast, but maybe I just got unlucky with it being overcooked. The creative coffees were the highlight for me and tasted just as good as they looked.

Davidson and afterward I asked him what he wanted to eat because hello- I'm hungry. He offered me two suggestions. Either go to Home on Noriega St. which was close by OR go to a coffee house somewhere in the Mission. I'm a total sucker for pretty aesthetics so I chose Home. When we got here around 130pm the place was crowded and all the tables were taken so I was a bit iffy on whether or not we were gonna be able to sit and chill or if we would have to take everything back to the car and chill.... well, safe to say we were able to sit down after ordering because some nice people left after finishing their work. \n\nParking on Noriega was tough on a Saturday afternoon. It was like everyone and their grandmas were out and about enjoying the nice sunshine so my boyfriend and I ended up circling a few times and on our last attempt at finding closer parking we saw a car pull out just outside of the cafe so score! Parking is metered Mon - Sat till 6pm so keep your eyes opened. \n\nTheir menu for this place isn't super extensive like I thought, mainly their food items. Their drink list is extensive and my boyfriend and I opted for their hazelnut latte, birthday cake latte, and the sweet condense toast I think that's what it is called. Food wise / drink wise - neither item took long to appear before we were able to sit down, take a few photos, post said photos, and then dig in while talking about what we had planned for the rest of the day.\n\nI don't recall prices. My boyfriend paid so... hehe. But we both enjoyed our drinks and I was worried that the birthday cake latte was going to be too sweet because of its name, but it's honestly just like a normal latte with added colors and sprinkles so it's a safe drink to drink without worrying about tooth aches. \n\nService is also friendly and they call out your name when your items are ready for pick up at the bar, except for the toast. A worker actually came through calling out my boyfriend's name and delivering the toast to our table which was neat. After all, how any Mark's can there be in the city right? \n\nOverall, down to come again.", "author": "Venus L."}

I hate to say it but my old soul can't take that much sweetness so I had to pass on that for an iced coconut vanilla latte. The coconut flavor definitely stood out and made the drink sweeter. It was a great variation of my go-to vanilla latte order so I'd probably get this again. \n\nMy friend and I order the eggs in a basket toast and YAS that was so good. It's basically an egg in a piece of toast that's topped with cheese and bacon. Um hello yes. I probably enjoyed it more than the latte lol. However that piece of toast was $7 sooo this place is not cheap. My friend and I ordered two lattes and that one toast and we spent about $20.

They have a fair amount of seating but it still gets very busy - after we'd ordered a line going out the door formed. \n\nMy only complaint is a vegan member of our party asked for almond milk and they mixed it with regular dairy milk.

I don't think the espresso is the strongest in this city, but it was definitely a fun & different way to enjoy coffee in this city that is packed with coffee shops.

The place was packed already and much cuter and hipster than I anticipated. When did the Sunset become so gentrified?! And when did people start their days so early (9 am) Sundays?! \n\nWe each got a slightly different drank: lavender latte, Holy cow, Birthday cake latte regular and one with almond milk. Aesthetically the Birthday cake latte takes the cake (almond milk is probably vanilla flavored since it was sweeter than the regular), but the Holy Cow with its luscious condensed milk was the most appealing since it was the sweetest and creamiest.\n\nThe baristas were very nice and not haughty in the least as I have now sadly come to expect from modern coffee shops. The clientele leaves much to be desired as people take up whole tables with their laptops or will defensively ask \"Why? Do you work here?\" when asked if they are vacating their tables. \n\nValue is average for an artisanal drink at about $5 each. They also have baked goods and breakfast items that I would not be averse to try in the future.\n\nWould not be a great place to study or expect to sit and chat with a group during peak hours but I would return if I was in the area for their cute and yummy drinks!", "author": "Angela L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-18", "description": "They always say, home is where the heart is. In this case, my heart took a trip out to the Sunset District in San Francisco where I got the pleasure of checking out a quaint yet modern coffee house/breakfast joint simply titled \"Home\". Actually, my fianc\u00e9e gets all the credit for finding this place on Yelp and after I saw the stellar reviews and pictures, we both agreed on checking this place out.\n\nSince we took the ferry into San Francisco, we had to rely on public transportation in getting us here. And it was a very simply trek. From the Ferry Building/Embarcadero area, we simply took the \"L Taravel\" streetcar, transferred to the \"28 19th Ave\" bus, and we were there. \"Home\" is located directly on Noriega St. and very close to busy 19th Ave. We arrived on the morning of Easter Sunday (4/16/17) at around 11:00am.\n\nOnce entering the business, I absolutely loved the ambiance, decor, and atmosphere as it had a chic, modern look to it. Much of it looked like it was out of an IKEA catalog but in a good way. There were several tables throughout as we saw a relatively young crowd (20 to 30-something demographics) engaging in coffee and conversation while many of them were glued to their laptops. Wi-Fi here is fast and efficient as this made browsing the web all the more better.\n\nAs far as the ordering process, you simply go up to the register, order your food and/or beverages, and you're set. There are separate menus for the drinks located on a unique rolling paper sheet while the food items are on a clear laminated sheet on a clipboard. Since we both wanted to take advantage of everything this place has to offer (as well as being hungry after traveling here from Sacramento), we both opted for savory breakfast items and espresso drinks. Seating is available as a first-come/first-serve basis. Luckily a few people left as soon as we finished ordering our items.\n\nMy drink of choice was a \"Chocolate Mint Latte\" while hers was something a little more elaborate, a \"Birthday Cake Latte\". As far as our breakfast items, I went for their \"Egg in a Basket\". This consisted of a fried egg on crispy buttered toast, ground pepper, and red pepper flakes. I also requested bacon crumbles and cheese for extra added flavor. She tried their \"Condensed Milk & Butter\" which essentially looked like French toast. Total price for everything, around $26.\n\nOur drinks come out first and I've got to say, this place hits a home run every way possible. My mint latte was absolutely delicious while not being overbearingly chocolatey. I tried my ladies' birthday cake latte and was astounded at the colorful artwork on top of her drink. Taste wise, it was also delicious while the sprinkles on top created more of a sweet flavor to it. My egg in a basket was much different than what I normally eat. I have to be honest that it was just okay for me as it didn't have that \"wow\" factor. The bacon bits definitely helped but it just wasn't fulfilling. I did like the buttery crumpet that accommodated my main entree though.\n\nOverall, \"Home\" is definitely worth checking out, especially for the eclectic variety of specialty coffee items they serve. The atmosphere, vibe, service, presentation, and cost factor all were above average. It does get loud in here so if you do plan on studying, do come prepared. This place definitely is unique but then again, you are in San Francisco where you must wow your customers. My overall rating for \"Home\", a solid four stars.", "author": "Donovan H."}

As a person who loves creamer more than coffee, the menu here of fun flavored lattes is an ideal one for me. \n\nThe only problem here: The customers. \nI know its in poor taste to rip on the customers of a business but Home should take some responsibility in enforcing thier own rules to make the experience a better one for customers. \n\nThey've got signs on every.single.table saying no laptop use permitted. What do you see at every single table? 100% of customers on laptops. 90% of them without any drinks. Taking up every single seat in the place, less the seats their bags are so selfishly taking up. \n\nThere's a line out the door and the entire place is taken up by people who aren't or are no longer patronizing them and blatantly breaking the very clear rule displayed on a sign at every table. Not sure why the staff at Home doesn't do more to enforce the rule, but let me tell ya, it was maddening to fight to find a seat to drink the stuff I paid for with the laptoppers who had nothing from the cafe on their table. \n\nHome: You need a electronics bouncer to come in and be the mean mom to these millennials and get them to realize that the world does not revolve around their need to stare at a screen and take up space. \n\nPeople Tempted To Use Your Laptops At Home: This is not your home. Read the rules, don't occupy space when you're no longer in the realm of patronizing the business, and don't be prick and think you're above the laptop rule. You're not special. The rules absolutely apply to you, me, and everyone else. \n\nEveryone: Go to Home, get their silly and incredible lattes and if you see someone on their laptop, it seems within your rights to verbally accost the jerks about it. Unless they're bigger than you, of course, then just think of all the stuff you'd like to say to them in your head and give them the side-eye of a lifetime.", "author": "Candice G."}

I've lived here for a few years but never tried them until recently. They have a simple yet elegant storefront which makes for very social media-worthy photos ;) they have a coffee menu and brunch menu ( different types of brick toast with toppings). Eggs in a basket looked tempting,  but I was won over by their pesto sauce in which I also added a fried egg on top. Simple yet delicious. \n\nI also ordered the birthday cake latte.

If you're not into coconut, honestly everything else is good, and their latte art is beautiful. The cinnamon toast at the Noriega location is also one of my favorites, although it's a little pricey at $5, its definitely worth it. \nAlso, not only is the coffee and toast delicious, but the service is amazing. The employees at both locations are super sweet and really willing to take time and explain each item on the menu to find the perfect drink or snack for you! \nNext time you're in the Sunset or Richmond districts, I highly recommend stopping by one of their locations. \n\nTo sum it up--they have super creative, delicious lattes with beautiful art, great aesthetics, and amazing employees. \n\nCheck Out This Link For More Details:\nhttp://spoonuniversity.com/place/san-francisco-home-cafe-review?utm_source=publishedemail&utm_medium=publishedemail&utm_campaign=publishedemail&utm_campaign=website&utm_source=sendgrid.com&utm_medium=email", "author": "Kelsey T."}

First time coming here  I had their lavender latte thought that was already original and good. Now, coming again tried their matcha and birthday cake lattes and must say this time totally one upped my last time coming here! \n\nFor the lattes: yes, just get the birthday cake latte! Such beautiful art work and I actually didn't think mine was too sweet or over powering. It honestly tasted like a very tasteful mocha to me rather than an overbearing sweet drink. My friend also ordered the matcha latte which was more of a subtle tea taste rather than coffee. So I did prefer the birthday cake latte over the matcha one. But if you just want something not too over powering or more tea like I totally recommend the matcha latte! \n\nFor the toasts: we got the tomato toast with an egg on the top and the chicken sausage toast. The chicken sausage toast was very filling. It was good and very herby like. The tomato toast was obviously less flavorful but more light weight and the egg we added paired well with it. I totally recommend both! \n\nOverall: this is such a cute coffee shop and great coffee too! Only down side is that parking is a hassle also finding a spot to sit you really have to have luck on your side. I heard you can also only sit for 2 hours... not sure if it's true or not. But in the end love this place and so excited for the new things they will come up with! Very impressed with everything so far.", "author": "Leslie F."}

There is a good amount of seating and, in addition, they recommend table sharing with others so that everyone can have a seat and enjoy their coffee.\n\nI've tried a couple of their drinks: The birthday cake latte (of course, I had to for the wonderful rainbow design), red velvet latte, lavender latte (both iced & hot), and most recently, their rose latte which is seasonal if I'm correct!\nI have never been let down by one of their lattes; the hot ones give the best mouth feel and have a nice amount of foam consistently, while the iced ones are the perfect pick-me-up on a warm day! If you're scared of the floral lattes, don't be! They are not overpoweringly floral or sweet, which I definitely appreciate as someone who is not fond of sweetness. Lattes range in price from $4-8, depending on if you get add-ons like soy milk or extra shots!\n\nFood-wise, my favorite is the egg in a basket, which is a fried egg in the middle of a crispy, buttery piece of toast with a hole in the middle. (Don't worry, the hole of bread comes on the side!) At $5, it is not super cost effective, but a lovely snack to go with your coffee for sure!\n\nOnly comment is that it is a little on the pricier side, but I have no doubt the price is worth the quality (food, service, environment)!

There were no empty tables, but the cashier told us that they do \"table sharing\", so if we see open seats, we could sit there. We ended up sharing a table with someone else and were able to get our work done while enjoying coffee and breakfast.\n\nAs for drinks and food, we got a soy matcha latte, soy hazelnut latte, chicken meatball and pesto toast, and a bacon and corn toast with an added egg. I really like how they let you customize the sweetness of your drink. Hazelnut latte was my favorite, slightly creamy with a prominent hazelnut flavor. The chicken meatball toast was the best out of the two toasts we ordered! The only downside was the knife they gave us was really dull and we had a hard time cutting up our toast. \n\nService was A+, super friendly and they also helped clear our plates after we were finished. I can't wait to come back to try some of the other drinks, this place is super cute! \n\nMy tip: If you're planning to do some work, I recommend coming early on the weekends since it's like a battle to get a table (people were grabbing chairs and tables left and right lol) and the line was practically nonstop!", "author": "Cecille W."}

Home, a local neighborhood coffee shop in the Sunset district, is one of the best places to go to for just that. Not only is their coffee delicious, it's almost too pretty to drink. Home brews De La Paz coffee, which is really good! My favorite is their lavender latte. It's not too sweet and you can definitely taste the lavender flavor throughout. I also love how they sprinkle lavender pieces on top, which makes the latte art so much prettier. I also tried the coconut vanilla latte, which was tasty, but a tad too sweet for me.\n \nWhat draws me the most about this coffee shop is the gorgeous, Instagramable latte art. It's usually different variations of the heart or sometimes a bear, but from the matcha latte to the lavender latte to the red velvet latte...each one is unique in color, which makes the drinks even more beautiful. Recently, I discovered their most beautiful latte, which is the Birthday Cake latte. It has rainbow colors and sprinkles throughout the design...super gorgeous!\n\nFood - not only are the drinks Instagramable, the food is definitely Instagram-worthy as well. Home sells a variety of toasts from sweet to savory that make an excellent snack with your coffee. They range from about $4-$7 per slice with additional add-ons available (fried egg and bacon). A little bit pricey for toast, but they are usually on-point with presentation. \n\nCons - not the place to go to for coffee when you are in a hurry, crowded, hard to get a table, closes early. Also, I asked for my latte for here and they put it in to-go cups.\n\nHome is a very cute, small coffee shop located near the corner of 19th and Noriega. The staff is friendly, the decor is simple and modern, and WIFI is available. Parking can be a challenge, but apparently it hasn't stopped anyone from coming because most of the tables are usually taken by people with their Macbooks.

When you get here it's easily recognizable because the sign can be seen and they also have parking on the street. Although street parking seems bad, it's really not hard to find parking for this coffee shop. \n\nWhen walking in you get a sense of \"home\" and maybe it's because the environment is cool and decorated with a lot of things that make you think of home. They have creative pictures on the wall that depict home whether it be by the shelves they have with books, pictures that say \"home is where the heart is\" or just the warm welcoming when you walk in. \n\nWhat I like about this place is they have menus that tell customers what they offer in terms of coffee, tea and pastries if you have to wait in line. But they also have two big \"scrolls\" that list their drinks too! It's unique compared to other coffee shops. What makes this place unique is that they offer a variety of coffee and tea such as : birthday cake, Cookie Monster, hangover and chocolate mint latte. \n\nThey have a lot of seating where they could seat a total of 35-40 people! Just to let you guys know though, they do have tables that have a sign that says laptops are not allowed on the table. \n\nI would have to say that there were only two people working the front so it took awhile to get your coffee because only one person was actually making the coffee. When I ordered my coffee it took almost 10 minutes to get it and I think it is because there was only one person making the coffee. Since there were only two people working the front, the person not making the coffee sometimes had to help serve the coffee or pastry so those waiting in line had to wait until she came back. What I like about this place though is that the staff is super nice. They legit being your food, drinks and utensils to you which most coffee shops do not do.  \n\nThe only downfall about this place I would have to say is that they have one bathroom so if you need the bathroom you got to wait in line.

They have it down to a science since most people are ordering latte's with designs and within 2 minutes we were served. \n\nWe tried \n*Red Velvet Latte - Not as sweet as I thought it would be, it's rich and strong.\n*Birthday Cake - Everyone's got to have it once right? I like this one better than the red velvet, because it wasn't as strong. \n*Condensed Milk Toast - It was good, if you're a fan of condensed milk then it's probably a homerun you. But since it is condensed milk on top, it isn't as crispy as other options they have. \n*Eggs in a Basket - My favorite between the two. A nice runny egg inside the toast, smothered with bacon bits on top. \n\nI'm impressed with HOME, sometimes pictures are deceiving because the stuff looks so good it builds up expectation and sets the bar high. But the presentation matches the product. These guys take pride in latte's being an art. \n\nOnly thing I would like to see is the menu expand.

Just because you had a distorted expectation does not mean this place did not live up to standards. I am specifically referring to those reviews here that talk about how the birthday cake latte does not taste like birthday cake and thus it's a bad rating ... I am not sure that it say \"tastes like birthday cake,\" what it says is that it is a vanilla spiced latte. It tasted exactly like that.\n\nI honestly felt bad for the owner who had to disclaim to me when I wanted to order it that it doesn't taste quite like birthday cake it was just a fun name and looks like one. I don't feel like this is necessary.\n\nHome SF is amazing. From their vast offerings of unique lattes, flavors, ice cream and desserts to their SUPER clean and well kept interior space, it is everything I could have not imagined being on Clement in Outer Richmond. This place is hip beyond its neighbors for sure. \n\nYes, I got the birthday cake latte, yes I got it for the grams ... and guess what? I actually also enjoyed it! So rare to be able to gram something cool and ALSO find it tasty. Yes it isn't a nitro cold brew, weighed gram by gram to perfection flat white with chestnut finish and notes of lavender, but it was damn good for what it was. \n\nYou'll find laptop city here, and they do have wifi which is nice.

I was greeted by the barista at the counter who said, \"Hi, Welcome Home!\" He asked me how my day was going, and made some small talk, which made me feel really welcomed and comforted. He noticed that I was a first timer and recommended some of their top creative cups and toast. I went with their most popular: lavender latte (added almond milk) & tomato, truffle oil, pesto toast (added egg). \n\nA cup of coffee + toast came out to about $15, which may cause some reluctance, but I was more than satisfied with my order. I was hesitant to get the lavender latte because I was afraid the floral taste would over power the espresso. I was reassured by the first sip. Mmmm.. There was a hint of lavender mixed with a rich espresso taste, topped with frothy foam and dried lavender leaves. No wonder it's one of the most popular drinks. I underestimated the size of the tomato, truffle, pesto, egg toast. It was very filling! \n\nThis place has so much potential with a creative theme. I wish they had a larger, more spacious venue because it was pretty packed. I was lucky enough to get a table to myself, but at least 4 other people asked if they could share a table with me. I didn't mind the new company, but I was a little embarrassed that my laptop, notebook, pencil bag, and cup of coffee were taking up 90% of the table. So much for sharing, lol oops. I would also suggest some pillows on the benches to really captivate the whole \"home\" theme. They really should get some extension cords too since everyone brings their laptops and the location of outlets is scarce. \n\nOverall, I love their service, creative cups and the throwback 2000's jams they were slappin. I would come here to study, although it can get a little noisy. Nothing like a pair of headphones to fix that problem. Best of all, they have fast wifi despite everyone being on it.

The menu is written on a huge pull down brown paper scroll, much like a classroom or art studio. A few tables have succulents.\n\n--SEATING-- There's a window bar and long wall of tables. It's rather small (and popular) so it may be difficult to snag a seat.\n\n--MENU-- The menu has a great array of coffees and teas. They also have a toast section if you're feeling hungry. I like how they have a creative section, where the coffees are a little spunkier. \n\nCoconut Vanilla Latte ($3.75): This is the best latte I've ever had. It's sweet from the vanilla, and aromatic from the coconut and coffee. It's a house favorite, and now I know why. You have a choice of milk, but whole milk is the only complimentary milk choice. Soy milk, for instance, is extra.\n\nDrinks are served in porcelain cups if it's not for to-go. (They accidentally gave it to me in a to-go cup, however). They naturally do latte art, too.\n\n--OVERALL-- If I was from SF, I'd definitely go here for a good study grind and cup of coffee. I wish they didn't charge extra for the milk, though.

If you're a latte art lover like me, you know a picture is worth a thousand words. Annie (the nicest cashier/barista I've ever met) went above and beyond to make sure I was satisfied with my order. I had ordered my drink to drink there but they gave it to me in the to-go cup since they ran out of mugs. Annie knew I was looking forward to take pictures of the latte art so she came up to my table and let me know that when they get more clean mugs washed she would have them re-make my drink.

I ordered the birthday cake latte and tomato cheese toast w/ pesto, and my friend ordered the hazelnut latte.\n\nMy first impression was that the place was super cute and aesthetic. It's a nice place to hang out with friends and grab coffee. The only thing I would change is the amount of tables; we were scared we weren't going to get a seat when our lattes were ready. \n In addition, our order actually got lost and I had to ask them if they were making it (after waiting for 20 minutes). They apologized and one of the guys working was nice enough to offer us a toast on the house. He was super sweet! But I didn't get to catch his name.\n\nBut anyways, the lattes and toast were good!\n\nBirthday cake latte 10/10, the guy even made my latte art 10x better than I thought it was going to be - it was a swan instead of a typical heart/Rosetta.\n\nTomato cheese toast - 11/10. It was expensive but so worth it. Savor every bite because I promise you will miss it once it's gone.\n\nChicken meatball w/ pesto - 7/10. We got this on the house and wished we ordered another tomato cheese toast. The meatballs were a bit too salty for me but the pesto was solid.\n\nOverall, this place is definitely one to check out if you're in the city.

I've been to Home a couple of times now and it's always been quite pleasant. The location is nice for all of us Sunsetters because it's a decent coffeeshop..in Sunset. LOL. Parking is easy because it's in Sunset. The cafe itself is very spacious, plenty of seating, well-lit, and there is an ample amount of power outlets. However, I will say that they sometimes play the music TOO loud for a cafe LOL. I go here to do work and I usually listen to music from my headphones so I don't really need to hear more music blasting in the background on top of that, especially since they don't play like normal coffeeshop music all the time (sometimes it gets a little like R&B vibey/too much going on and not so much acoustic chill, let me sip my coffee and be a burrito blanket type of music, ya know what I mean?)  \n\nThe coffee is decent. I've gotten a cappuccino, a nutella latte, and tried their drip coffee and I gotta say hipster coffee is hipster coffee. It's pricy for a cup of joe, but you pay for the atmosphere I guess? The hipsterness? LOL. The actual quality of the coffee is decent. I've had better. But it's definitely not bad, it's decent. The food here is tasty also. They have a lot of different toast combinations and all the ones I've tried are very good. However, once again it's pricy but tasty. I think that's why I'm not head over heels for this place. The fact that it's so overpriced for what it is. It's easy to spend ~$10 here just for a piece of toast and caffeine. But sigh. That's SF for ya! Anyways, overall I like this coffee shop.

When I walked in, several friendly faces greeted me and welcomed me \"home.\"  Brilliant, right? Anywho, the boyf and I hit up their cafe at 9:30 on a Monday, and it was BUSTLING. \n\nI've been obsessed with Home for months now! I stumbled upon their instagram and knew I just HAD to try their lattes and toast.  After studying their menu for a while, my boyfriend and I decided to get three lattes and two toasts.  I wanted to get insta-worthy shots (obviously) so I went with the more creative concoctions, but everything sounded awesome, and I have no doubt they would've looked just as beautiful.  I was tempted by the lavender and matcha lattes, but I ultimately decided to order the birthday cake, cookie monster, and nutella lattes.\n\nAll three drinks looked AND tasted totally amazing. Although I loved them all, my fave was the birthday cake drank.  At first glance, I thought it'd be too sweet, but it was perfect in every way.  I half expected unicorns to appear and dance around me as I sipped my coffee by the window, ha.\n\nTheir toast was bomb as well.  They were several delish options available so it was a tough decision, but we decided to try one savory and one sweet.  I can't remember the exact names, but I'll describe 'em to y'all so you know exactly what to get.  \n\nThe first one had egg, tomato and pesto and the second was drenched with condensed milk... or should I say magical condensed milk?  I mean, these were ridiculously nomtastic.  I didn't think they could top drinks, but honestly, I think I enjoyed the food even more than the coffee.  The texture of the toast was amazeballs, and both flavor profiles were out of this world.  The condensed milk was weirdly addicting - I could've easily devoured 2 (or maybe 3) of these babies!

I have passed by here so many times heading to 19th ave to get to school but today I had to grab a latte. \n\nI have been to Green Bamboo, which is next door a couple times and every time I go there I always want to grab a cup of java from Home. \n\nMost of my friends have been to Home and they always talk about the lavender lattes here. I always thought it was just a myth about how good the lattes are here but I was proven wrong today.\n\nAs I entered Home today the first thing I noticed was the lighting inside. It was not overly dark nor bright but balanced enough to where the seated customers could do work on their laptops and read their books. It seems like the crowd that then to come here are college students and young business professionals. There are several tables and some window seating as well. There is enough room that you can maneuver around this place and not bump into tables or other customers.\n\nI went to the counter to review the menu and they offer coffee, espresso drinks, and a few pastries as well. I knew I was ordering the lavender latte but I also wanted to get something sweet but not too much to go along with my drink. One of the items that they offer is toast. Now, the toast that they offer here is not just your ordinary toast out of the toaster. They have toast that comes with various spreads. The item that jumped off the menu was the Condensed milk toast! I had no idea what I was in for but it was definitely excited for it based on the name. \n\nAfter placing my order I waited for a short time for my order to be prepared. There is a very relaxing vibe that it present here. Unlike Starbucks, there is no infestation of customers and excessive laptops and cell phone chatter. Instead, there an inviting and warming atmosphere that is reflected in the staff and business. There is a want and desire to find a place to sit while here and enjoy your food or drink. \n\nOnce my food was finally ready I was on my way. I opened my food container with my toast as soon as I got to my car. Let me just say that I was ecstatic for my toast and my latte. The toast looked some warm and fresh that I had to take a bite. My first bite of this toast was like tasting ice cream for the first time. I knew that I was going to like it but I did not know that I was going to LOVE IT. The toast was soft, flavorful, sweet, and a bit creamy. Just an abundance of flavors bursting from this one piece of toast. The reviews about this place are truly right on. The toast here is clearly life changing because I am now a HUGE fan of this place.\n\nAs for the lavender latte, the aroma of the latte is relaxing but there was nothing overly extravagant about the drink. I liked the taste and the balance of espresso to the milk and foam in the drink but it was alright. I get the allure of this particular drink but it doesn't necessarily blow me away like the toast. \n\nI would have to say that HOME knows how to cater to the local demographic. In being a cafe in the Sunset district their menu seems to be geared towards 20 and 30 year olds. I could almost see this place as a smart cafe if that was the direction that they wanted to take here. The setup here is already somewhat reflective of a smart cafe but either way this cafe is a reflection of the community around it. \n\nThey make good lattes and AMAZING toast.

I really like their decor; feels comfortable. You have the window bar seat, tables, and pillows to sit on if you're by the wall. They have string lights and light up letters HOME. There are succulents on the tables and shelf. Their menu looks like a scroll so that's creative. You'll only see the available drinks on the wall; the toasts are by the counter.\n\nLines are long. I arrived [at] Home around 11am and the line was by the door. It was a 20-30 minute wait to get to the counter. Once at the counter, you tell the nice young lady what you would like to order. There's a nice selection of lattes and toast you could choose from. I ordered Iced Hazelnut Latte, Iced Coconut Vanilla Latte, Egg in a Basket Toast, Tomato Truffle Oil Pesto Toast, and Chicken Meatball with Pesto Toast. I swear it was shared. I'm not fat :(\n\nIced Hazelnut Latte - Too much latte, not enough hazelnut. I think I expected more of a nutella drink but sadly, it wasn't.\n\nIced Coconut Vanilla Latte - I liked this one because it was a heavy coconut flavor. It was the right amount of sweetness too. I would recommend this one if you like coconut and sweet drinks.\n\nEgg in a Basket with Bacon - This was good. It's a little bit on the plain side without the bacon IMO.\n\nTomato Truffle Oil Pesto - Loooove pesto. This had a lot of flavor and it was sooo yummyyy.\n\nChicken Meatball with Pesto - hands down, my FAVORITE of the 3 toasts I tried. The meatball was soooooooo taaaastttttyyyyyyy.

The barista recommended trying one of their most popular latte's, The Birthday Cake Latte. It was presented very nicely and appealing to the eye, but not very fond of the taste. It tasted like a regular latte but sweeter than usual (I'm not a big fan of super sweet drinks). My boyfriend ordered the Pesto Chicken toast with an egg on top and the hazelnut iced latte. I liked the hazelnut Latte better than mine, very refreshing and tasted very good, not too sweet and not too bitter. I recommend that one instead. The toast was very thick of bread, and the chicken was okay. Not worth the $7.50 price on my opinion. Overall, I like their motto and the ambience, very hipster and cute. I'd go with their iced lattes better than the hot ones. I would go again but this time go with their iced drinks.", "author": "Joscelynne R."}

I really hope they consider putting some shades here because the sun makes those seats almost unusable. I ended up making a small jacket fortress just so I could see my laptop screen (and to prevent my laptop from overheating). There's also no outlets for the front half of the cafe Parking is metered out front and there seems to be spots available around the block. Service is also very very nice and attentive.\n\nAll that being said, Home is still a great study spot and dishes out some seriously tasty toast and coffee. I also appreciate that they have cold water out for self-serve. I got 2 drinks: a hot lavender latte and an iced mint chocolate latte. For toast I got the chicken meatball pesto and the tomato truffle oil. Both with an added egg on top.\n\nThe lavender latte was delicious and gorgeous too look at. The lavender is distinct but not overpowering and I'm glad it's not too sweet. I wish the espresso was a bit stronger though. The iced mint chocolate latte was also good but got boring fast. It's also a very light drink that tastes like nothing after a while. It's still very refreshing though.\n\nThe chicken pesto toast is what you should go for if you're looking for something closer to a meal. I was starving so it wasn't quite enough but it's a good size for a light lunch. It has a slight sweetness with all the spices and it's quite tasty. However between the meatballs and the tomato toast I preferred the tomato. I usually don't tomatoes that have a raw edge to them and truffle oil is always a bit iffy depending on how a place uses it but I really did enjoy the combination. I would definitely get this again. No matter what savory toast you get I highly suggest topping it with an egg. It's fried perfectly and really makes the meal that much more perfect.\n\nOverall, Home is a fantastic spot to get some work done and enjoy a light snack.", "author": "Vivian C."}

They have gotten more tables and seating and I've noticed they even hired more staffing to help out with the increasing business. The owners are also a very sweet, welcoming and friendly couple! \n\nThe menu is creatively hung on the left side of the wall upon entering. The non-coffee drinks are on the left of the wall, and the coffee menu is on the right towards the cashier. I've enjoyed the coconut vanilla latte (although they could have been more lighter on the sweetness, it was delicious), the matcha green tea latte and the holy cow latte (condensed milk!). I personally would have to pass on the salted caramel latte and London fog latte (earl grey with vanilla). \n\nOf the two thick toasts (Condensed milk toast and Tomato, truffle oil & pesto toast) that I've tried, they were both absolutely delicious! The condensed milk toast was buttery, sweet and creamy. The tomato, truffle oil & pesto toast was flavorful, had great texture and also buttery! I would order those two again as well as look forward to trying the others. \n\nWith increasing business, getting a table may be hard depending on what day and time you go, so just be mindful about that! This place has free wifi and I believe they have outlets near almost every table. It's a great place to study, get some work done or simply catch up with a friend or loved one!", "author": "Kris C."}

The small cafe is brightly lit with ample natural lighting. The decor is simple and modern with the beverage menu written on a scroll next to the wall. The food menu is separate and available at the register. This place is self-service so order at the counter and pick up when its ready. \n\nNote that seating is tough because of the smalls pace and its popularity. The laptop working area is revered to certain tables so if you're planning to settle in for the long haul, be aware. At first I was thrown off by this, but I definitely see the practicality since seating is limited and this is a popular spot for coffee goes of all kinds. \n\nThe coffee is delicious with a nice variety of more traditional drinks and their creative drinks that are so Instagram worthy/famous. Feeling not too adventurous, but not too simple I opted for the Lavender Latte and did not regret. The coffee is subtle, sweet, and fragrant. I also go the chicken meatball toast, which took a little longer than the advertised 5-15 minutes. It kind of reminded me of the sweet chicken meatballs you get at Costco on thick cut butter and onion toast. It was good, but I don't think it was worth the price and the wait.Although I probably wouldn't order the food again, I would definitely come back for the coffee.", "author": "Jen V."}

My friend ordered the Lavender Latte and the Chicken Meatball and Garlic Toast. The toast was thick, and basically an open faced sandwich. Very hearty and tasty! The chicken meatballs were very flavorful and I actually liked it better than the one I ordered. Both of the lattes were very good in their own way, and I could not even force myself to choose which one I like better because they're both great! They also came with cute latte art, and the lavender latte even had some lavender garnished on top for aesthetics. \n\nThe only downfall to this place, is that it closes early at 5 pm!

The people come in second - they're so nice and remember you even after you've only been there once or twice, perfect for a neighborhood caf\u00e9! And there is wifi. Because of these three things, this has become one of my top 3 cafes to do work in the Richmond. \n\nI also know that everyone else is obsessed with the toast - especially the Avocado Toast Sampler, which includes their Br-Avo, Seoul Much Avo & Let's Avo-Cuddle toasts (have you gotten the hint that this place is cute?). I tried it during my first visit and wasn't super into any of them. So far, the only spot that gets expensive toast right in my opinion is The Mill but that's an unfair bar to judge them against. So while I'm personally not a fan of their toast selection, there's a 90% chance you as an avocado loving millennial will love it. \n\nTheir baristas are also very skillful and they serve De La Paz coffee (the sister brand of Four Barrel).

I usually wake up pretty late, so I haven't had a chance to try it since they close pretty early. \nI came during the perfect weather too! The place felt especially cozy since it was raining. The interior was a lot bigger than I had expected. There are tables next to the wall with outlets that are perfect for studying, bigger tables for bigger groups, and also seats next to the window. I just love the way the interior is designed and how everything is arranged! \n\nWhen I saw the menu, I was a bit surprised. I probably looked at an older picture of the menu but I didn't think the toasts would've went from $4.50 to $6.50 in such a short time. The lattes were also a dollar more than I had expected. :( I ordered the organic matcha latte and eggs in a basket toast. I'm always a bit scared when I order matcha at a new place because there's always the fear that it's not authentic matcha. However, the server asked me how sweet I wanted it and that reassured me. Most places, if any at all, won't ask you for the sweetness level of a matcha latte. Moreover, he told me that their matcha was organic so the bitterness of it was strong. Thus, I got lightly sweet. \n\nThey bring the food and drinks to your seat, so you don't have to go pick it up. That's some great service. Of course, they were very friendly and helpful too. Moreover, they pick up your plates and cups when you're done too! If they don't, make sure to bring it back to bin to save them some work.\n\nI was a bit disappointed when the toast came. It was a lot smaller than I had expected for $6.50 and the egg looked like it was fully cooked. However, once I started eating it, I really enjoyed it. The buttery toast was very soft, similar to the brick toast you might have had at Asian dessert places. When I finally got to slicing the egg, it was still runny! I love my eggs with yoke.The only downside to this was that it was too salty for me. I couldn't eat it without drinking anything. \n\nI was super excited to get my matcha latte. Getting latte art is always fun and something to look forward to. The taste was perfect! It was probably one of the best matcha lattes I've had, and if any one knows me, they know how high my standards for matcha are. Good thing I had it lightly sweetened otherwise it would've been too sweet for me. The matcha was so strong that some of it dried and stuck to the mug! The matcha flavor was very well defined. I might have to ask where they get their matcha haha. I would definitely come back for the matcha latte, but I would ask them to make it extra hot next time because it was already cold by the time I had drank it. \n\nIn conclusion, I would definitely come back here! Whether it's for the food or the ambiance. I really want to try all their toasts and lattes.l even though they're quite pricey. They're all so unique and sound so good. I'm thinking about getting the lavender or red velvet latte and the chicken meatball toast the next time I come.", "author": "Tina P."}

Toast.\" And on and on until I finally caved today and came here to get a bit of studying done.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n2/2 Stars for Taste -- \nKeep in mind, this rating is based purely on the lavender latte. It's definitely a top contender for the most instagrammable cup of coffee, with its latte art splendor and real lavender dashed artfully across the top. I'm not a huge fan of lavender, but I was pleasantly surprised. Not too sweet, and the lavender taste was subtle. At one point, I'm like, I wonder if I'm supposed to eat the lavender. DON'T. Potpourri in my mouth. My friend was sitting across from me and had to take a moment to laugh out loud at the horror and regret in my eyes. \n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value -- \nAt $4.50 a cup, this is definitely SF-priced coffee. But I guess if I think about it, a cup of boba sets me back about the same. Still, this isn't something I'd dish out for everyday, maybe a treat yo'self splurge. \n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service -- \nFriendly and fast service with a smile. The wifi is fast and the natural sunlight of this place makes it a great place for studying. There is a courtesy two hour limit for table space, but it was pretty empty when I was here, so they didn't really enforce this policy. Also, they encourage patrons to share tables, which I think is adorable. FUTURE HUSBAND, PLEASE COME SHARE MY TABLE.\n\nBonus star because I would definitely be back to try their other novelty coffees. There's a condensed milk latte and red velvet latte that I have my eye on. Sweet, sweet diabetes in a cup. \n\nTL;DR: Good study spot. Try the lavender latte.", "author": "Abby W."}

I stumbled upon this location and the red velvet latte and toasts really caught my eye. \n\nUpon arriving, I realized that this was previously the sister soju place of Tonight Soju. Now it's a really comfy-looking, study cafe. There's tons of seating and tons of students here that come here for study sessions with their buddies. All of the tables are separate, but they're used as communal tables.\n\nWe ordered an affogato, red velvet latte, and the  (#2) condensed milk toast. I thought the affogato was decent, but a little too sweet. The red velvet latte was VERY red velvet in taste, but not very much of a pick me up. I think that you should pass on this if you want something a bit stronger. I really liked the toast. It's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  \n\nI think I will definitely be back. It's in a very convenient location for me and it has a lot of variety. (I will be back to try the lavender latte!)", "author": "Lyra C."}

The decor is simple and sleek, with scroll-style menus, string lights, and succulents on each table. Very hip and modern feel to this place.\n\nThe toast is to die for! They're a tad bit on the oily side but just so darn comforting and tasty. I've tried the chicken meatball and pesto which is delicious!! Even better with a fried egg on top, which is cooked with a perfectly runny yolk. The eggs in a basket is also equally as scrumptious. I want to try the sweet toasts in the future; the condensed milk and cinnamon toasts sound so good!! \n\nThe coffee is pretty good too, albeit a little on the sweet side. I've only tried the creative drinks - the lavender latte and the chocolate mint latte. The lavender latte is excellent, with bits of lavender sprinkled on top. The chocolate mint was a little too sweet for me, but next time I'll ask them to adjust the sweetness. \n\nThe staff is super personable and friendly here and always refer to me by name. Home is a perfect place to study or to catch up with a friend. The wifi is fast and works great! Also love that they play old school r&b here..

Sweeter than any of the ex-bfs I ever had. HAHAHA *lame joke alert*\n\nImagine TRYING to telling a friend you're going here. \nFriend: are you going out?\nYou: yeah\nFriend: where?\nyou: Home. \nFriend: i thought you said you were going out???\nYou: i am. I'm going Home. \n \nHAHAHAHHA. No? ok... I'll stop.\n\nBefore you boo me for the 3 stars hear me out first. This 3 star will be temporary. Will be back to try other things and re-rate if deemed respectable. My friend's neighbor opened this place up and she's been telling me to try it out. Didn't hit me it was the place until I was inside of it. \n\nThe cashiers were uber adorable and sweet. Walked into a modern/hipster looking cafe with tables filled up of people on their laptops or people chilling with friends over coffee. Cashier recommended the toasts and said the special of the day was good so we listened to her advice.\n\nBacon & Corn Toast: Exactly what it is. Corn and Bacon smeared all over the toast submerged in a layer of cheese. Maybe I didnt pick the right toast? I thought it was just ok. Usually I die for bacon because I had my first bacon when I was 21. So.... anything bacon is heaven. But the dish fell short for me. Should I not be expecting more? Should it taste just as salty? Just as dry? I don't know. \n\nWas not in the mood for coffee or latte, so my friend, Lauren C., got the coconut juice. They just cut the coconut up and VOILA.... FRESH COCONUT JUICE EVERYONE! Very refreshing.\n\nThe tables all looked full so the waitress kindly guided us to tables with only one person so we could share the other half. It was very cozy to say nonetheless. But i felt bad because my friend and I were just having a convo and the person in front of us had their laptop up and studying. Soooo we didn't stay long.  \n\nUPDATE 11/1/15: \nUpgraded from 3 to 4 stars. As promised I came back to try everything out again. Stellar customer service. I actually studied here from 9:25AM to 3:00pm. No mean looks, no rush from the employees to kick me out. I actually felt like being home and super productive. \n\nHoly Cow (condensed milk latte $3.75): She sold me at condensed milk when the cashier was making recommendations. I'm not a strong coffee lover person, so this was perfection. Sweet but enough kick of caffeine to make me do work. (i'm the kind that never drinks caffeine so when I have a sip of some i get super jittery and hyped). Super good flavors!\n\nCondensed milk toast ($3.50): Sounds simple right? Toast with condensed milk? I actually grew up with this and my mom would make before school. Loved the combination and brought back a lot of childhood flashbacks. If youre not too into sweet, I probably would not recommend this.\n\nMatcha Latte (idk the price b/c my friend got it for me): Super good! I LOVE matcha so it was a wonderful combination. It wasnt too bitter but not too overly sweet. Got the matcha flavors balanced with latte. \n\n-Great wifi, comfy benches to sit on or chairs while studying, outlets at every other seating.

They serve basic drinks such as the usual mocha, latte, cappuccino, americano, etc. and they also serve specialty drinks such as lavender latte, red velvet latte, coconut vanilla latte, etc. I've tried their lavender latte and I really liked it.

After some tough deliberation, I settled on their Red Velvet Latte which came bright red and was artfully crafted to be silky and subtly sweet. \n\nMy only issues for this place though were the snarky customer service and the people knowingly just hogging the tables without any drinks, especially individuals who would take up an entire large table. \n\nOther than that, this quaint cafe is cutely decorated and invitingly cozy, making it the perfect stop for a drink in the Sunset.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-03-09", "description": "I've been here about 3 times now and I must say this is definitely one of my favorite cafes in SF. Depending on the day and time, you can either get a seat the second you get there or end up having to wait around to find a seat. However, they encourage you to share tables which is really great if you're a social butterfly. From my experience, I've gone here one time expecting to stay about a half hour or so, but I actually ended up staying for about 2 hours talking to this couple that one of my friends and I met. If you don't feel like waiting for a seat you can always take the drinks to go! \n\nSeating aside, the food is definitely delicious and they have a variety of drinks and toast to choose from. Yup, TOAST! From their toast options, I've tried (and nibbled from what my friends order) the cinnamon sugar toast, the eggs in a basket (with bacon YUM), and the chicken meatball with pesto and a fried egg on top. The first time I had eggs in a basket I thought it was buttery and seasoned well. One critique I have about it though was that the egg whites were mostly cooked (they still had a little bit of translucency) but not to the standard I usually like to have my eggs. After that first time though it's been cooked well and it tasted especially scrumptious with bacon added on top of it. The cinnamon sugar toast, from what I remember, wasn't too sweet and something I think I should try again soon. I had the chicken meatball toast most recently and it's the most filling out of the others I had because of all the ingredients in it especially the fried egg. The fried egg however was a bit chewy on the thinner edges of it because I think it got cold so the fried ends just didn't keep its crispiness. Other than that though I would say the toast is something to try out, especially for that oozing egg. \n\nNow, onto the highlight and main reason why Home cafe is so popular: LATTES! I've only tried two of their lattes from their menu: the lavender latte and cookie monster latte. The lavender latte definitely has a subtle lavender taste so it's not overpowering at all. The baristas add a little bit of lavender flowers on the very top which make for an aesthetically pleasing photo for social media. It's pretty but I like to scoop them out after taking a dozen photos so I don't have bits of lavender floating in my mouth. The cookie monster latte is my ultimate favorite latte. It's one of the more expensive lattes (next to the birthday cake latte) but the price is equivalent to a frappuccino from Starbucks. I gotta tell you though, if I didn't control myself I would've downed the cookie monster latte in one go. They use cookie butter in this latte and it just fills your tastebuds with a sweet, buttery, and cookie like taste. In addition, they add little bits of cookies in your latte which melt into the latte and make the drink all that much better. \n\nOverall, Home is a really nice and small cafe. The place is on the small side and sometimes you may have to wait (unless you're lucky like I have). The service is really nice the the past few times the person at the register is always super social and friendly.", "author": "Emily T."}

Today I had the \"Birthday Cake\" which was deliciously sweet, but more than anything, amazing to look at. Previous to that, I enjoyed one of their teas. One could argue that both of those choices are probably not the best representations of their coffee/espresso, but both of the things I got were absolutely yummy and I would 100% recommend. The only thing about this business is that is getting too popular for its size.

While the drink came out fast, the actual service was a bit slow. I loitered a good 5 minutes before even being greeted - a tiny snafu, if you ask me. I was also interested in trying the toast, but couldn't bring myself pay the price asked; it's pretty steep at $6+, even for \"artisan\" toast. \n\nAs for the ambiance, it is definitely a place that I would like to be able to sit and catch up with friends, but I'm not sure if there would ever be a seat for me.\n\nCase in point:\n\nThe group before me was a group of three women, one with a small child.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-18", "description": "It's about time! Finally, a reasonably-sized coffeehouse in the city with friendly service, delicious food, and a coffee & tea menu that goes beyond a simple latte and fancy pour-over coffee. Let me explain... \n\nHome serves De La Paz coffee so there's definitely upscale, artisanal coffee on the menu. But nowadays, it seems San Francisco is oversaturated with cafes tailored only for coffee purists. Sometimes you just want to lounge at a place that has good coffee without the pretension. And sometimes artisanal coffeehouses in the city seem to attract customers who are too cool for school. Home is, well, homey! You can have the Iggy Azalea \"fancy\" coffee without the attitude or \"trying-too-hard\" environment. On top of that (as kitschy it may be to some), I occasionally enjoy flavored lattes. Their iced lavender latte is particularly lovely. It has a slightly floral profile, but the espresso is still very present --- silky and luxurious in the milk. \n\nTheir chicken meatball toast is so on point! I wanted to scarf down the whole thing, but I realized this was something worth eating very slowly. The meatballs are especially tasty: savory (as it should be!), but also with a subtle sweetness. Did I mention there's a thick layer of cheese?! Also, this toast (like all of them on the menu) are knife-and-fork situations. These aren't meant to be eaten by hand: 1) because of the size of the toast and 2) you lose the delicacy of the \"fancy\" toast by not eating it with precision. \n\nThe baristas and other workers are very friendly. I mean, they actually LOOK and SOUND happy. That's a great sign. If the front of the house has good energy, I'll assume folks in the back are equally satisfied working there. After all, this place is called \"Home\" -- it better be stable and warmly like a true \"home.\" So far, it seems to emulate these traits.\n\nThe space itself isn't necessarily \"homey\" in the conventional sense. I expected very cozy seating and design, but the interior is quite modern and simple. That's not to say \"modern and simple\" can't be homey, but usually the aesthetics of \"modern and simple\" are design-focused rather than utility-driven. All in all, the set-up is perfect for working/studying though many customers come in with friends or family for a quick coffee catch-up. Thankfully, I've not encountered a moment yet where I can't find a seat. A plus: there are individual bar seats at the front facing the window. I work solo a lot and don't like occupying an entire table if I can avoid it. (I always feel awkward taking a whole table. Hey stranger! You're free to share with me! [But most folks don't ask to do that.]). \n\nSo, some final thoughts: high quality and reasonably-priced food and beverages, friendly service, nice surroundings, free wifi... oh! and awesome music... WIN. WIN. aaaand WIN. Home has definitely jumped to the top as one of my favorite coffeeshops in the city. How serious is my appreciation for Home? I take 2 MUNI buses from Pacific Heights to Home in the Outer Sunset. That's real.", "author": "James Z."}

He and I had to run off to San Mateo early last weekend and I wanted some breakfast beforehand.  He didn't want to wait for one of their awesome looking toasts, so we ended up just sharing a Mint Chocolate latte & running across the street for some donuts.  Double shots are in all the lattes.  It was about $4 and unfortunately they only have whole milk.  Stingy me didn't want to pay extra for soy or almond milk.  I've been noticing a handful of coffee shops only offer whole, I wish they would at least consider 2% at the very least, I mean we are pretty health conscious here in SF.  \n\nWe got the drink to go but unfortunately it took about 15 minutes to receive.  I'm sure if we got one of those toasts we would be looking at at least a half hour.  Service is friendly but when you get to go, it should never take more than 5 minutes for a latte and that's even pushing it.  There was only one guy acting as barista though.  Latte was good and not too sweet but the mint flavor was pretty faint.  I would be willing to come back to dine in for another unique coffee drink (red velvet latte may be next) and either the truffle or chicken meatball toast.", "author": "Cat C."}

I ended up ordering a hazelnut latte and a couple of warm pastries--they were all really good! The bacon spinach pastry was my favorite, and I don't even like bacon! The ham and cheese croissant was delicious as well. The croissant was just the right texture--light, fluffy, and rich in flavor.

Someone working there usually wipes down the tables before the next guest sits down. \n\nBesides your typical coffee & espresso drinks, Home also offers some pretty unique offerings including lavender and coconut lattes. My favorite is definitely the lavender latte!! It's sweetened with lavender syrup and garnished with real petal bits! They offer both a lavender coffee latte & a lavender tea latte; the tea is a bit more aromatic and lavender-eque.\n\nThey do have a small selection of decaf drinks, but the only decaf coffee they offer is a pour-over.

It's not a place I'd go and get my daily coffee (that honor goes to Henry) because their two-shot Americano, while delicious, doesn't have enough caffeine to last me a full day for some reason (and unfortunately, the same has to be said about their drip coffee...really wish they offered more than one size for their drinks!).\n\nBut that's totally okay.\n\nBecause Home isn't for that kind of coffee drinking. It's more of a place you want to go to treat yourself and when you aren't on a time crunch. It's best enjoyed when you have the luxury to sit down and enjoy your food and drink, maybe with a friend you haven't seen in awhile, or a place to spend a quiet morning with your SO, or even just to get some me-time with your Mac or moleskine. The atmosphere is lovely, with plenty of seats and succulents. Andytown may have its Snowy Plover and Trouble may have its toast and coconuts, but Home has its Hangover (sparkling Americano) AND Eggs in a Basket! Both of which are better than their fancier and more expensive counterparts in Outer Sunset. If you're a fan of Hollow in Inner Sunset, you'll love Home--the creative drinks are more reasonably priced and the space is more comfortable.\n\nHome is a new business and it looks like they're expanding and still playing around with their menu.

I came here to see the Birthday Cake Latte in person, and I am happy that I did. It's so pretty. Of course I did what everyone did and instagrammed that baby pronto when I got it. What I didn't like so much was the chicken meatball toast. I like my meat salty and savory, but this one was more so sweet. Well, I'm going to keep this review as short as my visit was. All in all- just come here for the birthday cake latte. It's like drinking a cupcake :).", "author": "Mimi N."}

The atmosphere, service and coffee drinks are amazing. \nMy friend and I went here during Sunday afternoon and all of the tables are filled up already. Such a busy afternoon, but it's ok since we wanted to order drinks to-go for this visit. My friend ordered the Caramel Latte, while I ordered the Lavender Jasmine Tea Latte. Both of these drinks were deliciously and beautifully made. Mines had the right amount of Jasmine and lavender scents and taste, along with the taste of coffee combined. I wished I could've thought to buy another cup. I will definitely plan to come here more often. \nOverall, definitely check out Home if you're close by Noriega and/or Ocean Beach. It's worth the trip to try out one of their creative coffee beverages.", "author": "Vivian L."}

I came today around 12:20 to get ice coffees to go and the line was long. Had to wait 10 minutes for my order to be taken and around 15 min  for my drink to be made. The one star is for the girl  taking my order without her I would give this a 0 star if I could. I wouldn't have minded as much of the wait if I didn't have some place to be and the workers were actually working faster instead of talking mostly. I asked for a iced chocolate mint latte extra sweet and less ice and a normal ice coconut vanilla latte. The coconut vanilla was fine but the girl making my drink put a lot of ice in my drink and she realized that and asked if I wanted less, and I said yes. She then went to scoop out the ice and just gave it to me like that. She couldn't at least top it off with more milk or something? It just feels stupid to wait 30 minutes for a coffee not even filled all the way and the coffee had no mint or chocolate flavor whatsoever.. Don't think I'll come back to this location.", "author": "Kayla F."}

I really love an establishment that feels personal and knows how to treat guests.The service is great, and the drinks are so aesthetic, also v. yummy. My best recommendation here is the matcha latte! Really earthy and full bodied. Have never been disappointed.\n\nMy ONE downside of this place: if you're listening owners of Home, please change your hours! I only get to come here once in a blue moon, but I'd really love to come around more often. It would just be amazing if the hours extended until maybe 7pm so that I can have a chance to relax with a comforting matcha after work.

My friend got the Coketastic - coke, espresso, and ice cream... interesting and delicious, think of it like a lighter and carbonated affocato.

I've tried making at home home before this, but it wasn't that great. This had the perfect amount of lavender. I oddly like things that taste like flower! Just has a nice fragrance to it. \nThe sea salt caramel was great too. A little too sweet for me, but it still tasted really good. I want to come back and try a bunch of the other Creative options they have. They all sound delicious and look really pretty. I really like how they allow people to sit there for about 2 hours to share the space with other people.\n\nI'm rarely in this area of SF, so I'd be glad to come back in the future and try everything else.", "author": "Janet T."}

It was my first time at \"home\" and was a bit overwhelmed with their creative drinks menu, but the girl in front gave me a lot of suggestions on their best-selling lattes. So I got the iced vanilla-coconut latte and my friends got the lavender latte and red velvet latte, respectively. These flavors were said to be some of their best! \n\n    The latte in general is good but I don't really see it as coffee-coffee. I know they use de-la-Paz coffee beans (sister company of 4-barrels) and usually it's super fragrant but the drink was more on the milder side. I didn't taste much coffee even though they used 2 shots of espresso and it really felt like flavored milk with a hint of coffee, instead of the other way around. The good thing is that they let you add another 2 shot for extra $$! \n\n   The owner sent me a message and recommended that I try the iced lattes with more ice or to add an extra 2 shots of espresso for $1.50. I'd like to share the advice for people who like a stronger coffee flavor like me! \n\n    In terms of the different infusion flavors, they still have a long way to go but they are a relatively new coffee place so they have time to improve!

However, parking tends to get ugly on these few streets and its not unheard of to park a few blocks away and walk in.\n\nUpon entering, the space felt inviting. It was home-y white space area that was minimalist but in the best way possible. The menu was written on a roll of butch paper thats hung on the wall next to the cash register. As I was reading the list of drinks I became more and more excited. I ordered a Holy Cow and took a seat.\n\nWithin moments my drink came and I look my first sip ANDDDDDDDDD it was sort of a let down. The drink wasn't exactly what I wanted. There seem to be too much milk, just a tad too sweet, and something else about it was just off.

Stumbled upon it by accident a few weeks ago and have made it my weekly work/coffee/toast spot ever since.  The staff is super friendly, the environment cute and stylish and most importantly, the coffee and toasts (and super creative list of latte creations) are all amazing.  My one and only mention is around the bathroom and sort of cleanliness of the kitchen area.  For such an adorable, thoughtfully done place, I am continually shocked and grossed out by the gas-station-like bathroom.  It's usually pretty dirty (definitely doesn't appear to be cleaned daily) and is extremely bare and cold-a stark contrast to the cafe in general.  Since they're serving food here, it always gives me pause that if their workers use this bathroom, is our food being handled by the most clean of hands?  I would love to see the bathroom kept clean regularly as well as some touches to make it feel as \"homey\" as the rest of the cafe so I don't walk out feeling I need to wash up again after I leave. \n\nLastly the little area where they prepare the food and coffee is also pretty cluttered/messy and unappealing and given they're preparing food back there, it seems like it could use some refining to give patrons the confidence that everything is up to code, etc.\n\nI don't mean this to be harsh because I truly love this place but really do hope these things can be improved soon.  \nHope you can appreciate the feedback, Home!", "author": "Sarah F."}

I had Home bookmarked for a while after I seen the amazing pictures on Instagram. It seemed like another one of the hipster coffee shops, which I usually don't go to unless I have some mad work to finish. We arrived around 10:20 and there were still tables open. They have outlets under every alternating table, which is good; can't have a coffee shop without outlets. And thank goodness they have a bathroom. \n\nAmbiance/ Appearance:\nHome is so adorable; chill vibes all around. There is a succulent plant on each table...adding more hipster points. I like that they use a brown butcher like paper to write their drinks on the wall. They have a very earth toned gray scale color theme which makes the interior feel more relaxing. There are so many cute decorations throughout the cafe, ugh just can't get enough. \n\nService:\nThe baristas are so kind. They explained to us menu items we weren't sure about, and made us feel comfortable and welcome.\n\nTaste: \nI ordered the chicken meatball toast with pesto. It has pesto, sliced chicken meatballs, sauteed green onions, red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese on top. This piece of toast is huge and everything about it was so good. I am usually not a fan of chicken sausage, but this can be the exception. I also ordered a hot coconut vanilla latte, which was good. The coconut and vanilla balanced each other so that neither overpowered the other. \n\nThe coffee was $3.75 and the toast was $5.75. Overall the food and drink was really good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-15", "description": "'Home' cafe offers an extensive menu including toasts, non-caffeinated drinks, tea, and your typical cup-of-joe. It proudly boasts its superior ingredient quality, unique tea concoctions, and special caffeinated combinations in which unexpected ingredients are added to classic  coffee choices.\n\nWhat to know about 'Home':\n\nVery reasonably priced despite the creative effort by the owners. $4 can already get you any of their top tier coffee options.\n\n'Home' utilizes De La Paz and Four Barrel coffee beans. Four Barrel has a couple physical locations in SF. It also offers freshly-baked pastries and overwhelmingly buttery cookies shipped each morning from SF's own 'Heartbaker' (I believe).\n\nModern, simplistic decor with dominant beach-themed colors of dark blue, white, dark brown, and gray that give off a vibe that makes every nook-and-cranny Instagram-worthy. In other words, the warm-heartedness from the owners and cafe's atmosphere is loyal to its name; home. Minimalistic layout makes 'Home' a hidden gem and complete beauty to Noriega street.\n\nPlenty of seating to go around though it might get popular around lunchtime. Majority of customers were students and adults on their laptops while a few chatted the afternoon away.\n\nTwo baristas, one female the other male, I'm guessing were the owners, were some of the sweetest, personable, and most down-to-earth people. They were very welcoming, and answered all of our questions thoroughly since nobody else was waiting in line.\n\nOn the main street, parking isn't free though on the side streets, it is and in the daytime (when 'Home' is open) parking is relatively easy. Beware that parking meters can be fed solely with coins or charged to credit card.\n\nHere's what my party ordered:\n\nCOCONUT VANILLA LATTE ($3.75): Very innovative concept; Love the idea of using coconut juice or milk inside a vanilla latte; For the first few sips, coconut taste is not obvious but gradually hints of coconut are apparent without overwhelming the coffee itself; Coffee taste was apparent but not strong enough probably since it would cover up the faint coconut taste; Could have been a little less sweet though this could be adjusted\n\nHOLY COW ($4): Latte with condensed milk; Bro thought it could've been less sweet since condensed milk makes it sweeter than usual; Similar to Vietnamese Coffee though it's made with much better ingredients and a stronger coffee brand\n\nALMOND COOKIES ($?/2 COOKIES): Amazing; Loads of butter made cookies heavenly; Topped with almond slivers; Texture was very crumbly\n\nIf you're aiming for a one-of-a-kind coffee experience filled with either creative beverages, guilt-ridden cookies, or lovely interior, 'Home' is the ideal coffee shop in the city to go to. 'Home' sets the perfect example of how innovative coffee shops could and should be and really aims to cater to everyone by focusing on creativity.", "author": "Jacquie H."}

YUP, MUCHO EXCITEMENT.\n\nIt always sucks to go back to work after a three day weekend, but I was super excited for Tuesday to come along because I couldn't wait to check out this new spot during my lunch hour. Sometimes I'll hit up House of Coffee to do work on my laptop, but when I saw photos of Home on Yelp, I knew it'd be my typa spot. First off, they have succulents everywhere.

If you take a quick look around, you can tell how much effort was put into decorating the space. I really loved the all around hipster/simplistic/wood vibe. \n\nHome offers different types of coffee including drip and lattes, but if coffee is not your forte, fret not, they also have drinks for fellow tea lovers.

That being said, this is DEFINITELY, the new cool kid on the block.\n\nAmbiance:\nI'd label it hipster. Strong neutral color palette (shut up interior design majors, I know neutrals aren't colors). Every table is decorated with a lone succulents; simple, yet charming. They have two (maybe one, don't remember) large fogged skylight/s, allowing for natural light to come in, but not too much light.\n\nThe Coffee/Food:\nThe menus are draped down the wall via a scroll of brown parchment-like paper, weighed down by little clamps to keep it in place, GENIUS. The coffee is good. If you're a coffee enthusiasts, they have four barrel pour over, SCORE! Their artisan toast is to die for, even though I've only tried one (the meatball/green onion...ORDER IT, LOVE IT, THEN DIE OF TASTE BUD ELATION). Just kidding, don't die.\n\nLASTLY, but certainly not least, the Customer Service.\nThe owners, In and Annie, are awesome. Annie is adorable, very cute, and easy on the eyes. While In is a chill dude that you can chop it up with, not to be confused with small talk, for \"chopping it up\" is MUCH harder to achieve and should be respected and appreciated. Sorry ladies and gents, don't hit on either of them, they're an item [DOOR SLAM] so drown in your romantic sorrows with a splendid cup of Joe made carefully by them as they cheerfully bid thee farewell with their lovely smiles, for they know customer service is just as important as the physical product. They excel in this category and that's how you get repeat HAPPY customers, and I always recognize and appreciate.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're in the sunset district and don't want to drive out to ocean beach, GO HOME. See what I did there? They're not open Mondays.", "author": "Aaron C."}

He felt really bad and when it came time to pay for the bill, he reached into his pocket and said he would pay for our water and said \"it was important to hydrate\".

The interior is well decorated and maintained, with thoughtful additions like picture frames, wall mirrors, and a string of lights that made the entire place look like a well maintained modern living room.

In the 4 hours I stayed, I never felt too crowded nor too lonely as I was constantly surrounded by cheerful people having light conversations or other studious individuals. \n\nThe wifi is pretty consistent, and outlets were plentiful along the majority of the tables. Extra points for the comfortable butt pads that are provided for the bench seating along the walls.\n\nMore points for the creativity in the drink menu. In additional to your coffee shop essentials, they have offerings such as Nutella hot chocolate, mixed lattes, and in house syrups. I went for an iced red velvet latte (it was early in the morning and I really didn't care what people thought of me at the time) that was very well done, and of course, it was in a mason jar. \n\nThis place easily tops my list of coffeeshops in my neighborhood that I wouldn't hesitate to return to.

Their \"Hangover\" drink is kind of a copy of Andytown's snowy plover - it's a sparkling iced americano and it's remarkable. They use Four Barrel and De La Paz for their roasters. I'm assuming they use the latter in the hangover because the coffee was bold and strong and not weak and flowery like Four Barrel (I hate Four Barrel).  \n\nOh and the toast! The condensed milk toast (very Sunset District, ya see?) is so damn good. It should come with a shot of insulin to save your body the effort because it's very sweet, but worth the grams of sugar. They even have condensed milk lattes if you're into matching.\n\nYou can stay for hours just working on your computer without being bothered - it seems like most people come here to get work done.

I also had ordered the chai tea, which is hard to go wrong with. The appearance of it was nice, but it was my own fault that I left the bag in the water for too long.\n\nAmbiance: Vey modern and clean. With just enough plant life in the restaurant to bring in some color, as it does have white walls, chairs, and tables. They also have a lit up \"HOME\" sign in white, which is a nice touch to the atmosphere. Their menus are written in large brown papers deriving from a roll towards the top of the walls and on a black chalkboard in purple, green, and blue chalk.

It has condensed milk and is the perfect sweetness for me.  People bring their laptops and just hangout there. I've heard good things about their toasts but I have yet to try it.

My friend and I wanted to check this place out because we saw pictures on Instagram and it caught our eye. When we first walked in we saw that all the tables were all filled, it was definitely a place for people to study and work on their own stuff. There were accessible outlets pretty much anywhere you sat which was super convenient for those who were studying. Our concern was if we would even find a place to sit since there wasn't any outside seating either, but the cafe was very open and sharing tables was a common thing in order to accommodate new customers who came in (luckily we got a table just as we got our drinks!) My friends and I pondered on what to get, I got the London Fog (personal favorite from Verve in Santa Cruz and La Boulange) but the coconut vanilla latte also caught my eye. My friends got the red velvet latte (which was amazing) and the lavender jasmine tea latte. Both the London Fog and the lavender jasmine tea latte was pretty subtle in taste, but creamy. Personally, I would definitely go back and check out several more items on their menu and highly recommend.\n\nAlso, service was amazing, the girl who was at the cash register was super friendly and helpful.

They have a great selection of creative drinks and their toast is delicious. In terms of their seating though, it's a fucking gamble see below:\n\nBEWARE IF YOU PLAN TO DINE IN: \nIt fucking sucks when you get there in hopes of having coffee and toast with a friend that's visiting and you find out that all the tables are full because all the students/ people working on their laptops have hogged up all the tables. They buy ONE cup of coffee and sit there for HOURS. Sure, the signs say something like \"these tables are for you to enjoy your company so please no laptops\" but the staff there don't really do much to enforce that rule. I personally think they should have a 90minute rule for people who just sit there and take up space. I've seen multiple people come in only to leave because of the lack of seating. If you're gonna work at a table for hours you better be buying more than 1 cup of coffee for the entire day because you just cost this cafe a shit ton of fucking money by taking up space. They should have a sign for laptop users \"two drink minimum if you're gonna sit here for more than 2 hours\" otherwise take your ass to a library or rent a co-working space.", "author": "julie t."}

You have the athletic point guard who can thread impossible passes and score at will, but has the same defensive capability as a wet sheet of toilet paper. Or the house that has idyllic views of the ocean and enough bathrooms for the entire family to shower at the same time, but sits downwind from a sulfuric factory. Or the spouse with a witty sense of humor and picturesque hair, but who snores like an industrial, hyperactive chainsaw.\n\nFinding the ideal coffee shop in vocal San Francisco might be even more difficult, especially with thousands of differing opinions on the correct line of coverage to route boiling water in a pour over, millions of contrasting views on the specific Pantone blue wallpaper that would encourage the most peaceful meditation, and the billions of arguments on the appropriate positioning of windows to allow in the most conducive light for studying when the sun's angle shifts as the day progresses.\n\nHome comes closest to that ideal.\n\nUpon entering, the surprisingly warm greeting and genuine foray into conversation by the friendly owners makes you feel, well, at Home. Even after ordering and settling in, their hospitality extends to bringing drinks, straws, and napkins straight to your table and keeping a watchful eye for polished plates or empty mugs that can be cleared.\n\nThe diverse coffee menu features deeply flavorful pour overs that form the backbone of any legitimate coffee shop. The decaf Guatemalan has dark overtones that gradually strengthen as the brew cools. The Coketastic is an innovative combination of Coke, espresso, and ice cream that is simultaneously potent and refreshing, providing the perfect kick to start a busy morning or an energizing jolt out of afternoon doldrums. The Affogato offers a larger scoop of ice cream and an impossibly crisp and fresh cone. The sturdy cone can be used either as a ladle for the creamy ice cream and espresso mix or can be shattered to chip-sized pieces to create a small bowl of dessert nachos.\n\nThe lush slabs of buttery toast can function as light breakfast or indulgent snack. The Egg in Basket toast has runny yolk ready to infuse each bite, while the Condensed Milk toast has a rich sheet of pooled milk waiting to cascade onto each cut piece. The crispy cut-out part of bread that the egg displaced in culinary coup accompanies the Egg in Basket as a bonus.\n\nThe ample seating is represented by tables bathed in sunlight in the front or more coolly lit by ambient bulbs towards the back.

Instead of the old & vacant Eagles Drift bar, now sits a very cool OneUp bar. Next to that, is a sweet cafe which boasts coffee and tea. Curiousity got me walking in and here's what I found:\n\nMy initial take on this cafe: modern minimalist details meets warm and welcoming vibes. It's an open floor plan featuring beautiful wood embellishments adorned by mini-succulents and cacti. Fresh bohemian floral arrangements line the cascading shelves. It was sunny that day and thanks to the position of the cafe, the sun let in an almost stategically placed ray of sunshine.. that wasn't blinding! \n\nOnto the coffee: It doesn't get any better than this: Four Barrel and De La Paz? It's a coffee connoisseur's delight.  Delicious pastries and drip over coffees are also offered with a smile. \n\nI love the fresh take on a Menu: butcher paper rolls on the wall. I've never seen this done before! Fancy toasts, cool coffee & tea variations are offered and are so delicious. The owners aptly named the cafe, \"Home\", because well, that's exactly what it feels like. The color palette here makes you feel right at home; evoking feelings of peace, tranquility and relaxation.  The music selection feels up to the challenge as well. Lots of Jack Johnson, Sam Smith and Adele to soothe your soul.\n\nI've saved the best for last. The real gem of this place are the owners. They are so sweet, welcoming and friendly. Even through my million questions about the menu, they were so patient and willing to give suggestions. I'm thankful this cafe has found a home on Noriega.

This is a great new addition to the sunset. The couple who run this shop, is absolutely fabulous. They definitely made you feel like part of the family. Quaint little cafe with a handful of tables and booths. Plenty of people working on their laptops.\n\nOk, so enough about that. More about the menu items. Their specialty coffee options are off the chain. Let's just say at the end of our visit we had ordered five different beverages and three different toasts just to taste a sampling of their yummiest they had to offer. Think lavender latte, coconut late, espresso with condensed milk and my personal favorite a drink conception made of espresso, coke and ice cream. Delish! Think similar to root beer float with espresso. So good!\n\nYummy toasts included cinnamon and butter (my fav), sweetened condensed milk and tomato and pesto with egg. All fantastic. Rumor is there will me more additions to the menu to come! I cannot wait to go back and try more. Oh, and don't forget to buy the yummy brownie/caramel/shortbread things on sale by he cash register.

I highly recommend the toast especially for lunch. Its very filling and flavorful and compliments the cold brew/ hazelnut latte. They also have soy milk and almond milk for those who are lactose intolerant like me. \n\nService: The cashier/baristas are very friendly and also bring the food/drinks to your table. I would say they have better service than most other coffee shops I've been to in the area.\n\nI highly recommend coming early on weekends if you want a seat and headphones if you're trying to work here past 2PM (it definitely gets pretty loud here with families). \n\n*For the cook/staff: It would be really nice if the toast was cut into pieces than the chicken and egg put on top so it's easier to eat it.", "author": "Richard P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-20", "description": "The lattes and toast here are pretty good. So far I've had the hazelnut latte (hot) and the salted caramel latte (iced). With the hazelnut one I couldn't really taste too much flavor other than coffee, but the salted caramel one had a good balance of salt, caramel flavor, and coffee. Neither of them were too sweet, which I really liked.\n\nI've had the condensed milk toast and the eggs in a basket. Both toasts were made from the same bread - a fluffy sort of white bread - and toasted in butter to a perfect crispy texture. The condensed milk was a bit too sweet for me but I guess what do you expect, it's condensed milk. The eggs in a basket made for a very filling lunch for me when coupled with a coffee, and the egg was cooked to have a nice runny yolk.\n\nOverall I think this is a great place with a nice atmosphere. It can get crowded sometimes, but if you're there alone it's easy enough to just share a table with someone else if you need to. If you're with others it may be difficult to find a table around noon to one (and I assume breakfast but I haven't been at that time).

It's pretty sweet and they let you choose if you want a jumbo marshmallow on it, and if you do they put a little face on it in chocolate. Super cute. I also had the Eggs in a Basket toast and it was perfectly made. They put the extra bread on the side in a perfect circle and the egg yolk was perfect, not too runny but not too thick either. My friends had the Salted Caramel Latte, Tomato Pesto Toast, Strawberry Pastry, and Birthday Cake Latte, to which they said was absolutely delicious. Their customer service is FANTASTIC. So their computer had a technical problem and they were backed up. I had already gotten my toast for a while while my friend didn't get hers yet even though we placed our orders at the same time. So we asked them where her toast was and one of the workers there let us know what was going on (I believe her name was Abi/Abby) and they gave us a complimentary Condensed Milk Toast, which was, by the way, really really good. The condensed milk soaked into the toast perfectly and I really like how they brown the milk as well because it kept it from getting too overly sweet. And she asked if we needed anything so I asked for a toothpick so we could pop the bubbles in the latte (we hadn't drank them yet, waiting for the toasts to take pictures) and they offered to just remake our drinks for us although they totally didn't have to. And the remade drinks had extra cute swans and a Totoro instead of the standard latte art leaf that we had initially gotten.

The customers who go here are all young students probably from SF state and whatnot. It's a nice place to bring your laptop and do your homework, but the ambience does get a little chatty, and when the cafe is filled people start sharing tables. So if you're the type to get easily distracted and what complete silence then maybe this isn't a good place for you.

Big, clean space, wi-fi, friendly service, and good products! I passed by just while driving and I was surprised to see that it was a cafe, so I just knew I had to try it out. I looked it up on yelp and was surprised to find out it was so nice. I was excited to try the things on their menu and it didn't disappoint! I ordered an iced lavendar latte and a cinnamon sugar toast, and while rining up my order, the lady was super friendly! She asked me about my day and made little small talk. I sat down and got my drinks after 5-10 minutes. The iced lavendar latte was so good! It wasn't super sweet, and they had actual lavendar as a garnish, which I'd recommend stirring into the drink to give it a stronger flavor. I know it messes up the pretty presentation, but the inherent lavendar flavor isn't super noticeable. It was light and refreshing, especially since it was 80+ degrees today.. It came in a cute little mason jar, and they serve it to you and bring up straws for you to grab yourself (in case you're a germaphobe i guess hahaha). The toast came a little after and I was surprised to find that it was a lot thicker than expected. I would say it's actually a solid inch thick, at least the slice I got. It wasn't super hot or anything, but served perfectly warm. The butter, sugar, and cinnamon were so tastey and there was enough of everything in each bite, even the crust! My friend also ordered an iced coconut vanilla latte, and I hate coconut, but it was actually really good and tolerable for my palette because the coconut was super light. The vanilla was more prominent but you can taste the coconut for sure. \n\nI definitely am coming back to try their other drinks because their creative menu looks amazing; I just wanna try everything!

I got the cold brew iced coffee, which was PERFECTLY brewed! Clean, crisp finish, not too watery and not too bitter/strong. I would say that it's on the medium roast side. The decor of Home is sophisticated, and very clean, (also super cute!).  And applause for the friendly customer service. Oh! And HOW AWESOME IS IT THAT THEY ACCEPT CARD/NO MINIMUM CHARGE!! WOOO! A rarity in coffee shops in SF. Definitely will be coming back, and will spread the word about Home. After all, I live right next to it!\n\n5 stars to 4 stars: for a place called home, it's disappointing to find it closed at random times/early close times. Only downside.", "author": "Elizabeth K."}

I discovered the place when I was picking up cash at the nearby Chase bank and walked by. Intrigued, I looked at the menu and glanced inside. Seeing a good amount of customers, I decided to give this place a shot. Boy, am I glad this place opened up near me.\n\nThe first time I went there, I got the mocha and a Cinnamon Sugar toast. The barista told me they use Ghirardelli chocolate and marshmallows in their mocha - it was very good. It wasn't too sweet and it balanced out the coffee pretty well; I will definitely be getting it again. The toast was excellent - buttered with cinnamon and brown sugar while the bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nI went here again recently and ordered the Americano and the same toast. The coffee is still good as is the toast. They have great consistency with their food and that's always a plus. The employees here are also very nice, accommodating and they always asks how I'm doing. Their great service is another aspect that will keep me coming back.\n\nOverall, I think \"home\" is a great coffee shop that fits nicely in the neighborhood and has the ability to compete with the other new coffee places around the area. It has amazing toast, awesome coffee, and friendly employees. The fact that it is a brief walk from my house is also a huge positive. If you live in the Inner Sunset or are in the area, definitely try this place out. You'll be glad to go \"home\".", "author": "Austin C."}

I definitely liked that they had wi-fi and outlets, it was perfect for getting some work done. The atmosphere was pretty awesome: nice decor, not too loud, good music playing, and the staff were super friendly.\n\nNow for the food and drinks:\nIced Hazelnut Latte: I love hazelnut so I had to get it. It was good, the hazelnut flavor was subtle, but noticeable. It wasn't too sweet but it hit the spot.\n\nCondensed Milk Latte: My girlfriend got this, it was a little sweet for her taste, but it's expected of condensed milk. \n\nNutella donut: The nutella was pretty concentrated in the middle of the donut. Once I finally got to it, it was pretty tasty. They even warmed it up for me!\n\nTomato-pesto toast: This was pretty amazing. Thick cut toast with pesto, tomato, and cheese. Can't get much better. \n\nThey have a ton of other specialty drinks to try and all of the different toast options sound amazing. I'm definitely goinna come back here.", "author": "Melyssa A."}

I love the menu split between \"Classics\" (which are all prepared with lots of care and attention) and \"Creative\" where they get to play around with some delicious flavors (like their Lavender Latte).\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and calm, and the skylights really bring in a ton of natural light which is a big plus for me. Big tables and friendly people. \n\nI do wish the seating were just a bit more comfortable, but then again the one thing to watch out for is people that order one coffee and just stay here all day taking up tables, so maybe making the seating more comfortable would just make that problem worse. I'm all for finding a solid study/work space, but I also think you should at least keep refilling your coffee or something if you're going to block other customers from sitting down...

My husband and I have been in the San Francisco area for 3 days and this is the 1st amazing coffee we've had. Great flavor, great service. Local products. The breakfast meals were absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this shop and will probably be back a few more times before we leave town.", "author": "L M."}

They ran out of ginger peach tea and offered to brew a fresh batch.  Didn't want to trouble them but the fact that they offered shows how much they value customer service.  Hope this place sticks around.", "author": "Yumi C."}

The menu has a lot of creative options, especially for the lattes and toasts! A friend an I got the hazelnut latte and coconut vanilla latte, as well as tomato truffle oil pesto toast and chicken meatball with garlic toast. It took roughly 10 minutes to make, but the wait was definitely worth it. The coffee was delicious - the hazelnut latte had an underlying hazelnut flavor, not too strong, and the toast is thick enough to fill you up! The flavors are perfect, and good for any time of the day. The decor of the cafe is also really cute - there are little plants at every table, as well as fairy lights and shelves filled with little trinkets. They have lots of seating to stay and chat with a friend, too. I would definitely come back again!", "author": "Cindy N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-31", "description": "It is a nice cafe. In fact perhaps it is too nice because people seem to stay for a long time. This has caused an issue for me because there are limited power outlets and getting a table near one can be a challenge. Regarding food and beverage, the cappuccino is good as are the pastries. The cappuccinos come with a nice design in the foam which always makes me feel a little guilty when I stir in a little sugar. The only other thing is that I feel like it's a bit pricey although not terribly overpriced considering the small size of the shop and the low turnover of the tables.", "author": "Gerry M."}

The Outer Sunset definitely has been in need of some nicer coffee shops like this one.  The coffee and toast are both excellent.  I also really like the decor and set up inside.  A decent amount of seating and plugs at every other table in a really nice, clean, and uncluttered setting.  I've been able to bring my laptop and get alot of work done.  The baristas have all been really nice as well.  I hope this place continues to succeed!", "author": "Jessica R."}

The interior has a minimalist feel to it with plenty of seating. I got the lavender latte with soy and the chicken meatball with pesto toast - a bit oily but tasty.
