I love trying new pizza places just so I can say \"hey, I've tried their pizza and it's pretty damn good\". There's not many pizzas I've had that aren't good pizzas. \n\nEscape From New York Pizza has pizza by the slice, which is great when you want to stop by for lunch and grab a slice and a drink and keep on with your day without a major commitment to a whole pie. To make it even better, there's options like the You Say Potato slice, or The Gourmet. In other words, you're not limited to cheese, pepperoni or sausage. Be extravagant and daring. Or not and get a cheese slice if that's the way you swing. \n\nGrab a table inside or sit outside and people-watch on Polk Street.

My favorite pie is Canadian bacon with mushrooms and roasted red peppers. Sometimes I order a meatball pie with fresh garlic and extra sauce, yum. Their salads are good too, generous portion of greens and fresh veggies. Even their delivery guys are nice! \n\nMy problem is the bake on their pizzas is inconsistent. Sometimes we get a nicely baked pie. The crust is slightly crispy and soft at the same time. But sometimes we get one that's been in the oven for too long. Over the years I've just grinned and ate it, hey, it's delivery pizza. Tonight, however, it was a special kind of burn the cook left on it. \n\nI'm a big hungry guy, and I love my pizza, but tonight it was hard to choke down the char. Take a look at the pictures. It reminds me of that silent film where Charlie Chaplin eats a shoe. Not good. \n\nWhat urged me to write this review, after all these years is, I don't want to have to find another pizza place. I like this one. But I feel kinda disrespected tonight as a customer...that a cook would take a pie like this outta the oven, and decide, 'yeah it's good, wrap it up' and deliver it to me. \n\nSo tonight I ate a burned medium pizza, a bit of salad, and the $40.36 that I paid for it.

If I'm not mistaken, this is the only one I can think of.  There also aren't a ton of places to grab food late at night on this end of Polk Street.  Yet, there are quite a few places to drink when you're down this way.  Escape from New York fills a much needed role, and to its credit, it plays that role while offering a solid slice of pizza.\n\nI can't speak for ordering a whole pizza from Escape from New York, but I've been really satisfied with the slices.  They offer a nice variety at any given time and each one has been good.  The crust thin enough to have a nice crispness and is substantial without being overly heavy.  The cheese/sauce mix is executed properly so that you don't have cheese floating on sauce.  The toppings are good, and the slices are warmed up in the oven to order, although several times I have been fortunate enough to get it right out of the oven.\n\nMake a point of trying the Pesto, Potato and Garlic pizza.  Delicious.  Sometimes potato pizza can be a little iffy but this is done right.  The whole cloves of Roasted Garlic give this slice a great flavor.  I'm not sure if I could have it all the time, but when you're in the mood for these flavors, man is it good.  I would also give high marks to the Combo, with a good mix of meat and veggies.  I can always do the Mushroom slice.  And, as with any respectable spot (especially with New York in the name), the Cheese slice is good too.  I've always been happy.", "author": "Adam S."}

There isn't quite enough sauce to balance out the heaviness of the potato on the dough. So much starch and so many carbs!\n\nThe plain pesto is a little boring--not enough pesto/sauce!

The guy was like, \"oh sorry, but I will give you one for free.\" \n\nHm...ok, thanks, but that doesn't make it alright. I can actually pay for my pizzas. I can really use a bigger slice instead 3 smallest slices as I am feeding 3 hungry people. Myself included. Grrr... Oh and when I ask them whether there were other pizzas coming out soon, they are like, \"No\" and then right when I was about to leave, they came out with pepperoni! WTF. I asked them to change one of the slices out for the pepperoni and of course the guy there gave me the stink eye. But you know what, I have had enough of it. And I should have ask that he change out the smaller slices too but I didn't.\n\nThus the 2 stars. It's for the UNCOOL person or people working there...", "author": "Missy X."}

Also their prices are ridiculously high for what you get. The \"spicy\" salami is a scam. First of all, it is NOT spicy. It's just salami. Gallo, Columbus or other brands are just as good or better. \"Zoe's spicy salami\" is not spicy or special in any way; therefore it should not be equal to two (2) toppings. Escape from New York is also quite stingy with the cheese and sauce. I have no clue why Escape from New York has been so successful other than the name, \"Escape from New York Pizza\" being a very strategic marketing tactic, because it's nothing like New York pizza. That would be Victor's on Polk Street or Amicis. Also their \"sausage\" is totally lame. Nobody slices sausage like that ok. Please.", "author": "Michelle V."}

Without the EFNY website saying so, I had to make sure that the feta and mozzarella cheese was indeed, pasteurized. \n\nRealizing that this was possibly a busy time being 6:45pm, I needed to ask this question. A girl by the name of Jarrell (sp?) took my question and asked me to hold so she could ask her manager. I held (for a brief time) and she came back to say yes, the feta is pasteurized. Well, we decided to order, so I had to call back...unfortunately, I noticed that the Gourmet pizza comes with Mozzarella as well. As much as I hated to have to bother Jarrell (sp?), I had to ask this question. She was courteous, professional and very sweet.  But, most of... patient. \n\nAs far as the food, either you like EFNY or you don't. As far as a thin style (NY style) it's one of my top 3 in the city. Always tastes fresh and is good sauce as well. \n\nI have been a manager in the food industry and worked in customer service for quite a while.  Jarrell's attention to detail and courteous phone etiquette just tops it off for me.  I have been a customer at EFNY for a while and I will be for years to come.

Clearly, I target this place at the most vulnerable of times.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy the slices here. They're greasy and cheesy and satisfying. They always taste fresh and piping hot, which is really the only way I'm ever stuffing a pizza in my mouth. They make the crust exactly the way I like it. However it is important to note that is is NOT a typical NY crust, which is crispy and thin on the edges. The crust here is quite bready and soft.\n\nHere are my top favorites, in ranked order of course:\n\n1) You Say Potato: Pesto Sauce, Mozzarella, Potatoes (POTATOES!!) and Roasted Garlic Cloves.\n\n2) The Great Escape: Red Sauce, Mozzarella, Pepperoni, Mushrooms and Onions.\n\n3) The Gournet: Red Sauce, Mozzarella, Feta, Sundried Tomatoes, Artichokes and Spinach.\n\n-----\n\nDistinguishing factor: Might just be the best late-night/delivery pizza place on Polk.

Considering, as I mentioned above, I'm obsessed with pizza, I am pickier than most when it comes to my pizza selection. With that said, their other slices (outside of the potato garlic pesto) are average, at best. That one slice though, is out of this world..I literally dream of it. The way that garlic and potato melt in your mouth with the pesto taste complimenting it, is, well, indescribable. If all their selection was this good, I would give them 5 stars without  a doubt. Their pep, cheese, and Hawaiian Slices are too greasy, aren't flavorful enough, and don't do anything that excite me.\n\nService - Extremely inconsistent. Sometimes they're great, sometimes they're so extremely grumpy. Literally, every time I go here I have an experience that is at one extreme or the other. Then again, you can't expect a bunch people in their early to mid 20's being stoked about having to deal with a bunch of drunk idiots on a Friday or Saturday night.\n\nOverall - GET THE Potato garlic pesto slice!!!!!!!! .......

I only go here when I'm not patient enough to wait in the much longer line at Pizza Orgasmica, which indisputably serves better pizza than this place.    \n\nThe service here is non-existent, the employees either have a blank look on their face like they would rather be anywhere else or are too busy chatting amongst themselves.  This place can't be considered a real late night food joint, since most of the pizza slices they have left by the time 2:00AM rolls around are the leftovers for the day.  They never have any fresh pizzas coming out of the oven even if there is a long line at the door.  More often that not, by the time you get to the front of the long line you are forced you to buy whatever is leftover, essentially helping them clear out their excess inventory for the day.

Salads are fresh, crisp, varied and tasty, but let's be real:  it's about the pizza.  \"Gourmet\" is spinach, sun-dried tomatoes aplenty, feta, and artichoke hearts (could be more plentiful), atop a thick tomato sauce (sweet-ish, fyi) and mozz.  Pretty thick crust, but well-cooked so there's definitely a crispness to the underside, and a nice heft to the edge.

I'm furious and request new slices and the cashier girl is asking if I'd like my money back. They gave me one slice and refunded the other.

That was such a disappointment that I decided to do what any true pizza lover would do...real New York style pizza!\n\nI have never had a whole pizza here (yet!), but get slices at this location often.  In my opinion, this is the closest thing to genuine, real, authentic NY style pizza I've ever had outside of NYC.  I still remember it vividly since I was in NY twice last year.  I hit Carnegie Deli again too (oh my gawd, pastrami on rye, best in the world, orgasm of the mouth!), but that's a story for another day. \n\nEscape from NY Pizza on Polk St is virtually identical to the many (and I do mean many, all different owners too) Ray's Pizza places that I've frequented while in Manhattan.  Yes, it's greasy...dripping off the pizza and you have to fold it in half to enjoy it, but d#mn that's authentic!\n\nThe slices are pretty big too.  Some people have told me that they like Extreme Pizza.  I'll never know if they're any good since I went only once years ago when Extreme first opened.  They had a sign out front that said Extreme BIG slices!  I had a slice and it was the most pathetic little triangle I had ever seen.  I was like what...'Extreme'ly small?  They burned me once and I never went back.  Anyway, back to Escape:\n\nThere are many other pizza places that I love in SF (Pasquales on Irving, Gaspare's, Bella, Giorgio's, Tommaso's, etc), each of them special in their own way, but when I want real NY pizza, there is only one place I go and this is it, Escape from NY.

Well, my pie-eating compatriots, consider yourselves lucky to have Polk Street's Escape to New York's excellent slices so close at hand. The crust on Escape's pies rivals that of the Italian pies that sustained me as a hungry apprentice - nice and thin, with a slightly elastic chew and a bubbled, pillowy edge. The toppings are good quality - always fresh and flavorful. The sauce is richly tomato-y and the seasonings well balanced. Even the mozzarella, usually  flavorless, greasy goo in most American pizzerias, has a mild creamy flavor and minimal grease. The slices are big and the toppings generous - one usually does the trick for a dinner on the run.\n\nThe staff couldn't be nicer - for all the complaints I read below, I wonder if any of those with gripes made the effort to be cordial to the staff.

For example, one guy gave his expert opinion by saying, \"I want to be able to pick it up and not fall apart.\" That's a joke, right? You should want the mozzarella to be pulled like string taffy and the sauce to be thick with whole bits of tomato running through it. The crust should be crunchy without the feeling of biting into rock candy. No, the pizza shouldn't be soggy but it should bend in a few gazillion directions from the sheer weight of the cheese, sauce, and toppings. Besides, how the hell would you know that pizza was \"never meant to be eaten with a knife and fork? When it comes out hot from the oven you can't possibly pick up a slice with your fingers, without getting second degree burns.\nYou think this place is good? REALLY? \nIf you think this is good pizza then you don't know the difference between a pizza and a freight train.\nI was visiting my son in San Francisco and was told throughout my lifetime that the food in \"Frisco\" was great! On July 4th, we were watching the fireworks and figured a couple of pizzas and a few beers would be the perfect combo, so we ordered a couple of pies for delivery. One pie was ordered with extra cheese. I could have said, \"Hold the cheese\" and would probably have gotten the same amount. The crust was dry and the taste was worse. I mean, how the hell do you screw up the crust? Even the bottom crust was as course and dry as sand. There wasn't enough beer available to moisten this crust. The sauce was, for lack of a better description, bitter and actually was unlike anything that should be described as pizza sauce. Once, at a party, I had the unfortunate experience of eating a pizza from a pizza chain.  I don't remember if it was Pizza Hut, Domino's, or whatever, but it was one hellava lot better than this red tinted manhole cover. \nI am of Italian descent, born in Brooklyn, and am not trying to be over critical but there is absolutely nothing positive that I can say about this pizza.
