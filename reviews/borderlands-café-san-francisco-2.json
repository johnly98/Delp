While the bookstore wasn't the biggest, it's nice to see that old school book stores are still in the mix. \n\nBorderlands is a nice place to do some work and study on socialize with friends. But fair warning, if you're trying to study and can't stand noise than it's not the place for you. Luckily for me, noise doesn't bother me. So it's definitely a place I would consider studying in. There are outlets throughout the store and there are big tables all around. \n\nI only got a hot tea and chocolate chip cookie, both were adequate. I was told that my cookie was vegan so that's cool if you're into that kind of thing. For me it made no difference. Also, FYI they will refill your hot tea for free. \n\nThe service was friendly and polite. So definitely a chill spot to spend your time at.\n\nOh, last part!

Both were comforting and delish on the day I worked there. They have light fare such as bagels (can get with pbj, butter, or cream cheese), vegan cookies, egg sandwiches, etc. The patrons are mostly regulars who hang out, reading, writing, perusing the periodicals. No phone convos in the cafe allowed (yippee!), and a clean loo for patrons. Bigger tables for sharing are in the back, while smaller cafe style tables dot the shop's front seating section.

If you want a quiet place to work or read, it is not a perfect place either, because there might be a workshop exactly at that time that would distract you from your work. So, this is neither a cafe nor a place to work. Expect very bad quality of the coffee. Also expect that if you are not a native speaker, every time you come, you will be asked \"Where do you come from\" and \"Are you on holiday?\", which is nice when you hear it for the first time, but very irritating if it keeps repeating and makes you feel very humiliated and unwelcome.

Friendly, quirky, fun, and really on point with maintaining a high level of service/quality of product, I always enjoy chatting with them when I come in to get my joe.  When they see me walk in, they start my beverage immediately, and it's usually mostly-made by the time I even get to the register!  And sometimes, if my partner or I are running late, we call our beverages in in advance so we can just rush in, pay, and leave immediately...because they know us and know we're good customers, they willingly do this for us!  That's FIVE-STAR service!!!\n\nOther tasty things on the menu:  the meat and cheese plates are basic, tasty, and a good value for the money!  I usually get (and share!) the 3-meat and 3-cheese plate, which also comes with lots of french bread, delicious spicy brown mustard, and a little bowl of cherry tomatoes that are cold and refreshing!  That costs $11.  If you want only 2 meats/2 cheeses, that's only $8, and 1/1 for $5.\n\nThey also have a good selection of baked goods.

And sometimes they draw cute pictures on my coffee cup.  I love that!\n\nBorderlands doesn't have Wifi.  On purpose.  There.  I said it. \n\nWhy, you ask, incredulousness dripping from your tech-obsessed voice?  Well, they have this weird notion that people will use their cafe to interact with other humans (\"talking\" or \"conversation\"), read a book (maybe one from their sister store, Borderlands Books?), write a book (various writing groups meet here regularly), or generally use the time to disconnect from the internet.  Novel, I know.  Of course, if you have an internet dongle that gets you wifi anywhere, well, I suppose this isn't an issue for you, is it?  \n\nThere is a clean bathroom here.  That's good to know, right?\n\nThere is TONS of seating, including some very comfy upholstered furniture.  Nice for cuddling into with a good book...\n\nAlas, Borderlands closes at 8 pm.  Sigh.  Yeah, I know.  Why do all the good coffee shops in the Mission close to bloody early???  They used to close at 9 pm, but according to the owner, they couldn't sustain staying open that last hour due to the low amounts of business that time of night.  I guess everyone foregoes coffee in favor of PBR?\n\nGo here.  Try the Ice Mocha.  Seriously, it's delicious.  All my friends agree, too.  And bring the book you've been meaning to read/write.  Enjoy!", "author": "Amy L."}

This unabashedly geeky (and I mean that in the most loving way possible) store draws the opposite crowd you'd expect from the Mission, dialogues between well-read genre enthusiasts abounded all over the store, and there were no hipsters in sight.\n\nThe helpful and knowledgable staff took the time to greet everyone and offer tours to groups who stopped by to visit. If you prefer your books in book form, do yourself and the industry a favor and stop by Borderlands Cafe!", "author": "Kevin B."}

Since it's associated with the SciFi/Fan bookstore, I've always thought of it as a \"nerd cafe\" and a home-base of sorts, but now it seems a lot more hipsters and techsters have started to frequent it *scoff*\n\nAnyway.... They have an excellently wide drink selection, with many loose-leaf teas, and even non-caffeinated drink options such as fancy sodas. I do a version of the paleo diet, which means I don't eat pastries, so I love the fact that they have a selection of real food, including meat and cheese plates. Every time I have ordered one and asked for no bread they have immediately offered to add extra veggies in instead. Wonderful customer service. Also, not only do they actually know what a \"breve\" latte is, they actually list it on the menu!\n\nSome complain that there's no wireless, but frankly I'm glad for that, since it means you don't get mobile-office commandos parking all day. They do still have lots of tables and easily-accessible plugs, which means I bring my laptop there anyway to work on writing without all the distractions of the internet.\n\nFYI they hold the special readings/signings for the bookstore in the cafe now, which means sometimes the tables at the back of the store are taken down and it might be a little crowded/loud, but that's usually only a couple times a month for a few hours on a weekend afternoon.", "author": "Colleen O."}

IF no one who works there likes coffee maybe you should specialize in tea? Be a tea shop. Ditch the coffee. It's not nice to pretend.\n\nLast time it was the mean dude with the evil crudities. I'm allergic to belladonnas. I mentioned it when I ordered the cut vegetable plate. They barked out my complete order and there on the plate was a fist of Bell Peppers. I had not touched the plate just gestured at it and  I say \"Oh I don't eat bell peppers\" to the counter dude he barked \"Well its illegal for me to take the plate back after I put it on the counter\". WTF? That's news to me. I try and explain further my issue and he looks non pulsed and say NOT MY ISSUE and stomps off. Huh? Well in to the trash that goes. Yea wasted food and money.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-29", "description": "When I first walked by this coffee shop, two things caught my eye:  how brightly lit it was, and, on the glass outside, the words \"no wi-fi.\"  Let me explain how these two things were the reasons why I decided to trek into the Mission to study.\n\nFirst, I can't stand it when I go into a coffee shop to study but there is barely enough lighting to see my books.  When I study, I like it brightly lit so I'm not straining to read; I have more than enough strain from reading my books in the first place to really want to have to worry about being able to read it in the first place.  I sat on the couch next to the windows in the back of the cafe, and it was nice to have a large coffee table to spread my study materials out on (I felt kind of bad with 30 some odd flash cards spread willy-nilly everywhere . . . :D).  I take up a lot of space when I study, and there are plenty of tables in this cafe to do that.  I saw plenty of other people studying or reading or doing work, as well.\n\nSecond, the \"no wi-fi\" may be a deterrent to many people in this internet-driven world, but it was actually kind of refreshing.  Like many of my fellow students who are perpetually plugged into our cyber worlds (see number of yelpers who are students), it's rare that we're ever really able to unplug and study without the internet bouncing back and forth in front of us like an unruly child tempting us with fun sites (like Yelp!).  Thus when I found a place I could go without having to worry about being tempted to check my email, I had to go.\n\nAnd I found that I REALLY like it here!  Aside from the brightly lit area to be used for studying, the barista is friendly, and there isn't annoying music blasting in the background.  People generally mind their own business, but you can see that everyone is comfortable and smiles at one another.  I like that.  People should smile more.\n\nThe coffee itself-- I can't say.  I had a latte.  It was normal, I suppose.  Nothing spectacular, but I am not really a coffee person.  I'm more of a tea person-- next time I go I'll try the tea instead, I think.  Just to mix things up.\n\nEDIT:  I forgot to mention-- I LOVE the range of their magazine collection!  I was distracted a few times by the magazines.  Art, science, fashion, etc.  Everything and anything.  I love it.", "author": "Jeanne Y."}

It's my new library/living room/kitchen. \n\nI have spent at least two hours here every day for the last two weeks. I'm not kidding. I have an excuse: I am a first year law student in finals, and I can't study at school (too much crazy nervous energy) or at home (where I can play on the internet or garden or etc.) \n\nHere's why this place is the best cafe ever:\n1. The people are fantastic. The owner likes feedback. He thanks me for being a good customer. The baristas are (almost all) sweet and POLITE (that should be worth two stars on its own in the Mission). And it's true, they don't kick you at right at 9 pm. I like going to a place that wants to be open, but also wants its employees to get out when they are supposed to get out. \n\n2. The coffee is delicious and always fresh, since they don't make huge pots and leave it to sit around for hours. Also, where else can you get a delicious cup of coffee for $1.10?!\n\n3. It is a perfect environment for anything except surfing the internet. It is comfortable for chatting or reading and, as other reviewers have mentioned, it is perfect for studying. Big tables, brightly lit without fluorescent, lots of sockets, and everyone shares space nicely.\n\n4. Yummy food!  I love the North Beach and the Crudite (they use REALLY good olive oil), but what's even better is that the pastries are discounted in the afternoon. \n\n5. They introduced me to the Arnold Palmer. How did I not know the delight of lemonade and iced tea mixed together? So sad.", "author": "Nadya K."}

Good drip coffee (with the option of pouring my own almond milk!) and one of the best chocolate croissants I've ever had (okay, so it's not light and fluffy and French, but there's a generous amount of chocolate drizzled outside and wedged inside). The atmosphere changes from the front of the store to the back. In the front - where I'm less likely to sit - there's traffic from the adjoining bookstore and customers constantly roving to and fro amongst the bite-size indie tables. In the back, there are multiple larger tables good for groups and for people who like to spread everything from their Mary Poppins backpacks (me) not to mention a few comfy chairs and couches. Finally, I had some excellent service from a young woman whose name I unfortunately didn't request.

My first impression was gorgeous light reflecting off the polished antique wood floor, huge tables, and high ceiling, making the place feel spacious and welcoming all at once.\n\n1st star - They have a couch. 'Nuff said on that one. Try to save a seat on it for me.\n\n2nd star - Huge, sturdy tables that would be perfect for playing games on or getting to know your neighbor which I guess is the point since they don't have wi-fi (though they didn't mind me using my computer to do work).\n\n3rd star - The friendliest, most enthusiastic guy in the world works here. You can tell he is so excited and a little nervous for this new project to work out. He was super-accommodating of all my little requests and changes and was just the right blend of chattiness and leaving me alone to get stuff done.\n\n4th star - I had a mocha and it was fantastic - very hot, well-balanced flavors, great head of foam even though it was soy. The first few days of a new coffee shop are the critical period to analyze their coffee drinks, because the cafe's overarching vision either prioritizes coffee, in which case they'll hire employees who actually know how to make it, or prioritizes atmosphere/food/music/something that's not coffee, in which case they'll hire attractive young people and show them how to press the buttons on the coffee machines.\n\n5th star - Their food menu is not like any other cafe menu in the neighborhood. They offer several different \"plates\" (meat & cheese; crudites & something else; tomato, mozarella, & olives; etc., all with bread alongside) and offer them in several sizes - I think snack, meal, and to share. The snack plates are literally $3 or $4 dollars, which is great when you need a little something to tide you over while you get some work done but you don't want to throw down for a whole meal/sandwich. Basically it's like getting a bagel, but you get to eat something that's not a bagel!\n\nThings to consider: Not many vegan options on the food menu, (definitely not many gluten-free options, but they accommodated me admirably in letting my make up my own plate and I just don't expect to see GF offerings on menus) and I hope they can survive without offering wi-fi. It's like I can't even remember anymore why we used to go to coffeshops before the days when we all had laptops and they all offered wireless...", "author": "Scrumptious S."}

My friend and I walk in the store, we're carrying drinks we'd been drinking from another establishment.  After putting our things at a table (many, but not all tables were used, and not a busy time of night), I get up to order some tea to patronize the cafe.\n\nThe manager asks me if my friend will be having anything.  I told him she wouldn't -- after which he tells me that he \"can't let us sit at a table if all we're ordering is a $2.25 cent tea.\"\n\nExcuse me, but ordering a drink and sitting at a table is the purpose of a cafe - some will even sit for a long time with 1 drink.  Well, the jackass with no business sense lost his chance at customers or repeat customers, as we obviously didn't stay.  I can't describe how irritating it is to be smugly told to leave by an arrogant prick like that, and there's no chance I'll give this place another shot.\n\n***\n\nIn response to Alan's comment:  \n\nAlan, unfortunately, your defense of your behavior on Saturday reveals it to be based on your own defensive and somewhat paranoid attitude towards your customers. \n\n1.  We headed to the smallest open table, which happened to be towards the rear of the cafe.  There was no attempt to be circumspect, and I promptly  went to the front to order something from your cafe.\n\n2. No, I don't take it as a given that one cannot bring a drink into a cafe.  Would you have been happier if we ordered two cookies?  I did actually want tea, so I ordered tea.  And I consider the explicit polite behavior in a cafe on the part of a customer to be to order something.  After that, it's really none of your business.\n\n3. There really is no reasonable argument for the aggressive way in which you couched your refusal to serve us.  If you had a policy about outside drinks and cared to tell me that, i could've respected that.  If you had a policy about $5 minimums, I could've respected that.  If you had a policy about every customer ordering something, that would've been fine.  You just made up your policy on the spot after assuming the worst about a paying customer.  That's terrible service.\n\n4.  Here's what I recommend you do in the future if you want to retain customers:\n\na. IF you feel its important to use draconian policies, post them explicitly or have the guts to state them explicitly and fairly.\n\nb. Even better, keep things vague, but start by politely asking people to order more, or expressing your anger that we brought soft drinks into your cafe - maybe if you'd been up front we could've worked out a mutually agreeable solution.\n\nc. When in doubt, don't nitpick over whether a customer is paying you $2 or $5 for a seat at a table.  You may find that the customer likes your tea, likes the ambiance, and decides to write their dissertation sitting on your couches, drinking cup after cup in the future.  Instead, you get no $, one pissed off neighbor, and an accurate, fair, and negative review on yelp.  \n\nGood luck in the future with your business.\n\nBen", "author": "Ben M."}

That's fine. But considering it was iced tea I assumed (wrongly) that there would be free refills. \n\nSo when I went back up to the counter the girl asked me if I wanted a refill.  I said yes. She filled it up and said it would be $2.19. \n\nAwkward moment. \n\nI told her that I thought there were free refills. She said (awkwardly but polite) that it doesn't say that on the menu. \n\nTrue. But I challenge you to find me a place that does give free refills for iced tea that has a menu that says free refills for iced tea. \n\n\nI questioned them a bit saying that it was just iced tea. Because, come on, this tea was not the same as artisanal coffee or even tea hand picked by monks in the pyrenees. And if they do use a special artisanal tea then save yourself some money and buy Lipton's. Because it tastes the same. \n\nBut that's neither here nor there.\n\nAfter another awkward moment where I was waiting for them to say something other than \"two-nineteen\" I handed over the money and took my iced tea and walked away. \n\nSo I made a mistake. A wrong assumption. And I guess I was waiting for them to say \"hey, we understand, you made a mistake. It happens. Have this one for free. But know in the future that refills cost $2.19.\" \n\nThat would have been kind, polite and it would have been good business. \n\n But they didn't say that. And it cost them a customer. I meet with a friend once a week. We've been going to Borderlands. Guess what? We're not going there anymore. \n\nI know, it sounds petty, even to me. But it hurt. Way down deep inside. Where I'm soft. Like a woman. \n\nSo you got my $2.19 this week (well, $4.38). But you're missing out on the other 50 weeks of the year that I meet my friend. And you will be. Because I'll be looking for a new place among the other 50 coffee shops in the area.\n\nBut this is all in the interest of feedback. I learned something. From now on, everywhere I go, I will always be skeptical and ask ahead of time if I get free refills on iced tea. So thanks for that! \n\nI do want to say though they were very sweet about it (as sweet as a shrug and a \"sorry\" can be). Just not very smart about it.", "author": "C h."}

And now that it is open, I have become a fan of the cafe, as well. Which is not to say that my review should be discounted because of bias. \n\nThe No Wi-Fi policy is a refreshing concept. I like the good intent behind it --- originally, the cafe founders wanted to create a community spirit. Certainly, the cafe loses customers because of the policy. But I've seen many customers still show up with their laptops. While the intent of the policy may have been a bit high-minded --- for example, I like the tabletop signs that politely suggest we all have a neighborly attitude, but let's get real: I've encountered customers sitting at the communal tables who don't exactly have the community spirit --- the No Wi-Fi policy proves that this cafe is still legitimate, and perhaps even moreso than others. Like me, people still go to Borderlands with their laptops, if only to do work without the distraction of going on the internet.\n\nAs of this writing, the owners are still posting an apology at the cash register in regards to their \"slow\" service. I am amused. No, the service is not a rapid as what you get at Starbucks, but then again, THIS IS NOT STARBUCKS. This is a locally-owned small business with a community spirit at its core. Folks who come here looking for a quick fix will be sorely disappointed. This is a place where community and commercialism blend harmoniously. This is a place where you can read a novel, write the Great American Novel, and not feel out of place. This place is the real deal.\n\nNotes\n\nBorderlands Cafe takes debit and charge cards. \n\nThe pastry selections are revolving and limited. Generally, the pickings thin out by late afternoon. \n\nI highly recommend their meat and cheese plate, which is their substitute for selling sandwiches. If you are a vegetarian, they have an equivalent plate, which I have not tried, but I have spied and it looks as appetizing as its meat counterpart. \n\nThere are many places to sit, but weekends are busiest. \n\nThe cafe is sometimes closed for private events, but a sign will be posted to let you know. \n\nOccasionally, the cafe remains open for special events, like one weekend when the bookstore had a sidewalk sale. Sometimes, board gamers come into the store and take up one or two tables. I have seen a book club or two meet here as well. Generally, expect lively traffic on the weekends.", "author": "Joseph R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-14", "description": "I've never seen anyone so concerned about a bagel.\nA woman yelled, \"poppy seed bagel with cream cheese!\" loudly for a third time after receiving no response. She had the kind of worried look a mother has when they lose their child at the county fair. She emerged from behind the counter and paced the length of the cafe trying to recognize the person who had ordered the poppy seed bagel with cream cheese, but had no success and returned to her station looking more worried than ever. She consulted her colleagues and three different people were now involved in the situation. One of them, decidedly more cool and collected, once again announced in an unperturbed tone, \"poppy seed bagel with cream cheese...\" in stark contrast to the frantic tone that the original person was using. \nEventually, the woman who had ordered the poppy seed bagel with cream cheese heard their call and casually walked up to the counter completely unaware of all the trouble that the staff had gone through to get her attention.\n\nThe people who work here are all very good. They are nerds, which is no surprise because the place is attached to a science fiction bookstore. I've never seen such a concentration of nerds in one place in the Mission. These are real nerds too, not fake ones who like to call themselves nerds because they were thick framed glasses and read Foucault. Nerds don't read Foucault. They read Piers Anthony, and I'm sure the entire staff at this establishment is very very familiar with Piers Anthony. I felt a sort of camaraderie with the people working there because I too used to be a nerd. It's true that since then I've started reading things like Foucault and now sport thick framed glasses, but deep in my core I'm still a nerd, and proud to be so.\nA quality that all these nerds share is a sense of duty to complete the task assigned to them, faithfully, throughly. These are virtues that were no doubt passed on to them by the heros and heroines of the books they read. In the context of a cafe it makes for a very considerate and helpful staff as the scene I retold at the beginning of this review demonstrates. These people actually give a shit. When you go to most cafes in the mission the staff, whether or not they are competent in their role, at the very least seem completely aloof and uninterested. This isn't the case at Borderlands, every single person working there that I observed this morning was without exception extremely dedicated. Personally, I don't care whether the staff is interested or not as long as they get me what I want, but I was still extremely impressed by the people working at Borderlands.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is unique too. There is no music, which makes for less distraction (I'd be horrified to hear what these nerds listen to anyway...). There's also no wi-fi which avoids the annoying high-tech crowd that go to other cafes, like The Summit. Pretty much it's a place for people go to read, write or to enjoy quiet conversation with one another, and I think that's swell. Every time I've been there I've always found a place to sit, and there are a lot of couches which I've always preferred to chairs. \n\nHighly recommended.", "author": "David V."}
