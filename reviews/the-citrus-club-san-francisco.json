Growing up with a culturally retrospective eye, I was fully excited to finally visit Haight-Ashbury, and see the Stonehenge of 60s counter-culture. Yet, I soon realized that the restaurants and diners abundant in the area were difficult to sift through.

Of course, in an effort to find where the locals were loyal to, I turned to friendly Yelpers. \n\nThe Citrus Club might be easy to glance over when you're walking down the street, but as per a raving endorsement, I paid a visit. Super glad that I did. \n\nInside, it's trendy and modern, the lights are low, and the ambiance is welcoming. Taking a seat at the bar, my comrade and I had a front row seat to the chefs and their woks. We ordered avocado summer rolls, some sort of sweet bok choy and mushroom dish, tofu pad thai, and the khao soi. The bok choy/mushroom arrangement came out first, and although it was probably a little sweeter than I would have preferred, it was a delicious appetizer and gave me confidence in the rest of the selections. The summer rolls were fresh, large, and perfectly accented by avocado (I'd never tried avocado summer rolls before). Finally, the pad thai and khao soi came out. Immediately, we noticed that the portions were enormous, but as hungry as we were, we were happy to make some very large dents in the dishes. The pad thai was one of the better renditions of the dish that I've had in recent memory, and the khao soi was a large bowl of delicious broth and freshly flushed ingredients.

The spices were so strong in the broth that I couldn't taste anything but cinnamon.  A giant hot bowl of cinnamon broth.  The taste carried over into the noodles.  The meat was about the only edible part of the dish. Additionally we ordered the Pad Thai.  The flavors were all off.  Hardly any of the sweet tamarind taste that american pad thai is so famous for. Instead the chef put way too much green onions into the dish so that noodles tasted like nothing but onion and the lemon I squeezed on top.  Very disappointed. We came to Citrus Club because of the rave reviews, but now I am wondering how anyone can eat there.", "author": "Garrett M."}

Ler Ros is in an altogether different category than Citrus Club and I didn't come here expecting anything vaguely \"authentic.\" But even so, Citrus Club served up some objectively mediocre food in a zero ambience/character venue. The chicken noodle soup was lukewarm, as though it had been sitting around for 10 minutes- a cardinal sin for pho! Definitely no where near warm enough to soften the raw bean sprouts. I'm not sure how that was even possible (other than it actually sitting out in the cold) given we were sitting a few feet from the open kitchen. The broth itself was alright- not too heavy in thickness or in saltiness- and came in a big ass bowl with a healthy serving of chicken. \n\nWe also ordered the Basil Shrimp special which was supposed to come with stir-fried ramen. The dish was drenched in a sweet and mildly spicy brown sauce and the noodles were not ramen, but rather the super thin cheap yellow Chinese noodles you buy from Ranch 99. Portion size again was large, but didn't make up for the fact that the you couldn't pay me to eat the noodles. Finally, the $4.50 price point on the Thai iced teas is one of the highest I've seen, ever (not at all commensurate with the divey, no frills venue). The iced teas were decent and as a semi-lactose intolerant customer, I appreciate the fact that they use soy milk (although shouldn't they give ppl a heads up in case ppl have a soy allergy?). But they could definitely lower the price point by a solid fifty percent. Folks keep raving about CC as a cheap, no frills comfort food spot. But it's neither. Spots like Ler Ros, which serve up far tastier and more complex dishes, have the same, if not a lower, price point. Another example of confusing Bay Area yelp reviews!", "author": "Jen H."}

We went at about 3:40pm on a weekday, so of course the place would be relatively slow. Thank god because I heard that the lines could get long. Upon arrival, I waited for my friend as the server allowed me to look over the menu until my friend got there. I already had an idea of what I wanted. I like how they have different menus for the different times of the day. \n\nOnce seated, I knew I wanted the watermelon sweet iced tea, GET IT! You won't regret it one bit. We ordered the beignet flight(a sample of each) original, chocolate, Granny Smith apple, and of course the crawfish beignet. I knew I had to try the crawfish because that's what they were famous for, but hey why not sample everything. My favorite would have to be the crawfish and the original. I know it's weird, but it think the simple pleasures in life are kept simple. We also ordered the shrimp and grits since the 'in between' menu wasn't that large of a selection. The server also asked us if we wanted a side of biscuit with the grits. We said sure, knowing we weren't huge fans of biscuit. But, I was unhappy when I found out that it was an extra $2.25 and I wish the serve told me since we were all loaded up on carbs from the beignets. I mean, nonetheless the biscuit was good with the shrimp and grits. I've never had grits before, so this wasn't a disappointment. The shrimps were nicely seasoned too. The bill for 2 watermelon sweet tea, beignet flight, and shrimp was grits totaled out to be $33. Which wasn't bad at all. We were both definitely fully stuffed. \n\nDefinitely come back whenever it isn't busy, although parking may not be the best.", "author": "Audrey K."}

You don't want to wait in line with all the pretty, gaunt, un-showered SF folk. You don't want to see another menu of small plates, or 'family style' grub, or molecular works of edible art. You just want a big bowl of noodles all to yourself, dammit!\n\nOn these nights, you should take your cheap, greedy, noodle-craving bum to the Citrus Club. You absolutely can't go wrong. \n\nIt's a small place, and gets easily packed. But trust me...stick around, the tables turn fast, and the saucy dishes are worth the wait. On this particular Thursday they happily let us snag seats at the bar, without any bureaucratic chastisement from a hostess. First come, first-served; the way God intended. I like this place already! \n\nWe debated over the long, luscious menu of noodle stuffs - all incredibly well-priced, with appetizers from $5-8 and mains from $8-13. And look at those plates! Someone is taking home leftovers, that's for sure. I ordered the Zaru Soba appetizer (buckwheat noodles, seaweed, fresh tofu and wasabi), a generous mound that could have been my meal. But I can never resist those Vietnamese spring rolls and the delish allergy-inducing peanut sauce (yes, I'm officially allergic, but not ready to quit). The spring rolls were sliced up into 6 shareable pieces, and the sauce was thick and spicy, just the way mama likes it. I also tasted Jojo's coconut curry noodles: creamy, carby, spice-a-liciousness, with plenty for lunch the next day.\n\nService was impressively prompt considering how packed they were, and the dude behind the bar was sweet enough to 1) plug in my friend's cell phone to let it charge while we ate, and 2) run out into the street with her credit card, which she'd dropped on the floor after we paid. Double unnecessary-niceness points! \n\nI officially heart this place. I sure hope they don't raise their prices to match their popularity.

The amount of noodles and broth vary from day to day, and if they skimp on broth, they charge an additional fee when you ask for more.\n\nThe staff is generally friendly, but recently they got some new people, who definitely do not understand the meaning of customer service. A few weeks ago, my friend and I received the wrong soup with our order. When we asked for the correct soup, she said I would have to pay for it since I had ordered it. However, when I explained that there was no way I ordered the soup since I am allergic to its ingredients, she insisted that I was wrong. To her credit, I do not remember the exact words or moment that I ordered the soup, but I was disappointed that she would not give a regular customer the benefit of the doubt. I know others who have experienced this, too. \n\nIf you want a cheap meal on a cold night, this place may make your belly very happy, but this and other locals' experiences have left me jaded about this place.

Though we have always discussed that we would try something new on the menu, we always resort to the soups, which are perfect compliments to one of the many cold days here in SF. I tried the pad thai once and found it unappealing and tasteless.  The soup is the item to come here for. \n\nAlso, the service is hit or miss.  On most occasions, we get an amazing server.  However, there is one that tends to ignore us after we have had started on our third beer.  I have uttered many unfathomable names under my breath in relation to that server.  But, alas, it has never deterred me from coming to our weekly soup spot.\n\n100% give it a try!!!", "author": "Jenn S."}

Having grown up eating Vietnamese food, I'm generally sceptical about encountering Vietnamese food at non-Vietnamese places, but I was impressed here. The spring roll was incredibly fresh--everything from the vermicilli noodles to the rice roll was light and springy. Importantly, the peanut dipping sauce was amazing--not too salty and not too light--and perfectly complemented the spring rolls.

The take-out experience was also fine. JJ doesn't eat fish or mushrooms and I was one a no-nut (amongst other things) homeopathic thingy so we opted for the Vietnamese tofu spring rolls, vegetables with tofu (variety of veggies were nice and fresh, minimal tofu), and grilled chicken and grilled short-ribs, both of which came with delicious garlic noodles (yes, yes, leftovers!). The chicken was awesome, the ribs were tasty but a little tough and dry. \n\nSo, yes, it's \"asian fusion\" I guess. Not that I care. But if you want Authentic, this isn't your place.

The size was good, but the quality of the wonton was doughy and the noodles al dente. Definitely not good to get such a simple dish so wrong. My friends did like their dishes. \nOn top of that, their restroom was locked. After an hour, we asked about using the restroom, and the staff just said it was occupied. When we loudly knocked on the door, there was no response. The staff was unconcerned, but my friend, who is concerned for all living things, suggested to call the SFFD, because obviously someone has passed out in the restroom. Then the staff said they didn't have the key to open the door. My friend reassured them that SFFD didn't need a key, they will bust the door down. By now we are the last patrons and the staff seemed more interested in closing up than the person locked in the restroom. My friend finally had enough of inaction, she called 911 to make a report. Now the waitress is pleading to the rest of us to convince my friend that calling 911 is not necessary. \nMy tips for Citrus Club are:\n1) empty your bladders before going to Citrus Club. \n2) make sure the restroom is functional at the Citrus Club before ordering a pitcher of beer (which was good) or drinking most of the broth (it was tasty).\n3) don't order the Citrus Club's wonton.\n4) if you can overlook the fact that locking the restroom is not to code, you will also have to stop yourself from wondering what else is not to code at the Citrus Club.", "author": "Spencer F."}

It was late in the afternoon so the restaurant was pretty empty - perhaps a couple of tables occupied.  \n\nA couple of us had the Thai Coconut Wonton Soup and another of us had the Shrimp Spring Roll and a Thai Tea.\n\nThe Wonton Soup was pretty good and certainly different from a typical wonton soup, both in the presence of coconut in the broth and the use of of rice noodles.  The broth was tasty and the serving generous.  The spring roll was fine, though nothing special.  The Thai Tea was smaller than we're accustomed to at some other restaurants and at $4.50 with no refills, I thought it was a little pricey.\n\nSo the food was decent if unspectacular, as was the service.  So why only two stars? Because from the moment we entered the restaurant to the time we left, they were blaring loud non-stop hip-hop.

The food is either really over the top or it is on a single flat note. It's like saying the guy you had a date with last week was really nice. Nice, but not interesting enough for a second date. Every time someone suggests coming here, I cringe, but think, \"hey I must be picking the one bad thing from the menu.\" So I've given this restaurant a few too many tries throughout the years... but I'm thru pretending..

The restaurant is cute and very tiny but if you're looking for a peaceful place to enjoy your meal and have a conversation,  this is not it.  The seating is very overcrowded and the noise level is loud. I ordered the pad Thai(I love pad Thai and it's the only thing I get at every Thai restaurant I go to) and it had no flavor and the noodles were very overcooked and mushy, worst I've ever had. If you're looking for traditional pad Thai, look elsewhere, they put tomatoes in theirs along with other undercooked vegetables. Mine also had undercooked chicken, wasn't kidding when I said worst ever, it made me sick.", "author": "Adrienne F."}

Fourth we saw her putting our food in to go boxes and she only put half of our food in to go boxes. If I ever walk into there again and she is there we will choose some where else to eat.

Furthermore, what is the protocol on drunk yelp-reviewing?\n\nIs it.... objective? No. Ethical? Mmmm No. Approrpiate? Proooobably not. But F it. It's happening. It's happening riiiiight NOW.\n\nThis is why Citrus deserves at least 4 stars: they had to freaking deal with my group of friends. That alone, is definitely 4 star worthy. Not only did we show up, pre-liquored up from another restaurant, but we proceeded to completely fill their reservation chalk board with doodles and requests (*insert drawing of chinese dude* and \"feed us now!!!\"). We were very very.... very loud, drank waaay too much sake, dropped stuff, spilled drinks, stole other table's chopsticks, interrupted other people's dates and then ordered even more sake.\n\nOur server deserves a purple heart for that stuff- AND she did it with a giant smile (and the ocasional giggle when my friend did something stupid). Thank god for you, lady.\n\nDon't get me wrong, drunken dining is all the rage, but you still need to have damn good food. One thing to note when you come here is that this place is Thai-Japanese fusion, so don't expect to see your traditional Chang/Singha beer, red/yellow/green curries, pad siu, som tam and all other traiditional Thai dishes. You CAN expect good food though. My Pad Thai was far from traditional - they used a thinner noodle and a creamier base, and although my Thailand days make me crave the legit stuff, I have to admit that this version was absolutely amazing. It was less eggy, a little bit sweater and I could have probably eaten a gallon's worth of it. \n\nSo why the -1 star? Well, my snobby-ass self wants to go full 5 stars (its usually my standard for drunken dining, if you haven't noticed already) but the lemon & ginger chicken and Thai iced tea were pretty flavorless. Minimal complaints though. Most of the food is still rad, prices are decent and the environment is awesome for a fun dining experience. \n\nI suggest all of you to try this place [to get/when drunk], but don't tell them I sent you...

It's too bad their food sucks.\n\nTofu and Seaweed Salad: Very good seaweed salad, but it waserved ringed with blocks of cold, raw, plain tofu with a dash of chili powder for color. Who does that? Pale, uncooked tofu is like the food equivalent of a dementor in Harry Potter -- it sucks the happiness out of anything nearby. \n\nSpicy Coconut Lemon Chicken: In spite of its name, this dish delivered only bland, strung-out flavor with a hint of spice and an almost criminal lack of saltiness or any sort of richness. In fact, this item was almost weirdly bad, considering that it contained some good looking ingredients. \n\nPad Thai: Another strange dish that must have taken a special effort to fuck-up so badly. The poor noodles were smothered under an odd, sticky, gloppy sauce that was too thick to coat them and, instead, just sat there looking pale and yucky. It had an unpleasant washed-out rancid peanut taste and, as with the spicy coconut chicken, a studied lack of any richness or savoriness. Just bad.\n\nGarlic Beef with Shitake:  Uhm ... this was delicious! I mean, this dish was somehow really, really good,. The mushrooms were rich and flavorful, redolent of star anise, soy sauce and garlic. The beef was flavorful and tender and the chow fun noodles were perfect. Lucky for me, this was my entree.

An ice cold Sapporo and Vietnamese spring rolls and beef satay later, we were happy campers.  It was awesome that they had Sapporo ON TAP at the bar.  Maybe the East Coast isn't as friendly to Japanese beer as on the West Coast, but this was one of the first times I've even had the option of having a draft Sapporo.  \nAnyway, the spring rolls were nice and fresh, and the beef satay was decent.  \n\nSince we were sitting at the bar, we would see all of the food and drinks coming and going from the kitchen to the tables.  We were intrigued by the waitress stirring cream into this dark orange liquid, so we asked what the concoction was- turned out to be Thai iced tea.

Afterall, with two superior Thai places on the same block, what reason do I have to frequent this place?  It's true that they have more of a specialty in noodles, but I never found their noodles to be that special.\n\nIn fact, I once went to get lunch takeout from them, and decided to get their special that day, the \"jade noodles\" that are supposed to be made of spinach, I think.  Sounds good, right?  Oops, wrong, of course.\n\nNow, I was not aware that spinach was in the family of glow-in-the-dark vegetables, so imagine my surprise when I opened the container, and found that the noodles were this color: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_green_%28color%29\n\nIt reminded me of playdoh, which, while I did in fact eat at some point in my life, is now off the list of foods that I regularly consume.  It was unnerving, to say the least.  I tried a few bites, and while it wasn't the worst thing I've ever tasted, it did not make up for the unholy food coloring used.\n\nThis experience traumatized me so much that afterwards, everytime I am tempted to order jade noodles from other restaurants, I would ask the waiter what color their jade noodles were - are the the green on that man's ugly sweater? Or are they the natural green of that dying plant in the corner? \n\nThat said, I recently gave them another chance and had their chicken noodle soup, and it was delicious.  The portion was so large I ate out of a mixer bowl.  It was perfect for a rainy Sunday night.\n\nSo...in conclusion, I think the quality of their food can be a little mixed.  I will probably return on another rainy day, and get their soup noodles, but I am staying far far away from their jade noodles from now on.", "author": "jon y."}

It was busy, but we were seated pretty promptly. \n\nThe server with glitter all over her face seemed pretty dazed from the permanent burning man that must be her life and went from saccharine sweet to total bitch mode when she realized we weren't going to all order a full dinner. Apparently they have a $9 minimum before drinks, per person, at dinner hours. This wasn't posted anywhere in the restaurant or on the menu. The server stormed off before asking if we'd like to order more, or sit at the bar, or order to go. \n\nAwkward. We walked back to the bar area, where there was no one waiting for a table. There were 3 vacant tables in the restaurant. \n\nI had my heart set on soup and decided to order to go. Everyone working completely ignored me for 10 minutes. I was finally able to order from the dude at the bar and was told my order would take 15 minutes. Went down the street for a bit and returned 20 minutes later. I was ignored AGAIN for 10 minutes. After which time the dude at the bar glared at me and told me my order still wasn't ready. Waited another 5 minutes, got my food, and left. \n\nMy bill came to $20. Which is only $7 less than their \"minimum.\" We would have been happy to order more if we'd been treated with more respect and the server had given us that option. \n\nI regret leaving a 20% tip but I'd rather kill people with kindness than follow their bad example and be an asshole. \n\nAs someone who works customer service jobs 6 days a week I feel like I have a right to expect the same kind of service I provide people. I deal with my share of assholes, and know what it's like to have to follow certain rules within a restaurant, but I also know how to treat people with kindness and respect, and be honest about wait times.\n\nI've been a regular customer at Citrus Club for 5 years now, used to eat here several times a week, and in the last year I've been by at least once a month.

You can forget talking to anyone you brought with you.\n-The usual standard thai dishes are not standard, but not in a good way. Dishes like pad thai, satay, tom yum soup, etc. taste really odd and have weird ingredients and/or texture for the dish. (For example, the peanut sauce for the satay is as thick and chunky as peanut butter. Why is unclear.)\n-Soups are served in bowls the size of your head. Possibly larger. I would prefer less with more quality.\n-Noodles are really overcooked.\nThe highlights:\n-It's open later than most restaurants on Haight St.\n-They serve beer, wine and a few kinds of cocktails.", "author": "Veronica J."}

I had all but written this place off but I decided to give it another try. I had the Ginger Salmon on noodles. It was delicious.

I was always curious how they could afford to do that and I suspected it was cheaper quality ingredients. One day I found out they use COTTON SEED OIL. YUCK! All those oily dishes are soaked in the industrial by-product that is cotton seed oil. I don't go out to restaurants very often anymore not just to save money but for health reasons as I try to limit my toxic load. I assume many places use GM oil, but cotton seed oil has got to be one of the worst, if not the worst. It's insulting that they are okay serving their customers this crap. And the fact that their dishes are soaked in it in order to mask the dullness of their other most likely cheap/low-quality ingredients is disheartening to say the least! Don't eat here if you care about your own body or supporting a business that further contributes to the toxification of our society! \n\nFurther reading on cottonseed oil:\n\nhttp://agriculturesociety.com/politics-and-food/whats-the-truth-about-cottonseed-oil/", "author": "Macaulay H."}

In such situations, Citrus Club does the job to satisfy all my slurpalicious cravings. I've been coming to this place ever since my older sister introduced it to me my freshman year of college. Now she lives in Portland, and when she came down for my graduation last month, she gave me a big ol' kiss when I suggested the fam eat there for lunch. Even my parents, who aren't the most adventurous when it comes to dining in the city (they prefer chains and overpriced restaurants on the Wharf when they're visiting from Hawaii) were more than satisfied when I brought them on one of their previous stays, and were enthusiastic to eat there again. I love sharing places I love with people I love!\n\nI've read some of the others reviews saying the service here is really bad, but I honestly have never had a problem with it. While the wait staff (mostly sassy hipsters) do seem a little nonchalant, they're usually pretty efficient with bringing your food, water, check, etc. The place also does tend to get more jampacked the later it gets, so I'd suggest arriving for an early dinner or dropping by for lunch, when it's usually less busy.\n\nI like the laidback, trendy yet unpretentious ambiance of the place too... though the sink outside the bathroom (lit by a single tealight?) has always puzzled me a bit.\n\nAs far as food suggestions go, I've tried a lot of different things and only remember being disappointed a couple of times--I think with the hot 'n sour noodle soup (too much of an overpowering flavor) and the peanut noodles (kinda bland). Other than that, the broth in most of their noodle soups is amazing, and my personal favorite, the garlic beef and shiitake mushroom noodles, has a hint of Christmas in it... yummy!!\n\nOh, and who could argue with the undeniably reasonable prices? You can throw in a couple of appetizers, a pot of oolong tea, and STILL have cash leftover to buy that cd you've been looking for at Amoeba after lunch.\n\nWith all that said, my favorite pan-Asian noodle shop, though hardly Asian besides its main staple, earns a stunning four stars from me.", "author": "Kate V."}

I LOVE FOOD! and I've eaten at this place often enough that, even from all the way across the country, I feel like a local every time I eat there, and that's a good feeling.

Waiters are attentive, seats are mostly comfy, but it can get a little drafty in there on chilly days. \n\nAnd yeah, I said \"almost consistently\" with the food for a reason. The soups are usually REALLY delicious (and huge), and I've never been disappointed with any of them that I can remember (I've tried almost every single one, Hot & Sour, Tom Ka, Chicken Noodle, etc.) but some of their noodle dishes can be hit or miss.

The Citrus Club is described as being an Asian-Fusion place, which to me kind of just means Americanized Thai/Chinese food.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, especially in regards to The Citrus Club. \n\nI'm in love with one specific dish that I must order every time I come here, but luckily my friends are more adventurous, meaning I've gotten to try a bunch of other things too.  Still, in my opinion, the Mandarin-style chow mein with beef is the best dish on the menu.  If you sit at the bar, which can be a better option when dining alone than waiting an hour for an actual table, you can watch your noodles being wok-fried to awesomeness and brought immediately over to you.  The beef that they cook up is also great, all very lean and never overcooked.\n\nThe pho-ga chicken noodle soup is also superb.  Once when I had the flu, my roommate returned home from a Haight thrift-store spree with this soup in hand, swearing it had magical healing qualities.  I admit that at times I can be a bit of a picky eater, so I was a bit skeptical when I saw that the soup is served with basil, chilies, lemon and bean sprouts.  I don't know what I was thinking, because that sounds amazing, right?!  Like I said, I was sick.  Anyway, one bite of this stuff and I was feeling 100 times better AND had a new favorite rainy-day treat.  \n\nI really like eating here because its small size ensures I feel super cozy while eating, but the wait time can get up there and make me HANGRY (a very real emotional state in which one subconsciously becomes angry by virtue of the fact that one is hungry). I definitely wish The Citrus Club took delivery orders, but I like it enough to risk feeling hangry.  Just don't talk to me until I've had that first bite of chow mein.", "author": "Christy J."}

I was seated at the bar, and served by a fairly abrupt, slightly distracted bartender. I decided on the Garlic Beef & Shiitake Mushrooms noodle dish & some draft Sapporo beer. I was served a tasty cold beer and an intimidatingly huge bowl of noodles, with a heap of beef & mushrooms & bean sprouts on top. I was really taken aback at the size of the bowl...! I delved into it and went as far as I could - the beef was tender and the soupy broth was tasty. However, I was a bit grossed out by the fleshy shiitakes, and for a finish, I threw my hands up, defeated by the great depth of noodles and soup still awaiting me in the huge bowl. \n\nThe dish was initially tasty and filling. However, by the end, I felt slightly nauseated by the sheer volume of it. Sometimes, less is more...\n\nAlso, possibly, lunchtime may not be the time to go to the Citrus Club. There's none of the seductive, hip quality I recall from my last visit. Instead, in the daytime, the place feels slightly dingy, and the staff are busy with their backroom chores, keeping only half an eye on their lunchtime customers.", "author": "donal c."}

I'd had a long weekend of Outside Lands and was not about to trek anywhere so I walked up to this joint and ordered chicken noodle pho to takeout.

At all. I know, blasphemous. But they do have a lot of other good things to sink your teeth into. When my girl & I go out to eat, we go to feast. Case in point, we ordered:\n* shrimp wanton- good tasting broth & spinach, but only had 4-5 shrimp wantons\n* from the grill ginger chicken & garlic noodles- it might be the filipino in me speaking here, but i really wish i could have had the chicken with rice.\n* fresh spring rolls w/ peanut dipping sauce (i'm not a fan of this appetizer from any restaurant)\n* shitake mushroom & beef noodles (did not taste the beef, but the noodles & crispy sugar snap peas were great)\n* chicken soup (did not try, but looked very light)\ntotal: $47 (not including tip.)\n\nObviously (or maybe not so obviously!) we had a lot of food to take home.

Luckily, it took it less than ten minutes this time around. We got seated very fast, because the restaurant was almost empty. They came to take our order very fast; barely had time to look at the menu. \n\nI was very mixed with the garlic edaname. Some were warm, and some tasted very cold but the flavors were good. \n\nHowever, the worst plate of food I got was the grilled shrimp and scallop with garlic noodles. The most expensive item on the item was also the most unappetizing thing there. My shrimp and scallop was completely dry and burnt in color. It was cold!!!! It appeared that someone had completed the cooking process, put it in the fridge, and then took it out. The garlic noodles were so sweet and drenched with sauce. There was no hint of garlic in there. It just tasted like the egg noodles you used in chow mein. I asked them to redo the skewers of shrimp and scallops and they said it was going to take a long time. It was almost like they were trying to deter me from making the decision from having it cooked again. After 15 minutes, I got two hot skewers and again they were burnt and overcooked.

Citrus Club is Asian Fusion and they are famous for their noodle soups and dishes from Vietnam, Thailand, and China. Apparently, its name comes from substituting all the heavy oils which are mainly used in this type of cuisine, for citrus! \n\nI arrived around 715 pm last night and it wasn't too crowded.  I was waiting on my two friends to arrive and the server just told me to take a seat at the bar and that we would be seated immediately upon their arrival.  That wasn't the case.  It started to get busier and busier, and after the others arrived, a different server told me we needed to sign in on the chalkboard, which I wasn't even aware existed.  We then had to wait about 15 minutes, which wasn't too bad.  It's definitely super tiny inside and there aren't many tables.  \n\nWe started with the garlic edamame and the shrimp spring rolls.  Both were awesome, especially the garlic edamame. I could've eaten the entire plate...! Between the 3 of us, we had the Beef Pho, the Tom Kha Thai Coconut Tofu Soup, and the Shanghai noodles.  The beef and udon noodles were served with bok choy, shitake mushrooms, with a flavorful soy bean sauce. All were tasty with very strong flavors. The soups were yummy and perfect since I'm a bit under the weather.  The beef pho was very ginger-y tasting and the beef was sliced very thin had a wonderful consistency to it.  \n\nI definitely plan on coming back to Citrus Club. We each paid about $25, which is pretty reasonable for 2 apps, 3 entrees, and a bottle of cabernet.", "author": "Jenny W."}

The food, as I've mentioned before, is just packed with flavor and the meat is always cooked perfectly. My Sapporo went down way too quickly so I decided to step it up a notch and order some sake (don't judge!

The restaurant was practically empty, so the two of us took a 4-top table. The next time she came over, she told us bluntly that we had to move in case a larger group came in, despite the fact that there were other larger tables available and it was an off-hour. While we were gearing up to move after a bit of an annoyed back-and-forth, she put a Reserved sign down on the table right in front of us and walked away. She was stone-faced and inattentive the rest of the meal. The experience would have been salvaged if the beef and chicken pho weren't quite literally just flavorless broth and meat. Even the sriracha being masked as authentic chili sauce couldn't save it. Maybe the rest of the menu is more promising, but as a past server and restaurant manager myself, you couldn't pay me to go back to a place where the service feels much like a visit to the DMV.", "author": "Jana B."}

I say this because it can be hard to achieve the mind/body connection needed for your overstuffed belly to override thoughts like \"there's no way they would give me enough food for five people\". Especially if you are drinking, say, a delicious electric blue cocktail. Case in point: I consumed half a bowl of tofu peanut noodles here three days ago, and haven't had to eat since*. \n\nThat said, I've been here several times, and I like the concept (nooooodles! yum), as well as the general vibe of the place. The service has always been good, and I don't remember being displeased with any of the dishes I have ordered/tasted. I wouldn't make the trip if I weren't already in the immediate area, but it's a solid option when you're in the Haight.

But I'm also wary of Asian fusion food, and this restaurant definitely pushes me over to the \"hell-nooo\" side. Sorry, I don't think I'll be coming back to this place. I don't know if I was reacting to the citrus that the restaurant uses to substitute heavy oils in the cooking, but the flavors just didn't resonate with me and were actually weirdly unpleasant. \n\nThe edamame appetizer was slimy, and the soybean pods were way overcooked to the color of a dark grey-green - just the opposite from how they're typically served in many Japanese restaurants. I ordered the shrimp wontons in soup with some hope but was fairly disappointed. The dumplings had an untasty peppery flavor, while the soup was super bland and dominated by ginormous slices of carrot - a weird combination to begin with. I tasted my friend's garlic noodles and tasted not garlic but a soupy soy-based sauce that was again, bland and unpleasant. \n\nOne upside is that our waiter was super friendly and attentive, even as the place was packed and the line went almost out the door. If you sit at the bar, you can watch the cooks working hard behind the glass, and I must say the portions of the dishes we saw were quite large. But considering I didn't like what I consider to be pretty basic dishes, putting that much food in front of me wouldn't make a difference for me at this place.", "author": "T. K."}

Not too sweet and not too rich, the Citrus Punch would be a good hot day treat although its fairly filling so imbibe with care if you are waiting for your meal!\n\nThe service was pleasant, but really lacking. When we walked in, we were handed menus and told to pick a table of our liking. When we went to sit down at the table we chose, the waitress hurried over and encouraged us to \"find a different Seat\". This was a little confusing as the place was relatively empty (mid afternoon on a Sunday) and she had just told us to pick anything. Whatever, it wasn't a huge deal just a little odd since no explanation was offered! Food was served up quickly, but water was never refilled and the waitress had to later be flagged down to get our check.

The pho & spring rolls were decent, nothing to rave about... but as Peter Griffin would say, \"You know what really grinds my gears???\" waitresses who have attitudes when they really shouldn't.  That's what really grinds my gears!\n\nThe whole thing came about after a very wild bachelorette party the night before.  We were tired, hungover, and probably still semi-drunk but very well behaved patrons despite the conditions.  All we wanted was some sugary / syrupy / soda goodness but alas, the restaurant was out of soda water or something like that.  \n\nOur very very sober and chivalrous friend ran to the corner store to appease us with our soda of choice.  I like my cola BUTT freezing cold so I asked for a glass of ice.  The waitress then proceeded to say we couldn't bring outside beverages inside.  I completely understand when it is something the restaurant provides, but considering they weren't able to that day, it was completely ridiculous not to allow us to go get ourselves some sodas from outside.\n\nSeeing that we had a reasonable argument, she obliged but then proceeded to give us attitude only Asian women can (trust me, I know, I am one too), ignored us the entire time, practically threw our food at us, and just had a stick up her butt the entire time.\n\nI guess I should blurb a bit about the food just to be fair.  The spring rolls were decent.  We were famished, it was there, I ate.  I can't say I really liked the pho.  There was WAY too much cinnamon in there.  With pho, I love the broth, and they really ruined it with that cinnamon.  Completely RUINED.\n\nAfter this review, I know I will no longer be welcome at the establishment, but I could care less.

I am not a big fan of fusion food for this very reason: trying to do it all means the food comes out rather mediocre. \n\nAlso, I thought it was rather pricey - $8 for a bowl of noodles???\n\nBut hey, there were people in there, I was tired of walking and they actually had Zagat stickers everywhere. That means at least a good handful of people like this place so it must be worth a shot. \n\nMy sister had the garlic beef and shitake mushrooms; I had the spicy lemon and coconut chicken. They were both pretty yummy so I stopped feeling like I was being ripped off. \n\nMy spicy lemon and coconut chicken was not very spicy and not very coconut-y and a little under-seasoned, but I have a rather bland palette so this didn't bother me so much. Others might not find it as flavorful so maybe a little salt will help. \n\nThen, as I continued to work on my bowl, I realized that I was barely making a dent in the noodles - there was SO MUCH food! They definitely do not skimp on the chicken; I kept encountering more and more as I ate. Most places would give you a handful of chicken and leave you to get full on the noodles. Definitely not the case here!\n\nThe only problem I have is with the servers. The two women who take care of the tables on the floor are rather strange and anti-social for servers. They do not speak beyond the minimum - if that - and they don't smile. But the girl at the bar is much more cheerful and hospitable, so if you're not with a large group or don't mind sitting at the bar, go for the bar if you want a more lively server. \n\nOtherwise, a pretty yummy place with very, very large portions at a suddenly quite reasonable price.", "author": "Christine C."}

This review was prompted by a recent visit...\n\nCitrus Club is a pan-asian noodle bar, halfway between a shoddy thai restaurant and a fairly good Pho stand. This is California, not Ho Chi Min City nor Bangkok, and a neighborhood with few ethnic vietnamese and thai. Citrus Club is dumbed down to American palates. It works in this neighborhood, it wouldn't in the Tenderloin or Richmond, or ... it is what it is and the food reasonably priced and of decent quality.\n\nWhatever happened to the management of this place? Our last visit was like visiting the zoo on a sunny San Francisco day. The entrance was blocked by a bicycle, but there was an empty bike rack right outside. We were handed menus and instructed where NOT to sit, then waited. Our waiter was new, in fact, the entire wait staff was new, and the attention we got somewhat rushed.\n\nOur appetizers and entrees arrived before our drinks. We complained, the waiter offered to comp the appetizer in lieu of taking back the hot dishes. We were then visited every four minutes, \"is everything okay, are you done eating?\" Too much attention, or a subtle \"finish and get out\". \n\nIn short, if you're seeking an ethnic dining experience, this is not the place. If you're expecting exemplary service, order each item category and have the waiter come back after you get your first course. If you want real Pho, go visit any number of restaurants in Little Saigon or the Sunset west of 19th. Citrus Club is one of the few 'okay' places on Haight that serve hot food for a reasonable price.

Throughout my entire life I've always been to hole-in-the-wall noodle places that offer the authentic goodness found nowhere else so I was somewhat skeptical about the \"Asian\" food here. The restaurant itself has a nice look and vibe and was small enough to create an intimate atmosphere.\n\nTo start off, my friends ordered the garlic edamame for appetizers, which I liked, but I would take regular non-soy sauce drenched edamame over that any day. \n\nI ended up going the safe route ordering a bowl of chicken noodles. How does it compare to regular pho? Well, it wasn't bad but you really can't beat the real thing. At least the pricing was somewhat similar. Drinks there I thought were kinda pricey so I had to settle for a soda. Some of my friends ordered a mushroom noodle dish which I didn't get to try but it looked a little more appealing than my plain bowl of noodles.\n\nI found this place to be like the Chipotle of Asian food. If you're in the mood for Asian, I would recommend going to an actual Asian joint. The Citrus Club is better for groups and dates looking more for a cool place to eat and order Asian inspired food.

This bar/cafe has a surprisingly cool, hip atmosphere, and my girlfriends and I enjoyed watching all the hipsters who apparently flock to this place. With seating options at the bar, booths, or tables, there were several other large groups, so we figured that we'd picked a pretty popular spot.\n\nPerhaps I just ordered the wrong thing, because a lot of my friends seemed happy enough with their meals... but, word to the wise: do NOT order the Pad Thai. I should've known better than to cheat on my favorite Thai restaurants with this dish (I'm sorry, KoTNH#2, it'll never happen again), because the one here was pretty disgusting. Not only that, but they got my order wrong - which happens, of course - so I calmly and patiently explained this fact to our server (after trying for several minutes to flag her down, even though she was right across from our table). After I politely explained the issue, she responded by giving me the mother of all death stares, snapped that it would take another half hour to have the correct dish brought out, and ever-so-helpfully suggested that I \"just deal with it.\"\n\nAt this point, I figured that I might as well just eat it, since this was a simple matter of taste, and not anything so drastic as an allergy issue. I had about 10-15 bites, each time willing myself to keep shoveling the food down because I would \"like it eventually.\" The tofu was tough, and a weird consistency, and the flavors were super bland. Not even my friend S, who likes pretty much everything, would touch my dinner. \n\nThe pros: The portions here are huge - which was unfortunate for me - but a big plus for people who actually like their food! And again, the cafe/bar has that \"effortlessly cool\" vibe... so it might honestly be a better place to grab a drink and people-watch.

The atmosphere and surroundings were great - relaxing, and super chill, as were the staff.

But being Asian myself, working in Asian restaurants and sampling foods from various Asian countries, the taste of Citrus Club cuisine seems watered down and very American-style. Traditional Asian foods are robust with flavor and I was very, very disappointed in the Citrus Club.\n\nI had high hopes to start with because we ordered the chicken satay appetizer - which was delicious, but not hard to mess up. Then came the entrees - I ordered the Pad Thai. I'm a die-hard Pad Thai fan and I love it slightly sweet and almost too spicy. I almost cried into my Pad Thai after my first bite. I almost wished I didn't quit smoking so my dead tastebuds could enjoy it. It tasted more like a white person's chow mein. That being said, my (white) boyfriend ordered the chow mein, which was equally disappointing. He added chicken but sadly, the chicken couldn't save it. Lastly, our other out-of-town friend ordered the Shanghai Noodles - and boy, am I glad we passed around our plates. The Shanghai Noodles were the best of the 3 plates, but that's not saying much.

Maybe I didn't order the right thing at all, or perhaps my expectations were a little higher.. I mean, you are a noodle place. I'd expect ALL the noodles to be good.  Why specialize in noodles if they're going to suck?  \n\nMy Shanghai noodles were edible - lots of beef/chicken and tofu. Portion was huge, so you get your money's worth in size. As far as taste, it was just drenched in teriyaki sauce, and the noodles reminded me of the instant egg noodles that come in a bowl. You add water, let it sit till the water sorta goes away, and then you drench it in sauce yourself - the kind that comes in a separate little packet with the bowl. Do you guys even know what Shanghai noodles are SUPPOSED to taste like?\n\nIf I didn't have to wait so long for this, I might've enjoyed my experience more. Atmosphere is interesting, and the place is packed, at least I know for a Thursday night. Water was often refilled. 11 of us were snugly tucked into that one circular booth facing the front of the place... It was a little difficult getting the servers' attention, but it was packed...\n\nShanghai Noodles? Again, I say - barely edible.

Lunch and dinner are both reasonably priced, I don't think anything on the menu is over $11.00. They have HUGE portions and the best Thai Iced Tea (they use soy milk instead of condensed milk.) They seat you quickly unless it's a Friday or Saturday night when you will end up waiting 20 minutes or more. They have a waiting list, and they're really good about it, so if you feel like waiting, then go for it.\n\nAh, but the food sure is worth the wait. I have tried at least 6 things on the menu and my favorites are the Jade Noodles with Shrimp (a mound of spinach-flavored noodles, with coconut milk, shrimp, garlic and snow peas, sprinkled with chili flakes) and the Hot and Sour Vegetable Soup (a sink-sized bowl filled with Tom Yum broth, broccoli, baby bok choy, and tofu.) The Garlic Edamame are to die for. I don't know what it is about their garlic sauce, it's just so delicious. I agree with some reviewers that the food is pretty Americanized, so if you want a more authentic Pho or Thai dish, go to the Inner Richmond (Clement Street.) \n\nTheir sauces are not oil-based which is what they mean by \"healthy\" on their menu. I've had some of the dishes that people have mentioned were bland. I don't know why some of the dishes have SO much flavor and some have none. I've been disappointed a couple times. I don't necessarily like their peanut sauce, it needs more kick. I brought my best friend to the restaurant once, and she happened to get a bland noodle dish. We \"fixed\" it by pouring the leftover sauce from the Garlic Edamame. Problem solved.\n\nVegetarians love this place because they offer great veggie and vegan dishes. Where else can you get vegan Thai Iced Tea, or Barbecued Tofu Spring Rolls? Their specials almost always include some appetizer of vegetable and tofu soaked in their famous garlic sauce. \n\nCitrus Club is probably the most appealing at night, when you've been walking around Haight Street and you need a drink. Come in, sit down, eat a huge bowl of steaming noodles, drink a sake cocktail, beer or plum wine. Eat some dessert. Go home full, happy and reeking of garlic.", "author": "L. L."}

Granted, it was a Saturday night and I had a group of 6 people, but we waited an hour and a half for our table.  That would have been ok if the food was good, but it was a big fat let-down.  Half the dishes I tried (garlic beef and shitake mushrooms, Shanghai noodles) were decently tasty--pretty much your standard oyster sauce-flavored, pan fried noodles.  They were verging on too salty though, with none of the rich \"wok hei\" flavor that is the hallmark of really authentic Asian noodles.  Maybe I'm just a noodle snob, but you can get some freaking delicious noodles in the Sunset district that would blow these out of the water.\n\nHowever, two of the dishes I tried were just plain disappointing.  The \"house pad thai\" was a complete misnomer.  The noodles were too thick, covered in a sticky peanut sauce reminiscent of the \"pad thai\" that involves half a jar of Jiff.  The tiger shrimp curry noodles were flavorless and sort of sour, although I give the restaurant props for generous portions of delicious shrimp in the dish.  \n\nOh SF, I expected better from you!  Now that I live in SoCal, I like to visit my former home and remember the good food times I had up there.  Citrus Club just made me sad...  Ok, maybe that  was a bit dramatic.

The place can be really busy on the weekends, so plan accordingly. Luckily, Citrus Club's Haight Street location has a lot of time-killing options. I've been a few times and can comment on the following:\n\nChicken satay w/ peanut sauce - pretty straight forward. Kind of dry.\n\nFresh shrimp spring rolls w/ peanut sauce - very well packed with noodles, mint, shrimp, lettuce. The 6 piece order is large enough to share with as many as three people.\n\nThe Thom Ka Chicken (coconut broth with carrots, cabbage, snowpeas, cilantro, galanga, onions) is hearty and rich in coconut flavor, with plenty of veggies and fresh herb flavor to mix things up. Slippery rice noodles and chewy chicken pieces provide texture.  It is pretty hard to screw this up. Can also be ordered vegetarian. \nNote: all the soup bowls are practically as big as your head! This is a three-serving alert!\n\nTwice tried the Marmelade Coconut Lemongrass Shrimp with spinach noodles, snowpeas, and onions. For the most part, the dish makes good on its delectable sounding name. Impressed with the amount and size of shrimp. As expected, the marmelade/coconut sauce is sweet and creamy. Then again, I will lick clean the plates of anything that has coconut milk sauce in it. One fatal flaw: spinach noodles tend to be overcooked and mushy, rather than with a nice bite. \n\nLast night, I ordered the Yellow Coconut Curry Tofu & Nuts (flat rice noodles, tofu, peanuts, bean sprouts, cucumber, carrots, and onions in a \"a sweet and spicy curry sauce\"). DO NOT ORDER THIS DISH! Call me demanding, but I expect something proclaiming to be a curry dish to taste like curry. Or at least for the love of Vishnu, taste like SOMETHING! I managed to salvage this dish at home by boiling up the leftovers with some chicken broth.\n\nMiscellaneous to note:\nCheap selection of Asian beers and other beverages (e.g., cocktails, wine). Service is not bad; waters were constantly refilled. Tables are superclosetogether, which can either be really annoying or fun. Do your table neighbors a favor and save up a really juicy story to tell your dining companion(s)...maybe it will help them forget how blah their food is.", "author": "Steph P."}

Of not the bathroom is tiny, with a sink facing the tables, so if you have to go tinkle, people will know about it.\n\nService:  Was prompt and fast by staff.  No white coats or party gloves, just people ready to get you in and out.\n\nFood:  Your pretty standard fare for Noodles.  You had wide selection of soups, egg rolls, and noodles of both the meat and vegetarian persuasion.  I had the Shrimp Spring Rolls, which were pretty good.  I then partook in the Garlic Beef and Shitake mushroom Noodles, and my friend the Garlic Shrimp and Shitake Noodles.  Overall, very good, with large portions and a ton of beef and mushrooms.

No a place I would bring the kids either.\n\nBling:  4 egg rolls where $4 bucks, and both noodle dishes were 6-7 bucks a piece.

For starters I would either go with the house garlic edemame or the spring rolls. The edamame are tossed with this amazing sauce to perfection and the springs rolls are served with this amazing peanut sauce. For a main course I always have either Hot and Sour soup or their Yellow curry with tofu and nuts. The soup is a great blend of spicy and tasty veggies, as well as a little bit at the end.

All they seem to care about is to churn the tables, and get their tips. One of the Asian girls working there, a pretty face with a very foul mouth, made it abuntantly clear that all she cared for was the money. \n\nI would not recommend going here. This is a service economy, and I think these Asians need to be reminded about that. The customer service attitude at The Citrus Club is no different than any of the multitudious Chinese restaurants in San Francisco. I am sure you know what I am talking about.

I went last night, and remembered why I don't go out of my way to eat there.\n\nIt's too bad, because I really want to like Citrus Club.  It's convenient, it's definitely a good deal in terms of prices, and the concept is great.  But somehow the execution falls flat.\n\nI guess what really bothers me is the translation from menu description to actual entree.  Every dish on the menu sounds fantastic - I love pan-Asian noodle dishes, and I should be loving this food.  As others have pointed out, this place smells amazing - just walking by the restaurant, your nose draws you in.  But every dish I've ever had at Citrus Club ends up being disappointing.  The food is just bland!  It lacks flavor, tends to be sweet rather than spicy, and tastes like it is trying to be \"health\" food.  As my dining partner said last night, halfway into her dish, \"I'm bored.\"\n\nThe other issue I have with Citrus Club is the service.  I'm not expecting five star dining type of service - this should be a friendly neighborhood casual dining hang-out, not Gary Danko.  But despite the frenetic pace of the wait staff, we had to wait a really long time to get our food, the staff seemed to avoid us when we tried to catch their attention to ask about the food, and the order was wrong.  I'm sure we could have asked for the food to be fixed, but after waiting 40 minutes to get our dishes, we didn't want to risk another long wait.\n\nCitrus Club isn't awful.

I did have one traumatic instance when I eagerly opened my leftovers bucket only to discover that the waitress had given me someone else's leftovers -- someone not even from my table.

I would even say very good. No, no, no ... it's not Gary Danko. But it's super tasty. So let's appropriately adjust our expectations for a dish that's less than $6 and praise these noodles for what they are. I recommend.... everything.

We began our meal with Vietnamese spring rolls, made of fresh ingredients and a tasty dipping sauce that had a slight sweetness to it. My boyfriend had the Pho-Ga chicken noodle soup. The right amount of seasoning AND enough meat and noodles to leave full for the rest of the day. I had their house pad thai which was awesome!* It sorta tasted like an asian inspired pasta because the sauce was very creamy, but it was still very delicious. To top it off, I had the citrus punch, a citrus-y slush, to relieve my tongue that had been throbbing from the spicy sauce provided. Yeah, I'm a light weight.\n\nHighly recommended for casual, relaxing dining.\n\n* Awesome is the highest form of flattery...for food, at least :)", "author": "Angela H."}

It has one small window, and I remember there being a lot of red... I don't remember whether that was because there was a red light, or red walls, or red paper lanterns or what... but there was an essence of red about the place. In a nice way. \n\nI had forgotten that I actually like this little place. Usually when I order a small salad, I expect to get a little plate or bowl of greens. This was a HUGE bowl STUFFED with freshly chopped greens with fresh cut, uncooked mushrooms carrots peas, and a a tangy citrusey dressing. I couldn't even finish it! \n\nMy boyfriend got some sort of creamy prawn noodle dish, which was delicious. A little carb heavy for me, but not unexpectedly so.

And this place will *make you wait* and keep you a little anxious that you might have missed your name being called amid the deafening din of the space.  Come to think of it, maybe this is a deliberate tactic to get you to order multiple sake martinis once you finally sit down... The line seems to go faster if you have get there early (before 8) and/or have a small party - each time I've been, I've noticed two people go way faster than 3-4. One person who'll sit at the bar will have hardly any wait.\n\nHowever: delicious, veggie-friendly, cheap, quick, and unique fusion-y food makes it worth it in the end, and makes your out of town guests who just waited with you outside in the freezing fog for an hour see what the fuss was all about and thank you profusely for dragging them out there.\n\nI especially like the veggie spring rolls and the cranberry saketinis which I compulsively order every time.  My fave noodle dishes are the marmalade jade noodles with coconut shrimp (for which they will sub tofu, both are good), and the garlic noodles/shiitake mushrooms with either beef or shrimp (and which I've only had with tofu).  I really did not like the Pad Thai or the peanut noodles, and the yellow curry tofu was meh.\n\nSo maybe it's hit or miss with the noodle dishes, you have to yell to be heard across the table, and there aren't a lot of great tables for groups in the place - groups of 3+ get to sit by the bus-room, bathroom, or at the humongous round table in the middle... well, I guess it must be either the crack in the peanut sauce or the saketinis that keep me hungry and ready to come back.", "author": "Laura T."}

Last night I met some really cool folks at a Bay to Breakers after-party and we ended up here.  I remember being shocked at how long the wait was, but I soon realized that most wise drunk people share the same sentiment; good noodles are worth the wait.\n\nJust when I started contemplating why someone would have even named a noodle place \"The Citrus Club\", we ended up finding four stools at the bar which, by the way, had a bunch of great beers (including Sapporo!) on tap.  I remember the inside being kind of dim and red, and though it was kind noisy, none of us really had to raise our voices to hear each other.  The menu was comprised of a variety of noodle preparations from various Asian countries, which ranged from Pad Thai to Pho.  I ended up deciding on chow-mein (since it was my first time and chow-mein is like the Optimus Prime of noodles), and was thoroughly satisfied.  The portion was absolutely perfect, and the noodles were prepared just right with texture being very consistent.  It even had some generous chunks of mushroom!  During our experience, we consistently received friendly and fast service.  \n\nThe Citrus Club never claims to be anything it isn't (except for maybe a medicinal lemon and lime club), and delivers on all important aspects of noodle service.

Small intimate environment.  It's a small place.  It's not large and scary.  That said it's usually going to be pretty packed.  Go in, get a drink, and put your name on the list.  I had the Citrus Punch with Nigori and it was blended so well (yes blended fruity drink) that I didn't even taste the alcohol at all or notice it.  Hence my buzz 3 minutes later.  \n\n2.  Huge portions.  If you are on a diet, you could maybe get one order and split it between 2-3 ways or take it home and eat 2-3 more meals depending on if you are a girl or guy.  Or you could pig out like we do and just not eat for days after.  (KIDDING!- kidding about the not eating, but not kidding about the pigging out part!)  \n\n3.  Despite huge portions, you have CHEAP and reasonable prices.  When you are in a tough economy like we are, this is key.  When I say reasonable and cheap, we're talking about appetizers that run from $4.95 to $6.95 and huge noodle dishes running from $10.  (BTW, remember that $10 goes for 3 meals)  \n\n4.  Carb lovers paradise.  Can we say NOODLES?\n\n5.  Variety- ranging from the starters and bar snacks ( satay, tofu, stir fries, soba, spring rolls, soups, salads, edaname) to the soups and noodles (pad thai, chow mein, peanut noodles, shrimp) and the grilled stuff like short ribs, anyone loving Asian cuisine and noodles will be happy!  \n\nOne thing that wasn't the highlight for me: the garlic noodles that came with the short ribs: weren't garlickly at all.  Maybe because I was mentally comparing to PPQ garlic noodles, or maybe because I couldn't taste even a BITE of garlic, but they were a huge let down.

I wouldn't say anything was really spectacular but it is a good place to go to hang out with friends who don't appreciate the dumpy authentic noodle joints and want a reasonably priced fresh meal ($6 to 8 for a noodle entre).

So, a little confused, and a little disappointed.\n\nTime has passed since then, and I now work on the street. I decided to give it another try recently, and had the cold coconut lime soba noodles. Pretty good. Not mind blowing, but pretty good. A few more weeks passed, and then San Francisco turned into an OVEN. Cold noodles sounded like the only edible thing, so I ordered the Zaru Soba. THAT was delicious! Cold soba noodles, tofu, and wasabi with a bit of wakame salad on top and some soy dipping sauce. The best part was that it was only about $4. \n\nCitrus Club has won me over.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-08-16", "description": "***Edit Oct 7, 2011***\nOh Citrus Club, I feel sad typing this.  I've been eating at your restaurant faithfully since ~1999 and have had many memorable times there and with your take out.  However, the last few times I've been, in the past year, things have been less than your previous high standard.\n\nLast night for example, I asked to take home my favorite hot & sour soup w/ tofu and was only given a small portion of what I had left in my bowl - what happened to my other half of soup?!  I think you only filled 1 takeout container when really, my leftover soup would have filled 2 containers.  The containers are smaller than they were 5 years ago. I was disappointed I did not get all the food I paid for, this after tipping 20%.  \n\nAlso, the back corner upstairs harbors flying bugs.....had to swat the bugs away constantly through our meal.  \n\nUsually their takeout process is swift and efficient.  The last time I was there for pick up, it was 5pm on a weekday and empty.  While I waited in the front of the bar for 30 mins, my food was not ready.  I inquired and nothing.  Finally, I could see the kitchen forgot my order.  Ok, that can happen, but how did they miss the order from the one person standing right in front of them!  NOTE:  their takout portions seem less than their in house portions for the soup. \n\nOverall, the experience has declined.  \n\nOLD REVIEW from 2006:\nMy comfort food!  I've been eating here since 1999 and nothing else satisfies me the way Citrus Club does. \n\n When I was not working, I would come here at 2:00pm and sit by myself reading a book while working on a bowl of noodles for over an hour.  The waitresses got to recognize me and I started getting even faster service.  They are fast and not overly friendly, which is fine with me.\n\nNow, I call for take out.  My fave:  Hot & Sour Tofu.  There is always a line, but take out takes only 10 mins!\n\nOh, don't ask for rice; they don't serve it.  It is a NOODLE house.  And don't expect it to be thai, or vietnemese, or chinese in cuisine only.  It is a blend of influences.  And it's cheap!", "author": "Yelper H."}

The first time I came here, it must have been a weekday because we were seated fairly quickly, but the second time, we waited for close to an hour. The atmosphere is really nice. The lighting is dim without being totally dark, and there are nice touches to the lamps and walls and stuff. We were at first seated at the corner table, which smelled like anything from garbage to public bathroom to sewage, depending on the angle, but the waiters were kind enough to let us move to a less, er, fragrant table.\n\nSo really, the main attraction here is the food. That's the way it should be, and that's really all I base my ratings upon. Someone here mentioned that the waiters are sort of inept at times, which is true, but the FOOD.\n\nI have had two things, both noodle-based, which as far as I'm concerned, is where it's at. The first time, I had a soup that is similar to pho, though I don't remember what it's called, and it was deliciously flavorful and a little spicy without ever being bland or abrasive. \n\nThe second time, I had the lemongrass coconut spinach noodles, which comes with onions and snowpeas. I would probably eat a tire if it was cooked in enough coconut milk. But not all coconut is created equal, and this was a higher being. The noodles were perfect, the snowpeas crisp, the onions cooked EXACTLY how I like them: not bitter but not soggy, and on top there was parmesan cheese (I think) which seemed weird at first, but then again, everything is fusion around here.\n\nI tasted some other people's dishes, and had the spring rolls, and everything was good.

For dinner I had a Yellow Coconut Curry, that I think the cook forgot to put the sauce on. No flavor whatsoever. Just noodles, cucumber and carrots. I should have returned it.\nThe next day for lunch I ordered a Pad Thai.  It was bland and flavorless. It could have been much better if it had more peanut sauce and grounded peanuts instead of whole peanuts here and there. The noodles of both dishes were great though.\nNevertheless my husband had a great experience. Both of his meals were really good. For dinner he had a bowl of Pho soup that was great. The next day lunch he had a cashew chicken that was really good. I was jealous!!\n\nThe place is very nice and clean with modern decoration, friendly people and good service. The prices are very good, cheap in comparison with other restaurants. The only thing is that the tables are too close to each other and at dinner is a little loud in there. \nI will go again and ask to put more flavor on my food :)", "author": "Patricia D."}

Stay away from the peanut noodles, unless you like noodles with a scoop of crunchy Jiffy on it. That is really the only bad choice on the menu. \nThe only problem with this restaurant is the wait.

The waitress never came back with the change. It is not that we are cheap but it is not the waitress' decision to decided to keep the entire amount without even asking.  We waited. Asked for the change 3 times. By that time, my friend was annoyed. The waitress acted like she didn't speak English for a while. We sat waiting. When she realized we weren't going to just leave like everyone else she pulls this scam on, she brought over the change. She went back and forth to the kitchen and to the register several times and then emerged from the kitchen of all places, with the two $20 bills that we had given her. She had never even put the cash in the register (yes, we watched her). She brought back $5 and some change. By then my friend was super annoyed. It had taken her longer to get the change than it did to eat our whole meal. My friend was angry and only left $2 on the principle that this woman was being bully. When we left, I said thank you to our waitress, and she just gave me a dirty look. The food was good but the experience was ruined by the greedy waitress. Had she had been professional, we probably would have left her a $10 tip. Unless she is the owner, I don't know why she didn't put the cash in the register. She hadn't even entered the $40 payment to the register. She ended up having to do so to get change minutes before she came to us with the change.

I heard so many positive things about this place, that I was really happy. The wait wasn't too bad because we chose to sit at the counter. \n\nMenu came, we chose an appetizer of Beef skewers, one of the special items (Garlic-Ginger Chicken on a bed of stir fried noodles with bok choy) and an item on the regular menu (Stir fried Spicy Curry Tiger Prawns). The skewers came first, and they were slightly burnt. The meat itself had a very odd texture to it, almost not beef tasting. It wasn't really marinated properly, just tasted like someone just slapped on some beef on a BBQ and served it to us. The dipping sauce of peanut something was bland as well. \n\nAs for the main dishes, my boyfriend's dish, which sounded so delicious, basically (I swear I'm not making this up) tasted like, again, someone throwing some chicken on the BBQ and serving it to us. The chicken was placed on a bed of noodles which tasted more like teriyaki noodles with bok-choy than garlic-ginger. No meaningful flavors in the mouth, just teriyaki and grilled chicken. \n\nMy dish, had no Tiger Prawns. Tiger Prawns are big. My little shrimp were the medium size ones you buy at a grocery store. The dish basically consisted of this: Noodles that had some curry \"soup\" poured over it and shrimp thrown in. Top that off with Chili Powder and you have spicy. However, again, no medley of flavors dancing around in my mouth. If you took the noodles alone and ate them, they tasted bland. You had to skillfully grab the noodles and \"soup\" to get the flavor. \n\nOverall, the dinner tasted very amateur. If you've never eaten really good food, then you won't know what I'm talking about. The price is good; the food is really average though. \n\nI'm an optimist and gave Citrus Club another try with some friends, and again, I walked out disappointed.

Pick a dish and next thing you know you've got a giant plate (or bowl) of food in front of you.  I've had both the Grilled Ginger Chicken noodle dish as well as the Peanut Coconut Chicken dish and both were great.  Unlike other noodle places, they definitely don't skimp on the meat, as both dishes were loaded with chicken.  You start eating ravenously, get full but then find yourself picking at your dish until it's gone.  You know, you hit that point where you're saying to yourself \"If i keep eating I'll feel disgusting\" but in this case you decide you won't feel that bad.  The Spring Rolls and/or Garlic Edamame make excellent starters.  \n\nYou walk in and feel like you're in some backalley kitchen in Bangkok or Hong Kong but then you proceed further to see quite a posh restaurant.  The low lights and candles are a nice touch.  There's a full bar with Sapporo and Gordon Biersch on tap.  Probably the only knock is that there isn't much on the menu that isn't noodles, in case you're with some people interested in different fare.\n\nYeah, it is definitely small and not recommended for parties of more than 5.

The prices are good for the huge amount of food that they give you. Definitely two, maybe three meals in one dish. \n\nThe only thing that I didn't like about the restaurant is that it's so dimly lit.

It's reasonably priced - last week the total for 3 entrees, apps and tea was around $30 - and there is always something on the menu that matches everyone's taste.

Always quick, down-to-business, friendly service - even when busy. It's got more of a modern flair than a typical Thai/Vietnamese restaurant, but that's what makes this place great - it feels authentic, yet it's like a step above the ordinary drab surroundings found in similar places around the City.

Came here last Saturday for lunch with my girlfriend and this place moderately met my expectations. Upon arrival, we were seated right away. We ordered edamame for an appetizer which was reasonable. My gf ordered the house pad thai and I ordered the shrimp curry noodles. A big fan of pad see ew, the noodle game was different, but a change from the norm and I this dish made me more of a fan. They didn't put much shrimp in the dish but that's a given for most places. The house pad thai was really good. The portions of the two dishes we had were good enough to feed 3-4 people.

Usually, couples get in quicker due to the high number of two-person tables. \r\n\r\nNothing beats their lemon-lime sake martini for starters. They offer a wide selection of spicy, sweet, and hot noodle dishes. Everything on the menu tastes great, that's the amazing thing about Citrus Club. However, if pressed, I'd absolutely recommend the vegetarian spring rolls and garlic edumame as appetizers, tiger shrimp over jade noodles or spicy coconut chicken as main courses. They also serve an exotic-tasting fried banana dessert which is *very* good and not too sweet.\r\n\r\nOverall, it gets five stars for the lively, yet dimly-lit setting (which makes for a romantic and cozy date), excellent service, and affordability- dinner for two with appetizers runs less than 20 dollars.", "author": "Alex G."}

I ate some curry noodle concoction that was super bland.  But the kicker is that I went here on a weeknight with a couple of girlfriends to relax and have a mellow dinner.  We were still chatting and finishing our beers when the waitress started giving us the evil eye.  Ignoring her, we continued to talk, drink, etc.  A few minutes later, the waitress came over, and asked us to leave!?! Because they needed the table!!?  What? We were not even finished with our drinks?!?! What kind of service is that.  1 star for this place.  I will NEVER go back and I always tell this story every chance I get.", "author": "Alison O."}

The garlic edamame is fabulous and the serving sizes are huge so for the price its a great deal. Some of the noodle dishes are a little bland though, I had the orange citrus noodles with chicken and they were orangey but thats it, they really needed another dimension, like mint or cilantro, I had to add a bunch of soy sauce but then it was decent. On the other hand my bf's soup was fabulous so I think its kind of hit or miss on certain dishes. We had good service and it wasn't at all crowded at lunch time (the only time Ive been) All in all I find them to be a good cheap and fun noodle place.", "author": "Meg L."}

Since moving to the Upper Haight two months ago, I have probably averaged having Citrus Club's Marmalade Coconut/Lemongrass Shrimp Noodles twice a week.  The portion size is large enough for two meals if you can take half home, which makes the price a VERY right $4 per awesome noodley meal.  The wait for your noodle order isn't very long, but, if you desire an appetizer, get the House-Garlic Edamame.  Seriously.  Now, I can't give a full five stars because 1) I've yet to find another dish as good as the MC/LS noodles, 2) the wait for a table, due to Citrus Club's popularity, is often unbearable, and 3) I don't like the idea that noodles can have such power over me.

What I think I love best about this spot is along all my different food habits, from vegetarian to carnivor'ian... I can always get my order tailor made.  Not very many joints can do that and still provide good flavor.  CC wouldn't be consistently packed in the way it is, if it wasn't good...  \n\nOkay, so I can admit that sometimes the service is slow, and the spot itself is a bit cramped.

I went back the other night and I can't believe I've waited so long to write a review. This unassuming little hole-in-the-wall situated in upper haight was one of the best things to happen to me since moving to SF. It's my go-to comfort spot after a long day, and never fails when I wanna take out of towners to a reliable restaraunt from a locals p.o.v. I've had quite a few of their menu items, but it's always the Thom Kha that gets me. Take anything you've ever thought about any other underfilling over lemon-grassed thom kha and throw it out the window. Here you are served a bowl of soup as big as your face, loaded with rice noodles and heaps of veggies and tofu (meat and seafood may be added as well) and a broth that will put all other thom kha to shame. The wait can be pretty long, but I've recently discover that if you sit at the bar, you can still get great service and our meal came out in about 5 minutes!

Some of my staples are the shrimp Vietnamese spring rolls, Coconut Marmalade Chicken something noodles and the Shitake Beef Noodles (with the wide Chow Fun kind) All that for around 17 dollars.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-02-09", "description": "This place used to be my top choice for cheap, healthy food, but their awful service and witless food prep has forced me to all but cross it off my list for good, with only two dishes that are worth suffering through the terrible service nowadays.   The story isn't pretty; read on if you must.\n\nIt was cold out.  I was in the mood for noodles.  I wanted to try the Sweet Chili-Glazed Tofu & Greens.  The bouncy waitress wrinkled up her face and shook her head, \"It's not good, it's too sweet.\"  But I like sweet, I told her, I usually get the Marmalade Coconut, Lemongrass Shrimp.  By the way, what kind of waitperson badmouths a dish and tries to talk a customer out of a meal?  Puzzled, I scanned the menu for another dish that was new to me, Yellow Coconut Curry Tofu & Nuts.  I attempted to order it.  The waitress suggested the beef special instead.  Copping to her game of trying to increase her tip by forcing me to order the most expensive dish on the menu ($12.95), I insisted on the curry noodles.  She shrugged.\n\n15 minutes later, a lukewarm, virtually tasteless blob of rice noodles appeared.  I had to search for the nuts, tofu and vegetables.  Although it was early in the evening and not busy at all, the waitress didn't check in with me during my meal.  I had to hail her down for the check, at which point she asked me if I liked the dish.  I told her that I wished I had ordered my first choice.  She looked blankly at me and turned on her heel.  \n\nI didn't want to let one bad experience stand between me and what has generally been a good eating experience, so I returned a week later.  I sat at the same table but had a different waitress.  I wanted to try that Sweet Chili-Glazed Tofu & Greens dish I tried to get the last time.  The menu boasts \"glazed crispy tofu\" which sounded just like what I wanted.   When I was served, once again, a solidified mass of rice noodles, I started poking around for crispy tofu pieces.  I came up with four soggy, tasteless chunks of very UNglazed, UNcrispy tofu.  \n\nI called over the waitress and asked her about the dish.  Did I get the right plate?  Did I misread the menu?  I was getting another blank look.  Doesn't the menu say crispy glazed tofu?  \"No, we don't serve anything crispy,\" the waitress tried to help me understand.  Apparently \"Pile of Jiggling Bland Noodles\" doesn't look good on menus.\n\nIt's time for this place to take inventory of what they do well and drop the act.  They do fruity drinks.  They have one outstanding soup, the chicken pho.  The Marmalade Coconut, Lemongrass Shrimp is tasty but definitely NOT a healthy dish.  What exactly is this restaurant about?  I think the waitstaff is as confused as I am.", "author": "Sarah E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-03-21", "description": "This place is perfect for the ultra-hip shoppers that patronize the outdoor shopping mall Haight Street has become. It is a small place with tables and chairs pushed to elbows distance from each other. If you are eating with only one other person, chances are you will be dining either with one of you with your back to the kitchen door and will be bumped occasionally by the hurried servers, or next to the hip beaded curtain that leads to the sink that is just outside the toilet room - which occasionally smells like a back ally used as a piss pot by drunks and bums. \n  The food is dropped at the table with all the care of an overworked single parent placating an unwanted child on the way out the door for a blind date at the local bar. \n This is a bit unfair, as I have occasionally been there and had a good server, but this is rare. The food is usually dropped off without a word, and good luck if you need something else. \n The food itself is okay, on average. Some of it is really good, some of it is beyond bland. Remember all those early vegetarian dinners that gave vegetarian food a bad name? Pasty and no flavor? Like that. \nTom Kha soup =  A+ \nPad Thai = What the hell is this?\n Pad Thai was white and pasty and flavorless. Oddly similar to a strange and tasteless jar of Tahini sauce I bought once. \n If you come with four people, and/or order liquor, the treatment and the table location greatly improve.\n Once upon a time I used to come to this place often. And, I admit, I am still occasionally drawn to this place for love of the large bowls soup. But the attitude has grown along with their prices, and I always leave in a bad mood. \n Tipping less than %20 is a crime to me, and places that make me feel taken frustrate me. And I don't need to spend what precious little fun money I have to be made to feel a nuisance to those taking it from me.", "author": "Miss Kae O."}

Like I said, I friggin love noodles, so it saddened me a little when I couldn't have a whole bite of mostly noodles. I'd say this dish about twice as much bean sprouts as noodles. There's also a pile of fresh cucumber and carrots on top, which I like, but I'm not the hugest veggie person so for me a little less would've been better. Apart from that though, it was delicious and I would definitely go back next time I return to Haight Ashbury.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-09-02", "description": "I have lived in the upper haight for 3 years now and decided that I would give this place a try, as I have not been there before. So, last night after hanging out with friends, I decided to go get some thai food. Now, this was not the place that we wanted to go to. Our plans were to actually go to Ploy 2 (a few doors down). However, Ploy 2 was closed. So being just a few feet away, we tried the citrus club. I have listed below a number of reasons why this place is so terrible. Furthermore, I recommend that if you want REALLY good food, go to ploy 2. Or for that matter, anywhere else besides the citrus club. \n\nReasons not to go: \n1. Terrible service (Our waitress maybe came to our table twice. And when she did, she was very bitchy. The bus boy helped us more than she did). \n\n2. The food (For all those that have written somewhat good reviews of this place, you must not eat good food. Here's what I got to say. The food has no flavor what-so-ever. I ordered the beef and broccoli dish and it was absolutely dreadful. It had no flavor, the beef was rubbery and furthermore, the noodles were very oily). My girlfriend ordered the sea food special and it didn't even have a taste to it. Another friend of ours ordered a tofu dish and she MAYBE took 3 bites of it, before telling us how terrible it was. \n\n3. Desserts (Now this is just terrible. If a restaurant can't get ice cream and fried banana's right, then there's a BIG PROBLEM! So, with that said let me elaborate further. I ordered fried banana's, first the bananas were not fried. Second, they put the ice cream on the same plate; it was to hot to even touch. It took about 2 minutes for the ice cream to melt and leave me with a big mess. I didn't even eat it, was a complete waste of money). \n\n4. Homeless kids don't even like the food. (I LOVE food, and hate to waste it. So, even though the food was terrible. I asked for it to be boxed up so I could give it to someone on the way home. This is were things get really funny. I gave the box to a homeless guy, and as I walked away I heard him say to his friend 'this shit taste terrible' and with that he chucked it into haight street). \n\nI hope that this helps the true lovers of food out there in their quest to have something that is satisfying.

The wait for the food was a little longer than normal, but the restaurant was pretty busy.  I'll take good food as compensation for a longer wait any day.", "author": "Catherine S."}

This came to a surprise when our first oriental food stop was Utopia Cafe, which sucked super major balls, the food was under cooked and lacked in style and favor, but that's another story.\n Walking down ashberry and Haight at night, like good tourist, we had a choice of pizza, Mexican food or oriental, and by this review you can tell what we picked. IT was our last effort for something worthy. And it did not disappoint. We sat down, and looked around. The platter's were huge and filling. Even though their were two of us we only needed one bowl, but the rules stated Seven dollar minimum per person, so we choose to sit at the bar, where there was no such minimum. We choose one of there specials and didn't expect anything good, we just hoped. While waiting for our meal, entertainment was offered by the wok cook (very fun). The food was served and it knocked me back, it was perfect, the spices were delicious, and food filling. Each bite solidified this place, and when the bowl was over, I wasn't stuffed, I was satisfied. Its what we've been looking for. And I'm grateful to have found it.", "author": "R H."}

If you like nothing else here you will love their garlic edamame!  There is almost always a wait and they won't seat you if one of your parties has run to the atm to get cash, they'll just seat the next in line.

I put my name on the list behind five or six other tables for two.  While we stood around discussing going someplace else, three of those tables cleared out lickety-split and we were seated within 10 or so minutes.  I got shanghai noodles (A+) and the lemon-lime sake martini (A++).  I definitely have to go back to try out the dozen or so other dishes I wanted to order but didn't have room for.  And at each dish coming in under $7 it's a crazy good deal.  The only cons, and they are slight, are that it's so freaking dark in there I could barely see the food on my plate and green tea ice cream with sake poured on top is a wretchedly bad idea.  Each served separately is fantastic but together... nay.", "author": "Susan W."}

The waitress was quick to point out that there was a $7.00 minimum per person. When we told her that one of us was would not be eating, she lunged for the fork belonging to the person not eating. She was going to make sure that he didn't eat.  In the end, we ordered additional dishes that more than covered their minimum. Then, we had to ask for the fork to be returned. When the food finally arrived it was warm, at best - certainly not hot. The Pad Thai noodles had cilentro and tomatoes in it - not exactly Pad Thai noodles. The waitress practically threw the bill at us - what an attitude. After paying, she brought the check, with lots of 5's and 1's - She actually thought whe was going to get a tip!. We watched other employees and concluded that the \"attitude\" must start at the top. Nobody was very friendly.", "author": "A C."}

THE OTHER 3 WAITRESSES WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE US THE TIME OF DAY.   So now to the food.  I ordered the 'Crunchy Noodle House Salad with (defrosted/pre-cooked) chicken.'  There was NOTHING CRUNCH or NOTHING NOODLE about the salad at all.  The chicken was nasty, COLD, and DRY.  They could've at least thrown it on the grill to warm it up.
