Best thing I've learned is you can take two drinks from here into the park! The drinks are more than half the price than inside and you can get good beers.  Be sure to tell them to give you it to go otherwise they'll pour it in a glass. Getting into the park from inside is super easy and there's no line. No better way to wait before the game. It gets crowded but it's game day, it's crowded everywhere. \n\nWhile waiting we got the nachos. They were good but a little different. Basically comes out as one big nacho. They deep fry tortillas instead of cutting it up. It works out well. You can some soft and some crunchy parts but does get a little messy to share.\n\nOverall great place and great atmosphere before the game!", "author": "Mark W."}

Every time I go here, it's extremely crowded because it's going to be right before a Giants game. And yes, we went to the Public House and won the game that night, so now I have to go to the Public House and order drinks before every game from now on.\n\nThe food here in general is pretty good. It usually takes a while to get because of how busy it is before games. To be honest, I haven't ordered food from here for a long time now because inside the ballpark has some amazing food as well. The bars are a decent size, but it really gets crowded since they're parallel with each other right in front of the entrance way.", "author": "Willie F."}

Within minutes of sitting down, we were created by our waiter who took our drink orders. It should be noted that this place has an impressive beer list comprised of many locally brewed beers.\n\nAfter we ordered our drinks we decided to snack on appetizers and ordered the nachos. After ordering, our food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and was well presented. \n\nThe food itself tasted great and the ingredients were of good quality and fresh. We also ordered desert which was just as good.\n\nAs far as convenience goes, this place is only convenient if you are attending a giants game or live in the area. There is no parking nearby and traffic in the area is a nightmare. \n\nThe inside of this place is plastered with televisions which would also make it a great place to watch the game if you can't get tickets. Just be warned, prices are a little higher than normal but that is probably due to it being located right outside the ballpark.\n\nOverall, I had a good experience and would come here again in the future.", "author": "Sean S."}

If you haven't heard about the impossible burger before, it is basically a burger patty that is plant based and doesn't contain meat - the perfect meal for vegetarians and vegans. I was really surprised by how good the burger was. It was juicy and even pink in the middle like a medium rare burger patty. I would recommend trying this! \n\nWe happened to come on a game day so it was extremely crowded. I dont like that this place is self seating so there are always people standing around aimlessly waiting for a table or eating on counters or empty spaces they could find. It felt very disorganized.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-13", "description": "So have you heard about the Impossible Burger? Well, Jamie W. read about it and thought we should try it here since we are on a continual quest to eat healthier. Sure, we've had veggie burgers before, some really good ones like the Black Bean Chipotle Veggie Burger at the Garden Grill up in Guerneville (photo: http://bit.ly/2sn9ifr) and our personal favorite, the Butterbean Burger at the Boiler Room Oyster Bar in Kinston, North Carolina (photo: http://bit.ly/2sAkJAS). So we were intrigued enough by this all-plant variation that we ordered a couple of the $14 ones they served here where our previous dining experiences involved jalapeno poppers, deviled eggs, their regular PH burger, and oh yeah, beer on tap to facilitate the guzzling of such cholesterol-infested grub.\n\nWell, apparently there is no cholesterol in an Impossible Burger nor antibiotics nor meat of any kind. What gives the burger its meaty flavor is heme, which is the non-protein, insoluble, iron protoporphyrin constituent of hemoglobin. Say what? I just copy-pasted that from an online medical dictionary, but that's what makes the patty look, smell, sizzle, bleed, and taste like a regular burger (photo: http://bit.ly/2rgs1pq). And amazingly it did. I was dumbfounded how a vegan burger could taste so carnivorous, but it did even if beef purists likely balk at the notion. It came with provolone melted on top with caramelized onions and a smoke & spice sauce to give it even more of a barbecue flavor (photo: http://bit.ly/2szkciw). Hell, I liked it.\n\nBut it's not a perfect substitute since it has five times the sodium and more saturated fats than a regular burger. It's also about the same number of calories in case you are counting, about 220 calories for the patty itself. Give us credit though since we did add the $3 Mixed Greens as a side rather than the fries and ignored the free chips on our plates (photo: http://bit.ly/2rgljQn). We also went with a $6 order of the Crispy Cauliflower with Sweet Pepper Relish, which was a pretty healthy choice for a bar bite (photo: http://bit.ly/2t0UJvO). The vibe was still the same since it first opened, still an extravaganza of flatscreen TVs in a warehouse-size space with a lot of loud youngsters. Regardless, I'd still come back for the Impossible Burger. It was delish...and so good for me?\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...that Impossible Burger seems kinda impossible and a bit overpriced but the meatiness tastes real\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...same loud, cavernous bar it's been since it opened \nSERVICE - 3 stars...perhaps tired from his shift, the first server seemed bored with us from the outset but the second was more enthusiastic\nTOTAL - 4 stars...definitely will come back for the Impossible Burger", "author": "Ed U."}

Public House was one of my first reviews here on Yelp........ Ah memories........  \n\nIts still holding onto its solid 4 stars. \n\nIts still pretty chaotic and they should perhaps explain the process better to people who have never been there. That being said, we did not have to wait long and soon found ourselves a table (carnival seating for those that have never been). Lots of draft beer to chose from and the food was good as always. \n\nFor this meal: \nTruffle Mac and Cheese Fritters: The only letdown. I know better and always order it, but the cheap truffle oil is always a disappointment. The fritters were well fried but the mac and cheese was mostly mac and needed more cheese. It was also a bit bland. We asked for a side of BBQ sauce and that kicked them up. \n\nCorn: The Elotes was good, but I would prefer it grilled instead of boiled but perhaps that is more of a personal taste thing. \n\nThe PH Burger: with bacon and the works it was really good. Cooked medium rare as requested it was juicy. The bun did not make it through the meal. The side salad was perfectly dressed and had really fresh greens. \n\nMy son also had a burger with fries and the fries were well cooked and properly seasoned. \n\nAgain the big plus to this place is that the beers are better, cheaper, can be put into a plastic cup to take into the stadium, and they have an entrance right in the back of the restaurant. The only caveat is that if it is a giveaway day, you do not get that item at this eneterance.", "author": "Fred T."}

We've never been for food, only pre-game drinks, so after our Giants Race today we decided to visit for food and drinks. Walking in the sign said 'seat yourself' We found a table kind of in the back and was ignored for quite awhile. Until a very nice gentleman asked if we were being helped (I'm assuming he was the manager). He took our Oder and our drinks came super quick! Only highlight of this visit. \n\nShortly after we noticed the bar tops cleared out and being that the Giants game was in in 20 minutes, we wanted to move. A woman came over and said she would be helping us going further. When I asked if we could move, she kind of got an attitude but asked if we'd cash out. I did and tipped her 20% despite her not being present for us.\n\nWe moved to the bar and the bartender was super grumpy. We already had our drinks but I knew I would want a beer next. I heard tell the guy next to us, rather rudely, that he would need to order a beer from the bar behind us. He did not explain why. The guy got a beer, his food and left quickly.  Apparently the tap lines were broken at the main bar, so the only draft beer was at the beer bar behind us. But if you had a tab open you had to go get your beer separately and pay separately to have a beer. Which I did and was rude experience #3.\n\nI wanted a light beer, the Kolsch, which was on the bad taps. I asked the guy at the beer bar for a suggestion and he said the beers are listed on the board. They were, but by name. When I asked what the Field Works beer was he sarcastically told me it was a sour.

The extensive frequent rotation of taps and selection is great for beer lovers and connoisseurs. The bartenders and staff are wonderful, friendly, and knowledgeable. And you couldn't ask for a better place to have available before a baseball game thanks to their private ballpark entrance and option to take in one of their great brews. The food menu for lunch, dinner, or snacks are also really well done.\n\nDespite this rave, I can't give it a full five stars because I've noticed during my few recent visits that the owners don't seem to be keeping the place up, which is a shame. Just today when we were in for lunch there was a noticeable lack of bar stools available, half of the bar (which is quite large and generally inviting) had practically no seating options! And a trip to the ladies room revealed a distressing lack of upkeep of the basics that one would expect to be provided with in an establishment of this kind. \n\nAs a local, a fan, and a regular, I hope to see these signs of decline quickly remedied. Not just because baseball season is right around the corner, but also because I just really enjoy heading here for the great beer and service.

It was like eating a deep fried cardboard, no bueno. And the sound of the sport event. A place that is a sport bar in the ATT park, you would expect better sound and tv to show an event like the super bowl, but it wasn't.

We decided to grab a beer or two before the game. Because it was the day of the 2-for-1 Virgin airline voucher, the place was packed with fans grabbing drinks before heading to wait in line. We were stuck sitting outside, in the, surprisingly, hot ass day in the bay. Shana, if I remember correctly, was our server. She was SUPER friendly!!! Loved her! Since my bf and I aren't big beer fans, we asked her what was good. She recommended the Victor ale (?). She said it was sour, but I couldn't taste the sourness. It was good! I got Sam Smith's Nut Brown. That one was okay. Not a beer person, so it tasted like regular beer. She also told us about their baby back ribs special. It came with coleslaw and corn bread for $18. My bf saw the people next to us who got that dish, and decided to get it to share. When the plate came, whoa! It totally didn't look like the plate next to us! It was small! The plate was big, but the meal itself was small.\n\nWhat I did like about the dish was that the meat fell right off the bone! The meat itself could have been better tasting. To me, it was on the bland side. There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on it. I like it saucy! The coleslaw was okay. Had more onions than I would have liked, but whatever. The cornbread was also on the eh side. Not sweet, not the right texture. I like it crispy on the edges and soft on the inside. It was just soft all over. To me, the meal wasn't worth the $18. We coulda went to Safeway and spent $10 on something bigger and tastier. Oh well.\n\nOverall, I guess my experience here was okay. Aside from the okay food and hot ass day, this place is cool to grab a few beers before the game. Shana was awesome! Super nice! She also recommended us this tattoo place where she got hers at. Might check that out too someday!", "author": "Kristen B."}

The food is not bad and a nice change from all the ballpark food we eat all the time, and the beer selection is ahhh-mazing... but you really want to come here before the game to grab a \"to-go\" drink!! That's right!! You can get two drinks \"to-go\" and bring them into the game. This is great because the prices for beer and cocktails at Public House are much better than the prices inside the ballpark.\n\nAs previously mentioned, the beer selection here is really really REALLLY good. They have your regular faves, but one of the bars has rotating taps that feature a lot of local micro-brew. The Flying Pig IPA seems a forever favourite and often runs out and they always seem to have one of my picks which is the Allagash White. I will say one time, I was tricked into getting a Coconut Curry Wheat, which was ok at first but later almost caused me to lose my lunch. (Curry beer should be banned!) The Bloody Mary is also very popular here, and I will say, it's one of the better ones that I have had.\n\nIf going here before a game, it is also important to note that during some of the more popular games and giveaways, Public House will either shut down access to the ballpark for 1-2 innings, or just be open and not have the giveaways.

However, it's safe to say I wasn't paying much attention to what I was eating (see below).  Considering we were a few rounds in, had been standing for hours (six hours total each night!), and were left to hold everything...I was just happy to eat something.\n\nAs far as being a sports bar though, Public House is pretty damn spiffy.

That, plus all of the people screaming, rooting, hollering, yelling, chanting, and cheering on the GIANTS made Public House a ridiculously awesome place to watch Games 3 and 4 of the 2012 World Series.

Which was quite good.\n\nOur meals arrived shortly after, presented delicious looking and generous in portion.\n\nI took off the top bread and mostly had a the Philly meat, though it was quite tasty and unique with the poplano peppers giving it a nice kick. It also was quite filling.\n\nMy bf also really enjoyed his club.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere is lively yet relaxing, the service was quite on par and friendly and the food was tasty and unique enough to have us wanting to come back.", "author": "Shannon H."}

We had pulled pork sliders, which was dry and not very good. Onion rings were oily and not crunchy; the batter was okay though. Service was fantastic. The servers and busers were very tentative and professional. We even complimented them to the floor manager when we left.They brought out all condiments for us for the sliders, which we didn't use b/c it was pulled pork. There was no sauce for the onion rings so we asked for ranch. They charged us for $1 for 2 little sides of ranch. Just a dollar...but should have been apart of the condiments. Weird that we were charged for ranch at a restaurant LOL. Margarrita was super sour. I had to ask for ice and added salt to fix it myself. Beer from San Marcos was good. There were a bunch of flat screens for sports games.", "author": "Lorie N."}

Admittedly, as much as I love sports, I'm not a huge sports bar dude simply because places like to jack up the prices during an event (c'mon, it's a regular season Lakers game and we're paying to park?) or claim themselves a sports bar with about two, 17-inch TVs in the whole joint (there aren't any OSHA regulations on calling yourself a sports bar?) or, quite frankly, think too highly of themselves because the place is crowded so the service is nonexistent (EVERY table is full sweetheart, I don't want to hear about your busy night; I just want some ketchup). \n\nIt was surprisingly not too crowded before the Giants and Dodgers got started and the nigh college football games began. My waitress, Whitney, came to my table nestled comfortably between two flat screens; one with michigan-notre dame and the other with usc and utah, so there wasn't much of a wait there. She recommended a very weak nor cal pale ale but I didn't fault her for this, for after she found out I was actually ordering food, she became a bit more helpful. Now, she took my credit card for a tab and I don't know if that's a game day thing or what but it was a weird to me. I wasn't at the bar...was at an actual table. \n\nOnward. \n\nOrdered the Masami Ranch Bibs in Cider Glaze with some sweet potato fries and shortly after, Whitney brings the condiments. They were all aligned in a carrier you might find in Kohl's or somewhere: ketchup, relish, mustard, etc...but I ordered ribs sweetheart, don't think I have much use for all of that. \n\nFood comes...ok...ribs are a little small as it was an appetizer dish BUT it was also 15 bucks. Make a decision Public House, this ain't Morton's or Ruth's Chris; $15 dollar appetizers are not allowed in an alleged sports bar. I had no silverware and it took Whitney waaaay too long to come see me after the food came considering that 1. the food just arrived so you need to make sure everything is all good there and 2. I had been finished with my ale for at least a few 3 and outs. \n\nNext up was the Ballast Point Barmy Ale out of San Diego and...they...were...out...of...it. Had to settle for the Bear IPA and it was alright just nothing to write Yelp about so I'll continue... \n\nI'm not a dessert eater no matter what my stomach circumference says but I had to get it in for my Yelpers sooooo I ordered the Ballpark Brownie. Someone put a picture of this thing on here and that's exactly what it looks like...cracker jacks and all. Again, a novelty dessert but the richness of the brownie and chocolate syrup all over it left a bit to be desired. When it came, I was spoonless and had to ask the lady, who was not Whitney, to bring me one. \n\nBeer 3 was Lagunitas Lil Sumpin Wild and I figured out I should have had that the previous two times. Whitney was a very nice person but quite obviously green when it came to her trade. The food was alright, the ambiance the same, the prices were over what they should have been and considering San Fran's 4% health tax on anything not leafy green, and despite its proximity to AT&T, even an awesome sports night couldn't make this a destination spot.", "author": "aaron w."}

I'll start by saying that I GET that they're crazy busy.  The place was packed when I was there @ 1 yesterday.  I didn't want to stay long needing to get in line for the game, so I placed a simple order - a Blue Moon beer and an order of fries with Ranch on the side.\n\nWhen my beer arrived it was in a small wine glass, not a pint glass like others at my table had been served their beers in. Huh?  And it was NOT a Blue Moon. It was some beer that tasted like clove!  Ick!   Of course by the time I realized this the waitress was long gone.  It was another 10 minutes before I saw her again.  I told her I didn't like the beer I was served and it was *not what I ordered.  She said, \"I told you we didn't have Blue Moon and I'd bring you something similar.\"  Ummm, no, you didn't, and usually if that's the case the waitstaff will ASK you what else you'd like, right?  I told her I needed to go and would just pass on the beer and she reminded me about my order of fries.  I said to just forget the fries and she looked at me as though I was canceling  a cooked to order filet mignon or something.  I said, fine, can I get them to go?  Yes.  What arrived was a small to-go box that was about 1/3 full of GARLIC FRIES.  There were so few fries that I could see the bottom of the box!  Ridiculous.  And I don't like Garlic Fries.  Fail #2!\n\nShe gave me my bill that was for $7.33 which included a charge of $.50 for watered down Ranch dressing.  Outrageous, but what was I going to do?  I gave her $10 and she gave me $2 in change... Ummm... where's the rest of my $$??  She said she didn't have coins.  Ok.... In this case shouldn't they err on the side of the customer??  She should have given me $3, right?\n\nI *might have given her a tip if she hadn't stiffed me $1.  I don't like it when people decide what i'm going to do with MY money!\n\nWe're talking about a beer and fries.  Probably the easiest thing anyone could order and she couldn't get any of it right and then decided that I didn't need the $.77 that should have been in my change.

Like some of the stuff written about Public House. People seem to be shocked at slow service when they're there on a game day, when the place is absolutely slammed - those same folks seem to have absolutely no issue with slow service, or having to wait for a table when they're at Burma Superstar or something. But no, a place that serves fish and chips should be able to magically produce it from the thin air, on demand.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnyways, I digress. \n\nI've been to the Public House... about a dozen times at this point. Usually before/after (and during) a game, since I'd rather enjoy reasonably priced, quality food as opposed to a gut busting hotdog and cold garlic fries. It's always packed, but it's worth the hassle. At the VERY least, their beer selection is outstanding. Two dozen beers - with two more on cask - and most of them outstanding selections with offerings from the likes of Stone, Avery, Ommegang, Allagash, Dogfish Head and more. Plus all your local faves from Anchor, Moylans, Bear Republic, and Marin Brewing. All sold at what you'd expect to pay at a regular bar, not ballpark prices. And there's the treat - head down between innings, and make your choice. A $6 Racer 5 (a full pint, too, as opposed to the 10oz pours in the stadium) or a $9 Bud Light. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFood at Public House is to be expected. Lots of sports bar type fare, a lot of which is designed to be \"to go\", for you to cart to your seat. Their gameday food to go is the only blot on Public House's copybook - I've had fish and chips to go, and when I got back to my seat found them to be somewhat bland, cold, and not very good. However, when I've had fish and chips at the restaurant, it's been outstanding. Gorgeous double fried chips, seasoned with sea salt and rosemary, and the fish was perfect. Don't get me started on their ribeye steak frites, their Saturday night special that had me almost licking my plate afterwards.\n\nSo there you are. Public House is a solid four star joint - five if they improved gameday food - as long as you go in there taking it for what it is.

Public house is a public  hot mess.\n\nWent there on Saturday night after the game- actually not after, probably was around the 7th inning  after we went to the giants dugout\n Intention was to go back to our club level seats but realized we were getting our asses served to us by Arizona so the public house's side entrance from the ballpark lured us in. We grabbed a table in seconds yet didn't see a server for 10 minutes. Well I saw them in the corner sharing pictures on there iphones and heard them in acronym type conversations but did not see one at our table.\n\n I was feeling dessert since I usually don't. I ordered something which the server had no idea it was even on the menu as she was only there for a week. I get it -she can't possibly try the whole menu in a week ... but a decent restaurant would not put a server on the floor who is that clueless not to at least fake it right if you can't make it right. She said, \" so like when you try it, like let me know, like haha.' Barf. \nYou don't really think she care how my butterscotch pudding tasted. Of course not, which is fine because I didn't really want to hear the word  'like' again.\nThis place clearly hires kids that's barely belong at red robin. No scratch that-  maybe more like a self serve frozen yogurt joint where all they have to do is collect money at the register because I'll tell you this- they're all visibly extremely lazy... much like most born post '87. Just sayin.\n\nMy friend ordered sweet potato fries, mini corn dogs & an ice cream sandwich.. all came at the exact same time, imagine that. The fries were like you would taste anywhere else. But the mini corn dogs - the nastiest batter and the grossest dry bite of overfried mess I think I ever tried. Negative 2 stars\n\n The 1 good thing I could say is that at least they use slocombe ice cream (which is a disservice actually to Humphrey)\n\n The acne face teenager literally dropped our food down and ran away appropriate title* food runner. When the server came over between giggles to ask how our stuff was, I mentioned we thought it was rude how he literally put the food all balancing on the corner of the table, she was very really immature how she handled it.  \"Oh like, he's like always like that.\" Lame. It felt like I was in a high school cafeteria.\n\n Prepare to see salads that cost more than entrees. Places like that offend my intelligence. \n Menu was really unimpressive though I'd hope they do a good burger & basic shit like that for people who are drinking too much & don't know the difference. I'm sure the beers and drinks obviously would be cheaper than the ballpark that's not saying much... there's a dozen bars within a block.\n\n Note to the owner and management : maybe your bartenders are great but your servers are hurting. Don't hold your breath on being supported by neither the neighborhood because they know better nor from Giants fans who know there's a plethora of options as well.\n Basic business 101* Single visit users don't always hold your doors open. unless you're the only joint in an airport which you are not, chumps.\n\nRemember what happened happened to Acme?", "author": "Athena S."}

First off, the beer selection is spectacular. They've had Pliny the Younger, Loads of Dogfish Head's brews, Stillwater, Greenflash, Lagunitas, Stone, Speakeasy, Lost Abbey, Ballast Point, Moylan's and more great beer than I can remember.  And remembering them all can be hard when I'm trying to sample everything they have to offer.\n\n  Now lets get down to the food. It's awesome!  This place had one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. You know that dream burger you always remember for years and even dream about some nights (I don't know about you guys, but if you don't dream about a good burger, then we may be starting off our relationship on the wrong foot) It's a fat burger, stacked with cheese, bacon, avocado (Thank you!!!), and all the usual fixins.  The cheese steak sandwich is a thing of beauty. It's everything you want a cheese steak to be; gooey, smokey, meaty and delicious. The Mac & Cheese? It was described to me as a bubbly cauldron of cheesy goodness and that is exactly what it was. I've even been so bold as to ask for them to even put bacon in it,  WOW is all I'm going to say.  \n\n  Now time to cover the service. I've had great service every time I've been here. Lets get down to it, the place gets packed before games, and it can be a challenge sometimes getting a table, but the management and staff have always been friendly and have helped to get me a seat. They are happy to explain what new beers they have on draft and even let me sample a few so I pick the perfect one, or if I've ever had questions on the menu they will gladly answer any questions I might have.\n\n  You've got to understand this is a ballpark and there are thousands of people who come through the place on game days. It's going to be busy, it's going to be crowded, but if you like being in the middle of the action and getting right into the stadium from the restaurant, with a great craft beer in your hand, then this is the place to go. \n\n  All in all, I love this place.

The down-side here is that it is often quite complicated to get drinks amidst the masses.  Seating is nearly impossible before games.  The food is so-so / not great.  The best upside is that a microbrew here is $6 whereas the prices increase to $9-$9.50 once you enter the stadium! So load up here, right?  One other previous secret of mine was that I used to enter here on stadium give-away days (bobble heads, etc), and use the internal entrance directly from the inside of the Public House into the stadium to avoid the massive lines (and get the give-aways).

The first night (Friday) it was A-OK. The second time we were there (Sunday afternoon) the place was horrible. Two stars it is. \n\nI don't get to Giants games as often as I should (I'm not a big fan of watching baseball live, but I am a fan of drinking beer and watching sports at the same time, so there you go), but it's a shame that such a prime location so close to the AT&T Park isn't any better than this place. \n\nNight #1 (Friday): We stroll in around 10. The place is busy, but it wasn't wall-to-wall packed or anything. Seven of us find a table pretty easily. Even though the beer menu is pretty extensive (which is a plus) I go with a Stella. Don't know what the other beer drinkers went with but the non-beer drinkers went with Raspberry Lemonades (alcoholic), which they said were good. One person was a little hungry & got the mac & cheese, which I tasted and was quite good.  The menu in general actually sounds good.  Pretty typical \"nicer\" sports bar food.  The service was pretty slow. Not insanely bad, but like I said, the place wasn't extremely crowded. \n\nDay #2 (Sunday): Was here for about a half hour, and never got served. There was nine of us and we were able to sit at a big table with others. NOBODY in our area was happy and I heard several people complaining about the service. The only reason we stayed as long as we did was because a few people ordered drinks at the bar when they got there and we were waiting for them to finish. \n\nWhen you're located right next to the ballpark it's a given you're gonna be busy on game days. This place just seemed to have a difficult time handling large crowds. I'm usually not insanely picky about service, but in this case I just can't buy an excuse for (extremely) slow service, because this place should pretty much expect to be busy...", "author": "George A."}

There's a bar with a huge selection of beer on tap. We ate in the dining area facing the open kitchen and tried the following:\n1. iron skirt steak - Hubby liked it a lot, I thought it was OK.  Tasted like any other steak to me.  Had beans with it. \n2. Onion rings - thin slices but I thought the batter was soggy at times.  Wouldn't order again. (should've read your review beforehand, Genevieve Y.!)\n3. Fries - came in a cone and were really good when hot, but at the bottom, got hard and crunchy.\n4. Wedge salad - very good and tasty, would order again. Came as a 1/2 of a small lettuce sliced into 2 wedges.\n5. Pork sliders - shredded pork in 3 tiny buns. Tasty if you're interested in lighter fares. \n6.  BFF had their potato soup. I had a taste, rather bland to me.\n\nDesserts - can skip this next time.\nEveryone had a scoop of their ice cream: peanut butter, Tahitian vanilla and salted choc (this one was the best for me). \nI tried the 'adult root beer float\".  The server comp this dessert for me because they didn't get the order right until she fixed it.  It's a small amt of beer poured over a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Kind of a rip off given the sm quantity, it's less than 1/2 the size of a root beer you'd get at any A&W.  It tasted odd until you mixed up the beer into the ice cream and turned it into a shake.  I wouldn't order it again and no one at the table liked it after a taste.\nOur server was really sweet and that water glass was constantly being filled. \n\nThis is probably going to be our to go place the next time we're in the AT&T park area for a Cirque du Soleil show again.", "author": "Ry T."}

Because honestly Public House, this is just getting silly.  Any time I come here before a game, I talk this place up and tell my friends how good the beer selection is, and how you can bring them into the park.  And every time, we wait in a 15 minute line at the FRONT of the bar, watching rude, understaffed bartenders pass us by again and again.\n\nLast night was the worst.  A group of girls near us had a very complicated order, and a female bartender was rude to the point of actually rolling her eyes and saying \"Really??\" in a sarcastic tone when they said they wanted one more drink.  The girls were understandably upset, since you know, they were being berated for ordering drinks at a freaking bar, and were talking poorly about the bartender after they received their order.  A man at the bar jokingly pointed to the girls, who were standing right behind us by this point, and said to the bartender, \"they don't like you too much\", at which point she got confused about who he was pointing too, turned to me and my girlfriend (who is all of 5'1\", for the record) and started getting in our face about \"well well then, what can I get for the people who don't like me?\"  We were so pissed at this rudeness (after waiting 15 minutes to order, mind you) that we just each took two beers to go in plastic cups...we had planned on staying, since there was an hour before the game, but were so turned off by how rude and slow all the bartenders were.\n\nI have never not been here right before a game, so no idea what the service is like otherwise, but honestly, if they are going to have the amount of bars they have, they really need to have more bartenders working before home games.  For how cheesy Pedro's Cantina can be, at least they can efficiently work a similarly huge crowd at a large bar.\n\n2 stars only because the beer list is fantastic and extensive, and by bringing in two beers each through the private entrance, it's silly not to get a better, bigger, and cheaper beer (or two) here first than to deal with overpriced domestics in the actual park.

They're everywhere, showing a wide variety of events, and of high quality! SF's relative weakness in the sports bar category is a factor too. For a city of this size and stature, we could use more good sports bars. \n\nThis is also a burger review since I'm reaching the last cohort of good dedicated burger places in SF. Specifically the Public House burger will not disappoint! It's served w bacon, cheddar and avocado (well guacomole on mine) plus fresh, crisp standard toppings. Four jars of condiments provided in advance of the plate itself. The patty was a good inch high and quite juicy. Perfect for flavoring fries in my personal steak frites fashion! They were whole-cut with skin on either en my favorite. Unfortunately they didn't taste as good as the burger because some thicker ones tasted as if they'd been fried frozen. \n\nRegardless I absolutely devoured the burger, less than 90 minutes after eating another entree, the chiliquenos plate. (That's a formal way of saying Frito pie.)\n\nThe service has never met the levels set by the food or beer however. I've never visited on the day of a Giants game, home or away, though this last visit (NFL playoffs) finally revealed the restaurant with most tables filled.\n\nOur server was quick to welcome my late self to the couple I'd invited there (yes, very rude of me) and he offered the menus plus his food recommendations. Once he came back for my order though, the mistakes began: forgot my water and then forgot my silverware and napkin twice. On that note the silverware and napkin never arrived ahead of the food during my two previous visits. Not even simultaneously. At least they're of high quality! Getting a towel instead of a napkin feels more appropriate for pub food, even of the high-end variety.\n\nSo go to Public House for a very good sports bar experience and high-end pub food.

I mention this because apparently it can be swamped on the weekend (what a surprise given their sports focus). I popped in on a Thursday night just before 1900 to meet with some friends. Only 1 or 2 tables left for the 6 of us. The big reason was that there was a SF beer week event in their large tabled area. A good 30 people enjoying tastings of a wide variety of beers. No matter, both our groups had a great time!\n\nThey have a good selection of various drafts and bottles and serve food as well. I was somewhat confused on what the actual beer menu was - there's beer and food listed on the place mats and a separate 2 page sheet listing a variety of beers. I probably would have preferred to order from the 2 pages (more choices), however the server noted that it was very likely out of date. Dang.\n\nThere were other groups, also meeting to discuss/do some afterwork business by the looks of it and the bars were pretty full for those just seeking an after-work drink. There are TV's on most walls, though given how spacious Public House is, some of them may be too far away for comfortable viewing.\n\nThe downside is really their location - you have to work in the area or be willing to MUNI in (it took me 40 minutes from Rockridge BART + N Line to get there during rush hour though so not a big deal. N line or 30 bus comes relatively frequently to get you back up to BART as your schedule dictates).", "author": "Kevin M."}

Oh, yeah...and I think there's some soccer thing going on, too.\n\nThis place and a small taqueria are apparently owned by the same guy, and they're almost indistinguishable from each other. What appeared to be the spot where the host would normally stand, had nobody there. Huh. So we wander in. Lots of tables available. So we grab one.\n\nWaiters wander by. Attempts to get their attention fail. \"Excuse me....hello....hi, could you tell me...\"  No dice. These guys were like zombies, far more interested in the TV screens than in the customers. When one of us finally gets up and stands directly in front of a waiter, the waiter finally says something about food not being served until 4 PM.\n\nThe napkins and salt & pepper shakers on each table are apparently just decor during lunchtime.\n\n3 other groups of people are in the same boat that we are, and are having just as much luck getting staff attention as us. OK, so it's not my clothes that are the problem.\n\nSo we get up, and wander into the taqueria. We see another guy standing behind one of the counters, but he's doing the same turkey-in-the-rain thing that all the other staff were doing. \"Hi....do you have any menus?\"\n\nSo he hands us each a slip of paper. The items on this \"menu\" qualify at best as appetizers, not as any sort of a meal. After being ignored when we walked in, spending about 10 minutes to get the attention of a waiter only to find that we're in a food-free zone, and now a non-menu from which to select lunch....that's it. Let's just go some place else.\n\nAnd for the kicker, as we walk out the door, I've still got my \"menu\" in my hand. I don't want it and not knowing where else to put it, I set it on a counter near the door, and I hear a staff member behind me say, \"excuse me...those don't belong there.\" In the tone of voice you might use with a 5-year-old. \n\nOh, you did NOT just say that.\n\n\"Excuse me?\", I ask, not believing what my ears just told me. And steam's shooting out of them by this point.\n\n\"They belong over there,\" he says, pointing to a stack of them on a different counter. He's a bit nicer this time: he sounds like he's talking to a 6-year-old. Maybe even 6 and a half.\n\nWell, I certainly want to make him happy. \"Oh, okay\" I say with a gentle smile. I crumple it up, and chuck it in the trash can.\n\nI know it's the World Cup, and yes: this is a sports bar. It's probably a good thing to hire staff who at least appreciate athletics. But newsflash, kids: you are there to WORK. *I* am the customer, not you. \n\nDo your god damn jobs first, and watch the game second.\n\nTo summarize the low points:\n\n- Not having greeters at the door?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-05-14", "description": "I learned about the opening of Public House during the Giants Fanfest in February.  Even though I was one of the few people who actually liked ACME Chophouse, I would agree that ACME was perhaps the wrong choice for a ballpark restaurant.  As a Giants season ticketholder, I was really looking forward to something new, and I was excited about the limitless possibilities Public House.  \n\nI've been here 3 times now (once before a preseason game, once during a lengthy rain delay and once before a regular season game) and I am still waiting for Public House to impress me.  I am sure they are still working out the kinks, but do they really have to do it at the expense of their customers?\n\nThe restaurant undoubtedly has potential.  The flat screens on the walls are tuned to various sports channels, although I've had a very hard time trying to track someone down to change the channel to something actually worth watching.  \"What Yankees game?  Is it on right NOW?\"  I was asked during TBS Sunday Morning game.  I thought you guys were running a sports bar...\n\nOn our first visit my friend and I noticed that the restaurant was grossly overstaffed.  The waitstaff were literally standing around, waiting to snatch a plate off the table.  Not only did I feel rushed, but I was afraid they were going to rip my arm off.  Well, not really.  On my subsequent visits, I noticed that they were grossly understaffed.  We had a hard time getting anyone's attention.  So much for \"just enough,\" eh?\n\nI also fail to understand their positioning.  If they want people to think of this place as an upscale organic eatery with a bar, why do the waiters have a sassy, almost rude, attitude like one would expect at a bar?  The \"bouncer\" and then the waiter almost yelled at us for bringing a Starbucks coffee cup to the restaurant.  Umm, do you think I am not going to order anything else?  You need to relax and respect your customers.\n\nAs far as the food goes, everything here is really, really small.  An order of sliders isn't big enough to share, and neither is an order of deviled eggs.  Actually, the salads are decent sized, so you could probably split those with your partner in crime.\n\nThe sandwiches and hotdogs here are much smaller than what you pay for, but at least they taste better than the crap you'll get inside.  The cheesesteak is delicious and not overly greasy.  All their sandwiches have a unique, \"designer\" look and taste, so there's that.  I love the Secret Breakfast ice cream they serve, which seems like a steal at $2.  Yes, you guessed it, it's small, too, but it's all the ice cream I can handle.\n\nI think Public House has a lot of potential.  If they try to control the crowds, it would be a fantastic spot to watch sporting events while waiting for the Giants game to start.  I am sick and tired of going to Zeke's, and I was ready for something better.  Public House could be that.  They just need to turn some of the tables towards the TVs on the walls and maybe throw in an extra slider every once in a while.  If you are forced to pay $8 for two bite size burgers, you might as well be \"surprised\" by a third one on the house.  Just sayin'.", "author": "Yan G."}

I turn and look over my shoulder towards the ball park and am an even happier woman knowing that I can waltz through an entrance to the game in the restaurant itself, cheaper beverage in hand. \n\nAt a closer look, though, there are some cracks in this Public House. The nachos were fancy but skimpy. The pretty pink cocktail didn't taste entirely pretty and the brewskie (watermellon wheat) was probably not the best choice. At a more obvious glance you could see our server and the store manager laboriously attempt to run our card while their credit device was broken which took much longer than we would have liked.\n\nAll-in-all, this is a great spot to start out the drinking festivities before you hit the park. The drinks are cheaper (at least by a little bit) than if you were to buy them in the park and the food is good. \n\nP.S.

This place was packed and there was barely any walking room. Goodluck trying to get service if you didnt come super early. I ended going to the grab and go bar near the side entrance to the stadium (I suggest you go through this way to cut through the line at the main entrance). Service was quick and there was no line. Beers will run about $7 for a 16oz and a couple more for the 22oz, not many good options though. Plenty of televisions showing multiple games with a decent amount of seating. If not here, then you can stroll over the Mijita, but I doubt there'll be any over there. I think the seating is pretty much take what's open, so it's always a mad dash like musical chairs. There's a outside patio which additional seating and more standing room if you are desperate. Try to avoid if possible on home games.", "author": "Phan H."}

My family and I went to get our picture taken with the World Series trophy (GO GIANTS!) and since I'd been wanting to check this place out for quite some time, we'd figured it'd be a great opportunity to stop in for dinner after the photo sesh. Sure enough we came along and sat at one of the many empty tables- front and center, close to the bar. It was a Wednesday night and pretty slow. Not ONCE were we greeted by any of the wait staff, or offered menus, drinks...nothing. \n\nI noticed that none of the staff ever cracked a smile so it got me to thinking that maybe the worker morale at the restaurant is really low- or maybe I just caught everyone on their off day? Obviously nobody was motivated to greet us or take our order, and we made it pretty clear that we were settled in and waiting to be helped. I'm a really patient person but once the 25 minute marker hit and we still hadn't been greeted, we eventually packed up and went to MoMo's. I'm super bummed because I didn't get to try any of the food or beer :(\n\nI don't mean to judge this place so harshly on one really bad experience, but I think it'll take a while for me to want to go back there.

Service was efficient, friendly, and attentive without being overwhelming. I can't recall the last time I experienced such amazing service. The service alone would bring me back to this restaurant. \n\nThe food... Oh the food... I would give it MAYBE 3 stars. That's a very strong maybe...\n\nMy friend ordered the beer steamed mussels with sour ale, fennel and grilled bread. Sadly it smelled better than it tasted. The broth, if you can call it that, tasted like watered down soup. There was absolutely no flavor in the broth, which is a shame because when you order mussels, the best part is sopping up the broth with the bread! Also, my friend felt like she could fend off vampires with the amount of garlic she ate in her dish. \n\nI had the grilled chicken breast, avocado, bacon and blue cheese sandwich. They should say the sandwich comes with arugula as well since some people aren't fans of that green. I actually loved the combination. The flavors blended very well together. I do wish there wasn't so much bread (I'm guessing a ciabatta roll...) and the chicken breast was a bit thicker (although it was incredibly flavorful). The description on the menu should say the sandwich comes with chips, which were a bit on the greasy side. \n\nWe also ordered french fries that were unevenly salted. They're standard fries so not much else to comment on. \n\nI was surprised we were able to come in and grab a seat given it was 5:30 with the Giants playing in town, but shows that it's possible to grab a bite before the game! I liked how quick the kitchen worked - shows they know their customers and try to get them in and out the door for game time. \n\nOverall, for the price you pay, the food you receive, and the service you get, it's a pretty good option for a pregame meal. However, I probably wouldn't go here if I wasn't attending a game.", "author": "Kim C."}

Even if you order the most expensive items from those category, the most the tab can add up to is $64. The total of the food we ordered, using the above criteria came to $56, but they deducted $55 as the value of certificate. It wouldn't have been worth the time and breath to argue over a $1 if not for the fact that the steak entr\u00e9e we got came with 2 lbs of french fries and 3 oz of steak. Price? $20. I appreciate heeding health professionals' advice to limit consumption of protein to 3 oz, but how do the french fries factor into that healthy equation? OK, so the food is overpriced. And why not, there's a built in clientele from the Giants games. But to add insult to injury, on my way to the bathroom, I spotted some gent's dinner of the same steak entr\u00e9e and his had at least 1.5 times the amount of steak as what we got. When I questioned the waiter, who was mostly nonexistent and inattentive when he did come around, on the discrepancy in what we got vs. the gent a few tables over, he replied that the serving sizes didn't vary depending on whether a discount was used. I was sure that was going to be the answer, but needed to put them on notice that it was obvious.\n\nAnd the beer we ordered, which was listed as 16oz on the menu, came in a 16oz glass, with a 1 inch head, and 1 inch clearance from the top of the glass.

But with the opening of Public House, coinciding with the start of the 2010 season, fans finally have a go-to player at 24 Willie Mays Plaza.\nOne reason the previous tenant, Acme Chophouse, didn't make the cut was that its game plan was tilted toward \"fine\" (whatever that means) sit-down dining. That too-formal strategy was at odds with the casual atmosphere fans expect before a baseball game. Redesigned inside and out, Public House seems to have corrected the stodgy atmosphere and the restaurant/pub now feels more casual, airy and welcoming.\nThe entrance to the room is dominated by two large bars that face one another. The bar on the left is mostly for mixed drinks and wine while the bar on the right is primarily for beer (the empty beer kegs are a dead giveaway). You can order anything from either bar. However, the two bars form a sort of funnel as you proceed deeper into the room, creating a potential bottleneck for bartenders and wait staff scurrying back and forth (staff refers to it as the \"kill zone\"). It will be interesting to see what creative steps Public House takes to avoid congestion. Beyond the bar are some tables, a large, open kitchen and the turnstile entrance to AT&T Park. There are also tables in front of the bar in a patio that is designed to be warmed by heaters below the sidewalk rather than space heaters.\nThe menu features beer-friendly appetizers and pub food like fish and chips, a BLT, a variety of hotdogs and sausages, sliders, a burger and salads. Considering the location and the quality, prices are not outrageous. Unlike in Philly, you will not find Velveeta on Thom's Cheesesteak Sandwich ($12). Instead, there's a nice pile of tender, juicy beef, grilled onions and sweet peppers encased in a soft, fresh roll. Although the sandwich is not huge, it's very tasty and big enough to share as an appetizer. The Mac-n-Cheese appetizer ($5), a holdover from Acme Chophouse, is not to be missed. It arrives piping hot, with melted yellow cheese atop soft, creamy elbow noodles. Matched with an Allagash White or an Ommegang Pale Ale, the cheesesteak and mac 'n cheese combo is almost as satisfying as a Brian Wilson strikeout to close out a game. Just like with your beer or alcoholic beverage of choice, you can take the food inside the park with you.\nDave McLean, owner of the Magnolia Gastropub and Brewery and The Alembic in the Haight, was on hand to help inaugurate the new baseball season and the new pub with a special beer brewed just for Public House. McLean called his cask-conditioned English ale \"Billy Sunday Bitter,\" which combines the name of an 19th century baseball player turned evangelist with a Grateful Dead lyric from Ramble on Rose* (if you spend more than 10 minutes at Magnolia, you're bound to hear some Dead). Billy Sunday the ale is the kind of beer you might have in a cask in England: naturally carbonated and served at cellar temperature (rather than refrigerator cold) so that you can appreciate all the nuances of the beer. It seemed somewhat hoppy for an English style bitter but was delicious nonetheless.\nHaving Dave McLean and Magnolia onboard, along with beer from several local breweries, helps establish Public House as part of the San Francisco beer scene and might even make China Basin a beer destination beyond the estimable 21st Amendment a couple of blocks away.\nThe Giants seem finally to have a lineup of decent hitters and one of the best pitching staffs in baseball, playing in one of the most beautiful parks in the country. And for the first time since the park opened in 2000, long-suffering Giants fans have a pub worthy of a pennant contender. Who knows? Maybe this really will be their year after all.\n\nPublic House\n24 Willie Mays Plaza\nSan Francisco, CA 94107\n415.644.0240\n\nNo reservations\n\n\n\n*Ramble on Rose\n(Words by Robert Hunter; music by Jerry Garcia)\n\nJust like Jack the Ripper\nJust like Mojo Hand\nJust like Billy Sunday\nIn a shotgun ragtime band\nJust like New York City,\nJust like Jericho\nPace the halls and climb the walls\nGet out when they blow", "author": "chuck l."}

Food was good and simple - yes overpriced but compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood, this on the affordable side. We ordered the burger and a dog. Both were satisfying. The chopped salad was my favorite. Maybe that's because I love a lot of different veggies in my salad - but there was also chicken and bacon in it! \nOne weird thing about this place is that they carded you at the door. I don't see how it's a very good idea to only cater to the 21+ crowd.

Our interactions inside we're brief, but I will admit the bartender was friendly and polite delivering our order quickly. \n\nNeedless to say by the amount of stars, we were extremely disappointed. We ordered the chipotle wings and the cheesesteak sandwich, both of which had some egregious mistakes as far as food should taste. The wings were extremely one note in flavor. I could see the pepper seasoning and the chipotle sauce/ glaze on the wings, but from a restaurant of chef Tracy des Jardins one should be able to expect much better and the flavor was simple and lacking in depth. My second biggest concern was on the cheesesteak sandwich. The meat to bread ration was appalling; when I examined my half of the sandwich the meat was not even covering a full layer of the bread. Clearly the portioning is aimed at drunken baseball fans who could care less. The sandwich came with chips of the kettle cooked variety? They seemed soggy but that may have been due to the transportation time to our seats, either way not good value for money.\n\nSome positives: the roll for the cheesesteak was delicious, I believe it was a ciabatta roll, but the menu seems to be offline today? The dipping sauce with the wings was clearly homemade and satisfactory.\n\nMy advice is to avoid this place if your intention is to eat a delicious meal in a well known and Top Chef Masters contestants' restaurant as the quality has lowered severely and the prices must have increased($15 dollar cheesesteak!)", "author": "Grant C."}

Place is usually never busy.\n\nStaff: Very friendly and attentive.\n\nDecor: Cool, clean, brewery type feel. Good sized space\n\nFood: Pretty good. We split deviled eggs, mac and cheese, onion rings, and the burger with avocado on it. Deviled eggs were pretty spicey, I probably wouldn't order those again, but everything else was good. \n\nDrinks: This place seems more geared towards the beer drinkers as they have a big selection of beers. I ordered an alcoholic pink lemonade and it was so strong that I had to add water to it. I think I'd get a beer next time.\n\nThis place is definitely worth a try, especially if you live close by like I do.

I've always been leary of this location in the past, anticipating high prices for food and drinks. Sure enough, they have high prices for food and drinks. But, they have a great selection of beers on tap and easy access to the stadium thru the bar. Best of all, you can take a GO-CUP of your drink of choice into the park.\nI had a lamb meatball sandwich. The meatballs were very tasty served with a garlic-yogurt sauce. But, there were only two small meatballs served on a hot dog bun, no sides or chips.. At $10, I would have liked to see, at least, more meat and better bread.\nService was pretty fast considering the pre-game rush.

To clarify, my beef with the place isn't so much that it's slow, I know it's gonna be slow when there's a million people inside. Duh. It's the open seating+the lack of organization amongst the servers, they just kept missing our whole section standing int he middle of the dining room at the circular standup table. \n\nSO, when there's a light crowd it's great. One of the best beer lists in the city bar none, minus the attitude (cough cough Toronado cough) and they take credit cards, as any 21st century business should. Humphrey Slocombe ice cream for dessert doesn't hurt either. The food is good.

I had eaten at Amici's last week and didn't want a repeat, but it took a lot of work to find a place to eat. I looked over the menu and I think it has changed since I was last there or I just don't remember. I looked over the menu and the waiter was very good at explaining if we had any allergies that we could have things changed out. I wanted fish and chips, but didn't want the chips because I wasn't sure if they would be fat fries or skinny fried. I asked the waiter to substitute the fries for onion rings. Not a problem. \n\nMy friend had ordered a sandwich and fried. When the meal arrived I was shocked. I thought the sandwich was a bit small, but the fries looked like the ones from In-N-Out, but just slightly bigger and with the potato skin. The fish and chips were good. There were two pieces of big fish, but not too big and one half the size of the big ones. The onion rings weren't battered a lot so it sort of look like a light tempura-ish coating.\n\nThe fish was battered fresh and not frozen and it was good. The onion rings were good except the chef put salt on them. I thought they were a bit salty. The fries were good too, but they had a bit too much salt on them. \n\nOverall pretty good. I just wish the chef would leave the salt off and let us salt it our self to our liking. I'd come back. I wasn't too hungry, but it was filling. My friend had a sandwich (don't remember which) and he said it was filling in the end. \n\nIt was good and the tv's were full of sports and a good even amount of baseball, hockey, and basketball.

Actually after a few trips here, I kind of want to come here even more when the Giants are away.  One of my favorite places to go in Chicago near Wrigley Field, was the Goose Island Brew Pub.  Like that great institution, Public House offers tons of TVs with nearly every game on.  Of course the main event is the nice list of rotating taps they have.  Rely on the chalkboards, tap handles or just the bartender (more than the menus) to keep up on what is delicious and new on tap.  During my most recent trip I enjoyed the Bruery's Saison which is practically perfect for a sunny day and finished off a delicious Old Rasputin on nitro before heading into the ballgame.  The Grab n Go stand is a great way to save at least a couple bucks on a good beer before heading into the $9.25 void of beer that has become AT&T park.\n\nOf course during the Giants game this place is a complete madhouse and milling through the crowd or even getting a beer can be a clusterf$%&  (head to Pete's Tavern if you want less people but also a less interesting beer selection) but given that it's a spiffy TV-laden place serving tasty suds, I've thus far endured the hoards to enjoy quality pre-game beers.", "author": "Steven R."}

Usually people come here pre-game for a drink that by the time it starts most have left and you get a seat at the bar.  There are numerous televisions all playing the giants game.  There are a few different bars, but be careful because some serve some drinks and not others and that can get annoying.  But my motto is, how about I am not annoying and just order whatever the bar has I happen to be sitting at...because really you are here for the game.  Which is a good thing, because the food is terrible.  I've only ordered a few different appetizers and I could almost not get them down.  So salty.  If anything I'd get the pretzle bites and fill up on beer during the game and food somewhere else after.

I was a bit annoyed that even though our friend was inside with a table, they still made us wait in line outside which didn't make a lot of sense.  \n\nWe ordered the Chicken Sandwich, Philly Cheesesteak, Beef Sliders, Chopped Salad, Nachos, and Kracker Jax.  The Cheese steak for $10 or $12 was delicious according to my friend.  For $9, you can also get one inside the ball park which is oily and very little meat which makes this sandwich a great deal.  I had the chicken sandwich and it had fig compote and when blended with the chicken which was salty, it was a perfect combination of salty and sweet.  You could taste the different flavors it offered.  The beef sliders, I only had one, was also very delicious; juicy, tender, hot, well made.  The nachos, salad, and the kracker jax were very disappointing.  The latter stuck to your teeth before you can chew it, the salad was over priced and small, and the nachos while not too expensive just was too small and perhaps a bit innovative for ball park food.  On the bottom was a large chip or crunchy pita bread and on top of it were nachos.  I most likely wouldn't get the latter three.  \n\nOur waiter was a nice and friendly guy but either he had too many tables to manage or he was off doing something because it was often hard to find him.\n\nFor the price of food and beer, this place offers a good value when compared to the food inside the park.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-04-10", "description": "This place has promise, but also a few key drawbacks. Let's start with the minuses, shall we?\n\nFirst, it's overpriced for what it is.... and while I guess that's expected for being IN the ballpark technically, if you pay $13 for a burger or sandwich, it ought to come with fries or a salad. Even a mentally challenged 8 year old could tell you that. I get that you can overcharge the tourists that invade SOMA every game night. But how about a neighborhood special? Free fries on non-game nights with your meal? Half off apps or beers? Throw us a frickin bone here!!!\n\nSecond, and here's a major public health concern, as well as a giant waste of effort by servers/staff- don't set out open containers of ketchup, mustard, and other things and then leave them at tables for anyone to dip in, spit or sneeze on, or otherwise violate. Just leave the frickin bottles. That's pretty much common sense and is kind of disgusting. Next time I'm asking for the bottle, especially if it's after a game. It may seem petty to some, but trust me, people are going to get sick from this.\n\nNow the pros: I really like the space- it's cool, it's hip, it's got a ton of TVs in one area if that's what you want, as well as some outdoor space and ample bar area with high ceilings and a comfortable vibe. Also, while the menu wasn't as varied as I thought it could have been (salads? veggie sandwich option? fancy soft pretzels?), the food was pretty good and I thought for the people they are catering to the menu items are appropriate. The food isn't greasy but it's not health food either- it's what you'd expect the ballgame crowd would be looking for- homey American comfort food, plus a few extras. I had the falafel platter which I enjoyed- soft fresh falafel with good seasoning, and an awesome cucumber sauce- salad and pita could have been better. (Not a TON of veggie options, but it'll do). They just need to make the servings of fries bigger already- the large was like the size of my hand. Why so stingy? \n\nOverall, this place is a good option on a non-game night  (otherwise it will probably be obnoxiously packed) if you don't mind paying a little extra. Good addition to the neighborhood- that is, if they consider my requests!! :-)", "author": "Kristen L."}

I went here to watch game one of the NL playoffs on a Saturday.  I arrived about 15 minutes before the game started and the bar was full but not totally packed (during the Series games it was at capacity with a line to get in).  It took about ten minutes to get drinks at the bar but that is to be expected when a bar is that full.  And really, that's what we went for--to watch the game in a crowd full of Giants fans!\n\nThere is a lot of standing room and counter space so you can set food or drinks down while you stand and watch the game.  I was particularly impressed with the fact that the waitress took food and drink orders from the standing room only area.  Maybe this is par for the course at sports bars (I am new to the sports bar scene)?  I've never seen that at a bar before, and thought it was fantastic that we didn't have to leave our spot and wait at the bar to get more beers.  The waitress was also courteous and efficient, an impressive feat given how crowded the bar was.  \n\nBecause of the crowd we had trouble finding a place next to a counter or table.  But when we did order food we negotiated with some friendly folks near us who were next to counter space to put our food down in our area.  Friendly fellow patrons are always a plus.  We had the nachos and they were yummy.\n\nI had a great time there and will go back again for Giants games.  The crowd is friendly, the space is big, and they have a great bar menu.  Oh, and I suppose I should also mention the TV situation.  AMAZING.  There are panels of TVs on every wall, so no matter what direction I looked I could watch the game on at least two monitors.

They charged $7 for Guinness draft (no so bad in inflated ballpark land), but then had the gall to add 10% sales tax and another 4% Healthy SF tax so the total cost of the beer was $8.\nI religiously avoid any place that adds Healthy SF fees and the practice of adding sales tax on top of the beer price for a beer ordered at the bar is bush league and sets a bad precedent for other bars to follow. I get gouged enough for beer inside AT&T, I'm not going to volunteer to get gouged before I even get inside. I'll do my best to avoid this place in the future and pick another meeting spot before games.", "author": "bud e."}

I love tasting small batch brews from Idaho to San Diego. The Mijita nachos are amazing and you can order them in Public House. The burger is solid and my girl enjoyed the Greek salad. Definitely coming back for another Sunday Funday!", "author": "Peter L."}

Granted it wasn't busy as the Giants were in town, but I would definitely come here again. The service was outstanding (a big plus for me), the cocktails strong and the food pretty good for a sports bar. Loved having SO many TV's to watch sports and they gladly put on the Sharks game for us on the nearest big screen. 2 thumbs up!", "author": "Habsfan B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-09-19", "description": "i am so psyched that this place exists.  usually when you got to a giants game, you get crappy bud lights for 9$ a pop.  it is so cool that instead you can go to Public House and get some really good beers for about the same price.  the selection is great, and they let you bring everything into the game.  you can even get your hand stamped so you can go back in during the game and get more beers.  i would have given it 5 stars, but the service was really slow (despite not being busy) and not super friendly.", "author": "vlad k."}

Otherwise, everything else was awful-appetizers which, though ordered first, came after the entrees; a chicken sandwich (very dry) with iceberg lettuce, not the advertised arugula, brats 1/2 the size of the buns, cold French fries, bad service...at one point our waiter asked us if we still wanted our food...I wish we had said \"no\" and had left.  A huge disappointment and a total waste of money. I love the Giants in spite of their neighbors . I only wonder how they could have screwed up the beer...", "author": "David B."}

Food (when it's prepared correctly) is pretty good but I have now had three service issues. Either food not being cooked correctly or taking forever to arrive. To the credit of the managers they have all been very nice and accommodating but PH just needs to get the service and process fixed before I can up the rating.", "author": "Greg M."}

We got the special - fried chicken - and it was served at room temperature. It probably was cooked hours earlier and served from indoor heat lamps. Traci des Jardins should be ashamed of the food coming out of this place. Sad....just really sad.", "author": "traci n."}
