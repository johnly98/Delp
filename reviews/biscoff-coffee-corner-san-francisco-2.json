It was in the high 80s where we live so it was nice to come out of the tunnel to much cooler weather.\n\nWe strolled all over the wharf, had dinner at Boudins and watched the ships come in and out.  It was such a nice time but it was cold!!\n\nI have been visiting the pier for about 20 years, we live close enough to make many visits a year.  In all that time I have never bought coffee here.  We were all freezing and I was about to take my friends over the Golden Gate Bridge to Vista Point where it is almost arctic some nights.  So I stopped in and ordered coffee & mochas for all of us.  We didn't have to wait too long for our coffee, it was hot and delicious.  They include a little cookie with each coffee order.  I wasn't really interested in eating it because it was so small and didn't really call to me.  However, I decided to try it and ended wishing that I had about 20 more of them.\n\nMy friends and I really enjoyed the coffee and the cookies which kept us warm and fed on the other side of the bridge.", "author": "Robyn J."}

Located at Pier 39, it's hard to miss this little shop filled to the brim with snacks and of course, coffee.\n\nNo seating at this shop but that's not the goal here.  Really it's a get your sugar, caffeine and go.  They give you a free cookie (very small cookie) with every cup too.\n\nI got their small cup of coffee ($2.25), which wasn't bad but also nothing special.  The desserts almost got a purchase out of me because they looked great, but I passed this trip.\n\nStaff were friendly, fast, and I enjoyed myself here.

The guy making the drinks tonight was sooooooo rude! And our drinks tasted horrible. We got there close to closing time so they were rushing to make things but still  doesn't warrant attitude. I ordered a medium decaf latte and after waiting for awhile, the guy pushes a drink to the window and called my number. I checked my receipt and confirmed I ordered medium so I told him so. He then dumps the small drink in a medium drink and pours more milk in it then left. A girl comes by so I asked if she can check that it's decaf. She goes to the guy and asks and he responds to her in another language then puts the drink infront of me without making eye contact or answering me so I asked again and he said yes with his back to me and left. Totally didn't give me any confidence inis answer and when I tasted my drink, all I tasted was milk. Where's my coffee? My husband got the peppermint hog chocolate but didn't try it before we left the shop. By the time he tasted it as we were walking, he couldn't even drink it. It was so sweet like they dumped half a cup of syrup into it. Very disappointing experience to say the least", "author": "Rainie L."}

I ordered mine half the sweetness with soy milk, and my best friend added white chocolate syrup to hers. \n\nWe ordered together, and she received her drink. And a LOT of other people received there's. After about 5 minutes, I asked the girl. She requested to see my receipt stating she didn't get a ticket, no problem... I had the receipt. \n\nSo she makes about 5 more drinks prior to making mine. Then when I receive it, it's cold. I asked her if she could just throw it in a microwave or something and she apologized stating she forgot to steam the milk. She remakes the drink.... and really, I had to throw it away. Which for me to throw away coffee.... it was syrupy thick, like the consistency of pancake syrup and was disgustingly sweet.

I greatly appreciate him reaching out and trying to make things right, it shows that they do indeed have great customer service aside from that one employee. \n\n\nJust experienced the rudest service ever. Ordered just a regular coffee, which the customer gets themselves out in the lobby. They were out of two of the different roasts and almost out of the third regular, all that would've been left is decaf. \nWhen we let the barista know (dark messy hair, wearing glasses), she gave us a huge eye roll before replying a quick \"okay\" and going about her buisness. \nThey were also out of cream in the container, and had the quart out from the fridge sitting on the counter. I grabbed it to use it and the San barista got mad and snatched it away from me. Maybe you should keep all your items filled? Don't take your bad day out on me.", "author": "Sarah W."}

Today was different.   Biscoff now makes a fresh Belgian \"street waffle\". \n\nWhat makes this waffle so special?\nFirst, it is made from a dough, not a batter, so it is a bit denser than a thick and fluffy waffle that I was used to.  Also, there is pearled sugar in the dough which brings this wonderful sweetness not only to the outside, but to the inside as well.   I was comparing this to the waffle I got at another coffee place along the Embarcadero.  \n\nThe fact is, there is really no comparison.  This waffle is the perfect portion size, wrapped with a serving tissue and a couple of napkins.  It is sweet, mildly sticky, the right amount of crispness and makes a great treat for any beverage that is sold at Biscoff.", "author": "Scott A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-18", "description": "A few years ago, during a trip to San Francisco, I left my hotel in the morning and came back in the afternoon to find my room neatly cleaned. Placed on the pillow of my bed was an individually wrapped Lotus Biscoff cookie. For the most part, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. But, upon closer inspection, it was one of the best cookies I've had in my life.\n\nLabeled as \"Europe's Favorite Cookie With Coffee,\" it has a crunchy texture, with a unique caramelized flavor. More commonly known as Lotus Speculoos (a Belgian specialty), they are a type of shortcrust biscuit. They became really popular in the US during the 1980's, when they were served as treats on domestic airline flights. \n\nThe unique taste stems from the sugar's caramelization during the baking process, along with a hint of cinnamon and other spices. Biscoff Cookies are made with no artifical colors or preservatives, 0 grams of trans fat and cholesterol per serving, non-GMO ingredients, no nuts, and no animal by-products.\n\nI guess in San Fran, you can find almost anything, so I was shocked to find a Biscoff Cookie Corner on Pier 39, near Fisherman's Wharf. On a cold day, it'll be worth your time to purchase a cup of coffee, since each one comes with a FREE cookie. The store has other things too - Krispy Kreme doughnuts, smoothies, pastries, cakes, soda, water, juices, espressos, and other specialty drinks.\n\nI swear that the Biscoff Cookies pairs well with any warm beverage. My family thoroughly enjoys them in the morning, especially my little nephew. If I leave any at the house, he'll find it and will try to devour them all. Kids - I tell ya. \n\nIT WAS ME, I ATE THE LAST COOKIE\nThe Lotus Biscoff cookie also has a version with a layer of chocolate. If you're into spreads, they sell a creamy and crunchy spread too - perfect for toast. Here's their website for some online shopping. (http://www.shopbiscoff.com) If you're still not convinced, check out your local Cost Plus World Market. That's where I go to recharge when I'm dry.", "author": "Chris C."}

We both knew this place was a tourist trap but badly needed an influx of caffeine.\n\nI ordered a Mexican mocha and my sister ordered a Redeye (drip coffee with an extra shot of espresso). The ordering process was fair enough and we were told to go to the window to pick up our order when it was ready. This is where the problems began.\n\nApparently drip coffee is self serve there and the people making the coffees did not get the memo regarding my sister's Redeye. A man behind the counter brings my Mexican mocha but no Redeye for my sister. I try to get his attention to let him know that we are missing something from our order and he flat out ignores me. My sister tries to flag him down as he is walking around back and he flat out ignores her as well.\n\nI am kind of puzzled at this point. Is he deaf? Should we try sign language?\n\nFinally, as he calls out another order number and walks back to the window my sister is able to tell him that she is missing her coffee. In a very annoyed tone he says, 'You're order XXX right? You got your coffees'. When my sister tried to argue, he holds out his hand and demands to see our receipt.\n\n2 seconds after scanning the receipt he calls out to one of the employees to make a Redeye. No apologies, no nothing.

They have packages that have the cookies individual wrapped and even have some that are covered in chocolate! Talk about WIN!\n\nThey often have promotions with their items so be on the look out! One time they had a buy one get one free on their super addicting spread while another time if you spend a certain amount, you got an item for free. If you look on your parking ticket or if you get the Fun Pass from the Visitor's Center, there's a buy one get one 50% off a drink as well.\n\nTheir spread tastes just like speculoos spread and come in creamy or crunchy (which I always grab the crunchy one). Put it on your toast, waffle, eat it with a banana.. you just gotta try it!\n\nThe caffeine level of their coffee feels like a medium to me but they do taste delicious.

The biscuits were pretty tasty and addictive, but the reason I probably liked them had a lot more to do with how they were just there.  When you are stuck on an airplane for a few hours, any food feels like a special treat (kind of like Eddie Murphy's quote from Raw about if you're starving and somebody throws you a cracker - \"That was the best cracker I ever ate in my life.\").\n\nThis Biscoff shop dispenses coffee (a Biscoff cookie is free with each coffee purchase) and many different quantities of Biscoff biscuits (with twin cookies individually packaged to keep the intended crispness).  The prices were actually pretty reasonable and we were able to buy a good number of cookies for about $3.\n\nGood or bad, the taste is quite distinguishable (kind of like how the taste of a fortune cookie is immediately recognizable).

You're basically drinking Biscoff cookies with this. Boy was it fabulous! Not too strong, not too sweet.

A really good cup of coffee with a complimentary tiny Biscoff Biscuit hit the spot.  A MUCH better cup of coffee than Starbucks and at a very decent price!!  I love it when an establishment at a very touristy spot doesn't try and rape you on the prices.  We enjoyed it so much that we stopped back a second time.  If you're craving a good cup of coffee while visiting SF, stop into a Biscoff's.", "author": "Patricia G."}

I freaked.  I mean.  O-M-G FREAK OUT!  I could have gotten my Mocha WAY earlier, but I had saved myself because I knew I could count on a delicious Pier 39 Mocha here at SFCC.  Biscoff was a familiar name, but I couldn't remember why.  \n\n...until I stepped inside.\n\n\"Oh, BISCOFF Biscuits!\"  \"HOLY CRAP those things are SO GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD!\"\n\nCan't believe that something I had to hunt down like a psycho years ago after having them on the plane and special ordering them over the phone after calling the airline - they are HERE in SF... at Pier 39!  YUMMY! \n\nAnd the bonus to this little story?  It's still San Francisco Coffee Company Coffee!  YAY!  \n\nIt's a Win Win!  A Caffeine Cookie concoction!

I see this place every morning when I run past Fisherman's Wharf and thought, \"hm, I wonder if they have it. . .\"\n\nThey DO.  JARS OF SPREADABLE SPECULOOS.  No, seriously.  Crushed-up cookie paste deliciousness for $5.50.  I squeaked.  Audibly.  Forget Nutella, forget peanut butter, forget anything else: this stuff trumps.  I giddily picked up three jars and got a coffee, which comes with a free cookie.  They also sell packs of speculoos cookies, but you can get them at Walgreens for cheaper, so I wouldn't bother.\n\nVegans, rejoice: their cookies and the speculoos spread are all vegan.  If you get an espresso drink with soy, soy will set you back 75 cents (rather steep in my book).", "author": "Catherine K."}

This is also the cheapest place to buy it. Usually it's available at specialty stores at a high premium for being imported, but this place sells a jar for $6-7. I believe they also give samples of it if you ask. \n\nThey also cater very well to tourists or even if you're a local. I guess they just assume everyone is a tourist so they will wrap your glass jar so it's ready for packing. How nice!", "author": "Beverly T."}

Why do the people that work here hate their customers? On my last visit, not only were the cashiers not helpful, they were almost hostile to the customers.  They even got my order wrong!  That said, if you can stomach the bad service,  the coffee is good and the cookies are exceptional. All different types of Biscoff's speculoos cookies and cookie spreads are available for purchase, as well.  If you park in the Pier 39 Parking Garage, check your parking stub for a coupon.

I work across the street, so it's convenient for me to go there. They are a Coffee Place and offer cofffee, it should be a go to for me..right?\nWrong.\nI have never ever been there once in the last six years without having the following problem, not once\n1.)Always out of coffee, not just one Dispenser but at least two to three out of four. I always alway always have to wait at least 10 minutes for them to make more and refil the servers before I can get some. It's like Lucy pulling the Football away at the last minute as Charlie Brown goes to kick it. \n2.)They are always rude, inept or badly spoken in thier dealings. The Manager himself is hostile and rude and has poor people skills. It's puzzling that someone who seems to hate people and hate serving people should pick this kind of business to go into. \n3.The coffee is always bad or old or cold. They make hands down the worst coffee in san francisco.\nI tend to buy my coffee at Starbucks or Peets but I have to walk several blocks to do so, it's worth it to avoid this place.\nThere will always be a bevy of unaware tourists coming here to buy thier wares, but not me.

It was nice to have a small tasty biscuit with the coffee. However the service needs to be reviewed by owner. The girl who made coffee on Sunday around 10:15a had an awful attitude. And she was the one who messed up the order! We order a bagel and a medium latte with extra shot. She gave our coffee to someone else and when I finally asked where mine was she handed me someone elses latte. I asked if it had 3 shots and she snapped back that an extra shot was 75 cents. I said I had already paid for it and she said I had to show her the receipt which I did. Even then she insisted that my receipt was for earlier in the day (which it was by about 5 minutes due to me waiting). She acted as though I was trying to cheat her by getting a free coffee!  I don't even think she could actually read the receipt correctly to be honest.  In the end she gave me somone else's latte and gave me attitude when she pushed it across the counter. I told her  she was very rude and that when you make a mistake you shouldn't treat the customer as though they did something wrong to which she told me to go complain to the manager.  If I hadn't been holding up my Navy buddy during fleet week over a cup of coffee I probably would have.  She should not be working at this store where so many tourist come by for coffee. She gave everyone a very bad impression.\nBy way of contrast, on Saturday the guy making the coffee was very friendly and gave us an extra package of their biscuits when we mentioned how tastey they were.", "author": "Kim H."}
