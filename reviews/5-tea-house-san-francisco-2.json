The place has changed A LOT since then, adding a lot more than just boba on the menu. There is now ice cream and food on the menu. \nI know a lot of people here are complaining about the syrup that they hide in the back, but honestly for $2.99 you are able to get a variety of toppings, a select of fruit teas, and a chubby cup. For only $2.99!! That's pretty much stealing, I don't know how they make money but they do because I always come back.\n\nCons: The boba flavors taste like they mix it without a recipe, I bet if they tried to make it better it would win some people over. They had too much on the menu it's kind of overwhelming. \nPros: \nThey do have fast service and great customer service.\nPrices are super fair for taste and quality. \nFor about $6 you can get a boba drink and a California roll, so how can I give this place less than four stars?", "author": "Alberto S."}

It's the best deal in the city for boba! You could choose 4 drinks for only $1.99 including boba. Original, taro, jasmine milk tea (forgot what the fourth option is). It's similar to Teaway that you could add as much toppings as you like up to the line. Toppings include big boba, small boba, grass jelly,  almond jelly,  egg pudding etc. My favorite is almond milk tea with boba. It's only $1 for an ice cream cone with one scoop.

Nothing worst than smiling at a cashier and being met with a cold stare. \n\nThe Order: I ordered an avocado smoothie with boba. I didn't get asked what size, how sweet or even if I wanted to try any other toppings. So I just waited to see what was thrown at me. When I got it it looked great. (See picture), but it tasted a lot less great than it looked.

Seriously? So he brought it to the barista's attention and she just snatched it back. Suddenly all of the workers were yelling at each other in Chinese (as if we didn't understand the language) and saying that my bf claims the drink doesn't taste like matcha. Is this how you provide customer service? First, you lie to us and try to pass off a regular milk tea as matcha milk tea and then you claim that we are making false accusations?? After about 2 minutes of the workers bickering to each other they finally give us another matcha milk tea, this time more green in color and still not the best taste but it's whatever, we were so annoyed with their attitude.

It was also near my SF house so it was convenient.\n\nThe condiments or extra things you put in your drinks (boba, pudding, lychee, etc) are all self serve. Thought that was kinda weird, but ok. I'm not sure how fresh their ingredients are because my drinks had hard chunks of jelly in it. Their drinks are huge, like the ones they serve at PurpleKow and each drink is between $3-$4. My iced milk drink with pudding and grass jelly was $3.99. It tasted OK. It wasn't too sweet but it lacked something, maybe it's the tea haha. I'd still come back if I was around the area, but I think I'm ready to find other places that serve iced milk.\n\nI also got the eggettes. I thought their eggettes were better than other places, like Eggettes. I think they add extra flavoring to it. It did become soggy within a few minutes which was a bummer. Boo!\n\nI didn't have to wait in line which was cool. The drinks and eggettes were ready in about 4 minutes or so.", "author": "Rosie W."}

The self-serve add ins include various jellies, two sizes of tapioca pearls, red beans, etc. For snacks and desserts they have honey toast, crepes, waffles, ice cream, and egg puffs with fried snacks on the way.\n\n* 5 Degree green milk tea ($2.99): The tea part was fine - there was real tea flavor, it wasn't too bitter, it was nice and creamy, sweet but not too sweet.

They have the \"chubby cups\" (short and stout bucket like cups).  The best part is that you get to choose what you want inside.  So you can mix and match boba with grass jelly or size of your tapioca pearls and well as decide how much you want.  It's wonderful!\n\nAs for the tea, it's pretty standard with no surprises, but definitely gets the job done.  I ordered an iced milk with caramel at 50% sugar and it was perfect.  I highly suggest their black milk tea or the iced milk as those were spot on.  Most of all the service is quick and easy and there is relatively no line (besides those eagerly choosing what they want inside their drink).\n\nIt's on the corner of a street so parking is difficult to find, but there's not much around so the traffic is not heavy.  If you're looking for an alternative to Purple Kow or those other milk tea shops in the Richmond, this is a great and easy substitute for those with a car that are in the mission area.\n\n5 Tea House also has a plethora of other deserts ranging from honey toast to crepes and more.

Bad if there's a line and there's people indecisive about their toppings. \n\nI got the milk tea, as that's my standard for any bubble tea place. This one was pretty good. A bit of tea flavor, and kind of sweet. Similar to Sweethearts milk tea, but a little less tea flavor.\n\nI also always order an eggette if they have one. This...was not as nicely done.

Sadly, Tea House is the epitome of that! I've visited quite a few times and have closely observed their hygienic practices and it pains my heart to bump their 4 star rating to 1 star. Of the handful of times I've been here, it's always been packed with elementary school kids shoving their hands in every. single. thing. Straws, utensils, and EVEN the boba bar. Sure, Tea House has no control over their customers, but they DO have control over how to properly keep their products sanitary such as using wrapped straws, keeping the utensils behind the counter, having someone serve the boba behind a glass window etc. Then again, all of this costs money and I highly doubt that they would want to hire more people to keep their establishment clean.. \n\nToday was the last straw! I saw the guy at the counter handle money with gloves THEN grab the cups by the rim and start arranging them on the counter. No, not by the neck, no not at the bottom, but putting his germ infested fingers on the INSIDE the rim of the cup where the milk tea would eventually settle.

And it only gets worst, the boyfriend, got one of their Iced Milks which was the worst thing ever! YES \"thing\" because that should NOT be a drink! It was watered down and powdery and absolutely no milk taste, color OR consistency, how ironic that it's name was iced milk.", "author": "Oriel F."}

They have a self serve boba station that also includes many colors of puddings and jellies to add to your tea. The cups have a line drawn on them to indicate how much of the ingredients you can add into your drink. They only have one size of cup, which are the large fat ones. I would've preferred a smaller size. My drink came out to $3.26.\n\nThe tea itself isn't particularly fresh as you can see their pre-made batch in the fridge behind the counter. It didn't taste half bad though. I hate it when they make it too sweet but this one had a good balance. Their tapioca is pretty good, nice and chewy. Their pudding is ok. I guess I'd come back another time if I were craving boba but the place didn't really wow me. They seem to have food options too, I might give those a try.", "author": "Sannie L."}

I told her out of my kind heart that I only ordered one, which I could have scored an extra one for free. The lady took  one out, ignored me, and went on telling the other lady who packed it that i only ordered one. No thanks or sorry? I left the place feeling I should have kept my mouth shut and kept both of the fin soups. I put red vinegar in my soup and left. When I drank it, it was completely watered down. Sure it was packed with mushrooms and such but it lacked flavor. I would have been mad if I paid more for it but good thing they're having a promotion since this place is new. 2$ fin soup, $2 egg puff, $1 ice cream.

I tend to get the basic flavors I get from nearly every boba place, taro and caramel if they have it, and those are so good here. However I've made bold moves of trying other flavors they have and they aren't so good. For example, the strawberry one tastes really weird, I ended up throwing it away, and so did my friend. Every once and a while they'll let the place go unkept and it bothers me. Other than that the place is pretty cool, it's convenient because it's so close to my house.", "author": "Mellany Q."}

I mean we're talking about a huge large pint of boba for crying out loud for about less then 5 bucks. Who wouldn't love a HUGE cup of boba to start their day off?\n\nThe concept is great for what it is cause there isn't one like it (5 stars for that). BUT ok lets face the facts about this place. \n\nThey use sharpies to draw on the cups to where you can fill the jelly/ boba to, but why re-stack it again? What if there is still wet ink on it then your re-stack the cups now you got a sharpie marks on the inside of a clean cup. YUCK! \n\nAnd I agree with one of the reviews, by health code practices, if you got gloves one for one thing like handling money or cleaning, take the thing off and put some new ones on TO FIX MY DRINK! NASTY! Don't use the same one. The time I went the gal who was handling the front had gloves on, she was taking my money with it, wipe down the counter with it still on, then took a new batch of boba to place in on the counter with the same gloves. \n\nIf your one to care less on how your food was handled by all mean go for it, if you get sick I don't know what to tell you. \n\nWould I go again, no ill take by business to a place I know that runs their business in a very clean fashion. \n\nAin't nobody got time for that!", "author": "Conchita B."}

It taste like honeydew but had an after taste of coffee or chocolate, I couldn't make it out to be exact. Instead of the pastel green color that I am use to this was a tannish brown. I don't know if this is normal for them or maybe someone made a mistake or didn't rinse out whatever container was used to make the previous order.

The boba also was tasteless and straight up disgusting it looked any where from fresh.. When i hear people compare it to Tpumps and what not it makes me want to throw up that disgusting drink i had.. Then another night i was walking buy with a buddy hunting for some desert  and this place was packed and smelled wonderful, so i hoped that the food was a whole lot better than their drinks but damn was i let down again..
