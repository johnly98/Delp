The flavor was masterful! Yum!! Interestingly, the mixture included a few French fries embedded in the sauce. The sauce was superb.\n\nMi Lindo Peru offers the same tasty mixture of herbs, onions, tomatoes with chicken or seafood. I think I will try the chicken next time (Saltado de Pollo). The chicken is dark meat and I prefer that to white meat.\n\nThe dinner portion was substantial; actually, more than I could eat. Oh, and the Lomo Saltado includes a large serving of rice. At lunch the portions and price are smaller. \n\nThe waiter and other employees were so very friendly and helpful. I had not been to a Peruvian food restaurant so I needed advice. The waiter was superb, cordial, and helpful. \n\nMi Lindo Peru is smallish in size and not fancy, but that is fine with me. I like this place.\n\nParking is street metered, I think.

Every dish we had was authentic tasting. \n\nWe started with bread and yucca fries. The bread came with this spicy dipping sauce that was delicious. And the sauce that came with the yucca fries were addicting. It was rich and creamy but also had a kick. We then had the beef hearts and papa rellenas. The papa rellenas were stuffed with meat and olives. The stuffing was tasty and they definitely did not skimp on that. The green chicken soup was amazing. Don't forget to squeeze the lime. The loma soltado was good and the fish ceviche was super fresh. \n\nWould definitely recommend this place!", "author": "Windy M."}

So many good things on the menu that you can diversify beyond the standard lomo saltado.  Seriously, everything was just bursting with flavor!\n\nBread, Butter & Salsa: This was different.  Soft bread, soft butter and salsa.  But the salsa was heavy on the onions and cumin, so more like chutney.  Anyway, it was surprisingly delicious.  Had to pace myself to save room for the food I was actually paying for.\n\nChicharron Al Ajo: These was AMAZING!  Every bit of chicken had a super crispy exterior.  The cuts were a little odd with a bunch of bones, but maybe that kinda small piece big surface area technique is what enables it to be so crispy.  There was an enormous amount of fried garlic on topic, which made it delicious.  A nice dip of lemon juice and oil to add a counterbalancing tang.\n\nLomo Saltado: This is typically my favorite Peruvian dish, so I've tried a ton of variations over the years.  They don't get fancy with big chunks of filet mignon.  Just respectable strips of nondescript beef that one would see in a stir fry dish.  I liked that they cut the tomatoes into a similarly manageable shape.  Swimming in its soy based marinade, so lots to flavor the rice with.  The french fries were nice and crispy, but not overly so.\n\nMaracuya: I love passionfruit so I was all about this drink.  Very refreshing paired against all the rich deep fried stuff.", "author": "Adam B."}

First let me state the service is extremely friendly and efficient, so no problems there. Everything was run like a well oiled machine.\n\nNow to the food. First, they give you bread to start with, but I feel like it didn't really mesh well with the menu. Maybe a different type of bread would work better? Or plantain chips? It's nice that they give it, but I didn't feel like I could eat it with anything we ordered, that's all. We started off with the fish ceviche and while the quality of fish was great, the juice was from lemons, not limes. This may not seem like a big deal, but it is. Oh it is!!! And I didn't like it. Not one bit. I also don't think it was fresh lemon juice. It seemed like it came from those lemon squeeze bottles, so if that doesn't sound appealing to you don't order the ceviche. \n\nNext we ordered the grilled beef hearts (not my idea. I wanted causa), and I was not a fan, but I don't think it's because they did anything wrong. I just don't like consuming that particular organ. Moving on, we ordered the lomo saltado for the main and it was just ok. I really like the fresh cut fries and might order it again if I found myself here, but I'm in NO rush to come back. If I go to a Peruvian place I'm mostly judging them on their ceviche, and they missed the mark completely. If they begin to use lime juice then maybe we can talk....", "author": "Steph L."}

Initially Yelp gave a lot of options for Peruvian ....... but my friends recommended this place. A small, nice, hut like place. Nothing fancy....... However, it is very clean and managed by two proactive people.\n\nLike any other table, we started with complimentary bread and Salsa Criolla, this is a Peruvian version of Onion-Chili Relish..... and I must say, it was a surprise for me! It had a perfect kick of salt, acid and spice. Onion pieces added a nice crunch punch in each bite.\n\nHeart meat tapas skewers were over the top. We ordered two servings of it and cleaned our plates fast. My friends caught me saving the last piece for my last bite.\n\nYuca fries with sauce was decent and ceviche was over the hook! The perfect mish mash of tangy fresh fish meat topped with sweet vinegary red onions.\n\nInterestingly their steak was drenched with a secret sauce, which made us curious to ask the lady about it.\n\nThe server instinctively realized how much I love sauce and generously served their special spicy house sauce which was damn hot with beautiful sweet habanero aroma to it.\n\nDefinitely take your foodie friends here.

Heard nothing but great things about this restaurant and since she's Peruvian why not try a little taste of home. We started off with a few great appetizers had the gambas aj\u00ed which are essentially garlic prawns. Delicious. Papa la huancaina. Also tasty. We both ordered the lomo saltadado. To our surprise it wasn't as great but edible. Lacking flavor. To top it all off we ordered this \"Paella\" which was anything but that. The rice was lumpy and cold. The seafood over cooked. And overall lacking flavor. Besides everything else this was the only issue we had and when we brought it up to the server in charge she informed us that we \" had already ordered it therefore we had to eat it\" we tried to argue that we weren't going to pay for something we didn't eat and she offered us a box to take it home. Talk about great customer service. We paid for the meal in full rather then argue and gave her the whole dish and asked her to dispose of it whatever way she felt. Promise to never return to this horrible customer service lacking establishment ever again. My 2 cents. Enjoy. \nPS.

It looks like a little bowl of water salsa but it really is just a bowl of yummy sauce!  But yes our server said the way to eat it is on a small piece of bread with butter and some sauce.  But I could use that sauce (and I did) on everything! Warning, it is spicy, but it is so flavorful.\n\nOrdered three dishes to try\n\nArroz com Pollo ($14.95): it's like a seasoned fried rice (nothing like Chinese fried rice though) with a side of onions/tomatoes.  Seasoned heavily in cilantro sauce.  Huge chunks of chicken breast and insanely seasoned rice.  I did like a little yummy spicy sauce on it to give it a little kick.\n\nAji de gallina: ($14.95): Shredded chicken and potatoes in a yellow curry sauce and a few slices of hard boiled egg.  Really good flavor but I think I'm not a huge fan of shredded chicken.  It's supposed to be spicy but I ordered it medium - I think that was a mistake, it could use some spice.  Comes with a heap of well-cooked rice.\n\nPescado Saltado ($18.95): Sauteed red snapper with onions, tomatoes and potatoes (but really it seems like it's sauteed with french fries!).  Really flavorful and yes comes with a heap of rice too\n\nIt's a little expensive with all main dishes seeming to be between $15 to $20.  But to be fair, portions are huge and we left with tons of leftovers that I'm excited to eat (of course got to-go containers of the spicy sauce too).  If it weren't so expensive I think I'd give it 5-stars but only 4 because even with the huge portions, I'm not convinced I feel like it's fully up to the value.\n\nIt seems like they took reservations for large parties; we just walked in for two.\n\nSingle bathroom\n\nTakes VISA and MC.\n\nParking is often easier on Valencia or behind (e.g., Mission and San Jose sometimes are tough to park on)\n\nI will definitely be back to try some of the other yummy options here.", "author": "Traci H."}

Usually this sauce is the best thing ever to me and I can put it on everything, it was so good before that I could literally eat the sauce by itself, it was amazing. Now I can't even eat the sauce. It's been 3 years now so I thought maybe I would give them another chance and see if the food is back up to par but it is not. I went a free days ago and got a side of huancaina sauce. It doesn't even taste like huancaina sauce and it totally different, I'm so sad because I dream of their old huancaina sauce and now I can never have it again and will have to get it from other Peruvian places. I also got the lomo saltado which also has changed in flavor etc but it was still good, but not as good as it once was and that is why I am giving 3 stars because some things are still good.

Limon is a favorite of mine, but I decided to give this place a shot since he spoke so highly of it.\n\nWe didn't get the usual complimentary bread with butter and salsa de rocoto (hot pepper sauce) like everyone else. Maybe they ran out?\n\nInstead we got their spicy salsa and a handful of CANCHA http://bit.ly/16I8yDf.\nThese toasted corn kernals are usually served alongside ceviche, but it's also great for snacking by itself. \n- It's hollow so they shatter in your mouth, rather then crunching. I can see why these tasty corn nuts are popular in Peru. They're quite addictive.\n\nCEVICHE DE MARISCOS ($16.95): \nhttp://bit.ly/1AOpUrq\nSoft red snapper, mussels, calamari, and prawns are marinated with fresh lime juice. \n- The fork-tender pieces of sweet daikon and carrots were a nice balance to the acidic citrus juice. There was even a nice sprinkling of that cancha, yum! \nI would definitely order this again.\n\nLOMO SALTADO ($14.95): \nhttp://bit.ly/1JH2f1S\nLean strips of beef sauteed w/onions, french fries and tomatoes. It was okay. Not as flavorful and sauced up like the one I had at Limon's.\n\nBISTECK A LO POBRE ($16.95):\nhttp://bit.ly/13TQZz2\nA traditional dish consisting of a grilled steak accompanied by fried potatoes, sauteed onions, topped with a fried egg.\n- Instead of the fries, Mi Lindo Peru serves theirs with 2 small pieces of plantains. \n- Also the steak resembled a hamburger patty more than an actual steak, but it was nicely cooked and juicy. \n- The egg yolk and extra sauce from the pan jus makes this dish even more wonderful.\n\nCHICHARRON DE POLLO ($9.95):\nhttp://bit.ly/1CsN8nX\nMenu said \"breaded pieces of deep fried chicken served with fresh lemon juice and spices.\"\n- We got drummettes (I counted 6 or 7) that were unseasoned and rather small for $10. I was expecting something more like the entire fried chicken from Limon. \n- The dipping sauce was basically lemon juice dusted w/salt and pepper. Meh. \n\nOverall, a nice meal with friendly service.

I generally am not a fan of hispanic food, peruvian, mexican, etc, but this place felt like an exception. It was incredibly tasty, I got something simple -- steak with rice. They managed to make that so incredibly good, I was blown away. They had this great steak sauce that I still think about it. It was 18 dollars, which is on the pricey side, but if you're willing to shell out a little more cash, it is definitely worth it for this place. The menu was incredibly diverse and there was a great big variety of meals to choose from. They had this delicious and unique drink that was called, \"Chicha Morada\" or sweet purple corn juice. While it might sound somewhat unappealing by the name, do not let that deceive you, it was amazing and paired quite nicely with the meal and general theme of the place. Like even with steak and rice, the flavors mixed, unlike a traditional american soft drink, which cannot really blend well with meals.  The one issue I had was with the wait and the pricey menu, I had to wait a little while to get a seat because it was packed, but that simply means this place is just that good and the whole menu I felt the prices could have been lowered, but there were reasonable.

Our waiter was very polite and patient with us while we browsed the menu while casually sipping on a liter of sangria, LOL. Which by the way, is probably the best sangria I've ever had. A liter is totally OK for two people to share if you're wondering. We ordered ceviche de mariscos, lomo saltado, and gambas al ajo. All of our dishes were rather tasty but did have some things to nitpick about. \nFirst off, they served us bread with butter and salsa. We were expecting tortilla chips and it totally did not happen. But we love carbs so we ate the bread anyways haha. \n\nCeviche de Mariscos- Very generous portions of red snapper, squid, shrimp, red onion, and mussels. The only thing we did not enjoy was the mussels. I don't think the lemon/lime meshes well with cooking the mussel, it was very rough and not very appetizing. \n\nLomo Saltado- Just delicious. The sliced beef, onions, peppers, and french fries paired well together. The flavor of the meat was on point. Just wish they didn't cook the meat for so long, as it was rather tough.\n\nGambas al ajo- Anytime you put excessive amounts of garlic on anything, it is bound to be delicious. Lots of garlic on shrimp?! exxtra delicious! Shrimp was not overcooked at all and they give you a generous amount of shrimp too, which is always a plus. \n\nWill most definitely be back sometime in the near future to try more foodz and drink more liters of Sangria!", "author": "Christine G."}

The rice was light and delicious and tasty just like cilantro. The chicken pieces  were moist as well. \nMy husband ordered the steak with potatoes and white rice.

And the Chef comes out and serves the plates, definitely appreciate that.\n\n- FOOD, amazingly good\n- PRICES, affordable \n- SERVICE, impeccable\n- AMBIANCE, small mom and pop kind of spot\n\nPeruvian food is one of my favorite kinds of food. I've been to several Peruvian restaurants (upscale places) around the city and even gone to the Peruvian food festival that happens yearly. Surprised with myself that I have not discovered this HIDDEN GEM earlier!!! I've driven by this place a million times and have read reviews on yelp, finally had the chance to eat here. \n\nHEFFER-STYLE STATUS.\n\nBREAD (free) -  bread while you wait for your meal. Good fresh bread with a spread of butter but don't waste your appetite eating all the bread, your meal portions are big.\n\nPERUVIAN CORN (~$2) - If you never seen Peruvian corn, they are huge. Looks like their pulled each kernel off, fried them, and served it as a side. LOVE IT, always refer to these as \"Peruvian corn nuts\".\n\nCHICHARRON De CALAMARES ($8.95) - Fried squid serves with their house sauce. the sauce is light pink and has that perfect dipping sauce thats not too powerful and not too light. Also on the side is a pinch of vegetables that tasted like ceviche. Thus far the best place I know in the bay area that knows how to serve up Calamari. Damn good calamari.\n\nSALTADO De POLLO ($12.95) - Lean strips of  chicken sauteed with onions, tomato, and french fries also served with a side of their rice. their rice is NOT typical rice it has a really different taste to it. SO GOOD. And the description sound so simple but the flavors are amazing. If you had Lomo Saltado, you know exactly what i mean. This is the first place to have a chicken version of lomo saltado. absolute heaven!!! Well worth your money, get left overs, and the portions of the serving is ALOT.\n\nGAMBAS AL AJO ($15.95) - prawns sauteed in wine, butter, and garlic sauce served with rice. Same kind of rice as their serve with all their other dishes. The sauce on the prawns was droolicious and they give you good amount of prawns. Well worth your money.\n\nLUCUMA ICE CREAM (~$4) - topped the meal with some ice cream. OMG I love lucuma ice cream. Had it several times in the past at other restaurants and will order it again and again. It's orange and you'd think it tastes very fruity but its not like that. It's a subtle creamy light taste.

The chicken pieces are fried with minced garlic and is served with a lemon sauce that is sooooo good! A great appetizer to get and share with others.

Mi Lindo Peru is an unpretentious restaurant catering to locals and families and provides earnestly prepared ethnic Peruvian food at reasonable prices.  Restaurants in SF are always closing due to increasing costs of doing business in the city and changing customer tastes. In light of this, I fervently hope Mi Lindo Peru remains in business for years to come.", "author": "Yoshi O."}

So much flavor, something different for foodies and curious diners.\n\nI have been wanting to go here for two years and finally stopped by with a friend. We ordered everything we wanted on the menu and still our bill was remarkably low.\n\nI love the atmosphere and feel of the restaurant. Small, dark, intimate and somewhat divey, much like you'd expect with restaurants on the mission. The place fills up quickly and there isn't much room to wait by the door, but luckily there are a few cute bars around if you have to wait for your table.\n\nAttentive and friendly staff- I will be back very soon!", "author": "Nika C."}

The dish is about 15-16 from what I remember, but seeing that I always have to pack a ToGo box, it's basically lunch for two days.

For some reason there are not too many peruvian sit down options here in SF compared to Chicago... So when I found out about this place I definitely knew I had to try it! The papa rellena is wonderful and crispy! Also, their chicha morada is very delicious and I recommend to go ahead and order the 1 L jug when you sit down!\n\nOverall, a great experience.

We came on a Saturday night around 8pm without reservations, and had to wait 10-15 minutes for a party of 5. The service here is friendly, but not super polished. Since Peruvian cuisine is best eaten family style, we ordered a bunch of dishes to try:\n\n-Pisco Sour (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mi-lindo-per%C3%BA-san-francisco-2?select=3vElPQHYPtUbV-Kq6bDq2A#3vElPQHYPtUbV-Kq6bDq2A): Good, but no different from other good pisco sours I've had.\n-Anticuhos/Beef Heart (Peruvian Shish-Kabab Served w/Grilled Potatoes, $6.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mi-lindo-per%C3%BA-san-francisco-2?select=3vElPQHYPtUbV-Kq6bDq2A#hX5Jpx9mRKd_Si7oLxsVTw): Okay.

I liked the pickled vegetables it was served with more than the empanada itself.\n-Yucca Frita (Fried Yucca Served w/White Cheese & Yellow Chile, $5.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mi-lindo-per%C3%BA-san-francisco-2?select=3vElPQHYPtUbV-Kq6bDq2A#PfsZSECtqRuMEqrONM0sCw): Yum!

I liked the white fish they used in the ceviche, and it wasn't overly tangy.\n-Bisteck a Lo Pobre (Top-Sirloin Steak Sauteed w/Onions & Tomatoes, Topped w/Fried Plantain & Egg, $14.95, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mi-lindo-per%C3%BA-san-francisco-2?select=3vElPQHYPtUbV-Kq6bDq2A#A2JPibLHH4qSVuW0nccV6A): Pretty good, but a little salty and the beef was overcooked.

Weird to have saut\u00e9ed fries? Think of them as fried potatoes!\n\nArroz Con Pollo is a rice dish saut\u00e9ed in cilantro sauces. Although the dish was green in color, it was not dominated by cilantro flavor. The sauce made the rice very fluffy! Yum!\n\nService was impeccable. I don't think the restaurant was used to handling a party of our size. But throughout the whole night, Carlos (owner manager) did not miss a step. We asked, he gave. We didn't ask, he still gave!\n\nCheers to a wonderful night of great food, great service and of course great company! =D", "author": "Marti L."}

Standing from the outside looking in, this small cozy restaurant embodies the spirit of \"fiesta familiar\" via its red and mango colored coordination from the inside out to which projects a vibrant atmosphere suitable for both intimate and festive occasions. This place has been sitting on my radar for the past year after having the privilege of dining at other great restaurants in the area. Finally I had the chance to co-sponsor a private UYE with prolific Yelper Marti L. that brought 30 Yelpers to break bread here, including a much appreciated appearance by Yelp co-founder, Russ S. and good friend and East Bay CM Ligaya T. \n\nI had the pleasure to reconnect with many Yelpers and met several Bay Area notables for the first time. This included Darryl P, Danny L, David B, Simone W, Jason G, Jonathan W, Karen Y, Michael M, Phillip W, Peter L, Hannah C, May C, Dorothy C and husband Peter, Rinky N and husband Mike, Stephanie J and her guest Linh, Tom R, Manabu M, Tammy C, Earl G and wife Joyce, Hen A, Marti L and boyfriend Sam, Russ S and Ligaya T.\n\nWe ordered a total of 22 dishes for a family style feast and had a lot of fun passing them around. To mention a few, we shared:\n\n***Appetizers:\nChicharron De Pollo - breaded piecesof chicken with lemon juice\nCeviche Mixto - assorted seafood in fresh lime juice\n\n***Main Entrees:\nSaltado De Pollo - lean strips of chicken sauteed w / onions, tomatoes & french fries\nLomo Saltado - lean strips of beef sauteed w/ onions, tomatoes & french fries\nPaella Marinera - saffron flavored spanish rice with seafood\nPescado Sudado - steamed snapper fillet topped w/ onions, tomatoes and potatoes\nArroz Con Pollo- chicken cooked with rice and green peas in cilantro sauce\nTamal De Pollo- steamed corn dough stuffed with chicken\nPescado Al Ajo- fried fillet topped with a butter-garlic sauce and a touch of white wine served with seasoned rice and sliced potato\nPlantains- fried bananas\n\n***Vegan Dishes (Special request):\nEnsalada Mixta--mixed greens with avocado, potatoes & tomatoes with a vinaigrette dressing\nSaltado De Vegetables - sauteed onions, celery, carrots, mushrooms, tomatoes & french fries served w/ seasoned rice\nPaella De Verduras - saffron flavored spanish rice with vegetables \n\nThroughout the dinner people were talking about how much they enjoyed the ceviche, pescado al ajo, and paella. Playing host, I didn't get to try all the dishes but thought the Arroz Con Pollo, Saltado De Pollo, Lomo Saltado, and Pescado Al Ajo were very good. The paella unfortunately didn't have the crispy texture but the flavor was still robust and a major highlight of the evening. The only dish that didn't win people over was chicharron de pollo which people said was dry. I also thought the tamal de pollo was decent. Portions were very generous.\n\nThe owner, Carlos, was the most pleasant and easy person to work with. I had the opportunity to work closely with him for a month to plan this event. The U-shaped table arrangement wasn't the easiest for everyone to intermingle, but it also gave us a nice open area for people to eventually get out of their seats and reach out to those they haven't seen in a while. Carlos was our server and was the most attentive, caring, and knowledgeable on which dishes were good for sharing; and was very effective in serving to the needs of our vegan friends. For a group of this size, he gave us the best service I've ever experienced to date. \n\nMy co-sponsor, Marti L, was instrumental in the success of this event and I can't thank her enough for the work she's done. Just to be clear to my readers, the restaurant did not have advanced knowledge that this was a Yelp event so the scores of affiliated reviews were reflective of how the restaurant normally operates. In the end everyone paid $12.10 per person, including tax and 20% tip. Weighing in on the price and value, this is by far the best tasting and most affordable private UYE I've organized to date.\n\nSince the event, people are still telling me that they are expecting to revisit Mi Lindo Peru on their own in the near future, which says a lot about their first rate culinary acumen, d\u00e9cor, price, portions, and service. I too, expect to return to this beautiful restaurant which I call Nuestro Muy Lindo Peru.\n\nI invite everyone to check out Philip W's review for the wonderful photos taken at the event.", "author": "Daniel L."}

As someone who grew up with home cooked Peruvian food, this is hands down the closest you will come to authentic comida peruana (Peruvian food).\n\nThe service is friendly and generally prompt. They do get quite busy, so don't expect not to wait during dinner times, especially on the weekends.\n\nThe food is fresh and the serving sizes are generous. My standards which never let me down are Papa a la Huancaina (boiled potatoes on a bed of lettuce with hard boiled egg slices and some olives, covered in a spicy cheese sauce), Lomo Saltado (comparable to a stir fry, but the rice is served separately from the strips of beef that are cooked with tomatoes, onions and french fried potatoes), with some chicha morada (a flavorful purple corn drink). The yucca (boiled or fried) is great. The anticuchos are also very good.

In brief, I am unsure how this restaurant stays open in a city known for its food.  I'd get it if there were no other Peruvian restaurants but that is no longer the case.  \n\nBottom line:  Go anywhere else but here.  \n\nThe Good:\n1.  The servers were nice\n2.  We went early in the evening and were seated immediately.\n3.  The fried calamari was good as was the pescado a lo macho.\n\nThe Bad:\n1.  The pisco sours tasted like they were made with that lemon that comes in plastic lemon containers at Safeway.  They were too sweet and may not have had blended egg yolk.  They were passable but not as a pisco sour.\n\n2.  The ceviche was made with red snapper.  What??!?  Yes.  And the outcome was not good.  Again, are they scared of fresh lemons?  This hardly had the lemony flavor I'm used to and the consistency was odd.  Not a yummy dish by any standards.\n\n3. Three of us go really sick about 5 hours after dinner.  My boyfriend and I woke up at the exact same time and I had to get sick.  My other friend had horrid stomach pains.  I need to check with the others in my party but this is more than coincidence.

Not too spicy (cus I'm a wuss, I admit it), the two were so good together, even more so once I added the mushrooms on top.  I'm drooling thinking about it as I type.\n\nService, I give 5 stars:  Attentive, yet not obtrusive.  We didn't need to wait long for anything, and we were in and out right on schedule.\n\nPatronage:  Like I stated earlier, the place was half-full by the time we left, and of people of various ethnicities.  You'll feel right at home here.\n\nOverall, I truly enjoyed my first visit down the Peruvian lane.  This place is definitely a place I'd come back to.  Perhaps we'll see you there next time.", "author": "Lorrayne L."}

I don't really have that much Peruvian food but I figured this would be a great place to try it out, with its high reviews. I definitely was not disappointed. \n\nTallarin de marscos (seafood spaghetti) is now my new favorite dish.\nIt was essentially everything I loved in one dish (seafood, noodles with a kick). The spaghetti came piping out and had a great al-denta taste with seafood flavors. Normally, I don't care too much for onions and cilantro but I really enjoyed it with this dish. The order included a small container for the spicy sauce (which was BOMB) and some bread.  Within a matter of minutes, l scarfed down the spaghetti like no other..and despite being full, I was kind of sad that there wasn't anymore left.. \n\nWhat puts this place over the top was how friendly the staff members were while letting me order take out despite showing up a few minutes late from the lunch hour... During the time I was waiting for the order, they were very hospitable and friendly by offering me a glass of water. \n\nI shall be back to try more. yummmmmmm.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

There were only two servers and they both juggled a lot of tables, and still managed to bring everything in a timely manner and take the time to have a conversation. \n\nI got the pescado al ajo, a white fish fried in a minced garlic breading. If you are a garlic lover this is heaven in your mouth. You can also get it without the breading for a healthier option. The plate came with rice and potatoes so be prepared to be full. They also bring you bread beforehand, with the delicious chili dipping sauce which we heaped on nearly everything on our plates because it was so good with anything. \n\nA word of warning with the pescado al ajo... you will be excreting garlic for at least one whole day. It's a little awkward to pass gas and mistake it for something cooking.... yeah that's no joke. But it's so worth it!\n\nMy girlfriend got the mar y tierra, which was grilled prawns and steak. I tried some of her steak and it was perfectly juicy and tender. It also came with potatoes and rice. \n\nWe wanted to get dessert but had no room. Since it was our first time here, the waiter surprised us with their house-made ice cream. We couldn't tell the flavor but it was very nice on the palate. Kind of buterscotchy. \n\nWe definitely want to come back and try the lomo saltado.", "author": "Katie D."}

I was excited and we got the Chicharron De Calamares, Ceviche De Pescado, Empanadas, Chicharron Al Ajo, Lomo Saltado, Chupe De Camarones and Aji de Gallina. \n\nThe Calamares was done right. The right amount of crispiness and not too overcooked. It was easy to eat and the sauce was a great compliment.\n\nThe Ceviche Pescado was overdone, perhaps it was let to sit in the marinade a bit too long as it was \"overcooked\" and it was a bit on the sour side.\n\nThe Empanadas were very large, but the flavor was lacking. It was a bit bland, but still good as the crust was light and flaky.\n\nO Man Chicharron Al Ajo. My favorite appetizer of the night. The chicken was so tender and juicy. The chicken fried just right and the garlic, O the garlic....so delicious that after the chicken was done I was scooping it up to eat with the garnish on the sides.\n\nThe Chupe de camarones was  delicious. It's hard to describe it but here goes. It was thick but leaned on the watery side of thick, the flavor was somewhat familiar but could not put a finger on it and the soup, i believe the soup also had rice in it as well as small and big shrimps and bits of meat.\n\nMy another two of my favorites from the night was the Lomo Saltado and Aji de Gallina. The Lomo saltado had so much flavor, the sauce was so delicious and went well with the fries and rice. My only complaint was that the beef was a little tough but its lean steak so its understandable. Still loved it. \n\nThe Aji de Gallina was very delicious as well and definitely reminded me of curry. But this was so much better than curry, the super hot sauce went so well with the yellow sauce.\n\nAnd everything we had went well with their Chicha Morada, their Chicha Morada is as good as it gets, homemade, what else could you ask for? I would suggest taking out the ice as it dilutes it quite a bit.\n\nIf I did not have their empanadas and their ceviche not as overdone, it would have gotten 4.5 stars.", "author": "Reginald W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-24", "description": "After my first ever, albeit limited, foray into Peruvian food & drink, the girlfriend thought it would be a good time to expand this horizon some more. She proposed dinner at one of her favorite Peruvian (or any other cuisine, for that matter) places & exalted the flavors to be found there. Intrigued by the praises, I was game. So we were off & away from the tourist-y Piers to Bernal Heights . Mi Lindo Peru is itself as much a contrast to the loud, modern Peruvian bar we were just at as its neighborhood is to the Pier 1 1/2 location of that previous stop. Walking through the narrow door on the left of a bright, bold red-painted exterior, the inside, also painted red, offers a warm, homey feeling.\n \nArriving ahead of the dinner rush, we were seated immediately. Service was friendly & attentive. I began to survey the menu, but the girlfriend already had something specific in mind. She ordered & I awaited the food of her high acclaim. The wait was not long.\n \nOut came appetizers of Gambos al Ajillo (shrimp in butter/garlic sauce) & Papa aia Huancaina (potato in a spicy cheese sauce) along with bread, butter & salsa. The shrimp was simply awesome. With the aid of some of the bread, the plate was completely cleaned of all traces of the butter/garlic sauce.\n\nThis was not the only time the bread would be drenched & slathered in awesomeness, however. The salsa was crazy delicious with distinct, unique flavors I had never tasted before. Spreading butter & then salsa on top of that onto bread might sound odd, but just do it - awesome, really.\n\nThe cold-pressed potato in cheese sauce appetizer was good too, though the sauce didn't have the delicacy or complexity of a similar sauce at our previous Peruvian eatery. The version at Mi Lindo Peru was more home-style.\n\nTo wash down our food, the girlfriend had a glass of sangria. I thought I'd give Peruvian beer a try so I had a Cristal. The beer wasn't anything special, but I tried the girlfriend's sangria & that was definitely the way to go.\n\nNext came our entrees: Aji de Gallina (chicken in a creamy yellow sauce) & Lomo Saltado (beef strips on french fries). The beef strips & fries were good. In most other meals this dish would have been very well liked (& yeah, sure I still liked it enough), but this time it was completely overshadowed by the chicken in a yellow sauce of incredible flavors that I, yet again, had never tasted before. The sauce was reminiscent of a creamy Thai curry, but definitely with a Peruvian twist that was unlike anything I had ever tried before. Only a few bites were necessary to elevate this dish from unknown to one of my absolute favorites.\n\nI love this dish so much that I already went back with the girlfriend a 2nd time shortly after this 1st visit for more. We, again, got the Gambos al Ajillo, tried the Causa de Pollo (mashed potato stuffed chicken salad) which was quite yummy & of course, got 2 orders of Aji de Gallina (1 to eat & 1 to take home). We also took home a cup of the salsa.\n\nMi Lindo Peru has quickly become one of my favorite places to eat. It is indeed a rarity that a single restaurant would introduce me to this many previously not experienced, exquisite & superlative flavors. The feel is warm & homey. Service is excellent. Mi Lindo Peru really is as good as it gets.", "author": "John M."}

It obviously wasn't fried in a southern US style to which my gf and I were accustomed, but the Peruvian style allows for a lot of fried garlic and heavy amount of lemon sauce, as desired. \n\nThe cilantro rice with seafood was good but not great.

Three large tables of people sat cheek to jowl, chatting with each other, greeting new arrivals and generally Having A Good Time. \n\nI'm always astounded at how a small restaurant manages to pull off serving 35 (or so) hungry Yelpers without any major foul-ups. And Carlos and crew really *did* do this. The food just kept coming and coming...fish, rice, salsa...you name it, arrived fresh from the kitchen with nary a glitch. \n\nWe passed the plates around family style, putting food at Daniel L's place as he was dancing about taking his role as host *quite* seriously.

But he warned me the salsa would be spicy. I was like \"PSSSHH I'm Taiwanese I love spicy!\" And he was right, this does creep up on you..but its so good. You know how some spicy things can start to make you salivate ? Yea this salsa does that.\n\n-Fried Fish w/ Garlic - this was very very good. I dont know how else to explain this dish, its fried fish with lots of garlic on top. And its just really good.\n\n-Lomo Saltado - its like a mix of beef and french fries. I like this a lot too, seemed a bit funny but was quite tasty.\n\n- Fried Chicken - I can't say I enjoyed this one too much, kind of dry. everything else around it was good..like the sauce. I'll give it a shot again next time.\n\n-Saltado de Pollo - like the lomo but with chicken instead of beef. If I had to pick between the two, I'd stick with the beef but this is quite good for all those non beef eaters out there.\n\n- Potato sandwich thing - This thing was quite tasty. Not sure what it was called but Jason ordered it. Its a pretty small dish but its quite heavy so you wouldnt want to eat alot of it. What looks like bread slices is actually like flattened out mashed potato and between it was like chicken I believe..argh i dont remember but im going back to try that too.\n\n- Paella - very nicely done, the last time I had a good paella was at my friends place. But I'm sure paella is a piece of cake for Mi Lindo.\n\nThere were some dishes that I didnt get around to. But the way I see it, this event was kind of like a tasting and a way to get everyone together and have a good time. \n\nThanks again to Marti L. and Daniel L. for organizing this event.

All I knew was that in Peru they eat guinea pigs; which is pretty much like eating human children in my family.  Eat all the rabbits, squirrels, whatever you want, but guinea pigs?!  Anyway I digress...\n\nThere were no guinea pigs in all of the culinary creations served at our giant, U shaped, table maze of awesome Yelpers.\n\nThe service was top notch! They kept track of individual drink orders, water, checking in, quantity of food ordered, and big smiles!  \n\nFood seemed to just keep coming! Tasty bite after tasty bite.  I tried very hard to try everything so lets see how  I do:\n\nCeviche- Possibly my favorite ceviche I've ever had.  They fish was thick but not too thick, there were calamari rings and tiny shrimp in it too. The lime was prevalent but not over powering.\n\nFried Plantains with Sour Cream-I've never had this be bad in my life.  This continues that trend.\n\nCorn Rice with a stir fry of chicken and french fries, another had beef and french fries- Sound weird?  I though so too.  But much to my pleasant surprise, it was quite enjoyable.\n\nFried Fish with Garlic on Top- By far my FAVORITE dish and very popular.  And for good reason. Perfect frying is an art.  Mi Lindo Peru has that down.  With perfectly fried minced garlic topping, 4 or 5 orders disappeared in a flash.\n\nFried Chicken Wings-Not your typically over breaded fried chicken wings.

Hosted by lovely Marti and the gracious Daniel L--it was a super success!\n\nI'm sorry I didn't get to meet everyone but the warmth and friendliness abounded!  I did get to meet Ligaya, Yelp royalty--she is just one of the \"funnest\" people on Earth! She is also able to talk about any food or any subject!  I think we teased Earl's wife, Joyce, a little too much.  She mentioned that she was expecting in a couple of months and loved eating so we kept shoving plates in her direction.  She took it all in stride with such great humor, as if we were life long friends!  Also got to meet super Yelper Hen and several other Yelpers----what a treat to meet new folks!\n\nAnd great as always to see my buds, Tom R, Manabu, Dorothy and Peter!\n\nBefore I get to the food I have to mention that the service was perfect!\nCarlos and his staff were friendly and attentive.  As soon as emptied our many carafes of water they were refilled.  The plates of food came in a steady stream but not so fast that we felt rushed.  This is really a mark of a well run and organized restaurant.\n\nHubby and I shared a salad and two vegan dishes:\n\nPaella de Verduras (Saffron-flavored Spanish rice with vegetables)\n\nSaltado de vegetables (Sauteed onions. celery, carrots, mushrooms, tomatoes, french fries with seasoned rice.\n\nBoth are dishes were satisfying and huge!

There version of chicken fried steak i was excited for until I took th first few bites and realized it needed a sauce of some sort to help it down, I guess I just was not use to chicken fried steak not coming with a type of gravy. Their paella for me was a miss had a strong smell but average taste kinda lacked something, you know that feeling you get when you bite into something and hope every never ending in your mouth should get hit, sadly their paella did not do the job. The Pescado Al Ajo to me was the best thing on there menu by far bumped up the stars on my review fried red snapper with butter garlic sauce\n\nFish alone is not one of my favorite dishes but if it is made right I would go back again just for that dish, here fish was fried tender and flaky on the inside and on the out crisp to the crunch the sauce of course also helped, butter garlic you can taste on every bite meshed well with the white rice not so much the arroz con pollo or the paella. Yum definitely would head back just for there fish everything else don't think I would order again, I also tried to get their version of lamb shanks (Seco De Cordero) but they did not have any = (\n\nfood *** not super good just ok\nPescado Al Ajo ***** dam I can't say enough bout that red snapper\nprice $$\nambiance *** all red inside with decoration on the wall lil dark even during the day\ncustomer service **** they are very helpful and informative", "author": "Clarence A."}

The pops was pist. He had made reservations at Limon and we stood Limon up in favor of adding another kiddie to the dinner table.\n\nMi Lindo Peru turned out to be an even better choice than Limon. Mi Lindo Peru combines Peruvian and Spanish cuisine. Brother and I wanted Peruvian and the pops and I have a slight obsession with Spanish food. What can I say? We love our tapas, meat and potatoes.\n\nDinner consisted of Chicharron Al Ajo, Yucca Frita, Platano Frito, and two orders of Lomo Saltado. Empanadas were no longer available so we gnawed on the complimentary bread. Yes we got butter but we also got spicy salsa. Salsa on bread? HELL YEA! \n\nThe Chicharron Al Ajo came out shortly. They were the chicken nuggets Brother was bragging about. Small pieces of fried chicken with the crispiest skin you could ever imagine. They were covered (covered was an understatement) in minced garlic and when you dipped the chicken in the lemon sauce oh my god. Barbecue sauce and honey mustard have nothing on it. And if you love garlic, chicharron, and anything fried, this was IT. The yucca fries were denser than potatoes and very filling. The fried plantains balanced out the salt on the table. They were so sweet I could eat them for dessert. Plantains are always mandatory.\n\nThe Lomo Saltado plate was huge. I wondered why we ordered two and Brother explained the pops said he wanted his own. We all shared anyway and we were able to pack away all those lean and tender strips of beef. The slivers of lightly cooked onions and tomatoes were like fresh salsa for the dish. The beef also came with a pile of papas fritas and tasty white rice. It had everything from A-Z.\n\nMi Lindo Peru is not trendy nor packed. It's at the top of Mission far enough that there was plenty of parking available. Mi Lindo Peru is like eating at home. It's comfort food in epic proportions. And you can kick back and relax. \n\nThe pops was even ready to say, \"Oh sh*t son, this was hella good!\" Because it was.   \n\nThe pops left happy and even let the kiddies go to Mitchell's for dessert afterwards. \n\nThe end.", "author": "Rachel A."}

To be honest...ehhhh, a little over priced, portion size wasn't all that great, wasn't as tasty as I experienced back home in So Cal.\n\nBut then comes MI LINDO PERU. DAMNNNNNN their lomo saltado is FRICKIN AMAZING. Juicy  flavorful steak and nice thick crisp french fries. and the rice has flavor too! It's not just filler. the entire dish is amazing. as for portion size? You definitely get a nice FAT plate of good food. \n\nI didn't want to write a review until I tried some other dishes. Cuz let's face it, the default dish at a peruvian restaurant is the Lomo Saltado.\n\nAppetizers: Seafood Ceviche is a MUST!

If you're a fan of seafood and things citrus, you'll also be a fan of their ceviche.\n\nI'm also a big fan of curry and things spicy. So I checked out the Aji De Gallina. Steamed potatoes, shredded chicken, and a spicy yellow chili sauce served on a bed of rice. This is pretty damn good too and the amount of spice is just right. Just enough to heat up your tongue but not enough to make you sweat and grab a napkin to wipe that dripping snot off your nose.  \n\nAs for desserts. I can't say much, since Mitchell's ice cream is just a block away. My go to place for dessert. So if I ever have a craving for Mitchell's, i'll try my best to stop by this joint.

Mi Lindo definitely lived up the the reviews I read here before venturing out to try it.\n\nIncidentally, I will actually be in Peru in exactly two weeks after eating here so this might be an awesome rehearsal for what's in store there :D\n\n[soapbox] OK... so it's in the Mission, ON Mission.  So be prepared for parking woes (we lucked out with two incredible spots) - and PLEASE, don't ding the restaurant because you couldn't find parking.  I hate when people do this - how is this even remotely in the restaurant's control??? [/soapbox]\n\nCharming little restaurant, full of food smells - so awesome and welcoming!  I think this place can accommodate about 40 people tops but it's still very spacious and you get a lot of privacy even with all the coziness.  I never felt encroached upon by fellow diners.\n\nNice ambiance and decor (check out the light fixtures that look like seashells).  And the most amazing staff - so friendly, patient and ever so attentive to detail...  I had mentioned earlier on that I was allergic to shellfish and the waiter (I think he was also the owner perhaps) remembered (more later)\n\nWe ordered a small carafe of the sangria which was really good and sweet, with apples primarily.  It's nothing to write home about but it was a good smooth drink to accompany the meal.  They also brought out some fresh bread with butter and some hot salsa which was really tasty.\n\nWe started off with the Champinones Al Ajillo (mushrooms sauteed in a garlic sauce) and the Ceviche (red snapper  marinated in fresh lime juice).  Both were pretty substantial and both were delicious.  I loved the mushrooms - the garlic sauce was authoritative without being overwhelming.  The ceviche was just fantastic - so tangy and fresh... the fried corn was a great touch and added some awesome crunch to the raw fresh fish.  Very well executed dish!  A definite repeat.\n\nFor the main course, we just ordered one thing - the highly recommended Pescado Al Ajo - we got it steamed - red snapper topped with butter garlic sauce & a touch of white wine.  A pretty substantial portion, easily enough for two, comes with rice, potatoes and a small piece of lettuce and some tomatoes.  It was also delicious, the fish flaking easily and chock full of flavor.  Large pods of garlic complemented the flavor of the garlic butter sauce - again, a dish I'd readily repeat.\n\nNever felt rushed during the almost two hours we were there.  Again, extremely helpful and friendly staff - such a delightful little place - I love places like these that seem \"family-run\" and that take such pride in their food and their service.  End result was a most enjoyable evening and a guaranteed repeat customer.\n\n~ 5 stars overall - now, I have to compare this with real Peruvian food - look for a possible review update if one is called for :)\n\n# 232", "author": "Badri N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-23", "description": "This place has the all the potential to become a restaurant representing the best of peru. The menu is authentic and represents classic Peruvian flavors, ingredients, and cooking methodology.  However, mediocre service combined with unprofessional cooking makes me never want to come back.\n\nAll these 4- and 5-star reviewers clearly have little idea what great Peruvian food can be. There's at least 4 other Peruvian restaurants in the city that will blow your mind if you think this place is great.\n\nIt seemed like Lomo Saltado here is the most popular thing, and also the easiest dish to cook in Peruvian cuisine (you can do it a home, people, its just a slow stir fry of onions, tomatoes and seasoned beef). so for my first meal there, I wanted to try something that would really test the quality of the cooking.\n\nAji de gallina ($15) is a Peruvian classic dishes that, due to it's complexity, reveals both quality of ingredients and the chef's understanding of both stewing and saut\u00e9ing. The recipe calls for chicken, cheese, onion, cumin, garlic, and aji peppers -- all together incredibly difficult to balance, and clearly revealed a junior cook using mediocre ingredients. The milk and the cheese felt curdled and tart, instead of creamy and soft. The chicken was dry instead of tender. And the aji, didn't feel any of the signature pepper at all. Clearly, I was very disappointed.\n\nAs for the rest of my meal, nothing impressed me enough to come back for a second try.  Avoid the yucca huancaina ($6). The sauce is runny, lacking bite, the yucca under cooked. The flan ($6) was overly thick, and the caramel sauce lacked density.\n\nSkip the free bread. It resembles the large french loafs from the nearby Safeway. If you must have the bread, remove the innards, or risk pre-meal fullness.\n\nI don't usually care for presentation, but decor is uncoordinated. Photos, painting, and metal work evoking Old world heritage clashes with the acoustic tile ceiling, mirrors on columns, and plump kitty ceramic figures on a shelf near the register.", "author": "Jack Ian L."}

In fact, I propose that they change the name of the lomo saltado to beef lo mein, or beef with vegetables.

I had the ahi de gaillna and it resembled bad indian food. I am so blown away by the high rating since this is the WORST \"peruvian\" food I've ever had.

Mussels, Calamari, and Shrimp with Spicy Andian Yellow Chile stewed with a touch of Milk served with Seasoned Rice. I ordered it medium since I saw how spicy the bread salsa was but I figure I could have probably ordered it spicy because it had zero kick to it whatsoever. It was really yummy though! The seafood was really delicious, though I'm pretty sure it were frozen and not fresh. It just didn't have the fresh taste to it, but at these prices I'm not complaining. The sauce was delicious but definitely needed the spiciness.\n\nSeasoned Rice. With Corn. Came with the Seafood. It was alright, but seeing as I'm not a fan of rice, I'm probably not the best person to ask. I figured I should get rice because I hadn't eaten rice as carbs in awhile and I figured my body needed it. Heh.\n\nFried Plantain. With a side of Cream Cheese (I think.. that's what it tasted like). The plantains were pretty good and I'm so glad they weren't overly burnt. The cream cheese was a bit strange for me though maybe because I'm not used to it but I thought it was a bit weird. \n\nLucuma Ice Cream.

We ordered the ceviche de pescado (red snapper with lime juice) and the cangrejo con alcachofas (baked artichoke hearts, crab, and cheese served with crackers). Both were amazing, but the ceviche definitely stood out for us. \n\nFor main dishes I ordered the lomo saltado, which was as amazing and delicious as I remembered it, and my boyfriend ordered the arroz con pollo, which he loved and COMPLETELY devoured.

Carlos, the owner, is a friend of mine as well, so I would like to disclose that tidbit before I write this review.\n\nI came here tonight for Daniel L and Marti L's UYE party. Catering to roughly 30 ppl is not an easy task for both the host/hostess and the restaurant but the event went smoothly, the company was great, met a lot of people, and the food was fantastic. \n\nUsually when you get a bunch of people and order family style, you really can't get the essence of the food. The food is a lot better when the party is more intimate. You can then really appreciate the intense ingredients that is used in their dishes.\n\nNotable items:\n\nBelieve it or not, the bread and salsa is one of their highlights. \n\nOn weekdays they use this regular bread but on weekends they have this fresh baguette that is awesome with butter and their fresh home made salsa. The salsa is a creeper. It doesn't taste spicy in the beginning but once you get onto your third and fourth bites, it will hit you. I usually pass on bread because it is a filler, but I just can resist it here.\n\nArroz con pollo..............my favorite.  It looks and taste like a paella with chicken and pesto sauce.  Very fresh, vibrant and a rather light taste to a very heavy dish.\n\nFried fish with garlic........not on the menu but Carlos will hook it up.  Best descirbed by susan and philip........everything taste good when it is fried.  This dish however is very intensely infused with fried garlic.  The garlic is very strong and you will be smelling for a while.\n\nLomo saltado...........beef strips with french fries and rice. I know......sounds a little weird but it was great \n\nFried Chicken......love the fresh lime juice and pepper that it comes with \n\nPaella...............Awesome \n\nYou really can't go wrong with any of the dishes here. \n\nAgain. Great job Marti and Daniel for setting this up and thank you again for the dessert.  That was a great touch at the end of the night to give us gift cards to Mitchell's.  Mitchell's the ice cream parlor and not Mitchell's the one on Polk and O'farrell.  Although that would have been a better way to end the night.", "author": "jason g."}

The service was very friendly, attentive and fast. Now to the food: the arroz con pollo was great, with rich cilantro flavor. Amazing fried snapper covered with fried minced garlic. Lomo saltado: beef strips with French fries, rice and a lot of onions. Fried chicken with lemon flavor. A very rich paella. And, of course, delish  fried plantains for the final kick!

I have been to Peru and can definitely say that the food tasted \"authentic\" - except for the lack of Aji de Gallina (sp?) on the menu.  What's up with that?\n\nYou don't go there for the decor - it is clean, but trendy it is not.  The empanada is great - really flaky and moist crust and yummy beef inside.  We also ordered a side of plantanos which was good - but not as good as my mommy makes (sigh - can a west indian girl get some good plantains, already?!?).\n\nI had the Lomo Saltado which was excellent and much better ( and cheaper) than those at Limon and Fresca.  Tasted my friend's arroz con pollo and it was a bit bland.  \n\nPortions are huge so expect to take home a doggie bag.", "author": "Kamael S."}

Make sure you order the yucca and empanada.  They are only about $6, but well worth every cent.  The yucca comes with a cheese sauce that we ended up dipping the free bread into.  Delicious.  Empanadas sell out, so if you end up doing a late dinner, you may be SOL.  \n\nParking is a MF'ing pain here!

I could only eat a 1/4 of it because there was just so much.\n\nHubby got the lomo saltado which he loves. I had a bite of the meat and was surprised. Wasn't bad at all. \n\nWe saw as an appetizer they had french fries and hot dogs. for giggles we had to get it. Okay pretty simple concept and it was amusing to see the plate come out.

I really had no idea that Mi Lindo Peru was  getting rave reviews here on Yelp. \n\nFor starters, we ordered the Empanada de Carne, which was really good, but the Chicharron Al Ajo was great. Chicken wings are marinated in garlic and then fried and tossed with more garlic and served with a garlicky dipping sauce. Yeah, it's a lot of garlic, but it's not as strong as you might expect and it was an absolutely delicious appetizer. We also ordered some fried plantains that were beautiful and brown and caramelized all over.\n\nMy entree was the Bistek a la Pobre, a top sirloin steak that's sauteed w/ onions and tomatoes and then topped with a fried plantain and a perfect fried egg on a bed of fragrant rice. My wife ordered the Pollo Oregano, a half chicken roasted in oregano and served with the same delicious rice. It was really good and we ended up using the leftovers in some fried rice we made the next day. Sooj ordered a bistek dish similar to mine sans plantain and fried egg, which she loved. This is comfort food at its finest. Their sangria is also excellent.\n\nMi Lindo Peru is a great place to eat and the prices are reasonable. It's a small neighborhood restaurant with a laidback vibe, and if I lived in San Francisco, i'd definitely go there more often.

This food event consisted of the following line-up:\n1. Ferry Building\n2. Mi Lindo Peru\n3. Mission Pie\n\nBut having gained some extra pounds on Mom's cooking on my NY trip, I actually had to restrain myself during the Ferry Buildling portion of the event.  You have no idea how difficult this is to do around Arnold and Christel.  Here's a portion of our dialogue there:\nArnold [at Delica]: Wnat a roast beef sushi?\nMe: No\nChristel: Want some tofu?\nMe: No\nAfter Delica, Arnold: Do you want a Bombolini?\nMe: No\nArnold: Should we go look at Reciutti?\nMe: [Nothing, but thinking: why don't you just torture me instead]\nArnold: let's go look at Miette?\nMe: [thinking: Actually, just kill me instead]\n\nSo, after FINALLY getting to Mi Lindo Peru, we scanned the menu for appetizers.  \nArnold: Let's get the empanada.\nArnold: Let's get this [pointing to something else].\nChristel: Hey, hey, can the rest of us order?\nArnold: Sooj, didn't you want the ceviche?\nMe: I want the empanada.\nArnold: I thought you wanted the ceviche?\nMe: I've had to watch you guys eat for a whole hour.  I am starving.  Get me meat now.\n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the very large empanada and Chicarron al Ajo, this wonderfully crispy chicken covered with the tastiest garlic bits.  I could have a meal of just the empanadas and that finger-licking delicious garlicky chicken...oh, you must get it.\n\nFor the main course, I was really tempted to get the Bistek a la pobre, a sirloin steak along with an egg and plaintains.  But we had Mission Pie lined up, and i was afraid of not having enough room for the pie.  So, Arnold nicely suggested that we order a plaintain sideorder, which was the real temptation for me, and I order a regular plate of Bistek that comes with rice.  The plaintains were hearty (I know, not the usual word for plaintain, but these were large slices) and the Bistek plenty filling without the egg.  Although one of these days, I will starve myself for a whole day so I can get the Bistek a la pobre.  And the sangria is a lovely accompaniment to it all.\n\nAnd I must say it again: get that chicken!", "author": "Sooj O."}

But, what a wonderful way to experience Peruvian food for the first time. A relaxing dinner out with some friends & quality eats really tops the evening off. \n\nThe food, which was reminiscent of Spanish food was excellent! I ordered the Bisteck a lo Pobre: a Steak topped with an egg & onions served with rice, potatoes, and plantains. The portions are big & the combination of it all was very tasty! The plate was flavorful with all the right seasonings and my juicy steak was cooked to perfection. The cold sangria went well with the meal, although the small bits of fruit was a bit too mushy for me. They also serve bread with butter and salsa beforehand. \n\nService was great, and the waiter was very nice & helpful. No complaints about it! He even offered dessert, which I sadly had to turn down because I overstuffed myself. \n\nThe place is pretty clean, decent sized, and great for a date or dinner with a few friends. \n\nAs for the bathroom, kinda creepy the window was open & across from umm possibly the kitchen window? And it sort of smelled like pee, but the fact board told me \"It takes 50 muscles to swallow\" Okay pee smell I guess I kind of forgive you... \n\nI woke up the next morning a bit more smarter knowing about the 50 muscles & how delicious the Bisteck a lo Pobre is.

Can't decide?  Try Mi Lindo Peru, which seems to be straddling the two genres (or is on the way from the latter to the former).  It certainly has a family-run layout and menu, but the patrons look like spillover from Emmy's having a pre-Knockout dinner (or was that just us?).  The prices smack a bit of hipster tax, too (I was really tempted to dock a star for this, but I've finally realized that $15 is the new $10, and that I'm clearly on my way to becoming one of those old guys who like to mention what things cost 50 years ago). \n\nUnlike Fresca, which had its ups and downs, everything I tried here was great.  Both the sangria and chicha morada are must-drinks (you can get chicha morada to go at El Perol, by the way).  Fried yucca is the new french fries, especially with that amazing cream sauce.  And then there's the picante de mariscos, one of many delicious seafood-in-spicy-creamy-sauce-over-rice dishes to choose from.  There's also a decent selection of tapas if you want to go that way.", "author": "Wes M."}

Lets just say that I was not impressed with the entrees. I got the Saltado de pollo, which was basically a Asian-esk stir fry with french fries tossed in served over white rice. Not bad, but not great and lets face it just a bit strange. Josh got the arroz con pollo, which was a huge pile of bland cilantro fried rice. Overall it was a bit disappointing. I am leaving the stars as is because my first experience was so fabulous. I fully intend to return for tapas, apps, and of course the fried plantains. See below for the original review:\n\n    My friend and  are both on a budget, you know with the holidays and all, and we wanted to get a quick bite to eat before running a secret holiday mission. We decided to try this place out and to our surprise it was not only great but affordable as well. The portions are huge so despite the mid-range prices, if you are willing to share with a friend it is a steal.\n\n     The meal started with french bread and salsa. Unusual? Maybe. Tasty? Yes!!\n\n    We had the mixed ceviche, which strangely enough is cheaper than the fish ceviche, followed by chicken stuffed mashed potatoes, and of  course a side of fried plantains. \n\n    The ceviche was amazing, some of the best and most interesting that I have ever had. It was served with a chunk of potato and sweet potato as well as a small pile of what seemed to be some form of homemade corn nuts. Yum!\n\n    The mashed potato masterpiece can only be described as a chicken salad sandwich but instead of bread the chicken salad is placed between two completely smooth slabs of mashed potatoes and then topped with olives and a quarter of a hard cooked egg, which by the way didn't have a green ring. That in it's self is worth a star. I can't tell you how many high end, high priced places cannot hard cook an egg properly. This dish sounded so weird that we had to try it and it was well worth it. Although it was a bit strange it was more than a bit delicious.\n\n    We topped our meal off with a side of fried plantains. How can you go wrong? They were delicious. We only ordered tapas plates, sides and apps because we were not super hungry, but I totally look forward to trying out the entrees, which sound equally unique to me since I am just starting to explore Peruvian food. \n\nI'll keep you all posted!

So, my friend and I decided to order a few appetizers and share an entree.  \n\nFor our appetizer choices we opted for the Anticuchos, Causa, and the Ceviche Mixto. Everything was quite tasty.  But my favorite appetizer was the Ceviche Mixto.  It's a little pricey at $14 but I think it's worth the price for the seafood you get and the quality of the dish.  It was fresh tasting and contained a lot of seafood.  The Causa reminded me of a deconstructed chicken potato salad.  Its a mixture of mayonnaise and chicken sandwiched between steamed potatoes cut into two rectangles.  It's topped with eggs and olives.  The Anticuchos are beef hearts flavored with spices and served on skewers.  \n\nWe decided to go with the Tallarin Saltado for our entree.  I've had Lomo Saltado before and love it.  So, I wanted to try something a little different.  This entree is basically Lomo Saltado but substitute spaghetti for the rice and fries.  It was good but I think I prefer Lomo Saltado.  The dish however was well seasoned and the beef pieces were cooked well.  For $8.95 (at lunch) the portions were quite huge.  \n\nTo end our wonderful Peruvian meal, we decided to get a scoop of lucuma ice cream for dessert.  I'd never had this flavor of ice cream before and I loved it.  I would describe it as orange in color with a nutty taste.  \n\nThe servers here were really nice and attentive.

I would guestimate about 10 tables. The service is excellent. The staff are super nice and let my group enjoy ourselves to chat long after they have cleared our table. \n\nMy favorite on the menu is the fried Plantains. The ends are super crunchy and it did not taste like bananas at all. They have appetizers, soup & salads, Chicken, Beef, Tapas, and super delicious seafood. I absolutely love their homemade Sangria. It taste like a good mixture of red wine & juice. \n\nMy friends and I had the following:\n\nPaella Marinera - your traditional seafood Paella w/ saffron rice. It was pretty good but B44 does it better with the cast iron plates. \n\nArroz con Mariscos - peru's own paella. It was just ok. Taste like seafood mixed with rice. Pretty much the same as the Paella Marinera and I think the Paella Marinera is a little more flavorful.\n\nPescado al Ajo - Red snapper topped with butter & garlic. When they said topped with garlic they weren't kidding. The fish was loaded with garlic! It was really good though.\n\nLomo Saltado & Bisteck a lo Pobre. Between the two get the Bisteck a lo Pobre. They are pretty much the same dish except the Bisteck comes with fried Plantain and fried egg. The Bisteck is SOOO GOOOD.  Another difference between the two dish is that the Lomo is lean strips of beef while the Bisteck is top sirloin steak. Both are sauteed the same way with tomatos, onion, and french fries. Yes the dishes are sauteed with french fries! It gives it a unique flavor and so fun to eat!\n\nI would go back to Mi Lindo Peru just to eat the Bisteck a lo Pobre.\n\nFYI - majority of the dishes come with rice. Beware when you share because it's A LOT of rice. Another thing they don't take reservations after 7pm.", "author": "Terry D."}

I will only tell you to skip one item. . . the pollo al jerez. This plate looks like it would be awesome since it's chicken breast in a saffron and sherry wine sauce with potatoes, mushrooms and peas. . . but it's bland, has no flavor and I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nEverything else is good! \nThe soup is creamy and delicious with nice chunks of tender meat and noodles. Very comforting. \n\nThe saltados are all good!\nMy favorite is the seafood just because I love seafood. Medley of prawns, mini shrimp, mussles, clams, and calamari with some fries and a tasty sauce served with rice mixed with some corn. The chicken and beef saltado have fries and the tasty sauce as well. They can be a little salty but the rice compensates for it. \n\nThe bread and butter are ok but what makes it addicting is the salsa they put with it. I want a jar for personal use as I'm sure I would put it on everything. The sauce had chunks of onion, cilantro and other stuff in a spicy red sauce. I take the bread, butter it up and put a spoonful of the salsa. It's awesome and I would have it everyday if I could. \n\nDon't forget to start with some Inka Kola (taste like melted gum) or some chica morada (purple corn drink). \n\nThe plates are big enough for two or for lunch the next day if you have light to moderate appetite. You can eat the whole plate but you will need a nap I'm sure. \n\nThe staff is usually really good about explaining the menu if you've never had their food. They will give you recommendations and refill your water without asking. The bread you sometimes have to ask for though.

We ordered a half-liter of sangria (with ice, which doesn't bother me so much) and an empanada de carne for appetizer. The simplicity of the empanada really struck me, especially when I realized how delicious it was. Beef, black olives, and sauces and spices filled the pastry, and it was accompanied on the place by a simple mix of tomatoes, onions, and cilantro.\n\nFor the main, I ordered lomo saltado, which comes mixed with French fries. My god, South Americans know how to cook potatoes. Lomo is thin strips of beef, so the dish was visually appealing, too. The beef was a little tough, but not enough to discourage chewing. It tasted heavenly, and the alternation of bites ... well, writing about it next morning makes me want to eat it again, if that says anything.\n\nTara R., my dinner companion, ordered a bistek (the name escapes me at the moment), which is more of a steak-steak. Its taste blew the lomo away, and that's saying a lot. Just perfectly tenderized so that it really absorbs the spices and juices, and what a treat on the taste buds.\n\nThe prices are reasonable ($12 for most entrees), and, like many places in SF, the main drawback is the wait.

We had never had Peruvian food so we thought \"why not.\"\n\nWe ordered the fried chicken appetizer and the Lomo Saltados.  The fried chicken appetizer was bland.  The breading had no flavor at all.  I didn't like the dipping sauce because it was too sour for me but the wife liked it.  I really did like the very spicy salsa they served with bread in the beginning of the meal so I doused the chicken with that, even so the chicken still need to have salt in the breading.  Unless that's the way that it is supposed to be made, but I think that all cuisines use salt right?\n\nThe Lomo Saltados was very well spiced and seasoned and would have been a winner but the skirt steak was over cooked.  Skirt steak is a very finicky cut of beef and in order for it to be tender it really needs to be cooked perfectly.  Unless you are using \"USDA Prime\" or it's equivalent, when dining in other countries, the margin for error with this cut is zero.  The skirt steak was at Mi Lindo was a little bit over cooked making it chewy.  \n\nPrices were definitely on the high side as well.  For what you get it's not a value.  Skirt steak is one of the cheapest cuts of beef, rice, potatoes, and the occasional vegetable make up the Lomo Saltados and to charge 14.95 for the dish you really have to make it perfectly, or have amazing ambiance, or amazing service, or all three.  However that was not the case.  Even if I was in the area I wouldn't go back.\n\nAll in all we spent around 35 bucks for 2 beers fried chicken appetizer and a cheap beef entree with rice and potatoes.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

He ordered the lomo Saltado and he also thought it was just ok. I ordered Tallarin Saltado de Pollo ew! It tasted like vinegar and it was super salty ! Couldn't finish and I obviously didn't take the rest home. We also ordered papa a la huancaina that was bland. \nWhat a disappointment! Ive been in SF for a year and still can't find a decent Peruvian restaurant! Nothing like So Cal! :/", "author": "Anali V."}

We went to Perol (I think it was)  for a while until they closed :( Best Panes con chicharron I ever had.

I always knew that Ponce de Leon and Hernan Cortez had nothing on me and Mi Lindo Peru is my crowning achievement in discoveries!\n\nI have gone up and down, Destino, Fresca at Fillmore, and an arrogant Essencia. Mi Lindo Peru takes them all and shows them how Peruvian is done. Now let's hear to what my reviewers, \"The Ambiguously Garcia Duo\" have to say:\n\nMLP's 'ceviche de pescado' is simply drenched in splendor and the fish is so delicious, we wanted to get naked and rub it all over us, but that is just to get you going. We must also squirm in such delightful maritime wetness with a nice sangria and why not, an Inca Kola. However, just when you think you had the best girl / guy in the ceremonial Machu Picchu orgy, the stunning Lomo shows up and things get interesting. The way they make their food is REAL, is how it is done. If you are a 'health nut' or a hippie vegan or a 'had sex with a spanish girl/guy so i know all about spanish culture now' person...walk away, go to Destino, while very good, it is safe for 'your kind'... *wink*.

I have them on my new hi-def display at home...you should come over\"\n\n\"Oh sure Bob, you are sooo cultured, I want to have sex with you over the llama skin your purchased\"\n\nNo, no pretentious pompous people here! This is heaven for us!!!! Also, make room for the flan. It's probably one of the best in the city.

I followed other reviewers and we got the beef saltado, the seafood (mariscos) and chicken saltado spaghetti along with fried calamari and mixed ceviche appetizers. The ceviche had a very tangy juice but the seafood all seemed bland. The only way I can think this is possible is if the seafood was pre boiled or steamed then added to the ceviche juice. The fish had the most flavor. The squid, mussels, shrimp...bleh and meh. I think its pretty impossible to start a ceviche raw (the correct way) in the acidic juices and not have the seafood absorb the flavor  The fried calamari was lightly breaded and had a slight crisp which is fine, though I do prefer more crunch myself. The aioli was just mayo and ketchup. No garlic. The saltados were both under seasoned and cooked to death. Their descriptions mentioned some sort of special herbs and seasoning. It was nowhere to be tasted. The spaghetties had no special sauce. Just oil and salt n pepp. I hate to say it but I think the salsa was the highlight. It came with the free bread and butter.

When you sit down they give you a bread basket with butter and this really delicious salsa. The salsa isn't too spicy but if you like onions, you will definitely like it.  I went with a friend and we ordered the 1/2 liter sangria. This was hands down one of the best sangrias I have ever had. It was sweet but not too sweet and the fruit was actually really tasty, so much so you wanted to actually eat it after drinking the wine. For an appetizer we ordered the calamari. The calamari was SO GOOD. I usually am not a big fan of calamari but my friend loves it so we decided to try it. Needless to say, I passed on the little pieces with tentacles (ew), but really good nonetheless. It came with a little mayo type dipping sauce which had a mild spice to it. For our entrees we ordered the arroz con pollo and the saltado de pollo. The arroz con pollo was really different, it was rice with chicken sauteed in a cilantro sauce. It almost tasted like an Indian chutney was doused all over it. The chicken in the dish was really tender and overall I liked this dish a lot. The saltado de pollo was good, but it definitely was not as good as the dish I had at Isabella's in San Jose. The chicken was a little on the dry side and there wasn't much sauce. I really like it when there's a lot of sauce with the chicken. We asked for a side of hot sauce, which was really spicy. If you can't handle spice I wouldn't ask for it :) The hot sauce gave the saltado de pollo a little bit more flavor. The service was good, whenever we asked for something we got it right away.

And I must admit, even though I hardly eat meat, this shit was great. Juicy med-rare steak, plantains, potato chunks, rice and fried egg on top, with a cilantro herb sauce (hold the cilantro if you don't like cilantro like me) you must try it.\n\nWe family styled everything...definitely try the empanadas as an appetizer, we also ordered chicken saltados, avocado salad, seafood paella, and don't forget the SANGRIA. The best sangria I've had (personally I think it's better than ChaChaCha's) with perfect amount of crushed ice, lil chunks of fruit and oh so delish.  We had to top it off with Peruvian ice cream because we've never tried, but it was a little strange for my taste buds - the flavor reminded me of chai tea and the mouthfeel was slightly gritty. Probably wouldn't order the ice cream again, but it was worth the try.\n\nOverall, very comfy casual atmosphere with excellent service. Prices very reasonable. Parking around the mission sucks ass, but nothing can be perfect.\n\nGO...NOW!", "author": "Angela L."}

You want to try something fun, something good, something different, but you know most popular restaurants require reservations and it's a bit late to start calling at 7:30 pm when you want to start eating at 7:30 pm.  So my boyfriend and I relied on good ol' Yelp and picked Mi Lindo Peru to try.  Great reviews and doesn't take reservations!\n\nThe place is not glamorous.  It's like a little local mama n papa restaurant with not so many tables and plenty of space.   People took their time to eat and sat around despite the crowd building up near the door.  There is no list to sign, but catch the waitress' eyes and she'll remember you are next.  \n\nThey probably should've invested in more 2-person tables rather than 4-person tables, because a lot of diners (at least on a Friday) seem to be on dates.  But the wait staff is in no hurry.  Contrary to a lot of typical busy restaurants, they were more into taking care of the seated diners than to seat the people waiting as quickly as possible.  You will enjoy that kind of attentive and pleasant service when you are the seated ones, but probably will feel hungry and impatient as the latter kinds. \n\nWe ordered steak, paella and a side of plantains.   The bread came with butter and some salsa-like hot sauce.  Pretty tasty, but pretty hot!  My boyfriend loved the steak.  Thought it was extremely tender and juicy and the best he's had in a long time.  My paella was also very tasty, came in an enormous quantity with generous amount of seafood.  We both couldn't finish our dishes and had to take them home.  They make excellent left-over the next day, by the way. \n\nMi Lindo Peru is not a restaurant with extravagant decoration or romantic ambiance, but it has solid food with fair prices.   We will probably come back again pretty soon.", "author": "Candice B."}

The red snapper was also yummy, we really enjoyed their version of curtido, picked onion.

Having arrived at 4:30, and 30 minutes before the restaurant opened, we strolled to the corner where we found a local bar, Club 3360.  Colorful Mission Street dive but the beers @ $4 each during happy hour were a little higher than I thought they should be.  \n\nAt 5P, we left the bar and walked to MLP.  The two of us love to eat early.  Good food makes a restaurant popular.  Popularity makes a restaurant noisy.  We think 5-6P is the perfect time to get good food at a popular restaurant without all the noise.  Additionally, the restaurant staff is delighted to see us at a time when there are so few patrons.  \n\n\"What's your signature beef entr\u00e9e?\", I asked the waitress.    She replied that we might like to try the Bisteck a Lo Pobre, a sirloin steak sauteed w/ onions & tomatoes topped w/ fried plantain & egg.  Between the two of us, we ordered the above entr\u00e9e for one, the anticucho appetizer (marinated beef on skewers), the spicy tomato spaghetti soup, and lastly plantains tapas.  Gena had water and I ordered a glass of sangria.  \n\nWe got off to a good start; the bread came out with butter.  Gena gets annoyed when the restaurant doesn't bring butter with the bread.  In addition, the bread came with a thicker than usual salsa which was spectacular; different in flavor from other salsas we have gotten at other So American/Mexican restaurants.  No chips.  \n\nConsistent with reviews below, the anticucho was very nice.  Nicely marinated and cooked the way we like, medium rare. \n\nAlthough \"spaghetti\" does not sound terribly Peruvian, the soup was delightfully spicy.  Knowing that there were two of us, the restaurant smartly split a single portion into two bowls.  It always confounds me why more restaurants don't do this for couples who cannot or do not want to eat to excess.  Many of us dine for the experience.  The offer of such a simple extra service will invariably be reflected in the tip.  \n\nThe Bisteck entr\u00e9e was tasty and generously portioned.  So much for not eating to excess.  The extra side of plantains were as good as dessert if not better.  Not too sweet. Not too filling.  The sangria was in a medium sized glass with bits of apple, which I found to be a refreshing touch.  \n\nThe bill before tip came to $49, a fair amount to pay for good food and friendly service.  With all the great choices to dine in the Bay Area, it is rare that Gena and I will go to the same eatery twice.  ML Peru however is definitely a place that we can return.", "author": "Matt G."}

You heard it here first. That acronym is mine. Bucky Created The MiSOCC or BuCT MiSSOC.... \nI call this area a culinary haven, because you can get great food at an incredibly reasonable price. And Mi Lindo is no exception to this rule. Every time we go we end up spending about 30 dollars and that includes sangria and a beer, AND we always have leftovers. the portions are pretty sizable here. This doesn't apply to their tapas obviously, but when their entrees arrive it is almost embarrassing when they drop that large steaming plate in front of you. I mostly stick to their version of fried rice that has rice, egg, and peas in it. Cusqueno is the perfect accompaniment to that...mmmmmm. Service is always good and on most nights there is a small line for a table. A great addition to the MiSOCC!", "author": "Bucky K."}

Mine wasn't \"too salty\" like other reviewers said. I could eat the ceviche from this place all day.\n\nThe paella de mariscos is a little \"dry\" (which is a relative term, I guess), and I wish there were more clams in it, but the flavors are all there. I wish they would add some spice to their paella, like Fresca does, but like I said, delicious nonetheless.\n\nBeware, though.

I'm talking authentic Peruvian comida every night.  It's not likely any Peruvian eatery is going to impress these taste buds.  But while on a business trip to SF, CA a few years ago down by the Marina district something caught my eye while walking down the sidewalk.  Mi Lindo Peru.  Wow.  Okay, I had to go in and check it out.  Well, long story short- I was so blown away with their Lomo Saltado I called my wife back in Texas on the spot.  I started reading the menu to her and realized I was torturing her rather than having her share in my excitement.  Lets get real, there are no Peruvian restaurants in Austin, Texas worth speaking about.  That was then and this is now.  That location closed and moved down below the Mission district.  On my last visit, I rode the Bart and walked several blocks in unfamiliar territory- all for a Cusquena and Lomo Saltado.  I turned a corner and Viola!  There it was, with a new sign and everything.  Slightly larger area and the food was oh so excellent- even mama Rosa would have been impressed back in Lima.  Now- they don't know me from Adam, but I know them.  I'm a fan and I tell 'em everytime I visit- that someone in Texas loves them.  I'll be there again in late May 2010.  Maybe I'll get papas a la Huancaina or cicha morada or... hmmm.

If a restaurant is going to serve Ceviche they must do it right or don't offer it at all as I was disgusted with the poor excuse for Ceviche they presented to me. I honestly have had better Ceviche from a white girl who read it off a recipe website than this place and that is saying a lot. I will try out more Peruvian Ceviche restaurants in SF but this place gives the worst excuse for Ceviche and should rethink their recipe as what they presented was not Ceviche at all and if anyone begs to differ then you have honestly not tried authentic Ceviche and as a Peruvian I find this as an insult that anyone would even present me flavorless Ceviche.", "author": "Anthony S."}

Now, I am half Peruvian, so of course I believe I am an expert in this matter.\n\nWe were all really excited, Mi Lindo was to be my first Peruvian tasting on the west coast as well, and it seemed to be more authentic than the other restaurants that matched similar search queries.\n\nMy friends let me do all the ordering, and I knew exactly what we wanted.\n\nTwo Cusquenas (I prefer it over Cristal) and an Inka Cola.  (My girlfriend does not drink)  Inka Cola however, is my favorite soda, and I would like to mention that they have the real one, not the Ecuadorian version that has less flavor.\n\nTo start, I ordered the Ceviche Mariscos (Mixte), Papas a la Huancaina, and the beef anticuchos.\n\nThe Ceviche was top notch, great flavor, the best I've had in the US.\n\nThe Anticuchos, which are basically beef hearts on a stick, also had the exact flavor that I remembered from Peru.  Very tasty, very tender.\n\nThe Papas a la Huancaina were ok, My father makes the sauce much better.\n\nAt this point we order three Lomo Saltados, as it IS a dish descended from above, and decided we better order some more ceviche as well, it was just that good.\n\nOut came the Lomo Saltado, my dining mates ooh'd and awed, it was a perfect moment.\n\nOf course they loved it.

If you want to have pretty close to home-cooked food from Peru, then, pack everyone in the car and head to Mi Lindo Peru. Nestled along Mission Street's Bernal Heights neighborhood, this place offers traditional Peruvian cuisine (and some Spanish cuisine as well). Being from Peru, I only come here for \"my food\". For those on a first visit, for appetizers, stick with Papa a la Huancaina -- delicious potatoes on a bed of lettuce in a sauce that is not hot (like it is supposed to be) but creamy and delictable nonetheless. Also, try the Causa Limena -- cold mashed pototoes (they ARE good like this) sandwiches seafood and avocado --- mmm, mmm, delicioso!  If you want to really taste Peru, ask for their Anticuchos - cubed beef on a skewer. The meat is perfectly seasoned with a blend of new mexico chile and other spices; indeed, the meat seems to melt in your mouth. \n       For dinner, the  Lomo Saltado (pan fried beef strips in herbs and spices, mixed with french fries) is served alongside some of the best rice you have ever tasted. This is Peru and as traditional as you can get without boarding a plane. It is served in large portions and steaming hot. If you are still hungry after all this, ask for a cup of joe and an \"Alfajor\" - the best cookie you will ever have in your life. Period. Oh yes, during dinner don't forget to ask for Inka Cola - tastes like bubblegum soda, but it is really good. The restaurant is not very large but it's worth the wait. The service is spotty at times but that is because there is usually only two people serving so many diners at once. In any case, they are excellent folks once you flag them over.

It was great, don't get me wrong, but I wanted to get the flavor of what I was eating in my time south of the Equator, so we'll move on to the Lomo Saltado, which is ubiquitous in Per\u00fa. First thing right off the bat was that it was different tasting carne then the real thing (I ate it at least once every other day), not in a bad way, just different. Also, it wasn't spiced as strongly, which is no fault of the materials available, just a fault of the chef. It was still really good, and I will return, but to get that authentic Lomo Saltado flavor that I enjoyed so often down South, I think I'll just try cooking it myself.

I have never had a better Peruvian experience other than the restaurants I visited while in Peru. The place is small and has a very inviting atomsphere. It's very casual so no need to dress in your Sunday best. If you're into appetizers make sure to order Papas la Huancaina (a cold potato dish served in a spicy sauce, olives, lettuce and eggs) and  Prawns with garlic sauce. Yummy. As a main course, Lomo/Pollo Saltado is always a winner and the sea food soup one of the best I've tried. Wash it all down with Sangria. I'm a fan of deserts especially those from other places so try the Lucuma ( a native Peruvian fruit) ice cream. Great food, great prices and Awsome service. Thanks for reading.

In fact, I was just there on Wednesday. The restaurant is family-owned and operated. When I was a regular (several times a month), the son always new my order. Since I'm not as frequent a visitor, seems he's forgotten my face. :(  My favorite appetizer is the calamari. It comes with a delicious onion-type salsa. My favorite dishes are the saltado varieties--pollo, lomo, pescado--sauteed meat with onions, tomatoes, and potatoes with rice and corn. Oh, and the bread along with the spicy red sauce is a keeper as well!", "author": "Felicia P."}

But if you wanna go, we're leaving now.\"  I hopped out of bed and put on some clothes I wore yesterday (glad no one noticed), and dashed to the car.  It was raining outside, so I had to grab my jacket.  Found that Wong would be driving us in his Jetta.  I offered to drive, but he really wanted to drive.  And he needed to get gas.  So, we conceded.  Along the way, my brother realizes we have to pick up Mike as well.  Hmm, we'll have to pack some of this stuff in the back seat in the car, but, no problem.  Then, we miss the Avalon Dr. exit, which is the one to take to get  cheap gas on Westborough.  Oh well, guess we'll just fill up at the Hickey exit.  We get gas, then drive over to Mike's.  By now, Len, Lars, and Yian have already gotten a table at Mi Lindo's.  Doh!  So we're already 20 minutes late.  Then at Mike's, Fran enters the car... err, where's Mike?  He pops in a minute later.  Crap... 5 people in a Jetta.  Not comfortable, to say the least.  Oh well... note to self: don't let Wong drive next time.  \n\nFortunately, we get there in pretty good time, not too much traffic up to the Cesar Chavez exit, and lucked out on some street parking just 2 blocks away.\n\nFirst thing I thought as I entered the place was: wow, this place is tinier than I thought.  Fortunately, it wasn't very crowded at 8pm on that rainy Saturday night.  Our mates had already ordered some Ceviche de Pescado, which was very tasty, with a tad of lemony sour kick to it.  The bread on the table sated any hunger pains that might be due to eating as late as 8.  The fried plantains were nice.  I ordered the Lomo Saltado (salted strips of steak cooked with tomatoes, onions, french fries and served with rice).  I have to say, I didn't know this was what Peruvian food was about.  It was sorta like Chinese or Vietnamese rice plates, but cooked differently.  The Lomo was delicious - I finished every single bite.  There happened to be a serendipitously appropriate ratio of rice to entree in every bite.  The slices of meat were chosen selectly and cooked to a juicy tenderness.  Only $12.  Len had the Lomo a lo pobre - that looked like an excellent choice as well, topped with an egg cooked overeasy.  Yian ordered the green fried rice - green from a barely detectable silantro sauce, but oh-so-gobbleable.\n\nAlso had the flan, but I found it a bit thick for my taste.  I might try their special ice cream next time (yes, I will be back!).  In fact, I really hope to return, I found the food very unpretentious and satisfying - ie, most excellent grub!  4 stars ****\n\nPS, luckily for the group, Larry's car could take another, so we could split up our full selves 4 to a car (instead of 5), and so the ride back was much less cramped.  What a relief.", "author": "Gerald C."}

On my never ending quest for the ultimate Lomo Saltado, I ended up here one Thursday night (yelping night).  We ordered the empanada which was very good, flaky, and juicy seasoned ground beef, and some tangy sliced onions which I am told is a staple of Peruvian cuisine.  The atmosphere isn't that great, but it's the mission, and I don't really care about atmosphere.  The Lomo Saltado definitely was tasty but it was not perfect.  The meat was very good, tender, and juicy.  The rice was not sticky rice like I am used to (or I at least prefer it sticky, I'm not sure of the true traditional Peruvian way), and it had corn in it.  The rice can really make this meal, and I found it to be too light and tasted like it was made in a huge batch.  The dish was good overall, but the major problem that I had was that there was not enough sauce or juice in the dish.  I prefer there to be more stock/wine/soy sauce so that you can dip the rice and onion and fries and steak into it.  Otherwise it was very good, I give it a four stars, I'm just rather neurotic when it comes to this dish, because it happens to be my favorite. \n\nThis place has good beer selection, and a good location, definitely a return visit and a recommendation for anyone interested.", "author": "Tom O."}

Peruvian restaurants are becoming trendy, but most are so expensive that I feel that I'm paying for the boring, minimalistic decor. Mi Lindo Peru may not have the greatest interior design either, but without putting on airs it offers heartier portions, the menu spells ceviche correctly, and the place overall feels cozy. You can kick back and enjoy genuine Peruvian food without the high-pressure attitude of some other places. Down with $20 plates of ceviche that you can gobble in several forkfuls! Mi Lindo Peru instead gives you a giant, full plate of succulent, lime-soaked seafood. The staff is so nice. Great sangria and lucuma ice cream too.", "author": "elsa m."}

The decor is not great but it feels like you are in someone's kitchen or house. There was plenty of seating even at 8pm on a Friday, no wait, no hoopla. Sangria was pretty good yum!

It always takes me at least couple of tries around the area, maybe in the 4 block radius, before I find parking. I don't mind going round and round though, because when I crave Mi Lindo Peru, I don't care if I use up all my gas finding parking! With the current gas prices, THAT'S saying something!\n\nThis is a little restaurant with a very \"feel at home\" atmosphere. The service is great, the food is amazing, and the prices are reasonable. You start with complimentary bread and salsa, and we can sit there all night just eating those.  However, my favorite appetizer is the CHORROS A LA CRIOLLE (mussels with lots of onions and cilantro, with a spritz of lime - and i hope i spelled that right), and my boyfriend's fave appetizer is the CHICHARON DE POLLO, which is little fried chickens.  My boyfriend would turn that into a KFC-type Bucket of chicken if he could!  We've also tried the CEVICHE, and that was heavenly! I was speechless after trying that. All you can hear from me was, \"mmm... mmm... mmm...\" after every bite.  My fave dish is Lomo Saltado (no tomato though, I hate tomato, then I ask if I can have a side of fried egg on it... THE BEST!)  and my boyfriend's fave, Pescado Saltado. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu. They're all very delicious!  Especially the SANGRIA. I can have liters and liters of that, but I heard that's not good for my health... hehehe *shifty*\n\nAnd best of all, the owner is cute! I love \"C\"! He's cute, funny, and he used to personally deliver at our work, even though they didn't have delivery! It's because my coworkers and I used to order from them a lot, and we've had many get togethers at the restaurant. Now THAT'S customer service!", "author": "L O."}

The halibut ceviche was remarkable, my kudos to that. And service was sweet, very humble yet efficient, made us feel like familia.

Mayonnaise was on heavy feature (really? Peru? i need to refresh my geography but i've not encountered that before in this cuisine) which limited my \"wish list\" of menu items (ok, i can't dock them stars for my mayonnaise gag reflex, but i'll mention it in case you are my twin of tongue :) That said, the setting is homey, small enough to feel intimate and it did us well as a spot for collecting \"all the latest\" while getting our garlic breathe on..

When I returned a few weeks ago wanting to re-live my Peru adventure, it was with those mouthwatering memories in mind. Sadly, much has changed about Mi Lindo Peru during my hiatus from the eatery. First things first, it seems that the restaurant has tried to \"upscale-ify\" itself. This is reflected not only in the decor, but also in the prices. Second, despite the prices having gone up, the portion size has gone down! Blasphemy! Luckily for me, the lomo saltado (pictured below, right) still tasted as delicious as before... there was just less of it to devour. The ceviche mixto (picture below, left), is very citrus-tangy, and refreshing in small quantities. They actually give you quite a bit of seafood... but my dining partner and I ended up leaving about 1/4 to a 1/3 of of it untouched. We also ordered a steamed snapper... but unfortunately, it was bland, and definitely the worst tasting dish of the night. I would not order it again. I will probably be returning to Mi Lindo Peru when I want to revisit Peru memories... and I'll be ordering the lomo saltado.", "author": "Susanna W."}

Her cold ceviche was infused with such a juicy and sour lime sauce that I didn't know how to react. I wasn't prepared for this. I had to react quickly. Fight or flee. I chose to eat. I detest sushi and all that is raw or rare in meats, and yet her ceviche seduced me like a 14 year old boy to Mary Kay Laturno. After that round, she fed me her succulant lomo saltado. One bite and I was hooked. No more lonely nights. This was the one. Fillet's of strip steak well-cooked to perfection along with fried plaintain's of the highest quality, neither too sweet nor salty. Next, I moved on to her beef pobre steak with fritas. Say that three times out loud. The only item I didn't like was her arroz con pollo. Maybe because she offered this to every other guy as her signature entree, it didn't really do it for me. Dry, like it had been let out to graze. Luckily, to top it all off, I had some of her seafood paella to round out my experience, infused with what tasted like Brazilian spices and Japanese soy sauce. Oooooo, I didn't know she was a mix.

We always order that shrimp chowder (drool) which is so rich and full of flavor that we use the bread to sop up the bits we cannot pick up with our spoons (because licking the bowls would be embarrassing).  One order can feed 4 people easily, so bring some friends to restrain yourself from filling up too quickly.  We also order the frequently ordered chicken dish and ceviche.  And to wash it down, we get the sangria.  Just in case you have left over sangria (because we aren't big drinkers), ask for it to go.  It makes for a wonderful sauce when cooking beef.  Just  use it to deglaze the pan that you cooked your meat in, reduce it on a high flame, add a little salt and pepper, and there you have a wonderful sauce.", "author": "John L."}

We ordered both types of ceviche (just to cover all the bases) and they were superb. Fresh, with diverse flavors, not mushy and all mixed up, I wonder how they do that ? \"Now calamari, you stay away from those shrimp while you're marinating together\" who cares, it's great. Shrimp chowder was a bit rich for me, but amazing still. My companions had a mixed seafood soup and \"Zarzuelo\", another mixed seafood dish. Both looked satisfied and were full of praise. One thing, oh two things actually - one, the waitress dropped lots of stuff while we were there, one wine bottle (broke on the tile floor) and a plate of Peruvian spagetti (on a dude's lap), it was really entertaining, though I doubt she did it for our benefit. The second thing is that there was this guy in there who must have weighed 500 lbs, and there was some stuff growing on the back of his neck (I'm serious), that was entertaining too. OK, I'll come out and say it, this place -approaches- the goodness of Shalimar, without the pools of oil on top or the pigeons (ew !). Four stars on the first visit, maybe more next time.", "author": "Fattfreddie F."}

They bring you out soft bread and a spicy concoction to lather on top... good but hot!  We ordered some fried plantains and it's really hard to go wrong there... I'm a sucker.  I wanted something a little lighter so I tried a soup, which was full of calamari, clams, mussels, and white fish.  The cilantro broth was what really got me but when it came out, it just wasn't all that great.  The broth was a little too bland so the clams and mussels tasted fishy and it was overall pretty flavorless.  The little bro got the Lomo Saltado, which was a really tasty heap of seasoned sliced beef, onions, french fries, rice and tomatoes.  Probably should have done my Yelpwork beforehand.  The ambiance was also pretty non-existent, especially when they turned the music off b/c there were only 2 tables left in the joint.  No me pareci gran cosa... but with all the great reviews, I might give it another chance.", "author": "Tara G."}

The choir preaches loudly about the Lomo Saltado and rightfully so...it can possibly be too much on a plate with a heap of onions and the strips of beef on a bed of rice. The mustard/ochre wall color highlights what may be a festive yet earthy dining atmosphere, but it was pretty quiet on a recent early evening visit. Their menu is basically seafood, steak, starches & sangria but upon closer inspection, one will find a vegetarian spaghetti dish that includes peas, carrots, mushrooms & onions and a few veggie plates on the tapas side. The tapas menu almost dwarfs the regular menu. The Mar y Tierra's ribeye is cooked to specs but my order turned out a little overdone, but still tender. The plate included a refreshing, zesty side of sliced onions & diced tomatoes, a few thick slices of fried potatoes and the nicely charred grilled prawns in a half shell. Nothing sensational, but it was all todos for me, hombre.", "author": "Chris C."}

Juicy, generous, oniony, with two perfectly fried little potato chunks on the side.  A steaming mass of rice that's perfectly done all the time.  It's awesome, more than awesome...

Just went there for the first time with my husband and a couple of good friends who introduced us to Mi Lindo Peru. The sangria is EXCELLENT. I had the Pescado Saltado - scary that I ate the entire plateful of food. They are super generous with portions and the service is excellent - quick and friendly. We were seated very quickly, probably because we got there early, around 6:30p on a Saturday night. By about 7:30p or so, there was a line out the door on the sidewalk. It was a rainy wet night but people didn't seem to mind the wait. Excellent experience. We are looking for an excuse to go there again and leave the kids at home!", "author": "Jo A."}

I will go here just for their delicious fried rice - I think the secret ingredient is crack, but who knows?  I really love all their tapas too. I usually go for that rather than an entree but my husband always gets the steak and he is forced to share.  Their yucca fries are great and its a meal that always pleases and is easy on the wallet.  The staff is friendly and their sangria does not skimp on the alcohol so be warned....eat more rice I say...", "author": "Kristina C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-27", "description": "I read a review for Peruvian restaurants in the New York Times so I decided to try some.  I asked a friend and he recommended mi lindo peru.  My girlfriend and I visited this place on Friday and night and enjoyed it.  It is a quaint restaurant with seating for about 30 people.  We waited by the front door for 10 minutes for seating.  When we sat down the wait staff was very helpful and friendly, they even spoke spanish.  My girlfriend ordered the sangria, which I tried and I was pleasantly surprised.  It tasted mildly sweet, and even slightly bitter.  I liked it.  For appetizers we ordered the calamari and the salchipapas.  The calamari was average, slightly bland, I would have enjoyed more spices.  The salchipapas was excellent, hot dogs with fries.  The hot dogs were cooked differently from american hot dogs, similar to bacon.  For an entree we ordered lomo saltado.  The dish came with rice and fries, and I loved it.  The dish also came with tomatoes and onions and the meat was cooked perfectly with great spices.  We also ordered alfajaro for dessert and I enjoyed it.  It was caramel sandwiched between two cookies and coated with sugar.  The caramel was above average, but I think the cookies overrode the caramel.  Overall, I enjoyed the restaurant and the experience.  I would definitely return.", "author": "Kevin W."}
