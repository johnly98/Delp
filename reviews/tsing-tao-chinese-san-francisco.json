Being that for some strange reason, most restaurants in San Francisco seem to close early, options are quite limited. After hopping around to a couple of closed establishments, I luckily stumbled across Tsing Tao and had 30 minutes to spare before they closed their doors for the night too.\n\nI was quickly directed to choose any seat I wanted. The place was empty so I had first pickings. \n\nThe menu looked pretty standard. There were the regular basic dishes you would normally see at any Chinese restaurant. We decided to go with Happy Family and Foil Chicken Appetizer. Both were good and filling. Hot tea was served alongside our meal. Service was efficient and attentive despite leaning towards the closing hours, which was much appreciated. Service goes a long way and they were able to deliver.\n\nLocated next to Legion of Honor Museum in a quiet neighborhood, this restaurant pushes out towards Ocean Beach. Street parking is available. They accept debit and credit cards too.", "author": "Ann S."}

The food here does have that San Francisco Asian American or British Chinese flavor to it. I'm currently in the area now. I love their menu, you have a wide variety of choices of food to satisfy any cravings you want. At one time I tried their chicken wings and the flavors are on point.  My favorite is the combo chow mein. It's got a lot of different things in in and you pay a really nice price for the plate of food. There are many branches of this restaurant and each one of them live up to the promise of providing great food at a reasonable price. \nDrawback: if you want your food delivered and you live more than five blocks, either pay for delivery or drive and find parking nearby.", "author": "Michael W."}

I got takeout. The green onion pancakes were extremely oily. I ate one while it was hot, but I couldn't eat the rest. The fried won-ton were also very oily and soggy, although the filling was tasty.\n\nI also ordered two luncheon dishes over fried rice: twice-cooked pork, and Mandarin sauce chicken. This is standard Chinese fare. How can you screw it up? But the rice was hard and not puffy. Also, many of the bamboo strips that come with the twice-cooked pork were too fibrous too eat. The bamboo is supposed to be tender, not like chewing toothpicks. The dishes were also very lacking in flavor, and while the prices are not high, they are not remarkably low either.", "author": "Robert H."}

Potstickers were very good, and still atomically hot when they got to me. My only suggestion here would be to ask for extra dipping packets. They give you 1 packets of hot oil and vinegar to mix yourself. The hot oil is very spicy, and there isn't nearly enough for all of the potstickers. I mixed in some sesame oil and rice vinegar I had here at home and problem solved. \nI saved the best for last. The Singapore style noodles.....so good. Nice, big shrimp cooked perfectly.

No offense to the people who are saying the food is average or \"gross\", but you probably should check yourself to make sure your taste buds are working. The food has been delicious every single time (over 50 times) I've been here. If you seriously think this place is not good, go ahead and let me know what you think is so great, and I'll counter that, as any place has certain flaws. \n\nSecondly, if you are complaining about delivery time, don't order delivery. Delivery is inconsistent all the time with every restaurant and really does not validate giving a 1 star. \n\nThe lunch specials are amazing. For an entire portion of chow mien or rice and your pick of meat. you will pay no more than 10 bucks including tip, and that's for food that is definitely above average. The environment is always very quiet in there. The food is made in literally 5 minutes if it's a quiet day, and you never have to deal with crowds, lines or anything like that.\n\nHighly recommend this spot for lunch or dinner to anyone in the area.", "author": "Alex B."}

All the while, she stood there gasping and grunting as if waiting those twenty seconds was the biggest burden of her life.\n\nThroughout the night, we noticed that no one left tips, and now I can see why.\n\nAt the end of  the meal, we got a receipt written entirely in Chinese with what seemed to the the total written on it as it was the only number on the paper. I payed in cash instead of credit and even left her a tip.\n\nInstead of a thank you, she comes back with an extra ten dollars pinned onto our bill. What was this for? Even after adding all of the food we ordered as well as the rice we were forced to buy(which we thought was complimentary given we had no choice but to get it and that it was \"part of the meal\", a big lie), this was a number still off by a good five dollars. Were tips included? God knows as everything was in Chinese.  We left the table clean so it couldn't have been a cleaning fee. The place was already very expensive as it was.\n\nThis was the worst waitress I had ever encountered. She deserves much less than zero stars if I could give a review on just her service.\n\nOverall the service was atrocious, food is decent, and the tea tasted like water and smelled like soap. Would I eat here again willingly? Never. I suggest you do takeout if anything, but avoid eating in at all costs. Oh, and I got a hair in my food.\n\nOne star goes to the gentleman working there and the other to the quick service (the key word is quick).", "author": "Carlos R."}

I love small family owned restaurants but food can be hit or miss.\n\nLet me tell you this was not one of the misses...they hit me in the mouth with flavor and service. We ordered orange flavored chicken, honey walnut prawns, BBQ pork fried rice and the beef and spicy garlic sauce.

It's about $2-3 more expensive than their other entr\u00e9es, but I would say it's worth it. The chicken is sweet (but not too sweet), the walnuts on the side add a great crunch, and together with fried rice, it will make your taste buds pretty happy. \n\nWhen I lived in the Outer Richmond, Tsing Tao was my go-to restaurant whenever I was too lazy to make dinner for myself. I would order on the phone and within 10 minutes, my meal would be ready. Having that meal ready in 10 minutes is a little sketchy because it makes you question how freshly-made the food is, but when you get as hungry as I do, you tend not to care. \n\nNow, I live in the Outer Sunset where there are more options for Chinese restaurants, but Tsing Tao still remains my go-to restaurant when I am craving Chinese food. It is a $20 minimum for delivery and it generally takes about 25-30 minutes for my food to get to my house. \n\nI would also recommend Tsing Tao for lunch. For their lunch menu, most meals cost no more than $8 and it comes with a decent portion of rice and a good portion of meat. Definitely not a bad place to grab a quick, cheap lunch. \n\nOverall, you can consider me a Tsing Tao regular.", "author": "Mark B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-04", "description": "My review is more fun than the others.  Also pretty damn informative.  Read it.  :D\n\nFirst let me praise:\n\nThe Egg Foo Young -  I could eat this _every time_ an egg dish is calling to me.  Of course, breakfast would be a natural fit, but WOW... they make the best EFY.  I could eat it anytime and be just as happy.  \n\nThe chicken variety I had recently was like Chinese Soul Food.  We're talkin' tasty **chicken gravy** over three (seemed more like 4 or 5!) fresh eggs, perfectly cooked, tender and fluffeeee.  The portion was generous enough that you'll either want to split it with a buddy, or have it at home so you can stick it in the fridge and do the aforementioned breakfast thing.  I'm thinkin' WAFFLES on the side would be the ultimate brekkie I could ever have... wow..\n\nA big 5 star stamp * * * * * from me on this dish.  I'm going to eat this everyday the next time I get a cold, which doesn't stand a chance against of Soul Food this Holy. \n\nThen let me get into:\n\nPork Buns!  Excuse me.. *BBQ* Pork Buns!  Holy ****!  I thought having grown up in SF meant I'd had the best PB's by now.  I was wrong!  You actually taste the BBQ-ness in the meat.. none of that unpalatable, slimy fat texture happenin' like what you get at most of the sidewalk dim sum joints; just sweet, tangy unadulterated Bar-Be-Que'd Pork with just the right amount of chewing resistance - not tough, not pablum, but meaty.. the way it should be.  Mine were baked and the pair of perfect brown buns made me feel for one hot second like I was on a beach in Brazil :)  I forgot to remove the semi-invisible white paper on the bottom due to being ravenously hungry.. on the first bun :)  That's ok, a little roughage never hurt anyone.  5 whole stars!  Why?  Read it again.\n\nAnd finally (for this excursion):\n\nDiced Chicken with Cashew Nuts.  Menu-described as: pan fried diced chicken with zucchini, celery and cashew nuts.  Sounds good, huh?  Welp, no celery...\nabout 7 cashews... lots of zucchini! (too much!).  AND, the sauce was watery.  Didn't stick to the above, which means the overall flavor was Bland unless eaten like a stew, with a big ol' spoon.  HOWEVER, once again, my peeps at Tsing Tao came through with the big ass portion.  Ok, maybe if you're hungry enough to hunt down and eat a moose, this would be one meal.  But if you eat like reg'lar folks, this could easily be your lunch and dinner.  Three-ish stars, bordering on 2.5.  Why?  Shaky prep. \n\nBackstory:\n\nMy folks took me here with my bro when we little tykes.  I've been in SF all my life, and it was the 1st place I had Chinese food.  Back in the day, I always seemed to end up with some combo of sizzling rice soup, mongolian beef, sweet and sour prawns or chicken, rice and 7up.  TT has been there awhile now!  The portions have increased in persons-feedable capacity, the food has been great from then to now, and I'm going back again this week.  Moving to Little Russia (about 15 blocks away from the best Chinese food at TT) was a great move.  There's a helluva lot of good food out here.   \n\nSo, by my math, 5 stars + 5 stars + 2.5 stars = 4 stars.  You can check this on your calculator, but I'm right.  They'll probably get 4.5 stars if people wise up to what's good on the menu and quit complaining about their first world problems.  We live like Royalty compared to A LOT of people in the world.

Everything was straightforward and the menu was easily understood without questioning if what you're ordering is what you want.  Once the order was placed, it gave an estimated time of delivery which was about 30 minutes I believe, but the food showed up before that.\n\nYou could tell that they really do make their food fresh and that the delivery was quick as the food was still way to hot to eat.  After it cooled a bit we were actually able to eat the food which was pretty good.  The hot and sour soup was exactly that.  Cream cheese and crab meat wontons were perfect.

But we decided that since we were already there, then why not.\n\nWe went inside and they greeted us immediately and sat us down. My boyfriend already knew what he wanted, which was the fried rice, but since I'm not a big fried rice fan, I took awhile looking at the menu. By the time the waiter got around, I decided that I wanted the chow fun with seafood but the waiter told me they didn't have any chow fun at that time ): I settled with the chow mein instead. My boyfriend got his fried rice, and we also got an order of salt and pepper chicken wings. The fried rice came out first. I didn't realize how huge the portion was, it was more than enough for the both of us without even having to order the other dishes lol. I decided to try it since it was there and I was waiting on the other food and let me tell you, that dish changed my perspective on fried rice. I couldn't get enough of it! It was amazing. The chow mein and chicken came out after that--also huge portions--and it was pretty good too, but no lie, I could not stop going after the fried rice. \nThe service was good too, the waiter checked on us often, asking if we liked the food okay, and refilled our waters when they hit the halfway mark.

We are not big on the spicy stuff on the menu so can't vouch for all of that.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-04-19", "description": "I've been eating here for the entire 22 years that I've been on this planet. Or, as long as I've been able to eat solid food, at least. Some of my earliest memories of food involve Tsing Tao. So it's pretty close to my heart, to say the least. I'm not even sure I can express just how much I love this place.\n\nWhen I was young, my parents would order barbecue pork fried rice, barbecue pork chow mein, and chili pepper prawns (the sauce always comes on the side, so I would just eat the fried shrimp, they were my favorite food). I've since become more adventurous and tried numerous things on the menu, almost all of them equally delicious. But occasionally I feel like eating like I'm 4 again, and I order my chow mein/fried rice/shrimp combo of love. It never disappoints, and it brings me back to my childhood something fierce.\n\nOn top of the food that I can't get enough of, the delivery speed is insane. There have been times that the food has shown up in 10 minutes or less. There was ONCE that I recall it taking the full 45 minutes they claimed. This has really ruined me for all other delivery; all other places I've ever ordered from feel like they take FOREVER.\n\nThey're also extremely accommodating. My mother is ridiculously picky, and even though I've convinced her to give other menu items a try, she insists on ordering them HER WAY. The staff is very good about taking her needlessly complicated orders and filling them (correctly!) without complaint. And for the rare time that they do get something wrong, they're quick to do what they can to correct it.\n\nAnd for the people who complain about the large portions, since when is more for your money ever a bad thing? They pack those little red and white boxes almost beyond capacity every time, which means that not only do I have dinner that night, but lunch tomorrow. They definitely do not skimp on anything.\n\nThat being said, I've had a grand total of two less than awesome experiences here. Once, my beloved chili pepper prawns were burned beyond being edible. But they gave me a new order, so I can't really complain. The second time, I ordered the lemon chicken which I regretted. It was too saccharinely sweet, the lemon sauce tasted more like it should have been drizzled over vanilla ice cream instead of served on the side of fried chicken.\n\nOverall though, this will always be the Chinese restaurant that my heart belongs to. I don't know what I'd ever do if they closed their doors.", "author": "Chelsea T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-13", "description": "Be prepared to walk into a huge 3 course meal for only $6 and some change. This restaurant is located in a good neighborhood and the decor is fresh. Most cheap Chinese restaurants will look a bit run down while this one actually looks pretty good. As soon as you sit down they will offer you free hot tea and iced water on request. The table settings are all placed in advance but they will take them away once you order since their happy hour is served in individual portions rather than family style. The first course is a bowl of their soup of the day. Unlike many other Chinese restaurants, their soup of the day doesn't taste overly salty or drenched in MSG. (MonoSodium Glutamate) The entrees here are humungous. It looks like the plates were meant for two people. At the end, they bring out a few slices of orange and some fortune cookies for dessert.\n\nWe ordered six plates on our visit there. I tried a piece of every plate so I can share my experiences here. The Dragon Beef and Dragon Chicken stood out the most. They were pieces of fried meat with sweet and sour sauce that was more on the sweet side which gave it the perfect taste. Each piece was nice and crunchy but not hard at all. The Dragon Chicken and Beef were soft on the inside. There were no vegetables on this plate, it was for pure carnivores. One of us ordered the Beef and Broccoli plate and the meat was very tender. The broccoli didn't taste flavorless at all and the beef was not over powering. The meat was from a mediocre cut but was somehow as soft as the Steak Cubes from a higher end restaurant like Koi Palace. The shrimp was horrible, avoid ordering that from the happy hour menu. They were hard and oily. For under $6 you can't really expect really good seafood anywhere in San Francisco anyways so that was somewhat expected. Another plate we ordered was the Beef Chow Fun. The Beef Chow Fun was not  on the happy hour menu but we ordered it anyways. There isn't much skill required to make a plate of noodles so it came out exactly as we expected, there was nothing extraordinary about it. Overall, most of the dishes that were served for happy hour are highly recommended, just stay away from the shrimp.\n\nThe service during happy hours was excellent. Generally, cheaper Chinese restaurants would ignore customers as they come in and seat them at an uncleaned table. Then they would rush the order out of the customers and slap the entrees carelessly on the table. Before people are even done eating, they will serve the bill and give out a \"you need to go\" vibe. Tsing Tao was the opposite of my stereotype of a cheap Chinese restaurant. We didn't feel rushed at all and they waiter was smiling as he spoke to us. Our entrees came out relatively close so no one needed to watch others eat while they wait. The bill did not come until we asked for it and we were not rushed to leave. It was relatively slow during happy hour which may explain the better service we were getting compared to the usual experience in a Chinese restaurant but that just means we paid less for more service.\n\nSource&Photos: http://damonfong.wordpress.com/2012/09/12/tsing-tao/", "author": "Damon F."}

I'd be shocked if they didn't have many complaints on this.\n\n2)  Like nearly all Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, they have a $10 minimum for credit card purchases.\n\n3)  Like nearly all Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, their waiters, waitresses, and delivery people don't keep their tips.  I saw this one guy in there doing a pick-up order.  He didn't have to tip, but he did, and the waitress just put the tip money in the register without a 2nd thought.\n\n4)  Like nearly all Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, they round up your total to the nearest whole cent total.  There are no $10.37 purchases; they'll round up to $10.40.  There are no $27.98 purchases; they'll round up to $28.00.\n\nTheir food is really good.  I strongly recommend their soups (hot n sour and seaweed, especially), any eggplant dish, and their appetizers.  They also have decent egg foo young, something that is hard to find in the city.  Their kung pao dishes are good, too.  They have kung pao shrimp, chicken, tofu, and beef.\n\nThey have lunch specials until about 5:00 pm.

But at this rate, I might as well finish my routine sampling of everything on the menu one at a time.\n\nThe prices are quite affordable, especially the outstanding lunch specials.

I am afraid I now can no longer rely on Yelp for decision-making when it comes to picking a good delivery spot.  My order, though nicely packaged (half a star) was a jumbled mess of WAAAYYYY too many scallions, elbowmeat/gristle for the beef dish, greasiest spring rolls I've ever wrung out, and lackluster spice levels despite my very serious request for spiciness.  My Sunkist orange soda and Diet Coke, although, were fizzy like I had hoped (another half a star).\nWhy does everyone find this so fabulous?  We were too grossed out by the looks of the beef to eat more than a bite, and the \"hot and sour\" soup tasted bleachy (yes, I said bleachy).  It also was not hot in any way.\n\nMost of our 40 dollar order is now sitting in our compost bucket, with the exception of the crab puffs, which my BF ate because he was starving.

Growing up in Chicago, we had an awesome Cantonese place (little greasy hole in a bad neighborhood); then where I lived in NYC we had an amazing Hunan-Szechwan place at the street level of my building.  So I guess I've spoiled.  The Chinese restaurants in SF have been a huge let down.  Maybe it was the name of this place, Tsing Tao, that made us try it.  Food was ok.  Kung Pao chicken was about half green onions (which i can't eat), peanuts, red peppers and chicken chunks, nothing else, no water chestnuts to lend that nice crunch.  It was spice enough but not worth the cost considering the overwhelming amount of onions (no celery, no bamboo shoots...).  The friend prawns were more like friend shrimp they were so small, and the \"breading\" used was thick and doughy, not the light kind we like, and with such small shrimp it just isn't a good balance.  Wontons are even bland which is weird.  We got chicken strips for the cats but there was way too much breading and so little chicken it wasn't worth it (cats won't eat the breading).  The chicken chow mein with the $2 extra for fried noodles--I didn't expect them to use the same thick noodles most Chinese places use in regular chow mein, usually they use the thin bird's nest type noodles for the fried noodles--so the chow mein was not very good, too greasy and just didn't have that special taste the smaller noodles lend.  And the sweet and sour was ok, red sauce (REALLY REALLY RED) leaked onto everything since they used the type of disposable boxes you get at salad bars; they should have used the normal Chinese take out boxes.  But delivery was extremely fast--maybe 30 mins at the most which I wasn't expecting (they said it'd take an hour).  Food was edible but not sure we'd order again from here since I can get equally mediocre food in my own neighborhood.  We'll continue to search for the perfect jazz note elsewhere.", "author": "Kai T."}

I live pretty near by and have ordered out and picked up from Tsing Tao enough to testify to their excellent consistency of good (not great, but good), inexpensive food. Pretty much anything you order is okay, although I would stay away from the soggy mango chicken. I like the sauteed asparagus, general cho's chicken, and potstickers (a.k.a. \"slugs,\" as a friend calls them).", "author": "Patrick G."}

I paid for 2 people only $13, I know its really cheap. The service is pretty good, but they don't speak much English so you have to explain to them or show them on the menu what you want.", "author": "Nikita K."}

My food comes most of the time in less than 30 minutes! No pizza place can beat that. And they have a decent price for their food. Their service is good, the people are real nice. The food is not super great but pretty damn good. A lot better than most of the Chinese place in the city. They are fast, good service, and good tasting.", "author": "tai n."}

One night, however, the cook was either in the middle of a major meltdown or they were serving Chung-King out of the can. I ordered lemon chicken as I normally did - and normally loved. What came out of the kitchen was tough, cold, covered in fat and absolutely devoid of taste. Imagine trying to chew and swallow an old piece of carpet padding. They deducted the dish from the check when I complained but the glares I got from the cook when he sauntered out of the kitchen told me I would be wise not to return unless I was willing to risk having this fool spit in my food. If you want really good Chinese food, check out Hunan II on Cabrillo Street. Consistenly great!", "author": "Owen H."}

Everything seemed at least a day or two old, from the rubbery vegetables in the mu shu to the stringy, soggy sesame chicken. \n\nOne of the stranger textures of the meal was the won tons.  How did they get the meat filling so overcooked and the noodle part so uncooked?\n\nmy stomach hurts just 10 minutes after eating a small portion and I am already farting.  looks like I'm in for a rough night.", "author": "Aaron C."}

I ordered white rice, general tsao chicken, vegetable spring rolls, mongolian beef and hot and sour soup.

Found this place in the phone book, I believe, and was SOO pleased when the food arrived. I wasn't expecting anything too great since I never heard of the place, but to my surprise, the food was absoloutely fantastic. I ordered the shrimp and walnuts (the ones drenched in mayonnaise) and your standard beef and broccoli. The meal came with rice (I think) and a fortune cookie! Woo woo. Alright, so let me tell you how good I think the food is at Tsing Tao. I'm Chinese and I've eaten TONS and TONS of beef and broccoli. Honestly, I prefer not to choose that dish because it's so overplayed! Especially for us Chinese folks. Anywho, I put that beef and broccoli into my mouth that night and mmmmmmmm mmMmmm!!!!!!! And...that's saying a lot. Good portions..boy oh boy, was I satisfied. Man, I remember gobbling down the food because it was so tasty! Good price for good food. Will definitely order take out from here again!", "author": "Cris L."}

LOVE it.\n\none problem though, no matter how many times you stress that you want something made extra spicy, it will come regular.  im a spicy food freak so i just toss it with some cayenne pepper, problem solved, so they dont really lose points.\n\nHUGE TASTY PORTIONS FOR CHEAP, FAST DELIVERY.  that is all i want out of my chinese delivery, and for some reason, it is uncommon in sf.  also, they deliver till 10.  tsing tao is awesome, def worth it!!!!!", "author": "CC C."}

What more can you ask for when your too lazy to walk down the street?!  My boyfriend is hands down the pickiest eater I have ever encountered and he loves this place.  He says they use the best quality chicken he has seen from chinese restaurants in SF.  We both love, love, love the egg rolls!  I have to say something about their crab cheese puffs...they are the most amazing little pieces of heaven you will ever eat! Other places always have too much cheap cheese in their puffs, but not this place, they have them filled with good crab meat and a great cheese.  You can actually taste the crab!  My mouth is watering right now just thinking about dipping those puffs in some sweet and sour sauce!  My only complaint, their shrimp has always seemed a bit too fishy for my tasting.  You must try the honey walnut chicken and the crab cheese puffs!", "author": "Katii S."}
