I had recently watched Anthony Bourdain's episode in Thailand and came away with such a craving for good Thai food. I realize it's hard to get truly authentic Thai food here, but was still looking to be transported to the land of fiery spice, freshness, and interesting flavor combinations . \n\nMy destination of choice - Marnee Thai 9th Avenue.\n\nThe place was hopping the Saturday evening we dined there. People were spilling out the door and lined the skinny entrance way. Fortunately, we made reservations via Yelp (yay yelp!) and we're seated instantly. Great start!\n\nService was efficient, but almost too efficient. Menus and water were served immediately upon being seated, but we had to wait a little too long to order despite making eye contact with several servers to indicate our readiness.\n\nNevertheless, we finally ordered - all from the Specials:\n- hot cakes - interesting! Slightly sweet rice flour and coconut batter baked into soft custard-like clouds and topped with corn kernels, kabocha squash slivers. This reminded me of a savory maja Blanca - a Filipino dessert\n-tea leaf salad - tasty, but not the best I've ever had. This one had fresh greens (romaine), but the tea leaf mash was too salty and definitely needed acids to balance it\n- curry mousse snapper - so interesting! Great combination of soft curry mousse and hearty fish. I'd enjoy this on a cold winter night.\n- shrimp pad Thai - I had such high hopes for this as I've had it here before and it was AHMAZING! I had dreamt about it for YEARS since it became the gold standard of Pad Thais. Not so much this rime around :( Texture was spot on, but it was severely lacking acid to balance all the sweetness. It certainly was not bad, but again fell short.\n\nOverall, it is very good! Everything was freshly prepared and tasty - just not as balanced as I had hoped.", "author": "Bella L."}

So when a friend suggested that we meet there for dinner, I was looking forward to the meal.\n\nWe started with the papaya salad without shrimp. When it came out, the portion was a nice size and there were tomatoes in it, which was unusual but a welcomed sight. We dug in and after a couple of bites, it was clear that the chef had a very heavy hand with the spicy lime dressing. It was so hot, to the point where we could only eat a few bites. My mouth was on fire. I then became concerned about the curry I had ordered. Our waitress clearly had the same thought so she brought over a spoonful of the curry for me to taste before our entrees came out.\n\nI got the green curry with vegetables and my friend ordered the pad prig khing with chicken. The green curry was not as rich or as thick as I'm used to So the vegetables were not really coated in it. Neither Andrea came with rice so we ordered two sides of brown rice. Everyone around us had the homemade hot cakes that they appeared to be really enjoying. If we ever return, that is definitely what we should try.\n\nI am not sure if this place has gone downhill over the last several years or if we just didn't order the right things. My sister loved the pad see ew there and I'm guessing that that is what I should've gotten. But, despite our being underwhelmed by the food, given it's proximity to the UCSF medical center, the place was really booming and benefitting from the after work crowd.", "author": "Maisha R."}

The restaurant isn't that big so all of this took away from the overall experience.\n\nThe tables next to us all had water upon seating but I had to ask for ours. Other people who were seated at the same time as us also got their food first. One of the tables next to us was given food and had it taken away just before they ate it because it was for another table.\n\nHowever the food was very good. I'm vegan so I ordered the jasmine rice with praram phak. This consists of assorted fresh vegetables like cauliflower or broccoli, mushrooms, baby corn and fried tofu with peanut curry sauce (with coconut milk). It was delicious. The peanut curry sauce tasted very good.\n\nWhen I ordered I specifically asked that no oyster sauce and no fish sauce be included in my order and the waitress said it was vegetarian so it didn't include it and not to worry but I'm skeptical because one of the items in their vegetarian menu section says it is made of oyster sauce in the description. I hoped mine didn't have any and thought the chances were good since it wasn't included in this items description and the waitress said it was fine.\n\nI would recommend for the food but warn you not to come at a busy time.

They tasted almost like Buffalo Wild Wings asian zing wings . They weren't bad though. Came out nice and hot . Drenched in sauce . \n\nImperial Rolls (3.5/5 stars) \n- these fried rolls weren't bad. They're not the typical meaty type of egg rolls . They have clear noodles and shrimp inside. Not sure what else we're in there. The wrap is very thin so it gets crumbly. Not too bad though...\n\nE N T R E E S \n\nHonestly .. all the food tasted REALLLLLYYY good cause they brought out this hot sauce that was for the Thai fried rice ... and omg that sauce tho. Bommbbbb AF ! with everything ! I wished I could buy the sauce and take it home . \n\nThai Fried Rice (5/5 stars) \n- I actually really liked this dish !! Cause of the hot sauce it came with ! But even alone it was good. Not too salty . Not sweet . Just right :) \n\nChan Pad Poo (3.5/5 stars) \n- This dish was good but it wasn't like OMGGG GOOOD .. it was one of the more common pics I saw on yelp. So I thought I'd try it. Glad I did . But it was mehhishhh. \n\nPad Siew (4/5 Stars) \n- can never really go wrong with this dish. It tastes the same at almost every Thai place . But it was actually better than most places. So I do recommend trying it :) \n\nThe one thing I do give 5 stars to is to our water guy ! Even though it was busy, he never let my tiny cup go to empty.

Chan pad poo is stir-fried spicy rice noodles with crab meat and egg in a chili garlic sauce. It tastes like pad thai but on the more acidic side!

It wasn't very busy, but I felt that we had to wave down our server often if we needed something. But overall, helpful when we did ask questions. Pricing is reasonable in SF. \n\nThere are 2 locations. I imagine the one closer to outer sunset would have easier parking if one was to drive.

So Yummy! \n\nI tried mango sticky rice with black rice for the first time, I don't know what makes it black but it was de-lish!

It was a little more on the greasy side, but that's probably what made it so good.\n\nAlso tried the red curry and green curry, I personally liked the red curry better, but the green was still very good.\n\nThe place is small and a little run down.

The blossoms and shrimp were cooked so the salad was slightly warm.  If you never ate banana blossoms, it's good to know that the cooked blossoms have a texture similar to artichoke hearts.  It was mixed with a delicious savory sauce.\n\nPad Thai:  It was similar to the Pad Thai I got on the streets of Bangkok.  This can be both good and bad depending on your view.  It is very simple yet tasty.  Some Thai restaurants will spruce it up by adding nicely saut\u00e9ed prawns and toasty tofu but not here.  There is no sear to this dish.  Once again, like the street food.\n\nFried pork belly:  They offer 3 sauces to choose from so we chose the basic chili/garlic sauce.  It was very good.  It is essentially a roast pork topped with a sauce.  The skin was crispy but the meat was a little dry. Fortunately the layers of fat complemented the meat well.\n\nThai ice tea:  unfortunately it was very weak in tea flavor (even though we asked for less cream) and super sweet.\n\nFried banana & honey:  it was good tasting but the portion was tiny.  They quartered a banana and fried two quarters, which is one order.\n\nThe service is a bit lacking but the staff was nice.

And I must say, I enjoyed everything!\n\nLychee Iced Tea\nThis is not your average lychee iced tea. It taste like it when you first drink it, but then you get the pleasant aftertaste of Thai tea. The refreshing flavor of lychee and the nice sweetness of the Thai tea really brings this drink to the next level. I highly recommend!!\n\nPad Thai\nWith so many great options at Thai restaurants, it can be hard to choose. But, you can't go wrong with Pad Thai as long as the restaurant makes its well. Some do it too sweet, while others not sweet enough, etc. It has to be the right balance of sweet and tart. And Marnee Thai gets it just right! If you are not feeling like playin around with a new dish, go with this classic!\n\nCoconut Stir Fried Noodles\nI was so glad I decided to try this because it's a new favorite! It has taminard so it does give you some pad Thai vibes but the type of noodles used along with the coconut flavors provide a unique twist to a familiar dish.

Very detailed I guess but if you want that extra 50 cents just ask me and let me go. Instead it was another 15 minutes of waiting.

Super unique offerings you don't often encounter at other Thai restaurants, affordable prices, and most importantly, really delicious food.\n\nI've been twice, and each time I've tried and loved the chan pad poo, which is essentially a crab pad thai with egg. Most recently, I also ordered the (vegan) coconut hotcakes, crab eggrolls (these were unexpectedly drenched in sauce but still great), and shrimp tom yum soup. Everything was fantastic, and I can't wait to come back and try more of the menu next time I'm in the area.", "author": "Kelly R."}

It's spicy fried rice stick noodles w/ crab meat, egg and green onions)\n- Thai Style Fried Rice (get it with crab meat)\n- Tom Yum Soup (amazing flavor; spicy and sour)\n- Fried Banana with Ice Cream (self-explanatory)\n- Mango with Sticky Rice (also self-explanatory)\n\nReservations and take-out are both options, and I'd recommend them for the busy weekends if you don't want to wait.

I searched Yelp for Thai places near where I was staying in the Inner Sunset, and decided to try out Marnee. I went alone and ordered two entrees for myself with the intention of bringing half home. The Pad See-U and Thai fried rice were both good. The See-U was very flavorful but could have used a bit of spice, which they provide on the table. The fried rice was similarly a bit bland without the spice, but that may just be my own taste. Regardless, I would order both again.\n\nThe disappointing part of the experience, and thus why I'm only giving three stars, is that when I asked for my leftovers to be boxed up (half of each entree remained), the waitress took the dishes to the back and returned with only a small fraction of what remained on my plate, perhaps 25% of my leftovers. I planned on eating the leftovers for another meal, but this was no longer possible.\n\nThe food was good, but I left feeling very angry that I had wasted my money on two entrees when I really only needed one.

It wasn't overly sweat either and the noodles were perfectly cooked. \n\nAngel wings: I actually prefer it to be more fried than it was. It wasn't that saucy either which I wish it was. The only time I had Thai wings was at pok pok in Portland. Honestly they were better than these. I really liked the garlic though. I love garlic and there was no shortage here. \n\nCoconut cakes: so freaking good. Just like the street food in Thailand except way more expensive hahah. Really enjoyed it. \n \nPumpkin curry: had it with tofu. I wish the curry was a little thicker but that's just preference. It was also in a very small dish but there was a good amount of pumpkin and tofu so that was nice. \n\nOverall, I'm not from the city and it seemed pretty expensive to me but apparently it's more affordable than most other ethnic cuisines.

I thought this would be sufficient to keep us warm but alas, the tendrils of cold snaked their way back and engulfed us. We quickly ordered our food and Thai iced teas, which came out before the meal in tall narrow glasses.

The reviews looked promising and even though they were preparing to close for the night, the servers still welcomed us in. \n\nThe restaurant is fairly big, but more narrow than wide. There's a slight tinge to the lighting, making everything seem more subdued and quiet. \n\nWith the six of us having slightly full stomachs but room to still eat, we all ordered smaller dishes and shared items amongst the rest of us. I'm not the biggest Thai food fan and don't particularly care for any specific dish, so I just ordered a simple spring roll dish. I don't have any complaints about the dish - it was simple and what I expected. There were six spring rolls stuffed with cucumber, lettuce, carrots, etc. and came with a side of peanut sauce. I wouldn't say the dish was memorable, but it was good for the price. \n\nTheir Pad Thai dish was also quite tasty. This dish was a lot better than my simple spring roll dish - the flavors were on point, there were lots of ingredients in the dish itself, and it looked good. I'd probably order this dish again. My other friends tried the curry and Pad See Ew, and both dishes were highly praised by them. Good flavor and a good number of ingredients in each one. \n\nOverall I would say a pretty solid Thai food experience. I liked the food here, but since I rarely get a Thai food craving, I probably wouldn't be back. But from what I tasted and the service we received, I have to give this place four stars.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

Perhaps this is what traditional Panang beef curry is supposed to be like, but at least they should indicate this on the menu.

Over the years we have been here several times and the taste of the food was hit or miss.  We arrived early enough that there were tables for 2 easily.  Maybe I should have asked if the Daddy chef was cooking tonight but it was the son in the kitchen. \nFor the $50 we spent for dinner, I could've tried a few more places up the block. \n\nOur Tom Yum soup with prawns and a few slices of tomatoes and mushroom$10 was too sour/tart. Really spicy too. It was hard to consume and Hubby didn't like it.  \nThe 1st time I ever tasted this soup was at the Irving place and it was so good and the flavors were well balanced, but not here. I didn't like it either. At no point did the wait staff check to see if we liked the food. The chicken with onions, bell peppers off the Chef's Special list was OK but we both agreed we wouldn't order again. I told Hubby to get a curry dish instead and as a teaching moment, the wife was right again. \n\nThe chicken Pad Thai was not as good as at Irving St.  The noodles were over cooked, soggy like over done spaghetti, not enough peanuts on top and normally when the bean sprouts are on the side to allow you to mix into the dish or on top, we were surprised to find it buried under the noodles.  Over all the main courses tasted as if they had too much sugar. \n\nHubby's Thai iced coffee and the mango sticky rice dessert were the best items of the evening. The coffee tastes great in a milkshake type glass. It took awhile for the dessert to arrive.  A small mound of warm sticky rice drizzled with sweet condensed milk and served with slices of mango was not only visually pretty, but tasted great. If we had room, we would've each had our own and not shared. \n\nIf you want Marnee, either wait for the Daddy chef to cook that evening or head to the Irving Street one. Thai iced coffee and mango sticky rice are excellent. We were not happy with the soup and entrees.", "author": "Ry T."}

You don't come here to order Pad Thai. The menu is too excitingly diverse for that. Since 1986, this family owned restaurant has served up exotic mouthwatering dishes that you can't necessarily get anywhere else.\n\nMust starters include HOR MOK (steamed snapper in cabbage bites) and MORNING GLORY SALAD (crispy green bites).\n\nFor sweet taste noodles, the COCONUT STIR-FRIED RICE NOODLES WITH PORK BELLY, the whole thing is a fantasia of flavor. \n \nPeanut curry lovers will get their fix with the PAD PRARAM, it without fail delivers a strong emphasis on crushed peanut curry.\n\nFor something usual there are two: BANANA CURRY with perfectly sliced plaintain bananas soaked in curry sauce, or more importantly, the BASA FILET SPECIAL which is a souffle/pureed fish wrapped in banana leaf that's velvet in your mouth.\n\nDo get yourself a spicy pork dish and curry shrimp dish on the side as well. Remember, you come here to share plates. The ideal is to come with four people and try everything around you family style. Order everything spicy, but have white rice and Kirin Light beer or Singha to cool the tongue down.\n\nLast, most times after gorging you can forget the dessert but not this time. ROTI WITH ICE CREAM is like a crispy pancake with a perfect coconut scoop. This time, be rude with your mates -- get the first and last bites. MANGO WITH STICKY RICE is also top-notch. \n\n\"Marnee\" has an enormous reputation, and it is earned. This isn't my favorite Thai restaurant in San Francisco when it comes down to personal tastes. I'm still captivated by \"Lers Ros Thai,\" due to the fact they have a few dreamy dishes nobody else has, I'm simply hooked by them.

Curry sucks, though.)\n\nI've been eating Thai food all my life with a nut allergy with no issue because I am super careful. Generally speaking, restaurants will let you know if they can confidently prepare your dish without cross-contamination. If they can't, I don't eat there. No harm, no foul. BUT, when Marnee Thai insists they can accommodate my allergy and instead I end up with anaphylaxis, that's just not okay.\n\nI don't doubt at one point this restaurant was careful with cross-contamination. Literally their website says: \"And if you've got special dietary needs, food allergies, or plain old taste preferences, just let our servers know. We're happy to accommodate.\" I myself ate here for a few years with no problems, but they have obviously let their policies slide recently.

The wings were slightly fried which added a sense of crispiness to it.\n\nSummer Roll: A-.\nHonestly, I don't know what's the difference between summer roll and regular thai/vietnamese rolls, but they were pretty bomb. All ingredients was fresh and the rolls were tightly wrapped.\n\nGreen Curry with Beef: A-.\nThe curry smelled very good. It did not have a strong flavor, but I guess it was the eggplant which intrinsically enhanced the taste of the curry sauce. Beef was tender as well.\n\nMango Fried Rice with Shrimp: B+.\nNothing too special about this dish. I picked this just because I really like pineapple fried rice and wanted to see how it would go with mango. Because of the mango's tropical flavor it definitely increased my appetite.\n\nChan Pad Poo (Pad Thai with Dungeness Crab): A-.\nOrdered this dish based on fellow Yelpers reviews. Pretty good!

Given the top reviews I had seen, I expected excellent Thai food. My friend and I both got lunch specials. The lunch specials are just lower priced, smaller plates of food. They do not come with anything like soup or salad. I ordered beef Pad See Ew. The noodles were cooked nicely and the flavor was good, however, the beef was awful. It was over cooked, yet chewy, with absolutely no flavor. My friend was allergic to gluten so she normally gets yellow or red curry. However, the waitress said the curries contained soy sauce already mixed in and that since they make the curry at the start of the day they can't make it without. Alternatively, she ordered Pad Thai but asked for no peanuts due to another allergy. The waitress brought out her pad thai about 10 minutes later with peanuts on it. I'm not sure how she forgot so fast. However, when we complained she immediately took it back and brought us a steaming fresh plate about 10 minutes later signifying that they actually made her a new dish which we appreciated. Overall, the food was okay, but I don't have any desire to go back.\n\nOH ALSO, they have a $15 minimum for credit cards and a $10 minimum for any purchase in general. Meaning that if you were to come in to get a thai iced tea you couldn't unless your bill was at least $10. Kinda a strange rule, but none of their entrees are under $10 anyways.", "author": "Tanita J."}

The spring roll was average and expensive; each little portion basically cost a dollar.  We had their famous chicken wings, and they were tasty in a sweet and spicy way but I also felt that they were a very American thing to have.\nAs for the entrees, my mom was a big fan of her Pad Se - Ew, the large flat noodles with a spicy flavor.  My brother was a fan of his chicken curry.  My dad felt ambivalent about his sea bass special; I tried it and it was not very flavorful.  As for my pad thai, I felt kInd of disappointed: the sauce tasted like a mixture of peanut butter and ketchup, a flavor I loved when I was a kid but not so much anymore.

Didn't have to wait too long to be seated, and almost instantaneously we ordered our food. \n\nFresh rolls with peanut sauce - 4/5 one of my weaknesses; I order it at almost every opportunity and this one hit the spot. The peanut sauce had a tiny bit of kick with it and was very savory\n\nPad Kee Mao - 4/5 despite the description saying \"spicy\", make sure you explicitly specify to your server that you want it spicy. I bumped this up to a 4 as a return visit and second try with this dish was much improved; the first time, I neglected to specify and it ended up being a bit too bland for my taste\n\nChan Pad Poo - 4/5 think of it as pad Thai but with crab meat instead. This one was pretty flavorful and one of the better items I've had on the menu! That being said, I was disappointed that it was lacking in the assortment of veggies that come with the pad Thai \n\nIt also doesn't hurt that the restaurant has some cheap bottles of wine you can order for the table. If you're not a sommelier, it'll do quite nicely (~$27 for a bottle? I'll take it), but don't expect quality. \n\nOverall, it's a good experience with some pretty yummy Thai food that hits the spot", "author": "Jay P."}

I can't speak to the actual authenticity of anything, but I did like the decor of the place and the overall calm and quiet ambiance. Since it was late on a Sunday, we didn't expect them to be as busy as they were. Still, we were seated almost immediately.\n\nI was craving wings for some reason, so this popped up as a suggestion. Spicy Angel Wings were delicious and definitely spicy enough for me. Satisfied my craving for sure! I would definitely order these again. And again. And again.\n\nThe other dishes we ordered were the Chicken (Larb) Salad, Kang Dang (Red Curry) with Beef, and Pad Woon Sen with Pork. The salad was delicious and very flavorful, without an overpowering fish sauce taste. I don't know what else they add to it, but it tasted better than at most places. Red Curry was pretty good, but a little watery in consistency, I think. Pad Woon Sen was also a good dish and a nice change from the usual Pad Thai/Pad See Ew that I order.\n\nSomething I don't usually comment on is food presentation - Marnee Thai hit the mark with their presentation. All the food looked beautiful and colorful.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left, the staff were very friendly and nice. They were perfectly fine with accommodating my friend's food allergy. I felt bad for our waitress because I kept going through my water like crazy (I'll admit, I don't handle spice well).

The PAD SEE EW here was pretty good-- I always order this with beef but they have chicken available.  The dish that stood out the most were the ANGEL WINGS!  Crispy fried wings, sauteed in a spicy garlic sauce-- this is topped with fried basil, which were actually pretty tasty.  The wings could have been a little spicier (but then again, I love spicy food), so all you wimps should try it! haha.  \n\nFor dessert, we had the MANGO STICKY RICE.  I've never seen this dish served with sweet black rice, so that was interesting.  Sweet rice grains tend to be sweeter, stickier, but also have a thicker outer shell.  Some of the rice tasted hard/dried, so I wish the sticky rice were made fresh.  On the other hand, the mango was sweet and ripe.", "author": "Stacey K."}

It didn't seem as amazing as I remember it to be (the sauce tasted a little different), but it was still pretty good.

They came out nice and golden, but I didn't find the flavors to be all that different from samosas you can get anywhere else.\n\n-- STIR-FRIED STEWED PORK BELLY with Bamboo Shoots, Mushrooms, and Baby Corn in a Garlic Chili Sauce...$12.50\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/marnee-thai-san-francisco-2?select=gdeX343-yYSVXbH1za3E-A#OQ49TClJVzq1OQ1hqdlPKA)\nMy buddy and I wanted this and \"The Poo\", so we split both.

Amphawa's is still the best for me, but Marnee's is a close second.  It's more on the mild side, but it's better than being too spicy (like the one at House of Thai).  The kick is subtle and complements the crab and Chili Garlic Sauce well.\n\nDespite the fact our meal went better than I had hoped/feared, I doubt I'll be looking to come back to this Marnee Thai.

It's so coconutty that coconut lovers will go nuts because it's so absolutely amazing. Oh, and if you like spicy, use that condiment that they provide on the table for these cakes because the condiment definitely goes well with these hotcakes. \n\nPad Thai was just enough sweet, salty, and sour with lots of meat and veggies.

So goodddd. \n\n***** -1 STAR *****\nSo there was the three of us, and us teenagers really can't eat all that much. We kinda knew what we were capable of eating so we only ordered the curry with two bowls of white rice and the coconut hotcakes. The waitress looked at us and gave us a pretty rude look saying, \"WHAT? That's it? There really isn't enough food for three people.\" We said that we'd order more if we felt hungry after we finish, but she had walked off to another waiter to say something that caused both of them to look at us with furrowed brows. Man, we felt so threatened to order another dish- pad thai. UGHHHHH we really didn't finish anything but the hot cakes. We ended up taking 3/4 of the Pad Thai home and leaving 1/4 of the curry behind. WE WASTED FOOD. Tip to waiter: Let customers be in charge of ordering their own food, they know what they're capable of and what if we just wanted a light bite because maybe we were going to eat somewhere else after??? Please don't make your future customers feel obligated to order more than they can eat. \n\nJust glad the food here was good. It's worth the bloated stomachs that we later encountered. Just come to Marnee Thai you won't regret it!!!", "author": "Wendy T."}

It came with a medley of vegetables including eggplant. The eggplant was completely inedible. You know that taste you get when you cook with veggies that have been sitting in your fridge for way too long? That disgusting sour taste of expiration? That was what was in the eggplant and it of course ruined most of the curry and my overall experience here.\n\nAlso, they were shut down earlier this year because of a rat or cockroach infestation. Their health score is listed here in Yelp and it's not even 60/100. The eggplant incident occurred after they reopened so you would think their standards have improved (and maybe they have - at least I didn't have diarrhea like I did the very first time I came here), but given that there are tons of other Thai options nearby, I'm done with Marnee forever.", "author": "Tiffany H."}

This place was definitely a neighborhood gem, small but felt very homey. We came at 8:30 pm on a Saturday night and was seated right away, probably because it was way past supper time.\n\nWe got the chicken red curry, basa fish fillet with ginger & pork sauce, pad thai, and papaya salad. These are usually the staple items I go for to evaluate a Thai restaurant's authenticity. The papaya salad came out first as an appetizer, but because I wanted to take a picture of all of the food, I made everyone wait for the rest of the food (#doitforthegram :P) The food took awhile to come out, but was hot nonetheless. Our waiter realized that the salad was untouched until the hot food items came out, and apologized saying that he assumed that we wanted the appetizers first, so they paced out the entree dishes til much later. That was nice of him to clarify. \n\nFoodwise, portion was a little on the smaller side, but the flavours were SPOT ON. Fish fillet was fried to a delicious crisp, and the pad thai was bursting with flavour. The chicken in the curry was nice and tender.\n\nCan't wait to come back/Go to the other location to try out more stuff!", "author": "Ivy W."}

As soon as you walk in, the smell of vinegar / stinky-tofu (like smell) hits you. At this point I really wanted to leave but didn't cause of the people I came with. Then we got waters that tasted like tap water with a hint of something fishy. Our hot water was served in a glass cup without handles... \nThe food... pad thai definitely had ketchup. I'm not sure if that's how you're supposed to make it, but the ketchup smell was too over-powering. \nThe pad see-ew was prob the best out of the three dishes we ordered. The beef in it however was terrible. Tasted like the vegan fake beef that don't have texture or taste. \nThe fried rice was a standard fried rice. It was alright. It had cucumbers that are decorative and the people I was with told me some restaurants reuse them on other plates if the customers don't touch it.

It was interesting enough that my friend, who is a SF local, comment about it as well.\n\nWe ordered Pad Thai with Shrimp, Red Curry with Chicken, Pad Krapow with sliced pork, and white rice. Everything was good for sure. The red curry had a bit more coconut milk than I'm used to, but it doesn't overpower nor exaggerate flavors, it was a nice blend. The krapow was a bit more saucy than I'm used to as well, but was good regardless. Pad Thai doesn't compare to authentic ones in Thailand, but that's always the case right?

I'm writing a review based on my takeout experience here, however. My boyfriend and I ordered a chicken salad and an order of shrimp fried rice with mango to split. Both dishes were super, SUPER disappointing.\n\nThe fried rice had no spice, which could have been fine- hey, maybe they forgot to add spice based on what I said over the phone. The shrimp in the fried rice still had the shells attached, which made it hard and awkward to eat- but also, I can live with that...maybe it's the traditional way of cooking shrimp fried rice. However, there were PIECES of shrimp tail within the rice that were disgusting and made it almost impossible to eat. I don't know about you, but eating fried rice and consistently coming across many, many pieces of crunchy shrimp shell is not an enjoyable experience.\n\nThe above fried rice on its own would have maybe given this place a two or three-star rating. However, when we bit into the chicken salad we ordered and there were pieces of ground BONE in the salad. Rock hard, crunchy pieces of chicken bone were mixed into the ground chicken. It was nauseating, and I shudder to think what the process of making this chicken salad is that allows for giant chunks of bone to be mixed in.\n\nFinal verdict: not one, but two dishes with gross bone/shells in them is enough for me to never go back here again.

I have to say - it was VERY watery, and the chicken was a mix of dark and white (mostly dark), so tasted a bit gamey. The potatoes were way undercooked and it lacked flavor overall - it really was very watery. So disappointed!!! This review coming from a girl that will eat anything.

It's delicious every single time -- steaming hot, saucy and untangled, a perfect balance of flavors. I really can't go to this place without ordering it. \n\nI've dappled in the other dishes - green curry, spring rolls, papaya salad, silver noodles, soups - all of which are good, solid dishes but not necessarily must-haves.

I've tried many dishes here, but a few of my favorites are:\n\n--Spicy Angel Wings - chicken wings marinated with a spicy chili-garlic sauce, perfect size appetizer for sharing. \n--Pad Kee Mao - rice noodles pan fried with a choice of chicken, beef or pork, chili, garlic, tomatoes, string beans and sweet Thai basil on a bed of lettuce. \n--Kang Ka Ree (Yellow Curry) - Mild curry with coconut milk, turmeric, fresh herbs and spices with yukon potatoes, served with a choice of chicken, prawns or lamb. Love love love the this dish, great curry made with fresh ingredients. \n--Pad See Ew - pan-fried rice noodles with soy bean, broccoli and egg and a choice of chicken, beef or pork.\n\nI really enjoy the friendly service and the overall atmosphere of the restaurant.

Bay Area\" rave about it while Leslie Sbrocco was having one too many glasses of her reserve chardonnay. Unanimous praise is not that unusual on that program, but the dishes looked so uniquely succulent for what I thought would be just another Thai place that I couldn't resist its allure. Now here's the challenge these days. Jamie W. and I are going all plant-based with our dining choices, so we were wondering if we would be able to find anything on the menu to compete with the likes of the Spicy Angel Wings or the Stir-Fried Stewed Pork Belly, both of which I would have easily ordered and devoured just weeks earlier.\n\nWell, it turns out our concerns were unfounded as their vegetarian options are genuinely tasty and satisfying here. First things first, Marnee Thai passed my spring roll test, the true litmus for the quality of any Southeast Asian fare that lies ahead of me. The $7.95 Summer Rolls, a seasonal special, were crispy-fresh with just the right consistency in both the rice noodles and the wrapper. Yes, I recognize there was shrimp in them. Don't expect me to be perfect, OK? Bottom-feeders are in my diet, I swear. Regardless, the hoisin peanut sauce was the perfect complement (see photo). We then shared two veg-head dishes. The first was Jamie's predictable choice - the $9.50 Pad Thai Vegetarian, which mixed the savory fried rice stick noodles and fresh bean sprouts with a bounty of stir-fried vegetables - broccoli, cauliflower, peppers, snap peas, asparagus and baby corn (see photo).\n\nWarmed tofu, egg and a carpet of ground peanuts completed the picture. It was a nice, fresh execution on an old standby. But I have to tell you I was completely blown away by the $9.50 Spicy Ma Kuer, a peasant-style plate of saut\u00e9ed eggplant with mushrooms, fried tofu, baby corn, bell pepper, chili, garlic and Thai basil (see photo). Again, it was the consistency of the eggplant that really made this dish almost carnivorous in nature. But the eggplant has no face and no mother, so I'm cool. I would order that dish again in a heartbeat, and I can't wait to try the Pumpkin Curry next time. So if you find yourself in the Inner Sunset after an afternoon traipsing around Golden Gate Park, I say this is a great place to rest your weary bones and indulge in some of the tastiest Thai food I've had in this fair city of ours.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...robust flavors pop at this compact, busy place\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...a bit tight in there\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...genuinely attentive and quick\nTOTAL - 5 stars...could be my go-to Thai vegetarian place from now on", "author": "Ed U."}

We ordered Angel Wings and the Imperial Rolls, both which were really good. Then one by one each of my friends received their entrees. When the last one came out, the waiter asked me \"what did you order again?\" -_-... I told him what I ordered thinking that he was going to go to the back just to check up on the status of my food, but I was wrong. It was obvious that they had not put in my order to begin with because 15 minutes later and I still had no food. 3/4 into our meal, a waitress came by and asked how everything was. We said that we were still missing an entree and I asked her to check how much longer until my food was ready. A few minutes later she came back and said it was on it's way.. That's fine except it wasn't \"on its way\". Five minutes later and it still wasn't out and by this time all my friends were finished with their entrees. At this point we called the waitress over to let her know that I wanted to cancel my order. There is really no point in eating when all your friends have already finished! She said okay and put in the cancellation while  simultaneously, the other waiter brought out my food. I told him I had just cancelled my order and that I did not want it anymore. He said he knew I had been waiting 30+ minutes for my food and that he would take it off of the bill but could I eat my food anyways. It was funny how he had said it but I'll give credit to him because he knew it was his fault.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-10-04", "description": "Funny that I should love and hate this place so much that it ends up averaging 3 stars, though I will separate my review to clarify my somewhat bipolar opinion.\n\nDisclaimer: Sorry no pictures.  I was celebrating my friend's birthday so I didn't want to do the obnoxious \"Omg don't eat that yet!!!  I need a picture!!!\"\n\n[PART ONE: THE 5-STAR COMPONENT]\n\nThis place has some seriously tasty food.  Yup, I'm talking about Thai comfort food carby goodness of stir-fry noodles and fried rice.  \n\nThe noodle and rice dishes definitely tasted different from your average Thai place, which usually derives more flavor from greasiness than sauce.  Marnee Thai's noodles/fried rice had the homemade touch: there was something about the soy sauce/fish sauce/secret ingredient that was reminiscent of Thai temple style cooking.  \n\nI would recommend the Thai fried rice (a lot of chicken and veggies, not just all saucy rice), pad kee mao (interesting that they add a layer of black pepper on top, but I liked the extra kick), and pad Thai (though the shrimp weren't very fresh).  \n\nWe also had the Panang beef curry.  Instead of a bowl, it came in a dish so IMO it was more like stir-fry.  I think it was a bit too salty and there was this weird mayo sauce, but the beef was tender and the curry was alright.\n\nRumors say the angel wings are highly recommended, but personally I would say it doesn't beat the famous San Tung chicken wings.  To my understanding, angel wings are supposed to be stuffed, but the ones at Marnee Thai were just deep-fried wings with a sweet and spicy BBQ sauce, sprinkled with some fried basil and served on an aesthetic square plate.  Be warned that some people found it rather spicy.  Not bad, but it didn't stand out--the noodles and fried rice were the main highlight.\n\n[PART TWO: THE 1-STAR COMPONENT]\n\nThe main drawback is the service.  Or more like the management... essentially their business practice is finding every way possible to make us order lots of food.\n\nWe came in a large group, and it was nice to have the back room, which had great decor and was separated from the noisiness of the rest of the restaurant.  However service was spotty; some people didn't always get their water refilled.\n\nThe main problem was that they kept convincing us to order more food.  Our initial judgment would have been fine, but because they were so adamant that it wouldn't be enough, we ordered more and in the end everyone was stuffed and we had a lot of leftovers.  The portions are big, so if you go in a group I suggest a ratio of 2 dishes for 3 people (assuming no one is ravenously hungry), and perhaps some appetizers for flair.\n\nWe also asked for rice, and they were sneaky in putting in an order of rice for EVERYONE.  We only finished a small fraction and took the rest to go after we found out how much they charged us for it.   \n\nThey were nice though, smiling and being courteous and all.  My chief complaint is the shady business.  \n\nPS This review is dedicated to the bday girl!  That alone should make 5 stars (but Yelp would vehemently oppose to that sort of criteria and this review would never see daylight again)", "author": "Edna C."}

The summer rolls were underwhelming, veggies tasted old and water logged. The Tom Kha soup was barely passable (trader Joe's has a better version), angel wings which used to be a specialty were less than mediocre but the worst was the BBQ pork. It was bright pink in places and tasted sour. The pieces were such a mish mash I wondered if it was garbage they accidentally served. We couldn't take anymore and sent the pork back.

And this meal did not disappoint at all! This definitely has to be one of the more under-rated Thai restaurants in the city. \n\nWhen you walk in, you can instantly sense the lovely aroma of Thai spices in the air, as the open-faced kitchen showcases the chefs at work. The restaurant isn't too big, but it's spacious enough to seat a copious amount of people comfortably. We came in on a Saturday afternoon, and seated immediately by a very welcoming staff. \n\nWe came here just to try their Angel Wings ($7.95), which served a hearty portion for an appetizer. It was lightly crisped on the outside, super moist and tender on the inside. It was lathered with a chili garlic sauce that was super tasty! And sprinkled with a couple basil leaves. Highly recommended\n\nWe also ordered the Coconut Stir-Fried Rice Noodles ($12.50), which were thin rice noodles made with coconut milk and a light tamarind sauce, that came with chicken, shrimp, and a lightly fried egg! It was deliciously tangy, and quite flavorful.\n\nLastly, we had the Stir-Fried Stewed Pork Belly ($12.50), with bamboo shoots, mushroom, & corn. The pork belly was super tender!

We made a fairly straightforward order, avacado salad from the specials menu, a soft tofu and chicken soup, vegetarian pad thai and a basa filet with the pepper & garlic sauce.  She and I are sure that\nwe not only clearly ordered avocado salad but we agreed heard the server confirm this in \nthe order readback (a good practice, assuming you get it right).  \n\nWe got the salad (papaya salad, it turns out) and I commented that there seemed to be a lot of vinaigrette -- the recipe must have changed.  The other half noted that it's way spicy for an avacado salad and sour from the dressing -- a bad combo for her digestives, she asserts.  The salad she had taken was still on her plate, I had gone through some of mine.  We requested a swap out (yes, the avocado salad costs more, but we expected that and told the wait person that).  The wait-person returned and said if we wanted a replacement, we'd have to pay for both salads (say what?  Were they hoping we spotted the error early so they could recycle the salad to some unsuspecting rube?).\n\nWe declined and had the (inedible for the other half) salad removed.  Yes, we were charged for the mostly uneaten salad.  And as much as I dislike service whinges, I now appreciate the negative impact on the rest of the dining experience... we just wanted to eat up, Shriners,  and get out of Dodge ASAP.\n\nOther differences caught our eyes as well... portion sizes seem to be smaller (less soup, less basa).  Something seems to have changed at a place we've enjoyed many times before;  our return is not so likely.

That about sums it up.\n\nI like that this Thai restaurant is small and intimate, and has a lot of beautiful and unique decorations that are specific to Thailand and done in a tasteful way (unlike a lot of \"hole-in-the-wall\" restaurants). Me and a friend decided to sit at the bar because there was no wait. This area actually turned out to be one of the better spots: because you can see the chefs cooking and there are these canisters filled with water and (fake, but still nice...) flowers. \n\nThe menu has a lot of selection and a good amount of the dishes have choice of meet. As expected with any Thai restaurant: a majority of the food is healthy without trying. This is always refreshing and ordering a salad here feels cool, because the salad has so many ingredients and also includes a bit of meet. I had the green papaya salad, by the way, which actually contains more noodles than greens, but was still extremely tasty and satisfying.\n\nMy friend ordered the pumpkin tofu curry, which was tasty and actually had a light sauce. This is my is my usually issue with curries, the heavy and thick sauce, and is why I ordered a salad. They commented that it is one of the best pumpkin curries they've had.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly and the prices are very reasonable (most Thai places are, anyway).

I did not see it at all on their menu, and I know that the other location on Irving has it, so I asked and they do make it here as well. Maybe that item was accidentally left off their menu at this location, since it's listed on their website as well. And at $8.95, it's actually fairly cheaper than a lot of other dishes on their menu.\n\nThe reason why I get excited about khao soy is because during college I went on a trip to Thailand, and in Chiang Mai my friends and I had khao soy for pretty much every meal since it's so delicious. It's not common to find it served in the US though so whenever I do find a place that has it, I will always order it.\n\nAnyway, this is a nice Thai restaurant in the Inner Sunset. Consider it a victory if you can find street parking within a few minutes. Despite being in a busy area, this place doesn't really have as many patrons as a lot of the other spots nearby so it wasn't that difficult to get seating. Compared to its other location, this place has a nicer atmosphere, but fewer seats.\n\nThe food is the same as the Irving location. Angel wings is a popular appetizer. They say it's spicy, but the sauce they use for it is barely spicy at all, which I actually prefer. Aside from the typical pad thai and pad seew you can find at any, this place serves a variety of other Thai rice and noodle dishes. Just read the menu to find out the differences between the items. I found the service to be very nice and helpful in explaining the differences in their dishes.\n\nI definitely recommend this place if you're in the area and craving Thai food, but if you don't want to deal with the headache of parking around here, you can check out their other branch too. But I personally found this one to be nicer.", "author": "Allen C."}

After that, however, they took about 20 min to charge the bill. Once we got the check the gratuity didn't match what they had originally written on the receipt.

It came time for lunch, so I looked to my Yelp app and found this restaurant close by. We walked over and were handed both menus and the specials. This is what we ordered:\nCalamari salad - grilled marinated calamari with flavorful veggies and a vinaigrette dressing, the calamari was cooked perfectly and was very fresh\nCoconut curry noodles - vermicelli noodles, with chicken, shrimp, & vegetables. The sauce was similar to pad Thai but less sweet with an added mild curry coconut flavor, it was fantastic!\nChicken satay wraps - these were a Thai version of lettuce wraps, the dish came with butter lettuce as the wrap, with satay chicken skewers, a cucumber salad, vermicelli noodles, bean sprouts, cilantro, Thai basil, and peanut sauce. This dish was also very good, try it if you can!\n\nPortion size was generous, the service was attentive, and prices were reasonable.

One reviewer from Check Please was so thrilled about this place that it ended up in my bookmarks for months.\n\nOverall, I think Marnee deserves its recognition as one of the better Thai spots in San Francisco, though some level of inconsistency is making me hold back that final star; well above average, but not the best.\n \nThe best part about Marnee is the menu, which features a diverse array of creative and affordable dishes - $8 on average and about $12-$14 for specials. \n\nDishes arrived fast, but really could have been warmer.  The Angel Wings were great.  Though the meat could have been more tender, the sauce had a tremendous amount of garlic kick and the overall flavor was more sweet (perhaps too sweet) than spicy.  \n\nThe highlight of the meal was the mango fried rice...probably the best fried rice dish I've had.  The sweet mango flavor complemented the hint of saltiness of the rice.  Love it.   The mango salad with soft shell crab was also all sorts of amazing and the mangoes and salad leaves were fresh...the soft shell crab was not to be missed.\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the Tom Ka soup, though I realize that it's one of the more popular items.  Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the fried banana w/ coconut ice cream dessert - a dessert I always order.  The bananas were dry, dry, dry and overcooked, plus the coconut ice cream was way too creamy, that it didn't really melt into the fried bananas.  The bananas were also on the cool side.  In retrospect, I should have ordered the sticky rice.\n\nI'm not sure I'll be back.  The Inner Sunset area is full of amazing choices.  But I'm glad that I finally had the chance to try this place.", "author": "Angel S."}

Got seated pretty quickly and had our order in before several other parties came in.\n\nThe two things that stood out as to why this place is getting 1.5 stars (rounded up to two) is:\n- Our food took longer than it should to come out. Parties who ordered after us had their food come out much more quicker than ours. It doesn't take too long to make curry and fried noodles and the place wasn't so busy that servers couldn't take orders, so why was there a long delay? My friend flat out told the server that our food still haven't arrived and he needed to move his car because it was parked in a time restricted area. Maybe two minutes after he left, our food came, with our server apologizing.\n- The check. What I noticed while I was paying for the bill was that what I received initially was not the same after my card was swiped. The only reason why I caught this is because I was going to tip them the 15% tip, since the food wasn't bad and saw the 15% tip was around $4. After I got back my card and the slip to sign off, the 15% tip suggestion was up to $5. No, no and no. I only tip the price of all the food we were served, not the taxes that I had to pay along with it. I didn't mention this to the restaurant because this was something within my control, that I was able to control the tip amount, so I wrote down the original tip I was planning to give them. \n\nWith that said, please check all your receipts before tipping, and don't be shy to tell your server that your food is taking longer than usual to come to your table.", "author": "Tom T."}

The chicken wings and beers were quick to serve within 6min; the chicken wings were just ok, too much sauce for our taste, didn't wow us. \n\nNow, started at this point, we were just sitting there and watching other tables getting their food and eating, we had NO FOOD after that chicken wings at 7:40pm! My husband was pissed because our friends' kids started getting really hungry; he located our server and asked when we will get our food, or we'll leave if takes too long, server said she'll check and get back to us. Another 15min passed by, server didn't come back to us with any update at all! So my husband went to the front and said that we're done, just charge us the wings and beers; server finally came to our table to apologize and said no charge to us on the wings and beers as apology and said that kitchen was busy... well, we told her that other tables who came later than us were eating and in fact, almost done with eating their food! Right before we left, server added \"are you sure you guys don't want any food, I can ask the chef to cook them for you right now.\" Seriously?! Did you not do that when we first asked at 7:40pm?! Ridiculous! \n\nSo we ended up leaving the restaurant at 8:15pm and we didn't have much time choosing another decent restaurant since they all close at 9:00pm (mostly); hence, we just chose whatever was opened nearby.

The curry mousse is nothing I've ever had before and it is so smooth and melts in your mouth. The flavor is excellent. Not too spicy and the snapper is very smooth as well. I love the presentation.

And if I were to give it a rating based on that, it would be five stars. \n\nThe two star rating is because of the customer service. \n\nI've been here twice. The first time was great; a couple friends came to SF to visit and we decided to try out Marnee Thai. We were all astounded by the quality of the food so we agreed that before they left, we would have our last meal at the same place so they can take some home. Our second visit had less than adequate service, and is the reason that I will not be coming back. \n\nThe service was very slow, which was surprising because it wasn't as busy as the first time we were there. We had been sitting for approximately 10-15 minutes before I tried to call the waiter, in which she responded \"yeah I know hold on\". She proceeded to talk to her coworker and laugh for another couple minutes before taking our order. Her attitude was very \"stand off-ish\". She consistently gave us the cold shoulder. When I said thank you, she hardly replied. The only commendable thing she did for us was refilling our waters, which she only did a couple times without asking. When we left, we provided her with a 10% tip. As I exited, she approached my friends and exclaimed that we \"didn't tip her enough\". That's where my frustration grew. Tips aren't handed out - tips are earned. They are earned through friendliness and good service, none of which she provided. I was surprised that she had the audacity to claim that she deserved more with the mediocre service she provided. \n\nNever have I ever been approached by waitress with so much attitude, demanding more than she deserved. \n\nMarnee Thai was an amazing restaurant, but my server, Ying, is the main reason I will advise against this establishment.", "author": "Jessica V."}

There are so many variations to this dish and is always different at every place I go to. But overall the flavor was good. So good that my boyfriend kept eating my dish more than his own! They ended up giving my brother duck instead of chicken and when we told them, they weren't very nice about it. He was nice enough to not ask them to remake the dish and just asked for a side of chicken. But the waiter was a little rude about it. \n\nGreen Curry: It tasted like any other green curry. Nothing too special, but still a good dish. \n\nSpicy squid (Don't remember the actual name): Very good dish! The squid was cooked very well. It was soft and tender. Great flavor without being too salty. \n\nCoconut water: Thought they would give you fresh coconut water, but they don't. The drink was way too sweet.

The tables are all close to one another, so be ready to hear whatever other conversations are going on around you, for better or worse.\n\nOn to the food. I got the vegetarian red curry and brown rice. The curry was delicious-just the right medium kick to it. The actual vegetables seemed fresh and were colorful and of good quality-this included zucchini, broccoli, baby corn and a nice mix of peppers. AND they didn't skimp on the red and green peppers like some other Thai places do. I was slightly disappointed in the tofu that came in the dish-there were only 3 pieces in it and they were a little oily. However the curry itself and the veggies were so good, it more than made up for it.\nMy boyfriend got some kind of sweet and sour chicken, sharing my brown rice.

So imagine my surprise when he asked to have it for dinner.\n\nWe started out with the Avocado salad which is pricey given it only had 3 prawns.  I couldn't taste the fried shallots or the toasted coconut but I did like the spicy dressing.  We then went on to the Hung Lay curry.  This is the only curry that didn't have coconut milk.  The pork belly was really tender & the curry was flavorful.  I know many people hate pineapple in savory dishes but the pineapple chunks in this dish were delicious as it soaked up the flavor of the curry.  In fact, i tis the pineapple that got the Boyfriend craving Thai food (we've had it once before).  We also had a Pad phed with chicken which was really spicy.  We finished with a Roti with coconut ice cream which was divine.  The ice cream was not too sweet, super creamy, & had chunks of coconut meat inside.

Our boy never had Thai food before so we wanted to introduce him to this cuisine.  We happened to be in the Sunset and I remember from YEARS (at least 15) ago that I went to Marnee Thai.  We were nearby, found parking... this could be a bit difficult. \n\nWhen you enter thru the doors, you are immediately hit with the fragrance of cooked Jasmine Rice....sooooo yummy.  We were greeted warmly and seated immediately...HINT....get there around 6ish (this was Thursday night).  Line starts forming around 6:30 - 7ish.\n\nThe only negative....they brought cold water to the table, after taking our orders...my wife asked for hot water (cold night outside)...the brought her the hot water, but took away the cold water....kind of strange there.\n\nThe waiter was really friendly and helpful.\n\nAngle Wings (Appetizer) $7.95\nThe wings were of deep fried, no batter, this made the wings really crispy without being heavy.  It was then smothered in a chili sauce.  We ordered it mild, but that was bit too spicy for the child.  The wings were meaty and juicy...just watch out, wait till they cool a bit before biting in...first hand experience here.\n\nAvocado Salad with Soft Shell Crab $12.95\nThe salad consisted of thinly sliced avocado strings (young fruit) over a bed of lettuce with fried soft shell crab sitting on top.  The vinaigrette was both sweet and tangy...this was a really good dish.\n\nMango Fried Rice with Duck $11.95\nThis was on the daily special menu, you can also order with chicken or beef or prawns...but I like slight gaminess of duck that seem to lend itself to sweet fruits like mango.  Most places chop up the duck or you have to actually hunt for it....here the pieces were large and generous...you can identify the individual ingredients of this dish.  This is a must order dish if you like to duck or want to try it.\n\nOK - 3 people...1 salad, 1 appetizer, 1 main course...still hungry?  We wanted to share and just try a sampling without going over board...this actually held us over pretty well...we had to save room for DESSERT!!\n\nSticky Rice with Mango $5.50\nThe rice was cooked in either cane sugar or another sweetener...yummy!!  The mangos were not mushy and was a good contrast to the rice.  Need to eat this right away, do not give the rice a chance to sit around too long.  The rice was warm, if it got a bit colder, the kernels become a bit toothy.\n\nSticky Black Rice with Coconut Ice Cream $5.25\nTrust me!! If you like to try a dessert out of the ordinary...this is the dish for you.  The rice is black (looks like wild rice), it was cooked in the same sweet concoction as the rice for the Rice and Mango dish.  For this one, if you can resist, let the ice cream melt a bit before digging in.\n\nThe Restroom:\nThey only had a single unisex room.  The room is clean and well maintained, however the waste paper basket needed to be emptied and the walls could use a new paint job though, there was some chipping towards the bottom.\n\nOverall my wife would have given this place 2 thumbs up...if she could have stopped eating the Black Rice Dessert.", "author": "Jerry W."}

I'm not a papaya fan but my girl loves it, and since she said she loved the spiciness level on the salad, then it must be good. I had myself a bite or two as well and it was blazing good.\n\n2. The angel wings are also a must-get if you dine here. The wings are smothered with a tangy spicy sauce and the chicken is very meaty. Wing restaurants need to get some tips from here, freal.\n\n3. The presentation of the beef curry looked disappointing [see picture] but it did not scar the flavor of the beef. The beef was very tender and soaked in the curry sauce. However, they served it on a plate (dunno why) so there was no room for any actually curry..\n\n4. We ended our meal with some roti over a scope of coconut ice cream.

Ultimately, it was a tasty meal but we just wanted the salad to have a bit more acid/vinegar and a lot more spice. Despite the fact that we asked the waitress for our salad to be spicy, it was extremely mild. \n\nAlthough we've had pad kee mao here in the past and have loved it, we wanted to try a different spicy noodle and went with the chan pad poo from recommendation by the waitstaff. This dish was decent with a medium spiciness and a heavy seafood aroma from the little bits of crab meat (no chunks).\n\nOverall, considering we set 2 stars to be \"average food,\" this place is well above average and had ranged from a 3 to 4 depending on what you order.

Their Panang Curry is nothing like all the other restaurants'. It was the best Panang Curry I have ever had. Make sure you get this with Beef. I also like their Angel Wings. It rivals San Tung's hot wings. \n\nThis is seriously the best Thai Food EVER!", "author": "Iya J."}

We had gotten Gordo's which is right next door, but we wanted to check this place out when it was a litttttle less busy. \n\nFood:\nSpicy Angel Wings: I had actually seen that many people had gotten this on yelp so we decided to try them. They were not too spicy, a little for the flavor. They were hot temperature wise though; I think I might have given myself a little burn from it. Definitely worth trying. \nMango Fried Rice with Chicken: BF's dish. It was pretty good. The mango had a nice flavor - almost cinnamon like and the fried rice...well it was just fried rice. Nothing too amazing or bad about it. \nPad See-ew with Chicken: my dish. Nothing too amazing about it.  I guess when I go to Thailand I'll be able to have some authentic stuff to compare all of these to. It's not amazing, but not horrible either. \n\nI had noticed that the chef apparently won quite a few awards and the restaurant seems pretty well known from its awards and notable mentions in various magazines and stuff, but it's really not that amazing.\n\nIt was really just a great spot for us to try a new place and get some lunch.

Unfortunately, the wings fell short of my expectations. San Tung's wings remain my top choice for wings in SF. They were still very delicious, but just not amazing. I would rank this as a good second choice to San Tung. The misleading raves from my friend aside, I really did enjoy the wings. The sauce was good, mildly spicy (barely detectable, really), but definitely the basil added an extra kick. \n\nThe mango fried rice left a lot to be desired. I would probably not recommend this dish, but it could be because I went here when mangoes weren't in season. As a lover of nearly all things mango, this is definitely not on my list. I would probably not order this again. \n\nFor a 1hr wait on a Saturday night, I don't think it was worth it.

They were closed for 48 hours, and cleared all re-inspection issues before reopening. I normally wouldn't go back so soon but my friends and I have been eating here for years and we've never had a problem with our food or the cleanliness of it. \n\nSo now onto the food:\n\nAngel Wings-Must try if it's your first time, these aren't the traditional stuffed wings that a lot of Thai restaurants offer. It's their own sauce that they make.\n\nHomemade Hotcakes-These were a really interesting appetizer, they came with 7 pieces so they're good for sharing too. They're not as big as Hotcakes you're probably used to, but they're a good size to try without getting too full.\n\nPad Kee Mao with Duck-My friend loves duck and spicy food so this was his choice and we all tried some when it came. The flavors of the noodles really complimented the duck well. With the tomato and basil balancing nicely with the sauce. \n\nChan Pad Poo-Step yo Pad Thai game up, son! No but really, these noodles are a crab rendition of Pad Thai with Garlic and Chili. We had them mild but you can ask to make them hotter too.\n\nPanang Beef-The Panang Beef came out with less curry than we expected but afterwards we realized it was because it's a stewed curry dish. There were chunks of beef that were slow cooked in the curry sauce, they have a pork version as well on the specials page.\n\nBasa with Garlic and Black Pepper sauce-White fish with a light flavor to it which was really good with the garlic pepper sauce they made. If you like garlic, you will definitely like this dish.\n\nWe had a decent amount of food but still managed to clear it all without any leftovers.

She is so sweet, recommends what you should get, and just creates this comfortable happy atmosphere. Yeah, you guys should know who I'm talking about if you've been there. \nIt is a pretty small place so make sure you are ready to stand outside in the cold for a few minutes. They serve fast and provide good service so I assume the turn around is relatively quick. But, because it was so packed, the mom kept pushing our tables this way and that way to get as much walk space. It was a little awkward but whatever!\n\n1) Imperial rolls: GOOD. The fried skin is very thin so it creates a very crunchy but not oily taste to the roll. Inside is vermicelli, beef, and veggies. Very good start with the sweet and spicy sauce!\n2) Yellow curry: Very flavorful and SOOOO generous with their meat! However, they only include the meat and potatoes which makes it very filling. A few peas sprinkled in. I kind of wanted some veggies in there too.\n3) Chan Pad Poo: SIGH...at first we got this because of the name (childish we are...ahem gaj!) but it turned out to be SUPER GOOD!!!

Both times were fair experiences - some pretty good tasting food although I think could still be raised to an even greater level. \n\nFirst, the spicy angel tofu - deep fried crispy tofu sauteed with chili-garlic sauce, top with crispy basil. This was delicious! The tofu was so crisp and a bit chewy on the outside, with the sweet sauce completely coating each piece with a burst of flavor in each bite. The flavor is quite intense and the crispy basil adds a nice lightness and aroma. Highly recommended!\n\nThen, spicy ma kuer - sauteed eggplant with mushroom, fried tofu, baby corn, bell pepper, chili, garlic and Thai basil. I love eggplant so I enjoyed this, although the flavor wasn't as bright and satisfying as that of the tofu appetizer. The eggplant was very well cooked though, with the perfect soft texture, but not too mushy and falling apart.\n\nWe also got the pad se - ew with chicken - fried rice noodles with soy bean, broccoli and egg. I thought the flavor could have been taken up a notch on this. I would have also liked to see slightly thicker, chewier noodles that were slightly more charred, or with a more intense sauce coating it. The chicken could have been more juicy and tender as well.\n\nFinally, we got the roasted duck - roasted boneless duck on a bed of spinach with homemade special sauce. The duck was very tender and juicy, although with a thick layer of fat and soggy skin on top which was not appetizing. The duck itself had a strong duck flavor, which sounds strange as it seems duck should have duck flavor. However, this duck had it in a slightly unappetizing, game-y, not so fresh kind of way.

As a child, growing up\nin California, it was a steady diet of Chinese cuisine, occasionally\ninterspersed with a sprinkle of Japanese or Korean fare.  It wasn't\nuntil I headed off to the Midwest for four years that I tried Thai\nfood for the first time.\n\nAmidst the chilly winters and a dearth of decent Chinese food, I\nbranched out and discovered my first Thai restaurant, Thai Bistro, a 45 minute drive from where I lived, but so worth the wonderfully flavored and comforting food that subtly reminded me of the Asian cuisine I had grown up with.\n\nWhen I returned home, I continued my exploration into Thai\ncuisine, finding standouts Krung Thai (San Jose), King of Thai (SF) and even traveling to Thailand several times.  Which all finally led me to\nMarnee Thai.\n\nWhile I love King of Thai for the quick meal, Marnee Thai was\nalways the choice for the more planned sit-down meal; whether for out-of-town guests, family, or friends.\n\nThe stars at Marnee Thai are the delectable angel wings (they give San\nTung a run for the money), the curry dishes, and the addictive noodle dish, crab chan pad poo.\n\nWorking with Executive Chef Chai Siriyarn, I created a menu for a large group dinner that included these favorites and several of his\nrecommendations.  While a few of the dishes didn't translate as well\nto large portions (the panang beef was a tad overcooked, the basa\nfillet was just so-so), in the end, there was a ton of food, happy\nand very stuffed patrons, and a perfect finish with sticky black rice and mango.\n\nService was attentive throughout the night and the flexibility of Chai with both the menu and the allocated budget were duly appreciated. \n\nAn enthusiastic two thumbs up!

We were all vegetarian on this day and found quite a few appealing dishes on the menu once we accepted that they will all have tofu. The appetizer vegetable roll was just right but not great. Then the yellow curry, veg fried rice and mango-pineapple tofu were simply fantastic. We followed up by string beans that were absolutely bursting with flavor! They were able to make the food mild for kids in the group yet did not compromise on the spices and flavor. I recommend this pace and would definitely come back again.", "author": "A J."}

Also, they are rude. Case in point, my friend and I were meeting for dinner and he was finding parking in GGP in San Francisco. I asked them if I could sit as I  would like to reserve a table as my friend found parking. Unfortunately this concept was lost on them and they refused to sit me until \"your whole party arrives\". This is the type of tourist trapping nonsense I would expect in the marina, the pier, or the now gentrified mission, however not in the Sunset district, a place for true local San Franciscans.  As a result, my friend who only arrived 10 min. later, and myself, had to wait while people who came in later than us and hadn't reserved were sat. \n\nSo in summary, bland food and rude employees that just want to profit of tourists.", "author": "Martino P."}

I was just never impressed with other restaurants I've tried. \n\nBut Marnee Thai excited my taste buds. One thing I loved and appreciated is the fact that the staff is aware of what \"gluten-free\" means. Almost all of their menu items can be made gluten-free, except for their curries which contain soy sauce. Some of their fried appetizers are also wheat-free since they use a gluten-free flour blend to coat appetizers such as the Angel Wings. \n\nThere was a bit of confusion on separate occasions I've dined here. On my first visit, the owner assured me that what I ordered (Beef Pad Thai and Angel Wings) were gluten-free; then on another visit, I double-checked with my waiter and he said the appetizers contain gluten. I came in a third time and the owner was present again, I communicated my concerns and he again assured me that the Angel Wings were gluten-free. \n\nI feel so relieved eating at a restaurant that is knowledgable and accommodating of gluten allergies. It's such a pain calling other restaurants over the phone to ask about gluten-free items and all I hear on he other end is \"Free? You want a free meal?\" Hahaha, you don't have to worry about that here.", "author": "Juliette R."}

The first seating area is in a very intimate setting..mainly for small parties, couples. There is another room for larger parties in the back. \n\nThey were pretty busy, but we still got very good service. \n\nSo we started off with a new item on the menu, an appetizer:\nPotstickers, filled with pork and green curry. They were cooked just right..not too soggy or burnt, with the perfect amount of crisp! But as soon as I got taste of the spiciness level I made sure to ask for the main entrees to be extra spicy. I'd say it was an equivalent to a mild. \n\nFor our main entree we ordered:\nPAD THAI:\nThis was my favorite dish! Although it wasn't as spicy as I would prefer... I added a bunch of crushed red peppers and bam! Delicious. The sauce was savory and sweet, which complimented the spices. The chicken was proportionate to the amount of noodles. Perfect amount of veggies! I wish I could eat this dish again. The noodles were nice and chewy, not too thin. \n\n\nTHAI FRIED RICE:\nThe thai fried rice was average. It was similar to white jasmine rice with some veggies in it. Still good. \n\nKANG DANG CURRY (RED CURRY):\nThe red curry was good. Had to add some more crushed peppers...but after yum yum in my tum tum. Coconut milk bamboo shoot heaven. \n\nThai iced tea for desert... and my stomach was very pleased!\n\n\nOverall food was really good, just wasn't feeling the spice.

I made a reservation for a few months ago but when I showed up with my group of 6, the lady said that they didn't have my reservation on the books. Fast forward to today, I gave the place another try. I showed up at 6:30 without a reservation and were seated right away. \n\nFor appetizer, we ordered the corn cakes.  This item was highly recommended on Check Please and I liked that it was a novel item, as not many places offer it. I really liked it, it was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The little corn kernels gave it a good texture too. Don't forget to pair it with the sweet-n-sour cucumber salad that comes with it, adds an extra dimension of flavor.\n\nFor the main courses, we ordered a pad Thai, the duck in red curry, and the gai samoon prai (saut\u00e9ed sliced chicken with onions & lemongrass, wild ginger, peppercorns and Thai basil). The pad Thai was a bit on the sour side and not quite to my taste, although the rice noodles were perfectly cooked and had a nice bite to it. The curry and sauteed chicken were just OK, nothing all that different from every other Thai restaurant that I've been to.\n\nThe food here is good, but simply did not live up to my expectations. I somewhat hoped for a more exotic menu than the run of the mill Thai places. I didn't save room for dessert, but looks like that's where a lot of the stand out items were, especially the sweet roti.

She had little patience for dawdling so she ordered for us. Good thing, because it was BETTER than any Thai food I've had before.\n\nIt's easy to fall into a routine with Thai food.  You walk in thinking of the dishes you've tried before.  This is the perfect place to not do that.  Why? Because there is NOT ONE bad dish on the menu.  Ask questions, take suggestions, be adventurous.  Our favorite dish was a green bean dish, but who gives a fuck!?! Your server will have the spiritual intuition to suggest a bomb dish, and you will have the salivatory wherewithal to order it.\n\nIcing on this epic cake is that the owner spent some time at our table telling me about my future.  First she guessed that I was younger than my sister (which isn't SUPER impressive considering I've got a straight-up tween face) and that I had a major breakup recently.  She told me I would have two man options within the year, but that I shouldn't be hasty.  Without showing my hand, let me say she was write on BOTH counts.\n\nShe then told my sister and I some things about our personalities that were amazingly insightful.  \n\nTHEN without any request, May turned off the lights and some servers brought out coconut ice cream with a candle in it.

The restaurant was pretty much empty. Some of my guests had problems finding parking, and they were a little late. I was thinking it was a little odd when the waiter kept asking me if I was ready for the food. I still had many guests missing, so of course I was not ready for the food!

And just to emphasize, at no point did I tell them I was ready for the food to come out. Also, he was cooking for 15 people, not 500.\nAll the dishes were cold when they got to the table. The eggplant looked like dog food. The wings were worse then the ones you get frozen. Fried rice was greasy.

We used to eat here a lot but after this last meal, I doubt we'll be returning ever again.\n\nThey are listed on Caviar so I know that this should be prefaced with it being a delivery order. However, our food was delivered in less than 45 minutes and my comments aren't anything like \"our food was cold, etc.\"\n\nBoth of our curry dishes were indedible. Completely 100% flavorless and without any spice whatsoever. A total joke. We ordered the Panang Curry and Massuman. My husband and I were just in shock. The white and brown rice weren't even jasmine - looked and tasted like standard, bland, boxed Uncle Ben's type rice. Shame on you, Marnee Thai! The ONLY thing that was good were their Angel Wings.\n\nSome of our friends that live in Inner Sunset say that Marnee has been going downhill. Maybe their closing due to health code violations? Hmmmmm. Makes you wonder. Sad. I used to love this place and even had the owner sign the cookbook he wrote when we were there after our wedding :(", "author": "Corri C."}

The waitress repeated my order correctly then delivered the wrong items and indignantly stated she repeated the order to me when placed and refused to restitute her error. The food was no better than I could have prepared at home, in fact worse but overall extremely average. I didn't mind she messed up the order, I like all Thai dishes but the freshness and flavor of the Tom Yum Gai soup, Masaman and Panang curries tasted as though prepared by Mexican nationals rather than Thai cooks.

Plus they totally forgot about us at the end.\nI was with two boys, and they decided they were starving, so we got a lot of dishes. \n\nWe ordered: \n\nSpicy Angel Wings - they weren't especially spicy, but had a nice flavor. They were pretty decent sized (not skimping on the wings), but they were too fried for me. I would go for the Korean Wings at Ssissoo before these. But the boys really liked them.\n\nLarb Salad - the flavor on the lettuce was good. The meat was nothing outstanding (once compared to the flavor of all the other dishes, but there was nothing wrong with the flavor)\n\nPad Prig Pao (chicken) - My dish. Delicious! The sauce was very good, and the flavors were STRONG. This is definitely more than \"just Thai food\". The spices they use are quality and it definitely shows.\n\nSimmered Panang Pork Curry (red) - A special. Oh my goodness. I don't even like curry with coconut milk or cream. But this pork is heavenly! This cubed-cuts of meat that were so tender it seemed like they had been slowly simmering for HOURS!\n\nStir-fried stewed pork belly - the sauce on this dish was by far the best. So interesting, with deep earthy flavors. The pork belly was actually NOT the most favorite pork belly I have ever had (Seemed like the fat:meat ratio was off a bit), but the sauce was amazing.\n\nThis is definitely the kind of restaurant where you have to have rice because you can't mix any of your dishes! The flavor of each dish is so unique, and SO GOOD, that you don't want to mess it up by mixing different dishes together. That would be a waste of sauce!\n\nI had their hot tea, which was also delicious. We even asked what kind of tea it was because it was so good (Thai Red tea, btw).\n\nThe bf got a Thai Iced Tea, which I usually stay away from (the whole cream thing), but it was yummy yummy, and even came with an extra pour of cream on top for presentation (but I didn't even let him mix it in, I took the top part!)\n\nAll in all, this place is amazing.

The space is much more narrow - and packed, even on a Tuesday night! At first I was apprehensive of the long line of couples and groups waiting to be seated. However, the wait staff was able to clear some tables very quickly, and we were seated in no time.\n\nWe ordered the angel wings appetizer, satay special, green curry with prawns, and two sides of rice. The angel wings were fantastic! A little bit messy to eat, but very flavorful without being spicy. The satay and green curry were both great as well. It was clearly too much food between only me and my friend. \n\nMy only criticism is the attentiveness of the wait staff. Although they are great at seating people quickly, it often takes a long time to order, receive the food, box up leftovers and get the check. I think we were there for over two hours. It's a small price to pay for a great Thai meal, though.", "author": "Alyssa W."}

Ok, that should've been my warning to leave but we were already seated, hungry, and didn't have a lot of time. The chicken had absolutely no flavor. I've had many, many peanut sauces from different Thai restaurants and this was the worse. Though you could see the peanuts, there was no peanut taste. How is that possible?\n\nChicken with red curry. I love curry, specially red curry but what the heck was this? Tasted like hidden ginger delight, the ginger was so overpowering that it knock the curry out. I have no idea what the white slivered stuff was. Maybe bamboo shoots? Jicama? I don't know but it was awful.\n\nPork chop, this was the best of the 3 dishes.

We had reservations made for two at 9pm and got seated immediately even though we were about 5 or so minutes late.  Thank goodness we had reservations because there were some people waiting in line and it was a packed house.\n\nUpon being seated we were pour some water with a slice of lime in it. I don't know why, but there's something about good sprucing up water with the simplest things such as mint leaves or lemons.  I love it and it really makes the experience of eating out a little bit extra special. heh \n\nAnyways, we had ordered our food and the staff was just amazing.  Our waitress, Patty? and another guy named Kevin were really great and came to check on us to make sure we were having a good experience. Good customer service = thumbs up! \n\nNow, the food was just deliciousness!!! We ordered the Pad See Ew, Eggplant something and Pork curry.  All of these dishes were made just right and between me and my friend I would say that we killed it leaving only a little bit left. \n\nEggplant: I typically don't prefer eating vegetables, but was recommended to try this by my friend and it was surprisingly good. \n\nThe Pad See Ew was just absolutely flavorful. Most Thai places I feel offer this since it's a common customer selection/favorite, however, it's always lacking in flavor. They always look good and alike, but once you take a bite out of the noodles you realize it's pretty bland.  Marnee Thai did a good job with ensuring that there was flavor in every bite :)!\n \nLastly, the pork curry. OMFGggGG.. IT was just sooo tender and the sauce, though a bit spicy, was damn frigging good. I would have to say this was my favorite out of the others. \n\nThe only thing was that parking is a bit hard, but we ended up closer to the Golden Gate Park where parking is free and easier to find.

Basically if you order anything, you will be satisfied. Walk into the restaurant and you'll find yourself standing next to a wall of impressive accolades and reviews on one side and the busting and noisy kitchen on the other side. It's a cozy, narrow restaurant that is always packed so plan accordingly or make reservations.\n\nThe food here is incredible - the noodles, fried rice, appetizers, and curries are delicious and full of flavor. As long as you're a fan of Thai cuisine, you'll find yourself overwhelm by the number of options to choose from whether you're looking for a spicy dish or a savory dish. Some of my favorites: Pad Kee Mao, Pad Se-Ew, Fried Rice with roasted duck (definitely a must - that duck is incredible), Green Curry with chicken, and Papaya Salad, and the Ma Kuer (sauteed eggplant dish)! That curry sauce can literally be poured onto any of the other dishes and it will taste good.\n\nI think what makes this place great is the atmosphere and the simple pleasures of eating really really good Thai food.

I come to visit San Francisco from Minnesota where we have decent Thai food (if you know where to get it - Bankok Thai on University if you're ever in St. Paul) and love to try out my current favorites at Marnee Thai. This time the food did not disappoint but the service was a bit lackluster. They are usually so quick and speedy with quality food but the service was beyond slow this day. (Sunday night,  around 7)\n\nNormally when I've gone with my cousin (always just two of us) we have been able to be seated right away even though the places is always packed (good sign in my book). No different today but when we ordered an appetizer of simple summer rolls and nearly 25 mins went by we had to ask where they were.  The waiter apologized saying he got our table mixed up with a table that had ordered the same thing but had a peanut allergy (Which if you have a peanut allergy what are you doing in a Thai place?!) Anyway, the rolls were delicious as usual and their in house peanut sauce is amazing. \n\nAnother 20 mins and we finally had our food. \n\nMine- A red curry with veggies, tofu and shrimp.  It's worth noting here that even though I specifically ordered the \"Veggie Red Curry\" listed under vegetarian options which comes WITH tofu and has more vegetables listed than their normal curries - I was still charged extra for two proteins.  $3.00 for the tofu and $4.00 for the shrimp (which i was expecting but did not expect to be charged for the tofu since it was included in the dish description). In total my curry was nearly $20 of the total bill with the side of rice to go along. NOTE: you have to order the rice separate, it does not come with your meal. But it was great. Just enough heat to make your nose itch but not too much to overpower the veggies (mini corn, mushrooms, carrots, pea pods, broccoli, cauliflower, red pepper). \n\nPineapple fried rice was delicious as usual and not a spec was left on the plate. \n\nWe did again, have to ask the waiter for our bill. Which seemed odd since there was now a line out the door for tables. And our waiter seemed to be helping every table along the wall row of seating.  Perhaps they were understaffed but he was overloaded with tables. \n\nOverall: Food is always good - service this time was a little subpar", "author": "Alisha H."}

No WOW factor here to mention. My friend insisted on trying the Mango Sticky rice for dessert. When we saw the plate, I almost wanted to hit his forehead with the spoon. Nothing special...bottom line. \n\n+For the service, like most typical Asian restaurants, communication level is at a limited capacity. I believe they do try to accommodate all but sometimes it doesn't come across that way though. I was actually double charged when i checked my credit account. I'm still in the process of trying to resolve this with Marnee since last time I called them and spoke with the person who double charged me on my account. He was brave enough to call me right back and informed me that he'd be working on this. So, stay tune, I will update on this. \n\nAll in all.....It's all just a big hype.....", "author": "TTK H."}

Awesome food, but my favorite in SF is still Ler Ros Thai in Hayes Valley. Of course the angel wings were a must order and they did not disappoint. So great. Then we tried the soft shell crab and mango salad (awesome), mango fried rice, penang beef curry (skip this), ground pork pad kra pao (awesome, although we asked for it with a fried egg and they gave us the egg all alone on a separate plate....), and finally we tried the pad thai (which on the menu it was described differently and called something else so we had no idea until it arrived at the table that it was freaking pad thai! Although this version came with crab which was nice.) We of course had to end the meal with some mango and sticky rice, a great end to a great meal.

It seems like there's a Thai joint on every corner there, but nobody can capture flavor like this place. \nFirst off, the cuisine is specifically Siamese and they use traditional cooking methods and ingredients for truly authentic Thai food. I love that they offer a variety of vegan entree options. The fried eggplant dish (Spicy Ma Kuer) is amazing. It's cooked perfectly and you can taste the freshness of the eggplant. The tofu with spicy chili, garlic, and Thai basil is one of the best. Its fried perfectly on the outside and creamy on the inside. \nIf you're in the area I highly recommend this nice little spot.

Alas, no.\n\nIn general, I found the food to be nothing special.  Chicken satay was just ok, peanut sauce nothing special, and my favorite dish, Musamun Curry, usually made with beef chunks but here with chicken, was probably the worst I've ever had.  Musamun is not an easy dish to find in SF, it's a Southern Thailand regional dish and only a select few carry it.  This one did not have the right flavor, too much oil, not enough chicken, and the chicken it did have was pretty gross dark meat (sorry I'm a white meat snob -- but even this dark meat did not look great upon further inspection), the potatoes were overcooked and one of the main attractions of the dish, peanuts cooked in the sauce, were greatly lacking.  And it took WAY too long for the food. \n\nSometimes I'll go back to Thai restaurants I wasn't bowled over with the first time to try some of my other favorites like Tom Kha Gai soup and Pad Thai, but at this point there was just too much disappointment, and there are too many others Thai restaurants to try -- like the one up the street on the other side of Irving from this one.  \n\nI agree - the staff is very nice and very hardworking, and I even like the narrow, cozy interior.

I myself don't mind spicy food, but this was overwhelming. I had to take breaks.

The other couple arrived earlier than us, so they snagged a table before the lines got long around 6pm on Saturday. \n\nWe were seated all the way in the back. Service was so very slow, it took forever for someone to come by and take our order- it was busy but still!. Then we watched waiters come in with food, hoping it would be ours, but it was served to all the other tables but ours. 45 minutes later our food finally came. 45 minutes?! Maybe after 30 minutes of waiting, the waiter came by saying our entrees were on the way but they got backed up. Seemed weird especially since everyone in the back room had left except for our table and a table of 3 sitting next to us also waiting on their food. \n\nOn to the food. I can't vouch for the other couple's food, but as for me and the boy, we shared the Tom Ka and a tofu panang curry. Tom Ka was decent- we had it with vegetables and tofu. Slightly salty for my taste and pricey for the portion. The tofu curry I would never order again. The fried tofu was just deflated and the sauce was pretty oily and was different from all the other panang curries I've had before. Didn't seem creamy at all and was pretty bland. They put steamed broccoli on the side- I thought they'd add some veggies or something in the curry itself. So considering all of that it was not worth the $10.95. Usually tofu dishes are cheaper than meat dishes, but this dish was the most expensive thing on the receipt. Really?! $11 for tofu, bland sauce, and some steamed broccoli? The portion was so freaking small too!\n\nTook another 15-20 minutes just to get the bill- and it wasn't even thaaat busy.\n\nDisappointing experience.

We  did not get good service on prior visits and decided to give it another chance due to current reviews.\n\nPros:\nOverall service was good. We had reservations so the hostess got us seated immediately over 8 people that were there before our arrival. Server was sincere and professional while taking our order and we did not feel rushed. Water was refilled several times.  We felt they were all very attentive considering how busy the restaurant was that night,\n\nCons:\n1.Based on all the good reviews, we ordered the chicken wing appetizers. I would not order this again because it tasted like it had been sitting out reheated with a glob of sauce. Chicken was not that tender or fresh and I have had better wings.....especially at San Tung (those are  amazing)!!!!\n\n2. Entrees ordered were the Sea Bass and  a type of Coconut noodles (tasted like Pad Thai) and was not what we expected. We were surprised the sea bass tasted so oily and not with a lot of flavor inside. They did not over the fish but just was not season well for my taste. Instead it had globs of fried garlic over it. I LOVE garlic but it was so overcooked it was hard and tasted a bit burnt. The garlic definitely tasted like it had also been sitting out and was recooked. The  bok choy that came with the fish was stringy.  The coconut noodles were not what we expected....nothing that alerted our taste buds to be excited . Flavor was just OK and would not order again. \n\n3. Thai ice tea....it was ok. I have had better tasting ones where you can really taste the tea and the milk. \n\n4. Leaving the restaurant was the final disappointment. The kitchen is located in front so as you walk out you can smell that awful smell of lingering overcooked oil in the air. \n\nPersonally for us, we wouldn't mind the crowd if the food was well prepared and fresh. I would have preferred to eat at Park Chow, Ebisu, Hotei, San Tung, Yummy Yummy, Pasquale's, or even Perilla if we were in that general area.", "author": "mimi c."}

This dish, of which there are several images on Yelp, is fish made in a banana leaf along with basil, a mousse, and leafy vegetables. I actually don't remember what type of vegetables were included in the past because the fish and the mousse filled more of the bowl and the veggies were at the bottom. \n\nThis time, the bowl was filled mostly with iceberg lettuce and I was literally dishing out lettuce from the very beginning. I couldn't even find the fish. There was a very thin layer of fish, snapper, that covered the top. And that is it. Imagine eating lettuce covered with mousse and some spinach. For $13, I was really disappointed. Would have ordered something else more satisfying. \n\nWould be curious if others have experienced this as of recent. \n\nI still think Marnee Thai i one of the best places to eat authentic Thai but I probably won't order the HOR MOK again until I see more reviews that show that they've stopped adding so much lettuce. Also, the chicken curry pieces were quite thin and the huge chunks of potatoes overwhelmed the chicken. But the sauce and dish itself was quite good.

Thankfully the taste was anything but. \n\nWe quickly ordered the sickly sweet, addictive (and very money) Angel Wings, which combined my two favorite method of food preparation: deep-fried and coated, or should I say drenched, in sweet chili / tamarind sauce (I do have a blunt palate sometimes).  \n\nA spicy Pad Siew (with roast duck - DO NOT order it with anything else!) and a mild pork red curry soon followed.

Bay Area,\" I decided to give Marnee Thai a try.\n\nMy wife and I arrived at around 2 PM on a Sunday.  The restaurant was quite bustling and it took a few moments for us to be seated.  The place was a bit smaller that I had expected, but still comfortable nonetheless.\n\n1)  We started with the Nam Tok - Spicy Beef Salad.  The beef was incredibly tender comparable to most other Thai restaurant that I have been to.  Greens were extremely fresh, and the dressing of lime and fishsauce along with the roasted rice topping were perfect.  Serving size was very respectable given the price.\n\n2)  As recommended by the server, we tried the coconut and corn hotcakes.  This dish was featured on the tv review and was offered as a special.  It was presented in a croquette \"takoyaki\" pan which was scooped out by the server onto our plates.  It consisted of a rice flour batter topped with corn, pumpkin, taro, jalapeno, and sweet coconut cream.   Great combination of savory and sweet flavors along with the gelatin texture of the batter.  \n\n3)  Lastly we had the mango fried rice with shrimp.  Raisins added a bit of sweetness to the dish, while the mango added a nice brightness.  the shrimp was cooked well, and they were quite generous with the portion.  The homemade hot sauce which is offered on every table was a nice addition to the dish.\n\nAll in all, the servers were extremely nice, and food was very satisfying.

I live in Santa Monica and visit SF a few times a year to see my sister. She raves about Marni Thai. We finally got a chance a few weeks ago and lemme tell you, I was excited. Unfortunately after walking out after a really uninspiring dinner, the disappointment set in really quick. I suppose I should have known better that on a Saturday night there was the whole back room open and no wait. \n\nThere were 3 adults and two kids, who love their Thai as much as I do. We all placed our orders and anxiously awaited our allegedly divine food. My sister ordered a sea bass in garlic sauce. It looked good, but damn was it oily and just not flavorful. I took a few bites and was waiting for 'the' flavor to jump out at me. Never happened. 3/4 of the fish sat in its oliy sauce only to be thrown out. Strike 1!\n\nOn to my Pad Kee Mao. It's my favorite noodle dish. I order it at every Thai place we go to no matter what else is ordered. I love the leftovers for breakfast. What I was served was nothing resembeling any Pad Kee Mao I have ever had. What was placed in front of me was a heaping sticky mess of saucy red rice noodles, some chicken, and occasional chili and I think a piece of onion. This is supposed to be a spicy dish, but is was sticky sweet. I don't know what the hell this was meant to be, but I almost asked if I had been served the right dish. Strike 2!\n\nThen there was the green curry. My 9 year old could eat a bowl of green curry every day of the week. The hotter the better as well. He's not a normal kid. His curry was a huge bowl of very average tasting, not spicy bamboo shoots and chicken. There was a fair amount of chicken, but an insane amount of bamboo shoots. I estimate that there was 2 or more cups which I considered to be filler. He likes the shoots, but I felt this was a cheep move on their part. I think I make a tastier green curry at home. Strike 2 1/2!\n\nOh, yes, and then after a good 20 minutes of being served all but one of our dishes, my daughter's bbq chicken arrives. I thought that we were actually going to leave without her eating. It probably would have been better to have not even have ordered it. It was so lacking flavor.It was very obvious that the chicken had not been marinated for very long at all. I was hoping that it would have been served with some exciting sauce like all good Thai BBQ chicken is. It wasn't. The sauce was the same sauce served with both bland appetizers. I guess there is only one type of sauce that this place serves. It was some sweet stuff, but that's about all I can remember. Blah! Strike 3!\n\nWhen we left, I didn't say anything to my sister who had been to Marni maybe 15 times or more. She finally broke the the tension and said that it was not good at all and that she expected much better like her other visits. Then she said that there is a second Marni that opened in town. I'm wondering if they took the good cooks and are using them at the new place to get it going. Such a bummer. I really, really wanted to like this place, but it truly sucked. Maybe I am spoiled because I live in LA which has the largest Thai population outside Thailand and we have a pethora of good Thai places to choose from. I would say that I won't even go back to try Marni again.", "author": "Melissa H."}

The angel wings are also one of the most delicious things that has ever passed through my mouth. It's topped with fresh fried basil and the most tasty sauce EVER. I save the extra garlic sauce on my plate so I can eat it with rice after the chicken is gone. \n\nWe didn't get it last time but the sticky mango rice is the perfect way to end your meal.

My friends and I tried:\n\n1) Shrimp spring rolls- delicious and the fresh mint leaves inside gave them that extra kick!\n\n2) Gai samoon prai (chicken with onions, fresh herbs, lemongrass, ginger, basil, peppercorn)\n\n3) Pad nor mai (chicken with chili, garlic, bamboo shoots, egg, and basil)\n\n4) Pad ma kuer (eggplant with beef, bell peppers, and basil)- my favorite dish\n\nAll the entrees were very savory and they each had a very distinct flavor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-29", "description": "Since I had business in the city today, I had to drop by my favorite Thai restaurant in the entire bay area and have a great lunch!  The weather was perfect in San Francisco today ~ sunny with a slight breeze.  We found parking on 9th Avenue, just a few cars up from the restaurant.\n\nWe missed out on the lunch crowd and looked forward to a nice meal together.  Our friendly waitress took our order of the following: Spicy Angel Wings, Panang Beef, Guay Tiew Koor with an extra serving of Roasted Duck plus Jasmine steamed rice.  Iced water for all and a Thai iced tea for me!\n\nI had never had their Spicy Angel Wings and they certainly did not disappoint me.  The chicken wings and drummettes were sauteed in a garlic-chili sauce, then deep fried with crispy basil set atop this finger licking sweet and spicy dish!  I like my food spicy so I will ask them to make it spicier next time.  As an option, you can ask for deep fried spicy tofu instead of the chicken wings/drummettes combo.\n\nChunks of tender beef with panang curry paste, coconut milk and Thai basils make one of our favorite main courses called Panang Beef.  We had the lunch portion which is half the size of what you receive for dinner. Both the lunch and dinner portions are served with steamed broccoli, which is served a tad crunchy which is how I like it.\n\nThe Guay Tiew Koor with an extra side of Roasted Duck was delectable as usual.  The only difference today was the wide noodles were not available per our waitress so we had instead a noodle half the size but this did not diminish the overall taste and presentation.  The fried rice noodles with chicken, fried egg, bean sprouts, ground peanuts and that amazing side of roasted duck made my taste buds swoon!  If I were dining by myself, I could order just this dish and take the other half home for another meal.  I prefer this to the Pad Thai that most folks order.\n\nSteamed Jasmine rice was both fragrant and an excellent foil for the flavors of all the dishes we enjoyed!  I can't wait to come back here again.  Too bad they don't have a south bay presence...I would eat there daily.", "author": "Beth W."}

There's just so many options and almost everything I have had is delicious, so narrowing those options is even harder. \n\nI do have a few favorites and they are the desserts.\n\nHUGE fan of the fried roti with ice cream. It comes out looking like a giant frosted flake but trust me, it's good. I have even scarfed those down when I had a sore throat w/  the flu kicking my ass,  zero fux given. \nAlso love the mango w/ black sticky rice. It tends to sell out quick.\n\nSomething not on the regular menu that is sometimes offered as a special:\nThere are these little coconut rice cake things.. I don't know what they are called, but I've had them a few times. They come out in a griddle that looks like the ones for Eggettes, but circular instead of almond shaped. These are sooooo insanely good. Sweet, slightly crisp around the edges, but also savory and chewy. My friends and I usually fight for the last one.\n\nYou know how San Tung is famous for those dry fried chicken wings? Yeah, well Marnee Thai has amazingly good Angel Wings. Give it a shot. Think of it as a Thai version, the Thai equivalent dare I say!?

Actually, I am not the one who concerned about things around me at all, but just can't stand with some obnoxious situation. So, that's why I was interested in your case. \n\nNormally, people usually hear something which happened as a trouble. If you had enjoyed your food and everything was smooth, who would care or notice about you? That situation is noticeable. I'm pretty sure that if I wasn't the one who sat at the table beside you, but someone else. They could hear the conversation too and some wanted to know what was going to happen next including me? How the restaurant react to the matter?\n\nUsually, I spoke something out because I felt unfair when someone was lying about the truth or made some story up to make his/her story strong enough to persuade or make people believe what he/she was trying to say.\n\nand you're right you're not the one who doesn't like their foods, otherwise, there're a lot of people who love their foods and feel welcome to go back too! I feel sorry for you that Marnee Thai is not the right place for you :)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI really had a great time at Marnee Thai today. Not only the food was really great but the service as well :D \n\nDue to the comment below from gookgette c., I'm not sure if it was the same case that I saw today, but it is kind of familiar to me. I am a big fan of Marnee Thai actually and I usually invite my friends to come and enjoy food and service here. I heard everything that happened with this case. \n\nThe thing that I heard and being a witness is the waitress, who is really nice and polite, asked this customer if she could help to recommend some food for her because she took long time to make a decision because maybe it was her first time having dinner here. This customer asked if there were some special dishes and the waitress answered all of her questions and seemed like she wasn't intrigued. So, the waitress asked her if she were super hungry. The customer said she was not so hungry, but she didn't know what to get. Then, the waitress recommended the popular appetizer which is Homemade Hotcakes (I really love this one, it's amazing!!!). She seemed interested in it and she then asked about how the papaya salad looks like. The waitress didn't force or push her to have Homemade Hotcakes and Papaya salad, but she decided to have them by herself.\n\nWhen papaya salad came out, I saw she had just a little and didn't ask for sending back to fix or complaining about food, then hotcakes came out and she tried just only one piece. It seemed that she didn't like it actually, but she didn't complain or anything until the waitress came around and asked her if everything was alright and she just didn't speak anything out, just ordered yellow vegetables curry and no baby corn (seemed like I heard everything because our table is kind of close to each other) I heard the customer said she loves vegetables, That was why the waitress recommended her to have the vegetables curry :) \n\nWhen yellow curry came out, the customer had it for a few moment, and then asked the waitress to wrap everything up back home. When the check came out, she didn't appreciate at all and I heard that this customer asked the waitress if there was any discount because she didn't enjoy the foods at all. Then, the waitress went to ask manager and came back with taking off rice in the check for the customer and packed all the leftovers that this customer could take home. The funny thing is I don't think I heard the waitress said something about DAY-OLD rice!! She just said that she couldn't make a decision to give her any discount, it depended on the policy and manager's solution. \n\nIn my opinion, I have been dining at Marnee Thai for several times. I didn't know how Thai foods here taste like at the first time either, but I think if I ordered foods and I haven't had it before. I won't ask for any discount or anything because it's my choice to try and it's not their faults. If a person doesn't like the food, it doesn't mean that the food isn't delicious, it's just what you don't like and it's your responsibility when you ordered something. It's your choice since you take a step into the restaurant.\n\nI was supposed to review about the restaurant today, but I just didn't feel right when I read that comment -*- Don't take these things personal, I just give my opinion and say what I saw :)\n\nAbout the restaurant, it's as good as usual. I love Marnee Thai and I love their foods and service :D They're all friendly and I feel welcome!!  Today, I ordered not so many, but still delicious as always, yummy!!!! I won't feel hesitate to invite more friends to dine in here in the near future :)", "author": "Abbey L."}

Bizarre and rude, but hey...I'm a tolerant guy.\n\nThe last time I went to Marnee, they took one look at my date and I, one look at the four-seat table that was free, and told us to wait. Ten minutes later, we watched them happily seat a group of three (who walked in off of the street without a reservation). It was transparent: they didn't want to give up a table of four to a couple. We left when they tried to chase off the only other poor couple in the room (who still had full glasses of wine!) to \"make room\" for us.\n\nBottom line: I'm impressed.

Ever since I vacationed in Bangkok, I've been looking for Thai food that comes close to the flavors I had there. Well, the search is over! This place offers the authentic Thai flavors you would find on the streets of Bangkok. As you enter the door, you see the wall of awards this place has won... Michelin, Zagat, Fodors, etc.\n\nThe dishes we had were:\n*Green Mango Salad- Really refreshing and went well with all the dishes\n*Panang Beef- The beef was really tender and had a nice kick\n*Chicken Kaprow- Chicken was tender and flavorful\n*Prawns and Scallops Pad Phong Ka Ree- The yellow curry flavor of this dish was really good. The curry was not heavy.\n*Pad Thai- Had to be the best Pad Thai outside of Bangkok! Reminded me of the pad thai I had in Bangkok.\n*Mango Fried Rice- I normally don't like fruits in my savory dishes, but this was a nice combination. I really enjoyed it!\n\nIt's a small place. So, if you have a group larger than 4 people, I recommend making reservations. There is plenty of parking in the neighborhood since it's just a short walk away from Golden Gate park and there is a parking lot across the street. The staff is really friendly and always made sure we were doing OK. It's reasonably priced and the portions are just right.

Since I love Thai Food so much, I must come here to see what's all the raves about. I ordered \n1. Papaya salad: 3/5. I could barely see the Papaya in the salad. That's how little they put in the dish. They mixed a lot of lettuce instead. Flavor is okay. I had better papaya in my town before. \n2. Chicken angels: this was the best dish of the entire meal. The sauce is pretty yummy but kinda salty if you're not eating it with rice or salad\n3. Calamari salad: I had high hope for this dish but i wasn't very impressed with the result. Kinda plain and nothing extraordinary. They just pour the fish sauce over calamari and lettuce , added some mints. I expected more flavors though\n4. Pad thai: pretty good but the raves for their pad thai dish is kinda overrated because I expected a lot from 1000+ reviews for a 4 stars restaurant \n5. Thai fried rice: one of the best fish of the night. I would rate this favorite after Pad Thai. Again, nothing I haven't had before. \n6. Hot cakes: ok for non-asian maybe this looks new and interesting. For me, I was a bit disappointed to see how the hot cakes looked. My friend suggested that I must order this for dessert because it's reallyyyyyy good! Well ok it's good but I made this kind of cake before in my kitchen but I didn't know it's called hot cakes in Thai cuisine. 6 little cakes for $8.50, I thought it was expensive for several rice cakes with coconut milk.\nCall me a picky eater for rating this place down but that was my honest opinion.

I kid you not, there was like an inch of oil that had risen and settled at the top, it was overwhelmingly tangy (too many tomatoes and pineapples perhaps), and the duck was nothing to write home about.

I really do love this place. I've brought friends, family and even dates here and they have all been impressed and satisfied. Like one Yelper mentioned before, consistency is what does it for this restaurant. I have never had a bad experience with the employees or a problem with the food. \n\nFirst of all, the employees are very very nice and I think the service is good, especially since they are always busy. (They were even really nice to me when I was there on a date with a guy whose behavior was beyond embarrassing and inappropriate. If I were our waitress I would have thrown his dinner all over him.) Surprisingly, the restaurant is really large. You wouldn't thinks so at first because when you walk in all you can see is the kitchen and a small dining area but once you head towards the back you will encounter a really large dining area that is also bustling. \n\nThe food of course is delicious. I always try to order something new and always leave with a new favorite dish. But favorites are: Kang Ka Ree with Lamb, Mussamun Chicken Curry and Pad Ma Kuer. And of course, all of their desserts.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-18", "description": "I've only been to this restaurant twice and in between that time was a span of almost two years. The food was very good and up to my expectations last time I was here (and a little worried after reading other reviews here on Yelp). It seems they are (a little) slow so I recommend ordering an appetizer--we waited almost 45mins for our entr\u00e9es, with all the tables being occupied and most of them ordering near the time we did, it is understandable. We ordered the golden triangles/Thai samosas for an appetizer, which were nothing special really--loaded with kabocha but very subtle, almost bland in flavor; the dipping sauce really helped it. The service here seems okay. They are very attentive to refilling water glasses (love citrus water) but abrupt almost to a fault as in taking the appetizer dishes and anything else empty away; more like snatching away, haha. We forgot to mention the level of spiciness we wanted (they should have asked) and got our red curry mild (which should be very spicy anyways?) by default but it was still great. When it comes to Thai food, I adore pad see ew and most restaurants fail at attaining that balance of sweet and savory. They ran out of the flat noodle and it was satisfactory with the stick noodles, like used with pad Thai--which is one of the biggest mistakes a business can make, it's quite simple to pay attention to inventory and be stocked at all times. One of the best restaurants I have been to for pad see ew, though I admit to only trying about two dozen Thai restaurants in the Bay Area--not enough to be in the  know, really. It should be noted that the restaurant is very small and tight, loud/noisy as well. Not recommended for groups really, they have a section room in the back but again, it is very small and can almost be claustrophobic for some people.\n\nI absolutely love the vegetarian friendly and adaptable menu--sometimes it's hard to find a restaurant that has such vegetarian options.", "author": "Aaron G."}

We almost went to another place  that was close to our hotel and after that fell through, we came here. We had to park across the street at Golden Gate Park, but it wasn't too far for us to walk. \n\nIt was a packed house, yet people kept coming in (even when we were seated, I noticed that). Since we were a large party (my sister, brother-in-law and family- three nephews), we had a bit of a wait. One of my nephews and I counted all the awards/recognition plaques on the wall, across from the waiting area (seats along the wall)- there were 24 in all! The smells were intoxicating (I love Thai food!), the crowded restaurant reassuring, and the accolades added to my expectation of good Thai food.\n\nThough they were busy, the staff was extremely nice and quick at times- it was a team effort, as different people took the empty platters (ok ,a couple of things were forgotten, but that's ok). The ladies were wearing beautiful richly colored costumes in jewel-toned hues, complete in gold trim (sapphire, fuschia, purple); guessing they were brocade silks? It's funny, I don't really remember what the men were wearing, maybe the standard black pants and white shirts. The walls were adorned with framed prints. There were a set of clear glass large vases with tall flowers (fake), which kind of reminded me of Pottery Barn- it was elegant and simple, but still very pretty. (Sometimes Thai restaurants' decor seems gawdy and awkward.) Our seats we're half booth and half chairs. The front door is left open but your clothes are still going to smell like food. \n\nWe ordered summer rolls (perfect, but I knew my husband wouldn't like it; it's probably the mint that he doesn't like), spicy angel wings (don't normally eat wings but I tried one, pretty good), thai style fried rice (has cucumbers, tomatoes, and extra cilantro), beef salad (excellent!!! really enjoyed it since I never order it when it's just me and my husband), chan pad poo (spicy rice noodles with crab meat and egg in chili garlic sauce- 1st time I ever had it- and it was excellent! but my brother-in-law didn't really like it), and panang (potatoes, curry, coconut and basil- pretty good). The food is served on square platters and is in good sized portions, except the summer rolls (might be an appetizer M.O. thing, though). It's a good thing that the food didn't come out at the same time since we were running out of room on the table! Our oldest nephew probably didn't eat as much compared to us adults (but then again he isn't fond of chinese food, either). Three of us ordered diet soda and thai iced tea. The bill was $82.79.   \n\nAll in all, I'm a fan and would come here again when we visit the Bay Area. And I'm not surprised at all that there are nearly 800 reviews on this restaurant.", "author": "Margret C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-07-16", "description": "I usually like the food here. \n\nHowever, last time I went there with my group, it was a complete disaster because of the service. The first waiter (male, didn't speak English I assume) did not reply anything to what we asked, and ignored us the whole time. For example, my glass of water had a floating/swimming spider which I gently asked him to bring me a new one. The waiter conveniently took it away and did not say anything. Is it that hard to say sorry? He came back with one - still didn't say anything as if nothing was wrong - at this point, I suspected that he had some problem w speaking, and possibly it was the same water that he scooped out the spider. I didn't drink it anyway since things became worse. \n \nWe had a large group and asked for additional table that was next to ours because the space they gave us was too small to eat - you know, elbows touching small. The tiny table we asked for was not under reservation at the time of our sitting. It was actually attached to the other party next to us, and the waiter asked the customers at the table so we could have it. But after some time the waiter came back with a reservation plaque and placed it on the table we added (what a convenient way to refuse without getting an argument), and this was declaration to us \"I don't want to give you that extra table, so don't talk to me\". \nNow the whole group was pissed, since the first waiter did reply back when we repeatedly asked for space so we could actually eat without knocking spoons or water glass of your neighbor.\n\nNext, the second waitress, pretty one, came and tried to ignore us while we were asking for more space. This waitress spoke English, and told us to consider OTHER customers. WTF????? Well, of course our reply was that we'll consider when we have the space to order the dishes from your kitchen and eat. Until then, it's simply the problem of the restaurant, isn't it? If you don't think you could fit a group, don't take a large party and ask for understanding. If you take one, be courteous to take care. Is it that hard?\n\nThey added table, removed table, added again and removed again. We tried to stay calm but the moment is already ruined. The waitress kept saying the owner doesn't want that way, and we were keep asking for the tiny table. \n\nWe stopped arguing and came out. There was no point getting uglier, and I think they should thank us for it. On my way out, I asked the receptionist, prettiest one, for that I wanted to talk to the manager or the owner. She tried to listen to the situation and apologized (first time from the restaurant) and she said, neither of the manager or owner was there. WHAT??? So simply water/waitress were telling a lie??? Just to safeguard that tiny two-ppl table to sell two more dishes???? They just didn't want to give the table to us and try to squeeze a bunch of ppl in a very small space. \n\nThey are greedy. They ignore you. They tell lies to reject your request. It is just wrong service.\n\nOur day was almost ruined, until Hotei, the Japanese restaurant across the street welcomed us and gave three tables despite their busy and inconvenient route of service. Five stars to Hotei, shame on Marnee Thai. \n\nLike I said, I'm calling better business bureau for this.", "author": "J B."}

As we began ordering, we were just going to order appetizers for the moment; however, we realized the rarity of seeing May so we decided to order all at once even though we didn't quite know what we were ordering. We ordered the appetizers and a couple of entr\u00e9es. We asked if she could come back so we could keep looking and give her the rest of our order in a short while. She said that it would be better if we ordered now so the kitchen wouldn't be confused. So she stood there as we tried to figure it out (awkward and uncomfortable). We finished ordering...two people of our party arrived late and we ordered again. It's like she was half there, talking to another waitress in thai as we were ordering/ asking us to repeat our order. At some point she left and we yelled for her because we weren't done talking to her and didn't know if she understood our order. In the end, she did get it. \n\n\nAppetizer: \nSpicy Angel Wings- alright, super greasy, good flavor\nTom Yum & Tom Ka soups- both really tasty. \nThai Potstickers- It never came so we had to reorder. It wasn't worth it. \n\nEntree\nThai Fried Rice- tasted really good, not spicy enough. \nPrawns & Scallops Pad Phong Karee- Scallops weren't fresh, shrimps good size, but dish as a whole, I say pass.\nSome 2 other dishes: don't know what they were.\n\nThe best part was the wine- Ravenwood Old Vine Zinfandel. \n\nAnyways, the food was a mediocre experience. I'd rather go to another Thai food restaurant. (I wish I was better at describing food... oh well.) Point is that the experience was not great and I was listening to the other party of 9 next to us argue about added charges that they were unaware of/didn't get. They left unhappy.

The tom yum soup was delicious and very well balanced between the lemon and the spicy.

The meat was cooked to perfection, but the curry was presented to us on a plate. Do you see the issue with this ?? Where is the sauce?

Saw that marnee was around the corner and decided to go there.\n\nFood:\nThai Fried Rice with chicken, egg, tomatoes and onion, Thai Style Sausage (one of the specials), and the BBQ Chicken\n\nThe fried rice and bbq chicken were the highlights. nice big portions for 2 starving students. the chicken was served with sweet chili sauce, cooked just right over the grill. the sausage however was under par, i guess we were expecting something, not so ordinary. \n\nanyways overall the food was great, good sized portions for the price, especially the chicken. i was even able to take a few pieces home. \n\nalso, they have this awesome-sauce, fish sauce with chilis,  that reminded me of vietnamese nuoc cham, but spicier. put a lil bit of that over your rice, yummm\n\nthe waitresses are very nice. parking can be a pain in this part of town", "author": "David D."}

West Bay natives know that this neighborhood is known for fog. Much like it's cousin Daly City, sunsets can sometimes be a rarity. Fortunately, the sunset district is also know for its family atmosphere and it's food. Placed away from  maddening crowds of tourists & just south of Golden Gate Park, the neighborhood is a haven for SF foodies. \n\nIt is no surprise that this is where Marnee Thai calls home. Located on 9th Avenue between Lincoln & Irvine streets, it's a stones throw away from many Golden Gate Park attractions. \n\nMarnee Thai is know around the city for its great Thai Food, and they have even received a honorable mention from the famous/infamous Michelin Award critics. However, being the skeptic that I am, I like to let the food do the talking. Fortunately I had the pleasure of going to this restaurant with a large group of friends, and I was able to try a number of dishes. \n\nLet me digress. There are certain restaurants that are good to experience in groups. Marnee Thai is one of these restaurants for two reasons. \n\nThe first is the ability to eat in a family style setting let's you sample a lot more of the menu than you would if it were just two of you. Second, if you go in a large group, you have to request the back room. The restaurant is divided into essentially two dining rooms; the larger front room, and the back room. Though this may not bode well for people who need to be \"seen\", the back room is a more intimate setting for a large group and I think it gives you an insider feel as you walk past those in the front. How is that for reverse psychology? \n\nBack to the food. I started things out with their corn fritter appetizer. This was something that I have never seen in a Thai restaurant. This corn based dough fritter is served with traditional Thai vegetables. Simply put, its corn & its deep fried, its good! \n\nNext came the noodles. Samplings included Pad Thai  & Pad Se Lew. Both dishes were served with tofu. While I found the Pad Thai to be very flavorful, the Pad Se Lew was lacking. Overall the noodle dishes are not bad, but this really isn't their strong point. Though they are not bad by any stretch of the imagination, I've had better. For pan fried Thai noodles I would still recommend the aptly named King of Thai Noodle House in San Francisco's Richmond district.\n\nWhere Marnee Thai really  excels is in their curries. Here is where you begin to understand why they are so popular. I ordered the Green Pumpkin Curry with tofu.  This dish was presented well and looks very appetizing. I'm a big fan of spice and they definitely hit the mark on this. The dish had a stout kick to it! The spice didn't overwhelm the dish or destroy the flavor; it enhanced it as it should. Not to worry though, all their curries can be tuned down with no sacrifice to flavor for those who don't like so much spice. All things aside, this is one of the best curry dishes that I've had to date.\n\nOther samplings included their red chicken curry as well as another yellow vegetable curry. All underscored their masterful ability to balance spice & curry into dishes that  would cure the worse case of Thai homesickness. \n\nThis overall was a wonderful experience and I definitely can say that I'm a fan. If you are in the city, planning a trip to Golden Gate Park, or someone who doesn't mind driving for food, give Marnee Thai a try. You'll uncover great Thai food in one of San Francisco's finest neighborhoods.", "author": "Galen M."}

And apparently, we weren't the only people who drooled over the hot cakes and panang curry described on the show.  Suddenly this very old and already popular joint shows up on yelp's hot list and got even more crowded than before.  Well, we joined the hype and ordered take outs from them twice since the show.\n\nYes, the hot cakes are awfully delicious!  It's a great combo of something savory and something sweet.  The coconut flavor and the subtle sweetness of the squash and the corn mix really well.  The panang pork curry is less liquidy than normal Thai curry dishes, but the meat is more tender than your average Thai restaurant meat, and the flavor is great.  We have also ordered papaya salad, pad Thai, and pumpkin curry, but they weren't quite as special as the aforementioned two dishes.\n\n Take out is easy and fast-sure beats waiting for a table for a long time.", "author": "Candice B."}

It's brought out in a cast iron skillet like the ones they use in takonyaki.

The chan pad poo did not have enough crab meat. I've had it at other restaurants, particularly in San Jose that make it better. The hor mook fish lacked flavor and again, I've had it better in San Jose. \n\nThe desserts were super small though tasty. The mango and sticky rice was really good because the mango was ripe and fresh. The roti was a little thicker than the street version in Thailand but the flavor was there. \n\nIt was ok but I would not drive all the way to SF to go eat here again.

After putting our names down at Pacific Fish Grill (and it's packed wait list of 20 min), we decided to walk around the neighborhood to kill time. Long and behold, we walk by Marnee Thai. \n\nNo judging a book by it's cover. From the outside, Marnee Thai looks like a ghetto, hole-in-the-wall restaurant. Not really my thang but hey, what do we see? A Yelp-approval sticker, a MICHELIN award, and many 5-star award this, another customer-satisfaction award here.... all three of us being huge fans of Yelp decided we just HAD to try this place out. \n\nTo our favor, the appearance of the restaurant proved itself wrong. It's a very narrowly shaped place with seats lining across the wall and not that much room to walk around. The place was packed on a Friday evening so the service was somewhat on the slow side and we had to keep asking the workers, \"can we order??\"\n\nI love that the food came in a family-style setting so the three of us could share and try the dishes we ordered. They were:\n\n- shrimp spring rolls (had pieces of mint leaves which was a nice, refreshing addition to the roll)\n\n- Chef Specials GAI SAMOON PRAI (saut\u00e9ed sliced chicken with onions & fresh herbs, lemongrass, wild ginger, peppercorns \nand Thai basil)\n\n- PAD NOR MAI (Ground sliced chicken saut\u00e9ed with chili, garlic, bamboo shoots, egg, and Thai basil)\n\n& my personal FAVORITEEEEE PAD MA KUER (Saut\u00e9ed eggplant with sliced beef, bell peppers, and Thai basil in soy bean sauce)\n\nMost of the entrees allow you to choose between beef or chicken. The portions are hefty as well. The rice doesn't come in individual bowls rather in this huge silver JAR that you can serve yourself. You can taste the quality because the food did not taste like a block of MSG. No dish was very salty and harmonized really well with the herbs. \n\nBeware: they offer you this pepper sauce to add spiciness to your dish. DONT UNDERESTIMATE IT. My friend and I have pretty high tolerances of spiciness and this sauce was no joke--especially if you get one of the pepper seeds on your food. I remember pouring a shitton on my spring roll and basically died.\n\nWhen you're in the area, check this place out!

This gives me more patience to certain situations, but it also makes me more impatient when I see it could have been different.\n\nMy friend and I just got our weekly nail fix down the street (Sensi Nails) and were extremely hungry. We both like good food, so we were not just going to walk into any place. Of course we researched on Yelp and decided to go for this Thai place. \n\nI love Thai food & I think it's hard to actually go wrong with Thai food. I mean, noodles & veggies are hard to mess up. And my 3 stars are not about the food, but more about the service (the food is good!). \n\nWe walked in (no reservation), but they had only 2 parties (one of 4 and one of 3) in the restaurant at the time we walked in, and the rest of the tables were empty. I'm sure there were some reservations made, but this is not a restaurant based on reservations, it's probably mostly walk ins. So when you then seat 2 people at the bar instead of at a regular table I think this is poor customer service. Anyway, we are not picky and we were just extremely hungry so we went with it (mind you, the bar seats are extremely uncomfortable). \nWe immediately got our water (thanks, I love when you get water right away) and our menus. But then, for some odd reason, it literally took us to raise our hand to get a server to take our order (it didn't seem like any server was assigned to the bar area, and there were at least 5 servers just running around for now 3 parties seated).\nThen, when we ordered I had a feeling our server didn't really care and was looking at something else while just saying \"aha, ok.\" \"Surprisingly\" we got a wrong appetizer. When I mentioned it they took it away without saying anything. We got our right order later on, but again, no one mentioned anything about the wrong appetizer (a \"sorry\" would have been nice).\nThen for the entree, my friend already receives her entree while we're still eating our appetizers (probably because it wasn't communicated with the kitchen that we had a delay with our appetizers, they probably just screamed \"another order of this please\"). I didn't get my entree until 7 minutes after she got her entree. \n\nWhen we had leftovers, we asked for boxes. I had about half of the food left (portions are huge), but when they boxed it, all of a sudden only 1 bite was left. Not sure what happened with the rest of my food, but it wasn't with me anymore. I specifically remember leaving some protein in my bowl, but when I got home I only had 2pieces of veggies in my box left). Food apparently just disappears. \n\nIf it wasn't for the poor service, I would have given this place 4 stars. I mean, the food is good (like I said before, can't really go wrong with Thai food). But the service is just poor. I probably won't come back, I mean, there's plenty of GOOD Thai places with GOOD customer service.", "author": "Helen D."}

The appetizer is amazing.  I have never found it at any other Thai restaurant before!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-12", "description": "Marnee Thai is THE BEST Thai food in ALL of CALIFORNIA. And trust me, I have REALLY high standards and expectations about the quality of food for EVERY cuisine. If I wasn't a school administrator, I'd honestly be a food critic or personal shopper. Being born and raised in a Chinese-Thai family, good food and restaurants were ALWAYS a priority for my family and we would drive an hour or two away to eat good food. That's just the Chinese way...with that said, here's my bottom of the line, no nonsense review:\n\nEvery SINGLE time I visit SF, I always have to stop by Marnee Thai. This is the newer location and has a more contemporary feel to it. The employees work hard to make the dishes authentic and provide outstanding customer service. From what I hear, they wake up at 3am to prepare special sauces that would not be found anywhere. The chef has received several accolades for his desserts (coconut hot cakes and roti), pad-thai (#1 in all of California), and has guest lectured at some of the BEST culinary institutions in the country. I've been to Thailand about a dozen times and truly and genuinely believe the food tastes way better than food in Thailand! In regards to cleanliness, if you compare it to the streets of Bangkok, I would have to say it's 100 million times cleaner and healthier than those street vendors. \n\nSO yelper HATERS of Marnee Thai 9th Ave, STOP THIS NONSENSE about the bad press. I understand freedom of speech but if you go to a \"good\" Chinese restaurant or even Italian restaurant, you are going to find that restaurants aren't perfect. I firmly believe that Health Department inspector EXAGGERATED information in his report in order try bust several restaurants to prove himself and trying to use the restaurant as leverage to move up in his position. Totally unfair. \n\nLet me give you my top 5 must haves: \n\n1. Their Hor Mok (for all you seafood lovers) is my husband's FAVORITE dish. If you are feeling daring, I'd recommend this dish especially if you like a little spice in your food. (Score: 10/10)\n\n2. I'm an avocado lover. I LOVE their avocado salad. This is a fusion dish, not authentic Thai--just FYI. (Score: 9/10)\n\n3. Roti Dessert. I love carbs and dessert. The fresh dough with condensed milk makes my mouth water! (Score: 8.5/10) No Thai restaurant in LA makes it the way they do. Note: This is the Thai version of crepes without the nutella and fruit. \n\n4. I always compare the same types of food at every restaurant. My friends make fun of me because I'm a creature of habit. Therefore, I always order Pad-Thai. If a restaurant can make good Pad-Thai with the right sweetness, spiciness, and other flavoring I guarantee they can make other dishes just as well. Pad-Thai is a safe choice for all of you newbies who are conservative. You can't go wrong with the Pad-Thai at Marnee Thai! (Score: 9.5/10)\n\n5. The last classic Thai dish I love is \"Tom Yum\" with shrimp. At Marnee Thai, it's steaming hot, spicy, and sour. (Score: 9/10)\n\nI'D HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT TO ANYONE WHO WANTS GOOD THAI FOOD. :)", "author": "rosalyn v."}

And they gave me steamed rice instead of my brown rice that I ordered but I was too hungry so i didn;t bother. The steam rice came out luke warm... not sure was it freshly scooped but yea got me thinking for a minute... \n\nOverall I still think Osha on Geary serves the yummiest thai food but Marnee gave really good service.

However, the treatment my dining companion received last week was inexcusable. We were a party of 4, and one had already eaten dinner and was just joining us for company. She wanted to order the mango with sticky rice, which is seasonal. The waitress confirmed that they had it, and upon noticing our neighbor had substituted the rice for ice cream, she asked how much it would be for the same substitution. The waitress told us $5.25, and so she ordered it. \n\nAbout 5 minutes later, the mango+ice cream comes out, as well as the waitress. She announces that the price of the dish will be $9, not $5.25 as originally stated and confirmed. WTH?? How can the price change all of a sudden AFTER you bring out the dish? Totally unacceptable. After some very polite arguing on the part of my dining companion, the waitress goes to talk to the manager. The solution: $5.95. Not the original price, and the restaurant tries to say that the reason is that mango is expensive. OOOOOOOOK.

There were some huge chunks of eggplant, which I suppose was the chef's way to disguise the fact that the dish didn't have a lot of chicken.  \n\nThirdly, I ordered string beans with tofu and baby corn because I wanted to lighten up the meal by having more vegetables. Well, the dish turned out to have this cloying, overly oiled sauce that made it a lot heavier than it should have been.\n\nI definitely was not satisfied by the food I ordered from Marnee Thai on Irving.

I think the dish was called panang beef, but it was chunks of RIDICULOUSLY tender, but thoroughly cooked beef in curry and coconut milk and basil, all with a tender side of broccoli.\nAnd there was some coconut sticky rice for dessert, with really nice fresh mango on the side.\nPrice-wise, it's about 10 bucks per dish, somewhat small portions.  However, that's not that much more expensive than your average Thai restaurant, and the flavor is about 10 times better", "author": "Kimi T."}

I've been going regularly to Thai restaurants since 1973 when most of the menus were not in English and I'd be the only non-Asian in the restaurant.  I had Thai friend write down on a piece of paper my favorite dishes so I could show it to the waitress and order.  In the 1980s or so Thai food caught on and you could then find restaurants outside Thai areas that had menus in English.  If you have been to Thailand or eaten at real Thai restaurants you will know that many American-Thai restaurants have popped up and you can no longer go to just any Thai restaurant and expect great food.  You can, however, go to Marnee Thai and have really good, authentic Thai food.  Three of us went there and the food was very good.  Try it.  If you love Thai food, you should really like the food here.", "author": "TJ J."}

The hotcakes (delicious bite-size coconut cream treats) were amazing, and our entrees (pumpkin curry, pad kee mao) were very good. And all reasonably priced. \n\nServicewise, I was very disappointed. We were seated nearly 10 minutes before a server arrived with water. When we ordered, they asked if we wanted brown or white rice. Brown, we said. Then they manager/owner lady (she limps a bit) came back to confirm brown rice. Since we were never asked \"Do you want rice?\" we assumed it came with the meal. But instead, two orders of rice were deceptively added to our check. Not cool. We had plenty of food, and could have done without the rice (although admittedly, it was possibly the best brown rice I've had at a restaurant).

We settled for two seats at the bar and promptly browsed the menu. First was the Green Mango Salad which had great texture and freshness. Delicious. (We opted for the vegetarian option (tofu) over prawns.) Then came the Thai Style Potstickers which consists of the usual potsticker doused in a green sauce with coco milk on them and basil leaves. Not crazy original, but very delicious. When the Tom Ka soup arrived, we already had a warm fuzzy feeling about our dinner. The broth had the perfect balance of spices and heat. Our last shared dish was the Pad Nor Mai with minced chicken. The dish was great, but my girlfriend wanted more heat so she reached over for the hot sauce. The manager quickly intervened with a cup of chili saying that it would taste much better with this and that this chili batched was made today. Awesome, thanks?! We quickly depleted our rice supply and ordered another small bowl. The waitress came over with this huge silver bowl of rice.

So they kept taking all the shrimp and feeding me all the chicken.\nAnd my friend shoved a shrimp on my plate as a joke, and I accepted it. And he said, wait, what?

In fact, I rarely eat Asian while eating out- because its always much too greasy, heavy, or fried and doesn't ring true to the regions cuisine.\n\nAs with everyone else, I find Marnee Thai to be a tasty, well priced, exception to this fact. Its ingredients are fresh, fried only to the point of necessity (not to the point of attempting to satisfy the American palet), and bursting with flavor! As a post NYE linner (that's lunch and dinner, if you didn't know), Marnee was comfort food for a rainy day, but done just right so I didn't feel like I was weighing my hung-over self down in fatty fare (not the feeling you want after a night of shot and champagne pounding).\n\nThe Spicy Angel Wings were crunchy, sweet, hot, and topped off with basil leaves cooked so well they were an edible snack on their own. The Pad Thai was also great- not dripping in oil and paired with the perfect ratio of shrimp and sprouts. And the Chicken Yellow Curry?! \nPacked full of flavor topped over brown rice of just the right consistency (not too cooked, but not mush either).\n\nThe intimacy of the restaurant is another reason worth venturing to the Richmond. Its warm punchy colors make the small space so cozy, and the staff appears genuinely sweet.

Had their droolworthy corncakes and tender satay, too. \n\nWhen the swordfish arrived, it was so beautiful! (I kicked myself for not bringing my camera with me!) And it tasted even better than it looked. The flavors melded together so harmoniously... the sweet basil and cabbage, the creamy curry mouse... it's been a while since I've had a dish that was so well made and so delicious. \n\nThe owner informed us that his grandmother used to make this dish in Thailand and sell it for many to enjoy. It was her signature dish and now it's a Marnee Thai staple. (I really am a sucker for true stories like this but they are why I come back again and again! Knowing the food or restaurant's history makes the trip there and the food that much more worthwhile.)\n\nYou may want to stick with traditional Thai dishes like padseeyew, basil chicken, satay, yellow curry... which are all fine and dandy. But if you want something home-y, really sticks to your stomach and dances in your mouth, you're going to want to order the swordfish.  It's elegant, simple and effortlessly delicious. THANK YOU! \n\n*Side note: Marnee Thai has a back room seating area for small parties.

But either area, they both get super noisy with everyone in there, and you do feel a little squished walking in and out, while avoiding waiters/waitresses flying past you with plates of food in their hands. \n\nThe service is pretty good for how business it was on a Saturday night when I went, there's constantly always one or two waiters/waitresses walking in and out of the room every few minutes, so it's not hard to flag one down to get something. \n\nSo food wise --- my boyfriend and I got the Angel Wings for an appetizer, which wasn't what I expected after having some at other Thai restaurants. These angel wings weren't stuffed, they were just deep fried chicken wings in a thick spicy sauce. They were still yummy, just not what I was used to. \n\nWe also got Thai coffee and Thai iced tea which were pretty good. But the Thai Iced Tea was super sweet, but isn't it always? I prefer the Thai Coffee though, it had a nutty flavor to it, but it's also sweet, just not as sweet as the Thai Iced Tea. So be forewarned if you don't like overly-sweet drinks. \n\nAs for our entrees, my boyfriend got the Mango & Pork Fried Rice, which was really good surprisingly. I'm not a fan of fruit in dishes, but it was pretty good in the fried rice. The fried rice overall was very flavorful and yummy! I'd definitely get this one again. However, the pork used in the dish, is the Chinese-style Cha-Siu used in the Pork Buns in dim sum. So that was a little odd, since it was more chinese-style than \"thai\" style. \n\nMy entree was the Pad Kee Mao, being a fanatic of that dish in my college days. I chose to get it \"very spicy\", which might've been too spicy for me, but other than that blunder the noodles were yummy! Of course it has basil in it, which I usually ask them not to put in, but I decided to try it Marnee's way before altering it myself, and they chopped up the basil to smaller pieces so they were edible in my opinion. \n\nThe Pad Kee Mao was good, but I think I would try some other dishes next time I come. I think the Fried Rice was delicious enough to get it again next time. But I think I'll try some of their curry dishes next time I go there! Can't wait!", "author": "Grace L."}

We go there and had a drink and I asked about the yumminess factor of this other Thai joint down the street.  I was told that Marnee Thai was the shizzle.  Just1 had NEVER had Thai before!  WTF?!\n\nSo of course we have to go get out of the rain and have some Thai food.\n\nAll of my favorites were perfect (chicken satay, corn fritters and tom yum gai soup) and I had a dish with chicken and cashews that was AWESOME.  Just1 ordered chicken curry (that I didn't end up trying) and Pickles (Jason's new nick name starting that evening) had beef with green beans.\n\nAll the food was super fresh and quite tasty.

So which is the best?  Depends on the dish, really.   Silver Spoon's Evil Jungle Prince is one hell of a signature dish...but Marnee's Pad Kee Mow is the best I've ever had.   And they have pumpkin samosas--nice.  Clearly, only time will tell.\n\nOne nice thing about Marnee is their hidden back room which makes the restaurant much larger than its cramped, bustling front area would suggest; it's pretty rare that a party of 7 can just stroll in and get seated right away on a weekend, even (especially?) in the Inner Sunset.  A few of the dishes got brought out late, but they're diligent about keeping the hot tea coming.  \n\nNote: this Marnee is a spin-off of the original in the Outer Sunset, but being closer to home, it's my location of choice.", "author": "Wes M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-05-07", "description": "I consider myself a Thai food enthusiast, and have been searching for a quality Thai restaurant in San Francisco that could meet my expectations set by the extremely authentic Thai restaurant I use to go to before moving here two years ago. After trying many sub-par and embarrassingly horrible Thai places like King of Thai I had all but given up hope on finding good Thai food in San Francisco. Despite skepticism, I decided to take my best friend (who is also a Thai enthusiast) out for her birthday with a group of our closest girlfriends.\n\nTo start let me just commend Marnee Thai for being extremely patient during the reservation process. I called the day before the dinner was to take place (which I felt bad for on such short notice for a Friday night). Marnee was more than happy to accommodate me and my party of 8 during peak hours on a Friday night. *If you have ever tried to get any number of  \"20-something\" girls together, on time, to go to anywhere on a Friday night you will feel my pain.* So, of course many of my friends were not ready to leave at the time of our reservation. I called and apologized to the staff and told them we would be late. They asked if I would like for them to hold our table, but having worked in the restaurant business myself, knowing it was peak hours on a Friday night, and my eight friends would probably not be ready for another full hour (a long enough time for Marnee to turn a table), I declined. When we arrived (a full hour after our reservation time) they were still polite to us and sat us within 5 minutes. They also get kudos for seating us in an intimate spot in the back, which was perfect for celebrating my best friends birthday with my rambunctious friends. \n\nWe order quite a bit of food, and Marnee was able to accommodate a friend in our party who had a peanut allergy (which is rare among Thai restaurants where peanuts are an integral part of cooking).  The food was extremely good. I would highly recommend the Beef Salad and the Avocado Salad (which was a special the night we went). Their Pad Thai was good, though comparable to the Pad Thai I got at my old Thai place. However, for me, the true test is always the Tom Kha Gai (the chicken coconut soup). Growing up in what I fondly refer to as \"eclectic family\" with a mother who doesn't cook much, instead of getting chicken soup when I was sick growing up my mom would run out and get me Tom Kha Gai. I was thoroughly impressed by their interpretation of Tom Kha Gai and will definitely go back for more of my childhood comfort food.We also ordered some beer and sake but surprisingly our bill was small for a party of 8. \n\nThose on here who complain about Marnee Thai's cost obviously are not accustomed to eating out in San Francisco. I am a college student, thus extremely poor, but taking my best friend out for her birthday did not break the bank.  What you pay for is definitely worth the quality. I had an amazing time celebrating my best friends birthday and was relieved to have finally found a quality Thai restaurant in the city that I can go to and take my family to when they are here visiting. I would highly recommend Marnee Thai to anyone searching for good Thai in San Francisco.", "author": "Sarah S."}

I'm a big fan of curry with coconut milk and i don't think i've had it served with duck meat anywhere else which made this really tasty.  The duck was of course, fatty, but damn, duck meat with the skin and fat with pineapple soaked in coconut curry goodness.....it does wonders.  \n\n- Chiliean Sea Bass with Garlic - good call, Terence.  probably the priciest dish, but definitely well cooked and flavored.  That garlic stayed with me for a while too, but it defintely made the dish that much better.  I also liked the veggies it came with (since none of my friends like vegs even green peas), but the fish was so tender.\n\n-Pad Kaprow (chicken sauteed with thai basils and chli garlic) - was good with rice.  not too spicy either.  \n\n-Spicy Angel Wings - this was what i tought was already good at Osha's but then, try Marnee Thai's who takes it up a notch and puts this sugary garlic and spices sauce which drenches these fried up chicken wings.  you can never go wrong with wings....but with this sauce??  u gotta jus get it whenever u come here.  \n\nI also like how they have a wine list....makes it seem like a classy thai place that way and I definitely got me a small glass of the thai red wine....eh, so so.. i shoulda picked somethin better.\n\nDefinitely gonna make a trip back", "author": "Vincent K."}

This was my first time here in this restaurant.\n\n1.  To start, we walked in around 6:30 pm on a weeknight (party of 3),  there wasn't anyone ahead of us in line.  The waitress told us to follow her, 3/4 into the restaurants, she said the table wasn't ready and told us to go back out and wait by the entrance even though there were 2 tables available.    \n\n2.  We waited & finally got seated, but no one was around to take our orders even though I tried to get their attention.  Finally, this woman shows up for work (we saw her walked in the front door and proceeded to the kitchen to put her purse down).\n\n3.  She then came over & started taking our order . . . She was EXTREMELY PUSHY and wanted us to order more food and in particular, order the more expensive dishes.  I have no problem paying more but I can't stand the PUSHINESS.  It was downright obnoxious!\n\n4.  The Drink - I ordered the Thai Sake but they didn't have it, so I settled on a regular hot sake.  They bought it to the wrong table (the one next to us).  The younger wait staff appeared to be totally inexperienced.\n\n5.  The Food - The soup was warm, not hot (in temperature), I don't understand why!  A young waiter brought out a dish which he said was Shrimps & Scallops.  Turns out it was the garlic Sea Bass that we ordered.  It was ok for $16.95.  I expected more.  But seriously, if he didn't know what the dish was, I'd prefer he didn't announce it and just say \"Enjoy\".  Then came the chicken curry, meat was dry and the taste was mediocre at best.  Once again, it was just warm, not hot.   We finally got the shrimps & scallops dish, it was the best one but still, it wasn't anything that special (although it was supposed to be one of the house specialties).  I've had much better Thai food elsewhere.\n\n6.  After we finished our meal, the waitress came back and wanted to take our dessert order.  When we declined, she seemed to disapprove our decision.  \n\n7.  On a side note, the table across from us got their check while they were waiting for their dessert.  When they asked our same waitress about the dessert, she said \"I didn't know you ordered dessert\".  Huh?  One of the 4 people said \"We have the little dishes and the forks sitting here waiting for our dessert\".  Oh, mine, it's like they have to prove it, how rude!  I'm sure they were not pleased!\n\nAt this point, I couldn't wait to get out of there when I heard \"Come back & see us soon\".  Well, I think NOT!

So, you ask why one star? Well, the last time I went, service was absolutely horrible (we didn't get the waiter and waitress we had in the past). First, we had to flag down the waitress to order. When we ordered, she had a \"I-could-care-less\" type of attitude.  Then, when our orders arrived, she put down all three bowls of soup at the side of the table. She didn't care to find out whose order was whose, and set it down at that person's place. Nope, she just set it down abruptly and walked away. We were left  experimenting each dish, just to find out whose soup was whose. It was ridiculous, especially considering that the bowls of soup were extremely hot to the touch and hard to move. \n\nThat was bad - but what was unacceptable was when the bill arrived. She had overcharged us for one dish. My dad went to tell her that she had overcharged us. She then gave us the cash difference - but my dad reminded her that they owed us not just the cash difference between the price of the dishes, but also the tax difference. She played dumb for a minute, and then said it was not their policy to refund tax. Then, she said very loudly - so that all patrons could hear -- \"What? You want two cents back? Fine! I'll give you two cents back!\" My dad replied, \"It's not the two cents - it's the fact that not only did you overcharge us, but you didn't properly refund us either for a mistake on your part.\" \n\nAfter all this - not one word of apology or an attempt to make up for this awfully poor experience. Instead, she tried to embarrass my dad for asking her to refund us completely for her mistake. We are not going back, no matter how good the food is.", "author": "Carolyn M."}

We finally decided to try it out (succumbing to the Zagat, Yelp logos at the entrance) on a week night not holding high hopes but to our surprise this restaurant delivered in a big way. \n\nDinner started with the coconut cake appetizer (which took a while to come but well-worth the wait) on the special menu. Made with rice floor, coconut, cream, sugar with grated coconut on top: the cake is soft on the inside crisp at the bottom cooked on a cast iron plate somewhat like those used for escargot. Add a dab of the spicy sour chilli sauce on the table and heaven had arrived on our taste buds.\n\nNext up was the bbq chicken. Ordinary looking but extemely well-favored, sweet lightly charred chicken so soft and tender they almost fell off the bones. Yum.\n\nThe green curry was slightly less thick than usual but nonetheless tasted fresh with the egg plant delicious in the mix.\n  \nService was top-notched. Water topped up relentlessly and hosts friendly. This is very likely the best Thai restaurant in the bay area (at least on that night). For once, Yelp rating makes sense  :).", "author": "M Y."}

Why? \n'With such shitty service and yet such great yelp reviews,' I thought, 'this place must have some BOMB-ass food!!'\n\nI was pretty excited. Another fifteen minutes passed, and our orders arrived. A text-messaged recommendation from an SF local friend prompted us to try the spicy Angel-wings. My sister and I both being in curry-licious moods, ordered the vegetarian red curry and the roasted duck curry.\n\nThe angel-wings were tasty. \"Nothing to write home about,\" my sister said. The curries were completely ordinary. \"Nothing to warrant a five-star review,\" I said.

I'm not sure why we stopped going.\n\nAnyways I hit up the one in 9nth incarnation recently. Wow it has changed. It used to be a really old mom and pop almost a dive type of restaurant. They've updated the furniture and decorations, but not overly so. I hate it when a place redecorates in attempt to look modern and it ends up being a pretentious & garish disaster. That didn't happen here.\n\nAnyways here was the hit list: Chilean Sea Bass, Angel Wings, Vegetarian Pad Thai, and Mango Crab Fried Rice. The dessert was Rotti with Coconut.\n\nThe Chilean Sea Bass was awesome! It had a flaky and mildy spiced exterior. Their was a hint of a Chili flavor in their that was nicely paired with the texture of the bass. The interior was succulent and juicy. What a flavorful fish! It was paired with some bok choy. The Chilean Sea Bass is a seasonal item. The waiter informed me that it was only available in the winter months.\n\nThe Angel Wings were good. Not as good as I remembered them, but I think that's because my palette has matured. A neat little tasty treat is to pour the sauce of the Angel Wings on to the rice. It's really delicious.\n\nThe Pad Thai and the Fried Rice were also great, but the Sea Bass really stole the show.\n\nThe Thai Ice tea was great! The tea was the perfect strength for me and the milk was added just right. Also it was lightly iced so the tea didn't taste diluted later.\n\nThe Rotti with Coconut Ice cream was a pleasant surprise as well. I learned that Rotti is a kind of fritter mixed with sugar and butter. It had a crispy exterior and a fluffy interior. Like all fried foods it is a great contrast to the ice cream. Our waiter was friendly and extremely helpful!\n\n\nGreat smelling bathrooms as well.", "author": "Poincare's Conjecture N."}

Mom is old school Chinese, which means she is frugal as hell...frugal like wear your clothes til they have holes in them, and when they can't be worn anymore, use them as rags, and when they can't be used as rags anymore, cut them into strips to tie things up with, and when they can't tie up anymore then...um ok I went a little too far haha.  Point being..if Mom says her meal was \"veh-lee good\" and worth the money, then Marnee is very good indeed.\n\nThe Hot Cakes listed on their 'Specials' menu are a must.  They take an extra 10-15 minutes but are totally worth the wait.  Perfectly crisp on the outside and ooey gooey on the inside, they are burn-the-roof-of-your-mouth HOT but oh so delicious.  \n\nPad Pra Ram was just as tasty: sauteed sliced chicken in peanut curry with coconut milk served on spinach.  This dish is the perfect accompaniment to a serving of rice.  It's also one of the few dishes that isn't marked as \"spicy\" which was great for Mom who can't handle spiciness. \n\nPad Thai is a must order wherever I go.  Marnee's version is good on flavor but is a bit dry.  \n\nOne star off for end-of-the-meal weirdness. I ordered dessert and asked some boxes.  Lady #1 takes our plates to box up, but forgets our rice so I ask Lady #2 to please box it up as well.  Lady #3 asks if we want to order dessert.  Um, we already did.  Lady #3 returns with just the tiny box of rice.  Er, we have 2 other entrees?  Lady #3 returns to the kitchen and comes out empty handed, runs over to Lady #1 and #2 with confused look on her face.  Lady #1 and 2 look at each other.  Mom and I look at each other like..what the fuck happened? Did they throw away our dishes?  Lady #1 asks what we ordered and Lady #2 asks if we want to order dessert [AGAIN!!]. In my head: Are you gonna cook us our dishes again or what?  I want my leftovers!!  All of a sudden, a bag emerges from the back.  Where the hell was it this entire time?  I double check to make sure it's actually our food.  It is.  *whew!*  Well that was weird. \n\nThankfully the mango sticky rice was delicious and the presentation was quite lovely.  Other than the near fiasco, Marnee Thai did not disappoint.

We came in on an early Saturday night around 6pm and the place was somewhat empty. The space was quite small (narrow and long), but the overall ambiance was nice except that there was a loud refrigerator type noise constantly go on and off. \n\nWe ordered the Golden Triangles Thai Samosas, Soft shell crab with green papaya salad, and basa fillet. Let me tell you, the samosas were the best I've ever had. EVAR! They were pipin' hot, crunch on the outside, and amazingly flavorful on the inside. The soft shell crab on green papaya salad was quite good too. The crab was fried, very crunchy and seasoned nicely. It was definitely the way to make a healthy papaya salad instantly become unhealthy with fried goodness. The basa fillet was nothing to rave about and I'd likely try something else next time. I like the flavor of peppercorn, but am not too much of a fan of whole peppercorns in the dish, so I ended up picking them all out. \n\nService was very responsive here. Water was always filled and it was easy to get the attention of the waiters. During the time we went, the cooks/employees were also having their meal, and boy did I want to know what they were eating too!

We were seated in the waiting area for a few minutes but were handed menus to peruse while we waited, after a short wait, we were seated.  While we sat, our water was filled, and more time was given for us to browse through the menu.  We started by ordering the Angel Wings..basically chicken wings fried and then basted with this honey, barbeque gingery sauce..a lot of sauce.  Once you get thru all the sauce, you get down to some tender yummy chicken.  I cleaned them down to the bones. =) yum.  Next came our chicken satay dish (?) i think, and the pad see maw. We asked for everything to be extra spicy...\n\nThe chicken satay dish was good, the chicken was tender, tasty and there were slices of green pepper in it.  Good, nothing to write home about...and definitely not spicy.  So we dipped into the pad see maw...IS there ANY spices in this dish at all?? Yes, it was tasty, saucy and a generous portion..but we asked for EXTRA spicy..and i hardly got a kick. \n\nAll in all...my date was the best part of the dinner ;)", "author": "Lulu C."}

Made a reservation a few days before, and we were immediately seated upon walking in.  One of our friends who has been here several times and is from Thailand did all the ordering for our table.  Everything was so good!  The only complaint would be the time it took for us to get our food.  Seemed like there were a few tables around us all getting their meals and we were still waiting on our appetizers.  Also, we were seated in the back of the restaurant very close to the bathroom...not so pleasant :( \n\nThe food itself was REALLY good and well worth a trip back!", "author": "Julie M."}

We had a party of eight and we probably waited no longer than 15 or 20 minutes max on a busy Friday night.  Talk about accommodating.  Most places wait until your entire party is present before even seating a party that large.  I ordered the spicy tofu which was just perfect.  You could specify the hotness so I went for a medium hot which had just enough savory spiciness without overwhelming the system.  We shared some appetizers and desserts all of which made my mouth and stomach satisfied.  The prices weren't terribly expensive either.  I think our bill was about $150 including drinks and dessert.

(note the use of usually) But extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures I say. Here's why...\n\nI saw a favorable review on \"Check please--Bay Area\" and made a reservation a day in advance for my mother's birthday. Knowing the popularity of the place I asked the host if this was feasible and whether we had any chance of getting in. He assured me it was, so I decided it was worth the risk.\n\n We show up 20 min before the res. time just to check in, but find a crushing, bewildering morass of customers with, and without reservations, some still waiting for tables 1 hour after their previously scheduled res. time, yet other \"walk-ups\" with large parties seem to be getting in at a fraction of a wait than those waiting for hours. All this compounded by an overly passive, avoidant waitstaff who seem to be  inwardly praying, \"if we just ignore them, maybe they'll all go away.\" \n\nTime passes, our res. time comes and goes. I kindly ask the \"host\" every 15 mins. where we are on the list, he checks my name and so utters the soon oft repeated refrain, \"give me five more minutes.\"  Another half hour passes. In walks the local celebrity reviewer, dripping false modesty, featured on said show, unannounced with 2 more guests than our party. He of course is seated ahead of us. (To be fair, if I was the owner and in walked the man responsible for 10's of thousands of $'s of new business, I would make special allowances too) Another 15 minutes later, I ask where we are on list, \"5 more minutes please.\" So, the host remains content to both deny us the chance of having a meal there while simultaneously frittering away the time we could be spending at another restaurant. After waiting an hour past the scheduled res. time, we gave up, settling for a passable Indian place down the street. \n\nLook Marnee Thai, I applaud your success and understand how longer waits ensue. But don't give false assurances that everything will be fine, reservations will be honored and customers will be fairly helped in due time, due order; because YOU WON'T! You simply won't. Make it a first come first served establishment, or find a way to honor your reservations rather than bypassing them out of neglect, incompetence or sheer favoritism to local \"celebrity.\"", "author": "Barney F."}

Now if I eat out of that bucket I have to pay, whereas if they had just brought one rice bowl, LIKE WE HAD REQUESTED, we would've had just the right amount of rice and not have to pay for rice we won't even eat.  \n\nI know what you're thinking... but they leave the big buckets of rice for everyone!

The food took about 25 minutes to arrive and when I got the food, I dug right in. My friend said that they usually don't overdo the spiciness but this time it was over the top and I had to agree because my pad thai was overly flavorful. That doesn't sound like a bad thing right? Well.. its like there are too many spices and flavors that its overwhelming and its no longer savory.\nI wouldn't mind coming back here again since the price is reasonable but I wouldn't want to wait in line to get a seat if I know that the quality of the food will decrease as well.

The flavors are just impeccable, nothing about Marnee is underwhelming.", "author": "Mirabella C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-29", "description": "Marnee Thai is my MOST FAVORITE restaurant in SF.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE Marnee Thai.  They have two locations, one on 9th and the original one on 22nd and Irving.  Some people say that the original one is the best, but what some people fail to acknowledge is that the REAL original chef... the one that won ten thousand cooking awards... is the chef at the 9th and Irving restaurant.  I've never been to the one on 22nd, but all i know is that the one on 9th ROCKS MY SOCKS! \n\nThe restaurant seems small when you first walk in, but they also have a back room with some tables back there.  So, the restaurant actually seats quite a lot of people.  The waitresses are all thai, and you know how I know?  Because I've been to Thailand, and I've heard their language, and they also write all the orders in Thai.  You can't say that this place is not authentic.  The waitresses are really attentive, and offer great service.\n\nEverything on the menu is pretty much SUPERB!  My favorites are Angel Wings or Angel Tofu.  They have a sauce that they use on the wings or tofu, just like the San Tung wings, but with a different twist and just as good, or better!!  did I really just say it was better than San Tung chicken wings??  Yes, I did.  When I tried the angel tofu, it made me a bigger fan of tofu... so now I always get the angel tofu when I'm with friends because I want people to know how good tofu can be! \n\nMy 2nd favorite dish would be their Hor Mok.  It is Sea Bass (I think) in curry mousse, with cabbage and some other veggies.  The fish is cooked in a leaf, and is just really... one of the best things I have ever had!  When they don't have this, I get their other fish--BASA FILLET ................................................................................................................................12.50\n  ....Basa fillet pan-seared topped with you choice of sauce\n  ....* Pork, ginger, mushrooms and onions\n  ....* Spicy mushroom and Thai herb in curry sauce. (with coconut milk)\n  ....* Fresh garlic and black pepper sauce\n\nIt's really good.  Its the closest thing they have to the 3-flavored fish in other restaurants.\n\nMy 3rd favorite is their Pad Kee Mao.  Their spicy noodle sauce is sooo good.  It's not dry, instead, it's very flavorful!  I absolutely love it.  \n\nMarnee Thai is so good that we always order it for catering for UCSF school events.  \n\nYou can't really go wrong with anything at Marnee Thai!!  If you haven't ever tried this place, put it on your places-to-eat-list.  You won't regret it.", "author": "Diane L."}

My absolute favorite Thai restaurant, although its more like Thai food with a twist.  All the sauces are incredible.\n\nMust eat:  Miang kum - very creative, the pine nuts really make it pop.\n\nPumpkin samosas - just a little bit spicy, perfectly crispy outside.\n\nCorncake fritters - unbelievable.\n\nAvocado and shrimp salad - comes with green unripened (and therefore crunchy) mango, and its a perfect mix of spicy and sweet, ever thing is fresh.  Maybe a bit too much lettuce.\n\nTry the seasonal dishes (special menu) in general, they're just about always awesome like the Mango Fried Rice.  \n\nCurries are all fabulous, I prefer the green for some reason.\n\nThe roast duck over spinach is always a pleasant treat.  You think for a second that it might be too salty, then its not.  Perfectly cooked, well balanced with the spinach.\n\nIf I get noodles, its generally Pad-see-ew, as that's my favorite in general, and my favorite at Marnee Thai.  There's a hint of smokey flavour that is just very enticing.\n\nYou can't go wrong with coconut ice cream in fried roti with condensed milk for dessert.  It for some reason reminds me of an Asian pazookie.  \n\nAll in all, I love it.  My dad is Thai, he loves it.  Everyone I've brought here loves it.", "author": "T C."}

On the long road trip, everyone in the group got to know each other. One lady became close to me. We talked about everything on the journey until we stumped on the topic of \"The best Thai Restaurant in town\", She insisted that \"Marnee Thai was her picked for the best Thai Restaurant in the whole Bay Area\". She discovered this place years ago when her daughter took her here, she got hooked with the food and have traveled all the way across the bay just to have the food here all the time. \n    Her passion about this place convinced me that I had to try the food here sometimes. And that time finally came.\n   The other day, I finally had a chance to drove across the town to come to Marnee Thai. I found the decoration is decent, nice - cozy and the service was wonderful. I found their service to be very accommodate and very helpful. They were very fast when I asked for anything. The food came out in order and nicely timing. So what makes me give Marnee Thai only 3 stars. well... it's food itself. \n\n  \n   Sorry, Francis (the one who said Marnee Thai got best Thai food ever!). But I am Thai and would like to think that I know what 's the best Thai food should test like and Marnee Thai does NOT LIVE UP TO MY HIGH STANDARD. There was nothing wrong with Marnee Thai's food just not that great as Francis claimed.  \n\n   We ordered so many dishes, just to make sure we tried many things. As we came a long way and intended to take some leftover home for later on. \n\n   We ordered Satay both chicken and Beef - Chicken Satay was O.K. but Beef Satay was too salty in my book. Then we ordered the corn cake and Shimp Roll which were O.K. Then we ordered Mango Salad with Soft shell crab and Jan Pad Phoo ( just like Pad Thai but with crab meat which were the best dishes from this place but Mix seafood dish and Barbeque pork disappointed me again, they were just O.K. \n    So I totally understand Francis why love this place so much- they offer a decent food in a very nice and friendly atmosphere but now that  I have tried this place So I claim that SHE WAS WRONG. \n\n    So now it's my turn to invite Francis to my favorite Thai restaurant here in Bay Area and we will shall see... what she would say.", "author": "Dom G."}

I also got the cocnut ice cream with fried banana. Their coconut ice cream really had REAL coconut blended in. Mmmm. All that filling meal was only 34 something. I'm coming back here!\n\nCustomer service was 5 stars. The owner there I suppose was super nice and explained the menu to each customer very well.

Finally, last night I had the chance.  After a warm welcome by the pleasant wait staff two of us (another Thai food fan)  were seated and the menu looked terrific, especially the daily \"specials\" menu.  \n\nI must say what was terrific stopped right there.  A fried soft shell crab over mango salad was, at best, passable with the crab tasting less than fresh under its far too heavy breading and served on a bed of  shredded mango (a bright spot)  Then came the Thai potstickers - sodden lumps which were just downright pasty with few of the wonderful flavors of what were to be the ingredients coming through at all. Ahhhh, and then Pad Thai - always a good indication of a Thai kitchen. Soggy noodles with rubbery overcooked prawns and some wilted coriander on top - yikes what happened here? New people in the kitchen?  Our final selection before deciding to order more was Chicken Curry with potatoes and  peanuts - it reminded me perfectly of a Delta Airlines lunch in 1999.  And we stopped ordering there.\n\nLet's just say, having been in the restaurant business for years, I am well-aware that there can be disaster kitchen nights. But it really felt like something else was going on here; everything was just not very good.\n\nBut hey - those chicken wings everybody raves about were sure being consumed around us, especially by what seemed the local UCSF crowd. Will I venture back to give it another chance?  I really don't think so. But I sure wish the pleasant wait staff well.", "author": "Richard H."}

I did and I loved it! \nCurry, fried rice, noodles; all delicious! I even enjoyed the Thai iced tea! I usually don't care for it.\n\nI've tried both locations on Irving and I like the 9th & Irving location better. There's more ambiance, but it is a bit more crowded and tables are really close together. I also think the 9th & Irving one gives you more food and tastes a bit better, too. The one on 23rd & Irving has a more clean-cut feel to the decor and the service is not as nice as the other one. Parking is easier around the 23rd & Irving one, though.\n\nHands down my favorite Thai restaurant in the city now. If you're craving Thai, go to Marnee's!

Velvety and still chewy wide rice noodles with a sticky sweet/spicy coating.  It is delicious and the best take on this dish I've had.    Their curries and fried rice are also pretty darn tasty.  \n\nI still haven't gone back for their Pad Thai that I very much disliked, but maybe I should give it a try again.  For Pad Thai I'm still partial to Lers Ros on Larkin (or the too pricey Baan up Irving at 7th ave, there's is delicious if probably too moist for some people)\n\n\nOld Review Below:\n----\nI do not get it.  One of me least favorite Thai places I've been to.  \n\nFirst off: The Pad Thai.   Absolutely horrible.  It tastes mildly of how vomit smells.  (I think it is tomato paste or ketchup that causes this).   The Pad Thai that the chef won an award for HAD to be different.  (EDIT: they used to have a recipe on the wall that mentioned katsup... this is no longer the case)\n\nI ordered some kind of salad a few years ago, and I still think of it as the worst salad I've ever had.  The avocado was brown and mushy, the lettuce wilted and the shrimp rubbery.   \n\nA few times I have had the sausage and roast pork over rice with gravy.  This has been ok most of the time; but one time it tasted really spoiled.\n\nI do not understand the hype.  \n\nMy suggestions:   For SPICY \"authentic\" thai:  Lers Ros.\nFor super tasty, consistently high quality, and a bit tamer (like Marnee attempts), Chai Yo on Polk.", "author": "howard t."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-08", "description": "Let me first start off by saying whoever said the angel wings were finger licking good was absolutely right. Just think of thai influenced buffalo wings. The sauce was terrific. i've never tasted anything like it before. Maybe it's common in thai cuisine but it was pretty original in terms of what I've eaten. And the fact that the chicken was fried definitely made a difference in the taste. If it had been sauteed or some other method, it would not have been as good. This proves taht the chef knows what he's doing.\n\nI had the pad thai. It wasn't anything special to me. I wasn't particularly fond of the sauce or the peanuts. This seems to be more of a personal choice though. I don't think ive ever really been a fan of pad thai. I heard the pad thai was good here so i wanted to try it to see if it was just cause I never had good pad thai. But i think it's just cause i'm not a fan of it. I had to drench it in hot sauce for it to fit my taste.\n\nThe environment was a little cramped and clustered for my tastes. I was seated next to this shelf that was stacked full of little knickknacks and statues. My friends couldn't even back their chairs up or else they'd hit the chair of the person from another table. The seating was pretty uncomfortable. And the table was too small to hold the dishes so my friend had to do some manuevering to be able to enjoy her meal. THis was partly the waitors' fault for not clearing the plates. \n\nOverall service was decent. Not crappy. But not just okay. They did constantly refill our water which had lemon wedges in them to give them a classier look. The food came out quickly which was great because I was almost starving. The waiter did forget my hot sauce and then proceeded to help other tables in clearing their dishes and taking their checks. But then he took one look at me and remembered he forgot the hot sauce and ran to go get it. And then he apologized for forgetting it. Everyone forgets once in awhile, as long as they look sincere and apologize, it's no biggy. \n\nThe portions were bigger than what I'm used to at the usual thai restaurants. I'm usually barely content when i eat elsewhere but i actually could not finish my meal this time. My friend's thai iced tea was larger than normal too, but she got ripped off because half of it was ice. So suggestion, ask for less ice or no ice if you don't want to get ripped off on that. THat's how they get you.\n\nThis place is more of a sit down, share plates kind of dinner more than order your own thing. Rice has to be ordered separetly. 1.50 per bowl per person. If you're eating the entrees, you'd probably need two bowls so that becomes pretty costly. And it's kind of cheap of them to do that. \n\nOverall the angel wings really put me over the top. If i came back here, and tried everythign I wanted to try, I would definitely order the angel wings over and over. As for the pad thai, i'd pass on that next time and try something new. \n\n3 stars for customer service, speed of the kitchen, and a decent pad thai. The fourth star for the amazing angel wings.", "author": "Karen C."}

And while I haven't had enough of the menu to determine the authenticity of Marnee Thai, it is the first restaurant here that has sweet roti - fried dough drizzled in condensed milk and powdered sugar - on the menu.  This was a street vendor delicacy that I fell in love with in Bangkok and have been searching for ever since.  Thai roti, btw, is different from the savory Malaysian/Indian roti served with curry.  Unfortunately, the roti sounded more like a funnel cake than a large, light fried crepe folded in over itself into a square (that I was looking for), so I passed on it.  Sounds good for someone with a sweet tooth, though!\n\nThe restaurant is small and narrow, with a splash of vivid fake flower and fruit offerings and a painting(?) of King Rama that happily reminded me of Thailand.  It is not a romantic place by any means though.  You'd go here for the food, not the atmosphere.\n\nWe started out with tom ka gai, which was standard in quality, imo.  A light, red-flecked broth with white chicken meat, straw mushrooms, a few slivers of tender galangal (a nice surprise), and lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves for flavor.\n\nWe then had hau mok (on the special menu), a steamed 'casserole' of tender white fish fillet layered over cabbage, and embedded in a mousse of red-curry-flavored coconut milk.  All topped with a soft, custardy egg.  It makes a good comfort food and I enjoyed the texture, but at the same time, I wish it had a little more flavor \"oomph\".  I relied a bit on the kruang prung (four flavors of condiments you can ask for, to add spicy and salty tones to your food) for this.  My dining companion noted that it was \"okay, but grew on you\".\n\nLastly, and the best dish in our opinion, was chan pad poo, a thin rice noodle dish with an chili garlic sauce that was perfectly balanced in spicy, savory, tangy, and sweet tones, and studded with crab (real crab, I'm guessing the canned variety for convenience).  I thought it was perfectly spicy, but my tastes run a little spicier than others, so you may ask for a slightly milder version, if necessary.  This is the one dish that we'd definitely order again, and recommend to others to get!", "author": "Laurie L."}

After a yearlong Yelping hiatus, I find myself writing another review, even though I believed my online wordsmith days were done. But if you were at Marnee Thai with me last night, you'd see I have no choice. You weren't there. You didn't meet May. You just don't know. \nSuch is the power of auntie May, the owner of this slice of deliciousness. When she completely disagrees with everything you order and decides she knows your tastebuds better than you do, you shrug and go with it (turns out she's right anyway). When she asks you to taste the steaming pork potstickers even though you're a loyal vegetarian, you take a little bite. And finally, as you're leaving, if she gives you an impromptu personality reading, declares your husband \"caring and kind\", and then asks you to review her on Yelp - well, you just do it. \nI see a lot of reviews debating the authenticity of the food here. Honestly, I don't really care. It's supremely tasty, and that's what counts. That goes for the aforementioned potstickers in green curry sauce, the corn cakes with a fresh diced topping of cucumbers and onions, golden triangles filled with pumpkin, and spicy green beans with tofu and mushrooms. Cannot speak for my husband's chicken with ginger, lemongrass, and peppercorns. But it looked pretty, which is half the battle in my book. \nIf I don't give Marnee five stars, it's only because the service really could use a good kick in the pants. It wasn't that we had particularly poor service ourselves. Everyone who showed up at our table was smiling, friendly - or in the case of auntie May, endearingly straight talking. But it takes a while to get anyone's attention, whether to find out the wait for a table, or get a copy of the daily specials.  \nHowever, none of this detracts from the amazingly tasty Thai goodness on our plates. It may have been the cold, rainy weather outside that made everything better, but you can bet I'll be back on a sunny day to test this theory. And if May orders me to update my Yelp review...well, that part may just be non-negotiable.", "author": "Purnima M."}

To die for.\n\nTom Kha Soup - a spicy traditional Thai soup with the coolness of coconut milk to complement it.  I usually don't like ordering this in Thai restaurants because they make it too sour and it makes me think something inside is spoiled - but Marnee makes it JUST RIGHT.  I could drink the whole pot by myself... oh wait I did...\n\nBasa Fillet with Garlic Sauce - yeah yeah yeah the vegetarian police can get on my ass for this one, but it's Marnee's fault for making this SO GODDAMN good.  Tender but not mushy fish, it literally flakes off and melts in your mouth... and the contrast with the fragrant crunchy fried garlic makes me squeeze my legs tight in fear of a gushing orgasm.  If anything is worth breaking my usually strict vegetarian rules for, this is it... ten times over...\n\nThere's no BAD dish I had here, just some not-so-impressive ones. The Pad Thai and fresh spring rolls are pretty good but I think I make it better (and w/ no yucky fish sauce).  Mango w/ sticky rice dessert is good but portion is a bit small (of course I'm used to the big ass plate they gave me when I ordered at Noodle World in LA... oh how I miss you Noodle World...)\n\nThe place is a bit tiny (you can hear the neighboring table's conversation) so large parties and claustrophobics aren't recommended... oh but what the hell I'm claustrophobic and I frequent this place once a month.

Marnee Thai definitely not much to look and had a bit of a weird smell but the food was good.  Really this should be 3.5 stars. Had pumpkin chicken curry and duck red curry both good. The BBQ chicken was also very good. We got garlic basil chicken and a chicken salad which were both flavored well but they used ground chicken. I don't know why but I really dislike the texture of ground chicken.   Had a pad dish with crab which some of my fellow eaters thought bland. \n\nMany of us had Thai tea since we were such a big group the brought the pot they used but did not have decorated tea pots which I though was strange. \n\nBy dessert we were full but shared an order of fried banana and honey as well as Roti. I had never had Roti before and the fried dough with condensed milk was very good. \n\nIn sum the food was definitely good and they had a lot of options.

My appetizer came with a beautiful orchid and other garnishes. The Thai women who work there wear traditional tailored Thai dresses (very elegant) and are quick and attentive.\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that the place is a bit cluttered, which takes away form the ambiance. I sympathize with them on this, because it is a small place, and they do a lot of business there, so have to have their to-go containers, napkin-folding area, etc. right out where it's close to your table. The former bar is used for these things. Anyway, I kind of hate to knock off a star for this, but it is one aspect that sometimes might make other Thai restaurants more appealing. \n\nIn any case I'll definitely be back to Marnee often if the food and service continues to be as good as what I experienced today.\n\nNOTE: I've since been back for lunch, and it wasn't quite such a magical experience. The lunch special portion is just slightly less than what one would expect for a complete lunch. And no traditional Thai dresses on the servers at lunch time. They seemed understaffed and rushed.

The spring rolls weren't the best I've ever had, but we did get quite the lesson on the importance of the sauce that's served with them - she even served it onto our plates for us.

Finally, a place that really challenges the flavors I fell in love with this past summer traveling through Thailand, but better, because I am 15 minutes from home, not 15 hours...So my friend the world-music-reggae-rockstar who grew up mere blocks away said you were the best in the city, hands down. Oh, how you surpassed expectations. \nNow the important stuff. It was real, service impeccable, authentic, high quality ingredients, fresh, legit. It looked like everything was epic,   I had the green curry, epic, chicken padkrapow, large and in charge good spicing, and fresh fresh veggies with tofu in a chili garlic sauce, bomb, usually i'm bored by tofu, but not this tofu, it was all good. I have to go back and try more. Pad Thai looked awesome, papaya salad looked amazing and bigger, nothing looked bad to me, open kitchen can see the legitness, very key, clean and efficient, rockin!\nYou know its the kill when you finish eating stuffed and stoked, and you see the masterful elderly asian family next to you feast arrive and had to ask the waiter what it all was to hope to remember and order it next time. \nWorth the minor parking karma issues, but hey its still only 15 minutes away, not 15 hours, and its just as good as anything Bangkok can offer.", "author": "Adam S."}

I'd like to say that I'm fairly well experienced with Thai food in general, so Marnee Thai had some tough standards to stick up to.\n\nWhen I first arrived, I saw a small group of people waiting inside and outside the restaurant. I could see they were incredibly busy and bustling, but I still received excellent service. I arrived about 20 minutes before my actual reservation, but they sat me as soon as they had a table, which was really nice :) My date hadn't even arrived yet haha, and they still sat me down. \n\nThe environment was a little bit crazy with all the waiters and waitresses working their asses off, but for the customers, it was a very relaxed environment. It was a little bit loud and bustling, but very comfortable at the same time.\n\nWe ordered the two items from the specials menu: the hot cakes and the sea bass. My date ordered a garlic-based pork dish. \n\nDespite the crazy business of the restaurant, they served us within a very reasonable time, and the food was GREAT. The hot cakes were a little bit sweet, but pretty good. The texture was really interesting and wonderful and fun- crispy on the outside and milky on the inside. I wasnt SUPER crazy about them, but they were nice and light, but heavy with substance at the same time. Definitely good stuff. The pork dish was good- the flavors were well done, and it was a beautifully served dish with a pretty flower on the side :D The sea bass was AMAZING. I got it with the spicy coconut curry sauce (there are three different sauces offered with it), and holy crap it was good. The sea bass was PERFECTLY cooked, wonderfully crispy on the outside and melt-in-your-mouth delicious on the inside. The sauce was great, and the mushrooms taht went with it really added to the flavor. The image of it was great, too- a wonderfully red, tasty looking sauce topped with some green spice (parsley??) to add some viewing constrast. The sea bass was DEFINITELY a keeper. Absolutely wonderful. My date even commented on how good it was, and he's not much of a foodie himself xP\n\nI can't wait to go back to Marnee Thai to try out their other dishes!! I was looking around at other tables, and it seems like you really can't order the wrong thing :)", "author": "Jade R."}

It's located right near the 9th Street entrance/exit from Golden Gate Park, which is usually why I go there. Parking nearby is hard to come by though. If it's lunch time, the restaurant is extremely busy and has a half hour wait.\n\nThe Service: We got ignored all the time. It took forever for the waitress to take our order and forever for them to give us our food. When we got our food, I noticed that the table next to us didn't get their meal yet. Then two other tables got their food. Why didn't the first table get their food yet? Also, when our water glasses were near empty, we tried to get the waiter to fill our glasses. The waiter went to the table to the left and filled their glasses. Then he went to the table to our right. He didn't even fill our glasses. Really? All you had to do was turn your body 180 degrees.\n\nThe Food: Even though the service is terrible, the food is good. Their pad see ew is one of the best I've ever had. It's well made and really flavorful. Their award winning pad thai recipe is ok. The pad kee mao depends on who makes it. The first time I had it, the dish was incredible. The second time, the noodles tasted sour. (It's supposed to be salty and spicy.)\n\nAll In All: Marnee Thai has good food and terrible service. Instead of waiting forever for a table and then get snubbed by the wait staff, I'd recommend you save yourself the trouble and just order to go.", "author": "Jessica M."}

If you are a Pad Thai or Fried Rice eater I suggest you try something outside the box. Although both are really good\n\nFor appetizers I recommend the \"Spicy Angel wings\" (Deep fried chicken wings sauteed with chili-garlic sauce, top with crispy basil. Let me tell you they are dam good, and filling. I suggest picking some up for your super bowl party as you will be the man.  Moving to the main course I was disturbed reading the bad reviews regarding the curry dishes.  Number 23 \"Kang Ka Ree\" (Mild curry with coconut milk, turmeric, fresh herbs and spices with Yukon potatoes) with chicken is so Davine. To me it has a Indian curry presence about it.  Its the perfect for 2 people.  The Pad Prig Khing (Choice of chicken, beef or pork sauteed with spicy chili paste and string beans) complements the entire course with the sweet hot chili flavor leaving a everlasting taste on your palate.\n\nOver all Marnee Thai = Bomb.  The Thai Iced tea is tasty, the service is good, and the bathrooms are clean.  The only negative thing I have to say is parking sucks.

It also didn't help that they had a big fan at the entrance blowing hot air into the restaurant, but at least they served ice water.\n\nI ordered the Thai fried rice with pork and Chinese sausage and it was delicious.

Chose a classic, Kee Mao with chicken requesting very spicy...ended up with some bland noodles lightly doused in a tomato sauce with a drizzle of what could only have been Tobasco sauce on top...essentially the worst Kee Mao I've ever had.  A good Kee Mao should be spicy, have that wonderful oil seeping on the dish, and a delectable smoky flavor (must have been Norweigans cooking pasta in the back room since it was very bland.)  No such luck today.  Second entree, a curry with tofu and the one redeeming point here was the curry flavor was good, but oops forgot to put anything, but two small cubes of tofu.  Ended up eating dinner again two hours later due to severe hunger and also had that burning frustration from searching for parking in vicinity of the restaurant...all for not.\n\nWhat was positive? Ambiance very positive, service was good, got in right away with reservation, and definitely others find it exciting...all adding to the experience.  If you're choosing the social experience or maybe trying more of the appetizers and don't need an actual meal it might just meet some of the expectations out there.\n\nIn the end, it is time to move on to another Thai restaurant. The Mad Yelper is still searching.", "author": "Mad Yelper X."}

All agreed that it was some of the most delicious Thai food that we have had.\n\nThe staff was incredible, remaining calm and pleasant despite a stressful situation.  The receptionist was a delight, keeping us regularly informed of the progress on getting a table.  The servers were quick, and they were pleasant and helpful.  Our order came amazingly quickly, and the servers were readily available when we needed a refill of the ever-delicious Thai iced tea and a Singha beer.  The angel wings were a surprisingly delicious appetizer.  The massaman curry chicken was an excellent and very tasty not-so-spicey dish with some crispy basil thrown in as a pleasant surprise.  The pad thai was among the best, and a silver noodle plate and a salad with some fruits in it were delightful.  For dessert the mangos and sticky rice were great, and the roti with ice cream was an unexpectedly delicious treat.\n\nMarnee Thai is an exemplary San Francisco hole-in-the-wall restaurant--one to which I will invite touring friends who want to see why San Franciscans love their city.

Beef w/one of the curries was tender & the bamboo shoots tasted fresh vs. out of a can.\n\nFried bananas w/honey was good -- the honey itself tasted high quality, free flowing and sweet.\n\nThe only downside was that the owner wasn't there that night b/c she often gives you a face-reading/fortune whether you ask for it or not (at least she did in the past when I ate at their other location).", "author": "D L."}

When the dish arrived, it had pork in it instead of prawns! I noticed this right away - fair enough, I guess \"pork\" and \"prawn\" sound similar - so I wasn't particularly worried and the server took it away to cook up another dish. Problem was, the dish came back just a few seconds later and it seemed to me that there was still meat in it... I got my husband to try it and he said it definitely tasted like meat - we even saw (and he tasted) some pieces of meat that could not be mistaken for anything else. At this point I lost all confidence in the meal and couldn't eat any more. \n\nI was really disappointed as I have read many good reviews about this place, but I certainly won't be going back.", "author": "Laura J."}

My friends and I ordered 4 dishes, and we ate everything.  1) it was because we were very hungry; 2) the portions are kind of small.  The raisins in the mango fried rice gave it a unique sweet flavor, which contrasted well with the savory part of the dish.  I liked the chewiness of the wide noodles in the pad see ew, but they may have been slightly overcooked because it was soft.  The pad thai was a bit too sweet and tangy.  Eggplant with ground pork was flavorful, but it was too salty.  Overall, the food was pretty good.", "author": "Cindy H."}

It's a noodle dish similar to Pad Thai, but with crab noodles and it's got a bit of a tangy taste to it.  The only 2 complaints I have about this place is:  #1 - horrible parking (which is out of their control) and #2 - inconsistency in the flavor.

Although I'm not sure if it really has crab in it (if so, it's in miniscule pieces), the flavor is amazing.    The avocado salad is almost like having a dessert but with fish sauce in it - I know that sounds gross, but it works in this salad.   The staff are always courteous, albeit a little harried.

We went here for dinner with my BF's dad and were not disappointed! For three of us, we ordered enough food for five. We had 5 appetizers and 4 entrees! Everything was even better than the last! We had a spring roll made with shrimp that was just perfect. Chicken satay with a great peanut sauce. Soft- shell crab ( I tried a bite, but I dislike soft-shell) that the boys said was great. Golden Triangle with a veggie filling. Then we had duck, sea bass with black pepper and garlic, yellow chicken curry (a little heavy with potatoes), and I had a mixed veggie dish with peanut sauce. We only made it out of there with a SMALL box of takeout! We also had two hot teas, coconut juice, and 4 beers. We made it out of the door for $109! That's incredible! Every dish was so full of flavor and layered with the right amount of spice! Even writing this review, I want to go back to try more.

We also ordered the rice noodles with crab, which is basically like Pad Thai with crab. It had the perfect amount of crab with a bit of sweet and spicyness to it.  It was just my boyfriend and I and we left nothing on the plates.  We are definetly coming here at least once a month.  The 35 minute drive from Oakland to one of the busiest parts of SF is worth it.  Oh yeah, and I recommend that you make reservations and request to be seated in the back of the restaurant.

We stopped by on a late afternoon and we were the only guests along with a couple a couple of tables down from us. My friend and I were dress casually in jeans, a t-shirt and our chucks and the couple were dressed a bit more uppity than us. We walked in with smiles and asked for a table for two and the waitress tossed her hands indicating we could sit anywhere. She didn't even greet us or crack a smile. She just had this dull, rude expression on her face--like she didn't want us there or something. We BARELY GOT any attention while the couple got asked questions like \"How's the food there? More water, sir?\" And when they left, they said goodbye to them; whereas when we left we didn't get ZIP! What the hell is going on there?? And they got my friend's order wrong and overcharged her (that goes to show how much attention they payed to us, huh?) I felt so disgusted by their service I didn't finish my food and left a dollar tip ( they didn't even deserve the dollar but, eh, i'm nice). \n\nI just wanted to yell at the waitress for treating us so poorly. And I am not exaggerating either. \n\nPersonally, I know I won't be making a trip back here--at least not to this location.", "author": "Van D."}

The only thing which I and three of my companions really liked was Tom Ka Gai.\n\nThe duck in red curry and  Pad Kee Mao pork were OK,  Chilean sea bass was dripping fish oil and had strong fishy taste, pretty much ruined. Pad Thai shrimp was not good at all either. \n\nBut the worst thing was the service. The server was very rude, tried rushing us through ordering (there were just three tables occupied in the entire restaurant), suggesting that we just go for specials instead of considering dishes from the menu.. Then when we tried to get four cups for the three person serving of Tom Ka Gai it was again a problem - three cups max! Trying to understand her when she was reciting the options was impossible because of a strong accent. \n\nOverall the attitude reminded the proverbial \"Soup Nazi\" from Seinfeld.

Marnee looks up through the window with that \"Just saw you on America's Most Wanted\" look on her face. I knew at that moment there was/is NO OTHER Thai place. She gave me the stare down. I had left the gang. Was she going to come out with her crew and make me go through the Marnee \"beat down\" again? I felt dirty!  So I let time pass before going back. Thought I'd give the place a break. Then I missed the taste of Pad Kee Mao with duck! The Green Papaya salad! and yes...Marnee herself.

We had asked for the luncheon menu which he never brought to us.  We flagged down the waitress who brought 1 luncheon menu for 2 people to read.  The restaurant only had 6 people in it so there was no shortage of luncheon menus.  We both ordered the Pad Thai with shrimp.  The food was not evenly distributed with one plate having much less food than the other.  The Pad Thai was delicious and they did return numerous times to refill the water glasses.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-19", "description": "Thai food at its best!\n\nQuite often, when I, as a skinny, pale white dude, ask for \"extra spicy\" at a Thai, Indian, or other endemically-spicy-cuisine restaurant, I can almost see the staff's eyes glaze over as they make the food maybe 1% more spicy, lest the delicate honky's head explode and he run screaming, like a decapitated chicken, from the restaurant, thus depriving them of revenue. This, however, is not the case at Marnee Thai. My dining companions (one of whom loves spicy food in all its iterations, the other of whom likes heat in moderation) ordered the Pad Kee Mao, spicy. The dish came out figuratively glowing with glorious heat. So much, in fact that one of my companions couldn't stomach it, while the other consumed it sparingly. Happily, this left me with almost an entire plateful of Pad Kee Mao, which I eagerly devoured. The other dishes were extraordinary as well, including the red curry, the Masaman curry, the golden triangles, the pad thai, and the tom kar gai soup, all of which should be washed down with a Singha, which they serve perfectly frosty.\n\nSo what keeps it back from a 5-star rating? The place itself. It's cramped, narrow, and woefully understaffed. The servers try valiantly to accommodate the large crowds that inevitably show up, but with such an unworkable space, there are always long lines and you're constantly rubbing shoulders with and overhearing the conversation of your neighbors. I'll have to try the original Irving Street location and see if it's any better, atmosphere-wise.", "author": "Chris T."}

The combination of tasty food with terrific service and a delightful atmosphere explains why this place has received so many 4-star reviews--deserved, in my opinion.  Because of the odd time of my meal--about 3:30 PM--there were not that many tables taken, so I had an opportunity to observe another diner who mentioned to the waitress that although he could not find fault with the preparation of one of his dishes, it just didn't appeal to him.  The diner said that he would be happy to pay for the dish, however.  After taking the dish away and conferring with a supervisor, the waitress returned and offered the diner the option to order something else without being charged for the dish he didn't like.

I have forced many out of town visitors to try it and they are always impressed.\n\nAny Curries - we usually get yellow curry with pumpkin and soy protein, which has a really nice texture and is a great alternative to fried tofu (sometimes that's  all you can get as a vegetarian and thai restaurants).

Long narrow place, with kitchen in front on left half of the galley and small tables down the right. Tables were right next to each other, so I'm sure you'd get chummy with your neighbors. Went on  Sunday afternoon and it was full. (The primary photo for this listing does not look like the interior of this restaurant -- perhaps it is the other location? This place was much more cluttered/casual.)\nFOOD: Ordered two things: Summer Rolls and Mango/Chicken Fried Rice. I'm a fresh spring/summer roll snob. I order them everywhere and have high standards. First impression: for $7, I should have gotten more. There were two pretty small rolls... smaller than Safeway's, which would have cost $4.50. They were also rather loosely rolled, so that they fell apart as I tried to eat them and dip them into the sauce. Not impressed. The fried rice was delicious -- however it was outright oily. I've never had oily fried rice before. The flavors were great... a mix of savory and sweet (with the mango), with a nice amount of zingy spice... and the portion was huge. I feel like it was very indulgent though for me to be eating something so oily, so I'm not sure I'd order it again.\nSERVICE: Both of the folks I dealt with couldn't have been nicer.\nBOTTOM LINE: These two items, plus a couple bucks tip -- had it be a $20 dinner.

And you have to try the Homemade Hotcakes (on the special appetizer menu) they are sweet and savory and to die for.  The Basa fillet with garlic and pepper sauce is also one of my favorites, bursting with flavor!  I live in the neighborhood and I confidently stand by my claim that it's THE best thai food in San Francisco (and there's a LOT of thai places here!)", "author": "Dominic M."}

My husband got a chicken in peanut sauce served over wilted spinach, and his, too was just not great - the spinach was so stemmy it was hard for him to chew.

We were happy to seek it out and had higher expectations.\n\nThe Chicken Tom Ka (?) and pumkin thai samosas were a great start. Wow.. great start. Downside was the samosas were brought out first and were somehow only just warm. We were halfway through them and suddenly the soup showed up. Okay, we're cool.. wait, the soup only just warm, too. \n\nWe're getting concerned at this point.\n\nMostly through our soup when they attempted to take it away since the food had arrived. Whoa -- I'm not quite ready! But we quickly finished what we had to get through and the food was placed. Green curry with eggplant, basil, chicken.. and we asked for \"spicy\". The food was warmer but had only just enough heat to be considered \"medium\" in my book. Beyond that, the flavors and textures were just right.\n\nIn fact, all flavors and textures were good-to-great. HOwever, the overall just warm temperatures of the food, combined with the sense we were being rushed (ironically, they took my card to pay the bill and were forgotten 'cause the hostess(?) got called off to a large party that was there shortly after us .. we waited 10 minutes to check out)  didn't sit well. I might try it again cause I feel there was much potential (and hopefully warmer food) in our future with them. However, it may be awhile. Maybe our problems were due to the large party (I think I overheard them mention it was 36 people). Didn't even want to stick around for dessert.\n\nBummer!", "author": "Mark P."}

NEVER WILL I EVER GIVE U BUSINESS MARNEE THAI! \n\nI've promised myself to never go to Marnee Thai again! their service is horrible. They used to have better quality food and better service but they've really gone downhill. It's really crammed in there all the time. I can hear every couple's conversation next to me when i'm sitting at the table because the tables are so tight next to each other. They're very pushy about what you should order from their menu. And lets be real, this isn't a fine dine place like Fleur de lys for it to have tiny artistic portions, it's just another homie restaurant on Irving and yet they're frugal about their portions. \n\nI, as always, ordered the peanut chicken dish (i forgot the actual name) and my friend ordered deep fried crab over a bed of salad. In all fairness, their food usually tastes good. BUT THAT NIGHT I WAS GOING TO THROW ALL OF OUR DISHES BACK AT THE OWNER'S FACE! first off, they are not graceful at timing to bring both dishes at the same time- 15 minutes after my friend got his dish, mine came along. \n\nMy friend's dish comes along and he takes a bite out of his crab and realizes the the breaded and deep fried crab is soggy, rubbery,cold, and old. Now please people, we all know what fresh deep fried anything tastes like; it's crispy and hot. Knowing that any decent restaurant in sf would gladly take back it's food if something was wrong with it, my friend and i agreed to tell the hostess/ waitress/owner. So we expressed our thoughts to the lady expecting that she would simply apologize and order another dish for us but instead she starts arguing and telling us how freshly deep fried the crab is. Soon after, she goes into the kitchen and starts screaming at the chef in Thai and comes back and offers us to reheat the crab in the MICROWAVE for us! even a diner wouldn't say that to you in SF!Come on people, you CAN tell the difference between a freshly fried french fry and an old stale french fry, how hard is it to tell the difference between a newly fresh fried crab and an old fried crab that was made at lunch?! she was extremely rude, we're giving you business and supporting your restaurant and instead you come screaming at my face and get angry?! \n\nso as i tried just forgetting about it and tried to enjoy the rest of my time left with my friend, she has the nerve to come by to ask me how our meals are and tries to flatter me by saying how big and beautiful my eyes are! lady, i don't care, you ruined my night and put my friend and i in a bad mood on a Friday night!!!!!!!!!! \n\n\n\n\nAll i wanted was a decent dinner to enjoy my night with my friend. \nI live in a city that offers amazing food where ever you go, i know what good service and fresh good food is! \n\n\nNEVER AGAIN, NEVER AGAIN!", "author": "Setareh s."}

I was shocked to see how large their menu was and how many vegetarian options were available, Marnee Thai isn't messing around. It took me at least 10 mins to decide. I was really pleased to see they had vegetarian soups; I've always wanted to try thai soups but they've all had fish or chicken. You can replace meat with veg soy protein in practically any of their dishes. The soy was incredibly dense and chewy, much like seitan, and way delicious. We ordered the summer rolls, which were well packed and fresh but the dipping sauce wasn't very spicy or memorable. I ordered the Pramam Phak with veggies and fried tofu in a peanut curry sauce. The sauce was very flavorful and spicy, a nice twist on the typical thick peanut sauce often associated with Praram. The veggies were fresh and the tofu was beautifully crispy. My partner had the Pad Cashew Nut with the veg soy protein. It was spicy and savory with onions and peppers. Rice does not come with the meals, kind of a bummer, but only $3 for two people.

Since then we have been dying to come back and since we live kinda far from the restaurant, we were so excited to be there and grub. \nThe food here is soooo tasty. They season everything really well and its not overpowered with just spiciness. All the dishes I have tried has its own distinct flavor and is soo satisfying. Our favorites were the coconut hotcakes, the garlic pepper seabass, the avocado and mango salad, a yummy scallop and prawn dish and the panang beef. Yumminess.\nIts funny to see that a review before me experienced a rude customer because I would have to say that the only bad thing about my visit here tonight was a picky customer who had nothing to do but complain about the food and the service. Seriously people need to change. How are you going to complain about the food and eat it all up and then wait till the end to continue to complain to the manager to say that the waitress was at fault for basically just taking your order?! Its clear that the service here works as a team and everyone tried to accomodate this lady. She ate all her food and still wanted some sort of discount at the end. Puhleeese. And although it was none of my business, it became part of my dining experience and it made me upset because my boyfriend and I thought that the same waitress was extremely nice. She helped us when we asked for a recommedation and even told us that we may be ordering too much food (we knew it but were excited to have leftovers). She was great and the rest of the crew kept busy constantly filling our waters and tea..clearing the table and packed up our food. What more can you ask for? And all for such a reasonable price.\nI will always look forward to coming here. Marnee Thai is the bomb.", "author": "Fatima R."}

This restaurant is small and quaint.  As you enter the narrow hallway, you will see numerous articles about this quint place and pictures to stare at as you wait to be seated.  You'll also get to watch the cooks at the opposite end as you peak into the kitchen and rub your tummy!  LOL!  It's really fun to eat Thai food family style; I have no idea what foods came my way; I just wanted to eat Pad Thai. I just put different delicacies on my plate and ate like a mad woman.   I also tried some dumpling that my friend said would be considered \"street food\" in Thailand.  I ate one and was trying to wrestle with my friend for the last one!  Before my trip though, I need to figure out why my nose kept itching.  I tried something that sparked my senses and taste buds.   Oh well!  Thailand here I come!", "author": "Vivian B."}

Chao talay is described as mixed seafood sauteed in garlic, hot peppers and sweet basil.  All I could taste was salt and faint basil.  This was a simplistic and one dimensional dish somehow destroying all the flavors I have to imagine were originally contained in the calamari, shrimp, scallops, salmon, and mussels. And the vegetable deluxe would have been all right - not great - if they had not added numerous hefty chunks of translucent white or pink \"fresh\" tomatoes.  Here's a tip: skip fresh tomatoes when not in season.  What a total waste of money and food.  I'll hope for better results next time I visit Marnee Thai.\n\nPostscript: these people are Nazis. They called me at 10pm the night I posted this review to ask what my problem was.

I did a little homework on Yelp before paying Marnee Thai a visit, so that I would be prepared with the order.  I decided to use my generous gift on inviting my husband for a Friday night date.  When we got there, we were warmly greeted by the staff.  Although we had to wait a little before being seated, a couple of staff members came by twice to make sure we had the menu to browse.  One informed us about the specials of the day, and asked us if we wanted to put in our orders while waiting so that we wouldn't have to wait once seated.  Another one came to reassure us about how much longer we needed to wait until our table was ready.  All this service, just from waiting for only 10 minutes.  Or maybe it was longer... but all the attention we got, the wait didn't feel that long at all.  \nWhen it came to ordering, trusting the Yelpers' reviews, I ordered the \"Angel Wings\" for appetizers, the \"Pad Thai\" noodles, the \"Padang Beef\" and the vegetable deluxe side dish.  The explosion of flavors and spices that emanate from all these dishes were phenomenal.  \nThe Angel Wings were wonderfully crisp with a syrupy coating.  The Pad Thai noodles might have been the best I've tasted so far as I really enjoyed the texture of the noodles: cooked \"Thai al dente\" where each noodle strand retained its chewiness all enhanced with a welcomed-complexity of the sauce a combination of sweet, salty , nuttiness with a bit of tang.\nAlthough the Padang Beef tasted good, it wasn't outstanding and would easily feature in one of my \"forgettable dish\" with time.  The vegetable deluxe was good as well, nothing exciting though, just there to make me feel that I got my daily serving of veggies.  \n\nOverall, we had a great experience.  The service was outstanding, the food rich in flavors, the atmosphere bustling and alive.  My husband and I felt like we were dating each other all over again!", "author": "Nadine M."}

There are a million other places that look yummy in the Sunset, but every time I venture over here the call of Marnee Thai is just too great, and I always end up there. The food is delicious, the price is right, and the portions are perfect, leaving you full but not uncomfortable. I've eaten here a number of times, and it has always been great. I have yet to have something I didn't enjoy. I recommend the basil chicken (very spicy), the yellow and red curry, the panang beef curry, and the chicken satay. The service is great--they are very attentive and get you what you need, when you need it... including more rice (for free!). The only potential negative is the fast pace, which I don't mind, but it could be a problem for others. It can feel very rushed in there, and some may feel pressured to eat quickly and leave.

What set Marnee Thai apart from the rest was not only the quality of the food, but also the quality of service. My rowdy group of 8 showed up an hour after our reservation time and we were still seated within 5 minutes in a cute secluded room in the back. The place had a decent amount of people but our server still had time to be extremely attentive and made sure our drinks were full and that we liked our food. And even though we ordered quite a bit of food it came promptly. Our waiter was extremely patient and made many suggestions such as the avocado salad and coconut soup which were ORGASMIC! He was also very accommodating of our friend who had a peanut allergy. He overheard one of my friends mention my birthday and he and another waiter came out with a gong and free yummy coconut ice cream with a candle which I thought was adorable. We were the last in the restaurant but we didn't feel rushed or pressured to leave. Usually restaurant staff get a little grumpy at the end of the night and want to get home ASAP, but the closing staff all said goodbye and wished us a good night. Although some have complained about the prices, I thought it was reasonable and well worth every penny. Overall Marnee Thai blends exquisite authentic Thai food with exceptional service.", "author": "N. M."}

The place is small and when we arrived barely anyone else was dining, but by the time we left the place was full. Be prepared to sit very close to the people next to you. Golden triangles were quite good, but how can you screw up fried food? Pad Thai was everything you would expect and nothing more. There were only 4 or 5 shrimp and the chicken was cut so small I barely even noticed it. Vegetarian curry was good but not spicy enough for me. Brown rice was cooked very well. Thai iced tea was good but not amazing. Standard thai restaurant but nothing to write home about.", "author": "Michael K."}

Thai food is a marriage between the great four sensations, sweet, salt, hot and sour.  The taste of the individual components has nothing to do with the final flavor.  For example, nam pla- fish sauce is one of the most disgusting flavors on the planet.  Yet, Thai food is impossible without it.  Marnee Thai misses the mark.  The staple of Thai food, Pad Thai totally missed the mark.  It was soggy.  I could not tell where the noodle started and the bean sprouts ended.  it was mush.  The corn fritters were good.  No dipping sauce at all.   The beef satay, another staple was not cooked on a hot enough fire, tasted like it had been boiled.  The peanut dipping sauce was bland, no flavor other than the peanut.  Did they use Skippy peanut butter?  There was no masuman curry available, we made do with a bland yellow curry.  We had the \"chicken laap\".   They forgot to add the chicken and it was soggy.  If you canned Thai food, this place would be a hit.  Four stars for Marnee Thai is very generous.  It's one good virtue is that it is close to Golden Gate Park.  Try the Mexican place across the street.", "author": "craig u."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-27", "description": "After going to Thailand for 2 months, none of the Thai restaurants in the Bay Area satisfied me anymore. I found most Thai restaurants to be too Americanized; a lack of spiciness and excessive amounts of sauce or sodium added to the food. Of all the Thai restaurants that claim to be authentic, Marnee Thai is the only one that seems to be true to its word. The dishes were just as good as the food I ate in Thailand, and the employees were actually Thai! Those who dislike the food at Marnee Thai must come to the realization that they probably do not like Authentic Thai food. It's a shame that some people dislike this restaurant because that's what the food in Thailand actually tastes like! Maybe those people who dislike Marnee Thai like the greasy, sodium-heavy, Americanized Thai cuisine, which is fine as every person has their own preferences.", "author": "And R."}

When I have a yellow curry with chicken and a green papaya salad craving, Marnee Thai is where I head. Although sometimes the craving is for green curry with duck and a mango salad. Or maybe pineapple fried rice and cucumber salad. And a Singha to drink and help with the spice and some coconut ice cream to finish the meal.", "author": "Adrienne D."}

It's just \"alright\", I would give an extra half star if I could because they offer duck meat.  The red curry was not rich enough, the tom yum soup was not rich enough, the pad thai was too \"tomatoey\", the special mango fried rice was bland, and the thai fried rice was terrible-- bland and wet is all I could say.  Angel wings were okay.  It just seems like everything was not as \"spiced\" as they should be.  No offense since I'm definitely not an expert either, but I think the non-asians out there overating this place. It's like why Americans like Panda Express, the \"fake\" Chinese food.", "author": "Joyce C."}

Turns out, I didnt really need the reservation.\nAs usual, one of us was late,  so we sat around waiting...and waiting... all the while, we had ordered Thai Iced Tea+Coffee+ Thai Iced Coffee. \nGreat stuff!  I had the Thai Iced Coffee, it wasnt as ...\"Thai\" as I hoped it to be but it was still yummy.=) \nSo, when we finally ordered, I decided on the Pumpkin Curry but with Beef instead of the veg soy protein. (Me Heart Meat) \nIt was SOO GOOOOOOOOOD. the Beef was SO TENDER! but....i managed to find only 3 pieces of pumpkin.....\nMy friends' other dishes were good, or so they said, with the exception of the Pad Se-EW? My friend said it was the most oily thing ever, and we are all chinese!  Greasy food to chinese people.....hm. you be the judge\nThey charged us $2.00 each for Brown Rice....Hm. I still think it should come with the dish, not as an extra but thats acceptable...\n\nthe service there was fantastic...until we had to wait 15 minutes for dessert and remind them 3 times....thats the only reason im taking off a star....I think thats kinda rare at this place since the waiters are very attentative, maybe they just had too much to do...but still....15 mins....=/\n\noh! before i forget, the bathroom review: 4/5. \nThey play music in the bathroom! COoL! but the door is kinda weird, it shorta shakes on its own lol \n\nOverall, the food here is DELICIOUS the service is GOOD\nand worth it. \n\nI ll be sure to come back but i do hope that i dont have to wait 15 mins for my black sticky rice with coconut ice cream which....I seriously thought was vanilla for a while....\n\nanyhow. yea, it was good.", "author": "cindy L."}

I have said for years that this is the best Thai food east and west of Thailand.  Chaiwat, the owner, recently told me that it has been rated in the top 50 Thai restaurants in the U.S.  (What a surprise!)  Every dish is excellent.  I love Thai food and could easily eat it a few times per week.  I have my favorites  of course and am happy that Chaiwat has new specials all the time.  Both Marnee locations have excellent service.  Take a date or a group, where you can order many dishes.  If arriving by car, don't stress looking for parking in the neighborhood; go less than two blocks into Golden Gate Park and it's a done deal.
