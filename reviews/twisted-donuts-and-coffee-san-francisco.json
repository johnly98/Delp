I tried the donut holes and guava coconut and the donut is dry. I couldn't even taste the guava. I tried the cruller with orange on top. Again the cruller was dry and hard.

So dangerous, but also so convenient for all the adult brunch gatherings that I am looking forward to in my near future. They have interesting donut flavors, but I agree with my friends that the real (and only) winner is the maple bacon donut. I'm also a fan of their savory croissants, of which I have tried the jalapeno, cheddar, and ham. I think it would be even better if they offered to heat up the croissants prior to serving! \n\nTheir coffee isn't anything spectacular. Don't expect locally roasted beans or made to order drip coffee, but if all you need is a cup of joe to wake yourself up with, this will do. I like that they serve their iced coffee with coffee ice cubes. This is a huge plus for people like me who take forever to drink their coffee and always end up with a melted, messy puddle of watered-down coffee at the end of the morning.", "author": "Sherry L."}

A few weeks ago, I was craving donuts yet again. Decided to order breakfast / snack delivery on Sunday, December 31st at 11:46am. Our order arrived via DoorDash at 12:58pm. We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Croissants: Plain ($2.25)\n*Twist ($1.75)\n*Jelly Filled: Blueberry, Choco Bavarian, Lemon ($1.50 each)\n*Apple Fritter ($2)\n*French Cruller\u00a0($1.75)\n*Old Fashioned\u00a0($1.40)\n\nI liked the jelly filled donuts the best. They were fluffy and not too sweet. Although I was disappointed as I really wanted the Choco Bavarian one and they gave me what I think was a Chocolate Buttermilk Bar instead. I'm not into cakey donuts, so this was a bummer. Plus, custard filled are my fav, so it did suck that I didn't get the one donut I really wanted. The other donuts were pretty good. The apple fritter was doughy with a slight crispiness on the outside. The twist, light and fluffy. The croissant was a little dense. Almost like eating bread. Felt like it needed more butter and layers maybe? They didn't have a french cruller, so DoorDash ended up crediting me $2.09 on my card. Not a big deal, as I could have done with or without it.\n\nPretty good donuts, but they should have told me they didn't have the Choco Bavarian instead of replacing it.

We didn't consume the donuts till a much later time and I was pleasantly surprised that both donuts were still soft and delicious as it would've been if we had gotten it fresh. Usually old fashioned donuts are a bit thick and chewy, but their version was light and airy. Not dense at all. And the maple bacon one was perfect sweet/salty combo.

Also, when you order iced coffee, they actually use coffee ice cubes so when they melt, they don't dilute your drink. \n\nThe customer service at Twisted is unparalleled.  The employees always have a smile on their faces and ensure that your visit is going well/you have everything that you need.  Every time I come in I am always pleased with my experience.  Today, they went above and beyond:  I had a mini cellphone emergency when I got to my car and couldn't locate the little bugger.

I probably got a little too excited, but I ordered a full dozen of donuts to share and to have for breakfast the next day. \n\nHere's what I ordered:\n\n-5x Maple Baconpe\u00f1o: DELICIOUS. The best donuts of the entire bunch! The donut is soft and not too bready and I appreciate the bacon and jalape\u00f1o pieces throughout since you get pieces in every bite. I just wish there could be more jalape\u00f1o pieces. No regrets ordering 5 of these bad boys. \n\n-Cookies & Cream Bar: This was essentially a dessert donut. The chocolate donut bar was the bun with whipped cream and Oreos in middle. Good, but probably wouldn't get again because it was too sweet for me. \n\n-Granola Donut: Donut with vanilla icing, granola bits, and chocolate chips. Good, but not my favorite.\n\n-Bear Claw: MASSIVE but kind of cute because of the shape. It's filled with apple pie filling so it's like a glazed donut pie. Would get again.\n\n-Cinnamon Bun: Not really a cinnamon bun, but a huge sticky bun with some cinnamon. Good and simple. \n\n-Gummy Bear Donut: SO CUTE! Vanilla icing with a ring of gummy bears. Texturally strange, but the taste is not bad. \n\n-Jelly Donut: I did not try this but I am told it was good. \n\n-50 cent cream puffs: Bite sized whipped cream bites. Not bad. I would get these again if I were in the mood. \n\n\nOverall, great donut shop. I would definitely go back for the maple baconpe\u00f1o alone!", "author": "Sofia R."}

I soon realized after scrolling through the yelp pics, that the special ones were made during special events...like for the Warriors final games or for certain situations. Fair enough.\n\nThe space itself isn't anything aesthetically pleasing, but for a donut shop...it's cozy, got lots of seating, and monochromatic. It kind of feels like a high school cafeteria in terms of the color palette, but it's spacious and old-school.\n\nThe only thing I'd shoutout more would be the sweet service.

I must say the Bavarian cream itself it's great, however I'm not too impressed with the donut a little to dense for me, same complaint with the penut butter and jelly donut.  As for the croissants they are great, my only complaint is they warm it up in a microwave and not an oven :(, I don't mind paying over $4 for a croissant but I'd like the consistency to stay the same.   \nO and by the way the selection of coffee is great.\n\nI'm definitely coming back since I walk my dog this way every morning, however the price to quality is a bit off, hopefully they'll work out the kinks.", "author": "Josh Giosue D."}

I mean, who doesn't love bacon? \n\nAnother popular flavor here is the blueberry donut. I enjoyed how this one had a more dense but still fluffy cake-like texture. There's real blueberries mixed into the batter and the minimal outer sugar syrup coating added just a little sweetness.\n\nThe owner, Jenny, is really sweet.

Finally, this past Sunday, my SO and I headed out to Outer Sunset to check out the temptatious donuts that I've been drooling over.\n\nThe minute we walked in, the cashier was so friendly and helpful. He gave honest recommendations.  From blueberry, creme puffs, nutella furritos, and oreo filled donuts, there was quite a selection to choose from. Note that they only have the special menu on the weekends, and standard donuts during the week.\n\nWe ordered the PB & J donut (my SO loved this) and the maple bacon donut sans jalape\u00f1os, as I'm indeed a sucker for bacon. I've had the dynamo donut version, and was torn at which one I thought was better. They do have larger pieces of bacon and the donut was bigger overall with more air in the donut and not as dense. \n\nI almost went for the nutella furrito, but this isn't a donut. It has a crispy wrap. Though I may try that one in the future because how can you say \"no\" each time to nutella?\n\nWe ate these two donuts in the shop along with a cup of coffee. Donuts were fresh. Standard coffee with a number of flavors to choose from but no speciality espresso drinks. \n\nWe also ordered a few blueberry donut holes and a creme puff. Note we could not eat this all in one sitting and still have a few more to go (it's the next day). \n\nGreat place to try creative, tasty donuts on the weekends.

We got a dozen donut holes, a bacon maple donut and a raspberry jelly filled donut for $6.  Good deal.  The salty bacon and maple glaze were divine.  Donuts weren't too heavy which we liked.  The donut holes were well made and not overly sweet or overly glazed but had the right amount of glaze and were moist.  We liked his jelly filled donut too.

Next time I'm visiting SF, I'll make sure to go in again. \n\nnotes: \n*metered street parking on Noreiga can be annoying. \n* blueberry bites are served only on weekends\n* they have specials not served daily, check them out on facebook\n* if their maple bacon sells out, ask them when the next batch is coming out of the oven. it might be a short wait & totally worth it. \n* yes, coffee will go great w/ these fried sweet treats. \n* accepts credit card for purchases over $7.00\n* at random times, there's a line out the door onto the street. have patience.", "author": "James L."}

Not only do they have really fluffy, flavorful, tasty donuts, but they're a true mom-and-pop store with solid donuts. And for the prices ($0.95 cake donuts and ~$3 specialty donuts), it's hard to beat!\n\nI ran in this morning to pick up some donuts and left with a maple bacon donut, an orange-glazed cake donut, and a chocolate-glazed peanut-topped cake donut. I also enjoyed them in that order, primarily because I prefer classic fluffy donuts to denser cake donuts. But the orange glaze was so good that if there was a classic donut with the orange glaze, I'm certain that would be my favorite. That said. The maple bacon was really good, with a real maple flavor and actual bacon pieces. As for the service, the woman behind the counter was super sweet and gave me a cup of water because I was clearly perspiring...\n\nBased on the other photos on yelp, I presume they have some fun funky flavors as well (Cap'n Crunch and S'mores, for example) but unfortunately there were none of those when I visited. I hope to be back soon!", "author": "Julia N."}

Donuts are making a huge comeback and heaven help me!!! I'm a huge donut fan since the days of Winchell's and I'm very excited about the new donut trend springing up in the Bay Area. \n\nTwisted is not your traditional donut store. It follows what was started by Voodoo Doughnuts in Oregon then followed by Top Pot in Seattle, Psycho Donuts in the South Bay and Dynamo Donuts in the City. Outrageous toppings and crazy flavor combos are what these donut stores offer and Twisted is no different. \n\nI ordered quite a few variety during my first visit. Obviously, you cannot avoid ordering the maple bacon donut or the Oreo cream. Both were gianormous and good. But what I really enjoyed was the orange glazed donut, which was delicious.\n\nThe owner was amazing. She was a one-woman show. As I was in the process of paying, one of the ovens started beeping, alerting her a new batch of goodies were ready. Embarrassingly, I was unable to resist getting something freshly baked. Anyway, she excused herself so she can remove the items from the oven. But she returned a minute later, apologized for the wait and shoved a free donut on top of my already large order...for one. \n\nThe donuts averaged $2 each. Quite pricey, but they're huge. For example, the Oreo-cream donut can easily fulfill the sugar rush for two.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience at Twisted. I would say Voodoo and Top Pot are still better. Many of the varieties at Twisted are copies of what these other donut stores already offer. Twisted would benefit by developing some more original flavors.", "author": "Albert L."}

MINE, MINE, MINE, I'm internalizing.  \n\nThere were some unusually prepared donuts like a tortilla based one with raspberry filled.  I opted for the last maple bacon donut, a bear claw that was apple cinnamon filled, and a blueberry filled donut.  The owner tossed in a sugar donut.\n\nKeep in mind it's passed 6pm.  Upon getting home, it was decision time.  Have a donut or wait until the next morning to consume.  \n\nThe evening won out.  I ate the sugar donut.  It was perfect.

I mean there's always a flaw and nothing is really perfect, but this place really is! Not only is the taste a 5, the customer service is a 5 too! \n\nI came here yesterday thinking I could finally try this place after driving by it when it was still under construction. I saw the sign for the weekend special hoping there would be blueberry donut holes, but I was sad to see that most of the donuts were sold out and all that was left was the original glazed, one cream cheese croissant, and cinnamon rolls. This was around 5pm. My friend and I decided to try the original glazed, and what do you know? It was better than Krispy Kreme! We'll that is, if you like it a bit more chewy. KK is very soft and like cotton candy, gone in a bite. Not only was this donut soft, it had a chewy texture, I knew I had to try the blueberry donut holes, so I got up early today and went right when it was opened.\n\nI was only planning to get the blueberry donut holes, but then I ended up getting so much more! I decided to try all the weekend specials. Normally I don't like salty and sweet mixed together, but I read so many reviews about the maple bacon that I decided to try the baconpeno. The lady was very nice and offered me a sample to make sure it wasn't too spicy for me! BEWARE: May be spicy for those who can't handle spicy. I asked her what the PB and J donut was cause I wasn't too sure how they made it, but she said a customer said it was so good that she had to make more. I don't even eat PB&J sandwiches, but everything she said seemed to be good, so I thought I should try it. The last special was the cream puffs. To be honest, I wasn't expecting much, so I only got a few to try. BUT omg the moment I bit it, I was dying for more. I really should've got so much more!!! It's so soft and chewy! Not like your normal layered puffy cream puffs. Might be more cream than you think in the puffs, so let her know I you want less! Lastly, I wanted more of the original, but I wasn't sure if the donut holes tasted the same, so she quickly offered me a sample! And so I decided to get a dozen donut holes....\n\nI saw a review about how it was but 6, get 6 free on Saturdays and mentioned it to her, as apparently that was only the grand opening special :( but she quickly gave me a free donut!! \n\nThe lady who works there's is super nice and friendly! If you wanted to sample anything, I'm pretty sure she wouldn't mind :) The only thing I would change is that I wished they have me everything in a box instead because I ended carrying over 5 of those white paper bags. They're not that thick and most of them already soaked through :/ but that's not a big issue! I would definitely come here much more often and recommend it to my friends! And I'm even willing to wake up for it LOL (I hate waking up early)\n\nTip: Come early! Most are gone by 5 :/\nCredit with a $7min\nStore hours: M-F 6am Weekends 7am (I think it alway closes at 7, but I'm not too sure. If anything, give them a call before you head out to see what's left! )\n\nBeware: You could go in thinking you'll only buy/try one, but you'll walk out with a dozen!", "author": "Tina P."}

As the lady became upset we begin to feel very uncomfortable. \n Thankfully the younger guy working understood how we felt and had good customer service and made us a coffee drinking we could enjoy.  But as he was making the lattes the older lady working there told her coworker not to pour us new espresso shots and us the shots she poured over 10 minutes ago telling us they were still hot.

It was not too sweet and it had great blueberry flavor. My only hesitation is cost, just because donuts are generally not known to be expensive. I would not say that this place is a \"hipstery\" donut place like VooDoo or Dynamo Donut that would justify an added cost. Just my thoughts!", "author": "Vanessa K."}

I talked this place up to my husband (since it had good reviews) and good donut places are hard to come by where we live.  We went there on a Friday morning and it was not terribly busy.  I thought it was because we missed the \"going to work rush\" being on vacation and all but perhaps it was another reason.\n\nWe got the blueberry, apple fritter, chocolate long john, maple bacon and apple \"burrito.\"  I don't eat maple or bacon but my husband said it was \"not very good.\"  The burrito I had one bite of and could not take it. Something about the glaze turned my stomach.  My husband ended up tearing chunks of it off (not sure what that was about) but finished it.\n\nI love chocolate long johns and found this one lacking.  There is a lot of dough but not a lot of chocolate to back it up.  And what chocolate there is has little to no flavor.\n\nThe apple fritter and the blueberry donuts were delish so maybe the cake donuts are better than the dough/yeast ones?  We sat next to a very interesting lady who talked to herself, and made comments about people who came in.  Also the one and only bathroom was occupied the whole time we were in there....\n\nEmployees were nice and friendly. Answered questions and were patient while we made decisions.

Twisted's donuts are yum!\n\nSometimes I forget how much I love donuts, and then a place like Twisted opens, and I just cannot get them out of my head.  Here are what I especially love about this place:\n\n- Service: so friendly!  And if you're lucky, you'll sometimes be gifted with an extra donut (or two!)\n- Quality: you can taste the freshness of these donuts.  They're light and airy, particularly the donut holes, which are my fav\n- Variety: not just run of the mill corner coffee shop offers, but not hoity-toity hipster, either.  Twisted offers the typical classics in addition to maple bacon, s'mores galore, berry berry good, and blueberry!\u00a0\n\nApple Fritters are pretty tasty, too.  Mostly crunchy, the fritters are not heavy nor oily, but they could use a little more cake and slightly less crunch.  Can't wait to come back!", "author": "Mel T."}

I think the chocolate one tasted better because  it had more flavor and less soggy on the bottom. The glazed donut was a bit wet on the bottom and not much taste. Their texture is good which was light and airy. I am not sure the wetness was due to me stopping by towards 2pm.\n\nRecommend to try: Chocolate topped donut\n\nI may try it again one day in the morning. This time maybe a specialty donut.", "author": "Irene L."}

The lady that runs the shop couldn't be sweeter, and she's one of the reasons I keep coming back. But the donuts just aren't that good. They look appealing, but seem to be too dry and have a faint chemical taste to them. The long johns here are significantly small in size and lacking in chocolate or maple frosting quantity and taste. The apple fritters are too spongy and soft and missing tangible chunks of apple. The maple bacon donut is mediocre at best, and their prices are on the higher side. Their coffee is decent for your standard donut shop, which I usually find to have terrible coffee.

Sometimes sweets with bacon can take on a greasy or overly fatty tasting quality or be overpowered with the bacon -  not so with Twisted donuts!

The lady bagged up our order and we went home.   The circumference of the fritter was black and a good 1/2 inch round was completely unedible. I took it back and they replaced it.  The woman came to the counter and apologized.  As I took the other bag, she asked me if I still really wanted the apple fritter, because she says it the same as the burnt one (just not AS bad).  WOW!!!  She knew they were both burnt and sold us the REALLY burnt one, hoping that we won't make the trip back...  I picked another donut and she gave me back the price difference.  Really?!?!?  For the trip back and forth and paying the meter twice,  I got 50 cents back!!

Right before pulling out of my parking space she knocks on my window telling me she thinks she forgot the maple BACON donut & I try to pay her but she says no!! It's my fault!

It is very clean, the workers/owners are nice and the donuts venture past the traditional.  The only problem is the actual donuts aren't very good.  They aren't bad, they're just \"meh\"  We had a blueberry, old fashioned glazed, and a chocolate raised.  The blueberry was too sweet, the old fashioned had a bad interior texture, and the raised was off in taste.  I had a ham and cheese croissant that was good though.  \n\nI'll go back to see if the donuts are better.  For now, I'll stick to Uncle Benny's since the donuts taste good even if they aren't as fancy.", "author": "Joe M."}

If I go to a donut place I usually grab an apple fritter or a plain one, but I just had to try a maple-bacon donut because, although I don't have much of a sweet tooth, I DO have a bacon tooth. I walked in and there was one person in front of me and I thought \"fantastic\" until it quickly became apparent that the one person was one of \"those\" people. You know the type, someone who has no concept of the fact other people are waiting behind them (don't care) and take an excruciatingly long time to decide what they want while asking every conceivable question. Well, I was in no real hurry so I stuck it out. The woman behind me didn't feel the same way and after waiting quite awhile, left. As we were waiting a, (what's the appropriate title?), refuse collection engineer, ran in, and shouted \"best donuts in SF!\" while continuing on to the bathroom. Ok, sounds good.\n\nOnce I finally got to order, I went for a bacon-maple, an apple fritter, a cinnamon sugar and a coffee. (total time 60 seconds or less) Grabbed them and went off to jumped into my car, which, I discovered, was blocked by the refuse truck which had double-parked right next to my car. (even though there were plenty of empty spaces on either side). So, again, I wasn't in a hurry and after trying to back out with no luck, (another interesting tidbit, a SF cop drove by while I was trying to get out and showed no interest. City govt workers gotta stick together right?) I grabbed a donut out of my bag, turned on the radio and started munching and sipping my coffee. While doing this I looked up and a smile crossed my face. The person who had taken forever to order was parked right in front of me, and her painful look beamed  back to me from her rear view mirror. Ahh, there is justice in the universe.  Eventually the car in front of her left and we were freed from our imprisonment. The refuse guy never did reappear from the bathroom and it had been quite awhile by now. I wonder what happened to him.\n\nBTW, the maple-bacon was good, but I'd prefer less maple and more bacon. The fritter was very good, but not special from others I've tried, and the cinnamon was good and fresh as well. 4 stars for the fresh donuts. I don't know how you speed up people without offending them (not my problem) but you lost a customer.", "author": "Rich M."}

I didn't try any of the specialty ones yet - I tend to go for something simple when discovering a new place, so I got an orange frosted cake donut with sprinkles...I feel like places don't have these often enough.

The people working are super nice and they had a variety of donut samples laid out to try (apparently for people like me that can't make up their mind on what they want). I must have tried EVERY sample on that plate and since they all tasted great, I ended up in the same predicament of not knowing what I wanted.  I guess it's smart of them to offer those samples because in the end I bought a huge box of donuts to enjoy with the family at home.  I also sat inside with my box and enjoyed a coffee (which tasted fresh and strong) and ate an apple fritter (highly recommended). It's a pretty relaxing cozy atmosphere (they have a TV inside and you can people watch through the window on Noriega).
