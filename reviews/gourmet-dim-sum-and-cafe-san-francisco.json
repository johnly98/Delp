We were able to get 2 piping hot bowls of wonton noodle soup and an order of steamed rice noodles for $9 - wow! \n\nThe rice noodles were thick but still had a nice supple texture albeit being on the oily side. It was speckled nicely with dried shrimp and green onions though so there was good flavor on every bite! Wish it came with some sweet soy sauce or chili oil though - can't be picky at a cafeteria style dim sum joint though.\n\nAs for the wonton noodle soup, the noodles were cooked just right in a delicious chicken broth. They also included probably 8 wontons or more which I considered a great value despite the fact that they don't use shrimp in their version. \n\nAll in all, good meal.

I suppose I could have researched this ahead of time, but I went with the random-looking-in method and deciding on vibe.  So I ended up at the deceptively (but oh-so Chinese) named Gourmet Dim Sum and Cafe.\n\nAs desired, its a tiny place with just two rows of 2-seat tables and a counter selling the goods, above which hung the plain, large menu in Chinese and English.  Being illiterate in Chinese, I went with just asking for shrimp rice rolls and siu mai, which were promptly microwaved for me.  The unusual part of this experience were the rice rolls, which had a bizarrely spongy consistency.   The shrimps were tiny and a bit fishy tasting.  The siu mai were nothing special, nothing unusual, solidly mediocre.  Glad I only tried this much and beat a hasty retreat, this cafe's appeal lost on me.", "author": "Valery C."}

The owner/chef trained in upscale gourmet places so he decided to name his own place as such. Although the \"scrungy\" interior doesn't reflect that name.\n\nThis is one of many underrated dim sum places on Clement street. Perhaps because they're located just one block from the ever popular Good Luck Dim Sum (GLDS). The only break they get is on Tuesdays when GLDS is closed. They get extra points because service is a lot nicer here than at GLDS, by far.\n\nIt's not the best dim sum I've ever had, but I like the overall value you get. Most items are priced at 3 for $1.50 (menu items #1-23), except for the following popular items:\n- egg custard (#25) for 60 cents\n- baked BBQ pork bun (#26) for 75 cents - very nice plump buns!\n- chow mein (#36) at $1.50 (small) / $2.50 (large), it's a vegetarian version, mostly noodles with a few strands of carrots and sprouts (I prefer to go to Wei Lee for chow mein).\n\nSo, what makes this place a standout favorite for many regular customers? obviously the low price comes first, fairly good decent quality, seating space to read your newspaper, and two popular menu items:\n- #28 - pork or chicken porridge (aka. congee or jook) for $2. It's just a very basic rice soup, but the pricing is phenomenal.\n- #33 - wonton soup for $3 ($3.50 with noodles), the quality is surprisingly decent considering the rock bottom price, and they don't skimp on the number of wontons either. It's a fantastic deal for most senior residents on a fixed income, and budget-minded customers.\n\nMy rating is 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 stars.

What makes me happy, is that I've found a cute little place that is not only successful in bringing little sparks of joy to my eyes BUT offers excellent customer service. So so lacking in another place I'm going to review after this place.\n\nGourmet Dim Sum is located directly next to a market on a busy corner of Clement so when the fellow who is alert to my catfish whiskers lengthening horizontally went to the market, I slipped into the Dim Sum shop to experience what they might have for this angry little Asian.\n\nThere was no one behind the counter, but the minute the sitting clients in the back saw me, they mentioned something in Chinese to the back kitchen and this little old lady walks out.  She preps herself in front of me with her hands and napkins and says \"yes?\"\n\nI ordered the last ten steamed pork buns and two egg custard buns.  This came out to $5 even.  Holy shit.  That inexpensive.  I proceeded to sit down and ease my impending hunger with one egg custard bun.  Mmmmmmm.  On another mission, I left with twelve steamed pork dumplings and they lasted me a couple of days.\n\nI've found my new place of dim sum when I am not willing to wait in line at Good Luck Dim Sum.

Unfortunately, the original place we wanted to try near Clement street had no indoor seating area so we went inside Gourmet Dim Sum and Cafe, plus it said \"gourmet\" which means it has to be good, right? Uh let's just say that it cost $1.50 for 3 pieces and the best thing about this place was only the price. I ordered #2 deep fried meat dumpling and #31 beef rice noodle. The dumpling was big, but it lacked a good portion of meat. The beef rice noodle was ok, but I have tasted better. I left this place feeling full, but my craving for SF dim sum was not yet fulfilled. The service and the eating area were both a-ok, but overall I gave this place 2 stars for the food and lack of cleanliness.

The price is comparable to other Chinese takeout places in this part of town.\n\nDumplings are 3 for $1.50 and the menu is in English (and Chinese).  I wanted the fresh shrimp rice noodle but they didn't have any (yet) so I ordered the following:\n* Har gow: Tender, diced shrimp, minced bamboo shoots, fairly large, tasty\n* Pork & preserved egg porridge ($2): Thick and pasty (pasty isn't a good thing in my book), nicer flavor than most takeout dim sum places (Good Luck still has the best porridge), not much preserved egg or meat, no scallions, no ginger.  \n* Shark's fin dumpling: Mostly fatty ground pork, firm, with some carrots, pretty good\n\nEverything was served nice and hot.  You can take it to go or grab a table there to eat it.  It's a no frills place and there's rarely a line.  Cash only of course.", "author": "Lolia S."}

I was heading back to the parking lot with my boyfriend when Gourmet Dim Sum and Cafe caught my eyes. \"Let's go there,\" I said. \n\n\"Have you been there before?\" My boyfriend asked.\n\n\"Nope, but let's try it out since I don't know where else I can find good Har Gow.\"\n\nThere was a line with 4 people when I walked in. The place was similar to Good Luck but smaller. We waited in line and ordered \"2 Har Gow, 1 Siu Mai, 1 Steamed BBQ Pork Bun, 1 Steamed Chicken Bun, 1 Small Chow Mein, and 1 Chive Dumpling.\" Not knowing that this place would sell you one \"piece\" of dim sum and not just by orders, I only ended up with a little tray of dim sum, a little tray of noodle, and 2 steamed buns. The people behind me must have thought I was weird... :(\n\nThe dumplings were really plump. I took a bite of the Har Gow. It was sweet and juicy with just the right amount of bamboo shoot. I'd say it was comparable to Good Luck's BUT it's probably a tad bigger and a lot more oily. The chive dumpling was equally as delicious! I quickly went back in line to order more and this time I made sure I didn't order just one or two pieces. =P\n\nAll their dumplings were really oily...probably to prevent them from sticking together. They were very good dumplings so I didn't mind soaking up the extra oil with my napkin. My boyfriend finished his BBQ Pork Bun before I even had a chance to see it...so I don't know how it compares to Good Luck's. We finished almost everything except 2 pieces of siu mai and 2 pieces of har gow, which I took home with me. We were stuffed and everything was just barely over $10! What a deal?!\n\nGourmet have a larger selection of dim sum than Good Luck. They have a variety of rice rolls (e.g. fresh shrimp, dried baby shrimp, beef) and several more items that Good Luck doesn't carry. They have Wonton Noodle Soup for $3! The translation on their menu says \"Wonton Soup\" but it's actually has noodle too. A lot of people ordered that and that thing is NOT puny. It's what you would typically pay $6 or more at typical restaurants. Their wontons were a good size. \n\nThere's only 2 bottle of soy sauce and 1 bottle of hot sauce, so you have to share with other people and you might have to hop over to another table to borrow their sauce. The customers there were really nice and everybody seemed very comfortable with sharing. :)\n\nBest of all, the lady called me \"lang lui\" =D That's pretty common actually. I promise that's not the reason I'm giving them 4 stars. I'd be very happy if either Gourmet or Good Luck would move to Portland.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

The best dumplings were the Chive dumplings since they were very tasty, tender, and a decent size.  The sesame ball was huge but had nothing but air in it,  the usual ball of sweet black bean paste was replaced by a smidgen and seemed like just an after thought. Extremely disappointing. \n\nThey were out of almost everything else on a Friday at 2:00PM.  No sticky rice, no beef fun, and the chow mein looked dry and unappetizing.  The service was really lacking.  The lady wasn't outright rude but seemed like she didn't want to serve me and basically ignored me.  I had to ask for things several times before she answered me and then she would hesitate as if she was considering whether or not to answer me.

Funny thing is, it never occurred to me to do so before today either.... *hmmph*\n\nGourmet Dimsum is a pretty small shop near the corner of 8th Avenue and Clement Street; I discovered it a few years ago when Good Luck Dimsum was closed.  It was a miserable, gray morning on which the sky seemed to be spitting maliciously at me just to further bum me out.  I trolled around Clement Street to find a suitable substitute for Good Luck and, to my surprise, what started out as a major disappointment exposed me to even greater culinary treasures.\n\nIf you're a fan of steamed shrimp & ginger dumplings, shrimp & chive dumplings, shrimp & cilantro dumplings and scallop dumplings, you'll never be disappointed if you get them from Gourmet Dimsum.  \n\nWhy not?  Because my friends, they serve it up big, plump and hot.  Don't we all like it like that? *wink*\n\nEach tasty dumpling has an impressive bulge, and I would estimate they are sized about one and a half to two times the size of most that I've seen elsewhere.  Don't fret, though.  This increase in dumpling size doesn't mean they cheap out on you and fatten the dumpling by wrapping the innards with thick skin.  The skin here is thin, chewy and translucent like it's supposed to be.  \n\nWhat else impressed me about Gourmet Dimsum is that they wrap their rice skin around dumpling guts that are clean-tasting (you know what I'm talking about ... no mystery meat in it or strange aftertaste), freshly steamed (always hot), and packed with the freshest (bright green cilantro and chives) and highest quality (firm, clean and translucent shrimp) ingredients.\n\nNext time you're invited to a potluck brunch, stop by Gourmet Dimsum and get a big carton of dumplings.  It's the only package of \"big, plump and hot\" that you can share with your friends that is guaranteed to elicit cries of \"wow!\" and \"delicious!!!\" from the whole crowd... ;P", "author": "Jenny K."}

I do not order many things here but they have a variety of Steamed Buns filled with meat with my favorite being the Steamed Pork Bun which are a great value at 3 for $1.50, they have a tasty filling and have always been fresh. The only other option I have explored here is the Large Chow Mein for just $2.50, this is boxed in a large lunch size container crammed full of Noodles. Lots of other stuff on the menu with most being 3 for $1.50, and easy seating if you want to mix with the locals.", "author": "Joseph A."}

We tried to go to Good Luck Dim Sum but the line was too long and there were no tables. So we decided to just duck into the next Dim Sum place we saw.\nMeh. \nThe place is a dive but that is ok.\nWe ordered a tray full of food for the both of us for just $8.  Cheap!  But I get nervous when food is too cheap, so for me that is really not much of plus. \nThe little shrimp thingys and the little scallop thingys were tasty, the little pork things were good but everything else was not so.  It would have been better and a three star review had everything not been cold.  We were already cold, and room temperature \"steamed\" dumplings did not hit the spot.\nI wont be coming back here, there are too many choices on Clement.", "author": "Nilu r."}

So hopped down to Gourmet to check it out.  Gourmet is not the word I would use to describe GDS.  \n\nOrder up front, food has been prepared in advance and is quite cheap.  The beef rice noodes (I got the last one!) were pretty good but the rice in lotus leaf was subpar.  Both items were only $3 total, which was a deal.\n\nLanguage barrier was difficult too - when I first asked for beef with rice noodle, she went for the chow mein and I had to order by the number on the menu to get my intentions across.\n\nI'm a sucker for the beef rice noodles and this did the trick, otherwise save your ducats and squander them on buns at Good Luck.  \n\nPackaged to go.  Not an environment that encourages lingering over a meal.  Not that my food would last that long....", "author": "Aaron T."}

The plus of this place is that they offer pictures on some of their items from their menu listings, and the servers are always nice to explain what items they have.\n\nThe back seating areas are clean and not blocking anyone's path.

At first my brother and I were going to go to Burger King to appease his daughter. I was secretly hoping we weren't as I'm on a Test of Wills of not eating burgers. To my luck, we couldn't find parking at the BK on Geary and ended up on Clement. We saw a couple of Dim Sum places and decided to have that instead. Plus there was a readily available parking space. Yipeee! The first one we went to (don't recall the name) was closed on Tuesdays. So, we ended up at Gourmet because it was a little under a block away, so we tried it. \nI'm sure there's much better Dim Sum places, but I think any Dim Sum place in SF Trumps most places in So Cal.\n Prices were incredibly reasonable. We ordered the standard stuff. Some Baos, Har Gow, Shu Mai and Pot Stickers. The Baos were good as were the Shu Mai. The Har Gow was average and the Pot Stickers... I could have done without. Everything got cold really fast after we ordered. Strange. I know it's SF, but it wasn't that cold a day. \nService wasn't the fastest, but it gave me time to find the Engrish on the menu board. I found two mistakes. \nNot the best Dim Sum I have had in SF, but sure beats the heck out of Burger King!", "author": "H Q."}

Their white honeycomb cake (bak tong gou) is surprisingly decent: it has a great, light texture from having airy holes so that when you bite into a piece, it doesn't have a chewy, mochi-like consistency.

I've tried 4-5 of them. This one is the best of the lot.\n\nAll of the dumpling take-out places on Clement St. charge about the same price - give or take a few cents.\n\nI tried the Har Gow and the Hong Sai Gow (like a Har Gow plus chives, I think) and the dragon dumpling. All were very good for take-out, and as good as or better than most sit-down Chinese places I've been to.\n\nThe shrimp didn't taste old or overcooked.\n\nDespite what some of the other reviewers said, I found the woman who worked the counter to be nice. She even answered a couple questions about ingredients for me.\n\nDownside: they didn't have any deep-fried stuff. For that, you have to go down another half block or so to Clement Restaurant.

I'm not used to ordering dim sum at a counter, so there was some pressure in deciding what I wanted and delivering my order loudly and promptly. You don't come here for four star service, so you just have to be one mental step ahead of the lady behind the counter, I suppose. \n\nOn to the food. Their chicken congee didn't come with a thousand year old egg, but the portion was generous and flavorful with ginger and succulent shreds of chicken. The fried savory rice dough ball (for lack of a better description) was crispy and chewy, but sadly, cold and seriously lacking on filling. Har gow was sticky and succulent, but the Chinese chive and shrimp dumpling was the best of them all. I'm not a huge fan of egg custard tarts, but theirs wasn't bad-- the crust was actually flaky and crisp, not the soft, limp deal that usually houses the custard filling. Finally, the char sui bao. To me, a dim sum restaurant's overall quality is based on their char sui bao. This place didn't quite pass the test: the pork wasn't sweet enough, had a faint hint of cooking wine, and was pretty fatty. Sorry Gourmet Dim Sum.
