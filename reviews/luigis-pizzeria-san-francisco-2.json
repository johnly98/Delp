The restaurant had just young adults as staff it seemed like. We were not greeted in a friendly manner just a simple \"hey how are you? How many?\" We were shown to our table from the host and my side of the table I had duct tape covering the all the holes in the leather but at least we had a view of San Francisco bay. Nikoleta was our waitress but I found that was her name once we got the bill. She never introduced herself and just went right to asking what we wanted to drink then once she came back she took our orders. I ordered the tortellini with a Stella Artois and both were actually pretty good and we got the cheesy garlic bread as an appetizer and that was delicious.

One of my co-workers got a salad that I nibbled on, and it was yummy. I ended up ordering the shrimp scampi, and I learned from our waiter that the shrimp was fresh (I had to ask...some places are right by the water and still use frozen fish). It was superb. I ate my food faster than anyone else at the table lol my only complaint is that there wasn't more pasta! The pasta was buttery, there was garlic mingled in, but definitely not to excess.

WHY?! So trying to ignore the immediate rudeness, we order 2 cokes and a medium pizza. While we waited our previous waiter told another waiter that was sitting in the NEXT BOOTH that he didn't want to deal with us! Woooooooooowww! So I told my boyfriend to check Yelp and of course all the complaints are basically about customer service. How are you going to treat customers this way and expect business. Feel sorry for the owner that have these rude waiters ruining his life business. Anyways I got up and told my bf let's just pay for the sodas and go down to chowders where I know the food is good and the people are friendly. Well they charged us $9.18 for the cokes and yelled at us for ordering food and cancelling! Wow I handed then a 10 and they said nothing and started to walk away and I asked for my change. I'm not tipping anyone a penny that yells at me. So please don't go here. They don't know what they are doing and they talk shit in their language thinking you won't understand.

My wife and I walked past Luigi's and noticed that there were lots of empty tables and no line, unlike the other restaurants nearby. Italian sounded good, so we thought we'd give it a go.\n\nWe waited at the host table and watched multiple staff walk by, make eye contact, and continue on with their duties. After several minutes, one of the servers came up to us and harshly confirmed \"two?\" and grabbed a couple menus then started to walk away. We assumed this meant to follow. He absently tossed the menus on a table and continued to walk. We hesitantly took a seat and noticed a table next to us that looked very annoyed. A lady at the table tried to get the attention of the guy who sat us (likely to get her check, as they all looked like they were done eating and eager to leave), but to no avail. \n\nAfter glancing at the menu and reading the body language of the other people at tables near us, we took a quick look at the online reviews and confirmed our concern that maybe we should look elsewhere for sustenance.

Don't think you need to be prepared and you'll be spending lots of time sitting and waiting for someone to come back.. refills, boxes, check.. etc. This is a Good pizza spot with some nice views, it WILL take some time 15-20 min just for someone to seat you and there will be plenty of open tables. 15 min-20 wait to be seated. We made sure to have our order ready (have been here before) drinks, apps, pizza, etc so we could order RIGHT as we sat down. If you're prepared you'll be thankful not to have to wait 30 min to place your order. In about 10 min we got our fries and the large pizza came soon after, piping hot and delicious.  Waited about 10 min for the check and a box (had payment ready when box was brought back with check.

We paid almost $70 for two pasta meals, two sodas, and small salads. Also, SF includes this extra tax to cover health care for the employees; I appreciate that they offer healthcare, but it's frustrating that restaurants make customers pick up the cost and then charge tax on top of it! Yes it's a small amount (like $2-3), but the food is already a rip off and then we have to pay more because restaurants are stingy and make customers pay extra for their employees health care. The service was decent, but again, way too expensive. Sodas are $4, which is so overpriced it's not even funny.

Since it was their day, I let them choose the restaurant for lunch. Of course, they selected pizza so this is where we ended up. The gal seating folks was terrible. She had a frown on her face, was unkempt, and extremely rude. When we were finally seated, we were greeted by our server who was just a notch better than the other employee we encountered. Clearly, service is not their strength.\n\nWell, food was no better. Pizza tasted like Costco pizza but a notch below. The garlic bread was almost $10 and it was half a very small loaf - the photo makes it look big but it was really not. The chowder was barely hot and tasted canned. The pasta with pesto was over cooked with what seemed to be store bought sauce just thrown on top. \n\nTo top the experience off, the booth where we were sitting smelled like vomit. I would have asked to switch tables but by then it was almost 3pm and we had already waited close to 45 minutes for a table.\n\nThis was my first and last time at this place.", "author": "Lina L."}

The server called out our name and we heard him on the first call and headed to him, but another couple stepped up and took our spot (f*** them) and the idiot server took them away even though he HAD JUST SEEN US 5 MINUTES AGO and we were one of the only people waiting for a table so there's no excuse for forgetting our faces.  When he came back he realized his mistake, but did not apologize.  When we were seated, I could tell that this table was typically not used to serve guests.  He sat us in the corner where there was no one else, the sun was beating down on our faces to the point where we were squinting and uncomfortable, there were no napkins, salt & pepper shakers or red pepper flakes.  After 15 minutes we had to flag down a waitress to take our order since we were seated away from everyone else.  We asked if we could do half/half for one large pizza and she said yes.  She failed to mention there is an extra charge of $3.50 per flavor so it was an additional $7 just because we wanted two flavors on one pizza.  Ridiculously overpriced and shady of her to not to tell us.  The bill came out to be $38.53 for 1 large pizza with 2 flavors, and 1 coke.  The chicken alfredo was pretty much all sauce, there were barely any pieces of chicken and tomato.  The combo flavor had sparse toppings as well.  We both walked out still hungry and irritated.  Worst pizza ever!!!! \n\nTLDR:\nService: 1/5 SHADY waitress and IDIOT server\nFood: 2/5 (sparse toppings, pretty much all sauce and dough)", "author": "Sabrina T."}

It was pretty slow when me and my 5 friends went in, and still they couldn't keep up. We ordered our appetizers fine, and they came out in a decent time, but after that it went all downhill. The server NEVER came back to finish our order, and never came to check on us until we had to wave him down. After finally ordering, we waited over 30 minutes without getting our food. My friend ordered calamari that NEVER arrived. And in that 30 minutes we waited to get our food, we were never approached by our waiter on any updates or anyone checking in on us. The waiter seemed to be really stressed, which i understand at first due to working in a restaurant as a Supervisor. But it seemed like he was avoiding the dining area due to him knowing how much of a shit hole this place was.  Every 5-10 minutes a table would get up and just leave after receiving their drinks, or not getting anything at all due to them taking so long with everything. We watched around 5-6 tables of people get up and leave.  After waiting too long for food, we tell the waiter that we want to cancel our order and just pay for the drinks we got, and leave. Then he tells us he's gonna go check on our food and magically brings out all 5 dishes.  After arguing with what seemed to be the manager, he told us we were rude for putting our hand up in the air to get their attention, which was the only way to do so since they NEVER came to our table to check on us. But we still called them over in a polite way. One of my friends ended up walking out because his food took so long, and they still tried to force us to pay for our friends food, and told us that it was our fault and we need to pay or they will call the cops.  Note that my friend left wayyy before our food arrived, so it's not like he ate anything off the plate.  Just hands down terrible service. I know they were understaffed, which was obvious, since the two waiters were acting as hosts, servers, waiters, bus boys, and pouring the alcohol at the bar themselves which is why i was trying to be patient with them since i know they were struggling. But they still could have done their best with communicating to their customers that it might be a little long wait for food, and AT LEAST check in on us every now and then, but they never did any of that.", "author": "Jake J."}

That is why I'm giving this place four stars. The food is good but nothing memorable. I still feel Broco Billy's Pizza in fremont CA  is hard to beat. But Luigis was a pretty decent place to sit Down and enjoy a good slice of pizza. On the other hand I do not think I would be willing to drive more than five minutes to reach a Luigis location.

He clearly didn't like his job or just had a bad day since he couldn't wait to leave and shout it out to everyone in the restaurant. \n\nAfter finally getting seated by who we believe was the hostess(who also didn't seem like she didn't want to be there) we were able to get a waiter who was much more welcoming. I really had no problem with our waiter. He genuinely seemed like a nice guy and I would have really liked him if it wasn't for everything else.

He was nice and offered to box it for me, but after he took my plate a person from my group informed me that our waiter cleaned up the table with his bare hands. I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt but I really hope that my waiter washed his hands first before handling my food. \n\nLeaving that thought behind our waiter comes back to our table to give our check. Our group was only a group of five yet our waiter already added an 18% to our bill. After asking him if we can split it into two he came back with the bill still with the 18% tip added to BOTH of the checks. Thinking that it was just him informing us of the overall total with tip we gave our cards to him.

However, this time I was with my uncle, younger brother and cousin. They were visiting from LA and my uncle wanted to check out Pier 39. The two youngsters were complaining and complaining that they were hungry/dying and demanded pizza and/or pasta. So, we were walking down pier 39 with the rows and rows of shops/restaurants and saw the sign for Luigi's Pizzeria. So, we walked in and I got my phone out to check in. I was pretty shocked to see the 2.5 stars! I didn't want to say anything out loud but I was thinking.. man, we didn't make the best choice of eating here for lunch. \n\nAll of that aside though, we walked in and the lady in the front kindly led us to our booth table (which I was so happy to have). It was right next to the water and view of the bay bridge with all the yachts!! They had a salad bar (which I was unsure whether it was free or not..should've asked), nice \"pizza place\" decoration, which might make sense only in my head. They had cute Christmas decorations as well! \n\nYou can order the pizza on their menu, or create your own. I think the mini is a good size for one person, because I was stuffffed afterwards. I ordered the Vegetarian pizza. The waiter wasn't too friendly; he just got his work done, as in he took our orders without a smile on his face. It didn't bug me too much though because all I was thinking about was the food!! \n\nThe wait was incredibly long.. It literally felt like forever until our orders came out. I read some of the reviews and was really scared to take my first bite into the pizza. Would it be cold because it was \"frozen\"?! However, all four of us enjoyed our pizza. I even ate the crust, which says something because I never eat my crust. It had a nice semi-salty flavor that tasted really good if I bit into it with some of the topping/cheese part. :) I probably shouldn't have even finished my pizza because we were having crab for dinner that night, but I just wanted to finish everything. \n\nI'll admit, it's not the best pizza I've eaten, but it was still pretty darn good!", "author": "Christine Y."}

Not bad--it wasn't the worst noodles and sauce I've tasted, just not distinctive.  If you like whole cloves of garlic in your pasta sauce, this place is for you.\n\n--The service.  Pretty friendly, but also pretty sparse.  The restaurant was only half full, but staff visits to our table did not not come by too often.\n\n--The price.  As with all Pier 39 establishments, this is pretty high.  A 14-inch pie with only basil costs about $18.  But we expected this.  No fair expecting a bargain at Pier 39. . .\n\nOverall, 3 stars.  The fancy fish houses may serve a comparable chowder, but will make you wait for it.  However, you're not going here for clam chowder, you're going here for pizza, dang it!  \n\nAverage pizza joint.  Just average.", "author": "Matthew D."}

As I was about to say something the lady called my name, and my girlfriend and I were seated with a family of 6 at an 8 person table. This made zero sense because there were two other smaller tables available to sit and eat at next to the table of 8. Food was very mediocre. Bland and Soggy Caesar Salad as well as what looked to be a microwaveable pepperoni pizza that you get from a middle school lunch line. Last but not least, both the men and women's bathrooms were indescribably horrendous. The men's toilet was over flowing with matter and was not flushable, as well as graffiti on the mirrors and trash scattered throughout the floor and whole restaurant. The women's restroom was just as bad, except if you put down enough seat covers it was slightly possible to use it. After paying for our meal, we were handed the wrong change back. It was only a little under a dollar, but it's wrong, no matter how much money it is. Will never eat here again.", "author": "Parker T."}

Not sure what pizza to order,  we asked Damik and he suggested the meat pizza. The pizza came fully loaded, hot, and fresh.  One of the best pizza's we've had for a long time.  Not to much sauce, plenty of meat and cheese and the crust was perfect.  Damik took our drink orders, brought out the pizza and checked in on us to make sure everything was to our liking.

The hostess was just off.\nOur waiter - sweet as pie, but he was a little spacey as well.\nIt seemed like most of their staff were just wandering around. Coming out of the kitchen with peoples food looking lost, like they didn't know which table it was going to. \n\nWe ordered their clam chowder and it was delicious, however, we asked for pepper as the tables only had salt and red pepper flakes (WTH?) and waited so long that we asked a neighboring table for their pepper. The soup was getting cold. -SIGH- My husband ordered their spaghetti, I ordered their Treasure Island pizza and 2 Arnold Palmer's. The spaghetti was good, the pizza was cooked to perfection but the crust and toppings had no flavor, it was bland, like the ingredients were old. The Arnold Palmer's were weak.\n\nWhat ALMOST made me go OFF is the fact that when the waiter ran my credit card, he brought back our parking validation, credit card and NO RECEIPT showing what he ran. I told him there was no receipt and he said \"Oh, let me go look for it\". Oookaaaye....this has never happened before. He comes back and says he couldn't find it and flips the original bill over and was about to draw a line with an X for me to sign it and I told him \"Absolutely not! I need a receipt!\" WHO DOES THAT?!!!! You aint about to just flip this paper over and tell me to sign it. It's called a REPRINT, and that's exactly what he did.

I will repeat that:  VEGAN cheese, but NOT vegan pizza CRUST. \n\nAmusing (but annoying) moments:  \n- They brought one person 'bo-less' buffalo wings and didn't understand why she didn't want that (not what she ordered?).  \n- When asked what was on a pizza (so he could tell him whether or not it was his), the server said, 'I don't know. There are 'toppings' - it was his first day, so he could not identify the ingredients.  \n- Wine was poured from a glass, not the bottle - odd.  \n\nIn general, the food was not 'horrible,' but it was a big disappointment ...

Yes,  it was a little expensive, but it's a touristy area.  My low rating comes from the horrible service.  Our waitress ignored us a few times.  Never brought us anything... Then the first time she came over she said 'you ready?'.  She never greeted us,  she never brought us drinks. I felt like I had to do her job for her. Plus asking for stuff inconvenienced her.  I tried to not let that ruin the night... But she just obviously didn't care about proper service.  Luckily,  I realized that was just how she was and she wasn't just attacking me and my boyfriend.  Everyone received the same service from her.  Also,  bathrooms here are horrendous! For a tourist spot,  that was embarrassing.

It tool forever and a day to order and the pizza tasted like a microwave pizza and even though we ordered a large, the four of us only ate two small slices each. Many other customers seemed unhappy with the service. I found out later that the tip is included in the bill, therefore the staff doesn't have to be concerned with quality of service because it doesn't exist here. \nThe only positive thing here was the view of the Bay, other than that Luigi's left a bad taste in my mouth.", "author": "Robert B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-17", "description": "Huh. The first ever review that I've written with a 1 star rating.\n\nWe came on a Sunday around 130 or so.\n\nAlright...here's the overview of why they earned a crappy rating.\n1. OVERPRICED (yes, I'm aware I'm in a tourist trap. But if it's going to be expensive as hell I want it to at least be justifiable.)\n2. SLOW. Good lord... from the time it took going in to the time it took going out...\n3. FOOD WASN'T GREAT. OR GOOD. I believe I don't really need to explain this one. But I probably should.\n\nHere's the more detailed explanation:\n\n1. For two people, the bill was 55$. Not sure if that was before/after tax and SF CITY surcharge (what is that???). For 55$, you can be the proud owner of a medium pizza and two pasta dishes.\n\nSpaghetti with Meatballs - 14$\nPenne with Pesto & Chicken - 17$\nMedium Pizza (6 slices) w/ Pepperoni and Mushrooms - 17$\n2 Waters\n\n2. When we arrived, there were plenty of tables available. However, for some reason it took them 10 minutes to seat us (and I'm going to ignore the fact that it took us 5 minutes to find the hostess). Maybe they're understaffed, or maybe they're just slow. But it took them longer than the average pizzaria to deliver our goods. When it came time to get the check, we were sitting there trying to get ahold of someone so we could get the check. I actually had to go up and wait at the empty hostess stand for a good 5 minutes before I saw the check being delivered... I think our waitress saw me up there and figured out what I wanted, so she printed out the check. But the fact that I had to do that was exasperating enough without all of the other things. Oh, and good luck trying to catch your server. Note: I am very patient at restaurants; I try to be nice to everyone there and I don't like to have to be pushy. So this should tell you enough.\n\n3. Um, ew as far as the Pizza goes. The pepperoni had an unusually chemically smell to them (more so than regular pepperoni), and the crust didn't seem like it was done. It tasted half baked and doughy. Usually the crust is my favorite part, but I couldn't bring myself to enjoy this. However, since I paid 17, I tried to eat it. My sister however, couldn't eat hers. She took a bite, made a face, and didn't take another bite. She didn't even want to bring it home.\nThe pasta is alright, tastes fine. If you must go for pasta here, get the pesto. Don't do the spag with meatballs. But I don't think that it was worth it due to portion size. See photos.\n\nNote: I don't believe the menu on the Pier 39 website is current. It was different from the one we had when we went.\n\nTo sum it up: Don't go here. I wouldn't. Don't don't don't.\nOr as Yelp says, Eek! Methinks not.", "author": "Nik B."}

We ordered a large sausage and salami pizza, half with mushrooms. I had my three kids with me, they're not a big fan of mushrooms which is why it was only on half. \n\nIt took a good 20-25 minutes until we got the pizza...I guess that's a normal amount of time for pizza to bake? But there was only like three tables of people in the restaurant...I dunno. Anyways, I had good company, so it didn't really matter. \n\nAnyways, we got the pizza...it was okay. I don't think that they put mushrooms on it or they blended in REALLY well. Neither myself or my friend are big complainers so we just let it be and ate the \"half\" with the scarce/invisible mushrooms. \n\nMy friend wanted some hot chocolate or some sort of espresso after dinner. The waiter was nice in telling us that their coffees aren't that good and to go to the biscotti place at the beginning of the Pier. Best advice ever! \n\nWould I come here again, probably not.

Well we were about to find out.\n\nThis was the worst pizza that I have ever had in my life.  And that includes those Mr. P's frozen pizzas you buy for a dollar.\n\nWe started off with the cheesy garlic bread because we saw it mentioned on a yelp and they said it was good.  We got it at our table, and it looked great.  We bit into is, and the bread was soft, but not hot, fresh, steamy soft, but cardboardy, frozen, or stale soft.  It was very dense, thick and soft.  Not crispy on the outside, and light and soft on the inside like you would expect a garlic or french bread to be, but thick, heavy, soft, and crumbly.  It just wasn't right for bread.  It wasn't crispy at all.  It really tasted pre made, then microwaved or something.  It was like fake bread or something.  I just can't describe it.  Ok, maybe that was just a bad one we said.  Just the appetizer, right?\n\nWe ordered the combination pizza, and given how crappy the bread was, we couldn't wait for it to come.\n\nThe pizza was on the same type of bread!!!!

I paid the total $40.40 with my card and I was planning on giving a tip with cash. I just signed the receipt without writing a total on it and gave it back to the waiter.

He wasn't rude about it but he looked annoyed. At this point, I wasn't planning on leaving a tip anymore. I have never been questioned or felt forced to leave a tip before. I looked at my cousin because I didn't know how to react, is this guy seriously asking for a tip. I look back at him and I take the receipt from his hand, I tell him I'm going to write the total.

No one ever came to us we walked up to the bartender and asked if we seat ourselves, a worker approached us and asked us a table for how many and we replied with three and she just said pick any table you want and walked away. We waited for fifteen minutes with no one ever coming to our table. I looked around the employees were mingling with each other. I noticed other customers looking disgruntled.

Well looking for  a place to eat wasn't to hard but was in the mood for some pizza. \n\nThe atmosphere was pleasant and the view was nice looking out onto the water, the staff looked like pirates...well to me they did with their beards. The service was OK, would rate it higher if they ensured our drinks were filled as well as there seemed to be a limited supply of red peppers around different tables.\n\nWe started off with the cheesy bread, it was very cheesy and greasy, they provided a small thing of marinara sauce(we had to ask for a second servings of marinara). It was good.\n\nI ordered the famous clam chowder, after all its claimed famous...I really enjoyed the added bacon bits and was probably the best thing I had here and would recommend it.\n\nThe pizza on the other hand fell short, with very little sauce and mainly cheese and bread. Used the marinara sauce to put some on the pizza. \n\nOverall I would recommend for the clam chowder, but not the pizza. Good for families who want something quick and somewhat affordable in a touristy spot.", "author": "Eric G."}

We wanted a sit down restaurant where we could get a bite, a drink, and not wait for 30 minutes with my little girl.  Luigi's fit the bill on all accounts.  My wife and I ordered pizza while my mom had a salad.  The pepperoni that I ordered was some of the best pizza that I had eaten in quite some time.  I demolished my pie in record time, and I would have eaten more, had I ordered a larger pizza - it was just that good.  My wife raved about her pizza too.  Not a bite of pizza was left anywhere on the table when we were done.  And the cheesy garlic bread that we ordered as an appetizer (and to give some to our 16mo old daughter) was very good.  The view was pretty good, which was also not something that we expected; we had a nice view overlooking part of the harbor where some local boats were docked.  \n\nAll in all, really a great experience for a very touristy place at the end of Pier 39.

My dad and I came in here on Christmas day and just based on the location and menu- I wasn't expecting much but seriously this was way worse than I had ever dreamed. We were not greeted and sat down, took ten minutes to even be acknowledged and get a menu brought to us by a kitchen staff member. Then after about 20 minutes (!?) we are greeted by the only server who walks up to us. We said, \"Hi how are you?\" Almost in tears she said \"Horrible- we are disgustingly overstaffed and actually I'm the only one here \" We placed an order and almost walked out because it was taking so long, and we didn't get drinks and the place was visibly slammed. I felt really bad for our server- so much so that it made us uncomfortable. There were probably 50 people in the restaurant, all angry, asking for things and complaining so after no service for almost a half hour we tried to leave but she said the food would be ready soon so we took our coats back off. The food was surprisingly okay but we weren't able to ask for Parmesan or anything else that we may have wanted due to the service. As a concierge in SF- I would highly advise to avoid this restaurant. As for management, you should consider staffing more appropriately or perhaps being present as your restaurant is going up in flames. I'm sure our waitress cried after her shift- I certainly would have. My dad and I left pretty upset for how bad we felt for the waitress :(", "author": "Alex F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-12-27", "description": "This place is the worst possible. I will describe my experience in the sequence of how it happened:\n\n1. First, I stepped into the restaurant with my family and family friends. We were told to wait \"3 minutes\" exactly for a window seat. Only 1 minute later, another waitress comes up to us and asks us what we wanted and curtly told us to move aside to wait at a different part of the restaurant. It's not hard to do, but her tone was curt and not even polite. So we did so. \n\n2. After we gave up the window seat since 3 minutes obviously passed, we proceeded to ordering. We ordered 2 bowls of bread clam chowder along with other dishes, and the family friend also ordered 1 bowl of clam chowder along with one dish of garlic bread & other dishes. I am only specifying the dishes in which we had issues with, which is already about half of the meal. When the meal came, she gave us only 1 BOWL of clam chowder (bowl, not bread bowl) and 1 bread bowl. BOTH of which were not even lukewarm, but slightly COLD. Excuse me? I can go to Safeway and buy a cold canned bowl of clam chowder myself, thank you very much. We informed them of the coldness and you know what the waitress told me rudely? \"I don't know but it was just made and I took it out right away.\" Do I look like I care? The problem is, the chowder is cold. Period. There is nothing else to say, and I am not an idiot that will believe it \"just came out of the hot, boiling pot\" and would turn cold in a matter of seconds. She finally told us she would reheat it up. Fine, if they fix it, I thought, I'd be happy.\n\n3. She came back with the bowl first. It was lukewarm now. Great job. Then she came back with the bread bowl; it's finally hot-- I will give them that much credit. But when we asked about the 3rd bread bowl and why the bowl clam chowder was not bread bowl, she told us \"That is what you ordered.\" Obviously I know what i ordered; she did not bother apologizing during the entire scenario about all the mess-ups and cold food. \n\n4. The waiter told us the garlic bread is \"four slices.\" It was actually 2 slices cut in halves. Very sketch... and dishonest. \n\n5. Finally at the end, we were contemplating on giving them less tip for all the unhappiness brought upon us on this trip to San Francisco. But guess what the genius waitress told us? \"Parties of 5 or more have to pay 15% gratuity.\" REALLY NOW? parties of FIVE? isnt it usually parties of 6 or more? so now we're forced to pay a freaking 15% gratuity for the WORLD'S WORST SERVICE AND FOOD AS WELL. \n\nTo be honest, I am not that hard to please. If they just had good attitude and apologized for messing up our order along with giving us cold food, I wouldn't be writing this terrible review. All we need is some common courtesy for paying so much in a restaurant that gives so little in return. But they couldn't even manage that. \n\nPOOR SERVICE/ATTITUDE, POOR QUALITY FOOD, AND OVERALL TERRIBLENESS. I wish I could give them negative stars, but the least amount is 1 star.", "author": "Linda W."}

I took a bite out of a meatball and it was the first time I have eaten beef that didn't taste like anything AT ALL.  At one point I had to wonder whether I had come into contact with toxic fumes that had wiped out my sense of smell and taste. \n\nDidn't order the salad, but I saw their \"salad bar\"...Pizza Hut has better salad bars. \n\nService: AWFUL.  We waited 30 minutes before our waitress took our order (we might as well have waited to eat at an actual restaurant).  She never came back around, we had to hunt her down to get our check and waited at least a half an hour for her to come pick it up, but she never showed.  We weren't the only one with this problem, there was another group that waited with their check just as long and was holding it up in the air for anyone to come get it.  Eventually my boyfriend had to take it up to them after many failed attempts at getting some other rando waiter to get it.\n\nDon't eat here unless your life already sucks that hard or you like bland, tasteless food.

They gave us a good heaping of toppings and the crust was nice and thick.  I wouldn't mind going back there to get the pizzas again if I'm ever back in SF. Oh, and the prices here are pretty good compared to the other restaurants at the pier.", "author": "Pugsly W."}

My stomach was burning yearning for some Pizza. Stumbled our way to Pier 39 and found my way in Luigi's Pizzeria. \n\nWhile looking for a place where seafood wasn't the main course it was bubba humps or luigis, and since me and phineas weren't willin to wait 45 min for a seat, luigis and their pizza sounded appetizing We entered and were given a menu and were told to seat ourselves...unprofessional!!\nWe sat down and waited for someone to serve us.\n\nWith pockets filled with lint and past due bills, we opted for the all you can eat option. Excited with the thoughts of full stomachs we made our way to their buffet stands and noticed very cold pizza, pasta and yes salad with no croutons. To my dismay when I went to their pasta stand only two meatballs remained. Knowing the scarcity of the poor selection and quantity available of food I was sadly beaten to the last bread roll that was available by a random kid that was hovering around all the stands. Was really looking forward to bread rolls and the fact I got beaten by a kid who had a stomach that can eat a whole buffet saddened me!\n\nAfter grabbing our limited amount of food we sat down next to a broken window, and hoping that the soup was going to warm us up, it didnt satisfy us because just like San Francisco weather, it was cold. Nothing but the beer Phineas ordered was good. After pondering for a moment at how ridiculous this place was, the thought of walking out dawned upon us. \n\nThe waiters paid us no mind and didn't bother to even acknowledge us at the table we decided that it was time to just go back to hookahs and unmentionable things. If you like cold food and poor service just endure the wait elsewhere. We casually made our way out from the establishment..THEN ran down the stairs. Only after making sure to show them we were fancy by leaving a $2 tip. Figured that would better then a pocket full of lint.", "author": "Phineas F."}

If you order the fried ravioli you will pay $9 for 7 ravioli that can be easily purchased at COSTCO.\nThe alfredo sauce is tasteless, like a neon green, sequined, backless, mini dress at a funeral tasteless. Even with the liberal application of pepper no improvement was made. It was as if this glue like substance was a black hole which absorbed the soul of other flavors and sent them to food purgatory. \nThe pizza was \"my boyfriend left me for his best friend at the prom\" disappointing. Rough cutting onions in large chunks does not make the pizza rustic, it makes it inedible. Placing these under the cheese insures that said onions will not cook, thus the customer will bite into a large piece of raw onion.  Also little attention was paid to the canned mushrooms this led to the pizza having a metallic taste. The pesto was weak, coming from the same soul sucking family as the alfredo.

Our party was of 11 people in where 6 were children. After our tour at Alcatraz everyone was pretty hungry. When we arrived they told us a 20 minute wait that sounded great so we stayed. Little did we know we had mad a bad choice.  When we were seated they split our group to get us seated faster. We were ok with that. One of the tables that we were giving was at a booth all the way back to the restaurant in the corner. As we sat down the table wobbled to a side looked like it was going to fall over. We decided not to sit there and risk the chance of our food landing on our laps later. Part of our group sat at a table across from the kids table. Our table was dirty and the guy who had sat us done said he would come back and clean it. That never happen he never came. I called someone over and informed them about the situation and he came right over and cleaned our table. Found out that we was our waiter and stated he would provide great service.\nWell after that he never came back.  The kids remain at their booth and we saw a table by the window next to them that opened up and we moved over to that table. 20-30 minutes have passed and no one has asked us to our order. A different waiter came up and said he was helping our waiter out due to he was behind on his orders. He took our orders and 10 minutes later our drinks finally came out. 30 minutes later the kids food came out and the soup that some of us had ordered. The Clam chowder was Luke warm. Two of us ate it only because we were hungry and didn't want to wait any longer. One of us sent the soup back and let the waiter know  that the soup was cold and to please do something about it. You would think they would bring you a new soup, I guess they don't do that here because same soup was brought 10 minutes later and it was super hot due to the microwave time they had set it too.\nThe kids finished with their food and 4 of us were still waiting for our food. Who knew that something simple as two medium pizza's would take so long. The waiter came over and asked if we needed anything else.... Really?! Yes hello we are missing our food. I informed him of this and he said he was sorry and would look into it. 10 minutes later he showed up with our pizza's.... Our pizza's were cold. We all just looked at each other and let the waiter know but told him we would eat it due to we have been waiting over an hour now and everything just seem to come out wrong and we were frustrated by now. The main waiter came over and asked what was wrong so I told him. He offered for us to speak with the manager so I took him up on his offer. He came back later saying that the manager wasn't there but we could call him. I told him to disregard because I'm sure that was even going to take longer. \nLittle did we know the kids hadn't received utensils when their food came out and had a to wait awhile for them to arrive after they notified the waiter. I asked for the bill and told them to take off he tip because they hadn't earned it with us and I was not' going to pay that. I was informed I couldn't do that. So my sister asked to speak with someone who was left in charge. Low and behold they finally came up with someone and we explained what had occurred. She said there wasn't anything she could do and she had called the manager \"John\" and said we had to pay.  I told her they should just take off all of the soups and the pizza off since that was what was wrong. She said she couldn't do that . I told her I wanted to speak with the manager and get him on the phone. She called him and the manger refused to speak with us. I told her I wanted his name an d number , that too she refused.

We did n not get refills,server got my 2 yr old daughter a huge cup of soda and realized it was to big and gave her a kids  drink and got charged for the big drink. We sat there waiting for the check for 30 minutes and noone acknowledge us at all. Waiters just kept looking at us and knew we were getting annoyed but just kept talking to each other, 4 waiters there couple feet from us and didn't say anything. Our waiter did not even look at us or ask if everything was ok. Had to get up and interrupted the waiters conversation and tell them can we pay and they said where's your waiter. We just got up and started heading out the door until finally our waiter came up to me n said I was looking for you and that got me even mad.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-09-02", "description": "The only reason why I am leaving one star, is because I can't leave zero stars! I am so incredibly disappointed with this restaurant! My family and I traveled 3 hours to San francisco to do some sight seeing and shopping for the day. We were in the mood for some yummy pizza, so decided to give this place a try. The location is great, with a great view! And that's about it! We are seated and aren't even greeted by our server till 10 min later. I go to the bathroom to wash my hands to see a filthy slippery nasty bathroom. I come back out and our server finally shows up, we order our drinks and didn't get them till 15 min later, and don't even get our complete drink order! This entire time, the waiter wasn't even good enough to give us an explanation as into why it was taking so long. It is now 25 min that we have been there. Oh... BTW, we put in our food order with our drink order. We ordered one cup of clam chowder, one order of hot wings and a large combo pizza, kids spaghetti and a kids pepperoni pizza. We got our appetizers (wings and soup) 45 min after later! The wings were an absolute JOKE!!!!!! They were the smallest wings I have seen in my life!! And covered in Reds sauce, nothing special. The clam chowder was tasty, but wasn't your original clam chowder you go to Thee City to eat. It is now one hr and we are still waiting for our pizza! I finally see our waiter, and ask him how much longer it would be for our pizzas and spaghetti and he says he didn't know, but he'd go to check. He comes out 10 min later, with our large pizza and the kids spaghetti and tells us the other kids pepperoni pizza would be out in 5 min. Well it wasn't!!!! We waited 15 min and NO PEPPERONI PIZZA!!!! At that point, I just asked the hostess to get us the manager. As the manager comes out so does the pepperoni pizza. We tell her what's going on and how disappointed we were, and she didn't seem to care, she didn't take the time to talk to us about it, we didn't feel like we were valued costumers,instead she deducted the $24.99 that was the cost of the large pizza! ATTENTION to you LUIGIS PIZZERIA! We are NOT there to get free food! We are there to get GOOD food and GOOD service! She never came to check up on us after that. The pizza was bland and disgusting! I can get better pizza from a box at my local grocery store. The spaghetti gave my daughter a tummy ache and the wings were meat less! They asked us of we wanted a box to take our food home, ummm...No thanks!!!!!We were so angry that out of all the thousands of great restaurants in San Francisco we end up eating at the worst!!!! What a shame to them! I would suggest to Luigi's owners  that you take these reviews very serious, train your staff, train your managers, clean your bathrooms, fix whatever leak you have going on in there, and cook good quality good! I will never ever go here again!", "author": "Mg M."}

The lasagana my mom ordered was ok, said it wasn't worth the $14. The pizza hit the spot on the very cold afternoon. The service was ok, one of the waitresses brought our baby some water for her bottle. All the waitstaff stopped by to talk to our baby and say how adoreable she is.

We ordered hot wings which were pretty good. We shared a small pizza which was also good. It wasn't good enough however to say we would go back there if ever in the area. Some of it may be that they only have 2 bathrooms...one for men & one for women. The men's restroom was out of order so if you needed to go you had to wait in line for the women's restroom behind every man, woman & child. I ended up just having to use wet wipes & hand sanitizer out of my purse. Their website promised a fresh salad bar which is the biggest reason I chose this place but they didn't have one once we got there. The staff (except for the guy that cleaned our table...he was great) didn't seem very excited to be there. The place was dark & seemed dirty. (It wasn't dirty that I could tell but maybe the dark & decor just made it feel that way). Also, once all of our plates & glasses were cleared away we had to wait at least 10 minutes for our check & only received it then because we asked for it!

I can't even comment on the food because we didn't even get to that stage. We walk in, place doesn't seem too busy, but the staff is no where to be found. No hostess, so after waiting, we decide to seat ourselves. The table was still dirty and had the previous diner's old plates and food. 10 minutes later, a waitress comes up to us and tells us that we aren't supposed to seat ourselves and asks us to move to a smaller table. By this time, the entrance was packed with people looking for the hostess and waiting to be seated. We sit at our new table for another 10 minutes, no waitress, no menu, no drinks. So we walked out and had to squeeze by tons of people waiting to be seated. It was a wednesday and there were plenty of uncleared tables around.

Also, we never recieved any silverware and when i went to ask for a few sets I was told they were washing them.... What the heck?

We were there tonight with our young kids and after we sat down and had a very friendly host sit us down, we waited for a waiter.....and waited....and waited....for about 15 minutes. The restaurant wasn't full and they had 3 servers standing around by the buffet table talking. Two of them passed by our table several times, made eye contact with me and my husband but said nothing. We smiled at them hoping that one of them could come up to our table and at least let us know that they will be with us or someone else will....but it never happened. 15 minutes later, we saw they seated a white couple at one table and another white family at another table. (I make this point because we are minorities and we felt that was part of the issue at this point) The people that they JUST seated immediately had a server at their table and we gathered up our things and started to walk out. It was then the server came up and said, \"Oh, sorry..I didn't know you were\" WTF?! He passed by us several times and so did the other server and they didn't see us!!?? Seriously, did we blend in with the booth? We had two kids with us and I'm sure our toddler made some sort of noise that someone from across the restaurant heard! Ridiculous! We were the only minorities in the restaurant and they \"DIDN'T SEE\" us?! Yeah, right! This experience just put a very sour taste in my mouth that made me NOT want to eat anywhere in SF. I was so irritated at this point that we came home (30 miles away!) to go to a local pizzeria to get their food. Thank goodness for neighborhood joints! Bottom line, if you're a minority, don't come here! They \"won't see you\" at the booth 'cause you'll just blend in! This place is AWFUL!!!!!!!", "author": "Ruth A."}
