It was packed and the food looked amazing. We read reviews and were quite surprised by some of them. Saying the staff was rude, and the host ignored them. \n\nWe walked in, asked for a table and were seated in five minutes by one of the brothers who own the restaurant. He was very nice, matching wit and humor with ours. Our waitress, Erin Callahan rounded the corner in another two minutes with water and menus. She made great recommendations and threw in an order of garlic bread, which was hot and delicious. The meal of linguini and meatballs was exactly what we wanted and very good. Erin even brought us a side of the sauce because she though we'd like it to dip the garlic bread in. We also ordered the polenta that was also fabulous and all of it hot.\n\nMy only dig would be the food came too quickly so we didn't have much of a chance to absorb the ambiance!", "author": "Donna T."}

Service was great - our waitress was lively and very upbeat. I was offered a free drink since it was birthday and that made my day. I don't think this was the restaurant's official policy but generosity on the behalf of our very sweet waitress. I made sure to tip her well for her hospitality. I ordered Linguini with a cream sauce and mushrooms which was delicious! I also sampled a vegetarian tortellini and one with beef. Both were good.\n\nWith so many Italian food options in North Beach it's often hard to decide which one to choose.

This is the kind of place straight out of Goodfellas. I was expecting to see Paul Sorvino frying sausage and peppers in the back. From the great and professional host to the friendly and fun servers, this place is exactly how an Italian restaurant should be. This \"red sauce joint\" as Sinatra would put it, serves up terrific southern italian inspired dishes that will make it your new favorite spot in North Beach. \n\nI had the chicken parmigiana which was rolled thin (as it should be), lightly breaded and served with a side of linguini. Absolutely delicious. My dinner date had angel hair pesto and added prawns. She was also very pleased with her dish. They also have a great selection of wines to compliment your meal.\n\nThey don't take reservations but as I stated above, the host was great in securing me a great window table after a minimal wait.

Our out of town Italian friends asked to go here because it's one of their favorite Italian restaurants and we've also bumped into local friends drinking limoncello here before. We were here on a Sunday night at about 8:45pm and there were still many tables. We had to wait for a table for five and we gladly had drinks at the bar talkingto the patrons. My Dirty Martini was delish and I had another at dinner! The bartender is always really friendly when we're waiting for a table and she's very entertaining. She's been there for years, I think something like 20+. My husband really enjoyed the Chicken Parmesan. The chicken was pounded and so tender, you can fork it. My friends liked the Gnocchi with a creme sauce, Apollo loved the Spaghetti that came with my entree, and I very much enjoyed the Veal Marsala. They served a pretty hefty portion. The service is great here, with very friendly and attentive staff. It's a fairly small place so you can enjoy family meals and hear each other talk or have an intimate dinner.", "author": "Jen L."}

I noticed several small Italian restaurants while we were walking through North Beach, so I checked a few out on Yelp.\n\nI came across Sodini's and it looked like my kind of place. I am so glad we chose to have dinner here on our last night in San Francisco. We arrived around 7ish and the wait was about 45 minutes for the 3 of us. Sodini's is a great place to go just to people watch. Young, old, Italian, non-Italian, locals, tourists, etc. all come through the door. Mark, the host/owner was funny and very welcoming. \n\nSodini's is my vision of how an Italian restaurant in North Beach would be. Small, dark, old school wood bar and actually owned by an Italian. That being said, let's get to the food. When we were seated, Mark told us one of the specials was Gnocchi (Imported from Italy) in a Gorgonzola cream sauce. Needless to say, I was sold. Unfortunately, I don't recall what my wife and daughter had. Just goes to show you how good the Gnocchi was. So good, I couldn't recall anything else that was on the table. The Gnocchi was incredible. Tiny little pillows of heaven that deflated in your mouth. They were not chewie, as most Gnocchi tend to be. I love Gorgonzola and to have it in a cream sauce is heaven for me. Calories be damned! I actually finished the plate. The Gnocchi was so good that my wife and daughter both said they should have ordered it. \n\nOverall, Sodini's was a great experience for our last night in San Francisco. As for getting there, we were staying at the Mark Hopkins and walked to Sodini's. There was street parking (not free), but why would you drive when you can walk in San Francisco, right?", "author": "Bill S."}

He brought up, for instance, someone's child who has gotten so gay they now identify as trans and have the audacity to want to be cheerleader. This man then went on a tear about how this child was trying to get special treatment and described in alarming detail how this child wore sheer clothing - how exactly does this man know anything about this person's life???

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-04", "description": "I've been going there for years, but this is the first time I've written a review.  Whenever I'm in North Beach looking for good, old-fashioned Italian food, I stop by Sodini's first.  It's a very popular place and the wait time is usually 30-45 minutes.  This is typical for the area and should be factored in if you or your party are starving.  I will say it is worth the wait.\n\nI told my friend about this place and she was interested in trying it.  She doesn't know the city that well so it was also an opportunity to explore the neighborhood.  As a native San Franciscan (born & raised) who lives outside the city for some time now, it's a treat go back.  The area is so rich in history and culture and I miss it so much.\n\nWe arrived there a little after 6:00 pm and was told by the hostess that there was a 30-45 minute.  As mentioned by other reviewers, she took a mobile phone number and told us she call when our table was ready.  I suggested we walk around my old stomping ground and maybe try to find a bar that wasn't too crowded.  It also gave me the chance to play tour guide.  As luck would have it, the hostess called back in 10 minutes saying she could seat us. \n\nWhat I love about Sodini's is the neighborhood feel and lack of pretension.  It's not trying to be anything but great, little restaurant.  What I love most is the food.  It succeeds on both counts.  You can tell if the food is going to be good or not by how the place smells.  Immediately, you smell the garlic with a hint of tomato sauce and you know it's going to good.  The place was packed, which was also a good sign.\n\nWe were sat right away and after a few minutes our server introduced herself and took our drink orders (my friend had a lemon drop & I had a pint of Anchor Steam).  While enjoying our drinks and reviewing the menu, I scanned the meals being enjoyed by the other patrons and everything looked so good.  I chose a very decadent Tortellini Carbonara.  This is one of my favorite Italian dishes--although I try to order it infrequently--and I hadn't had theirs in years.  Without a doubt, this one of the best I've every tried.  Carbonara sauce can be tricky because it's just the right combination of egg yolks, cheese, pancetta and black pepper.  Some places have screwed it up by adding non-traditional ingredients to it like bacon and/or sausage (c'mon, man).  Sodini's gets it right using only traditional ingredients.  The tortellini was cooked to perfection; nothing ruins a carbonara like overcooked pasta.  I literally could have eaten two entire plates.\n\nMy friend had the Tortellini all Panna and it too was fantastic.  Both of our dishes came with garlic bread and I only wish there was more.  Thankfully, there was a basket of bread.  Yes, it was a carb-explosion.  My god, everything was so good.  We're definitely going back.\n\nFinally, our server (I forget her name) was awesome.  She was knowledgeable and attentive.  We couldn't have asked for more.", "author": "Rich H."}

Our expectations were to have some classic Italian dishes to load up on some carbs and to be easy on the GI system because we would be running early the next morning. Sodini's met our expectations for food, our server took care of us, and we had some fun hanging out in the bar.\n\nWe arrived at the first-come first-serve restaurant around 7 PM on a Saturday night and were quoted a 75 minute wait. The host/owner took my cell phone number and as we looked around we saw some empty seats at the end of the bar with Indians on TV, so we decided to have a seat and wait it out. We actually met and chatted with some other tourists that were from out of town and running the next day also which helped pass the time.\n\nOur wait ended up being one hour and we were sat in the corner booth right next to the window with a view of Green St. The restaurant has a very old school look and feel with very tight quarters for the patrons. It's loud and relaxed enough where everyone isn't boisterously loud screaming over each other but you can see that everyone is having a good time.\n\nOur food was delicious and pretty standard for restaurants in the area, as was the $93 pre-tip tab for three. The calamari wasn't greasy and the squid was not overcooked, but could have used a little salt out of the fryer.

We were able to sit outside without a wait and there are overhead heat laps which is a huge plus for that bay breeze.\n\nI love that the potions are huge here which allows you to actually split meals and not over indulge. \n\nEverything on the menu looked amazing but our group ended up ordering...\n\nCalamari appetizer and bruschetta \nTortellini carbonara\nSeafood linguini\nSpaghetti and meatballs \n\nThe calamari is lightly fried, the bread for the bruschetta is buttery with delicious overnight marinated tomatoes, creamy and flavorful sauces (all of them) and the meatballs were juicy!!!!\n\nSooo sooo good. Everything was flavorful. We regret nothing haha", "author": "Bianka G."}

We knew we couldn't go wrong with any Italian restaurant. \n\nThe overall ambiance seems very home-y, and each table is supplied with crayons and paper lined tablecloths which makes for a very casual and family-friendly setting. Tbh, my friends and I were pretty stoked to see some crayons and pretty much drew in between bites. \n\nI ordered the gnocchi pesto, and was expecting a much larger portion than what I ended up getting. As a small person, I didn't really mind since I don't eat much anyways, but didn't really think my meal was worth $17 + tax and tip. I wish there was another element to the dish other than just gnocchi and pesto, maybe some more veggies or something, since the texture and flavor got a little monotonous after a while. Gnocchi was unique though, since it was filled with pesto flavoring, as compared to typical non-filled gnocchi. \n\nOverall, okay experience. Service was good (props on continuously filling the bread basket!) and food was decent... just a little pricey.", "author": "Tina T."}

They must have had their taste buds neutralized at an early age.  We ate there recently. My friend had the seafood linguini. \nSomehow between the table and the kitchen the linguini morphed into spaghetti. The sauce was flavorless; the only discernible flavor was the flavor of the water the seafood was boiled in. I had angel hair pasta with pesto. The pesto sauce was OK, but had the pasta remained in the cooker another 30-secnds, it would have been mush. If you want really bad Italian food, this is the place.

This place nailed it, but it was impossible for me to finish, given the enormous (and delicious!) salad that came before and as part of my meal. \n\nI tried the wine described as, \"spicy red wine\", which came to our white-papered candlelit table in a simple and appropriately-portioned glass. It was a nice table wine with a little extra depth - nothing fancy, but just what you'd expect to be served in an Italian restaurant without fanfare. I wish I had seen the crayons sooner, which were tucked away behind the olive oil and balsamic vinegar.\n\nWe decided against coffee and once outside the restaurant, we noticed signage that said, \"No dessert,\" among other things that I don't need to enjoy a meal.

The food was authentic and the service was great! Our waitress was super witty and arranged the food for us in the colors of the Italian flag. LOL! Overall, we had a very enjoyable evening.\n\nThe only reason I am not giving this place a 5 star rating is because they don't take reservations and hence you have to end up waiting about 20-30 min which doesn't seem like a lot now, but is hard when you have to do it with such great food around you!", "author": "Divya S."}

We gotta veal parmigiana. We gotta vino. There ain't nothin' we ain't got that you don't want. Whatsamattuh? Maybe I go tell Don Corleone, eh. Capeesh? Oh good, you-a come in. Have a seat. And indeed Jamie W. and I did at the tiny table they squeezed next to the bar on the way to the toilet. There was a loud group of middle-aged tourists, the horned-up wives being particularly raucous in their adoration of the swarthy bartender. Ah, welcome to North Beach or at least the stereotypical view of it of which Sodini's does a masterful job of capitalizing.\n\nThe staff has their routines down pat here and the decor is everything you want it to be down to the plastic grapes on the overhead trellis and the photos of the Rat Pack on the wall (photo: http://bit.ly/17dlilj). No surprise that the menu is old-school Italian. We started with the $11.95 Caprese Salad, which appeared extravagantly priced for three slices of tomato topped with pieces of mozzarella and buried in a pile of fresh basil and red onion (photo: http://bit.ly/1v9POaS). While it was what I expected, it just didn't taste as fresh as I was hoping. For his entree, Jamie went for the $15.95 Linguini with Meatballs and Tomato Meat Sauce, which was nothing all that special except the quantity. There was a heaping pile of pasta on that plate and the veal meatballs were huge (photo: http://bit.ly/1vBbIPb).\n\nMine was the $18.95 Linguini with Seafood, which I had to admit was pretty good when it could have been easily mediocre. Granted the tomato cream sauce was a but much, but the plethora of clams, mussels, shrimp and calamari rings was a pleasant surprise along with the toasted garlic bread they put on the side of the plate (photo: http://bit.ly/1zkd5mU). The other pleasant aspect of our dining experience was the sassy veteran waitress who served us and didn't ignore us despite the high maintenance needs of the bands of tourists crowding the main dining room. So I guess we narrowly averted a horse's head in our bed, but I can see why Frank and Dean came here when they were in town. Bada-boom, bada-bing.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...old-school Italian executed like it was 1952 for better or worse, the linguini with seafood is the standout\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...also old-school and who would have it any other way?\nSERVICE - 4 stars...that waitress really made our experience better\nTOTAL - 3 stars...one of the true anchor points of North Beach but don't expect culinary artistry here", "author": "Ed U."}

However, it is still cooked to perfection and accompanied by some amazing sauces, all made in house.\n\nStarted off our meal with the steamers. You have a choice between mussels or clams or both. We opted for a mix, but I definitely preferred the clams - they seemed sweeter and more tender in my opinion. However, the white wine broth that accompanied the seafood was divine - I definitely used as dip for the bread at our table.\n\nFor our entrees, my parents and I shared 3 dishes, all were excellent in their own way...but our favorite was definitely the Tortellini Carbonara. The sauce wasn't too creamy and overwhelming, just enough to thoroughly hug each tortellini. There was also a good amount of mushrooms and pancetta accompanying the dish to add notes of flavor and change up the texture as well. \n\nOur second favorite was the lasagne. It was so smooth and served up nice and hot such that the cheese was still all ooey-gooey and stringy - yum! Pasta was not too thick and there was just enough meat and cheese to go around. Quote of the night? \"It's no Stouffer's, that's for sure!\" \n\nAnd last but not least, we had the Gnocchi Gorgonzola. They were like little potato pillows filled with spinach and ricotta. Definitely not doughy and definitely one of the best gnocchi dishes I've had recently in North Beach.\n\nAll in all, meal was delicious. Service was friendly and fun...and the feel was cozy, albeit a little dark inside. I would definitely say that this is one of the better Italian restaurants in North Beach/Little Italy and it doesn't need a promoter outside like some on Columbus Ave!!", "author": "Elaine Y."}

Just like the Italians from the Jersey Shore aren't real representatives of Italians from Italy.) \n\nWe got the Margherita pizza... the most basic, simple Italian pizza ever... and it looked like it came out of Papa Johns (and tasted like it too). Don't get me wrong, it was tasty and I enjoy Papa Johns, but this is a pricier \"Italian\" restaurant, so I expected better quality. No sliced tomatoes - just diced (Chipotle style), no basil leaves - only basil powder!!, and no mozzarella balls, just shredded cheese - not nice shredded cheese either. We also got the cheese ravioli in pesto and garlic sauce. It was tasty but small and not worth $17. Also, the sauce did not taste homemade, but rather, premade.

Also, it's a really cute and fun little place, perfect for lower-level special occasions, more so because the prices are reasonable.  So...GO!  HOWEVER...\n\nI did experience a little blip last night that tarnished my personal feelings about Sodini's.  My sister arrived early and was seated at a postage stamp of a table tucked away in the front window corner.  When you arrive, you normally go through the bar to the dining section.  Seeing Anna tending bar on my way in - a woman who I knew to be a childhood friend of my co-worker, and who previously bought me a drink to celebrate that coincidence - I exchanged pleasantries with her, then proceeded to where my sister was seated.  \n\nI had to completely shoe-horn my way into my seat, and the configuration was such that we were seated at awkward right angles to one another (as opposed to the traditional across-the-table situation).  The problem is, both my sis and I are not small people and the table was meant for a single or at most, two diminutive diners.  Besides there being not much area for plates, I'm 6'2\" and around 220, and my sis is, well, as I said, not small either.  There were very real girth challenges.  I told her immediately that this would not do and we should ask for a different table.  \n\nHappily, Anna happened by - although I'm still not sure why as she was not our server.  Still I took the opportunity to ask if we might be seated elsewhere, and simultaneously mentioned our past connection in hopes it would help smooth things over.  Anna peered around - and there were several empty tables at this somewhat off-period of 6pm on a non-descript Tuesday -- but curiously seemed adverse to the idea of us moving, and instead suggested that my sis and I simply change positions!  I was taken aback a bit by this because two things seemed beyond obvious, (1) my sister would fare even worse in my seat, and (2) we were plainly physically uncomfortable.  Since this was the first time I'd seen my sister in at least three years (she just moved back to the SFBA) and we were celebrating my 60th birthday, I didn't want to bring about an awkward situation or cause an undue problem at this special outing, so I settled in and made due.  The result however was that my back was wrenched the entire evening during and after the meal.  On retrospect I know I should have insisted or taken us to dine elsewhere.\n\nIt wasn't so much that there were tables available, or that Anna knew me by sight, or that I considered myself a friend of the establishment (I normally come in for an Irish coffee with Casey who's served me hundreds of times at the GDL when it was on Powell Street); it was just that most nice restaurants would have immediately recognized there was a problem and insisted that we move elsewhere or be re-accommodated at the very utterance of such a reasonable request so I had to wonder how they'd treat you, an unwitting tourist, or a local first-timer.   Think about it.  I'll be back, but in my thinking, I'm disappointed that Sodini's now feels like less of a congenial and friendly place to visit.  And that's a shame.", "author": "Michael B."}

The dipping sauces equally delicious and compliment the calamari beautifully. I had the chicken parmesan and loved it. The chicken was thin, crispy and delicious. The cheese lightly browned on top with the best red sauce!", "author": "Jasmine C."}

It's Monday, so maybe the regular chef is off from the weekend.  I ordered linguine and meat sauce.  Not that I like linguine with meat sauce, but my only choice in white is a cream sauce.  So, I took a left turn in my selection. \nThe Italian bread is sourdough.  I was not expecting that, but hey, we're in SFO.  So I put some salt and pepper in the side of olive oil, and dipped away the taste.\nWhen my pasta came it looked good.  Oh dear, the linguine was overcooked and not salted in cooking.  The meat sauce was okay.  I put a lot of grated cheese on it to help, but there was no helping the pasta.\nI gave it three stars cuz of the reputation ONLY.

Once she gave us our check that was the last time we saw her, she didn't even pick up our card her sister(another waitress) had to do it for her.

It's a special from time to time, so if it happens to be a special on a night you're here, order it!

I'll explain. I was craving MEAT ravioli. I ordered meat ravioli only to have the waitress suggest I try their mixed ravioli that comes with both cheese and meat ravioli in a meat sauce.

Then I started eating and kept biting into cheese raviolis. I had to ask the waitress where the meat raviolis were hanging out. She then proceeded to take the fork out of my hand and scour around the sauce in my plate to show me there were meat raviolis in my plate. Kinda gross but I'm not that fragile, so I decided to eat the meat ones only. \n\nWhoa! What a surprise. Where's the meat in the meat ravioli?? Since I tasted something other than meat, I decided to open the only other \"meat\" ravioli on the plate. \n\nGuess what I found??? \n\nNooooo, of course not. It wasn't meat!!! \n\nWhat I found was deliciously tasting thanksgiving stuffing! No joke, that's what was inside the \"meat\" ravioli. \n\nSure Taco Bell mixes their beef with fluffers, but I wasn't expecting that from a well reviewed restaurant. \n\nThe waitresse's response....

Just pizza. But the pasta and gnocchi we saw at other tables looked amazing. Will definitely branch out next time!", "author": "Ina T."}

Sodini's is super cute and intimate. The decor is exactly what I imagine a family Italian restaurant to look like - dimly lit and photos covering the walls. However, I just wish that the food was as good as I expected it to be! \n\nWe got the Beef Tortellini Carbonara (white sauce with mushroom and pancetta) and the Gnocchi Nostri (meat sauce). Both dishes were just so-so. I think we expected a lot more out of an Italian restaurant in the heart of Little Italy. Both dishes were just so-so. We both agreed that the first couple of bites were the best. I liked the gnocchi alone, the meat sauce was interesting because it had a grainy consistency. The tortellini was good, but the flavors got too overwhelming and a bit too salty. I think the best part of my meal was probably the house salad..which is surprising because they had them premade - I could tell because my fork was icy cold when I got my dish. The dressing is garlicky and tasty - maybe not great for a date night, but I loved it so much that I asked for extra dressing.", "author": "Britney L."}

I love the cozy, authentic Italian cafe atmosphere, and find that alone, extremely charming and classy- in a settle, non pretentious way. \n\nWe got a nice (somewhat intimate) table a hop scotch away from the window. \n\nFor drinks, we went with a carafe of the house red wine. It turned out to be just ok. \n\nFor our main dishes, I went with the special- which was the salmon with pesto Linguine . It comes with your choice of soup or salad. I went with the soup which was the Minestrone soup. Friend went with a Pesto Tortellini. \n\nThe minestrone soup was hearty, savory and overall fantastic tasting. Far more authentic tasting compared to your standard Italian restaurant. \n\nSalmon and tortellini arrived decent in presentation. My salmon was cooked to perfection however, it significantly lacked in flavor. I ended up having to use the good ol salt shaker quite a bit. The pesto was fresh tasting, though not as creamy as I prefer, not to mention there was certainly not enough to mesh  completely with the pasta. I tried some of my friends tortellini that was also just sub par. I also felt the salmon was way overpriced at $23. buckaroos. \n\nThe service I will say, was very attentive and professional, which certainly was a plus. \n\nOverall, I think this place is incredibly cool as far as the environment goes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-16", "description": "If I could leave zero stars, I would. \n\nPlease consider elsewhere before spending your money at Sodini's. Before even getting the opportunity to sit down and enjoy a meal here, we were made to feel so uncomfortable and disrespected we left. If you don't have time to read, check out Colosseo just right down the road instead. Otherwise, here you go. \n\nMy girlfriend and I were in North Beach looking to get some great Italian when we came upon Sodini's on Green St. The menu looked perfect and it didn't look to busy outside, so we stopped inside to try and get a table. We walked inside and it was fairly lively, but two tables were open and there weren't any signs as to whether we were supposed to seat ourselves or wait for a hostess. After a minute of waiting and a failed attempt at getting the bartender's attention, my girlfriend went over to one of the open tables where a gentleman was cleaning to find out if there was a list we needed to put on, or if we should just sit down.\n\nI remained standing close to the bar, where you first walk in, just in case a waitress or hostess emerged to help seat us. This is when shit hit the fan. A waitress walked over to the line that was beginning to form, grabbed what I presume was the wait list, and if looks could kill, my girlfriend would have dropped dead on the spot. In the most rude and snide voice I've heard from a waitress in a long time, she said out loud (not knowing that who she was talking about was my girlfriend), \"Um, what is she doing? Who is that? She can't do that.\" \n\nI told her, \"She's trying to see how to get a table.\" The waitress chimed again, full volume, \"She needs to get back here. What is she doing.\" When my girlfriend came over, the waitress saidvin an incredibly rude voice (I really can't stress this enough), with her eyebrows arched, \"Um, can I help you?\" We told her, again, we were simply trying to get a table. I'm not sure if she misunderstood me and thought I was trying to rob the place, but as defensive as possible, embarrassing my girlfriend in front of everyone, we were told there was a 20 minute wait, and we'd have to wait our turn. At this time, another waitress came by and told us to \"get out of the way.\" We were literally standing in the only spot you could stand and try and get help. \n\nThat's when I lost it. We were fully prepared for a big night out, on vacation, to get a nice meal, order drinks and tip well. I told the bartender to take us off the list, but that I wanted to personally tell the waitress that it was because of her that we were leaving. What would a normal customer service reaction be in this situation? \"Oh, no, don't leave! I'm so sorry you're upset.\" Nope. Her eyebrows shot up, her face got squished, and she was bewildered we'd want to tell the woman who embarrassed us that we were leaving. \n\nWhen the first girl came back, I told her what happened. I told her that my girlfriend had stepped outside from embarrassment and didn't feel comfortable staying because of how we had just been treated. Suddenly, she was defensive. She very un-genuinely apologetic and said she was \"just confused\" and we shouldn't leave. No, in reality, she didn't realize that when she was talking aloud about my girlfriend getting a table, that she literally said it TO the person she was with. The mean face she shot the random guy waiting in line? Yeah, I was with her. I was very clear --\u00a0you do not talk to customers like that, and that I was dumbfounded in how she had made us feel. \n\nNever in my life have I encountered such a hostel experience trying to get a table. Here's a few tips, as I have too run a kitchen, worked in an Italian restaurant, managed a kitchen, worked as a server and felt the rush that can happen all day every day in a restaurant: \n\n1. Don't talk badly about customers to other customers. You don't know who they may be with. \n\n2. Your face and voice say more than your voice ever will. I won't pretend to remember verbatim how our exchange went, but the gist of it was just plain mean, rude and uncalled for. If you aren't at the door to greet the line of customers waiting for you, and it's too hard to put up a single sign that says \"wait to be seated,\" don't be surprised if - god forbid - someone attempts to figure out how to get a table. Arching your eyebrows, getting a tone and saying, \"Um, what is SHE doing?\" like someone just spit on your shoes is a bit uncalled for. \n\nWe ended up leaving and waking down the street to Colosseo. Absolutely stunning meal. The service, from the second we walked up outside, was nothing but warm and inviting. They started giving us recommendations on the spot. The meal was top notch and everyone from the greeter, to our server, to the gentleman who refilled our drinks was kind, warm and thankful. It was a great experience. \n\nSkip this place. Eat at Colosseo. It's not worth giving your money to a place that disrespects your date before you even have a chance to order.", "author": "Joe W."}

She told every group of people that walked into the restaurant that there was a wait (fair) but told each of them a different time (what's the purpose for that?). Families with kids were told the longest wait (we were quoted 2 hours).  We almost left but sat outside for a minute because 1) there was clearly no line worthy of 2 hours....only one family waited before us and 2) we just had our Uber drop us off and needed to formulate a new plan. The family that waited before us was pretty fed up as they had been waiting 20 minutes and had witnessed lots of different wait times quoted. So they left and let us use their reservation. So we waited another 10 minutes and witnessed the same before and after being sat. Many people that came during our dinner left announcing how rude Anna was to them.

The Caesar salad was really good! The seafood and linguine with white sauce was quite good.....the veal in mushroom sauce was a little tough but doable.....Overall I really enjoyed the place.Old school bathroom you can barely fit in with a door that barely closes and you can see out of urban you gotta love it 100 year old restaurant feel and I loved it!

And in a disappearing San Francisco, I honor & cherish places that revere this history. Hey man Scott Wiener -- if it ain't broke don't fix it. So I returned to a North Beach spot that has been a restaurant I visited back in '95. There's always been a restaurant here on this spot since at least 100 years. I dig the extremely knowledgable & very cool bartender --she is GREAT!! I loved the soup -- they'd make more money if people could order a cup of soup or small salad with the pasta courses, as well as the Secondi meat courses. Not everyone eats meat so why not offer them soup or small salad? if you want to try several dishes, it makes sense to offer a small salad or soup to anyone. If you ask, they'll accommodate but many folks might not ask.", "author": "Scott F."}

We loved the city feel (we're from NYC originally) and the atmosphere was festive in an old world sort of way... The food was reliably good. \n\nNothing fancy here guys... very decent homestyle Northern Italian fare. My daughter had the Chicken a la Sodini, which was basically spaghetti with red gravy, and a chicken cutlet with a creamy, cheesy sauce... she enjoyed it and the preceding house salad, which we all shared. My niece had ravioli with meat sauce and I had lasagna. The lasagna was a bit soupy... but tasty.  We started with Bruscetta, which we enjoyed, but it was on the amateur side for some reason. I know that's an odd thing to say... but that's what I was thinking.\n\nBasically, it was sliced italian bread that was NOT grilled with olive oil and garlic (which is the oops part) but the topping was lovely... so forgivable... and we were starving. Caprese salad we also had was very nice, but needed a bit of salt and pepper or maybe an interesting olive oil. I've seen rave reviews of all of this here... and it's either a case of folks who aren't accustomed to home made Italian or the kitchen was off.\n\nLike i said, we absolutely enjoyed every meal... but it wasn't \"oh, that's yummy!\" if you get my meaning.\n\nThe wait staff was wonderful and really attentive. All in all... just what we needed.\n\nI was kind of surprised that they didn't have anything for after. No espresso, no sweets. Not that we had room for this... but it struck me as odd. It was my first time in North Beach, and I'm sure if we hadn't been so full... and there late on a weeknight, we could have found some italian pastry somewhere on Green Street if we had tried.\n\nI will go again, because I'd really like to try the pizza...", "author": "Rosie S."}

You can use rosemary infused olive oil and balsamic vinegar provided on the table for a dip.\n\nThe food is delicious!!! \n\nAppetizer: Fried calamari with the garlic aioli and cocktail sauce - MmmM.. the calamari was fresh and the lightly coated batter was perfect. Well worth the $15! This is a popular appetizer as most tables ordered it.\n\nMain Entrees:\nSeafood Linguine- Wow! There were clams, shrimp, calamari, and mussels in the dish. The seafood was really fresh, and it was in a light tomato cream sauce. My mom and sister shared this dish, and the chef split the platter into two smaller plates. What a great touch!\n\nTortellini with mushroom and pancetta- MMmMm.. my favorite dish of the night. The cream sauce was rich and so yummy. The mushroom and pancetta gave the dish the earthy and salty flavors. The tortelini was cooked well too. Great dish.\n\nGnocchi in pesto sauce- We called the dumplings \"little pillows\" since they were shaped like that. SO cute! The gnocchi wasn't bad. Not quite as fluffy though. The pesto sauce was pretty thick.\n\nService was okay.

It's that gem of an Italian restaurant that helps you realize that you were a fool to suffer places like Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill for so long, and trust me- once you've eaten food at Sodini's, you'll never look at Olive Garden the same way ever again. \n\nTaste- 9/10\nThe taste is both out of this world and traditional; the chefs at Sodini's seem to have a level of reverence and respect for pasta and sauces that modernized cuisine lacks. \n\nPrice- 7.5/10\nPrices are what you'd expect at every great, non formal Italian place: $10-20\n\nChances are, you've been to a place like Sodini's before.

Seasoned very well and very tasty.\n\nThe House salad was ok, the others that I was with found it to their liking, but I was not to crazy for it. Very garlicky and I like garlic (lots of it) but the dressing did not do it for me.\n\nMy main course was Linguini with meatballs. Delicious! The sauce was great, good consistency and flavorful. The Meatballs were huge and were very flavorful, but I feel that the meatballs could have been cooked a little bit longer. It was pretty mushy. Oh, did I mention that the linguini was cooked perfectly? Anyways..\n\nOthers had the Seafood Linguini which was very good and the sauce that accompanied the seafood linguini was oh so good!\n\nAfter we had finished our meal we ordered a cappuccino. The cappuccino was ver good, but I was hoping that they would have done some sort of design with the foam, but none the less it was delicious.\n\nThe vibe in this restaurant is absolutely great. All of the employees were continually smiling and everyone was happy. The atmosphere is great also!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-19", "description": "As a longtime North Beach / Lower Russian Hill resident, given the number of tourists and general visitors to North Beach on any given evening, there are only a few places that I'll actually have dinner - or take guests to dinner - in the area; Sodini's is one of them, and the typical go-to place.\n\nIt's just enough out of the way that those who'd be lured to the shenanigans on Columbus will miss it, and those that frequent the drinking establishments on Grant will avoid it.  And that's perfect for me\n\nthe vibe:  is pleasant and the lighting sufficiently and appropriately dim to set an intimate mood; it's great for a date, and you'll see plenty of those in the two-tops next to the window, but you'll also see a nice mix of families / Locals and lower-key Tourists and Visitors to the neighborhood.\n\nthe staff:  are great - it's family run, which you note from the good-looking Italian chap occasionally behind the bar - to the very Italian waitresses.  They're friendly and direct - and get the job done.  They've also got excellent memories, so if you frequent it often, you'll get a nod of recognition and be greeted even more warmly. On occasion, if there's a wait, we've been pleasantly surprised by a glass of wine offered up.\n\nthe food:  the menu is solid and the food is good; though given dishes are always better than others, I typically opt for the NY Steak with the calamari starter and have never been disappointed.  Compellingly-priced carafes of the very drinkable house red round out  my meals, though there's a good selection of wine otherwise, should you want to move 'up-market'.\n\nFinally and not insignificantly:  Sodini's is one of the few NB restaurants - the only one that I frequent, actually - that makes you feel welcome long after your dinner is finished, your wine is gone and espresso cups are empty - independent of whether it's a slow, rainy TUE evening, or a perfect SAT night in the city and the wait list is long.  Remember those waitresses?  They'll bring the check as you wrap up, but qualify it by saying, \"Take your time; this is here just so that you can leave when you're ready.\"  And they mean it.\n\nAnd that's why I love it - and continue to go back.", "author": "Blue S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-03", "description": "My friend from the 808 requested a weeknight Italian restaurant choice and this was it (are there any Italian and Mexican restaurants on Oahu?). Reading reviews of Megan D and Natalie I, this seemed like the logical place. Interestingly painted in green (something to do with the national flag?), it certainly isn't difficult to find. When you enter, the bar is on the right and the main dining room (about eight to ten tables) is to the left. Being only a party of two, the hostess was kind and understanding in seating us at a center table for four (we're pretty big guys!). After reviewing the menu and getting our bread basket with olive oil, my eyes wandered about the dining room. Behind me, I noticed a makeshift stage above with ceramic statues of Sammy, Frank, and Dean. Lined across the far left wall were various clippings, posters, and photographs of these three too... see a recurring theme? There was one photo of Tony Manero (aka John Travolta in his white suit). Directly to the rear of the dining room, the kitchen was open with several people busily preparing the meals. It turned out that my visiting friend ate here during his last trip, so the menu was his choice. Here is what we shared: \nAppetizer: \na) Fried Calamari - Thickly coated calamari meat pieces, fried and served with two Marinara and tartar sauce. The calamari meat was of good quality, but my preference is a mixture with the curly (tentacles) parts too. The batter was bland, hence the need for the two sauces. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=pM2_u3npUaXL7u8_i2wKKw) \nEntrees: \nb) Tortellini Carbonara - Cheese filled tortellini dumplings filled with ricotta cheese in a heavy cream sauce with small pancetta cubes and white mushroom slices. Filling and generous portions. As always, love my plentiful mushrooms.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=6lrMV9twcEDcX2EgjY-tXA) \nc) Linguine with Clams, White Sauce - Made with fresh in-shell clams, this is another hearty pasta sauce, using a cream sauce with lemon garnish. Definitely, not for someone looking for a light dinner.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=YW9Zh2TmWt-Cz-yI0qlUbA) \nSide order \nd) Meatballs - Two freshly made meatballs in a savory Marinara sauce. Meatball flavor had a heavy celery (?) or other veggie flavor, but was a good pace change from the above choices (ordered after seeing other tables getting this - see-food diet!). \n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/iZCSLA7clUGpUFzRnZtQkw?select=qtRMgrLpdbW13IbgQc8NTg) \n\nBoth pasta dishes came with a small slice of garlic bread, perfect for sopping up the remaining sauce(s). In my case, I cleaned my meatball sauce. My friend commented that he LOVES their food because they actually use the heavy cream sauces that we remember from the '60's and '70's when \"trans fat\" wasn't even listed in the dictionary; after dinner, I could feel the cream oozing through my veins. Must admit that my taste has changed and my preference to lighter fare these days.  On my next trip here, I would like to try their Minestrone soup and their special that night (Osso Bucco with Linguine). The food rates a solid 3.5 stars, adding 0.5 star for the atmosphere.

Best hospitality I've ever experienced.  I walked in alone, and although it was fully crowded at 7pm on a Monday, the bartender, Ana, immediately found a seat for me at the bar.  She poured me a drink quicker than I could order it, and soon found me a cozier spot at the other end of the bar where I'd have more room to order food.  The waitress who took my order asked for my name, and by the end of the night we were saying our goodbyes as if we'd been friends for years (ok, the wine may have helped haha).  Overall, the best dining experience of my vacation.  Oh, and the Veal Parmigiana was pretty kickass as well.\n\nGreat food, drinks,and people.  I'll definitely be heading back to Sodini's on my next West Coast trip :)", "author": "Jennifer D."}

The food is good, but the atmosphere and service is what really makes the place special. \n\nIt is an old historic building, lots of cool stuff on the walls, and authentically Italian. When you see the bartender you will know what I mean. He looks like someone off the cast of the Soprano's! The staff are all really friendly and you always feel welcomed and at home. Not all places have personality like this place. I wish more would.\n\nThe food is great but 2/3 visits my chicken has been overcooked (hence docking a star). When they cook it right though it is one of the best meals ever.\n\nI always get the chicken parmesan. it is $20 but comes with your choice of either a huge minestrone soup, or salad. The salad is packed with blue cheese, onions, and lots of other goodies. It is a salad that is worth spending $8-12 on its own so the meal cost is really reasonable for San Fran.  The wine is also great. We got a bottle of some type of red, forget the name but the waitress (Blaze was her name!) was really helpful in finding us the perfect wine. She even went out of her way to suggest some other wines to try and wrote them down for us. \n\nOh and they have crayons! I love this! You can draw on the table while you wait for your food! What's even better on my last visit they upgraded them all to Crayola. None of that no name china brand #$%. That surprisingly adds quite a bit to the meal experience. There is nothing better than eating fresh bread and coloring on stuff. Did I mention how good the bread is? Very fresh with olive oil and balsamic to dip.", "author": "Chris S."}

I must say I was fairly shocked. It is hard to find a great restaurant in North Beach, where you are away from the weekend \"rift-raft\" that goes on around that area. \n\nWe sat at the bar and had some of the best service. We were able to meet the owner and got the 5-star experience that any restaurant goer should experience. Had a GREAT drink at the bar, really strong to where I didn't need a second one (Always love that). The waitress Jennifer was amazing and hilarious we really enjoyed her.\nWe ordered the Chicken Marsala and the Salmon, which was the best marsala I have ever had.\n\nLets just say as a AVID COOK, who specializes in Italian cuisine this place is AUTHENTIC. From the owner, to the food, to the environment, its a TRUE ITALIAN PLACE! Which is what you should EXPECT and get when you come to North Beach. All in all, we found our new stomping ground in North Beach. \n\nTotally recommend this place, you will not be disappointed.", "author": "Renee B."}

Food arrived fairly quickly thereafter.\n\nAtmosphere: Seems like a fairly friendly place. At first, it was mostly a casual dining experience where all of us at the table could talk to and hear each other (early in the evening), but the busier it got, the louder it got as well.\n\nFood: All I can say is \"meh.\" We ordered fried calamari to share; they were crispy and not chewy (basically perfect texture), but the seasoning on them was quite bland. Definitely needed some marinara sauce for taste. I had the beef ravioli with meat sauce. The ravioli were quite big with lots of meat. The meat sauce itself was also kind of bland; probably needed a bit more salt or something. I ended up adding some chili flakes on mine to improve the flavor.\n\nOther Comments: The place is kind of small. We were seated at a 4-person table in the middle of the dining area. As the waitresses and bus boys kept walking by, they would pretty consistently (but accidentally) knock into my elbow while I was eating. Try to get seating against a wall if possible.\n\nIf you're desperately looking for an Italian meal, this place will probably be alright for you, but there are definitely tastier places in the area (Sotto Mare just down the street is great if you like seafood).", "author": "Michael S."}

So first, the customer service is outstanding . . . the owner, Mark, is often at the door welcoming customers with open arms and genuine warmth. The food is wonderful as well. You can't go wrong no matter what you order. I love the linguini and the chicken breast, and the sauteed spinach with mushrooms. Everything is so flavorful and tastes authentic. I've had many different items over the years and its outstanding every time (the bread is amazing too). Also, Sodini's is a place where friends gather. You see people that have been going there for years and have become part of the Sodini's family. Its heartwarming, and my friends and I have spent countless hours eating and drinking at the bar, talking to wonderful people that have lived in City forever and have been coming here to eat, drink and be merry for years and years.

He's friendly and handsome, just sayin . It was New Year's Day and we were a party of 5 and were immediately seated. The ambiance is very romantic and family oriented at the same time. Frank Sinatra music is playing in the background. The lighting is dim and the decor is really nice . Feels like you're in someone's home. Also this place is family owned and has been open for over 100 years ! Talk about history! The kitchen is actually the center-end of the room and you can see them cooking there. I ordered tortellini carbonara. The food was fast to come out and wasn't scolding hot which I like . It was so delicious I finished every last bite.

I had the seafood linguini and it was average in terms of taste, presentation, and quality in my opinion. It did however have a generous amount of seafood which was great! I also ordered the house pitcher of wine which was not very good (tasted flat and sour) and ended up sending it back and ordering a bottle of wine. Mind you, I am someone who never ever complains or sends items back at a restaurant, but it was $31 and I couldn't comprehend paying that much for something that I could barley stomach. This is where my experience went from zero to a hundred... Our server, Erin, was fantastic! She took great care of us and made us feel like regulars. She even gave us a tour of the restaurant and showed us all of the history on the walls. Great photos! If you're looking for the ultimate Italian ambiance and vide, this is the place to go. If the owner is working, he'll make you feel right at home and looks like a true Italian straight from Italy. Great experience overall.", "author": "Bobby J."}

This place has the honor of getting my first review, but I'll try to make it as short and simple as I can.\n\n\nTHE PROS:\n\n*The food was good. I custom ordered the Linguini with pink sauce and garlic steak fries. Neither didn't disappoint. Sadly, thats where the pros end and is where all of my two stars are going to. \n\n\nTHE CONS: (This might take a while to explain, so saddle up)\n\n*The service. It took about 40 mins for our food to come out and about half hour to get our checks AFTER we were done with our food. The place was about half full, so not a full house. \n\nWhere to begin... It started off nice, as we were seated and greeted by a lovely lady who began to take our orders shortly after. Before ordering, we specifically told the waitress that we wanted separate checks for our orders. She stated that she would take our orders and divvy it up afterwards, which seemed simple enough. \n\nWhat she failed to mention was that they only allowed one card per table. \n\nBy the time our food arrived and had to pay, we were crunched for time and had to leave. I flagged down another employee (He was working the bar at the time, but gave me the impression that he was the manager) who seemed rather annoyed at the fact that we had three separate cards. I tried to explain to him the situation, but he immediately saw me as an annoyance and quickly proceeded to give me an attitude, saying, and I quote, \"This is why we have ATMs around the corner\". Much confusion ensued as I tried to understand his frustration but *never* have I been so rudely treated by a restaurant employee, let alone the manager. \n\n\nOVERALL:\n\nMy first experience at Sodini's was left feeling sour and maltreated. We were ignored by the staff, and when we finally got some acknowledgement, it backfired. The manager (or whoever he was) was rude, and insisted on starting an argument. I don't plan on returning based off of this experience. \n\nWhat ever happened to \"The customer's always right\"?\n\nSo anyway, unless you have lots of time to spare and have plenty of cash (or have one card per table), come here.", "author": "Ivania A."}

The minestrone soup looked like a thick porridge that not even the three little bears would enjoy let alone touch. It was very thick, tasteless and a bit cold.

It's clear that the staff all cares about the food and drinks they serve; (2) prices are VERY reasonable considering the high quality; (3) like old-style NY Italian restaurants, you don't feel like you have to dress up to eat a good meal. I could go on and on, but here's the skinny: I love love love the Linguine Sodini and garlic cheese bread. The only improvements I'd suggest: I would love it if they'd take reservations. They don't serve desserts but I understand it's simply an issue of not taking away from local cafes, but still, I'd love it if they served desserts!\n\nAlso: the pasta has always been cooked perfectly IMHO; but then again, I hate al dente. ; ) I say, ask the waitress for al dente if it's important to you.", "author": "Diane C."}

It's still owned and run by the Sodini family. \n\nI love the experience from the second I walk through the door!\n\nThe owners greet you right away and be prepared it is packed! I've never been there when it's slow. You may be crammed in a corner with total strangers for a little while, until a table comes available but it's okay because you share a comradery in anticipating the whole dining experience that Sodini's offers. Smashing up against strangers with a stiff cocktail is part of the experience.\n\nThe drinks are stiff and affordable, the calamari melts in your mouth and the pastas are fresh. You can have a full dinner, appetizer and a glass of wine for about $25 -$30 a person.... not bad at all.\n\nThe servers act like they are part of the family and have always been pleasant. I recently had the sodini ravioli and it may be my new favorite, although I can honestly say that I've tried several things on the menu and they have been consistently delicious. \n\nIf you are looking for a utlra nice dining experience, and reservations with prompt seating,  this isn't it.

It was just as amazing as the calamari. We also had a glass of their house red wine, which was good as well. I didn't ask what the house wine was, so I can't offer up that information. The place was very small and you could see into the kitchen. It might have held 50 people for dinner.

It is probably the best lasagna I've ever had.\n\nOne of my few complaints with Sodini's is after a nice, romantic evening in the City - I like to have a little dessert.

The girls I went with decided to split entrees, 1 per 2 people. This was more than enough. The waitress even divided the entrees so that each person got their own dish. She also recommended a lovely pinot noir for us. She was friendly, attentive, but not overbearing. And to top it off, she had an injured wrist but was still fabulous! \nThere was also a pretty nice ambience. It was dimly lit, chatty but not too loud.\nOverall the food was decent. The seafood in my clams and mussels pasta could have been fresher, but it wasn't too bad.\n\nCons:\nThe pasta was overcooked. By overcooked, I mean seriously overcooked, soft and mushy. Enough said.\nOh yeah, and there is no dessert! :( But this can be remedied with a trip to Naia gelato or one of the many dessert places in North Beach.\n\nIt's hard for me to give an Italian restaurant a good rating when the pasta is not al dente, or at least cooked to medium.

I don't know who has been reviewing this place and giving it its four star rating but man is it not a four star place. \n\nFirst off the service is SLOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW.\nI put that many \"W's\" for a reason. Our food took so long that we got served bread twice, our water refilled countless times, and my friend took a dump and none of this happened at the same time. Our food took about an hour to get to us after we ordered it. I work at a restaurant that serves some of the same food and I know for a fact that our food should've been out in 15-20 minutes max.  The place was maybe only 3/4's full so the kitchen should've had no problems getting out orders, but for some reason they did. \n\nSecond, I'm assuming this guy was the owner or a manager but he was extremely LOUD and obnoxious.  I don't know if he was drunk or that is how he normally is but when we were trying to eat and all we heard was this commotion coming from where he was.  \n\nThird the food was very bland.  Ive had frozen raviolis that have tasted better than what I ordered.  My friend ordered the angel hair and wasn't satisfied. We were so unsatisfied that we ended up going to eat food at King of Thai down the street (which I might add tasted a whole lot better and its a chain restaurant!!).\n\nThere was only one positive thing that I took away from my experience at Sodini's and that was walking out the door.

He was sitting by himself and tried to make conversation with us.  After that failed, he turned to his other side and made conversation with that couple all night long.   They were trying to have a romantic evening, but it was ruined.   It took the wait staff 30 minutes or so to realize what was going on, and only then did they attempt to talk him out of leaving his seat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-10", "description": "TRIED AND TRUE SODINI'S WINS AWARD\n\nSODINI'S \n510 Green St., (415) 291-0499 \n\n It is told that, in San Francisco, a restaurant closes every day and every day a new one opens. Why is it then that we have a trattoria in North Beach that has survived and flourished year in and year out, maintaining a reputation reinforced by in the Bay Guardian's Best of the Bay Awards? According to the Guardian Sodini's is the \"Best Old Style Italian Restaurant\" in San Francisco.\n\n I asked Mark Sodini about this one night at his packed restaurant, with people waiting in line out of the door. \"It's the employees,\" he answered, \"Most have been with us for over a decade. We have one girl who is new. She has only been here six years. Our chef, Rufigio, has been cooking here for 12 years.\" Those of us who have enjoyed going to the restaurant for years know beautiful Ana. She runs the full bar and welcomes everyone who steps in the door as if the place was hers. Our server, Rachelle, started working at Sodini's nine years ago as a single woman. Now she is married with three babies. This is a family restaurant in more ways than one. Mark told me that his brother bought the place 16 years ago, and Mark joined him one year later. Not long after, Mark took the establishment over and has run it day in and day out, 360 days a year.\n\n   In addition to his staff, Mark attributes his success (he has never advertised) to Old World Italian food, with many of the recipes being his grandmother's. He supplements the neighborhood feel of his place with products from North Beach:  pasta strips for lasagna from Molinari's and crusty bread from the Italian French Bakery. The restaurant draws eighty percent of its customers from the neighborhood. \n\n The walls are covered in memorabilia and art. There's a painting of the old Green Valley Restaurant that Sodini's replaced, a mural that positions the viewer to look from the restaurant down Green Street, and another one, executed by a former waitress, that shows Mark's brother kissing his wife, amid grape vines. \n\n  As for the food, if there was a prize in North Beach for the best house salad, Sodini's would win hands down. The fresh romaine lettuce is supported by, black olives, onion, tomato, cucumber, garbanzo beans, croutons and mushrooms. However, it is the house made dressing, made of blue cheese, olive oil, garlic and lemon that makes the salad. The fried calamari appetizer is not your generic North Beach fried calamari. Sodini's only serves the rings, which are lightly battered and lightly fried, leaving the calamari extremely tender. This delicacy is accompanied by spicy aioli sauce. \n \n The restaurant's signature pasta dish is Tortellini Carbonara. This beef filled tortellini ring has a light cream Alfredo Sauce made with mushrooms and pancetta. The tortellinis melt in your mouth and the sauce is light. Biting into a piece of pancetta brings this otherwise mild dish to life. Lamb lovers will enjoy the rack of lamb, infused with butter, grilled to perfection and served with a generous portion of linguine pesto. My favorite vegetable at Sodini's is the saut\u00e9ed spinach, with mushrooms. It is fresh, tender and not greasy or overcooked. Try it with a little hand-grated parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.\n\n So one night when you are wondering where to eat, saunter over to Sodini's. You will be treated wonderfully, leave with a belly full of good food and feel like you have just been to an Italian family's home for dinner. Just remember their motto: No decaf. No reservations. No dessert. No exceptions.", "author": "Carol P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-02-28", "description": "The trouble with eating good Italian food is that five or six days later you're hungry again.* The trouble with eating Sodini's food is that it sucks. \n\nRule one of dating, and most of life: in the first five minutes people will tell you what they're about, you just have to listen. Same deal for restaurants. Unfortunately, I didn't listen. Twice. \n\nFirst ignored clue - Sodini's  large sign which proudly proclaims  \"No dessert, no decaf, no reservations, no exceptions.\"  Lesson learned: when a restaurant claims they take pride in soup-nazi level service, you should assume that's exactly what they provide.\n\nSecond clue ignored - our treatment when we walked in on the Sunday of a three day weekend. The place was crowded and there was a  wait list. That part was fine. Less fine were the  bar and wait staffs' heroic efforts to ignore newly arrived customers. No \"welcome to Sodin's.\" No \"The wait is 30 minutes. Would you like to leave your name?\"  We did eventually get our names taken but between the slow moving line and the lack of staff interest we decided to take our business elsewhere. And we virtually never leave restaurants. Lesson learned: when a restaurant annoys you enough that you leave, don't give them a second chance.\n\nWe went back the next week, it wasn't crowded and we were seated promptly. Service this time was pleasant and efficient. For two large portions of too soft, pre-boiled pasta, and calamari that looked and smelled good but was devoid of any flavor and two glasses of wine we paid, with tip,  $75. \n\nOn the plus side, the atmosphere is good if you like old school Italian movies  - dim lights, dark wood, red booths, candles and Sinatra memorabilia. Also, people who dislike eating at shopping mall international food courts because the flavors are too complex, subtle and exotic may find comfort in Sodini's bland and familiar offerings. Others are advised to steer clear. \n\nI realize this review may come across as harsh, and I'd like to make it up to Sodini's by offering this slogan, to be placed on their sign, as a gift:  \"Sodini's - we're so gourmet you can leave your tray on the table.\" \n\n \nRatings:\nService: ** (average of a four star and a zero star experience)\nFood: **\nAtmosphere: *** \nValue: ** \n\n\n\n\n*George Miller", "author": "Bill S."}

The Gnocchis are unlike any I have ever had.  They are filled with a green pesto sauce.  I call them Tiny Pillows of heaven!  They are super fluffy, moist and delicious!  I literally order them any chance I get.  They also make amazing Pastas, Pizzas and Steaks.  You cannot go wrong with anything you order on their menu.  They don't serve dessert which is posted right outside their facility...so don't complain as there are tons of dessert places you can catch within the same area.

My server (Vanessa - the greatest) was attentive with getting me a drink and bread.  She was so warm and friendly while being quick and rushing between inside and outside tables.  Wanting old school I went with the 1/2 beef, 1/2 cheese ravioli with marinara.  Unlike what someone else said I felt that it was fresh and tasty and it was the perfect portion for lunch.  I enjoyed the old school feel and the Sinatra music playing in the background.  After lunch, Vanessa suggested I have another drink and left me the bread to nosh on, which was great.

Sortini's prepares it with lots and lots of clams delicately placed onto your plate. The best ones are still the one in the shell but there are still pieces of clam all over your pasta. Sweet and salty in all the right amounts. The cream is a little heavy though so bring your appetite.\n\nI did find the chicken parmesan good, but not as delectable as one would like it to be. I would like the chicken to be a little less dry.\nTheir olive oil also goes very well with their bread.

We'll chat up the staff, folks like Anna or Blaize, and often sit at the bar to eat.\n\n2)  Their calamari is one of my faves... and it seems to end up on our bill more often than not.\n\n3)  Their pizza is one of the best in the 'hood, especially the Di Lucca style.\n\n4)  I've seen the staff bashed once or twice on Yelp, but we've had nothing but great service and what seems like genuine efforts to learn our names and remember us when we come back in.\n\nSolid all the way through.

After reading all the Yelp reviews, I came to realize this place is quite a San Francisco landmark, which made me even more excited to check it out. \n\nThe verdict? Eh... I thought the food was fine but nothing to write home about. On the plus side, the service was great, but I plan on checking out a lot of other North Beach spots before coming back to this one. I got the Tortellini Carbonara after seeing it mentioned a lot in the reviews. It was a little heavier than I had hoped. My friend Chrissy got the Angel Hair dish which was lighter but not flavorful enough for me. Bottom line, just an average North Beach experience in my book.

Gnocchi pesto was my dish of choice.  Pesto is usually so fragrant and in your face flavorful, but I could barely tell I was eating pesto aside from the green color.  I wanted to love it, because the little gnocchi pillows were cute and had been promised to be amazing/imported from italy/etc.  I sprinkled black pepper, red pepper, but nothing could make the dish interesting to me.  It is hearty, so it's good for satisfying your hunger.  That's my only positive takeaway from the food.

Sodini's could quite possibly be my new most favorite restaurant.\n\nI went there last night with my husband and a friend. It was a Friday night and we showed up around 9:30 pm. While we waited half an hour for our table, we decided to help ourselves to a little pre-dinner cocktail. I order a dirty kettle martini. The martini was yum, although maybe not as dirty as I like it. \n\nWhile we waited and enjoyed our drinks I also took the time to take in the decor. The bar as well as the restaurant were completely covered in Sinatra and other old Italian memorabilia. The atmosphere was homey, very \"lived-in\" and welcoming. \n\nMy husband ordered the Veg Pizza, I was delicious and very fresh. My friend ordered the steak with a side of veggies which came with a salad or soup. She choose the soup which was, we both agreed, quite possibly the hardiest best testing minestrone we've ever had. If you think you know Minestrone, you got to try Sodini's. I got the Angel Hair Pasta in a Marinara sauce (vegetarian) which was also quite good and fresh tasting. We also shared a serving of the Bruschetta. Very heavy on the garlic with fresh tomatoes. It was absolutely to die for. \n\nEverything about the place, from the walls and pictures of Sinatra down to the candle lite ambiance, were very inviting, homely and genuine Italian.\n\nThis little restaurant is quite a gem. I have to say I usually try to avoid so called Italian restaurants. Something about overcooked pasta and gnarly processed sauces that just don't appeal to me. This place is different, it's got love. It's got character.", "author": "Carla P."}

A place of romance, warmth, trust and love. I've only been here with one person and that's the way it will remain.  \nNo matter how rushed for time we may have been, no matter how cold or rainy it was, no matter how over crowded it may have seemed, we always made time for it.  In fact, we made it a high priority when we'd drive in from the S Bay. With its white paper tablecloths, candles in chianti bottles, friendly and never pretentious service and the occasional hint of a thick Italian accent form someone two tables down, it lured us back, time after time.\n\nNow the food - We always started with a bottle of wine, red or white, we cared not. Some bread dipped in balsamic and cheese with a sprinkle of chilies and we were off. The house salad with its beans and creamy pesto is one of the simplest I've had in any restaurant, in any city. But its flavors commanded your taste buds to stand at attention, as if to say, get ready, the best is yet to come. \nEntrees are always straightforward family style Italian. From the chicken and eggplant parmigiana, or the rack of lamb, to many variations of pastas and lasagna, you can't go wrong. I'm not saying its Italian cuisine at it's best, I'm saying it's old world Italian done best. No deserts served but I always got something back in the hotel room.\n\nNo matter where we sat, the bar, the back room table for two or the main room, it's ambiance is typically that of a bee hive, Buzzzz, Buzzzzz, Buzzzzz! If it had been in San Jose, I don't think we would ever consider it.  It's not always the ambiance that matters but the company you keep.\n\nWhen we eat here, we left all other troubles outside. We were great friends and lovers, and we held hand. She would draw a heart on the paper table covering to tell me she loved me.

My initial experience here was unremarkable, and how that opportunity came about allowed me to get a good deal of exposure to the place.  I had gone in here with my girlfriend and a friend of ours to get a bottle of wine and hang out.  This was early on a Saturday, around 4:00 or so.  We were overcharged for the wine, and hassled by the bartender because we had recently eaten elsewhere and weren't interested in appetizers, etc.\n\nSeveral hours later the three of us returned plus our friend's date, as we had noticed that the food smelled good during our bar stint.  The experience was very bland and a rip-off to boot (llama taboot taboot).  We got suckered.\n\nIn the end, I found the $27 bottle of Behringer Merlot we bought offered at Trader Joes for $8, and am now submitting this post.

The food is excellent.  Period.  This is old-school homestyle Italian food as you would expect old-school homestyle Italian food to be:  Hearty, heavy, and heavenly...  \n\n2.  It's as if the throngs of tourists visiting SF haven't found out about this place.  Yet.  The clientele is comprised primarily of locals, and when I say \"locals\", I mean the people who actually live in North Beach.  It has that home-y vibe that you simply can't force or fake.  The staff and the patrons compliment each other perfectly.  Everyone knows everyone here.  The waitresses trade sassy barbs with each other and customers equally, all of it wrapped in that wink-wink-arm-squeeze of good-naturedness you haven't seen or felt since your last family reunion.  \n\n3.  Most importantly, there, at the center of it all, is Ana.  She runs the bar and oversees everything with a style, grace and charm that is equal parts big-city-street-smarts and hometown-girl-next-door sweetness.  She is the one who greets you when you enter through the (usually packed) bar, most often calling out to you over the heads of the lively and boistrous bar patrons with a winning smile and a warm and friendly demeanor that immediately makes you feel as if you've known each other for years and she's sooooo damn happy to see you again, even if it's your first time walking in the door...  And I guarantee it won't be your last.\n\nIf you want upscale, expensive, high-end stuffiness, there's always the French Laundry.\n\nIf you want to feel like you've come home after a long time away from your closest friends and family, there's always Sodini's Green Valley.", "author": "Eduardo W."}

Picked this place based on the yelp reviews, as figured it would help me navigate the minefield that can be touristy stodgy north beach Italian restaurants.\n\nIt is a cute place, but then again, most of the restaurants in North Beach are.  We got a table straight away, but it was pretty full.  I have to make a special mention of the staff here, they were all super friendly, down-to-earth, helpful and great.\n\nThe food was OK.  The bread they give you is ordinary at best, but their olive oil is pretty yummy.  Ordered some garlic bread and caprese salad appetizers-they were fairly awful.  The mozzarella on the salad was like a brick- or make that mini bricks as it came in those rounds between the tomatoes.  The garlic cheese bread was made on the same gross bread they put on the table when you sit down.  It was pretty gross and not like  a beloved classic garlic bread at all.  All of us ordered gnocchi for our main course.  The gnocchi was actually really yummy-stuffed with spinach and cheese and fluffy.  I got just a plain tomato sauce on top of it, which was super fresh and flavorful.  The boys got a meaty creamy looking sauce that was pretty funky looking, not in a good way.  The portions were decent but not stuff-you crazy big, which is a plus for me.  \n\nI would go back for gnocchi if I was in the area but I wouldn't trek across town for the restaurant, and I'd be wary of ordering other stuff on the menu, based on what I saw around me on other tables.\n\nNorth beach dining has yet to convince me, I'm\"m still thinking it's all  mostly a tourist trap.", "author": "Carlin S."}

I did not know there was more to the name, so if you prefer to be formal, it is Sodini's Green Valley Restaurant.\n\nAbout a week ago, I was with two of my wine-drinking, glamourous, career-executive type female friends, Christine and Blair. As these girls know good wines and great food, I need to make great suggestions. \n\nWhen the pirate bar was closed for a private party, I had to think fast and Sodini's came to mind. Christine and I have burned through most of the typical North Beach restaurants and we avoid certain ones to avoid a crazy car, a crazy waiter, a bad menu, or all of the above. I had never been before, but I knew it would be a wonderful experience for all of us.\n\nUpon arrival on a Tuesday, the wait was about ten minutes. We ordered a bottle of wine for maybe $30.00, which tasted more like $50.00. My friends had a cigarette and when they returned, we were seated at a cozy table. The place was full, but we were still able to chat without hearing everyone else's business.\n\nOur waitress and the person behind the bar were wonderful, they were friendly, full of personality, and great servers. In terms of food, we ordered appetizers, calamari and garlic bread. Then, my friend ordered a seafood pasta and I ordered there special angel hair pasta, which was the cheapest on the menu, but exactly what I wanted. My other friend ordered a salad, which she enjoyed. During dinner, we ordered another bottle of wine and our waitress brought over a complimentary order of garlic bread, she knew we would eat it.\n\nBy the end of the evening, we were all full and satisfied. Then, the night got better when my song came on, it goes, \"hey mambo, mambo italiano, hey mambo....\" Then, when I went to the restroom, my friend requested the song again for me and it made me extra happy.\n\nI thought the prices were reasonable. It was about $120.00 for two bottles of wine, two appetizers, three main courses, and a side dish, plus tax and a huge tip. \n\nI highly suggest going to this place if you love home-cooked Italian food. If you are local and don't know this place, you need to go. If you are from out of town and want to find a charming spot, this is the place to go.", "author": "Christopher W."}

It was not the same, so much so I asked the waitress if there had been an ownership change.  The answer was no.  In any case, they were severely understaffed.  It took 45 minutes to be served and we had been seated immediately...  We shared an appetizer of Bruschetta which was OK, but we'd gone through a couple of small loaves of bread while waiting as we were hungry.\nThe entrees finally arrived, we had each ordered the Fetuccini,  with meat for him and seafood for me.  While my seafood was OK, the sauce was nothing special but at least the pasta was cooked well.   I felt so sorry for my companion as his pasta was severely overcooked.  It wasn't even the Fetucinni on the menu but a severely overcooked slimy spaghetti.  Something left over from another order?  I tasted it and we agreed it was awful!  It  was reminiscent of something from a cafeteria!  Slimy pasta and a tasteless sauce!  I felt awful as I had recommended this place...  I suggested reordering but he didn't want to wait another 45 min.\nOn another note, do not order the wines by the glass!  To be fair, I've never ordered wine by the glass  here, always a bottle.  This time my guest did not drink so I was on my own.  I ordered both the Cabernet and Chianti by the glass and they were the worst ever.  The waitress did bring me another glass which was nice, but I goggled the wine and a bottle of Esser Cab retails at $8 the same as a glass there! What do you suppose the bulk price was? \nPerhaps it was an off night, but I fell terrible.

Our quest was to get off of Columbus and it's overrated, tourist filled eateries and find somewhere with a combination of words such as \"venerable,\" \"old-school,\" \"authentic,\" and, of course, \"delicious.\" \n\nThe place was lively and had a great vibe on a Saturday night. The patrons are eclectic and the outside tables are a great place to people watch. (If you're not a frat boy, you might want to avoid the clubs across the street.) The service was great and the food was generally delicious. The Caesar was crisp had lots of real anchovies on it, and though the minestrone was different than I'm used to, (less chunky and with a bit of cream,) it was delightful. My chicken Marsala was of the best I've had, but the side of pasta only had a bit of Bolognese over it. (What good is perfectly cooked pasta if you don't get enough sauce for it!?) The gnocci was super fluffy and the pesto was delicious and generous, albeit borderline too-salty for me. The only other complaint I have is that the heaters could not be adjusted. The weather barely warranted them and being on the fair side, I've been 'sunburned' by those things before.\n\nThe bathroom photo made me giggle: the usually well composed, gracious and fabulous all around Sophia Loren sideways glancing, half snidely checking Jayne Mansfield's inappropriate cleave. My date had a similar reaction in the men's room to a rat packish photo of Dean Martin and co., with Frank Sinatra looking particularly cranked off his gourd. I applaud the tongue in cheek humor evident in the selection of these snaps.\n\nI'm being a bit generous and tipping the last star forward, concentrating on the overall experience rather than the foibles with food.", "author": "Nomi G."}

Calamari, salad, a couple of pizzas, a couple of different gnocchi dishes, a chicken dish and several jugs of house wine to wash it all down.  Everything was really good.  I'm not usually a fan of gnocchi but I really liked the gnocchi here, especially the one with the Gorgonzola cream sauce.  I even liked my least favorite thing on the table, the chicken dish, I just liked everything else even more.  Our waitress was big and brassy and seemed like she might be a bit surly but any concerns quickly disappeared because she was super friendly and gave us great service.  One of the owners was bartending and I swear he looked like he had just walked off the set of Goodfellas but he couldn't have been a more gracious host.

Unfortunately, Sodini's was not the place.\n\nThe food was good, but not great. I enjoyed the calamari, but the penne pesto was just so-so. The penne was overcooked and watery. The sauce was good, not great. Rather than having the penne added to the pan with the sauce, the sauce was poured over the pasta.  This meant there was way too much sauce and the pasta was not well coated.  Also, because of the watery-ness of the pasta, the sauce did not stick.  It seems a small thing, but it is the small things that make a difference between good and extraordinary food.   My partner had the linguine with cream sauce, which was kind of bland.\n\nThe service could have been better. The waitress put the plates down and fled without asking if we wanted anything else. We did: fresh ground pepper and Parmesan cheese. After waiting a bit, we called over the manager (owner?) because he was standing nearby. He quickly got us some pepper, but also pointed out the jar of dry grated cheese on the table. I guess for Italian food in this price range I expect fresh grated or shaved Parmesan.  It has a pungency and moistness that can't be found in the Kraft canned style cheese they had on the table.  To perhaps excuse the waitress a bit, she was otherwise fine, and she was very busy.\n\nPluses:  the atmosphere was fun and they have Italian beer on draft.  The place has a fun atmosphere and is not touristy.  It seems to be a local's favorite - it was recommended by a tender in a nearby bar.   But basically, the food was good, but not special, and there are a lot of other places nearby to try, so I don't think we will hurry back.", "author": "Vernon M."}

We scour Yelp for something new and come up with Sodini's. I've been in town for a while and have tasted my share of North Beach's Italian fare. Let's get to it. Sodini's gives you exactly what you pay for; good food at a moderate price. The calamari is bomb (ask for a side of marinara). The lady had shrimp and mussels over linguini, I had chicken marsala. Our entrees were very tasty. Not out of this world, yet really satisfying. Decent portions and solid service. Minus the slightly hooky Sinatra and Godfather get up and this place is well worth your time and your money. In a typical North Beach fashion you get exactly what you pay for.", "author": "Daniel C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-07-13", "description": "We got this place recommended by a friend. I checked Yelp: 4 stars. Let's give it a shot. As soon as I saw the menu I had second thoughts but all 7 of us were seated. I didn't feel like causing a stink. However the stink was caused by someone else. The kitchen. The clams and mussels to be precise. 1 star at best. We ordered salad, calamari, gnocchi, pasta and pizza. I felt terrible leaving plates where we had hardly touched the food but it wasn't just average - it didn't taste good. We left hungry, paid the $300(!) bill and got gelato down the street. I do realize that I may come off as a snob in this review but I can assure you that living in SF simply offers plenty of opportunities to eat FANTASTIC food, sometimes even at a pretty affordable price. However Sodini's offers neither. To top it all off the service was close to non-existent, which to me is secondary to the food but it's worth mentioning. This is a generous 2 star review of a restaurant that has proven that SF can still use plenty more competition in the restaurant business. Never again.", "author": "Jonas O."}

Also, once a table was vacated, there was rarely anyone immediately available to clear the table & set-it.  10 minutes to clear & set a table when there's an hour wait to sit down?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-07-06", "description": "To me, Italian restaurants are supposed to have a familiar and welcoming atmosphere, usually pretty loud from people talking or maybe because of people playing instruments. I usually can't associate fancy places with Italian restaurants, to me it just doesn't happen. So I decided to check this place out when I read in Yelp that this is a true Italian restaurant with authentic food. \n\nIndeed, the environment is as authentic as it can be. Low lights, small crowded place with cheerful waitresses and hostess. My husband and I were meeting two other friends there for dinner this last Saturday, hoping that we could go after dinner check out the 4th of July fireworks in Marina. To make that happen, my friends arrived in the restaurant a little before 7pm. We only made it at 8pm, but we didn't get sit before 8:30pm anyways, so that was a 1,5hs waiting. If I was the one waiting there I am sure it would have made my experience a lot different... but anyways, the bartender was pretty nice to my friend, offering her a garlic bread that was very tasteful.\n\nWhen we got to our table, the service was very efficient and fast even though the restaurant was very crowded. And again, our waitress was all smiles. We ordered the clams and mussels for appetizer and we shared it amongst 3 people. It was delicious with the garlic bread that they brought to the table once again. We also ordered polenta, but I thought it was plain. \n\nFor the appetizer I was pretty set on fusili, but there weren't many appealing sauces to me. I am a red sauce person with tomato chunks and other chunky stuff to go with it, but it just didn't exist in the menu. You would think italian food can be very versatile, allowing you to mix and match different sauces to pastas, but it wasn't the case at this restaurant. So I ended up choosing the white creamy sauce fusili with prawns. My first disappointment was that the pasta wasn't home made (at least didn't taste anything special) and the sauce was pretty plain and tasteless.\n\nEven though I wasn't very excited about my dish, I would give this restaurant another try for a couple of reasons: everybody there is pretty friendly and they do a good job in creating an italian atmosphere in the restaurant, I am curious to try their pesto nhoqui, their house wine is pretty good and I didn't have to wait 90 minutes to get a table at my first time! ;)", "author": "Camila E."}

This establishment  is an authentic gem, snuggled right in the heart of North Beach.

Once you're in her charming presence, you will feel as though you've found the magic key which unlocks all things fun and legendary about San Francisco. Relax yourself on a seat at the beautiful wood bar, and before you know it, she has set you up with a lovely libation of your choice, and somehow has already introduced you to some the North Beach locals that consider this place a favorite. Ana has the rare gift of being professional, beautiful, entertaining, and capable of mixing you the best damn drink anywhere in town. It's miraculous just watching her do it all with such style and grace. Plus, she's a North Beach native! R-E-S-P-E-C-T!\n\nI love the sense of comfortable familiarity this place gives me, while at the same time; I always enjoy meeting the interesting newcomers this place seems to attract. Individuals and families from across the globe find their way to this spot, bringing with them a feeling of freshness that compliments the intimate atmosphere here. Sodini's is the perfect spot for a romantic date, and yet it simultaneously is completely great for a friendly get-together. \n\nThere's a reason that people always come back to Sodini's: because it hits the perfect cord every time. The menu is traditional, and deeply satisfying. This is exactly what you're looking for, whether you know it yet, or not. Once you give it a try, you'll see what I mean. \n\nThe staff will very competently make sure you are well taken care of, and the tone of the service is very genuine without being overly solicitous. In other words, they are not annoying drones. You will find their style very refreshing, because they know their stuff, and they do it right. After returning a few times, you'll find yourself on a first name basis with them. Familiar faces- that's the best! Plus, Mark Sodini is THE quintessential proprietor.\n\nThis is not an Olive Garden type of place. Instead, you'll experience the satisfaction of discovering what the genuine, old-school North Beach is truly all about! \n\nAfterwards, it's fabulous to stroll around the neighborhood streets, taking in the gorgeous architecture, Washington Square Park, or the cafes and gelaterias, which stay open late.

It really feels like you're eating in someone's living room, which I like. Seems like other people think this place is special too, because it gets crowded quickly. If it happens to be crowded and cramped on a Friday or Saturday night, just be patient.

The food is decent but nothing stellar for this city. Crappy free bread brought to the table, which always annoys me in Italian places- I feel like that's a pre-requisite and sets the stage for the rest of the meal. Other bells and whistles that you'd expect at most good places, like offering fresh ground pepper and fresh parmesean aren't here either, but the food isn't bad, it just lacks a little umph.", "author": "Kristen L."}

This is the most authentic neighborhood local Italian place San Francisco has to offer. It has an attentive wait staff that always are willing to chat and be cool, but not over due it, the cast of characters are always as diverse as the city we live in, and the best thing about Sodinis is the unpretensious feel as you walk in. Anna, the neighborhood queen and icon is the most nonfamous famous person, and always has a welcoming smile on her face as you enter, no matter how busy it is, and believe me, this joint gets HELLA busy! As for the food, i almost forgot it was a restaurant I was writing about, I'd go for the Pesto gnocchi, with some polenta to start out with! Bruschetta is a good starter, and the Calamari is good, but deep fried, however, the best prt of the restaurant is that they keep it simple, easy, and fun, something that seems is a thing of the past with all these high end L.A. type restaurants popping up all over the place. Sodinis is a San Francisco throwback that reminds one of how the city once was, and though as you leave it feels like a party that you don't want to depart because it is such a good party, you do leave with a smile on your face and extra memories to look back on and cherish! \nI HELLA recommend Sodinis!!", "author": "John A."}

As such, I now go early or late to avoid the wait.", "author": "Moe J."}

The first time the waitress suggested the red sauce, and it was the MOST delicious dish I have had in years. The second time I tried the pesto sauce and it left me flat, so I mentioned to her how much I liked the other sauce, and while they didn't make up that special sauce for me, they gave me a meat sauce instead, which was decent. But the gnocchi with red sauce was so memorable. My companion liked his meals both times as well. The bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar was also great. We enjoyed the atmosphere and recommend the restaurant highly.", "author": "Oregon C."}

The penne al forno was pretty good though, if a little heavy on the cheese and the linguini marinara was good too. Service was friendly and prompt although we felt a little harried as they started cleaning up around us before 10pm (on a Sunday).", "author": "Stuart J."}

It's dimly lit and romantic, but the staff is all personality and do a good job of breaking the quiet and cozy ice. They were packed late on a Saturday night, so we took a spot at the bar.  The house red ($5) was smooth and drinkable, and we split an order of the North Beach angel hair (pasta with a sun dried tomato, green onion, marinara, about $13), which was simple and tasty. They split the pasta without our asking (very nice!), and brought a generous bread basket and some nice olive oil to start us off. A great value and delicious ambiance.", "author": "Rachelle A."}

My ravioli were just okay. My other friends salmon was also a good entree, cooked to perfection and lightly seasoned, very fresh tasting but her pasta was overcooked and it was drenched in green pesto, a little too much sauce for my liking. The bread was fabulous and service was friendly.", "author": "Lorraine B."}

I went there last Friday when I had a relative from out of town visiting. They don't take reservations so I called ahead of time and was told to come on over. It's a good thing we did because right after we stepped through the door, a line was forming behind us. We got seated right away and I ordered a martini which was nice and strong! The waitresses were very friendly and did apologize for our entrees taking some time due to them being slammed. I didn't mind because every time I ordered a drink, it arrived immediately. We shared the minestrone soup- great taste and hearty. My cousin ordered the pasta with clams which was a nice white sauce that was flavorful without being too creamy or heavy and the clams were gooood. I ordered the Chicken Alla Sodini which was grilled chicken with ham and mozzarella on top. The chicken was grilled perfectly and very moist, also full of flavor. We licked our plates clean.

My first major concern was the drunken amorous couple who were taking up my space on the bench side of the table; I was anticipating a long night of discomfort until the manager came over and told them, as far as we can tell, to get a freaking room. They were doggy-bagged and out in five minutes. A manager who actually manages, and me not having to deal with someone else's PDA in my lap, might bump it up to five stars for me.\n\nBut the food takes it back down to four. The salmon special indeed had special salmon - tender enough to melt in your mouth - but the side linguine drowned in a sea of so-so pesto. The gnocchi in pink sauce was, well, gnocchi.\n\nGoing back to the service, someone in our group had ordered a sauvignon and when she was brought the red when she'd wanted the white, the waitress immediately apologized (even though it wasn't her fault). Also, the fam said the manager had come by with parking suggestions when he noticed our empty chairs.

Its crowded in the front with people waiting to be seated and the occasional couple/group to put their name on the list. Dont stand waiting to be approached, they'll just think you are waiting for your name to be called ( on the busy nights that is). Its a small and busy restaurant and you gotta work with them.

The menu features abotu 10 antipasti including gooey and delicious cheese bread and steamers (you can choose clams or mussels) cooked in a white wine broth and served with garlic bread, as well as lots of varieties of pastas with various sauces, meat entrees including a gorgeous Pepper Steak and Chicken Alla Sodini (grilled chicken topped with ham, mozzarella and cream sauce served with linguine alla casa), and lots of pizza options. The wine list is fairly short but certainly covers all the bases. I had a Sauvignon Blanc from Napa which was crisp and tasty. Others had the same as well as a delicious and velvety Valpolicella. We started with the Bruscetta, which is six large and nicely toasted pieces of bread covered with heaping portions of diced tomatoes mixed with garlic, basil and olive oil. The garlic flavor was quite strong but everyone enjoyed the start to the meal. Per usual, I had the Chicken Caesar Salad for my entree. It's probably enough for 2 to 3 hungry folks. Heaps of crisp romaine lettuce are topped with a generous amount of Parmesan cheese and large, moist chunks of grilled chicken breast. The dressing is delicious and I enjoy that there are anchovies in the dressing as it adds that distinct rich and nutty flavor without having the filets directly in the dish. Others had the special of the day, which was Grilled Prawns with Linguini in a pesto sauce, and Tortellini Con Pesto, or beef-filled tortellini in a creamy basil and garlic sauce. The rich, verdant green in the sauces was appealing and the flavors were all delicious. There wasn't much beef in the tortellini but the creamy cheese inside was flavorful and even a bit piquant.

It had so many different parts - crunchy edge, soft and warm center, lovely sauce and chewy noodle. The spaghetti with marina was not that great - I didn't like the sauce. It had way too much dried oregano. The house salad is huge and lovely.  Want to go back and try the North Beach Style marina and the two vegetarian penne dishes. The pizza's also look great. Service was great and the atmosphere is comfortable. Get a glass of wine and enjoy.", "author": "Sarah J."}

My test for any Itlaian place is Veal Parm. If they can't get it right, then you can forget about everything else. Like most places in North Beach, this fails. The veal parm is not even breaded. How can you have a veal parm that is not breaded!", "author": "mark s."}

I love the lasagna and the wine is always good.  Love to take friends there or just eat there during the week with my girlfriend.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes italian food.  The only but, is that they only seat full parties, so make sure everyone is there when you arrive.", "author": "Your E."}

No problem.  About 10 minutes later 2 men walked in and were seated immediately.  I asked if we should have made reservations and was told \"no\".  So we asked why we had to wait.  The response was, \"well we only have tables for 2 available\" (2 right next to each other by the way).  There was also a table for 6, but apparently only 6 people could sit there.  \nAs we had to be somewhere by 8p.m., we decided to leave.  As we were leaving the \"gentleman\" kind of let out an exasperated noise.  I turned to him and said \"you know, 2 tables for 2 pushed together equals a table for 4.\"  His response was, \"well I guess we could do it that way, but that's not how we operate here.\"  Three empty tables in the place, but we had to wait - it doesn't make sense to me.  \nI couldn't tell you about the food, but no matter how good it is, served with that kind of attitude, it's hard to choke down.", "author": "Linda R."}

You can take a date to this restaurant or go with some friends. The service is very friendly. I highly recommend the polenta appetizer...it reminded me of how my grandma used to cook it. Great for locals, great to take visitors to SF!", "author": "R R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-01-09", "description": "Ate for the second time at Sodini's.  The food is just acceptable, but certainly no better than average and all of it is a cliche of what Americans think is Italian cuisine (I lived in Italy for several months, so I do know a bit about it).  The bread they brought was stale.  The salads were good with fresh lettuces, olives, beans, red onion, croutons (but hey, this is CA where anyplace can make a good salad, and BTW you won't find such salads in Italy).  The chicken Sodini was overcooked, nearly tasteless, and came with a side of linguine marinara that was very bland except for the sharp, bitter flavor from (probably burned) tomatoes.  My friend had chicken parmigiana, which was equally bland, sharp, and bitter There were several wines by the glass both red and white, but all of them were marginal.  At least the server offered tastes, so you could pick the best among a set of sorry choices. The service was friendly, but efficient--they didn't spend much time chatting.  All in all, not a place I'd recommend.  Wish we'd gone elsewhere.", "author": "Greg W."}

We checked off a few of the more prominent places in a sense of adventure and the desire to find something a little different, and a quick check of yelp via mobile phone led us to Sodini's. The glowing reviews of this place told us this place was \"can't miss\", and that held up well. We were greeted by Ana, who was gracious and kept us periodically informed of how long our wait would be, and made quite sure we were well hydrated at the bar. The ambiance of the place is nice, albeit a little noisy in the small dining room, and there were what seemed to be quite a few regulars for a Monday night. The three of us at the table managed to get a different type of pasta (meat, seafood, and tortolini), and everyone enjoyed what they had, which was good for us hosts who decided to wing it on showing what good food in North Beach was like.", "author": "Jared R."}

We went to Sodini's tonight after a matinee show at the Club Fugazi; I know I read the yelp review and we were going to go to Cafe Sport due to the more popular ratings but when we went by ~ 6:40PM, it was emply  so we headed up the street and found Sodini with a lot of people inside.  The ambience is cozy with a nice bar; the bartender was very accommodating and sat us right away to a table for six although there were only 3 of us. The waitress was friendly and took our order right away.  This is was already 6:45 PM.  It took 45 minutes to get the appetizer which was just a caprese salad and took over an hour for the pasta entree.  The service was extremely slow and it seemed this was the normal pace as the waitress never did once came to apologize for the delay.  We just had pasta dishes was they were not exceptional.  If you want to go and drink tons and don't care about getting served your food, then this place is okay; if not, then you will be starved before you get served!", "author": "Mei L."}
