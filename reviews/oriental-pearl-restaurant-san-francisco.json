I get a little nervous. My dining partner and I had a flight to catch and wanted to get our last Dim Sum fix in before heading to the airport. The restaurant is on a second level, we were greeted and seated by the hostess (?owner).\n\nUp front I will say the service was very very good, We ordered: Beers, Spicy Salt Shell Prawns, Shrimp Dumplings, Shrimp and Chive Dumplings and BBQ Steamed Buns. The food came out hot and fresh and tasted good. I'm glad I tried this new place for us. Would I go back, maybe... but with so many other choices???\n\nAtmosphere: nicer than most typical Chinatown restaurants. Service: very good, Food: good.", "author": "Melody K."}

There was a ton of tourists and we were the only Asian people dining, even as it got full to capacity around 8pm on a Saturday night.\n\nThe Peking Duck was good, they make the pancakes for you, complete with sauce, cucumbers, scallions and carrots. I didn't like it that they did not present the duck and slice it in front of the table, and I like to roll my own pancakes. At almost sixty bucks, it was on the expensive side but I guess it is a tourist place.\n\nThere was this \"decorative\" vase made entirely of veggies that came with the duck, very pretty with the vase made of taro and the flowers made of celery, carrots, ginger and cucumber. You can't eat It though, and neither can you take it home. Strange.", "author": "Alex C."}

Location of this restaurant is on Clay Street, about 1/2 block from Portsmouth Square. The restaurant is on the second level. One can either take the elevator or walk up the stairs. The name of the restaurant sounds a bit cheesy to me. Is this restaurant more of an attraction for tourists having a first time experience with a dim sum lunch?\n\nAmbiance: nice for a restaurant of its size. Some artwork mounted on one of the walls. Lovely floral arrangements on the credenza. \n\nThe host and employees are attentive and pleasant. I even spoke a few words in Cantonese to them. They filled our water glasses and brought pots of tea without us asking. Service was prompt. A fixed menu was on the lazy susan at each table. \n\nSome of the dim sum (egg roll, shrimp dumpling aka har gow and potsticker) were pretty good. The remaining ones were small in size (chicken cilantro, beef dumpling, Shanghai style pork dumpling). The vegetable fried rice was slightly bland. The chicken chow mein was edible...not greasy, which was a good thing. For dessert we had sweet sesame ball, fortune cookie and mint candy. I don't know what happened with the bean paste filling inside the sweet sesame ball. It was lacking in a flavor of sweetness.\n\nInasmuch as I would like to give them a four star rating for their ambiance, service and some of the dim sum, I walked away not totally impressed with the tiny dumplings. The sweet sesame ball was a disappointment. I can only say it must be the Chinese in me to say I had better dim sum elsewhere in both San Francisco and Oakland Chinatown (restaurants and bakeries). \n\nBecause lunch was part of a tour for us senior citizens at a cost of $62 per person, I don't know what percentage of the cost was for transportation, admission to the Asian Art Museum and lunch. It has left me somewhat pondering whether the lunch was worth the value.", "author": "Carol C."}

Probably the best bet for Chinese food in Chinatown. \n\nOverall, I liked the Oriental Pearl Restaurant and it would be my go-to choice for Dim Sum in Chinatown.  Having said that, I know the best Dim Sum in San Francisco is not actually in Chinatown.  But if you are in Chinatown and wanting to enjoy some Chinese cuisine this is a good spot to do so.  The restaurant had crisp table clothes, service was attentive and all of the dishes I tried were enjoyable.  The wonton soup, made with fresh, home made wontons was tasty and I really enjoyed the chow fun noodles as well.\n\nWhen walking through Chinatown you will find that you are solicited by restaurateurs to come and try their these Chinese cuisine.

But then the fun began.  We sat unattended while the entire restaurant was seated before Rebecca came over to take our drink orders (we had pre-ordered our food because of the size of our party).  So that was 15-20 minutes.  Rebecca was very friendly, outgoing, and came promptly with our drinks.  Then our food started coming out.  Halfway into our first helpings, we were looking for refills but Rebecca was no where to be seen.  Finally, another woman came and started bringing drinks two at a time.  We were celebrating Christmas and were in no hurry, so our meal took more than an hour, however the food came out hot and quick.  Nice.  The food dishes were really very good - the honey walnut shrimp especially - but the Oriental Pearl fried rice tasted like it was 50% green onion and looked it, too.  Not so nice.  We had to ask for steamed rice (I guess because we ordered fried rice, the presumption was that all 12 of us were going to eat it).  We waited a bit for the new waitress to come around for refills again.  Then everything fell apart.  We finished and they started to come and clear our dishes but never brought us a check.  After 15 minutes, I tried signalling to the new waitress who was one table over, but she never looked up.  Another 10 minutes before I finally got her attention and asked for the check.  ANOTHER 15 minutes went by and by this time I felt like jumping on the table to get her attention again.  She came over and I again asked for the check.  She made a face like \"Oh, darn, I forgot\" and ran off to get it.  When she brought it, we split the check three ways.  We did the math for them, telling the waitress (we wrote it down) which amount went on which credit card.  I swear this is true, another 15 minutes went by.  By this time I got up and went to the cashier/hostess.  I asked if there was a problem with our bill.  The woman said, \"Too many credit cards\" like their machine was overloaded or something like that made any sense.  So I had to leave to not start yelling.  I waited outside while my party finally got the checks to sign.  I realize in the food industry that splitting the check can be aggravating, but WE DID THE MATH FOR THEM.  All they had to do was run the amounts.\n\nI felt like we went from really important customers to completely unimportant.

Yelp reviews were the answer and the correct answer!\n\nOn Clay Street, it was pretty easy to find, doesn't look like much from the outside, but once up the stairs, it's a wonderful looking restaurant, very clean, very understated and very quiet as it's one floor off the street.  Yes, we were a little put off that we were the only persons in the restaurant when we started, but by the end of our lunch, we were the only non-Asians in the place!  That means a lot.\n\nWe ordered the Dim Sum lunch for 4 persons, additional non-shrimp portions for our seafood allergic friend, and a vegetarian lunch for the vegan among us.  Very beautiful presentations of the food, the hostess (she could have been the owner, I didn't ask) took the time (along with our server) to explain what the different items were, what sauces to eat them with, etc.\n\nGreat place to rest for a few minutes and regroup before hitting the tourist spots in the afternoon.\n\nProbably a 4.5 out of 5 stars in my book.", "author": "Liz T."}

Oriental Pearl definitely fits that bill - it's a small restaurant that has two entrances, one of which is nonfunctioning, and you have to go up a less indirect door to the left of the restaurant in order to get in. Once inside, you might notice pretty quickly that the d\u00e9cor isn't all that special - but what really sold me on the place, as it will probably you, is the food. It's great for the price. Typical dim sum fare, made to order, was served quickly and was piping hot - not least it was delicious. The wait staff is extremely genial and feels like you're sitting down to eat with a family - the owner stopped me during my order and told me \"You're ordering too much food for one person!\" She meant it kindly, and it only served to make you feel like they really wanted you to have the most comfortable experience possible there. I loved this place and would absolutely recommend it to anyone who asks for weekday dim sum.", "author": "Jay C."}

When we arrived,  there were two other tables with people seated. A couple at one and three adults at the other.  We were seated promptly and our order was taken by the lady who seated us.  Other people continued to arrive and be seated. After 20 or more minutes we noticed that those who came in after us had their food. We had ordered an appetizer and two entrees.  Other waiters and waitresses were attending to other tables but our waitress never came back to us even though she was seating everyone and taking their orders.  After 50 minutes we stopped another waitress and asked if she could find out where our food was.  We then stopped the original lady who took our order and seated us and she made some excuse about ours taking longer because of the appetizer--Even though everybody around us had already gotten their appetizers and entrees and finished eating. Finally, one hour after we arrived the waitress brought our entree and said they were working on our appetizer.  They offered a free dessert for the inconvenience.   We cancelled the appetizer and the dessert was not worth eating.  The waitress/hostess was clearly managing the rest of the staff and just forgot us.  Poor management. She should at least have acknowledged her mistake instead of making up an excuse and blaming it on our appetizer order.   This is the first time I have ever left a restaurant review.

As you walk through the little neighborhood, restaurant workers stand outside the doors and aggressively beckon you to come inside. Don't give into their pressure and conniving pleas; rather, thoughtfully consult your Yelp app for recommendations. That's exactly what we did to find Oriental Pearl. \n\nWe sauntered in on a lazy, late Sunday morning and were seated without a problem. The dim sum menu was quite extensive. Between four of us, we ordered a lot. Some of the items that stood out to me:\n\nBBQ PORK BUN:  Nicely executed. This is one of those addicting options that one can just keep noshing on over and over again. \n\nSHRIMP & CHIVES DUMPLING:  I ordered this twice. I just couldn't get enough of it.\n\nVEGETABLE EGG ROLLS:  Piping hot. Very satisfying.\n\nBBQ SPARE RIBS:  A nice snack that I shared with another person at the table. They weren't overly sauced, something that I appreciated. Light and tangy.\n\nServers were very sweet and kind. A team of them attentively took care of us throughout our stay. They made sure the food kept coming and coming. I applaud them for keeping up since we ordered an abundance of items. \n\nEach item ranged from $3.50 - $4.75.

Yet, for the price tag, I was underwhelmed. Better places to check out in Chinatown.", "author": "Li Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-10-06", "description": "What is authentic Chinese food?\nLike any cuisine, the answer is defined by its audience.  While someone from the Midwest or Southern states might mention places like Panda Express and P.F. Chang, SoCal (Monterey Park and Rowland Heights mainly) residents, like in Monty Python's Holy Grail, might answer with another questions, \"What kind?\"... leading to a plethora of Northern style, Southern style, Hong Kong or Taiwan vs. Mainland styles, or lead into another question... \"What region?\"\nThis leads me to this quiet, hidden restaurant in the heart of the touristy part of Chinatown off of Grant Avenue.  \nMy mother was born in Shantou, center of Chiu Chow (also spelled Teo Cheow)people where, not only is the food different, the language and, in many ways, mentality is different.  When the Japanese occupied China during WWII, many locals from this region fled to Viet Nam and Singapore.  This is why many Vietnamese immigrants in the Bay Area likely speak Chiu Chow dialect.\nBack in the 1980's, there were two Chiu Chow restaurants, the upstairs restaurant now named Clay Pot City and a small place on 9th Avenue near Judah, now .\nBeing my mom's birthday, I wanted to do something special to celebrate and remembered that the owners are from there and offer some staple dishes.  \n\nAppetizers\n1) Shrimp Balls (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=KLW-gN80RdqdAKqIKSowhg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - I know... so many jokes can be made on this one.  Pretty good as the filling had the authentic flavor though the skin seemed a bit thick.  A bit pricey at $9.25 for four balls.\n\n2) Marinade Duck Chiu Chow style  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hSAu823ye17ZSyp4v2eWYw&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - This homestyle prepared dish is made in the traditional manner and served with a white vinegar garlic dipping sauce.  Being heavily flavored, goes well with rice. \n\nSoup\n3) Minced Beef Soup with Egg White  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_zlS9KApRoRBbroGUvJe9w&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Never seen a restaurant apportion takeout soup in five individual small containers like this.  Would have be tastier with cilantro.\n\nMains\n4) Spicy Braised Chicken  - Even the owner warned me that this was not cooked in authentic Chiu Chow style with basil leaves.  This is a Chiu Chow cuisine signature dish that didn't quite hit the mark.\n\n5) Braised Rock Cod Fish Filet with Minced Pork, Shrimp, and Tofu Clay Pot (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=pWQA4SfaquyoD5L69THPLQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) -Recommended by the owner, this was just 'meh'.  No distinct flavor though cooked with peeled garlic cloves.  Pass.\n\n6) Olive Leaf Green Bean stir fry (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=9m9A02tRBCaDRbSfSNP3lg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Another Chiu Chow dish, it was on the saltier side (too much olive leaves?) and would have benefited if cooked with ground pork for more flavoring.\n\nDessert\n7)  Taro pudding (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=K-mHhn5LWl7gI2_5zLYCqQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Probably the best dish of the evening.  Usually served family style, like the soup, apportioned in five small takeout containers.  Imagine your mom or grandmother mashing taro to a poi-like consistency, but with sweet flavors.  The gingko nuts confirmed the dish's authenticity.  A single serving is $5.75.\n\nSadly, my mom cannot fault me for the effort, but, if she knew what I paid for dinner, my ears would probably be chewed off.  All main dishes were $10.00 + with the fish being the tops at $16.75.\nI don't profess to be an expert in Chiu Chow cooking like my mom, but she's educated my palate to certain expectations.  From my first trip to Hong Kong when she told me about a small place upstairs in the herb district in Sheung Wan to the local places that opened in the late 1980's in Chinatown and in the Sunset District, she would order their staple dishes that bring back memories of her childhood.  In the late '80's to late '90's, my work travels took me to Hong Kong annually where my cousins would take me to a Chiu Chow restaurant near the Macau ferry.  Now, if only there was enough of an audience to warrant bringing those chefs here.  Sadly, a magazine cover with Rachel Ray about under $40.00 per day adorns their entrance window (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q), evidence of the audience that they target.", "author": "Mike C."}

Horrible food..Horrible decor..Oh, and Rachael Ray likes this place? \n\nI tested this place out when I was visiting SF and I am honestly not impressed. First of all, this place was completely empty during lunch time on a weekend, and it is obvious it is going downhill. My little sister and I ordered the Chef's Suggestion Meal for Two (Order B)  with Tofu Soup, house special dim sum, prawns with honey glazed walnut, Kung Pao chicken, and oriental pearl rice. Those are generic items that I assumed would be hard to mess up. Before I explain how nasty the food is, it took me about SIX TIMES where I had to ask for water before getting some to my table. The service sucked and we were never checked up on. \n\nThe dim sum tasted like it was something frozen that had been heated up. The tofu soup was basically really bad egg drop soup with bits of tofu in it. The prawns disappointed us the most. I usually love honey walnut shrimp and this tasted like there was pineapple juice squeezed onto it along with mayo lathered over fried prawns. the Kung Pao chicken was very bare. I couldn't tell between the water chestnuts and the diced up chicken because turned out there was twice as much chestnuts compared to chicken... \n\nOverall, I did not enjoy my experience here at all despite all the accolades and awards it has received.

So far, Oriental Pearl, in my opinion, is by far one of the best ones in the city.\n\nI've never eaten in the restaurant since I do take-out all the time, but I eat from their menu about two or three times a week. I usually order Mongolian Beef or Kung-Pao Chicken from their lunch special menu. Both dishes are amazingly delicious, but I enjoy the tenderness and rich flavor of the Mongolian Beef. I've tried this dish in many other restaurants before and none of them come close to Oriental Pearl's. \n\nThey make it perfect. The beef is very tender and not tough, perfect ratio of beef to onions and all the other major ingredients. It's just simply delicious. The best part is that at the time of writing this review, if you order this dish, or any other for that matter from their Lunch Special menu on weekdays between 12PM - 3PM, it costs only $9.00! This includes steamed rice and a small bowl of soup.\n\nI've never dined inside of the restaurant, therefore I cannot comment on their service. But when I call in the order, the staff is always nice and friendly and the food is usually ready in ten minutes. And when I pick up the food, the dining room is very clean and inviting and the staff is warm and friendly. The only reason for 4-stars instead of 5, is because the Mongolian Beef is slightly more greasy or oily than it should be.

This is the kind of place we're all looking for, right? Uh, no. We made a reservation and were glad we did. The dining room was full and folks were seated on steps outside the restaurant, right smack in the way, waiting for tables to open-up. As has been noted in other reviews, fellow customers were all tourists, none of of them Asian - uh-oh. The food was high-priced meh. I don't know if I have ever rated a Chinese joint for its steamed rice, but it was horrible, like last week's Uncle Ben's. Don't waste your time and money.", "author": "Steve L."}

To be clear, I love SF's Chinatown and almost always find awesome places to eat, no matter how \"hole in the wall.\" Not this place, and so not for this price.\n\nWe were in the mood for a little snack, nothing much, so we ordered the appetizer platter for 2, which came with egg rolls, potstickers, dumplings, and shrimp balls. For $16.50. Please keep that price point in mind. What we got - one egg roll, cut into 4 pieces. 2 potstickers. 2 shrimp balls. 4 dumplings. By my mind, that's almost $1.83 per piece - they better be good. Uh, no. The shrimp balls were pretty good, everything else was substandard. The best part were the beef dumplings, which were raw in the middle. Plus, they charged us $3.75 for a pot of really awful tea.\n\nThis place is a huge ripoff and you can probably get better Chines food in Tulsa or something.", "author": "Deb G."}

Second floor restaurant in Chinatown, has an elevator but it was kind of hidden. Surprised at how elegant it was inside after the dingy exterior. Service was great, with servers making helpful suggestions for the meal we had in mind and bringing everything nice and hot. There was a good selection of vegetable dishes, food was fresh, very tasty and sauces not overdone. Surprised to read a few reviews criticizing the quality, portions, and prices of the food. Our friend who was a professional chef loved it, and portion sizes were reasonable: we came hungry and got one entree each, with leftovers for each of us. Most seafood entrees were between $17.50 and $24.50, which is not unusual even in cities with lower cost of living. Only thing is you order rice separately and the portion is rather small, about one cup. Would definitely go there again, but I don't recommend it if you expect a place with American-size portions.", "author": "Laura H."}

Given that we'd walked over a mile to get there, this was.. slightly uncomfortable, but after sitting for a bit, we acclimated. \n\nWe ordered Iced tea (BIG MISTAKE) and our food, along with hot tea and ice water.  The Hot tea was delicious, but the Iced Tea was Rose and it was like drinking your grandmother's hand lotion. It was REVOLTING.  My husband ordered Hot and Sour soup that was .. oily and burnt flavoured, and our friend tried some too, immediately pushing it away, there wsa something other than tofu in it and given he's a vegetarian, it was off his menu.  \n\nMongolian beef, General Tso's and Almond chicken were our mains and they were all flavourful, I found it odd that we had to pay for steamed rice, that it didn't come as part of the meal. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised, they are milking the Rachel Ray & Zagat recommendations. If given the choice, I might not come back.

We tried roasted duck, cod fish with bokchoy, vegetable fried rice and duck chow fun. All of them tasted REALLY delicious!!    \n\nFirst, the roasted duck is definitely a must-have dish, even though somebody in the previous review mentioned that the duck might not be crispy. Personally, this is the best roasted duck place I've ever had so far in US.\n\nSecond, the ingredients are very fresh. And the dishes are not salty and greasy at all. They kept a PERFECT balance between the amount of food and the seasoning they put into the dishes, which is great, given that in many Chinese restaurants, the food are usually greasy and with too much sauce on the top.\n\nThird,  aside from the delicious food, their service was GREAT!! All the waitors and waitresses are nice, friendly and patient.

I ordered mongolian beef and boyfriend ordered chow mien. The chow mien is made with thin noodles, and not thicker spaghetti like noodles which I was accustomed too, but nevertheless it was tasty. Be careful of the monogolian beef as is packs a punch. It is often advertised on menus as being spicy, and the dish turns out to be much more sweet and saucy than spicy. This dish was the opposite.

Like most Chinatowns in urban America, the area is seedy and decrepit.  Despite our misgivings we went in, based on the rec.  The Pearl is no exception.  \n\nShould have trusted our instincts, developed over years of travel dining, and moved on.\n\nWe tried a sampling of a few items.  Their menu posted outside doesn't match the one in the dining room.  No dim sum at night.  OK, fine, we can adapt.  After confusing explanations from the waiter of their a la carte menu (no rice served with dishes??) we finally ordered.  In a nutshell, the food is uninspired and ordinary at best.  A weird flavor dominated one dish we had, the sauted prawns, making the dish unusual and unappetizing.  Prawns the size of 25-30 count shrimp?  Plus it was really oily.  And $15 for an order of fried rice with seafood, with very little seafood and too many scallions.  \n\nI am surprised how highly rated this place is, in a town with so many Asians I would expect more.  I've had much better Chinese in other cities with less predominant an Asian influence.  Just not impressed at all and wouldn't return. \n\nIf this place is supposed to be one of the best, I would hate to sample the average.\n\nOh yeah, our waiter was just OK, he vacillated between helpful and annoyed at our inability to decipher his largely indiscernible explanation of their offerings.  He would only stay a moment at our table before darting off, promising to return once we figured out what we wanted.

The sauce is addictive.  All other dishes we've ever had have been delicious as well.  We've been here lots of times and never left disappointed.\n\nThe ambiance is simple which we love.  Less is more and yet it seems very authentic.  White table cloths and comfy chairs.  It makes the experience so much better.\n\nIt seems like the same people have worked here for as long as the place has been open.  They even remember us though we only drop in once every 4 - 6 months.  Part of why this restaurant is so consinstently good is because the owner is there every night.  Their presence undoubtedly creates an expectation of excellence.\n\nWe can highly recommend Oriental Pearl and will be back many more times.", "author": "Hartmut O."}

I have been meaning to expand my culinary horizons within the Chinatown area. They have a pretty comprehensive menu with set menus for everything from dim sum prix-fixe to fixed meals and lunch specials (that come with tasty hot and sour soup and your choice of rice), but I must say that they are extremely strict on the no substitution rule, and you can only do the set menus IF two or more persons are doing the same set menu. \n\nI came in craving dim sum and wish they had more of an extensive selection, but they had the usual suspects, har gow, shiu mai, steamed pork buns, potstickers, etc. and a decent selection of the traditional offerings of a Chinese restaurant. I do love the carts that go around at authentic spots that one tends to find at a Cantonese restaurant. They had the white tablecloth, simple decor, and it was clean. The service was good and fast, was not too stifling, the pricing was reasonable (for SF restaurants) and the food was pretty authentic. My cab driver even vouched for them on the way in.\n\nIt is pretty centrally located in Chinatown, and they have tons of competition, but it is not bad, and extremely well-priced. My good friend and I enjoyed our lunch there, but either the meal was salty, we were extremely dehydrated, or the glasses were small, because after 2 refills on our diet cokes, we still needed more, and I usually can't finish one can in a setting! I am pretty sure it was priced per re-fill too. Not a hefty charge but when you have tons of re-fills, it adds up!\n\nI will come back, after I check out their competition!", "author": "Tammy H."}

I knew because I took a before and after picture on my camera and it was VERY obvious. They didn't even bother to rearrange the dumplings. I don't even want to know what they did back there that took them that long to bring out the SAME plate. \n\nWhen I pointed this out at the end of the meal, the waitress said \"No, it's a different plate.\" I said, \"No, it's the SAME plate. Do you want to see the pictures on my camera?\" That's when the waiter that brought the plate to us walked by, picked up the plate, and rudely said that he would take the dish off our bill. \n\nI would NOT come back to this place simply because I believe what they tried to pull off was so distasteful and disrespectful.", "author": "lisa p."}

The food is great, probably some of the best dim sum/Chinese I've had in the city. We had the famous meatballs which were so flavorful and delicate. The casing for them was egg whites...you don't normally see that, but it turned out really well. I ordered the shrimp and chive dumplings and the chicken and cilantro dumplings. They were so good and better than dim sum at the popular Yank Sing. We also had the fried rice and Mongolian beef.  The fried rice seemed surprisingly healthy with hardly any oil. The atmosphere here isn't particularly welcoming, but its about as good as it gets in China town. The servers were all really friendly, but service was really slow. It took us about 2 hours to order and finish our lunch. So if your looking for good dim sum but want to stray from the usual touristy places, this is a great option in the heart of China Town.", "author": "Hayley H."}

We were shocked more when the 6 other people at the table were also sharing the table. The dim sum here is alright and the service is very bad. When all of the parties had left our table, the host wanted to seat a 6 party family and they declined right in front of us. It was kind of embarrassing so we kind of rushed to get out of the restaurant. The 2nd time I went here, their food was actually very good. The fried taro dumplings and mongolian beef over rice were both good. But too much onions in my beef dish and very few meat. But luckily, I did not have to share a table.", "author": "Danster L."}

The menu is very limited and everything is pretty much made to order.  It's just on the edge of Chinatown.  During the weekdays, it caters to office workers from the Financial District and some lucky tourists who stumble upon it.  You might have seen this on the older, San Francisco episode of Rachel Ray's \"$40 A Day\".  \n\nThe service is good and friendly.  It's a small dining room and there are no pushcarts.  It's quiet, so you can enjoy a nice lunch and conversation.  I've only been here for lunch.  The food is pretty consistent.  I like the salt & pepper calamari.  Because almost everything is freshly made, the traditional dishes, such as har gow and the shrimp filled rice rolls, are almost translucent and come out piping hot.  Portions are about right, but dishes are pricer than if you went further into Chinatown.  The quality here is much better.", "author": "CE Y."}

Truthfully I would've given 3.5 stars for the food, however the service deserved one star.   This is a very authentic Chinese Restaurant and they have a huge menu.  We had reservations at 830 pm and were seated on time, however, the waiter didn't give us menus until 854pm--we were starving by this time.  We ordered a bunch of dishes to share among the 12 of us and the waiter said that he may make some orders half orders so that we can try a variety of entrees in case we were ordering too much food but that we could continue to add more to our order later on.  The portions are pretty small compared to most Chinese restaurants and everything came out at different times which was annoying but appreciated because I would rather things come out hot and fresh as opposed to sitting under a heat lamp.  My husband is a vegetarian and ordered a vegetarian noodle dish for his meal and I'm pretty sure the waiter forgot about it because all of the other food was coming out and I finally asked the waiter at 945 where the vegetarian dish was and it came out about 5 minutes later (he was watching everybody else eat for a half an hour).   We wanted to order a couple more dishes because we finished everything that was brought to our table and we were still under the impression that we had one more dish coming (we ordered 2 Mongolian beefs) and when we asked the waiter he said that we only ordered one and that the kitchen was closed. THE KITCHEN IS CLOSED?!  The waiter never mentioned that the kitchen was closing and we had no idea because we tried to order more food when they put an order of fried rice on our table that clearly, someone had just cooked.  We were told that we could not order any more food and they were sorry and would give us some dessert on the house.  They didn't offer us a choice of desserts, and instead brought out 3 martini glasses filled with lychee fruit, however, this group wasn't as fond of lychees.  They finally offered to take 20% off of our bill which was nice of them, but still didn't make up for the fact that half of our party was still hungry.  All in all it was ok, but  it wast the best experience during our short visit to San Fran.  Maybe it was an off night or something?", "author": "S K."}

They came out just about the same time, and I must say, they were all excellent.\n\nHowever, special notice must be given to the Prawns and Chicken w/ Potato Nest.

I couldn't tell if the Dim Sum were homemade or Cosco-made (see the problem?). What is sure is that there are better places for Dim Sum around the bay (e.g. Hong Kong East Ocean Seafood Restaurant on a Sunday). Wan Tan soups are often blend. Here, it had the right seasoning. But, again, the wan tans tasted the industrially made. Anyway, the soup was still nice. The main course was adapted for Western people. It was a traditional lookalike Chinese food, sweet and fake. It wasn't bad. And I can't blame them for adapting their meals for locals. It's just that I know that better Chinese restaurants can be found in SF and this stupid Michelin thing made my expectations too high.\n\nOh, and a last thing, can Yelp ask bars and restaurants to stop using this sugary yellowish lemon flavor syrup for cocktails?

Food is decent, place is clean and the staff speaks english.   I was pleasantly surprised and given I had low expectations, it exceeded my expectations.", "author": "Val V."}

The service was as friendly and attentitive as always and the food top notch.  The deep fried prawns with spicy sauce were greasless and crispy with a tongue tingling, lip biting sauce that was like a spicy sweet and sour sauce to be exact.  The Oriental Pearl fried rice is dry and firm with fresh shrimp, flavorful Chinese sausage, and meaty mushrooms which make for a wonderful plethora of flavors.  The rice noodles with duck and preserved vegetables are aldentae with slightly chewy but gflavorful duck meat and fresh vegetables.  The barbecued quail has a smooth, liqured exterior and moist interior.  AS far as more dim sum is concerned, the deep fried taro dumplings are a little greasy, but not by much with a meaty, thick, and starchy and salty taro and ground pork filling.  The deep-fried squid with spicy salt is crispy with ever the slightlest greasness and a one-two punch of a salt and pepper coating over the entire squid.  The pan-fried shrimp and chive dumplings are crispy on the bottom and gossamer omn the top with suculent whole shrimps and savery chives.  The day that I was there two weeks after the Newyear parade, one of the waitresses gave us a free order of tjheir flaky, buttery, smooth, rich egg custard tarts.  Oriental Pearl is definitely one of the few good remianing restaurants in Chinatown which will stand the test of time.  Once again, keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}
