It's everything you'd imagine a hipster coffee shop to be, avocado toast and all. \n\nI came here on a Saturday and while most tables were full, it wasn't packed at full capacity. This place can be a little tricky to navigate once inside because since it's a corner shop at an angle, you find yourself dodging patrons and tables.\n\nI ordered the avo toast about $4 plus $2 extra for the poached egg addition and a regular chai ($4). With tip my breakfast came out to about $14. SF is pricey even for a slice of bread with earth on it :)\n\nThe avo toast was a Pinterest dream with slices of avocado, salt, pepper, and an egg. The chai was light and airy although I preferred my chai a little stronger to be honest. I'll have to return again to try the rest of the expresso offerings to be a solid review but for now my love of plants and people watching way this is a solid coffee shop.

Everything from the fresh flowers to the branded cups to the light fixtures made me happy here.  \n\nThe only issue I had here is that I liked it so much, I came back the next morning on my way to run an errand. I showed up right at 8 am, which is when they open on Sundays, and the two younger baristas inside seemed annoyed that they had to unlock the door for me. They were also blasting John Mayer and none of the chairs were set up yet, so maybe they got in late or something.

In my opinion, the space/ambiance here is better than the food and coffee.\n\nI used to work around the corner from this location, so I've been a consistent and frequent visitor. I enjoy a good iced coffee, particularly on those Sept/Oct Indian summer days, but whenever I get one here I am always a little disappointed. It usually tastes overly acidic, like it's been brewed too long. It's not horrible (and don't get me wrong, I drink it every time), but when the price approaches $5 for a coffee, you expect a bit more. \n\nThe food here is also OK. Most are small plates, avocado toast, granola, etc., that you could easily make at home yourself, and thus feel overpriced. All in all, if you stick to the hot espresso or tea drinks and pastries, you will not be disappointed - and definitely linger to enjoy the space!", "author": "Kathryn P."}

This coffee shop is located on the corner of a street and you can't miss it. The sun shines in the shop making it warm and bright. The menu is simple and I asked if the chai syrup was vegan and it was so I ordered a dirty chai with non cow milk in it. Making it vegan of course! \n\nThe baristas were very nice and made the drinks face. My significant other ordered a macchiato and it had beautiful latte art. \n\nThere's a restroom in the back and complimentary water station too! \n\nBack to the dirty chai, it was good, a little too foamy for my liking and I would have preferred a little more of a cinnamon taste to it.

Who would imagine that, sandwiched between a bunch of strip clubs and sex shops, there exists a coffee shop and breakfast spot so magnificent it practically defies description? Yet there it is, complete with delightful outdoor seating on a block that's chock-full of terrific people watching.\n\nWhat makes it so great? Let me count the ways:\n\n1) R\u00e9veille translates literally as \"wake up,\" and there is no better description for what will happen to your senses after a few sips of their coffee. I consume caffeine the way most people breath air, and one Americano from this joint lasted me half the day.\n\n2) I also ordered their veggie frittata, a side of three additional eggs and an arugula salad. The frittata was fairly flavorless, hence the missing star on this review, but the salad (served tossed with a delightful lemon dressing) and eggs (obviously cooked in real butter) were terrific. \n\n3) Without question, the restaurant's Pi\u00e8ce De R\u00e9sistance is its almond butter and jam toast. Seriously. Order this even if you aren't hungry. It's incomparable.\n\nI picked R\u00e9veille on a whim after initially trying the coffee shop next door, which was inexplicably closed.

The cold brew was poured over ice and just delicious. I'm pretty sure cold brew has a higher caffeine content because I'm always super wired after consumption. Side note, espresso is pronounced e-spres-oh. There is no X involved, so don't do it. It's one of my biggest pet peeves... :) \n\nThe parklet is my favorite part of this coffee shop.

And it was indeed crazy-busy when I attempted to infuse my cold body with caffeine. It's pretty clear the Newbury brothers take their coffee quite seriously judging from the high quality of the brews. It's hard to stand out in a city already saturated with Philz and Blue Bottle shops and on the palates of the patrons who would not be caught dead at a Starbucks much less utter that name on their lips. However, they brew a fine cup well worth tasting.\n\nThe Flatiron-style building is at the intersection of Columbus, Kearny and Pacific (photo: http://bit.ly/1AbWbdR), the starting point for many a traveller looking to explore North Beach. That would be me that morning, and I ordered a $2.50 cup of Americano to prepare me for my journey (photo: http://bit.ly/16WDTSO). It was deliciously scalding but with a subtlety in the beans and gone much too soon. They serve cafe-style breakfasts like egg sandwiches and cinnamon toast, as well as salads and sandwiches for lunch. I'll return when it feels less rushed in here with the cacophony of multilingual tongues filling the small space. That's where the nearby Station SF has an advantage as you can actually lounge a bit there. Here you honestly can't wait to leave.\n\nCOFFEE - 4 stars...a smooth whisp of caffeine with a bit of a bite\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...nice modern interior but rather claustrophobic especially on a busy Saturday morning\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...no complaints about the baristas\nTOTAL - 4 stars...the strength of the coffee here trumps the other aspects", "author": "Ed U."}

When I politely asked noted that I asked for my drink iced, the second barista making my drink responded with \"it wasn't on the screen\" and refused to remake my drink when clearly it was the miss on the other barista.

For my one-year anniversary with my boyfriend, we made a trip back in August so he could see all that I call home. Of all the places he wanted to try in San Francisco, Reveille Coffee was on the top of his list. I really liked the vibe the last time I came by in December 2014 so I was more than willing to go again. However, due to our tight schedule and unforeseen circumstances (stupid car rental place), we were unable to stop by. :(\n\nEven though we couldn't get to Reveille Coffee, I was determined to bring a little bit of Reveille Coffee to New Haven. I ventured on their website and was able to send an email directly to the owner(s), specifically asking if it was possible for me to purchase two bags of their whole bean coffee. Our ensuing conversation was quick, easy, and amiable. Within a few days, I was told that my coffee had been delivered and would arrive in a week (it actually arrived in 3 days!!). I was also able to pay through their payment platform which made it easy! My boyfriend is a coffee addict/lover to the max so imagine the look of surprise when he opened the package. :) The fact that the owners of Reveille Coffee were able to fulfill a special request for me made it all the more special.

I just can't make it up)\n\nSo after picking up a delicious old fashion maple donut from Happy Donuts (across the street), the group and I decided that we needed coffee to compliment our morning delight. I had Reveille before and for some reason I wasn't a huge fan. But today, today was the day that my eyes had been opened once more. \n\nI ordered an almond latte (surprise). It took about 15 minutes to get my drink, but it was early and there was a line and I was patient with my donut. I started to look around and I really enjoyed how they made the bar as their centerpiece of their space. You can easily watch as the baristas are steaming the milk, forming their coffee art, and even making slow pourovers, either way, it made my waiting experience quite eventful. The cafe overall is small but it's nice that they have side bar seating and small tables for people to enjoy the food and drinks. I love the open windows and their typography logo. And hey, if it's a nice day, some outdoor seating has been created recently and I think that gives this cafe an extra plus in my book.\n\nAh, 15 minutes pass and my coffee comes. I was really happy with the coffee art and the temperature of the coffee. The foam of the milk was perfectly light and fluffy and the espresso was surprisingly strong. The almond milk had a hint of sweetness that went really well with my donut. The latte cooled down within 15 minutes or so but it remained amazingly delicious. I would have to say that this is one of the best almond latte's I've had (for now). Yay!\n\nUpdate: the next day\nHad their $2.50 drip coffee! The cup is extremely hot so it was too hot for me to even consume! But then it hit me.... I didn't love Reveille too much before because I felt their drip had a sour tang. I commend them for having a strong light roast, but the tang is a no no for me. Going to add some non-dairy next time.", "author": "Linda K."}

Once however,  when I had my cappuccino in the cafe, there was a bit more milk than i would like so it kind of turned into a latte.  Another time the shot pulled was a bit acidic so it wasn't as smooth as i've had it previously.  A friend have suggested that we should only go when the two brothers (owners) are there as they make a more consistent cup and they know what up.  \n\nI've also tried their Egg Sandwich, with Bacon and Kale.  Which, along with the inconsistencies why i'm dropping it a star from a full 5.  The sandwich was pretty good. It looks cool since it was \"egg in a basket\" but the $3 extra i paid for the Bacon and Kale was a little too much seeing that it was a ton of kale and what amounts to roughly 1 slice of bacon broken into 3 pieces.  Needless to say I was slightly disappointed on that front.\n\nI do enjoy the minimalist design of the interior and love the center island coffee bar.  The metal beams that are both structural and decorative. Extremely hipster trendy.  I want to say that there is seating upstairs for people who plan on staying longer (i've only seen people upstairs from the outside), but i'm not sure.  The downstairs counter seating is good for people coming in and out for 30 mins to enjoy a cup of coffee, people watch or have quick conversation.  The high traffic around the island makes it not feel like a sit down for hours type of room.  \n\nI work around Jackson Square and come out to church in Chinatown on Sundays and for the longest time my friends and I've been looking for a good coffee shop to enjoy a cup on Sunday afternoon.

I liked the interior with the very big windows that allowed you to look out and enjoy the scenery. Definitely a good place to people watch, chat with a friend or just chill with a good book while nursing your coffee. The lady at the register was really nice and happily prepared my iced soy latte which tasted a lot better than your average chain coffee. They don't add sugar but there is simple syrup and lids for the cups in the back.\n\nThis coffee joint is cute but it's pricey and a bit out of the way for me.

The space is nice and open and everything seems really clean. The staff was friendly enough but they all seem to have the same expression on their face as they greet you. It's as if they are wondering if you will become one of the regulars that they will get to know and befriend as time goes by or if you're just there to judge the new corner coffee shop. \n\nThere weren't many people when I stopped by around 8:20 and my coffee was ready in about five minutes.

I'm a big fan of their coffee truck, but it's a little out of the way for  me to go to all the time.  This location is perfect for those of us who walk through North Beach to work. \n\nYes, their coffee is delicious.  What I wasn't expecting was for their food to be delicious too.  They've expanded their pastry selection that they serve at the truck and have added a small menu for breakfast and lunch.  I got the granola and yogurt, and it was hands down the best  granola I have ever had.  It's homemade, and has almonds, pistachios, honey, and they top it off with fresh pomegranate.  I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. \n\nWhat really sets Reveille apart from the rest is how nice the guys are that work there.  Not just polite and cordial, but actually friendly.  And they certainly aren't your average judgy hipsters that seem to work at most of the other fancy coffee shops in town.   It's 7:30am and I'm heading to work (yuck), I just got off Muni (double yuck), and I haven't had any coffee yet, so I  really appreciate it when the people at the coffee shop are friendly.    I have a feeling Reveille might become part of my morning routine.", "author": "Nicole G."}

Staff was very friendly and helped my date get a bag to keep his roasted beans dry while we braved the rain without an umbrella. I'm not a fancy coffee drinker so I was impressed with the coffee art.

Their Avocado Toast is phenomenal as are their chocolate chip cookies.\n\nThe reason I'm writing this (my first review ever) is due to the disappointment of them raising their prices. When I first started coming to Reveille about 6 months ago, a 12oz coffee was $2.50. Perfectly acceptable for a coffee. You could pay more for a pour-over if you wanted. Refills were $1.\n\nThen, maybe 2 months ago, prices went up. $2.75 for a 12oz and $1.75 for refills. Still, not too too bad. I'll accept paying more than Starbucks for good coffee.\n\nOn Tuesday, I walked into this location and saw that they finally created a 16oz cup! How exciting! When I asked how much that was, they said $3.50...eh, okay, not great, but oh well. I then asked for my 12oz cup and saw that they had upped the price again (within 2 months) to $3.00. $3.00 for a 12oz cup of coffee that's from a large thermos??\n\nNow again, I love my coffee and have no problem paying a premium for a good cup. However, Philz allows you to pick a roast and have them brew it for you right then and there charges $3 for a small and $4 for a large. The fact that Reveille is charging this price is simply disappointing, especially since it used to be $2.50 three months ago. \n\nI'll probably keep coming, though definitely less frequently. Jackson Place is still at $2.75 for a great pour-over, and the Philz Truck is nearby on Sansome.", "author": "Zack C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-10-10", "description": "When I worked on the same block, I really liked this place, and I'm definitely a picky eater.  They have very good coffee, consistently so.   I don't recall how many lattes I got from this place, and I don't really like to drink coffee unless I absolutely have to, but often times I ended up giving in.   Out of 20 or so lattes, pourovers, and whatever else I got drinkwise, all but one were excellent.  To be honest, I don't remember what the flavor profiles were like- it's been a year, but when I think of reveille, I think consummate professionalism and clean european aesthetic.   They also made a deliciously nutty hot chocolate with valrhona! of all things.  I really have nothing but good things to say about this place.   Even the servers that I knew didn't like me tried their best to hide it, but having been in various service industries for most of my life, I don't really expect everyone to treat me nicely or even engage me when they are working.\n\nOn to their food.   I had one bad thing at reveille, and I'll mention it first to get it out of the way.  It was a banh mi.   It cost normal 6 or 7 dollar prices, but it had a weird mayo that made it taste wrong.  I would have rather eaten a 3 dollar banh mi from chinatown, but at that point I'd already bit the bullet.   There were no pickles on it, and I think they subbed in some kind of coleslaw, but whatevs, it's your classic anglo american line cook experiment to make something that looks like \"ethnic\" food without knowing what the actual food contains.  But then again failing at banh mi is an actual fail.   It's carrot and daikon pickle, mayo, cilantro, jalapeno, (maybe some maggi), maybe fish sauce, and meat.   That's all folks.   Not hard to replicate, unless you wanna go through the trouble of making a pate, which to most american palates, is strange, so only a few people ever really bother with it.  So what I meant to say was, if it's not new american and it's on this menu, avoid it like the plague.\n\nEvery regular menu item they had was pretty much delicious across the board.  There was a persimmon quinoa salad with arugula and goat cheese vin.  SImple, stupidly delicious, and it used to be cheaper way back in the day.   The breakfast sandwich was really nice   I think it was basically an open faced egg in the hole with kale and bacon.   really good ingredients, good execution.    They had pretty excellent baked goods too- your classic chocolate chip with sea salt and the gooey inside, kougin amaan with chocolate (probably starter bakery). \n\nAnyway, the food gets a 7, the service gets an 8, the coffee gets a  9.5, and really, that's as good as you can really ask for in a coffee shop in this price range.   the west o branch of blue bottle is pretty on par with this, and that place is as professional and clean as you could hope for in a business.   Although blue bottle is more hipster friendly, when you think real hard about it, they're both in the same category.  And lest you think blue bottle suffers no missteps, saffron *cough* vanilla *cough* snickerdoodles *cough*  I'm looking at you.  No offense, Ms. Freeman, but saffron is such a clean flavor, and baking soda so forwardly alkaline- how could you hope to combine the two in a good way?", "author": "Zoobs L."}

Terrific brisket sandwich on crusty baguette with soft, gravy-soaked interior, whiffs of wasabi /horseradish, arugula, caramelized onion and black pepper. A nice tang but not a hint of jalape\u00f1o. And on the side, more of the arugula, with radish slices and a little tub of lemony vinaigrette. Four Barrel coffee, nice personnel, fast service and a clean contemporary interior with acres of windows to watch the Columbus action complete a favorable first impression.

(now, Little Vine's sandwiches are spendy but at least you get good value for the price.)\n\nthen, the turkey. a bite in, and both of us were, \"wtf?\" not turkey. it was some kind of fish thing, which we would have never ordered. turns out it was \"fish conserva,\" which, according to the menu posted at the store, included swordfish, olives, capers, and red onions. my husband felt sick from eating it. i ate mine, only because i was starving, and only because it didn't, thank christ, have the advertised red onions in it. (i guess they thought red peppers were close enough.)\n\nhere's the thing: when i'm paying $12 for a sandwich, i want it to be of value, either in terms of size or contents. and i want it to be presented as advertised. and finally, i want it to be the freakin' item i *ordered*. fail x 3. (and no, it was not possible for me to trek back to the cafe and say, ps: you gave me the wrong food. also, i know people make mistakes but the cafe was pretty empty so it's not like they were slammed with customers.)\n\nalso: the sandwiches came with a choice of a side. i ordered the farro and quinoa salads. the farro was bland, even though it came with some of my favorite ingredients (brussels sprouts and pumpkin seeds). there was also supposed to be yogurt in it, but good luck finding that. on the other hand, the quinoa salad, which  included persimmons and pine nuts, was fantastic. supposedly there was goat cheese in the dressing. couldn't tell, but perhaps that's what made it so delicious. unfortunately, portion size was again lame. the salad came in one of those small plastic containers that you get at the deli counter at whole foods, only it was half-filled. seriously chintzy.\n\non the plus side, the people who work there were very nice, and it's a beautiful space. but overall, a real disappointment, and at $23, a rip-off. i'd rather go to Station SF, where the food and coffee is fantastic and a much better value.", "author": "m r."}
