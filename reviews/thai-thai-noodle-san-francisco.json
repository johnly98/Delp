Great consistency and peanut flavor that wasn't too over whelming, jusssst right. \n\nNow on to the pad thai, let's talk about the good. The chicken was cooked right and so were the noodles.

I didn't have time to have them remake it so I ate it. The meal itself when it is not spicy is very OK. There could be a bit more food variety to it, but it is very good nonetheless.  \n\nThe service is pretty decent. Very quick at getting you sat down, drinks served, food ordered and served.

It's only a 15min drive and their is no traffic from there to here, especially on a Sunday!! \nSecond, no one should have to eat their order cold. Not one item I ordered was warm. Thank god I have a microwave other I would have been stuck with crap I couldn't enjoy!! I usually order the crab fried rice, pad see ew, Basil chicken and BBQ chicken over salad. BBQ chicken got me started while I was heating the other food. The marination wasn't so bad so I was grateful for that. But that's the only good thing I could say. The crab fried rice was ok, the basil chicken wasn't too shabby and the pad see ew was just bleh!!

Lately I've had the stewed chicken which was really amazing.\nStopped in tonight for the first time in a while. Seems the menu has changed somewhat but staff is mostly the same. Tried something I haven't had yet off the \"Dinner\" options, a chicken noodle curry dish to go.\nBAM. Opened this up at home and as usual was too hot to handle. Had to carefully pour the curry into a bowl so as not to burn myself. This, mind you, on the night of the highest temperature ever recorded in SF; an amazing and altogether not entirely pleasant 98 degrees or so at time of ordering, around 6:30 p.m.\nThis meal hit the nail on the head again, just as other meals have from here. Curry was beautiful; creamy, spicy and really nothing at all wrong with it. Noodles were cooked well and chicken was pleasant. \nI don't see how anyone can complain about this place. I've been to the Thai greats (Ben Thai, Ler Ros, etc.). Those places are great but you have to keep in mind the power of hype. Sometimes all you need is a really decent bowl of noodles or Thai dish.

I've also had the Pad See Ew and Pad Kee Mao.\n\nFor appetizers, I've tried the Por Sod Shrimp (fried shrimp rolls) - I'd need to have them again.  I think that a long time ago I had the Por Jay (vegetarian egg rolls).\n\nOverall, I think it's a good place.  It's also very conveniently located near home - but, I would definitely check it out and dine in their beautiful spot if you're looking for an excuse to come to this neighborhood.  I'm going to try some more things.", "author": "Adam S."}

Thai Thai has good prices so no complaints here.\n- Hot, hot food: Every time I've come, my noodles have been so hot that I had to wait until it cooled before I dug in.

The first thing I noticed was that the ingredients seemed very fresh, which is not a surprise as today was their grand opening, however kudos for that.  There was just enough duck in the soup and it was cooked perfectly.  The other ingredients were just as well done.  Sadly however, the broth was lacking in flavor or character.  It may take a few months before they really hone that broth flavor in.  Maybe they were a little too worried about overwhelming customers with the taste and decided to back it off?  I dunno, however, since the broth is really the rug that ties the soup together I have to deduct a couple stars. \n  \nBroth aside I am very excited that a new place has opened in the two block radius of Cala Foods.

Thai Thai Noodle, or TTN as it's henceforth going to be called, is a way more aesthetically-pleasing Thai restaurant than most of the other Thai restaurants located on every other block in this city. However, I was unable to experience it because I got my food to go. I think I'd enjoy the whole thing more if I ate in there with the cool modern, minimalist furniture. It's not Osha new-agey or anything. Just normal and nice and clean. Once that happens, I might be inclined to improve the rating, if it's still worth it.\n\nOnto the Pad Thai, which I feel is the most cliche dish to order but also the best barometer. I've definitely had better, as this version contained basically no vegetables (I appreciate a carrot or broccoli inclusion to help cut the grease), but this one earns stripes for including bean sprouts and peanuts on the side. I also ended up eating an order of egg rolls, which were surprisingly light and noodle-filled. I'll be back here, hopefully with time to sit down and a star to add. I have to try the yellow curry, after all.", "author": "Stefanie L."}

Unfortunately I did not have enough cash on me (who carries cash these days?), and had to order more than I wanted to ($10 minimum).  In not reading the menu well, I assumed the shrimp roll was in fact a shrimp spring roll (for $8), so I used my debt card as payment and ordered extra (on their menu is a \"veggie\" spring roll - so I assumed they also had a \"shrimp\" spring roll).\n\nIn waiting for my order I anticipated the fresh shrimp spring roll with its tasty basil, bean sprouts, carrots and rice noodles dipped into a peanut sauce, and was fine with extra order (wasn't worried about eating extra calories as spring rolls are virtually caloric free); and yeah, $8.00 is a bit much for a shrimp spring roll, but I'm a sucker, what can I say; I was hungry.\n\nWhile at home I opened up the greasy box and unfortunately to my surprise I found greasy shrinked up shrimp rolls that were completely tasteless (except for the grease) YUK!  I was totally not prepared for this and very disappointed.  Needless to say, I checked their online menu (which I noted each items prices to be $1.00 more than their actual restaurant menu prices (?)) and what do you know, there at the bottom of the appetizers listed \"Shrimp Rolls = Marinated shrimp wrapped in egg roll wrapper, served with sweet and sour sauce.\"  I suppose I should have intuitively known it was FRIED - but I didn't.  Shame on me; but really, if the item is fried, ALL restaurants should put \"deep fried\" in the description as some of us are health conscious and avoid fried foods as if it were a death sentence.\n\nAs previously mentioned the Shrimp was so deeply fried I could not taste the \"marinated\" part an the shrimp was barely there (tasteless).  \n\nLastly, the Beef Soup was perfectly portioned and the broth/beef was tasty - so this was a plus.  I will certainly order from Thai Thai again, of course, with cash in hand and will also scrutinize the menu better.", "author": "Cris B."}

At four (not too steep) blocks away, Thai Thai Noodle was the choice.\n\nThe restaurant has about a dozen or so tables, and I was able to score one with a window view. Service was very quick and very efficient: I had water and a menu about five seconds after I sat down.

The sauce was wonderful, with a nice kick from the sweet chili. The chicken was breaded, which surprised me a bit, and started out okay but lost its crispiness the longer it sat in the sauce. The white onions and green peppers stayed nice and crispy, and the only thing the dish lacked was enough cashews (I don't consider five enough when the dish has \"cashew\" in the title).\n\nOverall, though, very good experience, and my taste buds (and wallet) were very happy with my choice.

Everything we had was made with good veggies, meat, starches but it fell short on flavor but just barely. \n\nChicken Satay - juicy and tender meat. Not enough curry on the meat.\n\nFried Chicken Wings - I thought they that were really overcooked but my husband really liked them. I'd pass on them but that's me.\n\nPad Kee Mow - good amount of noodles to veggie, not too greasy but it needed salt and maybe some lime and spice. easy to fix with table condiments but still...\n\nCrab Fried Rice - Also lacking in flavor but this time it worked. the flavor of the rice was so mild that you could really taste the crab flavor.  the rice was really fluffy and there were nice chunks of crab meat throughout. \n\nI may give it another try, being so close to my place but I think that Little Thai and Modern Thai are better.", "author": "Kiristen R."}

Their pad Thai is like an antidepressant, their panang curry is like a woman, their Tom Yum is like a warm embrace and their vegetarian egg rolls are everything you could possibly imagine and more. They also have a million vegetarian options, great service and after dinner candies. All they need is a liquor license. \n\nI am very happy that Thai Thai moved into my neighborhood, and it won't be long before people start catching on, but at least I said it first (or sixteenth rather). \n\nI recommend that you stop what you are doing go there right now.", "author": "Ian T."}

I'm closer to the 3.5 star range, but since no halves, I'll go with 4 stars. The prices are good and it's decent enough to keep me going back time after time. They do not take any plastic for orders under $15 so make sure you have cash if you are not ordering a lot. They are open until 12am everyday so that's always nice when you need somewhere to eat late.", "author": "Nicole S."}

It was well past midnight in Russian Hill, so there weren't too many choices. We were already in our pajamas, so we refused to venture out on a random food hunt. Luckily, we found this place on Yelp and ordered for delivery. We imagined that a lot of intoxicated people would be keeping them busy at that hour. To our surprise, the food was overall pretty good and the delivery was 20 minutes quicker than they had promised.\n\nAs mentioned by our other fellow Yelpers, the portions were indeed very generous. Here's a list of what we ordered:\n-Tofu pad thai \nThis is our default choice at any Thai restaurant. Unfortunately, it very dry and bland. The lime it came with was also very dry. Then again, maybe it was because we had it delivered.\n-Chicken kao tom \nIt was described to be light and perfect for late night. Plus, we selected this because it was the first item in the chef's special section. We initially saw it as a very plain and simple dish: rice, broth, and some meat. However, we saw how it deserved to be on the chef's list; it was delicious! Rice with soup and VERY tasty ground chicken balls =  very comforting to sleep right afterwards without feeling gross.  \n-Tofu Kaw Soi \nWe randomly picked this because the description didn't sound like a standard Thai dish. It was a mixture of egg noodles of two kinds, crispy and thin / soft. You drench it in a flavorful light curry. It was pretty good. \n\nWe highly recommend the latter two.\n\nYAY! =D", "author": "Kathy H."}

I think it's the Kee Mao that I really like; they use the biggest sheets of rice noodle that I've seen so far in a restaurant, which is fun.  \n\nThey gave us a dessert that was really good, although I haven't checked to see if it was on the menu.  There was an opaque white jello (Probably made of seawood jello, called agar.

I suspect that it is some sort of sweet root vegetable like sweet potato/yam and not actually pumpkin but it takes away from what would otherwise be very good veggie samusas and fried veggie spring rolls.  Other than that they are awesome.  They are open late, have reasonable prices, decent food, the place is clean, staff is very friendly and helpful, AND they deliver.  Since I work graveyard in the financial district good food after about 10pm is hard to come by down here and the fact that they deliver to me at work makes them AWESOME.  Also, just now, I called and placed an order for delivery TWO MINUTES before their scheduled closing time and they said no problem.  That's why I am writing this review right now!
