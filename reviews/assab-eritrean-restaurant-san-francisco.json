Now Eritrean cuisine is technically not Ethiopian as they are neighboring countries, but to this ethnically challenged, Bourdain wannabe layman, they appear to be pretty close in flavor and execution. It all starts with the injera, the spongey, sourdough-risen flatbread which is usually both rolled up in a basket and serves as an edible platter for all the goodies on top of it (photo: http://bit.ly/2pwuVrk). I happened upon this spot on Geary after a Kaiser appointment one evening last week.\n\nIt was pretty empty at around 8PM with just one young couple at a table next to the window. The host let me sit anywhere, so I helped myself to a large table near the takeout window. There were quite a few temptations in the menu both carnivorous and vegetarian. I indulged a bit and ordered the $14.95 Vegetarian Sampler. It was quite an extravaganza with eight different items on the large sheet of injera (photo: http://bit.ly/2pxZwon). There was the Vegetable Alicia, a combination of potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, and cabbage lightly seasoned. Then there was both okra and zucchini in tomato sauce.\n\nThey also added Shiro, ground chickpeas cooked with onions and tomatoes; Bersin, which were mildly seasoned lentils; and stewed spinach and collard greens. A small dollop of yogurt and a small salad of lettuce and tomatoes completed the set, which turned out to be generous since the menu lists only three items in the sampler. Delicious and hearty with plenty of variety. No fork please as it requires tearing into the injera to scoop up the goodness. Had I known I was getting that much food, perhaps I wouldn't have ordered the $2.75 bowl of Lentil Soup, which again was a generous serving and also quite warming and filling (photo: http://bit.ly/2G0jsKY). Ah, so this is Eritrean food.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...quite a potpourri of Eritrean delights on that addicting injera\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...simple, sparse and a bit dark\nSERVICE - 4 stars...a very attentive host\nTOTAL - 4 stars...now I know what Eritrean cuisine is", "author": "Ed U."}

After taking our guests to The Japanese Tea Garden and then on a Red and White Fleet boat ride around the bay, we capped off our day with a dinner here at Assam.  The service was nice and friendly.  We were very hungry, so I ordered a LOT...  a veggie combo plus three extra veggie dishes.  I loved the okra one and the mushrooms were heavenly spicy... gotta love that berbere spice!  The injera was dark and tangy.  We got more, but then ended up with some left over.  Everyone ate and ate until they could eat no more.  It was a feast.  While we were there, the restaurant filled up until every seat was taken.  Nice to see a family restaurant with a loyal following.  There seemed to be a good deal of first dates there!

The only two that were different were the (bitter) greens and carrots/potatoes. The veggies in some of the other dishes were greasy/slippery, not the feeling you want.

I can comfortably say this is probably one of the most pleasing ways to have a meal with a friend or better yet four. In a world of germaphobes having a place to eat with your hands is such a nice change. Frankly if I could do it every day without being frowned upon I would. \n\nThe restaurant is small but roomy. It was quiet that night but only because of the rain that came down. When we arrived we were the first customers of the night. The couple who runs the place took turns serving us and were so attentive to our needs. I felt like I was being cared for by my own parents. The menu is pretty straight forward. Order and item or two and share away on a giant plate of Injera bread (think doughy pancake with a sourdough flavor) topped with whatever you ordered. This time we went with the lamb and the beef (Kitfo). Kitfo as I was told is probably their most popular dish and I immediately tasted why. Along with our meals we had honey wine and some hot tea. \n\nAfter the meal we were absolutely full but it was a comfortable full. The only thing that would have made the night better was if they had a couch and a fireplace where we could relax and hang out with the owners a bit more. I look forward to making this a regular stop in my eating rotation. If you haven't tried Eritrean or anything like it stop into Assab and they'll make you feel right at home.", "author": "Joco F."}

For me, I'm a big fan of it either but I'm a big fan of the social experience eating with our hands with our trusted friends.  To be honest, you'll more likely to remember the experience and the spicy (or non-spicy) items on top of the injera than the actual taste of injera unless you're eating the injera straight up without any toppings.\n\nTo plan your next visit, bring only your cleanest friends or coworkers.  You wouldn't want to bring a coworker that doesn't wash their hands when they use the bathroom.  Second, decide on the toppings.  The meat and veggie platters are a great way to taste the various different toppings.

This place had the least seasoning of any Eritrean restaurant I have ever been too. I ordered my food extra spicy - oh well, that didn't happen. They didn't have the spicy shaker of yummy seasonings available and salt did little to help the situation, but would have improved the lentils vastly had they been cooked with salt added.", "author": "Mush S."}

I really like the flexibility, pouroseness, and tenderness of the traditional flatbread. \n\nThe dishes are quite mouthwatering and hearty. The owners use clarified butter to cook up the goodness. If you do not typically consume a lot of oily foods, be prepared for some strange stomach noises to follow your dining experience. My bf and I were serenated by our singing tummies for hours. \n\nThe restaurant is very small but cozy. We were one of about 4 parties there on a Monday evening.

It was only 2 of us and we couldnt finish the whole plate. Along with your order of entrees they give you soft spongy bread to eat with the food. The food was AMAZING~~~~!! The beef was so tender, the chicken too and they were all delicately seasoned with spice and herbs and not tooo salty or too spicy. everything was right as i have imagined it to be. nothing felt over greasy. \n\nWill definitely come here again soon, anytime i am craving for some good ethnic food!!

One of my friends mentioned this place was near his house, so I decided hey why not try something new.  We ordered the Zigni (beef) and the Kelwa Derho (chicken) to share.  The servings are big and it just makes sense to eat family style.  Both dishes were well seasoned (I asked for spicy, but you can choose your spice level).  Having to eat with your hands and the dish being fairly saucy, it was a mess, luckily they are generous with the napkins!  But the food was delicious, and the server (I suspect he may be the owner as well) was awesome and attentive.  Gave us recommendations, which turned out to be great.  I also tried the honey wine which I highly recommend.  It was a very different taste for a wine, but I enjoyed it and am now on the hunt for a bottle (go figure). \n\nAll in all food was really good, service was great, and bonus easy to find parking in the neighborhood.

It is minimally decorated, but it's the food I want!! \n\nWe ordered the zigni, kelwa, kelwa mix, lentils, okra, kantisha, and gored-gored. That was admittedly too much for three people, but everything sounded so delicious. AND IT WAS. ALL OF THEM WERE. Now, I've done this before -- a rookie mistake -- and eat so much of the injera before we eat the sopped-up injera infused with all the flavors on what's on top... that I leave no room at the end to enjoy that part. Womp womp. Make sure you do that! As the server said to us (and looking at our faces of simultaneous pleasure and regret from eating so much): \"You didn't leave room for the best part!\" I know.

We ordered both the vegetable and meat samplers, and all the items were good, most were great!  \n\nFor those not familiar with this type of food, the different mixtures are served on a large plate of injera which is a sourdough flatbread and they are eaten with your hands.  All the orders will be put on one plate, so if you are with a group of people just understand that each person's order will be on this one plate.  This makes for a unique dining experience where everyone can easily try all the different items and bond over the good cuisine and method of eating. Just don't lick your fingers! \n\nFinally, though I read some people had issues with service, we went as a group of 5 when the medium-sized restaurant was full and had no issues with wait time for our meal/order or service.  The staff was very friendly and checked on us frequently to make sure our food was good and our drinks were full. The only thing keeping it from being a 5 star joint is the very casual atmosphere, like a mom and pop shop. Overall definitely worth trying!", "author": "Puja C."}

Their kelwa derho, chicken, is beautifully spiced and balanced and though they describe it as \"spicy,\" is actually a gorgeous blend of flavors, especially when mixed with the yogurt, which I get more of as a side dish. My sister in law, who is more of a vegetarian, loves their kantisha and bersin, mushrooms and lentils of two different varieties. It's a ton of fun to sit on the floor and eat with hands, takes me back to my childhood when we had no cutlery, as Indian immigrants and that's what we did as an Indian family: eat with our hands, the first tools we were born with :-) Did I mention their service is super warm and friendly, the prices right, and the ambience perfect for the cuisine.", "author": "Ranjan P."}

Actually, it nearly happened when I visited LA - some groceries there have Eritrean / Ethiopian premade and boxed.\n\nMeanwhile, in SF, I've been to this restaurant at least three times over the years. It's always been with a group, and it's always been as much about sharing conversation as it's been about sharing food. The assortment we shared this time was lamb, raw beef, pork-something, meat combo (sampler of three set items), and okra. You know anywhere I see okra I have to order it.\n\nIt took a while between ordering and receiving our food. I think this was less about the amount of other diners present and more about fixing up the items for all five of us before being able to bring out the communal plate. My friends who had never eaten African food initially thought the servings looked small, but they were all stuffed before the plate was cleared.\n\nAll together, the 5 items, a bottle of Eritrean honey wine, and 4 beverages came out to just over $30 per person.

My friends and I ordered chicken, beef and okra, and our plate was full of chickpeas, collard greens and other veggies on the side.  The injera bread is soft and moist.  It costs extra to order more, and you will definitely need at least one extra order.  But injera does fill up the belly pretty fast so I can't imagine ordering more than two..\n\nThe space is small, so my friends and I waited about an hour...

I don't think it makes for a good date night as if it wasn't clear by now, Eritrean food is eaten with your hands and can be quite messy.\n\nFood: 4 stars. Flavorful. We ordered both the meat and vegetarian sampler. All the dishes were good, I found each one to be well prepared, I suppose the lamb and okra dishes stood out. On the downside, the meal is very rich and salty. No acids to cut the oiliness, even the yogurt, while tasty was full fat and more like whipped cream.\n\nInjera: 3 stars. The injera gets a separate review because it's such a staple of Eritrean cuisine. Like other people have mentioned, it's thinner and less sour than at other places. It has the consistency of a crepe. They serve the injera with the food on top and you also get a side of it. The problem is that the injera under the food is completely covered making it soggy and difficult to pick up. Other places tend to leave about 1/2 of the pancake exposed, without any food on top for this reason. The side of injera is nice, but there are no free refills and you only get one pancake. \n\nService/Atmosphere: 2.5 stars. The decor, dishware and overall ambiance leaves a lot to be desired. It's has a very local, divey kind of vibe. Music playing was really bad. Service is sparse and lacks for conversation. No explanation of what was given to us.\n\nPrice: 2.5 stars. All of the dishes are over $12, we paid $14 and $16 for the samplers. This was too much. Yes, the portion sizes were big, but they were too big. There was enough food for 4. I would have liked to have seen a reduction in price and portion size by about 1/3, even 1/2. Eritrean food is not good take-home material so don't think you can make up for it by getting a doggy bag.\n\nMy final gripe and this may be all Eritrean restaurants, is if I'm going to eat with my hands, I'd really like to be given something to wash with after (and preferably before as well!). A hot cloth or bowl of lemon water would be a REALLY good idea don't you think? More napkins too please.\n\nWhile the food was delicious, the price, atmosphere, service and other issues I mentioned add up to me not coming back.

It's a good one to order if you never had Ethiopian food cause it gives you a taste of everything.  My favorite was this one spicy beef, the yogurt, potato, zucchini, okra, and chicken was also good too.  Not entirely know what the names are though. They were all full of delicious flavor.  BUT, the yogurt & spicy beef was my favorite for some reason. YUM YUM YUM. Goes hand in hand.\n\nThe one thing I didn't like was the injera (ethiopian bread).  I was NOT a fan of the injera.  It was too spongy to eat for me.  I wished I had something else than scooping the food with the injera.\n\nService = Ok. There was only one girl serving all the full tables there.  Give her credit for that.\n\nIndia Pale Ale (IPA) = was really good and refreshing, go try it!\n\nDespite my dislike of the injera, I loved all the flavors.  Go try it yourself! Everyone should try Ethiopian food, one time or another.", "author": "Jennifer K."}

As soon as I take the first bite I enter into some kind of state of...I don't even know what. It definitely releases endorphins. \nTo be fair, I've only tried two dishes here, but one is the meat combo, which is made of several dishes. The meat combo includes includes Zigni, Tsebhi Derho, and Alicha Beggee. All of them are really good, and its a LOT of food. The menu says its for one, but for me its enough for 3-4 meals (keep in mind that I'm small). So delicious AND cost efficient. The second things I've tried is the Kitfo (raw). Some of the best Kitfo I've ever had. The texture, temperature, and spices were perfect. I also liked that they give options for how to have it cooked (raw, medium rare etc) which isn't always an options at other places. \nOnly two downsides- the last couple of times I've tried to call ahead for take out they haven't answered the phone, but when I got there they were open. The other thing is that their Shiro is just good, not great. A little runnier than what I'm used. In my opinion Shiro is very, very important. So I give them 4.75, which isn't an option on Yelp and might as well be rounded up to 5 stars anyway, so yay 5 stars!!", "author": "Dana C."}

Frankly, Eritrean food is quite different if you've never had it before.\n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant, I was surprised to see that some of the meat entrees could be prepared \"raw\". I normally don't get anything less cooked than a medium rare. To my horror, my friend ordered us RAW \"Kitfo\" to share. \n\nWhen the food arrived, it looked strangely appetizing and a little like baby food. However,  I was still a bit doubtful about its flavor. After witnessing my friend happily grab his first bite, I decided it couldn't be too bad. It was weird grabbing the meat (or anything else) with the piece of bread. Everything was cooked until it was very soft, even mushy. \n\nTo my surprise, the first bite (of the meat) wasn't bad.. it was actually pretty good. I proceeded with a second bite of the next closest colorful pile of mush on the plate.. then the next.. then the next. The meat, the greens, as well as the curry-like paste.. the whole dish was delicious and packed with flavor! My only complaint was that it was quite spicy. It might be hard for some to cope with, though I'm sure you could request for it to be more mild. Serving size was great as well, the two of us couldn't finish all the food. Unfortunately we couldn't box anything. By the time we were finished, a decent amount of the foods had already soaked into the bread making it soggy. \n\nService was also decent. I didn't experience the long wait time other reviewers mentioned, but maybe because it wasn't at all crowded in the restaurant.\n\nAnyways, came in a bit surprised, but left with my stomach happy.

It's not that I was ever scared to try Ethiopian; instead, I'm blaming it on my own laziness and desires to stick to my 'comfort-foreign' foods like Thai or Indian. \n\nAssab is not fancy nor does it claim to be-- it definitely feels like a family-owned business. Busy but not overwhelmingly so, the crowd was a mix of ages and ethnicities, including several parties with small children, who were all welcomed. \n\nMy boyfriend and I both started with glasses of honey wine and veggie sambusas. The wine tasted a bit foreign at first-- a bit dry but with a sweet, honeyed finish. The sambusas were similar to a samosa in concept and texture, but were flat little rectangles instead of puffy.\n\nThe two of us ordered three veggie entrees, which we had served 'family style' aka all of it was served on a giant plate. We had the Shiro (chickpeas), Kantisha (Mushrooms) and the veggie combo, which gave us okra, zucchini and alicha (potatoes/carrots). It was served with lentils on the plate, as well as some dollops of yogurt, and of course, our utensils: the injera bread. Slightly sour but very spongy, we were served the perfect amount of injera to scoop and sop up the various vegetables and stews. My favorite was the Shiro, as the chickpeas were mashed and served in a tangy tomato stew. The flavors were a nice mix of familiar yet new. Also, the serving plate is lined with a large piece of injera, so all of the stews soak into the bread. Our server told us it was the best part. A bit soggy, but yes, all of the flavors had indeed soaked into the injera. We were a bit too full to enjoy much of the bottom layer though.\n\nThe service here was great-- the food came out rather quick and several people asked us if we were enjoying the meal. While we definitely got plenty of food, most entrees are over $10 each. Added up with appetizer and honey wine, we easily spent over $80 for two people. Not overly expensive, but if you're coming in expecting to pay hole-in-the-wall type prices, you're mistaken. But in the end, you're rewarded with quality Ethiopian food and experiences, which will satisfy both first-timers and veterans alike.", "author": "Bryan B."}

A key difference from other restaurants of the same type is you have the option of sharing one large injera bread with multiple dishes on it with others in your party or getting an individual one for yourself with the entree dish you choose.  Each entree dish comes with lentils, salad and homemade yogurt as accompaniments.  We had 6 of us and each had different dishes and all were full of great flavors and spices, with sizeable quantities of food and we each got an additional injera bread which we all needed to mop everything up.  The homemade yogurt was delicious and acted as a great digestive.  The deserts looked very good but we didn't have room to enjoy them.

While it's not located on the main drag in Laurel Heights, this means it's easier to get parking. Still, it was a bit dark and isolated in the area. However, when you walk in, the service is extremely welcoming and warm. I wouldn't call the restaurant upscale, but more comfortable. There were clearly quite a few regulars inside - always a good sign.\n\nWe split a large vegetable combination platter, and asked if we could design our own second combination platter, including shiro, spinach and bersin. (Note - you cannot include mushrooms in any combination platter, it can only be ordered as its own dish). The platter came out quite fast (within 10-15 minutes), and was gigantic and delicious. So much flavor (and spice!) in every bite. My boyfriend commented he hadn't been able to find any Ethiopian food in the city that was this authentic/tasty. \n\nI wouldn't break down each piece of the platter (as the flavors meld together quite nicely with the combined way they serve them), but suffice it to say everything had quite a heat to it, while maintaining the purity of the vegetable - so you really knew what you were tasting in each bite (okra, spinach, potato, etc.). The yogurt they serve in the middle of the platter was a nice complement to all of the heat, really cooling nicely. The injera it was all served on was spongy and soft, yet held up nicely to all of the heavy sauces, which made it a great vessel for all of the food. We also ordered a side of the yogurt, and it was quite thick and tangy - exactly what you'd expect from a homemade version.\n\nOverall, the meal was about $40, including tip, which I thought was quite a good deal for all of the food we got - we left quite full!

I live in LA now and once tried one of the supposedly best Ethiopian restaurants in Little Ethiopia here. In my opinion, said restaurant's food does not even come close to Assab. On a recent visit, I told these exact praises to the owner--he was extremely humble, explaining that he encourages people to explore different restaurants of the same cuisine, even if you're in love with a particular dish at one specific restaurant. i.e., I am in love with Assab's kantisha (mushrooms), but that shouldn't bar me from trying kantisha at another Eritrean restaurant (should they have it). I think the owner was basically saying that different places might have different renditions of Eritrean and Ethiopian food, but in a good way, so don't close yourself off to the possibilities. While I appreciated his modesty, I know a good thing when I taste it: Assab is still the best in my book, and probably always will be. Out of nowhere, I sometimes find myself craving Assab's spicy dishes and their mouth-poppingly delicious flavors soaked up in that soft, spongy injera (shoveled straight from plate to mouth with my own fingers, of course).

For some reason, instead of doing my own investigating, I believed them. But I am here to tell you that people are wrong! Assab was absolutely delicious. I would have given it four stars, but the quantities were pretty small for a fairly high price.\n\nTwo of us split:\n#8 Alicha-Beggee ($12.95) - mild seasoned cubes of lamb mixed with potatoes, carrots, and bell peppers. This was really good, I wish there had been more of it.\n\n#5 Kelwa-Derho ($12.95) - chunks of chicken breast sauteed with butter, hot peppers, jalapenos, onions, and tomatoes. This was OK, but compared to the lamb it was pretty boring. \n\nWe also each ordered a glass of honey wine, which (surprise surprise) turned out to be too sweet for both of us.\n\nLike all Ethiopian places, instead of forks, they gave each of us one piece of the injera to use as a vehicle for the food. One piece is definitely not enough unless you really ration your injera, but unfortunately they charge $.75 for every additional injera. \n\nAlthough Assab didn't blow my mind, it's definitely a solid choice if you're looking for Ethiopian/Eritrean food.", "author": "Talia G."}

Based on the name, I assume that the cuisine is Eritrean but everything on the menu seemed similar enough to Ethiopian that most dishes seemed familiar, including the spongy, sour flat bread.\n\nThis place is conveniently walking distance of The Bridge theater on Geary.   My friend and I came in from the rain and were warmly welcomed by the staff.  Throughout the night, the entire restaurant was served by one woman and she was always smiling and very helpful in helping us choose what dishes to order.   \n\nBecause of my intense hatred of cilantro, it is a habit of mine to always ask if it is used in any particular dishes or as a garnish.  Imagine my surprise and joy when she replied that the chef has an allergy to cilantro and it is NEVER used in their food.  \"No Cilantro.  Ever.\"  is a mantra close to my heart and music to my ears; this restaurant has endeared itself to me forever. \n\nThe food?  Very good. We chose to share the vegetarian sampler and also the potato dish. I am sensitive to very spicy food and was pleased that the food was mild yet intensely flavored.  For those looking to set your mouth on fire, this place might not be for you. I chose to drink beer (Anchor Steam, I think) so I can't comment on the beverage menu.  \n\nBottom line, if you are in throwing distance of the Bridge and would like to get dinner to round out your evening, the food and the service is well worth it and both are solid 4 stars.  I'm adding a 5th star for being awesomely cilantro-free.", "author": "Courtney Y."}

Now being an idiot that I am, I cannot tell you if the difference between Ethiopian or Eritrean food; however, they seem similar in taste and presentation so comparison to Ethiopian food was how I based my review of their food. \n\nOur group of 6 all got an ordered an entr\u00e9e and decided to get it family style, which consisted of a large bowl in the center of our table with a layer of Injera housing our entr\u00e9e orders of salad, meats, yogurt, chickpeas/lentils and greens. I remind you that this is not a restaurant you want to surprise your group of friends to, because some may get persnickety about eating with your hands; you also want to be sure people wash their hands and get under their fingernails when eating family style. \n\nThe injera is a soft and spongy flatbread in a usage similar to a tortilla or naan and a-bit sour to the palate. They give a decent size piece of injera on your plate and you are more than welcome to eat the one in the bowl as it sops up all the flavors of your entrees. \n\nThe cubed skinless chicken breast were succulent and rich and was the most mild of the dishes even when it was paired with the saut\u00e9ed peppers and jalapenos. The lamb was seasoned spicy and was flavorful with the injera sourness. The beef was also seasoned spicy but was a nice smooth texture paired with injera. \n\nOverall the selection for food we had was delicious and I would come back for that reason alone. The wait staff was not lenient in alteration of the menu when ordering and they were not too fluent in English, which made it difficult understanding the menu for my table companions. Food was generally spicy, so those with a sensitive palate may find themselves struggling; I only know I had an amazing meal. Luckily as a walk-in on a weekend late in the afternoon we were able to get a table immediately. \n\nWith the other reviews on hand, I will be back and try the Honey Wine everyone is raving about.", "author": "Casey L."}

For me, Assab was just an \"ok\" experience. \n\nFamily style is definitely the way to go when you're eating Ethiopian/Eritrean.  The two of us ordered a spicy chicken dish and a lamb dish family style.  The two entrees come out on a single platter just the way I like it, accompanied with beans, lentils, a dollop of yogurt, and a small salad.  The lamb tasted especially good. \n\nThe cons of our experience - the entree portions were too small and there wasn't enough meat in each to make up for the $13 price.  Also, the entrees come with a set amount of injera, which was enough for me - but if you need more they charge extra. \n\nWhile this was a good experience (and the owner was really nice), the food and atmosphere did not compare to Cafe Colucci in Oakland.  For me, Colucci continues to set the standard as having the best injera, delicious meat entrees, and perfect accompanying side dishes.", "author": "Kimya P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-04", "description": "Disclaimer: This review is going to start with one of those \"I had XYZ life experience(s) that thus makes me qualified to judge the quality and authenticity of this lesser-known ethnic cuisine\". If you hate it when people say things like that, you might want to skip the intro to this review.\n\nI haven't lived in Eritrea or Ethiopia but I have been enjoying the food from this region since I was a teen. (It's not hard when you grow up in what is arguably the most multicultural city in the world.) It is one of my favorite cuisines and I have eaten it in many of the major cities in North America. For the last few years, I've worked for a global non-profit that does humanitarian work in Ethiopia. Many of my colleagues were Ethiopian and, let's just say, if you're a foodie like me, you can't help but learn a lot about authentic Ethiopian/Eritrean food (and get to sample homemade stuff at company potlucks--mmmm!)\n\nSo there. My qualifications.\n\nAssab Eritrean Restaurant is around 3.5 stars for food quality, but I gave it that extra half star for exceptional service (details to follow). My friend organized a group dinner here before her big trip to London so our party of 8 was the largest party in the restaurant. We started with meat sambusas, which are essentially fritters stuffed with seasoned ground beef. The shell was a nice crisp texture, but the meat was bland and dry. Definitely not enough seasoning. It was also incredibly oily so be careful when you're eating it.\n\nFor the main dinner, we ordered:\n\n- Kitfo: Ground beef sauteed with clarified butter and seasoned hot peppers, topped with homemade cottage cheese. We got it medium because my friend didn't want to get food poisoning before her trip, but I highly recommend ordering this rare if you can.\n\n- Zigni & Okra Mix: Cubed beef simmered with clarified butter, onions, tomatoes, and seasoned hot pepper, served with yogurt\n\n- Alicha Beggee: Cubed, mildly-seasoned lamb shank simmered with potatoes, carrots and bell peppers\n\n- Tsebhi Derho: Skinless chicken legs and or thighs on the bone simmered with clarified butter, onions, tomatoes, seasoned hot pepper and yogurt\n\nThe Kitfo was tasty but lacking in spices. The Zigni was delicious but there definitely wasn't enough okra. I loved the Alicha Beggee and the lamb jus over the vegetables, but this is definitely not a dish for those who don't like lamb because the seasoning does not even begin to cover up that taste. The Tsebhi Derho was fall-off-the-bone (literally) tender and the obvious favorite in our group. Our meal came with complimentary helpings of collard greens and lentils, conveniently placed in four spots along the injera so that everyone could reach some. The injera itself was generous in portion but a bit too soggy. I think they needed to use more teff.\n\nOK, so the service. Initially, I was put off by our brusque, grumpy server. He was the only one working so service was very, very slow (the restaurant was mostly full). However, about 20 minutes into our dinner, in a fit of gesticulating excitement, I accidentally knocked over my nearly-full glass of honey wine (splashing some of it onto my poor boyfriend). Our waiter immediately appeared with napkins and cloths to wipe up the mess and cheerfully waved away my attempts to help, reassuring me in a light, jolly tone that it was okay and he'd take care of it. He left and re-appeared with another glass of honey wine. It was a very generous pour and easily twice as much as I had spilled. He left it with me with a joke that next time, if I didn't like it, I should just send it back instead of spilling it on my boyfriend. So....yeah. Service good.\n\nNow, some words of advice for the uninitiated:\n\n- Ethiopian/Eritrean food is always eaten with your hands so be prepared\n- Injera is sour, spongey and soft. It's unlike any bread known to the Western world so please don't walk in expecting baguettes or naan or that soft, sweet Asian white bread\n- Main dishes/stews served on injera are always packed with exotic spices so your hands will smell for hours after, no matter how many times you wash them\n- Ethiopian/Eritrean food is NOT Indian food, it's NOT Moroccan food, it's NOT Bengali/Sri Lakan/Pakistani/Burmese/Nepalese food so please ignore anyone who tells you it is because they're wrong and if you believe them, you're just going to be disappointed. There are certainly culinary influences and shared spices, but it is very much its own unique cuisine\n- Honey wine is delicious and the perfect complement, so definitely try it if you can (though I don't think Assab's is the best honey wine I've ever had)\n\nHappy eating!", "author": "Josephine L."}

A woman asked if we had a reservation, which was rather surprising since I didn't realize you needed a reservation here.  We said no and she seemed pissed.  She walked away, so we just stood there looking dumbfounded.  Eventually another woman asked us to come take a seat at an empty table she was preparing.  Important to note that there were in fact 3 or 4 other empty tables.  \n\nThis woman was MUCH nicer than the other one.  We ordered one of the cubed beef dishes (not sure which one), one of the lamb dishes (again, not sure) and the shiro (chickpeas) for the 3 of us to share. \n\nI never had Ethiopian food, but knew that it was served on bread and you eat with your hands.  It came out on a giant platter and everyone gets their own individual injera (the spongy bread).  \n\nWe dug in like the hungry pigs that we were and it was absolutely delicious and FUN to eat.  Yes, eating with ones hand is quite the novelty these days.  Make sure everyone at the table washes their hands, because this shit gets messy.  \n\nThe chickpeas, although really mushy, was my favorite.  It was super flavorful and blended well with the other items on the plate.  There were pickled veggies and other greens that I couldnt identify but tasted really good.  The beef was really tasty, although the lamb was a little too spicy for my taste.  \n\nIt may not seem like a ton of food, it really does fill you up.  I think the bread expands in your stomach, so be careful not to overeat or you'll feel like you're about to explode.  \n\nAlso, avoid the honey wine - its way too sweet.  Better offer getting a beer here.  Would definitely come back here again if in the area.  The food was awesome and the price was affordable.", "author": "Jaci H."}

Shortly after the restaurant cleared out at once and we were able to get a larger table. \n\nOnce seated we went over the menu and attempted to order. 2 of us just wanted soup and drinks, 1 wasn't eating and the other 2 ordered full entrees. The waiter (pretty sure he was also the owner) looked so clearly irritated with our order, rolled his eyes and flat out said that was unacceptable. He said it was a waste of their time to have a table that only had 2 entrees ordered. We were shocked and not at all understanding that he was trying to tell us to leave so a woman came up to explain it more clearly. The restaurant was 80% empty and yet they were still turning away our business, which still would have been at least $60. The woman said they were expecting larger parties and they would rather wait than serve us. For the record we are not riff-raff or young teens, we are grown adults that are clearly not homeless and would have been paying customers. \n\nI don't know if this is common practice for this restaurant or if for some reason they just didn't like our multi-cultural group either way I will never ever return and hope that other patrons do not support a business that operates in such a manner.", "author": "Michelle B."}

Well now the opportunity has presented itself and my sis and I went there this past Friday on a a date.\n\nI loved the decor, feels authentic and homey. Another plus is the tables are not sandwiched, so you don't feel like you're having dinner with the table next to you.  This is definitely a good place for a date, not too loud or fancy.  Only drawback is its PRICEY.  Which is unfortunate because I would like to come here just as much as I went to Massawa, but I cannot  afford it.  $15 for the vegetable platter is a bit steep, $12-13 is plenty.\n\nAnother, pitfall was the injera was little on the thin side which made it hard to eat with my hands...which is the whole point, NO SPOONS PLEASE.

I visit this place every-time I am in SF, been there about half a dozen times. I am usually very difficult to upset. I can put up with a lot of nonsense without being flustered. Poor service by a servers rarely upsets me-they are people and they have their bad days and I always give them benefit of doubt. This time at Assab was different.\nOn all previous occasions, the service was slow and the servers indifferent, unhelpful and often plain rude- I accepted it as an eccentricity of this restaurant. \nYesterday, I called in for a table for 9 at 6.15 PM. We reached at 6.20PM per my watch, and about 6.17 per Assabs clock. (I am very particular about time). A lady came up to us, in a no-happy mood, and yelled that since we didn't make it by 6.15, she gave the table to another family. She was upset at us on not making it on time. Now, given their casual and slow service, clearly this family arrived before 6.15 and were seated on a table that we were promised.\nAt any other restaurant or service, I would expect an apology and an effort to find an alternative. Not here friends. I was indifferently told to pick any two disjoint tables. There was one with 7 seats, I asked. Nope, that's reserved for a 7PM, she said. How about another one, there? Nope not available. She would not put together two tables! And this at a time where there were only two sets of customers, the restaurant was screaming empty!\nShe clearly did not want us in the restaurant. While I was standing disillusioned, my wife lost it and made it know to the lady, that any other restaurant would allow for a 10 minute grace (and here we have a empty restaurant). That pissed her off even more. I walked to the counter and asked  to speak to the supervisor. It happens that our 'friendly' lady was the owner, lol. The mom of this mom-pop joint. On a note, the table was offered to someone of an African descent. I am a south Asian. I have never experienced racism in 14 years in this country, and I am now questioning if this was one instance.\n\nThere was new server (never seen her before) who apologized and tried to mend things, but as I mentioned, we were not wanted. Needless to say we walked away, and thanks to yelp, went down to Oscars caf\u00e9, about a mile away. We were not disappointed. \nAssab, if you happen to read this: treat people with respect, good food can take you only so far. No one is indispensable, and there are alternatives.\nAnd to the nice young lady server, run away from this joint-you do not want to become like your bosses!\nAs of food, after a while, it tastes the same across the restaurants-Zenis, Mudai, Gumbo in south bay, Assab, oscars in SF.", "author": "Kalpendu P."}

It's places like this that make me even more proud to be a native San Franciscan. Start your meal off with a sambusa of some sort - they're cheap, and always come piping hot and filled with a super flavorful meat or veggie, depending on which you get. \n\nEating with your hands does take a little while to get used to, but their bread/pancake, injera, is surprisingly solid enough to hold your food and makes for a great experience. Order a side of injera per person also, and you're bound to be stuffed! I swear it expands in your stomach after your meal, so even if you're wary of how small your meal looks - don't worry. We always get the meat combo, which comes with tender lamb, beef and chicken and dollops of yogurt. The veggie combo is also very good, and the mushroom platter is by far my favorite. Get everything family style so you can share and taste a little bit everything. If you're not a fan of spicy food or have a low tolerance for it, ask for a milder version and it's just as tasty.\n\nI've never really had a better food first experience than I have at Assab, and the burst of flavor that everything is accompanied with really blew my mind. Keep in mind, the injera is fermented so it's sour - but also the perfect balance of fluffy and filling. The only tiny downside is that the service isn't very fast - but the family who owns the restaurant and the staff are always so pleasant and sweet natured, it's hard to mind.

After having 10 taxis grabbed from me and allowing 5 38 busses to pass because next bus kept promising me that the 38L will be there in 4..3..2..4..3..2 minutes and 15 minutes later when finally getting on said bus being stopped at Powel because the bus driver had to call the police on an unruly rider and have an argument, no fight with another 38L driver blocking traffic down Geary for several minutes more and then after bailing the bus and being rejected by the next cab and then getting what was probably the angriest cab driver in the entire bay area who insisted on driving fast enough to get air born passing Laguna surrounded by frightened drivers while he yelled at the top of his lungs in his thick accent at someone on his cellphone I figured I must be immortal and cursed and only by taking the greatest risk presented would I end the suffering I was destined to endure and atone for the guilt of being over an hour late for my dinner date with one of my best friends, Angelo.\n\nI was happily surprised but not completely surprised when my plans failed miserably and I was served what could only be one of the finest meals I have ever had the pleasure to dig my bare hands in to (which I did wash thoroughly since we were eating family style from the same plate).  I have nothing to compare this meal to since this was my first taste of Eritrean food but let me just say the food was amazing as was the experience.\n\nThe flavors seemed to me to be some wonderful marriage of indian and Mediterranean flavors, heavily but skillfully applied. We started with the vegetable and meat sambusa, a filled fried pastry that reminded me of a cross between a samosa and a fried russian meat filled crepe I used to get regularly from the Russian Bakery near Geary and 20th.  The pastry was lightly flaky and the meat filling was russian and Mediterranean in flavor.  The vegetable filling which I liked more than the meat sang of fresh faba beans and was delightfully flavored.\n\nFor the main corse we ordered two dishes.  The first, Kifto, a lean ground beef simmered with clarified butter, seasoned hot pepper and topped with homemade cottage cheese which reminded me more of a dry fresh mexican cheese in flavor.  We opted to have it prepared traditional \"Raw\" style. The flavor and texture was amazing.\n\nThe second dish, kel wa-beggee was cubed lamb cooked in clarified butter and seasoned with jalapenos, onions and tomatoes and served with a little yogurt.  \n\nWe had our meal served family style which means all of the dishes are served on a large round plate with high walls on top of injera, a spongy crepe like bread.  We each got a 2nd plate with more injera which we used by tearing pieces of it to scoop up the food and eat it.\n\nThe food and experience was wonder albeit a little bit messy and the wine we ordered complimented the food well.  By the end I had completely forgotten about my mass transit fiasco and sat in a happy wine and food coma induced haze.\n\nThe only thing killed by the raw meat was my stress and fear of this cuisine I had waited so long to try.\n\nAt the end of our evening as I walked out of the pig and whistle next door and crossed the street a 38 bus arrived at the stop next to the cross walk and I quickly decided to hop on it and take it the three blocks I was going to walk home.  My bus Karma had returned.\n\nI am a big fan.", "author": "Theron L."}

The lamb I ordered was way too tough and I wasn't fully convinced that I should be paying $14 for my entree. I was also running out of injera before I was done eating but I knew an extra order would cost me. \n\nThe bill for our party of six left a pretty deep dent on the wallet ($14 x 6 plus honey wine and beer!) but for those of us who had never experienced food from this region of the world, it surely was a treat.

I don't normally do spicy food but they can tone the heat down a little bit and they did so upon my request... I really enjoyed my dinner there. Our party also ordered a bottle of honey wine which was also very good and I feel went well with the spiciness of the meal.\n\nIt appeared to me that this was a family run restaurant. It's a small place but I saw a large party at a big table so they can accommodate more than 10 people in that area. Went there on a late Saturday night, about an hour before closing and the place was still packed. We got the last table... They even added extra injera bread to my leftovers because they said that was the only way to thoroughly enjoy the food. Thank you Assab... I'm sold!!!", "author": "Chuck D."}

Various vegetables, curries, and meats are served on a giant piece of sponge bread.  The flavor is sensational.\n\nBe sure to clean your plate!

The veggie combo only came with 3 things with limited substitutions and you have to pay for extra injera. \n\nI'm glad I tried it, but I won't be back.", "author": "Amy B."}

While the decor might not be posh and I think they could use an extra waiter, this place is always packed and that crowd is well deserved. \n\nMy fiance and I are huge fans of the Kitfo and vegetarian combo - but we've also had the lamb and the chicken and they did not disappoint, either. The only negative to the food, in my opinion, is due to the fact that Assab is a bit stingy with the Injera. I don't like eating a ton of the \"plate\" because it's overly soggy with the sauce from the food, but you only get one piece of Injera per person, which isn't quite enough to finish the meal. You can ask for more, but it costs extra - which I think is a shame, given that most other places I go give you free refills. Despite this, Assab is now my go-to place because it's close to my house and legitimately delicious.", "author": "Elizabeth T."}

I could see the small green entrance from two blocks away. \nWe were met up by a non-yelper friend of mine who had reservations as to what in the world I was making her eat.\nOnce inside, we chose a table close to the window. First customers of the night. We were given a menu and our drink orders were taken.\n \nNeither of us were hungry so we asked for several appetizers and one large plate to share. \n\"No, we cannot do that\" said the waitress.\nCannot do what? give us food? Turns out they cannot let three people share one large plate of food and two appetizers. We eventually gave in and ordered a second full plate of food.\n\nWe ordered Vegetable Sambusa and Meat Sambusa for appetizers, the Meat Combination plate ($15.95) and the TSEBHI-DERHO (chicken) ($12.95).\n\nOur appetizers were beyond fantastic. They were like a thin empanada (for Miami yelp...) with lots of spicy goodness. \n\nWhen our large plate of food got to the table, my friend was not given an extra plate. We were dumbfounded, and offended we even had to ask for one. There was certainly more than enough food. When we asked for the plate, the waitress brought exactly that, one plate, without the bred/crepe/fluffy dough thing. We could not believe it. Patrick ended up giving her his plate. I mean, how much can one crepe cost them? $0.10? less? My friend barely ate anything anyway. *sigh* I hate when crappy service interferes with such a great experience.\n\nOnce we got past the terrible service, we took the first bite out of this delicious sampling of flavors. I could not believe what I was eating. This is the most fantastic, beyond delicious food I have ever had. Nothing can compare to this. \n\nThe experience of sharing your food is also an experience. Kind of like saying \"what's mine is yours.\" \nAll three of us loved the food and even if it was spicier than we had anticipated, we would have asked for seconds if we were still hungry. \n\nI am hooked and will look forward to another Eritrean dinner for more years to come. \n\nThe four stars is strictly based on my horrible experience with the service, had it not been for that, I would have given five. The service was so bad, in fact, that I will try other Ethiopian/Eritrean restaurants before ever returning to Assab in hopes that I find one with better service and equally incredible food.\nUnfortunately for me, this is one of those places where you have to choose between good food or good service.\n\n*disclaimer*\nI did get sick on my plane-ride back, but it's because i'm not used to the spices. Those who are trying this food for the first time and are not used to spice cannot overdo-it like I did. It will not sit well in your tummy. Have some pepto handy. :D", "author": "Laura G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-21", "description": "I love Ethiopian food so I was eager to try this place. It's Eritrean, but it's very similar to Ethiopian (look at a map... but not a history book). Like Ethiopian food, the meal centers on a large plate of injera, a thin, spongy, tangy bread, and you order dishes that are served on top. You eat with your hands by taking a piece of the injera - starting with the portion they give you on the side and ending with the messy but tasty serving dish - and using it to scoop up the various toppings.\n\nI always like to get the vegetarian combo so that you get lots of variety, plus one meat dish; that's enough for two. For the meat dish we chose a chicken with spicy peppers, onions, and (very obviously) butter. Both were great. The veggie combo wasn't quite as diverse as at Ethiopian places I've been to, and the chicken was a tad greasier, but the meal overall definitely met my high expectations for great Ethiopian (yeah, Eritrian) restaurants.\n\nStandard preparatory instructions for those not familiar with this style of food: wash your hands first, be prepared to share, be open minded, and be prepared to smell like (delicious!) onions, garlic, and exotic spices for the rest of the evening.", "author": "Adam B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-24", "description": "I've heard for a long time from people that I would like Ethiopian food - but up until a little while ago, I had never gotten the opportunity to try it.\n\nI make it a point to try any and all cuisines at least twice before I vow it off forever.  I mean, if I were a man, I'd be Andrew Zimmern - only I don't have texture issues like he does, and I have a bit more hair and a few less pounds.  (He is adorable though.)\n\nWe found this place and headed over one night.  It was only when I got there that I noticed the name - -  Assab Eritrean Restaurant.\n\nNow I have never been a guru when it comes to geography.  For a girl, I have a pretty amazing sense of direction - but geography, not my strongest suit.  With all the travel I do - you'd think I'd have at least HEARD of most countries, but apparently not.\n\nFirst, I had no idea what \"Eritrean\" was - most likely because I had no idea - not a single CLUE - that \"Eritrea\" was a country in Africa.  I assumed it was an adjective for all things Ethiopian or something.  I stand corrected.  A tiny little country in Africa - who knew?\n\nNo really - who knew?  Did you know?  \n\nWell - I enjoyed my meal here a lot.\n\nFirst, we walked in where there was only one table left - meaning we were destined to be the last customers of the evening, and we arrived perhaps 5 minutes before last seating.  The owner who greeted us never flinched and welcomed us.  He was so patient and friendly with all of my questions - what \"injera\" is and how it's made, and how one eats certain dishes, as well as geographic and cultural information about Eritrea and Ethiopia.  \n\nBoth Robbie-boy and I picked a couple of dishes and asked which he recommended - and abided by his recommendations.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer - an Eritrean deep-fried quesadilla of sorts with ground beef.  While I have forgotten what it was called, it was delicious!\n\nThe food presented before us was on huge platters.  It was slightly reminsicent of Indian dishes with the use of lentils and herbs, but without the strong flavors of Indian food.  More subtle, if you will.  The meats were braised nicely and \n\nFor those of you who don't know - you don't actually have to put hand to food to mouth as I thought it meant when I was told one must eat by hand.  I was willing to do it, in spite of being a big believer in utensils.  You simply tear off a piece injera, the spongy \"bread\" that is actually more like a tortilla, and take THAT and grab your food with it.  It takes some talent and practice to not get any food on your hands.  Midway through the meal, I did ask for a fork only so I could scoop up the goodies and pile in on top of the injera and then eat it by hand.\n\nOne appetizer, two dishes and 3 beers cost a little over $45 prior to tip - which in terms of Rob's and my dinners, is incredibly reasonable.  Furthermore, it was an informal but exotic dinner experience at a reasonable cost.  If I had to pick one small bone, it's that with more exotic, foreign cuisine, I think the owner should make the ambiance of the place a bit more suitable for the experience instead of a plain restaurant setting.  Perhaps some booths or partitions to make it a bit more private, tablecloths, dim the lights a LOT, and in general, make it more intimate.  Eating with one's hands in an intimate setting is more enticing and appealing than eating w/ one's hands in a wide open, bright restaurant.   This restaurant would have made my date list if not for the ambiance.\n\nWe walked out a bit more \"edu-ma-cated\" than before, tummies full, and happy for minimal cost.  All in all, Assab was great, and we'll be back.  The food was tasty, and while I have nothing to compare it to, it was not too heavy but filling, subtle but distinct.\n\nIf you haven't tried food from this region, I daresay Assab is a good starting point!", "author": "Grace K."}

We settled on 1 veg option with chickpeas, 1 beef option, and 1 lamb and potato option.  My favorite in terms of flavor was actually the veg option.  Though they were all good.  One of my friends declared the lamb to be her favorite, so it's not like there was a single standout.  The beef was the only really spicy one, but they were good about keeping our water glasses full.  Also, I was afraid a single piece of spongy crepe-like bread wouldn't be enough to sop up all the food, but it was perfect and there was a little spongy bread left over from the serving platter.  \n\nThird order of business: experience.  The service was good, though our waiter seemed cold.  Towards the end of our meal he smiled more, so I left feeling good about him, but don't come here expecting a chatty server.  But most importantly, a giant plate of scoopable deliciousness to share = big win, satisfying dinner, and a desire to come back.", "author": "Anne Marie B."}

This place pales in comparison to New Eritrea on Irving.\n\nThe veggie sambusas were all peas, and with no spicy paste for dipping.  The wrapper on mine even had some uncooked parts.\n\nWe shared the meat combo and the famous mushroom dish, but neither one thrilled me.  The lamb was too gamey and tough, the chicken wasn't all that tender and was a chore to pry off the bone.  The injera was thin and dry, unlike the supple stuff I am accustomed to at New Eritrea, and the pieces under our entrees turned to gruel in the sauce, which shouldn't happen.  Soft and soggy, yes, but not disintegrated.  The mushrooms were mostly onions, and the flavors were fine, but nothing special.\n\nThe service was friendly, but painfully slow, taking ten minutes to come to our table, another ten to get our appetizers, and we had to ask again for our drinks when the entree arrived, while their Eritrean friends (who coincidentally happened to be friends of mine) at the next table got excellent, speedy service, and their drinks arrived  20 minutes before ours, even though we arrived at the restaurant 20 minutes before they did.  \n\nI don't see any reason to return to Assab now that New Eritrea will be open Mondays starting in March, which is why we weren't there last night.  \n\nBased on the reviews, Assab was a major disappointment.", "author": "Quinn S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-12-18", "description": "I hadn't had Eritrean food since the summertime, so coming to Assab was a real treat. Since I go out every week with my friend to sample different cuisines, and since I am heading back to the East Coast for the holidays, I figured, \"Hey, why not do Eritrean before I leave SF for vacation?\"\n\nWe were deciding between Assab and Bamboo Village. Eritrean vs. Indonesian; my friend was craving Indonesian food more since he was under the impression that \"Ethiopian food is too healthy-sounding for me tonight.\" But, we decided we would make our final decision if we got the chance to look at both menus. Assab didn't have a menu outside, so my friend wanted us to walk down to Bamboo Village (just a block away) to check them out first. Ah, but upon approaching Bamboo Village...the place was packed. It looked like there was a big party dinner, so the whole restaurant was full (the place wasn't so big anyway). So, by default, we went back to Assab (I really wanted Assab in the first place, so this was my victory).\n\nAssab wasn't so busy at around 7pm; we sat by the window (bad idea on a cold night in SF!); we ordered the Vegetable Sambusa (fritter), the Meat Combo and the Vegetable Combo. It was my friend's first time to try Eritrean food, so he certainly was not aware that there were no silverware involved. When the main course came out (on a HUGE platter), my friend panicked a little at the thought of using his hands to grab the food. \"It's not...sanitary?\" he said. Meanwhile, I was fine with the idea and was already tearing away at the injera and dipping it into the food.\n\nAt first, my friend was eating the injera and meat/veg reluctantly with his hands. Then, he summoned our server and this conversation ensued:\n\nFriend: \"May I...have a spoon?\"\nServer smiles, shakes head \"NO\" and makes my friend gasp in astonishment. I knew he already felt embarrassed.\nServer: \"We don't have any spoons here, but I can go downtown and buy one for you if you want.\"\nFriend: \"Uh...uh...no, that's okay.\"\nServer: \"Are you sure?\"\nFriend: \"Yes...yes, I'm sorry, I didn't know.\"\n\nSo my friend really believed that there were no spoons available, and settled for using his hands. He said he was \"getting used to the idea\" when the server came back and actually handed him a spoon. Then, my friend used the spoon the rest of the time we were eating.\n\nAnyway, that was a fun/funny experience in itself. But onto the actual review--\n\nFood: Great; I loved the spices/seasonings. I'm not quite educated in Eritrean food just yet, but I liked what I ate at Assab. The meat and veggie combos are great for those who aren't familiar with the different dishes yet.\n\nPrices: Average for dinnertime; of course not as cheap as Chinese/Thai/Vietnamese places, but I'm under the impression that the prices at Eritrean places are a little more expensive ($10-$15) due to the experience and to the exotic nature of the food (please pardon me if I am wrong).\n\nService: The server and the cook were both very nice. Food arrived relatively quickly, and the server made sure to check up on us from time to time. Also, I liked his sense of humor.\n\nAtmosphere: Not as dreamy/intimate as New Eritrea in the Sunset, but still a nice place for dinner. Seemed to accomodate groups okay; the place itself is smaller than New Eritrea though. \n\nLocation: Extra props for being super accessible from the Geary bus stops.\n\nOverall, I really like Assab, and hope to be back in the New Year.", "author": "Helene K."}

Even in ultra-diverse SF, there's some things that you can't get on every street corner. \n+ It's fun!  Imagine sitting in front of a giant platter of colorful food with all your friends, and you're all grabbing the foods with your hands.  Who cares about table manners or holding back?  It's a food that's meant to be enjoyed with company.  I like that.\n+ Visual flare!  Look at the pictures!\n+ Flavaaa!  I'd suggest you get the meat combination platter, since it lets you try the beef, chicken, and lamb.  Lamb= the best.  Add the mushroom entree to your platter too; it's really smooth and I tell myself that it balances out all the heavy meats.  The main foods come on a bed of sour tortilla-ish bread (injera), with dollops of yogurt.  What I like best about this cuisine is the way all the different flavors - the sourness of the injera bread, the cooling taste of the yogurt, the spice of the meats - blend together.  Nice complements!\n\nThe Nay:\n- They take their sweet-a$$ time.  I came here once with my parents, and after we ordered, I sat in there and read several chapters of a book while they walked over to Trader Joe's for a stroll.  When they came back 45 minutes later, the food still wasn't served.  Same thing happened the other few times I came here.  I am impatient, so making me wait = terribad.

Another difference is that eritrean food is served with yogurt where ethiopian is not.  \r\n\r\nThis is a very pleasant if not crowded restaurant, simply appointed but with a heavily aromatic feel to it, fragrant of berbere, a dry spice blend concocted from dried red chilies, ginger, turmeric, shallots, fenugreek, allspice, black pepper, cardamom, cloves, hot peppers, cumin and sometimes other ingredients. \r\n\r\nMy dining companion and I ordered a meat and a veggie combination and shared them family-style, which is the way to go with East African food because you will always get to try more dishes.

The vegetarian dishes weren't as good, but the lentils and spinach were good accompaniments.

In fact, I don't really know much beyond what almost anyone would know: it's served in a big bread platter, and you eat it all with your hands, and it's spicy and lentily.\n\nWhy do desert countries always have the hot and spicy food?  In a logical universe, the spiciest food in the world would be Eskimo food, and food from the topics and deserts would be bland and cool (if cool is a taste).  I mean, you already don't have any water, so why pile on the spicy food?  Madness!\n\n[P.S.: I know why.  I know spicy food makes you sweat, which cools you down in warm climates.  And I know water only makes the burn worse, and what you want is milk.  But what I said was funnier.  Put the smug PM down and just focus on the review.]\n\nThe service was really good--a middle-aged guy who was appropriately friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-06-25", "description": "When I told my mother that I was taking my brother to eat Eritrean/Ethiopian food, she said with a laugh, \"What do you eat at Ethiopian? Dinosaur?\" Aghast at my mom's ignorance but also bemused at her strange sense of humor (maybe that's where I get it from?), I tried to explain the wonders of this complex, yet humble cuisine. There is something very primally satisfying about eating with your hands, with the injera serving more as a sponge for all the delightfully seasoned sauces than as a utensil. Ordinary meats like beef, chicken, and lamb are taken to a level most Western or Eastern palates have not experienced. At least, that's what *good* Eritrean/Ethiopean food is like...and Assab most definitely delivers with a delectable dining endeavor.\n\nOn this trip, we ordered:\n\n- Vegetable Sambusa: started out with this nicely sized fried envelope stuffed with green peas, carrots and spices. It was a little messy to eat, and I was surprised that it wasn't served with some kind of sauce. Not bad for $2.\n\n- Shiro: pureed chick peas, whose consistency conjured up thoughts of something between baby food and whipped mashed potatoes. I'm on the fence whether that's a good or bad thing. The flavor fares more positively, well seasoned and cooked with onions, tomatoes, and pepper.\n\n- Meat combination: which included small portions of the:\n#3 Zigni: small pieces of beef cooked with onions, tomato, butter, and an added kick of hot pepper. This was quite good, though the beef was a little chewier than I would have liked and the butter flavor was not as strong as at New Eritrea.\n\n#4. Tsebhi - Derho: we got one chicken leg on the bone (though you can also get thighs), cooked in a sauce similar to the Zigni. I really wish that there was more meat to this...will definitely have to try it as a full entree and not as part of the meat combo next time.\n\n# 8. Alicha-beggee: cubes of lamb mixed with potatoes, carrots and bell peppers. The flavor was strong, without being overpoweringly \"lamby.\" I believe Michael Bauer has used that exact term.\n\n- Vegetable combination: a sampling of three standby Ethiopean vegetable dishes:\n#13. Veg alicha: Potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, cabbage are subtly seasoned and melt in your mouth. Toss up between this and New Eritrea.\n\n#14. Okra: delicious stew of okra that does a good job of riding the line of texture for okra; not too firm, and not too slimy.\n\n#15. Zucchini: probably the weakest link, similar in seasoning to the okra. I am not a huge zuchini fan, so meh.\n\nThe injera that Assab uses is very good, though I do think that New Eritrea wins in this category. Assab's injera seems to be structurally a bit too thin. If you look at the structure of the surface of the injera, you'll see that it is very \"holey.\" I think that this is why the injera falls apart so easily while handling the food.  The taste is also a bit on the mild side for me and could have used a bit more tang. Another bummer is that they only give you one piece of injera per person; New Eritrea gives you two. An extra only costs $0.75, so it's not a huge deal but something to note. Assab also has super cheap drinks - a bottle of honey wine is $19, by the glass is $5. Imported beers are no more than $3.75, and fruit juices are good as well. As far as the service, I think that our waitress secretly hated us because we took forever to decide. We also thought it was strange that they didn't give us small plates when we ordered our appetizer.\n\nOverall, I'd say that the seasoning of the food at Assab is some of the best I've had of Ethiopian/Eritrean in SF (on par with New Eritra). I would highly suggest this place to introduce someone to this exotic cuisine (and dispel any misconceptions about dinosaur meat...). Since the combination samplings are so small, I recommend picking a few full entrees if you are sharing with a group of people.

A few times trying this cuisine over many years had failed to make a fan out of me, so I just kind of crossed those restaurants off of my list, as well as any new prospects.\n\nThank goodness for Green Bunny - she brought me to Assab, and I am so glad I tried it again!  My experience there was very, very good - and even my most feared part of the meal (big soggy sour spongy pancake called Injera) tasted good.  I don't LOVE the big pancake, but I liked it enough to eat more than I ever dreamt possible.  And just so you know, the pancake is all that you get as far as a utensil, so it's either pancake, or no dinner for you.  To be correct, eat with your right hand, and put your left hand in your lap.  I learned to do this in India so it is second nature for me.  Due to this way of eating, your right hand will smell like your dinner for hours afterwards unless you are an expert at not letting any of the sauces touch your fingers.\n\nAs far as the food...what is on top of the pancake is magically delicious.  I decided to go for the meat sampler, which included lamb, beef and chicken, with sides of lentils, salad and yogurt.  The presentation is great - it comes on a big platter all for you! and it's fragrant and colorful and tastes great, with just enough spice but not too much that your head is on fire.  The chicken was my favorite - a leg piece with falling-off-of-the-bone tender meat, with excellent flavor.\n\nA glass of honey wine is like sunshine in your mouth, as bright as the gold-toothed smile of our server and just as warming.\n\nThe atmosphere is a little sparse, but neat and clean.  The prices are very reasonable (around $8-11 per entree).\n\nSo, Eritrean food has joined the ranks of \"foods from around the world that I love to eat\", and I will be sure to visit Assab again soon.", "author": "Liz S."}

The Groupon was for two dinners with wine included. We didn't fully understand how the \"two dinners\" bit would work but we were told there was about a $16.50 price limit on the main entrees we could order so we were not able to order the dishes we initially wanted. In the end that was no big deal because what we did have was really delicious.\n\nWe started with a veggie sambusa (much like a Samosa) that was perfectly seasoned and very tasty.\n\nFor main dishes we had #6 Kelwa-Mix (chicken & veggies in a nice sauce) and #7 Kelwa-Beggee (tasty lamb cubes in a spicy pepper sauce). Naturally the full meal also included other items:  lentils, nicely spiced chopped spinach, some lettuce, tomatoes, jalape\u00f1o on the side and an extra injira each.\n\nThe food was extremely good, fresh and we were served just the right amount. There was nothing left on our plate, but we were plenty full and couldn't have eaten dessert.\n\nInitially the server was a bit stern as we were ordering, probably because of our not understanding the price limit on the Groupon. However, once we ordered and started receiving our food she warmed up and ultimately the service was excellent.\n\nWe had gone early and there was only one server and a gentleman seating guests but later another woman arrived too. I spoke with her about other Ethiopian and Eritrean food we had had previously and found her too was most delightful.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-05", "description": "Thinking back on my many encounters with Eritrean cuisine, I realize that it's helped me mark some significant memories. I think my FIRST Eritrean meal was also my FIRST dinner in New York during my FIRST visit to New York. So I guess Eritrean food brings back some fond memories.\n\nOn this visit to Assab, we established one more FIRST: my children's first experience with Eritrean cuisine. And those of you who've had the pleasure, know what I mean when I say, \"boy did I pick something that's quite a departure from our everyday fare of Chinese and American food.\" \n\nBut hold on, let's think about this. Eritrean food is really just an assortment of meat and vegetable stews. It's served with a spongy flat bread that doubles as an eating utensil (you pick the food up with pieces of the bread), so you never use silverware. There's nothing more primitive and strangely comforting than eating with your hands...and kids love that. They do it regardless of whether it's supposed to be done or not, because it's just plain natural. I think that's part of the appeal of eating fried chicken, hamburgers and hot dogs. \n\nSpeaking of natural...we like to challenge our kids and their natural instinct to avoid what isn't \"normal\" to their everyday lives. Teaching them about other cultures through food and giving them a bit of historical and current information regarding the country is a great way to broaden their horizons. I had mentioned to another parent that we were going to take them to Eritrean food, and he grimaced as if he'd tried and didn't care for it. But you know, he's never even laid eyes on the cuisine, so I don't know how you can knock something that you know nothing about. \n\nSo back to the food. I've been to a lot of Eritrean restaurants. The best so far is still the Blue Nile in New York City; but since that one is closed, this one is my new favorite. There's a big emphasis on spicy foods, but most of the entrees can be made mild. And if you've never done Eritrean, there's nothing weird about it. Like I said, it's mostly stews and the sambusas are excellent starters. The flavors, though unique, aren't so strong or wildly different from our usual American fare; so even newcomers to the cuisine should be able to find something they like. \n\nBy the way...the kids really enjoyed their first experience; they even saw a game on display at the restaurant that they had played before...now they know where it came from and what that culture eats. Who woulda thought I could turn my food obsession into something productive?   :-)", "author": "Virg Y."}

I shared a Veggie Combo platter and Meat Combo platter with my wife so we could have a taste of everything.  That was a huge - HUGE - plate of food, all of which was really delicious.  It came on one plate - something to note if you don't want meat touching your veg.  I won't stoop to \"meat touching\" puns for fear of being kicked off yelp....but I am tempted..... \n\nThe meat options oddly translated to my palate as being similar to Mexican dishes.  Many of the sauces were like very nice moles (a little spicy, a little sweet, and deep with rich flavor), and one was very much like Chile Verde.  Not complaining at all - I loved them all.\n\nThe dishes came with a fresh yogurt - so nice and creamy - as well as a trio of sides: red lentils, brown lentils and a cooked greens.  All were fabulous, but I like the red lentils (I'm assuming they were lentils) the best.  \n\nOn the veg side (the menu was VERY veg friendly) the tastiest options were the spiced cauliflower / potato option (to make another cultural parallel, think Aloo Ghobi) and the zucchini in a slightly spicy tomato sauce.\n\nIt all comes with a neoprene like crepe that you use in lieu of utensils.   Ask for extra napkins!  The crepe is bland, but that's fine, as its just an edible spork.\n\nSo good -  I'm glad I was introduced to this place.  Thanks Veena!", "author": "Aaron M."}

Of the 5 or so Ethiopian/Eritrean places I've dined at in my life, this is hands down the best!\n\nI recommend starting with both the meat and veggie sambusa.  They are so fresh, and the crust is so deliciously crispy, I could've ordered 10 more and just made a meal out of these.  \n\nHere's a tip - go with the server's recommendation.  The prices are low enough, that you can afford to experiment.  3 of us ordered the meat sampler, the veggie sampler, and the mushrooms (heavenly), and we had a little more than enough food.  Flavoring was out of this world on every single dish item, although I was particularly fond of the eggplant, the red lentils, and the beef.  \n\nAlso, the injera is delightfully sour and spongy, and even better once it's soaked up all the juices and flavoring from the servings.\n\nSure, we waited a little while for our food given the small staff, but it was well worth the wait and we didn't feel rushed.

Spicy, but not uncomfortably so. I went ahead and gave it four stars for the food, but beware, the service is terribly slow. On a Saturday night there was one server and a manager for the entire restaurant. There's no waiting space at all so everyone just kind of hovers in the middle of the restaurant waiting for a table. Then it took about 20 minutes for anyone to come get our drink and food order. I have to say, they were friendly and apologetic, but one server for an entire restaurant, even a small one, is pretty absurd.\n\nThat being said, I totally recommend this restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-10-11", "description": "We've passed Assab 100 times on Geary but never knew what a hidden gem this place was until the other night.  Ethiopian food is something that we have very rarely so I checked Yelp before picking a restaurant and Assab had 4.5 stars so we decided to try it.\n\nYou'd never guess from the funky interior that the food would be so great!  The owner served us and had such a sweet energy that it made the experience even better.  Parking was a breeze on Geary and the eastbound 38 bus stops directly in front of the door...extremely convenient!\n\nI have to say that Assab has THE BEST lentil soup I have ever tasted.  It was perfectly flavored, not too much salt and the lentils were so soft and comforting.  We also tried the meat sambusa which was fantastic, flaky and spiced very well.\n\nWe ordered the meat and veggie combinations, plus the Shiro based on a Yelper's review.  The Shiro was just ok but the rest was extremely tasty without being overly spicy.  Of the meat dishes, the beef wasn't anything to write home about but the chicken was soft and tasty and the lamb was fantastic. The veggie dishes were a complete surprise.  Vegetables are really hard to make flavorful and cook just right but Assab succeeded on all counts.  Both the zucchini and okra dishes, things that could be disastrous in the wrong hands, were so tasty and were cooked perfectly.\n\nAs usual with Ethiopian/Eritrean food, we ate way too much so we had to skip dessert.  There were only two on the menu anyway.  The whole meal, including 2 apps, 3 main dishes, 2 beers and a (real!) ginger beer came to $48.  We will definitely be back to Assab and would bring friends here!!", "author": "Jon B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-22", "description": "As soon as I took a step into Assab, I knew it was going to be good. The fantastic smells wafting out of the kitchen instantly smack you (for lack of a better term) directly in the face as soon as you enter. This isn't the most lavish looking restaurant, but what is there is enough to please the visual senses. Although I couldn't check out the kitchen, the dining space looked pretty clean.\n\n Instantly greeting us with a smile and some menus, the waiter seemed friendly enough. The menu featured enough quality selection for a difficult choice, which is much better than the alternative. We ended up getting the Meat Sambusa to start out, which although was pretty small, the size was to be expected for $2. The flavor on the other hand, was anything but small. If you've ever had any other kind of \"Samosa\" before, this is pretty much in the same family, but the extremely flavorful Meat in the Sambusa made it stand out of the bunch.\n\n Unable to pick out just a single meal, we went with the Meat and Vegetarian combo entrees. For the meat - Zigni, Tsebh-Derho, Alicha-Beggee. For the Vegetarian dishes - Veg. Alicha, Okra, Zucchini. I also decided to try out the honey wine after so many people raved about it. It didn't really \"float my boat\" sort of speak. The flavor was almost too sweet/tart for me, and after just a few sips, I was done. Overall, food had some really powerful/interesting spices. Eating with hands was also a plus. Even though all of the dishes were great, they all tasted pretty similar, and it was ultimately hard to distinguish what I was eating since everything was served together on a colossal sized plate. \n\n This was the first time I've had Eritrean food before, but since then I have had it someplace else, and this place is easily better. I highly recommended Assab, and would come back in a heartbeat.", "author": "Russell S."}

It was fun and great eating with my hands back then and it's even funner now that I'm older and can regress.  Reasons I thought this place was awesome:\n\n1) Food was GRUBBIN': We had the lentil soup which was DA BOMB, the Kelwa Mix (chicken w/ sauteed vegetables) which was DA BOMB, and the recommended Alicha Beggee (cubes of lamb mixed w/ a variety of vegetables and seasoned nicely) which was DA THIRD BOMB, all on top of this funky, spongy bread called Injera which, similar to toilet paper, upon appearance and touch looks flimsy and soft but is surprisingly strong and great for picking up food w/ your hands.  Terrible analogy for something that was so good but it's the first thing that came to my mind. \n\n2) Service was sweet.

After being seated and then totally ignored for 15 minutes we had to go get the waitress to take our drink order.  The place is relatively small and apparently they are very snarky with their rules when it comes to seating. Our intended party of 6 turned out to be a party of 4 after we were seated and the waitress seemed pretty pissed that the other 2 people couldn't make it after all. She told us if they didn't show up by the time our food arrived we'd be moving to a smaller table. As in picking up our drinks, dishes, silverware, etc. and relocating. What? Seriously? Give me a break. Maybe it was her tone of voice that irritated me the most. And the fact that the waiter seemed to avoid ever coming near our table as payback for our 2 missing friends. \n\nThe food, however is pretty good. I kept trying to find my usual chicken dishes on the menu until I remembered I wasn't at an Ethiopian place. I found a good substitute that I enjoyed a lot. The lentils were good and not too buttery. We brought a couple that had never had Eritrean/Ethiopian before and while they were skeptical at first, they cleaned their plates. The guys had Ethiopian beer, which I tasted and found to be pretty decent although sweet. They changed options for round 2.\n\nOverall, I'd eat here again, if everyone in my party were present and someone had already made plans for it. I am more fond of Waziema, which is close enough to justify going there instead. Much friendlier staff and their food is fantastic.", "author": "Kara M."}

While at Cal, I visited Blue Nile as often as I could on a student budget (which wasn't often, but on occasion). \n\nSo it had been about 5 years since I had partaken in the delights of Ethiopian food. It's sort of like Indian food, but definitely is identifiable as its own entity. It's also great food for vegetarians - the vegetables are actually my favorite part. Though the spicy beef I had at Assab was delicious. My boyfriend had the veggie sampler, which was great too - I stole plenty of it. We went family style, all the way! :D We also had Ethiopian stout, which wasn't that impressive. Maybe we should have gone for the lager.\n\nIt seems like Assab is family run, which is nice, but be sure to be patient with the service speed. Also, I was impressed that people who looked like they could be Ethopian/Eritrean came into the place - I never saw people like that at the Blue Nile. Always college students and white people.\n\nSo, if you're prepared to eat with your hands, stop in and give it a try - it's a good experience. Don't blame me when you get cravings, though!

Perhaps I went in expecting Ethiopian food, and I'm sure there's plenty of regional variation and it's not all a monolith (it's like folks who expect all Indian food to be like butter chicken). Having said that, I just found everything extremely bland. Again, I'm so used to the heavenly aromas of \"niter kebbeh\" and its gorgeous amalgam of cardamon, cinnamon, garlic, nutmeg etc. You get none of that here, and I felt that everything was really under seasoned -- once again, this could be because of my great (and problematic) expectations. The much recommended okra just sat there in a basic tomato sauce, and was not that different from the zucchini, which swam in a very similar (bland) tomato gravy. The one good thing was the beautifully creamy yoghurt which you could immediately tell was house made and not from a carton.\nVery good service, though, and I hate giving it the thumbs down, but I just was underwhelmed.", "author": "Crushed Wi Cardamom C."}

Asaab is clean, the atmosphere is nice but they don't go out of their way to be friendly. \n\nThere were four of us and the waitress told us to order three dishes since the servings are big. There was enough food but I would not call the servings big. We ended up ordering another two dishes. In the end i think, one per person is perfect. \n\nWe ordered one lamp, one chicken, and the rest vegi dishes. Overall I think the vegetarian dishes are the best way to go. The meat was too chewy. We asked for one dish to be made mild instead of spicy but it came out very very spicy even for me and I eat spicy food. \n\nThe food had a nice range of flavors but nothing really that stood out. What I was surprised about is that they do not bring out extra bread. They give one roll per order and if you need more they charge. In the place that I've been to before they gave us extra and kept bringing more as needed. I've heard other places in the Bay Area give you free bread as well. The bread was ok but I it wasn't as good as I've had and was a bit bitter for me. \n\nWe came around 6 on a Saturday so it wasn't busy but the place quickly started to fill up closer to 7. They only have a few people working the front so you will have to wait. But if you are in the area and want to try something different you can come here.

The dish can with a little salad and one Ingera (a bread like pancake) All was delicious although WHEN I go again I will opt for the vegetarian options as the style of food really complimented the veg more than the meat. The spinich and the lentils where hands down the best, but you get so little with the meat dishes. The chicken was the nicest of the meats. it had so much flavour! the meat was really good quality.\n\nthe service: Fine for me but I can see why some may complain. It is on the slow side though that maybe part of the experience. the whole world does not run at our pace. I did eventually stand up and ask to be served but once we got the ball rolling service was fantastic... I came to realise that although the waiter was attentive he came when he thought you required him rather than when you asked. We just went with the flow and overall he had good judgement.  our server was very helpful when we chose our dishes and kept our glasses full of iced water. One other thing I noticed was that we only got one napkin each... it seemed too few for a restuarant where you eat with your hands. I guess its a learning curve.. eventually I'll only need half a napkin. Over all Good things. \n\nPrice: very reasonable. portions are large and very filling. $10-13 a dish. we didnt drink.\n\nover all experience: It was all new to me, I love new and interesting experiences.

Upon first arriving at the restaurant I waited in the entryway for a long time, but realizing it was a busy night I didn't mind. I was quite relieved after finally being seated, then kind of startled when the party of two behind me had to wait longer because one of their party wasn't there and a table for two was given to someone who just walked in. There may have been other reasons but by the look on the person's face who had to wait, I doubt it.\n\nAgain, I didn't think too much of it because this place's food came highly recommended on this site and I was looking forward to a good meal. I quickly decided what I wanted and waited the 15 minutes or so for the waitress to come around and take the drink and food order. If that seams a bit long to you then don't go here because the wait for the food was even worse. I got my drink, surprisingly, though didn't get any refills offered in the literal hour and twenty five minutes I waited. I don't even know if that's how long it took for them to get the food out to the table, that's just the amount of time it took for me to get up and walk out.\n\nNot once did the waitress stop and say, \"Gee I'm sorry it's taking so long but we're kind of busy tonight, let me get you some more water.\" That would have been enough, I would have stayed if I had even been spoken to and apologized to because I work customer service and understand when things get hectic. Not even receiving that, however, I said good night and left and picked up some food on the way home.\n\nI did leave the money for the drink because I didn't want to not pay for what I received, but I was not about to pay for the meal which I did not receive.\n\nWorst customer service I ever received, and that's saying something because I subscribe to Comcast.

It's very authentic with a lot of spices, and you get to eat with your hands. I would recommend the mushroom dish & the lentil soup appetizer.  One dish is more than enough per person which just means you can take the leftovers home.  If you go on the weekend, prepare to wait, but go on a weekday and you barely have to wait.

We had the samusas, veggie sampler, meat sampler and another chicken dish.  The chicken and lamb were so tender and delicious!  The \"bread\" tastes a little funky to me by itself (like a sourdough crepe), but it's great when it's soaked in flavorful food.  I was very impressed with the service as well.

And this time it wasn't from my friends but the waiter...cause I completely forgot 2 people in my party  were coming in late when we arrived to sit down and kept flip flopping on the tables. Yes I'm getting senile, but it doesn't have to deter me from gumming my food, people.\n\nOur handy group of eight were game for anything even eritrean food. None of us had this cuisine but from looking at everyone else's table I hope we all came in with empty stomachs cause those family size platters were HUUUUUGE!\n\nI should have went native and ate with my hands but I knew this was an exercise in futility, cause I suck at rolling vietnamese spring rolls and make it yourself burritos. So I know, without utensils, everything will get eaten by my lap instead of said mouth.\n\nAll of us ordered #5, #2, #9...plenty of meat for everyone. What we forgot to ask for was to mild up the spices...cause we're wimpy that way. The dishes were jacked up. I love the lentils, sweet potato mash, curry potato and the lamb was succulent. My tongue went up in flames, but it was sooo good, I refused to drown down my saliva. I kept looking at D and A and seeing them wimp out each bite with a swig of water brought out my inner (and TUMS-strengthened) stomach. It was kinda strange because my other friends had their own platter with the same entrees and they said the ground beef was too spicy, but my group thought it wasn't, & our chicken was too spicy but they thought it was mild. We thought they were nuts..friends...go figure. We all liked the flatbreads...it was really spongy! What we didn't like was the desserts. Foodies...stay away from all their dessert offerings. All the cakes (cheesecake, chocolate cake & tiramisu) were frozen, and tasted meh. They looked like stuff from Costco and they stuck in the freezer then pulled it out to thaw prior to serving. We were completely underwhelmed by that offering.\n\nThe 2 servers were extremely nice and accommodating. With a packed house on Sunday, I can see how sometimes they lagged a bit, but always quick with our requests. \n\nParking wasn't a challenge. There's plenty of 2 hour free parking around. I like the african decor and the music was low and soothing.", "author": "Pauline L."}

Then one day Masawa was being operated by different folks, what a disappointment!  The portions were small oily and laking flavor and the help were so thuggish that I was a little concerned as to how this change occurred as well as for the family who originally ran the restaurant.  Then a friend asked if I had tried, Assab, the new Eritrean restaurant on Geary.  Was so pleased to find the smiling family from Haight street!

The beef and chicken were great, I loved the lentils, and the injera was perfectly tangy.  The mushrooms were good, but I don't think I'd order them again, or the lamb.

You know what, if you are looking for a slight deviation from Indian food, you'll like the dishes they have to offer as it has that spicy and saucy thing going on. I had the vegetarian spinach dish, my sister the lamb, and every dish is served with injera(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injera), this amazing pancake like goodness that is used to scoop and soak your entree of choice; so, please be prepared to eat with your hands, no utensils needs . Speaking from a place of complete newness to Eritrean food, this place was a wonderful surprise, a jolt to my taste buds that made me wonder what other foods on this Earth have I been missing out on.", "author": "Brian S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-06", "description": "4.5 Stars. Definitely a great place to have some unique flare of eats. If you've never had Ethiopian food, this is definitely the place to try it. Unfortunately since I haven't been to Ethiopia, I can't speak to the authenticity, but I do recall having Ethiopian food at the age of 7. \n\nA very intimate atmosphere, in which you cannot get away from the great smells of its kitchen as you enter. Filled with spice, Ethiopian food brings you to this ethereal experience of flavor. If you don't like spice this perhaps may not be the place for you - but if you like spicy, sour, salty (not necessarily all at the same time) - this could be the place for you!.  We ordered the Tsebhi - Derho and Zucchini. Huge portions, well stewed and off the bone chicken. I'll be honest, when I first read the menu I feared that all the dishes would taste the same, as the ingredients seemed similar, but to my surprise there was a huge contrast.\n\nFor those who haven't had Ethiopian - I would describe it similar to Indian, South East Asian (The chicken I had reminded me of Rendang), but with a much earthy flavor.\n\nHave fun & enjoy!

In fact I have loved it on all subsequent visits. \nIn addition to deliciously well prepared food the dining experience itself is a hoot. If you are squeamish about sharing food/plates with others this may not be your cup of tea. It is considered good form to order 1 entree per person and all of them get served on these beautiful platters. Everyone gets some injira (sorta sour crepe type bread stuff; very good) then you dive in. \nI should have taken a picture of the menu because I can't for the life of me remember how to spell the dishes. The vegetarian one with potatoes and cauliflower is fantastic. There a beef one that starts with a g (i think; or is it a k) and that is also exceptionally good. I am not a huge lamb fan but I did enjoy their version and would probably order it again. The lentils, the spinach, the yogurt sauce; all good. So the take home on this is that is place is darn tootin' good. I have heard that it is spicy but I think it is just right.\nThis place is not very big and there are only two servers so be prepared to wait if you go on a weekend night. But as I and the rest of the people who dug in for the 45 minute wait know it is totally worth it. When you want Assab nothing else will do.\nOh yeah, the beer is good. They used to have one called Tusker (it was named after the elephant who killed the owner of the brewery) but it got too expensive to import so they don't have it anymore :(", "author": "colleen b."}

Loved the simple, hole-in-the-wall atmosphere.  Our waitress was delightful.  She \"quizzed\" us on how to pronounce our entree (needed to do that cool pop in the back of your throat to pronounce it correctly).  Lots of fun.\n\nAnd then of course the food was fantastic.  The stout beer and honey wine threw us for a loop at first, but the pairing with the ultra spicy food eaten without utensils made a lot of sense in hindsight.  Whatever jokes you may have heard/told in grade school about Ethiopian food aside, this place sets this pre-adolescent convention on its head by serving more food than you can possibly eat.  Definitely get served \"family style\" to enjoy the full experience.  Bring your appetite!\n\nWe weren't brave enough to try the lamb raw.

So reach in deep with your injera and really savor it!  The spinach is amazing as well.  \n\nI've been several times, and I have to say that the best experiences are when I've come with a small group.

The only real complaint I'd have about the dishes I've sampled here is that they're perhaps a wee bit on the oily side, and some are a little heavy on the vinegar for my taste.  That being said, the food is otherwise flavorful and pleasing, with plenty of choices for vegetarians and a reasonable handful of entrees that pack a pleasing amount of heat (for those who like a little sizzle in their meal).  Assab's look is modest and comfortable, festive and rich in color, and it's a good spot for conversation over dinner.  The service was helpful and friendly, and (maybe most important of all) the menu choices provide a refreshing change of pace from the more heavily-trod styles of cuisine to be found--as much as I love Thai and Japanese, it's true that sometimes I want something different.

The lamb and beef: unbelievable flavor, not super tender, but like I said the flavor makes up for it.\nLove the service.  Quite slow, family run mom&pop and it's lovely-it means they're taking their time with my food and its not sitting out all night.

In regards to the level of spiciness, we orders ours to be less spicy and it still had a little kick and was far from being mild/bland, a great option for the spice averse. It took us a while to get someone to take our order, but once it was placed, service moved quickly and we had food in about ten minutes. The dessert options were kind of dull and didn't sound Eritrean, so we passed.

I recommend the Mixed Chicken (Kelawa Mixed, I think is the official name). Ask for extra napkins, as it is messy, and extra injera bread as one piece won't be enough. Really delicious and filling and well priced. I'll definitely be back.", "author": "Pidge M."}

They're not the most efficient, so wait times can get a little ridiculous, but they're super nice and the food's always worth it.", "author": "Gregorio S."}

I'm a vegetarian so I can't vouch for the meat dishes but I get the sampler dish that has a little of all the veggi offerings and somehow they take some of my least favorite vegetables and make them  soooo delicious. Of course eating with your hands is always a fun experience too.", "author": "Haven L."}

I had ordered take out, and it wasn't ready when I reached there. I had to wait for 20 mins or so, before it was ready. I would prefer going to New Eritrea than here. The food is comparable at both places.", "author": "Kuldeep T."}

Words aren't going to capture how good it is, but the dishes are hearty and spicy and just make you happy. Ask for extra napkins -- you'll need them.", "author": "Joshua T."}

We had a party of nine because some of my friends from out of town were in the city, and the experience was great!  We ordered six entrees for all of us and I was full and happy at the end.  My favorite dish was the Alicha Beggee (Lamb), which was \"mildly seasoned cubes of lamb mixed with potatoes, carrots, and bell peppers.\"  It was super tasty and I loved the sourdough-ish flavor of the injera (spongy flat bread stuff that you use instead of a utensil).  The other dishes that I got to try (we ordered a platter of three dishes per table, so I only got to try the ones on my side of the table) were the Kelwa Mix and the Vegetable combination.  Both were delicious.  The Kelwa was marked as being spicy, so I was a bit worried because I'm not very good at handling spicy things, but it was delicious!  It wasn't that kind of spicy where your mouth it burning so bad that you can't enjoy the rest of the meal, but it added a zing to the dish that I found really enjoyable.  One star off because my friend ordered honey wine and it never got delivered, but there was only one server so I suppose it's slightly understandable.  Oh, and the other great thing was that we ordered 6 alcoholic drinks with our entrees and the total for nine people was just under $100.  Pretty damn good for San Francisco!  Mmmm.  I'll definitely be back... I've already been fantasizing about the lamb all day and I'm looking for an excuse to go back asap!", "author": "Kelli M."}

We made a reservation in advance, and although every other table in the place was packed, our table was reserved and we were seated immediately upon arrival.  As I knew from my previous dining experience at Assab, the food is delicious -- especially the chicken drumsticks.  Dishes run hot, but the friendly owner kept our water glasses full.  Family-style eating is always fun with the right group.  But what makes this a 5-star review is the friendly service to a rather boisterous bunch of friends and smiles for my baby.  I wouldn't dare to bring my baby to most restaurants in the city; you get dirty looks the moment you walk in the door with a stroller.  Since our daughter was born, we've been sticking to clearly family-friendly fare like Mel's, which means uninteresting food and atmosphere. On top of serving excellent Eritrean food, Assab is a family-owned place and we were welcomed.  Thank you, Assab, for a very happy birthday dinner!", "author": "Jenny G."}

I'm personally not so sure that I like the sponge pancake that is served with the food. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the mediocre service.", "author": "S N."}

I had never had this type of cuisine and was greatly looking forward to it.  When we got there, we gladly waited a half an hour to be seated.  Once we were seated, we ordered our food.  Well, we ended up waiting an hour for our food to come.  In that time we were waiting, NO ONE acknowledged our table.  No one checked on how we were doing.  No one offered some bread to tide us over.  No one apologized for the long wait.  I had ordered hot tea, and no one came to refill my hot water.  We were furious.  My stomach was aching because I was so hungry.  Needless to say, we ended up walking out without getting any food.  At that point, we didn't want to pay the restaurant for our experience or the food.  The service was ridiculous.  Even when we told the waitress that we were leaving, she didn't apologize.  That's just bad business.  I was very tempted to tell the table next to us being seated that they shouldn't waist their time.", "author": "Nani S."}
