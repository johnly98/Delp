They make a different gourmet pizza everyday on their signature sourdough crust. It has the perfect balance of a crisp exterior and a light and airy texture on the inside. I had a slice of their kalamata olive, spinach, fontana cheese, garlic oil, parsley & parmesan pizza and it was delicious. They also have a variety of sweet and savory breads you can order. \n\nThe employees enjoy what they do and are nice to speak to. Their pizza is popular so expect a crowd. Overall, the atmosphere is pleasant and I am definitely going to come back to try more items on the menu.\n\nTip: Check out their pizza menu online or just head over for a surprise.", "author": "Rachel M."}

Nothing special there.\n\nWhere they specialize is their bread. Wow that's really good. The breadstick is a bit firm and not warm/fresh, but the flavoring on it is spot on. Really enjoyed the cheese sprinkles on it.\n\nThe pizza is different than most pizza's because the dough is unlike anywhere else. It's quite flavorful and usually it's the dough that doesn't stand out in pizza, but here it's quite the opposite. The topping are usually simple (always vegetarian) and go very well with the dough.\n\nThe focaccia was also really good. Again, the emphasis is on the bread, and the toppings are just a little something extra.", "author": "Victor D."}

Friday at noon, there was a short line. The breads looked good but I was on a mission for pizza and so I grabbed a slice togo (today's special was the shiitake, portables, and button mushroom w/ sesame ginger garlic vinaigrette). It came out rather quickly and was piping hot. The mushrooms were plentiful and I like the addition of the vinaigrette which added a subtle sweetness to the pizza. The crust was a bit thicker and chewier than I normally prefer but I actually really enjoyed it - I think this is the first time I've ever tried a sourdough crust! \n\nAs for seating, there were only a few seats inside and a single bench outside (there's usually other seating outside but there's construction right now I believe). \n\nI read a few reviews mentioning a somewhat unfriendly cashier but the cashier working when I went today was very nice & I had zero problems with service. \n\nWill definitely be back for more slices & hopefully some baked goods!", "author": "Janice L."}

Prepare to wait in line if you're coming at a prime time. The staff are notoriously just the right amount of friendly--they are slammed and the level of efficiency of the individual serving as cashier at any given time is stellar. They have a great system here. The line moves quickly, but more importantly the cashier NEVER makes you feel RUSHED! \n\nMy go-to recommendations: pecan roll is out of this world and not-too-sweet; the shortbread is delectable and comes in fun holiday shapes/colors; the scones are to die for and like a true scone (less sugar, more flavor). They use organic ingredients when possible and you can really tell. I'm not a big fan of their cookies, but people are known to rave over them. \n\nThe pizza deserves a section all of it's own! It's so so good. The flavors they create together are incredible. I've yet to have the same one twice and LOVE all of the ones I've had (about 5). The crispness is PERFECT! Sometimes it's a wee bit too cheesy, but I'm not complaining. Plus it's $3 for a slice! Hello NYC pricing! Such a deal in SF. \n\nLOVE Arizmendi and recommend it to anyone in the area.", "author": "Shelley V."}

It's usually great.\n\nWe've been coming here happily ever since the place first opened.  Yeah.  The very first week, if not the exact first day.  \n\nSo, you can imagine that it takes a helluva lot to make a customer who has been happy -- whose whole family has been happy -- for many many years to write a negative review after one bad experience.\n\nIt was such a bad experience that, yeah, I'm\nDoing this one star thing that I hate to do.\n\nBlech.\n\n\nWe had a disappointing interaction here today, Sunday, August 26 at 4:45 pm, with the man at the register (6'3\"ish, white, well over 40) that left a terrible taste in our mouths even though we did not end up eating anything at all.\n\nAs I was reaching for a piece of focaccia and thinking of the other few items I wanted to bring to our friends' home, I heard the aforementioned man say \"no sampling from the bins\" in an accusatory voice... aimed at me???\n\n'Nahhh.. that makes no sense,' I thought.  \n\nI was clearly not eating anything or making any \"about to sample from the bin\" gestures.\n\nBut he was indeed staring at me sternly, as would a librarian at a patron talking on a cell phone.\n\nStrange.  \n\nI tried to disarm him with kindness/humor/a great big smile... showed him with empty hands etc that I'd not even thought of doing any nefarious bin sampling.  \n\n'Ok.  That should put him at ease.  We are all\nFriends here.'\n\nI went back to filling my bag of goodies.  'Must have had a hard day, that guy.  All's chill... carry on.'\n\nI approached the register as did my wife - the only other person selecting items at the time.  \n\nThey guy accused her of bin sampling too.\n\n\"Hey, that's no bin sampler, THAT'S MY WIFE!\"  \n\nNow, I was affronted.  You can insult me all day long and ... well, please don't, but, really that's not as bad as insulting my absolutely non-bin sampling wife, dammit.\n\nSo I started to calmly tell this man that his false accusations offended me and why... when he cut me off to say that he'd seen us both eating out of the bins.  \n\n'Ummm.... he might have had a tougher day than I realized and maybe he's actually hallucinating or I don't know what...'. Whatever was going on in his head, what came out of his mouth was simply offensive in tone and content and made both my wife and me feel unwelcome in the extreme.\n\nWe left our bags in the store and said we did not want to buy food there after all.  \n\nWould you have wanted to spend another second with that man talking to you that way?  Probably not even if you were super hungry and really wanted yummy baked goods.  \n\nSo... I'll go to other locations and eventually come\nback to this store on 9th ave too.

I came in just to pick up a baked good for the road, but saw the $10 min limit to use a credit card and was more than happy to choose a few more items. I ended up getting a plain shortbread cookie, a blueberry corn muffin, an apple scone, and a slice of pizza. \n\nThe shortbread cookie was AMAZING. At $2, it's kinda pricey for a plain Jane kind of a cookie, but so worth. I actually had planned to give it to my dad whose favorite cookie is shortbread. But of course I decided to to do some quality control and took a nibble out of it first. You can probably guess that I finished the whole cookie and my dad got nothing. But the cookie was buttery and crumbly, everything a good shortbread cookie should be. I am definitely going to load up on this next time I go. Also intrigued by the cardamom flavored one. \n\nThe slice of pizza I had was also really delicious. It was a mushroom pizza with a miso sesame dressing. It was so incredibly aromatic. While I was driving. I kept on opening my paper bag to smell it. The pizza crust was delicious but it was the dressing that pushed it over the top.\n\nThe blueberry corn muffin was good. They were generous with the blueberries and I love the texture cornmeal gives the muffin.

The kind of pining you get for your bed after a long day: excited to ease into a warm soft goodness that makes you forget all your worries.  Arizmendi is hard to bash because of their perfection.  Rarely do you get 5 stars all around from the average yelper save for the most conservative of yelpers but this place has done it.  \n\nTheir pizzas are perfectly doused in oil and delicious toppings and cooked to a delightful crisp along the edges.  I have enjoyed the one with roasted tomato on it and the one with corn and other \"fiesta\" appropriated toppings.  All the scones are amazing.  Buttery, sweet and a soft inner center.  Most of the time I eat multiple scones because you know I just want to learn how each one tastes.  I do the same with the pizzas.  Just to try them all.  No im addicted.  Everything is so good my gosh.\n\nCoffee is decent.  Cash only.  Outside seating is contained to a couple tables and a few benches.  No bathrooms.", "author": "Rob C."}

So naturally I thought to myself, \"Hm, I guess I should maybe get a pastry or (two) too.\" And that's how I ended up getting their cheese dough and ($3) and chocolate sourdough croissant ($3.75) in addition to the coffee.\n\nCame here pretty early around 8:30am on a weekday. Their doors were wide open and welcoming, sun was shining and the air was crisp. I'm so glad I got their pastries. They got me through a long road trip for hours. \n\nFirst off, I'm not sure about the others but the ones I selected were pretty dense. The chocolate sourdough croissant was so amazing that I almost wanted to stop and get a cup of milk somewhere. It was still warm inside so I'm assuming they were fresh out of the oven. As for the cheese dough, the more you chew the tastier it gets! It might be hard at first to rip off a piece but once you start chewing you taste the cheese flavor just oozing out. Both pastries kept me full for a while and they were even better with coffee.\n\nI'll have to go back next time I'm around the area to try some of their other baked goods!", "author": "Christine S."}

I'd heard so many good things about this place, and I'd always wanted to go, so finding this on my stroll was a nice surprise. I walked in...and oh my goodness...the wafting aroma of pizza, focaccia, bread, scones, muffins...*drools* give me all da carbs and gluttony\n\nCheese Board (in Berkeley) is my favorite restaurant in the Bay Area. They're also a worker owned co-op like Arizmendi. They serve one type of vegetarian sourdough pizza a day too. I was so, so, soooo excited to finally be trying Arizmendi's!! Upon first bite, I was craving more. Arizmendi did not disappoint. The cheese was the perfect gooeyness/rigidness, the crust was brown in all the right places, the toppings complemented each other to create the most savory, flavorful, aromatic taste...the pizza that day was house-made tomato sauce, smoked gouda, garlic oil, parsley and parmesan cheese, and it was absolutely delicious!! \n\nI think they have a $10 card minimum because I remember paying with cash since I only got the slice\n\nBottom line: I'll definitely be back!! The pizza was absolutely divine, and the other pastries and breads looked scrumptious too. The focaccia was calling my name, but I wasn't super hungry at the time...but I'll be back for you.

The other item that I couldn't get enough of was the cardamom shortbread cookie, which was an addicting flavor.  I'm glad I don't live nearby, or I would basically live on carby baked goods from here.  The only drawback is the tiny little space, and weird layout to grab your items while waiting in the long line.

I think it's better than their sister spot, Cheeseboard in Berkeley. Like Cheeseboard, they only offer one glorious flavor and it is ALWAYS delicious.\n\n2) Don't let the line turn you off. It moves quickly. I've never waited more than 10 minutes. \n\n3) Do grab a cup of coffee in a mug at the Beanery down the street and return the mug when you're done. It feels like home to have great coffee in a mug, and you can drink it while you stand in line. \n\n4) Do try the scones! My favorite is the oat scone. It's got a little more crunch and it's less biscuit-y than the scone of the day. But if you prefer a more biscuit-style scone, go for the scone of the day with delicious chunks of fruit in it. \n\n5) Do look for the pumpkin muffin! It's seasonal and phenomenal, with candied walnuts on top. Nothing's better with a warm cup of coffee. \n\n6) Don't forget they have a $10 cash minimum and they do tend to get grumpy about it, so bring cash. \n\n7) I don't have kids, but they seem to live for the breadsticks.

You can't really beat fresh baked breads, patries, cookies, pizza galore made with TLC.  Arizmendi is a co-op bakery, which means it's run by the community and I am all for that.  Thank you Arizmendi bakers for waking up at the crack of dawn every morning and start creating and baking all the goodies at 4am!  \n\nI don't think there's anything in the shop that I wouldn't like to eat.  Everything looks and smells delicious.  It's hard not to fill up a bag or two before getting to the register.  All the baked goods are made with wholesome, seasonal ingredients.  It's honest baking at it's best.  \n\nThis location is small but there are a few seats outside (although always filled with people).  Your best bet is to take it to go and you will end up taking some to go regardless if you eat there or not.  It's that good.  The only problem I have with the grab a bag in line and start filling it up system is that I always am so indecisive on what to get.  Everything looks so good, so it's hard to narrow down the selection.  Basically, by the time you have reached the register with your bag(s) of baked items, just tell the cashier what you have in the bag.  They never question you or look in the bag, so it's really an honor system.  They only accept cc payments if your total is more than $10.      \n\nOn my last visit, I picked up a raspberry and peach scone, a pecan roll and a slice of the daily pizza.  The scone was yummy just as other yelpers have mentioned - crisp on the exterior but soft like cake on the inside.  The pecan roll is like a cinnamon roll upgraded.  Nice and sticky, filled with pecans but not too sweet.  The pizza of the day was house-made tomato sauce, spinach, fontina, garlic oil.  Wasn't wowed by the pizza but it was good.

Affordable pizza that actually tastes good is here.\nI didn't know meatless pizza could taste so good. Of course it helps that the vegetables are seasoned well, topped with a lot of herbs, cheese, and fragrant oils. The crust is wonderfully thin and crispy. It does tend to get oily, though that doesn't bother me. I think my favorite is the marinated artichoke, spinach, garlic oil, parmesan pizza. Very strong savory flavors. I think I'm usually good with about two slices.\n\nThere's plenty of sweet and savory baked goods and fresh bread throughout the store. Plus, there is a decent cheese selection in the fridge. They sell Cowgirl here.\n\nI've tried some of their baked goods too. \n$2.75 Cheese Roll - perfectly baked golden brown with cheesy crust, with crisped up edges\n$2.50 Corn Blueberry Muffin - great muffin, some of the blueberries sink to the bottom, kind of looks like a hat\n$4.00 Brownie - rich with a hint of nuttiness \n\nThe pizza is still the best thing to get. \n\nThe bakery is a simple setup with a few seats along the walls and by the window, as well as some outdoor seating. \n\nMake loaves, not war.

As you wait in line, you can grab a paper bag and some wax paper to pick out your baked goods. They just have a few cases with selves of stuff. There's also bread which they'll grab for you behind the counter. I got a scone of the day (raspberry apple) and an oat scone - total came out to $5.75\n\nWhile these look like your typical scones, breaking into one was like taking a bite out of a moist cake. The outside has a harder shell but the inside is moist and fluffy. The texture is coarser than cake, but it's not really dry and crumbly like most scones. The oat scone is kind of like eating a giant oatmeal cookie with a hint of spice and some raisins scattered about. The raspberry apple scone was fruity though it would have been better with more apple chunks. These were slightly sweet but nothing overwhelming.

Is it supposed to be a bougie biscuit? A brittle bread??\n\nThankfully, Wiki came to the rescue. Scones are made with baking powder rather than the yeast that goes into most other sweet buns. \"Round British scones can resemble North American biscuits in appearance, but scones traditionally rely on cold butter, while biscuits are more often made with other kinds of animal fat or vegetable shortening. Also, while scones are frequently (but not always) sweet, and served with coffee and tea, biscuits are served more as a bread, often with breakfast. In recent years, scones under that name have begun to appear in coffee houses. They are universally sweet, often containing fruit such as blueberries or raspberries, or else such flavorings as cinnamon.\"\n\nSounds delicious, right? And Arizmendi's scones, $3, are perfect examples. My scone of the day was BERRYLICIOUS and contained the most delicious strawberries you'll ever eat, plus some organic flour, butter, sugar, buttermilk, cream, baking soda, baking powder, and sea salt (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizmendi-bakery-san-francisco?select=bwXm0l6XuvuHqzZzA8PYPQ). Upon first impression, I was reminded of a firm berry buttermilk biscuit in terms of texture and flavor, like KFC biscuits but with more judicious butter usage. The edges were browned and and had a delicious crunch to them. The roommate thought it was too dry for her tastes. When I microwaved the leftover portion the next day, it got softer and reminded me of berry buttermilk pancakes/waffles. 2-for-1!\n\nTheir BRIOCHE KNOT, $2.75, is less exciting. Made with organic flour, water, butter, sugar, buttermilk, cream, organic eggs, golden raisins, sea salt, yeast, and cinnamon, it resembles good bread with a nice glaze and some raisins...and not even that many raisins (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arizmendi-bakery-san-francisco?select=LmrMq0pOYvMm84CypHYAiQ).

The thing that stood out the most was the scone,  definitely the best scone I ever had, it wasn't dry which is my main complaint when I eat scones, it was pure deliciousness.\n\nOverall all it's definitely worth the visit, I will definitely be back in the near future.\n\nPs: the baguette was sold out and it was 11 am so it must be good.", "author": "Josh Giosue D."}

However, this line is always long... because it's so good. I just picked up a bialy after visiting the autobody shop down the street this morning. Oh man, it was sooooo goood and actually quite inexpensive ($2.25) for a pastry compared to a Starbucks for example. I highly recommend you get a bialy (onion & poppyseed). It was warm when I picked it up too and it smells delicious inside. :) Also, they take credit card now for purchases over $10, otherwise I think it's cash only. There really isn't much indoor seating, so don't count on it, but they do have an outdoor seating parklet (I think that's the correct word for it). However, it's the inner sunset, where it's often cold. Would only hesitate to go back if the line was ridiculous.", "author": "Julie L."}

The pizza of the day was a delicious pesto, tomato, and mozzarella masterpiece. The crust was thin and crisp. The flavors were aromatic and strong, which worked together so nicely. My only regret was that I had just one slice. Next time I'll get two... or three.... or the whole pizza. They make a different pizza every day so you can come here frequently and still be able to mix it up and try new/ different things. Genius idea. \n\nThey also have scones of the day. Not as delicious as the pizza, but hearty and not too sweet. The star was the ricciarelli (my grandfather always calls them 'wedding cookies'). They were some of the best I have ever had. Again I was regretting only getting one. \n\nNot a lot of seating, but that doesn't seem to be to much of a problem. There is a nice little \"parklet\" where you can enjoy your meal/ snack and do some people watching.", "author": "Catherine H."}

CASH ONLY for purchase less than $20.\n\nFOOD: I got a pecan roll ($3) from one of the pastry stands and it was delicious and satisfying. It looked like a flattened/condensed cinnamon roll but not as sweet. It was about the size of my hand. The pastry was not too sweet but had brown sugar drizzle and sugar-coated pecan. I could have saved half for dessert but it was so good that I ate everything in one setting. I didn't feel grossed out because it didn't taste like it would give me diabetes. They also sell freshly made pizza for $2.50/slice or $22/whole pizza. \n\nPRICE: I paid $3 in cash and was very happy with my spontaneous purchase.\n\nSETTING: Located on one of the busiest intersection in inner sunset, the place gets crowded during breakfast or brunch hours. There are 3 small tables inside and a few benches & tables outside. Whenever I pass by there is always a line. On Sundays there is also a whole food market right across the street! \n\nSERVICE: I stood in line for less than 5 minutes to pay for my pastry. The cashier was also very nice and friendly. \n\nOVERALL IMPRESSION: I've always heard about this place and I wasn't disappointed.

One of my top favorites is their mushroom with sesame SOOOOO GOOOD and tasty! Their scones are always really good as well. They have a variety of flavors that they interchange with daily. Strawberry and blackberry are my two top flavors. Now for their savory. They have really good cold mushroom pizza and AMAZING Tomato and cheese bread (not sure of the correct name). Its lightly salted with a thin slice of tomato. The bread is always crunchy on the outside and soft and doughy in the inside, a MUST HAVE. \n\nNow for their drinks. I have only really had their coffee and mocha. Both are tasty. I never really get the small because their small is REALLY small lol. They have good Mochas also, however I always ask for extra hot.\n\nArizmendi has been on 9th Ave for 12+ years and they are a worker-owned co-op which I think is great because they really put in a lot of work and dedication to their amazing pastries, artisan breads, and pizzas.", "author": "Gabrielle C."}

I wasn't yet aware that Arizmendi was related to Cheese Board until seeing the Cheese Board Collective Works book on a shelf above the coffee supplements counter. Hence the pizza craze. \n\nTo me, pizza can only be so good. I was here solely to treat myself to the pastries. Grab a paper bag and some tissue paper right inside the door to keep your goodies in. I split a Strawberry Scone and Blueberry Coffee Cake. From the outside, the scone was nothing impressive. But once I broke off a piece, revealing the golden center, I knew this was a scone of scones. The outside is hard enough to give your teeth something to crunch into, but not so firm as to be brittle. The fruit is sweet and just a tad tart, and if I were one of these strawberries I would happily surround myself with the cakey goodness that makes up the rest of this scone. \n\nAfter the scone I was prepared to be disappointed with the coffee cake. First off, it was massive - I have pretty small hands, but this slab actually dwarfed one of them when I held it up. Not to mention I was pretty full already. I broke off a piece of the crusty side, taking care to get some of the oats sprinkled on top. It was good, but I've never been a huge fan of coffee cakes because of the cinnamon. My partner in crime mentioned that we should just ditch the top crust. After I tried a piece from just the airy, airy center I knew why. Give me this cake (minus the top) for every birthday and I will love you forever. This cake possesses a comforting sweetness with a hint of almond flavor, it's soft on the palate and light in your mouth. A few sips of latte in between bites rounded out this perfect snack. \n\nIf you're here on a sunny day, try to get some curb space outside and enjoy the air while you're in Arizmendi's neighborly arms. I felt too hot while I was inside with the ovens going full blast in the back, but there are a few tables where you can get a cup of water and sit down while you wait. I'm also told there is a bathroom down outside, down a hallway adjacent to the bakery, but I was also told it wasn't very clean. If the rest of the pastries taste this good though, my stomach will be back to collect them all.", "author": "Helen S."}

It was my first time here so I was unsure of how it worked, but you pretty much grab a paper bag and fill it with whatever baked goods you want.  If you want pizza by the slice you can order at the cashier.  The pizza seemed to be a very popular but I didn't see a vegan option for it.\n\nI filled my bag with some of the vegan options like focaccia with zucchini, poppy seed muffin and couple of English muffins to take home.  After I paid, my BF and I sat outside and tried the vegan focaccia.   We loved the homemade sauce and the crust was the bomb.  We were fighting over the one piece we got and it was the last piece in the case too!

We passed by Arizmendi and I noticed the smell of pizza and a short line. I popped inside, just for a look. But I couldn't help myself. I had to buy something. I'd spotted a oat-filled scone that looked full and filling and textured.\n\nWhile my friends went and got the car, which was more than a few blocks away, I stood online and considered my options. I knew I wanted the scone, but the pizza of the day, the cookies, and the other treats all looked good. Thinking the scone would be it and that would be that, I made my way to the cashier, only to find that they had a ten dollar minimum. I grabbed a sugar cookie (enormous, puffy) and a croissant (buttery and flaking gently). The sum was 8.45 but she left me off with a warning.\n\nWe three split the purchases in our car. Me in the backseat divvying up the wares. We agreed the cookie was the best - how could it not be? But as far as satisfaction went, I loved the scone.\n\nWhatever. Go here. Try it all!

Their focaccia is also delicious - a great option to bring home and reheat for a perfectly crisp crust.\n\nOne star subtracted, though, for the things I've tried and found underwhelming - the \"chocolate thing\" (pretty boring and dense) and the brownie (not as rich a flavor/texture as I would have hoped.)\n\nI would say most things are good, and you just have to know what to get!

I'm in!\n\nWhile visiting and roaming around San Francisco, I wanted to go for some of the best eats. Looking at the reviews on Yelp, this place seemed promising. Like Cheeseboard, Arizmendi makes one pizza a day to sell. The place overall is pretty small inside with limited seating. They have a small seating section outside as well. You can buy pizza by the slice, or a whole one.\n\nThere was a small line when we got there, but that gave us time to look at some of their freshly baked goods. I decided on their oats scone and a green tea shortbread. We decided to get a whole pizza since we are such hungry eaters.\n\nWe were able to get the seats by the window. They have a water dispenser and cups for those eating there. The pizza crust is made of sourdough so it's a different spin on your classic kind of pizza. At first I didn't really taste the sourdough, but then it started to hit me with every bite. It's different, but it actually works well. The pizza we ordered was a take on a traditional margarita pizza. You could taste the quality of the cheese and the pieces of ricotta throughout were to die for. The clumps just burst with flavor. I really appreciated the quality of the tomato sauce because it tasted very fresh. The only thing I would change is more basil. There just didn't seem like enough basil on the pizza and a margarita pizza is known for that basil! Our pizza came out piping hot because it was served to us right out of the oven. Because of that, we suffered some pretty bad damage on the roofs of our mouths but I think it was worth it for super fresh pizza.\n\nThe oat scone was so crumbly but moist. It had little raisins throughout and the oat flavor was just screaming out at you. It does dry out your mouth so have water or milk on hand. The green tea shortbread was my favorite though. I love when you can see the actual specs of tea leaves throughout tea desserts. It makes it more fresh and the flavor more authentic. If you love green tea, then this shortbread will be a real treat. It has that bitter taste of green tea, but it is balanced out because of the sweetness from the shortbread crust. \n\nWhole pizzas are roughly $20 and the baked desserts range depending on what it is. Overall, pricing is fair for the quality and size. Great little place to step by while in San Francisco.", "author": "Liz C."}

The crowd is very classic Inner Sunset - a bit grungy, edgy, and leftist in the 90s way. The pastries and pizza are great. The pecan rolls are like a go-to comfort food for me. The coffee is very mediocre, though. You'd think a place with such indie, edgy pretentions would put some more thought into the quality of coffee. \n\nMy biggest gripe about this place is the definite exclusionary, clique-ish vibe - like many places in San Francisco. Whenever I go there, I don't quite feel welcome there. Staff is pretty indifferent, at least towards me. I'd sit down on the bench, in close quarters with others, and I always get the feeling they don't want me sitting there. \n\nAs much as Arizmendi feels so much part of me and my neighborhood, I always feel a \"rejecting\" sort of vibe when I go there. I'd love to go there some more, but I simply do not feel welcome or comfortable there. There are too many places in SF that feel \"me\", and I love the food, but it seems the staff and clientele would rather not have me there. That's just really sad. :(", "author": "Alecia K."}

A typical cashier would say \"how many would you like?\"  Then I asked what type of pizza they had that day and he just walked off without responding.

I'd come here, get some pizza, a scone, a cookie, some bread, you name it.\n\nThere's something very warm about the place, and it's not just the ovens baking their fresh bread and rolls in the back. It's a Cooperative, meaning that everyone who works here is a partial-Owner of the company. There is no tip jar because everyone working here makes a decent living wage. On top of the fact that they serve amazing, organic bread and other delicious things at an affordable price?

Not used to thinking about \"produce\" on your pizza? Come try it and see what I'm talking about. I've had cauliflower curry, sesame and bok choy, and squash on my pizza before (not all at once, but one can dare to dream).\n\n-The blackberry/raspberry scones are amazing, if they happen to be in season when you stop by, grab one.\n\n-The WOLVERINES are something I subsisted off of for a good long while when I cut out processed sugar for a year. They are humble-looking, but delicious, rolls made from organic, unbleached wheat, dried fruit, and sweetened with sucanat (dried can syrup). Eat piece-by-piece with butter and enjoy.\n\n-Their chai base is homemade and very flavorful, it's also not too sweet. Many cafes use Oregon Chai, which is boring and flavor-lacking so any place that makes their own base is usually good at everything else, too.\n\n-Arizmendi carries Columbia Gorge juices for $3.50.

My mistake was picking up a smaller paper bag, and I ended up needing to switch to a larger one because I wanted to try everything! \n\nA few favorites:\n\nMushroom focaccia\nChocolate thing (lol yes that's the actual name)\nCowgirl cookie\nCherry scone\n\nNormally, I don't like scones because they're usually very hard and dry; however their scone was crispy on the outside, moist on the inside. I was a bit hesitant about the Chocolate Thing because it seemed hard on the outside; but when I bit into it, it was soft! I also loved that there was chocolate chips in every bite. You get to really enjoy the pastry without missing out on chocolate in each bite :)\n\nTo top it off, their cowgirl cookie was stellar. It was a tasty, soft cookie with oats, raisins, and chocolate. \n\nUnf, so many carbs but zero regrets.", "author": "Grace H."}

I didn't like myself for taking so long to finally try Cheeseboard in Berkeley, but I dislike myself even more for letting so much time pass between my last couple of visits to Arizmendi.  Cheeseboard was (somewhat) forgivable since it's out in the East Bay, but Arizmendi?  Inexcusable!  Same owners, same great pizza...and just a short drive away with no toll??  Man, you'd think I'd be here all the time!\n\nAlthough the veggie-hating child inside me still has trouble believing it, the pizzas here are awesome!  Like Cheeseboard, Arizmendi only makes one type of pizza each day (vegetarian), but they have several varieties that they rotate through.  The most recent one I tried was topped with Spinach, Red Onions, Feta Cheese, and a Balsamic Vinaigrette...YUM.  With a crispy crust, plenty of tasty vegetables, and oodles of cheese, it was so good!  I'm not sure I could go longer than a week or two on a vegetarian diet, but it helps to know I can just pig out on these babies the whole time.\n\nThe pizza schedule is posted online in case you want to sneak a peek before stopping in, but there's really no need to worry - each one I've tried has been great.  Besides, what's the worst case scenario?  If you walk in and don't like the day's offering, just pick up some of their awesome pastries and baked goods instead (love their coffee cakes!).  And if your inner-carnivore starts to make some noise, shut it up with another bite of delicious pizza and tell it \"you're welcome!\".  That's what I do.", "author": "Mike L."}

There are a million other places you could go. Go wait forever for a seat at Little Star! Crowd back into Arinell's and dab your slice with a napkin, you philistine! \n\nSeriously tho, Arizmendi's slices are a whole different kind of pie than you'll find around The Bay ...except at their sister spot, The Cheese Board in Berkeley. Both tend to be light on the sauce, heavy with a flavorful oil of some sort (for example, truffle) and dressed with enough co-op veggies (sunchokes, broccolini, heritage tomatoes) to make a teenage boy cry out for Totinos.\n\nIf you're a pizza glutton (I am--isn't everyone when it comes to pizza?), take heart--Arizmendi pizza is CHEAP ($2.50 a slice), pies are available by the box, and they come with a tiny extra sliver of 'za if you buy single slices.\n\nSlight discount if you mention you rode your bike (don't lie--they know!).", "author": "Jackson S."}

Served on a thin sourdough crust and perfectly crisp, their pizzas are definitely my favorite in San Francisco! They're so cheesy, all vegetarian, and the ingredients used are so fresh! If it has mushrooms and/ or garlic oil, there's a very high chance that I'm coming in for a delicious, mouthwatering slice.\n\nI've tried several of their pastries and cookies as well. Although I normally despise scones because of their dryness, Arizmendi's scones aren't too bad. They're a little moist and have a perfectly balanced dough to fruit ratio. The shortbread cookies are great as well, and I usually enjoy their weekly special flavored ones, such as lavender or green tea!\n\nExcept the pizzas, everything here is self-serve, and I'm not a big fan of that because I'm very very paranoid of whether or not people use the wax paper or their hands. The staff is super friendly.

Enjoy yourself a massive slice of foccacia bread, a freshly baked slice of pizza, a cookie (which are vegan, 'cause why not), a scone, a variation on some of San Francisco's well known sourdough bread, or any other heavenly combination of dough and/or batter that they have come up with.\n\nI picked up a few items, the star of the show for me being the Strawberry Scone (the scone of the day). My intention was to eat it later, but I didn't make it too far out the door before I helplessly devoured it. The batter had a superb dryness to moisture ratio: not overly soft, but not tooth-shatteringly hard either, a failing that many lesser evolved scones tend to fall into. The natural sweetest and moisture of the fresh strawberries seeped into the bread, making for the best scone experience I have had in my life. That's right: I declare this to be the best scone I have ever had.\n\nScone aside, I also couldn't help but also buy a Chocolate Mint Cookie and a Zampano (a wonderful doughy bun topped with light cheese and red pepper seasoning) for something savory. All were amazing, not to mention so well-priced that I didn't even come close to breaking the $10 credit card minimum.\n\nAn excellently managed, well-concevied, and do-good local bakery off of San Francisco's Market street that is committed to nothing more than making people happy, one foccacia at a time.\n\nRecommendation - A piece of Foccacia for now, and a Scone for later", "author": "Derek K."}

I wanted to get something for later.  I think the format of the storefront is odd.  Like how you have to open each little drawer and use the tissue and bag for everything.  It's just too cluttered (thus is why you see a line sometimes forming out the door).  But my biggest gripe is the foccaica were all shoved in there.  These are big, cheesy and soggy pieces of bread.  They should be individually laid flat and be put in something sturdier than a paper bag (the oil seeped through a little even when double bagged).  Bf & I chose their Southwest foccacia ($3.75) to share for later that night and we got his mom a chocolate croissant ($3.25).   \n\nHis mom thought the chocolate crossaint, though it looked very flakey, was just okay. The Southwest foccacia had corn, tomatoes, and cheese on it.  Some of the cheese and tomatoes fell off in the bag.  I loved the bread and though their foccacia is more pizza like than traditional foccacia it was a nice change of pace.  It didn't wow me though however.  I know everyone raves about their pizza, so I probably should have gotten a slice or two to bring home instead.

And in that case, Arizmendi's is the gateway to hell.  \n\nAfter a much-deserved beer across the street, I dropped by to get a few slices to go.  Around 4:00 p.m. on the Sunday before Christmas, when the rest of San Francisco was dead for all intents and purposes, there was a line winding out of the door.  \n\nWhile you wait in line, there are bins of pastries to your left to keep you occupied.  The girl in front of me could not seem to control herself and grabbed bag after bag of baked goods.  She must have amazing metabolism.  As for my metabolism-challenged self, I chose a single cheese scone to enjoy tomorrow morning (I am in a savory mood after a full weekend of peppermint bark).  That scone will cost me a full hour at the gym tomorrow.  \n\nAB does a different pizza everyday.  Luckily, AB posts their pizza calendar online, making it easy for me to avoid all mushroom days, as I am fungi-adverse. Today's pizza featured sweet potatoes, goat cheese, red onion, shallot oil, parsley and Parmesan.  That combination works very well for me (crazy delicious).  My only regret is that I did not take a whole pizza home for hoarding purposes.  When you order pizza, they take your name and will call you when it's ready. The bakery itself is tiny--there's about three tables inside--not exactly ideal for waiting, but AB served up my order right quick.  If you just order slices, it comes wrapped in environmentally friendly aluminum foil.  Nice!  \n\nI noticed they had a few gluten-free options for your pain-in-the-ass friends and family members.  You know who you are.  \n\nI ordered a medium coffee in an attempt to cross-cancel the 3/4 of an IPA I had imbibed (I'm a lightweight these days).  I was very impressed with that coffee--it was super fresh and very, very good.  I think the brand was Centro, but don't quote me as I had IPA-induced short term memory loss.\n\nI note that I was able to park right in front of the bakery.  *Bonus.  I went to pay the meter and the meter was $2.00/hour without the option to pay with a card  (unlike the smart meters on the Embarcadero).  Yeezus, $2.00 for parking and you expect me to have quarters for that?  I'd love to know who is carrying around $2.00 worth of quarters with them, but I'd be willing to bet they're using them as a substitute for brass knuckles.  I decided to roll the dice (and not pay) because in general, I feel like a jackass asking a business to give me $2.00 worth of change.  Luckily, I was not ticketed by Law & Order: Special Parking Unit.  Even if you do get a parking ticket in San Francisco, you can pay the fine by volunteering at the Food Bank (so awesome).  \n\nThat reminds me, AB is CASH ONLY.  I can keep complaining about \"cash only,\" but it's clearly an exercise in futility.  I love this spot--I'll definitely be back.  P.S.

Although thin, the crust has a lot of flavor that is complemented by the vinaigrette. Definitely a must try!\n\n2. roasted yukon gold potatoes, mixed greens, Dubliner cheese, garlic oil, chives and parsley - another favorite of mine! The potatoes are sliced very thinly and are nice and crispy with each bite of the pizza. The cheese is very distinct and adds a nice bold flavor to the pizza. \n\nEach slice is $2.50 but I usually like to get a whole pizza and freeze the rest for lunch or dinner. Their pizzas are so good, you cannot simply leave with just having one or two slices. I have also tried their foccacia bread, which is also amazing! Their pastries and breads are a must try while you wait in line to order your pizza ;)", "author": "Wendy Z."}

A bread craving, not sweets.) \n\nI looked around and saw no tray. So, I grabbed a bag and filled it with a Focaccia, a bread stick & a few petite baguette. I hope this is the right process of getting my breads.\n\n- Focaccia: Smells delicious! It smells like fresh basil and thyme. Just from smelling it, my mouth was drooling. It had pieces of eggplants and onions. It was just oh so delicious that I would order this everyday if I can. \n- Breadstick: It's perfect. It's not one of those thick rolls/sticks, but a thin one. There's a nice crunch to it and it's sprinkled with parmesan cheese (I think, it's parmesan), which feels like the whole bread eating experience seem like eating at a 5 star restaurant. It's good quality bread.\n- Petite baguette: What can I say, it's just as good as all the other goodies in this bakery. Smells great with the sesame seeds on top. And it's great for making mini sandwiches. YUMS!\n\nTip: Please don't paper-bag your Focaccia, the olive oil from it will break your bag. Ask for a plastic bag from the cashier and he'll be happy enough to give you one. I'm so thankful for this, because if I didn't ask, it would've fell through the paper bag.", "author": "Jane C."}

The holidays were upon us, and it would not be a traditional Christmas without a BUCHE DE NOEL cake for dessert.\n\nThe PERFECT 'BUCHE DE NOEL'  was found at Arizmendi Bakery !  (Just LOOK at the photo...makes you want to lick the screen, doesn't!)\n\nAbsolute heaven! The bakers were angels to have extra BUCHE DE NOELs on Christmas eve for those of us who did not order in advance. (yes, shame on me , I was a naughty boy for not pre-ordering. But, no guilt at ARIZENDI BAKERY. They had several on hand for their customers!)\n\nARIZMENDI BAKERY made our Christmas dinner complete with our traditional dessert, the BUCHE DE NOEL. MERCI \n\nIt truly was chocolate heaven with whipping cream filling. Even, the meringues mushrooms were so tasty, and perfectly formed. \"They're so cute.\", exclaimed my mom. \n\nAnd now, for your FOODIE HISTORY LESSON:   NAPOLEON BONAPARTE created the first 'SPARE THE AIR DAY' & obliquely ,the first BUCHE DE NOEL. How? Pray tell, you say. Parisians were ordered not to use their fireplaces around Christmas because the air quality became so bad in Paris. So Parisian bakers came up with a symbolic substitute, the BUCHE DE NOEL (chocolate cake in shape of a log). The BUCHE DE NOEL is a time honored Christmas traditional dessert in France. \n\nArizmendi Bakery made the best in San Francisco ! (I've had others, mind you.) It also looked super fantastically beautiful.  (OTHER bakeries and OTHER stores had gooey messes on display..those 'yule logs' looked very unappetizing. ).\n\nAlso, I'd like to mention. After constantly trying to find edible bread in the City. (OK, I've been spoiled by the bakers in Paris.) Well, I've found the top bread on the list. ARIZMENDI BAKERY's breads are wonderful. Nice and tasty, and surprisingly crunchy crust. My mom and I just marvel over the complexity of the taste. And, yes, we go across the City just to pick up their bread! \n\nMERCI ARIZMENDI BAKERY for making the best BUCHE DE NOEL outside of PARIS...and some of the best breads outside of PARIS. You've hit the high marks and the gourmet stars in SAN FRANCISCO.", "author": "Addadada A."}

If you want reasonable prices in unreasonable San Francisco, this is your place. If you have high standards for your food, sadly, this isn't your place. The overall quality- texture and flavor- for most of their products is quite poor. A recent cranberry scone had few cranberries and an insane amount of sugar. A corn and salsa verde roll was flavorless and chewy. A gluten free carrot muffin had acceptable texture and crumb but again, an INSANE amount of sugar. The one thing that was good was the pizza of the day (bakery style pizza, not pizzeria style)- not enough of an endorsement for a place that sells so many items.  I'd rather buy fewer pastries at a better bakery than more Arizmendi.

I always like to get a corn cherry and then something more adventurous.  I should mention that I hate corn, but their signature scone never tastes corn-y, thank God.  They should probably rename the corn cherry to something that matches what it tastes like: \"flaky on the outside, moist on the inside, buttery everywhere, dusted with sugar and deliciousness.\"  But I suppose that would be too long and cumbersome.\n\nMore recently, I ventured to try their pizza.  Silly me, I should have done so sooner since I didn't realize Arizmendi is a sister co-op to Berkeley's Cheeseboard (http://www.arizmendibakery.org/about)!  Always vegetarian, always served fresh out of the oven, and always delicious!  Last time I tried their mushroom medley, which consisted of no less than three different types of mushrooms, topped with garlic, shallots, and a ginger sesame sauce.  I was worried from the description that it'd be fungi overload, but this pizza really impressed me.  Each ingredient brought something to the table and most importantly, the flavors all worked together.  Arizmendi, how did you do it?!\n\nAs with a lot of these local little eateries in Inner Sunset, seating is extremely limited.

After realizing they (more than) dabble with pastries, and seeing a lull in the line after brunch at Park Chow, I stopped in to pick up one of their renowned pecan rolls, as well as their scone of the day (a blueberry raspberry one), for $5.50.\n\nHeading home and popping them into the toaster oven for a bit, I can say that both were quite delicious. The pecan roll, albeit a little too sweet (black coffee would have been great), had some great flavor, along with a crunchy exterior and soft interior. The scone was tasty as well, with much more subtle flavors than the pecan roll, and would have been even better with some butter or jam - it was, however, a bit dry, as most scones I've had are (which is a major reason I'm generally not a fan). \n\nWhile I think I'm still a bigger fan of Tartine's pastries, Arizmendi offers up a different selection of things, and is certainly worth checking out.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - While the bakery is pretty accessible, the layout of the interior could have been better thought out. As you enter, you'll come across their pastries in three separate display pantries, two along the left, with the second and third forming a corner (which turns out to be a bit of a bottleneck). Some of you may also have some difficulty reaching pastries on the upper shelves, but with so many people around, I'm sure someone will be willing to help.\n\nBathroom - I suspect there aren't any public restrooms, given the size of the place.", "author": "Johnny W."}

When you pay about $30 for a cake, it should be edible.  The cake inside was OK. The frosting ruined the cake. It had so much sugar that you could barely taste the cake. It literally was enough to kill a diabetic on the spot.  I had to scrape the frosting off on the outside. There was still a layer of frosting between the 2 layers of cake and it was still too sweet. In this day and age when SF has banned soda from school vending machines because of the epidemic of diabetes and obesity, Arizmendi should be more health aware and not use so much sugar in their cakes.  When I inquired why JY went to get this cake. The response was that Yelpers liked it.  I will say that THIS Yelper would not pay any amount of $ for a cake with that much sugar.  That is like poison to the body.", "author": "Ry T."}

There's already a small crowd out front during the mornings, and it swells just as pizzas are about to come out at around 11am. \n\nI've tried almost all of their breads, my favorites are the Wolverine, Foccaccia (changes flavor all the time too) and Sourdough. I've also eaten their scones, cookies, and some of their special breads throughout the week, but their pizza is what go there for. \n\nIf you ever take a day off from work and have the whole city at your disposal, this is one of those places you should plan to hit up.

They use aluminum, paper, and cardboard, so it's a decent place for the environmentally friendly.\nThe only thing to beware of is that the people who work behind the counter, while they are cool, good at their jobs, and funny, they won't take your crap--don't hold up the line for your phone call or touch the baked goods with your hands unless you want to get sarcastically chewed out by the management. For me, this is a plus. It keeps the long line moving.", "author": "Allxie C."}

I was a little bit skeptical when I read about a bakery that makes good pizza. It makes sense that a bakery would make good bread, but pizza? Nonsense. I kept imagining the pie to have ingredients topped on foccacia bread. But my fears were relieved when I set my eyes on their pizza of the day. This place has a different pizza everyday and they even have a calendar for every month. The pizzas are made hot after 11:30 am so we made sure to get there around noon. This particular location does not have much seating so we were lucky to grab a table for two. Foot traffic was heavy around lunch time, but we got our pizza in a timely fashion. \n\nThe pizza of the day was a tomato, red onion, basil, and pesto pizza. I am a lover of thin crust pizza and believe me when i say that it was one of the best that I've ever had. Not only were the flavors delicious, but the texture of the crust was amazing. Crisp on the bottom and chewy on top and with a sourdough aftertaste? I'm in pizza heaven. At $2.25 a slice and $18 for a whole pie, you can buy as little or as much as you want without feeling guilty of paying more or less because it equates to the same price per slice. I didn't really think about that before I ordered a whole pie, but in the end, it was worth eating four slices each (although two slices would be perfect). I was so full, I couldn't even sample some of their shortbreads. All is well - best pizza I've had in San Francisco thus far.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

There was a line about ten deep that stretched to the door.  After a relatively short wait, we made our way to the front where the scones were located.  We got four scones:  apricot blackberry, oat, corn-cherry, and currant.  Staring at all these baked goodies, the raspberry apricot coffee cake was calling and we added a piece to our purchase as well.\n\nThe scones were delicious.  Everyone complemented how tasty they were and that it had the perfect airiness and texture with a slight sugary crust on them.

They make a certain amount of pizzas a day and whenever customers want to order one, they'll heat up a whole one and serve you your slice. Yesterday I went in and waited in line for a good 5-10 minutes and when I reached the front to order my slice, the cashier told me they ran out of pizza. I can't imagine what expression was on my face but he told me it was the saddest look he'd seen all day. He then suggested that there's a lot of other good stuff like the foccacia bread. So I dolefully walked back to the bread shelf and selected one of the many different foccacias available. Then stood back in the long 5-10 minute line again.. and when it was finally my turn at the front, the cashier told me that someone just cancelled their pie order and now there's a slice for me!

I waited in line and when I reached the cashier he said place it on the scale and it turns out that slice piece was only $3.30. And I became overly ecstatic because I only spent $3  on lunch.

If there's one important thing I took away from those LSAT classes it was his recommendation for Arizmendi.\n\nPros: \nFreshly baked pizzas, pastries, and breads daily! This worker-owned bakery makes the best gourmet pizzas I've ever had. If you're into deep dishes and traditional pizzas (pepperoni, Hawaiian, etc.), this place may not be for you. All their pizzas are vegetarian thin crust pizzas and rarely offer them with tomato sauce (something I really love about Arizmendi). Don't let the veg option scare you away though. They combine their toppings in a way that can convince almost any meat lover to turn Arizmendi into their go-to pizza stop. Their pastries and artisan breads always taste fresh. I highly recommend their focaccia and any flavored coffee cake they have. You won't be disappointed.\n\nI've been going to Arizmendi before they put a parklet in front of the store and I have to say, that parklet is probably one of the best business decisions they've ever made. More customers can now enjoy their meal as soon as they buy it.\n\nCons: \nSpace inside is limited, but don't let that stop you - especially now that there's a parklet! Parking on weekends and peak hours will always be a nuisance (as it is everywhere in SF). Sometimes they'll run out of certain items, such as their focaccia, but can you really blame them? \n\nTips: \nIf you're local, definitely take the bus (there's a stop right around the corner). Always check out their menu online for their daily breads, pastries, and especially pizza (they only serve one type of pizza per day, but it's a different one every day). There's also a minimum amount you have to purchase in order to use your credit card, so have some cash handy just in case. \n\nOverall: The best pizza place in the city. Thank goodness there's a location for East Bay folks!", "author": "Audrey L."}

Still, though, a well-made slice of pizza with quality ingredients.\n+ The two benches in the store!  I love benches!  I love places with benches!  Very cute. Very lovely. They make me happy.  \n+ You can have lunch/dinner for $2.50; that's how much a slice costs.\n\nOh, and they have a great collection of crusty and drool-inducing breads.

Vegan mint chocolate cookie ($2) - Minty fresh like an Andes! and OMGG.. they have chocolate cake with salted caramel frosting. Their chocolate's yummy, big chocolate chip pcs, not chunks, or teeny weeny chips. They're not stingy with the chocolate pcs. either as there's a nice chocolate-to-thing ratio with everything. If you love chocolate like me, that's an important factor. \n\nPizzas really good and flavorful with a sourdough crust.

I would gladly keep up any sweets for baked goods, and Arizmendi has some great baked goods in both the sweet and savory department. \n\nOne of my favorite things to eat with bread is cheese and just like some comment say, the cheese breadsticks are indeed AMAZING.  That particular visit, I was able to get some fresh ones and it was just bomb.  I also had their flavored shortbread [rosemary] and it was delicious.  \n\nBeing from the Southbay, its rare for me to visit Arizmendi and that makes me sad.

Sweet bread, savory bread, sourdough, seedy, wheaty, fruity, buttery, yeasty, yummy yummy yummy! \n\nI've been meaning to visit Arizmendi for the past 3 years, but have been afraid to do so because of this passionate love of bread that I just mentioned. (It's so hard to say no to good bread...) But when a household need for pan de muerto (bread of the dead) arose at the end of last week, my visit could wait no longer. And oh, the wonders I found!\n\nIt is my understanding that Arizmendi has bread of the dead available on October 31, November 1, and November 2 each year in honor of Halloween and D\u00ed\u00e1 de los Muertos. Their version is shaped like a little body, the dough flavored with candied orange and anise, sprinkled with a fine sugar. And oh, it is delicious! They make a limited quantity, so calling to reserve a loaf or two in advance is a good idea.\n\nWhile picking up my bread of the dead, I couldn't help but also take home a \"chocolate thing,\" a lightly sweet yeast roll with chocolate chips. It should have fed two people at tea time, but there was no one else home to wrestle it away from me. (I'm not complaining. Yum!) I so appreciate a bread that is not overly sugary or buttery, but rather has yeasty, toothy goodness...and chocolate. That combination is surprisingly hard to find!\n\nMaybe my favorite thing about this bakery, aside from the obvious deliciousness, is the fact that the bakers are all making more breads right behind the counter while you stand in front of the cases of rolls, loaves, scones, and muffins. There is nothing about bread that I love more than seeing how it comes together at the hands of an expert. \n\nCash only, and bring extra for the unexpected scones, pecan swirls, and baguettes that leap off the shelves and into your bread-lovin' arms.

Invariably, the day turns into a full Tour de Fat with my appetite and the delicious offerings that Arizmendi provides. Walking into this small, almost hole-in-the-wall establishment, you'll find three display cases full of goodies and tasty treats. The one on your immediate left is usually filled with savory goods and a random assortment of rolls. The one on your left as you enter more into the store usually has general breads that range from savory to sweet to \"plain\" (I only use plain for a lack of better flavor descriptions, but they're definitely far from plain). As you hit the display that faces the front of the bakery, you hit the motherload: all sorts of pastries ranging from scones to cookies to muffins.\n\nMy favorites from here must be the scones and focaccia. The scones are moist and decadent with a nice crunchy topping to contrast the soft and delicious bottom. Arizmehdi serves their scones in huge portions so one block is more than enough. Filled with items ranging from cherries to cranberries  to apples, these fruity scones will never disappoint. As for their focaccia, I never knew I could love such a simple piece so much. You'll forget all of your preconceived notions about focaccia after trying one from Arizmehdi: the bread is just perfect and the toppings aren't just relegated to merely sauce. You'll find items ranging from three kinds of mushrooms to caramelized onions to roasted garlic to homemade pesto on the ones served here.\n\nAn added bonus for me as well as other cyclists is the 10% discount for riding a bike. It may be harder to convince them without appropriate gear, but I always come in my kit so it's never an issue.", "author": "Frank Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-05", "description": "For full review with embedded pics see Blog\n\nThe interview day was half over at 11:15 and the tram to the VA was scheduled to leave at 12:05 - plenty of time to run the three blocks (this time in dress shoes) to Arizmendi Bakery - having missed The Cheeseboard on my trip to Berkeley and reading about the small worker-owned co-op with their amazing pizzas, morning pastries, and artisan breads I knew that the experience would be worth the walk.  Walking past the small craigslist.org building I had to chuckle at the neighborhood and at first I actually walked past Arizmendi despite its rather obvious sign.  Entering the doors I was instantly greeted by the smells of yeast, sugar, and garlic and wondered how I managed to walk past given the large crowd waiting inside.\n\nBrowsing the myriad selections I must admit that everything looked good, but knowing my foodie agenda for the day was to be pretty gluttonous I promised to reserve myself to one savory and one sweet.  Watching the numerous bakers toss pizza crusts in the back while others rolled out dough and brought out warm baked goods from the back to reload the quickly diminishing supply the first item that caught my eye was the fresh/piping hot Forcaccia with Roasted Garlic Sauce and Cheese.  Charged on a \"per pound\" basis, the single slice cost $4.40 and weighed in at a hefty 11oz - an 11oz that I greedily inhaled on my walk back to the bus.  Creamy Mozzarella, wonderfully ripe tomatoes, and whole cloves of whole roasted garlic - Amazing and filling...and thank goodness I had a pack of Orbit Sweet Mint with me since I had more interviews to go!\n\nFor my sweet, the brioche knots and Wolverines originally caught my eye but my love of cornbread quickly won out when I saw the words cornbread and scone in the same sentence...along with the word cherry.  Cherry Cornbread Scone - done deal!  Sweet yet hearty, soft yet with that characteristic cornbread texture, a bright balance of the lightness of a scone with the density of a cornbread - all enhanced with wonderfully tart black cherries.  Hands down the best \"designer\" cornbread I've ever tasted - and a better \"dessert cornbread\" than the pseudo-famous Cornbread dessert at Symon's Lola.\n\nFriendly (and clever) servers poked fun at my photo taking, but not in an obnoxious way - one even offered to take a picture of me with my pizza (I should have accepted) and prices were a bargain for the quality.  While I will admit that the cash only policy ended up costing me $30 the next day when I didn't have cash to pay the \"toll\" to Napa (What an asinine rule that is - who carries cash??) I certainly can't fault Arizmendi for that - I only wish I could've spent that $30 on some more of their baked goods!", "author": "Michael U."}

The employees are friendly and the goods, at the focaccia, are excellent. I went here for stop number 3 on my individual grub crawl through SF and was looking to pick up some focaccia to take home with me. I was a little disappointed when there were only two chunks left in their bin, but tossed them in my bag and got in line to check out. The employee at the counter told me some more was coming out of the oven in 10-15 minutes and told him as much as I would've liked to wait I was on a strict schedule and had to leave. I'm not sure where he grabbed them from but he reached behind the counter and threw in two more chunks of focaccia and let me know one of them was on the house. Acts like this will have me going out of my way to come back to this place. Once I got home I put the focaccia in a nonstick pan and toasted the bottom of it for about 5 minutes. It tasted almost fresh out of the oven. Areizmendi is 100% worthy of their yelp reputation and great reviews. I will be making a special trip back to try their other goods.", "author": "David L."}

Even my dad has been here before! The bf and I visited for the first time a few weeks ago to grab some goodies for breakfast before heading over to the Alemany Farmer's Market. I grabbed a raspberry and rhubarb scone and he grabbed a slice of coffee cake. The scone was moist and tart with the perfect amount of sweetness on top. The coffee cake was sweet and paired well with the coffee we grabbed at Drip'd across the street. \n     We returned again today to grab a quick bite for lunch. He got me a slice of the pizza of the day which was tomato, feta, garlic oil, parsley and onion and he grabbed a slice of the foccacia with roasted potato, onion and mushrooms. Both items were tasty and fresh out of the oven. The pizza had a nice bite to the crust. The foccacia had a slight sourdough taste to it which was nice.

As soon as you step in, you're greeted by mounds of delicious breads and sweets, and it's only natural to want to start grabbing one of everything. Just remember: They're testing you. You can take one -- mayyybe two -- of those fluffy focaccia breads or gigantic warm scones or freshly baked cookies, but don't forget about your primary objective: the PIZZA. They make only one kind each day, but rest assured, whatever it is, it's going to be deeeelicious! Everything here is good, but the pizza is truly memorable.\n\nFor those who are even moderately capsaicin-sensitive, stay away from anything with jalapeno here lest you want to douse your tongue in gasoline and set it on fire! The tomato/jalapeno focaccia definitely delivers more heat than I think most of us are ordinarily used to getting from a jalapeno these days. Spiciness aside, it lacks sufficient flavor to be thoroughly enjoyed on its own, but would be a nice accompaniment to a soup or salad.

For $5.25 per pound, the thick and bulky slice has slices of mushrooms, onions, bell-peppers and olives on top of a sourdough flatbread. The slices were very warm and ready to eat. One bite of that Foccacia slices makes me consider to eat pizza again.

The coffee is good too.    \n\nIt's always crowded here because everything they make is really good (though I tend to stick with my favorites because those are the things I like best).  The chocolate things are my favorite - a must try.  It's also nice that you can serve yourself vs. wait around and have someone get you what you want.  \n\nThey make cookies, coffee cake with fresh fruit, scones, granola and tea bread.  Check out the refrigerated case of artisanal cheeses.  \n\n The pizza toppings are simple , fresh and flavorful.  They don't overload their pizza with toppings.  My mouth is watering as I think of their pizza with \"roasted eggplant, ricotta cheese, garlic oil, fresh basil\" or \"shiitake, portobello and button mushrooms, sesame-ginger-garlic vinaigrette.\"  It doesn't take much to make a great pizza.  You can buy it by the slice ($2) or take home a whole pizza.\n\nCheck out the bread schedule and the updated pizza schedule on their website: http://www.arizmendibakery.org/bread\n\nPick up a chocolate thing and a drink and then stroll over to Golden Gate Park to enjoy them.  They do have some seating but it's limited and the long lines make the place feel very cramped.\n\nUPDATE:  They now have two kinds of basic cupcakes ($2.75).  I had the vanilla cake with vanilla frosting.  The cake was good and fresh but pretty dry.  The frosting is thick and on the harder side and sugary.  I wasn't too impressed but it's good to see cupcakes everywhere.", "author": "Lolia S."}

ALSO they have a very clean restroom in the back which is almost 5-star worthy. I only witheld one star because the grease that stains the paper bag regardless of what pastry you get gives me anxiety that the contents of my purse will get greasy too. \n\nOne pizza flavor each day and I'm pretty sure this is displayed on their website so you can come on days that appeal to you moreso than others. Frequenters of Cheeseboard in Berkeley will be familiar with this setup.\n\nThey have a plethora of savory and sweet baked goods that come in a variety of shapes and sizes. I never get the savory ones so I have little to say about them. I could go on forever about the sweets though! \n\nThe cornmeal scone is a must-try. It sounded a little strange to me at first, but is unique and satisfying. The only problem is that it is a lot more crumbly than normal flour scones so beware of where you decide to devour this little ball of buttery goodness. On any given day there are at least 3 scone selections to choose from.\n\nI recently had the corn blueberry muffin which was excellent! I'm often wary about blueberry muffins because they tend to be way too greasy or sweet but this one had achieved the perfect balance of flavors and textures. I especially enjoyed the cornmeal element. Alas it still left some nasty grease spots in my brown bag. Other muffins are good too and there are usually a few options for you. \n\nThe cookies are also delicious. They usually have the basic flavors although my favorite here has been the double chocolate chip mint or something like that. There is also a wide selection of shortbreads which is pretty unique. \n\nThere are also bigger loaves of bread for you to take home and also they sell coffee so you can enjoy a nice cup of joe while nomming on a pastry in their store because let's be realistic, how long can you wait before tearing into a fresh, aromatic pastry?", "author": "Lydia W."}

I was referred to this fabulous bakery by my father in law, who had recently been at UCSF Med Center.  Trouble was, he only could remember that it was near the hospital and near a veterinarian's office.  Thanks to Yelp and Mapquest, I found it and in finding Arizmendi, I found Bread Nirvana.\n\nMy husband often tells me that I exaggerate, but when I say that Arizmendi produces some of the best bread I have ever tasted I am understating the point.  WAY better than Gayle's in Capitola and Gayle's is the bomb.  \n\nToday she was serving her marbled pumpernickel and rye was what I sought for my dear spouse.  Samples were available and OMG I couldn't believe it.  Rye bread is often dry and too sour.  The marbled pumpernickel is moist, with a beautiful crust.  And the taste! SO GOOD.  As soon as I tried it, I ordered another loaf for the freezer.  But that was not all, oh no--not by a long shot.\n\nAlso amazing is the foccacia--today it was tomato and mushrooms and spinach/feta/onion/olive.  Slightly crunchy crust from the cornmeal, very moist and tender--I know what I'm having for lunch.\n\nAlso tried cheese rolls--divine-and purchased a straight-from-the-oven walnut wheat bread that smells sooooo good.  Just to round things off, I got a couple of breadsticks--pleasantly chewy, flavorful and well balanced.  Just to be fair to my sweet tooth, I got a coconut shortbread cookie (haven't tried it yet but I have no doubt it will be perfection) and a rosemary cheese scone.  Definitely the best scone ever had, crumbly but not dry, rich and flavorful. Perfect with a cup of steaming hot coffee, which I enjoyed on my drive back here to Silicon Valley.  Only complaint:  No South Bay Arizmendi.  Waaah!\n\nMy companion has another appointment at UCSF in a month and I gladly volunteered to drive, so that I can come back and restock!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-02-07", "description": "I really wanted to love this place.  I've been desperately searching for a good bakery in San Francisco without much success, most likely because my standards are very high:  I grew up in the Northeast, where good bread is sacred, inexpensive, and easily procurred.\n\nI've tried various breads and rolls from Arizmendi.  I gave it a good shot.  But I concluded that all of the people who rant and rave about how great this place is have never been to a bakery anywhere in NY.  They don't know why the brioche here makes me sigh as my taste buds' hopes are dashed, why to me, the rolls are almost-but-not-quite, the bialys are just so-so, and why I can't quite get into their chocolate cake, which while admittedly moist, has a weird and icky after-taste, telling me that either inferior quality products were used to make it, or bad proportions.  The prices are high and the quality is just okay, nothing special.  This place is no more special than, say, Noe Valley Bakery, which is also over-priced and lacking a certain something.\n\nAnd as a  former East-coaster, it's hard for me to get into a place that's so incredibly preachy and boastful about the quality of their products.  When you go to a bakery in Brooklyn, no one tries to unload any hippie crap on you.  You pick out your bread, you pay, you go.  But here, the guys behind the counter gushed to me about how I had to try their chocolate cake, how it'd been rated really highly online.  So, like an adventurous culinary fool, I did.\n\nThe chocolate cake is not great.  You can get a better slice at the bodega on the corner of 20th Ave. and Irving, and it'll be cheaper, too.  \n\nI know my chocolate cake.  It's probably my favorite food.  I could give a long list of places in San Francisco where you can get better chocolate cake.  Sadly, this just isn't one of them.\n\nDon't believe the hype on this place.  It's great if you live in the neighborhood, are offended by the notion of buying your bread from an actual grocery store, and have never been to a bakery in NYC.  But otherwise, your taste buds will probably need a support group afterwards to help deal with their disappointment.", "author": "Amy L."}

I will not have to eat for days, I'm sure (although we all KNOW that I will, anyway...).\n\nHere is what I got for $10.25 (you can see the pix I posted, too):\n\n* Chocolate mint cookie: dense, rich dark chocolate with a cool mint aftertaste.  So-so...\n* Hazelnut shortbread cookie: finely chopped hazelnuts in a buttery host.  So-so...\n* Chocolate brioche:  brioche not to scantily laden with rabbit pellet-like chocolate jewels.  So-so...\n* Raisin brioche knot: brioche laden with plump golden raisins knotted with a light sugar glaze.  Pretty good.\n* Cheese roll:  whole wheat dough roll topped with asiago (?) cheese.  Mighty tasty! Would be a fabulous base for a sammich...\n* Peach-raspberry scone: Golden crunchy outside encapsulating moist bits of peach and raspberry in buttery goodness.  Amazingly delicious.  I couldn't stop saying \"oh my god... this is so frickin' good\" the entire time I was eating it.\n\n\"Heaven... I'm in heaven, And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak. And I seem to find the happiness I seek...\"  at Arizmendi!!\n\n3 and a half stars.", "author": "Jenny K."}

There is a different pizza made every day and is available starting at 11:30 a.m.  They are vegetarian, but even carnivores won't have a problem with pizza this good.  Often times, you will get a slice that is still piping hot.  Other times, you'll have to wait a few minutes for the next one to finish baking.  They also serve half or whole partially baked ones to go.  Check out the monthly pizza schedule online or for the pizza of the day posted at the door.  My favorites are anything with mushrooms, artichoke, or eggplant.  I'm guessing that there are seasonal toppings, since some combos seem to disappear for months.    \r\n\r\nOther favorites of mine: Corn cherry scone, pecan rolls, and some of the muffins.

I balked when the register rang up $28 for the whole pie but the moment I took a bite, after nuking it for 1 minute, I realized I could've paid $40 for it and still be satisfied. Every bit of the crust, which we all know is the best part of the pie, was buttery. The key to knowing this was a delicious pie was that I was also eating the apple stuffing, which in most pies I pick to the side because I only like the crust. The place has found a way to make the apple stuffing taste like the crust. I admit to devouring almost 1/3 of it within a 24 hour period. Do not let a holiday go without getting a pie from Arizmendi.

Don't miss that either. \n\nTheir pizza is usually always a hit for me! Sometimes their choice in cheese is not my favorite (they always ALWAYS have goat cheese for some reason), but I love their style of pizza. I also really like the mini slice they always include in your order - its a nice touch! \n\nThis is probably my favorite bakery of all time just because of the scones.

Another plus, Arizmendi has much much shorter lines, but it'll take forever to find parking...weird huh?\n\nTheir bakery items are good too.

Sure enough, fifth time now, no fruit inside the Armizmendi scone! I've posted a photo, #231, of both scones side by side for comparison. Sorry, we're going to look elsewhere for our scones. It's the only thing I buy at Arizmendi, so I won't be going back. I love that they're a workers' collective, but I'm not going to pay for fruit-free scones anymore.", "author": "J. R."}

I don't know how I even missed this place because the line is out the door and the smell of fresh baked goods looms the exterior of the bakery.\n\nThe scene:\n\nDid I mention the place is packed? The bakery makes everything from coffee cake to focaccia to fresh baked bread to pizza. Customers pick out what they want from the bins and bring it to the register to pay. The pizzas are behind the counter and you can buy it as a whole, a half or even by the slice. Arizmendi also has a baking schedule that lists out what type of pizza and bread they will make daily.\n\nThe food:\n\nThere served 2 types of pizzas that day. A triple mushroom with sesame-ginger vinaigrette and a gorgonzola with housemade sauce. We got a slice of each and the total came to $4.50.\n\nTriple Mushroom w/Sesame-ginger Vinaigrette pizza - The crust is thin and crunchy, the toppings are hearty from the loads of mushrooms and the sauce has the perfect hint of Asian vinaigrette that gives the pizza some pizzazz.\n\nGorgonzola with housemade sauce pizza - I have no idea what the housemade sauce is, but it's good. This pizza was my favorite of the pair. The potent gorgenzola and the tangy white sauce will make any cheese lover give a thumbs up.\n\nI'd love to go back to try the coffee cake. That seemed like the popular item at the bakery.", "author": "Sam L."}

It is part of my weekend routine. I go at least once per weekend and pick up something for breakfast on my way to The Beanery for coffee, and then Golden Gate Park to sit and enjoy.\n\nAnyway, the bialys have been my baby for about a year now. I love them and think about them mid week. They are that good! Salty, oniony, poppy seedy. Yummy.\n\nI'd give five stars, but for a few reasons. I'm not a fan of their loaves of bread. It's just not that good. The crust is always this weird texture somewhere between crunchy and tough. I just don't like it. They're also really inconsistent. Sometimes the bialy's are delicious and look great, but other times they are totally inconsistently sized, oily, or over/under salted. Get a recipe--you're professionals. The product you sell shouldn't be different every time you make it. And third, their coffee sucks! Seriously, worst coffee ever.\n\nBut overall, they're my favorite bakery!

My boyfriend and I came on a whirlwind tour to pick out apartments, very quickly settling on our abode in the Inner Sunset.  My boss said, \"Oh, that's a great spot.  I have friends who choose their apartments based upon their proximity to Arizmendi.\"  I smiled and nodded and thought, \"Huh.  Good bakery, I guess.\"  That turned out to be the understatement of the century.\n\nThere's really nothing I don't love about Arizmendi.  I love the physical space: bright, happy, natural-looking, and typically squashed full of people.  I love the cute little benches and tables outside and the cute little birds nomming up every crumb.  I like the sign that sits just outside the door featuring the pizza of the day, that features a loving hand-painted rendition of said crumb-nomming birds.  I love the pots full of coffee, the fridge full of cheese, the racks full of freshly baked whatevers.\n\nI love the people.  I love the patrons, of course - the hippies, yuppies, families, people of all ages and races stuffing their faces with astoundingly similar expressions of glee every time I pass them on the street.  I love being sandwiched inside the bakery with all of these different people and feeling the quiet guilt and camaraderie of a shared addiction.  I love the people who work at Arizmendi, who have been nothing but kind and informative to me, and who seem to really like their jobs.\n\nAnd (you knew this was coming) I love the food.  I love that there are favorites produced daily that are reliably delicious, I love that there's a weekly rotation of some items to mix things up.  I love that there's a different pizza every day and I love that I get to go on their website to determine the most mouthwatering selections, and heartily declare those days pizza days.  I love that there are even specialer specials around the holiday.  Strawberry rhubarb pie for the 4th of July and hot cross buns on Easter.  I love wolverines.  Those little wads of sourdough stuffed with dried fruit are my go-to breakfast when I want something substantial to nosh.  They're like raisin bread on steroids, and they're delicious.  I love their focaccia: a little salty, a little oily, but with enough vegetable matter to make it worth my while.  I love their Asiago cheesyrollthings.  I don't even have to tell you why, do I?  And I love their pizza for its creative toppings slathered on generously atop a crust that's thin but still deliciously doughy and chewy.\n\nMostly, I love what Arizmendi represents.  It represents the power of neighborhood ties, the uniqueness of local businesses, and the idea that it's worth making everything with really good ingredients.  And maybe they don't need my five stars - you've probably read plenty of drooly reviews.  But they are ever worthy of said drool.

It was a white pizza with leafy greens, garlic, and tiny shots of goat cheese. I liked that in every bite you got a new ingredient and the goat cheese did not overpower at all.

My wife said the brand muffin was good but not great.  Maybe the pizza is good here cause everyone was eating it but as far as what I had, I was not impressed.", "author": "Henry S."}

We came at the end of the day and ordered our pizza and a few pastries (more like 6 of them). We had the mushroom, roasted zucchini, goat cheese and thyme oil pizza, which was awesome. I l liked our pastries, however, I've definitely had better. I'm also being critical of this place because Cheeseboard in Berkeley  (associated with Arizmendi) is the best I've ever had and I really loved the freshness of Cheeseboard so much more. The people were a little nicer and there is live music there too. Overall, Arizmendi is a solid place to go to for some good veggie pizza, but Cheeseboard is better.", "author": "Sheeva G."}

Walked in here for the first time after seeing it a million times and I kind of have bittersweet feelings about this place.  I effing love EVERYTHING I've ever bought from here, but my waist ain't havin' it.  :(  Cheese, butter, carbs.  Who could turn that down??? Siiiiigh.\n\nAnyway, rosemary parmesan scone, pecan roll, and cheese roll are the things I've had so far and let me tell you... they make my eyes roll to the back of my head and run a few laps before they go back to normal again.  I wanted to try a scone to see if they were dry so I picked up the first one I saw.  To my surprise, it was moist, salty and cheesy from the parmesan, slightly herby from the rosemary, and perfectly flakey with a slight light crispiness around the surface.  The pecan roll was not too sweet with the perfect amount of toasted pecans and a slight taste of maple.  Have you ever bought cheesebread to be disappointed because you can't really taste the cheese?????  WELL, the cheese roll thing will make you happy!  It's cheesy, crusty, chewy, and satisfying!  BEST PART-During baking, the cheese oozes out and finds its way down to the bottom of the roll and hardens so a cheesy crust forms. YUMMMM  \n\nArrite, I need to go there in the morning.

Plus, the staff is friendly and energetic.\n\nLocated in Inner Sunset, this bakery has a schedule in making certain bread and pizza.

Where did the +1 come from?\n\nHere are three theories with the first being most probable:\n\nA.  Since bread was common food for the masses in the medieval times, it was considered a crime if any baker cheated the consumers by selling them underweight.  Bread, at that time, was sold by weight rather than the actual count.  So if the baker threw in an extra loaf of bread, then the baker would be clear of any wrongdoing.  Urban legend claimed the punishment resulted in the chopping of an ear or a hand.\n\nB.  There were middlemen involved in helping the bakers sell the bread.  For every 12 pieces sold, the baker threw in one as a freebie.\n\nC.  The baker made an extra piece as tasting sample for the consumers.\n\nThese theories, however, are unpopular today because the number 13 is an odd and an unlucky number.  Besides, twelve pieces fit better in a box than thirteen.\n\nAs an exercise, you can use the freshly baked sourdough as a pair of mittens.  Just tear it in half and make your thumbs stick out.  Wash your hands first though if you plan to eat it later.\n\n\n\n      (((((((((((((((((((((((\n   ((\n((\n   ((\n      (((((((((((((((((((((((", "author": "CT L."}

I have to say Cheeseboard does have a little extra somethin' going on. The Berkeley location is split up, devoting a store to selling just the pizzas right next to its cheese and bake shop so I guess that makes it seem more special. Maybe it's just a mental thing... \n\nBut, I'm happy to say Arizmendi has its own charm and character. We always order a whole pizza, no matter what their pizza of the today is so we can enjoy eating delicious pizza all day long. We've never been disappointed even though the toppings aren't up to us. They pleasantly surprise me everytime I go in with toppings that are season and at the peak of flavor. This past Sunday it was tomatoes, arugula, gorgonzola cheese, garlic oil, and fresh basil. I never thought I could enjoy veggie pizza, until I tastes theirs. The bread and ingredients are always so fresh and flavorful, you don't even notice that there isn't meat. \n\nI want to try the savory baked goods but I always end up with more dessert-ish pastries: scones, cookies, and short breads. The snickerdoodle cookie always hits the spot after some cheesy almost good for you pizza but the coconut shortbread is my favorite! They have crispy coconut flakes throughout the buttery and rich short bread. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water! It's the best after dinner dessert while with some black tea. \n\nWhen I was up to pay, I completely forgot it was cash only. I had one bill, a Jackson but I was still short. I was really embarrassed and about to put the cookies back but the sympathetic cashier said \"it's okay, just bring back $1.50 next time.\" I know $1.50 is practically nothing but his sincere trust completely made my day. ;)", "author": "Julia T."}

It always smells so good and I always giggle because I heard on the radio that the top smells that men are attracted to are vanilla (AKA \"Eau de Stripper\"), butter popcorn (huh?) and baked goods (makes me wanna bake...ah yeah.)  So I wonder if it's true, does baked goods='Hey mama, how you doin'?\n\nSo each time I get the Brioche Knot....I love the Brioche Knot but I hate raisins. So I pick them out.  Each and everyone of those little wrinkly shits and when I do finally catch the Muni, I sit and eat my de-raisined Brioche Knot hoping that some fine specimen of a man will catch the aroma of baked goods wafting from my paper bag and say \"Hey mama, how YOU doin'?  Or something a little more classy.....that is a pretty cheesy ass line.", "author": "Jay H."}

The crisp sugar crunch of the top gives way to moist, tender innards-- not too sweet but exploding with flavor all the same. And what's that? A fresh, cool burst of blueberry? I've never had a scone like theirs before; they're so perfectly cooked that it causes other pastries to go green with envy. Try whatever their scone of the day is -- it's bound to be good, and is usually made with a fresh fruit that's in season. Their ever-present corn-cherry scones are also legendary for their crumbly buttery slightly crunchy delightfulness. Truly, Arizmendi has ruined me for all scones. I don't think it's possible to find a better one.\n\nThe chai that's served there is also some of the best around. \"Sun-brewed honey-sweetened chai from Santa Cruz\" is what it's billed as, and honestly I've never had better. It's worlds from the sugar syrup chai you get at Starbucks and even Peet's. Arizmendi's chai is slightly sweet, richly spicy, aromatic, complex, and strangely nostalgia-inducing, though you're not sure what for. It warms your belly and envelops you in comfort.\n\nNot in the mood for something sweet? Their cheese rolls are a ridiculous food item--half chewy sourdough and half melted asiago, they'll fill you up and give you a jaw workout in the process. Their pizza is also amazing; this worker-owned co-op was trained by the famous North Berkeley standby, The Cheese Board.", "author": "Heather H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-04-15", "description": "I'm sorry if this review doesn't make sense but I've been awake for 48 hours in marathon yet fruitless hacking session trying to crack Yelp and make a way to give Arizmendi 10 stars or maybe 9 thumbs up. Alas, I failed and so a mere 5 stars it is. In stupid per-star fashion:\n\n1) Delicious, nutritious food. Their food is fucking awesome and whole and delicious and good for you and delicious and a San Francisco classic and delicious. Quality foods made with love are no joke. The pizzas are creative and delicious. The breads are so so right. Cookies? Yum. And if that weren't enough, they carry some of the best local products around, like Cowgirl Creamery cheeses and Charles Chocolate.\n\n2) The owners. The whole enterprise is worker-owned, and it shows in their attention to quality and attitudes toward work. \"Owner wanted\" signs, not \"help wanted\": proving that it's a positive, effective business model every day. They listen to rad tunes in there and usually have some witty comeradery banter going on. They know and care for their regular customers. \n\nTo those in other reviews that have complained, I say try again, take an average. They're often really busy and trying to juggle counter service with baking, and in my extensive experience they are almost always friendly, kind, patient, and helpful. Honestly, I'm amazed none of them have ever jumped over the the counter to introduce the roller-pin to some of the people they get in there. You can bet your ass I'd have fallen down like that if I had to be in at 4 AM (4! AM!) to bake you your bread and then you bitched about me not taking credit cards or me not being psychic about what bread you put in that huge paper bag or because I'm not *thrilled* to tell you how to finish baking your pizza when the instructions are printed right there on the m-f'ing box.\n\n3) Coffee. Soy special... *pant pant pant*. They serve a Fair Trade coffee, and for my money they're the best in the neighborhood, with the possible exception of the Beanery at Irving & 7th. Beats Fourbucks, beats Beanery 9th, beats Canvas, beats Tart to Tart.\n\n4) Sustainable. Arizmendi works hard to make sure they create as little waste as possible. Most things are compostable, including their \"plasticware\". What little isn't goes in their waste bin, thought-provokingly labeled \"land fill\". They regularly win awards for how well they recycle & compost, so they clearly have something to teach us.\n\n5) Community oriented. They make regular donations to the food bank of their unsold goods. They also give sweet discounts: seniors, bicyclists, members of other co-ops. Was a time that MUNI FastPass counted, but think that's been lifted. Anyway, they're all owners, right, so that's money out of each of their pockets. That's commitment to the community. \n\nLike I said before, they care about their regular customers, which makes the neighborhood feel more like a community and less just the immediate area. A little bit of that goes a long way, and they do more than a little.\n\n7) Make loaves, not war.\n\n8) The two chicks in their underwear, who, at 1 AM one night, pulled up in a Mercedes sedan, frenziedly pitched a gang of bread out of Arizmendi's compost bins into its trunk, and then sped off like the heat was on.\n\n9) Arizmendi's pumpkin cheesecake = everything that pumpkin pie always wanted to be, but never, ever, ever was.\n\n10) Chaynge? Chaynge? Chaynge?\n\nGo there early and often.", "author": "Striddy B."}

I think Wednesday was biggest (just kidding, sorta).\n\nThe point is, either there's cocaine in the food and coffee, or it's just that good.  I am going through Arizmendi-withdrawl because they decided to close between Xmas and New Year's.  Thanks guys.  I'm dizzy and shaking.\n\nIn my opinion, the coffee is actually the best part.  It has a hint of chocolate to it, and I'm not usually one to go off about crap like that.  I also love the bran muffins, oat scones, banana walnut muffins, and blueberry cornbread muffins.\n\nSome people love the \"pizza.\"  I think it's not pizza.  To each their own.\n\nOn weekends you're likely to see a mentally handicapped man panhandling outside.  I'm pretty sure he's not homeless, and you have to to give the guy credit--of all places in the neighborhood to panhandle, Arizmendi has the most foot-traffic AND the people most likely to give money to a panhandler.

Chocolate things, however, were all sold out. I got a strawberry rhubarb scone and she made well with a brioche. The scones were out of this world. None of that generic processed taste, they use only organic ingredients. Very tasty. The brioche was fluffy and fresh. Each pastry costs about $2.50. The bakery also has an offering of focaccia breads and...CHALLAH! \n\nI have to say though, CASH ONLY IS NO BUENO!

I mean, I only recently stumbled upon Peasant Pies a few blocks away and that was also a sweet find.  \n\nI had 2 slices of the pizza of the day and yes, there's only one pizza option to choose from.  It was tomato sauce-less (as most, if not all of their slices are) , but it was fresh, hot, and fabulous.  Cheese, spinach, feta, olives, and some other good stuff.  I was also wowed by the freshness and flavor of the coffee cake and currant scone that I also picked up.  I'm definitely coming back soon to try some more of their pastries.  And did I mention it's a Co-Op?  I've decided that I officially love Co-ops.  How come there aren't more of them out there?

While it's a lofty measure, it's a standard stretched horribly awry. Inconsistency wrought an otherwise great bakery.\n\nA cursory glance around the reviews indicates the cheese rolls as the number one item to sample. Hell, even Arizemendi agrees, too: the cheese roll sits firmly next to the door above all other pastries, encased in a cabinet double the size of its brethrens. The cheese rolls, without a doubt, is their bread-and-butter item.\n\nSadly, the cheese roll is an astounding...\"eh\"!\n\nThe roll's praise is unjustified: underneath the cheesy pastry, a tough, hard dough waits for unsuspecting teeth, to shatter and crush them with no remorse. The tough-as-nails dough will either (a) scrape the roof of your mouth, or (b) give your mouth a hell of a workout -- taebo for the jaw. And wait, there's more...the roll isn't even that cheesy. \n\nAnother over-hyped aspect is their coffee. Brewed at god-knows-when, sitting for who-gives-a-crap, the coffee is totally lackluster in its flavor and aroma. Caffeine jolt? Forget about it! Pleasing taste? No way! Philz or blue bottle or even starbucks trumps Arizemendi by taste, by flavor, and, most importantly, by caffeine.\n\nWait, worse of all, they don't accept debit cards. The horror!\n\nBut not everything is overrated. The scones are butterly delicious. The onion roll peppered with sesame seeds is heavenly. And the pecan pastry is to die for.", "author": "Richard L."}

Finding what you want, and then finding the line to pay is truly frustrating. Granted, I usually go when it's the most crowded (weekend mornings), but the fact that the tables (it probably sits ten) in the middle of the floor take up valuable space that could be used for the takeout line drives me crazy. It's like they know they kick ass, and have no need to improve because the hordes will always come. \n\nThere's a homeless man in front all the time.

If you can walk in here, and walk out without a purchase, you are simply not hungry! You hate food! The scones are the best ev-er! I really feel sorry for idiots who think a Starbucks scone is really a scone and not a weapon. Every time I go here (4-6 times weekly) I eat a scone or two, and think I have died and gone to heaven each and every time. Look, over there! I see angels! Yeah, it is the food of gods and goddesses of all fake religions. Tip #1: They offer a 10% discount if you are on your bike, so speak up and identify yourself as such. Tip #2: The food is VERY fresh, and in all reality, made without preservatives (and really, too good to not be inhaled instantly like coke, the powder kind) so don't shame the food by holding onto it over night. Eat it now. I once bought a scone near closing time, and was able to tell it would have been a brick the next day. Much like a Starbucks scone. ONLY downside: CLOSED MONDAY. WTF????????\n\nEDIT/UPDATE:\nI always loved this place, and last summer, in the middle of a hot spell, I wandered in shirtless (about the hundredth time I'd done so). It's not like I EAT there, it's not like I am one of the naked Castro guys. I was biking home with no shirt on. I am in and out in mere minutes. The tall snarky grey haired nazi working asks \"Can we get a shirt dude?\" Being a frequent customer, and seeing only 2 people inside, who are (as it turned out) his friends he was chatting with, I did not see WHAT I was hurting. So I responded with \"Is it THAT important?\" and got some sarcasm. I think the attitude was unwarranted and while the food is good, I can bake for myself, thanks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-03-31", "description": "I was really excited to try Arizmendi's pizzas after a failed attempt to procure one at their sister co-op Cheeseboard's in Berkeley.  I had it all planned out - I scoured the menu and luckily the pizza I had been wanting to try for MONTHS was available this past Sunday.  I can't really make it out there on weekdays very easily so I was glad the pizza I wanted fell on a weekend.  I placed an advance order for a lite-baked whole pizza - shiitake mushrooms, caramelized onions, gruyere cheese, garlic oil, p&p.  P&P stands for parsley and parmesan.\n\nYesterday afternoon was sunny and lovely (but a bit windy) and I made by way over to the Sunset.  There is NO parking there on weekends so your best bet is to either take Muni (the N line stops right there) or you have to park in front of someone's driveway while you run in.  I deducted 1/2 star for being cash only.  I'm so used to using my credit card for everything that I had to make a special trip to the ATM just for this.\n\nArizmendi's does smell pretty darn good when you walk inside.  The bakery aroma always makes me hungry and I checked to see what other treats they had.  Nothing really caught my eye, but what they had on the shelves did look pretty yummy.  There are some seats inside if you can't wait to get home to dig into your treats.  Pizzas are $16 for a whole and $8 for a half.  Turns out I didn't really need to order ahead since they had a bunch of pre-boxed lite-baked pizzas already sitting there.  \n\nI was actually pleasantly surprised by the portion size.  It appeared to be around 16 inches in diameter and toppings were generous.  I hate it when pizza toppings are sparse, but this one looked to be chock full of mushrooms, cheese, and onions.  The instructions say to bake for 6-8 minutes at 400 degrees, but I found I had it put it in for a bit longer, about 10 minutes.  Now here is the reason for the other 1/2 star deduction - I didn't like the onions.  Normally I love caramelized onions and caramelized onions coupled with mushrooms and cheese should have been a surefire winner in my book.  But the onions did not taste caramelized to me.  And what sucked was that there were a ton of onions on the pizza, too!  So my experience was a bit anti-climatic.  The crust was nice; I think it was sourdough?  Overall, the pizza was good though, but not as great as I expected it to be.\n\nI really wanted to give Arizmendi's four stars, but I feel the 1/2 star deductions were warranted.  However, I do plan on giving them a second chance.  I'm already planning to visit them on April 13 for the  mushrooms, spinach, basil pesto pizza l so I will update my review then.\n\n4/13 update - the pizza was FANTASTIC.  The pesto/mushroom/spinach combo was great!  It was really cheesy and I liked this one a lot better.  I'm awarding another star.", "author": "Karen K."}

Part of the reason I love it so much is that it's fun to pull apart and consume\nThin sourdough crust pizza: they only serve one kind daily, vegetarian, and it's so delicious you don't mind that there's no meat!\nFoccacia: topped with all kinds of roasted goodness, soft and pliable on the inside with a nice cornmeal-studded crust on the bottom.  sold by weight, so it is definitely a great deal!\nCherry cornmeal scones: the cornmeal gives it a pleasant textural heft while the dried cherries' tartness plays against the sweetness of the scone\nCurrant scone: One of the most popular bakery items sold here.  A great combo of moist scone interior, with a golden, crunchy crust that is liberally sprinkled with cinnamon sugar\n\nThe only things I tried that I didn't love were the chocolate things (anything with chocolate chips invariably gets compared to chocolate chip cookies, and is disappointing by comparison) and the fresh seasonal scones.  The latter wasn't as tasty as the dried fruit scones because the fruit burst during baking and made parts of the scone soggy, and tasted sour compared to the sweet scone dough.", "author": "Janet L."}

A buddy of mine in the 'hood turned me on to Arizmendi's a couple of months back, and my waistline has been hating me (and him, especially him) ever since. For their chocolate chip cookies are the most deliciously sadistic, perverse sugar rush in this lovely little town we call home. Always super moist, loaded with chocolate chips, and hot-out-of-the-oven fresh due to the sheer volume this place moves on a daily basis. They're like the Escobar of SF bakeries (this is a good thing). These cookies are so good, they burn down Nestle's Tollhouse and kick the Keebler elves right in their collective ballbags. And you don't even want to know what they've done to Mrs. Fields' ample backside.\n\nWifey was a wee bit more famished than I, so she went for the legendary pizza, which didn't even manage to survive the car ride home to the Fillmore. She said the aroma was just too intoxicating and she couldn't wait to tear into that perfectly baked crust, on this fine day loaded with goat cheese, wild mushrooms, and a perfect tomato sauce.

Arizmendi Bakery showed up. A bit out of the way from our current route, but with the consistently-great reviews, we decided to give it a shot. \n\nThe majority of reviews were right. It has a quaint, small-town feel to it. \"Cozy\", but in all the right ways. It has a very friendly, local neighborhood feeling, which I am not used to but love. Fresh, aromatic breads ranging from garlic bread sticks, spinach and mushroom focaccia, tomato focaccia, caramelized onion rolls, and dozens of artisan cheeses greeted us upon entering. \n\nI couldn't help myself. I grabbed a paper bag, parchment paper, and grabbed everything my eyes had devoured when I first walked in so I could appease my taste buds. I also had a chai tea that was good, but a bit bland. Their specialty pizzas were fantastic. My girlfriend ordered a pesto garlic zucchini rosemary pizza... Sounds like a moothful but trust me: just after typing that description, my mouth just began to salivate. \n\nThe cashier/baker/worker was very friendly. You could tell he remembers and understands the \"regulars\", which are the backbone of any successful establishment.

My favorite is Yukon Gold Potatoes with roasted garlic and pesto. No, it's tripple mushroom with sesame-ginger-garlic vinaigrette.

I love the sourdough pizza crust they use. Their baked goods are good as well. However, their scones are not the moist and buttery type that I prefer. They're the dry and crumbly type. I thought the brioche would be more of e dense, buttery bread, but it's more of a slightly sweet eggy bread. It's great to have this place in the Sunset though.\n\nNote: Yes, sometimes the line is long.

We asked them to help us divide the whole pizza into four bags so we can share it with some of our friends who have never tried it before. When the male worker was cutting the pizza, both my friend and I witnessed that he gave two slices from our whole pizza away to another customer and cut the remainder of our pizza into eight slices to give to us. When we brought this issue up to the female cashier, she questioned the male worker if he gave two slices of our whole pizza away. The guy lied and stated he did not. The cashier stated if there's eight pieces in the bags then there's no missing slices. We checked all the slices before eating and found out that four of the slices were half a size of a regular slice. Since they are an employee owned business, I'm not sure if they are trying to cheat people to gain more profit. I have been a supporter of them for many years and now I have to think if they are worth supporting. So be careful of what you buy there.", "author": "Ben H."}

I stopped by lunch today and bought 2 slices of pizza for $5.  Mind you I know that normally their slices are small, but today the cashier gives me two meager slices of pizza that were the last of a pie. He passes it to me in their basket and I look at them and glance at him.  I smiled and asked \"aren't these slices unusually small?\" and he smiled back and said that that is supposed to be normal and the other slices they give are meant to spoil us.  I look at everyone else eating in and their single slice of pizza is almost as big as my two slices combined. I asked him if I could wait for slices from the next pizza but he just stared at me blankly.  I mistakenly took them as I should have gotten my $5 back to get a proper lunch. It took me less than 2 minutes to eat as I basically ate one slice of pizza cut in two. If they started weighing their pizza slices like they do for most of the other items then my two slices would have been $2.75 based on weight instead of $5 and everyone else's single slice would have been $2.50. It was obvious to both of the workers standing at the register that I was upset eating my pizza. They look at you as if you have nothing to complain about even if they are ripping you off. They should have offered me a smaller than normal slice of pizza to compensate for my slices being so tiny.

But it's not just good, it's f'n great!  I LOVE arizmendi cheese scones. If I meet a man that I enjoy this much, I will do anything for him.  Seriously.  I live 4.5 miles away. I walk 9 miles round trip just to have 5 minutes with the cheese scone. I have yet to meet a man for whom I would do anything close to that.  I have loved the cheese rolls in the past, but not so much recently. They seem to depend on the baker, and my last few visits they were too hard, actually hurt my jaw eating them. And too small. And not enough cheese! \nBut the Olive-provolone bread? oh YEAH! And the chocolate things? Yep. Yumma yumma. I love bread. I love sugar. I love bread and sugar. And cheese. They have it all.\nThe pizza does not appeal to me. I like traditional pizza, not fancy topping stuff without tomato sauce. But they occasionally have something called \"lunch lady\" pizza in the focaccia case that I like. It's mostly bread with some tomato sauce and cheese. My kinda pizza. Mmm mmm. \nAh Arizmendi, I love thee. \nI just tried the new one on Valencia last week (on a cheese scone day, of course. I looked it up to make sure). It's a nice space, but the counter person was not nice.  She was not pleasant at all. And while taking my money she started talking with her coworker and reading something. She was about to close register without giving me my change, and when I said something, she gave me the nastiest shit-eating look. WTF? \nWell, that's hipster Valencia for you.  The cheese scone was not as good there, either. It was...different. Maybe the baker fell of his/her fixie that day? I dunno.

I'd always pass this place walking around the neighborhood after going to the gym on 9th and Judah. Sigh, I am so dilly dallying because I CRAVE the pizza from this place! I went in on a Saturday morning, right about 11 ish, made sure I had cash and ordered my first slice. When the guy at the counter asked me in a serious manner, only one? I shrugged it off, waited for the pizza de jour and had it to go as I strolled around the corner for coffee. I think I inhaled that slice after the first bite, right before I got to the corner. If you've seen the movie Ratatouille, I was the food critic taking his first bite of the main dish, I was lost in flavor and nostalgic bliss. After I got my cup o joe, I came back with an almost sweaty fervor, like a junkie waiting for her next fix. I damn well could have ordered a whole pie, I settled for two more slices, I did just go to the gym and ran in the morning, no need to feel entirely guilty. The crust from this place, it's amazing, crunchy on the outside and soft and giving like a sourdough loaf on the inside. The flavor they were serving that day was a lemon infused olive oil with thin slices of red onion and black olives. It sounded so simple and boring, oh, far from it, I got lost in a train of thought, so the flavors change everyday so I'm giving this place 4 stars...until we meet again pizza-my-heart. Might I add, they sell the pizza dough by itself if you wanted to take it home and create your own little pizza heaven.", "author": "Natasha C."}

However, I can't forget the first time I went to this place; I had the pizza of the day- tomatoes, gorgonzola, and spinach. My friends did not find it as good but what do they know anyway. When I visit home I find myself down on Irving a lot, but whenever I walk by Arizmendi somehow I' find that I've already eaten but that doesn't stop me from enjoying the really great smell coming from the bakery and ovens.

I entered craving a chocolate chip cookie, but they only had gingerbread cookies with cardboard-like texture. So I settled for a slice of the day's pizza, which was spinach, tomatoes, goat cheese, and garlic oil. It hit the spot, right on, but the crust was too chewy for my liking, and there wasn't enough flavor, enough spice. Costco has ruined me for all other pizzas, except perhaps Kashi's.\n\nI might come back here a lunch of foccacia someday.

Everything in that bag tasted like lavender... blech! lol I really liked the salty foccacias with mozzarella, onions, tomato sauce and more. They were tastier.

The cake is so so so damn good here! I have to do the rubber-band-around-the-wrist trick (snapping myself everytime I think of the cake) just to keep myself away from this fat trap of a bakery. PartyBot loves their baguettes and they have a great little fridge with a decent assortment of cheeses (some bries, humboldt fog, etc) for last-minute snack runs when a trip to Andronico's seems undoable. Their pizzas are creative and tasty and seem healthy enough that I can eat a slice (or three) without feeling too much shame. Definitely try their Kookie bars (I think that's what they're called). They're (you guessed it!) bar cookies that are crunchy and compact enough that I can tell myself they're granola bars and enjoy them guilt-free. Every last chocolate-chippy, nutty bite.

The cheese rolls are perfect if you want something cheesy but don't feel like white flour, the tops of the cornbread blueberry muffins are perfectly crisp and dusted with slightly hardened sugar, and the vegan mint chocolate cookies are so satisfyingly chocolatey and packed with chips that it hurts a little bit to think about them. Anyone looking for meat on their pizza is out of luck but the triple mushroom with sesame ginger vinaigrette does the trick even for my bacon-loving self. Pair anything on the menu with their fairly priced and skillfully prepared cappuccino and your breakfast, lunch or snack is complete. Maybe if enough people start pestering them they'll start shipping nationwide, it's worth a shot.", "author": "Tory S."}

Millions of carbohydratic calories of anti-Atkins cheese rolls, fruit rolls, muffins, fruit cakes, pizzas, baguettes?  For spare change that you find in the netherworld of your purse or pocket?  Check.  I like Howard, who does graphic design and has been a \"worker-owner\" for a while there.  Their holiday items are awesome and thoughtfuly done also, but they lost the baked peace symbol, hung like a horseshoe from near the ceiling.  I miss that one, seemed like it would've made an excellent logo.  The only problem is when people show up with their Hummer sized strollers and decide to take up all the space available because, well, I guess they feel they're allowed.  One other nice vision I've had there: one of the workers very patiently helping one of the less than fully mentating homeless folks, who was just trying to get some coffee.  This is SF, truly, thoughtfully and deeply.

It was here at Ye Olde Neighborhood Organic Baked Goods Cooperative that I first outed myself as a lover of the oat scone and learned that I was in good company. In truth, oat scones don't sound particularly enticing, but these little puckshaped cakes are crispy on the outside, yet surprisingly moist inside. How you can do that with something made of about 75% oats baffles my mind. So the oat scones are my first choice at Arizmendi.\nSecond choice is the Scone Of the Day, huge and fluffy with crunchy sugar on the outside and yummy fruit like apples, berries or apricots on the inside.\nThird choice is the occasional cheese roll, chocolate thing, bran muffin, corn cherry scone, banana walnut muffin, pecan roll, brioche roll, or any type of cookie. Or whatever else. I'll eat it and like it.\nMaybe pick up a challah, pizza, container of olives, some jam or honey, a dip or two...so yeah, I'd do all my shopping here if I could afford it, and if I found carbo loading to actually be helpful for running and not just an excuse to eat stuff that tastes good. \nEven though The Beanery is down the street with loads of good coffee to be had, I like the coffee at Arizmendi too, and there's that dude who always thanks me for bringing in my humongazoid commuter mug and gives me  like ten cents off.

Cooperative businesses are brave and highly principled by virtue of the premise of a co-op model and that shows great passion and commitment to the endeavor.  In this case baked goods different, exciting, maybe unique to the donut shot concept of a bakery.  The first two items I tried when they first opened were the cherry/cornmeal scones, and the cheese rolls which I still got back for at least twice a month because they're so delicious and aren't produced by any other baker I know.  Over the years I've made special trips for a slice of their fabulous pizza, cookies, cakes, breads, fruit scones, breade sticks and other specialites that are as good as baked goods can be.  Everything they make uses generous amounts of the best ingredients money can buy, and they take the time to make these things the right way, with dedication and love.  This bakery is a true icon of the small business atmosphere of San Francisco, a destination for all who treasure integrity and passion in food.", "author": "Stu S."}

I can't visit the Inner Sunset without stopping here and usually end up buying two or three more things than I came in for, just because it looks/smells so good... or maybe because it's all right there, in my face and primarily self-serve.

Cheeseboard, I've heard is much better, but I really can't complain--everything I've tried has been great!

This and a jamba juice. perfect combination.. I had a slice of pizza.. I think it was goat cheese and basil or something to that effect..

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-07", "description": "Okay...so the bakery makes some really good butter, sugar, flour food to munch on during the day, and I enjoy it often.  There are times when the scones are not cooked enough and are pasty, so mind your selection.  The coffee cake is amazing.   The two minor complaints have to do with the service....First, this is for those of us who are morning people by choice or trade...the bakery opens at 7am on the weekdays and 8am on the weekends, and this is about 7am and about 8am as the employees open when they are ready which is never before those times.  You're a bakery...open early please!  And second, about the bicycle discount thing...thank you for offering it as more places should...BUT even if you stroll in in your finest team sponsored polyester garb with flashy helmet, you would never know that they offer a cool bicycle discount if you don't ask for it specifically.  I guess you have to be in the know to get it, but then why offer it?  Okay, so these things seem minor, but I thought it might help a few people.", "author": "rabbit s."}

Lately, what a disappointment.  Prices are up, quality and quantity are way down.  In recent weeks, scones have been small, gooey (read: inedible) and containing barely any of the fruit they claim to feature.  The predominant flavor has been that of flour, baking soda and baking powder.  Ugh.  Used to be well-balanced, with a nice scone shape (flatter, and therefore crispier, as opposed to the recent  fist-sized gummy globs), fruity, and with a thin layer of sweetness baked into the top that made the texture and flavor  heavenly.  And the weekend coffee cake has been cakey and boring.  Arizmendi, Arizmendi, wherefore art thou, Arizmendi????", "author": "Theresa S."}

It is all self-serve and we should've made our move sooner.  All of a sudden there were  7-12 people between us and the goods.  We finally got our crullers and coffee and sat down.  there are only 2 tables inside (one for 2 and one with benches that can probably seat 6-8) communally.  The staff is very helpful and friendly.  No tip jar although I would have.  All the stuff is very organickee and wholesome I'm sure.  There is a sign there that tells that the founder's name is a longer version of arizmendi...but i can't remember what it said...only that the coffee and crullers were really good.", "author": "delbert t."}

Maybe I've just hit off-days(sssssssssssssss) since I don't frequent the Sunset location as often as the Arizmendi in Oakland, where I live.  But, nonetheless I have willingly driven across the bridge, through high-traffic situations, 25 miles r/t  just for the amazing chocolate fudge cake they bake at the Sunset location!   But, for instance today I was entirely disappointed with the attitude of the service girl.   After driving for 45 mins to buy a cake and the sour faced girl never smiled, said hello, thank-you, how-are-you....NOTHING.  She actually just stood there all blank faced and dumb looking.    She made me feel bad for buying a chocolate cake.....which was $24, plus some other things which made my total over $30!  Sorry chicky, but I work in the restaurant business too and in times like these you should be showing your appreciation for business.  Just a tip from one service person to another.  It will make a difference!  People feel bad enough splurging on superfluous things right now, and your sour face and attitude only encourage them to not patronize your establishment.", "author": "Good J."}
