I often call in and bring over my own tupperware for the take-out order when I'm just in the mood to Netflix and Chill. San Francisco is known for not having many high quality and consistent sushi places but luckily Umi is one of those places that one could count on for their consistency in the quality of food. They don't have much of a hot dinner menu but what they do have is some killer Izakaya style entree like Katsu roll made of fried pork katsu stuffed with asparagus. Their rolls are pretty creative without being a \"eat everything in the kitchen sink\" like other places. What I still appreciate is that they still have the simpler rolls like Negihama, Spicy tuna, and umi shiso for those times when you actually want to taste the fish and not just a glob of mayo and all kinds of sauces.", "author": "Taffany H."}

But for potrero hill, it's definitely a nice find. \n\nThe vibe is rather intimate with limited seating and dim lighting. Service felt a bit slow as the waitresses took their time doing their tasks. The food was pricey for what you get but not as americanized as I expected (except for the fact that most of the sushi rolls came with avacado). The shrimp tempura rainbow had very decent shrimp tempura and was lightly seasoned, true to a more japanese palate. Sampler plate was small but served with miso and a bowl of rice. Miso was way too salty and I did not enjoy it, but the fish in the sampler was not bad--very tender.", "author": "Lydia Z."}

Service was professional though no one was around much besides to hand us the water/food/check. \n\nFor my meal I got the nigiri combo that included 1 piece each of tuna, hamachi, shiro maguro, salmon, butterfish, mackerel, sea bream, & suzuki. I also got an order of the Iwashi nigiri. The fish wasn't top notch freshness but was fine enough and had some flavor. The mackerel's pickling was very delicate which was nice because the texture was more tender. The slices were large and not too thick. The rice was lightly flavored so it had good flavor but wasn't too overpowering. The iwashi was pretty average. It was a bit tough but had a strong oily taste that was nice. The california roll was also tasty and a good filler. It's nice they used real crab meet and weren't too heavy-handed on the rice. Overall my meal was fine but way too expensive for the quality/quantity. (3.5/5)\n\nMy friend got the Potrero roll. It looked very average for $14 and according to her tasted very average and is definitely not worth the price.\n\nOverall Umi is not a bad sushi place.

Several of our more expensive rolls and nigiri were average tasting:  the Fire Roll with Crab, despite a respectable burst of heat upfront and beautiful color on the plate, tasted surprisingly bland. Our tuna maki fell apart. The nigiri cuts were average sized. The miso was somehow missing that nutty, salty umami flavor.

The interior is beautiful, clean with gorgeous lighting coming in from huge windows, and the neighborhood is relatively peaceful with pretty easy parking within a block of the restaurant (I was able to park literally right in front of the place).\n\nThe plates are generous/well warranted for the price, about 6-8 pieces of sushi per plate, and everything is pretty filling. We tried a little bit of everything from their maki selection, which has so many delicious looking options, as well as sunomono and seaweed salad for appetizers. I'm sorry to say I don't remember exactly what we ordered from the maki menu, but I do remember the Giants roll and salmon skill roll being so delicious I couldn't help but close my eyes and slump in my seat for a bit just enjoying it. The food came out in good time, and the waitress would regularly check in to see if we needed a refill on water/tea.\n\nWe ordered sake halfway through the meal from their main menu, not their drinks menu, because they had taken the drinks menu after we ordered our food and we hadn't thought we would need it again. The sake tasted like typical cheap-ish sake you can find at every Japanese restaurant, so I'd highly recommend choosing a sake from their fancier sake list. \n\nTiny downsides: By 7:30pm when we left, the place was pretty crowded. We had been seated at the end of a long table, and a group of people had later been seated on the other end. The table behind us was so close that we couldn't comfortably get out of the row, and had to interrupt people's conversations and rub our butts across their backs to get out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-26", "description": "This is a great neighborhood sushi spot.  Having been to Japan, I know how good sushi can really be, and I increasingly appreciate traditional sushi.  Although this isn't the best sushi I've ever had, it is made in a traditional style and that's becoming hard to find, even in SF.  So many places seem to rely on sauces, odd ingredients, and techniques that mask the quality of the fish and rice - Umi does not.\n\nFirst of all the restaurant itself is a great size.  You enter next to the kitchen, where you can watch the sushi chef who apparently makes all of the sushi for the restaurant, do his thing.  When you enter, to the right is indoor seating, and to the left is the outdoor patio.  It was a nice night so we sat on the patio, which is covered from the elements and has heaters throughout the space.  Overall the restaurant is small, yet clean and very modern (especially the patio).  \n\nFor dinner I ordered the Nigiri Deluxe, which for $23.00 seemed like a bit of a bargain.  You get eight pieces of nigiri sushi, six pieces of California roll (with real crab and very little mayo), and miso soup.  The food overall was outstanding though I thought the rice with the nigiri sushi was packed a little too tightly and lacked flavor (I'm used to rice with a bit more sugar and rice vinegar flavor - even in Japan).  The fish was all outstanding and tasted fresh.\n\nOverall I would rate this restaurant 5 stars, but the rice (which is really what sushi is all about) was not ideal for me, so I rate it 4.5 stars.  Each person has their own tastes, so I encourage anyone in the area with a craving for sushi to try this restaurant post haste.  It's a solid spot, and I can't wait to return here soon.", "author": "Tom G."}

If I lived in the area and wanted something close by, I could see myself returning. Ate here for dinner on a Sunday night - the place is pretty empty until a little after 7pm.\n\nDeluxe nigiri combo - 8 piece nigiri + 6 piece california roll for $24. This was actually great value! Sizeable cuts of fish that were pretty good quality, but definitely way too much rice. I ended up taking a chunk of rice off every piece.\n\nHamachi kama - just ok overall; the meat could've been a bit chewier / had tougher consistency, and I wish the skin was crispier so it would contrast better with the meat\n\nGari saba cut roll - i like mackerel, ginger, and seaweed, put them together and it's all good, except there was way too much rice in this\n\nPotrero roll - pretty standard, pretty good\n\nThe restaurant was oddly very warm...not the way you want to feel in a sushi restaurant where they handle lots of raw items...but maybe it's just because it was an unusually hot weekend in SF.", "author": "Gore S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-13", "description": "High quality sushi at a reasonable price, I'll surely come back again.\n\nThere are a few telltale signs I look for to determine the quality of a sushi restaurant before having tried their raw fish.\n1. Do they list the origin of their fish?  Good restaurants will print the country of origin for each cut of fish, many of which will have come flown from Japan.  No origin listing typically means they take cheap cuts from the local market and sell them as sashimi.\n2. Do they have \"more exotic\" varieties of fish?  Anago, different types of hamachi/yellowtail, pickled mackerel, uni, etc.\n3. Do they have an omakase menu?\n\nUmi had #1 and #2 checked off.  They didn't have an omakase per se, but they did have a \"nigiri sampler\" which was 8 different pieces of ngiri.  Their prices are also a notch down(About $4 per piece of ngiri) from my usual favorite high quality sushi restaurant in SF, Saru Sushi(About $5 per piece of ngiri).  So I figured it was worth a shot.\n\nI came away relatively satisfied!  I came with a group of 9 for a birthday dinner at 6PM on a Saturday night, having emailed in a reservation in advanced.  They handled my large reservation quite well and didn't mind at all that half my group arrived about 25 minutes late.  Service was great, friendly, and very courteous, nothing to complain about there.\n\nI ordered a $32 nigiri sampler (8 pieces of: yellowtail, hotate scallop, ocean trout, salmon from japan, 2 types of pickled mackerel, and some others I can't remember, a $7 order of 2 pieces of anago, and $12 uni from California.  All pieces of the ngiri sampler were very high quality cuts and just melted in your mouth.  Uni was also good, but not the best.  \n\nThe reason this isn't a 5 star is because of the anago(saltwater sea eel, rare in US sushi restaurants).  Unagi(freshwater farmed eel, common in US sushi restaurants) and Anago are my favorite foods period.  Umi doesn't have any unagi on their menu, and they claim on their website they cut and fillet all their fish, even their eel, so I had pretty high expectations for their anago coming in.  All the anago I've ever had was prepared by blowtorching the surface of the anago fillet, placing it onto the rice, and then brushing on some light barbeque sauce.  And the best unagi is served perfectly warmed.  The anago I received was cold and had no scorching.  Quite a let down :(\n\nSuffice it to say, I will be coming back here and bringing others here in the future.  Just won't order the anago, or perhaps I'll ask them if they can prepare it the scorched way, and make this a 5 star.  Saru Sushi beats Umi still (presentation, ambiance anago, and more exquisite selection), but Saru is about 25% more expensive, which makes a pretty big difference when your bill approaches $100.  My portion of the check was $88 including a bottle of Sake, and I was very satisfied.  I've always had bills of $100+ at Saru.", "author": "Matt T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-07-14", "description": "One of the best sushi places I've had in the city, hands down. What a hiddem gem this place is! My ex-boss told me about Umi awhile ago, but I was a little lazy about going because it's in Potrero Hill, which can be inconvenient sometimes. But then my other friend suggested this for a group dinner place and I decided to go - it has such great reviews, and I wanted a true SF foodie night anyway, so I thought I'd give it a shot. \n\nOne piece of advice: bring your own red wine if possible! Their selection isn't too vast, and their corkage fee is only $12, so we took our own and were happy we did so. It's super worth it! (We also ordered a couple large beers and sakes too.)\n\nFor appetizers, we got: seaweed salad, edamame, grilled eggplant, and the butterfish. The grilled eggplant was to die for - it comes out hot and fresh so you need to wait a few minutes before you actually eat it or you may burn your mouth! But it's super flavorful and comes with this amazing sauce. Definitely don't miss out on it, it's great especially for veggie people and comes with 8 pieces which is pretty generous. We got 2 orders of the butterfish and still didn't think that was enough because we loved it so much. The butterfish is hot and you can share one among 2-3ish people using chopstics, and the fish is very tender and soft and practically melts in your mouth. Seaweed salad and edamame were good, but standard and I felt like those portions were a bit tiny, but still decent food.\n\nWe got the sashimi deluxe (I think it came with 18 pieces) and that was perfect for the 5 of us. I'm pretty sure the restaurant just picks the fish you get, but we liked all of them (mostly white fish) and the pieces were big too! Super fresh and yummy - I recommend the deluxe because you'll get a good variety and it's perfect for 4-5 people. You may need/less more depending on how many people eat sashimi in your group.\n\nFor rolls, we got the potrero, rainbow, spider, dragon, and golden dragon. For more basic rolls, we got the mushroom, california, and spicy tuna. Everything was excellent and we literally ate every last roll on the table. The rolls are really fresh and the restaurant is accommodating too-- they can put the tobiko on the side for you if you want. We had someone in the group who doesn't like tobiko, so this was no problem to cater around. The rolls aren't doused with sauce so they don't feel overly heavy. At first, we had only ordered 5 rolls and got 3 additional ones because we were still hungry. The rolls are good sized - everything is about 6-8 pieces depending on the roll, and they can make things spicier if you'd like! They added a spicy sauce to the basic spicy tuna roll and that was yum yum yum.\n\nAs you can see, we got appetizers, drinks, sashimi, and rolls, so it was a TON of food. Split 5 ways, everyone walked away paying ~$52. It was well worth it, in my mind. I don't mind dishing out for sushi, and I felt like I got to try a good variety of things off the menu too.", "author": "Priya G."}

I live in the Mission and I seem to have neglected that side of San Francisco which happens to be right next door. Shame on me. \n\nSo my girlfriend and I had a hankering for sushi the other day and decided to refer to good old Yelp for recommendations around the area. Much to our surprise, a bunch of joints popped up in or around Potrero Hill. \"OK, so Potrero Hill it is,\" I told her.\n\nThe one that got the best reviews was Live Sushi so we went with that. Tried making reservations and was cock-blocked by the hundreds of others who had the same idea but unlike us, thought ahead. Nothing was available. So we went with the one with the next best reviews: \n\nUmi. \n\nThey didn't have OpenTable so I called. Already semi-expecting to be disappointed, I asked the guy if there was any chance we could be seated at 7pm. He said they didn't take reservations over the phone so naturally I asked how long the wait would be if we arrived in 30 minutes. He's like \"Dude, just come in. I seriously doubt there will be any wait.\" This relieved and worried me at the same time. \n\nWe get there and like the guy said, there was no wait. There was an open table in the patio area too so we took it. The evening was off to a good start.\n\nWe ordered the fresh fish (sashimi) sampler of flying fish and butterfish from Japan, and the arctic char from Alaska. The fresh fish are supposedly flown in the same day. We also got the Potrero Roll because, why not? Like they say: when in Potrero Hill, order anything that has Potrero in it, right? It had spicy tuna, avocado, salmon, tobiko and spicy aioli. Another item particularly caught my eye: Black cod. Otherwise known as Gindara. This was a treat because very rarely do sushi joints carry this melt-in-your-mouth delicacy. \n\nAll in all, everything was pretty fresh although I probably won't order the Potrero Roll again. It was a bit too simple for my taste. We loved the fresh fish, particularly the flying fish and arctic char. We also loved the beer selection. This is one of the few Japanese restaurants I know that doesn't only serve Sapporo and Asahi. In fact, they had neither.  All of their beers were rare imports which was quite interesting. We went with the Koshihikari Echigo because our Japanese server recommended it. It was very delicious.

We were craving sushi and wanting to try somewhere new, we happened upon Umi on Yelp. We found it a little strange coming out to Portrero Hill (which can be a pain to get to for us) for good sushi, but let's just say that we definitely were not disappointed.\n\nWe ended up ordering the grilled butterfish, a side of seaweed salad, a Golden Dragon roll, the sashimi deluxe plate (18 pieces of sashimi), and a bottle of the Coedo (a Japanese brewery) Beniaka beer to split. The grilled butterfish was so good. It was moist and tender, and the beer was the perfect complement to the fish. When we go out for sushi we love to get sake (salmon sashimi), which is why we opted for the Golden Dragon roll. The lemon slice on top offers a nice bit of acid to balance the sweet butteriness of the salmon. The sashimi served were incredibly fresh. We could really taste the differences and subtleties of each fish.\n\nThe place isn't terribly small, it's not very big either (though there are two main dining areas). Service was good. We'll definitely back if we're ever in the area!", "author": "Vivian L."}

There was two slices of salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and three other white fishes. Also one shrimp. I was kinda surprise there was no ikura or tamago since most chirashi I get have them. The salmon and yellowtail was probably the freshest and the rest was okay. I was disappointed the waitress didn't explain what fishes came with my chirashi.\n\nOur waitress wasn't the friendliest.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-07-07", "description": "Umi is a small hole-in-the-wall spot in Potrero Hill, and the outdoor seating area is one of the most relaxing atmospheres I've been in at a Japanese restaurant. The fish is one of the best qualities that I've had in San Francisco, so come for the quality not the quantity.\n\nThe sashimi deluxe is a great way to get a broad sampling of the different fish they have to offer. It comes with three slices of five different kinds of fish, so you get a good chance to develop your favorites. The fire dragon roll is also delicious, with a generous helping of spicy tuna on top and a California roll made with fresh crab on the bottom. Anywhere that uses fresh crab instead of imitation crab in the California rolls should be commended. My favorite by far was the white toro nigiri, which was one of the most buttery and soft fishes I've had. The sushi rice was also right on point, resulting in the perfect bite. \n\nWith quality food and an amazing setting, I'm glad to be able to add Umi to my list of my go-to Japanese places in SF.", "author": "Ashley T."}

But mediocre rolls, coupled with sub-par staff and slow service just won't cut it for me.\n\n- Miso Soup: Standard miso soup. There was a good amount of kelp and seaweed inside, which I loved, though!\n- Edamame: Your typical edamame appetizer. The portion size is one of the larger offerings I've seen around SF, so that's a plus.\n- Broccoli Rabe: A surprising sweetness came with its savory seasoning. Maybe I'm just a broccoli fan (so I'm biased), but this came as a surprise. Its softness (note--not limpness) meshes will with any other portion of the meal.\n- Ume Shiso Roll: While my co-workers complained that this tasted more like perfume, I didn't mind the simplicity too much. The rice was almost overwhelming, though, so I didn't get to taste too much of leaves and if I tried hard enough could discern the plum. \n- Dragon Roll: The roll was a little sloppy, and some of the sauce was layered on a bit too thick (read: unevenly).\n- Shrimp Tempura Roll: A passable amount of shrimp tempura, but could've done without the extra sauce.\n\nI think there's a lot to be said when the most memorable item was an appetizer, the broccoli rabe.

I skimmed the reviews and I am usually really picky with my sushi, mainly because I've had better sushi for the better price of expensive so-so ones. So I am not expecting much...\n\nI am the first one here, arrived a little before opening. Looks like a nice place. I sat at the patio by the street.\n\nI ordered the regular nigiri from the dinner menu. Which is a 6-piece nigiri of the chef's choice and 6-piece tuna temaki, which also came with miso (little too salty to my taste).\n\nThe waitress checked on me from time to time, and refilled water on her own. \n\nTo be honest, I don't order nigiri often, if at all, but I wanted to try it after watching that documentary.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-22", "description": "If it weren't for Yelp, many hidden gems in SF would probably remain undiscovered. \n\nUmi is not exactly a gem, nor is it a destination spot but it's a nice neighborhood spot to go to if you're in the area and if you're craving sashimi, sushi and tapa-style dishes. \n\nAlthough I love dining out and trying new things, my credits cards have been giving me the middle finger. So, I try to conserve as much as I can; keyword being \"try\". *sigh* Anyhow, I found Umi on Yelp several weeks ago and read that they have fresh sashimi at affordable prices so I was game. \n\nOn Saturday, October 16th, my friend and I came to Umi a little before 6:30 PM. We didn't make reservations but was seated right away. The restaurant was pretty slow for a Saturday night especially during peak dinner hours. When we arrived there was one couple finishing their dinner and just one other gentleman dining. \n\n\nFOOD:\n*Seaweed Salad ($4): OK. The seaweed was crunchy and the dressing was salty and sweet with a slight citrus tang. The toasted sesame seeds added a crunch and nutty flavor. \n\n*Butterfish Sashimi (5 pieces - $10): MEH! The butterfish tasted fishy and didn't have that silky melt-in-your-mouth texture that fresh high-quality sashimi normally has. I ordered fresh wasabi for an extra .75. The wasabi numbed my mouth a bit for a split second just enough to mask the fishiness of the butterfish.  Perhaps I ordered the wrong fish, but I'm not sure what \"fresh fish\" other Yelpers were talking about. \n\n*Agedashi Tofu ($5): GOOD! The tofu was fried to a light golden brown and was sitting in a pool of sweet and savory dashi broth. As you sink your teeth into it, you get a light crisp followed by a gelatinous pull from the potato starch and then the silken tofu just melts in your mouth. \n\n*Yaki Nasu ($6): GOOD! The eggplant was so velvety smooth that it actually melted in my mouth. The miso sauce which was salty, sweet, savory, and nutty was drizzled (as opposed to being slathered like some palces) on the eggplant so it didn't overpower the delicate eggplant flavor. \n\n*Beef Enoki Mushroom and Asparagus Maki ($11): GOOD! Thin slices of beef were wrapped around enoki and asparagus spears, grilled, and then brushed with a teriyaki sauce. The beef was soft and tender which was a nice contrast to the enoki and asparagus which had an al-dente crunch. I wasn't fond of the teriyaki sauce b/c it was a bit salty for my taste and masked all the beef flavor.\n\n*Katsu Asparagus ($12): OK. A take on the well-known pork katsu; asparagus spears were wrapped around slices of pork, breaded with panko, and fried to a sun kissed golden brown. The katsu arrived fresh out of the fryer and was warm and very crisp. However, the pork was very dry and bland; so much so I actually mistaken it for turkey. \n\n*Poached Pear ($4): GOOD. The bartlett pear was soft, tender and slightly sweet. It was drizzled with a pear compote, giving it an additional layer of sweetness. Too bad, there wasn't vanilla ice cream b/c that would have been a nice complement to the pear. \n\nSERVICE: \nOur waitress was friendly, attentive and made sure our tea cups were never empty. Considering only one other gentleman was eating, the timing of the plates were very slow. After getting the seaweed salad and sashimi, it took over 20-25 minutes to get our other dishes. We saw 3-4 chefs, so I'm not sure why it took a while to get our food. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: \nSimple and contemporary designed. As you enter, you walk through the sushi bar (no seating) to go to the main dining room where there's seating for less than 20-25. There's also a back patio which I can imagine is a nice place to have lunch/dinner especially on a nice hot summer day.\n\nTeetering between 3-4 stars...\n\nGiven there are so many Japanese Restaurants in SF, Umi is average at best. Although I enjoyed the tapas, the \"fishy\" sashimi was a big no-no to me, so unfortuantely I have to round my rating down to 3 Stars.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

One of us arrived first, and asked for a table for 3. She was told that she could not be seated until everyone was there (even though the restaurant was basically empty). In fact she could not even stand and wait for a table because it's \"against fire code\". Again, the restaurant is essentially empty except for the workers. She asked if they wanted her to stand outside in the cold and they said yes, if you don't mind.\n\nI got there a few minutes later and again asked for a table. Again, they would not seat us until everyone got there. One guy explained that for \"larger parties\" they need everyone to be there. I repeated that we were going to be THREE people. At this point, the restaurant is still basically empty and my third friend was a few minutes away.\n\nI can understand why restaurants have this type of policy. But on a cold Tuesday night when your restaurant is essentially empty??! Irritated me enough to bother writing a yelp review.\n\nIn the end, it was all good.

Literally the fat belly tuna, the hamachi...it will melt in your mouth,  so savor it!\n\nThe sushi rolls are also amazing as they are simple but good, not a lot of frills, which good sushi doesn't need.

The price was fine: we walked out after a bunch of roles and nigiri less than $70 for two, after tip, with no alcohol.  \n\nHowever, the fish and rolls were mediocre at best.  The roles were really poorly apportioned, with all rolls having way too much rice and far too little fish.  The rice itself was just not good quality sushi rice, which limits the taste of the fish.

The set up is a little strange; you walk in through the kitchen area (good to know that you can see your food being prepared) and the host will come and seat you inside or outside. The fish is fresh and of high quality, but the menu falls victim to the Westernization of Japanese cuisine. I really believe that I would enjoy Umi more if the rolls were not the Rainbow/California Roll or crab meat-filled stereotypes that dominate subpar Japanese restaurants.\n\nLast time, I got the Potrero roll ($13), which had a nice spicy kick. Nothing too special, but satisfied my raw fish cravings.\n\nThis time, I got the Chirashi ($23). There were 5-7 varieties of sashimi (average of 2 slices each). The texture of the scallop sashimi was the most impressive for me. Even though the ingredients are very carefully chosen, I don't think this was worth the $23. I've gotten a lot more variety and volumn of fish for the same price, without sacrificing quality.\n\nWe shared the Yaki Nasu ($8), which is 8 slices of grilled eggplant topped with miso paste. I'm not a big fan of eggplants, but I did really enjoy this. Who knew eggplant and miso went so well together?\n\nAt 8:30PM on a Sunday, this place was still pretty full. I went with three friends, some of which are regulars to Umi. The host was very friendly and attentive. In the quiet neighborhood of Potrero Hill, Umi is a bit overpriced, but pleasant with no surprises.", "author": "Jessica F."}

The place is kinda nice for a teeny neighborhood joint.  The agedashi tofu's batter was nice & light...probably the tastiest thing we sampled.  We all got our own bentos for $9.  I got the tonkatsu & California roll (they gave me 6 though which was nice).  I know we've all become accustomed to the fatty portions of the American way, but Umi's portions are tiny!  The salad was mixed greens instead of the typical lettuce & the dressing tasted like some kind of vinaigrette & not Japanesey.  The miso wasn't salty which I appreciated but tasted kinda watery.  The roll was okay, noting to write home about though.  And the tonkatsu was pretty much lackluster. For about the same price I could get at least twice of the food at other places I frequent.\n\nProps to them though for using all natural ingredients.

Even a single day makes a big difference in flavor. Umi got all the balance of the nigiri right too - just the right amount of fish/rice/wasabi.

I will  likely be back next time in the bay.\n\nUPDATE: so the owner took me up on my challenge.  Though i no longer eat seafood, I was rather impressed with his candid explanation of their selection of items.  As far as sushi places go, kudos to Umi for trying their best to get things as sustainable as possible.

We had a few take out lunches at my office, and then visited for dinner with friends a couple of weeks ago. Prices are not cheap but in line with my expectations for quality sushi in the Bay Area. All in all, an outstanding experience.\n\nUmi specializes in extremely fresh, sustainable fish, and the quality is apparent in your first bites.  Freshly ground wasabi as an option always makes me smile- not a fan of the green clay version.  They have outstanding nigiri (my personal preference) as well as a few rolls and some creative and taste non-sushi items.  We had a tonkatsu wrapped asparagus and a great poke dish. Additionally, the fish selection goes well beyond the few 'standards' you see at all sushi places.  When we visited, they had interesting selections such as golden snapper (kinmedai) which is relatively uncommon in the US.  My only disappointment, which is splitting hairs, is they had no toro when we visited...\n\nAll in all, I strongly recommend Umi, and feel that it compares favorably or better than nearly every sushi place in San Francisco, and I have visited many of them!

Thanks to the 4-star review on Yelp, I decided to try Umi.\n\nBecause it was New Year's Eve, my date and I decided to eat an early dinner before the festivities began.  So we easily made reservations through their website, and appeared for our 5:30pm spot.  They had just opened the doors and turned on the heat when we were seated, so it was a bit chilly for the first few minutes, but warmed up quickly as others started to arrive.  The indoor dining room is beyond the kitchen, so as we were led to our seats, we could see the sushi chefs hard at work.  There is also an outdoor seating area, but I would save that for a rare warm San Francisco day!\n\nNow before I go on, I must admit that I am actually not a sushi connoisseur.  I do enjoy rolls, but I usually avoid raw fish (I know! Sacrilege to most sushi fanatics!) and stick with the more popular-but-boring, Americanized ones.  Still, I enjoy sushi places with good atmosphere and well-presented dishes.  Umi has a long menu of many types of rolls, including vegetarian options and sashimi for the purists. \n\nWe started with miso soup, seaweed salad, and their special grilled butterfish appetizer.  The miso was pretty standard, but the warm soup was perfect for the cold evening.  The seaweed salad was light, crunchy, and had no shortage of sesame seeds-my favorite part.  But the best part was the grilled butterfish, served over a cucumber-peanut relish.  The fish really lived up to its name, with a delicious smooth, buttery texture.\n\nOur rolls appeared next.  We had the Caterpillar roll, which is one of my favorites. The unagi and cucumber was wrapped inside, topped with plenty of avocado and tobiko.  I also ordered a California hand roll (I just can't go to a sushi place without ordering some variation on the California roll!), and my date had the spicy tuna hand roll.  The rolls all tasted delicious.\n\nService was good; our tea was constantly refilled and our plates cleared promptly.  Our server was very nice, and seemed to present each plate to us with pride for the chef's work.  The atmosphere was quiet, though the place filled up as the evening went on.  The low lighting, dark wooden tables and Japanese art on the walls gave the place a relaxing vibe.\n\nI will definitely return for the butterfish, and next time I'll try another one of their specialty rolls.  Umi is a gem in the area, and I would highly recommend it.  Thanks Yelpers!", "author": "Caroline K."}

So this 5-star review is purely for that wondrous plate of 2 generous slices of grilled hamachi on a bed of greens, with a touch of ponzu sauce -- all for a ridiculous price of $13!  The minimalist setting in charming Potrero Hill and the attentive staff are a bonus. Oh, and hubby did try the grilled butterfish on one occasion (which was also good), then a bento box with sashimi and tempura on another (also good), but he was reaching out to my scrumptious plate of hamachi half the time.

We tried some special sashimi, futo maki rolls, and cold sake. The food was quite tasty and FRESH. A bit steep on the price though, which is no surprise. However I think $7 for a little bit of fresh wasabi is over-rated.\n\nUnder the special sashimi we ordered ainame, houbou, and sayori... All of which came from Japan..  and all of which I had hard time remembering its name.  But I have to say say my favorite would have to be the houbou which is a blue fin robin. It was pink, plump and tasted rich!\n\nAlong with that the Tiger roll was excellent. It had cucumber, avocado, unagi with shrimp and black tobiko on top. The texture and portion was just right. As for the Potrero roll was dece... I can care less for spicy tuna, but if you're a fan then this might be a good roll for you since its served with spicy garlic chili sauce. \n\nAs for the sake we wanted the \"Drunken Whale\" but unfortunately they were out of it. We didn't know what to order instead since they have many to choose from, but our waiter highly recommended us to try the Chikurin. The sake was nicely chilled and dry. And it tasted sweeter after I had a chunk of grated wasabi root... which literally burned my nose. A medium size bottle is good enough to share with three people. \n\nThis nice little restaurant was cozy, and I enjoyed eating in the dimmed light with candles around.

Less is more is the motto here.  The owners are like curators who bring you a fine selection of the market's best every night.  They keep the menu small, focusing instead on the quality of each item.\n\nSimple sushi--sashimi, nigiri, hand-rolls.  When you have fish that good, you keep it simple and let the fish speak for itself.  If you appreciate sushi that's authentic and simple, you would love Umi.\n\nGreat sake and beer.  If you're into sake (and I'm not talking about Nigori or hot sake!), talk to Shamus--he's behind their awesome sake list.  \n\nFresh wasabi.  They now have fresh wasabi root on their menu--woo-hoo!\n\n\nAVOIDING DISAPPOINTMENT\n\nIf the following is important for you, I suggest you either reconsider what makes for good sushi or find another place more suitable to your taste.\n\nLots of \"flavorful\" crazy rolls.  Sure, Umi has its share of Caterpillars and Fire Dragons.  But if that's all you care for, there are cheaper places with more selections, and stronger sauces & flavors to masquerade their lesser fish.\n\nAll your favorite fish.  Since they \"curate\" a small selection of what's best that day, they don't always have all the usual suspects.  Don't get me wrong--I have my favs too.  But if I know I'm in a mood where I just must have certain things, whether it's Uni or Hamachi, I go somewhere where I know they will have it in stock.  When I come to Umi, I come with an open mind and leave my choices in the owners' good hands.\n\nHot sake and nigori is your only definition of good sake.  Not trying to be a snob here--when I'm with the right crowd in the right mood, I can enjoy a good cup of hot, cheap sake or sugary nigori too!  But honestly, I don't come to Umi in those moods and with those crowds (actually, I did once to rather disastrous results!).  You'd appreciate Umi a lot more if you have one or two favorite Junmai Ginjos or Honjozos, and look forward to discovering new ones.", "author": "Izzy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-26", "description": "This is a great neighborhood sushi spot.  Having been to Japan, I know how good sushi can really be, and I increasingly appreciate traditional sushi.  Although this isn't the best sushi I've ever had, it is made in a traditional style and that's becoming hard to find, even in SF.  So many places seem to rely on sauces, odd ingredients, and techniques that mask the quality of the fish and rice - Umi does not.\n\nFirst of all the restaurant itself is a great size.  You enter next to the kitchen, where you can watch the sushi chef who apparently makes all of the sushi for the restaurant, do his thing.  When you enter, to the right is indoor seating, and to the left is the outdoor patio.  It was a nice night so we sat on the patio, which is covered from the elements and has heaters throughout the space.  Overall the restaurant is small, yet clean and very modern (especially the patio).  \n\nFor dinner I ordered the Nigiri Deluxe, which for $23.00 seemed like a bit of a bargain.  You get eight pieces of nigiri sushi, six pieces of California roll (with real crab and very little mayo), and miso soup.  The food overall was outstanding though I thought the rice with the nigiri sushi was packed a little too tightly and lacked flavor (I'm used to rice with a bit more sugar and rice vinegar flavor - even in Japan).  The fish was all outstanding and tasted fresh.\n\nOverall I would rate this restaurant 5 stars, but the rice (which is really what sushi is all about) was not ideal for me, so I rate it 4.5 stars.  Each person has their own tastes, so I encourage anyone in the area with a craving for sushi to try this restaurant post haste.  It's a solid spot, and I can't wait to return here soon.", "author": "Tom G."}

Don't get me wrong, this is a positive and the bar is consistently raised in terms of the result from the food quality. \n\nUmi has a small selection of \"regular\" fish for nigiri...and that's okay by me since their specials menu is what they seem to emphasize. \n\nI ordered nigiri mainly from the specials list, like the renko dai, 2 types of saba (mackerel from japan), amber jack, barracuda, and the mejina.  You get all that...well it was actually a small list since i went on a sunday. \n\nUnfortunately i'm a bit jaded and have to overall give them 3.5 stars and round up to 4 basically because they are the only decent place in Potrero Hill (I've been to sushi live futher down and that place i do not like). \n\nWhy 3.5? Fish was fresh but their cut on the nigiri on some of the slices were only so so.  what i mean by this is that they did not seem to slice the fish professionally in a diagonal manner uniformly.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a sushi chef...but some of the slicing seem to compromise the texture of these fish.   I just had better technique elsewhere, but it wasn't bad.   Also the rice was pretty bland...i like a slight vinegar taste to my nigiri. From a neutral perspective you can order a tiny dish of fresh grated wasabi for $7...which they at least give you the option...but the fish prices of the nigiri was not cheap by any means... \n\nI also had the the beef negi tataki and some rolls for the kids.  The rolls were nothing special but served it's purpose to keep the kids happy.  The beef negi tataki was good though.  Thinly spliced beef wrapped around some green onion stalk with a terriyaki sauce that's not too sweet not salty.  it was good.\n\nThey do have a great selection of Coedo beer.  Really good japanese beer.\n\nAlso beware - No sushi bar... the sushi is done up front... when you walk in it looks like a \"roast duck\" counter.  Maybe that's why the cuts were inconsistent or some didn't look like it was cut in the hands of a pro...you don't have customers staring at you like at other sushi places.\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't go out of my  way out here on Potrero Hill for a repeat...but since a relative lives in the neighborhood I would probably go back... it's just that i had better in the city in terms of \"Fish Flown in from Japan Daily\".", "author": "Vien C."}

It just makes you happy to be there. My boyfriend and I walked in on a Tuesday evening at around 8:15pm and it was really quiet. We made ourselves comfortable in a table in the back corner of the small restaurant. We ordered some Sake and poured over the dinner sushi menu. \n\nWe decided to pace ourselves and started with the Beef Maki (about $10), off their special menu and the Spicy Tuna Tempura ($12), off they normal menu. My boyfriend though the Beef was better and I had a hard time choosing. Yes, the beef was very good and was very full flavoured. I would have liked to have seen the meat a little more tender. Nevertheless, very good. The Spicy Tuna was apparently a bit too subtle for my boyfriend, but I thought it was good. I liked the fact that it had been tempuraed before being cut into pieces, so that the tuna stayed untouched. The sweet chili sauce just gave it a very interesting twist. I'm sure I'm an abomination to all Japanese people, a I like the \"nontraditional\" stuff. Whatever, I'm only half. \n\nNext, we ordered the Umi Special ($13). I have to say that for something that is named after the house, I was disappointed. Not that it was bad, but I just expected a bit more. Eel is one of my favourite things in the world and I have to say that it was a bit over-grilled, making it a bit hard. Don't get me wrong, it was still good. Everything else was just better. \n\nTo finish it off... yes... we ate a lot... we had the Spicy Salmon Uramaki ($4.95). I was impressed. Not only was it cheap, but the salmon was fresh and flavourful and nicely threaded. It was spicy but not so much that it was overpowering. It was really perfect! \n\nAll in all, for $61 (including the $17 bottle of Sake), it wasn't bad for a date-night. Good sushi with good service (I wish I knew her name, but the waitress was so nice and attentive and didn't kill the annoying table next to us) is a rare find nowadays.

I haven't dined in the Potrero district before, but after coming to Umi, I should come here more often.\n\nI like their take on fresh and unique fish that is brought over to the US from various places.  I tried the butterfish and the baby hamachi nigiri, and was relatively impressed.  The presentation and the service were definitely a plus, though I assume it's because we were relatively early on a Saturday night.\n\nOverall, I liked it, and plan on coming here (when I need to blow off cash, of course).", "author": "Ren L."}

They're not as big as other one's I've had, but they were filling. I got tempura and hamachi; it also comes with salad and miso. They're hamachi was surprisingly good quality and I was happy. They charged me a dollar extra for hamachi (I think their choices were tuna or salmon sashimi to come in the bento). When the food took a little while to come out, they offered us a drink on the house, which was really cool! Their customer service is good, but I think it depends on the waiter you get.\n\nAt dinner, their menu is a little different. They don't have the traditional stuff like udon, but they have some cute small plates, nigiri, maki rolls and such. I tried one of their small plates, which was mature hamachi, seared with this really tasty sauce over it. It was REALLY good; the hamachi was fresh and tender again (just like at lunch) and the sauce really accented its taste. Dinner here would be a little on the pricer side, as that one small plate was around 12 bucks.\n\nI'd def come back; I enjoyed it here.", "author": "Christine L."}

Due to the impulsive nature of the excursion, the underwhelming exterior of the restaurant, and the sleepy residential location, my expectations were virtually non-existent. \n\nAs soon as we stepped foot through the door, my attitude completely shifted.  The ambiance was welcoming yet trendy.   Captivating textural art adorned the walls, relaxing electronic music was played in the background and our waiter was one of the most cheerful people I've ever met.   I don't know if it was his cornrows or the completely genuine smile that came across his face when he described the Shamus roll as \"smashing\", but we trusted him and ordered it along with the Potrero roll, sashimi sampler and miso soup. \n\n Their dedication to serving high-quality, local and sustainable fish was evident in the sashimi.  Everything was so fresh and delectable. I've never tried butterfish before, but it practically melted in my mouth.  The rolls were more expensive than I am used to but worth it for the size and overall quality.   It wont be long before I head back for the delicious food and great service.", "author": "Lauren R."}

Umi has great sushi for a great price!  \n\nWe trekked a little ways to get here, but were ravenously hungry when we got here.  It's a little hidden from the street but a great find.  You walk in and it almost seems like you're in the wrong place, but then you go around the corner and there are all the tables.  \n\nUmi is a small restaurant.  It can probably fit a maximum of 30 people.  We got there right on time before the lunch rush just in time to feed our stomachs that were screaming out, \"feed me!\"\n\nI ordered the bento box with teriyaki salmon and tempura which comes with miso soup, rice, salad and a small egg roll.  My boyfriend got the sashimi plate while his brother ordered a couple rolls and his girlfriend ordered a bento box as well and we shared some stuff.  \n\nOh how I wish there was a sushi place like Umi around my house!

The Boyfriend found this place and I've been back at least 10 times since for both lunch and dinner. Yes, it's a little pricey, but the quality of sushi is worth the price. \n\nWhere to start.... Umi has really fresh sushi. I didn't like sushi at all until I found out that I didn't like un-fresh sushi and Umi never has un-fresh sushi. Also, the hamachi is So Good. I like most of the rolls that I've tried. \n\nThe lunch special is great. For around $10 you can get a meal to satisfy any appetite and we're talking Japanese food, which is some of the lightest I've ever eaten.\n\nThe space is a little small and tends to fill up quickly for dinner, so don't be surprised if there's a small wait. They close at 2 after lunch and reopen later for dinner. \n\nThe sake selection isn't bad and the co-owner (the only white guy in the place) is very nice. \n\nI know Yelp reviews that offer suggestions are the most useful, but it's hard to make recommendations because I think everything I've tried has been good, and this runs the gamut of rolls, sushi and lunch special items. Also, don't be afraid to ask the waitress or co-owner what they recommend.", "author": "Christine P."}

He's incredible at his craft, and his co-owners Shamus and Russel, are all equally passionate and hospitable hosts. \n\nAlso- it's easy to spend $50 per person there on just sushi... or, $20.

If it was based on a one time experience then shame on her for not being objective. I have eaten there on many occasions and have had lengthy discussions with the owners about how they buy and source their fish.

But keep in mind that no one is perfect and that restaurants are organic beasts not machines like burger king or starbucks where they will never run out of an item. \n\nas a professional cook I know first hand the challenges of managing perishable products, and seafood is the HARDEST of them all. I have never had any fish at Umi that was questionable. \n\nWhat I look for in a quality sushi bar is fresh clean and precise. Not a place where they blow torch everything in site nor push booze on you. Umi's sushi is pretty spectacular because of the restraint of the sushi chef. It's much much harder to take something so simple and keep it that way. A lot of sushi bars are more about the song and dance and not the food.

This is two blocks from my house, and they NEVER asked my permission to move in.\n\nBut I went in for lunch. And then I went in the next day for dinner. And now it's my new favorite sushi joint in town.\n\nDude, who said agadashi tofu was allowed to be this delicious? I felt like Arsenio Hall punching people over cheese. And the fried smelt? I could have (and did!) eaten them like french fries. And the rolls. And the nigiri sushi cut from fish I HADN'T EVER HEARD OF. And the extensive sake menu culled from the fancy sake store in Hayes Valley...\n\n(Dear Wine,\n\nDid you know that sake has been kicking the crap out of you in the naming department all this time? Ooooh, you have Yellow Tails and Dancing Monkeys and Bubonic Penguins. How edgy! How urban! \n\nWhatever, Wine. Sake casually throws out names like Dancing Whirlwinds of Pissed-off Ninja Swords.

All of which are also different reviews. Back to Umi.\n\nIt's pretty inside. The art is cute without being twee, and Asiatic without being condescending.

Not to mention I like the pop art & subtle electronic music. \nThey've got a great sake selection with your basic (yet tasty!) house hot sake for an average price which i forget, plus a wide range of other choices if you feel the need to get a fancy buzz on.\nThe menu is very simple with a lot of Japanese specials. Their fish is flown in daily. Sometimes they run out of things, which to me is a good sign...but its a sad day when they've run out of a toro special. Oh how my tongue cries for the fatty belly when I miss out!\nI can't seem to stray from the habit of ordering the nigiri deluxe. I've rarely been anything less than HIGH off the wonderful selection, which always flows in a great order.\nI can almost rebound off the toro special if I happen to miss out & they have the fatty sardine belly.\nThey don't have a bunch of jive ass rolls with one ingredient different than 5 others but definitely have the classics & some good specialty rolls. I like the Shamus (one of the owner's names, who also serves food & is super chill) and the Potrero Roll...haven't had a bad or boring roll there yet.\n\nThis place can get a bit expensive for a basic dinner if you're like me and don't edit your damn self. I'm stuck on the aforementioned daily nigiri special and that's only about 7 pieces...so I always end up sharing a roll or two, plus a hot sake or two.....and the toro special, if I can get there in time, which isn't on the nigiri sampler, so I HAVE to order it....but a less expensive dinner can be had there & I highly recommend trying this spot if you're a sushi lover.", "author": "Crystal N."}

Overall the quality of the food befits the cleaner and classier setting. Nice job on the remodel, minor changes but effective impact! The portions were a little on the small side but the nigiri offered a nice mix of sushi and a california roll - which by the way was quite flavorful and not too fake-crab-alicious. \n\nAnd now my thoughts on the cod... my first taste prompted me to pause conversation, roll my eyes back and drool. It was delectably flakey, savory and sweet. There was such a nice balance in the dish. The richness paired well with the fresh salad. And then it hit me why I liked it so much. \n\nIt tasted exactly like a donut! No really, next time you have it, imagine a freshly fried, plain donut. Sooo weird.

As in, if they were close by (and they are for the time being), I would go every night. \n\nI had a ume & hirame hosomaki, Potrero roll, and a 5 piece hamachi sashimi, with 2 bottles of sake, to go. Every thing was \"shinsen\", which is super fresh in Japanese. I was impressed that the ume roll had just enough ume to flavor (enough to give it soul) but not overpower the roll. \n\nThe Potrero Roll had spicy tuna topped with salmon and avocado served with spicy garlic chili sauce. The tuna was not very spicy, nor was there hardly any spicy garlic chili sauce. Maybe it was just enough for a Japanese taste?\n\nI walked Basho doggie down the hill to order food, where he was complimented by a very nice Asian man in scrubs who was also waiting for his food from Umi's. The gentleman ended up taking a photo of Basho doggie since he is of the Shiba doggie kind, and made the gentleman very happy. \n\nI was impressed with the service from the tall gentleman behind the counter. I went around the block to give Basho an extended walk so that I wouldn't just wait in front of the restaurant while the food was prepared. I was astounded that he delivered my food to me outside, and also complimented Basho. \n\nMichael, my boyfriend, is now excited that I have found a place that exceeds Yume's. He has accused me of being the snobbiest Japanese Mexican he has ever known (that joke comes from him not knowing I was Japanese when we met.....He thought I was Mexican). I admit that my standards are a bit high, but I'm still not used to Americanised Japanese food.  My friends that I am house sitting for at 20th & Texas didn't even know Umi's existed. They thought I was crazy when I mentioned the awesome Japanese restaurant down the hill. \"Oh, you mean up the hill\", they said. Nope. \n\nSo there.\n\nP.S.- I just had the remaining three pieces of the Potrero roll, and it was still delicious two hours later, chilled.

I really liked how the place is laid out, so that you go through a kitchen area before you're seated and when you leave. The host and server were both really friendly and I noticed that when some newbies to Japanese food came in, the waitress took a lot of time to explain what things were and help the people choose what their child might like.\n\nMy only complaint is that when the server didn't have anything to do, she just kind of stood there on the side of the room, which happened to be right behind where my boyfriend was sitting. She would just stand there and look around until someone took a big drink of water or whatever, and then immediately run to fill it up. I have no problem with her desire to give good service, but that level of hovering was just downright unnerving. I realize the layout of the restaurant makes it pretty difficult for her to watch what people are doing without standing in the dining room like that, but it would've been fine if she hung out in the kitchen or something and just glanced in or made a walkthrough now and then to check on people. If it weren't for this one thing I'd totally rate the place 5 stars.", "author": "Lynae Z."}

It was not super inspiring. but it is good pick for someone that enjoy a fruity light finish with a hint of mint =D \n\nUmi has a great selection of sake...

Before I met Stewart (the chef), I was very meh about sushi: I would eat it, but it didn't spark me in any way, nor did I ever crave it for dinner. However, Stewart was able to do the two most important things for me with food: 1) prepare the food in its truest, most natural, ideal form, and 2) creatively combine flavors and sauces to come up with new beautiful complex food experiences.  And both of these endeavors are *delicious*. Thus, Stewart is a sushi artist. And now I crave sushi and drool. ALL THE TIME. \n\nOutstanding: Tako sashimi, Shamus Maki, sake, saba, uni (best eaten with a shizo leaf), 49ers maki, Beef Negi Maki, shiro maguro\n\nOBSCENE: Yaki Nasu.

The interior is pretty modern with lots of painting.  You have to go through the kitchen first to access the table area, which may be inconvenient.  Thankfully chairs and tables were stable.\n\nWe first ordered hourensou no gomaae (chopped boiled spinach with sesame paste) and agedashi doofu (deep fried tofu with broth sauce).  Both of them were pretty good, although I wished the restaurant would use more broth.  So these dishes ended up being just salty and sweet without having much depth on taste.  \n\nThe miso soup also did not have much broth.  Tea served initially did not have any tea taste, but as time went by, a cup of tea became much better.  That was perhaps because we went there right at the opening.  Dishes used were modern-, but not cheap-looking.  \n\nMy date ordered tekka don (sliced tuna over rice) and I ordered chirashi zushi (assorted sliced fish over rice).  Fishes were pretty good, although there was no surprise.  The dish itself does not supersede the best in South Bay, but still good overall, such that there was no fish that tasted too fishy, or the rice did not have vinegar mixed evenly.  \n\nService from waitresses was very attentive.  Sometimes I got nervous of her looking at us, but that was probably me.  The price was reasonable ($17 for both rice dishes).

Do you have a sense of adventure, or more conveniently, a car?  Then I encourage you to make the journey to Umi, and for your travails, you shall be rewarded with a gastronomic experience that is simple, sublime, and oh so pleasing to your palate and wallet.\n\nLocated on 18th street in the P-Hill, a favorite culinary locality of yours truly, Umi is a small space that is understated and unpretentious, with glass wall windows showcasing the kitchen and the adjacent dining room.  The message comes across simply, be prepared for a serene yet stimulating dining experience.  \n\nOnto the food: The sensory experience of consuming a fresh piece of raw fish is like no other.  The sushi at Umi is a vehicle of aquatic freshness, melting in your mouth, a crashing cascade of  rich, fatty, buttery marine life, and you feel closer to the earth, ocean, and the culinary gods.  Ya, the fish is fresh.  \n\nI could go on and on about the rest of the menu, the black cod, the ahi poke, but then again, it's about the fish, stupid(not you).  The point is, the menu is never static, and it changes to account for what was probably bought at the market earlier that day, which IMHO is the true measure of the quality and integrity of a restaurant, and Umi is a perfect example.  Kudos also to Umi's extensive sake menu, which can range from the cheap hot stuff to the more subtly sweet and sophisticated varieties.\n\nAnother major plus is the cost.  Unfortunately, due to demand and supply levels, and ever changing ecological factors, good sushi is getting harder and more exclusive to find.  Umi manages to maintain a unique combination of quality, freshness, and accessibility.  \n\nSo grab your friend(s) or special someone, and make the trip; waters will part, angels will sing from the heavens, and your tastebuds will celebrate in a delightful symphony of the harmonious flavors of the sea.", "author": "Michael P."}

The dining room was small and the tables very close together, but the fact we waited a few minutes for our dinner companions did not cause the service to suffer at all. In fact, the service at Umi was excellent. They were very attentive and for two recommendations they gave due to items we ordered being no longer available that evening, they were right on. The recommendations were for a 2nd bottle of sake - we ordered the last of the first bottle we ordered - and for a couple of orders of nigiri. \n\nOn to the food - Umi offers a number of salads/appetizers/small plates in addition to a good variety of sushi. Both couples started with a small plate of miso glazed black cod - not the best I had, but it was excellent. We then ordered a number of pieces of nigiri as well as a roll. It was all very good and fresh. Had I known, I wouldn't have ordered a roll, as I usually don't like to do that in a place where the fish is as good as it is at Umi.\n\nIn addition to the attentive service and delicious food at Umi, another reason it is worth going is the neighborhood. I hadn't been in Potrero Hill before - it's definitely a neighborhood I'd like to go back to just to walk around and explore a little.", "author": "Gary B."}

Will give them solid 4 stars if they weren't so expensive.\n\nWe randomly stopped by here after listening to our friend's live concert at a nearby cafe.  We got in right in the nick of time for their last order.  We ordered a few of their futomaki rolls, which isn't the traditional futomaki but are referring to those Americanized creative rolls like Caterpillar roll, etc. I wanted to try their hamachi kama and other dishes but we just didn't feel like spending $$$ on a casual night like that. \n\nWhile I find them a bit pricey and not really suitable for an everyday meal budget for most people, there were some definite qualities about Umi that is worthy of Yelping about : )\n\n-They have interesting, rare Japanese imported beers that you won't find in most Japanese restaurants out here.\n-They offer fresh, real wasabi, at an extra charge\n-Fish used in the rolls were fresh and delicious.\n-People here pay too little attention to the shari, or seasoned rice, that's used in sushi.  Umi's shari was one of the better examples I've found in SF.  Rice is on the slightly hard side, with each grain retaining it's shape and not being mushy or mashed together, and it is seasoned with a good ratio of vinegar, sugar and salt.  \n-I appreciate that they had a darker kind of soy sauce on the table in little saucers instead of cheap Kikkoman bottles with red and green tops.  Sushi and Sashimi are traditionally eaten with darker soy sauce i.e. tamari, and if this soy sauce wasn't exactly in the tamari category, it was close to that. \n-The waiter/waitress was polite and attentive.  The male waiter smelled like vanilla.  I know that perfumes and colones are actually something people in the food business really shouldn't be using (perhaps it's the snotty gourmet notion but they interfere with the aroma of the food that is being presented), however vanilla scent on a male was so rare and unexpected, it was kind of pleasant every time he walked by : P\n\nNegatives:\nAgain, price is on the high side.  \nAlso, for what they charge, the futomaki rolls were on the thin side.\n\nSo yeah, this place is pretty good but be prepared to splurge if you are starving!", "author": "Sascha O."}

Its important to keep in mind to try out a few basic staples when comparing sushi joints to keep measures consistent and for us, these are : Sake, Hotate, Shiro Magoro, and Butterfish (when available).  \n\nGOOD : \nThe selection is not as exotic as some of those previously mentioned, but there are fairly standard daily specials that can be sampled (i.e. nigiri special for $18 includes a taste of all of these). In particular, we approached critical of the Butterfish nigiri - but unlike most Butterfish at places other than Zushi, this one was a yummy reasonable substitute - conveniently located for us and will serve a quick fix at $5.  We also had the Hamachi Kama which was served in multiple smaller pieces, rather than the larger hunk.  Tasty, super flavorful, and I think it was $6. Large selection of sake, we just opted for the house HOT sake on a cold night.\n \nGREAT : \nWe were particularly impressed with the HOTATE and SAKE.  Large yummy pieces of fish.  Rolls were on the plain tip, but the Crunchy Spider Roll was freaking incredible.  \n\nThe non Sushi portion of the selection is extensive - good to please all tastes.

Fabulous yet simple and understated presentation. The fish was grilled to perfection - enough char to add that little bit of \"oomph\" to the already flavorful fish. Each piece was meaty, juicy, succulent, and oh so unbelievably delicious. I wish I ordered two plates.\n\nThe Hamachi Kama was the stand-out dish of the evening. However, I need to be fair and spread the love:\n- the sake we ordered was PERFECT! flavorful and fruity. Yes, the sake list/prices were a bit on the spendy side, but given the occasion (my friend's birthday), I didn't mind! Especially since it complemented really well with our entrees and dishes.\n- edamame was served cold, but the portion was generous for this type of establishment. Well done!\n- miso soup was .. miso soup. :) can't go wrong!\n- tuna poke appetizer was ... great, but interesting and simple presentation.  4 or 5 slices of sushi grade pieces of ahi, topped with a poke paste. The fish was melt-in-your-mouth fresh, but the presentation was a different way of serving poke.\n- beef negi maki .... oh so juicy. succulent. delicious. It was the perfect accompaniment and contrast to the mostly-fish dinner. So flavorful. I'll need to get the recipe. Elegantly delicious.. :)\n\nOverall, I really love this place. I'm just disappointed (in myself!) for not discovering this hidden gem in quiet, beautiful, Potrero Hill sooner.", "author": "Jill T."}

I hate to say its fresh because I see that as a hygiene issue and not something any sushi place should get credit for. You know? Raw fish - fresh? Isn't that just a barrier to entry and not something you get extra credit for? Well, Umi's is fresh but they'll get no praise from me on that score. Instead I'll tell you it is cut expertly. The flavor in the rice is perfection and its not packed too tightly. They also have all kinds of yummy things to eat besides sushi! My favorite is the Nigiri plate that has something like 10 pieces of different nigiri lined up on a loooong serving tray in order of flavorness - mild to strong. You really should get it. They also have super sakes (though a bit pricey) selected with that guy Beau from the Sake shop on Hayes. Check it out - you're going to love Umi.", "author": "Margaret G."}

Thank god it's still rockin' and rollin', but let's be honest, why wouldn't it be? Umi is a totally solid quaint neighborhood sushi bar that still has that friendly charm and oh so delicious food. I had to knock it down a star though. I ordered the regular nigiri dinner and swapped out the tuna roll for spicy tuna. While the nigiri was absolutely melt-in-my-little-mouth amazing, the seaweed had a disappointing rubbery chew to it. To help wash it down, though, I tried their special Shino beer (winter white lager). Now that was tasty and I had to hold back from ordering 5 more.

Everyone seems to love this place and I suppose it's for good reasons. It just so happened that my experience wasn't so good. In their defense, I came very late. 9:30pm on a Friday. I think they close at 10pm. So, I maybe I got the \"old\" cuts? Hmmm...I don't think that should matter, right? I mean, if the fish is good, it's good, right? Or at least it is suppose to be, right? --- So...the proportions weren't the best balance. The rice wasn't seasoned to my liking. In fact, it seemed like it wasn't seasoned at all. The fish was actually very mediocre. Nothing spectacular. Really! I'm not putting Umi down, I'm just replying to all the 4/5 star reviews. The bad part of my meal was the beer afterwards. Somehow, after having the small selection of Nigiri, the \"Echigo\" beer brought out a totally dirty/fishy taste in my mouth! Same with my dining partner when I ask her to try it!!! That was strange but I suppose the particular fish and that particular beer didn't mix well. \n\nThe service is wonderful. The place is nicely tucked away and you might even feel privileged eating there. As for the nigiri that I had...well, I can't say it was as good as everyone else says it is. I'm not saying it was bad...but I am saying that I feel there is a lot of \"hype\" surrounding this place. \n\nThere are 2 places in all of San Francisco that get my vote.

Lots of places in the bay area serve it and I contend that anyone who thinks uni tastes like the kitchen sponge has only ever had the vietnamese kind.  (the mofo at Hama-Ko in cole valley taught me this several years ago with a side by side tasting - he was right.).  \n\nwell i don't know where this uni came from ( i tried to ask but couldn't get an answer, which is suspicious). but it tasted like sewage. i mean the uni was sitting in what was possibly literally sewer water, a puddle of brown liquid in the urchin shell.  which tasted even worse than the meat.  we tried to tell the waitress.  she looked puzzled and annoyed.  she didn't speak too much english, so i simplified it for her and said \"you eat this.\"  i was saying you try it and maybe you won't be so confused.  but really i was saying let me give this to  you (or the chef) to eat and let's see how you would feel about that!!  i can go on trying to describe the taste for you further but i can't.  i just threw up in my mouth.  they didn't take it back, and i was too grossed out make a stink of it so we walked out for the last time.", "author": "Nikki F."}

So for my mom's birthday, I dragged everyone to Potrero Hill, nearly got lost and gave this inconspicuous restaurant a try. \n\nThe interior is dark and simple and chic, with large Japanese style DWR lamps on the ceiling. There were a couple of abstract paintings on the wall, and that's about all when it comes to furnishing. \n\nThe menu is pretty simple, consisting of various small dishes, specials, and sushi. \n\nFour of us ordered: \n\n-Agedashi tofu: super tender and tasty. Not the best I've had, but definitely near the tops \n-Sunomono: delicious combo of cucumber with fish, shrimp and octopus. well balanced taste and pretty presentation \n-tuna poke: tuna was buttery and delicious. comes with a garlic-y sauce that resembles eating Korean food \n-sakana: the famous cod! It was extremely delicious and hard to share with more than yourself. I don't know if it's the best cod in the city though. that seems a little exaggerated. \n-grilled butterfish: excellent fish and tasty sauce. however if you eat it with the cod, you will taste the inferior texture of butterfish and therefore wish you ordered two cod instead of one of each. \n-chef special sashimi: some sort of flying fish from japan? I can't remember, but they were good. And pricey. \n-hotate nigiri: excellent. so excellent we ordered another pair after we finished our meal \n-caterpillar roll: well, rolls are to fill us up, basically. but they were tasty. \n-yellowtail roll: also good, also here to serve the purpose of filling up. \n\noverall, great meal. friendly service. Although portion isn't big, we ended up full with a bill of $87 before tips for 4, which isn't bad at all for Japanese food.", "author": "Candice B."}

The fish are very fresh, the cut is precise and nigiri is well made. What let me down is the rice. It is way too bland, not season appropriately. After a few chew in the month, the taste of rice and its blandness enveloped the fish; what a shame. Also, the soy sauce they are using is also not for eating with nigiri.\n\nThe Agedashi tofu was similar, they got 80% right, where the tofu is perfectly fried and has the right texture inside and out but the soup is off the mark. Rather than a clear dashi soup, it is more sugary and syruppie.\n\nNext time, I will order the sashimi and bring my own soy sauce, after all, the quality of the fish is quite good.", "author": "Yi S."}

However, menu had changed & we were not impressed (except for the lovely art on the walls).\nFire Dragon Roll : Loved it & re-ordered. However, the second rendition did not have the fire. They were closing the kitchen, so maybe in a hurry missed the hot sauce?\nUni - Ash's way to judge a sushi place. Meh, he's eaten better. I have made my peace with Uni\nUnagi - They had Anago... and um, I much prefer Unagi. This one had no bbq sauce\nPortero roll - not bad, but didn't have the promised spice. But anything with avocado cannot go wrong.\nCrunchy spider -  too crabby, but I guess that was in the name. Also don't remember getting the mango chutney.\nGolden dragon - liked this one along with the ponzu sauce\nThe beers (orion & echigo) were too light for our taste & we were charged a dollar per extra per shiso leaf!

But after tasting the sauces used on several of the dishes- and seeing my friends practically fall over eating the sushi at Umi- I figured what the hell.  The fish was absolutely incredible.  I had some fish over pineapple (cod, perhaps?) and some Unagi- both of which were friggin fantastic. \nOther people have said this, but let me repeat- the fish just melts in your mouth.  We were fighting over the last pieces and getting drunk off the sushi. Best of all, the food was really reasonable.  Like, not annoyingly pretentiously expensive like lots of SF restaurants.\nAnyhoo, my only suggestion is to go with only one or two other people so that you get your fill of each dish. I went with like 8 people, and we were all fighting over that last piece.", "author": "Anjali J."}

It reminded me of newer generation sushi bars that I frequented while living in Japan for several years. The fish is fresh and the daily specials are a thoughtful selection of varied flavors and textures. I really enjoyed the agedashi (deep-fried) tofu in a richly favored broth sprinkled with katsuo bushi (bonito flakes). It was greaseless and light and fluffy. I liked that our waitress was from Japan and she was extremely knowledgeable about the food as well as the artisan beer and sake selections on the menu. All too often in San Francisco, sushi places are operated by uncaring owners who have scant knowledge and appreciation of Japanese food and culture. This is not the case at Umi. Unlike previous reviewers, I did not find Umi's pricing expensive. If cheap helpings of giant hunks of fish are your primary selection criteria, you really don't know sushi.", "author": "Keith R."}

The decor is simple and the place is relatively small (seats about 20-25 people) so it feels cozy like several of the other restaurants on 18th Street.   The service was quick.\nThe Food:\nWe ordered seaweed salad ($4 good), fried tofu ( $6.50 the best I've had in a very long time), sliced beef ( $9 excellent and very tender), and cod with pineapple salsa ($9 awesome).  \nWe also had hamachi nigiri sushi ($4 good but didn't melt in my mouth), and rock n' roll and california rolls ($4.50 not amazing but better than the more expensive rolls at Whole Foods!).  \n\nI will definitely go back.", "author": "Antoni W."}

The halibut & plum paste roll oddly arrived last and was fine but I really couldn't taste anything else over the intense wasabi. Overall, I was satisfied and full for under $30 after tax and before tip. I would eat here again.\n\nThe other odd thing is now I see they have dessert, but the waitperson didn't ask if I wanted any.

All the chefs in the back are the same even.\n\nUmi's menu is a bit muddled and needs some organizational help but has a nice selection of sushi and sashimi.     The rolls are your standard american sushi bar fair, but generally tasty if that's your thing.    The hamachi was not up to par (actually tough) and the saba was so so flavor wise but then again, we went on a sunday.   \n\nWhere I think Umi has the potential to stand out is the kitchen food, the yaki-nasu was outstanding and the beef wrapped naga-negi was very nicely cooked.   The cod had potential but was under marinated and falling apart in a over-cooked not good kinda way.  The salsa base it sat on was very tasty though.    They're selling themselves short by keeping this side of the menu small...\n\nAnywho.  Only giving it three stars as it's got potential but needs some work on a few things (no oshibori?  c'mon).    Would definitely go back though to give it another shot.    ...and yes, the service was very good.", "author": "sco s."}

There were 1 of only 2 tables occupied in the restaurant.  The rolls we ordered were some of the worst I have ever tasted.  The fish was really \"fishy\" (no pun intended) and would the seawead was cheawy.  It was way overpriced for the quality we recieved.  Around $15 for 6 pieces.  There was a new infant next to our table that was crying constantly.  We were not that bothered by the baby but the server approached the table and said something to them I couldn't hear.

Tried with a friend earlier this week and was really impressed by the service (very friendly) and how fresh everything tasted!   We tried beef enoki & asparagus maki -- holy crap, was extremely yummy.   Probably my favorite thing we ordered.  The beef was tender and with the veggies and the sauce... Mmm, my mouth was quite happy.    Also tried the butterfish small plate.  The fish was cooked perfectly and again, with the sauce was delicious!  We also had some sashimi including the monk fish liver which I am not a fan of (mostly because of the texture).  But my friend is pretty into it, and he said it wasn't the absolute best he's ever had, but definitely up there.  FYI, they appear to have a good selection of sake although we did not partake.  All in all, we had a very enjoyable meal.", "author": "Yvette H."}

The restaurant itself is tucked away in an ingenious layout such that the cold from the front door doesn't reach you in the dining area. We didn't have reservations and the place was packed but we only waited about 10 minutes for a table. The host and owner was very polite and made us feel welcomed immediately. The space is cozy and sturdy in a very northern california way. It made me think of Outerlands, for those of you who have been there. Lots of wood and low lighting. Noise level was average.\nWe started off with the broccoli rabe which was blanched and tossed with a  fresh sesame marinade. Sesame is a tricky flavor and can easily become bitter and have an over-roasted quality. Not so here, the taste of the sesame was very clean and balanced the bitter greens beautifully. Eggplant was less impressive, tasting boiled and a bit like donut oil, but that was ordered by my daughter and is not something I would normally order at a Japanese restaurant so I was not too worried.\nI should add that we had these delicious Coedo beers with our meals, soon to become household favorites. Malty, fresh, perfect foils for fish. We moved on to the nigiri special and the sashimi deluxe.  Then had 2 rolls (Cherry blossom and Potrero). Wow. The fish was beautifully prepared, very very fresh (of course) and the fact that the specials change every day depending on what's at the fish market made for some fun new experimentation, enough to push me out of the yellowtail/tuna rut. Not that the tuna wasn't amazing. Several types of mackerels were on the menu that night, which made me extra happy, as mackerel is one of my favorites.  On a minor note, the ginger was very fresh and spicy, the wasabi was plentiful, both of which impressed me as these are the small touches that can ruin a perfectly happy sushi meal.\nService was prompt, if a bit rushed (I think they were closing the kitchen and wanted to go home), but I can't really blame them for that. They do stay open a bit later on the weekends.\nI have not found a sushi restaurant in SF so far that has impressed me enough to make me want to return but that is no longer true. Umi is my new favorite sushi place and will probably place high on the rotation of restaurant nights which average 3-4 a week for us.  A short bike ride away from home, glittering city lights down the hill, a warm friendly space, great food and beer....yum.", "author": "Rebecca P."}

The sushi was exceptionally fresh and the service couldn't have been any better. Haven't felt like a diva in days! Haha. \n\nTiny tiny place... \n\nSushi was relatively cheap, approximately $3 and up, depending on what you want. Not to mention, it was quite fresh and yummy. Their black cod (sakana $10) was super good, but it came out with pineapple salsa on the side, which is quite inappropriate and unnecessary. I mean, given that they were two extreme contrasts...and where does this place advertise itself as a freakin Japanese FUSION place? *shakes head*\n\nWasn't really fond of sharing the toilet with the males, but have to say, it was probably one of the cleanest unisex restrooms I have been in the longest time. I'll be back, but not sure when... =D", "author": "Jennifer S."}

The restaurant was not too crowded for my group of four and we were warmly greeted and brought to a table. Our server offered great suggestions. We enjoyed our meal family style and therefore were able to sample various dishes. As many reviewers note, the sashimi is their specialty. I have NEVER had sashimi that tasted this fresh - it practically melts in your mouth. We especially enjoyed the fatty bluefin tuna from Australia. The grilled butterfish (small plate) was also excellent. They even have sashimi flown in from Japan - we tried the flying fish which was interesting to try. We also tried a few of their roles - the Potrero and Rainbow rolls. They were great, but you really need to come here to try the sashimi to experience something unique and special. The ambiance is more casual with the prices a little higher - but you are getting great quality fish for this price.", "author": "Shannon W."}

We thought we were somewhat happy with Live Sushi, mostly because it's close by and the sushi chefs are fun and nice.. But Umi is SO much better. The sushi chef is busy making sushi and doesn't bother trying to entertain you (unlike Live). Instead he's just focused on making delicious rolls.. we just ordered to-go so I can't review the waitstaff, but the people working behind the counter were incredibly nice. Everyone enjoyed their dinner and we will definitely be going back. Oh and three of us ordered a ton of food, and the bill was very decently priced. If you like solid japanese food without the sauces, weird dressings, etc.. this is a great fit for you.", "author": "Sarah D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-12-12", "description": "i like the backward layout of this place-- you walk through the kitchen to get to the dining area. we dropped in with a group of 6 and they handled it just fine. bento box with saba shioyaki and veggie tempura was pretty good. the saba was nice and firm, tasted like smokey coals and fresh fish. my only gripe is that it was cut like a small steak with skin on it, or maybe a thick filet. either way, i didn't expect a few spines to be hiding in the middle and they gave me an unpleasant surprise. veggie tempura was ok, crispiness retention of maybe 3 minutes.. not great. salad had plain vinaigrette, which is not bad but i was kind of hoping for gingery dressing. solid meal, good price, cute place.", "author": "Dana D."}

The sushi is terrific with lots of hard to find varieties like butterfish...but don't forget the small plates which are also out-of-this-world!  The sake is poured with a heavy hand and the place is a great value.  This is definitely one of my new favorites.", "author": "Erin R."}
