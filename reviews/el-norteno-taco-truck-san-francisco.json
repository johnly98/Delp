Be careful because there is another taco truck on the same side of the street that is a stone's throw away. Look for the signage that indicates \"El Norteno taco Truck\" (obvious, but I almost went to the other spot). \n\nWasn't really planning on getting taco's but I happened to be in the area and I had this place bookmarked for some time.\n\nAs other's have mentioned the wait staff is very friendly, dare I say amongst the friendliest/ most charismatic I've encountered at a Taco truck. In the rough and tumble world of SF eating establishments sometimes this can be make or break for a business, b/c let's be honest there are A LOT of options for Taco's, food you name it in a big city. It's this same logic that I'm extremely sweet to my wife b/c I know she has other options if I ever decide to \"change\"... : oP \n\nBut back to the tacos...I went with Carnitas , Tripas (chitlings) and Lengua . To top it off I just had to get Mexican coke because that cane sugar is just amazing. You can't have tacos without Mandarin Jarritos or Mexican coke...I mean..you can....but it won't taste nearly as good.\n\nThe tacos here were very good and firmly in the upper tier of my taco rankings below. Flavorful, juicy and fresh.  There are regulars here I can tell because the friendly wait staff was asking about their families , their work, it was like watching the bartenders at your local neighborhood watering hole. \n\nSolid spot would reccomend for tacos\n\nThe world needs a San Francisco Taco ranking...so I'm here to provide my humble list/rankings. \n\nRanking explained:  #1 (listed at the top) is my favorite/ #?  (listed at the bottom) is my least favorite. \n\nWhen I look at reviews sometimes just want to know where to go or how a user compares one venue against another to see if we have similar tastes. If you're curious, I have rankings for Boba, Bakeries and Ramen , Chicken and Waffles as well (random right?)  Follow my profile to see my most recent reviews.

Ordered a steak and a chicken taco and I was asked if I'd like them mild or spicy.  I'm sure you can figure out which one I opted for. Ssssss (ohh! that burns so good!). I have a pretty high tolerance for heat; for me it was borderline  intolerable. I'd recommend getting the tacos mild but asking for the spicy sauce on the side.  \n\nSpicy sauce/salsa: they definitely use orange habanero peppers and if you know what habanero peppers are, you would know that these lil babies not only pack a lot of great flavor, but are near the top of the list of having the highest levels of capsaicin. Pretty much the hottest pepper you can find at your local grocer.  This sauce is addicting, but definitely needs to be consumed with precaution! You will sweat, cry, go numb and possibly blind... But it's so good you will ache for more.  \n\nRemember... ORDER MILD - SPICY SAUCE ON THE SIDE!   \n\nNow excuse me while I go chug another gallon of water.", "author": "Shamina K."}

I stick around and watch the orders for a bit and it turns out only the people of my \"skin color\" are the ones getting the veggie nachos.

The torta I had was warm and toasted. They did not skimp on the toppings. It was fresh, flavorful, and filling. You can add eggs to your chorizo meat in case you feel like having breakfast at 4 pm. The chorizo meat was delicious. It was finely grounded, not chewy, very moist, and oozing with the famous red dye no. 6 color oil that all good chorizo meat have.

I was planning on getting a carne asada, carnitas, lengua and fish taco, but apparently they don't have fish tacos, so I got an al pastor instead.

However, they do include a few slices of carrot, radishes and jalapeno.\n\nThe tacos come with chopped cilantro, chopped onions, and a green salsa that is definitely legit spicy. My favorite of the tacos had to be the al pastor, as the meat was perfectly spiced, tender, juicy, flavorful and cooked just right. The carne asada was solid, but not amazing; it was tender, but it lacked flavor. The carnitas falls into the same category, cooked well but just not that flavorful.

I had the pastor and chorizo, which was piled on with generous amounts of guacamole, sour cream, and cheese, and then topped off with jalapenos and radishes.

Wifey and I had bought some KGB deals and finally were able to make their very limited hours since we do not live or work that close to the trucks. It is a shame because we are often in the area of the trucks at night, but they are not open. Anyhow, we ordered somewhat redundantly, which might have screwed us. By virtue of that, what is truly a 2.5 star review gets the benefit of the doubt as a 3 star review. Also keep in mind that I just got back from San Diego and ate nothing but Mexican food while there, so my standards are very inflated since they have the best style Mx food in the US there. \n\nWifey got the carnitas quesadilla and a buche taco for $10.50! and I had the buche burrito (all meat AKA SD style for $8.50) and the carnitas taco ($2). The burrito was a reasonable size, but still much smaller than the ones I was getting in SD last week for $4, but I digress. I'll start with the good. The carnitas were actually pretty good. They were mostly very soft, not that deep fried crap that they try to pass off as carnitas in places like, oh say, Texas. They had a decent smokey flavor and a little bit of crispness on the outside from the roasting. I liked them overall in the taco. The quesadilla, however, just didn't come together. I did not like the cheese that they used, not sure what type it was, but it did not really melt all that well. That being said, I think I prefer cheddar and colby blends of cheese over authentic Mexican cheese in my quesadillas, so they shouldn't lose points for my lack of authenticity. The tortillas that they used, however, were not very good, as is the case with most places that I have been up here. Very rubbery and they do not have the nice flower-y powder on them that always gets on your hands from really good flower tortillas. \n\nThe major issue here was the buche. It was terrible. I have never had buche that was this bad, or even bad at all, so I am clearly not a very critical customer when it comes to my organ meats. This version was completely bland, absolutely no flavor, and was so chewy that it was almost inedible. I have never been to a place that had good carnitas and bad buche because I think they usually get cooked similarly and come out with a similar smokey flavor. This was not the case and it was horrible. Why didn't I get the pollo asado burrito like I planned and just a buche taco? I mean, really, who orders buche from a truck where they have never eaten before? A guy who gets really excited about eating the stomach of a cow, that's who. \n\nAnyway, I can't complain about the price because we had our 1/2 off coupons, but otherwise I would complain quite a bit! Unfortunately, we will not be able to give them another shot because of the price, the inconvenience of the location and hours, and the fact that we would rather have the option of sitting inside and enjoying our food rather than waiting until we get home or eating at picnic tables in a grimey side street. BTW, I did not ding them for the fellow we passed who was shooting up into his leg in broad daylight on our way back to our car with our food.", "author": "Miguel V."}

(AKA: extremely low chance of food poising!!!)\n\n2) The good number of their repeat customers are brown skinned and speak mostly Spanish like my brethren down south.\n\nI tried it.  It was amazing.  I jones for their burritos, tacos, and tamales whenever I think of the place.  I've had everything from carne asada to their chivo (aka: goat).  Chivo is great in a taco, but a bit much in a burrito.  \n\nIf you're feeling brave they stock very spicy jabanero peppers which they will happily Julienne and use to mine your burrito with if you request it.  If you're not into flaming hot chili bombs every other bite causing a natural opiate rush similar to one you would get after being thrown down a flight of concrete steps I recommend trying some on the side in a taco before having your burrito mined with them as they are not easy to pick out.  I personally enjoy that sort of food-based pain/rush without the permanent damage or hospital bills.\n\nI also highly recommend getting sides of green sauce with your food, or red if you prefer.  Both are homemade and amazing.\n\nIt's a bit inconvenient by car because there is no place to stop and park, and if you do you'll likely make one of the dozen or so police officers roaming the area leave you an expensive note about it on your windshield.  If you are on foot, like Mexican food and don't stop here, shame on you!!!\n\nBy the way, an al pastor burrito with re-fried beans and jabaneros is a great if not messy hangover cure.

Often, the carnitas meat is accompanied by a few bits of the crispy pork skin cracklings, which are oh so good in a burrito.\n\nThe burrito size is also huge.\n\nColleagues of mine has also enjoyed other items, including their tacos and the consumme soup.\n\nThe truck also takes phone orders for pick up.\n\nThis truck is always busy so their inventory obviously turns over a lot.

I asked the truck staffer what he thought of the camarones, and he countersuggested the lamb. I went with his suggestion and was not at all disappointed.\n\nThe lamb was textured cooked to a point where it came apart readily but still had significant texture.  It was hard for my untutorted palate to pick out the flavors, espeiclaly writing this weeks later, but the lamb had obviously been marinated beforehand.  The torta was packed with peppers though, so I'm not sure what elements of the spicy, heady flavors were done ahead of time and what came with the assembling of the torta.  A lightest dash of sour cream rather than what i consider the traditional layer of soft mexican cheese rounded it out nicely with the usual vegetable mix of some lettuce and other sundries.\n\nEasily the best torta I've had in the bay area so far, but not at all cheap, it was around 8 dollars.
