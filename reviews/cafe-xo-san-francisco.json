The food came up and the quiche was cold in the middle. The bagel never came. We noticed a lonely bagel with just cream cheese sitting on the counter and inquired if it was ours. It was. We politely explained that we'd ordered egg and cheese, offered to pay any difference in price, and were told it wasn't usual to put egg and cheese on a cinnamon-raisin bagel. The woman at the counter proceeded to complain in Spanish to her co-worker about \"empty-headed asshole customers\". Of course we understood her (my husband is half-Mexican, and I speak several languages). We ate and left and won't be going back.

Since this place is in my neighborhood - I was looking forward to being a regular and frequenting this spot.  \n\nUnfortunately this place falls short with not only the coffee, which is OK - but the espresso definitely leaves a lot to be desired.  On top of that the prices are very unreasonably high.\n\nHowever where they do shine are the homemade croissants and their breakfast sandwiches which are very delicious and made to order. \n\nAnother note, if you are going here to do work or read, I recommend going elsewhere.  Hearing Celion Dion is one thing, but hearing a slew of really terrible sappy music, I hoped in my life I would never hear again - has caused me to walk out of this place.  It was too loud and borderline unbearable.\n\nBottom line: I really wanted to love this place, but for the price and the mediocre coffee, I'll walk that extra mile elsewhere.", "author": "Lauren B."}

I ordered a decaf coffee, and gave them my cup ( I hate wasting paper cups) which they used. Cool. The lady behind the counter was very friendly. \n\nSo I decided to treat myself to an apricot rugelach which from afar looked great (I wasn't wearing my glasses). Close up, it was small and hard as a rock; it looked like it came from a processed box you would buy from a grocery store- not homemade. Ugh. And to boot, it was $2.00!! \n\n I then realized I needed a $5 minimum to use my card and I only had $3.50 so far. Okay, so instead of just giving them 50 cents to bypass the minimum I then ordered a chocolate covered biscotti-- it was dinner time after all and it looked presentable enough. \n\nI sat outside and ate the rugulach and drank my coffee. Coffee was very nice but the rugalach was hard to bite into & overall \nI didn't enjoy the mastication process at all.    \n\nBiscotti was hard as well but I let it slide since it was a biscotti and was covered in chocolate ;-)\n\nI loved sitting outside but eventually went inside because it was getting cold.

I came here once before, for lunch, but went somewhere else because nothing on the menu particularly struck my fancy that day. However, a couple days later I came back for breakfast and had a fruit & yogurt parfait and a cappuccino.\n\nThe parfait was delicious. Plenty of fruit and yogurt and artfully presented in a large glass goblet with a tiny bit of whipped cream on top. It was definitely big enough to hit the hungry empty spot in my stomach that morning.\n\nThe cappuccino on the other hand was flat and unhappy. What vexed me was that they have really fancy bowls for the parfait but served the cappuccino in a paper cup. I would have expected at least a plain ceramic cup for a cozy little cafe like this. It just seemed like a strange juxtaposition compared to everything else; almost as if the espresso part of the picture was an after thought. However, I could have easily looked past this if the cappuccino itself was well made. Sadly the contents of the cup were as lazy and sad as the paper cup. The foam quickly went flat and the rest of the drink was just so-so.\n\nThis little cafe has a lot going for it and if they would simply invest in some ceramic cups and proper training for their baristas it would easily be a top notch espresso bar.", "author": "Jeremy G."}

It reflects the attitude and ethic of the \"Upper Noe\" neighborhood, sleepier and more blue collar than Noe proper along 24th Street. Like the other shops and restaurants at the corner of Church and 30th, XO surprises you with the quality of its offerings, in this case, solid coffee and great baked goods. The decor and ambiance isn't for everyone, and I suppose that even after years of coming here, it still isn't for me. I like coffee shops that are stripped down, wooden, and modern. Influenced by its owners, XO is more European and baroque.\n  True to the neighborhood, service is warm and unassuming. It's not so much a response to San Francisco's ice cold hipsterista movement as much a parallel world where Ritual, Four Barrel and Blue Bottle don't exist. \n\nIt's probably not worth a dedicated trip from outside the neighborhood, particularly since the only forms of public transportation that will get you here are the No. 24 bus and the dreaded J-Church. However, for those with an early reservation to La Ciccia, Pomelo or Tataki South, XO is a solid, underappreciated place to grab a coffee.", "author": "Julio A."}

You should be able to go and have a relaxing time and be greeted with a smile. Follow some footsteps of Starbucks. Today Jose told me that 'MONEY IS MONEY' when he gave me $2.25 in change back. I wasn't happy about that and that's why I'm here. He also bit at the girl in front of me because she wasn't paying attention. She began to order and he told her to wait because he was clearly busy trying to count all the change he was handing back to me. She was not impressed but I'm sure she won't be writing about it. Looks like she had bigger problems. He should really practice kindness.

You can make a whole chocolate cake, for what they sell a small slice for. One more thing, I really dislike, is how this place feels like a child care.

Every single time I have been in there the service is painful.  Incredibly slow and inefficient or nonexistent.  Today was particularly irritating.  I walked in and went straight to the counter, no need to browse the huge case of unlabeled pastries, to order a croissant.  The woman at the register was too busy chatting and laughing with another coworker behind the counter.  She looks at me, continues chatting & giggling and they move their conversation over behind the espresso machine leaving me to stand there waiting.  On a more typical day I'm left standing there waiting behind people with a million questions because all the pastries are unlabeled.  Other times I'm standing there waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting until finally no one appears at all and my bus is arriving so I leave empty handed.

Beyond your basic cafe grub, XO offers many tasty desserts, as well as a menu of \"gourmet\" salads and such.  Over all, I would probably give the savory menu 3 stars, and the sweet 4 stars.  Either way, XO offers much more food than your average cafe, without upsetting that \"cafe feel\" (i.e. it does not feel like a restaurant at all).  The coffee could be a little stronger (this coming from a guy who hears voices telling him to run away and become a mole chef in oaxaca when he has more that one cup of joe), but the mocha is delicious.

The place is spotless, the service superb, and the clientele a friendly neighborhood mix.  Owner Adam takes special pride in his baking -- the polenta muffins are excellent -- and the great staff includes Betty, Cassandra, and Cynthia.  XO Cafe is one of the places that makes Upper Noe Valley special.", "author": "Peter E."}

XO is a reliable source for bagels and hot tea.", "author": "chaz w."}
