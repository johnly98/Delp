Perhaps they rent it out for events, I wasn't really sure.\n\nIn any case, has a good, relaxed neighborhood-bar feel to it when we went in. As we ate, several police officers came in to grab breakfast and shoot the shit together.

Hefty size, served with orange slices, and good flavor- packed full of eggs, potatoes, sausage, salsa, and cheese with green onions and possibly a few other veggies. Very filling and tasty, I easily could have stopped at half but BF was chowing down on his own food- the steak and eggs bfast. I tried a bite of the steak and thought it was okay, BF inhaled it along with his sunny-side-ups and side of potatoes. I barely managed to finish 3/4ths of the burrito after BF took a few good bites, also agreed it was good. Never would have expected this decent of a burrito from a bar, of all places. Then again, thats great marketing- anyone who was there last night and woke up with a hangover could just pop back by!\n\nService was good. One bartender, appeared to be another woman helping bring food out and keep an eye on things.

The only reason I'm rating this place 2 stars instead of 1 is because I frequented here during the Warriors post season last year & really enjoyed the environment/service. not the case this time around.\n\nI decided to treat some of my staff members to some drinks & Warriors basket ball the week before last. I get to the bar around 5pm waiting for my staff. I'm standing at the bar for 8-10 minutes waiting for the bartender, no one was around, no biggie. 6 of my employees show up. We walk to the back room (just like we did last year) to watch the game & relax. As soon as we sat down a lady walked in behind us with, what I can only describe as, a very confused look on her face. I asked her if it was okay for us to sit in the back room (the TV is much larger & it's roomier). The young lady reluctantly replied \"Yeah but if you need drinks, the bar is over here.\" I felt the comment was unnecessary so I reciprocated the attitude by informing her I was waiting for close to 10 minutes to order a few pitchers. Her response, \"Yeah, well I'm here now\". Then to top off this entire ordeal She asks \"What time does the game even start?\", \"7:30\" I reply. Get this, she says\" well we close at 9:00\". My employees & I stared at each other & said , & I quote, \"let's get the fuck outta here!\"\n\nThis situation bothered me on a few different levels. Not to sound pretentious but I manage a company of roughly 70 employees. We're a customer service oriented business. One of our company core values is \"Customer First\". This value is not negotiable, we don't put the customer first when we're in a good mood or feel like it. The value is lived every day in our company. We put the customer first, period.\n\nI couldn't believe that someone would  speak to a customer the way this lady did. Granted I'm not a repeat customer year round but still you don't treat customers this way.\n\nI ended up taking my staff to Dear Mom, on the corner of 16th & Harrison.

I've been assured that plenty of places around ATT Park would fit my needs:  game audio played in the bar, cheering fans, camaraderie, historical crap on the walls, etc.  However, I don't want to go to the Park; I want a neighborhood local in Noe Valley, Mission, Lower Haight, Potrero. \n\nThe Double Play was nice.  Loved the stuff on the walls, the old back-bar and even the regulars were polite and into the game (just wasn't very many of them).\n\nI really enjoyed being served by the older bartender.

Maybe if I dressed like a scumbag and ordered shit beer I would get better treatment?  \n\nThe Old Timer bartender was slow, but friendly and I couldn't help but to call him Sir.  He's earned it.\n\nBeers were cheap and cold.  Nuts on the bar were fresh.  When I asked for a menu and learned the kitchen was closed, the Old Timer checked back with me a few minutes later and told me the kitchen would make me a cold-cut sandwich, and I thought that was very nice, although I was feeling more dinner at that point.  But props to them for trying to scratch that itch. \n\nI'll go back to the Double Play for a big Giants game, because I trust the fans will be there and the audio will be on.

Give me a place to sit, price the drinks reasonably, show me the baseball and leave me alone. I've been in this place before when it was crowded, but even then I found a place to sit. Last night was the best though:\n\nFour screens with the Giants game on them and the Cranky Old Bartender (let's just call him \"Cob\" from now on) had no objection to one of them showing the A's game, provided I could tell him what channel it's on. I didn't know. \"You don't know? What kind of sports fan are you?\" \n\nThe kind who doesn't have a TV, otherwise I'd be home watching the game. Fair enough - he hands me the remote so I can figure it out myself. Because clearly he can't. \"They got so many things programmed in there - you do it.\" I do. \n\nOnly five people in the place total - so quiet I can hear both games being called. I order a vodka tonic. He says OK. I say \"mostly tonic though\" and he nods. \"You gonna order one drink at a time?\" \n\n\"Is there a discount if I order in bulk,\" I ask but I don't get the answer because the phone rings and Cob grabs it. He says cranky things to the caller, hangs up, turns around and says to me \"Guy wanted to know if we were watching the Olympics... only he has his girlfriend call for him. Because he's smart - see? He knows men would rather talk to women. But I can hear him in the background, telling her what to say. So I said 'Let me talk to the fella next to you: No we are not watching the Olympics!' Goddamned cowards,\" he concludes while mixing me a vodka tonic that is half vodka and half tonic. It takes me seven innings to finish it but he doesn't push me to order another. \n\nWhen my glass is finally empty, I ask for a short glass of tonic only, just so I'll have something to drink and not feel like a freeloader. He gives it to me on the house. By the end of the ninth, it's just me, Cob, and one other guy, Cob having locked the front door around 9:45. I do believe he would have stayed open for us until the Giants game ended, but the A's went into extra innings first so I tipped well and said goodnight. \n\nNew favorite (weeknight) sports bar.", "author": "Will R."}

He has the gift of storytelling and will have you in stitches in no time with his expletive filled yarns.  Listen carefully, though, depending on how many of his own mistakes he has had that night he can be difficult to decipher.\n\nLocated somewhere near home plate at the old SF Seals Stadium (16th and Bryant), this sports bar provides the perfect pulpit for The Bishop to sermonize.  Frank Sinatra and Cab Calloway play overhead, providing an appropriate soundtrack, while old photos from days gone by capture a very different time.  \n\nIf you want prompt and courteous service, don't go here.  If you are looking for a throwback watering hole where the bartender IS the entertainment, this is the place for you.  The Bishop himself provides a caustic point of view on just about any topic, from senior sex (like pushing a marshmellow into a peanut bag) to war(why don't they draft all the old people to fight who are ready to die anyway?).  Want advice on how to keep your marriage exciting?  The Bishop will tell you, whether you like it or not.  He is a self-described expert on the ladies even at his advanced age, currently dating a Korean lady 25 years his younger.  I don't know if it makes him an expert but you gotta give him props!   \n\nI went in for a quick beer and stayed for well over an hour listening and laughing hysterically at the Bishops take on life.

I mostly eat breakfast there, but I have also had lunch there too on a few occasions, and it's nice. The bartender on Sunday mornings, who's name I forgot, always recognizes my girlfriend and I and hooks us up with either a bloody marry (very tasty) or a mimosa for free. Service is always good, they gladly took back my girlfriends french toast when it was under cooked and cooked a new order (didn't re-cook the same toast). Don't miss this place especially if you're into baseball.\n They do have a strange system with how they use credit cards, but there is an ATM if you feel like paying cash.", "author": "Garrett H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-17", "description": "The fact that Double Play only has 25 reviews on Yelp speaks to the fact that we're just not the crowd they cater to!  Younger people, that is.  You see, across the street, where the Safeway shopping center stands, used to be the home of the Seals.  The interior of the bar is chock full of baseball memorabilia.  Celebrating it's 100th Anniversary, I think it's safe to say this place is truly...Old School  \nMain highlights of the Double Play experience:\nThe bar begins serving at 7:00 am, you might find off duty postal and UPS workers at the bar, lots of working class folk mixed with guys from the office- and for a San Francisco bar, the place is crawling with straight men!!  It's definitely a sports bar/restaurant.  \nThey have pretty decent Italian food the kind you might find comforting, but not great if you are from the East Coast.  Lately I've ordered take out from their kitchen, and I give them props for using eco-friendly to-go containers made of potatoes, of all things.  I usually get fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken, and the pasta is actually really good.  Thanks for the patience with my order, Double Play!  \nA couple more highlights include their own parking lot, with a valet, and large banquet tables in the back for big groups.  I've seen many a holiday party roll out of here mid-day, looking very Jolly.", "author": "Melissa B."}

The bartender came right over and we asked if they had happy hour.  He told us that most beers are 3$ and we were excited.  We had several rounds and asked for a menu.  He gave us the menu, we ordered what the prices were, but when the bill came, the charges were inflated on the food and our beerz were $5.  When we asked about it, he told us that our beer was the only beer for that price.  He should of told us that when we ordered.  It is very unprofessional!  We also observed the bartender giving multiple on the house drinks to his buddies while we were there for 1 1/2 hrs.  I gues the bartender had to make up the price differences to the house.  Better spots to watch the games, get better deals, food is mediocre @ best.", "author": "Mark C."}
