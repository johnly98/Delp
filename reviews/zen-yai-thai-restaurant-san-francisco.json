Because it's not overly crowded/busy. And I want it to stay that way. But they deserve the people's love :)\n\nFlavors are close to 4 stars. 5 stars if you're evaluating it for what it is: a low key, casual dinner. Service is closer to 3 stars. Value (price : quantity *and* price : flavor) is a definite 5.\n\nZen Yai is my go-to place when I'm craving Thai but not trying to break the bank. It's an excellent value-play, each entree coming to about $9-11 bucks depending on your protein option.\n\nPescetarian / vegetarian options are plentiful.

This is my neighborhood Thai restaurant and I've been going here for over a decade.  It's one of the last restaurants that still serve good food at really affordable prices. The menu is vast and I really appreciate that they have several combos for those who want a little bit of a sampler. \n\nThe chicken satay is my go-to appetizer and it really goes well with the pickled cucumbers and the peanut sauce.  Generally, I'd get one of the combo plates but I decided to get the seafood claypot at a recent trip. All of the dishes are solid.

Parking was easy to find this time, but it's not always easy in the Tenderloin part of SF. \n\nWe ended up ordering the silver noodle salad (medium spicy), tom yum boat noodles, and the all beef boat noodles both with silver noodles. All these dishes were super good and flavorful. The silver noodle salad was a bit too sour for my taste, but the spicy level was just perfect. The boat noodles were by far my favorite, and you cannot beat the price (less than $5 each! for the small size). Highly recommend the Tom yum boat noodles. \n\nService was good as well.

A little too solid - the papaya salad is a force to be reckoned with. Pungent! I personally haven't had it, but the table next to me definitely was chowing down. I'm told the papaya salad is a Northern version of Thailand, not what you would typically see in Bangkok. They incorporate raw crab to give that super pungent taste.\n\nThe food here is affordable! About $9.50 gives you an array of noodle soup options. I had the Tom Yum soup.

My friends also got boat noodles. Was surprised that the bill was only $50! For 3 bowls of noodle soup, crab fried rice and an appetizer. You don't get a huge portion for the noodles but it was a good size for me lol. \n\nService was so-so but good food. They also have snacks for sale in the cashier area.

I like to sample a variety of dishes so the small boat noodles were perfect for tasting (you can order the large bowl as well which was probably 3 times as big). \n\nWe ordered one of each: \n   - Beef boat noodle with thin rice noodles - dark and unctuous broth, a bit of a kick - definitely a must try. \n   - Pork boat noodle with thin rice noodles - same broth and flavor as the beef boat but with beef pieces instead. \n   - Seafood boat noodle with flat rice noodles - came out pink and tasted VERY vinegar-y. I wasn't a fan bc of the sour taste \n   - Tom Yum boat noodle with flat rice noodles - sweet and sour taste with garlic. this was average. Think tom yum soup with less spice and noodles added\n   - Chinese Doughnuts - came with a side of condensed milk for dipping. Try dipping these babies into your noodle soup (without the milk). \n   - Papaya Salad - fresh, savory, kinda spicy and packed with garlic and flavor!\n\nPlace is great to try at least once but I left hella thirsty bc of all the sodium I consumed.", "author": "Allie D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-08-14", "description": "This place is great! The boat noodles were unlike any other dish I've ordered at a Thai restaurant-- I honestly can't remember ever having something like this elsewhere.\n\nThe broth is this really rich and dark beef broth. It's balanced teetering on the edge of almost too salty, but the flavors are so good. I definitely *almost* felt bad about finishing nearly the entire bowl of soup. The large portion is plenty filling for a dinner meal.\n\nYou can customize what type of noodles and what types of meat you want in your bowl. I opted for the thin rice noodles, which are pretty similar in size to the noodles you would get in pho. Next time, I'd probably try the flat noodles instead so the broth clings a bit more to the noodles in every bite. The beef was just beef, not particularly memorable but it fit the dish well. \n\nThe dish is garnished with what are basically chicharrones/fried pork rinds. It's odd, but I thought it worked well as a garnish on top of the dish. It's definitely a race against time to eat them before the soup makes them soggy!\n\nThe best part? This place is so darn cheap. Every entree we ordered, boat noodles and others, were all generous portions for less than $10. Incredible prices for a great and really authentic feeling Thai restaurant in San Francisco. The catch? It's in the tenderloin.. but this place is well worth the adventure getting here.", "author": "Tien L."}

You can opt out of the proteins if you want a vegetarian option, and add in tofu, just make cerain to specify it upon ordering.

I got the Combo #2 (Shrimp Pad Thai, Yellow Curry, wontons, rice and salad) and the Fresh Spring Rolls. AND OF COURSE we got the Thai Iced Tea!\nEverything was so amazing and our servers were great as well. My one complaint though is that it took a while for our water glasses to be refilled but that's okay - the rest of my experience here made up for it.", "author": "Gerone A."}

Luckily for me Zen Yai was open so i could satisfy my noodle cravings.  The establishment has large and airy dining room, which was mostly empty at that weird hour.  I got a Zen Ta Fo noodle bowl. And Zen Yai Thai did justice to it. The broth had the distinctive red color and pungent but not overwhelming fermented tofu fragrance. It came with assorted fish balls, tofu, white mushrooms, tiny pieces with squid heads. I expected the traditional ong choy veggies, but instead got a few leaves of spinach on the bottom of the bowl. I wish it had real fresh shrimps and more squids. The bowl was barely spicy. I had to doctor it up with the dry crushed red pepper. I chose the flat rice noodles which I highly recommend. Overall, it was a satisfying bowl. Bonus was the staff was quick and courteous. I forgot my credit card and had no problem getting back. I definitely will return to try other dishes.", "author": "Thuy V."}

I got the boat noodles with the thick rice noodles and it was out of this world, probably even better than the ones I had in Thai Town L.A. \n\nThe grilled pork with sticky rice and it was pretty good too. The pork tasted sweet with some ginger/lemon grass flavor, similar to Vietnamese grilled pork/beef. Clay pot chicken rice was good, though it's a bit too saucy and not burned enough to bring out the rice flavor. This particular dish is somewhat similar to Malaysian/Singaporean style with lighter sauce. The fried chicken wing has the typical sweet chili sauce so it's less unique than other dishes. \n\nLiving in South Bay I envy all the San Francisco folks who get to go to quite a few good Thai restaurants in Tenderloin!", "author": "Ken L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-20", "description": "Been wanting to come for the Thai Boat noodles for the longest time (I don't really like going to the city, i can never find parking LOL), after many recommendations from friends and the disappointments of finding great Thai Boat Noodles in the East Bay, enough was a enough and I decided to venture out to the city and try this place out. I immediately found parking right across the street from the Restaurant and thought to myself, \"this is it, this is the one that's going to be just like Pa Ord in LA. It's going to be a good day.\" We were greeted and seated immediately.\n\nFood\n\nMy partner and I ordered the large Beef Thai Boat Noodle, the appetizer sampler, small bowl of Pork Thai Boat Noodle for myself, Thai Ice tea and Thai ice coffee. We received all our main courses before the appetizers. \n\nLarge Beef Thai Boat Noodle: \n\nThe flavor was on point. The broth was thickened with blood (how i like it and hard to find around the Bay). The broth was rich, spicy and with a light hint of sweetness. Getting Thai Boat in most Thai restaurants usually consists of typical beef broth and usually  hella sweet, not this place i can deem that Zen Yai Thai has the best boat noodle broth I've had in the Bay Area. \n\nWith that being said, it wasn't the perfect Thai Boat noodle I was expecting. We had to wait a little for the broth to cook the Rice noodles a little more because it was still hard. the meatballs that was included with the noodle soup dish was expired. One bite into it it tasted sour with a funky after taste. We didn't want to be rude in front of all the people who were enjoying their meal so we just picked it out and enjoyed the rest of the ingredients in the dish. \n\nSmall Pork Thai Boat Noodle:\n\nThis sizing is the typical size you'd get in Thailand and you can finish it off with one or two bites. it's exactly like the beef thai boat noodle but with pork balls and I can gladly say the pork balls were not expired and the noodles were cooked perfectly when it was served. The broth does get altered in taste slightly because of the pork, it was still really good but, i'd prefer the taste of the beef boat noodle.\n\nZen Yai platter:\n\nWe receive our appetizers last and at this point we were pretty full but, we still managed to finish most of it that rolled us into food coma zone. The dish consisted of deep fried calamari, shrimp egg rolls, and an egg roll with two sauces (sweet thai chili sauce and a regular sweet sauce). The calamari was cooked perfectly and tasted great. The Shrimp egg rolls tasted like what you get homemade but the shrimp was way larger. The regular egg roll tasted so fowl and in order not to spit it out in front of everyone I had to swallow it whole and wash it down with coffee immediately. \n\nEnd food review\n\nThe service was great in the beginning and like many Asian restaurants, once your food is out good luck trying to get some attention. Like another reviewer said many were in the back chatting it up and or eating. My partner had to wave to get some attention from the servers to get a glass of water and check. It's nothing out of the ordinary for what we're used to. \n\nThe flavor of the thai boat noodle comes the closest to what i'm used to and i've been searching for the best one for about a year now and for now this is the best one i've had minus the expired meatballs (I've still have to to try the San Jose one, that's coming next). The food seems very authentic looking at other peoples dishes and the thai specials on the wall that's written in thai. The only thing i'd worry about coming here the the freshness of their ingredients so be careful other than that it's some good authentic thai restaurant that I'd come back to if i'm in the area but, not something i'd go out of my way for.", "author": "Alex T."}

As a busy, young professional, I depend on affordable and reliable take-out at least a few times a month. After trying out 2 other Thai restaurants only blocks apart, Zen Yai Thai has become my favorite so far! \n\nZen Yai Thai offers delicious Thai food at a very affordable cost--most entrees are under $10, which is practically unheard of for a restaurant that serves food this good. While the area is expensive, albeit not as expensive as other parts of SF, I have found my spot! I highly recommend the BBQ half chicken, which is very juicy. I also enjoy the crab fried rice; it has real crab. Lastly, the combo meals are a great deal. I could easily make 2 meals out of it. I usually order combo 2: pad thai and chicken curry with rice and a side salad. \n\nI usually order delivery from the Yelp Eat24 app, but on occasion when I'm on my way home, I will order pickup. The restaurant, itself, isn't in a nice location. It is what you would expect the Tendernob to be--trash on the street and grimy. Inside the restaurant is more welcoming, but nothing fancy. Nothing like Osha Thai. No table clothes. No flowers. \n\nThe more I go to the restaurant, the more I realize this place is a hidden gem. A few times, I've seen people bring friends or family from out of town. Even today, a family reserved a table. From the looks of the place from the outside, you would never guess how tasty the food.

They're the best in flavor and in value. Where else can you find $2.50 bowls of noodles?!\n\nMy friend recommended this spot for the cheap $2.50 boat noodles. It's not in the best of locations (hello Tenderloin!), but I imagine it's the shady surroundings that keep the menu prices down, so I'm not complaining. We stopped by shortly after 11AM on a Saturday. Relatively quiet and got a little busier around lunchtime but not crowded.\n\nThe menu they hand you has the typical things you'd find at Thai restaurants: noodles, rice plates, curries, stir fries, etc. Everything's pretty cheap around $7-8, $10 max. But what you really want is on the Thai menu on the wall; that's the real highlight here, the BOAT NOODLES. In Thailand, boat noodles are served in small bowls and people order many bowls, leaving tall stacks of empty bowls when they're done. Here, you can get a small size for $2.50, either with beef or pork, or you can get a large for $6.95. There's also small bowls of TOM YUM and YEN TA FO for $3.50, or $7.95 for large bowls.\n\nMy friends and I ordered 1 each of the small bowls - beef boat noodles, pork boat noodles, tom yum and yen ta fo. For small bowls, they were actually a pretty decent size. If you're like me and like trying several small dishes vs getting one large dish, these small bowls are perfect. 2 would probably be good if you have a smaller appetite; 3 if you have a larger appetite. Basically lunch for as little as $5! Not quite the prices you'd find in Thailand, but close enough.\n\nWe also got fish cakes as an appetizer and red duck curry to share, but personally, I would just stick with the small bowls of noodles. They were much more worth it from a cost, portion size and taste perspective.\n\n* BOAT NOODLES ($2.50 small, $6.95 large) - 5/5\nThese were my favorite of the small noodle bowls. Dark, muddyish broth with thin noodles, beef or pork, meatballs, veggies and chicharrones. Both the beef and pork were tender, and the broth was deliciously bold and flavorful.\n\n* YEN TA FO ($3.50 small, $7.95 large) - 4.5/5\nPink seafood noodle soup that included fish ball, squid, coagulated pork blood, veggies and fried wonton chips. Good flavor and a little spicier than the other noodles.\n\n* TOM YUM ($3.50 small, $7.95 large) - 4/5\nSlightly sweet, slightly sour broth with noodles, meat, veggies and fried wonton chips. I liked this as a lighter flavor profile in comparison to the other noodles, but it didn't impress me as much. I think there was pork liver in this one, so be careful of that if you don't like liver!\n\n* TOD MUN / FISH CAKE ($6.95) - 5/5\nEver since I had fish cakes in Thailand, I've always wanted to get them at Thai restaurants back home but they've never been quite as good. The ones here were amazing! \n\n* RED DUCK CURRY ($8.75 rice plate) - 3.5/5\nNot bad. Flavorful curry with duck, pineapple, bamboo shoots and bell pepper, but as far as curries go, it was pretty standard. The duck was more fat than meat, so I found this to be more just rice with red curry. I'd skip in favor for 2-3 small noodle bowls, which would be the equivalent portion size.", "author": "Jessie L."}

My wife moved here from Thailand over a year ago and we've tried every Thai restaurant practically. Zen Yai is the only spot she will eat boat noodles. The flavors are very close to home she says: savory, rich, herbal, and delicious. I'm giving two stars because of service- in which I've seen a pattern with other reviewers who gave less than 4 stars. We dine here frequently and are familiar faces- dining at the restaurant maybe 3-4x a month. We will also make sure to grab a few of their snacks and desserts to go - adding onto our bill and tipping no less than 20% on the total each time. I would say, we are pretty loyal no fuss customers. Recently, we did nothing of the ordinary. After dining, my wife went up to grab some of her desserts to add on the total bill. A server (male, short, heavy build) screamed at her from across the room asking her if she was going to purchase it- berating her in front of customers and embarrassing her. 1) I understand he might have felt he was doing his job 2) his attitude isn't reflective of the Thai culture 3) we are repeat customers. I know restaurants can become arrogant and lazy when people return for their food and they become a popular destination, but this isn't any way to treat any customer. San Francisco is becoming a revolving door for small businesses, I would think the owners would want everyone to feel welcome and retain their loyal following. On that note, his treatment of my wife was bad enough for us to make a decision to cut down our trips to Zen Yai. There are several other competing Thai restaurants, especially talented chefs who are offering more authentic esan flavors. This is a true and genuine yelp review: not trying to bash the place. I think customers should also be treated with respect as much as restaurants and chefs demand it for themselves because it is true hard work to keep a business going.", "author": "Michelle M."}

Unfortunately, Zen Yai resides in one of the more challenging neighborhoods in the city - the Tenderloin. But do not fear children! Lock your cars, hope for the best, and head on over to Zen Yai for one of the best bowls of boat noodles you'll ever have! \n\nThai beef boat noodles come with a savory reddish black broth that is packed with delicious full-bodied flavor, your choice of chewy thin or wide rice noodles, a beef ball, spinach, and crispy chicharrones (fried pork rind). $2.50/small bowl or $7.00/large. They also come tom yum style with a sweet and sour soup broth. You'll see many patrons with multiple small bowls of noodles at their table, so order up! Oddly enough, the boat noodles are NOT found on the menu. You'll find a discrete white piece of paper pasted on the back wall with the off-menu special. Boat noodles are not commonly found in Thai restaurants, so definitely take advantage of the opportunity to try them here! \n\nThai iced teas and coffees are a must at $2 and the pad thai, pad kee mao, and papaya salad are dishes I've tried and enjoyed here. Open until 1am on Friday's and Saturday's, Zen Yai is one of my favorite places to go after an evening out with friends. Especially, if you only want a small, but satisfying bowl of noodles to warm you up and end the evening on a high note.

It was really cheap, too! I definitely could have eaten more than 1 large bowl of it. I had the dish with beef and flat noodles. The broth was really flavorful, and quite spicy. There was a hint of sweetness, but overall very fragrant. I thought the beef was bland and pretty overcooked. We also got a shrimp salad to share. It was a collection of chopped tomatoes, cucumbers, cilantro, and a few shrimp. Not super impressive, and the sauce all collected at the bottom.

The delivery items were also packed in nice containers that showed thoughtfulness (for example, the thai iced tee was not only in a plastic bag but also had tape on the lid so it wouldn't spill).\n\nPad Kee Mao with Shrimp: Excellent price ($7.50 I think + $1 for shrimp) and while the portion was not the biggest, it was definitely fair. I requested this to not be too spicy and upon opening it, I was a little scared by the number of jalapenos on top. They were basically just there for show though, I removed them and this was actually pretty mild, especially for Pad Kee Mao. Adding some of the jalapenos back was the perfect amount of heat for me. I enjoyed this and liked that it had a good amount of veggies as well. I would order this again. \n\nPumpkin curry: Tried just a little bit.Not the best pumpkin curry I've had in San Francisco, but it was alright. The chicken in it was far better than I expected it to be (I really liked it actually) and it also had a little bit of shrimp. Lots of pumpkin as well which I liked. I found it to be a little bit too heavy on lemon grass and spicier than I like my pumpkin curry.Requested that if they provided rice, it would be brown rice, but the order still had white rice. I think I would skip this next time (because there are a lot of other items on the menu that look promising) but it wasn't bad by any means. The portion of curry was also super generous, and a good deal at about $10. Again, the price was definitely a good deal. \n\nThai coffe: Really good, and again, cheaper than most Thai restaurants ($2). It was pretty strong and not sickeningly sweet.

I thought the flavors were OKAY.  will give them credit for their noodles. I got the regular rice noodles and loved the texture. However the flavor was more on the bland side.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-23", "description": "I'm surprised I've never tried Zen Yai, even on the Eat24 app, before last month since I tend to show up at most of the popular spots in the Tenderloin at one time or another. What finally drew me in was all this talk about their Boat Noodles. I didn't know what they were, but I figured I like noodles and I've been on a boat, so what the hey. It's on that stretch of Ellis that veers between sketch and scary, sometimes at a moment's notice, but now that Rusty's Southern has moved in across the street, maybe this can turn into a gourmet ghetto. Anyhow, I came in and found there was just a handful of customers in what appeared to me as a fairly spacious place.\n\nThere's quite a bit offered on the menu as you can see (photo: http://bit.ly/1Gp3WSk). However, I came for these Boat Noodles which were most definitely off the menu. That gives them the cachet among Yelpsters especially. I found out there were two sizes - $8.95 for a large bowl and $2.50 for a sampler size. Perfect, sampler size please. It was definitely a sliver of a portion, but they managed to get a lot in the baby bowl like a muddy-looking broth with rice noodles, spiced pork strips, a strange white meatball that I pray was safe to eat, and all these pork rinds on top (photo: http://bit.ly/1DGbARl).\n\nI just found it odd, somewhat tasty but basically a miss compared to a good bowl of pho. I'm not sure where the boat part comes in, but I felt like I was in steerage. The rest of the meal, however, was quite good. First off were those $7.95 Zen Yai Spring Rolls. They were filled with shrimp, tofu and vermicelli as you would expect but wrapped with an extra-thick rice wrapper that lent a nice chew (photo: http://bit.ly/1QqzJ84). It was particularly sturdy when dipped in the peanut sauce. For my main dish, I went for the $8.95 Seafood Eggplant which I requested have just calamari. Not sure why, diva moment I guess. It was tasty marinated in a basil and chili sauce and accompanied by rice (photo: http://bit.ly/1Gp3CD9).\n\nI've come back with Jamie W. on a couple of occasions now, and other dishes stood out such as the $7.50 Pad Se-Ew (Drunken Noodles) with Chicken, Broccoli and Carrots (photo: http://bit.ly/1bzJOjw) and the $7.95 Duck Noodle Soup which was full of the quack (photo: http://bit.ly/1ExEIRg). I was less in love with the $6.95 Wings of Love, chicken wings which were deep-fried and coated in a heavy spicy-sweet sauce that made a trip to the cleaners inevitable (photo: http://bit.ly/1aX79dE). Nonetheless, It's starting to feel like our go-to cheap Thai spot for now.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...sure wish I missed the boat on those noodles but the rest is very good, especially those spring rolls\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...relatively spacious though it gets crowded fast\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...first visit it was great, subsequent visits were spottier\nTOTAL - 4 stars....good Thai is always worth keeping in your mental rolodex", "author": "Ed U."}

I ordered my usual pad kee mao with chicken, and the rest of my table ordered garlic pork w/ rice, pineapple fried rice, and coconut curry soup. Everything was delicious !!! And I felt like I was back in Thailand. Gathering from the other yelp reviews, they are most famous for their boat noodles so we also got an order of that right before the kitchen closed. It's only $2.50!!!! A steal compared to other SF prices. Not to mention, our total bill was only $45 split amongst 4 people ... your wallet won't cry after visiting Zen Yai Thai. \n\nI also have to give plus points on its location - it's right next to the northern end of Polk St aka close to all the bars and perfect for some late night drunchies.

I've been going here for a while now, but unfortunately I won't be coming again anytime soon as the service is absolutely atrocious.  \n\nBeing a big fan of the floating market noodle soup after visits to Thailand, I had asked a simple question about possibly substituting noodles for rice, a very common request.  At the time, I received a pleasant \"no\" from my waitress and with no matter in mind I placed a regular order.  I didn't think much of the situation but soon after she went back to the counter and criticized me in front of her coworkers about my question.  What made it even worse was that she knew I heard her and still continued to do so.\n\nWow - Just a simple question and I get treated like this.

If you are going to try something, order these, and a pad thai or pad see ew. Order these.. And you are set for the night for a reasonable price!  You can also ask how hot you would like added in your dishes. ASK AND YOU WILL RECEIVE. \n\nIn terms of service, I always see new young servers and they always seem to be training.

My dad used to work at City Hall and would take me here when it used to be called Racha Cafe-- long before the Yelp era so that's how you know it's real lol. We even ate here on Racha's last day but thankfully they kept the same menu items that I love. Three signature Racha items that keep me coming back-- Spicy Calamari, Spicy Chicken, and Tod Mun (Thai fish cake). I can't seem to find equivalent dishes at other Thai restaurants! It's pretty cool because my dad would always order these three, and ever since the restaurant became Zen Yai, these are the only menu items that say \"Racha Cafe's style\" in the description. The flavor is the PERFECT combination of basil, jalapenos, and chili pepper. When ordering the spicy calamari, I do suggest asking for less bamboo so you don't get skimped of actual calamari. Other than that, these are must orders.\n\nMoving on, I also love the tom yum soup here because they're very generous with whatever meat or seafood you decide as well as the mushrooms. SO MUCH MUSHROOMS, I love it. The pad thai and pad se ew are also really good. Curry wise, my cousin went to Thailand and got me hooked on curries with a fruit component. Now I always get the red duck curry because the pineapples are such a delightful contrast to the richness of the curry. My mom doesn't like duck so yellow curry with potatoes is also a solid choice. Pair all these with some thai iced tea or even just their hot tea with pandan and you're in a great place.\n\nMore recently, my bf started ordering the Zen Yai Fresh rolls, papaya salad, and crab meat noodles. You just can't go wrong with this place! The fresh rolls are different because the wrapper they use is more like a large rice noodle than the usual spring roll wrappers. Papaya salad is a little on the spicy side, but it's a great healthy addition to a protein and carb heavy meal. I was also pleasantly surprised by the amount of crab in the crab meat noodles.\n\nMy favorite part about this place now that I'm older and frequently eat late-- They close at 1AM on Fridays and Saturdays and 9:30pm the rest of the days of the week.

We experienced such terrible service as they were completely understaffed. After about 10 minutes of being seated, I had to ask for the menu. Additionally, not one server asked us what we wanted to drink. Finally after about 15 minutes of sitting there twirling our fingers, we were served water. Not only did our orders take forever to come out, but the servers forgot what we had even ordered. Seriously? Get it together, please. \n\nTheir authentic Thai dishes and food from the secret menu is delicious (and cheap). Certain dishes catered to the general American population actually kind of suck. Also, I'd suggest more meat and less lettuce in the fresh summer rolls. There are always a ton of local Thai people dining here so that definitely suggests their authentic Thai menu is on point! \n\nI couldn't decide what I wanted so I ordered both the Tom Yum noodles and Boat noodles: $3.50 each!

After returning from my trip to Thailand since December, I have yet to find a place that has boat noodles. What are boat noodles? Amazing broth made of pork blood for the most part.. The flavors sit extremely well in the noodles itself. It is served with a bit of morning glory veggie, fried pork skins, and some pork meat balls. As you can tell, I ordered the pork rendition of this dish. You can also ask for it in beef. The traditional way is pork; i like tradition. ***It also comes with dried chili so make sure you ask for it without if you can't handle the heat. \n\nThe tod mun aka fish cakes are amazing here. I love that they have just the right amount of spice to it. The best part of this restaurant is really that they serve miangkham. Let me just say, get it. They only sell this to you in cash. It's in a container on top of the counter. Take all the ingredients provided and wrap them in that leaf - also provided. Eat the whole wrap with one bite and taste all the flavors that burst like a rainbow of texture, savory, salty, sweet, sour, crunchy, chewy delectables. \n\nI love this place.

It is very, very difficult to find 1) an authentic Thai place that 2) makes great boat noodles. This place ticks both boxes.

The rice noodles were just right. They even had crispy pork skin, which is just like back home.\n\nI think that the waiter service leaves a bit to be desired, as do the condiments provided (no chili vinegar? Saaad).

You can tell this is true, authentic Thai food because when you go here, most of the customers are all Thai.\n\nI tried the veggie red curry and the veggie pad see ew. The red curry had the weirdest curry taste I have ever tasted in a thai curry. It had almost no flavor, but the little flavor it had was not good at all. I definitely don't recommend this. The pad see ew was better. I liked that it came with a lot of different veggies, but I honestly couldn't taste much besides just soy sauce in the seasoning. \n\nOverall, I was not impressed and will probably not be back!

Fortunately, my server patiently described each bowl and the noodle options to me.\n.\nI tried the Tom Yom, dry/broth on the side, with fish balls, pork and liver on fine egg noodles. The contrasting flavors and textures make this one my favorite. If liver is not your thing; it sure wasn't mine, just pick it out, its liverness does not infect the whole bowl. Topped with fried chips. $3.50\n.\nThen I had the Thai boat (Yai) with wide rice noodles and beef. This was almost a soup with a very distinct flavor I cannot place, could be blood. This bowl was well spiced and topped with crunchy pork rines. $2.50\n.\nMy last little bowl was the Yen ta 4 also with wide rice noodles and very well seasoned. What a great little melody of textures here. Fungus, fish balls, tiiiny squid, jellied blood (most likely a cows) lots of herbs all topped off with some crunchy fried dough/chip of some kind. $2.50\n.\nNo beer or wine is served here.

Their gai yang (BBQ chicken) is superb. I keep thinking they got lucky with the last batch but each time the chicken is just as tender. This place is also, interestingly enough, famous for its boat noodles. I actually never had these in Thailand when I lived there so I can't say for sure but judging from the sign (that's only in Thai writing) and the constant demand on these, I'd assume these are pretty legit.

I love their boat noodles here and it seems to be my go-to restaurant whenever I'm in town, but their customer service needs to be worked on. I get that it can get busy, but come on, following up with your customers after delivering their food to the table is just as important as taking our order. We asked for four water. It arrived. We then had to asked for straws to go with them. Three straws arrived. I'm not sure where the fourth straw was at? I ordered two large boat noodles, with fat noodles and requested it spicy. But when it came, they were with regular noodles instead and of course, not spicy at all. Instead of making it a big deal, my friend and I ate it anyways but shortly informed the guy who took our order that it was with fat noodles (chow fun) that we wanted. He stated he didn't hear me request that. Ok, I get that it is busy, but the waiter should have paid more attention to our order. I had to ask for additional broth because quite honestly, the boat noodles we've received didn't look like it was a \"soup\" dish at all. Myself and three other guests enjoyed our food, but where was the waiter(s) to check up on us or to see if we needed anything else? They were too busy helping other tables. Were we not important customers too? Not sure if it was because we had kids at the table with us but their customer service was very poor to the point where I didn't want to leave any tip at all, but I did. I ended up ordering two boat noodles to go. If the waiters had checked up on our table like they should, it would had been a better experience for me eating at this Thai restaurant. So I ended up going to the front counter to order my boat noodles. I said excuse me, can I order to go please? The other guy was like \"hold just a moment ok\". Like seriously, rude alright. I may not be of Thai descent but I can understand them talking. Good thing he didn't bad mouth to the other guy about me. The other guy that was next to him ended up taking my order anyways despite the other guy telling me that. I was annoyed by now.

Well, unlucky that I tried to go to another restaurant twice, but it was untimely closed twice, but I was happy to go to Zen Yai as an alternative.\n\nThe noodle soups here are delicious, and if you order the ones off their Thai menu on the wall, you can get three different  small bowls of noodle soup for 2.50 and 3.50 each.  The first is a traditional thai boat noodle with beef or pork.  (2.50)  It's really tasty and you can adjust the spice level.  Topped with fried pork skin, this was my favorite.  A rich and hearty soup, get it with wide rice noodles.  The other two soups were also delicious.  One was a thai sweet and sour soup with fish balls and other seafood ingredients topped with deep-fried wonton skins.  (3.50)  The last was a tom-yum type sound with ground pork and bbq pork.  This was my second favorite.  (3.50).  For the price and portions, consider it a noodle soup flight.  It will fill you up, and hey at these prices, add one more if you want!\n\nThe second night we tried rice plates.  The duck over rice was really good.  Boneless breast in a sweet soy sauce like glaze.  Yum.  What really got me was the special fried catfish deluxe.  Fried catfish in a curry sauce without coconut milk. IT WAS AMAZING!  Spicy!!! SPICY!!! SPICY!!! in a good way though.  One of my new favorite dishes in the city.  The catfish was fried perfectly with a  nice crust on it. The sauce was thick and coated everything, on the drier side, preserving the crunchiness of the catfish.\n\nFor the prices and the quality of food, this is one of the best thai places in the city.

I ordered the pad thai with less oil & my brother got the thai fried rice with brown rice (he said it tasted pretty good). I love how sour the pad thai is even before I squeeze lime in it; the pad thai is on the sweet side, so if you like sweet pad thai, you'll like it here.   They give pretty good portions.  I was starving when I got there, so I ate the whole thing. But, on a normal occasion, the pad thai looked like it was enough for 1.5 meals.  \n\nIt's probably one of the cheapest places to get pad thai, along with Thai Basil in Berkeley (I haven't been there yet) and Million Thai (in SF on Taylor St.) with Groupon. It's around $8.25 (before tax). \n\nI'm giving 5 stars mainly because it's such a great deal (considering how hard it is to find cheap thai food these days in the Bay Area), the cashier was really nice, I love the ambiance & decor, the pad thai was really good & reasonably priced (though next time I'd probably ask for less sugar), they have brown rice and the portion was really filling.

First off, not many places serve it and secondly, the couple of places that do, are not up to par. The bloody broth needs to be the right thickness and saltiness--which most I've come across around here have been quite watery. I mean, I haven't been to Thailand or anything, but I've tried boat noodle from Thai town in LA and I have a good idea of what to expect. \n\nAnyway, the beau and I came across Zen Yai Thai during a food crawl one day and with their limited hours of business, we planned our day so that we were able to give them a try. Albeit the place is dingy and located in a sketchy area, but hey...they are only open during the day time anyway so don't be scurred!\n\nFor some odd reason, the menu they handed us did not include any boat noodle. We looked around on their walls and noticed that there was something written in another language (we're assuming Thai?), followed by $2.50. From reading the previous reviews we knew that the boat noodle was priced at $2.50, so we came to the conclusion that boat noodle was what was written on the wall. Lol...no clue how we were supposed to know! \n\nWith that being said, we went with two small bowls of boat noodle, which were $2.50 each; large bowls were $6.95. We also went with one small bowl of yen fa to, which is the another noodle soup that is recognized for its distinct pink colored broth. The small was pretty tiny; you can finish it in a few scoops! It was perfect for our food crawl; however, if you're having a bowl as a meal, I'd get a large. The boat noodle broth was definitely on the saltier side, but it was legit and authentic. The broth was musky in a good way, with a hint of five spice--just as it should be! The yen fa to though, was overwhelmingly vinegary. The broth is typically sweet and flowery from the soybean paste, vinegar, and fish sauce, but for some reason it was drenched with vinegar here.\n\nMost of the staff's English is broken, so there was definitely a little bit of a communication barrier. They were nice though. I'd come back for their boat noodle, if only they were open more hours!", "author": "Lien T."}

Hmmm, I popped the other half in my mouth and immediately spit it out. The texture was creamy with a STRONG fish taste. Ok, one bad shrimp, no big deal but, they were all like that and the Pad Thai / Shrimp Fried Rice emitted a strong fish smell which, it should not have.

But there was a crab claw in the rice so maybe I had gotten a piece of the shell. A few minutes later, digging around with a bit of a closer eye, I find a huge piece of egg shell. I pointed it out to my co-eating companions, and we all immediately lost our appetite and stopped eating. If something so obvious and gross happens twice in one meal, it just makes you think what else could be wrong in the lunch. Other people on the Eat24 website had made comments about egg shells in the rice, and I'm not sure why they're not more careful.

In any case, the owners seem comfortable enough in their skin to say, \"Yea I know you've had Thai food before, but this is how we like to do things.\"\n\nEnter the \"Boat Noodle\", a curiously small bowl of rice noodles in a dark broth topped with slices of meat, meatballs, pork rinds (?), spices and chilies. It's an eclectic mixture of textures and provides just enough heat to take you to the brink of perspiration. It's like an appetizer small enough to be handheld, but still makes a bold statement. The draw is that it's inexpensive, so you can also try other noodle soups too. \n\nHere's my tip: when given a choice of 1) vermicelli, 2) medium and 3) thick rice noodle, the correct answer is 2) medium. Medium thickness has just the right chewiness while balancing out the rich and spicy broth. Vermicelli is super thin and only gets drowned without a life-preserver to save it.\n\nLet's also remember that Zen Yai also makes Thai classics. The creamy Tom Kha is a rich and savory coconut soup with veggies and lemongrass that swirl to the rhythm of your ladle. This can be easily paired with white rice or consumed on its own.\n\nThe BBQ pork remind me of the Vietnamese version, generously marinaded in fish sauce, thinly cut and cooked with grill marks and a nice glisten. \n\nAdmittedly, the papaya salad was a bit plain and didn't have as much character as the other dishes. Simply, papaya and fish sauce. I wish it had more pickles and roasted peanuts to keep as company.\n\nCome because it's unique. Stay because of its warm, family-friendly atmosphere and courteous staff.", "author": "Robin H."}

Nope, I couldn't taste the blood in the sauce. Yes, they were scrumptious. Thin rice noodles with sliced pork, pork meatballs, crisp fried pork rind all sloshing around in a rich spicy broth.

Zen Yai is your stereotypical Tenderloin Asian restaurant, straddling the border of sanitary and dirty. The menu is pretty extensive and includes the usual staple Thai dishes (Pad Thai, Pad See Ew, etc).\n\nWe bought a box of Sa Koo Sai Moo ($5), which are ground pork tapioca dumplings, as an appetizer. This was not on the menu - you have to go to the counter in the back (cash only, but regular sit-down food takes card). There's an assortment of other appetizer-sized items in to-go containers here as well.\n\nThe real draw at Zen Yai is the Boat Noodles ($2.50/small, $6.95/large). They aren't on the menu, but there's a paper sign on the wall noting their existence, as well as a chalkboard entirely written in Thai with pricing that matches. The broth is made with blood, which sounds unappetizing, but it's flavored with copious amounts of Thai herbs and spices. You can choose between 4 types of noodles (flat wide, clear, egg, and another option) and beef/pork. If you don't like spicy food, make sure to ask them to tone down the spice level. This was my first time trying boat noodles, and usually Asian blood-containing dishes make me queasy, but these noodles were richly flavorful and delicious. I shared a large with my friend, which was a good amount because I think a large bowl on my own would have been overkill.\n\nWe also shared the Duck Noodle Soup ($7.95). I love Thai duck noodle soup, but the broth is usually fatty/heavy and leaves me feeling lethargic/bloated from the salt. But then Zen Yai happened - it retains the rich flavor of duck broth and juicy meat, but did not leave me regretting all my life choices. I did not drink a gallon of water when I got home, either.\n\nTo polish off the meal, I got a Thai Iced Tea ($2). Nothing too special or detracting here.\n\nZen Yai is an authentic and very reasonably-priced Thai food experience. It didn't get too busy for dinner, and the waitress was very kind and explained parts of the menu for us.

This meant it was the perfect time to try out a new delivery place. I vetoed his usual Thai place (since their prices rose substantially and they had a $3 delivery fee) and voted for Zen Yai since it came up on my Eat24 with some pretty excellent ratings and free delivery.\n\nHoh my goodness. This was definitely a good idea. The food is nice and cheap, but more importantly, it's so damn tasty. For the quantity and quality I got, I would have expected to pay $12-$15 per dish at any other Thai restaurant - but their entrees cost about $8-$10 at most. Boyfriend got the crab fried rice (extra tasty and had such yummy crab...complete with a crab leg or two as well) and I got the chicken and eggplant. We also got a side of chicken satay, because I always judge Thai places by their chicken satay.\n\nNow, the boyfriend usually harbors a great dislike for chicken satay. More often than not, it's dry, and the peanut sauce doesn't do much to help it (note: I like my chicken dry, okay. It's like having chicken jerky). Zen Yai's chicken satay actually surprised him and he said that it was probably the best chicken satay he's ever had, because it was juicy and flavorful, and the peanut sauce, while sweeter than I'm used to, somehow went along beautifully with it. Oh yes.\n\nMy chicken and eggplant over white rice was delicious as well. I didn't even mind that I had to order the rice separately, because my meal was still basically $10 and was still good for two meals.

Order off that part of the menu and it's a home run.  The curries are also great.  In fact, everything I've ordered from delivery is solid.  They say 1.5 to 2 hours for delivery but it is more like 1 to 1.5 hours and worth the wait.  \n\nLast night I went to eat there.  I had the boat noodle soup....blah.  It was a bowl of what looked like a bunch of left overs or morning after vomit.  The portion was insultingly small (half a bowl at the most and the bowl was small) and had an unremarkable flavor.  Avoid it.  I seriously can't imagine why others on here say it's good.  Total crap.  I also had one of their fish specials.  Nothing was bad about it but nothing stood out either....average.  Think a lightly fried filet with a splash of curry sauce ladled on it with a side of white rice and tired dry steamed broccoli. Why this is listed as a chef's special is beyond me.  The mango rice for desert was great!  Get it.  \n\nThe service is a little off.  Yes, they are very sweet and nice.  But, get things right.  I ordered my food and said I was very thirsty yet the waitress never brought my water.  I waited as other tables who had ordered got their drinks so I went to the counter and got it.  Beyond that, all they do is drop off the food and run off before you can say thank you and/or ask for anything else.  I also had several servers and they seemed confused.  They were not full either.  \n\nThe interior is fine...a little funky and worn as one would expect in the neighborhood.  I kind of liked that it was more authentic \"mom and pop.\"  \n\nWill I give it another try?  Yes for delivery: BBQ or curries.

It's also the reason it failed my expectations.\n\nMy bar was relatively high because Lers Ros Tenderloin makes pretty good boat noodles.  Here, I ordered the beef boat noodle soup () and a dry yen ta fo noodle (). However, the boat noodle soup was not very thick and herb-y. It was also too sweet. The meatball tasted more like it was made of pork with fillings than beef.  Yen ta fo was also just okay. Ingredients are a little wanting. No organ meat and no seafood (aside from some fishcake).\n\nI admit that it's nice that this place offers Thai dessert, snacks, tapioca dumpling (), dry sukiyaki (), etc, that are very difficult to come by in this area. It's also a plus that they offer small bowl sizes. I might come back again for those.\n\nBut for boat noodles alone, I might have given it four stars if it were located in an area that doesn't serve boat noodles.

Found free time to come by with my boyfriend after seeing a friend's instagram picture. I love to eat thai food and was pleasantly surprised that I haven't seen all there is to offer. I've never heard of boat noodles until I saw the post. \n\nParking was a breeze to find on a Saturday afternoon. We walked in and was promptly greeted and seated by the waitress. I skimmed through the menu and searched for any item that stood out to me. I sadly relied on pictures of the boat noodles on my mobile app as I ordered to make sure I was ordering the correct one. The small boat noodles ($2.50) is offered in thick or thin rice noodles. You may choose from beef or pork. I believe there's also another option. The bf and I ordered one of each plus a plate of crab fried rice ($7.95). The noodles were first to arrive. There's probably a good 5 bites worth of noodles, but definitely no more than that. A few semi meatballs and one piece of whichever meat you choose. I loved the pieces of pork rind for both orders, adds a nice crunch to the meal. The broth was interesting! In my opinion, it tasted like 5 spice seasoning with a hint of palm sugar. It was full of garlic flavor and even chili peppers. Unfortunately, I inhaled as I slurped the soup and lodged a chili pepper into my throat as I choked. Felt like my throat was disentegrating as I gasped for water and air. Even with that experience, there was no doubt in my mind that I would still finish the broth, because yes, it's that good even when your throat is on fire. The crab fried rice was also delicious. They were generous with the crabmeat. \n\nThe service was very attentive. In fact, after paying for the bill, they have dessert for take-out laid along the counter to purchase.

I always go there for the Thai Boat Noodles in beef or pork and  Yen Ta For (fermented bean soup) noodles. These are their house specialties listed on the wall written in Thai. The noodles are small bowl for $2.50 each. The serving size is the same as the ones you get in Thailand, 3 to 4 bites. I also eat 2 to 3 bowls and feel super satisfied afterwards. The broth is the winner here. The Thai Boat Noodles broth is thick, hearty, delicious and full of flavors. You can just tell it was slow stewing for a long time. \n\nThe last 2 visits I ordered a few items from their regular menu, the green papaya salad is crunchy and the lime juice is refreshing. The fish cake, sauteed Chinese mustard green with crispy BBQ pork, and Green Curry Fried Rice are on point. The Chicken Larb is the real McCoy, it is done just like the way in Thailand - mixed with toasted rice. \n\nSo far everything I tried on the Thai board menu and the regular menu are super delicious, very authentic, the price is affordable, and the service is great.

So authentic that they even serve the noodles in tiny Thai portion (that is about 3-5 mouthfuls per bowl, depending on whether you inhale or not). One story behind the small portion was that these noodles were traditionally served on rocking boats. Small portion made it harder to spill the hot soup.\n\nThat leads me to the infamous boat noodles. The ones here packs a good depth of complex flavors: savory, spicy and sour. The beef was tender, and it comes with a decent meat ball and some pork rinds. They don't seem to serve the noodles with liver (which is fine by me).\n\nI also quite like the Yentafo (which is thick rice sticks in a pink broth topped with fish balls and blood pudding I think. The pink came from preserved red beancurd \"Namyee\" or \"Nanru\"). But the Yentafo was a tad on the salty side, probably due to the Namyee.\n\nIf you want to eat like you are in Thailand, order as many bowls as you wish.

We discovered this authenic Thai place from yelp that is within a few minutes of walk from my place.  You can tell the minute you walk in that this place serves real Thai food from the Thai-based clientile. The authenticity of Thai food is assessed by the sauce and spice.  Their boat noodle at $2.50 is a must try.  It is a very small portion so if you're hungry, get two!  Their stir fry wide rice noodles are also very flavorable and plainly yummy.   \n\nThe place opens late on Friday nights and has plenty of seating.  The service is also very good.

Ended up being happily wowed by all the items ordered.  Be aware, though, that the boat noodle soups are only mentioned on a rather nondescript piece of paper taped to the wall above a table, which was the only table that was occupied in the whole restaurant when I was there, so of course i did not want to appear rude by going over and reading it while the customers are still there.  After much discussion with the friendly but English-language challenged waiter, I managed to order the pork boat noodle soup (they also have beef).  Along with that, I ordered the following:  seafood with snap peas and green beans with basil sauce, broccoli with tofu and half of barbeque chicken, entirely too much food for two, but i got carried away... I ordered them all to go.\n\nThe soup was just delicious!  There are so many interesting and tasty ingredients in the soup and the stock only has a faint reminder of its bloody origins.  The seafood dish was also full of flavors and was served with just a hint of spice, per my request (thank you Mr. Waiter!)  The broccoli was almost buttery and cooked to a perfect texture (did they really use butter with it?) and the chicken was moist and succulent.\n\nEverything was so good that we happily ate the leftovers for our dinner the next day.

Folks, there is a reason that this is one of the few Thai restaurants where Thai people eat in SF. \n\nZen Yai is the home of the famous Thai boat noodles, served in a boat-shaped bowl. The Boat noodle dishes have a hearty soup base flavored with beef blood to add thickness and flavor. Slices of beef, beef balls, been sprouts, pork rind chips, and green vegetables (morning glory or Chinese gai lan, depending on season) are added to this delish broth. Lastly, pick your pleasure when it comes to the type of noodle you desire, and order either with soup or dry noodle. I prefer the cellophane if I order with broth, and flat (hand-made square) if I order dry noodle. \n\nThe dry version with flat noodle is my favorite. You can order with or without prik (chili pepper). I prefer to order without then add back using the condiments for personal taste. \n\nAnother cool aspect of this place is that you can order Thailand-sized portions (small bowl) or a larger bowl. \n\n5-Stars for the Boat Noodles !!!", "author": "Gregory C."}

The poor delivery kid must have heard me because he didn't waste any time running away after handing over the bags of food.\n\nThen there is the product they are selling. The curry had wilted something in it. The spicy chicken was gristle and chunks of jalapeno that all turned into a jellied brick in the fridge. The fresh rolls were not bad, but they weren't really good either. That and they weren't rolls. They were rolled up then each had several slices thru it causing them to all be an open pile of filling. The brown rice, well, ya can't fuck up brown rice.

We even invited our good friend and her son to come along.\n\nWith my wife being Thai and I love Thai food so much, we checked out Yelp and found good ratings on Zen Yai Thai Restaurant as close by to Japantown.  Many Yelpers mentioned about how good this place is and how cheap the prices are, so we decided to give it a try.  Upon arriving, we found the place opened, but not a single customer inside.  This wasn't a good sign, but we were starving and we still had hope that the majority of the Yelpers about this place are right.\n\nWe ordered two special $2.50 Thai noodle bowls (I had the yen tha fo), sauteed mixed veggies called Pad Pak Ruam Mit, sauteed seafood eggplant, deep fried chicken, and mus-sa mun curry chicken with steamed rice.  My wife thought the seafood eggplant was the only thing quite good, and I thought the mus-sa mun curry chicken was the one instead.  The mixed veggies and fried chicken were just plain average and the only thing special about the $2.50 Thai noodle bowls was the low price itself.  The drinking water they served had no ice (not even in the refiling pitcher), so it was room temperature and tasted like unfiltered tap water.  As for the prices (other than the special $2.50 noodle bowls), they are average at $8-$10 per plate like many other Thai restaurants we have been to in the Bay Area, so this place doesn't quite constitutes in my opinion to be cheap...nor would I say it is expensive either.  We didn't order any beverages (just water) and our bill at the end came out to be almost $60 after tax but before tip.\n\nMy wife and I have tried as many Thai restaurants as we possibly can, including the 7 different times I have traveled to Thailand before, and we find Zen Yai Thai Restaurant to be mediocre; just plain average.

The pad thai had some good flavor and comes with chicken and shrimp.  The pumpkin curry had large chunks of pumpkin and a good mix of vegetables.  And the Thai style BBQ pork-delicious! The pork had a little of fatty/grisly spots, but I those were easy to eat around.  The marinade had good flavor and the meat was cooked to perfection.  \n\nGood prices and quick delivery will keep me ordering from this restaurant again! :)", "author": "Nita K."}

I asked for a tiny amount of peanut sauce to-go and the lady says \"you pay extra\" I'm soo okay with that so the guy boosts my bill +2.50 more and I'm like 2.50 more? Yes sir apparently they were gonna give me enough peanut sauce in a container for at least 4 people even though all I ordered was a combo B which was just for me. I obviously declined the sauce.\nThe combo B was ok. The yellow chicken curry had a couple bits of chicken and they of course added a huge piece of potatoe. The curry itself was bland and no spice. The pad thai needed much more hot sauce. These are small gripes that I shouldnt have to worry about. I have a strong feeling if I'd eaten inside I would get much better service and more flavorful food.", "author": "Andrew Z."}

The pumpkin curry was really good and there was plenty of pumpkin and meat. I enjoyed the duck breast more because I really like duck. I also had to order a lot of rice (coconut rice!) because I eat a lot of rice.\n\nAll in all, even though I've only been here once, I would definitely come back again.

Everything on the menu was very affordable, easy on the wallet. The atmosphere is your typical asian restaurant, don't expect anything fancy but ohhmmmmgeee the food is over the top very authentic. I had the Kway Tiao Lua aka Thai boat noodle soup. Being from Dallas, no Thai restaurants serve this at all (boooo). This beef noodle soup is very very flavorful, less broth almost somewhat gravy like, it's topped with fried garlic, shallots, chili oil and pork rinds. Delish! I had two bowls, i love how they come in small sizes for only $2.50 a bowl. Therefore you can order different soups like yen tafo. Of course I had to try the Chicken Lard Na, the chef really made this with love. The best Lard Na I've had! The flat noodles are lightly pan fried to give it a slight crispiness with a garlicky flavor, gravy over broccoli, noodles and served super hot & fresh. I had a few more dishes but those two knocked my socks off =). don't forget to try a bottle of their palm nectar juice, it's very refreshing, light, tastes like soft honey.

I miss my little Thai friend back home, but Zen Yai Thai is like a gift from the food Gods. \nAs I told my new Australian friend, I am always inclined to visit any place that has the trademark red Yelp sticker in the window and that's what drew me to this place when the beautiful Aussie bloke offered to buy dinner on his last night in the city... not even Thai can fully ease the sad stomach of that kind of loss but it definitely didn't hurt. \nWe got the Rad Na and ...oh I forget the other dish names at the moment but there was soup and a vege-meaty dish....SOOO good. I saved the yummy soup for the next day as we had plenty of food with the other two dishes and being sick lately, my stomach is a little smaller than usual. I think the soup was Tom Kah....but I can't say for sure. I will find out!\n\nI love that I live only a block away from this place and I think they deliver as well! \n\nThe food came out fairly quickly and seemed to be very fresh.

I get Combo #2 - Pad thai (with big shrimps and flavorful tofu), chicken curry w/ potatoes (creamy and mild) rice, salad and fried chicken roll. FOR $6.25. Great atmosphere once you're inside but the restaurant can be easy to miss if you don't know where to find it.", "author": "Jessica M."}

Their specialty imo was their \"spicy chicken\" which was minced and full of crazy flavor! Although Zen Yai saved that recipe, the other dishes we had , the curry stuffed chicken wings and the roast duck were just so so. The curry sauce was good but the wings were just ok.", "author": "Steve K."}

I have been there several times and the service is always top notch. Ray and Nuch are very pleasant and professional! The price is I think for the quantity and quality of food is well worth it! The crab cake appitizers are first, then I dig into the curry chicken, papaya salad, pad thai and bbq pork. Too many things for us to eat, so I usually stick with the usually winners. Then top it off with the tai iced tea. The parking is right on the street and usually get parking right out front.", "author": "Michael C."}

I came here for lunch and while it was moderately busy, the staff and fluid service put everyone at ease.  Had the vegitarian kabocha squash curry - came with button mushrooms, zucchini, and other good things all in a smooth creamy broth.  Yum!  Easily one of my favorite kabocha dishes. One drawback is that the menu seemed a little focused on fried food. Also tried the chicken with basil and lemongrass for a reasonable price - very lemongrassy, which I loved, but also a little oily for my taste.  Fried bananas with coconut ice cream were heavenly - the ice cream was made with coconut milk, coconut shavings, and shards of little crunchy things (nuts?) that gave a nice pop when you bit into them.   You can also order online from them if you live in San Francisco and want to pick up food to go.  Restraunt.com offers discount cupons to the place.", "author": "Sam A."}

I was pleasantly surprised that this place was GOOD...like really really GOOD. We ordered two different soups, the coconut and the tom yum, both were full of flavor and very delicious. For entrees we shared, family style, and ordered the spare ribs (crispy and tasty!), the squid curry with bamboo shoots (the bamboo was stinky but in a good way), the pad kee mao (think thai version of chow fun), the pineapple fried rice (my favorite dish!) and duck. The portions were pretty big and we had leftovers. For dessert we had both the fried bananas with ice cream and mango with sticky rice. The best part was the bill...only $63 bucks for the 6 of us! It's a steal and the quality of the food is there. My dad apparently goes to this restaurant for lunch all the time and in fact, he went there for lunch yesterday and brought us for dinner. I think that says a lot about this restaurant. The only downfall is that there are three homeless bums outside and it stinks REALLY bad. It will probably ruin your appetite. So hold your breath and run to the door!", "author": "Vanessa T."}

Other dishes tried were pad thai, some type of green curry seafood thing, and a rice dish. Everyone realy enjoyed their food. A lot of the dishes (including mine) come with a salad which was very tasty. The thai iced tea was good, but not great, but then again it was only $1.50 so what can you expect. Overall, everything was really cheap, mostly under $10. I fully reccomend coming here.", "author": "Merredith L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-16", "description": "Have been here for lunch a handful of times now and I think this place offers good value and service, great food and consistency.  Used to go when it was Racha Cafe and it's just as good to me now that it's Zen Yai (although it went through a period in-between where I understand it was not good), and not at all crowded if you go early which is what I do.  It seems to fill up after noontime.  I love their combo. lunch special #2 for $6.95.  You get an unbelievable amount of food and it's all good and very filling.  You get an egg roll, small salad, lots of rice, a bowl of mild chicken curry (potatoes & dark meat, no bones) and a very generous portion of shrimp & tofu pad thai.  There are two other combos with shrimp & broccoli or spicy chicken in place of the pad thai.  Everything I've seen others order looks really good and very generous portions.  The spicy calamari w/bamboo shoots, as well as other dishes, are holdovers from the former Racha Cafe and is delicious.  The seafood clay pot is also recommended.", "author": "Mimi L."}
