We don't live anywhere near downtown SF so it's a bit of drive for us.  But, it was well worth the effort.\n\nWe started with a complimentary amuse-bouche (appetizer) of Speck (smoked Prosciutto) on toast with grape tomato and pea puree.  Then we ordered and shared an appetizer of Ginger Crispy Chicken Lollipops on a bed of Napa Slaw.  I had the special Risotto with Duck Confit & Italian Sausage.  My wife had Chinese Five Spice Short Ribs.\n\nWe had two glasses of J. Loher 2008 Merlot.  It was an outstanding pairing with the short ribs!  We finished with a fresh fruit short cake and coffee.\n\nWe had excellent service by Jason.\n\nWe would go back if we're in The City near the downtown area.\n\nThe food and service were outstanding and they feature organic and sustainable, local, food ingredients.\n\nThey're located in the Orchid Hotel, the most Eco-friendly hotel in SF.", "author": "James Q."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-09-19", "description": "Unilaterally not worth the price. Over $20 for breakfast which amounted to runny scrambled eggs and poor service. My heart goes out to the waitress, who staffs a room that looks like it seats fifty people, alone. She is the cashier, the waitress, and she busses the tables. So, if you were hoping for a refill on your drink, forget it. I was seated in a row of tables, three of which no longer had anyone at them and they needed to be bussed. \n\nAlso, there is a language barrier issue. Since the restaurant only serves breakfast, as long as you stick to ordering one of the ten available selections, there's no issue. But, if you want the check split or combined, you'll have a problem. \n\nWith breakfast selections widely available elsewhere, and for cheaper, this place is a definite skip.", "author": "Kathryne B."}

Just enough of the tangy dressing, well balanced. My friend who ordered this loved it. I think it could have used more components to have a greater variety of textures and flavors\n\n* Orchard Kobe Burger \n(Havarti Cheese, Spicy Aioli, House Made Pickles & Fries - $15)\n- 4 stars\nThe patty was fantastic. I said medium rare, on the rare side, and I got exactly that. It was juicy and tender, and the melted cheese on top was fantastic. The only downside is the bun, which was really quite dry. Fries were thin, and they were pretty good.\n\n* Organic English Pea  Risotto \n(Roasted Beets, Fennel & Parmigiano-Reggiano - $19)\n- 3 stars\nThe risotto had a great creamy texture and wonderful flavor. The beets were just awkward because there were about 5 GIANT chunks surrounding the risotto. It could have been chopped smaller and actually cooked into the risotto so we didn't have to break off chunks with our forks and manually add some to each bite.\n\n* Pizza of the Day  \n(Artichoke & sausage - $12)\n- 2 stars\nThis didn't stand out much. The crust seemed too hard and stale, and there wasn't enough tomato sauce so there wasn't something to counter the cheese & other toppings.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

The dungeness crab mac n cheese was the sole bright spot as there was quite a bit of crab meat in the average sized plate.  Our waiter, who was a top notch server, recommended the crab mac n cheese as their best entree, especially over the lingcod which he admitted was a bit \"flaky\" for the recent fish order they received.  \n\nOur other entree was quite disappointing which was a Tripolini Bolognese.  The dish included handmade pasta but considering that the handmade pasta was barely able to wrap around more than a few forkfuls, it was hard to justify the $17 price tag.  I also forgot to add that it was barely cooked and still has that raw pasta aftertaste.\n\nI did like the decor which features roots (to go with the restaurant theme) coming out of the wall and also some neat snake holders for the lamp lights.", "author": "Albie F."}

The menu online isn't as accurate as the menus they had for us, so you can take a glance at what they have, but the actual one have a little more.  The menu doesn't  offer much options and it's very simple.  But everything is organic so that's balance things out.  \nI ordered the Roots burger and my friend ordered the Tortellini which came out to be $33 bucks...not enough for the certificate!!! \n\nBUT!! Our server was super nice enough that she said it was fine, and took our orders in...mind you that I always gotten the \"look\" when I come in with some type of coupon, but she was totally nice about it and gave me absolutely great service!\n\nWe were offered poppy-seed bread which was slightly toasted and oil with black pepper...the bread is slightly sweet which was unexpected but was good and warm, so you know its fresh.  Also, nice brown toast marks =).\n\nMy burger came and the presentation was nice, i wanted medium well which came out to what I want, however, just a bit dry.  I asked for no tomatoes but it came with it anyways, which wasn't a big deal because I could take it off, but the server saw it and she immediately apologized without me mentioning to her about it, and she seem genuinely sorry about it.  The bun for the burger might be the same as our bread and oil, so it made the burger slightly sweet but it was really good.  The flavor from the cheese and the spicy pickles really blends well with the bun.  The fries were a little salty for my taste, but it was good and crunchy, not soggy and they are not stingy on the fries either!\n\nMy friend's order however, was a little disappointing.  Her tortellini arrived with very lightly sauces, but they were full and stuffed with crab as said, however, she said it was very sweet - that the sauce and the pasta case were sweet which made it difficult to eat.  I didn't tried so I can't comment much on it =T.\n\nThe decor for this place is very nice and quiet, very calming.  Our server dimmed the lights to match according to the setting, which was nice.  A very small place however, and not a typical restaurant where there's a door to let you know its there.  My silverware and plates were clean and nicely placed.  Our linen for the table were also clean (i know, i just had to add this in case people needed to know!!)

Our server was very gracious and offered good suggestions.  She even gave us 2 desserts and one appetizer on the house because of their anniversary.\n\nAs for the food, I enjoyed my parents' dishes.  They order the salmon and spare ribs.  The spare ribs were very tender and easy to slice through with just a fork.  I ordered their kobe beef burger, which I thought was only average tasting.  It tasted similar to a Fuddrucker's kobe beef burger.\n\nFor dessert, we had an apple cobbler with vanilla ice cream and a pot du creme.  Although the cobbler was waaay too sweet, I enjoyed the crispyness of the apple slices.  It probably needed more dough-y/crust taste too.  The pot-du-creme was also too sweet.  Both desserts were lacking in presentation.\n\nAll in all, for someone like my mom who is currently going through chemo, I would come back for their organic foods.

I enjoyed my five-spice braised short ribs, but my wife's pea risotto was below-average.  The risotto was cooked about right, but the dish was severely lacking in flavor.  We NEVER add salt to our food, and we had to do it on a couple of occasions to finish the risotto.  The peas were ok, but didn't add much to the dish.  A little cheese or something like that may have helped.  The dessert, a chocolate / butterscotch pot de creme was tasty, but the texture between the two layers was a bit off -- the bottom layer was too soft, almost flan-like.  \n\nI would probably give the food 3 stars, but I have to deduct a star because the waiter we had was very weird.  He was nice, but said a few things that had us thinking \"WTF?!?\"  He also didn't really tell us much about the dishes when he brought them (including not describing the charcuterie plate, and not telling us about the kind of red wine we were getting).  \n\nWith the voucher, the meal was a good deal, but I don't know if I'll be going back anytime soon.", "author": "Pilan C."}

It's got the white table cloths and the stuffy decor, but it has no idea what it is doing.\n\nWhy would you serve deliciously warm bread with cold, hard, mismatched packets of butter?  Why would you serve seared scallops in a bowl of broth, and furthermore, not give the diner a spoon or any bread to soak it up with?  The whole evening featured incongruities like these. \n\nAnd then it became hilarious.  The waiter accidentally spilled the (aforementioned why-does-it-even-exist) broth all over our table, which prompted him to exclaim, \"Oh shit!!\"  Oops.  After cleaning it up, he goes into the kitchen (which we were seated near) and, still within earshot, says, \"You will NOT believe what I just did...\"  Facepalm.\n\nTo make up for this, he gives us a free dessert.  Whoever plated the dessert was trying so hard to be artistic and sophisticated, but the dessert itself looked and tasted like Jell-o chocolate pudding.\n\nAs with the Top Chef contestants, there is potential here.  The scallops were very well-seasoned.  The smoked trout salad was almost great, but had weird proportions and sizes of ingredients.  Conceptually, I could almost see what they were trying to do.  But the execution was totally lacking.  If the meal had been any more expensive than it was, I probably would have been upset.  But as it was, it was just an unexpectedly amusing dining experience I hope not to repeat again.", "author": "Leslie L."}

UHhhhh I'm still dreaming about the dinner bread a year later. Nice crispy crust, but fluffy and airy on the inside. The bread pudding was made from had croissants left over from the day before, so the chef decided to make bread pudding... God bless him! \n\nI don't remember much of the entrees themselves, lemony risotto and a fish dish (which i remember was a tad too salty.

I've been twice now; both times with a friend who lives nearby and loves the place.\n\nSo, the food itself is good. Nice variety of dishes, if not a bit limited.\n\nIt's very bright inside. My friend loves this; I don't. For some reason, it brings back memories of late-night dining at Perkin's in high school. \n\nIt's a bit overpriced, IMO. Only one glass of white wine under $10; and cocktails are $12. Sure, it's a hotel in Union Square, so maybe that's the norm, but for someone who typically dines in Mission/Hayes/Tendernob/SoMa, drink prices (food also) seems a bit steep.\n\nService is slow at times; but friendly. I think we caught it on a particularly busy night. One server (who didn't have our table initially) ended up being particularly friendly (in a good way), to the point our group invited him out for drinks later. \n\nI'm giving it 2.5 stars for the overall experience, rounding up because we received a free caesar salad which was accidentally prepared as an extra. gracias! =)\n\nSo what could be done to make it better? Dim the lights, add some music for ambiance (so I don't have to hear the conversations from every other table in the place), lower the prices a bit, keep the food as is. And maybe play up the green-ness of the hotel/building, I had no idea, but other reviews are mentioning it.", "author": "Daniel P."}

It started out fine, we ordered promptly, the munu was prix fixe, which we knew going in. there was a choice of soup or salad, a choice of 2 entrees, assorted side dishes and a choice of desserts. None of us chose the wine pairings. We ordered two of the tamale pies and three of the turkey dinners. We were told that the tamale pies did not come with the side dishes no matter how it looked on the menu, fine. \n\nThe soup and salad were quite tasty, but it went downhill from there.  The tamale pies were inedible, the adult and child both took only one bite of theirs before determining that. The waitress never came to the table to ask us how our meals were the entire time we were eating, in fact when she cleared the plates it was obvious that  not more than one bite was taken from either of the tamale pies but she cleared them with no comments. \n\nThree of us had the turkey dinner which was mediocre at best, the turkey breast appeared to be from a boneless a rolled breast because I really am not familiar with any part of the bird shaped like what I was served.  I swear I got 6 green beans and about 4 cranberries.  Then our dessert was served, which was very good, a creme brulee and a bread pudding. \n\nFinally when the waitress brought the check she asked how everything was, which was when we told her of our dissappointment.. I was a little more than perturbed because this dinner was not cheap and we were talking about stopping someplace on the way home to get something for the two who did not eat. \n\nWe asked to see the menu again and pointed out that it appeared that the side dishes were to be served with both entrees and the two with the tamale pies were finally served them, which seemed to satisfy their hunger finally. \n\nWe were offered no apologies, no adjustment on the bill, nothing. All I got out of the experience was a good restaurant horror story to tell my friends back in Florida.", "author": "Gail P."}

My vegetarian friend had to learn the hard way that they put diced up little anchovies in the olive dipping spread. Not only did they have hidden anchovies, but a hidden menu. Apparently, they think that customers like to be surprised when their food arrives. I don't know about you, but I like to know what I'm getting, and when my chicken sandwich was brought out dripping with mayo, and yes the anchovies, I was not happy.

Some places I go to saw fresh or organic or something that is clearly a lie upon being served, as I know that lemons are not pink. There lemonade was fresh, organic, YELLOW, and everything that makes a lemonade wonderful.\n\nThe first course was macaroni and cheese with crab, which was wonderful.

If you read more of my reviews, I eat a lot.\n\nBy the time the second course arrived, the sirloin strip sandwich and a side of parmesan and truffle sprinkled french fries, we were both full. I ate some french fries, but we mutually decided to take our sandwich to go. After trying only a bite, I could tell it was wonderful.

It was kind of embarrassing to show up and be the third table there.\n\nTo the servers' credits, we were seated immediately (one could only hope) - but in the darkest corner of this hotel lobby, behind a wall. Benefit of the doubt tells me they really wanted to give me and my late party some privacy. That or they didn't want anyone to see me in my hooded sweatshirt and jeans. Damn it, I was wearing decent shoes.\n\nThe real reason why I came here was because I had a gift certificate. Our waitress insisted it was called a coupon. Now that we were deemed cheap, we felt the need to redeem ourselves with some cocktails. The lady had an interesting blend of vodka and Odwalla (what?) and I said, why not, and went for the XOChocolatini or whatever it was called (shut up). I'm really not sure what you're supposed to pair that one up with. The whole cocktail menu was just bizarre.\n\nThe best way to class up some french fries, other than the requisite Kraft parmesan, is to drizzle it with truffle oil. We fell for it, naturally.\n\nI wasn't sure what I wanted, so I asked if I should go for the scallop/mussel dish or the lamb. She said she'd surprise me (and after that drink, I couldn't have cared less). The scallops arrived, as did the tamale pie with Mexican truffles, the crab mac and cheese, and the smoked trout salad. It really looked great when it arrived.\n\nUnfortunately, the tastes were a little disappointing. There were but a few slivers of trout in the salad (around 2), the mac and cheese was nothing really to write home about (especially at $13), and the tamale pie was apparently full of rich flavors that clashed into blandness. Our waitress insisted you didn't need to be a vegetarian to enjoy this wonderful dish, but the vegetarian at our table found it hard to swallow.\n\nThe scallops and mussels had a lot of flavor to them, but I swear the cook dropped a can of Morton's in there. I'm sure the little girl with the umbrella was screaming GET ME OUT OF HERE, and all I could wonder was if it was iodine free or not. The chocolate cocktail turned out to be a blessing in disguise.\n\nAnd the decor? Beige, beige, beige, that was the color of everything. I think everything just blended into each other. I understand the organic, earthy inspiration behind it but... The greatest distraction was the green Exit sign to the bathroom (which is spotless, by the way, but be forewarned that the men's lock doesn't work very well. I just didn't bother to lock it. Heyyyy.).\n\nNone of us were in the mood for dessert. For $100, we were hoping for a little something more.

We were the third table at the restaurant, after the other two tables were either being served or finishing their meal.  There is no excuse for slow service especially when there is no one at the restaurant!  Our waiter took a while to refill our waters and my beverage.

Even though he had been heading over in our direction, he decided to clear the other table first.\n\nAdditionally, the food didn't turn out as I had expected.  The fries were good for the first few--then they became overly parmesan cheesey.  Two of us ordered the flat iron steak sandwich which came with a mini arugula greens mixture.  This was ridiculously salty.  Another person specifically requested no mayonnaise on her sandwich and the waiter said he could accommodate this, but her sandwich still came out with mayo.\n\nThe only good thing was that we had a $25 restaurant.com certificate to apply to our bill which made the meal quite cheaper.  I will also say that the manager did a good job to make sure we had everything we needed and also cleared the table quickly.

I had come armed with a  Restaurants.com $25 cerficate.  Being hungry after a big 20 mile bike ride, we opted for an early dinner.  We were the only ones in the restaurant at 6:30 pm, but they told us that we could start with the happy hour deal (as enumerated by the many other Yelp reveiws).\n\nAs soon as we took our seats, the restaurant started filling up.  The bar was crowded with a group of Europeans opening bottle after bottle of champagne.  Eventually, there were 8 tables seated in the dining area.  iThis is much different than what was expected based upon the reviews.  \n\nMenu was extremely limited - half dozen appetizer options, five entrees, three desserts.  I'm not surprised since it seems that no one really eats here- would be a waste to have more food than necessary.  We had the truffle french fries, arugula with strawberry salad, asparagus risotto, and the diver scallops with PEI mussels.\n\nThere was a giant pork chop that others ordered that looked delicious.\n\nOur food came out promptly and was very good.  I had a mussel or two that tasted \"odd\", but they were plump and not over cooked.  The scallops were large and perfectly seared.  The risotta was creamy and flavorful.\n\nOur bill was a deal-2 free apps with 3 drinks during HH + coupon  + tax + ttip all for less than $75.  Not bad for a beautiful setting and attentive staff.\n\nTo address the slow kitchen complaints:  I did see the entrees for the couple who was seated shortly after us arrive as we signed our check.   \nEveryone else seemed to get prompt delivery.\n\nWill I be back the next time I come to S.F?  Maybe.", "author": "E T."}

I went here with a group of 6 people who were ready for some good food and fun.\n\nThe ambiance here is neither fun, nor sexy. It's more romantic, but even then I would have to recommend other places. The decor is white and a bit sterile, but not in the 2002 minimalist way. It's more of a classier Miami Vice. The lighting isn't quite right either. There is a bar in the front, but I didn't actually go to it or order a drink.\n\nWhat we ate: Parmesan fries - these were delicious! Wild Mushroom Risotto - somehow this didn't work for me and I usually love risotto. The short ribs ragout more sweet than savory so didn't work well either. My friend had an undercooked steak. sent back to be cooked a bit longer.\n\nFor a Sat night, there was only one other table with patrons from 7-9. I'm not sure who I find this place suitable for. It also turned out that the chef was actually our waiter. Something tells me this place is going to be replaced and with good reason.", "author": "Neelima D."}

We arrived at prime time, and found only one other couple there, just finishing their dinner.   That was scary, but we stayed anyway as we were hungry and were encouraged by some of the reviews on Yelp.   \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised (even when no one else arrived the whole time we were there).   My Chinese Short Ribs dish was excellent, my wife combined the Ginger Chicken Lollipops appetizer with a Daikon Romaine salad and loved both.   A very tasty Chocolate/Butterscotch Pot de Creme dessert topped it off.\n\nOur server, Jason, was quite friendly and we chatted quite a bit (as he was obviously not very busy).    Apparently, the owners do not market or publicize the restaurant at all anymore.   We don't understand their 'strategy', as the food here was quite tasty.   Some of the decor choices were odd, but we had a good laugh about that and we were there to eat anyway.\n\nWorth giving a try!", "author": "Bodhi S."}

I went there with my bf and friend and was excited about this organic foodie experience.  For starters we had the arugula and goat cheese salad, pretty standard, nothing to rave about.  The crab mac and cheese was rich and generous portion, very good but you have to share to have room for entrees.  although now I think that was a bad idea since the entrees were downright horrible.\n\nMy friend ordered the flatiron steak medium rare, my bf and I ordered the scallops with mussels.  The steak came out medium and overly salted.  The scallops were so salty thats all I tasted, it was like if it was dipped in salt, seared and dipped in salt again.   We sent our entrees back and ordered the panfried sole with roasted red pepper and my friend got the mushroom risotto.  The sole came out tasteless and very greasy, it was also 2 very small filets both could have fit on my palm easily.  I took one bite and just couldn't allow myself to eat something so greasy and disgusting.  The risotto my friend had was watery and bland, I tried it and it tasted more like porridge with large chewy vegetable leaves that were hard to swallow.  The bill came to be $85 and I must say it was the most unsatisfactory $85 we've ever spend.  I apologized profusely to my friend for inviting him to try such a tasteless dinner.  We will not be back!", "author": "Yue L."}

Innovative food prepared with the freshest ingredients. Most memorable dishes were the Japanese Caesar salad w/black sesame seeds and the short ribs w/polenta. The only thing that stopped me from giving 5 stars is that the atmosphere could stand some improvement. It's hard to forget that you're pretty much dining in the midst of a hotel lobby.", "author": "Marci A."}

We decided to try happy hour since it isn't far from my work.  We got there at six and I was shocked to see maybe 4 people there. We told the bartender that we were there for happy hour and then he said he could put a few tables together for us...then he went behind the bar and we stood around thinking he would eventually put the tables together. Then we talked to the server about being seated so she put the tables together and then pulled out the dinner menus for us. \n\nSince we were there because of Dine About Town, we asked to see that menu too. She brought out more menus. Since we were there for happy hour, we asked about that too..pretty soon there were 15 paper menus on our table plus one paper wine menu for the five of us. We read on Yelp earlier that you can order a free appetizer with the purchase of a cocktail so we did that. The fries with truffle oil were amazing. Two of the guys with us were doing a \"Biggest Loser\" competition at work so they had to show restraint...more for us girls! Also, the shrimp and grits were really good, loaded with butter, but we tried not to think about that. The cocktails were good too.\n\nThe service was extremely slow, especially noticeable because there were not many patrons there with us, but to be fair there was only the bartender and the server. A busser came in around 7 to help out but it did not speed things up by much. The server thought we had come for dinner, hence all the menus, so she felt a bit duped (and didn't hide it well) when we told her we came for happy hour. But seriously, if you share the free appetizers and have one drink, there is enough for a good meal.\n\nOverall I had a good time. I will be going back, but also will be making it clear to the server that I'm there for the happy hour specials only.", "author": "Lindsay B."}

The \"small\" cheese platter is delicious and larger than you think, would suffice for a party of 2 to 4, depending on how much you love cheese.  For my gf and me, there was extra to bring home, and we love cheese.  If ordering individually from the cheese menu, I recommend the Truffle Tremor goat cheese from Arcata.  The smoked trout starter on endives, with a smooth horseradish sauce, and apples tossed in, is light, crispy, and tasty without being too fishy.  The wild mushroom tamale pie gets creativity points to be sure, and very symbolic of California cultures: they get their wild mushrooms from post-hippie mushroom hunters, ladle them with a Mexican tamale sauce, other vegetables, and it arrives with a cornmeal lattice baked on top.  \n\nThe waiter we had was exceptionally personable and attentive but not interrupting.  Could not have asked for better service and I hope she knows it.  \n\nThe ambiance is the only aspect that misses 5 stars. It is a hotel restaurant, though the fountain in the lobby is beautiful.  The restaurant was literally empty when I arrived at 7:30pm on a Friday night, and only a few parties arrived thereafter.  So, if you are looking for a quiet place, where you are sure to get personal attention and cuisine made to order, I highly recommend it.  \n\nP.S. Pricey, but you can get a good discount at www.restaurant.com", "author": "Sierra M."}

We went here on a Friday night because of a $50 certificate from Restaurant.com.  The service was fine but the food was not.\n\nWe order the mac-n-cheese which was their signature apertizer but heck where was the cheese?!!!! It was dry and tasteless.  The menu for entre was limited to only 4 options so there wasn't that much to begin in. Everything was salty, from the pork chop to the scallops to the vegertarian dish.\n\nThe place was EMPTY! It could be because people never come back!\n\nThroughout dinner, this short manager kept on interupting us.  Granted that he's accomodating but every freeking 15 minutes, come on!  I was with a group of gfs and we were talking about engagement rings and he rudely interupted our conversation and asked all these personal questions about the ring..wtf? \n\nThe bill still came out pretty hefty with the $50 certificate.  We were pretty upset because the food was just not worth the $ that we paid.", "author": "TU B."}

We went because we had a gift certificate, and I was excited to try all organic food. But, the food wasn't all that great. It was kind of boring and bland. There weren't many people there, yet the waitress still took forever to notice when we needed something. If the restaurant were at least a good value, that may have helped, but I thought it was expensive for the quality of food they put out.\n\nI would not go back to this place. When there are so many great restaurants in the city, this place just does not measure up. I do have to say that the wine I ordered (Sav Blanc, I think) was delicious, and the bartender (slash host?) was awesome. He seated us, kept our water full, cleared our plates, etc, and was so nice. I would say the bartender was the best part of that meal, and is the only reason I gave Roots 3 stars instead of 2. But overall, it just didn't do it for me.", "author": "Bridgette A."}

No approach. The server came to both tables on either side of us a couple times and never once acknowledged our presence. I finally got up and went back to the hostess stand to ask for a server (and a manger).  Ok, you're busy. I get it but at least say something or glance our way.  The manager never came.  We asked for a wheat beer and the waitress gave us a dark barley beer.  Then she proceeded to argue with us until my friend googled the beer to prove her wrong.  She still didn't replace it with a wheat beer.  Ok, fine.  We ordered the frites and the ginger chicken to start with.  Both were bad.  The chicken were fancified bone on chicken wings and no flavor (really greasy too).  The waitress came by and told us that our Kobe Burger was almost ready, and then we proceeded to wait for an additional 25 minutes until it came to our table.  It sucked.  Bill came, again we asked for the manager and the waitress informed us that he had already left.  On the way out we overhead the other waitress apologizing to another table for their poor service and subpar meal.  BAD.", "author": "Meg S."}

Prices are a little more expensive than what is indicated in the hotel room guide, but the food is still a great value for the price. i just wish they didn't tack on a $5 delivery charge on top of the 20% service charge.\n\nI don't usually order room service, but we were really tired and didn't want to go out. I was expecting the worst, but was delighted when we got some really yummy food. Delivery took 20 minutes, which is what the person on the phone had predicted.\n\nWe ordered a chicken sandwich, farmers market soup on a weeknight (that day it was mushroom soup) that came with the best oil and herb dip I have ever tasted in my life (seriously, I wanted to take a straw and slurp it up. oh, is that gross to do that?).\n\nThe portion sizes were just right, and the food was excellent. It was a great value, especially considering the food is organic and fresh.\n\nI will rate everything on a 5-point scale:\nMushroom soup = 3/5 ; had croutons in it and the soup was way too salty for my taste; however, it would probably be ok with some people\nChicken sandwich = 4/5 ; served with pickle and organic salad. the sandwich was above average and the salad was very fresh. however, i didn't care too much for the dressing. it was too vinaigretty.\nHumboldt Fog Goat cheese = 3/5 ; served with green grapes, filbert nuts, and crostini\nBread (served with oil and herb dip) = 5/5 ; delicious!!! the dip was FANTASTIC, the best i've ever had, and the bread was very soft and fresh.", "author": "Wendy L."}

Meat was fatty and drowned in lentil guck. Forgot to mention we started with a trout appetizer that was decent to say the least. We also ended the meal with a bread pudding dessert that was also good. High priced menu that isn't worth the price.\n\nMy suggestion.......if you're looking for a place to have some drinks and receive good service, this place will give you that.

You must order the fries that are dusted with parmesan and fried in truffle oil... soo soo good.\n\nI give this place 3 stars because the service is slow.

The roof deck is a nice place to unwind because it's not crazy and scene-y and absolutely perfect for relaxing and soaking up the last few hours of sunshine (gotta love daylight savings!).  \n\nThe unfortunate thing is that there is no bar/waitstaff on the roof.  (The bar downstairs is pretty small so I wouldn't really recommend downstairs for happy hour, wait for a sunny day and do the roof.)  You have to order your drinks downstairs at the bar.  They will happily bring stuff up to you on the roof so you can catch the waiter/bartender when he does the delivery, but it's not very frequent.

Apparently the owner of this restaurant instills their waitstaff with not only a slightly different view of things (ie: \"argue with your customer to excuse your short-comings\"), but also apparently just doesn't train them overall at all.\n\nMy wife and I went there with my brother-in-law and his girlfriend.  I'm usually a bit wary of eating at a hotel restaurant but my brother had some sort of coupon that gives you 1/2 off a $100 tab (or something of that sort), so we figured, a good deal overall and Roots was one of the only qualifying restaurants that looked good.\n\nLong story a bit short(er), I've forgotten all the things that bothered me about our experience there were so many issues.  A few off the top of my head:\n1) service was PAINFULLY slow - several minutes just to get our menus, several more for them to come over and answer any questions, etc and take our order.  SEVERAL (ie: 20+) more to actually get our food.  And on and on from coming over to ask \"how is everything doing here with dinner - do you need anything?\", offering and then bringing coffee/dessert, etc.\n2) my food was very poorly described - not a huge deal, but it turned out to be a fried dish, which I wouldn't have ordered if they'd described it more accurately (he said it was \"kind of like a vegetable meatloaf\", which would infer it was baked (false assumption) and which I thought sounded interesting either way.  Turned out to be fancy corn fritters (the only vegetable I could detect) in the shape of a hockey puck.  To their credit, they were reasonably tasty but so NOT what he'd described and had I known they were just fried corn fritters I would've opted for something else.   \n3) when I go to a greasy spoon coffee shop, I don't expect \"proper serving etiquette\".  However, when I go to what appears to be a higher end restaurant (ie: linen table clothes, waitstaff wearing ties, nice decor, etc) I raise my expectations accordingly.  When said (Roots) waitstaff brings us room temperature coffee (clearly been sitting for quite some time) and then proceeds to place our mugs on the table by wrapping their fingers around the rims of the cup (ie: where our mouths are going to go), I'm sorry, but someone did not train you right for...\n4) there were at least 3 different significant things on the (fairly limited) menu they ran out of.  And we're not talking, \"I'm sorry, the salad these evening no longer has toasted hazelnuts, we've run out\"...we're talking \"we ran out of the fish dish tonight\" (and then a dessert dish and something else notable, can't remember).  I get it - restaurants run out of things on occasion and I don't normally fault them.  But it was a Saturday night, we were there early in the evening and the restaurant was far from full (so it's not like they were selling fish like hot cakes), so someone was clearly not keeping an eye on ordering their stock properly.\n5) when we started to get ready to leave, I asked everyone if they thought it appropriate for me to say something to the manager (who was mostly our server that evening).  They said, \"Absolutely!\", but asked if they could excuse themselves as they embarrass easily.  As I went to speak to the manager and explained that we'd had a very disappointing evening, I attempted to keep it respectable and broad in my complaint and was ultimately met with an attitude of, \"soooo,you're feeling service wasn't fast enough for you and you're upset about this one thing?\".  And then I'd have to proceed to say, \"No, actually, I'm upset about several things - but I didn't want to get into it\".  To which he'd respond defensively with, \"Well, what else about the evening wasn't to your standards?\", to which I had to go into further detail, though still trying to stay respectable.  \"Soooo, you're upset that we ran out of a few things and that your coffee wasn't hot enough for you?\" ...and on and on, before finally I had to just pull out the stops and list not only all the things that bothered us, but also the fact that I was now having to stand here and JUSTIFY and defend my views as a customer?!  THAT was the perfect and appropriate end to the evening - indicative of the overall experience.  \n\nIf you like quiet (ie: no music, awkwardly-so-when-the-restaurant-isn't-full-enough-to-fill-in-the-silence) places and don't have to be anywhere for the better part of the evening.  And if you've snacked before you got here so you're not very hungry while ordering, aren't very committed to what you've ordered as they may not have what you want, and if you enjoy a good argument if you decide to say something about any of the above, then this place is AWESOME!!", "author": "David M."}

The chef was managing that night, so maybe that's why the food was so slow. The online menu is inaccurate. The \"best dish\" of the night was the Parmesan fries, followed by the WIld Mushroom Risotto. The short ribs ragout was too sweet, the steak was undercooked (had to send it back), the halibut cheeks tasted really fishy (and you know when you're describing a fish dish as fishy.. something is wrong), and the fried green tomatoes were alright, but it was the squash bloom that was good.

The room was almost totally empty and you could hear a pin drop. Yet...I stayed.\n\nI had a martini at the bar with a friend and was seated quickly (the staff had little else to do). The menus looked good and our waitress was friendly and just a tiny bit quirky. I liked her immediately. Quickly we were served an Amuse Bouche of watermelon consume. Sweet and very fresh.  I'm in an oyster phase right now and opened with a half dozen Marin Miyagi...very fresh with a  nice cucumber mignonette. I went with the dinner special, venison (rare), as my entree and washed it down with a glass of the 2003 Domaine de Cristia grenache/syrah blend.. The game was cooked perfectly and I finished every bit of it. The service was terrific and fun and nonintrusive. The wine list is small but balanced with bottles from all over the world...somebody put care into the selection. Noise level was low (obviously) so my friend and I could talk business.\n\nIn another space this place would be a big hit. Its amazing just how the decor of a room can affect your expectations of the meal to come. In its current location Roots is easy to miss. I'm sure much foot traffic just walks right by and that's a shame because Roots has plenty to offer. For a high quality, quiet meal with great service its hard to beat.", "author": "Gary C."}

Pomo-politan was decent too, though I asked for a much less sweet version.  They also offer a list of organic wines, which I would normally have checked out if I hadn't had such a hot cocktail-perfect day of golf, etc.\n\nFood:  To start, we had the arugula salad with goat cheese, fresh figs, and candied walnuts - delicious, but could totally make that at home.  Also tried the crab mac and cheese, which was pretty solid.  The crab was a nice addition to the old favorite.  And the cheese certainly didn't overpower it, though it could probably have complemented the crab better (not sure what cheese, off the top of my head - I'll try to reflect on it and update later).  For entrees, we tried a scallops dish and the pork chop dish.  Scallops were in a delicious sauce, but were quite chewy (very overcooked), which was a little disheartening for the scallop-lover in both of us.  The pork chop was delicious and tender, and the sauce (some sort of red wine and apple juice reduction (maybe?!? forgot to ask!)), though the potato/apple/onion pancake thing accompanying the pork chop left much to be desired (good idea, but bad result - could use more flavor (spices? salt? pepper?  none on the table, so I didn't even try adding anything to it).\n\nService:  Note that the mac and cheese takes about 15 minutes to bake (and that's just an appetizer - though I would have it as an entree if I had been going solo on it).  So if people have complained of slow service, it's probably just that things are actually fresh AND made to order here.  So yes, that takes time.  Otherwise, I found the service to be attentive, yet not obnoxious or annoying.  Our waiter was helpful in offering specialty cocktail modifications so that they wouldn't be too sweet for me.  We didn't try dessert, mostly because we were full at the time, but also because we had a fresh, homemade apple crisp ready to bake up at home.\n\nOther Notes:  They offer a cheese tasting platter, which, being a cheese-aholic, I would love to try at some point.  I imagine that a cheese tasting platter plus a bottle of organic wine (on one of the many SF nights where it is not 80 degrees out) would be a lovely way to spend the evening.  Also, as others have noted, the place was pretty empty - just the two of us and a party of 5 that had clearly been there for awhile - but it wasn't awkward or weird or overly quiet.\n\nAll in all, a good eco-friendly meal.  Probably a tad pricey, but that's also the price you pay for organic, locally grown food (though I expected a little more given the price - thank goodness for my coupon!).  Specialty drinks were pretty amazing though, so I'd recommend checking those out for sure, if nothing else.", "author": "Kristen H."}

We waited a long time to be acknowledged by a host (who ended up being the waitress) in a mostly empty restaurant, we had a party of three and we each got a different menu. We waited a very long time for our drinks to come. When we told her our menus were all different she said they had a new bar tender who was learning. When food finally came after a long wait, it was mediocre at best. The halibut was plain and salty, the mac and cheese not creamy, and the duck was drowning in plain beans. Your run of the mill comfort food restaurant does it better - chow for example. The whole green/organic thing is a total gimmick at this place which sucked us in. We felt awkward because of the wait and lack of attention. Also the restaurant ambience is a little strange because it is in a hotel lobby.

We had very high hopes for this restaurant given that it was Cali/Med using orgainic ingredients.   \n\nHere's how the night went:\n\nAppetizers:  We started out with the Panznella salad with Bloomsdale spinach, chanterelle mushrooms and truffle tremor cheese ($11).   The pieces of bread were soaked too much with the vinegar sauce that made us cough upon placing it in our mouth because of the strength of the vinegar.   It's like sniffing a bowl of hot vinegar water.   We stayed away from the wine as we tried to finish this appetizer but couldn't.  Ugh!\n\nMain Course:  The waitress recommended the cassoulet ($23) so I decided to try it.  The description said that it had house-made duck sausage so I was very excited.  When the dish arrived I was first amused by the fact that it came in a Asian clay pot but wait.......the duck sausage was more like duck sausage patties (not sausage in casing).  I felt misled...ugh!   The duck confit was good but where was the pork?  In addition, there were only a few beans and filled halfway with the broth as if I was eating a bowl of soup.   To top it off the chef decided to add diced yams which was too sweet for this dish.   That really ruined the comforting and savory flavors that I was hoping for.   \n\nMy dining partner had the red wine braised short ribs over blanched spinach and a huge mound of mashed yams ($23)  The ribs were tender and delcious  however it didn't go well with the sweetness of the yams and the citrus dressing over the spinach.  There were just too many flavors in this dish.   If this was more of a simple dish with regular potatoes and a slightly seasoned blanched veggie it would have been so tasty and comforting.  \n\nWhy is it that restaurants often think that a meal should be filled with so many contrasting flavors and large portions?   I would rather have a great meal with simple flavors that allow me to truly enjoy the real flavors of the produce/meat that I'm eating especially if it's organic/sustainable.  I really prefer quality over quantity.\n\nDessert:  The dessert was really unimpressive.  I ordered the bread pudding that was about 3/4\" thick and was cut like a terrine.  The texture of the pudding was more like mousse and didn't  have any taste.   I don't know about you but when I see bread pudding on the menu I think of a nice hearty slice that has chunks of bread.  My dining companion had a chocolate tartlet and that was fair but the chocolate that the pastry chef used did not have the WOW factor.   Both of the desserts were priced around $7.50.   \n\nWine:  We brought our own wine and after looking at the wine list we were very happy that we did.  Corkage:  $20.\n\nThe interior of this restaurant is very sterile too because it's all beige and white.  The day that we had dinner there were only three people in the restaurant. \n\nThe total bill for the evening was a little over $100 which to me was not worth it for the quality of the food.    I really hope for the best for this restaurant.   Unfortunately I don't think I will be going back.", "author": "Oscar F."}

Located inside of the Orchard Garden Hotel, a location recently renovated to be entirely \"green\" as dictated by the Leeds scale, Roots Restaurant extends the theme of being earth-friendly by not only offering organic and locally grown ingredients whenever possible, but being a \"green\" business as well. \nI asked the waiter to order for me and was pleased with his advice. The amuse bouche was a duck confit on endive followed by an appetizer of ahi tartare with jalapeno, blood orange and avocado coulis. I feel that they both could have used a little more spice and the tartare, although good, lacked a bit of acid to have made it really great. Next was a Caesar salad with grilled romaine. The dressing was almost perfect and grilling the romaine was a nice touch. For the entree, I was given a bloody rare, grass-fed cow with a potato pancake and Swiss chard. As an accompaniment, I was also ordered seared scallops topped with chorizo served with fingerling potatoes and leeks. The steak and scallops were great but it was the potato pancake and the leaks which really did it for me; the pancake flaky and crisp, the leaks soft and vegetal. Dessert was half an order of chocolate cake a la and half an order of rhubarb crisp. Both quite good.\nThe interior of the restaurant, which, upon entering, seems almost too close to the hotel's front desk, is actually very private. The decor is done in soothing, cool colours which brought to mind the freshness which the chef seeks in choosing local, organic ingredients.

I ordered one drink and vowed to never set foot back here:\n\nI stopped in for a drink because out-of-towners were visiting and staying at the Orchard Garden Hotel (Roots is in the lobby).  So I asked the bartender for a very easy cocktail: grey goose martini, up, no vermouth, twist.\n\nBartender COMPLETELY blew it; and I should know, I've spent a ton of time behind the bar.  \n\nAnyway, he starts by pouring the wrong vodka - I stop him and say, \"oh, sorry I thought I said grey goose\" - he politely says, \"I didn't hear that but this is our house vodka; it's organic and made from blah blah blah\" (I had tuned him out at this point).  \n\nNot wanting to appear like a complete jerk in front of guests I was meeting for the first time, I said, \"ok, I'll try it.\"  Then, he pours the vodka into the glass and immediately plops an olive into the martini glass.  Hey barkeep!  Last time I checked, \"a twist\" is not code for a F*ing olive!  Anyway, I remind him that I said twist.  So then instead of just cutting his losses and starting over with grey goose, he pours the \"house\" vodka BACK into a shaker with new ice and RE-SHAKES IT (uhh, yup, you guessed it, further watering down the martini).  At this point, I'm smiling (because I don't want to ream the guy in front of guests) so then he puts the finishing touches on the drink: the twist.  A twist, as everyone reading this site knows, is simply a large piece of a lemon peel.  My friend at the bar decided instead to tear up a huge piece of lime and pull all of the pulp off and drop that into my drink.\n\nSo not only did my martini [a] taste crappy (not the grey goose I ordered), [b] watered down (shaken over ice 2x), and [c] gimlet-y (the whole lime debacle) but homeboy then looks me in the eye and says \"That will be $11, sir.\"\n\nHow can you be THAT bad??

So I got the certificate and went there last night with 2 gfs. It was a sweet deal, not only we got $50 off our $100 bill, I also received 1,000 points on opentable! \n\nI liked the clean and simple interior design of the restaurant, and it was definitely a good place for us girls to have girlie talks. I noticed the menus were different from their online menus, was a little disappointed they didn't have the dayboat scallops which other Yelpers recommended. We started off with the arugula salad, it was so good! The strawberries, the candied pecans and the goat cheese went so well with the greens. It took them a little while to prepare our entrees, so we got a complimentary order of the organic french fries with truffle oil. I am not a big fan of french fries, but those were really yummy!\n\nOne of my girls and I had the seabass, it was flavorful, I really liked the greens that came with it. My other gf got the fettuccini and shrimp scampi. BTW, they make their pasta from scratch daily. Both of my gfs actually ordered the fettuccini entree, but they only had enough pasta to make one order, as the pasta they made that day wasn't satisfactory enough, so the chefs refused to serve it to customers. \n\nWe were a little disappointed with the dessert variety. They were serving gelato with rum, fresh baked cookies and croissant blueberry pudding. We had the cookies (we got a macaroon, a peanut butter cookie, a choc chip cookie, a snickerdoodle, an oatmeal raisin cookie) and the croissant pudding, the cookies were really fresh and scrumptious  As for the croissant pudding, it was a little dry and bland. \n\nOverall, the dining experience at the Roots was very pleasant, we enjoyed our meal a lot and were very stuffed after that!", "author": "Lynn C."}

The Hostess/waitress/bartender/busgirl showed us to our table and gave us our menu then I showed her the gift certificate that I had she informed us that they no longer accept it. I thought it was very kind of her to give us the option to either stay for dinner or we could leave. She explained to us that she  would understand if we wanted to leave and go somewhere else since we couldn't use the gift certificate. We decided to stay and found the food to be really delicious. I had Crispy Salmon and my husband had the Kobe Burger which he really enjoyed. I tried the grilled Salmon and it was laid on top of a bed of salad. I'm not a big fan of salad but the salad was dressed with some type of Ginger dressing and it was YummY! The Ginger dressing was not overpowering where it would take away the flavoring of the veggies. The Salmon was cooked to perfection. It was not dry and over-cooked. There was yellow beets accompanying the salmon and I thought it was just ok. But everything else was very nicely done and made just right.", "author": "Jamie W."}

Then on travelzoo they said it was extended because the restaurant was closing down and would reopen with a new menu and a new name and that the voucher would be good for a combination of food and beverage up to the $109.

The Roots menu happily suited us all, especially since the delish soup of the day (tomato with a swirl of pesto) was vegan.   So, food, probably four stars.\n\nHowever, I have to echo comments that imply that Roots is still a little rough around the edges.

The owner-host was very friendly.  This was great the time I went there for a happy hour and he chatted us up at the bar and gave us an appetizer special.  For lunch with the chair of our board, though, he was just a wee bit intrusive.  Also, while I was very pleased with our quiet secluded banquette, apparently my co-workers on the other side of the table were distracted by ambient noises and odd music choice.  (The Bee Gees?  Celine Dion?  Come on, not quite matching the classy decor).  Also, I filled up just fine on my moderately priced and generous soup-and-salad choices, but ended up letting my friend graze because she still looked hungry after her tiny mound of $18 risotto.\n\nI would go here again for a professional lunch if I wasn't in a rush (anything over $10 - ok, anything over brownbag from home - is too expensive for me when I'm not on the corporate credit card).

Thank God the chef has decided against butter and bread, and has opted for paper thin slices of toasted baguette with fresh olive tapenade to begin your meal.  I enjoyed the lamb ribs in a pomegranate glaze so much I might swear off pork ribs for the rest of my life; however, nothing can top the duck liver mouse.  It absolutely melts in your mouth!", "author": "Leyla A."}

We went before seeing smart , witty,and full of rage Jeneane Garofalo at Cobb's a few weeks back.  The space was airy and relaxing despite how small it was.  Decoration was minimal and it is also easy to miss from the outside.  We started by sharing the generously portioned carrot soup and  it was simply delicious.  Who would have predicted carrot soup to be exceptional but believe me, it was.  We then had mussels in a tasty broth and ribs covered with a strange sauce.  We then shared a fish entree which was also yummy.  The restaurant prides on it support and practice of being green and using organic ingredients.  I would definitely recommend this place and intend to return.  It was quiet on Sunday night with only a few diners so also did appreciate that the noise level was minimal allowing for conversation without having to scream like at many restaurants in San Francisco.", "author": "Jac C."}

I have loved the site and used it countless times to carefully select restaurants; however, not until now have I had such an extreme experience at a restaurant that I was compelled to write a review. This was one of the worst dining experiences that I have had. I went to Roots for Thanksgiving dinner this year. I was looking forward to the organic holiday meal. I am sad to say that I left with a light wallet and half-empty stomach. \n\nLet's start from the beginning. I called for a reservation, but had to leave a message with the hotel concierge because there was no one available in the restaurant to answer the phone. I should have known then, but assuming it is Thanksgiving and they are probably busy, with my sights set on an Organic Thanksgiving meal, I made my reservation on Open Table. I wanted to eat at 4:00, but could only get in at 3:00. I again figured this was due to my late planning and happily accepted the 3:00pm time. Upon arriving at the restaurant, I learned this was solely due to poor management. I arrived at the restaurant to find it almost completely empty - only one table with 4 people at it sitting in the entire place. During the entire two and a half hours that I was there, the restaurant never reached more than half of its capacity. My meal continued on its downhill course. It was about 50 degrees outside and despite 4 requests to keep the half-empty restaurant door closed, the staff made no attempt to accommodate. Additionally, upon the most enthusiastic wine recommendation \u00e2\" our waitress said it was the accompanying bottle with our price-fixed menu \u00e2\" we purchased a bottle of wine. It was practically undrinkable. We ordered separate glasses and drinks to try to find a somewhat enjoyable drink to accompany our meal \u00e2\" nothing worked. If efforts not to be rude, we took the 3/4th full bottle of wine with us and threw it out in the trash half way up the block. The night went on with rushed service, mediocre food and arguably partly-frozen dessert. We laughed and made the best of it until the bill. Our waitress brought out dessert as another course in our preset menu, but then charged us for two desserts. What an outrage! All in all, I will never go back to this place and would not recommend it to anyone.", "author": "Alexis P."}
