Did he actually come here?  Not sure.  \n\nBut this bar is as vital to North Beach as Hemingway was to literature, cocktails, & tropical locales.\n\nFirst, the hours.  G&C is open from 6 to 2, everyday.  That's AM.  Because greatness should be accessible as close to 24/7 as possible.\n\nSecond, this is the definition of a neighborhood bar.  People that call it a dive bar, complementing it or not, are missing the mark.  Come in more than twice, & both you & your drink will be remembered.  Before cell phones, it was common & welcome to get phone calls here.  And once upon a time, when I lived upstairs, I ran down for coffee cream when I was out...in my bathrobe & wedge slippers.  A few times.\n\nThanks Ron, Sherrie, & Silvio.\n\nThird, the clientele.  Locals?  Puh-leez.  This is where everyone from North Beachers, fishermen, firemen, cops, service industry, Congressman, & even celebrities rub elbows.  \n\nRemember Carol Doda?  You should.  If you're a millennial, google it.  \n\nThis was her joint.\n\nWe miss you Carol.\n\nFinally, the drinks.  Short & stiff, something on tap, a mean negroni.  Just PLEASE don't order anything along the lines of an appletini for chrisakes.  Sure they'll make it, but this is a proud & respectable bar.  This bar was (& probably still is) the number one seller of fernet in the country.  When in Rome...\nhave a fernet.\n\nNow, Herb Caen. \nThe late SF Chronicle columnist himself was well known for loving both North Beach, & a great bar.  The Washbag, Moose's, & NB Restaurant were all a regular part of his rotation...\n\nalong with Gino's.\n\nFinally, family.  Ownership has always been a partnership & has had its subtractions & additions, but this is still a family run business in every sense.  \n\nAnd if you're cool, you'll be treated as such.\n\nThere's even a monthly luncheon.  Antipasto (usually just bread & salami), salad, pasta, entree, bottomless wine.  They move the pool tables out & turn it into a bonafide dining room.  Check out the upcoming menu on the board above the bar, & buy a ticket.  $30.  It used to be every 2 weeks, & Rachel & I were there every 2 weeks.  \n\nStill the best deal in SF.\n\nThank you G&C.\n\nA great bar.\n\n5 stars.", "author": "Veronica M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-03-03", "description": "This is one of the oldest bar in North Beach. Built in 1942, this bar is a favorite hangout for the old-school and newer generation Italians. The bar has 15 beers on tap with family-members bartending & serving, cool music, a pair of billiard tables and entertaining locals with a ton of priceless and nostalgic stories of North Beach of the yester-years. Where North Beach once was the epicenter for the Italians. I love to hear stories of old North Beach. But unfortunately, North Beach is beginning to be an area for the younger generation who could care less about the past and care about getting drunk immediately.\n\nWith the bar's pair of of billiard tables, every Mondays and Wednesdays the bar has a pool tournament. One of my co-worker's best friend, who is also a regular Gino and Carlos patron, is one of 64 players involve in the tournament. I was there earlier tonight and she was one of eight remaining hustlers. Yes, she is that good. The entrance fee is $25.00 and the grand prize is a pair of airplane tickets to Las Vegas with hotel and car rental included. That's is not bad for $25.00 for the entrance fee, but you have to be a really good pool-shark. \n\nWhile she was playing, at the bar I ordered a Sea Breeze. For $4.00 the cocktail comprised with parts cranberry juice, grapefruit juice and vodka. Frank, one of the family members and bartender, used Ketel-one Vodka for my cocktail and he didn't skimp on the higher-end vodka either. One sip of the potent cocktail has changed my mood completely. I was sipping on my cocktail and sadly saw my co-worker's friend lost and being eliminated from the tournament. Maybe I jinxed her. I hope not. \" Hey, I'm just being my Joe Cool-self and chatting to and listening with the regulars!\" \n\nOther the priceless stories of the neighborhood, I was told that the bar has great lunch specials on Thursdays. With a slice of Prime-rib or Petrale sole with sides of salad and pasta and a glass of wine for $20.00. If I comeback during the midday, I might try that one day.

That said, nothing about the bar impressed me. \n\nAfter waiting kind of a long time at the bar's designated ordering spot, I was greeted by a relatively unfriendly bartender. The beer menu said they had Fat Tire on tap. So I ordered one. Oh, nope, turns out they changed out some of their regular beers for the Festival. So no Fat Tire. Hmm. I saw a bottle of Stoli Blueberry, so I ordered a Stoli Blueberry and Tonic. Turns out they were out of Stoli Blueberry. I ordered my friend a Stoli Raspberry and Cranberry. But they were out of Stoli Raspberry. I ended up with a straight vodka tonic; he had a vodka cranberry. Each drink was $6 and came in a pathetically small clear PLASTIC cup. Apparently they didn't feel like washing actual glasses for the festival. Or maybe we just didn't warrant actual glass, as I did see some real glasses on the bar.\n\nThe drinks were fine, but for the price, I felt they were too small by a half and mine certainly wasn't strong enough. I understand that this is most likely a bar where people come to chill out and many customers are regulars (and probably a lot older than me), and that the festival causes an influx of non-regulars, but shit. Come on. \n\nAlso, my friend was not impressed with what he saw on their internet jukebox, and a bar with bad music is...well, it's just not where I want to spend my money. \n\nI will probably go back eventually, more because I want to go to a couple other bars in the area and because I think Gino & Carlo's sign warrants a second visit, but if next time my experience isn't exponentially better than the first, this bar will definitely be on my \"pass\" list. The rundown wooden interior was half-awesome and half-trashy, and I guess I need another experience at this place to make a final judgment.", "author": "Ashley M."}

I'd never been out in North Beach before, other than dinner, and was excited to paint the town!\n\nAs a natural \"lister\" I can tell you that I'm aware of a number of fabulous places in the NB bar scene- and Gino & Carlo was definitely not on that list! My boyfriend insisted we go here, as its one of his favorite dive bars. (Don't get me wrong- I dig dives!)\n\nThe atmosphere was fun- a nice mix of folks, and the bartenders are incredibly friendly (or so I was told, since a girlfriend of mine left with a #). \n\nHOWEVER, did you really just charge me $6 for a vodka tonic that comes in the glass the size of a my pinky?!?!? I swear to you, this was the SMALLEST vodka tonic I'd ever received for the price. Especially since girlfriend got hers for free! Come on! I'm cute too! Is it because I'm obviously with this dude next to me that mine is more expensive? Are you charging me for her drink essentially? NOT COOL!

He reminded me of the kind of sleazy uncle by marraige.  But he was harmless enough. We kept playing with him, to trade rounds and even the score a bit.  We had a great time.\n\nIts a Classic Hangout where you get experiences like that, which don't happen on Union St or Valencia St.  Everyone mentions how you can see yuppies to Garbage men in here.  \n\nThey serve Fernet like they probably have been since the 40's.  The patrons run the gamut of age.  Some come to catch up with old family friends, some seem to come to find some new company, while others come to drown their tears and piss off the bar tender.  The pool tables seem to be reserved for la familia, I always get a strange vibe when I walk back there, but that just adds to the charm.\n\nNot sure if they have a real happy hour, but its such a great place to kick off the night, come between 7 and 9, get out before you say something stupid.", "author": "Christian W."}

As noted elsewhere, the jukebox is outstanding, the bartenders are at times gruff, and the stories and conversation swirling around you will make you laugh out loud if you aren't careful (but don't, because eavesdropping is, of course, impolite!)\nThe only problem w/Gino and Carlo's is that it takes a while to be accepted by the regulars, and you have to reestablish this connection every time if you're an out-of-towner like me.  It helps immensely if you bring female companionship with you.  The boys have no problem striking up a conversation with a good-looking woman!\n\nNorth Beach is wonderful in general, and G&C stands out in North Beach.", "author": "GL K."}

Not pretentious at all.  Only thing is that drinks aren't that cheap considering, but they're about average.  Just a great place to bring some friends and hang out after work. \n\nP.S.
