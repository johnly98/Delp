Eek, I'm just not so sure about that cost, especially when this is the kind of joint where you go up to order a burger, it's brought to your table and then you don't see a server again. We came in because we wanted a quick bite as we needed to head to the airport to catch a flight and had been told about this burger concept and gave it a shot. They had burger concoction suggestions for you and then you also had the option to build your own. Additionally they had salads if you chose not to get a burger. My boyfriend order their classic burger with french fries and I built my own. Being that it was my first time here, I started throwing out things I wanted; chose the veggie burger with lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions and got sweet potatoes on the side. Again, with an added glass of Rose this all came to $50. I was pretty shocked to hear the total to be honest. We were given a number to put on our table indicating which order number we were so the people running the food knew where to go.\n\nJust as I sat down at a table outside I realize I never told the woman what kind of bun I wanted (she also never asked.) I'm gluten free so I ran back to change my bun, which she very easily changed for me and that was an additional $1.50 (expected for the bun change but dang this is an expensive quick burger) Anyways, you could choose a variety of dipping sauces for no additional charge, we just stuck with regular ketchup and mustard and picked a whole grain mustard as well. You grab your silverware and napkins on a little counter and then go to your table. It happened to be a hot day out and I could not rest my arms down on the table it was so hot. The material of the surface of the tables was all wrong for an outside table that will be hit with any sort of sunlight. I literally took napkins to put underneath my elbows and even the heat coming from the table through the napkins was too painful I had to keep my arms down. Honestly, any baby or young child who doesn't know better would have burned themselves on these tables, they really need to be swapped for a different kind of material. It was painful and uncomfortable sitting out there especially with a chair that was so wobbly it wouldn't stay in one position.\n\nThe food took forever to come out, we actually couldn't believe how long. Eventually they came out and we scarfed them down in fear we were going to miss our flight. The burger was interesting; the vegetable patty was not a patty but more mush. It was difficult to eat and I ended up using a fork for the majority of it. The vegetable burger was made with quinoa and onions and it just wasn't molded and fell apart. The sweet potato fries were delicious. We left super full and satisfied. The food tasted fresh and there was good flavor, but it was expensive, took a long time to come out and it wasn't comfortable sitting outside.", "author": "Samantha S."}

But I've given it two shots now! And I'm pretty set on saying that Roam is closer to solid than spectacular.\n\nI originally withheld my thoughts on Roam because I wasn't a huge fan of the Pacific Blue (definitely the wrong order!) and wanted to try something less adventurous with The Classic before rendering my final verdict. The ingredients are fresh and the flavor is solid. It's a well-made product. But their burgers are just missing that extra something. I think after two turns, it's safe to make this call. They do have some good truffle parmesan fries though, I will give them that. And having gluten-free buns is the reason my girlfriend really likes this place, since she needs to have gluten-free buns.\n\nStaff here has always been very friendly and accommodating in the two times I've been here.

In San Francisco fashion, they post exactly where the meats come from, the cows' names, roommates and their favorite Netflix show. They make their buns with wheat watered only with Boss, Evian or Fiji water (I'm kidding, not really).\n\nWe had the Tejano and Classic Burgers. The corn chips, avocado and herb ranch provided the crunch, texture and flavor to make me recommend the Tejano burger over the Classic burger. The Classic burger wasn't anything extraordinary, just a well made burger.\n\nThe two big surprises of the dinner were the Farmers Market Salad and Zucchini onion haystack. Each ingredient in the Farmers Market Salad delivered a specific purpose like the crunch from snap peas, the body and texture of butter lettuce, the sweetness of the tangerines, richness of the avocado and the bite of the radishes. \n\nThe zucchini are spiralized thinly and I think tossed with a light coating of flour or cornstarch before frying.

All the flavors blend perfectly together. You don't feel overly stuffed after eating the burger; right portion size and very fresh ingredients! Not too oily. I also ordered the sweet potato fries, which I probably would skip next time, and the zucchini onion haystack, which I recommend trying, it's thinly sliced zucchini with a light and crispy crunch too it. Plus you feel like you're eating somewhat healthy although fried. \n\nIf you're willing to splurge a little more - the place is a bit pricey (~12 for a burger excluding sides) - order one of their house-made sodas. I really enjoyed the the caramelized pineapple. Tastes like sweeter carbonated water and serves as a nice drink to wash down the meat. Will come here again to try their other burgers.

Otherwise, it's kinda chaotic to try to look for a table after placing the order. They also have tables outside with heat lamps but it is still gets pretty cold. \n\nMy friend had the Classic with Beef patty ($8.99). It came with lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles and house sauce. I had a Sunny Side with Turkey patty ($10.99). It came with a fried egg, fontina, caramelized onions, greens, tomato, and chili sauce. I said no to onions and sauce on the side, which they forgot so I'm not sure what it tastes like.

FINALLY, I had the chance to come with my family. I liked the burger patties much better here than at Super Duper, because imo, they were juicier and heartier. I also appreciated that when I ordered my patty lettuce-wrapped, they use butter lettuce leaves, which means the burger stays together, so I can actually eat my order as a burger, rather than with a fork and spoon. However, similar to Super Duper, I thought the customer service could be better. When I made my order at the register and specified that I wanted my BBQ sauce on the side, I made sure to confirm with the cashier that the sauce would be on the side. However, when all our entrees were delivered to our table, there was no BBQ sauce! It was also hard to track down someone to grab some from the kitchen for me, as no one came to check that our orders were delivered correctly. So despite the better-tasting burger here, I'm not sure if I'd make a second trip back.", "author": "Connie X."}

Came here for the second time this Friday, and it was packed, so clearly the city agrees with me. Last time, I got the tejano burger with a veggie patty, which was actually the best veggie patty I think I've had. I've been recommending it to all my vegetarian friends. This time, I wanted to try something new, so I got the sunny-side up turkey burger and added jalape\u00f1o relish, and it was amazing as well! My only issue was that I wanted to substitute the cheese for the equally priced mushrooms because I have a dairy allergy, and they wouldn't make the sub without an added fee, which didn't make a lot of sense to me and felt kind of rude since this was a dietary restriction not a personal preference. We also ordered the fry-fecta to split at the table, and we all agreed that the zucchini fries were the hit and truly unique to Roam. Would definitely order those again!", "author": "Sonia S."}

This comes with cremini mushrooms, watercress, Swiss, tomato and house sauce. This tastes like a 'healthy' burger, if there ever was one. I believe its because of the toppings that mellows out the flavor from the patty. Something to get if you want a burger but don't want it too over the top! \n-The Fry-Fecta: I only got this because I was interested in trying the zucchini onion haystack but my friend wanted to actually eat fries. PASS. the zucchini onion is cool after like 3 bites and then falls apart pretty easily. Better off getting one of the actual fries \n\nParking is literally the biggest waste of time. please just park very far away and walk here to burn off the calories\nThe wait to order can be long, depending what time you get there. the line goes out the out the door and there isn't much of a waiting area. \nThere is a self-help area for water, plates, napkins and utensils.

I also noticed that the busboys were very quick to clear tables for other patrons. \n\nI ordered the Tejano burger with bacon and the Fry-Fecta: zucchini fries, sweet potato fries, and regular fries. Food came out fast and hot! The burger was delicious! All of the ingredients were fresh and top notch. The bacon was thick, the avocados were firm, and the addition of crunchy tortilla strips was the perfect touch. The fries fell short for me, however. They were a bit too salty and they weren't crispy. The prices here are pretty high, but the quality of the burger ingredients reflect the price tag. I would definitely stop here again for a burger if I were ever in the area.", "author": "Liana B."}

The beef sunny-side burger (organic free-range egg, aged white cheddar, caramelized onions, greens, tomato, chili sauce) was quite solid, albeit over a bit quickly given the $10.99 price. Fries (or a zucchini onion haystack) are an extra $3.99, so with a drink (fortunately, they have a decent draft beer selection) the whole affair will easily run you $20-25. \n\nService is fairly casual - you order at the register and then find a seat at the bar or at communal tables.

It wasn't until I saw Food Network's \"Best. Burger. Ever.\" where Chef Marcel Vigneron showcased Roam and talked about their French & Fry Turkey Burger.  It looked so good on TV that I knew I had to try it out someday.\n\nIt took a while for me to visit but I eventually came by on a weekend for lunch.  \n\nTurkey French and Fry Burger -- http://bit.ly/2bBvHeM\ntruffle parmesan fries, gruyere, avocado, caramelized onions, watercress, piquant sauce, whole grain mustard.\nOh yeah, it was just as good as Chef Marcel explained it on the TV show.  For a turkey burger, my mind was blown because I never thought I'd enjoy it so much especially with this unique combination of toppings.  First off, the truffle fries IN the burger is always a good thing.  Then all the other toppings make the burger rich and exquisite with a little bit of zest from the mustard.  I loved it!\n\nOf course after enjoying that burger on that first visit, it didn't take me long to go back again just a few weeks later.  And this time, I came in really hungry.  So hungry that I once again ordered the French & Fry Turkey Burger and another burger as well, but this burger I decided to create my own (http://bit.ly/2egI4Ar)\n\nMy Create Your Own Burger -- http://bit.ly/2dHpoX5\nwith beef, white cheddar, caramelized onions and house sauce.\nAs simple as this burger sounds, this is actually my favorite burger topping combination with any restaurant.  And Roam's version delivers on every note.  The beef patty was juicy and the cheese, caramelized onions, and house sauce all came together nicely to make this a perfect burger.\n\nWhile the menu does have some mainstay items, it does have menu specials depending on what's available during the season (http://bit.ly/2bKpsJd) as well as crafting their own sodas (http://bit.ly/2bBvf0n).  All the more reason to come back for future visits.\n\nI also like how the restaurant has an open air look to it where it almost feels like your eating on a patio but still indoors.  It always has a welcoming vibe whenever I visit.\n\nRoam has definitely created a great impression on me with their burgers, which I think are some of the best in San Francisco in general.  I put them along the same lines as Pearl's where every time I visit, the burgers get better and better.  Though with Roam, I feel like I'm getting a lot more not just with food, but the whole atmosphere in general.", "author": "Rodney H."}

I finally made another trip back here for some comfort food. Their chalet burger with bison meat was delicious. Very juicy. The fry-fecta (all three types of fries) was good too. \n\nHowever, the quality of the service leaves a bit to be desired. My friend and I grabbed an open seat, but the table remained unwiped for a while. We had to call someone over to clean the table. We had asked for some items on the side, but the server seemingly forgot to bring us the side items. For a gourmet burger place where one is paying $20/person for burgers, fries, and drinks, I hoped for better service (minus one star).\n\nStill, maybe the staff just had a long day.

You order at the cashier, they hand you a number, and then you seat yourself at any open tables, indoors or outdoors. I got the Heritage burger with bison meat. It comes with bacon, cheese, herb mayo, and vegetables. The bison meat is top notch. I'm used to bison being pretty chewy, but this one is so tender and juicy!! The price is right too. It's $10.99 for signature burgers and $8.99 for a plain burger. It's additional cost for bison or wild boar. Sure, it's a little more expensive than say, going to Red Robin, where you can spend the same amount of money for both a burger AND fries, but it's totally worth it knowing the meat is pasture raised.

The toasted sesame bun, coupled with a fresh patty of grilled grass-fed beef, housemade pickles, special sauce, lettuce, onion, and tomato make each bite of this burger taste like a piece of heaven. (Heaven to me would obviously be my eating endless Roam burgers). My BF got the classic burger with a GF bun + avocado and a fried egg... why not? Paired with french fries and a local beer, we were happy. I say go for the classic because why would you mess with a good thing. But you can also build your own, or try one of their pre-outlined burger topping options to mix it up.\n\nAnytime my boyfriend can get something gluten free that actually tastes good is an additional win, so for those with a gluten intolerance, enjoy this burger on a GF bun and smile like you're eating real bread once again.\n\nIt's an order at the counter place. There was a line when we got there on weeknight around 7-8pm, but it went fast and we had no problem grabbing a seat inside.

I ordered the Pacific Blue burger and a bottled soda, while my fianc\u00e9 ordered the BBQ burger, which came to a total of around $29 with tax.\n\nThe burgers were small-but-good, although not good enough to merit their cost of around $12 each, especially considering that we had to find additional food elsewhere to fill us up afterward.  \n\nWhat Roam got right:\n\nThe sesame bun was really delicious, and my toppings (blue cheese, tomato, caramelized onion, and steak sauce) all tasted really fresh.  We both ordered our burgers well-done, and they were still very juicy. \n\nWhere they went wrong:\n\nWe waited a long time for our burgers, and the restaurant only had one other diner in there at the time.  Shortly after we'd ordered and sat down, we watched him send whatever he got back to the chef on account of being too slimy/rubbery (which the server was great about, from what we could see), and I assume the wait was because they were fixing his order, which came out again at the same time as ours.\n\nAs mentioned, the burgers were paltry in size and weren't filling.  The toppings on my burger were unevenly spread, with tomato shoved to one side and a small dollop of blue cheese relegated to the other side. The menu lists watercress as a topping, but it was missing from my burger, which I discovered when I opened my burger to spread the toppings around.  Would it have been too much to spread the toppings around so I didn't have to open up my burger and do it myself? Also, if you're going to call it a \"Pacific Blue\" burger -- assuming that the \"Blue\" part refers to the blue cheese spread, shouldn't you have more than just a nickel-sized dab of blue cheese on it? \n\nAt the end of the day, our burgers weren't anything special, and in a city that's such a foodie-haven, I'm sure there's a lot better out there.  For the amount of time and money we spent on these average burgers, I think our night and cash would've been better spent elsewhere.", "author": "Katelyn R."}

I also had a bite of the Seasonal Veggies which had a nice hearbal and salty flavor, more salt than I'd put into it, but still tasty. My first bite of the Elk burger was epic. The runny egg was messy and delightful and the meat was cooked exactly how I asked. The burger was a little small, but super delicious. I had a bite of my brother's Bison Tejano burger - very full of flavor, but my palate for bison is not super sophisticated so I don't really know how to assess how good it is. Anyway, I probably won't be back for a while - but if you are craving some tasty burgers in a spot with a good vibe. Come through.", "author": "Ibs A."}

I like your veggie burgers. I don't need to eat a big burger. But, I am frustrated with the same repeated mistake with takeaway orders. \n\nMost recent order: \n\nI ordered a veggie classic. \nI confirmed when the nice cashier read back the order. \nI made sure by checking the Square receipt.\nI checked the sticker on the wrapped burger: Veggie Classic. \nI left the restaurant with takeaway in hand.\n\nLater:  When I unwrapped the package, I got a beef burger. It went right into the compost because I don't eat beef. \n\nTwo stars: One star for mixing up my order for the THIRD time for the same order at the same Fillmore location for takeaway: a beef burger in place of a veggie burger. Add one star for getting my spouse's turkey burger right and for Roam's philosophy of sustainable foods.\n\nI got a refund after calling the restaurant; it sounds like you are used to mix-ups in the kitchen. Also, the fries were limp, a consistent problem likely with your fryer. I'm never going back to this Fillmore location again. Good luck, Roam enterprise, with the expansion.", "author": "M.D. L."}

The workers there were incredibly nice and patient. I seriously spent 20 minutes trying to decide what to eat and even though they were about to close, they let me stay and pick and helped while I bounced ideas off them (yeah I'm picky, I know). In my opinion, this place is a solid 4 stars. \n\nI ended up picking the French and Fries and the Tejano along with the Fry-fecta. The French and Fries has truffle parmesan fries inside the burger along with gruyere, avocado, caramelized onions, watercress and Dijon mustard. At Roam, they also have a variety of beers on tap and different meats, such as bison, beef and turkey. We went with the beef, medium rare, for the French and Fries and turkey for the other. \n\nThe French and Fries was definitely the perfect burger for me. I love having avocado in my burger and I love anything truffle or parmesan flavored. The meat was cooked perfectly as well - I just love it when restaurants get the medium rare right. The only thing I would note is that the mustard flavor is definitely strong here. In my opinion, it doesn't compliment the rest of the flavor of the burger well and it is a contrast on the savory taste (in a bad way). I don't typically like mustard but I find that when the flavor is used correctly with the other flavors in the dish, I have no complaints. Besides the mustard, I would say the French and Fries was out of this world delicious.\n\nThe Tejano is definitely a Mexican inspired burger. It has pepper jack cheese, jalapeno relish, avocado, tomato, white corn strips (kind of like tortilla chips) and herb ranch. This was totally my boyfriend's burger. I didn't get to try the japaeno relish since I'm pretty bad with spicy and especially hate jalapenos. The rest of the burger was pretty good. I definitely recommend this burger if you're into the Mexican flavor. The chips compliment the burger nicely and have a satisfying crunch as you bite into them. I wasn't incredibly impressed by the turkey meat, mostly neutral about it. From what I could taste, there was no extremely special flavor about it and I could have gone with beef instead. \n\nI can't end this review without putting a word in for the Fry-fecta. Man, I hate zucchini but those zucchini onion rings were out of this world. The flavor and breading was just fantastic. It really melted in your mouth and wasn't too oily and just perfect. (Dying just thinking about it.) The sweet potato fries were my second favorite in the trifecta of fries. The traditional russet french fries were my least favorite simply because they were a bit too salty. Overall, definitely would recommend getting the fry trio on your first time and seeing which one you like best. Roam is a great burger joint in San Francisco. It's not a formal sit-down restaurant. There's actually a counter where you order and you get a number so definitely recommend coming here after work or bringing some friends to grab a beer, watch the game and enjoy some damn good burgers.", "author": "Nancy T."}

Definitely one of my favorite burger spots. \n\nI went all out and ordered their Sunny Side burger (fried egg, white cheddar, caramelized onions, greens and tomato), substituted herb mayo (instead of sweet chili sauce) and added bacon (extra $1). My burger was so flavorful and the patty was juicy. I was happy with the size of my burger and I was more than full. Their prices are reasonable - all specialty burgers are under $10 and add ons are $1.75 and under. I love that they offer several sauces and they're all free. Ask for the herb ranch with your fries.\n\nAlthough the location is small and not ideal for large parties, I like that you order and pay at the register so you don't have to split the tab. The food comes out quickly and they quickly bus tables as well. Everyone I've encountered here is super friendly too. \n\nI've tried Roam a few years ago, but haven't revisited until recently.

She was raving about the gluten-free buns; I just needed a good burger! So happy we were able to share cos I also wanted to try their salad! We went with a simple burger for my first time: beef burger with bacon, white cheddar, and avocado (you can make your own burger). The meat was tender and very flavorful! It was juicy but not too oily. The bacon was perfectly cooked, not too salty or crispy, and the ratio of cheese to meat was on point. The burger was also the perfect size (well, we did half it. So, there was enough space for the other dishes.) Overall, the burger was probably one of the best \"artisanal\" burgers I have ever had!\n\nWe also ordered a side of the Fry-Fecta and a Market Salad (at this point in the trip, I needed all the veggies I could get!). The Fry-Fecta is a MUST EAT when you are at Roam! It's a combo of russet potatoes, sweet potatoes and zucchini all fried up to perfection with the right amount of salt and an awesome aoili dip. My gawd! Sooo GOOOD! The Market Salad was a mix of the fresh veggies they got that morning and it was HUGE! That was the very first time I ate raw radish and it was very sweet! The salad was tossed in a miso dressing which was perfect with the burger.\n\nI never thought I would be able to go there since it is quite far from where I was staying.

The burgers are kind of expensive for their size, but I almost don't mind because 1) this is SF and everything is overpriced, 2) it was the perfect size for me to feel full but not gross, and 3) we didn't have to wait 2 hours in line to eat!", "author": "Stephany L."}

They serve a lot of different kinds of meats (bison, beef, turkey, and veggie). I cannot speak for the bison, turkey, or veggie burger but the beef burger was simply delicious. \n\nPerhaps I'm being frugal, but the prices for this place are a bit exorbitant.

None of the ingredients stood out and the patty wasn't juicy. For the price, Super Duper can do the beef patty better.\n\nThe price adds up FAST here. Classic burgers start at $8.49 but if want to get a certain style then it goes up to $10.49. If you want to add extra ingredients, it'll run you $1-1.75 each.

The only thing that's free are the sauces!\n\nThe Coconut Lime house made soda was soooo good though. I'd get this over the milkshake because you can get a good milkshake almost anywhere, but you can't get uniquely flavored sodas made in house!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-20", "description": "My life crossed paths with Roam on a weekend not too long ago. It was a serendipitous event as I unseemingly, unknowingly happened upon the burger joint. I won't bore you with the details, but basically I unexpectedly sat my hungry self down in their restaurant.\n\nYes, the burger menu looked great, but truthfully I can't remember what was on it. (Google it.) I wavered between a classic burger and one that was a bit more sexy like a cheddar, bacon, fried onion type of number and decided that conservative was the way to go. Simple is often times better. I nudged my co-worker in the arm and asked if he'd like to share some fries to which he said to me \"oh I'm ordering one just for myself. I'll eat all of it.\" Just as well. He had his thick cut fries and I got my own order of sweet potato fries and the rest was history.\n\nThe meat was probably the best part of the burger. Buns are always of utmost importance, but all I can recall about that burger was how flavorful and moist it was from the juicy patty. I had the beef one, and the best way I can explain it is by saying how \"loose\" the meat was as opposed to the meat being super packed and dry. I'm not even all that big of a carnivore, but the quality was noticeable. Then of course there were the fries. I ordered them \"extra crispy\" so that I got the crunchy exterior with the hot, smooth interior. The fries were seasoned with what must have been simple salt and pepper and a touch of something else. Whatever it was, it was good.", "author": "Cici T."}

The bar is vast with a full selection of drinks to choose from. There is an elongate community table that is set in the middle of this restaurant. Moreover, there are a few tables that are set against the wall. The seatings here are an abundance. It has a casual feel and very relaxed. \n\n2. Food: We ordered the Beef Tejano, Fry-Fecta (Sweet potatoes, parmesan fries, string fries), Beef Heritage, Turkey Heritage. The meat were so juicy and fresh. A lot of places struggle with creating a perfect turkey burger, but this was perfect. It was not dry at all and full of flavors. The Heritage consists of bacons that are extra crispy and thick. The Beef Tejano had a crunch to it because of the chips. It was delicious with great combinations. \n\n3. Service: Service was fast and friendly. Caroline was very patient with us of our orders as we have never been here before.  You order your meat and the different styles of burgers. The styles are listed via the board on the right side before the checkout counter. \n\n4. Costs: The Fry-Fecta was $6.75 and the burgers were $9.99. The portions were fulfilling and so worth every penny.\n\n5. Overall Experience: I am in love with this burger joint. I had Umami and Gott's before and this is hands down, a winner from the pack. It is delicious and has a lot of fresh ingredients. I love their burger joint concepts/set ups.

The toppings: mushroom, swiss cheese, tomato, house sauce - all very good. However, not executed perfectly, and in fact, in combination, left me wanted more in my burger.

The combo of the Pepper Jack cheese, Jalape\u00f1o Relish, Avocado, Tomato, White Corn Strips, Herb Ranch melded together in a wonderful harmony.

I wasn't in the mood to try it since I didn't want to be too full, but here's his take on it: the first turkey burger I've ever had and it was awesome. \n\n^ lmao, ok. Anyways, the place is pretty tiny and the line was out the door. Really crowded because there was a handful of small families with strollers and tiny people. Thankfully, one of my special skills came in handy (I don't have many) and we found a place to sit right away! Otherwise, we would've just taken it to go. \n\nThe food came out in about 10-15 minutes!", "author": "Leana E."}

The venue is a little small with limited seating but them ambience was uplifting and bright.\nI ordered the vegan burger Tejano style with a gluten free bun, a side of the Fry-Frecta, and their seasonal Banana Walnut chocolate Chip shake.\n\n The banana walnut chocolate chip shake was thick and creamy! The taste of the banana was strong and there were bits of walnut in the shake, but I taste much of the chocolate chips even though there were some bits of it in there.\n\nMy friend and I split the Fry-Frecta and it was amazing. It came with regular seasoned fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini fries. My favorite out of the three was the zucchini, it was light and seasoned perfectly.\n\nThe vegan burger Tejano style with a gluten free bun was really unique. The protein they used was seasone quinoa which I found had a very interesting texture. I was impressed with their gluten free bun, it was thick and soft and kept the toppings in place. The Tejano style came with avocado, pepper jack, jalape\u00f1o relish, tomato, white corn strip, and herb ranch. I liked the white corn strip gave it a little crunch and their jalape\u00f1o relish mixed in a kick of spice. \n\nOverall this place is great if you're looking for a new burger joint to try out!

You know it's good when you don't need to add or alter anything. No ketchup needed.\n\nRusset Fries w/ Truffle Parmesan:\nI've tried all three sides and this takes the cake for being the best pairing for me - taste and ease (that zucchini onion haystack, but difficult to eat with just fingers).

Upon which, I had no further value to him.  No thank-you, no smile, not even the remotest polite expression.  Just 'fifteen minutes' with body language saying, \"I'm through with you now, move away from me\".

San Francisco had a free concert in the park so every local joint on the Western half of the city was packed.  Not to mention that the Giants were locked in what would be a historic (note I did not use the hipster term \"epic\") playoff game battle on a Saturday night so pizzerias and even some local establishments had long waiting lists at 8:30pm.\n\nMoved East to Fillmore and settled in Roam where we could watch the end of the game.  the artisanal burgers are very gourmet and organic.  As this is San Francisco of course they have gluten free buns for an extra dollar.  Usually you order from the very exotic looking burger menu and pay, and then they give you a number and then you hunt for a table in the cramped space.  As is usually the case there are people left standing around stalking diners who look almost finished. \n\nOf note is that other than the community table, there are only maybe 4 tables that can accommodate a group of 4. I stood there for about 10 minutes with my eye on a large table with three girls who were done and sipping water.  At this point there were more people standing than sitting.  These gals seemed oblivious.  I decided to be smart and ask if I could just place my number on their table until our food was ready. The women looked at me as if I was the rudest person ever.  They looked at me and said, \"whatever\".  \n\nThen this girl comes up to me and says, \"You can't do that.  You have to wait.\"  I would have educated her in the fact that we had been waiting longer than anyone and passed at the smaller tables because we were a group of 4, but I could barely understand her and I'm not sure the sensible    complicated answer would have gotten past her scowl.  I just held up 2 fingers to indicate that she was only a group of 2 and pointed to 2 open seats at the community table which she obviously didn't want.\n\nEventually our drinks came and the three girls who were warming our seats got the signal to leave from the busboy.  I should mention in a previous visit a homeless lady went around asking people for money and food.  When I told the bartender, he looked at me as if I was an unsympathetic fool.  Look dude!  If I'm going to pay $9.50 for your burger, I don't need to smell people who smell like pee. \n\nAnyway the food came.  They have nice little milkshakes and fries. Burgers are nice and moist.  I get the Tejana burger with tortilla chips, avocado and a spicy salsa.   We also got the garlic fries and the zucchini onion stack. All colas are artisanal as well made with cane sugar.   \n\nDid I mention the ball game was on TV and given the dramatic finish only 2 other tables clapped at the finish!  You could hear louder cheers from the fancy restaurants down the street.  And as soon as the game was over they changed the station to a mixed martial arts match.  Didn't even wait for the postgame interviews.\n\nOverall the burgers are great.  The process and vibe is just not friendly or comfortable given the price you pay.  Our kids go to school in the area and say people everyone prefers the other lunch options on the street.  \n\nUnfortunately the restaurants on the street are becoming more for the dating crowd and  are becoming less family friendly.  My score has less to do with the food but more to do with the inconsistent experience.\n\nFor hipsters this is your place, but I think true natives will tell you there are other good similar burger options that provide a better experience.", "author": "Erik H."}

It also came with gruyere, watercress, caramelized onions, and avocado.   So needless to say, I didn't enjoy mine as much, and made him take more bites of mine.  I'm not sure why they would want to overpower the cheese and truffle fries with something so strong as dijon.  I liked his Heritage more, which was a little gourmet twist on a good classic burger filled with butter lettuce, fontina, caramelized onions, bacon and herb mayo.  Truffle fries were perfectly crisp, dusted with cheese and had enough of a truffle flavor.  Peter L. ordered the Trifecta for the whole table to share as well.  It consisted of regular fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini strings.  I definitely loved the sweet potato fries and zucchini strings.  \n\nWould I go back to Roam?  For sure if I was craving a burger and in the area.  I still like Super Duper more for simple \"quicker service\" burgers that's not McDonald's, Jack In The Box or the like.  I feel though however if I'm throwing down $10 for a burger here, I may as well pay a little more and go to Umami or NOPA though.  3.5ish stars.", "author": "Cat C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-05-18", "description": "Roam Artisan Burgers isn't your usual classic burger place. They take their burgers to a whole new level by using different meat (ie: bison and elk). However, for my first visit, I stuck with a traditional beef patty.\n\nA friend and I shared the \"Sunny Side\" and \"French and Fries\" style burgers, as well as the Fry-Fecta and a hazelnut chocolate (seasonal) milkshake. A complete meal, full of grease and deliciousness, satisfied the both of us.\n\nBe sure to grab plenty of napkins, as Roam's burgers are very messy to eat. The beef patties on both our burgers were cooked to a nice and juicy medium. The Sunny Side burger was a slight disappointment, mainly because the egg was cooked thoroughly, thus lacking the beauty of a runny, gooey yolk. But the juicy caramelized onions made up for it. The French and Fries burger was salty from the Parmesan fries, and rich from the gruyere cheese and avocado. The dijon mustard spread was a little too much, because a strong vinegary flavor was all I could taste in some bites.\n\nFor first-timers at Roam, I recommend the Fry-Fecta, which is a reasonable portion of all three of Roam's fries: classic medium/thick-cut russet potato, sweet potato, and zucchini onion haystack. And if you have a sweet-tooth, order a milkshake as well. They're thick, creamy, and so good! You're likely to be given your milkshake first, so try to avoid the immediate sugar rush by drinking all of the shake before your burger arrives at your table.\n\nService was friendly, and food took a reasonable amount of time to prepare after ordering, especially given how crowded the restaurant was on a weekend at noon. If the weather is nice, sit outside or at least near the open windows. The place is a little rustic with wooden tables and metal chairs, yet still retain a homey-feel. Roam also has an online-ordering system, for those who prefer to take their food to-go or to avoid the crowds.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

I feel bad about giving a bad score because I typically weight my score heavily on the level of customer service I received. Roam had great customer service but there were a number of things that happened at dinner that gave me a bad experience:\n1. I decided to be adventurous and got their autumn burger. It wasn't very good :/  they didn't even ask me how I like my meat. :( so my meat wasn't juicy but on top of that I just didn't like the taste \n2. They didn't have a blue moon and then offered me something else saying it tasted like blue moon and it SUPER didn't. \n3. This wasn't a big deal but I will have to mention that it was really crowded and I had no where to put my purse. I tried to put it on my chair but since the back was rounded- my purse wouldn't stay. I ended up having to put my $400 purse on the floor :( \n**dont judge me for my purse! We are in SF! That is normal purse cost. And price is relative!

The elk burger was notably leaner than a regular beef burger, but it tasted great and was very clean, not gamey.\n\nI had the burger Sunny Side style because eggs on burgers are like benedicts at Sunday brunch - my favorite things. It comes with caramelized onions and greens, which also add a sweet bite to the burger. My friends and I paired our burgers with the Fry-Fecta and it really made the meal. My favorite was definitely the sweet potato fries and the russets were my second fave. I'm not really sure about that haystack though - straight up zucchini fries or onion-rings would have been more in my boat.\n\nAll in all, great meal.

Their menu is HUGE! I ended up ordering a prickly pear soda and the Heritage burger. I shared the fryfecta with my boyfriend. \n\nPrickly Pear Soda ($2.99) - Very pretty, vibrant, and colorful. The taste is very sweet and syrupy but I'm told that this is one of their less sweet choices. I would have wanted a bigger glass with more soda in it. \n\nHeritage Burger ($8.50) - The beef of their patty is tender and juicy but not exactly flavorful. The flavors are from the toppings in the burger. The bacon they use is thick and smoky (I got 4 decent sized pieces). Butter lettuce was a nice tender touch though the herb mayo they use didn't impress me as much as I wanted it to. The bun they use is very buttery and soft. I enjoyed it but with a burger, I would have wanted a slightly sturdier bun. \n\nFryfecta - I don't recall the price of this one but I think it's around $6ish. You get three kinds of fries: sweet potato, regular potato, skinny zucchini-onion haystack. While impressive to look at, it lacked flavors. I think that's where the added toppings for fries come in.

One of my top 5 burger places to go to.\n\nI think I'm addicted to the chipotle habanero sauce. It's my kryptonite. With that sauce on any of the burger I get, I'm in heaven. All the burgers I've ordered here has been cooked to perfection. More on the medium rare. Never had any problem with that. Usually, I'm happy and content with a burger. My two favorite burgers are the sunny side elk burger and the pacific blue burger.\n\nOn some days, I like to binge eat. Which is a terrible thing for my tum tum and my petite figure which I'm trying to keep. Today was the day to binge eat, I tried the side salad and it was unbelievable. Most times, I don't like eating salad with any dressing because it is either too salty or overpowering. But this salad, the leaves were fresh and crunchy. Drizzled dressing on the salad made it a perfect combination in my mouth. Getting a side salad and burger is enough for lunch. Maybe getting a drink or a beer to wash it down it with.\n\nI always look out for the season soda. My favorite was the Blood Orange, however the new soda was Raspberry. It was delicious and refreshing, but not quite as good as the Blood Orange. I caved in today and finally got a shake. I was torn between Vanilla and Hazelnut. I should've got the Hazelnut because tons of people around me ordered that and my friend was raving about it. Instead, I got the Vanilla. It was still very yummy and satisfying.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-09", "description": "If you wander around San Francisco, you will more than likely stumble upon a gourmet, but fairly priced burger joint without looking very hard. I've been to quite a few myself and most of them don't differ much from one another. However, Roam Artisan Burgers stands out. Why? Because they are effective at keeping things simple yet delicious. Ultra fresh ingredients, quick execution of well conceived flavor combinations, and a menu that is easy to order from. \n\nBurger wise, they offer five proteins to use as your base (beef, turkey, bison, elk, and veggie), eight pre-constructed topping combinations, and the option to build your own. My favorite is the French and Fries with a ground beef patty, which comes with gruyere, avocado, caramelized onions, watercress, and truffled parmesan fries tucked inside the bun. An undeniably tasty burger, cooked to medium rare. In my opinion, the portion size is just right. With all the toppings, it makes for a solid meal, but isn't so filling that you'll want to skip your next meal or undo the top button on your pants to breathe after ingesting it.\n\nFor non-French fry purists, the fryfecta (a crispy combination of russet potatoes, sweet potatoes, and crispy zucchini ribbons) is the way to go. While I'm not typically an avid consumer of truffled fries, theirs are flavorful and subtle, generously topped with parmesan. Wash it down with a Strauss milkshake and you'll be bringing on the itis in no time. If you're trying to be mindful of the calories, the Farmer's market salad with red wine vinaigrette is tasty and you can add on a skewer of mini burgers of your choosing (my pick is turkey). You can also have any of their burgers wrapped in lettuce or a gluten free bun. Talk about accommodating! \n\nEach time I've dropped by, they have been doing good business. The environment is clean, sleek, and casual with shiny dark wooden tables, dim lighting, and industrial metal chairs. You place your order at the front, get your number, and your order will hit your table in good time. Even when there is heavy foot traffic, you're likely to get a table because it's more of a destination for a quick bite than a hang out. Because I like a little more light when I eat, I gravitate towards the seating near the window. They also have limited outdoor seating, which is perfect for the warmer months.  If you're dining alone, they have bar seating with a flat screen in view. If you are thinking of bringing kids along, know that they are welcomed warmly.\n\nWhen seeking a non-fussy, but satisfying burger, keep Roam Artisan Burgers in mind.

I felt great, but the rest of my party? Not so much. You know what always helps in that situation? An order of French fries. Or, how about an order of truffle Parmesan French fries? \n\nLook, you will need those (strictly construe the word \"need\" please, I'm not messing around). Those fries were mighty tasty, flavorful and perfect for sharing. I didn't notice that they had chipotle maple fries, or I would have ordered those as well. So good, and you know you need a lot of grease when you aren't feeling the best ever.\n\nI ordered the Heritage Burger with a (grass-fed) beef patty.  You have several options for meat at Roam, however: bison, elk or turkey (they have veggie burgers as well, for the meat adverse).  I'm not ashamed to say that I feel uncomfortable ordering elk or bison--because elks and bisons are pretty cute, even if they do taste good. I know cows are just as cute, but I feel less bad about ordering a beef burger--don't blame me, blame Texas. I'm told the bison burger is much better, but I'll just take my friends' word for it.  Bypass. \n\nAt any rate, Roam's Heritage burger was bananas. It had bacon, caramelized onion, fontina cheese, herb mayo (I'll allow it ONLY because it's flavored), butter lettuce and tomato. It was gargantuan, such that I could only eat one half, but my friends demolished theirs.  Not diet. \n\nRoam makes their own sodas. I ordered an orange one--it was not too sweet yet refreshing and satisfying. My friend ordered the Tahitian vanilla bean shake, child's sized. It was also yummy.  I was going to pick an argument with her about why she ordered the mushroom burger (because I obviously can't taste it since I hate mushrooms with a purple passion), but that's not nice when your friends don't feel good.

The white corn strips were basically chips, kinda like Fritos, which added a nice crunch. The burger was juicy like a watermelon! Yum! Plenty of free parking which is a plus since it's in the city. There is also, great dessert places nearby and plenty of coffee close for you coffee lovers out there ;). The gender neutral bathroom is nice and clean and they have a great interior.

We almost decided to eat on the sidewalk but the guy said he can clear a table for us so that won me over in regards to service and going above and beyond.  There was a sea of people waiting to order and waiting for their orders but they really do follow the first come, first serve practice. \n\nThe fries were seasoned perfectly and I loved that each one is crispy yet none were burnt or too crispy.  The highlight of my meal was in fact my burger.  Thanks to the fitness chick that I follow on IG, I was introduced to bison and sincerely love it.

You can't go around looking that delicious without me there. I ended up getting myself the French and Fries burger, because I can't say no to truffle fries. It's my one true weakness. This burger, was fantastic. I swear I could have gobbled it down quicker than silver. Their fries are like a holy trinity of awesome. Like, they give you an option to combine all three styles of fries into one. Is that not cool or what?\n\nReally, the only place where it gets a little sketchy is with how busy it gets. First come first served and you seat yourself. If people didn't linger like cranberries, then it'd be much easier to get seats here, but it's a heavy combination of both busy and small which makes seating tough. \n\nOther than that though, it's a fantastic spot to grab a meal.

Oh and trust me, I've eaten my fair share of burgers. \n\nUpon biting into my burger, I found they had messed up my order once again, similar to my last visit. I let it slide last time and didn't bother to flag down one of the employees, but this was my birthday, for crying out loud. If I wanted avocado, then I would have my avocado, no ifs, ands or buts.\n\nIt got up and approached one of the workers and told them of their wrongdoing. They returned with a condiment sized cup with sliced avocado in it. Umm, thanks?\n\nI also noticed a difference in their fries. Not only had they dramatically decreased in size since last summer, but they tasted very mediocre. They were once in steel or iron buckets, but were now being served in little cups, maybe a dramatic 50% decrease of their once portion size.

Ugh!\n\nSince yelp is putting my tips automatically in my review drafts, why not include them?! \n\nSo I am known to enjoy a nice juicy burger with a bunch of toppings. To me sometimes, the more the merrier! I don't normally eat the bun, so I'm making up for it?! Anyways, this is one of the reasons I wanted to check out Roam. I could add a bunch of toppings. I got the Tejano (no bun) with egg and bacon. (As indicated in my tip, they forgot the bacon.) My burger was nice and juicy, but was it worth $13.25 when they forgot the bacon?! Methinks not! My friend got the Sunny side. Again with forgotten bacon. Let me tell you, this burger is messy, so eat it fast before everything slips out of the bun. It was like a race against the clock! Lol!\n\nFor the price and the actual burgers, I would have given this place a 3 stars. But since they forgot my bacon AND I had to go to the back to get my shake. I'm giving them 2 stars.\n\nAnother note: The website says you can skip the line if you place and pay for it on the site. But since they had one line and one cashier, it really feels awkward cutting to the front, so I just waited in line. I did try to signal the cashier when I came back the 2nd time to grab my shake, but she was busy helping the customers in line.

Sadly, my Tejano Bison Burger: http://bit.ly/105chUK was just as disappointing as my elk one at their Marina location. Having high-quality ingredients is worthless if you can't properly cook it. And, a good burger is not a \"good\" burger without a good patty right?\n\nOn the menu, it's stated that all burgers are cooked \"medium\" unless told otherwise. Because of its low fat content, you CANNOT cook bison or elk the same way as you do beef. Once you overcook it, game over. Apparently, this location doesn't get it either as my bison patty was overcooked to a well-done NOT medium as stated on the menu. It was DRY so definitely request medium-rare if you order the bison or the elk here. I was hoping that the jalapeno relish and herb ranch sauce would give it some moisture but it got lost in the accouterments. I love the white corn trips though as it gave a delightful crunchy texture contrast. Adding the bacon saved the Tejano Burger as it added a rich, smoky layer. \n\nMr. NSS got the French and Fries Burger w/ Truffle Parmesan Fries, Gruyere, Avocado, Caramelized Onions, Watercress, Dijon Mustard. He said it was mediocre and just ate half. Now when have you ever seen a guy just eat half of his burger?\n\nThe best part of the meal was the Fry-Fecta:  http://bit.ly/1472UTM. I didn't touch the fries and sweet potatoes this time around but went savage status on the zucchini onion haystack. Deliciously crisp with a salty sweetness, the haystack was purely addicting. \n\n$13 for on overcooked bougie burger? No thanks...I rather save that money and put that in my Mr. Botox Me, Botox Me Not fund.\n\nP.S. - The BEST bougie burger in SF is at Spruce. It comes with duck fat fries for ONLY $16!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Unlike Marshall though, I really don't have a problem trying so many places along the way.  After all, part of the fun is the journey.  A journey that just so happens to involve some tasty burgers!\n\nCompared to SF's other popular burger joints (Umami, Super Duper, and Pearl's), Roam ranks near the top in almost every respect.  Not only is the vibe quite lively, but the menu is awesome.  Beyond the seven or eight pre-set burger combinations to choose from, you have the option of customizing a burger of your own (toppings vary from free to $1.50).  In addition, regardless of the burger you choose, you also pick the type of patty you want - beef, turkey, bison (A.Q.), or veggie.  Not bad!\n\n- HERITAGE BURGER (with Beef) - Applewood Smoked Bacon, Fontina, Butter Lettuce, Tomato, Caramelized Onions, and Herb Mayo...$8.25\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roam-artisan-burgers-san-francisco-3?select=rKsqVQXcTKySvoNQw26oaA#TBBxeJk8QrLkqE1wIBNbCA)\nIt's a little more \"classic\" than others, but a solid, solid burger.  The bacon, fontina, and onions were just about perfect and I really liked the bun they use.  It was a little oily/greasy overall, but not surprising given the bacon and how juicy the beef was.\n\n- FRY-FECTA - Russet Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, and Zucchini Onion Haystack...$5.49\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/roam-artisan-burgers-san-francisco-3?select=rKsqVQXcTKySvoNQw26oaA#z2vm16qNebpH089c0k18VA)\nEssentially a smorgasbord of fried sides, but it's a pretty tasty smorgasbord!  The russet and sweet potato fries were nicely crispy, but the haystack was my favorite - similar to onion strings, but thinner, better, and not all that heavy.\n\nTo help wash down their delicious burgers, Roam also offers a bunch of specialty drinks, like unique house sodas and milkshake concoctions.  However, after trying their pear soda (which didn't impress), the milkshakes might be the way to go based on what I saw other people getting and what other Yelpers have said.\n\nOverall, while I can't say Roam is the best burger I've tried so far in SF, they're definitely up there and ahead of their aforementioned competitors (though I think those three are pretty darn good as well).  I'll most definitely be back for more, even as my search continues!", "author": "Mike L."}

I don't know why more places don't have brie on burger...they go so well together.  This burger is well made and even though the ingredients aren't typically found in burgers, they work well together. The zucchini chip/fries in the frig fecta was the highlight.

Let me tell you the reasons why, when I am craving for a burger I go to Roam. Best part is you can choose your burger from bison, turkey, beef, veggie even elk. You can also choose your bun ...sesame seed bun, whole grain bun, gluten-free bun even lettuce wrap for an additional dollar. \n\nI always get the Fry Fecta which is a trio of the Zuchinni Haystack, Sweet Potato Fries and the Rusett Fries.  Crispy oily simply perfect fries to go with your burger.  The organic ketchup was icing on the cake.  I couldn't get enough.  \n\nBest burgers to get:\n~ Pacific Bleu Burger is my favorite, I love how the bleu cheese gave it that kick. The caramelized onions balanced out the zestiness of the cheese. The burger was juicy, oozing with flavor in every bite.  \n\n~ BBQ burger with aged white cheddar and bbq sauce, be sure to add the applewood bacon, smoky and sweet flavor with the Jalape\u00f1o Relish, Oil & Vinegar Slaw giving it a unique flavor.\n\n~ Heritage Burger with the applewood smoked bacon, fontina chees, caramelized onions and the mild but tangy herb mayo\n\nThe burgers are just right, not to big and not too small.  Service is fast and the cozy laid back ambiance of the restaurant makes it a good place to eat with family and friends. They have good shakes,the ones worthy of me packing on more pounds are the salted caramel shake and the Blue Bottle coffee shake!\n\nFood coma! Good night!", "author": "Maria M."}

This is likely due to the fact that the food is consistently delicious and I'm in such a food coma afterwards that I forget to write one!\n\nThe interior has plenty of seating, food doesn't take too long to arrive at your table, and sustainable products are used in their dishes. My favorite burger to order is their classic beef burger on a whole wheat bun. If I'm watching the carbs, I'll get it in a lettuce wrap. Their turkey burgers are juicy and flavorful, and on a recent visit I ordered their seasonal special: the Springtime burger that was absolutely scrumptious. You have your choice of protein and bun (or lettuce wrap) topped with Chimichurri, buffalo mozzarella, tomato, herb mayo, and arugula. Get it while they have it!\n\nThe sides are pretty tasty too. I usually split a side of sweet potato fries, and the only thing I wouldn't recommend here is the zucchini and onion haystack. The pieces aren't very easy to pick up (sliced SUPER thin) and they'd do better on top of a burger than as a side.\n\nThey have a nice selection of wines, beers, Boylan sodas, and house-specialty flavored sodas.

I've ordered the Heritage burger three times now and haven't been disappointed. It has thick slices of bacon and sweet caramelized onions.

Options are plentiful enough to have something for everyone yet simple enough that Roam is able to execute a really good meal.\n\nTheir milkshakes are crack. The salted caramel shake came before my actual meal. I didn't want to enjoy dessert before my burger but one curious sip led to an empty cup in 5 minutes.

It was located about 30 minutes from our hotel, and I wasn't sure if it would be worth the trek up and down the hilly streets of San Fran in 30 degree weather - but I was pleasantly surprised. \n\nYou get to choose from 4 patties - beef, turkey, bison or veggie.  You also get a choice of whole wheat, traditional sesame or gluten-free bun (or a lettuce wrap). You can build your own burger from a list of toppings or choose from a list of about 8 burgers. I chose the \"French and Fry\" beef burger on a traditional bun. The patty was topped with Gruy\u00e8re, caramelized onion, avocado, watercress and french fries. It was nothing short of amazing. The beef patty was juicy and cooked to perfection! The avocado added a creamy texture and the cheese and caramelized onion added a punch of flavour.  \n\nYou can also choose from side salads or fries (we went with the fries - obvs).  We actually tried what they call the \"fry-fecta\", which is a mix of Parmesan truffle oil fries (drool), sweet potato fries and zucchini fries (shredded zucchini that is deep fried - salty deliciousness). \n\nThe service was pretty quick (you order at the cash and they bring it to your table).  Although we were there around 4, as we hadn't yet adjusted to PST. \n\nTo top it all off, this place is reasonably priced! $9.99 for the burger and $6.95 for the \"fry-fecta\" (which can definitely be shared between 2 - 3 people). \n\nIf I'm ever in San Fran again, I will definitely return to Roam.", "author": "Stephanie M."}

He ordered the turkey burger with an egg, and I had their veggie burger. I loved that you could have your burger in any of their styles with just a change of the patty, makes being a vegetarian so much easier. \n\nRoam burger is almost chain like with a gastro edge...super hip, super busy, and super tasty. Definitely give this place a try, you'll thank me for it later.", "author": "Judy C."}

But wait - before you jump to conclusions - I would never categorize it as \"a burger joint.\" \n\nThis is a really nice place to hang out, with modern rustic decor (think: long wood tables, hanging lights). It's counter-service, but that's exactly fitting for the food and the atmosphere. And service has always been good. The only tricky thing is finding a seat on a busy night - it's a fend for yourself kind of place.\n\nFirst things first, the burgers are A-MAZING. You can choose your protein (beef, bison, elk, and I think turkey, salmon, veggie as well) and then select from a menu of suggested combinations - or build your own. You can pick from three different kinds of fries (or get all three in the \"fry-fecta\"). I've gotten the 'French and Fry' with bison both times, which has avocado, gruyere, dijon, fries, and I believe arugula. I got it on a lettuce wrap instead of a bun, and the burger was SO GOOD that I didn't miss it one bit. Everyone else got different burgers and loved theirs, too. No complaints from anyone - and no leftovers either!\n\nThe fries are good - I liked them all. I do wish there was another dipping sauce option besides ketchup, but that didn't seem to stop me from eating them. I've also ordered the daily veggie special both times, and the lemon/garlic brussels sprouts were HANDS DOWN the best brussels to ever grace my face. Even my veggie-hating guy friends were fighting over them!\n\nMilkshakes are great. Every flavor we've tried has been a winner, and I LOVE that you can get just a small size if you're feeling like having 'a taste' (or a medium, or a large...). \n\nSO pleased to have a good burger go-to in SF.", "author": "Catie F."}

Those three abovementioned businesses do not blend well in the area. \n\nBut the local Roam Burger Company has opened their second location on busy and family-friendly part of Fillmore Street. And Roam is the first gourmet burger business in that area. \n\nFor my debut of the new second location, I ordered the BBQ Bison Burger for $11.50. The BBQ burger is regularly cost $8.50. But the lean Bison meat costs an additional $3.00. The featured gourmet burger comprised the lean buffalo meat with melted white cheddar, caramelized onions, tangy BBQ Sauce and a hint of vinegar slaw in a puffy sesame bun. The Bison meat is very lean and a better alternative to my usual beef. I like!\n\nThere are no combo meals here and every item is sold separately. So I ordered a side of shredded zucchini and onion Haystack fries for $3.50. And I also ordered an iced-cold bottle of Scrimshaw Pale Ale for $5.00. My unorthodox-style continues when I inserted a handful of the shredded side into my burger. \"We eat like PIGS from where we're from!\"\n\nAs I was \"woofing down\" my burger like the Tazmanian Devil, I was browsing the busy streets of Fillmore Street. It was such a great view it was with many people walking up and down that busy street. \n\nI enjoyed the burgers and beverages from the original Union Street location very much. And congratulation to the owner for opening a second location, which happen to be a HUGE success. I hope the success will bring more locations in the future. I'll be there and support them for damn sure, when that happens.\n\nOh yeah, my meal: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4eaK2-Q0dEXWMr5SOoV_Sg?select=zUvktUZbaV7YA52pxVQerA#rKsqVQXcTKySvoNQw26oaA", "author": "Matt G."}

Here's the difference in experience:\n\nBison burger, classic: He downed this burger, and the comment I got was that \"it tasted more like beef than beef.\"  Not sure what that means, but he said it was lean, juicy and delicious... and he ate it pretty fast.  If you're a meat eater, you're looking out for your health and you won't sacrifice taste, go for the bison burger.\n\nVeggie burger, bbq: the quinoa/rice/beans/beets patty was not good.  Even the bbq sauce and condiments couldn't hide the fact that this veggie patty has a bad taste and texture.  Every bite was like biting into... only beets.  It tries hard and fails harder.  Reformulation!  This thing, compared to Houston's Hickory Burger (w/housemade veggie patty) is just no comparison at all.  I encourage you to give Houston's a try (Hickory style) and drop me a note.  Also, the fry bowl/basket thing with the three different fry types (sweet potato, haystack and russet) was blah as well.  Normally, I'm really into fries, but the russet fries were way too plain and the haystack fries are a joke.  They're like that stuff from a can that your friend from Iowa puts on top of his homemade green-bean casserole.  Bad idea - they have no place as a side, they should be piled on someone's burger only.\n\nOther things: it's a decent atmosphere, the people who work here are friendly and it's in a good area (Fillmore) with lots of shops, caf\u00e9s and people watching.

Well, my reaction to the burger I had tonight is probably what Marshall was looking for in that episode.\n\nI give to you: \"The Heritage\" (beef) w/ an Organic Free-Range Egg ($10)\n\nFirst off, \"The Heritage\" ($8.50) has Applewood Smoked Bacon, Fontina cheese, Butter Lettuce, Tomato, Caramelized Onions and Herb Mayo. I don't even like mayonnaise (at least I don't think I do), but Roam knows how to do it. \n\nThen, add an Organic Free-Range Egg (additional $1.50) to it. Or not... But, you'll regret it. Because who doesn't want breakfast on their burger? I mean, ask anyone. Breakfast. Burger. That b-power alliteration, man.\n\nBest food decision that I ever made. You're welcome.", "author": "Gabriela K."}

I would think for a speciality burger place they would have more created options, but was disappointed with only 7-8 or so.\n\nOrdered the French and fries burger and was disappointed. I heard it was one of their most popular but wasn't sure why.

The Tejano jalape\u00f1o relish was superb and the fries good, but nothing special. The ingredients used were definitely fresh and satisfying. However, upon inspection of our beef burgers, I was quite surprised and disappointed by the relative lack of burger. It immediately made me think it was a McDonald's patty... Thin, tasteless, not a man's burger. If I'm at a place that has \"burger\" in the name, I expect a real burger patty in my burger.\n\nA/P: A relatively nice place to bring friends for drinks and some food, but given the immense thinness of the burger, I could not bring myself to have friends here if they are hankering for a burger.

The burgers are bomb, especially the elk - they're cooked just right and the components (including the bun) are flat out heaven in yo' mouth. Ingredients are super fresh since they're of the farm-to-table kind and you can really taste it. Great meat to bun ratio, well constructed and packaged so it doesn't break apart when you eat it. It's awesome how after you eat it, you don't need a wet wipe the size of a beach towel to clean yourself off. \n\nThe only con is how much of a wallet burner a meal is. Beef burgers are $8 to $10 bucks, elk burgers are an extra $2. Fries can tack on another $4-$6 and a 12 oz shake  is $5.50. So if you want all three, that's easily $20+. On top of that there's a 4.5% \"surcharge,\" which I'm assuming is an SF mandated tax. So if you end up getting a burger, fries and a drink, you'll wind up w/ a tab in the upper $20s...and that's before tip if you dine in.

The BBQ come with aged white cheddar, BBQ sauce, caramelized onions, jalape\u00f1o relish, and oil and vinegar slaw. Truthfully, I mostly recognized the flavors of the BBQ sauce, cheese, and onions. The Tejano had pepper jack cheese, jalape\u00f1o relish, avocado, tomato, white corn strips, and herb ranch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-13", "description": "We came here this past weekend to try a new burger place, plus it was in the area of the Cherry Blossom Festival, which is where we were headed for the afternoon. The menu online looked great, and I was excited to try a new burger place and maybe add it to my list of \"awesome burger places to go\". The housemade sodas also looked great, as do the milkshakes (although I usually forgo the latter since they're a meal all by themselves).\n\nWe showed up at 1:30 pm, after the expected lunch rush, to find the place *packed*. This shouldn't be a surprise given the location (Lower Pac Heights / Fillmore). Tables were clearing out pretty quick though so we decided to stay and placed our order. We managed to grab a small two-seater table in a corner near the window.\n\nWhile this place is packed, I'll say this... it's *not* good for bringing kids into, when you're hauling in the extra large size stroller and big baby carriers. It really is that jammed up, there's not a lot of room to move your chair around and if you're pushing a stroller, good luck getting through the masses of people and squashed aisles. One guy came in with a baby carrier that took up an entire two-seater table. I have no idea where he expected him and his companion to sit with the baby on the table.  Keep this in mind if you're looking to find a place for you and your little ones, this place is a hazard to navigate.\n\nFinally, our food came out! We had two classic burgers (regular and veggie), a side of fries, and the housemade raspberry soda of the day. \n\nFirst off, the fries were really good. Unlike most fries I've had over the past few years, these were *really* potatoey in flavour. We ordered them plain and they were good as is or with ketchup. Yum.\n\nMy veggie burger was housemade and appeared to have beets as the primary ingredient (given the colour of the pattie). It was juicy and moist, but I found that I couldn't actually detect a pattie flavour... between the pickles, tomatoes and lettuce, it was just \"extra filling\" that I couldn't really discern out of the rest of it. It was a good burger overall but it didn't jump out at me. My companion agreed about his burger as well. We both felt that our meal was decent, but once you look at the price ($30 for two burgers, a side of fries and one drink) and the Artisan claim, you'd be expecting so much more.\n\nUltimately, that's all I can say about this place. It was adequate and decent, there was some pros to it, but between it just being an ok burger and how packed and squishy it is inside, I can't really rate it higher than two stars, not with there being so many other outstanding burger places in the city for a fraction of the price.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

All I need is a good burger in my belly!\n\nCame here around 6pm with my best friends and the line went out the door! But no worries, the line shortened down really fast though. I ordered a turkey french and fries burger (with no watercress and dijon mustard), truffle parmesan russet fries (extra .75 cents for  truff parm) and a prickly pear soda.\n\nSeating was packed indoors so we settled for outside seating by the heat lamp. The food came out in less than 10 minutes and I started digging in. The burger was P-E-R-F-E-C-T at the time because it was my first meal of the day (yes, at 6pm). The bun was soft, the turkey patty was super juicy and tender, the caramelized onions were on point, gruyere cheese added a nice salty taste to it and the sliced avocado was so buttery! \n\nThe truffle parmesan russet fries had a nice balance of crunch and soft texture to it but it lacked a balance of flavors. The fries were overly seasoned with salt and parmesan in which made it really hard to eat (so salty!) My friend on the other hand got the truffle parmesan sweet potato fries and it made me regret my choice. The sweet potato balanced out the saltiness of the parmesan. Definitely recommended!\n\nThe prickly pear soda was definitely an interesting item that I got here. If you're not familiar with what a prickly pear is, it's basically an egg sized fuchsia colored fruit found on cacti. The soda is made from scratch here and not from a bottle or can! The soda didn't actually taste like the fruit but rather a sour melon taste it. It was good so I'm not complaining!\n\nI can't wait to come back here again! :)\n\nTips:\n-Seats are limited here so make sure you keep an eye out for people who are leaving their tables! \n-Get sweet potato fries when you want to make them truffle parmesan.\n-Try the house-made sodas! Prickly pear and caramelized pineapple sodas are *recommended*", "author": "Anna H."}

Burgers come out fast and the minute you take a bite of them, you're in heaven. Their fries are also great, as well - it's necessary that you order some with your burger!\n\nAt Roam, you order at a cashier and then you have to find your own table, so seating can be a bit of a pain, especially when it's super crowded. Just make sure you keep an eye on people that are finishing up their meals - the minute they get up, claim your spot because otherwise somebody else will snatch it from you.\n\nBesides that though, this is still one of my go-to places in SF and the quality of the burgers is so overwhelmingly good that I don't mind waiting for a table at all.", "author": "Trisha V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-13", "description": "Burgers are delicious and have their own special rating system in my book. You want to see if someone's cool and \"hang out\" with them/possibly make it your first date? You want Super Duper, because that's a quick lunch. Once you have assessed that they are second-date material, you take them to Roam, because it is a step above Super Duper, it's more intimate, and it's the place where everyone else seems to be having some kind of second-date conversation. There's a lot of two-seaters. You can kind of tell what's going on here.\n\nRoam is actually my favorite burger place. Now, Umami is definitely a \"keeper\" kind of burger place, because some people, like myself, cry when they take a bite (and then get sick because the burger was too good, too delicious, and much too rich for my poor stomach to handle). But when it comes to a burger place that I prefer, it's Roam. I can order online, I can have the boyfriend tuck and roll to pick up the food, and BAM, burgers and fries, done.\n\nThe Tejano is my go-to burger. I had the turkey burger version of it, mainly because I was feeling extra lazy and knew that a delicious, beautiful, wonderful beef burger would have been too much for that day. Surprisingly, it was pretty good. I'm definitely happy to have a burger that can be successfully turkey'd without sacrificing too much flavor or making me feel like \"but I could have had a beef burger ugh\".\n\nWe always get one order of fries to share between us both - it's almost always pushing the limit with the burger and the single order of fries. And also we get a kid's milkshake to share, which sounds dumb, but those milkshakes are densely delicious and could get overly sweet with anything larger. This combination of food is always perfect, and we leave feeling satisfied and just roly-poly enough that we can walk it off for the most part, and not so rotund that we feel like we'll be rolled into the street by accident.\n\nDefinitely my go-to burger place in terms of places close to the apartment. Grabbing a table can be hard despite the quick turnaround, so we usually pick it up and take it to go unless a table is open. Don't bring kids as the crowd is generally not kid-friendly...not on purpose, but I think it's just by principal. Too many second dates going on, you know?", "author": "Robbin A."}

My friend had the blood orange soda which was fizzy, tart, and delicious! \n\nThe burger buns were nicely toasted, but the fries inside were not particularly truffled (I picked them out to eat). The burger tasted good as a whole, until halfway through when I realized how overwhelming the Dijon mustard got. All I could taste was horseradish.

The idea of a \"farm to table\" place is a great concept, although some places use this idea to justify higher prices.  I think that Roam does an awesome job of providing great high quality, local, tasty, fresh food at a reasonable price.  \n\nThis time I ordered the Heritage burger and my wife ordered the Sunny Side.  We got a Fry-Fecta and my wife ordered a Prickly Pear soda.  I loved my burger, the bacon gave it a nice smoky flavor and I love the buns they use!  It was a little messy with juices running everywhere and required the use of about 10 napkins, but shouldn't good, juicy burgers be messy?  The Sunny Side was awesome as well, I'd have to say I liked it a little better than mine.  The egg on the burger was a nice touch, but I loved how the sweet chili sauce gave it a bit of a tangy flavor.  The Fry Fecta was awesome as usual.  The sweet potato fries are the best, but I love all three!  Prickly Pear soda was good, nice to have a unique flavor to mix things up.\n\nThe place can get a little crowded, especially around meal time, but the tables turn over quick.  This can be a tough place for a large group, but there are communal type tables/benches where a group can sit as well.  Overall, a great meal at a great price.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-02-10", "description": "So, Greg and I ventured up to Roam after hearing from a variety of people how incredible it was, how it could be compared (or even better) than Umami Burger, and how this was a must-visit place on Fillmore.  Being that Greg and I both loved Umami, have a deep sentiment for Super Duper, and will always have a soft spot for In N Out, this was obviously a place we needed to visit.\n\nWe stopped by on a Saturday night, and didn't do too much research leading up to this in terms of what to expect or what to order.  We called ahead of time to ask what the wait would be (this becomes more important later on in my review), and was pleased to hear that there was no wait.  When we walked into Roam, there was a line that ended right as you walked through the door.  The place was busy, and I think I was the most overdressed person there since most people were there in their jeans, North Face jackets, and yoga pants.  As we moved up towards the registers, it occurred to Greg and I that you had to order at the register, ala Super Duper style.  I won't lie, I panicked when it was our turn to order, so I sided with Greg and got the Heritage burger with bison meat.  I also ordered the Blood Orange soda that's made in house, and Greg and I split the Fry-Fecta.  Not a huge deal, but I mistakenly called the bison meat \"buffalo\", and was corrected by the girl at the register who said, \"It's BISON, not buffalo\".  OK. Cool. Thanks...rude.\n\nWe got our table number and sort of stood around not really knowing what to do.  Greg and I were sort of confused on what we should be doing, and finally realized that there wasn't going to be any wait service here.  Luckily we were able to snag a table in the back corner, and sat down immediately.  Our drinks came out almost right away, and just a few 15 minutes later, the food showed up.  The Fry Fecta was AMAZING.  This was probably my favorite part of dinner.  The burger, in my opinion, left a lot to be desired.  The burger was SOAKED in grease, where the bottom bun was completely soggy.  I resorted to trying to eat it with a fork since holding the burger was too messy and too greasy.  The blood orange soda was sweet, but I usually never order soda.  That being said, I drank the whole thing :)  The whole meal from start to finish was about 20 minutes.  It started to get busier after we were done, so there was the underlying pressure of needing to leave as soon as we were done.  If you wanted to order another drink, you had to go back to the register and order.\n\nI guess the part that both Greg and I determined was that for $40, we would have expected something a little better than a no wait service, help yourself type place.  The feeling of feeling somewhat rushed to get out of the restaurant left a lot to be desired.  I guess this is the part where doing some research on the place probably would have been critical, but this wasn't really what we had in mind.  I think next time if we're looking for a quick, great tasting burger with no wait service, we'll go to Super Duper.  If we're looking for the gourmet experience and willing to pay the premium for it, we'll head back to Umami.  In my opinion, Roam sort of fell in the gray space of in between the two, and I'm not really sure if it totally works in my mind.", "author": "Lisa I."}

I usually get the same thing each time (although I have tried almost everything on the menu), but look forward to it every single Thursday nonetheless. And here is why - \n\nThe veggie lettuce-wrapped Tejano burger is a fiesta in your mouth.  With fresh avocado, tomato, tortilla strips and jalapeno relish, it is the equivalent of a taco salad in a burger.  If that's your cup of tea, then try it, and you will not be disappointed.  It is also relatively guilt-free, so go ahead, grab that milkshake you've been thinking about.\n\nOther burgers are just as good. I cannot attest to any of the meat options, but my friends seem to enjoy them (especially the bison).  My other personal favorites are the BBQ (the caramelized onions are oh so good) and the Chalet (mushroom perfection).  I enjoy the Sunny side (w/ egg and cheddar) but do not enjoy it running down my hands. \n\nOther offerings: the seasonal salads are great! Personally, I think the tri-fecta is a little on the heavy side, but great for sharing.  I like the side of the sweet potato fries or the russet fires with the parmesan toss, although the amount I get tends to vary each and every time (and not by a little).

Not gonna lie, it was a bit weird at first because 1)  the patty was a squishy, 2) it was PINK, and 3) it didn't have the same texture or structure as a regular patty.

It's quick, convenient, pain-free, and delicious. Yes, you really can have it all!\nThe ordering website is easy to navigate, complete with a box to write in any special instructions (pickles on the side? hold the tomatos? your pickiest friends will not have any problems here!!). You can build your own burger, or try some of their artfully crafted combinations, adding as many extras as you please. Then, they will give you an estimated time when your order is ready for pick up! \n\nThe burgers themselves are fairly substantial. And rightly so, for almost $10 a pop. The buns were thick, untoasted, and had quite a bit of chew to them. I personally prefer my buns a bit more light and fluffy, but to each their own. \n\nand get the Fri-fecta! hahahah so clever.

Finding a seat was a challenge at the busy time of dinner (around 7:30ish), but we slipped into a vacated spot after a few minutes of lingering. The line out the door comes and goes - don't get discouraged if it looks long, just give it 15 minutes!\n\nOur burger was delicious. I only have good things to say about it:) We shared because we wanted to try multiple menu items,  but I could have easily eaten a whole one...I just would've been uncomfortably stuffed! \n\nBoth fries initially came out lukewarm which is a pet peeve for my aunt. We sent those back and a few minutes later got a piping hot sleeve of regular fries. For some reason the sweet potato fries were never quite hot - I guess they just didn't have a fresh batch available. Regardless, they were nicely salted, thin fries.\n\nThe salted milkshake was pretty good. Not orgasmic, but still a good dessert. The guy behind the counter was no help at all when I was deciding which milkshake was the best...so I had to take a blind shot in the dark from his \"they're all good\" response.

Just like the beloved old 1950s malt shops, right? Well, no.\n\nThe staff is very friendly. The wait for food can be extended due to the crowded conditions. Roam is noisy and you'll find yourself cheek-by-jowl with other diners. The burgers are not so exceptional, but good. The fries just about perfectly crispy, and the shakes, belched forth from a machine rather than scooped and assembled the old-fashioned way, are actually sinfully good.\n\nBut here's my problem.

I guess it's because I didn't want to be part of the chaotic crowds that I see whenever I pass by.  Well, today was a different story. I had no choice. This lunch was planned a week ahead by a couple of my co-workers who had eaten here already and could not stop raving about it since. \n\nNow mind you, I'm pregnant and the sterotype of my people is that we'll eat anything that comes our way. I was NOT in the mood for burgers but as a good teamplayer, I joined in on the party. My mood changed as soon as I bit into my burger. \n\nI, personally, ordered the French and Fries, which consisted of turkey, avocado, gruyere cheese, spinach or argula (I forget), and fries. No drink, just water, and no sides. My total was $9.22. The meat at Roam are 100% grass fed and is their #1 selling point. \n\nThe flavor was fresh, the texture, perfect. I was caught off guard with the fries inside the burger (I forgot that it was part of it), but was pleasantly surprised with how it blended nicely with the gruyere cheese. With each bite, I was impressed. My mood switched from not wanting a burger to loving what I was eating. I think I kept nodding with every 10 bites I took. My plan was to wrap half of it up and take it home to the hubbs, but that didn't pan out, I finished that whole thing. \n\nMy co-workers ordered a \"Trifecta\" for appetizers before I arrived. The Trifecta consisted of french fries, fried zucchini strips and fried sweet potato fries. Delish. It was fun to eat the zucchini strips.\n\nAfterwards, when you eat something heavy, you feel nasty and need to take a trip to the restroom STAT, but not this place. Everything was fresh it seemed and my body seems to take to it nicely; I'm full, but not feeling like I have to go to sleep or guilty about the crap I ate.  \n\nWhat I like about this place is that you first have to order your burger at the register and choose your choice of meat (beef, turkey, bison and vegetarian (tofu??) and then choose your style of burger.

Based on the food, the Roam would be getting 4 stars. But based on the service, I would be giving it 2. \n\nIt is clear these guys know how to make a burger. The patties are a little rare for my taste, but it is delicious. It is not overly greasy. The ingredients are fresh. Not the best burgers I have had in the bay area, but enough for me to come back for a second time. And the shakes...arguably the best shake-and-burger combination I have ever had. I had a sunny side up burger with house sauce (which is thousand island) and a chocolate shake with the toasted marshmallow. The total was a little over $16 with tax. No fries (if you don't get them you're not missing out on much). My girlfriend had the elk burger. It was all right; I'd prefer the beef.\n\nThere are some things you should know, however, if you plan on going to the Fillmore location.\n1. Try to avoid peak hours. And if you are the interior designer of this location, take your right hand and smack yourself. Claustrophobic people here during peak hours will LITERALLY go mentally insane. We sat at a bar because we could not get a table. EVERY person walking by either swiped my back and just downright shouldered me. The aisles are practically nonexistent unless you're ok playing bumper chairs with people around you. At peak capacity, I am sure this place violates every fire rule in the books. \n\nAlso, if you are here at peak hours, sit outside or sit near the open window. There is absolutely no air flow towards the back. And if the kitchen explodes, you're the first one out.\n\nKeeping this in mind, we came in at 2pm on a Sat. and the place was packed. At 3pm, it cleared out significantly.\n\n2. Service is $hit. Because it was so hot I took off my sweater, and I ended up misplacing it by the end of our meal. Somebody stole it. I went to the bar/ordering area and a baboon could have given me a better attitude with the whole ordeal. The woman who was my cashier before we ate; you are the exception.\n\nPersonally, I won't come back to this location.

Btw, This is not a full service restaurant- you order at the cashier and they will bring you your food but that's it. You take your glass up to the bar if you want a refill, you get your own silverware, napkins, etc. Like a fancy Smashburger. Everything we had there was good. Highly recommend the veggie or salad of the day too. Milkshakes made from Strauss family farm ice cream. Seating is not abundant but there is a long community table and a few 2 tops and fewer 4 tops.

I thought that Roam was pretty solid - good flavors, not too long a wait, and actually a few bucks cheaper than DMV area places.  I got the French and Fries burger with Gruyere, avocado, caramelized onions, watercress, dijon mustard, and topped with truffle Parmesan fries - messy (avocado is slippery), but very good.  The fries (sweet potato with herbs and more truffle Parmesan fries) were also good.  I was torn between the fancy shakes and the fancy sodas, and ended up trying the caramelized pineapple soda.

Kathleen got a caramel shake which was also divine- but naturally, on such a lovely and perfect San Francisco day we needed sweet potato fries to top it off. Sweet potato anything is perfection in my book.  Anyway, the shakes had chocolate scrapings on top and were absolutely delicious as we savored our high calorie drink delights at our window seat. \n\nWe probably walked 2-3 miles that day (being very optimistic here) and burned off the shakes as fast as we consumed them.

Service, such as it is, consists of your ordering at the entrance, being given a number so that your food will find you, and your finding a place to sit.  At 5 PM on Saturday evening finding a place to sit was not a problem.  They bring the food and when you are finished they take away the empty plates.  \n\nThe farmers market salad is fresh and immense.  It is easily well suited for sharing by two or three people.  As I worked my way through the mountainous salad it occurred to me that the only way to improve on this would have been to have had a some black olives in the mix. \n\nThe heritage burger was very good with bacon and fontina cheese that nicely balanced the beef.

I ordered the Pacific Blue and all the flavors were outstanding - blue cheese (great if you like a strong cheese), watercress (brought freshness to the burger), caramelized onions, tomato, and a really delicious sauce. And of course the patty was cooked a perfect medium rare. The burger size is perfect too. You feel full after you finish it but not overly so. It really hit the spot. All the other combos sound super appealing. My sister ordered the Tejano - the slight kick of pepper jack and southwest flavors left me unable to decide which burger I enjoyed more.\n\nThe russet fries are run-of-the mill and the herb topping (you get to choose from 3 different ones) was unevenly spread.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-03", "description": "Options options options! Roam takes the pretty basic concept of burgers + fries and makes it feel a little classier and a little healthier. We had the French + Fries with a beef burger, the Classic with bison, and the Heritage with bison. The burgers on the first two were a little under-done, but a few days later when we got the Heritage it was perfect, tender bison. The French + Fries is topped with truffle-Parmesan fries, gruyere, avocado, caramelized onions, and watercress. It's a whole meal packed into one burger! I added fontina to the classic and it came with a basic bun, Bibb lettuce, and the special house sauce. The Heritage with bison has bacon, fontina, and caramelized onions, in addition to some seasoned mayo sauce and a hint of rosemary. \n\nThe burgers are deliciously flavorful and all meat is free-range and locally raised. They even list what farm your protein comes from! You can choose from beef, turkey, bison, house-made organic veggie, or a seasonal meat (elk right now. There's an up-charge for bison and elk.). The only problem with the burgers is that the sauces are so creamy that they make the buns soggy and the burgers fall apart for the last 1/2 or 1/3. They do have gluten-free options, including a lettuce wrap. Yum!\n\n\nThey also have awesome veggie options. The house salad has mixed greens, pomegranate seeds, pepitas, rainbow carrots, and a choice of vinaigrette or herbed ranch. It's so delicious! The Fillmore location also is doing Brussels sprouts with Parmesan, chili flakes, and lemon - and lots and lots of butter. They are tasty and delicious, but definitely on the greasy side. \n\nRoam is a great spot for a casual meal or snack, and the conscientious consumers out there will appreciate their dedication to buying food that is grown and/or raised humanely to the earth and the animals. Everything is a la carte, so your bill can add up quickly, but we found it to be totally worth it. \n\nA couple of tips:\n* if you like your bacon on the crispier side, ask for we-ll-done bacon on the heritage. It basically melts in your mouth. \n\n* the milk shakes are made with locally raised milk and have amazing flavors like blue-bottle coffee and salted caramel. Stop counting calories and just do it!\n\n* you can request your burger bun a little crispier. I'd recommend it.", "author": "Marianna G."}

You basically go in, pick your protein, and then choose you're style - this includes toppings, sauces, etc. I got the sunnyside, which includes an egg and cheddar. It was pretty good, I wish the bread was a little firmer (it's pretty soft and gets softer as it soaks up the sauces they put on it) and the portions here are a little small. I knew this coming in, so I got the fry-fecta to split. It has their russet fries, sweet potato fries, and onion hay. I got the russet fries with their truffle topping, which is fantastic. The onion hay was great too, and the sweet potato fries are a decent option.\n\nSome notes on the different burgers styles (there are a lot to choose from):\n\nThe french and fried sounds really good, but they only add a few fries as a burger topping, so you don't really get to taste them as you eat it.

We ordered a fry-fecta which comes with zuchinni fries, sweet potato fries, and regular fries. I could definitely not finish this if I ordered one for myself with my burger. I had the Tejano beef burger, and I liked it much more than the french fries burger I had last time. I added the free buttered lettuce too. I don't like that the avocado would be on one side of my burger and the corn chips on another side, I wish it was spread more evenly around the burger. It's messy to eat, but delicious! And to top it off, the mint chocolate chip shake I ordered was the best thing I had that evening. Perfectly tasting with small mint chips that was delicious to crunch on when drinking it.

There are a few \"pre-designed\" burgers to choose from or you can create your own however be aware don't get carried away with things on the burger otherwise you will loose the flavor of the meat under ingredients. Burger size is certainly small for the money you pay but the flavor does make up a bit for the size. We had a sunny side up burger and the heritage burger. The sunny side egg was well cooked with yellow yolk oozing out, I suggest to eat this one with knife and fork or plenty of napkins. The beef was grilled well but just an average beef patty, nothing amazing. The heritage burger was good with crispy bacon topping an elk patty and molten cheese, elk was good but not as gamey taste as the staff make out it is. Also excessive that you have to pay extra for elk or bison. The bacon made the heritage burger without that it would just be another burger. The milkshakes here are great with organic ingredients and nice smooth flavor. The truffle and Parmesan fries are a bit of a joke, couldn't taste any truffle and the Parmesan was grated onto the fries after cooking but didn't melt and stick so they ended up just being fries. I think roam has a great concept and some brilliant possibilities for burgers but the execution falls short of the mark. If the staff were friendlier, product was bigger for the money, the \"game\" meat tastes like game meat and the truffle fries actually had truffle, cooked in truffle oil or even just tasted like truffle, it would be five stars but due to these minor issues only 3/5.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-06-19", "description": "If I ever hear these overused modifiers--\"artisan\" or \"gourmet\"--thrown casually next to the word \"burger\" again, one can be sure I'll run away as far as I can possible to the closest ma-and-pa grease joint to quell my cravings for the metonymical sandwich of American culture. I can care less that pretentiously overpriced burgers have been in vogue for the past decade. What's more nauseating than the gut-churning effects of eating a Big Mac is how the bourgeoisie burger hides its mediocrity beneath a veneer of superfluous, highfalutin ingredients, e.g., opting for Double Gloucester with Stilton in lieu of standard cheddar, thus casting aside intrinsic taste and substance. For anyone who thinks I'm a raving mad man for this diatribe, he or she can attribute it to my experience at Roam Artisan Burgers last week. \n\nAlthough this place easily deserves four to five stars for decor and ambience, the burgers at Roam were a major letdown: They did not live up to the hype or its ratings on Yelp. More importantly, Roam violates the three unwritten rules that prescribe burger perfection: adequate meat, meat-to-bun ratio and bun texture. \n\nFirst, a gourmet restaurant charging exorbitant prices for a burger should offer an ample portion of meat--at least a juicy 1/3 lb. meat disk to mitigate the pain of wallet deflation. The size of a Roam patty disappointingly weighs somewhere between an In & Out patty and a Five Guys patty. Second, when the bun is two times the size of the meat, every bite leaves a dissonant aftertaste wherein the mouth regrets having to chew through disproportionate chunks of bread in order to taste the meat. The silver lining to this unsatisfactory meat-to-bun ratio, perhaps, is sandwich integrity (although it's not commendable if the burger's integrity can only be attributed to scanty ingredients). Third, the bun looks and tastes ordinary, lacking in the subtlety of a multi-grain bun or the buttery richness of a brioche. This bread simply resembles a prototypical sesame seed bun used for a 4th of July backyard outing. \n\nAmid the burgeoning rate of burger bastardization in the land of the free and home of the burgers, let's hope this same virus doesn't spread to other American classics like apple pie anytime soon.", "author": "Samuel M."}

They're very accommodating to large groups, helping to seat around twenty people on my friend's birthday, but I wouldn't recommend doing that on the regular.

The place was PACKED for a Wednesday night. It was cramped, dimly lit, and crowded -- a hipster's dream come true. I hate when restaurants have that feel. The menu is plastered on the wall as you walk in, but there were people in line covering a few of the options. On a whim, I chose the \"Sunny Side Up\" burger with a veggie patty. After about a 20 minute wait, I received my meal. And the taste.... YUUUUUCCK!!! \n\nWhile I appreciate a restaurant that offers a freshly made veggie patty as opposed to a Boca or Garden Burger, if their interpretation of a veggie patty is awful, I'd just rather have the aforementioned frozen options because their freshly made patty was a disgusting disaster. I've personally made veggie patties. They are not hard to execute well. At first I didn't even think it existed! It was way too wet and soggy and mushy to even be considered a \"patty\" - more like a mushy spread. In turn, this made the bun super soggy and wet as well. One thing I didn't notice while ordering was this particular menu item offered sweet chili sauce as a condiment. Really!!! Sweet chili sauce on a burger?!?! Mixed in with tomatoes and cheese left an utterly disgusting flavor in my mouth.\n\nIf you want to be a pretentious artisan burger joint, you're not going to win people (or me) over by just randomly tossing ingredients into a burger and calling it gourmet.\n\nThis was by far the worst veggie burger I've ever had.

We opted to skip the french fries on the burger, seeming a bit excessive with the three types of french fries in the Fry Fecta (three types of fries: truffle, sweet potato, zucchini). The burger was juicy and flavorful, just as it should be. The bun was solid - not the best bun ever, but it held its own. The three types of fries were all awesome as well, and great to be able to switch between them. \n\nSecond, we got the Chalet Veggie burger (Swiss, Cremini Mushrooms, Watercress, Tomato, House Sauce). Probably the best veggie burger we've had. It is made from beet, portobello mushroom, and quinoa; it was also juicy and flavorful, which is not always a given with a veggie burger. Even if you aren't a vegetarian, the veggie burger is highly recommended - maybe even more so than the beef burger.\n\nWe were able to walk right in at 7pm on a weeknight, order for takeout, and leave within 15 minutes.

After we passed by Roam Artisan Burger's, we decided to make a quick U-turn and stick with Burgers for lunch. We got lucky with close street parking.\n\nAs we walked in, the first thing one notices is the tree bark table / bar area.  The menu was nicely posted on the right -- easy to read and understand.  There was a wonderful variety of burgers to choose from (as well as salads) and everything looked so appealing.  After placing our orders, we received the burgers in 10 minutes.\n\nI ordered the French & Fries burger. My burger was tender and juicy. It was almost perfect. My patty lacked a tad bit of seasoning but the availability of the sauces (ranch, honey mustard,...), perfected the ingredients. I love the concept of fries INSIDE my burger.  The burger was pretty thick, resulting me in using utensils, and yet somewhat messy. But, I DID scarf down every bite. Defiantly the best burger I've had. We also ordered a side of Fry-Fecta. It was the perfect combination of regular fries, sweet potatoe fries, and onion fries.  VERY delicious and the highlight of this establishment  - and I didn't even need ranch as my side topping. \n\nI also ordered a strawberry shake. The shake was really thick, just the way I like it! Very fulfilling. A 16 oz shake can easily take care of 2 people. The shake came out after our burgers, a little late, but not complaining. It is hand-made and made with real fresh strawberries.

Last night, he treated me to dinner there. Business was booming, and the line was out the front door, but it didn't take long for it to move along.\n\nRoam's menu consists of many different kinds of burgers. The first thing you need to decide is whether you want beef, turkey, bison, veggie, or their special (last night it was elk). Then, you choose from one of eight styles. Classic, French and Fries, Tejano, Sunny Side, Heritage, Chalet, Pacific Blue, and BBQ. Classic costs $6, but $7 with cheese. The others are $8. They also have a variety of fries including Russet, Sweet Potato, and Zucchini Onion.\n\nA meal with a Classic-style burger, fries, and a drink comes to around $13.\n\nOnce you order at the counter, you'll receive a number and they'll bring it to your table when it's ready. It was really busy last night, so it took roughly 20 minutes for our food to arrive. Burgers were on plates and fries were in a metal basket.\n\nI took one bite and was in love. Died and went to Burger Heaven. The white corn strips on my burger added a great crunchy texture. The ranch sauce was yummy and the pepper jack with jalepe\u00f1o relish added a nice kick.\n\nThe thing I was most surprised about was that the burger stayed completely intact the whole time.

Roam Artisan Burgers fits perfectly in the Pac Heights neighborhood, boasting organic and local ingredients. They offer a number of signature burgers, as well as the option to customize your own. I had the Sunny-Side burger with a turkey patty, and was surprised at how moist the patty was, as opposed to the typically dry burger you get for any beef alternative. The fried egg added a little extra protein, and the white cheddar was extremely flavorful. Although the sweet chili sauce was slightly too sweet for me, the burger as a whole was one of the best burgers that I've had in awhile. The fry-fecta is also a good way to get a sampling of their three types of fries - sweet potato, regular, and zucchini and onion shoestring. Their fries aren't too greasy, and stay crispy throughout the meal. The shoestring fries are more unique, but they do end up feeling a little heavier because the you get more fried breading than zucchini or onion. They also have an extensive milkshake menu, and the meal was finished off perfectly with a Blue Bottle coffee milkshake.

Normally, I would have gone for the meat options since they are free-range and grass-fed, but I had to try their house veggie burger recipe. Now I think it may be one of my favorite veggie burgers by far. So glad this place is right down the street from our house! With such reasonable prices for great quality, I'm sure we're going to be regulars. \n\nIt was unlike any veggie burger patty I've seen. It's not like Boca or Gardenburgers ... or the flour-y concoctions I've seen either. It sort of smells like a falafel. The color is between a bright pink and red (I felt manlier than my boyfriend eating his beef burger w/bacon because it looked like I had a super rare burger patty!) ... the texture is really unique, resembles ground beef in a creative way without feeling artificial. I had mine as a build-your-own, all the free topping veggies with ketchup and mustard on a *whole wheat bun* (yay! There are options!). Next time, I'll try the house sauce. Just wasn't feeling like a thousand island-type sauce today. \n\nMy boyfriend got a beef burger with cheese and bacon. He wanted to go here in the first place because he walked by and noticed that the bacon in the burgers looked really impressive. In his words, \"the bacon brought me here, it got me to stay here, it will bring me back!\" They did look like good, thick pieces of bacon with a lot of red and very little fat. He loved his burger too. \n\nWe also tried the \"Fri-fecta\" - the fry trio sample, which comes with regular fries with garlic and herbs, sweet potato fries, and very thin, curly shavings of zucchini and onion. All of them were amazing. I like to make a concoction of ketchup, black pepper, and hot sauce ... the hot sauce Roam has was amazing! It will be hard to pass up getting the Fri-fecta again next time we're there. \n\nAlso had a side salad, which was decent. It was just mixed greens and tomatoes ... a bit of carrot shavings would have been perfect ... maybe some onion too ... but for $2.99? $3.99? (don't remember), I'm just happy to have gotten some greens with my meal. \n\nTheir beer selection is impressive. \n\nThe service was great. \n\nLove that the inside has this cool saloon-type feel to it. The lighting is cool. I got a splinter trying to find a trash can near where the condiments are, but it's cool, the quality of the meal was worth it. \n\nWhile we were waiting for our burgers to arrive, we noticed it's right across the street from Johnny Rocket's, another burger place. So we thought, wow, this place is pretty ballsy, opening up right across from the other main burger place in the area ... nope. They've got us hooked. We've never been to Johnny Rocket's, but we'll be coming back here a lot.", "author": "Dyne S."}

Even their ketchup is organic.\n\nMy favorite burgers are the Classic, Sunnyside, and French and Fries.  \n\nOn the Classic, it's only lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles but all the ingredients are so fresh.  I never eat pickles in my burger but their homemade pickles are my favorite.  After eating this burger, I never feel bad about wolfing down a burger.\n\nThe Sunnyside has a fried egg, cheese, chili sauce, etc.  The egg is cooked over easy/medium so the yolk is oozing over your burger, in a good way.  It's probably the messiest burger I've eaten but so worth it.  If you are on a date...not a good idea to order.  If you are alone or with friends, a must try.  It's delicious.\n\nFrench and Fries.  Honestly, truffle fries in a burger doesn't sound that great to me.  But, my husband ordered this.  Now, I crave it.  I love the taste of truffles.  All the ingredients in the burger bring out the truffle flavor and compliment each other.  Who ever created this burger is a genius!\n\nThe russet fries are also good.

If I had gotten a burger and the patty was the size of my turkey burger, I wouldn't have been very pleased.  However, with the egg, amazingly sauteed onions, and avo, my turkey burger really hit the spot.  The shake was also awesome and the truffle fries were divine.  I'll go back for sure.  I'll probably stick to the turkey burger, but we'll see.", "author": "Shannon B."}

The food here is clearly skillfully crafted.\n\nAs soon as you walk in you are greeted with a large display of the menu. Very clear and concise, and the ingredients are organic and whole....no crap included.\n\nYou order at the cashier, and you are handed a number and then you hunt for a place to sit down. The only downer is the small and tight space all the tables are in. It makes me feel bad for the servers who have to maneuver through tight aisles and customers who are fighting for seats. \n\nWhat I ordered:\n-farmer's market salad: avocado, cheese (this is what makes the dish), mixed greens, carrots, radishes (I didn't include this in my salad), toasted pumpkin seed and your choice of herb ranch or red wine vinaigrette. Please choose the red wine vinaigrette, it adds a more warm flavor and allows you to taste the farm market veggies more. I regret that i forget the name of the cheese, but this is what makes the salad. The toasted pumpkin seed creates a nutty flavor, which blends well with the greens and cheese! This was fantastic! I will definitely get this again. And avocados are rich in Good fat!\n-Sunnyside burger: farm raised beef with lettuce tomato, cheese and caramelized onions, and for the shining ingredient: the sunny side up egg! the meat is very tender, and the egg completes the meat! Definitely a winner...and also suggests that the other burgers on the menu must be as good!\n-Fries with herb and parmesan! Very tasty! my kind of fries with just enough sea salt and parmesan! I wish they had garlic fries!\n\nAnd my Favorite of all: Blue bottle coffee milkshake!!! OMG sooooo good, does not compare to any type of frappuccino! I don't drink coffee much, but this is too yummy to pass up! I haven't tried it with the torched marshmallow, but i will soon!\n\nFriendly service, nice casual ambience, and yummy food, how much more do you want! oh wait, if only SF parking was easy", "author": "Monica G."}

Finally a table cleared and as I got up to get the chair from the now empty table next to us 2 girls who were still in the back of the line and no where near ordering set their purses down. When the busser explained to them that by the time they were done eating we would give them the chair back they threw fits and called management. Our poor busser I hope didn't get in trouble.

Plus, its focus on grass fed, high quality meats, and GF/paleo options was very enticing. I perhaps had too high of expectations for this place, so maybe that was my mistake, but Roam didn't live up to the hype. The food was just okay, nothing especially memorable, and the service was subpar. One thing I really appreciated was the knowledgeable staff re: gluten and other ingredients/allergens in food.\n\nHusband and I came in on a Sunday afternoon, and there was a short line but it moved very quickly. We got our order # sign and found a seat in the bar area. While we were waiting for food, a girl behind the bar spilled an entire glass of iced tea on my husband (the whole thing landed squarely on him), the glass broke all over him and the floor. The people behind the bar barely seemed to care, asking casually, just once if we were okay. Well yeah, minus the fact that he's soaking wet with sweet tea and standing in a pile of glass, sure...The milkshake we ordered was sitting in the middle of the destruction and my husband asked if he could get a new one since there might be glass shards in it. The guy behind the bar looked at it skeptically and said 'eh, there probably isn't'...really? You really wanna risk that? and then finally made us a new one after we looked a little incredulous. If this had happened in a different restaurant, where you don't pay ahead of time, we would have received a comped bill, but no compensation here. Something - side of extra fries, a discount for next time, etc. would have been nice! \n\nShortly after that, we got our food - I got the heritage burger in a lettuce wrap, no mayo, with aged cheddar, he got the classic on a GF bun, we split the fries and the vanilla milkshake. The burger patty was very thin, wrapped in a monstrous amount of lettuce so that all you could really taste was the lettuce. The burger was a little on the dry side, not very well seasoned or juicy at all, The caramelized onions were sparse. Husband said his burger was just 'okay' and the GF bun paled in comparison to others, was on the soggy side. The fries were good, cooked in rice bran oil and no gluten contaminants in the fryer which was nice - but the portion was TINY for one serving. The milkshake was great, but hard to screw that one up.\n\nOverall, we decided we far prefer Umami burger for flavor, quantity, and service but would come to Roam only if it was conveniently en route.", "author": "Piyali F."}

My burger came out relatively quick minus my side of fries I ordered (the cashier didn't hear me ask for them, but the food runner brought some when I asked about them) I bit into my burger and it was juicy, seasoned, and properly cooked. Everything I asked for was prepared and balanced wonderfully. I also ordered the salted caramel shake and it took every ounce of restrain I had not to suck it all down or go back for another one. This is going to be a must have on all my trips to San Fran from now on. Tip: Don't go during peak hours because the line gets out the door or order your food ahead of time to go and pick it up.\n\nWhat works: The options on the menu, the flavors, and the shakes!\n\nWhat to improve: Work on getting orders right the first time and keeping people from standing over people eating.", "author": "Patrick M."}

I've been coming to this restaurant (a few times at Union street) a little over half a dozen times, now.  However, this review will pertain to the one on Fillmore as it was this location I last visited.  This restaurant offers quality free-range livestock meat, including bison.  But my indulgence is the elk meat (I usually double it, because I have a humungous appetite).  I proudly drag my friends to experience it at least once in their lifetime, however, my previous visit was sadly below satisfactory.\n\nMy last dine-in was sorely disappointing, because I didn't even dine-in but ordered to go.  It's safe to say I waited 30+ minutes for my order only to get a burger I didn't ask for.  Aside from that, the cashier obviously didn't know how to ring me up properly as I paid more than I usually did for my burger.  Refusing to accept my wrong order, I waited an additional 10-15 minutes, which should've been the reasonable length of time in the first place, for the correct order.\n\nNow, in their defense, it was a busy day, and I understood having to wait 30 minutes, however, the overcharging and mistaking of the order was reproachable.  And if it was up to me, this review would be 4.5 stars.  Don't get me wrong, this place is unrivaled when it comes to burgers, just beware of eating here on a busy day.", "author": "Eric C."}

Given it was a holiday and this city generally clears out for holidays, I thought it would be pretty empty. Not to be, place was packed. Probably folks trying to get their eat on before they get their drink on.\n\nFood: Barbeque style Bison burger. Bison burger is definitely worth the extra $2.75? Just to give it a shot, and, after all, this isn't your average quick-fix burger spot, so why not splurge. Thought the burger was really, really good if not a little small. Then again, I am large, so that probably had something to do with it.\n\nTruffle parmesan fries are really, really good as well. Not worth getting more than an order of them for the table as the taste will wear on you after a bit, you're best off getting a mix of fries for the table (recommend the sweet potato as well).\n\nDrink was a cola, they have a bottled cola, I didn't read or recognize the brand. Solid.\n\nThis place blows most burger spots in SF out of the water. \n\nGave it 4 stars because I've been to Roam a few times and getting seating has always been a bit troublesome, and I'm not a huge fan of long-table seating (when smaller individual tables are taken); plus it's kind of a clusterfuck, given some people seem to not be sure who has been waiting the longest.", "author": "Dev S."}

You order at the counter and receive a table number and a waiter brings out the food to your table. The hardest part is finding a table and I found myself hovering over people who are about to leave, waiting to snag their table. The ambiance is relaxed but loud and I felt like I had to strain my voice to talk with my friend. The napkins, fork and knife, and water are at a condiment bar off to the side of the restaurant.\n\nThe first time I went I ordered a Bison (add $2.99) Sunny Side burger (organic free-range egg, aged white cheddar, caramelized onions, greens, tomato, and sweet chili sauce). There was a lot going on in the burger so I couldn't really taste the difference of a Bison patty but the burger as a whole was really good. I had to use a fork and knife after a few bites though because it got super messy with the egg yolk. I also ordered the sweet potato fries but the waiter seemed to have forgotten so after waiting until about halfway into my burger, I reminded the waiter and he promptly brought it out. My friend ordered the Blue Bottle Coffee shake and declared it the best thing he's ever had.\n\nMy second time here I got the Beef French and Fries burger (truffle parmesan fries, gruyere, avocado, caramelized onions, watercress, and dijon mustard) with no gruyere cheese. French fries inside a burger? Best idea ever. Since I already had fries, I ordered the \"seasonal veggies\" which was Brussels sprouts with chili flakes, lemon, and Parmigiano Reggiano and it was DELICIOUS. It was hot, salty, crispy, lemony, spicy, and definitely exceeded my expectations. It was so good I'm going to try and recreate it at home. My friend ordered the sweet potato fries and I had some of hers yum.\n\nThe burgers are the prefect size and fill you up without weighing you down. Although a bit pricey, the food is so worth it.

It's packed on weekends and during the lunch hour b/c it's yummy and the price point is fair. It's a casual and fun environment.", "author": "Sandy G."}

The last time I was there, I walked away with a $23 lunch by myself that was just ok. I've given this place a few tries and every time walk away feeling the same.  Lets face it you came here for the burgers, so how are they you might ask? They are alright. Not great, not amazing, not incredible. There are fancy meats, great selection of burger types, several different kinds of fries and a good selection of drink options. But in the end the burgers are just decent, nothing more. Definitely not worth $23 for lunch for just me and all I had was a burger, fries and a beer.", "author": "C F."}

Or will I always be a self proclaimed Burger Connoisseur and Burgermeister? Burger Joint, Burger Shack, Burger Stand, Burger Truck, Burger Barn I shall try them all with no second guessing and hesitation. I shall make a u-turn if I stumble across a worthwhile intriguing Burger restaurant. Which is exactly what happened as I was cruising through the Fillmore/Lower Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco one beautiful sunny day.\n\nRoam Artisan Burgers is what I saw driving down Fillmore and that's what enticed me to make a u-turn and find parking. As I'm walking up it's getting better and better. While reading it's Mission Statement and researching Roam Artisan Burgers I find out.....100% grass-fed beef which is rich in omega 3's, freshly ground never frozen. Beef, Bison,Turkey are on the menu. Pickles are made in-house. House-made veggie burgers are organic, gluten free and vegan. Artisan Burger Buns made fresh daily and delivered by a local bakery. Fries cooked in Rice Bran Oil. House-made sodas are sweetened with low-glycemic agave nectar, Shakes are made with organic ice cream or organic non-fat frozen yogurt. Wine on tap eliminates waste and allows for a barrel to glass experience. Various beers on tap and bottle. Their menu items contain no corn syrup, no hormones, no antibiotics, and no added trans fat.  Wow. That's pretty awesome!!\n\nAs we enter this beautiful, clean, sleek, modern Burger establishment I glance at the menu on the wall, place our orders, get a number and seat ourselves. Since we came at such a good time, the place was not packed at all. Fast forward fifteen minutes there's a line starting to form while tables are being occupied one by one. Being that I was in the midst of a quality burger restaurant I stepped my game up and ordered the \"Heritage Burger\", which consists of Applewood Smoked Bacon, Fontina, Butter Lettuce, Tomato, Caramelized Onions, and Herb Mayo with the option of a traditional sesame seed bun, whole grain bun, gluten-free bun, or lettuce wrap. I opted for the traditional sesame seed bun and a organic strawberry shake. The Heritage burger was fantastic. Big burger with big flavor. Savory and succulent with no overkill on the lettuce and tomatoes. Caramelized onions and herb mayo just took the burger to another level. The organic strawberry shake paired with the heritage burger was like a match made in heaven. One of the best strawberry shakes I've ever had. Hard to explain the shake other than it just taste super fresh with an aftertaste that had you craving for more. Ordered the trio of fries a.k.a the  Fry-Fecta  \"Traditional, Sweet Potato, and Onion fries\". All fries were Delicious.\n\nRoam Artisan Burgers has their original location over on Union St. which I'm sure is just as awesome as their Fillmore location. Without a doubt a solid quality \"Burger Joint\" that will rival any top Burger restaurant with an outstanding price point.  Fresh organic ingredients, innovative burger combinations with a welcoming inviting atmosphere in a hip cool neighborhood. You can not go wrong while dining at Roam.", "author": "Alastair G."}

Date had the heritage burger and he shrugged when I asked him what he thought of it, not impressed. So as far as burgers go, I'd take a super duper or an umami burger over roam any day. But now the fries and the drinks are another story, especially the drinks. We had the Fry-fecta and the sweet potato fries were ok, not crisp enough in my opinion. The onion-zuke string fries were a great textural addition to the burgers, but on their own they fell flat in terms of flavor. The regular french fries were amazing though, we got them parmasan-truffled, so good! But honestly if I'm not impressed with the burger I probably won't come back for fries either, but I could very easily see myself stopping by for a hazelnut shake or a carmelized pineapple soda which were both amaaaaazing.

I was ordering two sides of brussels sprouts and eating it like it was in fact, a juicy burger...\n\nThen I found out those spicy, lemony roasted brussels sprouts were merely a SEASONAL MENU ITEM. And they switched it to another vegetable. It felt like someone had ripped out my heart and replaced my heart with sub-par squash. It's okay though bc I taught myself how to make those brussels sprouts at home and they taste pretty close to the Roam burger ones. \n\nOh yeah, burgers.

Parking was a bit hard to find so we circled around the blocks for 10-15 minutes at least. :( We shared the Fry-Fecta fries. Unfortunately, I did not try the Elk Burger that night and instead had the Heritage Burger. The Heritage Burger came with applewood smoked bacon, fontina, butter lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, and herb mayo. It was such a huge burger! Burger was cooked just right and the bacon was crunchy and delicious! Burger was really juicy. What I didn't really like was that it was pretty oily and greasy... I felt very messy. :( Anyways, the Fry-Fecta comes with Russet Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, and Zucchini Onion Haystack. Definitely sharable. I loved the Zucchini Onion Haystack!

My order was wrong on multiple levels (dangerously undercooked, wrong condiments, additions paid for not provided) and was slapped down in front of me by someone who was literally running to move on to something else. I'm sympathetic because this place is so busy and crowded that the employees have no choice but to rush - and as a result mistakes can get made. As far as the actual burger, it was solid, but not much better than my work cafeteria. The space is nice and the selection of craft beers is also good. Maybe it's better when it's slower.", "author": "Jason S."}

The sauce was not overbearing and just a small smathering of onions in it.  Seriously good burgers and though it is a pricier burger at about $10, it definitely is worth it's value!  Great beers on tap and the salad menu looks appealing, too. Casual atmosphere-walk up to the counter, sit down, and it is whipped up and served to you fairly shortly thereafter.

However, suddenly i remembered i always want to visit Roam burger at fillmore st. where i always passed by but i never had a chance to stop by. So finally today i ordered the classic veggie burger with gluten free vegan bun without knowing what's in it at all. So when it arrived at my table, WOW it's a beet burger! So my wish came true!! :D\nIt tasted pretty good, it's a just a lil' different than the one in plant organics cafe because the grilled beet patty was a lil easy to separate but it's still quite tasty. i was in emergency hungry so i ate it pretty messy. Sometimes a lil mess is what is all about right, it's the companion of pleasure i guess..:p\ni ordered also sweet potato fries, and also onion zucchini haystack as sides. the sweet potato is pretty good, but i'm not a fave of the onion zucchini haystack, it's just too much flour and tasted pretty weird, i don't know it's just 3 dollar something but try it for yourself, see if you like it. I mean, what i don't like maybe it's a heaven to you who knows...\nit's a casual place where there are a lot of communal table and you sit very close to other table. typical sf type.\nit was always people when i was here, nonstop but i was lucky to gt a table with no hassle where my partner has to be in line paying the burger :) nice life eh...\ni have a good experience here, the staff are normal and good. ambiance is casual. noise level is normal kind to loud noise.\nthe only minus experience here is, i forgot to ask since i was starving if they have really pure vegan/vegetarian oil when they cook it, where they cooked it. Was it the same grill with the meat? They have beef, chicken, elk, oh no, i might...:o Because they're not specialized vegan/vegetarian burger place, but they said in the menu that the bun is vegan. So after i got out from this place i got really skeptical if i'm going again or not because my palate was itchy afterwards. Usually if some food i ate has touched w/ oil or animal products, it will right away itchin'. I mean i'm a pretty flexible veggie person when it comes to eat, but i prefer my food not to be mixed with oil or grill from the meat before. So veg folks, i'm still unsure if i should recommend you to go here, unless the business make it clear that it's safe/pure method for vegetarian/vegan peeps.", "author": "Ms C."}

I ordered the beef burger BBQ style and the russet fries with the Parmesan truffle seasoning. Fries were really good. Burger was not that great. The meat was good, but it was a skinny little burger. If you are real hungry get the double patty. it was cooked over medium, so if you like your burgers medium or under, I'm thinking you can ask, but they certainly didn't ask me when I ordered. The thing was overly-sauced, and it also had cole slaw on it, which was tasty, but I felt like the toppings almost took over the taste of the burger. By the time I got halfway through my burger, my bun was soggy from all the sauce. That was the deal breaker for me. \nI'm going to give Roam 3 stars instead of 2 for the seating. They have a open window in the front with a patio. Real great if it's sunny outside, and there are heaters, if you want to sit in the window, but it's cold.

I got a chocolate milkshake which was organic and amazing, but my fave so far among the shakes is the chocolate hazelnut which I added marshmallow to.  The choc hazelnut was the special last time, so I didn't think to even ask for it this time.  Anyway this is the place to go for organic burger goodness!  And u don't feel disgustingly full afterwards, just satisfying full.", "author": "Stephanie T."}

However, I expected more out of the burger with all the foodie lingo--artisan! grass fed! I will go back to Choice Yakiniku, a modest little place next to the Diamond Heights Safeway where they make a much better tasting burger (best in the city, IMHO). I also tried their prickly pear soda, since I am a big fan of anything prickly pear. Also disappointed because it was both too sweet and too sour.

I'm amicable.  I like meat.  So last night before a Spinners concert on the other side of Geary we agreed to give it a try.  With another friend in tow and it being the day after Christmas I decided this would be my treat to two friends whom don't traditionally exchange Christmas gifts.  I had cash in my pocket and was feeling a little flush as it seemed a bit warm if not quite burning a hole.  Once everything was ordered and my friends went looking (roaming) for a table I was left to pay with what I was told after a quick inspection was a counterfeit 50 dollar bill along with an explanation of how they were being passed around all over Fillmore street...an epidemic.  The bill had no watermarks.  Really?  Watermarks were on the 1993 series?  Really.  I was ready to leave but instead paid with a credit card and then Googled to find that watermarks on 50 dollar bills did not begin until 1996 and when showing it to the male cashier and the woman he was talking too they just kind of shrugged their shoulders and I was left wondering who trains these people on detecting counterfeit bills let alone their very poor customer service.  My suggestion is go to Super Duper it's every bit as paleo and the staff is friendly they don't give the impression that their job is beneath them while at roam they think they're with the fbi.  Oh, and by the way...the name Roam isn't for \"roam on the range\" it is in fact what you do after paying for your food and you're given a number.  That's right...you then roam around the room looking for an available table.  Good luck with that.  , )", "author": "tom l."}

Got the ostrich burger with a wheat bun in the Sunny Side style with an order of the special for that day; brussels sprouts in olive oil topped with parmesan and red pepper flakes. All of it was amazing, although my egg was overcooked and was just a fried over easy egg (minus the one star). Boyfriend got a burger in the French and Fries style which was also fantastic and not too overpowering on the truffle. They have the source written on the board next to the meat options and also for the brussels sprouts which adds that feel good factor. Beef is 100% grassfed (which I take to mean the meat is not finished on corn to fatten it up at the end of its life - definitely a plus!). None of us felt that typical gross heavy feeling you usually get after eating a burger. i didn't get fries, but they do have sweet potato fries yum yum.

I thought I was going to wait hours for some typical veggie burger. We got in line and we were fooled. The ordering line moves pretty fast and people clear tables regularly so the turnover led to a short wait. We sat down and the shakes came out almost immediately. They were like ice cream in a cup. The burgers and fries came out later. I got the Veggie French and Fries with the try-fecta. Way too much food! It could have easily been shared by 2 people. The veggie burger was unlike any other I've had, made of beets and other tasty veggies. The try-fecta was good though the spirals were so small you couldn't really taste much out of them at that size. I'm tempted to minus one star because $25 for 2 burgers and fries just is way too expensive no matter how delicious it is to put bread and vegetables together, but then all you haters would be messaging me.", "author": "Crys L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-22", "description": "We went here last night based in part due to the great Yelp reviews. Although not perfect, this place was great! The dimly-lit wooden and tech interior was a pleasant change from some of the garish white-tile burger places that have recently become popular. Instead of that house-style club music that makes me want to drive a stake into my own heart, Roam was rockin' Hendrix and the Stones - awesome.  I thought the sweet potato fries were nearly perfect, and the regular fries were pretty damned decent as well.  And instead of that soggy slice of Wonder Bread other places claim is a bun, Roam brilliantly offered a real bun that actually held the burger.  The only thing that I might improve on was the not-so-special special sauce, which transmuted what might a have been a slightly crispy burger exterior (that's a good thing) into sort of a soggy, mayonnaise-y mess.  A couple of oddities: the floors were unusually slippery, something I've never experienced -- or even thought to notice -- in any other restaurant (note to insurance company), and the overly scented bathroom soap clung unpleasantly to my hands, mixing with and occasionally overpowering the aroma of the food while I ate.  Note to self:  Next time -- and there will be a next time -- lose the special sauce, wash hands in advance, and practice T-stop maneuver.", "author": "Richard A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-26", "description": "As a burger enthusiast, I have experienced a good number of establishments that offer a variety of distinct styles as well as the option to create a custom taste; however, Roam's commitment to using natural ingredients and offering unique combinations of food and drink put them a step ahead of most. I enjoyed the ability to choose from beef, turkey, bison, or veggie burgers, and chose the free range turkey with the \"French and Fries\" style. I also ordered a salted caramel shake, too enticed by the uncommon flavor and the bruleed marshmallow topping to pass up the chance. The restaurant was packed, so my girlfriend and I found the first open spot in the limited outdoor seating, happy to enjoy the atmosphere of lower Pacific Heights. I was very satisfied with the service, as we received our burgers within 10 minutes despite the restaurant being busy. The \"French and Fries\" met expectations, as the turkey was juicy while the caramelized onions complemented the saltiness of the truffle Parmesan fries and Gruyere cheese quite well. The inclusion of avocado made the burger extra rich but not too heavy to handle. I recommend trying this style, but also look forward to testing the others in visits to come. As for the shake, the salted caramel was creamy, sweet, and even better with the marshmallow; however, I thought the prices were a bit high as a 16 Oz. is $6.49. For the quality of burgers being served, I do think the prices are quite reasonable, especially given the high end location. I appreciated how Roam's burger menu catered to a variety of tastes and incorporated a number of condiments available in the create-your-own section. What I liked the most, though, was the restaurant's attention to detail. Buns purchased from a local vendor, vegetarian options, three types of fries with custom seasoning choices, artisan sodas, locally produced beer, and kid friendly meals showed the establishment's dedication to pleasing their customers and sustaining the local environment. Overall, I would highly recommend Roam to anyone who enjoys creating their own tastes and wants a delicious combination of naturally, creatively crafted burgers and shakes.", "author": "Alex R."}

Really close to 4 stars at the time of this review.  Minus a star or so because of the lukewarm service--which I'm sure can change with good management, so 4 stars when service improves.  I stood in front of the cashier for 10 seconds--in front of her face--waiting for her to look up at me and I get a lukewarm \"Hi\" without a smile and kind of a \"what do you want\" attitude.  I know: 10 seconds, what am I complaining about?  But seriously, stand in front of a wall, count in your head 10 seconds and tell me that's not an awfully long time to stand in front of someone and wait to be acknowledged while the they aren't doing anything.  She might as well have been a wall since I kind of felt like I was speaking to one--no help with the menu and no \"is that all for you?\"--just a grim \"$14.75\" at the end of my order.  But I digress....\n\nIt's Sunday 2pm, a few weeks after Roam has opened and the place is crowded with a late lunch crowd.  The space is nice and open with large front windows, a medium sized tv at the bar, and a good selection of beers on tap.  I place my order at the cashier, grab my number and wait for one of the 3 or so empty tables to be cleared because they only seem to have one guy bussing and running the food.  I get my drink 3 minutes later, my burger 15 minutes later and dig in.  I got the beef classic with carmelized onions, side of sweet potato fries, and a soda.  Really good, fresh, meaty burger on a really good toasted sesame bun and pretty darn good sweet potato fries and house-made soda.  I like this a lot.

Let me repeat:  No disappointments.  The place delivers on what it is -- if you want cocktails, table cloths, waiters, candlelights, hushed conversations -- than go someplace else and spend lots of money more, but if you want a world-class burger (get it absolutely plain so I can make my case!) than this is the place for you.  But surprise, you can get all kinds of imaginative toppings for your burger, and you can also get more than just great grassfed beef, but also bison,turkey, ostrich (of, yes), and even great vegatarian, along with a variety of buns.  And you can get real beverages, as in now old-fashioned but which have come back in style because they have real healthy ingredients, including the ice creams used in the milkshakes.

I've been to the location on Union Street several times, and I like the burgers, so I always try to get there early before it's completely packed.  I was glad to hear about the Fillmore location, since it's significantly closer, so my wife and I went over at ten before noon on a weekend, thinking that by coming a little early we would avoid the crowds - I guess we also thought that since it was a new location, maybe not everyone had heard about it yet.  Well, the place was already fairly busy, but we placed our order and got a seat at the bar - where we sat - and sat - and sat.  It took 40 minutes for our food to come.  This is not a typo - 40 minutes, and that's a very long time to wait for your food - and there's not exactly anything to nibble on while you wait.  If you have a beer, you can get drunk, I guess.  By the time our food came, another guy at the bar complained to the manager and walked out.  My wife walked out as well, but it was just to go down the street and buy an energy bar to sustain her blood sugar during the long wait.
