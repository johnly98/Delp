Atmosphere is approachable and felt like a tasting room in wine country. It wasn't too crowded but had a steady stream of patrons-one of the groups actually brought their kids and the bar set up a table for them with crayons and fries which I thought was cute. \n\nWe tried a glass of white each and a Ros\u00e9. When we first inquired about the menu, the first two things my friend asked about were not available which I always find disappointing at a bar/restaurant in general.\n\nThe wines we did try were great and I wish I could remember the names but the person who helped us had great suggestions so you probably can't go wrong. They do give you a generous taste before you commit to a glass.\n\nFor food we did a bowl of their popcorn (porcini brown butter) and a toast with burrata and English peas. The toast was AMAZING (fresh and bright flavors) and we immediately tried to figure out what was in it so we could recreate for ourselves. Popcorn was also surprisingly addicting as well.\n\nAll in all a great place to stop in for a drink and a bite. I liked that it wasn't too loud so I could actually have a conversation with my girlfriend and not have to shout. Liked the ambiance a lot (wine crates and records).

We came here at 2pm on a Sunday and spent over an hr here. I am a red wine kind of person and more in the dry side but I was looking for a sweeter dry red today. The bar tender suggested Vocal Vineyards and let me tell you....YOU NEED TO DRINK THIS! It's so crisp and perfect as a mid day wine. I also tried the P.Quiles Vermouth and it's absolutely amazing. The bartenders were so friendly and warm that they made it feel like I was already a regular even though it was my first time here.

One was a White Bordeaux, Cuvee des Conti, and Wow, it was delicious, beautiful subtle complexities in a well structured wine (Sauvignon Blanc / Semillion blend). \n\nThen we got into a domestic GSM (Grenache, Syrah, Mourvedre blend made in Rhone style but made in U.S.) Not sure if you want all of that description but another excellent selection. \n\nI personally loved the art that adorned the walls and above the bar itself is this really cool conglomerate of wooden wine boxes. The really great wines come in these kinds of boxes. When you're buying for a high end restaurant you have too many of these boxes which should be used in an art form. \n\nAlso enjoyed several food items, the truffle oiled popcorn was outstanding - so much flavor. \nAnd we all enjoyed the various tapas that were available, I think we ordered most of what was on the menu - that wine makes ya hungry. \n\nGreat place - enjoyed the wines and my people, I would recommend for a quiet evening with good conversation.", "author": "Rew C."}

Lots of cool art lines the walls, along with wine bottles and their crates. \n\nThis specially long and dark establishment fits in with the other eclectic shops that line the street and drew an impossible crowd for 7 pm on a Wednesday. They had a nice variety of wines, beers and some less common vermouths and cognacs. That being said there were pricy. They only sell by the glass, no bottles, and their glasses go up to $19 each for decent but not amazing wines. \n\nWhile I thoroughly visually enjoyed the space, it's really hard for me to justify giving this place more than 3 stars, given that other than a nice interior, the experience was very average.", "author": "Quinn Li O."}

Why? - Well, I like drinking a glass of wine, but I honestly can't tell a high quality wine from a bad quality wine. I understand that the folks who opened up High Treason are sommeliers of some of the finest establishments. And my friend - who is a true wine expert - verified that they really have excellent wines on offer; if also pricey ones. But for me that just wasn't enough as I - as a wine dumbo- felt somewhat dwarfed and mediocre in this space...and that didn't feel good. \n\nFor me the surrounding atmosphere and the people that I'm with is much more important. And honestly the atmosphere also didn't agree with me: I thought it was a cold space. Both in the literal sense of the word and also in the figurative one. Maybe they were trying to recreate the atmosphere of a drafty wine cellar in the French wine regions? It's all very straight-lines, clean cuts and minimal decoration...and I like a wine bar to feel like my living room.

My gf had that first and then went to a Pinot. She then went back to the cab cuz that was her favorite as well. I started with the Chateauneuf-du-Pape and then asked the server what he would recommend to follow that. He suggested the Cote du Rhone which was a nice follow up. I ended the night with the cabernet. I honestly don't know much about wines. I just know what I like when I drink it. Typically full bodied and bold, so the cab fit that nicely.\n\nThe servers were very sweet and helpful. The space has a little swank to it, but it still feels cozy. They were sweet enough to give us a small bowl of Popcorn gratis. I believe it was porcini and brown butter. My gf kept thinking it had a foie type of flavor, but I found it a little more earthy.

Very unassuming from the street (a plain, brown storefront without a sign) this wine bar is gorgeous once inside. This beautiful wine bar with stellar service and unique selections would be right at home in the Mission. It's a lucky placement in the Richmond, and gives an indication where this neighborhood may be headed.\n\nNow that I'm living in Marin, I find meeting friends in the city involves finding an \"in between\" spot and have now spent some time discovering this neighborhood that seemed completely out of the way when I actually lived in the city. Always great for Korean, Vietnamese and dim sum, now things are really opening up here and High Treason is as good as it gets due to their terrific low key staff and excellent wine pours.  These guys know their stuff and I was delighted to discover Bodega Perez Pascuas version of \"El Pedrosal\" by the glass, a dark inky mystery of a tempranillo. Do order their crisp croquettes with melty, savory manchego and jamon interior. \n\nThe wine was so good that we both purchased a bottle to take home, after drinking a glass. If you are a local you can take away for 40% off the bottle price, if you are taking a bottle out the door to go.  A relative bargain.

I was in the neighborhood though and decided to come by and grab some wine and food.\n\nThe food menu is small but quite interesting. I tried the fried quail, duck fat fries, and a couple glasses of wine; they also gave me complimentary olive bread and butter. Overall, everything was really salty which made it a little hard to enjoy. The quail was fried pretty nicely and was tasty but was just overwhelmingly salty after a few bites. It came with some veggies (squash mostly) and the veggies were actually my favorite thing I ate at High Treason. Fries were good at first, but again, really salty and one note after a while. I liked them more when I soaked them in the broth(?) that the quail was on top of. I think I would have preferred the fries to be just a tad thicker (I do like thin fries but these were crazy thin, more like a garnish) and with some kind of sauce. The butter that came with the bread was excellent but the bread itself was again oddly salty (maybe because of the olives in it?). \n\nThey also have a wine and beer list that has some pretty good options. My favorite thing was a sparkling red wine which I unexpectedly really enjoyed. The prices skew slightly on the high side, even compared to other SF bars (I have had the same beer I had here for $1-2 less at a bunch of places for example) but nothing too crazy. \n\nThe verdict: a pretty nice menu and great space and atmosphere. The flavors and cooking of the food was good; the seasoning was definitely too heavy overall. I would definitely consider coming back if in the area, but wouldn't come out of my way to come here. 3.5 stars probably but rounding up because the saltiness was the main reason it wasn't 4 stars and that is a pretty easy fix.", "author": "Seema U."}

We stopped by for their grand opening tonight and were not disappointed.\n\nThe space has a modern look to it with the gray painted walls and dark tables, but the large skylights above the main seating area help give the otherwise heavy space a level of lightness. The wall adjacent to the bar has a variety of contemporary paintings, and directly above the bar is a nice installation utilizing wine crates. I really like how they approached seating at High Treason - abundant wine bar seating, a few high tables, a few low tables, and standing room with a ledge. There is also seating upstairs that we will need to check out next time!\n\nThe wine list is very French-heavy, but seriously you could choose any of the wines on that list and be happy. I had the Cava Ros\u00e9, which was exactly what I needed on a warm afternoon. My boyfriend had the Lambrusco and was equally happy. John is an exceptional sommelier and answered our questions with ease and enthusiasm. Rachel also has a great knowledge of the wine and beer at High Treason and helped my bf choose a delicious and yeasty K\u00f6lsch for his next drink. High Treason's list also includes a cider section, sherry section, and dessert wine selection.\n\nWe also got to try out some nibbles from the kitchen - a walnut levain with salt-flaked butter is complimentary and quite delightful (paired well with my Cava!). We also tried their sampler and were especially pleased with the selection for $10 - a ham p\u00e2t\u00e9 toast with kumquat, a marinated carrot salad with ricotta and slivered almond, Serrano ham and manchego croquette, and grape in Gorgonzola with almond crust. We savored each bite and loved the combination of tastes on the plate.\n\nWe can't wait to come back to High Treason for another visit! Welcome to the neighborhood!", "author": "Liz G."}

I had no idea he could cook like this. Either he was holding out on us this hold time, or his skills blew up exponentially since I last ate over his house. Haha! Everything was so delicious and there were many wine and beer pairing possibilities with the food. We had the Cajun fried chicken sliders on a brioche bun, with a fort point saison beer for me and Schneider Pinot noir wine for my wife. The chicken was so crispy and juicy, seasoned perfectly and came together so well with the house coleslaw and creamy Cajun sauce. We also had the best bruschetta I've ever had in my life! Kale pesto base, portobello mushroom and candied walnuts - amazing I must say.

Not too impressive. Cheese was ok...could have mentioned on the menu what type of cheese...as in goat, cow or sheep). FYI...the cheese plate contain a goat and sheep combination cheese) Not a fan of goat or sheep. Order a second round of red wine to wash down the goat/sheep cheese (Domaine Gros Frere et Soeur Hautes Cotes de Nuits and Alain Voge C\u00f4tes du Rhone) Wine selection was ok, had better and in a nicer setting. But with a lot of things wine is up to you and you only. Only you know what you like and can't depend on someone's opinion. \n\nThe reason I gave it 3 stars was because of the service.

Have been planning on trying it as it's a neighborhood spot and seemed like a great addition to the plethora of restaurants and bars on clement. I thought the space was lovely: really high ceilings to make the space feel airy and the long entrance  from the doorway to the bar was very open. \n\nMy 2 stars is for the service: my friend had gotten there 5 minutes before me and got a table close to the bar. I arrived and had to wait 10 minutes before flagging down a server about wanting to try a taste of the wine before ordering a glass. At first I wasn't sure if we had to go to the bar to order but it definitely was table service. He forgot about us (another 10 mins) and we ended up having to flag down ANOTHER server who finally got my order. He apologized for the lack of service and said that for 3 servers, it's no excuse. (Thank you, I appreciated that). He started pouring a full glass without me tasting and honestly, by that point, I had been waiting 20+ mins for a glass of wine that it didn't matter what I ordered. After we got the wine, I wanted to order food and couldn't get anyone to take my order. It was only after my friend flagged down the bus boy did we get our order in. I ordered the duck fries and it came out but much gastronomically \"savvy\" than I imagined. It was tiny, tiny slivers, smaller than shoestring fries. They also didn't have ketchup-fine, not a big deal. \n\nI wanted to stay for another glass but was so put off by the service that we got the bill and left.

The portions on the food were less that I had expected.\n\nI'd come back for the wine, but pass on the food.", "author": "Timothy G."}

It was called a buyout where we take over the wine bar for the evening (i.e. closed to the public).  It was fantastic!!!   As you can see from the pictures that others have posted, the atmosphere is great (don't let the external facade from the street dissuade you).  We \"dressed up\" the place further with flowers, balloons and lots of small candles (votives).   My son developed a Spotify play list that was played through High Treason's sound system so the wine bar was filled with the music we loved.   The food was very good.  However, what really stood out was the service.  Michael, the co-owner, and his staff were very friendly and extremely attentive to our needs and those of our guests - whether to recommend a type of wine, pour a glass of a favorite beer or even just get water and/or a napkin for a guest.  Great people, great ambience,  great music, great wine, great beer = great fun!", "author": "Bob M."}

We walked in to the cold space, there was no hostess or staff to greet us, and although the place didn't look busy at all, there was not enough seating. After gazing around for how to proceed, a bartender thrust 2 wine lists at us and said \"wherever you want\".  Well, since we wanted food, we wanted to sit at a table or counter. The only space available was next to a turntable, where we had a clear view of people loitering about in the kitchen. None of the other customers seemed to have any food or snacks, so that wasn't a good sign. We were finally able to get the attention of another bartender, and asked if they served food. He gave us a quizzical/annoyed look and returned with the list and tossed it in front of us and walked away. \nNeedless to say, we didn't feel welcome by any of this, and decided to take our business elsewhere. We hope that they are just going through some growing pains, and that our next visit will be different. Why would anyone want to stay and enjoy a glass of wine and some snacks, if they are made to feel like intruders?\nWe noticed there was an upstairs area, and hoped we could sit there, but it was chained off. We're guessing it's not finished yet. Better luck next time?!", "author": "L. S."}

Recommendations are on point not just buzz words. I loved how the bottle was brought to table a small taste and the a glass poured upon verification. Great contemporary art, cool crowd at varying ages and styles. The charcuterie was melt in your mouth. I can't wait to see this place progress as their chef comes into play. Well done. We need more places like this.", "author": "Carey C."}

This neighborhood really needed a new gem and it's finally here!  Solid wine list with great selections.  John was very friendly and happy to make some great suggestions for an indecisive lady.  He even helped create a custom party pack of bottles for me!  The Raventos i Blanc Blanc de Nit sparkling rose is a must try!  So yes, while it's a lovely place to have a few glasses of wine with your friend, it's also a great resource for purchasing for your collection. Great service, elegant but not pretentious atmosphere, eclectic art, trendy new hot spot... I've only been twice since they just opened and they are still working out the kinks but if this is a sign of things to come... this place is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area and waiting for your dinner table to be ready.", "author": "Angela W."}

The owners behind the bar were friendly, helpful, attentive (there were about 25 of us) and generous.  They allowed us a couple taste tests to find the perfect glass of wine. The gave everyone a glass for water as soon as we walked in, and kept them full.  It was a great experience and hopefully we'll be back soon.", "author": "Vicki H."}

It feels like it doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up, or like an apartment you just moved into & aren't sure how to decorate.", "author": "KS K."}
