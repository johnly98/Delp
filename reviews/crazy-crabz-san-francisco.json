DOWN. \n\nPricing sucks tho lol. $18.50 for a crab sandwich but you have to consider you're at a ballpark getting a crab sandwich on sourdough bread.\n\nSo basically it's a crab sandwich with tomatoes on toasted sourdough bread. You get a pretty long sandwich, cut in half. It's so good you'll be wishing for more. And apparently they're supposed to be opening one up in SFO (San Francisco International Airport) but for now, AT&T Park is the only place you can get your hands on one of these. So if you're enjoying a Giants game, you most definitely need to hit this spot up. \n\nPS:\nYou don't need to line up at the Crazy Crab'z booth to get the sandwich. Any booth along the same side as Crazy Crab'z can serve you a sandwich.", "author": "Andrew B."}

It tasted just like the crabs you would get in Maryland. The portion size was incredibly small, but I guess the price is based off the fact that it was a crab sandwich. \n\nProbably wouldn't buy it again as it was more for the experience because I can't really justify spending $18.50, but if it was like 13-14 dollars then I definitely would.", "author": "Timothy D."}

There's a few pieces of shells in the crab meat so be very careful while biting into the sandwich and chewing. \n\nDefinitely just a one and done for me.

The famous crab sandwich at Crazy Crab'z is one of them.  \n\nFacts:\n\n* You can find Crazy Crab'z behind the center field bleachers.\n* It's nestled among a lot of other food places and it's pretty much a madhouse with people ordering food before and during the game.\n* The line tends to be long, but it also tends to move quite fast.\n* You can also order drinks and a few other food items there too.\n\nThe sandwich itself is always great -- fresh crab meat with some sliced tomatoes between sourdough bread.  \n\nHowever, despite how awesome the sandwich is, these guys get three stars.  Why?  For the price you pay (more than $15), the size of the sandwich is ridiculously small.  I finished it before I even got to my seat.  I get that we're in San Francisco and that crab meat isn't cheap, but then again, when you add up the cost of a crab sandwich and a shock top beer (which is what I ordered on my most recent visit to the ballpark), you might find yourself feeling a little apprehensive about splurging on the famous crab sandwich.  I'd say it's worth it if you've never eaten one before and if you're a seafood junkie like me.  But even I don't get a crab sandwich every time at the ballpark due to the high price.

Ironically named after the much hated Giants mascot from the 1980's, this version is immensely more popular. They put a warm Dungeness crab salad into sourdough garlic bread - with a tomato slice - and serve it to fans at the game. The stand looks like 4 individual stands, but you can order the Crazy Crab or any other items at any register along the back of the bleacher patio.\n\nThe sandwich is just awesome. You can actually taste the real crab with a decent portion. The sourdough garlic bread is messy, but adds extra richness to the sandwich. There are other options including a shrimp sandwich and an open face grilled ahi tuna which also look very tasty. Clam chowder in a bread bowl and decent wine and beer options are available.\n\nThe price of $17 seems outrageous, but most Dungeness crab sandwiches outside the ballpark are expensive anyway. The premium and experience are very reasonable. If you are visiting AT&T Park for the first time, this is a must.

I kept rationalizing that I would go back and see a game, and finally my friend dragged me to one. She kept saying that I should try this sandwich, and after getting bombarded by several photographers, we got to this mecca of CRABBY HAPPINESS. It is a bit pricey, $15.50 for a sandwich. Though I have to admit, totally worth it. Crab in some kind of sauce, in between two slices of grilled garlic sourdough bread, topped with tomato. It was one of the best sandwich experiences I had in a long time. I definitely need to go to more Giants games to just to get that sandwich fix.", "author": "Jenny D."}

I read about this Crazy Crabz shack while planning my trip to SF. Knowing that my BF and I were going to a Giants game, I couldn't wait to try this place! A hot crab sammich at a baseball game? Yes please! I was even willing to pay the $15 because, hey, it was vacation. \n\nI thought I was being SO wise by waiting until the 7th inning to get my sammich. I thought, hey it's late in the game, there will be no lines. I was right there was no line. However, I think they had stopped making new fresh sammiches a few innings ago. My \"hot\" $15 treat came from a display case and was not even lukewarm. The crab meat was indeed tasty and the garlic bread was crisp and buttery but cold and hard. I cried into my hot cocoa.... \n\nI would not venture out to Crazy Crabz again should life ever bring me back to this Stadium as there was so much other delicious food to enjoy and this experience was so sub par. \n\nI will however leave you with a tip for finding this \"gem\".

You will not regret it!\n\nSo maybe the price is a little on the expensive side ($15.50), but honestly what do you expect when purchasing food at a baseball game?  Everything is expensive!  Even the water!  So paying 15 bucks for a fresh, delicious crab sandwich is reasonable.\n\nThe line can be a long, but it goes by pretty fast. And when you order the sandwich they take it right off the grill and hand it to you, so you know it's hot.  The Crazy Crab'z sandwich is pretty much crab mixed with mayonnaise and placed on garlic bread.  Simple and scrumptious.  \n\nWhat I loved about this sandwich was the fact that the crab mixture was creamy and smooth with chunks of real crab throughout.  At some places when I get a crab sandwich I find shell pieces throughout the sandwich, which for me does not make it very enjoyable to eat.  Here, I found no shells! Which is wonderful considering how many of these babies they pop out in a game.  On top of that, the sourdough bread they use is perfect.  It is toasted on a grill and oozing with buttery, garlic goodness.  They also place sliced tomatoes on the sandwich and lemon wedges on the side.  All ingredients compliment each other very nicely, so when you take your first bite you get a slight crunch from the toasted bread and move right on into the creamy seafood.  When you think about it, this is the perfect ballpark sandwich to represent San Francisco.\n\nTip:\nDon't forget to grab a bunch of napkins before heading back to your seats!", "author": "Samantha S."}

The crab salad consisted of only mayonnaise, so it was missing that acidic bite.  There were also no sides that came with the sandwich, and I'm a sucker for variety, so I thought that was lame.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-18", "description": "I thought $15 for a crab sandwich was insane, but that was before I was introduced to AT&T Park's $7 hot dogs and $8 bottles of (ick!) Bud Light. So, comparatively, the sandwich was a good deal since it wasn't a FRICKING $7 HOT DOG. The $10 cold dungeness crab sandwich may be a little cheaper but it looks nasty, like something you'd find in a vending machine.\n\nAnyway, the crazy crab is delicious. Tasty garlic bread and lots of sweet, sweet crab - yum! In the alternate reality of baseball park dining, it's worth it.", "author": "Booda B."}

Some may think it's only an appetizer, but it does fill me up! Only giving it 4 stars because it is pretty pricey for $15.50. The combo of crab and butter soaked sourdough is DELISH. We got their an hour early before the game started and there was no line. It was a weeknight so maybe that is why there was not a wait.", "author": "Raquel S."}

Got to the game early and jumped right into what was starting to become rather long line. My friends, fiance, and I agreed that the garlicy scent was mouth-watering and a cruel, cruel way to convince folks in line that, \"yes, if you wait 30 minutes and give us $15, you will be happy\". And so, it turned out to be true. I agree that the crab sandwich could stand to be a bit bigger, especially for the price, but it did deliver on flavor. In the end, I spent about $32 for 2 sandwiches + tax. I will probably buy another at a future game, but only on pay day.", "author": "Tiffany E."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-18", "description": "The crazy crab sandwich is probably the most expensive thing you'll find in the ballpark at $15... But it's worth EVERY penny. Sometimes I find myself needing to buy 2 of them because they're that good. It is also one of the few things in the ballpark that they actually rub out of during the game, so if you want one, I HIGHLY recommend getting it early in the game.", "author": "Ted C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-28", "description": "Um yea, this sandwich was worth the $15.  My husband and I were visiting San Francisco last weekend and had the opportunity to go to a Giants game.  We were getting a beer near center field when we both smelled the wondeful scent of garlic.  We saw the line was very long for the sandwich and decided to check it out later.  Finally when the initial long line had subsided, we each ponied up $15 for this piece of heaven and were not disappointed in the least.  Yum Yum Yum.  If they didn't cost $15, we would have split another one.", "author": "Meg C."}

Nice amount of crab meat, tho a little too much mayo. Worth $15? I don' t know. Ballparks tend to be pricy, but $5 more just for grilled garlic bread?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-05-01", "description": "Well.... After all the wonderful reviews, I had to try it!  Ironically, I was looking for good another good seafood restaurant in San Francisco proper, and found this *before* I realized this was a Giants Ballgame concession.  I'm a Giants fanatic, and had not tried this spot before.  Ever since Orlando's opened up on the third deck, I haven't visited behind the bleacher much.  Anyway, this sandwich was as good tasting as anyone here has stated.  Also, the price for ballpark food was a great deal.  However, the size of this sandwich is TINY and if you're truly looking for a great crab sandwich go to Nick's in Pacifica.  It's 20 bux, it's about four times the size, and comes with fries.  Granted, it's not at AT&T/SBC/PacBell park and available during Giants games.  Being the tiny guy/small eater I am, my friend and I finished our crab sandwich and then split a Cha Cha bowl after that...  Tim Lincecum pitched a doozy, and a 9 to 4 win over the Dodgers made this one of the best crab sandwiches I've ever had.  That and they serve Stella as well!", "author": "Chris C."}
