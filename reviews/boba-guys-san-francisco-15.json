The only reason why we came here is because the parking is a bit better.  Which is definitely a plus in San Francisco!!   When we arrived at the location, there was a lot of people in line already, the most confusing part is the line for ordering and line for picking up kinda merged into one line.  So we had to ask who was actually in line and who was waiting for their drink.\nMy friend and I both ordered Medium strawberry matcha latte (soooooo good!!)  and my other friend got a hong kong style milk tea with boba (25% sweet).  \nWhen I first tried it i was a little iffy about it, because thinking of strawberry with match just seems a bit odd.  But when i tried it, i couldnt stop drinking it.  The boba was also so fresh and chewy!!!  \n\nThe Hong kong style milk tea was pretty good as well.  But if i ever make the trip from San Leandro to San Fran I will def take advantage of getting the matcha strawberry milk tea!!", "author": "Irene M."}

I loved the strawberry and matcha flavor - they complimented each other well. The sweetness was pretty good and it can also be adjusted by a staff member. The boba topping was also very soft and chewy! \n\nLocation: Just a short walk from Dolores Park in the Mission District.

After hearing a lot of good reports about Boba guys from my friends and former coworkers, I decided to take the opportunity to give it a shot. My usual behavior was that I grab a drink after any interview and by chance and fate boba guys was nearby. There are multiple locations nearby and this one is the most convenient one. Why? There is a lot of parking nearby on the weekdays and all you do is park, cross the street and walk right in. You can even ride a bus and go right in. In terms of flavor, I really like it. The drink I had was real fruity and has a great taste in my mouth. It's really on point. This location seems to be a huge hit among SF natives and Academy of Art students.

Love that they're always more than happy to fix your drink if you aren't satisfied.\n\nAlso I love that they stock Third Culture Bakery pastries! Mochi Muffins, Mochi Donuts, and Thai Tea Custards are deliciousss.

I had a decaf black with whole milk on level 50% sweetness. I didn't have a high expectation but I was hoping it would be a descent place for boba tea. But I was really really disappointed after my first sip. \n\n3 reasons:\n\n1. The milk tea was not milky at all, it tasted like either they didn't put enough whole milk in there or they used non fat milk or almond milk instead.\n\n2. The sweetness is way too sweet for half sweetness, especially the boba are sweet as well.\n\n3. The boba were not properly cooked or prepared, they were half raw and hard to chew. \n\nIt made me sick the next morning because it gave me a lot of gas after I had that boba milk tea last night. Definitely not a good boba milk tea place from my experience.\n\nI would give it 1 star, but my husband liked his lavender milk tea with 25% sweetness, I will give 1 star up. But the boba in his drink was half raw as well.", "author": "Choco W."}

The boba guy (it was a guy) went \"Bonnie!\" And I went \"oh yay that's me\" and then I went up to grab it. Then POP! in goes the straw and I took my first sip without stirring the layered contents. From the bottom, I got a hit of delightfully sweet jelly jam. As I chewed the tapioca balls, I thought \"dang these tapioca balls are squishy and sweet I like it\". I then maneuvered the straw to the top matcha layer to have a taste of that delish liquid and YEAH it had a deep deep matcha flavor. I alternated back and forth to get the two flavors separately until I realized I should stir em both together to see how that tastes. It was a good choice. \n\nAll in all, I rate THIS DRINK 5 stars. Yelp only lets you rate the whole place which isn't nuanced enough. I don't know how the other drinks taste but I'd definitely get the strawberry matcha latte again. I might go tomorrow actually!", "author": "Bonnie T."}

I also recommend trying the coffee milk tea. It's a Hong Kong style drink that's a mix of two delicious things, coffee and milk tea!! -- A good choice when you need some caffeine. I usually opt out of the boba because I used to drink boba 3X a week and found out how fattening it can be. If weight is not a concern, their boba is good! It is really filling, so it is good for an after workout treat. The Strawberry Rice Milk drink is also very good! I recommend getting all drinks iced unless it's a cold day.\n\nThere is seating inside and a park next to this location so that you can hang out with your buddies.", "author": "Andrea T."}

I had been planning to check it out but never got to the last couple times I was in the Bay. We were spending the weekend in Napa, but I made sure we would stop here before we drove out. I finally got to try it out and I loved it! \n\nI had intended on trying the Muscat oolong, but when I got there, I saw the lavender milk tea (and I'm a sucker for lavender!) and got that. Loved the lavender milk tea! It was just the right amount of flavor -- enough to taste it, but not enough to be overpowering. I also tried the the matcha custard cake, which I wasn't expecting too much out of. First bite was okay, but it gets better with every bite. So soft and a hint of matcha flavor. I also bought a pack of lavender & coconut shortbread, which was good. I love shortbread so what more with lavender!\n\nOnce we got back to the city, we made another stop at Boba Guys before heading to the airport. This time I decided to try the Muscat oolong since the guy in the vlog raved about it. And he was right! It was delicious SO GOOD! It's so hard to describe how good it tasted. The lavender milk tea was good, but didn't set this place apart from other boba shops I've tried. But the Muscat oolong did!  All I know is I am DEFINITELY making a stop here for Muscat oolong milk tea whenever I'm in San Francisco! Wish they had this in LA so I can have my fix whenever I need it...", "author": "Grace T."}

From sharing a modest space in the Mission with Ken Ken Ramen to carrying nine locations across the Bay Area and New York?  Pretty damn impressive!  Which speaks to their obvious popularity...and how good their milk tea is!  Well, that and all of the positive reviews.  And the hype.  And the photos all over Instagram.  And the lines.  Clearly, Quickly's, this is not!\n\nNow, when I first heard that there was a Boba Guys near my work, I knew it was only a matter of time before I found my way here.  However, that shortened up to just a couple of days when I realized they were actually just a couple of blocks away!  Surprisingly (or not so surprisingly?), there were a decent amount of people here on a random weekday afternoon.  Which actually worked out well, since it still moved decently fast while giving me time to figure out what to get from their intriguing drink selection!\n\n-- HONG KONG STYLE MILK TEA (iced) - Black Tea Blend with Organic Condensed Milk...$4 (16oz)\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/boba-guys-san-francisco-15?select=TwX6sZYhJgF9uDzdND-R3Q)\nI won't lie - the condensed milk is what really caught my eye.  Ironically though, I actually didn't taste much of it (though I did ask for 50% less sweet...).  Similarly, while the taste of the tea itself was fine, I thought the drink as a whole was a little watery, so getting \"less ice\" might be the way to go.\n\n-- CLASSIC MILK TEA (Pre-bottled) - Signature Black Tea Blend with Milk - $4.50\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/boba-guys-san-francisco-15?select=WMo4qkQIYKEvmmauq8CCTg)\nI'm not sure how the flavor of this compares to getting it \"fresh\", but it was as good as the first time I had it years ago.  Not only is the tea blend they use terrific, but I really like how balanced and flavorful the milk tea itself was - not too milky or thin nor was it abrasively sweet.\n\nSince neither of the two drinks I tried here had toppings of any kind, I can't speak to anything other than the drinks themselves (ditto for their food offerings, which all look pretty appealing).  That being said, I do recall the boba being pretty awesome from my first ever trip to Boba Guys and I can't imagine they would have changed the formula at all (given their name and everything...).\n\nConsidering how they aren't all that far away, on top of the fact that Boba Guys are pretty much popping up everywhere, I guess I should look into investing in one of their reusable mason jars...\n\nCheers!", "author": "Mike L."}

I see not a lot of love in the reviews for my actual favorite - the Purple Rain.  This drink has a great balance of sweetness and tartness, is packed with berry goodness and feels worth its price in produce.  For a cafe-type place that has both drinks and baked goods, I'd have to say the baked goods seem almost like an afterthought.  The mochi muffins are well-baked, but experience of these, and probably most of their baked goods would be enhanced if they offered to warm these up for you.  A gooey, chewy, warm mochi muffin is comforting and addictive - a cold one is alright, but forgettable.

The locations for boba guys are great as they're generally located in up and coming areas with some street parking. \n\nI liked the organization, cleanliness, and unique specials that they offered.

Also tried the topping of grass jelly and it was subpar to say the least, felt like it came straight out of a can, it was hard and just plain.  \n\nI did speak to a couple of friends and they recommended the black sesame latte so I'll definitely try that next.", "author": "Amanda L."}

It's truly my drink of choice and I've been to many boba tea shops in my lifetime.\n\nGetting to the point... Boba Guys is hands down one of my all-time favorite milk tea/boba shops. \n\nWhy I LOVE Boba Guys:\n- They use premium, natural, organic ingredients\n- Like a BOSS they make everything in-house and from scratch (rice milk, almond jelly, grass jelly)\n- If you're a fan of black sesame, you MUST order their Black Sesame Latte specialty drink. (Note: The Union Square location doesn't have this flavor)\n- Their milk options don't discriminate from those with dietary restrictions. They have quite the selection and from fancy and top brands: Straus Family Organic Milk, Califia Farms Almond Milk, Organic Soymilk, Oatly Oat Milk. (My personal favorite is the Oatly Oat Milk!)\n- Most of their drinks are customizable in sweetness and ice level.\n- Unique flavors like horchata, Hojicha, Chamomile Milk, Strawberry Matcha\n- The entire store is IG-worthy, including their Strawberry Matcha drink (trust me on this--it's gorgeous and makes you not want to mix the vibrant colors)\n\nToo bad I live in LA and so far from the SF and NY locations. It's no joke that I'm always craving a refreshing and satisfying drink from them. Last time I was in SF I visited two days in a row and it left me wanting more.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Strawberry Matcha Latte - this is one of the ones they're really known for, but if you don't like Matcha green tea..you should probably steer clear!\n2. Horchata Milk tea with Almond Jelly (but don't order this if you don't like Horchata!!)\n\nPretty intuitive advice, no? Well, fine!..i guess I'm not as smart as you!!\n\nOther honorable mentions:\n- Their Dirty horchata\n- Coffee Milk Tea\n- Classic Black Milk Tea\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that they offer 3 different varieties of milk - oat milk, regular milk and almond milk!

We hogged the counter seats where they do the nitro brew stuff, I think. I love the vibe here. \n\nAs for the boba, I decided to try the Hong Kong milk tea, for the first time ever. Probably not my favorite. I didn't know it was condensed milk in it, so it was super sweet. My friend pushed me to ask for more tea, but I hate doing stuff like that.

Boba Guys are probably the most popular boba place and I don't know why! \"Taste our Grade A balls\" NO THANKS THEY SUCK! \n\nOkay... maybe I should back it up a little bit. So I had scoured SF for the best boba place around and found myself here. When we went in, I could already feel that nice hipster vibe, and was enjoying myself. And then we ordered our drinks... and things went downhill from there. I ordered the Jazzcat with no milk, my mom ordered the Lychee Rose with no milk, and my dad originally wanted the Taro Smoothie, but figured it had milk. He asked anyways though. Here's how our cashier responded, \"Oh, well we make our Taro smoothie with rice milk and only an ounce of regular milk.\" My dad asked if he could just have a smoothie with all rice milk, but the cashier refused and insisted on having an ounce of milk in the drink. Finally, my dad gave up and changed his order to a Jasmine Green Tea without milk. \n\nAfter 5 minutes of waiting, we finally got our drinks. One problem: my Jazzcat and my mom's Lychee Rose had been made with milk. *facepalm* so we told them that we had ordered without milk and had them make it again, which took another 5 minutes or so. Then they finally got us the drinks.\n\nThe Jazzcat was decent, the tea was very fragrant and I could taste the flowery jasmine along with the sweet muscat. The boba, however, was subpar and was hard and had a weird aftertaste.\n\nThe Lychee Rose was pretty good too and had a nice fragrant rose taste, along with a fruity Lychee undertone. Again, the boba was rock solid.\n\nThe Jasmine green tea was good too and had that nice jasmine flavor. I think I could get one just as good anywhere else, though. Anyways, the boba in that was hard, and I regret not ordering an almond jelly in mine.\n\nOverall, my experience at Boba Guys wasn't too great, and I'm sure that I could get WAY better boba tea in SF elsewhere.

The flavors are interesting so it's worth going for the eccentric flavors.

They are pretty busy, so my guess is they were being efficient and nothing stood out as outstanding or bad - and yes there is usually a line out the door. If you want prompt coffee I would go elsewhere. This location is very clean, with some places to sit (but not relaxing, and leave your computer at home). The interior is great, they take pride in their small chain of stores around the Bay Area, and it shows.\n\nLove their specialty drinks with balls. You can't really go wrong with balls, but these are especially good. My personal favorite is the dirty chai latte, but make sure you request the balls as none of the drinks include them by default.\n\nIm not a big fan of their coffee by itself, and their balls aren't ready until 11am, so my personal recommendation is to wait until 11 or later. I wasn't impressed with the food (there's only 2 options i believe, both toast with ingredients on them. One of them was alright, but i probably wouldn't order either again). due to the amount of time it takes to wait in line and order, Its more of an experience best done with friends while walking around Potrero.

While it's sort of convenient of a location, why did it have to be right between 2 Caltrain stops...  Similar interior to their other locations, this one does provide a bit more seating than most which is great.  They have a small bar area set up for those who want to try some Nitro Tea, which I highly suggest you do if you're here.  It's great, and doesn't cost that much more than the regular milk teas.  I'm a little concerned with the quality here compared to the other stores as the coconut green tea I had was a bit different from the other locations I've had it at.  It was much more floral for some reason and I guess it had a bit too much sweetener inside.  Still good, but maybe they're still working out the kinks here.  I love the Nitro Tea here and hope they expand it to their other stores soon, that stuff is so incredibly smooth and refreshing!  Also, while I spent a while waiting in line here, the drinks came out incredibly fast compared to their other locations, so just an observation there.\n\nPros:\n-Nitro Tea Bar\n-Serves Pastries and snacks\n-Decent amount of seating (if not there is a park right outside with benches too)\n-Quality Boba of course.\n\nCons:\n-The location is a bit far to walk to from Caltrain in the blazing sun, but it's still worth it.", "author": "Bryson L."}

Came to get a Matchata, which is a blend between horchata & green tea (matcha), a suggestion that a friend of mine had made to me. In regards to how I found it? The bubbles are just as good as they've always been. Good consistency, texture, and not too hard or soft. Now as for the drink & the concept itself? Personally, I found the matcha in this particular drink to be a bit overpowering ... a little too strong for my particular liking. Reason being that having too much of it tends to give you a much more bitter drink that doesn't go well with the normal sweetness that is found in milk tea in general. The horchata part of the drink wasn't actually too bad though ... the part of the drink that I actually liked. Overall, a worthy boba joint worth stopping into to pick up a drink. The basic black milk tea is pretty good & there are other drinks I'd like to try the next time I'm at this chain again.

I even offer them to just give me the puree on the side to allow them to maintain inventory (although that's the actual part that's hard and important to running a restaurant?  not concept, not flavor but inventory control).  It's odd to shift that burden to your customer.  I wasn't asking for them to cook me a chicken instead of tea.  I was asking for them to do rare instead of medium rare.  It would actually take even less work than steak customization which requires extra attention.\n\n3) You guys may jump on the \"he weird af\" part, but oddly enough that part doesn't actually make me that mad.  The guy was just confused because the owners miseducated him regarding what matcha is, I think?\n\n4) I understand if maybe the Boba Guys owners have decided specifically to prevent the Third Place-ification of Boby Guys.  Perhaps they've read Griffiths and Gilly 2012 (http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1094670511430530).  There are well studied detrimental effects on business.  But I believe they are far away from this and and many benefits of a cafe on the local community stand to be realized still (see Jeffres 2009 http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&context=clcom_facpub)\n\nI'm past mad now.  I think I've made it past my blind rage at these continued interactions.  I have less the antediluvian anger of Noah and more the lament of a post-Exilic Jeremiah.\n\nTo sum it up, all I'm asking for again is just some respect and inclusion of the customer in the process.  I'm not gonna weave some long weird story of how matcha was a deeply religious and ceremonial part of chinese culture (Chanyuan Qinggui).\n\nI just don't want to feel completely excluded from this long important and typically deeply refreshing relationship between a person and their local watering hole.  It's the last hope I have of slowing the effects outlined in \"Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community.\"\n\nWelcoming cafes and the like have been the seed to many of man's most beautiful moments, the organizational and ideation nucleus of many reactionary movements\n\nThe Enlightenment (Parisian cafes)\nThe Boston Tea Party (Boston taverns)\nThe French Revolution (Caf\u00e9 de Foy)\nThe 1886 Haymarket Rally (Greif's Hall)\nLGBTQ movement (Stonewall Inn and various other gay bars)\nArab Spring (https://youtu.be/lstnsT2JPnc)\n\nYou don't need to help change the world!  You can offer solstice against a world that is hard to change.  Some platonic examples include:\n\nCheers from Cheers\nMoe's from The Simpsons\nCentral Perk from Friends\nMacLaren's from HIMYM\n\nIt's a mental sanctuary and physical / spiritual refreshment meant to, if not the light, be at least the salt in an otherwise wage slave existence.\n\nAgain, not every local cafe needs to change human history.  But living up to that the nobility of the profession is something worth striving for.  I'm not saying Boba Guys has the moral obligation to lead a reversal of America's increased segmentation and tendency to \"bowl alone.\"\n\nSo I'm not going to fault them for not doing so.  But it'd be nice if you didn't make it so apparent that our relationship of patron and cafe is 100% transactional and insult your customers in the process.\n\nThe rejection of my attempt to encourage this relationship towards something less Mammon-istic is, after contemplation, much more saddening than maddening.", "author": "Randall L."}

No apology or even a smile. They need to work on their service skills. Drink itself was fine but mission location is still better.", "author": "Connie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-20", "description": "While I admire their effort to provide the best ingredients, their execution was not great. The tea was very dilute and it tasted like water (even though I got light ice). Boba was on the softer side and not that chewy, although it was sweet. Sure it's boba but not as great as they claim to be if they're using the best ingredients.", "author": "Doris H."}

The matcha milk tea had very minimal matcha flavor!\n\nNote: if you feature the brand \"Strauss organic milk\" so prominently in your displays and ads, and also your website http://www.bobaguys.com/faq/ as a reason for your high prices, you should probably use Strauss organic milk =X.  On a recent visit, none of the many gallons of milk behind the counter were Strauss!", "author": "T Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-25", "description": "I finally got around to trying Boba Guys, and I can officially say I am converted and addicted. I first tried their iced Matcha Latte, and boy, did it live up to its hype. I tried it with their Oat-Milk, which honestly is amazingly good by itself, and will only add the Oat-milk now. The Matcha Latte was sweet and creamy. My next drink was the Strawberry Matcha Latte, and was it really good. It almost tasted like a Mexican Strawberry Agua Frescas drink with Milk & Boba.  My goal is to try everything on the menu. I hope Boba Guys eventually expand to Berkeley. Their Boba Balls are very chewy, maybe a little too chewy for my liking. IMO, if comparing it to Purple Kow Boba Balls, I still think Purple Kow balls are much easier to chew on. Keep it up guys", "author": "Michelle F."}
