It always proves to be a place of serenity, elegance, first class service and hospitality. I have a tradition of visiting the SFMOMA, so having the St. Regis next door makes for a quick and easy visit. \n\nThe hotel room and bathroom are spacious. There is a desk and vanity area, as well as spacious closets. The feel is modern, streamlined, and the hotel atmosphere is subdued and peaceful. By the way, the hotel is a few blocks away from Yank Sing, my favorite place for dim sum! Win-win!! \n\nOne of their services I'm looking forward to trying is their version of Afternoon Tea. Absolutely love this hotel!", "author": "Elaine O."}

I consider myself an afternoon tea snob and prefer going to tea service that have modern and elegant ambiance, with aesthetics in their food and presentation to match. St. Regis, definitely did not disappoint and is now my favorite afternoon tea spot in SF (savory, sweets, service, ambiance).     \n\nI took my BFF here to celebrate her birthday and we opted for the regular tea without the alcohol $69/person (before tax and tips).  \n\nAMBIANCE: \nThe tea is in the hotel lobby/bar area which has very modern and clean vibe. We were seated at parallel sofas with a coffee table in between us giving it a very relaxed and chill vibe, but also a little weird to eat with such a low table. \n\nTEA/FOOD: \nWe were given different types of tea leaves to sniff and choose from. The tea came in a French press and a set of timers, which was pleasantly new to me. The savory and sweets came out at the in a beautifully presented triangle display with a colorful array of small assorted bites. Unlike, a lot of afternoon tea places, they had a variety of savory bites - not just sandwiches. They were all very food and flavorful, though pretty small. I enjoyed all the sweets! Every single one! All the high tea places I've been to, either underwhelmed me with at least 1-2 of their selections or just had overly sweet pastries. We especially enjoyed their jalapeno corn bread with corn cream. The only thing missing from their selection are scones! They offered jam and cream, but no scones! Where are the scones?\n\nSERVICE: \n10/10. Our server went above the beyond for our service! Very attentive and friendly.  \n\nVerdict: Had a great experience, but for $69+ we expected at least some additional scones. But their savory and sweet selection were nearly perfect.", "author": "Samantha F."}

It is a classy place and they will do all that they can to make your visit pleasant.\n\nThe lobby bar is way overpriced and not really worth it.  Simple mixed drinks are in the mid to high teens as far as price.  I got a moscow mule that wasn't very tasty.  Whatever they used for the ginger component was not very good at all, I would not get that drink again, it was very disappointing and my friend had the same and thought the same as I did.", "author": "Ty C."}

My friend and I love high teas and made reservation to try right the way.  It was the Chinese New Year celebration month therefore the high tea menu was special with Chinese dim sums.  We were excited about the Chinese New Year special high tea menu.  Unfortunately the dim sums did not meet our high expectation.  The flavors were delicious.  The ingredients tasted fresh and the dim sum wraps/buns tasted housemade.  The only disappointing element of these dim sums is the thick dim sum wraps/buns.  They looked good, just not delicate nor tasted delicate the quality dim sums my friend and I anticipated.\n\nI love their selections of teas and our waiter's service that day!  He was courteous and patient with my questions for the teas they serve.  The pastries/scones/macaroons/finger sweets were delicious!  I would definitely go back for their regular high service menu.\n\nWe also learned that day about their champagne sabering evening ritual on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 6pm.  It was fun watching the champagne sabering ceremony.  I brought a few visitors there for this unique experience.", "author": "Gina W."}

I was pretty hungry so I ordered their fried chicken tenders but it was quite good. The desserts were definitely the highlight!! The opera cake was to DIE for....

Though Milan, the Server, went above and beyond for his excellent service. Food quality however was horribly disappointing. At $69 a serving, the pastry quality is beyond poor. Among the cakes in the tea serving, the roll cake was stale, cream topping wasn't fresh; the bacon in small croissant bite was simply disgusting! Fruits in the fruit tart were dehydrated. There was also a shrimp wrap and it was loose and fallen apart the moment it was picked up. The list went on:(\n\nThe restaurant bar is in a nice hip setting.

This was the first time that I reserved the St. Regis for our holiday tea and it will be the last holiday tea that I have there. When I called to make the reservations I specified the seating that I wanted. The individual at the reservations desk advised that it wouldn't be a problem. When I received the confirmation call I verified the seating again and advised of a seafood allergy. It was weird that the holiday menu had all seafood tea sandwiches and not one traditional tea sandwich.\n\nWhen my friends and I showed up they had us seated in the wrong area and definitely with the wrong server. She comes over to take our order I advise that only 2 are having the full tea services and 2 were just having tea. She looks at us and didn't know what to say??? Annoying.....I confirm with her that there is a seafood allergy and that I will just take the traditional tea service instead of the holiday menu.... again blank stare...uhm yea this is when the server is suppose say \" yes I do see that there is a note specifying a seafood allergy\".... \"your tower will be right out\"....instead she said that she didn't know if it could be replaced......huh!@&#...not to mention that both menu options were posted on the website as well as the reservationist sent me the PDF for both Holiday and Traditional Tea menus. I requested for the manager to come over because I wasn't getting anywhere with clueless. The manager comes over, I had to explain it again. He's trying to explain how it's suppose to be..... which is something different than what was confirmed with me...... I told him that we were on our way to dinner after tea so we only wanted 2 towers. I could appreciate his suggestions but at some point you have to know when to quit while you're ahead. He said since we didn't want 4 towers for there. He could have 2 packed to go......Da Fuq. So...what? We're supposed to pay $140.00 for you to box up 4 sandwiches and a few sweets. Not to mention, there wasn't going to be any tea included and carry this to dinner with us and by the time we get home it's either mush or hard as biscuits?.....What a joke. Except I didn't laugh. Ok so we finally start our tea service, nothing special... (some things are meant to stay simple and be perfected )we probably should have left after our first cups of tea because our server took an extremely long time to refresh our hot water. It's like she didn't want to or knew how to serve us and tried to leave us hanging, like we would just go away....so again we didn't go away, we just won't be back. 2 other servers assisted us and were very nice and quick. Gawd I can go on.....it's clear that I wasn't a fan.", "author": "Stacie J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-09", "description": "This review is for afternoon tea, which is offered everyday from 2-4pm with at least 24 hour advance reservations.  They will take a credit card number when you call, ask if you have any food allergies, and inform you of their 24-hour cancellation policy to avoid any charges.  The cost is $65 per person and goes up if you choose some bubbly to go along with your tea.  Pretty pricey, but it seems to be the going rate for tea service in the fancy hotels in the area.  Service was professional and courteous, and the ambiance nice.  We were seated in a cozy spot with couch seating by the fire.  Expect to see mostly tourists and business travelers here.  \n\nYou can visit the St. Regis website to view the food menu and look at the tea options.  I would have to say portions were pretty small for the price of the tea service.  The savories were ok, but I think I preferred the sweets.  (It's usually the other way around for me.)  They have samples of tea that you can smell to help you decide what to order.  I like fruity teas so I went with the Mountain Berry which I liked.  \n\nFYI: if you are driving here, you can park in the garage on Mission St. that is just about a block away.  \n\nAfternoon Tea in the St. Regis Lobby Lounge is one of the more expensive options in town but a nice once-in-awhile splurge for the experience.", "author": "Carnita M."}

But here's the thing - the drink menu is a little misleading.  It lists prices - but SOME drinks come with an upcharge.  That's not marked on the menu.  So that $14.00 drink is really $17.00.  The explanation is that some drinks come with more alcohol because they come in a bigger glass, and it would look funny if the glass were only 2/3 full.  Fine - I accept that.  BUT THE MENU should reflect that.  Is $3.00 a big deal?  No.  But it IS the principle.  In the end, Brian, the manager, agreed that it was misleading.  He removed the upcharges, and  that's why the fourth star.  Great environment, great staff, but ask about the prices...", "author": "Daniel O."}

They've got the bar seating, two party tables, couch/lounge seat for bigger groups.\n\nAs expected, their cocktails were $14-18 each. They've got wine, champs, cocktails, beer, and even dessert drinks. Beers are about $9-11 I think. We didn't try any of their appetizers because we wanted to save our appetite for dinner. I ordered La Pisco. Mine was somewhat strong, which I liked. I sipped on it cause I can't hang anymore lol. Mine was for sure better than what my bf got. Boyfriend ordered a La Pistola. His had one large cube of ice and one slice of jalapeno. I didn't like his at all. My friend and her fiance ordered beers. They provide complimentary snacks--- spicy cheddar popcorn and corn nuts in cute little bowls.\n\nAfter we had dinner, we sat at the bar to watch the last quarter of the Warriors game.

She wanted coffee. I opted for a diet coke. $14.00 I might add.\n\nIt is a swanky, upscale setting in the lobby with a couple of friendly, and talkative bartenders. Comfy seats, overstuffed chairs.

Definitely try the Vesper Royale (~$25) if you're a fan of a VERY boozy drink. If there's a drink to avoid, it's the Elderflower Fizz (I think that's the name). Sounds good in theory but the soda water really waters down the taste. Would have been great had they left the soda water out and kept it with only the sparkling wine as the base\n\nAnd a bonus if you're a points-whore like me: since this is in a Starwood hotel you can earn Starwood points for your spend (which will most likely add up quick)!

Trying to touch the flames would just cause it to go off by itself lol... \n\nI have been here quite a few times on different occasions. When they first opened, there weren't many people, so I liked the fact that it was relatively quiet and I could enjoy a nice quite evening chatting with my friends. \n\nThen now they seem like they are always busy and loaded with people on the weekends. Service has somewhat deteriorated. But you better dress somewhat nicely otherwise the waitress might not be too attentive though the bar tenders are always nice. \n\nIt's also a great place to have desert as you can order desert from the menu till 10pm which comes from AME. Most of them are excellent. And so are the snack sized appetizers.\n\nI always order the Yuzu drop and the wine and sake list is also pretty extensive.", "author": "JET T."}

Yes, the decor is nice, in that it's got a line of fire here and there which, don't get me wrong, is very cool, but I think a distinction between decor and ambiance is in order here. \n\nI say that because, while the decor is nice, the ambiance is a bore. 1) Because this place is in the lobby of a hotel it's very well lit. Two things that should never mix are alcohol and bright lighting. And 2) also because it's part of the hotel, there's a good number of middle aged people waddling around. Again, middle age and alcohol..two things that should never mix at a bar. \n\nSo, empty, this place is very nice because you can focus in on the decor, but the crowd and overall ambiance to this place make me...well..want to hit the bottle.", "author": "Shreya C."}

The entire crowd looked fantastic - it made me want to go max out my credit card on BCBG and Louboutin. For the ladies, they have a great, varied cocktail list, and the ones I tried were delicious. My favorite was this berry cocktail that was the equivalent of a berry mojito, and I probably drank one too many of them. \n\nThe bartender was very attentive even when it got crowded, and the number 1 thing that I loved: THERE WAS ALWAYS AN OPEN SEAT! Maybe it was just luck, but I never had to stand if I didn't want to. That was major. \n\nIf you're looking for dancing, or at least some hip grooves (wow that sounds like something an old woman would say), the bar at the W is a better spot because they have a DJ.

We hustled over to the much more sedate Ame bar at the St. Regis and it was a breath of fresh air.  So serene but not boring - just so much more elegant.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed the beautiful surroundings and the crowd of friendly well dressed tourists and locals.  \n\nThe bartender was friendly and welcoming.  Lately I have experienced a happy rash of bartenders at the nicer places all too willing to provide tastes of the various wines on offer until I'm satisfied with my choice.  The St. Regis bar was no different.  You do pay handsomely - $14 for a Sancerre - but it is so nice to feel well taken care of.  A really nice spot for a friendly drink and some excellent bar snacks.  \n\nThe experience was so nice I forgot I wasn't actually having a glass of wine at a friends place, and at the end of the evening got up to leave without paying.

But, when Vino Venue was shut down due to the faceless corporate asshats who refused to pay the lease for eight months (**SOBS**), one of my favorite \"bartenders\" from there got a job at the St. Regis Lobby Bar, so I had to check it out. In doing so, I met two of the most fabulous bartenders on the face of the earth--Darius & Rafael. (I have since met Brian, who is also great.) These guys KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING, and it doesn't hurt that they are just wonderful and fun to be around. Half the time, I just let them make me whatever they feel like, because they can make some tasty-ass shit that is not on the drink menu. \n\nWhat else should you know? Oh yes...the ladies of the evening. The SFPD has actually distributed a photocopy containing various photos of several known high-class sex workers who have been photographed working the area, including The Reeg and the XYZ bar. That was an amusing thing to see. \n\nAlso, as has been mentioned, the drinks are absurdly expensive. I give the place--specifically the bartenders--five stars, but the bar manager just raised the prices of the specialty drinks from $12 to $14. Really? Was that really necessary? Bothersome. - 1 star for that.\n\nThe crowd is on the older side, but even though I'm in my late 20s, I like it.

We learned that if you put your hand in it, the flames jump down. I think this is to keep the douchebag clientele from seriously harming themselves after getting sauced on $10 - $15 cocktails (really, now!). The second best part is that the staff here will just naturally assume you're a hotel guest and treat you like royalty: there is a lot of door opening-and-holding as well as offers to get drunk girls a cab AND carry their purses AND open the cab door  AND make sure you know where you're going...not that any of that happened to me. \n\nDrinks are pricey- wine by the glass is in the $15-$20 range and cocktails are not cheap but that's why you should come here with someone who will buy your drinks for you. This will make for a much better experience. The seating is comfortable and cozy and the douches get drunk early and head up to their rooms, which makes relaxing and enjoying one's drinks much easier. And quieter.

Everything from the furniture (high end hotel quality, sleek and low and as minimalist as you can get while still having cushions) to the light fixtures to the bar (which I'm remembering now as marble, but don't quote me on it, I rarely sidle up to the actual bar) to the laser-safetied fire feature to the murals (yes, those murals; I've spent a goodly amount of time staring at these things, have gone back and forth on it and am decided, and will debate any of you on this)--it's all so gorgeous, you see, and every few months or so I get a yen, an actual physical longing, to head back. \n\nAs for other aspects of the ambience, I'll put it to you this way: It never gets too loud, and the service has always been impeccable (the latter being what you expect, and pay for, at places like the St. Regis, the former being very important to me because who ever turns to their companion while sitting in a bar and says, You know, it could be *louder* here? No one, that's who). \n\nOh--I suppose you want to know about the cocktails and victuals themselves. Well, I'm here to tell you that they're delicious--well-crafted, interesting (though they have jumped a shark or two), and composed of top shelf booze (ie, good shit). And that's what I'd say about the food, too: usually quite lovely with the occasional downer, well-crafted and made with good ingredients. \n\nLastly, for some years back then there was a waitress who was literally an angel, that's what Eddie and I called her, it seemed like she was always the one to wait on us and she had these bright soft eyes and olive skin and I saw her once on the street in a sundress in SOMA (it was one of the 14 hot days in San Francisco between 2007-2010), she was smiling and walking towards me, and my life for several glorious paces became like a music video, everything behind her got blurry and watery and there was just her walking down the street, brighter than the sunlight. Well, she's gone now I think, I haven't seen her in a year or more. I always kind of wanted to say something, make a move, but then felt like such an impostor. Me, a paralegal, a failed writer, sipping my $14 cocktails in the St. Regis lobby. What would happen if she saw my Wizard's knobby knees? \n\n\nps: Dear St. Regis, Wanna know why you're getting 4 stars instead of 5? It's because you're chintzing on your snacks. You used to offer wasabi peas and hickory smoked almonds and a cute little melange of rice cracker thingies, and now the almonds are gone and the peas are gone and in their stead you're offering these like high-end cheese doodles and some other garbage. Hey! You're the fuckin St. Regis Hotel for god's sake! You may think you're serving me nourishment with my, ah, $14/15 cocktail(s)--ok, cocktails--but really all you're doing is putting in front of me three little trays of evidence that some pencil-necked and -pushing twerp back at the Regional Office found some way to boost the San Francisco hotel's bottom line by .8%. Fucker. Stop being so fucking cheap. You're the, ah, I believe I mentioned, St. Fucking Regis--your entire existence is predicated on the practice of needlessly spending money. Cut the shit and bring back a) the peas, and b) the almonds. You're plutocrats, all your hotel guests are plutocrats, and most of your hotel bar customers are plutocrats (with the remainder being, like your correspondent, pretenders to a plutocrat throne). Don't you know it's degrading for plutocrats to eat cheese doodles, no matter how haute?", "author": "T U."}

We decided to try it without and it was amazing-tequila, lime juice, hot chili pepper ... what else can you want?\nThe food is pricey but also really good.  I've shared some appetizers with friends and they were all excellent.   It's fun to just hang out at the bar and enjoy the crowd.

I instantaneously felt as though I was in a sauna, and next time I'll head for the less crowded couches by the window. For my taste, every cocktail lounge should just exude sensuality with a low-beautifully candle- lit atmosphere. St. Regis totally got it right here. I also really love their complimentary toasted almonds, wasabi peas and other snacky bar finger foods.

Ladies, when they take their jackets to the bathroom, that's your indicator.  The dude isn't coming back.  I didn't really care,my main concern was that I didn't want to get stuck paying for the drink he ordered. Therefore I needed to relay to the bar staff that I had been ditched..  Their gentlemanly behavior more than redeemed mankind in my book.  Hector took my hand and insisted that I have another drink at the bar.  It was me and a bunch of businessmen sipping Scotch, and I felt very self conscious about suddenly being alone.

The ambiance is easily five stars. It's beautifully appointed and conducive to conversation at one of the intimate tables in their staged, luxe living room. The specialty drinks were amazing. I had a Hiro-tini -- a very dry spicy-ginger/cooling-cucumber combo, while Robert P. enjoyed a sugary yuzu-infused number. Interestingly, our cocktail choices were reflective of our personas, too, since he is young and sweet and optimistic, whereas I am bitter and old and kick a lot. The service just plain sucked after we placed our initial order, though. Our drink wench turned into Jimmy Hoffa on us, so we never had a chance to do a second round (which we would have), so that was a one star experience. It was also annoying that Robert kept doing a terrible Regis Philbin imitation -- saying things like, \"Regis likes his martinis.\" Overall, I'll settle right in the middle because there is a lot of potential here and it is so freaking gawgeous.", "author": "Gregor G."}
