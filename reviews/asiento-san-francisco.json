I checked in but didn't get a cocktail. I was driving, so I wanted to go with something a bit lower proof.\n\nIt's a Spanish-inspired place, and they have a few Spanish wines by the glass as well as some others from various global and domestic locales. I asked and received a taste of the Tempranillo. It was decent and I had a glass of it. The bartender was very friendly about the taste, which I always appreciate. Who wants to commit to a full glass when it might not be to your liking? \n\nThey have a full bar and a pretty long list of craft cocktails to choose from. They also have beer on tap.\n\nAsiento serves what looked like a broad variety of tapas and share plates, but I didn't have anything to eat. I definitely would be interested in giving the food a try in the future.\n\nAtmosphere: It wasn't very crowded on a Tuesday night, and that was perfectly fine with me. It has a neighborhood-y feel--something more upscale than a dive, but still casual, friendly and approachable. Seating options include tables, the bar, and some leather couches and chairs. It's a good date place or a place to get a casual drink after work.", "author": "Sara E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-12-07", "description": "When I'm being fickle about what to eat, tapas are always a safe bet. I can try a little of everything and my tastebuds will be happy from the variety. So on the often occasion that I'm eating late but don't know what to eat, I open yelp, type tapas, click Open Now, and pick one. Asiento always comes up in my search because the kitchen conveniently closes an hour before the bar closes, which is 11pm Sun-Wed and midnight Thurs-Sat. \n\n3 stars because I didn't realize this place is more of a bar than a restaurant. I was just starving and wanted to finally check this place out, but I was thrown off because there was a legit bouncer at the door checking IDs. I guess that's my bad because I didn't thoroughly sieve through photos and reviews, but I figured maybe it'll be like one of those cool gastropubs or hopefully even a nice Latin American bar w/ food.\n\nMy hopes were set too high. I got inside and it was SUPER divey. There was a live DJ but the music was like James Brown radio on Pandora. It's ironic because for a place called \"Asiento\" (Spanish for \"seat\"), it was pretty hard to find somewhere to sit. There are a few couches and bar seating, all of which were taken, so we squished with another couple to use their table because they were just chatting. \n\nHonestly I was too hungry to scramble and switch locations, so we proceeded to order. The food was decent:\n-BOCADILLOS: Sandwich w/ your choice of meat (we chose carnitas), and it was the best thing we ordered. Bread was nicely toasted and the carnitas were flavorful\n-GAMBAS: pretty much gambas al ajillo, not bad but they only give you 4 pcs of shrimp. They served it with grilled bread, but there wasn't enough white wine sauce on the plate to really soak up.\n-QUESO FUNDIDO: Cheese fondue w/ chorizo. The flavor was all there and I would have really liked this, except the cheese was not really melted into a fondue. The chips were breaking trying to scoop it so I had to eat the cheese in chunks with a fork.\n-ASSORTED CHEESE AND SALAMI PLATE: Meh! The brie was fine, but the other two cheeses were as if they went to Safeway or Target and bought a cheese platter. These were thick slices of American-like cheese, so not very appetizing to my palette. The salami and olives salvaged this dish.\n\nSpecialty cocktails were also decent but honestly just not up to par with other places that specialize in mixology. On paper, the flavors looked good. My first drink had strawberries, mezcal, and some sort of chili pepper, which my bf ordered for me because he knows that's my ish, and it was good but not amazing. For my second drink, I ordered something else that also had a spicy kick except with passionfruit and tequila... same reaction. I think the combinations are right, but the balances are off. Good drinks, just not amazing.\n\nNow on another night when I'm not specifically looking for food, I'd give this place another chance if I'm feeling like it's a low key dive bar kind of night. Or if I'm in the area and my prospects for really late decent dining are getting slim, I would not mind getting those bocadillos again. But as a whole, I would not plan a night around here.

Lo and behold, we pulled up and I was like \"Hey,  I remember when it was Cosmos (I think that was the name) years ago.\"\n\nBy all accounts, Asiento is a sweet upgrade to its predecessor.

You walk in, order your food and drinks at the bar, sit down somewhere, and they serve it.

Although the tapas are great, I recommend you visit this place if you are looking to snack on something while you have a drink, not necessarily for dinner. The 5 stars is definitely based on the local being a bar, not a tapas restaurant. That being said, the food is pretty good. You should definitely try the queso fundido with chorizo and the deviled eggs. And of course, the cocktails are even better. \n\nThere's also a lot of entertainment options. Not only is there a bar and a high top table area, but there are also couches where you can sit and play board games with your friends. Bookshelves contain a good number options for you to peek at. I remember I spent one night going through a huge Atlas book with my friends. That time was actually a Tuesday night, and they had a DJ playing chill electronic vibes and it was perfect for the room.

We made the mistake of ordering more and hoping the second round of dishes would be better - they weren't. My cocktail tasted like cough syrup, which didn't help.\n\nPretty good:\nThe bread grilled in garlic olive oil - you get about a quarter of a baguette for $2 which felt a little stingy but also could have been the best value on the menu if they didn't double-charge us for it.\nThe devilled eggs - the usual plus a bit of relish and bacon on top, which seemed unnecessary but didn't hurt.\nThe crab cake salad - I won't even be snarky about this one it was actually delicious.\n\nMeh: The sausage with mustard. The gambas.\n\nAvoid:\nThe queso fundido. We were told this was a \"filling\" dish if we were hungry. We were in fact hungry, but this is the last thing we should have ordered. The thing about serving melted cheese is that you need to start with cheese, and not rubber. Trying to dip or scoop some of this cheese onto a chip was like trying to dissect a dead animal with a bookmark. It was like taking a slice of pizza where the cheese either falls off the slice completely, or you pick up the entire pizza's cheese attached to your single slice. You get the point - the melted cheese wasn't melted.\nThe hummus, which was flavorless and chunky and which should come with more than a few tiny slivers of bread.\nThe spring rolls, which were extremely bland, served on a plate of sauce which tasted like simple syrup suspending bits of red bell pepper, which actually made the rolls taste even less flavorful. The highlight of this dish was that it provoked an interesting philosophical question at our table: can a dish have a negative amount of flavor?\n\nThey have trivia nights and games, so maybe come for one of those as long as you order beer (they can't mess that up, right?) and avoid most of the food.", "author": "Chris M."}

They even have a vast array of board games if you want something interactive to do with some friends. \n\nOn the weekend - Asiento blooms.  They have great DJs - who will spin during the evening - and if you're looking to dance - Asiento will have you grooving in your seat - or on their decent sized dance floor.\n\nIf you're more interested in imbibing on some stellar freshly muddled cocktails and nibbling on an impressive array of delectable finger foods - Asiento has both mastered. \n\nSeriously.\n\nMy friends couldn't stop gushing about the food.  With menu items such as: Spinach Balls made with blanched spinach and jalapeno-lemon aioli and Gambas  - comprised of sauteed shrimp with garlic and white wine -  Asiento truly excels at presenting well proportioned tapas dishes that are light enough to allow you to dance, but filling enough that you won't be hungry later on in the evening. And the best part?  - The price. And for those with food concerns - they also carry gluten free bread and can accommodate many dietary restrictions. \n\nTheir drinks are just as wowing. Though I don't drink - I tried both of my friends' drinks during the evening and I was impressed with how balanced each drink was. Moe -is an award-winning mixologist and he will go out of his way to make sure that each manifested drink is welcomed with a smile.\n\nAs we shook our shoulders to the weekend beats in Asiento that blissful bachelorette evening- we admired the diversity of the crowd. Everyone donned a huge grin. The staff were just as excited to be there.\n\nThere are a lot of great spots in this city for a weekend night out - but if you want a truly excellent experience with artful drinks and food - come to Asiento. If you're looking to plan a big event  - also contact Asiento. They own the space above Asiento and they are able to accommodate bigger groups with true San Francisco flare and ease.\n\nTrust.", "author": "Jessica T."}

Bar tender recommended cognac with some syrup and lemon. It went down easy and my throat loved it. \n\nThey have a Yelp check in deal for the basil lemonade cocktail. All the ingredients are presented beautifully right on the bar. I also liked the set up of high table seating and lounge chairs in the back. There are lots of board games to play. It's a great place to come with a few friends and chill for a long while. \n\nNote that they don't accept credit card. Only cash, debit and those digital payment apps.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-20", "description": "Came here thinking nothing of it. It used to be the Monkey Bar way back when, and I'd always wanted to come here for my first drink as a 21 year old. Clearly...it did not happen...as it closed before I turned 21 way back when.\n\nI checked in to get the $7 for a specialty drink, which is normally $9.50. It's kind of interesting, because evidently the businesses pay yelp for the ability to advertise a discount...so they can get more reviews and visibility? I don't mind. Its $2.5 off for me! \n\nPer usual, I get distracted by the drink name. I got The Good Idea. Which, wasn't a bad idea at all. The drinks aren't strong (I had a sip of multiple drinks), but if was ok. Nicely made, actually. There was some thought put into the specialty drinks.\n\nThe food...initially would have put me at placing this place at a solid 3 stars. Overall, it came in way too small portions (even as tapas), and the flavor was kind of meh. Of all the tapas, I'd go with the squid in sauce because the sauce is delicious. There needed to be more bread with it. No need to grill the bread, just gimmie bread for that sauce! The squid was done well, and when you cook squid in sauce, it's easy for it to be over or under cooked. Well done, chef!\n\nThe other foods were just ok. Quick summary:\n\nGuacamole: Came out pretty, but the long chips makes it hard to eat without double dipping. So if you're germ phobe, no bueno.\n\nSpinach balls: Really odd tasting. Lots of spinach, but there was something else in there making it...weird tasting. Its like a green falafal ball.\n\nThai Spring Roll: Was just a sour sauce with fresh spring roll. Nothing Thai about it. I just tasted basil and bell peppers.\n\nFried Chicken Spring Roll: DON'T GET THIS THINKING ITS FRIED CHICKEN!!! That's what we all thought and it was severely disappointing. It is a chicken spring roll that's been fried. So. Chicken Spring Roll. I think the fresh ones are considered summer rolls.  Sauce was good, food was not. Hurm...i see a trend. \n\nChicken Kabobs: Was ok. The chicken was pretty juicy, and is basically ground chicken meat on skewers. \n\nSo...what bumped me from the solid 3 up to a 4 star?? The Juicy Burger. Seriously, of all things. Juicy burger. The flavors were really great in the meat, though I'm not 100% sure how I feel about the English Muffin bun. It was made mid-rare, which...it did not look like when I first bit into it. However, on hindsight, I think the way they marinated the meat made the meat darker, because even though it LOOKED mid-well, it TASTED mid-rare. \n\nPlus, the owner is a pretty stellar person. She was very nice in talking to us (until it got busy), and wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty. If I had ONE critique about the layout, I'd say that she needs more tables further away from the bar. I saw her servers having to maneuver through a very dense crowd by the bar, but there was NO one in the open space between the bar and bathrooms. I felt bad for the server, and people didn't move out of his way. Seriously, if someone is trying to get through to deliver food to another patron, you should MAKE WAY. Instead of looking over, looking down at them, and continuing talking. I'm talking to you, white group in their 40's!! Maybe if there were tables on that side, people would be more likely to move over? Unless its a dance floor I'm unaware of?", "author": "Lily W."}

She also really cares about her customers (made conversation, and when we left our table to check out the menu on the wall, she watched our stuff since she was concerned someone would take it-stupidly we left our purse/wallet on the table, but we weren't too far from them!)\n\nFor drinks, I ordered the basil lemonade with tequila instead of lemon vodka and it was good but a slightly sweeter taste would have been fantastic.  The basil flavor was nice (just wish I had a spoon to scoop up all the basil that settled to the bottom!) My friend got a beer and liked it.\n\nFor food, we ordered the spinach balls, which were okay, better than expected but not amazing.  We also ordered the veggie burger; I must say that I really hope the burger was vegetarian because it tasted exactly like meat. I heard the server say it had butternut squash and some other veggies in it; I didn't taste any of that; again, it tasted like meat.  It was pretty good but just a lil concerning.  I guess if it tasted that real, then it's a great option for meat eaters! My friend liked the burger and is a meat eater.  The portion size was TINY! I was still hungry after eating lol. \n\nMay return if I am in the area.", "author": "Monica J."}

If you took a moment to think about your mistake in leaving your card in the first place, you would have done what all of us have done when are card numbers have been stolen...

Tasty, and I suspect the chicken they use is similar or the same as the tinga tostadas\n**Gamba. Four giant pieces of saut\u00e9ed shrimp with crunchy bread slices. Delicious, the sauce it was cooked in was awesome.\u00a0\n\nThere was a DJ playing Saturday night, and he was mixing a good mash-up for old and new hip hop and pop music.

It's almost so much so that as a whole, I can't figure out the bar's character. It's certainly a far cry from the bar that was here previously (Monkey's I think).\nAnyway, I only come here for Monday's trivia quiz. The quiz itself is annoyingly USA-centric, so don't even think about playing it without an American sports or pop culture guru in your group. It is unfortunate, as San Francisco is an international city. Thankfully, there are plenty of other quizzes in the city.\nFood and drinks are both overpriced. I would have beer here and skip their cocktails. As fancy as some of them sound, they have been kind of weak on alcohol. And food is, well, small in portions. It is a well-known fact that the tapas trend is the best thing that happened to restaurant owners in America. Charge full price for tiny dish and... ka-ching! Which misses the whole concept of tapas.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-26", "description": "Asiento is a bar that just makes you feel like you are going for a drink a your best friends place. Its such a welcoming and chill environment that you always want to come back if you are in the area. They have a great selection of drinks and the bartenders are very knowledgeable. The drinks have a lot of tequila elements to them but there is a variety I especially liked the Prickly Pear Margarita. They also have a great selection of tapas and other small plates that you will probably need to order around four to five of to fill up but they are all delicious so it is worth the investment especially if you come with a few people to split the cost. \n\nThe crowd is so much fun, everyone seems to be having a good time and there aren't a lot of pretentious people or the feel of the Marina crowd you can get in other places. Asiento is snuggled between a bunch of residential houses and off the beaten path of the mission area so it feels like an undiscovered find when you stumble upon it. The staff was really nice including the owner who came out and chatted with customers and made sure everyone had a good time. They also provide games on Wednesday night to encourage people to mingle and interact. They also have several themed dance nights and I have gone on a full-fledged 80's night which was incredible and I believe the bartenders danced more that we did!\n\nThere is a nice selection of wine for those who prefer that as well. The only issue is that it can get crowded here as a lot of larger groups stop by for the tapas so it can be hard to find a seat at times and it can get very loud when it reaches this point so it can be hard to hear the person you are with over them and the music. Great date spot as the mood is set as soon as you walk in. Also don't forget to pay in cash! Debit is only really good if you are opening a large tab.\n\nOverall though it is a great spot to check out and make yourself a regular. The staff will recognize you and you will wow your friends with your knowledge of local treasures like this one. Hope its around for a long time because SF needs more bars that have gotten over themselves and being cool and are actually cool because they provide excellent service.", "author": "Nick R."}

When we asked why this was suddenly an issue, they said that it fit the description of people who stole a purse in the past, so he had to remove his hat if he wanted to stay in the bar.

My 'Manhootan' was oddly sweet - I'm guessing they either used the honey flavored Jack or were too heavy handed with the aperol.  The gin-based 'Tannenbaum' was really sweet and tasted more like an uncarbonated mojito.  The 'Hummingbird' (tequila+grapefruit) was probably the best drink at our table simple because it was the least sweet.  \n\nOverall, not impressed with the drinks.

The prices are mid-range, the food is way above standard bar fare and the vibe is damn good.\n\nDetails Below...\n\nOne: Asiento fits this perfect middle spot between the excruciatingly expensive, trendy night spots that give that \"you're not hip or rich enough to be standing nuts to butts in here\" and the full-on, yelling-prone halls of shit-shot-and-a-beer chaos. Let me say, however, so you know where I'm coming from, that I'm the kind of guy who prefers the loud, drunk dive over the mixologist bullshit every time I'm not with a beautiful woman, which is to say almost every time. I'd normally lean towards the grungier crowd but this place is great in so many ways that I find myself here often. \n\nTwo: They have real food. One of my favorite burgers in the city is their Juicy Burger. It's small size and few ingredients are assets rather than drawbacks; the thing is just good in savory, salty and creamy (the mayo makes it) ways. The Queso Fundido is as rich and deadly as it is in Mexico, the guacamole is better than average, and their assorted tapas plates are great for sharing.\n\nThree: I've had nothing but good experiences with the staff here. From coming by myself for dinner and a drink to bringing a cadre of friends for a full night of food, drink, dancing and revelry, the bartenders and especially the owner Debi have made my experience overwhelmingly positive. Being a regular here has also translated into privileges and personal treatment (remembering my drink, foods, and even bar hopping with them after closing some nights).\n\nMiscellaneous appreciation: \n\nThey accept Debit (not Credit) cards so it's a step above cash only.\n\nHere There Be Burners - it's not central to the bar but there's a real radical inclusion feel to this place.\n\nLocal talent. Art shows on the walls / Bay Area DJs / board game and trivia location. Makes for a cool visual/auditory  environment. Less hard rock and more soul. Sometimes lighter electronic music.\n\nExtra large open windows provide a view of Bryant St and allow natural light to flood  bar during the day.\n\nDecent brunch options although it is a bar brunch not restaurant brunch with mimosas thrown on. The few times I've done brunch that's exactly what I wanted: full-bar-brunch really shakes things up. Burbon and bacon!\n\nMany vegetarian options, a gluten-free bread option.\n\nI've seen lots of events here and attended two.\n\nOne issue: Pricing is very reasonable for most items although once in a while you can feel like you're paying too much for something. Guacamole and chips for $9 is kind of steep given that you can get one of the best burgers in five neighborhoods for $8. Once you know what the best things are you'll do great (get that damn burger and you won't care for a second). \n\nCome in and don't be shy.

That is the gist of my Asiento story. \n\nThe first time I went here was for a nightcap after a long night of drinking. My friends and I were driving around and popped into the first bar we saw. It was last call and the place looked pretty depressing  -- dark, quiet, and empty except for a few stragglers at the bar. A very forgettable experience. \n\nThanks to another random nightcap a few months later, we happened on this place again, and it was a completely different experience. \n\nSubdued lighting bathed everything in a warm glow. This time, I noticed the spacious seating area, the comfortable leather chairs, and the DJ dishing out the disco. I didn't want to mix my liquors and already started the evening out with wine, so I wasn't able to sample the cocktails. What really got me was their tapas menu. Delicious!\n\nQueso Fundido with Chorizo - Traditionally served with Oaxacan cheese, Asiento's version uses five different cheeses for extra richness and flavor. It's hot, ooey gooey, cheesaliciousness mixed up with ground chorizo that comes with some chips for dipping. Sooo good. \n\nGambas -- Plump, fresh shrimp cooked up in garlic, olive oil served with slices of bread (perfect for mopping up the plate). It was really good, but I was a little disappointed that it only had four pieces of shrimp. That seemed rather stingy to me, even if it was tapas.\n\nCalamares -- The squid was really fresh and soft, cooked in a mild sauce and served with bread. Also very good and although it was just as small a portion as the gambas, it wasn't as glaring because of the way it was served. \n\nMixed Sausages -- Assorted sliced sausages with a mustard dip was pretty much what it said it would be. I'm not sure what sausages they used though.\n\nEverything we ordered was a hit. We enjoyed our drinks, the service was great, the music was great.

Gambas, crab cakes and guacamole all received thumbs up from the table.\n\nThe 5 stars over 4 stars rating is because Debbi (sp?), the proprietor of this establishment, served us and the service was memorable. FYI--there is table service when it's not so busy but when it picks up later, you should order at the bar. This place has a chill, comfortable, fun and dare I say slightly edgy ambiance. For drinks, we had the basil lemonade, bitten cherry, punch (all sort of sweet) but 5 stars for the Debbi's willingness to create a pisco sour. Would definitely come back.\n\nI'm kind of a fan of the building's odd paint job, which appears to be an homage to outer space/haight-ashbury/the third eye but notably, the inside is unexpectedly modern.", "author": "Madam Y."}

I stopped by for Yelp Drink Week yesterday and when I walked in, it was COMPLETELY empty. I thought that was so bizarre, being 7PM and all. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the Cucumber Rosemary and Basil Lemonade. The bartender took about 5 minutes making EACH drink. The basil lemonade was good but a bit watered down. THe cucumber rosemary had a good cucumber taste. We also ordered the Lemon Hummus ($6) which came with a large portion of hummus and only 7 small pieces of bread. The hummus was really good but we ran out of bread so fast and they charge $3.00 for more!!!! Seriously?! Can you say CHEAP?\n\nMy biggest concern with this place is that they charge a $20 minimum for DEBIT CARDS. I know for a FACT that restaurants are NOT allowed to charge a minimum of over $10, and nothing at all for debit transactions. My friend and I were discussing that in FRONT of the bartender and he STILL said there was a minimum. \nhttp://usa.visa.com/about_visa/ask_visa/index.html#anchor_4\n\nOverall, definitely pass this place, even for Yelp Drink Week. If you don't take my word for it, take the word of the 20-30 possible patrons that also decided to go somewhere else yesterday.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

The prices for the food are 1-3 dollar more than what they should be but are in keeping with SF and hipster Mission food prices.\n\nThe virgin cocktails were good and the food came out quick. Although they are called tapas and even have the same names the dishes here are more South American than Spanish. Everything had more spice and zing in it than you would find in Spain. The gambas were good although there were only 4, The veggie bocodillas were good as was the shrimp ceviche both of which had a spicy remoulade sauce. The spring rolls were tiny and too sweet for my taste.\n\n4 tapas and two drinks came to 38 dollar so it's a reasonable place to get a light meal and drinks. The space is nice with sound baffling panel, have only been there early in the evening when there wasn't many people.

One of the last places I want to hear rap music in on 10:00 on a Friday while I'm talking to my friends and enjoying the environment. Not that I don't dig some underground rap but let's be honest, if music is preventing us from having conversation it better be encouraging us to move our behinds. And it wasn't making me want to move my behind anywhere except out of that place.\n\nIf the place going from packed to nearly empty wasn't a sign that you shouldn't bring live music back. Then I'm thinking maybe you prefer your place pretty empty, I don't know. \n\nOnce again, dude had talent but I just didn't go to Asiento on a Friday for live music. \n\nI'd love to come back here when there's no obnoxiously loud music and give this place a higher review!", "author": "Matt L."}

The owner is really nice (she was introducing herself, going around tables, and offering everybody brownies). All in all, I really like the ambiance of the bar. Although it hasn't really been discovered yet, it was still pretty hopping (considering its location in the Mission) for a Friday night. Every seat was filled, but you didn't have to deal with any standing crowds, which was nice.\n\nA couple of things though -- drinks here are pretttty expensive. A tumbler of neat Jameson was $7 (it's $5 around the corner at JayBee's) and well drinks are $6. Pretty bad for the Mission, especially this far east. The seating arrangement is also kind of awkward. My party lucked out with getting seats at the long table, but I noticed that immediately behind us were wooden benches along the wall.

I came here on a Friday with the intention of getting happy hour with friends but I'm not actually sure if we made it to their happy hours since there weren't any deals really. The specialty cocktails are $9.50. My favorite was the good idea which was a gin based drink. It smells like a delicious citrus concoction. Yes I sniffed my drink and yes it was alcoholic. So in hindsight if it did smell alcoholic it would have been a terrible idea to sniff it but thankfully it smelled glorious. We also ordered a lot of different tapas. My favorites were the sausages and the ceviche...also the shrimp. They're all decently portioned and great for sharing amongst friends. Definitely more than just your typical bar food. They also have board games. #win. They have drenga (drinking jenga). The clever fools marked a bunch of the blocks with \"buy a round of drinks\" so we kept having to buy rounds for everyone. We also included the stipulation that if you knocked over the jenga tower you had to buy a round. So let's just say everyone got sufficiently drunk.

When our food finally came (which felt like too a little long) they gave me what I ordered, but my husband got a \"breakfast burrito\".  \nBecause we didn't want to cause any issues & because we didn't want to send anything back and wait another 30 minutes for the right order, my husband opted to keep the burrito.  \n\nWe were both less than impressed with our food.  The crab cake was actually pretty disgusting I couldn't even eat more than a bite.   I swallowed maybe half of the tots, but completely did not feel satisfied with the food, especially figuring I could have gone to the corner store and bought the same frozen tots myself and made them at home. \n\nMy husband had a couple of bites of the burrito and it was mostly just filler crap inside and it was gross.  For the price, you'd expect something a little better.  Personally, I would have been more satisfied eating a McDonalds. \n\nThe two stars I'm giving is for the lemonade that tasted pretty good and the friendly staff.  Although, to be honest, we shouldn't have had to pay for the bartender/waitresses mistake by not entering the correct food in.

Luckily, progressive ground coffee across the street from Asiento has some pretty great food.

There were four people in our party, I was the only one who hadn't eaten at Asiento before.  Also, we were not drinking, as I had to drive shortly, and everyone else was hung over.  I mention that, because the drinks looked interesting.\n\nThe server, who kept using the excuse \"Oh, I only work here on weekends\", was barely available, refilled our water glasses by carrying them back to the bar and sitting them all down randomly and then returning them, possibly switching them, and was fairly inattentive.  Also, our food came from the kitchen two plates at a time with an appreciable gap between delivery.  So, half the people at the table awkwardly waited while their food got cold for ours to be delivered.\n\nThat I could let pass, but when we got our food a full 45 minutes after we ordered, and there was a hair IN my food, it was over for me.  And, let me clarify, the hair was underneath one of the English muffins of my Eggs Benedict - so it's not like it fell off my coat (which I was wearing because it was cold in there).  Also, it was not a type of hair that anyone ever wants in their food.  The server was apologetic about it, but I was done.  I had her take my plate and I took off.\n\nI get that this place is trying to be cute - recycling bags and boxes into menus, not having straws (?!?), and using Heinz ketchup bottles full of some other crappy ketchup - but it's so not working for me.  Honestly, with a bunch of other brunch places that turn out consistent, high quality, tasty, clean food (Beretta and Schmidt's come to mind), I can't see why I'd ever go here again.\n\nOne star for most everything, one star for the live DJ who was actually playing things that were cool; he was the best part.", "author": "Kim S."}

She was handling the whole bar alone, and with ease - knew a lot of the customers by name but treated us as if we were part of the family. All the time with a calm and beatific smile.

You are super close to my apartment and workplace, so you are naturally of interest to me--who doesn't want to find a great place for food and drink near their home and work?  Highlights?  The owner/manager is present a lot, and is great with customers.  The tapas, limited though they are, are well done and very tasty.  Drinks are perhaps a bit stingily poured (draft beer in a small glass, not a pint), but the house cocktails are creative and they use good ingredients (Blue Coat gin!).  Really nice interior that is casual and well designed at once.\n\nWays I would like to see Asiento grow: Please be consistent!  As a neighbor, I walk by all the time...sometimes you are open, sometimes you aren't, but there is little consistency.  I've checked the sign several times, promising delicious service at the very hour i stand there, but to no avail.  It would be rough to set a time to be there with others, since the open hours seem to change a lot. \n\nAlso, the brunch scene seems to be improving in terms of food service (i love the $2 for several items, \"build your own\" breakfast).  Big downside of brunch: you call it a \"recovery brunch,\" but you're pumping obnoxious techno music at full volume throughout the space.  Please play music that helps people feel like they can recover!\n\nMy main thought is that Asiento needs to find its center, so that it can fulfill the promise it has.

In particular, the tinga tostados and guacamole are fantastic. \n\nOn sundays they are doing a wonderful brunch till 4pm (!). $7 for one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had.\n\nThey also have  community oriented board game nights and art creation days. \n\nIt's a rad place that I want to stick around for a long time. It's a great addition to the neighborhood.", "author": "Jon S."}

Great choice.\n\nI had about 20 friends join me here for tapas and drinks before heading to another location and it was a great place. I emailed their info email address asking about holding a party and Debi got back to me within 12 hours. She patiently answered all of my very frank questions about layout and ambiance. She even put my favorite drink on special - gimlets! Her wonderful attitude told me that this would be a good choice, so I went for it sight unseen.\n\nThey reserved the back (though this place is open, so the \"back\" seems to be a bit of a misnomer) of the bar for us. The bartenders were super friendly, especially Tom (?, great hair anyway), and helped to make my party a success. They didn't seem to mind that we took up so much space and moved so much furniture. We sat on the comfy couches and chairs in the back. Both the cocktails and wines were great and reasonably priced. \n\nI think the other patrons (30 somethings) were a little jealous of our fun. :)\n\nOk, here's the reason I didn't give 5 stars: I reserve it for the best of the best. The drinks, if I remember correctly, were fantastic. The tapas were good, but not great. It was nice to have a neighborhood bar that serves food, but they don't have great envelope pushing food. By all means, if you're not a snob, you will like the food, no doubt. I did. They have this incredibly good cheesy thing. But, it's no Joya in Palo Alto. \n\nAlso, apparently a lot of my friends had a hard time finding parking. I didn't, but three out of about seven cars had difficulty.\n\nBut, all in all, I totally recommend this place. For ambiance, for drinks, for a snack, it really can't be beat.", "author": "Tina D."}

My disappointment was somewhat ameliorated by the awesome funk, disco, and old-school R&B jams the DJ was spinning, and by the funky, comfortable atmosphere. And who knows, maybe the drinks are amazing, and that helps make the board game selection seem slightly more amazing.

A spacious bar for the city, there was ample room to move about, and the space was very clean, modern and polished.  Parking in this neighborhood was also not a complete nightmare, which I appreciated.\n\nThe evening I went, there was some crazy closet cleanout event going on so there were numerous women walking around with extravagant, feathery hats.

I have made it my goal to bring my own boyfriend back. Tonight we achieved my goal. And what a great achievement it was. Down tempo music. Killer couch and bar seating. Not too loud. Great system if it were.\n\nThe proprietor, Debbie, made me the best martini of my life. Which is saying a lot, considering I used to vet potential 'tenders with one test: the ability to make a great martini. Before this evening I considered myself a stellar martini maker. After this evening I have been bested. A word of advice - order a slightly dirty vodka martini straight up. If not for the booze, then for the homemade olives, juice, and hint of garlic and rosemary. There are no words. \n\nCON: My only gripe is the fact that they have no straws. I had fairly invasive mouth surgery recently, and anything cold or hot against my teeth hurts like a mofo. Okay, okay I get it: they want to help the environment one straw at a time. But man, this is actually a pretty big con for me, which would be understandable if only you could be my mouth for a minute. \n\nSummation:\n\nAsiento is a great little not-to-divey bar in an area that needs more not-too-divey bars. I'm a big fan of dive bars, but as I get older it's kinda nice to hear something other than Motorhead and Pantera when I sit down to sip not-too-divey-martini.", "author": "Mel H."}

It feels warm and inviting, and I can see coming in here on a cold day to warm up and play some board games. The bartender working last night was friendly and attentive, and mixed us up some super tasty cocktails. Paula and I both had the Basil Lemonade (which was absolutely delightful) and I tried the Tannenbaum, because I'm a sucker for elderflower. Paula also had a drink with cucumber and rosemary in it, and I feel like I'll be getting that one the next time I'm in, as it was freaking delicious. \n\nWe didn't venture too much into food territory, but we did have some really tasty guacamole.

Well, I'm sure the restaurant is great, but I am no fan of this place for the following reasons. First, let me start with what I liked.\n\nWhat I liked:\n- Hip crowd, good looking people\n- Quaint size - I liked the layout\n- Really liked the lounge area and dance floor\n- Good DJs\n\nWhat I disliked, why it's only okay on my rating:\n- Expensive drinks - I hate paying $8 for a cocktail. I just do. It's like going to a restaurant and paying $2 for a soda pop. I hate it. Yeah, I am cheap. I am. What a cheapo, I am. Truth is, I'll pay $8 for an awesome drink ... but only if it is awesome. What do I mean? Let's use whiskey as an example. Some bottles are really well crafted, have lingering flavor that doesn't display bad cues ... these bottles are worth a lot. Other bottles are just so-so. There's nothing distinct about the flavor, or even a bit bad - moldy and flat. The good ones are well worth north of $100. Bad ones, no. \n- Noise - I mean I really don't get this part. It's a tiny space, so music volume should follow accordingly. Wouldn't be nice to have some dancy tunes that aren't going to be blowing your ear drums out? I really don't understand why people play music so loudly. Are they afraid that people aren't interested in talking? Are they afraid that if the music isn't so loud that you can't hear yourself talk, then music is not good?", "author": "David K."}

It was a tad too lemony, as I never put lemon in my guac but I am glad it wasn't too spicy.\n-Lemon hummus: The breads were pretty good and weren't too hard.  The hummus' ingredients blended nicely together.\n-Queso Fundido w/ Chorizo:  MY FAVE!  This was SOOOO good and reminds me of the queso I had at an amazing Mexican restaurant in Newport Beach.  Gooey, melted, delicious cheese with bits of chorizo that wasn't spicy at all.  I am just glad this place doesn't overly spice their food.

She was nice enough to notice that we ran out of chips and quickly got us some more chips.  Which was really sweet considering she wasn't working.  That's an awesome bartender.  Gets us chips and didn't charge us.  I really hate places that charge you for extra chips or breads for a dip that goes with chips or bread. \n\nTowards the end of our stay, the owner came to hang out with us too!  This is a fabulous woman that has a real zest for life.  She was so sweet and fun.  She gave us a round of beers and when I asked if she had any desserts she said no but gave us some mini brownies.  That was enough to curb my sugar craving.  Seriously, this place is great and will make you feel at home! \n\nThis place is for SURE a 5 star place but I am giving it 4 stars, FOR NOW, because they don't have a dessert menu.  That was one thing I really missed.  Progressive Cafe across the street has ice cream and shakes and that's great but I actually think that Asiento would do really well if they sold awesome shake concoctions.  Alcoholic and non-alcoholic.  I think this is the perfect place to have something like that.  When one of our friends said they were getting a shake, I got really excited and said, \"They make them here?!?!  That's AWESOME!\"  But then he said that we had to go across the street.  Since this place is more of a hang out than a restaurant, they would really benefit from having a good, unique dessert menu and would definietely put them more on the map.\n\nThis place has no where to go but up and I am glad I discovered this hidden gem.  Thanks for making such a great place available.  Can't wait to see you guys again!", "author": "Victoria C."}

Asiento popped up on Yelp, along with a few notable others, so we opted for Asiento and their tapas menu. As soon as we walked in we realized that this place is much more of a bar than a restaurant, but no matter - we were fine with grabbing drinks and finding a more sit-down spot for after. Their cocktail list is fun -- I opted for their basil lemonade and their rosemary something-or-other before we moved on and loved them both (though the Basil Lemonade was arguably more delicious). My boyfriend also seemed happy with his 'Manhootan', though that's never a particularly hard sell for him. The space is actually really awesome (kind of wish we stayed longer or lived closer): it's pretty big with a lounge-y area, the bar area, and a few tables that are perfect for groups (and for tapas). Plus they have BOARD GAMES! Also notable: super friendly staff with the kind of personalities that more bartenders should have. Upbeat, fun spot. \n\nFor people looking for a DINNER spot, I wouldn't say that this is your place (just FYI), but if you're looking for a light bite and great drinks, definitely pop in!", "author": "Shannon E."}

Great decor that makes for a relaxed environment. Not too loud so that you can hold a conversation with a group of friends.

They atmosphere is very cool and laid back, there is plenty of room (even on a Saturday night it didn't feel too crowded) and tables for those that just want to sit down and chill.  There's a great selection of drinks and cocktails and it was all decently priced.  They also serve tapas, although I didn't have a chance to try any.  The music was good, as was the service.  All in all, a great place to stop in and have a drink if you're out and about in the Mission.", "author": "Dana G."}

We were looking for a place where some of us could eat, some of us could drink, and all of us could  talk and hear each other (gosh I sound old!). After going to Trick dog for a rowdy three minutes, we found Asiento around the corner. The bartender was cute, there was live music playing at the perfect volume, there are board games you can use, and lots of clusters of friend groups like our own just having a great time. I had the tinga de pollo tostadas which were  yum and only $8. Friends had the beet salad, albondigas, and patatas bravas. We all had cocktails which were unique and yummy. My only ish is that they dont have straws. I know it's SF and we all should be green conscious, but sometimes a girl likes a straw in her drink. Solution? The bartender handed me a piece of red licorice to use as a makeshift straw. haha. creative, but not the same, and totally changed the taste of my beverage. I would totally go back, straws or no straws!", "author": "Kassaundra G."}

Seems I make it a point to get over there more often in the summer since my neighborhood can be so foggy.  The atmosphere is fun and lighthearted and the drinks are always good.  The last time I was there the wife had a Lemon-drop and said it was very, very good!  I had a Mojito, which was as good as they get!  I think what I like most is hanging there after work after a long day for a quick drink and some light food.  The staff is always friendly and the people eclectic.", "author": "Todd W."}

The ambiance is laid back and lovely (although the music is a bit loud, but I'm old and cranky like that).  The wines are great and the burger is the best thing I have ever tasted, hands down.  What really makes us want to keep coming back though is the staff.  The bartenders are super sweet and nice.  It's just a great neighborhood bar with really good people.  And that's sadly hard to find these days.  Plus it's got trivia on Monday nights.  A wine bar with tapas and trivia and nice people.  Love it.", "author": "Molly F."}

The atmosphere here is lively and the ladies running the bar are very cool and super friendly. Everyone here seems to know each other, so it can be a little intimidating being here alone waiting for a friend to arrive.

Parking is atrocious; make sure you take public transport.", "author": "Michelle L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-11-04", "description": "I don't typically post on yelp but I thought this was pretty terrible. A friend opened a tab at the bar and when I went to transfer the tab to my card, the waitress realized that she had accidentally given my friend's card to a different patron (I.e. closed the wrong tab).  The owner of the bar was actually there.  They apologized but by the time we closed our (new) tab, there was no discount applied to the bill, which was extremely surprising. It seems like if you're going to inconvenience your patron so much as to have them cancel their credit card (and wait a week for a new one), then the least you could do is take a drink or two off the tab. This was hugely disappointing and I don't plan on going back here any time soon.", "author": "Soraya A."}

Debi was so considerate when I asked to rent out the place, she said I could book the bar at no additional cost and we just started right there to talk about what kind of party I wanted to host.   At no time did she make me feel that what I wanted or how I wanted would be in imposition to her bar and they were more than happy to accommodate.  The food she served was awesome, she hired an extra bar person to ensure good flow of drinks to person and make it easy for me to play my music by having Ipod station etc all ready to rock.  Her staff were super pleasant, the atmosphere was chill and we all had an awesome time dancing till the wee hours.  She even put up my favorite drink on the bar list!  It's not only a great neighborhood bar but many of friends felt like they just discovered a little treasure.  If you are seeking a warm place to have a few drinks and play games or chat, go here.
