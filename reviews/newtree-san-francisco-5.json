However, I moved here last year and since this place is so close to work and offers a variety of vegan options, I gave NewTree another shot and eat here almost every day I go to the office.  The reality here is:\n\nTHEY \nMAKE\nDELICIOUS\nVEGAN\nQUINOA\nSALAD\n\nNo lie, this is my favorite salad in SF. And they've made the vegan quinoa salad larger than in the past...and it's reasonably priced. HOORAY.\n\nOh and before I forget, here's my review from their California street location (my client was nearby so I ate at this location a lot during that project!):\n\nI've stopped by NewTree for lunch a few times now and really like it. While slightly overpriced, I really like their vegan quinoa salad. You can choose a dressing for the salad (there are two vegan options), but I have found that the quinoa salad is good enough on it's own and I don't use dressing when I eat it--the quinoa is flavored with a cashew and arugula cream. Sometimes NewTree has samples of its food items at the checkout register. Last time I was there I was able to try their vegan burger, which I thought was quite good, but I didn't get it during that visit because I was set on salad that day. I will definitely get the burger next time (if you get it, have them warm it up for you). Overall, this is a cute place with good vegan lunch options. I'll be back.", "author": "Christina M."}

The staff is friendly and helpful and quick to answer questions. Also the decor is really cool - the cafe is super cute and it's easy to navigate. \n\nMy first visit I had a cafe au lait, it was hot, fast and fresh. But the coffee really just didn't taste very good. I was disappointed, BUT I figured it's not their fault I didn't like the taste good to ME.\n\nMy second visit I wanted a pastry - so I ordered an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. The cashier looked at the cookie closely and said out loud \"there's no chocolate chips in here.\" He then turns the cookie over searching for a chocolate chip and says \"oh -there's the chocolate.\" That's a bit weird, but fresh baked goods typically don't all look the same. I then asked for a plain chocolate chip cookie to take home. I was rung up and the two cookies came to almost $7.00!!! I put the chocolate chip cookie back and just paid for the oatmeal chocolate chip. \n\nI leave and take a bit out of my cookie, and go to look for the chocolate - I find the One chocolate chip in the entire cookie...and it's a raisin. No big deal - but for $3.30 I'm taking it back and getting the cookie I ordered. I took the cookie back, and was helped immediately. The other cashier looks at the cookie with me, breaks it apart and declares \"all of these are oatmeal raisin.\" The original cashier then realized the cookies are labeled wrong and finds the oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. And we exchange cookies and I leave on my way. \n\nUnfortunately - the cookie was drier than saw dust and tasted like dry oatmeal. The cookie felt soft in my hand, but the mouthfeel was closer to sand than cookie. I promptly disposed of my $3.30 cookie and was immediately upset that I paid that much for a cookie that really shouldn't be referred to as a pastry as much as a clump of sawdust and flavorless chocolate. \n\nBut as I said - the shining start is the awesome customer service - maybe I'm  just not ordering the right things, but it's not likely I'll return to find out if that's the case.", "author": "Christina B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-23", "description": "Vegan, gluten-free, organic, artisanal, dairy-free, whole-wheat, kale, quinoa, superfood. Well, those would be the key buzzwords you'd look for in a cafe if you live a super health-conscious lifestyle. NewTree certainly looks trendy enough.The space is small, but feels pretty spacious with high ceilings and a couple of couches in the corner. The tall, over-arching bamboo-stick-looking-things are interesting to look at, but I couldn't help but wonder who has the unfortunate job of cleaning them. \nI enjoy vegetables, but I am not one to pay $10 for a salad or a meatless sandwich, so I had decided this cafe probably wasn't for me. I prefer to make my own salads.\n\nThen I noticed that NewTree is also a chocolate shop. There were about a dozen different flavors of very neatly arranged chocolate bars on a large set of shelves. Besides chocolate, they also sell Belgian waffles, spreads, and other snack things. \nI grabbed a chocolate bar off the shelf and turned it over to look at the Nutrition Facts. My eyebrows raised when I noticed that most of these bars have about 9 grams of dietary fiber per serving, and each bar is 2 servings, so that's 18 grams of fiber per chocolate bar! Each bar has a little less than 400 calories. That's pretty damn good compared to a Fiber One Bar, but at about $7 per bar, they will cost you a pretty penny. \n\nI was getting ready for a trip to the motherland and I wasn't sure what gifts to bring the relatives from the good 'ol U.S. of A. But I knew my grandpa loved chocolate and he needed fiber. So I chose a whole bunch of flavors, some typical - milk chocolate, almonds, dark chocolate, some not so typical - Belgian biscuit, ginger, quinoa flax. They also provide samples in little glass containers with tongs. They tasted sweet, rich, and creamy, with hardly a hint of fibrous texture. I spent so much money that they told me I 'earned' a free mini bar, so I chose the milk chocolate. The lady helping me was super sweet and friendly.\n\nAfter that initial purchase, I decided to give NewTree a real try. Other than salads and vegetarian sandwiches, they do have a couple of meat options, as well as baked goods. I decided to try a quiche. I wanted the Sweet Potato & Bacon, but they were out, so I settled on the Tomato & Goat Cheese Quiche. The crust was okay. The filling was a little too tart for me. Since goat cheese and tomato are both tart, it could have used a more savory component. I was mainly disappointed that it wasn't heated up. I wasn't expecting to receive a cold quiche, nor did the cashier ask if I would like it warmed up. My $6 quiche didn't fill me up either. \n\nI doubt I'd return for a meal, but maybe... just maybe I might stop by for pastry and a hot chocolate. I only tried one thing from the menu, and I'd give the quiche about a 5/10, but the chocolate bars are more like an 8/10. They also sell gift sets and things of that nature, so at least NewTree is a convenient place to pick up a last minute gift.", "author": "Joy W."}

I really enjoyed the wrap they used (whole-wheat tortilla) but the flavors of the tofu wrap were just okay to me. It didn't really stand out. I also got a matcha latte which did not have a lot of matcha flavor. I opted for the almond milk pairing and it tasted more like straight almond milk than a matcha latte. \n\nThis place has a lot of potential if it could work on some of their flavor profiles and probably lower the prices just a bit.

With the big, warm cup of delicious vegan potato/coconut soup (with mushroom??), the whole meal filled me up to that perfect level of being satisfied but not falling asleep over my keyboard from post-lunch food coma. And the sandwich, with its warm, melty, gooey cheese felt surprisingly heavy, so I was happy to only have half. I was pleased to see them throw the sandwich fresh onto the panini press after I arrived, so that it would be warm and toasty by the time I got it into my mouth.

The really nice gal behind the counter suggested I taste it before going head first into an entire cup, being that some people find it too spicy (wusses!) Amigos, it's pure manna from heaven!

Oh, it's a pretty enough place, very green in every way that green can be, but what is it really? A chocolate shop? A cafe? A gift shop? Oh, it's all three. Hmmm. I've actually popped in here a couple of times before, but like a confused hamster in a Habitrail ball, I rolled in, I looked, and then I rolled out again. In fact, they serve food fit for a hamster like their $8.75 Belgian Salad, which is stacked one on top of each other in their mini-fridge. I came in to try one, and it was certainly decent enough with Romaine lettuce and - surprise! - shredded Brussels sprouts and then topped with radishes, dried apricots, almonds, feta cheese bits and mint (see photo).\n\nSo here's the thing. No one told me to pick up a little container of the pomegranate chocolate or blueberry lavender vinaigrettes stacked against the side window (see photo). That's probably because the staff was quite indifferent to my experience there. I don't think I received any eye contact, so I just took my bowl and sat at one of their high-top cafe tables to eat my Belgian salad. I was thinking how green everything looked, green and clean like a spa that sells mulch. I was fantasizing how much more interesting the place would have been in a goth-punk motif with a cashier that looked like Lisbeth Salander. But no chance. This is the kind of place that delights skinny women with money.\n\nCan you tell I didn't love it? Yeah, I didn't. The salad seemed overpriced for lunchtime grazing especially since I realized from reading the label on the bowl that I was supposed to get an organic roll as well as the vinaigrette. Good thing I don't need the carbs, but you would have thought someone there could have told me that or at least cared enough to see if I was having a nice dining experience at my lonely stool in the middle of the store. I guess that's what made me feel like a hamster in a Habitrail ball. I just wanted to roll away again. Meanwhile, those skinny women were sampling the chocolates on the shelves dropping the tongs on the floor and putting them back on the shelf.

The salad was overpriced and looked relatively small for the $11.50 price tag ($13.55 with tax and tip) but the ingredients appeared to be high quality. \n\nUnfortunately I bit into a large pebble which hurt and could have seriously damaged my tooth if I'd bitten down harder.  I went to return the salad and asked for my money back because finding rocks in ones food is completely unacceptable. If they'd taken it back with excellent customer service I would have given 4-5 stars but they gave me an incredibly hard time. First, the woman at the counter thought I was trying to get a free meal and asked to have the pebble to show the owner (gross). She let me know she could offer me something else instead rather than refunding me. I showed her the pebble and said that I really just wanted a refund. She accused me of trying to get my money back after eating the \"whole\" salad, harping on how it was almost gone and asking when I actually found the pebble (obviously towards the end of the salad!). This implied that she thought I may have found a massive pebble in my salad and continued eating so I could get a free lunch or was making it up. \n\nThe worst part is that I was actually finding little pebbles in the salad while eating and ignoring them because they just didn't wash their grains well enough.

Quaint, refreshing, and filled with delicious treats, this place has a lot of potential if it wasn't for their meh service..\n\nAt around 2pm, this place was BUMPIN. Line out the door, tables filled. Of course my friend and I didn't know what we wanted so we kindly stepped aside while we made up our minds. Giggling while trying to decide we were treated very dismissively by the cashier who seemed bothered that 1) we couldn't decide what to get and 2) were having a good time together. C'mon lady! It's 2pm on a Thursday! Lighten up!\n\nOnce we did finally decide, we received our drinks and soup very quickly and decided to sit outside since we didn't feel very welcomed inside.. The cauliflower soup was actually delicious, as was the brownie, and the small sample of almond hot chocolate I tried. Prices are a little steeper than I'd like to pay for items so simple, but I must say everything was clearly high quality and more than just your average soup or hot chocolate.\n\nIf service wasn't so snooty and serious, this could definitely become a regular lunch and or hot chocolate spot for me, but considering how judgmental they were of something as simple as enjoying a Thursday afternoon with an old friend, not sure if I'll be back..", "author": "Rachel L."}

I asked her about the types of muffins and she says it like I should know it already. She says it so quickly that I was still confused. Right after she gave me a quick glance that I was hesitant, he walks away. Is that how you treat customers? I waited for the barista to help finishing making coffee for another customer, so he can help me. \n\nThe other time I came was when I got my cookie.

The store appears to specialize in \"health\" forward, Belgian, organic chocolate and snacks. They offer a variety of healthy salads for $5 and several pre-made sandwiches for $5-8.\n\nI ordered the Quinoa burger ($7.95), which they grilled to order. I was also a victim of the impulse basket full of specialty chocolates located at the cash register and decided on the dark chocolate with Belgian cookie and flax seed. Yes, the healthfulness of the flax seed certainly made this treat a little bit less of a splurge. At a price of $2.5 for an oz of chocolate, that was another type of splurge, but my body is worth it!\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the Quinoa burger, it had great texture and the wait time to have it grilled, 4 minutes, was just enough time for me to sample several additional flavors of their chocolate. Favorites included the dark chocolate with thyme and the ginger dark chocolate. Four stars instead of five as I think the chocolate is a bit over priced.

Their chocolate is mostly flavored chocolate bars, and are certified organic and fair trade. They definitely really push the organic/fair trade vibe in this cafe. Everything is made of recycled/compostable/environmentally-friendly material. There's some cool bamboo awning decorating the walls/ceiling and even the ground is made of some kind of pebble mixture. \n\nFor the retail portion, hey have some pretty unique flavors, like thyme, cinnamon, ginger, and lavender chocolate bars. They also sell baking chips and other baked goods/sweets. They also sell some environmentally friendly products like reusable utensils, solar panel chargers for your ipod, plants, etc.\n\nI think they're still working on their menu but i had a green pea pesto on acme bread that was delicious! The qunioa was also decent, but the lavender chocolate pudding was sublime! I have to stay away from that. The cappucino I had was not bad, not as strong as I would have liked, but the barista said they're still working on their menu and will probably have some unique drinks coming to the menu soon.\n\nHours are currently Mon - Friday 7 AM - 6 PM.

I've held off on writing a review for almost a year since it was a little hit-or-miss in their earlier days and I liked them enough to give them a chance. And now, after all this time, going at least 2 or 3 times a week, I am happy to say it's now always a very pleasant experience! \n\nMy co-workers and I have nicknamed this place \"The Spa\" and that about sums it up. The decor is cute, clean, lots of plants, and bamboo surfaces, and green. I am a sucker for the nature documentaries they're always showing on their TV too. I always get the soup + salad (usually quinoa flax) combo and it fills me right up. Their soups change everyday - I love when they have the sweet potato coconut or split pea. Some of the other soups (asparagus) are not quite as good, but I enjoy the variety. When I'm feeling particularly decadent, I'll get their dirty chai latte with almond milk which is some of the best I've ever had. Not too sweet, lots of spice, nicely thick and foamy on top. Yum!!! They have a ton of pastries too (lots of vegan and gf options) and I am partial to their almond florentines. Don't forget the wall of chocolate samples!! I never forget to snag a few on my way out - my favorites are the Thyme and Cinnamon flavors. \n\nThe people are friendly and there's minimal lines or waiting.

The place has a nice environment though the chairs are a bit to hip for me and not at all comfortable. The chocolate is ridiculous in price. It's good... But not that good! Anyway, it's worth checking out. I didn't have one, but the sandwiches looked really good.", "author": "Robert H."}

This is a good take-and-go lunch place (premade salads, quiche, etc.) and the chocolate is delish.  When I came here for lunch I had a quiche, which made for a nice and light lunch.  I notice that they have appealing premade salads that have quinoa in them, but I haven't made it there in time to get more before they sell out.  I've had samples of their chocolate, which have been heavenly.  The desserts are tempting.  The service is friendly.  Will go back for a salad soon.", "author": "Jacqueline C."}

Very healthy and tasty, no matter what their soup of the day is. I mean I, myself, have never been a fan of carrots, so I wasn't sure I'd like their carrot soup, but after trying it, I could say that I'm a fan. They are a little pricey, but that's because all their stuff's organic and good for your body, so I'd say it's worth the price. :)", "author": "Trisha D."}

They have a wonderful selection of salads and sandwiches that are not just healthful---they taste great and you can tell there was some thought/taste testing behind them.\nWhole filberts in the salad with pomegranate seeds, kale etc---their granola bars to die for....\"African Chicken salad sandwich\"--superb--get it heated up--they get the ciabatta softened up---\nworth a visit or two or three for certain---their chocolates are first rate as well!!", "author": "John S."}

I love everything about the products, flavors, brand, website, and the people I interacted with. I haven't been to the store in person yet, but based on how they handled business with me on the other side of the country, I would expect great things in person! \n\nMy workshop used the lavender chocolate and the cinnamon chocolate which were appropriately paired with soothing and calming parts of the class. The students all chose the NewTree chocolate over the other types I had in class. There was a healthy comparison and high praise for NewTree.\n\nTheir well-designed website, flavor options, and health information first caught my eye when researching different companies. Once I learned more, I came away with respect for their sustainability efforts, adoration for their branding and style, and a newfound addiction to their delicious and thoughtful chocolate. \n\nI offer my highest recommendation to the company and Sophie, who offered me a fantastic first impression of NewTree. \n\nAs I closed my workshop: \"Namaste and savor your day!\"", "author": "Julie B."}

I decided to pop in for lunch one day a few weeks ago and haven't been able to stop. It's now my favorite place to pick up a quick salad or sandwich when I'm rushing back to work. \n\nThe salad with quinoa, arugula, and baby tomatoes is delicious. Last week when they were out of this, I ordered the soup of the day, carrot with ginger and other spices. It was also amazing, as expected. Also love to have another place that offers vegetable based soups as opposed to the cream and lard ones mass-produced at the Soup Company. I love that all of their ingredients are organic and locally sourced; you taste and feel this freshness in all of their offerings. They also sell baked goods (brownies, zucchini bread) and vegan hot chocolate (made with almond milk) and dark chocolate mousse. NewTree lets you indulge without the guilt that comes from consuming fatty, processed ingredients.", "author": "Melissa D."}

REALLY pleasantly surprised.\n\nFirst of all, they offer almond milk. As a person who is boy soy allergic and lactose intolerant, this is hugely appreciated. The Dirty Chai Latte is exactly what I need! I eventually want to try the Hot Chocolate, too.\n\nSecond, I'm obsessed with their Spinach Hummus roll. I've had it both times I've gone and I crave it. It is curried and has cranberries in it...yummy tastes and it's pretty big- and at $6 it's a really good lunch.\n\nHaven't tried any of their other sandwiches, but I did have a soup that i was so/so on. Their pastries look really good, too.\n\nServers are perfectly nice, but occasionally aloof? Or maybe just soft spoken and me as a loudmouth think it's aloof. Anyway, they're very very nice and welcoming, regardless.", "author": "Ashley C."}

The second time I visited here, I asked for one of their iced coffees.  They said they were out of their iced coffee but offered me an iced Americano.  Not usually an Americano person, I sort of just went with it and didn't know what to expect.  I was informed after 5 minutes that it was going to be awhile since one of their espresso machines had just broken down.  After another 5 minutes with no coffee, the cashier offered me two of their biscotti out on display as a thank you for waiting.  I was really taken by surprise with the gesture, and can always be appreciative of when businesses are sensitive to their customers.  Anyway, I wasn't going to write a review for them the first time, but having had such a positive experience there again, I wanted to put out there that NewTree's customer service was commendable.", "author": "Lisa I."}
