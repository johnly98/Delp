It's a particular shame, because this place is right around the corner and could easily be our local go to spot.\n\nWhen you first walk in, the restaurant smells like bleach or cleaning product. I guess it's good to know they clean the place, but the smell is overwhelming and a real turn off.\n\nWe were given a table for four in the corner, and the server - who is very friendly but not particularly intuitive to guests needs - started rattling off the specials before my mother could even put down her bag. By the time she was settled into her seat, he was done listing the specials and asked if we needed some time. It all felt overwhelming and we couldn't tell if he was just over eager or in a rush.\n\nUnfortunately, it just got worse from there. The food was absolutely atrocious, there's simply no other word for it. I had the Moules Marini\u00e8res and I think I ate 5 mussels before I set the dish aside. You know the funky flavor that mussels have when they're off? Every single mussel tasted like that. As did the sauce they were cooked in. I noticed it on the first one, but sometimes that happens and you get one that's a little funky. Literally every single one tasted disgusting. I'm rarely so harsh in reviews, but there is simply no other word for it. Thankfully, the fries that I ordered on the side where delicious so that was my meal. When the waiter cleared my plate, it was clear that I had barely touch the mussels, but he didn't seem to notice, or didn't think to ask.\n\nMy mother ordered the Bouillabaise. It was really fishy, because they used salmon instead of a traditional white fish. It was edible, but definitely not good. Maybe a C-. My husband ordered the duck breast. It was cooked properly, but came with a sticky, sickly sweet sauce that covered the entire plate and made the whole dish taste almost like dessert. There was absolutely no finesse to the dish, it looked and tasted like an amateur chef from the 80s was making it. Again, edible but not at all good. A C would be generous. My mother-in-law had the beef cheeks. The flavor was bland, but at least not bad like the other 3, but the meat was so dry it made me sad to see a beautiful protein cooked in that way. She thought they were OK, because she's never had them before, but I really really wanted to go back and cook them all over again and do that beautiful piece of meat some justice. \n\nThe three of them also ordered starters, he soup which was very bland and a citrus salad which was good but overdressed. \n\nThe salt in the wound, is that we walked out spending $250. My husband and I are foodies, our moms are not, and all four of us thought the food was pretty awful. There's no way we would have gone back even if we had spent half that much, but spending $250 on a dinner that required me to go brush my teeth immediately afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth was really awful.\n\nI hate to bash local restaurants, because I really want to see them thrive, but I recommend you stay far, far away from this place. It really is quite awful.", "author": "Rebecca W."}

The duck breast another diner was eating looked real good too.

Made a reservation on yelp to ensure we had a table.  Easy peasy.  Parking is terrible in the area so it would be best to find alternative ways to get there.  \n\nAs an appetizer, we started off with the baked brie which was served with tomatoes, roasted garlic, and bread.  A little heavy as a starter but I'm such a sucker for brie.  Delicious flavors though and I was smitten anyway.  \n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the risotto aux coquilles St. Jacques.  Basically, this was perfectly cooked risotto with lobster broth and scallops.  Delicious if you're interested in a heavier seafood dish.  Our other entree was one of the specials on the board, tournedos rossini.  Filet mignon, foie gras, and potato gratin.  My goodness...this is a must order if you come here and they happen to offer it.  Flavortown was definitely all over this plate of goodness.\n\nWe asked our server for wine recommendations and we went with a French malbec and a French chardonnay.  Perfect pairings with our meals.  \n\nIf I had to mention one negative, it would be the dessert we ordered, basically a chocolate lava cake.  The flavor was quite mild for a lava cake which should be rich with chocolate flavors.  The ice cream and what appeared to be some sort of praline disc was amazing though.  \n\nServer was on point as he was thorough and extremely helpful.

Except for the fish, the meats were disappointing and weirdly flavorless. The sauce, which I was previously a massive fan of (Bistro Central Parc is where I became a sauce convert) was a watered down version of what it once was. Where it once complemented the meat, it was now it's sole source of flavor. Luckily, we were sharing mains, and we all enjoyed the fish. But 1/3 isn't good math for us. We ate in sad silence, later acknowledging that this was probably the last time we'd come here.\n\nThe service was great. It's still a great location for a lovely day strolling through the Panhandle.

I felt like I was on one of those overbooked United flights where they were about to ask for volunteers to get off the plane. The hostess was completely overwhelmed by it all, and it was 30 minutes before we were seated. They had packed in the tables so tightly that the waitstaff couldn't make it to our table properly, and so the diner beside us had to sit at a right angle for the waitstaff (and other guests) to get past. It was another 20 minutes for them to take our order. And while the appetizers didn't take too long, it was 90 minutes into dinner before our mains finally appeared.\n\nThe food wasn't bad, but it'd have to have been extraordinary to make up for the restaurant's greed in completely booking themselves out like this -- and being shortstaffed with only one hostess and two waiters for Valentine's Day. Snails were ok, soup was bland; the mains of the lamb and the salmon pie definitely redeemed things but who knows?

Make it the place look great.  Make it hipster.  Make people pay the hipster pricing.  All it's missing is the 2 word adjective-noun name.  That's the formula--then as long as the food ain't utter crap, money will be made!\n\nWell, first of, for those who have been to France, you would know there is no such thing as a French meal, be it breakfast, lunch, or dinner, without bread served first.  Period.  Never.  (Well, unless we're talking eating at McDonald's.)  So guess what?--they never gave us table bread.  Maybe that sounds silly to us Americans, but I'm pretty sure that's a crazy huge deal if committed in France.\n\nAlright.... so.... that's kinda how it went...\n\n1. Coffee $4.50:  It's bitter without body.  I guess it would have been okay, but for four and a half bucks?--hell no.  3/10\n\n2. Baked Brie $16 \"roasted garlic, concasse of tomatoes\":  I was absolutely stunned when I saw this in front of us.  Like, where's the cheese!?!?  Most of us have had baked brie before right?--big round of cheese oozing from the white outer crust, often breaded?  Well, the cheese was totally an after thought.  They just basically put a quarter of a round of brie, possibly microwaved, cause the crust was all broken and dry--just plopped there.  Got some tomatoes and bread, which both were good.  But the cheese... wow... amazingly amateur.  2/10\n\n3. Soupe a l'Oignon $14 \"traditional French onion soup\":  You know, like most of us I've had dozens of these over the years.  Many from straight-up American restaurants, some from fancy schmancy French places too, and of all of them this might be the worst I've ever had.  The onions were so pulverized they were just a pile of mush on the bottom.  The bread was completely mushed too.  The soup was pretty flavorless.  Crap.  2/10\n\n4. Moules Marinieres $20 \"white wine, shallots, parsley and cream\":  Alright, things were looking better now.  The mussels, though pretty small, were very juicy and tender.  The sauce/soup was pretty good too.  Creamy and tasty.  The bread they served it with though just ruined it.  Like cheapo stale bread a day old from the supermarket.  Again, if you've been to France, you know how seriously they take their bread.  This ain't French bread.  Trust me.  5/10\n\n5. Confit de Canard $25 \"lentils and lardon\":  I think this is their super specialty.  I'd have to admit, the duck itself is probably one of the best duck confits I've had.  The texture is perfect without the meat completely falling apart.  Skin was crispy and very savory.  Great.  The lentil thing I didn't like though.  I do not know if it's traditional or what, but it tasted a lot like the Chinese green bean soup my mom used to make, without the sugar.  Just ain't great.  But if it weren't for that, would have been pretty dang good.  8/10\n\n6. Profiteroles $9:  Straight up--they took bought some puffs from the store, gave them to some kids to stuff with ice cream and top with chocolate and nuts.  I'd guess 7 year olds.  Tastes fine, but just a total mess.  Check out my pics.  3/10\n\nIf you wanna blow a ton of money, and at the same time gain a few thousand calories of nice waistline.... have at it.\n\n2/5\n\n#french #sanfrancisco", "author": "Dean C."}

But it changed ownership a couple of years ago and has lost a good deal of its appeal. First of all, no one wants to smell cleaning fluid throughout their dining experience.  It's gross to begin with, messes with your sense of smell/taste, and ruins everything.  And that is the first impression.  It hits you as you walk in and never leaves until you walk out.  Yuck.  Second, a big part of the experience is the service.  I would say it is perfunctory at best, and lacks the warmth and charm it had under the former owners.  Lastly, the food is ok/fine, but not finely done as it used to be; it just seems like the kitchen staff are tired of putting out the same food night after night -- like there is no heart in the preparation anymore.

More visually appealing than the actual taste. The salad had a weird dressing on it and the beef also had a similar dressing, with a sour tinge. The salad and beef definitely taste better separately. Just personally wasn't one of my favorites. \n\n- Curry mussels: 3/5 couldn't really taste the curry flavor and the broth was too creamy and weighed down the flavor of the mussels. It may be just personal taste, but I enjoy my mussels to be a little lighter tasting. \n\n- French fries: can't even give this thing a score. They were just French fries. The guy really sold us on it, saying we should dip the fries into the mussel broth for an amazing experience but it was honestly just a \"meh\" combination. Didn't add much to the fries and the mussel broth couldn't sufficiently cling onto the fries. Would pass on this for sure. Totally overpriced at $7/serving \n\n- Rossini: filet mignon, foie gras, potato. 4.5/5 Very good but very rich. So rich that I wasn't sure if we could finish it. All together, a good flavor combination. \n\n- Beef cheek: 5/5 favorite dish. The beef cheek is fork tender and delicious with the underlying beet pur\u00e9e. Little stumps of potatoes that cake with it also very tasty. The cheek, the mushrooms, and the beet sauce really work well together, to create a tasty complete bite. \n\n- service: 1 person seating people and 1 waiter. Not enough man power and therefore, things were missed. For example, water not refilled, the fries not delivered until we asked for them. Took a while to get the check. Etc. But overall, acceptable and no significant problems since the staff was nice when they did come by. \n\nOverall, this restaurant had French food with a little more flavor than usual (everything was a bit more sour than usual-- but not necessarily in a bad way).

Nothing like having mediocre food be served to your table while your child sits hungry. I had to chase someone down to get my bill. Then I waved and waved and finally had to walk up to the counter and pay.  This is the first time I've never left a tip. You would do well to eat anywhere else.", "author": "Brian D."}

The worst experience I have had at a restaurant. They overbooked and did not have enough tables! so they put a bunch of tables outside on the concrete. We sat inside a dirty, old, ragged tent. It was disgusting. Many couples who made reservations at this restaurant walked out and left. Really sad to see so many people looking forward to a simple VDay dinner have their night upset. \n\nI made a yelp account just to write this review. if you are thinking about coming here please think again. This restaurant's greed will get the best of you-- they do not care about your experience and will not hesitate to serve you food out in the cold.", "author": "Jesse C."}

I had a tough time deciding among all the French restos in NoPa and Hayes Valley, especially as they have similar menus. I knew we chose the right place when I called to make reservations and the hostess (or manager? Seems like she is very hands-on with the business) offered seating \"on the terrasse\".\n\nThe pictures alone should win you over. The presentation was just as gorgeous in real life. Every dish that passed by our table caught my eye. Though the specials sounded fresh and well-thought out, i had to have the baked brie, braised beef cheeks with red beet sauce, scallop risotto with a lobster bisque base, and creme brulee. It may look like smaller than the American average, but the richness of each dish will satisfy you. I would have been uncomfortably full if we had gotten any more than that, between the two of us. \n\nThe dishes came out in good time; our server was efficient and attentive, without  interrupting our conversation. The bistro feels intimate and unpretentious - but is rather loud at dinnertime on a Saturday inside, so I'm glad we were outside (with heaters, if Karl worries you). I unfortunately could not allow myself to eat here too frequently, but the prices are fair by being comparable to other French restaurants. I would love to go back for special dinners in the future.\n\nPS: i was able to make a reservation the day of. Even if it is only a couple of hours ahead, make the call.

I was last to arrive, but we weren't given menus until we had to ask =/ We started off with a bottle of Riesling to share and dove into our appetizers. Everything came out at once so our table was packed! I enjoyed the entrees a lot more than the appetizers.\n\nAppetizers:\n- (2) French onion soup: One of my more favored appetizers. I liked the cheese and soup with plentiful onions - the soup wasn't too salty as most spots make, but this one had a good savory level.\n- (2) American Kobe-style Beef Tartare: The tartare was a little bit too relish-y tasting for me, but my friends enjoyed it a lot. The ones I had in Paris were never this masked in pickled flavor, so they made it a little too overpowering.\n- (2) escargots: Wayyyy too salty, which completely masked the taste of the snails itself :(\n- Classic Moules Marinieres (mussels): mussels were a little on the fishy/unfresh side, but my friends & I enjoyed the sauce it came with to dip our super hard complimentary breads.\n- (2) Baked Brie: My favorite of this dish was the brie and the roasted garlic - this ranks second on my more favored appetizers. The way we got to pull out each clove from the garlic was satisfying and unique too. The bread also went well with the cheese.\n\nEntrees:\n- Steak Frites: The meat and sauce was cooked perfectly with the potato layers underneath. I enjoyed this dish and would order again.\n- Risotto aux Coquilles St. Jacques (risotto with lobster sauce & scallops): I was also a fan of this scallop dish, however the risotto was a little on the harder/uncooked side. Flavor of the lobster in the risotto alone would make me order this dish again though.\n- Carre d'Agneau (lamb): I am not a lamb fan, but my friends really liked it. I tried a small bite and it was indeed a lot less gamey-flavored than most lamb people tell me to try. They super enjoyed it.\n- (2) Pomme Frites (+ truffle oil for $2): We originally ordered 1 of these, but the truffle oil on them were so delicious, we ordered a second one because 1 was not enough to share among 7 ladies.\n\nDesserts:\n- Creme Brulee: Not too sweet, but prefer a thinner layer of sugar on top. Would order again though, because I love creme brulee and I have yet to encounter a one I hate.\n- Ice cream puffs: The combination of the thin puff, ice cream and dark chocolate really worked for me - I liked it and would order again.\n- strawberry puree: This was one of least favorite due to the sour strawberries. It was warm with ice cream on top, if the strawberries were sweeter, I think we would have liked a lot more.\n- lemon tart (daily special): the thickness of the lemon part was so delicious - i really enjoyed the texture and piece of tart at the bottom. I would order this again if it was on the menu.\n\nOverall, decent restaurant, but not completely impressed with the food. The service picked up after they forgot to provide us menus. The birthday girl got a special glass of bubbly with surprise singing with the restaurant lights turned off by the workers just for her! Good, but nothing outstanding for me to want to return.", "author": "Amanda C."}

Waiters can range from super bougie douche to a kind of relaxed bougie douche (such a big difference right?) I wouldn't expect anything less from a French restaurant, but a sense of bougie douche-ness altogether.\n\nRegardless of the waiter, the food is what I'm really here for:\n\n(1) Escargot - drowned in a heavy amount of butter and parsley (which is prob the only way I'd eat snails = drowned in butter) were delicious little suckers.\n\n(2) Mussels (Moules Marinieres) - light, succulent, and tasty. Definitely one of my favorites here.\n\n(3) Ratatouille - side dish we got as an appetizer was definitely my least favorite. It was just a little too soggy and mushy for my texture palate. \n\n(4) Kobe Beef Tartare - was pure Amazing! So much I didn't even get a picture! The first thing to come out for a group of hangry beings, therefore devoured without mercy. \n\n(5) Scallop Risotto (Risotto Aux Coquilles St Jacques) - super rich but creamy heaven.

It meant waiting for her to explain the menu and take orders, waiting for the wine menu and ordering off of it and receiving what one had ordered. Did someone else call out? Who knows. The waitress appeared run off her feet and apologetic to the point that each time she appeared before us she was apologizing, which sours after a bit.\nWe ordered a mixed green salad, some scrambled eggs that was supposed to come with fries but instead came with country potatoes, a side of ham, and a glass of white wine. Over $40. The ham was processed cold cut variety, $7. I asked for and was kindly given some good bread, but no butter. No dijon mustard or mayonnaise for the potatoes.

This is definitely a \"destination\" restaurant, but well worth the special trip. \n\nInside you feel like you are in an authentic Parisian bistro.  Our waiter, Sebastian, was as French as they come - accent and all.  The wine list features a wide selection of French wines, from all areas, even those that are a bit esoteric. \n\nI've eaten here several times, even on weekends and never needed a reservation.  But if you have more than 4 people I'd recommend calling ahead because it may require them to shift some tables around.  (It's a small spot.)\n\nMy go to dish is the Confit de Canard.  It's a large helping of duck that's been deep fried with the skin on.  Juicy as could be.  They serve it on a bed of confit, which is sitting on a bed of lentils.  Very filling and delicious.\n\nParking is EASY.  This is a lightly trafficked residential neighborhood.  I've always been able to find a space within 1 block. \n\nNoise level is low.

Not so coincidentally, visited Bistro Central Parc over the weekend for a 5-star French meal worth Yelping about. \n\nReservations are encouraged, but not required. Our group of 6 called ahead. Lucky for us, a true Frenchman was in the group and able to parlez his way into an 8:30 pm seating. Who needs OpenTable when you've got someone who speaks the owner's native tongue? When in doubt, there's generally seating at the bar as well.\n\nWe were given a warm \"bonsoir\" upon arrival and it was quite amusing to watch our friend schmooze with the owner en Fracais, making decisions about wine and appetizers to get started. We had a lovely Beaujolais as well as a bottle of vino that I swear smelled like asparagus in a bottle. \n\nTo start, go with the baked Brie and garlic. Everyone at the table must eat a little bit, 'cause that's the rule when eating whole garlic cloves. Sure you leave smelling like a vampire murderer, but it's a group effort. \n\nIt's not every day that I have the pleasure of enjoying a nice cut of meat. So anytime I see steak frites on the menu, it's all over. Bistro Central Parc's version is parfait! Hot fries, medium rare meat. If you can convince the person sitting next to you to order the mussels and share, do it. Dip those frites into the buttery white wine sauce and try not to think of all the calories you're consuming. \n\nBy this time, I'd consumed a few glasses of red wine, steak, fries, garlic, mussels, not to mention the dinner rolls and butter. Though there's normally room reserved for dessert, it just wasn't happening. However, when I come back again, will set the bread aside in anticipation of a sweet treat finale. \n\nOverall, Bistro Central Parc a pleasant surprise tucked away in NoPa. Had it not been for friends who lived nearby, would never have been. I can't speak for its authenticity, but my French friend loved it. And that's good enough for moi.", "author": "Abby S."}

We asked to be seated at a table, but were told all of those tables were reserved, and could either sit at the bar or outside. It was a cold and windy morning, so outside wasn't an option for us. I understand that those tables were reserved for 1130, most for noon or later, but we would've been done by noon if not earlier. Like I said, I understand, but it sucks to sit at a cramped bar, surrounded by an empty dining area. \n\nI had the French onion soup, which was good. Absinthe makes my fave onion soup, but this was a close second. I also had baked Brie, tomato concasse, and roasted garlic with toasted baguette. The roasted garlic was buttery and crispy all at the same time.\n\nIt took at least 15 minutes to get our check because the two waitresses were busy. It seemed like once they got busy, they needed more staff than they had. Annoying, after sitting at a cramped bar for our breakfast.\n\nI wouldn't eat here again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-22", "description": "Overall, my first (and probably last) experience was disappointing.  Not in a major catastrophe kind of way but just falling significantly short of expectations from the rave reviews. \n\nWe arrived around 11:15am for brunch and the place was barely half full with almost two dozen seats empty inside.  We were told politely they were all taken/reserved and had to sit at the bar or outside (where it was freezing cold, no thank you).  So we sat elbow to elbow at the bar while most of those two dozen seats remained empty until we left.  Understand the policy but it was pretty lame and it's why most places don't do reservations for brunch; most parties show up late anyway and it leaves couples like us fending at the bar watching a mostly empty dining room.\n\nFood was ok overall but nothing epic.  French onion soup was the standout, one of the best I've had in the city and almost as good as Absinthe's.  My Eggs Benedict was just ok; tasted pretty average just like everything was assembled together as expected and the English muffin was way too doughy and underdone.  My wife's Brie with toast was decent.\n\nPeople were nice but the two girls were overwhelmed at the end and we were stranded waiting for our check for almost 15 minutes.  \n\nI suppose if you're in the neighborhood, this isn't a terrible bistro but if we are gonna to venture out, we'd rather just go to Absinthe or Bisou which are a lot better.", "author": "Saminda W."}

I made reservations at 5pm on NYE the night before! Somehow they were able to squeeze me in (amazing, right?). Our waiter was great. He made us feel welcomed and explained all the specials and answered all our questions about the menu.\n\nBeef Tartare: I wanted my mom to try this dish because she never has. She ended up really liking it. Loved how it came with a small frisee salad. Great flavor and fresh meat.\n\nFrench onion soup: I was a little scared that the soup would be really salty, but the soup here was delicious. The sweetness of the onions comes through and cheese adds a great element and balances out the sweet onions. My only issue with the soup was that it was just lukewarm. Would have liked it a bit hotter so that by the time we finished the soup, it would be cold. \n\nSeabass: Fish of the day special. I was really excited about this dish, but I was a little disappointed. The fish seemed over cooked just a little. But i enjoyed the creamy polenta and broccolini it came with. \n\nFilet mignon with foie gras: The star of the night! The filet was cooked to a perfect medium. Nice and pink in the middle. It was tender and juicy; I couldn't have asked it for any better. The foie  gras was amazing! Melt in your mouth amazing. And the sauce/reduction they used made it all the better. There was no sauce left by the last bite! \n\nVolcano chocolate cake: Cooked perfectly. Sometimes I hesitate to order these because even if it it's left in the oven for one minute too long, you lose the \"lava\" part of the cake. But when I picked up my fork and cut into it, the chocolate oozed out of the center. I was surprised (not in a bad way) with a bite of cherry after eating a few bites. \n\nService was great. They were all very nice and attentive. My mom had mentioned that we were there for my birthday as we were finishing up and they were asking us how our meal was. Boy were we in for a surprise! As our dessert came out they put a candle on the plate and I could see it from afar. Then all of a sudden, the lights went out and it was completely dark inside.

Having looked at the reviews I was not surprised to see the place relatively empty. Our reservation was for 6pm,the cusp as it turns out of the happy hour; we were just in time to order a glass of the house white each before the witching hour struck. The house wine is not available by the bottle and there was nothing on the wine list for less than $45,with much of the list being in the $65-75 range, This left me feeling uncomfortable, thirsty but unwilling to spring for a bottle at those prices in a neighborhood restaurant.\nThe dish that had appealed to me while browsing the menu the night before ( risotto with lobster sauce and Coquilles St Jacques) was not available. However we shared an excellent starter plate of charcuterie which included rabbit and chicken liver pate, pate de fois gras and a selection of smoked ham. Two of us had the moules mariniere and one had the bouillebaisse; having recently returned from France, I thought that the boullebaisse looked a bit paltry. I tasted the soup though and it was good.

Some parts of my dining experience, I enjoyed; some other parts, I did not care for. The ups and downs ultimately make me feel like BCP is mediocre, thus I gave it 3/5 stars. Rough explanations to follow.\n\nConvenience of the restaurant? Poor. \nI'm told that reservations must be made a month in advance for prime dinner hours, elsewise eat rather early or rather late? I understand that great restaurants are known to have backed up reservations, but I did not find myself wowed by the food. This is why I feel like the reservation hassle for BCP was not worth it. The restaurant is also located uniquely in a neighborhood of homes, yet parking proved difficult. I know that SF has terrible parking availability in general, but to drive up and down those blocks of residential homes at 5pm to find a spot should not have been that hard... I don't think so? \n\nFood? Great, good, & kinda sucked... depending on the dish. \nWhen I went, my table of two ordered three items:\nAmerican Kobe Style beef tartare - The great dish. I loved it. Delicate, aromatic, delicious. \nRisotto aux coquilles St Jacques - The good/okay dish. That's just it. Was good, but no more.\nHouse special of the night ribeye steak - The dish that kinda sucked. This dish was ordered by my partner for the evening. It was him who said it first, but I agree that it tasted like... a chain-diner quality steak. It was so below average and bland. Rib eye is my favorite cut, too. What a shame.\n\nService? ________ (Haha, no comment.)\nAll of the servers are attentive and nice... enough. It's just, I couldn't buy their accents or personas. My opinion of the authenticity of their french characters may be irrelevant, which is why I'm choosing to leave it out. Let's just say that my experience at BCP did not share any similarities to the restaurants I had enjoyed during my time in Paris. \n\n\nBistro Central Parc, in all, was just blaz\u00e9 to me... french accents and all.", "author": "Mimi N."}

It's definitely a great place for a birthday dinner, because they sure made my birthday special.  Here's my story:\n\nI love scallops, heard about this place from friends, and saw that it was 4.5 stars on yelp. So when my friend said he'll treat me out for my birthday, I suggested here. \n\nPrices are reasonable for the qualify of food you get.  Appetizers around $10, dishes around $22-27. My birthday is in December, so they had nice Christmas decorations on the ceiling that gave it a wonderful holiday atmosphere. \n\n** FOOD **\n\nKOBE BEEF TARTARE - (5/5) - \"raw beef with a raw egg on top?? Alan, are you trying to kill me on my birthday??\" \n\"Fine, do you want me to try it first?\" \n\"Yes please :)\" \nHe said he was really good, and I thought to myself, hey this place got 4.5 stars.  It CAN'T kill me.\n.....And it didn't. In fact, it was AMAZING that we ate it until the plate was wiped clean.  The server even gave us extra baked bread for the beef tartare, on the house! I love when restaurants aren't stingy about that, and it was a good start and pleasant surprise for the night.\n\nSCALLOP RISOTTO W/ LOBSTER SAUCE - (4.5/5) - this was delicious, and I loved how generous they were, giving 5 huge scallops for only $22! AND it was fantastic!! It was an interesting combo for scallops with the risotto and lobster sauce, the taste was rich and flavorful, but I would not eat the risotto by itself.  I always eat scallops whenever there is an option and though it still doesn't beat my favorite at Le Bernardin in NYC, these were still great and I was pleasantly pleased with this dish.  \n\nMy friend had the rack of lamb, which I had a bite, and we both agreed it was the best lamb we've ever had.  Again, great flavor. \n\n** BIRTHDAY STORY ** \n\nAfter we finished our food, my friend said he had to go to the bathroom, in which he secretly told the servers it was my birthday.  He came back where we talked for a bit, and all of a sudden, the lights of the whole restaurant went out.  Confused, I turned around and the servers held a plate with dessert and a candle and started singing happy birthday, along with everyone else in the restaurant!! I was so surprised!! After they finished singing, everyone clapped, turned the lights back on, and gave us 2 free glasses of dessert wine!  The host talked to me, shook my hand to wish me a happy birthday, and then gave me a Bistro Central Parc cup as a birthday gift! Omg, this restaurant goes above and beyond to make your birthday special!! The dessert was a delicious cream puff topped with almonds and it was fantastic.

But there were only about 2-3 other tables there so they weren't super busy at the time. The owner (I think) came by and said hello. One thing that bothered me was he picked up our bottle of wine on the opening of the bottle and complimented our selection. This to me was super unsanitary. Especially since he just walked into the restaurant! MINUS ONE STAR!\n\nThe apps were pretty good. A must order are the mussels! The were nice, juicy and not overcooked which is a pet peeve of mine. Who likes tiny shriveled rubbery mussels?! But these were just the opposite. And the sauce?! Soo good! My parents kept dipping their bread in the deliciousness!\n\nSo now comes time for our entrees and the restaurant is now packed! My dad ordered the rack of lamb which came with 2 pieces. Unfortunately half of those pieces were fat leaving my dad with only one piece of lamb. We brought this up to our server since my dad said this may be due to the fact that they are end cuts. But the server basically dismissed us saying that this was local lamb. So local lamb is fatty?! MINUS ONE STAR!\n\nTime for dessert. I told them it was my dad's bday and we ordered the brulee. They were nice enough to turn down the lights and bring out the dessert with a candle while singing happy birthday.\n\nIn addition to dessert, I also ordered a port. I took a pic of it since I take pix of everything and saw that the glass was dirty. In the dim lighting I couldn't see anything, but thanks to my flash, the remnants of what looked like a towel were stuck to the glass. When wiping down glasses you wanna make sure you don't use one of those white kitchen towels since they leave residue on the glass. MINUS ONE STAR!\n\nSo now the nail in the coffin of this awful dining experience. The check! When we got it, it said the margaux was $80. I mentioned this to the waiter and he told us we were wrong. I told him I had a pic of the wine list on my phone and he stormed off. He came back with the wine list and said it was a misprint. Well, shouldn't a restaurant honor their listed prices?! After some arguing, he honored the listed price of $60, but not without some arm twisting. MINUS ONE STAR!\n\nI probably would have given this place 3-4 stars if it wasn't for everything that happened. I know our server was slammed but even so you still have to remember that part of your job is customer service. I've been to a lot of restaurants, but I've never been treated with such disrespect. Even in france our waiters were nicer!", "author": "Elena N."}

The staff is welcoming and cheerful, warm and professional. Absolutely wonderful. We have been so lucky to have had Sebastian as our server on both occasions and I must say that his ebullient nature and superb knowledge of the entire menu makes the experience at Bistro Central Parc all the more fabulous. HE is fabulous!!! Thanks Sebastian!!\nThe Bistro is the kind of place one can wander into spontaneously (several places at the counter to dine) or, as we did, celebrate a special occasion. It's  relaxed but very professional and hits an amazing balance between the two. The food is fresh and lively with nods to the classical and the contemporary. We've never had a bite that was anything less than delicious and the kitchen should be justifiably proud of their excellent work. Absolutely top notch!! Wonderful wine list, by the way.

I'm thinking: Sunday brunch, close by, neighborhood French style - sounds perfect right? BAD IDEA. \n\nParty of two, there were several open tables with no line out the door or waiting list and the waitress (no hostess) seemed entirely put out by our presence. Fair enough, I waited tables for years when I was younger and maybe they were recovering from a morning slam. Out of 10 possible- SEATING SCORE: 3\n\nIn about 5 mins we get menus and water dropped by another server with still no greeting. Then we waited 10 more to get our drink order taken. I enthusiastically tell this second server that it's my birthday (he doesn't acknowledge this in any way) and we order a Bellini and a Kir Royale. The server says nothing other than, \"Are you ready to order food?\" He seems impatient but I explain we need a minute. ORDERING SCORE: 2\n\n10 minutes later we flag down another server and ask about how our drinks are coming along (two ingredient drinks strait out of bottles, still empty tables around us and no wait.) In 5 mins she finally brings them. We proceed to order a regular and a salmon Benedict + a half order of French toast with no modifications. Over the next 45 mins our glasses run empty and when we have to walk up to the bar to order new ones because no one has checked on us) after we order new drinks and the wrong ones are bought we are given lots of attitude. At this point it's still my birthday brunch so I try to keep smiling but it's getting a bit unbelievable. SERVICE SCORE: 1\n\nRecap: 30 mins for a Kir Royale.\n1.5 hours for an average tasting Benedict \n1.75 hours for the first person to ask if everything was OK (by that point we just wanted to leave.)\n\nI was told the place is under new management so perhaps that is the reason for it's decline.\n\nI've served in and managed several restaurants.

Being that the pork belly was a special, I'm not sure how often this shows up on the menu, but I highly recommend it if you want deliciousness without the embarrassment of foodgasming in public.  *blush* \n\nGentlemen, if you're looking for a place to take your special lady and score a couple of bonus points, take her to Bistro Central Parc.

We had the beef tartare, which was a huge portion btw, and it was actually TOO flavorful for me if that makes any sense? Like the herbs was just a bit too much. I gave in and boyf allowed me to order a side of fries, which again there was a lot of... kinda just normal fries but done really well, perhaps in duck fat? Then we had the bouillabaisse which was beautiful. We were completely stuffed after all this, but we were enticed by the seasonal dessert -- warm strawberry compote with ice cream and this little almond tuile?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-19", "description": "You know when you go to a restaurant and it is just one fail after the other to the point of giving up? Well that is exactly what happened at Bistro Central Parc tonight. My father is in town and being the avid restaurant goers who prefers to spend their money on fine foods rather than fine...well..much of anything else, we opted to go here. Actually I picked the place because I am in love with magret canard (duck breast). So much so that I seek out restaurants who serve this and will take a duck confit as a back up. Which brings us here and to my review. \n\n1) The initial: We had reservations at 7pm on a Sunday. We cam in around 6:55pm and waited at the front door. There was a server walking around, but no hostess. Actually we wait about min or so until someone came over. Now this may not be weird in a Denny's, but at a 3 star restaurant, we expect to at least be told \"someone will be right with you\". \n\n2) There seating: We were given options, so that was nice. Unfortunately we had to wait another 5 min or so before we were asked about water. I saw one female waiter, a male and a bus boy (perhaps) who was working the tables. Finally, water. \n\n3) Taking our order: When the server (Alex) came to take our order, I asked about to of the french white wine bottles on the menu. I asked \"could you tell me about these two?\" To which he replied \"They are chardonnays\" I said, \"Yes, can you tell me about them?\" He points and says, \"This one is more round\". I give up and and finally just choose one of the two wines assuming he may not have known about the wine he was serving. After all they did run out of white wine glasses and ended up serving us in a red wine glass I know they don't have Riedel, but please don't try and convince me that this will taste better. The bottle was good though and only $46! \n\n4) The service: Alex was very off and then on. At points I thought it was almost to the unfriendly style wait staff but then he would walk by and check to make sure I was okay. Overall I think he was just busy. \n\n5) The meal: Uh oh! The restaurant did not put \"bacon\" under their duck breast dish nor did they seem to teach their servers to tell us! BIG NO NO for someone who doesn't eat pork and ended up with a big old piece of bacon in her mouth. When I told the server he said that there was bacon in the potatoes. When I explained nicely (yes I was in customer service so I try and make a point without being a jackass)  that this was not on the menu and that I had just put this in my mouth, not a single sorry came out of his mouth! I know it is not your fault personally but shocked! Apologize for the restaurant since obviously this was not okay at all! The took it back and as a woman (manager?) walked by I explained how it would be very helpful to put that on the menu since many people have pork as a dietary restriction. She apologized and as my father and husband ate, I waited for my meal. \n\n6)  The meal part two: They were kind enough to re-do the whole meal, but here is where the \"giving up\" part comes in. The meal came back and the duck was so raw I did say something, but I said it was fine since my dinner party was almost done with their meal and I really just wanted to eat. I will take the blame for that part because I kept the meal as is and ended up throwing over half away. What a waste of $23! \n\n7) The end: They did not offer dessert or anything on our meal which shocked me based on the circumstances. This is a very diverse city with a LOT of different religions, dietary restrictions and personal beliefs that will affect their food choices. To not mention one of the most avoided meats by so many people (pork) and then to not really show much care that the incident happened shows a poor taste in customer service (and yes, I worked in customer service for MANY years which is why I treat staff very nicely, but I also want to be, well, eat a good meal without worrying! \n\nWe have been here before, but I am not sure if we will go back. I have received better service/ care (which is a main part of dining experience for me) at one $ sign restaurants. And for anyone who wants to say \"they were just being French\" stop the stereotypes since we have traveled there. \n\nI think if they would have cared a little more about what happened, and made the food a second time around as good as they did the first. it would have made the experience a whole lot better. \n\nle sigh...", "author": "Kat M."}

In addition to classic foie gras and seared foie gras, it also included a foie gras macaron (the best part)! It was sweet and had just the hint of foie in it. I liked that both the brioche and the bread were served nice and warm. Always a nice touch :) \n\nThoughts on other dishes - \n~ Mussels: a bit dry on the top; not thoroughly soaked in the soup. The fries were great though. This seems more suited for a belgian restaurant though. Check out Frjtz for legit mussels and fries!!\n~ Duck: tender and yummy!\n~ Veggie risotto: was this risotto or just white rice? I couldn't really tell. It was basically red peppers stacked on top of a round cylinder of tightly packed, bland white rice.  I'd give this dish 2 stars. Other yelpers seem to like the scallop/lobster risotto though.\n~ Apple tart: more like poached apples piled on top of a tart-like crust. OK only...\n\n\nMy only other qualm was the waiter didn't really provide us with enough attention. We had to call him over to see the dessert menu or to get drink refills. It could be that they weren't used to the crowd that night all clamoring for their fill of foie gras. \n\nThe prices were quite reasonable for an upscale, intimate french restaurant, and the menu has a good variety of interesting French dishes.

It's part of the experience. Bad  service can affect my palette. That being said, not only was service only so-so here, the food was also just slightly above mediocre.\n\nI ordered the warm spinach salad to start. it was one of the night's specials but there was nothing special about it. Very boring dish I could have made at home. My date got the broccoli soup and said it was too salty. \n\nFor our entrees we got steak frites and a lamb special. I thought the lamb was pretty good but poorly executed. The sauce was too thick and sweet and drowned the dish into a soupy mess. Brussels were not crispy either (or maybe they were soggy because of the sauce).\n\nAfter we sat down, we waited a few minutes to be offered water and had to ask what the specials were. Apparently they are written on a chalkboard near the front of the restaurant but seriously, in a place like this, announce the specials at the table! Food took a while to come out and since your server doesn't bring it, I think we saw our server once during the meal.

Great as an appetizer. \n   \nBraised Beef Cheeks with Red Beet Puree - 4 Stars. The meat is slow cooked for hours, so it is extremely tender to the touch. I thoroughly enjoyed this texture. Surprisingly, I was able to taste the goat cheese which gives the dish a different take considering that its paired with the red beet puree which was light in taste. \n \nRossini - 5 Stars.

The restaurant is nestled on the street corner of a mostly residential area, so parking is usually decent and there isn't much street noise. Inside can be a bit crowded, which gives the place a cozy feel. It gets noisy, but not to the point where an intimate chat becomes a screaming match, a problem of some other SF dining locales.\n\nThe staff is friendly and funny. The kitchen has an open concept, so you can watch your food being made and talk to chefs and waiters. \n\nNow to the food. I had a glass of the house Bordeaux to start (which in some circles classifies as food) and it was delicious - robust flavor and a nice hefty pour. My boyfriend had the filet Mignon, which sat on a lightly fried potato gratin, fantastic from the bite that was begrudgingly bestowed upon me. I had the fish of the day, salmon with a teriyaki glaze and curry sauce.  I enjoyed it so much I asked the waitress if, hypothetically, one were to call ahead one could request the salmon. She said yes (!) If you enjoy salmon, I would definitely recommend doing this - best salmon I have had in San Francisco. \n\nFor dessert, we split the Chocolate Volcan. We weren't quite sure what it was, but figured we couldn't go wrong with chocolate or volcano-themed dessert. We were more than right. Chocolate Volcan is like a cross between a souffl\u00e9 and a flour-less chocolate cake, served hot and garnished with mint and ice cream. It was so delicious, our waiter jokingly tried to join us in devouring it. Many of the other desserts on the menu look appealing, but this will always be my favorite. Not too heavy or overly cloying - just damn good and extremely chocolate-y.

A French gentleman, who I am assuming is the owner, answered the phone. I asked him how long the wait was going to be for a table of 2. He responded to me with his accent, \"For you, I have one waiting right now.\" A vividly fast flashback of my recent trip to Paris was only appropriate. Sure enough, I stepped in and was seated immediately. \n\nI ordered the Magret De Canard, which is duck breast accompanied by a small bed of spinach, potatoes, and half sliced figs all swimming in sauce. My duck was prepared medium rare, which my waiter recommended to preference and it was nothing short of being flawless. Everything was rich in flavor and nothing on the plate overpowered anything else. The definition of teamwork.  \n\nMy friend ordered the Carre Dagneau, Ratatouille, which was the rack of lamb also cooked at a medium rare. The lamb was perfect.

I loved it!\n\nThis is a little place, but I feel the staff does an amazing job of being personal and accommodating. In fact, I somehow booked the wrong reservation time, and when I called same-day and realized my mistake, they fixed it and reassured me all was well! (It was :) )\n\nMy husband and I became total snobs after the dinner we had. We didn't know how we would go back to regular, every day food. We've had French food before (usually on anniversaries), but we just felt this place took it to the next level. The way we wordlessly expressed our amazement with our eyes as we silently savored the biteful of food we had in our mouth was enough to prove we'd never be able to settle for less again (at least for the evening. Than we went to China town and dove into some really grubbin' buns and it was ok). \n\nThis was my first experience with foie gras, and it was executed quite well - the filet mignon was delicious, and I would recommend it.\n\nHowever, the best thing I ate that night was likely the beef cheeks. I can't wrap my head around the way they blended beets, goat cheese, and some veggies into this beautiful, balanced sauce that cradled the beef cheeks so elegantly. When I took my first bite, I exclaimed \"why would anyone eat anything other than beef cheeks when beef cheeks exist?!?!\" I meant it.\n\nWhen myself or my Mother make a roast, I always cut off the fatty pieces. Yes, they're tender, but ew - that texture! No. I can't. My Mom loves it - my hubby doesn't mind it, either, to get that delicious fat flavor. \n\nBut this, somehow, was the best of both. It was so soft that I just touched it with the side of my knife and it slide to the bottom of the plate with a little-too-loud clank. It was so much softer than any cut of beef, but didn't have the gumminess that I hate of actual fat. It didn't have an entirely fatty flavor - it was somewhere inbetween. \n\nI mean, I would eat the cheeks of any animals at this point if I were assured they would taste this good.\n\nThis place is Aces.

We had dinner reservations at 6 PM but were a little late because it was difficult to find street parking, so make sure to allot an extra 15 minutes to look for parking.\n\nF O O D:\n*WARM BRIE w/ Potato Pancake and Mizuna Salad ($9.50): DELISH!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/W97siDhQbWIVa0MEpcq9iA?select=amOAN6cKbqviMv9biA9_lw\n\nThe potato pancake was lightly browned to a crisp and crowned with an oozing chunk of melting brie. The combination of the soft, crisp potato cake and the rich brie created a delectable savory creaminess which was balanced by the Mizuna's (Japanese greens) slight peppery flavor. \n \n*SWEETBREAD w/ Mushrooms ($10): The BEST sweetbread I've ever had! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/W97siDhQbWIVa0MEpcq9iA?select=lVxW___vn5JF0agTJDOgOg\n\nThe sweetbreads were perfectly seared creating a slight crispiness around the edges while maintaining it's rich, creamy and soft texture. The mushrooms had a hearty meaty flavor which complemented the mild flavor of the sweetbread and the mushroom au jus was lip-smacking good as it was bursting with a rich and savory woody flavors. \n\n*TOURNEDOS ROSSINI - Filet Mignon w/ Foie Gras ($28): An AMAZING union!  Better than Harris' Filet Mignon Rossini! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/W97siDhQbWIVa0MEpcq9iA?select=P6OXn6VEfduz4YeRFC_IGQ\n\nTopped with a luscious slice of foie gras, the filet mignon was marinating in a pool of black truffle sauce. As I cut into the foie gras and filet, I saw the juices from the foie gras dribble down onto the tender slice of filet. As I put the fork of this perfect union in my mouth, it was love at first bite. The filet was soft and tender, and the foie gras added that layer of fatty decadence to take it over the top. The black truffle sauce turned this into a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois adding a rich, savory and complex woody flavor that complemented the pairing without hindering the natural beefy flavors. \n\n*CHOCOLATE LAVA CAKE ($6): RICH AND DECADENT! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/W97siDhQbWIVa0MEpcq9iA?select=oxL6hegJ4cyRfUqu9FIeqg\n\nAs we cut into the warm lava cake, chocolate started oozing out which is always a good indicator of a perfectly baked lava cake. The exterior of the cake was slightly crisp and the interior was fluffy and light. The oozing chocolate sauce was rich and thick but was slightly bitter, allowing the dessert to be decadent but not overwhelmingly rich or sweet. It was the perfect ending to our meal!\n\nS E R V I C E:\nMAGNIFIQUE!\n\nThe owner and staff were very warm, friendly and attentive.

When I arrived and explained that we were meeting friends and if there were a restaurant by a similar name the hostess said, \"I don't know.\" She did not say, \"I'm not sure, I don't believe so, but if you really aren't certain if you wait a moment I can check for you.\"\n\nSo we sat to wait for our party at a practically empty bar at the two seats reserved for people without reservations (our friend had reservations we didn't know the maiden name). I got a hot chocolate (think Swiss Miss) and my partner asked for an Orangina. \"We don't have Orangina the best I can do is orange juice and Perrier.\" I would have preferred, I'm sorry we don't carry Orangina but I could mix orange juice and a Perrier if you'd like?\" How about a Coke? \"We don't have coke.\" I would imagine in a bar they carry a carbonated sugary soft drink but that option wasn't offered. Ok, I'll take you up on the orange juice and Perrier. \"We're out of orange juice.\" I would have liked to hear, \"I'm sorry, I know I offered you an orange juice based drink, but failed to realize we were out. What might I get you instead?\"\n\nSo they sat us outside, where it was cold. The reservation was for 5. There were 4 chairs. Then they wanted to sit us all in the corner away from the heat lamp. They were more concerned about changing the configuration of the tables than the comfort of their guests. Eventually they acceded to our request to move closer to the heat. I didn't mind eating with my coat on, it was just like camping.\n\nI wish I could comment about the tastiness of the duck breast but they were out. The duck confit was okay, but just. Onion soup was ordered as an appetizer but when the entrees arrived, no soup in sight. After we asked to have the soup that didn't arrive taken off the bill a few moments later the soup shows up. It was rejected a second time since were already eating entree. Poor coordination.\n\nThe desert was fabulous. If you eat here, get dessert. Apparently the fish was very good but oddly paired with lentils (looks like they pair everything with lentils).\n\nWhile we waited in line for the single restroom it occurred to me that while our waiter was very nice, even if the food were better, it is not a repeat visit. I'm glad I don't live in that neighborhood because this exists only because there are few options in the area. Even so the poor customer service is unforgivable.

Perhaps, the reason why is gentleman and woman who appeared to be owners are French? \n\nThe food was so simple but incredibly delicious. Yes, I just said french food is simple. Looking at each dish we ordered, I noticed that are there were very few ingredients, and yet, each dish was so rich and flavorful.\n\nGreat food and even better, no to minimal wait. We walked in a little before noon on a Sunday and not only were we immediately seated, but there a few open tables. During our time there, there may been a table waiting to be sat for 5 minutes, but never  a line out the door waiting to be seated.\n\nThe eats: frisee salad w/lardons & poached egg, pasta carbonara, croque madame and creme brulee. I'm not sure, but have a feeling this will be the first of several visits. \nAfterall I couldn't keep my eyes off nearby tables food - eggs benedict, french toast, steak and eggs.

My boyfriend and I were trying to get a table at Brenda's French Soul Food, but the wait was 1 1/2 hours, so we decided to drive out to this place. \n\nUnlike most brunch places, it was not too crowded (probably because the selection of item isn't as large compared to most places, but that means they are focused on making the dishes they have amazing). I really liked the atmosphere here -- very laid back and we didn't feel rushed or cramped. Things are a bit pricey, but the food was delicious. \n\nMy favorite item here was definitely the mimosa! They use a very good Champagne.. hands down the best mimosa I've ever had, which has now ruined me and left me incapable of ordering them at other places since I will forever make the comparison.

Having dined at both places within the space of a few nights, it felt deeply unjust that Central Parc should enjoy a higher rating on Yelp or anywhere, for that matter. \n\nThis past Friday we were pining for a steak and were surprised to be able to get a reservation at CP on short notice, only to find the place half-empty when we arrived (on a Friday at 7:30?!). We were nonetheless treated as if we were a royal hassle by our waitress, who seemed greatly put out by the experience of serving us, though we were about as straight-forward a table as you can possibly be (couple of steaks, please). Compare this with our meal this evening at a jam-packed Le P'Tit Laurent (on a Monday!?), where our waitress juggled multiple tables in a crowded, raucous environment and still found the time and energy to serve us with grace and real warmth. The contrast was stark. \n\nThe wife and I were left wondering what it was that had previously wowed us about CP and came to the firm conclusion that it must have been its famous filet mignon with foie gras, a dish it can no longer serve. The simple fact of the matter is we won't be back to Central Parc, whose sterling reputation seems to have gotten in the way of its caring about getting the little things right. Do yourself a favor and check out the Glenn Park neighborhood champ, Le P'tit Laurent, instead.", "author": "Matthew Z."}

There was a great crust of seasoning on it and it was so juicy! I'm glad my bestie gave me a rib to clean off. nom nom nom.\n\nRisotto Aux Coquilles St Jacques - \nScallops on top of risotto in lobster sauce. This dish was underwhelming and kind of bland.

The croque monsieur was perfect, cheesy goodness, prepared like you get it in France, with the bread crisped over a flame and not in a toaster.

But to miss out on truly one of SF's best hidden gems will be a huge mistake. It's chic, it's modern, and it's down right delicious. The dim candlelit dining room sets the perfect tone for a romantic date or a night of sophistication with close friends.\n\nSInce foie gras will be banned in mid July, I'm on a mission to get it where I can. The special that evening happened to be a filet mignon topped with seared foie gras, but the scallop risotto had caught my attention early on. I could have gotten both as my main course, but that would have been overkill. Luckily, our party worked it out by ordering the scallops as an appetizer and splitting between 3. It wasn't hard to convince them. Who could pass up on scallops, risotto, & lobster sauce?! I'm so glad we didn't. A few of the scallops were unevenly seared, but the flavor was on point. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who comes here, either as an app or entree.\n\nThe scallops were good, but the steak...oh my. I'm not one to be picky about what cut of steak I eat, as long as it's cooked well. Many times when I request medium rare, chefs usually overcook it to a medium, so I tend to ask for more on the rare side. This filet was cooked PERFECTLY! How could I not love a chef who knows how to properly cook meat? The foie gras, on the other hand, could have been seared a tad longer for that perfect creamy yet slightly firm texture. The abundant pool of sauce was left undesired for as the bed of potato gratin drowned in overwhelming flavor. Less is surely more. Chef was very generous with the portions, and for the inexpensive prices, this was a very affordable taste of semi-fine dining.\n\nBistro Central Parc can be easily compared to Chapeau! with the similar menu, prices, and outstanding service, but the dessert was not even closely on par.

But you can keep reading if you want to know my reasonig (I usually give places at least 4 stars on here).\n\nThe place was empty on a Friday night. Maybe 7 was still early? \n\nWorse than that, the host was condescending, snooty, and all over the place. He was trying to be the waiter and the host, walking away from our table mid-sentence to greet incoming patrons. He didn't know the specials too well, and didn't know anything about the wines we were choosing - he couldn't describe any of them, just kept repeating the names of the wines. His general behavior towards us was rude - when we would ask questions about what a dish was like, he would say \"What does it sound like?\" I've been in the service industry so I'm sympathetic to waiters and hosts, but for a place in this price range and ambiance, the host should a) have better manners and b) not do a million things at once.\n\nThe food turned out to be okay, but there wasn't anything \"French\" or special about it. It was like any other slightly upscale restaurant in SF. We had the lamb shank (sauce was very rich and salty), a SUPER small portion of scallops in risotto with a lobster sauce that was pretty bland... some basic apps, and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (also bland, again) and chocolate volcano cake (like a warm lava cake - pretty good).\n\nOverall, disappointed in the experience here and would rather spend this kind of money at Nopa close by.", "author": "Jenn H."}

The waiter really made our night...what a funny guy! \nMy friend was flying out of SFO and we tried to spend his last day here in SF doing touristy things. He has never tried French food in the US so of course I turned to yelp to find the perfect dining place.\n We started off with 3 appetizers: a plate of cold cut/cured meat (procuitto, duck, chicken p\u00e2t\u00e9, rabbit p\u00e2t\u00e9, beef, pork butt rolled in bacon - forgive me but I don't remember all the fancy names for the meats but it was amazing!!), garlic butter escargot, beef tartare. Although I'm not a beef eater myself, I heard the tartare is to die for. If my bf could, he would've licked the plate clean. We ordered entrees to share: mussels in curry-garlic white wine w/side order of fries , medium rare duck over a bead of greens and potatoes with liqueur soaked cherries, and scallop risotto. Everything was just perfectly cooked and executed. The plating of every dish was beautiful. By the time we finished our meal, every plate was scraped clean. Who says you have to leave a tiny bit of food on your plate to be polite?!? Not us!  We were showing the chef we REALLY enjoyed every last bit of food. \n    We ended the night with creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was silky and creamy- so rich and delicious!

I obviously looked this place up on yelp and decided what I was getting before even getting there. Onion soup, the scallops, and creme brulee. Then the specials threw me for a little loop, but I decided to stick with my original plan. \n\nThe owner (the older French guy) was super nice to me. They cleaned the bar space for me and always made sure that I was doing well the entire time during my dinner. \n\nFoodwise, all three were delicious. Onion soup - perfect temperature and the perfect amount of cheesiness and onion. The scallops were beautifully cooked and the lobster risotto was so creamy and delicious. I prefer my creme brulee with less/no sugar on top - I know for most people it's the best part, but for me, it's really not. I enjoy the custard the most. \n\nI think what puts this to a 5 star restaurant is that I decided to pay and wait for my lyft driver outside of the restaurant. It was probably only a few minutes out there and the owner came by to ask about my meal and kept me company until the driver got there. Now that is great customer service.

The interior decor seems less romantic - white walls, stainless steel counter, local art on the walls and tables nestled together; however, the welcoming staff (many French) create an air of warm, coziness. \n\nA long flight left us starving when we arrived in San Francisco. An overly ambitious late lunch left us in search of something low key and light for dinner. While French isn't typically my go to cuisine for something light, we took a chance and fared quite well. \n\nBistro Central Parc dispels the myth that the french are rude; upon entering we were warmly greeted by the staff like we were regulars or old friends. Once seated, we were given small, crusty french rolls to nosh while we perused the menu. Initially, we were both taken with the scallop risotto, but in order to try more than one menu item, opted to split and order of risotto and an order of the mussels. Artfully presented, the risotto was delicious. Served with lobster sauce and scallops, the dish was rich and decadent. The large scallops were cooked perfectly and we savored every bite. BCP offers two preparations of mussels; we opted for the more traditional preparation. The mussels were good; the accompanying sauce was rich, but still light enough to be a perfect complement to the risotto.\n\nBistro Central Parc was the perfect destination for our first night in town; delicious, classy food in a cozy, casual atmosphere.

The filet was perfectly cooked and very tender.\n\nThe warm Brie with roasted garlic appetizer was delicious\n\nMuscles lacked flavor and were tiny.  Don't orden tris!\n\nThe Escargots bourguignon had way too much parsley. It overwhelmed the escargot. Do not bother with this dish.\n\nWine by the glass was very good.

Food speaks for itself. Ordered the beef tartate with quail egg. DELICIOUS. No stomach aches the day after. Roasted beet salad with  goat cheese and lamb chops were divine! I usually don't go for lamb, especially rare but it was just simply made to perfection. The whole meal with drinks was reasonably priced. I enjoyed dining here and even got a greeting from the owner himself!", "author": "Caye Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-10-07", "description": "5 stars on taste alone, but this place is not without issues.  It's just that 4 stars is too low.\n\nSo it was my girlfriends and my 4 year anniversary and we usually do something simple, but I wanted to take it up a notch but not to a point that I'd be really broke.  \n\nSo, we'll start w/ the issues because it there are just a few and the first one happened in the beginning.  So, I made a reservation about a week before and they confirmed it a few days before our dinner, but when we showed up the reservation was no where to be found!  Luckily, they had a table for us anyways (although it was still quite busy).  They were apologetic throughout the entire dinner, but I was still a little annoyed because it was our anniversary and I looked at a number of restaurants to find the right one.  Next is the price.  Yes, I wanted to go up on the price and I was ok with it because it was a really special occasion and for one appetizer, a half a bottle of wine, two main entrees, and a creme brulee desert, we got over $130.  That was the price I was aiming for, but this certainly wouldn't be a once a month sort of meal for 2 grad students.\n\nOn to the good stuff.  The service was great, a little on the slow side since they only had 2 servers, but they were courteous and they were actually French (or they were pretending with a french accent and hella pulling it off).  The service had a feel of being upscale without being snobby or pretentious, as if the waiters were trained in a 5 star restaurant but had left for a smaller, more low key place. One moment that I thought was actually pretty classy was that when the waiter brought out our half bottle of wine, he poured a little bit of wine for me to sample.  So I felt it was adorable because 1) I've been a student (undergrad, masters, M.D.) for a long time, so it is really, really rare that I experiencing something as fancy as this because I'm perpetually poor.  2)  He gave it to me as a sense of masculine chivalry even though my palette is horrible and my girlfriend's is much better.  3)  He didn't seem snooty about it at all, just as if I had been 20 years older and much more accomplished than I actually was.  It was just class all around!\n\nThe food was simply phenomenal.  We started with a simple role which was a little harder than I would have liked but still quite tasty.  We then shared the baked brie which came with a baked head of garlic, diced tomatoes, and 4 small slices of toasted baguette which was subtle but still enjoyable.  My girlfriend then went with the risotto and poached scallops which was creamy yet bold.  The Scallops were perfect, not too chewy or watery.  The risotto was a bit overcooked for my tastes, but my girlfriend loved it.  I had the ratatouille and lamb chops.  It was the best lamb chops I have ever tasty, and I have had a lot of lamb chops.  Mine was medium rare and spiced, marinated, cooked, and served to perfection.  The ratatouille came with a sauce that was sweet, savory, sharp, and with a hint of spice all at once, I couldn't quite nail down on specific flavor.  It also came with a hashtag shaped pretzel and a hush puppy like thing that was tasty.  It wasn't a super tiny amount like I imagine most fancy places would be and we were filled up quickl.  We finished with the creme brulee which while not the best I've ever had, still ranks in my top 5.\n\nOverall, it was the perfect place for what I was looking for.  It's probably too pricey for most college/grad students to do more than once or twice a year but not so expensive that it is impossible to go to.  It is a little on the small side and cramped, but not uncomfortably so.  The service was great and classy but not snooty, the food was simply top notch and erased any other issues I had with the place.", "author": "Vincent-Arthur B."}

Nothing really stands out about this place from looking at the exterior because it's tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. Then when you walk in, everything changes.\n\nThe servers and the owner are all friendly and warm hosts. Both times I have been here, the dining experience was great for the food and the welcome.

I took my family and Matt T. here on Christmas Eve night to get our French on.  Everything was delicious but I hate to say it.  \"It ain't no Chapeau!\"  You can't help but compare after having one of the best French meals in SF.  They were close though, I give Central Parc Bistro 4.5 stars. \n\nThey give complimentary bread but it wasn't warm or toasted. \n\nHighlights for appetizers: \n\nThe traditional French onion soup ($8.50) hit the spot real good.  It came out steaming with perfectly baked cheese on top and warm, ooey, gooey cheese with onions inside.  It's just a bowl of happiness in my opinion.  I really hate to compare it to Chapeau! but one thing Bistro Central Parc was missing was some good crunchy pieces of bread in the soup. Le sigh. \n\nThe mussels au curry madras ($12.50) had white wine, shallots, parsley, curry madras, and cr\u00e8me fraiche.  The steamed mussels were drenched in a very creamy and delicious sauce.  I would use my spoon to drink it while I slurp up the mussel meat!  I recommend you dip the complimentary bread in the soup base.  Beware, the white wine is a little strong so you may get a nice light buzz off of it.\n\nPommes frites ($5) were solid. They tasted really fresh and crisp. Great to go with an entr\u00e9e.  \n\nThe warm brie on potato pancake with mizuna salad ($9.50) was good but not outstanding.  The salad gave it a more asian fusion taste.  The sweetbread with mushrooms ($10)  was an interesting dish but not memorable to my taste buds.\n\nOnto the main course!\n\nI was so happy that they were doing specials off the menu for the Tournedos Rossini ($28).  It was everything I could ask for in a French meal: filet mignon with foie gras.   The presentation was fierce since it was literally a tower of goods.  The filet mignon was toppled on top of fried potatoes along with the foie gras in this amazing black truffle sauce. The filet mignon was black pepper galore and I loved it.  I had it medium and it was done to pink perfection.  The foie gras was...different.  It was served more lukewarm and had a different texture to it.  It didn't have the crunchy texture but it melted in my mouth.\n\nI tried the beef bourguignon ($18 and it was my second favorite dish.  It was drenched in a rosemary-red wine sauce and seasonal vegetables.  The meat was cooked oh so tender, I barely had to chew.  The sauce is a tad bit salty but it went great with the vegetables and you can taste a little wine in it.  They are fearless with their wine in the dishes!  \n\nThe Risotto with seared scallops in lobster sauce ($18) was delicious but something I wouldn't order again.  The scallops were cooked perfectly and they were good sized.  However, the risotto could definitely use a little more flavor.  However, I'm sure my taste buds were immune to salt after having heavy beef dishes.  The risotto had a great creamy texture to it as well.  Other main courses were the fish of the day and the lamb both looked delicious but I didn't get to try.\n\nDesserts:\nThe creme brulee ($7.50) and the pyramide de chocolate ($9) were my favorites.  Creme brulee had a nice crispy sugar coated on top of the rich cream underneath.  The pyramide had a really rich and fluffy chocolate cream with the cake.  We also had two Buche de Noel: one chocolate and one caramel ($9 each).  This dessert was like a spiral sponge cake with caramel or chocoalte inside.  It reminded me of the chinese round sponge cake so it wasn't anything special.  I hope they vary up their desserts next time!\n\nOverall, still a solid experience. Make sure you order the right dishes and you will have a magical meal.", "author": "Cam C."}

We decided to meet up and my friend decided to try Bistro Central Parc. This restaurant is rather small and I was surprised they were able to accommodate our party of 10. The service was satisfactory and the food was decent. I think the prices are reasonable considering the quality of the food. They serve high quality French cuisine and I believe no entree was more then $25. For my meal I had:\n\nKobe Beef Tartare - This was the first time I have ever consumed raw beef. I normally eat my steaks medium rare, but this was the first time I ordered beef tartare. I would say that it wasn't bad. It was actually pretty good. I think it had a little too much acid (a bit on the sour side), but it was an overall tasty dish. I think I also need to get use to eating raw beef, before I can be a true critic. I remember the first time I had sushi. I was just glad to get it down, but now I love it!\n\nSeared Seabass - The Seabass was delicious. Cooked perfectly with a crispy skin. It was light, but yet just enough to fill me up. \n\nBistro Central Parc was surprisingly good considering the affordability.

It was just over $100, which for the quality of food and ambiance was definitely worth it.\n\nI went in to cut the short ribs so my friend and I could share - I barely put pressure on my fork and it fell apart. Amazing. The rabbit was well done and the vegetables complimented it well. The wine list wasn't extensive per se, but the wait staff was well versed in pairings which matters more to me anyway. What good is a $300 bottle if it doesn't go well with your meal?\n\nOne thing I really appreciate is the owner stopping by each table with a smile to make sure everyone was having a good time.

It all started with trying to find a delicious restaurant where we could sit outside with our dog.  I called a few different places that had strict rules against dogs and weren't very nice about it.  After seeing that Bistro had 4.5 stars, I thought, \"Why not?\"  A gentleman with an authentic French accent answered the phone and told us that of course we could bring our dog!  In fact, that they were excited to see him.  He asked for his name and told us we were all set.\n\nThis restaurant is nestled in a quaint neighborhood in the Western Addition where people walk their dogs, walk to the grocery store and hang out at Bistro Central Parc.  The restaurant doesn't look like much, and it certainly doesn't look like a 5 star restaurant but I promise you that it is!  Everyone is so welcoming and happy to see you there.  It's like you have been friends for years visiting their home.\n\nTheir food is simply magnificent.  Everything is fresh and as gourmet as can be without being too bougie.  All of their food was portioned perfectly and enough for 3 people (and a dog) to taste.\n\n-Wild Mushroom Risotto: A sophisticated take on one of my favorite home dishes, Campbell's Mushroom sauce over rice.  The mushrooms were absolutely fresh and the risotto had a thick mushroom sauce over it that was so delicious.  I highly recommend this one on a cold night.  \n-Warm brie on potato pancake over mizuna salad: Not one of my favorites but who doesn't love warm brie?  I thought this was an interesting idea but I didn't really like the potato pancake.  It needed to have more flavor in order to pair better with the brie, which is by nature very mild (taking off 1/2 a star for this.)\n-Scallops with risotto in lobster sauce: this one was a special request that they were nice enough to honor.  I saw this dish in a picture on Yelp and it looked amazing.  I asked if they could make it and they were more than happy to make me a dish that wasn't on the menu.  That was REALLY nice of them!  This restaurant really knows good customer service.  A few of the risottos were a bit cold on the inside so I need to take off 1/2 a star for that as well but everything else tasted heavenly.\n-Chicken W/ Mashed Potatoes: wonderful!  The chicken was nice and moist and pulled apart easily.  It was seasoned to perfection and the mashed potatoes were delicious.\n\nThis restaurant is A+ in my book.

We were served by Jerome, who also speaks French, which is a really plus for me. I am french-speaking and love to be talked to in French when I'm in a French Restaurant. They both knew my first name from the reservation and called me that way. It felt so homey, I liked it.\n\nThe place is really nice and I love all the lights on the ceiling.\n\nConcerning the food, I would say it's always nearly prefect but not quite 100% perfect.\n\nI had the Marrow bones as appetizer, the \"magret de canard\" as entree and the \"Fraises \u00e0 la Modena\" for dessert. Everything was good, and the meet was absolutely amazing, it melted in my mouth! The marrow bones were sort of grilled and served with a little salad. Both had much too much salt on it (and I already usually put a lot of salt on my food), which is kind of a pleasure killer. The duck was great, served with potatoes and spinach. It was delicious, except that for me, the sauce had too much sugar in it. The strawberries were very good, served with vanilla ice cream. Jerome told us that they added sugar to the preparation and I wouldn't do that. Too much sugar, again.\n\nMy husband had the Onion Soup, he loved it, the filet mignon, melting as well, and the chocolate Volcan, delicious.\n\nSo I would say, great place, great people, affordable prices, and good food. It was just not the complete wow effect I was expecting for the food, because of too much salt/sugar, which covers all the other tastes. Still, I'll go back to try other stuff on their menu, because still, everything looks delicious.", "author": "Emilie M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-12-04", "description": "Disappointed. I have been regularly to Bistro Central Parc but since it changed owner, prices went up and portion smaller. Escargot are less good than some other French places in SF and really expensive (14$ while we can find better quality and with the shell at $9 elsewhere), same for the Brie, the portion was so small and pricy $15! (While we can get 3 times more for $10 at other nice French places). The duck breast was good though. I wish the potatoes were freshly cooked in the duck fat but it wasn't, it was pre-cooked since a while looking at the texture and flavor. The bouillabaisse came with too few broth...\nI would just go back for the duck breast because it's hard to find and to try the riz de veau too, but not for appetizers. \nWith previous owner, budget was about 40$ wine, food and tips included. Now, it's about 60$ for the same but in lesser quantity. I am French and I was also surprised that they got rid of most French employees, replaced by pushy waitresses and different kitchen staff. Sounds like they cut off on expenses at the detriment of quality and raised the price to pay the rent of the restaurant itself...\nThe only French guy I talked to was probably the boss, a bold guy, and he was really rude. Not smiling, not even a thank you. Not surprised he got also a bad review earlier just for himself.\nDisappointed.", "author": "Anne T."}

The first time was for dinner and I received excellent service.  I've meant to come back for brunch and today was supposedly that day where I could celebrate Mother's Day.\n\nI had made reservations at 12:30pm for a party of five.  When we arrived, the restaurant was not busy and we were probably third table seated at the restaurant.  About 12:40pm, we ordered our food.  Three people ordered soup along with the main course.  Our server, ZARINA, asked if we would like the soup served with our main entrees or split into two individual courses.  We chose the latter option of two courses.  So far, so good.  About twenty minutes later, we received our soup.  It was a little late given the low number of tables, but this was not the issue.\n\nThis is where it gets interesting.  About 1:30pm, our main courses had not arrived yet.  Between the five of us, we had ordered a ham and cheese sandwich with a sunny-side up egg, risotto, mussels, side spinach, roasted potatoes, a side of smoked salmon, and side of fries.  We also had an order of French toast which came out with the soup.  We asked ZARINA what was taking so long with our food.  By now the restaurant was full of customers who had arrived after us and received their entrees before us.  They were either in the middle or finishing their meal.  \n\nZARINA started to lecture us in a condescending tone and stated we chose to have our soup first which caused the delay.  I understand that it was normal practice for restaurants to space out courses; however we had been waiting for over THIRTY MINUTES after we had finished our soups.  At this point, we were watching other customers eat their full entr\u00e9e.  Please keep in mind that it had been about 50 minutes since we ordered.  After she gave her condescending remarks, she continued to glare down at us for an additional three minutes as if we were idiots for even asking the whereabouts of our food.  We were all speechless.  Were we supposed to get the food or cook it ourselves at this point??\n\nAbout five minutes passed and ZARINA returned to bring more bread to our table.  Apparently she also brought her attitude with her.  She bent over at me and started to reprimand me saying, \"NEXT time....\"  I could not believe I was being lectured once more.  I quickly interrupted her and told her, I was tired of hearing excuses.  The table next to us had their appetizer and was finishing up their main course.  Guests with parties larger than ours were seated after us, served their entrees before us, and were either finishing up their meals or even paying their restaurant bills.  Rather than finding out what had happened to our meal, ZARINA was lecturing us again.   If she would have apologized or said, \"Let me check,\" rather than lecture me, I would not have complained about been upset.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a pleasant brunch turned out to be a disaster.  I told the other male server/host that I did not want her serving us anymore.  The only saving grace for this restaurant was the owner.  He came and spoke with us personally and was apologetic over his employee's service.  He later comped us four desserts.  After speaking with the owner, we had excellent service by the same male server/host I most recently spoke with.\n\nAbout 2:15pm, towards the end of our dessert, ZARINA came to apologize.  I honestly felt it was forced and she tried to make excuses yet again.  \n\nI used to recommend people to this restaurant.  The French-style cuisine was good.  I was looking for another small bistro-type restaurant like \"Chapeau!\" and thought I had found one until this experience today.  We ended up leaving the restaurant at 2:30pm.  It had taken us an entire TWO HOURS for brunch with one cumulative hour spent waiting for food in a restaurant which was not fully booked.  What a waste of time on a beautiful Sunday.\n\nI hate writing negative reviews, but I feel this issue needs to be addressed.", "author": "Ernest Y."}

The salad itself was so fresh that it's changed my whole view on how \"fresh salad\". The textures of the rich brie and potato was nicely balanced out with the lightness of the salad. It turned out to be a great combo\n- Sweet breads with mushrooms: I swear for the longest time, i couldn't figure out what the bread was (I wasn't the one who ordered the food). It was so soft and so delicious, I had my speculations on it being a type of meat? Hey, give me a break, I was super sleep deprived, okay? But if you pick an appetizer, I highly recommend this dish! \n- Foie gras: now now, i know foie gras is officially banned from being purchased, but I have to speak about how great this dish was. Yes, this is considered a form of torture. The foie was so rich and had that hard to pinpoint savory taste to it. Then when you got tired of how rich the foie was, you had the other components to balance out the flavor. So this is what went down. One bite foie gras, went to foodie heaven, had a bite of the potatoes, then went the taste buds were happy, then another bite of foie gras, went to heaven AGAIN. \n\nI swear my tastebuds were so happy after that dinner!

The presentation could have been a little nicer but taste-wise, it really was nice.  We also had a side of the ratatouille, which was just ok (I guess we had imagined more of a stew/soup rather than sauteed veggies (peppers, onions, squash) served on a long plate.  The pommes frites, however, were piping hot, satisfyingly crunchy and perfect.\n\nFor mains, my filet mignon was good (although clearly more medium than the medium rare I requested.

This time the experience was so mundane, the food so run of the mill and the service so bland it convinced my partner and I to never return. It's a block from our apartment and all we want is a pleasant brunch. Boring isn't part of our wish. So, you don't serve bread for brunch. Ok. You didn't even try to make your French toast offering to be special or delicious. It wasn't. And I should have made my croque Monsour at home. I could do it better.

According to her, because she's my mother, she is the only one who will tell me the \"real\" \"truth\" \"everytime.\"  For example, the day before yesterday, we were browsing wedding gowns online.  Not looking for anything specific, just getting an idea of what is out there.  I clicked on a link and scrolled through the options.  \n\nMy mother immediately said, \"These are not representative of what the dress will look like on you.  These models are all tall, willowy and slender.  Of course the dresses look nice on them.  For you, you should look at PLUS SIZE BRIDAL GOWNS.  That would be a more realistic example for you.\"  Oh mother.  I love you and all your opinions.  \n\nThe very same day, I had reservations at Bistro Central Parc.  I can always count on good French food to have lots of butter.  I love butter and salt.  Luckily, I dined with a cardiologist that evening who was carefully monitoring my butter/salt/wine intake (high/high/very low).  Marina and Vic have been here more regularly than I, even though I live the closest.  It was walking distance from my residence.  I walked it in anticipation of the heart attack.  \n\nWe were seated in the quiet corner near the back.  The front of the restaurant was bustling and got crowded as people arrived and their table was not ready yet.  Our fault, really.  We had a really nice meal and really great conversation.  I told the story of my engagement.  And I consider myself the foremost expert on all things relationship and getting-along.  \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered: mushroom risotto, escargot, trio of foie gras, kobe beef tartare.  The trio of foie gras kept Marina so happy.  Her face lit up when the waiter described it.  It was one generous slice seared served atop a poached pear, one tourchon pate, and one macaroon with foie gras filling.  I had the beef tartare and the escargot.  The beef tartare was a very generous serving, at least 3 oz.  The seasoning was mixed in already with the exception of the quail egg which was resting on top for a beautiful presentation.  It was served with toast and a small salad of frisee which I had to wrestle to fold-n-stuff into my mouth.  There's no lady here.  Vic polished off the mushroom risotto without the slightest complaint.  The escargot was the weakest part of the appetizers.  It needed salt.  And it didn't have the same ka-pow as I remember escargot to have.  \n\nFor entrees, I got the mussels marinieres.  Marina got the scallop risotto, Vic got the special filet mignon with foie gras on top.  The mussels were in a rich cream and wine sauce.  It was so delicious and the mussels were so fresh that I could smell the salty sea air and the wind blowing on my face, as though I was by the ocean.  Marina loved her risotto.  It had lobster sauce so I did not try it.  Vic's filet mignon was bathed in a beautiful sauce.  I dipped a frite in the sauce and swore that I would get it next time.  \n\nFor dessert we got the special which was this huge plate of lots of different dessert elements together, with a macaroon.  Lots of nuts, to my chagrin.  \n\nThe crowning glory, the reason this place is my special place forever and ever: when I didn't finish my mussels and asked to have the mussels and frites packed to-go, the waiter did not hear my request for the mussels to be packed.  He THREW THEM AWAY.  When he informed me of this mishap, I looked like I was about to cry.  War crimes.  Atrocity.  Violence against mussels.  But I said \"that's fine\" and tried to console myself.  A few moments later, the waiter presented me with a heavy white box and said he was so sorry for the mistake, he had the kitchen make up a NEW BATCH FOR ME TO TAKE HOME.  My heart leapt.  I was so happy.  My smile lit up the western hemisphere.  \n\nThe dinner experience went above and beyond my expectations.  It made me feel special, loved, singular, and bathed in buttery goodness.  Whenever the wind blows, I will always hear it whisper \"Bistro Central Parc Mussels.\"", "author": "Christina C."}

And no I wasn't taking forever to order.  When she brought the food, she actually dropped the plates in front of us like it was crap.  However, when she brought the check that was when the magic began.  She walks up the to table with a s**t eating grin (first time she came close to smiling all evening) and placed the check on the table like it was GOLD!!  Voila!!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-09", "description": "\"You should take me out on a nice date this weekend,\" she says over IM while we are at work on a Tuesday. Only a few months in and I'm already at the point where I need to be reminded to step it up in the romance department. Not a good sign.\n\nNever one to trust my own instincts in this area, I turn to the all-knowing Yelp search algorithms to help me recover from my extended period of coasting. I want something a little pricey so she knows I care, but not expensive enough that it looks like I'm trying too hard... $$$ sounds about right. And what about cuisine? You can't go wrong with French, they always seem to have the most seductive foods. An OpenTable reservation would probably be a good idea - nothing kills the mood faster than a 90 minute wait for a table. And obviously I need a place that's well reviewed. There's no way I'm taking a chance on that sub-four star spot tonight. With this fairly strict set of criteria, my best option seems to be a place called Bistro Central Parc. I've never even heard of the joint, but it looks like it could work.\n\nFast forward to the weekend: We arrive to find a cute, bustling bistro that has delicious aromas wafting out the door and a waiting crowd. Things are looking good so far. We are soon seated at a table right by the entrance. It's maybe the second worst seat in the house (the spot right in front of the front window is worse), but it wouldn't be too bad if there wasn't a party of 15 waiting to be seated across from us for a birthday dinner. They are all standing around their table instead of sitting, presumably in some sort of competition to see who is the going to cave and sit down first like a wimp. They stand for most of the night. They are also enthusiastically speaking only in French even though none of them seem to speak it fluently. There is a lot of repeating parts of conversations, each time spoken louder than the time before, as if the problem is that they are butchering their French too quietly.\n\nBefore I can let \"le parti des idiots\" ruin my romantic evening the server brings our food out. You know that feeling you get when you are staring so intently at your lover that the rest of the world just fades out and it's just you and them and every other person could just vanish off the face of the earth and you wouldn't even notice? Well that's how it is with me and the braised beef cheeks. Everyone raves about the filet mignon, but the braised beef is not to be missed. I'm pretty sure my girlfriend is also enjoying her meal, but you'll have to ask her. I don't even remember what she had, that's how into the braised beef I am. The portions here are surprisingly large for French food, and I'm not complaining one bit. The cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e (accents added so that you know I'm serious about cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e) is especially large, and was surely designed to be shared. Get it and do that thing where you pretend you are splitting it down the middle but you each secretly are eating from each other's half so you can eat more.\n\nBy the time we wander out of the restaurant two hours later, we are stuffed and happy. I can probably coast for another few weeks now.", "author": "Mark A."}

I was a bit nervous we'd have to wait as I've heard it gets crowded, but our table was waiting for us when we arrived. \n\nI ordered the sweetbreads appetizer and my wife the escargot. Both dishes were excellent. The texture of escargot was right-on, not chewy like they sometimes can be. These were melt-in-your-mouth snails. And the sweetbreads were just as tender. For our entrees my wife had the rossini special. The foie gras was excellent. I had the rack of lamb. It was stellar. Perfect temperature, large portion, delicious (and for around $20). All the dishes had sauce on the side in little pitchers so nothing was drenched and you could portion to taste.\n\nWe finished the meal with the cheese plate. (Four cheeses, large portions.) And a bottle of the relatively unknown Loupiac dessert wine. It was nice to find such a well-priced rarity on a dessert wine list in a corner bistro. \n\nThis restaurant is an amazing addition to the neighborhood.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-27", "description": "An undiscovered gem in the Western Addition, Bistro Central Parc turns out authentic and tasty, yet reasonably priced, French fare.\n\nUpon entering, patrons are treated to minimalist, urban chic decor--trimmings that do not detract from the artful presentation and fantastic, rich flavors of the food.  Tables are set rather close together, so don't plan on discussing anything deep with your dining partner, lest your neighbors are advised of the most intimate details of your life.  The noise level is a little high, but that's because diners are busy exclaiming how good the food is.\n\nDressed sparingly, but flavorfully, a simple mixed green salad ($7.50) highlighted the freshness of the produce.  Rich with butter and white wine, moules marinieres (steamed mussels, $12.50) were delicious, while the accompanying pommes frites (French fries) were wonderfully light and crispy.  Architecturally presented in a soaring tower, tournedos Rossini (beef pan-fried in butter served on a bed of scalloped potatoes and topped with a slice of foie gras, $19.50) was rich with slices of black truffle and finished with a deep Madeira demi-glace sauce.\n\nService was spot on.  Water glasses were always filled, dishes arrived promptly, but not so fast as to rush the diners, and more wine was never far away.\n\nWhile limited in scope, the wine list featured a sufficient number of offerings to adequately complement any of the delicious French dishes on the menu.  By the glass selections did not break the bank ($9-$10), nor did bottles did not carry a sky high markup.\n\nWith the profusion of TV chefs and mega-restaurants owned by \"personalities,\" it is gratifying to see that there are local establishments that still offer fine food at reasonable prices in The City.  Skip the Michelin-starred, over priced pilgramage to gastronomy, and save yourself the airfare to Paris; visit Bistro Central Parc for soulfully produced Gallic fare.", "author": "CJ G."}

It's a very quaint spot in a mostly residential neighborhood.\n\nI had heard good things about the French toast, so I ordered that.  In the meantime, I had coffee, which was good, but not stellar, and orange juice, which was being \"squeezed\" right in front of me and was amazing, as most freshly squeezed orange juice is.  The woman using the orange juicer was (I think) from France (?) or at least lived there for a while.  She spoke English with a slight accent and spoke French very well and mentioned being in France a couple of times.  Very friendly.\n\nThe French toast was thick-cut toast, which I think is probably harder to cook to perfection.  It was good, and thoroughly drenched (I hate dry French toast!), but a bit undercooked in the middle.  Dipped in the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche it was quite good (is anything dipped in cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche bad?), but still not on par with Baker Street Bistro, which uses thinner bread.

Let's just say French food isn't a frequent visitor to the palate of our family (primarily because none of us have been exposed to it), but it was a delight to try something new.\n\nWe made reservations for 6pm on a Friday evening and it was pretty quiet when we arrived. We were promptly acknowledged and seated when we were asked if we preferred a bottle of still or sparkling water. We asked for sparkling -- little did we realize at the time until glancing at the menu that it was a $7 decision -- no matter it was a family dinner after all.\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n- Escargots bourguignon (garlic and parsley butter $10): It was the first time for my little brother and I trying escargot. For 6 pieces, it was just okay. It honestly tasted like chewy pesto. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't too memorable either.\n- Moules marinieres (Mussels , white wine, shallots , parsley, cream. $12.50) YOU. MUST. HAVE. THESE. Honestly it was probably the highlight of the entire meal. The broth is absolutely fantastic, and as others noted, you must ask for more bread to soak up the goodness. They were a bit small, but BCP makes up in volume. I counted 27/28 shells for the order. In terms of value, the mussels couldn't be beat.\n- Pommes frites (french fries $5): The waitress recommended this to soak up the Mussel broth. Yum.\n\nENTREES:\n- Risotto aux coquilles St Jacques (Risotto, lobster sauce, scallops $22): Very generous with the scallops. Probably tied for the best scallops I've ever had in my life. Perfectly cooked. The risotto was just okay by itself, but with the scallops they were the perfect combination! I had the best entree. :)\n- Carr\u00e9 d'agneau, ratatouille (Rack of lamb with rosemary fleur de sel \n and ratatouille $24): Little brother and mom both had the rack of lamb. I guess you could use the term \"rack\"  loosely, because it was two pieces (albeit perfectly cooked medium rare) Neither of them were too fond of the ratatouille. Too much tomato in their opinion.\n- Filet mignon (green peppercorn sauce, Potato gratin $24): The older brother and dad ordered meat (of course). My dad's came cooked perfectly at medium rare. On the other hand my brother's was a bit underdone. He asked for medium rare and it was definitely too rare for him. We sent it back to have it re-fired. Unfortunately it came back still underdone. My brother was hungry, so he dug in anyways. He'd eaten about 2/3 of it when the owner came back to check on the meat. Unfortunately we showed him it was still undercooked, but it was fine since he'd eaten 2/3 of it. He took the plate without a word and walked back towards the kitchen. Uh-oh, hopefully we didn't get the cook in trouble. :( The owner brought back the thrice-fired fillet (with a new potato gratin) replated. I guess third times the charm because it was (finally) medium rare.\n\nDESSERT:\n- Creme Brulee ($7.50): Definitely in my top 3 creme brulees I've ever had and it was a perfect size for sharing.\n\nOur server was very apologetic about the filet mignon ordeal that she comped one of the orders, so it was a nice gesture.

The crowd keeps the place bustling and loud, but in some sense you feel special just eating at one of the tables.\n\nThe food is moderately priced, no entree was more than $24, the wine list shares that moderation. The service is two-notches down from fine dining, but this is a bistro - so it makes sense. \n\nIf you're looking for the classic, French dining experience with white linen-tables and 4 waiters, don't waste your time looking for a parking spot. But if you want to try a delicious risotto in lobster sauce with scallops, and enjoy a casual relaxed dinner with friends, BCP is worth your visit.", "author": "Brett W."}

The place wasn't too full, which was great because, unlike most other brunch places in this city, we could actually hear each other talk!\n\nThe orange juice was delicious, definitely freshly squeezed which made for a great start.  I ordered the croque Monsieur, which was really good.  It had just the right amount of everything. Nothing was too heavy or overwhelming. The accompanying greens were quite salty when eaten alone, but was much more balanced when eaten with the croque. I liked that the plate came with plenty of cornichons to cut the richness of the croque too.\n\nCroques were a popular dish at my table of 7. One person got the French toast, which wasn't very sweet (a good thing!) and another ordered the fris\u00e9e with poached eggs, most likely so he wouldn't feel as guilty ordering a side of potatoes. \n\nI don't drink coffee, but I hear it was quite good as one person in my party had a sip of someone else's, and then ordered her own coffee she liked it so much.\n\nThe service was good and friendly, though it dropped off a bit toward the end as the place filled up.  Prices are very reasonable.  \n\nDefinitely a cute hidden gem type of place considering it seems more like a neighborhood restaurant than a \"destination\" restaurant in the city.", "author": "Naoko M."}

This only applies to the service I experienced which started off rude and improved to mildly indifferent throughout the evening even with my trying to be friendly and thankful. I suppose I can conclude that the server was going for a stereotypical French experience:/ I've waited tables and bar tended for 7 years at fine dining restaurants (Ruth's Chris, Vic Stweart's) and was amazed at the lack of personality/professionalism from my server. Not one smile all night. Rude about the wine selection and actually tersely corrected a question I asked about a certain varietal. Opened the wine like I would expect at an Olive Garden (bottle on the table spinning it around rather than keeping it in his hand with the label stationary) which I wouldn't minded one bit had he not been so presumptuous about pointing out my lack of knowledge about wine. The food was very good. The atmosphere was also great. The hostess who seated me was sweet and set the tone for a potentially lovely evening. My only complaint is the service which unfortunately plays a huge part in the experience. Maybe he was having a bad day but that's not really a good excuse. And with 2 servers covering 10 tables I would hope that he wasn't very slammed. I won't be back and was sorry to have gone at all.", "author": "foodandwine b."}

They expect you to ask questions about the menu. They like it if you ask for a wine recommendation. They expect you to spend a couple of hours having dinner, so you will not expect your food to come out in a New York minute.\n\nIn traditional European restaurants, they have fewer seatings than in US restaurants. You can go to a movie or out to dinner, not both. The focus is on enjoying the company of your dining companions and sharing the enjoyment of the food. I'm sure they could cut a corner here and there, make more money, and we would not notice. But once one has the extra money, one cannot use it to buy more pride in what one does.\n\nSo, the food: I will update with details, but in short: each dish was very good on its own, and also fit into a well-coordinated meal. I don't know how they do that. The menu does not have Garanimals\u2122 notation, so I guess everything can go with everything.\n\nThis is a place for special occasions, first-dates that will be remembered for years, and celebrating the wonder of being with friends and lovers.", "author": "Richard H."}

Nevertheless, I adore hole-in-the-wall type of places, and I thought if the owners have the ingenuity to open a restaurant in such desolate place, then the food must be or had to be really good ... and IT WAS!\n\nUnlike the handful of so-called French restaurants I've tried in SF that serves watered down version of French cuisine, the food at BCP is authentic and delightfully tasty.  Although their menu isn't extensive, it has all of the usual favorites like Magret de canard, Carr\u00e9 d'agneau, and my personal favorite, Bouillabaisse.  \n\nUnfortunately, as most reviewers have mentioned, the service is virtually non-existent.  Although we were used to lack of service at restaurants in Europe for the past weeks, this is San Francisco after all, where patrons are expected to tip, and bringing us our food and drinks then abandoning us for the rest of the night doesn't constitute a \"bistro\" style service.

Main courses around $20.  And corkage is only $15!  That is unheard of in SF.   It's always a steal if you can get out of a nice restaurant in SF with 2 apps, 2 main courses, 2 desserts, 2 coffees, and a corkage fee for around $100 overall-- at a legit French restaurant no less. \n\nOccasionally the servers seem a bit rude, touchy, or condescending.

The food here is absolutely top notch. I went there for my birthday and was completely satisfied. And this is the only place where the owner would personally greet the customers when they come in AND leave the establishment.\n\nWe shared the beef tartar and sweet bread appetizers. The tartar was fresh tasting, although it didn't stand out. The sweet bread, on the other hand, was the best that I've ever had. It was wonderfully prepared and the sauce, oh god, the sauce!!! I'll never deglaze with wine again. It'll be nothing but port from now on. That sauce is nothing short of tears from heaven. My lady-like disposition was the only barrier that kept me from licking the plate.\n\nFor the main courses, we had the filet with foie and the rack of lamb. Both the meats were medium rare and has the wonderful sauce that I mentioned above. The foie was velvety and the meat perfectly cooked. The ratatouille that accompanied the lamb was a standout also. So buttery and delicious.\n\nFor dessert, I had the tarte tatin and my companion had the lava cake. The tart was a sort of deconstructed take on the classic dessert and I loved it. The cream was encased in this thin sugar and nuts cylinder that gave it a wonderful crush and caramel flavor. I had a bit of the chocolate cake and it was light and complex. \n\nAll in all, I had the most wonderful experience at Bistro Central Parc. Will definitely come back for more.", "author": "Alice W."}

This 9 months new French bistro located in the residential area of Hayes Valley/NOPA neighborhood is quaint, cozy and understated. Upon entrance, we were personally greeted by Jacques, who immediately led me to the open kitchen and introduced me to his Chef de Cuisine, Nicolas Jardin.\n\nThe menu is classic bistro French fare with California influences. We began our dinner with the Ris de Veau sur lit de Champignons - sweetbread with mushrooms. Sweetbread - culinary term for the thymus gland (known as throat sweetbread) and the pancreas (stomach sweetbread), of the calf and lamb. Why is it called Sweetbread, you ask? I have not a clue but I do know I enjoyed this dish very much... More so than the last time I had it at Chez Papa. Pan-seared from the outside, tender and silky on the inside. The mushroom and sauce meshed well with the sweetbreads. They did not reveal the type of sauce used for this dish, tasted similar to the Bordelaise sauce.\n\nTrio de tartar de Saumon - trio of salmon tartar, saimon roe and gravlax. Classic plating of this classic dish. What I liked about this is that you can taste the freshness of the herbs, the salmon tartar and the gravlax (old gravlax tend to have a heavy fish scent and somewhat slimy).\n\nKobe Beef Tartar -Slight tart from the mustard, fresh and perfectly seasoned to peak your appetite. Typically the texture of beef tartar is quite gooey after you mix the meat with the egg yolk (which I do not care for) but surprisingly this wasn't the case. It maintained its texture without the excessive moisture from the egg.\n\nFull review and pics, visit http://triplexbexx.wordpress.com\n\nthanks! =)", "author": "Rebecca L."}

That did not get any better with the food.\n\nThey were actually out of a dish I wanted to try but tried the beef tartare nonetheless. Good but not spectacular. Had nice presentation and good flavors.\n\nThe entrees were just not up to par. The scallop risotto with lobster sauce was pretty bland with under-cooked rice and unseasoned while the scallops were over salted.  This portion size was more for appetizer.\n\nThe duck confit with lentils also missed the mark. Duck was tender and cooked right but again no seasoning at all.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-08", "description": "I wish I could give more than 5 stars. Plenty of raving reviews have been written already so I had high expectations. And I was not disappointed. In fact, my dining experience even surpassed my expectations. I came to Bistro Central Parc for the first time on a Friday night and had a wonderful dining experience. And what I was most impressed with was the warmth and friendliness of the owner and entire staff. \n\nFOOD:\nWe ordered the filet with foie gras and scallop risotto. Both were fantastic though filet was my favorite. I think some mentioned smaller portions, and while it may seem so, the dishes are also rich and a good balance of portion to flavor & density. I was very satisfied. For dessert, creme brulee - also great.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe owner Jacques greeted us at the door, checked on us during our meal, and came by for a few words and to say good bye when we left. Another gentleman - I think Claude - asked how we enjoyed the meal, how we heard of the restaurant, chatted with us as we left and wished us a warm good bye. FANTASTIC. Throughout the meal, our server and the staff were so attentive. At one point I saw a dish being brought out with a glass cover - short ribs, I believe - and they use the glass cover as a smoker. Their server saw me looking with interest at the glass as he walked away, so he came back and showed us the glass and we caught the smoky aroma. It was a full and busy Friday night, but to have such wonderful and memorable service is something that makes this one of my new favorite restaurants.\n \nLOCATION & STUFF:\nNestled on a quiet corner in a very residential part of NOPA. Subtle exterior. Parking can be tough as mentioned. Make a reservation if you can - we were about 30 minutes late, but they were able to accommodate us. It's small inside but there are quite a few tables. It may not be quite as intimate as some other restaurants, and you may hear some of your neighbor's conversation depending on where/how you're seated, but if you want a wonderful and authentic French meal, you must try Bistro Central Parc.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-18", "description": "Came here after learning that Chapeau!, a more popular destination for Francophile gastronomes in the city, was booked for the evening.  Can't really compare the two -- I've never been to Chapeau! -- but I'm not at all disappointed I decided to try this place out.\n\nFOOD:  The food here is fantastic for the price.  We got to try the following:  \n\nPotato pancake with brie and mizuna salad ($9.50):  Surprisingly tasty alternative to the mussels, which weren't available the day we went.  Pancake itself was perfectly fried and crisp, albeit a bit dry when eaten alone.  The melted brie helped lubricate the whole shootin' match.  Mizuna was rock-star (did I just call salad greens rock-star???  I think I did ...) when paired with a deliciously light and refreshing raspberry vinaigrette.   \n\nDuck breast with mushrooms, bacon, potatoes and spinach in a cherry sauce ($19.50):  Amazing as well.  Didn't show up on the online menu.  Prepared just as requested -- medium rare.  The meat itself was a bit on the chewy side, but I don't begrudge Bistro CP for what was otherwise a very tasty protein in a wonderful sauce, with savory accompaniments.  \n\nRisotto with scallops and lobster sauce ($19.50): Not sure I tasted the lobster in the sauce, but risotto was still quite tasty -- very creamy and al dente.  Scallops prepared perfectly -- deeply seared on the outside, while just cooked through on the inside.  Not rubbery and overcooked, as scallops easily can be. \n\nRatatouille ($5):  Comes with eggplant, zucchini, red bell pepper, onions, and tomatoes.  Standard, but provided good balance to the rich entrees.  Bistro CP has affordable sides, generally speaking -- and they're cheaper than getting a second appetizer.\n\nWe were really full after the entrees, and decided not to opt for desserts.  Pretty standard fare, though -- I recall seeing profiteroles, creme brulee, poached pears, chocolate cake, and apple tarte tatin as choices.\n\nBread was served warm, but was in my opinion too hard on the outside.  I felt like a mole rat digging my way through the crust just to get to the good, soft part.\n\nSERVICE/AMBIANCE:  Service was generally good, and the owner personally checked in at our table, which was appreciated (but not really necessary).  Waiter was attentive, but not overbearing, though he could have been friendlier (though that might have been asking too much of the Frenchman).  The space is narrow, and as a result the restaurant gets a bit noisy when it is packed (which it seems to be during most of its open hours).   Some menu items were out, which is unfortunate.  Call if you really want something in particular to make sure they have it.\n\nPARKING:  Parking, as others have noted, is painful.  I parked at the garage for Lucky (2 free hours) on Fulton and would suggest others do the same.  Yes, risk the ticket or buy a pack of gum from Lucky to assuage your guilt.\n\nFINAL NOTES:  As noted above, I haven't been to Chapeau! and can't compare the quality of that experience.  But I'll offer a few quick observations, namely that Bistro CP seems to hew more closely to the tried and true, while Chapeau! offers more interesting ingredients and innovative combinations (e.g., Skate Wing, Basil Napoleon).  On the other hand, Bistro CP is cheaper -- my friend and I escaped with a bill of $80, which included the food, tax, tip, and a glass of wine.  I don't think you can get that kind of value anywhere else in the city.", "author": "Peter C."}

And I know most restaurants are practically ravaged and raped by star-crossed lovers (or anyone trying to get a lil' somethin somethin) on such a day blessed once a year by the Saint-Valentine's-Baby-Cupid-Thing(OFFICIAL NAME), but I was still very disappointed in this place despite such high reviews. \n\nNever been to a french restaurant before but wanted to, so I decided to make reservations here for 8:30PM on V-Day 2 weeks earlier after taking a look at their menu online since they appeared to have some vegetarian options. \n\nFirst off, it was extremely busy. Of course, it's V-Day, right? Ok, I understand. However, I don't understand how they thought it was ok to squeeze in SO MANY tables in such a tiny place. Romantic, intimate, dinner for 2? More like for 6 since the other couples seated to either side of you are so close, you practically end up learning everyone's social security number by the end of the night. (If only my undocumented primos were nearby!)\n\nI don't know how they \"organized\" the night, but we had to wait a while to be seated and were terribly uncomfortable by how close we were to the people already seated since there was such little room. \n\nThe menu was also not the same as the online one. We had only one option to choose from (as vegetarians), some vegetable entree that was 17$. I was very displeased when they brought out my WARM 9$ red wine AFTER getting our food because I definitely needed a buzz to be able to pretend that the pathetic serving size would fill me up. \n\nI can't speak to the authenticity of the cuisine, but on my way to the restroom, I spotted my fellow frijoleros in the kitchen, of course.

The filet mignon was superb (albeit small) and my chilean sea bass special was plate licking good! Also on the small side...\n\nThe service was a tad slow-- but we noticed its a one-man show over there. One waiter literally manhandling the whole dining room. The manager did come out and help run food but the waiter was pretty much taking care of the bulk. Expect to come and make somewhat of an evening out of the dinner, not wham-bam-thankyou-maam experience, which can be nice if you're into that sorta thing. \n\nIt is a tad more expensive for just a night out for dinner-- would recommend for a nice date or special occasion.

We were greeted warmly at the door and seated immediately.  It's a cozy little place -- tables are very close together, although that didn't bother us during our meal.  There was also some red fabric draped along the ceiling with hearts hanging from it; early Valentine's decorations perhaps?\n\nSOUP:\nI started off my meal with the soupe a l'oignon.  I'm a sucker for French onion soup, and I wasn't disappointed here.  The broth was sweet and light, and didn't hit me in the face with harsh onion flavor like other onion soups I've had.  The caramelized onions within were melt-in-your-mouth tender, and there were chunks of bread in there too.  It was topped with a very generous bubbly layer of melted Gruyere.  Mmm mmm mmm!\n\nENTREE:\nI got the moules marinieres.  The mussels were cooked perfectly!  Tender, not overly chewy.  Every bite I took, I reflexively said \"mmm...\"  And the broth was fantastic!  So creamy and rich.  I saved some bread to sop it up with at the end.  Boyfriend dipped his fries in, too.  These mussels were just shy of the best ones I've ever had (and those were in Pittsburgh, PA of all places!)\n\nBoyfriend got the steak frites for his entree.  He ate every bite (even the green beans, wow!) and definitely enjoyed it, though he later remarked that he liked the steak at Chez Papa just a little bit more.  I stole one of his fries and had a dip of the steak sauce, very tasty.\n\nDESSERT:\nCreme brulee is my weakness.  If it's on a dessert menu, I HAVE to order it.  The creme brulee here was absolutely delicious, but it was soooo huge and rich, I could barely finish half of it.  It's a good dish to share, I think.  I was hoping my boyfriend would have a few bites, but he was too occupied with his Tarte Tatin, the presentation of which was fantastic by the way, and which he, again, ate every bite of.  I felt so bad leaving behind that much deliciousness, but I just could. not. eat another bite.  Both our server and the owner came over to make sure I liked my dessert, which I think goes to show how much they care about the diner experience here.\n\nI would definitely return!", "author": "Katelyn M."}

There was a crispy skin atop. Stacked over a cauliflower cheese bake (must find out how to cook this) and a pile of sauteed spinach with a moat of the best lemon butter sauce ever. The papardelle was my favorite about my partner's dish. The sauce was thick, meaty and rich. We shared a bottle of zin and skipped on dessert.

(meaning that I didn't have to pay for my meal). \n\nThe location is very narrow with plenty of natural light streaming in from side and front windows.  If you blink, you would miss it, as it blends into the neighborhood and the front of the restaurant appears almost like a house/apt building entrance way.\n\nWe were seated immediately.  Service was friendly.  The menu consisted of select choices of  classical French Bistro fare.  In addition to the menu, there were choices of specialties and of course, a list of WINE.\n\nMembers of my party ordered the following appetizers:\nThe food was good, classical French Bistro fare.  \nbaked cod\nendive salad\nwild mushroom risotto with truffle oil\n\nOut of the 3, the mushroom risotto was my clear favorite.  Luckily, one of the diners in my group had been here before and did request the risotto be cooked more, so that it would arrive LESS al dente.  Even with that, the risotto was quite firm, but the mushrooms and the truffle oil imparted such a lovely, strong, pleasant flavor, that I have to recommend it. \n\nThe baked cod, on the other hand, was just curious. I believe that it was mixed with mashed potato (potato puree), and sprinkled with bread crumbs.  Yet, it really lacked flavor, but the  consistency made it interesting enough for me to continue trying to pull out some thought about whether I liked it or not.  In the end, I'm still left up in the air.  It felt like it was missing a key flavor ingredient.  The fishy aftertaste could have used something to offset it.\n\nThe endive salad with raspberry dressing, pear and Roquefort cheese was light and refreshing, while the cheese imparted a strong pungency.\n\nOne of the diners in my party ordered the mussels in garlic, butter and white wine sauce.  He said that it was ok.  Unfortunately, my lesson learned from other shellfish experiences is that I'm allergic.  So, I can have no shellfish.\n\nI also tried a bite of the lamb shank, which was tender and the sauce was not overpowering, but complimented the meat quite well..\n\nYet, my dish, the beef bourguignon was presented in a very different way.  It was a small portion served over potato puree.  The presentation was quite like a mini volcano with a ring of mashed potato around a mountain of stewed beef.  The flavor was slightly salty, but the beef was so tender that no knife was necessary (even though, I did use my knife before I realized this).\n\nThe highlight of the meal for me:  the profiteroles dessert and the kir royal.  I'm all about the carbs...\n\nThree mini puff pastries sandwhiching little balls of ice cream and drenched in HOT chocolatesyrup.  *sigh*...  It was just the right portion size to make me comfortably full.\n\nMy friends had ordered the vanilla creme brulee.  The caramelized sugar topping was just the right consistency to get the desired \"crackle\" sound when you tap it lightly with a spoon (yes, I listen to it) and the custard was smooth.  Overall, not bad flavor.  Not the best that I've had, but definitely not the worst.\n\nFor 4 people, the bill came to ~$150 - ish for 3 apps, 4 entrees, 2 desserts and 2 glasses of wine (incl. tip, sans tax)\n\nAll in all, a solid meal.  Not the best French meal that I've had in the city and definitely not the worst.  The owner has charm and the restaurant is a cute addition to the neighborhood.\n\nI've been to the Baker Street Bistro before and like the brunch there...maybe, I should try Bistro Central Parc for brunch next time?\n\nLuckily, parking was plentiful today, but the area is hit or miss.", "author": "Hiromi N."}

Of all the French restaurants around...I have to say that Bistro Central Parc is one of the best (and that's saying a lot...)  \n\nService: Impeccable.  From the moment I called to make a reservation (she gathered that we were having an early dinner to catch a Saturday night show and made sure that we would get outta there on time) to the minute we were greeted as we exited the restaurant.  IMPECCABLE.  Personalized service, smart, attentive and friendly.\n\nFood: Beautiful.  From gorgeous presentation to scrumptious eats...It doesn't get better than this.  We were a party of 8, so I'll summarize some of the highlights that I would definitely recommend:\n\nFrench Onion Soup: I don't usually like French Onion, but I'd definitely order this next time.  It was packed with flavor and bubbling, hot cheese over it.\n\nKobe Beef Tartare: There goes the cute lil' quail egg again...It reminded us of wrapping up little wonton dumplings when we were younger, only we were eating it raw!  The beef was wonderfully marinated.  \n\nDuck Breast: Hands down, the best dish...the duck was so tender, and everything that accompanied perfectly complemented but did not over power the meat.  If you love duck, you'll love duck at Bistro Central Parc.\n\nFilet Mignon with Foie Gras and Black Truffle:  Did somebody say Foie Gras and Black Truffle?  Mine.  Second best dish...It was a special, off the menu, so I'm all about ordering the special of the night.  Medium rare filet cooked just as I like it, foie gras perfectly fat and the sauce was just rich enough to sop up and leave nothing on my plate.  I hated it.  Can I have another that wasn't so PERFECT?\n\nAs for dessert, ORDER EVERYTHING ON THE MENU...Everything came out like a work of art.  We didn't want to ruin the beauty of all the dishes, but they were too scrumptious for our tummies to ignore.  (I will have to say, however, that whomever said the Creme Brulee was the best they've ever had didn't have anything else on the dessert menu.)  \n\nThe Poached Pear: Easily a favorite!  A cored pear drenched in chocolate sauce.  Nuff said.\n\nMolten Chocolate Cake: I've had some disappointing molten chocolate cakes, but this was the BEST EVER!  So warm, gooey and chocolatey that it made me imagine the horrid rain outside to actually be light flakes of snow.\n\nI think I've found a spot to bring visitors that will make them feel jealous that I live in such an awesome city.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

But for some reason the chef was able to retain the freshness of the sea bass without overwhelming the fish with spices to mask its taste. Don't even get me started with the trout Poisson du Jour... It was unbelievable.\nThe meat dishes I tried hear were ok, but I would definitely come back hear for the sea food concoctions.  \nOn a side note, The Foie gras salad appetizer was delicious as was the dessert.  Would definitely recommend this place to anybody.\nSeveral suggestions:\n\n1)  The place is small, so make reservations before coming here.  I was able to make reservation the same day before arriving.\n2)  Parking can be a pain since this is in a residential area with street parking.  Plan to arrive 20 minutes prior to reservation to find parking.  If all else fails, try parking at the nearby Lucky 2hour parking lot several blocks away.\n3)  The food is a bit pricey so don't be too shocked when you get the bill.  However, I think this is the few times where the taste justifies the price.", "author": "Al C."}

Right down to Franko the server who takes every table in the place solo with the greatest of ease, well that is until everyone arrives at once. Jacque, the owner and ma\u00eetre d extraordinaire, schmooze's and welcomes waiting guest as if it were his own house.\n\nThank goodness we're only a block away. Everything from the escargot to the duck confit, I have yet to find a dish that didn't make me speechless. Their specials usually include a beautiful sirloin topped with fois gras and a sauce I want to bathe in. I don't know who their saucier is, but they have a gift! \n\nThe wine list makes me so happy...not overwhelming and with some amazing French reds to go with the amazing French food.\n\nThe chef is so wonderful and excited about his food. I just wish I had paid more attention in my high school French class so I could understand him. He is the real deal and as far as I can tell, they are all family in some way. This just adds more to the romanticism to the whole restaurant.\n\nHidden away on Grove and Central, it looks like it should be someone's apartment.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-07", "description": "The rarity of rating any restaurant 5-stars must mean it's that freakin' good... and Bistro Central Parc rightly deserves this award. \n\nWe booked our reservation for a Saturday night dinner for two about a week ago on trusty Opentable (we like to rack up points for the dinner vouchers). I've always heard great things about this place and I knew that it was eventually gonna be on our list of \"places to eat while in SF\".\n\nParking was tricky. We circled about 10-15 minutes around the surrounding areas and because it was located in a, mainly residential, area, we had to park on the main artery, Masonic, running through that part of NOPA.\n\nWalking in, we expected a French bistro vibe (hence the name), but we got more of a modern San Francisco modern restaurant vibe. When we think of french bistro, the memory of eating at NYC's Pastis always comes to mind. We arrived nearly an hour early of our 830pm reservations but were promptly seated at the bar. I was disappointed, at first, but once the first course meals started arriving, I forgot all about it.\n\nThe bartender, who had an awesome French accent, was very knowledgeable in the menu items. For hour`derves, we opted for the sweetbread with wild mushrooms and french onion soup, which both were exquisite, especially the sweetbread. I'm not usually a fan of organ meats, but the blend of mushrooms and the accompanying port sauce with the actual meat made it for a delicious first course. \n\nMain dishes included the seared scallops atop lobster risotto, which, by far, was the most amazing risotto I had tasted in San Francisco. Something about the balanced creaminess with the soft texture of the scallops, my partner also was amazed at how rich and flavor full it was. My BF ordered the fish of the day: halibut with sliced potatoes. His first reaction after biting into the potatoes, \"this has got to be the best tasting potatoes I have ever eaten.\" Not that we're huge on throwing those heavy terms like \"best\" and \"ever\" around, but our experience here definitely deserved those descriptions. \n\nVolcan au chocolate was our choice of dessert. The presentation was equally as impressive as the taste. Chocolate syrup designs, filled in with color, was used to create an intricate artwork that likened to a glass mosaic that you'd find in a cathedral. The cake was soft on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside. Perfect ending to a great culinary adventure. \n\nIt came out to about $91 total for 2 appetizers, 2 mains and 1 dessert. This restaurant's food quality compares to another affordable SF French restaurant, Chapeu, and lives up to it's name of being a true bistro with excellent food and awesome service. This is not our last time that we'll eat here. HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.", "author": "Carloalexi M."}

We didn't know what to expect, but we were surprised by the Bistro.\n\nThis place is one of the neat places that seem to dot the San Fran restaurant scene.  It's a true French Bistro, our waiter was French, the cuisine was too, and it appeared that English was the minority language in the Sunday night crowd.  It was like for a few moments I had walked out of the Golden Gate Park area straight into the left bank of the Seine.\n\nThe meal was presented well, the portions were filling, but not overwhelming.  The staff was great at introducing a pair of Americains to true french food.\n\nThe restaurant itself sits at the corner of a pair of residential streets.  It's not in a street full of other restaurants, you really have to seek it out.  However that quest is well worth it for a unique french meal.", "author": "Travis N."}

ATMOSPHERE! \n\nUltra modern setting with comfortable seats, cool black concrete floors highlighted with copper trim, & pleasent flower arrangements throughout the restaurant ! TRES CHIC!  \n\nBRUNCH was wonderful when went went on a lovely sunny San Francisco Sunday.  The modern, clean lines of the bistro just shined in the brillant sunlight. It would look stunning at night!\n\nEGGS BENEDICT were the BEST, yes, you read that right, THE BEST that I have ever had in SAN FRANCISCO. \n\nThe EGGS BENEDICT veggie version was perfectly prepared eggs over a properly cooked bed of deep green spinach with a soft touch of 'sauce'. The muffins were nicely toasted. \n\nBut, back to that 'sauce' ! IT WAS PERFECT! Not too much. Just the right amount to add to the flavor and NOT sog down the muffin, nor the taste buds!  HEAVEN!!!  (see my photo)\n\nThe EGGS BENDICT with SALMON was also beautifully prepared with just the right amount of sauce, and a good helping of salmon. Throughly enjoyed. (photo, too)\n\nCROQUE MONSIEUR- finely sliced ham inbetween two slices of toasted bread covered with incredible melted cheese. OUI OUI C'EST MAGNIFIQUE!  (see my mouth-watering photo) \n\nThe POMMES FRITES were like the wonderful tasting fries found in the cafes of  PARIS! Nicely crisp and tasty! \n\nPAIN PERDU-'FRENCH TOAST'- This was a nicely prepared breakfast item, with a side of fresh fruit and creme anglais. Tasty .    \n\nThe service was a little relaxed, coffee came a tad late & refils had to be asked for repeatly, though, one would probally blame that on the sunny day.  The waiter and waitress were so charming and sweet, it would be impossible to fault them in any way.  We maxed tipped them for their service.\n\nHelpful suggestions:  (Hence the 4 stars, and not 5 stars) It would be nice to have a full dessert menu at lunch. (We were so in the mood for creme brulee. It's a French restaurant after all!)  Wine lists should always be offered to each table no matter what the time of day! The 'NO SUBTITUTIONS' of any menu items is a tad harsh!   \n\nOVERALL the BISTRO CENTRAL PARC is a charming visit to a modern PARIS cafe setting with great food , lovely staff, and the forever charming CHEF JACQUES!", "author": "Addadada A."}

Fantastic classic and affordable French food with attentive service in a casual atmosphere, and it's in my neighborhood!  Most of the staff are French, not that that's a must, but it makes the experience more authentic.  Unlike most French restaurants which are more upscale than jeans and a tshirt, this place is super casual.  In fact  two of the French waiters we saw were wearing black skull tshirts and jeans and both have half sleeve tats on their arms.  The owner is super nice and welcoming.  He walks around and converses with the patrons and makes sure they're having a good experience.\n\nThe food was awesome.  For starters, we had the Escargots Bourguignon  which were as good as I've had anywhere, and Galette De Pomme De Terre, Brie Chaud which is warm brie on a potato pancake and a mizuna arugula salad.  For the main course, I had the filet mignon with foie gras sitting atop a potato gratin with green peppercorn sauce.  Yum.  My friend had the sweet bread stuffed rabbit with poached pears and a balsamic reduction.  Yum again.  Dessert was vanilla Creme Brulee we shared.  Yum a third time.\n\nIf there's one thing I can criticize about is that we noticed when the waiters were pushing tables together to accomodate a large party, there were empty packages of sweetener and chunks of bread laying on the floor and they walked by it several times and no one bothered to sweep it up.  In fact they put a table over it and just kicked it underneath.  More attention should be paid to cleanliness IMO.", "author": "P.J. D."}

It's only been around for five years or so but it has a feel of being an old-timer in the best sense of the word.  The staff are all very friendly and accommodating without being obsequious. They always greet us as if we are there every week when in reality it's just every couple of months.  They are good about squeezing us in with last minute reservations or with none at all.  The prices are fair and the wine list is pretty good and they offer a nice range of prices.  \nThe other night we took a friend there for a farewell dinner and all three of us were quite pleased (as usual) with our meals.  The duck confit salad is delicious and so was the special calamari salad. The mussels (and go ahead and order the fries...) are always perfectly done and meaty. We usually get the traditional broth but the curry flavored option is also quite good.\nThe duck breast is perfectly cooked and they don't overdo the sweet aspect of the accompanying sauce.  My husband pretty much always gets the filet mignon and it's really one of the most delicious and dependably tender versions in the city.  I'm not a lover of beef but I always have a taste and each time it's perfection. \nFor dessert we split two: the molten cake and the cr\u00e8me brulee.  Molten cakes are starting to seem a bit clich\u00e9 to me these days but the way they do it here at Central Parc is well worth trying.  Just oozing chocolate deliciousness. The cr\u00e8me brulee was also quite good.  As usual, we left satisfied and happy.\nAs as aside, we went there last New Year's Eve because we just wanted to stay in the area and not have to drive etc.  Usually I hesitate to got restaurants on NYE (or Valentine's Day...) due to the set menus and harried service.  Here they did a great thing: they kept their regular menu but broke the evening down into seatings.  We got the 7:30 seating (at the bar - it was a last minute decision) and it was just the usual delicious food without the rush and crush feeling of NYE. Their next seating started at 9:30 and there was no rushing us out, even though we were probably just wrapping it up at 9.  Also we've sat at the bar a few times and have really enjoyed it.

I'd come back for dinner and thus would hope to enjoy the food even more, based on other reviews. Overall, my experience was fine, though not exemplary. \n\nThe sign above the door is subtle, such that I walked right past the restaurant the first time. The interior is larger than it would appear, which is helpful because table-turning isn't the owners' goal. The service is French: helpful and efficient, yet operating more leisurely than a typical American pace. Admittedly, I needed to reset my internal clock in order to stay relaxed and present. \n\nWe appreciated the bottle of water (free, choice of sparkling or still) on the table.

For starters, the waiter brought us water and bread. The bread was soft and it was just good especially when you're super hungry!

It was amazing. I tried all 4 dishes. One thing that sorta sucks with my entree was that it's a really small portion. Like the plate is big but the portion is super small. I guess I should have expected that since we are in a 4.5 star restaurant....but yeah, I wish they had a bigger portion for fat Americans like me haha! :) For dessert, we ordered chocolate mousse, apple tart, and cream puffs with ice cream! It was yummy!!!!!!!!! The chocolate mousse had like chocolate filing in them and that was like mouth watering! Apple tart was also very tasty. The cream puffs with ice cream was also amazing. My dad really enjoyed his dessert.

Parking was difficult on a Saturday 11am. When we arrived 1/2 of the place was filled. We were seated and ordered our food. Nothing on the menu, except for the duck confit was French. They had mostly breakfast menu. i order the duck confit and my man ordered the NY steak w/ egg and fries. The food took forever to arrive, at least 40 minutes. The busy got super busy and they had waiters, whom never came to check on us during the entire meal. \n\nWhen the food finally came over, my dish was very skimp, just some lentils underneath a meager piece of duck leg. The duck had absolutely zero flavor--no marinade of any sort-- and seemed to have been dunked in oil for a quick deep fry. There was no sauce on it at all. It was completely dried & unpalatable, like a piece of leather.\n\nThe cooks are 3 latino men in the kitchen and it seemed nobody in the kitchen was properly trained in French cooking. I guess that's why the menu doesn't reflect any French dishes at all.  Even my man who isn't hard to please with food, agreed it was a bad meal. I won't be returning here.

There is really no reason that you would be in this area of Nopa at night and walking by, you might miss it.  But this is by far one of the best restaurants in San Francisco.  Here are my top ten reasons why:\n\n1.  The food is consistently good everytime---the flavors, the presentation\n2.  They have a great small, reasonable wine selection- I love the Sancere Sauvignon Blanc\n3.  The staff is very attentive and charming- Jacques the owner is very friendly and the waitstaff has good recommendations\n4.  Risotto with scallops and lobster sauce- I die!\n5.  Beef tartar...

Rossini--filet mignon with seared foie gras over scalloped potatoes with a wine reduction sauce- almost better than sex (I said almost...:)\n7.  Frisee salad with lardons and a perfect soft poached egg... a whole lot of yum\n8.  Asparagus soup--very fresh with not too much cream\n9.  Creme brulee- heaven on a spoon\n10.

My girlfriend brought me here\nfor my birthday dinner and it was probably one of the best birthday dinners I've ever had- not just because of the food, which was incredible, but also because the staff is so friendly and welcoming. We told the host we had a reservation, he shook my hand and wished me a happy birthday. We were seated right away and our very friendly waiter greeted us shortly after. We ordered the baked brie and salmon duo to start, a bottle of '08 Cotes du Rhone, I chose the stuffed daurade which was one of the specials and my girlfriend ordered the steak frites. Our waiter came over with our wine and let me know that my mom had actually ordered us the bottle- she called ahead and paid for the wine for my birthday- pretty sweet of her I think. The wine was absolutely excellent! I was very impressed with the presentation of our appetizers- everything was plated carefully and beautifully! Not only did the food look good, but it tasted excellent as well! \n\nThe fish I ordered was also delicious; it was stuffed with a mix of fennel, onion and bell pepper. Alongside the fish was a frisee salad which had a light and very good dressing. I loved my dish and ate the whole thing! I'm not a huge fan of dessert and we had eaten too much to even have room to think about dessert, but when the staff turned off the lights, sang happy birthday and served us a cream puff covered in chocolate we  found some room and had a few bites. I was also given a mug which was a very nice touch and a great souvenir as this is definitely an evening I want to remember. The owner of the restaurant also wished me a happy birthday and was so very warm and friendly. I love this place and if I wasn't leaving the city soon I would try to visit more regularly! I highly recommend this place to everyone.", "author": "Natalie M."}

This place is small and cute and LOUD, but I attribute the loudness to GREAT FOOD.  \n\nI have to say that our first impressions weren't the best.  With reservations set for 6:30, we strolled in at about 6:25 and were ignored for what seemed to be ages [reality of probably 3 minutes], but turns out the host [who is also owner/chef Jacques] was busy filling wine glasses for a table of oldies.  I guess oldies always trump the young'uns.  We were then informed that no tables were available and that it would probably be 30 minutes before one freed up.  Eh, wtf?\n\nAnyhow, we decided to grab a glass of wine at the bar.  Here at the bar is where our night turned for the better and beyond.  The bartender was beautiful and had a sexy French accent, but most importantly, she was so incredibly nice that we decided to have our entire meal there.  After some previous yelping and our bartender/server's recommendations, we settled on:\n\nEscargots Bourguignon [baked snails in garlic & parsley butter]: Came out bubbling and delicious, we used our bread to sop up the remaining butter.  \n\nRisotto aux Coquilles St Jacques [seared scallops on risotto in lobster sauce]: The only food gripe of the night - scallops were extremely salty, but otherwise seared to perfection.  Risotto was al dente and lobster sauce tasty.  One of their most popular dishes.\n\nConfit de Canard, Lentilles brais\u00e9es [duck confit, braised lentils]: MUST ORDER.  The meat fell off the bone with a slight touch of my fork.  The skin was crispy and tasty a la lechon.  Shit I'm salivating.  If you like lentils, it's delicious.  I took leftovers home and actually had the lentils and sauce with some rice.  Hella bomb.\n\nCreme Brulee: This alone makes the place a must try.  It is the best you will ever have.  Ever. Ever. Ever. \n\nTab: $75 including wine for each of us. \n\nParking: Good luck.  \n\nWe tipped our server well and if you sit at the bar, you will too.  I will be back soon to try more of their menu.\n\nTake note: They recently took Beef Bourguignon off their menu.  Definite disappointment as it was what we came for but our meal did make up for that and more.", "author": "Heidi L."}

The owner REALLY wants you to like it, and most of the staff we saw appeared to actually be French.  There was a weird incident where the waiter overfilled the champagne to the point of spilling a half a glass onto the table and didn't really apologize or anything, but it didn't keep the experience from earning five stars for dinner.  I loved every dish, and the desserts I thought were fantastic.  The ambiance was lively without being too loud, and the service was attentive and genuine (minus weird champagne moment).\n\nWhen I went back for brunch I was a little disappointed.  Why pay $4 more than pork store for an eggs benedict that tastes just the same as pork store?  And without the free mimosa?  And also, not to sound TOO much like a frenchie food snob, but I was REALLY hoping that if there were ONE place that I could get a REAL cafe au lait, with the two little pots, one with coffee and one with milk that you get to mix yourself, just like in France, that it would be Bistro Central Parc, you know?  It had all the ingredients for it, dedicated French owner, outdoor breakfast tables, I mean... I was really hoping.  But alas, no.  \n\nSo overall, 5 stars for dinner and 3 stars for brunch makes this place a 4 star spot.  I'll definitely go back.  For dinner.  And maybe brunch if it's sunny.  And I'm feeling bitchy enough to ask for two separate containers for a real au lait.  Maybe.", "author": "fraggle l."}

The more local resident passerby add to the look and feel of a real nice European style restaurant. \n\nAmbiance takes advantage of this.  Nice, not too done-up, very casual, relaxed and social.

This is the quintessential homey bistro restaurant.\n\nSo the Bistro part.  Yes the food is fancy compared to the other stuff.  But that's okay.  Its ideal when you want that extra umph in your meal without putting that extra effort in your outfit.  That being said, I think they know best about the French comfort foods here.

The juice was great!  The coffee was good too! The Croque Madame was just okay. The ham used didn't seem like anything special. There was not a whole lot of cheese.

The size of the restaurant is relatively small and quaint (after all, it IS a bistro). Dinner is pretty pricey, a full meal (appetizer, entree, dessert) will rack up a bill of at least $40. Is the meal worth $40? Yes, if you order the right things.\n\nFor starters, the salmon tartare. It is visually appetizing, but the taste isn't really there. I didn't find that dish that good. Definitely wouldn't order that again. For the entree, I had the trout, it was really good, there were potatoes (I think) that were rolled up into balls and they tasted just like french fries.. It kinda makes me want to make my own french fry balls! And lastly I had the vanilla bean creme brulee. The creme brulee itself was flawless, but what really put it over the top was the temperature it was served at. For some reason, it was heated perfectly where the custard was just amazing.

Here is why:\n\n1. great vibe inside, after waiting for only a few minutes, sat at the bar immediately.  The staff said hello to us, and our waitress, I think her name was Christine, was very attentive and super super nice. Also, we loved their copper lined floors, pendant lights above the bar, and overall decor.\n\n2. Menu & wine list is awesome! We tried all of their reds by the glass and they were delicious. My favorite was the Malbec. Food was superb! We had the mushroom and goat cheese tart for app, filet mignon and cornish hen for entree (both amazing), and the chocolate volcano for dessert.  We loved every single dish....they were each a slam dunk, made to perfection.\n\n3. They take AMEX. this is huge for my husband and me. You wouldnt believe how many times we get told they do not take amex at a restaurant, super annoying!\n\n4. Head Chef came to check up on us at least 3 times...SO nice of him and just so welcoming and truly caring.\n\nAfter having 5 glasses of wine, 1 app, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert, the bill came out to $100.  Next time, we are bringing our own bottle of wine because corkage is only $15.

They have the typical \"new restaurant syndrome\" where they just don't have their act together (yet?). No quality control in food or service. They lack skills in attending to details and recovering after mistakes.\n\nThree of us walked in on a Friday at 7, and stood at the door for a long while until we were acknowledged. Someone talked to one of us, asking if we had a reservation. When we said \"No\" he was about to walk away without saying a thing. He did not seem to know any formula for guesstimating a wait time, so we told him we'd come back in an hour and 45 minutes. When we returned at that time, we waited yet another 35-40 minutes to be seated at the bar. We came in at 7 and finally sat down at 9:20-ish, without much of an apology. The man who helped us, who  seemed to own the place, did not have any mind of time management and organization. They have no door greeting system and no one to write any reservations/names of parties with rhyme or reason.\n\nI ordered the New York steak, which came out undercooked. The piece of meat was not good and the side pommes frittes  was very average. The bar tender also brought my friend the wrong dish (brought the duck confit instead of the duck breast). My other friend enjoyed her filet mignon. Their compensation was to take my friend's glass of wine off of the check.\n\nComing from the restaurant industry, I understand the stress and I am usually very flexible and accommodating when it comes to service mistakes.

Because the kitchen staff uses that bathroom too and the sign says they Must Wash Hands Before Returning To Work - but if they have only cold water running in the sink then how can they have really truly clean hands after washing?\n\nSubtotal = 15 of 15 Fussy Points on the Clean Scale.

Warm & cozy + clean & sleek at the same time.\n\nFriends from Finland Practical Scale?  3 of 5 points. \n\nQuite practical for a restaurant in SF.  Parking in that neighborhood seemed reasonable and the restaurant was easily accessible for a wheelchair or other special needs.\n\nFood?  9 of 10 points.   \n\nVery high ratings on the food.  I had the duck confit in lentils.  Now we all know that Fussy Fusspot loves his duck confit and this one was excellent.\n\nPrice/Food ratio?  4 of 5 points.\n\nRich and I shared an appetizer and each had an entree.

Just you, me, and a stack of caselaw, baby, that's all I need.\n\nOn the spur of the moment, my valentine asked if I wanted to change our dinner plans to Bistro Central Parc.  I agreed, knowing nothing about it (except that it was French food, and this girl doesn't say no to cream and butter).\n\nI love to cook (and eat), but I had never been to a non-Japanese restaurant that is as focused on presentation as much as quality of the food.   As much as the food was delicious (and it was!), the dishes arrived, looking like a work of art.  \n\nOne bottle of wine, mussels, scallops with risotto and lobster sauce (mine), and salmon over fennel and spinach with roe (his) later, we walked out, stuffed to the gills.  (The artistic presentation belied the fact that there was plenty of food on those plates.  Luckily, my valentine did not have to roll me home.)\n\nWhat I liked the most was that as much as you might expect a place like this to be dripping in pretension, the staff was incredibly friendly (although I could only catch every other word due to their charming-but-heavy French accents).   They were equally as nice to us as a group of six older adults and a couple with a(n adorable) baby.  The chef came out several times to ask how everything was, and I ran out of superlatives to describe it.\n\nPricing: entrees ranged from about $15-30, appetizers from $10-15.  For the deliciousness and presentation involved, I would say it's well worth it.  The menu changes daily, which makes me want to come back frequently and try it all...well, maybe when I'm a real grownup with a real job.", "author": "Jennie K."}

I'm still amazed that they have decided to set up in my neighborhood -- very pleased, but still, the pessimist in me is questioning how viable it is...\n\nNevertheless, we had to check it out - so we went by last night - the first Friday for the new place. The restaurant was very crowded (including - for sure - many regulars from the neighborhood.) Things were a bit chaotic -- to be expected, of course. We eventually got seated - the place feels a little bit cramped and congested - though, again, it is probably more crowded at the moment than it will be once things settle down.\n\nFood, however, was uniformly excellent. Fairly predictable French staples, but our dishes were all elegantly served and mmmm... tasty. The mussels appetizer is served in a tasty broth - very plentiful serving. (Not \"muscles\", as the menu says -- it's unfortunate that the typos on the menu dont reflect the professionalism in the place.) For entrees, we ordered the peppercorn steak and the excellent scallops/risotto, along with a nice Burgundy -- recommended as a cheap but excellent option by the waitress.\n\nNo dessert -- we were too full to even consider it, but we were served glasses of dessert wine by the server, as an apology for our earlier (short) wait... a very nice gesture. In fact, the biggest positive for me was the wonderful, warm Gallic service -- the place feels inviting and friendly. There are clearly a few glitches at the moment, but the omens are good that there's a new, excellent restaurant in the neighborhood.

The opening is this Tues. 1/2/10, but a sneak peak of the menu shows a terrific assortment of choices including; Steak Fritte, Pasta's, Fish, Fowl and Vegetarian.\n\nJacque owned and operated Baker St. Bistro in Cow Hollow for the last 20 some years.

Lucky for NOPA/Western Addition or whatever you are calling it these days, he lives in the neighborhood and opened up something closer to home.   \n\nOne of the constants w/ Baker St. Bistro - in addition to the quality of the food- was the value for the dollar.  It looks like this philosophy will be continued at Central Parc w/ the avg. main course pricing in the 'teens. Additionally, the Prix Fixe option from Baker St. will be carried over to Central Parc with a price point of under $20.00 before 7 p.m.  \n\nThis is guaranteed to be a huge hit!

I apparently was lagging - I ate there the second night they were open (Wednesday).\n\nThe food and services were great - especially considering how little time the restaurant had been open.  The decor is pleasantly clean, and is open, bright and lively.  The food derives from classical French bistro food, updated for a cleaner and more modern presentation.  I'm around the corner, and consider them a near perfect local restaurant for a nice night out and interesting food that doesn't cross the line to fussy / overdone.\n\nA particular standout was the scallop risotto with lobster broth.  The risotto was especially rich, scallops nicely browned outside and tender inside, and the lobster broth was succulent.  The presentation of the risotto (delived in a small spring pan form on the outside which was removed at the table) was both charming and functional.  We also had the frisee salad, duck confit over lentils and volcan de chocolate for dessert, all of which were very good.\n\nAs mentioned, it is a new restaurant.  Not sure what the schedule is, but they are working on the permitting and construction needed to add outdoor seating.   And in case you missed this, no one does outdoor dining as well as the French - I am confident that the outdoor area will be splendidly executed (an important criteria in my house).\n\nBeing local, I will gladly come back, and can only look forward to this new addition to the hood.", "author": "Stefan A."}

We were the first customers there and had a nice window seat.  Luckily, we got this table as it appears that most of the tables seem jammed together. We also found parking nearby, but pity those that come later as parking is really difficult around here.\n\nThey immediately brought us some french rolls that were made by Bakers of Paris.  We started off with a Frisee salad, consisting of greens, chunks of bacon, and topped with a poached egg ($11.50) and a bowl of split pea soup ($7.50).  Both were tasty, though a little on the pricey side.\n\nOur main course consisted of  lamb shank with seasoned vegetables ($19.50) and the fish of the day ($19.00) which consisted of risotto wrapped with a thin layer of calamari.  Both dishes were accompanied by some tasty sauce.  The calamari dish was a little disappointing as there was mostly risotto.  At first glance, the dish reminded me of 3 hard boiled eggs and to call it a fish of the day is misleading.\n\nOur wine consisted of an Argentine cabernet @$9/glass.  It was good wine.  For desert, we had an elegant volcan chocolate cake ($7.50) and a glass of tawny port ($7).

And I can say with no reservation, that their French toast and eggs Benedict is just wonderful. But since breakfast has been the only meal I have had there, I have to point out at least two major flaws in their kitchen that almost every San Francisco resident will share as a restaurant, no-no. \n\nTheir coffee is as watered down and disgusting as the crap I had in a Jiffy Lube waiting room. \n\nNot only is their coffee like Folgers instant, strained through at least three layers of paper towels, but they don't have cream or half and half. What is that about? A French restaurant without cream? A travesty. I have to mention as well, that my girlfriend ordered a soy latte and that was just as bad if not worse. One comes to expect that coffee can be pretty bad, especially at places like the airport or a casino lounge, but at a restaurant that claims to be French in style must have good espresso. Right? Nope. \n\nThe soy latte consisted of likely, more of the same freeze-dried coffee but finer ground to work in an espresso press. Horribly watered down and on top of that, you are given a pitcher of steamed soy milk to fill at your own leisure. I'd like it in the cup, as a complete drink, please. Thank you. I have to add that after asking about the latte and whether or not they used espresso for the drink the waitress responded with a yes they did but she could top it off with some coffee. \n\nPlease, if you must, get a coffee from any number of the wonderful coffee establishments around the area (Cafe Abir is my favorite) and forgo the abomination that is the coffee they serve at Bistro Central Parc. \n\nGo for food not the swill.", "author": "Seth F."}

The butternut squash soup was pleasant, but lacked depth; perhaps squash is out of season now. Someone had the risotto topped with scallops, which seemed pleasant enough when I tried it, but not terribly exciting. Perhaps, though, the risotto simply paled in comparison to my dish, the skate with capers, which was first-rate.\n\nIf you have a chance, you must go to Bistro Central Parc to try the skate with capers (a special that I had on a Sunday). It is a lovely combination of flavors and textures. Two skate filets drape a small mound of cooked cauliflower and asparagus. The slightly creamy sauce complements the sharp capers and is balanced nicely by the neutral cauliflower. Against these flavors, the astringent asparagus shows nicely. I also enjoyed the combination of textures: smooth, soft, slightly chewy fish, distinct cauliflower flowerets falling apart in the mouth, al dente asparagus. Perfect. \n\nFor dessert, the waiter, who had recommended the skate, also recommended a strawberry mousse. Give it a few minutes to warm up from frozen to chilled, and you'll have a nice combination of pastry, a fruity mousse, and a thin layer of jam (not too sweet), topped with mint and a slice of fresh strawberry. Well done. \n\nI look forward to trying more dishes.", "author": "Nat C."}

Not so.  I could barely taste the cheese for the mushrooms and the pastry was not so flakey or abundant as I would have desired.  \n\nAll of the components of a bouillabaisse were nice enough yet the dish was a bit boring,  It needed some zest, some assertiveness, some interest, some spicing.  \n\nWhile to me the food seemed flat others may find the obviously good ingredients in each dish more to their liking.", "author": "David D."}

The look and ambiance was of a cozy and comfortable bistro, the service was attentive and friendly, the prices were very reasonable, and best of all, my dinner companion and I agreed that this was one of the best 5 meals we'd ever had together -- what a memorable meal it was!\n\nWe started off sharing the monk fish mashed potato terrine which was delicious and generous enough for two. Followed by the incredible Scallop risotto w/lobster sauce, and a lovely creme brule as a perfect way to end the meal.  Freakishly, there were 3 other birthdays being celebrated on this night, so we told our server that there was no need to make any fuss over a 4th celebration (mine) so instead of getting the dimmed-light-dessert-presentation, we were treated to a visit and some genuine neighborhood TLC from the owner, Jacques, who graciously presented me with a souvenir coffee mug from the restaurant!  \n\nJacques, who previously owned the Baker Street Bistro, spent a few minutes sharing his story of how he decided to open up his new restaurant on this once run-down corner, to provide this neighborhood with some good french/mediterranean food in a no-fuss bistro environment. Jacques has indeed succeeded -- Bistro Central Parc is a gem that we will be visiting often!", "author": "Rosann C."}

The brie was partially melted on the pancake and set over a bed of greens.  There was a light berry sauce (either cranberry or raspberry), that was just the perfect addition to the plate.  The escargot came on a nice little plate smothered in olive oil and garlic.  They say it was a parsley butter, but it almost had a taste similar to pesto, if you can imagine that.  It was actually a really great combination of flavors.  \n\nFor entrees, we got the scallops on risotto and lobster sauce and a veal scallopini special they were serving that day.  The scallops were grilled perfectly and had just the right amount of crisp on the surface.  The risotto and lobster sauce really gave the scallops a nice balance including some added texture with the scallops.  I was a little skeptical about the veal because the presentation was so-so, and I don't know why, but the veal scallopini I've often had at other places gets cooked too dry, but Bistro Central Parc got it just right.  What really made it nice was the tuna-caper sauce, which really made the veal and sliced potatoes taste amazing.  \n\nFor dessert, we got the lava chocolate cake, which was just perfect.  I highly recommend this as well.  It's topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a thin crust of toffee.  When you cut into the cake, the inner chocolate perfectly runs out over the plate.  It wasn't too sweet, not too bitter, not too bland...just perfect.\n\nEspecially for the price, this MUST be one of the best French restaurants in the city (although I just moved here and haven't tried them all!).  The service is top notch too, so be sure to tip nicely.\n\nRecommend bringing your own wine if you'd like.  I saw multiple patrons doing this, and I wish I would have done that. Also...cab or walk to the restaurant.  Parking is hard!!", "author": "Simon B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-02-19", "description": "Love it when new restaurants pop into the neighborhood...especially this one as it has great meaning.  For years, this corner building could not sustain any business that would open up because of the infamous \"pink crack house\" next door.  Crackheads would keep breaking into whatever business would open to support their drug habit.  Well a few years back the crack house burned down and the neighborhood was finally able to take this corner of the street back.  As such, Bistro Central Parc opened about more than a few weeks ago.  My friend and I live just a block away and we finally got a chance to try it last night!\n\nFirst off, when you walk in, you get a warm greeting by people inside.  The handsome French gentleman that worked behind the counter/bar, which was later introduced to us as Julian, seated us immediately at two cozy seats at the counter and provided us with menus and a wine list.  Not shortly after, Jacques, whom I believe is the owner, also came by to meet and greet us. Both were so warm and welcoming and made us feel right at home.\n\nThe menu has a great variety of French dishes including duck confit, escargot as well as mussels.  Julian helped us pick out a couple glasses of wine, not sure why we didn't order a bottle since we knew we would get there.  Since French food is heavy, we decided to share an appetizer and main entree and also because we knew we could come back anytime.  We ordered the mussels and as suggested by Julian, the special filet of the night.  \n\nThe mussels were absolutely delicious!  The broth was buttery and light, well as light as butter can be.  The mussels were fresh and plump, not wimpy like at some restaurants. I couldn't stop dipping my bread into the broth and was tempted to pick up the bowl and drink it but of course refrained.\n\nThen the filet came right at the perfect time.  WOW.  The dish was beautiful, a perfectly cooked fliet mignon topped with frois gras and two thinly roasted pieces of sweet potato.  Underneath was a delicious gratin and to bring the whole dish together was a perfectly reduced red wine sauce.  I can not emphasize how perfectly cooked the filet was, it melted in my mouth.  Talk about umami!\n\nThen we moved on to dessert.  We both ordered a glass of dessert wine as suggested by Julian and then shared the Creme Caramel.  The wine was delicious and paired well with the Creme Caramel.  Jacques again came by to ask us how our meal was and then asked us if we lived close by, which we told him we did.  Two minutes later he reappeared with a bottle and refilled our dessert wine at no charge and told us he wanted to make sure that if he poured us more dessert wine we could make it home...haha...such a cute man!!\n\nBottom line, I can not say enough good things about this wonderful place that has been a part of saving our great neighborhood.  It was such a great experience that my friend and I have decided to make this our weekly girls dinner spot!  Thank you Jacques for making me a proud homeowner in the NOPA neighborhood!", "author": "Susan P."}

He is somewhat of a lamb expert, having had it in so many places (his favorite is La Folie). The lamb here was good, but he thought they prepared it rare, not medium-rare. The server took it back, and then came back with the same plate and proceeded to tell us that this is actually what lamb medium-rare looks like. My other half thought this lamb was prepared more rare than all other places, but he didnt think it was worth the fight so that was that.\n\nAlso, the server's arm swung the wrong way at one point toward the end of the meal and broke my wine glass, spilling the little bit of wine left in the process (no clothes were marred). They gave us complimentary dessert to compensate.\n\nIn spite of all this, we would definitely come back here again. Which speaks for something, I guess. Something good.", "author": "j d."}

It's the service that really amazes me because I cannot believe it can be this bad for a french restaurant. \n\nFirst, the server was super grumpy from the start. He had no smile and when we asked about the special. He went on for 5+ mins in mono tone. I got it, you probably have repeated it for million times but where is the professionalism? When I asked him if he has any recommendations, he gave me a stone face and simply said \"I don't have any recommendations. If you see anything you like on the menu, then order it\". Helpful and friendly! When the waiter came to replace our plates after we finished appetizer, he knocked down our bottle of wine. He apologized and promised to replace a new bottle. Never did. We had to ask them if they will do something about it 30 mins later, then the grumpy server came over and said they will not replace the bottle but will give you another free glass. Very complementary! Before we left the restaurant we saw at least two other waiters knocked down plates and broke glasses around our table. This is epic careless and rudeness rolled in one big souffle that didn't raise. Honestly, SF has gazillion great french restaurants.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-12-25", "description": "Made Xmas Eve dinner reservations for 8 pm. When we got there at 7:50pm to check in, we were early but they showed that reservations were made for 8:15pm. Not sure why the change. My family and friends were in good holiday spirits so we weren't going to let this bother us. We were warmly greeted by Jacques, the owner, and asked to be patient as the restaurant was fill and bustling. At 8:25 pm, we were seated. A really nice gesture would have been to offer us some wine or sparkling water knowing we've been waiting for 35 minutes. \n\nWhen seated, the experience improved significantly. The waiter, Frankie, was energetic, fun, and French in his charm. The 5 of us ordered the following: \n\nAppetizers:\n* Sweetbreads - my wife and daughter loved it. They were fresh, had great texture, and were married by a perfectly balanced redution sauce. 5 stars.\n* Escargot - my friend loved it and sopped up the sauce with crusty bread. 5 stars.\n* Mussels in white wine/shallot sauce - good sauce and generous amount of mussels. However, the individual mussels were very small and lacked good seafood flavor. Could benefit from finding another supplier. 3.5 stars due to great sauce.\n* Mussels in white wine/curry sauce - same as above. The delicious sauce saved the dish. 4 stars. \n\nMain Courses:\n* 3 Daily Specials: Tournedos Rossini (which is a beautiful filet mignon topped with foie gras and fried fingerling potatoes...this tower of flavor sitting on top of a potato pancake and surrounded by a peppery reduction). All 3 orders were ordered rare and they came out perfectly. This meal was divine and very rich/filling. $28 but worth it and would recommend it to carnivores. 5 stars.\n* Duck Breast: Slices of medium rare duck breast on top of seasonal vegetables in an incredible reduction sauce. My wife loved this dish and from the morsel I had, I too loved it. 5 stars. \n* Pasta of the Day: Penne Carbonara for my daughter. Straight forward. She enjoyed it but this is definitely not their forte. 3.5 stars.\n* 2008 French Meritage - $35 and delicious. Highly recommended with the meat dishes. Smooth and easy to drink. \n\nService: \n* Jacques and His Wife: Warm, charming, and affectionate. Checked in on our table several times and made our 7 y/o daughter feel very included in such a grown up dining room. We were warmly embraced as we exited the restaurant. 5 stars.\n* Frankie and Waitstaff: Warm, responsive, energetic, and genuine. They don't hover over you but check in every 10 minutes and get you whatever you need. \n* Ambience: small, intimate, high energy, and good vibe. Only concerns are how narrow the entrance is. As it was cold on Xmas Eve, many customers waited inside while their tables were being prepared. This caused congestion in the front and encroached on the guests sitting near the front. Also, the temperature in the restaurant was too warm...around 75 degrees. This was probably due to the thermostat turned too high, the large amount of customers, and the proximity of the open kitchen. \n\nOverall (even with the long wait and hot temperature): This place is a total winner and will become part of our short list of places to bring friends for an initmate, delicious, and authentic dining experience. This is comparable to Chapeau but more informal and higher energy.", "author": "H E."}

They do not have a kids menu, but they were nice enough to bring \"chicken and fries\".  The chicken was a half of a cornish game hen.  It was plenty to eat for my 5 year old and a perfect option.  For dessert we had the creme brulee and and chocolate \"volcano\".  Both disappeared in seconds.  If you like chocolate, you must get the volcano.  The menu says it needs to be ordered in advance.

Carrot and ginger go so well together. \n\nFor entrees, I decided the risotto with scallops and lobster sauce and my boyfriend ordered the duck confit. I thought the duck was OK, maybe I'm not really a duck fan. But my risotto was pretty flavorful. Sadly, I was already a bit full from my starters. SO, I had to pack it to go. \n\nThe staff + boss? was extremely friendly. I got quite surprised when they dimmed the lights in the whole restaurant just to sing happy birthday. A bit embarrassed as well, but I think it was quite an experience. Felt a bit special when most of the people in the restaurant starts singing to me as well.", "author": "Willa L."}

My taste buds for French cuisine are a little more critical as well due to the fact that I grew up in Tahiti, a French island, where French cuisine is very preponderant.\n\nI came here on a date with my husband, and we pretty much left the place agreeing that we wouldn't come back to this place again, though close in proximity.  It wasn't about the service (which was pleasant and quite attentive), it wasn't about the ambiance (which was booming, lively though a bit too loud to our liking), it was all about the food.\n\nAppetizers:\n1. We chose the classic Escargots: I don't know if it was because they ran out of parsley but the \"Cuisto\" decided to put some other herbs in there and it just didn't do it for me.  When I choose Escargots, I expect the powerful classic taste of a pleasantly roasted chewy concoction of garlic, parsley and buttered \"meat\".  My first bite left me thinking: \"What IS that taste?!\"  Not a good start.\n2. We opted for the trio of Salmon: presentation great, but taste - I could have done that out of my own kitchen.  And I really looked for the \"Third\" salmon... couldn't.  I saw the smoked salmon wrapped around the tartare, which makes two types only. \n\nEntrees:\n1. At this point, I really looked forward to the main meal to see what this place has to offer based on the great reviews by many customers.  I chose the special of the day \"Fish Trio - salmon, cod and scallop - with orange sauce and polenta.\"  I liked this one.  But there was no \"WOW factor\" taste as experienced at \"Chapeau.\"  \n2. My husband went for one of his favorite picks: \"Steak Frites\".  We were surprised how chewy the steak was, for a place such as this. The accompanying sauce, green peppercorn sauce wasn't strong enough to make him \"forget\" the texture of the meat.  \n\nDesserts:\n1. Surely desserts will make it all up!  I saw so many beautiful pics of desserts taken from this place.  I was still hopeful! First choice: \"Poire Belle Helene\" (Pear).  My husband chose this one out of curiosity.  Wow, it's pretty much a poached pear, drizzled with melted dark chocolate and voila: $7.50!\n2. Tarte Tatin (French Apple Pie): a beautiful vision, wonderfully presented.  No doubt about it.

I went here with five other friends for a farewell dinner.\n\nTheir appetizers were delicious!  I wish they were part of the main course so I could have more of them.  Lol.  We ordered the goat cheese and mushroom tart, which was my favorite, and the mussels.  I don't usually eat shellfish, but everyone was raving about it that I had to try one.  I actually enjoyed it!  It was well-cooked, savory, and doesn't have that strong \"fishy/seawater\" taste in it, which I don't like.  I found myself wiping the plate clean with a piece of bread because the sauce was too good to waste.  \n\nI ordered the lobster and scallop risotto, which a friend recommended, and it was just mouth-watering.  The serving looks small, but it was rich, and after finishing the dish, I found that it was filling--just the right amount.  I tried my friend's bouillabaisse.  It was a little too salty for me, but the meat was tender and cooked well.\n\nThe desserts were good too, but nothing out of the ordinary.  I can't remember what we ordered because they didn't really stand out compared to the appetizers and main dish.  The service was great; the owner came to check on our table, and the waitress made sure we were attended to.

Generally the food is superior, truly one of the better french restaurants in the city. The Bistro excels at their sauces. Every single sauce I have tried is a work of edible art. The Bistro also begs for me to bring out the Devils advocate. Things here are just a little bit off. The food is really excellent, but food this good cries for perfection, so when things are a touch off, it is a bigger disappointment than it should be. The Mixed green salad is purely greens, just too simple. The cornish hen was too dry, but the bacon potatoes were sublime. The Filet Mignon was a touch too peppery, but their pommes frities were perfection. The French onion soup looked to be perfection, and my companions insisted the escargots were the best. I look forward to trying the Duck and hope they bring back the Beef Bourguignon. \n\n   The room is a stark rectangle. A serious lack of ambiance. The room is loud, given the space it could never be anything other than loud. The service is slow, but the staff is all very friendly. They serve beer and wine but these menus are too limited. 4 or 5 beers a couple dozen bottles of wine. A little on the pricey side for a neighborhood bistro. \n\n  Bistro Central Parc will become a regular spot of mine.

We wanted just a nice, somewhat casual dinner, so when I saw this bistro on Yelp I thought it sounded perfect.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a destination dinner, like a special occasion if you want something fancy.  This restaurant is better for a date night or a group with friends.\n\nI like to start with something positive, so the first thing I will say is that the second you step into this Bistro you literally feel like you're in a cafe' in Paris.  It has the noises, the smell, and the quaintness of everything a bistro should be.  \n\nUnfortunately, we were not greeted warmly like the other Yelpers portrayed.  I stepped in and made eye contact with a tall guy who had a t-shirt tucked into jeans and a leather belt....he stepped away for a moment then separated 2 tables and came up to us and pointed and said \"reservations?\" I gave him my name and he pointed to one of the two tables he was giving us.  We walked over and sat down and the smile on my boyfriend's face told me I picked the right vibe for the night.\n\nThe food was great, but the lack of star is definitely due to the service.  \n\nFood:\n\nFilet with Foie Gras was great!\n\nEscargot was great, but had a weird after taste (some sort of clove or warm spice I couldn't identify)\n\nCassoulet was better then I had in Paris!  The duck confit FELL off the bone and  the sauce was a tomato-based sauce that was so rich and had such great depth I will dream about it!  The cassoulet is more of an open-faced presentation with the bean/tomato stew on the bottom and the sausages and duck laid on top.\n\nSERVICE Issues:\n\nThe attire was a little casual for my taste and did not reflect the beautiful food presentations.  (The server was in a tight graphic printed t-shirt, and jeans.) I ordered a bottle of Crozes Hermitage and was so excited that my boyfriend was going to split wine with me because he NEVER DRINKS WINE!  So I went for a Rhone because it is a good middle of the road wine and we both ordered 2 very different items.  I have had Crozes Hermitage many times before.  I excitedly order the wine and the server starts quizzing me about the grape varietal and the tasting notes.  So I told him my thoughts and he shouts \"no...that is why I asked you it's very dry\"  Ummmmm...okay....be that as it may.....there was a nicer way you could've told me that.  \"Miss were you looking for a dry Rhone?  If not, I can recommend something else\"  So now at this point I am embarrassed and he walks away and doesn't come back over till 5 minutes after our appetizers hit the table.  Normally I would just say \"forget the bottle\", but being that it was my boyfriend's birthday and I had a rude server I had to work with what I had.  He comes back and I said \"pick a Rhone less dry with a similar price\".  Server never came back and poured our wine once,which I thought was odd.  I normally tip anywhere from 20-30%...he got 18.\n\nThe server was however helpful helping us catch a taxi outside which was really nice and was very friendly when we parted.\n\nIf I was in the neighborhood I would definitely stop in again for a bite and try some other items, but would not go out of my way to come here again.", "author": "Heather D."}

It's lovely, simple, and accessible.  Escargot tasted of salt, Lamb Shank was beastly on the bone (not necessarily a bad thing) but drowned in an oily sauce.  The French Onion soup was sweet and delicate.  The Kobe tartare was great - not fantastic - but enjoyable and subtle, definitely not over-seasoned like some.  The filet mignon (in place of 86'd Steak frite) was gamey and tough to cut through.  Both dishes drowned, but I loved my green peppercorn sauce. Bistro style service, they do not bend over backwards, but rather breezy and make you feel welcome.  Affordable for level of food coming from the kitchen, and I just think we hit a bad night.", "author": "Uncle Fishbits Aeneas X."}

I'll start with my bias: We live 3 blocks away and really wanted this place to be good.  That said, it did not disappoint.  The service was top notch --more like France than SF, in terms of attention to detail and promptness.  The food was quite good.  \n\n It actually reminded me a lot of the neighborhood Bistros and Braseiries in France. The food was simple, well prepared, delicious, and surprisingly not too heavy.  I had Duck Breast with Cherry Sauce, a daily special.  My wife had the Pork Loin.  Neither of these sound like particularly light fare, but the sauces were not overwhelmingly rich, and the portions were very reasonable. \n\nAt the end of a very good meal (with Wine!) we left for just under $100 --and feeling pleasantly full but not bloated.", "author": "E L."}

The service was attentive without being overly so, the food was off the charts amazing and the prices were extremely reasonable (not that I paid for it on my birthday!).  \n\nThe owner visited our table several times and kissed us all on the cheeks as only the French can do.  He even gave me a mug as a birthday gift!  \n\nI had the hangar steak with a Roquefort sauce and pomme frites.  Most restaurants are uncomfortable with the level of rare I want to see on my steak.  Not this place.  When I ordered, they asked me if I wanted it \"blue\" and I said \"hell yes\".  It was more like purple which is even better in my opinion.  Who needs steak tartare as an appetizer when you can have your whole entree that way????\n\nI must admit I'm not really sure what anyone else at the table had, as I was so totally engrossed in my meal.  I do recall hearing lots of happy noises from around the table, so that must be a good sign.  \n\nI also had a cup of the French onion soup as a starter.  Need I even say how exquisite that was?  The crust of cheese on top made me want to weep.  Long live the French and their devotion to cheese.  \n\nFor dessert, the chocolate volcano cake.  The words, they fail me.  The chef had decorated the plate so that it looked like stained glass.  I literally stared at it for a few moments before digging in because it was so pretty.  It tasted even better than the pretty picture it made.\n\nThe whole experience was so amazing we went back for brunch the next day.  My eggs Benedict put all others to shame.  The fresh orange juicy was wonderful also.  \n\nAll in all, I wish Yelp offered more stars because this place was off the charts.  We will be back just as soon as possible!", "author": "Tara T."}

I couldn't find a fault with any of the dishes. maybe instead of ordering fries on the side they could include a toast with the mussels or two and raise the price a few dollars to compensate. in the end we left happy and full. price for 4 with 2 glasses of wine and one dessert was about $190 including tip. we definitely ordered everything so I'm sure to eat there again I wouldn't be as extravagant. but I will be coming back!!!", "author": "Susan Z."}

It felt a bit like we were on a double date.  ;)  That said, it's not uncommon for small restaurants in the city to squeeze every possible table in.  \n\nThe frisee salad with lardons and poached egg was scrumptious, as was the potato pancake with the warm brie over mizuna salad.  The only thing that could have made the second entree better would have been a touch of salt on the potato pancake, which was slightly underseasoned and bland.  The lamb shank I had as an entree was incredible.  The meat absolutely melted off the bone and the sauce had an incredible depth of flavor.

We started with the galette de pomme de terre and brie chaud (brie on a potato pancake on top of greens). This dish wasn't my favorite, but it had a lot of potential. I'm a huge brie fan, so I loved the taste of the brie on the potato pancake. I do think that the texture of the pancake wasn't right over the greens underneath. If both were separate (brie on pancake, and greens with dressing), they would have been two perfect appetizers. We also had the escargot bourguignon with garlic and parsley butter. This was a nice dish, but extremeley hot. After that, we had the bouillabaisse and the risotto with lobster sauce and pan seared scallops. The bouillabaisse was  mediocre and the broth didn't have that much flavor. To be honest, I've had much better. What stole the show was the risotto. The seared scallops were to die for, and the risotto was thick and creamy with the most outstanding flavor. We both loved it!

I REALLY wanted to like it, especially because I was the one who chose this spot for Sunday brunch for our party of four after reading the rave Yelp reviews, but it failed to deliver.  The escargot was decent, BF's salmon benedict lackluster, BF's BFF seemed to enjoy the duck confit, and my $17.50 risotto with scallops and lobster sauce missed the mark.  At that price point and at a bistro, I expected quality (if not quantity) and got nothing more than a small bowl of dry, insipid risotto rice flecked with little scallops in a bland sauce.  The best part of the meal was the wine and mimosas, but how hard is it to get that right?  Needless to say, with so many other options in the city, this visit was a one-time deal.", "author": "Liz N."}

But that would be selfish.  The food is excellent.  I had rack of lamb, my companion had risotto, and we split a scrumptious tarte tatin.  The prices are reasonable--not cheap, but good for the quality of the food.  Portions are moderate, so this is not for someone who is expecting Olive-Garden-style quantities.  Service was very pleasant.  My only complaint is the noise level.  The dining room was no more than half-full the night we went, and it was already a bit louder than I like it.  There is nothing to soften the acoustics so I expect that it would be REALLY loud when all tables are full.  \nIt would be a great location for sidewalk tables in warmer weather, assuming the City would allow this.", "author": "Martha B."}

I have to say the mussels may be the most tender and flavorful mussels I've ever had. Definitely dip your bread in the white wine broth and sop it up. So good!  We followed that with the Risotto aux Coquilles St Jacque which was excellent and  ended our meal with their vanilla cr\u00e8me brulee which is hands down the best cr\u00e8me brulee I've ever had.

We finally asked her again and after 45 minutes, we received our first appetizers.  \n\nOur waitress then came to us and asked if we wanted dessert and that was when we asked for the entrees we had ordered an hour ago!  Apparantly she had forgotten those too.  What's worse is that she kept blaming the kitchen, but when we finally got our bill, (nothing was comped), we noticed she had charged us for things we never ordered and food we had ordered wasn't on our bill!

From the warm, rustic decor to the French staff. An owner that personally greets you during your meal. Impressive menu. You wouldn't know this used to be a crack house!\n\nJust got back from a little birthday celebration dinner. The food was fantastic:\n\nApp -\nEndive Salad - creative use of endives with really vibrant Roquefort cheese, pears and walnuts\nTrio of Salmon tartare - deliciously seasoned salmon tartar, with roe wrapped in salmon\n\nEntree -\nI had the Filet Mignon, with Potato Gratin. I ordered it Medium Rare, because I love my steak moo'ing. It was cooked exactly how I wanted it. Clearly still a bit on the rare side but really tender to chew. At first I thought it was not a huge portion, but actually, even after giving away several bites of my steak, it was plenty.\n\nVeal stew - a little on the small side and pretty good if you enjoy veal. Comes with a yummy risotto\n\nI didn't try the lobster sauce and scallop risotto, but I was told it was very good.\n\nRack of lamb, done medium. It was still pink and had wonderful juicy texture. The presentation was phenomenal.\n\nDuck confit - a good size piece of duck, I thought it could be a little moister, but pretty tasty nonetheless.\n\nFor dessert, we had mentioned it was a birthday celebration. We thought it was taking a little longer than usual, but lo and behold, the lights are dimmed. Everyone in the restaurant is kind of confused, but then the staff bellows their rendition of Happy Birthday and we're presented with our 2 sweet treats with candle in tow.\n\nThe special - Strawberries with balsamic vinegar, cracked black pepper and ice cream. We all sort of went \"Huh?\" when our waitress told us about it, but given our curiosity we ordered it anyway and we were all very pleasantly surprised with this. The strawberries are a bit warm and when you taste a bit of pepper, it adds just a little spiciness to your bite.\n\nProfiteroles - with ice cream. Sweet and yummy.\n\nAnd while enjoying the wonderful dessert, the owner even came by with a little paper bag. It contained a little souvenir for my walk home.\n\nAll in all, for the quality of food, service and atmosphere. Bistro Central Parc is fairly priced and very welcoming. It adds some wonderful French personality to the neighborhood.", "author": "Karen J."}

My gamble payed off in a major way and we've been back four times since then. I even took my parents who quickly co-opted it and now pop into the City to eat without inviting me. \n\nI have gotten filet mignon with fois gras with a port reduction a number of times. It's so reasonably priced, plated well and delicious. The mussels are fresh and the fries have integrity. The baked brie croquette on top of a mizuna base is nice precursor to any meal. I had the scallop risotto with lobster sauce last time and it was decadent. We even caught brunch here after the Nike Marathon and I had a croque madame with a poached egg that truly was transcendent. The rest of the breakfast menu is executed very well making it worth paying a couple bucks more.\n\nOne of the true strengths of this fine neighborhood restaurant is the warm and welcoming owner. He has always greeted our table - treating us with grace - exuding his appreciation for patrons of his establishment. Bistro Central Parc truly made my dad's 70th birthday memorable by dimming the lights, singing happy birthday, and giving him a logo mug. I truly love the place and hope it does well in the future.

Zazie...we'll see you soon :)\nWe ended up sitting at the bar because they were clearly busy and we didn't want to feel rushed.  We carried in nice wines, but were sufficiently impressed with their list and prices.  Maybe next time we won't bring our own.\nWe had a plan for items on the menu to go with the Bollinger Champagne NV, Clos Pegas Chardonnay and Black Tears Malbec.  We made it 2/3 of the way before we had to stop.  Black Tears will have to wait.\nWe started with salmon three ways: smoked, grave lox, roe.  Chopped smoked salmon with herbs, egg, cucumbers, creme fraiche, wrapped in a ribbon of grave lox and dotted with large, salty roe.  Surprising presentation that worked very well!  Sauteed sweetbreads and mushrooms with a veal demi sauce were cooked perfectly and beat Chapeau in texture and flavor.  Pork cheeks au jus with caramelized onions on a bed of pomme Savoyard (or something similar) was a delicacy.  I wish more restauranteurs and Chefs took a chance on the cheeks!  Very nicely done and perfect with the Champagne & Chardonnay by the way.\nWe planned to have duck after the Coquille St. Jacques on risotto with lobster broth, but saw no point.  We were very satisfied! The lobster broth lingered so nicely, we didn't want to end uncomfortably satiated and eating the duck just because we had a plan.\nWe will be back!", "author": "Sean M."}

When I made the reservation, I said it was a special occasion, and that we would like a good table.  When we arrived, at around 5, we were shown to a table that was okay, and told there were no others, despite the fact that there were few diners there. Okay, we accepted that, no worries, those tables may have been reserved ahead too. We then told our waitperson that it was our wedding day and the four of us were celebrating.  No enthusiasm, just a \"that's nice,\" which felt a little puncturing, but we went on to order our meals without fanfare.  One of our meals was underdone, and the waitperson seemed annoyed to have to do anything about it.  We ordered desserts and wines, and spent well over $200----tipping nicely despite.  And yet, nothing much about this experience felt very special.  Perhaps one has to be young and hip to get special attention here, and we are middle aged.  One person in our party is from Montreal, knows fine French dining, and is very open-minded; but he said that I probably should have chosen another place that understands what it means to celebrate a festivity.  In reviewing the overall experience, we all agreed that none of us would go back.  I did catch a glimpse of the owner coming in to talk to some other tables, and he seems like a very personable man.

Started with foie gras two ways, which could have been perfect if the cold p\u00e2t\u00e9 had been more flavorful. The risotto was creamy but not heavy, with perfectly cooked scallops. The white wine was crisp and perfectly paired. I also tried my boyfriend's peppercorn filet mignon, which was excellent as well and well balanced with a smaller serving of potato gratin.

My gf had the bouillabaisse, and while it was a little salty for her taste, to me it was great. I would have been happy leaving there, but then I saw the deserts go to other tables. The presentation on them looked great that we couldn't resist. Let me digress for a second on that note - EVERYTHING was presented thoughtfully and beautifully. They really take the time to make your food not only tasty, but also beautiful - magnificent presentation all around.

Am I ever glad we decided to stop in for dinner last week...   First off, I was extremely impressed that they held our reservations despite being 30 minutes late. When we walked in, there were people waiting and one empty table tucked away which they immediately seated us at...  Ammmmmmazing! The ambiance is somewhat bright during the day, considering there are plenty of windows and sits on a corner location tucked in a little neighborhood, but when the sun comes down the candlelit restaurant transforms in to a little romantic getaway...  Parking is a hassle, but seriously, so worth the trouble.  The servers were all French and friendly (rare to my knowledge), but the food... Wow... The food was absolutely incredible! This has to be one of the best dining experiences ever, ever!  \n\nStarted off with the smoked salmon and the sweetbread appetizers...  One word, wow!  I was so impressed and we've only started on the appetizers...  I was already feelin' this place and scoping what I would try on the next visit.  The menu looks full of amazing dishes which I have every intention of trying all of them!  For the main course, it was the filet mignon with seared foie gras.  Again, amazing... fantastic and just plain delicious.  The filet was prepared just right and the foie gras on top was a fantastic addition, reminds me of the kobe and foie gras @ katsuya.   \n\nThis little stop is going to definitely be a favorite!

I really wanted to love this place; we live in the neighborhood and have been pining for a local french restaurant ever since the Metro bistro on Divis changed hands a few years ago.\n\nMy main grouse is that the entrees, although very tasty and artfully presented, often do not include both vegetables and a starch, and so the entree to me ends up feeling unbalanced.  For instance, the rack of lamb is wonderfully flavored and comes with an excellent ratatouille. But no rice or starch to complement it. Or if you get the steak frites, it is just that: steak, and frites. No green beans or other veggie with it.\n\nIt does all seem expertly cooked, with modern presentation (i.e. carefully assembled tower of food on a large white plate with sauce artistically drizzled about).  The sorbet is house-made (I think) and delicious.\n\nAnd I agree that the staff and owner are wonderfully friendly. I especially admire their friendliness to small children; we've seen babies and toddlers being very graciously accomodated.\n\nBut for the price, I would rather eat at RNM, where the entrees seem a bit more balanced to me, and where there is also a prix-fixe option.\n\nAll in all this is a good addition to the neighborhood.

Oh, the service was excellent as well and the owner made his way around the restaurant which made the experience very personal.  You must go here!", "author": "Ryan T."}

The coffee was sublime and my omelette was so good, I felt like I was in France. Wow! I can't wait to go there for dinner.  Jaques the owner introduced himself and was very friendly. I think we will become regulars.", "author": "C W."}

My husband loves foie gras, so he ordered the filet mignon w/ the foie gras.  It was amazing!  The sauce was very delicious!  I had the scallop risotto w/ lobster sauce and the scallop was cooked perfectly!  We also ordered the kobe beef tartar for appetizer which was also really good.  Everything tasted great!  The price was decent.", "author": "Karen V."}

But once inside I felt that sophisticated family feel of a European restaurant.  Not stuffy.  Great food, a little loud.  It's a nice restaurant where you feel comfortable and can be yourself.  I therefore say, it's great to go with friends, but also on a date where you don't have to feel overwhelmed by the insipid silence, and get to know each other.", "author": "Rosemary G."}

It is so rare to have the owner greet you and ask if you have enjoyed your meal.  Kudos to Jacques, the food is great and he seems to actually care if you've had a good time.  I wish more restaurateurs were like him...", "author": "Fs A."}

The owner kept apologizing, but didn't offer us anything while we waited.  The service was good and the food excellent for the most part, except for the NY steak which was inedible and w/o the sauce as mentioned on the menu  (and got brought home for the dog).   Prices are very reasonable given the quality.  I hope they can iron out some of these snafus--if they do it will be a 5-star place!", "author": "h f."}

Rack of lamb - savory, perfectly done, excellent. On another occasion (tonight) had the fillet in morel sauce. I was very happy, sauce was spectacular. All in all great food, reasonably priced and the friendly staff and owner (Jacques) make you feel very welcomed. Euro paced dining - some people may think it is too slow -but you are given space to eat, talk and chill.", "author": "E. Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-07", "description": "The food and the atmosphere are fantastic here.  Went with a party of six and we had a nice, leisurely dinner, and felt neither rushed nor neglected, something that's rare Stateside.  The food's reasonably priced compared to French bistros elsewhere in the city, with appetizers in the $8-$10 range and entrees for $18 (chicken) - $22 (lamb), and it's wonderful, classic French country food like Julia and Jacques used to make on your TV: boeuf bourguignon, confit de canard, tarte tatin.  The risotto au coquilles st. jacques is marvelous, and I usually give scallops a wide berth.  No longer--I'm a convert!  I'd love to have Bistro Central Parc in my neighborhood, but I'll have to settle for taking Muni there as frequently as possible.", "author": "V O."}

The food is superb french bistro food with simple ingrdients well combined. Staff and atmosphere are welcoming and very friendly. My wife and I love going here for late dinner and a glass of wine solo, and hitting the place for brunch with our 17 month old on the weekends. Dining at non-peak times is definitely kid friendly, and I believe there is even an early bird dinner option mon-thur. Definite thumbs up for this place.", "author": "Justin T."}

In a nutshell, this place is better than most restaurants we have dined in IN FRANCE!  Really not kidding about this and we have travelled allot in France recently.  The escargot is amazing, not rubbery and the sauce was divine! I am coming back to try other things on the menu! The place is clean, trendy and casual.", "author": "Peggy M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-10", "description": "Friday, tired and bored at the office I happened to YELP for a french restaurant and saw the reviews with as many stars as my favorite french in SF. So decided to give it a try and got a reservation for 7pm.  Standing outside with my cousin debating about first going to bar because it was early for our reservation (fyi no bars around there and they only serve beer and wine), JACQUES came out to chat and greet us and because of his charming personality we decided to just go in early.  We sat at the bar instead of a table and were served by a really sweet and charming french student named Aurelie.  She was so entertaining, and funny, and gave us good food/wine advice.  Not just that, the rest of the staff acknowledged us too and said hi and asked how we were.  it's not just the food but it's the service that makes the evening, right?  Well they made my evening.  We shared the escargot which was ok.  I had the frisee salad and the filet - which was so buttery and the pepper sauce was so yummy.  I will definitely have it again.  Although part of me regrets not having the special tournedos with the fois gras on top.  I love fois gras.  My cousin had the brie potato thing (pardon me, I've just had a bottle of wine and I\"m deliriously happy full) which he devoured and one of the specials: a steak with roquefort sauce.   He barely talked to me while he was eating I just heard, mmm.  One critique - the chocolate dessert needs the smallest scoop of vanilla ice cream for balance.  It's a very laid back relaxing place and now on my list of local favorite restaurants.  I'll definitely tell my friends, and be back very soon maybe with an after work group of co-workers.   Thanks, Jacques!  Thanks, Aurelie!    See you soon and thank you for a really great dinner.", "author": "marie s."}
