I'm not here to discuss the philosophy behind it.  Where I'm from, CM has a de facto leadership, rides a few miles on a set course with regular stops that last for 1/2 hour or more to drink alcohol, too many like to race rather than ride and riders gets harassed by the cops.  I quit attending for the last few months since the altercations with the cops would just kill the mood for the ride.  But I was in town in SF for Halloween weekend and figured that I had to participate since this is where CM originated at.   So how was it?  To put it mildly, it didn't suck.  In fact it was one of the best events I've been to in quite a while.  \n\nOn every last Friday of the month, cyclists from around town gathers around 530pm at the Justin Herman Plaza and ride starts around 6.  Occupy SF was in the same area so it was interesting to see that there too.  Here at CM SF, there is no leadership.  It becomes a force of nature once the ride starts going.  Cars are trying to get through but they are prevented by other massers that cork the intersections to protect everyone else on the ride.  I was actually surprised that the the police provided some motorcycle escorts for the ride instead of cracking down on cyclists.  We filled the streets with cyclists and rode for miles but we didn't stop.  People were wearing all sorts of costumes.  And the bikes with sound systems...they just keep one upping each other in noise level and the bass was pulsating through the crowd.  A girl (not from SF also visiting from TX) who I was riding along with said that participating in CM made her entire trip to SF worthwhile.  The whole experience was A-MAZ-ING and I would attend CM in SF again.", "author": "John F."}

One that leaves a very unpleasant, bitter aftertaste....\n\nGot stuck in the middle of this group for the first time on my way home from a dance class - it was a lovely combo of critical mass riders and traffic from the ballpark.  Fortunately, I wasn't in a big rush to get anywhere.\n\nLet me first say that I don't drive around the city very often - I take BART to work and walk to as many places as I can (and there is no way I'd take my life into my hands by biking around downtown SF - I've seen too many accidents to even consider that one.) But, I DO need to drive my very fuel efficient car on some occasions!\n\nI truly don't understand how this group expects to gain ANY sympathy for their \"cause\" by pissing off drivers, pedestrians, and the riders who get stuck on buses.   I really think its less of a true cause for most of these people and more of an opportunity to have a few moments of power that they normally don't have when they are riding around the city.  The smugness and sense of superiority that this group emits is also something that will also not gain them any support.  It just pisses people off and probably makes them want to drive more, not less.  How many of those drivers, after being delayed and putting up with the verbal abuse from some riders, do you think went home and said, \"gee, I think I'll start riding my bike more often\"?  I'm guessing none.... \n\nThey need to realize that biking is not an option for everyone. And while we should all be conscious about using alternate forms of transportation whenever possible, buying fuel-efficient cars when we can, there are times when we just have to be in our cars.  California does not have a public transportation system that is widespread or efficient enough for people to substantially reduce their reliance on their cars.  San Francisco is better than some cities, but definitely does not deserve any awards for its limited, often delayed, public transportation system.  The city could look to better examples, such as Chicago's system, to improve people's ability to get around town and between major metropolitan areas.  In order to get more cars off the city streets, perhaps CM could better use their time and resources by advocating for better public transportation options within the city.", "author": "Kimberly T."}

I saw one motorist who was trying to drive down the street get circled by a bunch of cyclists who refused to move and kept the driver from being able to get wherever he was trying to go. To make things worse, the driver honked and cyclists started kicking his car and slapping and punching his windows with great force. I thought, okay, there's a few bad apples in the bunch. I kept riding and tried to have a good time. A lot of the cyclists were in good spirits and I actually met some really nice people, until 20 minutes later. I saw the same incident happen. A car was circled at an intersection by 15+ angry cyclists. The lady driving the car had a child in the front seat and 2 in the back. She rolled down the window and yelled to get out of the way and the cyclists surrounding her car started yelling obscenities at her and kicking and hitting her windows. The children in the car looked terrified and the small boy in the backseat started crying his eyes out. I was happy to see a couple other cyclists come up, including myself, and start yelling at the cyclists who were surrounding her car. Myself and 3 or 4 other cyclists physically had to push the aggressive cyclists out of the way and clear a path for her. That was the final straw for me. I hopped on my bike and went home.\n\nI thought I was going to be attending a fun bike rally and instead I was witnessing uncontrolled chaos. I honestly wouldn't have minded if the drivers being harassed ended up hitting the gas pedal and running over the aggressive cyclists. What assholes. I was ashamed to be part of the spectacle.\n\nSeriously, there should be 1 police officer assigned to critical mass for every 50 cyclists. They should be armed with shotguns that are loaded with bean bag rounds. When cyclists get out of line in the way I witnessed they should be shot with a bean bag round, sprayed with mace, locked up with zip ties, and get hauled off to jail.\n\nI know the percentage of bad seeds and assholes compared to the people trying to have a fun time is small but come on. If there isn't any regulation or repercussions for cyclists who are being a public nuisance then the city should step up and stop this event.\n\nMy writing of this review was sparked by a video I saw of a motorist running over several people at critical mass who were threatening him or her.

Everytime.  And try as hard as we can to make critical mass into more of a once monthly rolling street-party.  I mean, I'm so ALL FOR the political goals of critical mass, but if we're just a little more whimsical, and fun, and funny, and maybe a little less like, on edge politically, more people will get the message:  Get out of your car and have fun.  Critical mass is part of what makes San Francisco, well, San Francisco.  But I feel it should stay, well, fun, like, San Francisco.\n\nAlas, I'm super doubtful.  I mean, no wonder critical mass isn't fun anymore.  With oil running out and gas going up and no end in sight and we're all fucked and there's this coming plague and maybe another war and we're (told to be) scared that Arabs are going to blow up the Golden Gate Bridge I guess maybe we're all a little on edge, you know?  Even the cyclists.  Actually, ESPECIALLY the cyclists.\n\nAll I'm saying is preach a little tolerance on both ends, the jackasses that come to critical mass with bikes and act too intense and the jackasses in the cars that freak out and get too upset, and maybe we'lll all be able to reflect on the absurdity of the situation of how we're yelling at each other at Broadway and Columbus and realize how fucked we truly are before it's too late.\n\nUPDATE; It's getting funner.  There is less negativity in the air.  Hope and Change, man!  Critical Mass, 2009!", "author": "Ben V."}

If you wish to use the road, follow the rules like everyone else is supposed to, apparently stop & yield actually mean Stop & Yield? \n4.

Get enough people together and you can basically do anything. That's about as close as you'll probably ever get to a \"point\" of critical mass. \n\nIs it supposed to be some kind of protest? No. \nIs it a race? No.\nIs it supposed to \"raise awareness of bicyclists and alternative transportation\"? No. \n\nIt's basically just another version of a \"flash mob\". A whole lot of people together, coordinated, doing the same thing at the same time. In this case it's taking over the streets for one evening, once a month. When you're riding with the mob, it's hilariously fun. I can easily see that if you're on the other side of things, perhaps late for an appointment, trying to get up Market Street on a Friday evening, it would be infuriating. All you can do at that point is just sit, wait, and enjoy the show. The people who get visibly angry, start yelling, and basically trying to take on the whole group are really just providing more entertainment. \n\nJust relax. Or don't.", "author": "Jeret L."}

With the disaster in the Gulf of Mexico and all the other toxic effects of fossil fuel addiction, isn't it time to move on and do something that isn't destroying nature and our only home planet.\n\nThis is a peaceful light-hearted demonstration of how much more fun it is to ride a bike than to sit in a polluting, toxic automobile. If you're afraid of getting caught in your car and delayed 15 or 20 minutes, leave earlier or take public transport on the last Friday of the month. You can always check the critical mass website and see if the route is posted, so that you can avoid having your commute delayed. Better yet, how about leaving the car at home one day of the month and enjoy an evening of exercise and open-air relaxation on a bicycle? You won't regret it. It's a welcoming crowd and too much fun to be missed! \n\nPeace!", "author": "Scotia W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-07-24", "description": "Activists for all variety of causes can learn something from Critical Mass: If the tactics of your activism do more to harm your cause than to help it, you probably need to find new tactics. \n\nTo some this concept will appear excruciatingly obvious, but Critical Massers seem either oblivious or indifferent to their ineffectiveness in enacting social or political change. Maybe that's because Critical Mass is no longer about policy or environment or safety, but rather just about having a fun time in the city, everyone else be damned. The rest of society, it is implied, can just sit there and wait until the Masser's monthly exercise in arrogant self-indulgence is over. Literally just sit there.... and wait. \n\nCritical Massers may catch the hypocrisy in staging a monthly event that undeniably increases the output of smog and greenhouse gasses. They may even grasp the fact that their Friday rides really don't have any impact on transportation policy. But one has to wonder, do they understand the influence they have on their captive audience? Do they realize that when a parent is late picking up their kid, or a bus rider has to stand on an overloaded 38 Geary for an extra 20-plus minutes, that those individuals are not endeared to the cyclists' cause? In fact, I'd wager most people caught in a Critical Mass blockade, be they walker, bus-rider or driver, would actually feel less sympathetic, not more, to the plight of bicyclists in the city. If somehow the Massers don't see this, we should inform them immediately. We can only assume they'd see the error of their ways and adopt new, effective tactics to achieve their aims... whatever those aims may be.  It would take a 'special' kind of dedication to continue participating in a form of protest that you full well know is harming the very cause you actively support.\n\nJust to belabor the point - when you get on your bike and partake in Critical Mass, you can't know the inconvenience you are thrusting upon the hundreds of thousands of people who are just trying to go about their everyday lives. You don't know which mothers are trying to get home to take care of their sick kid, or which commuter's are rushing to visit a dying relative in the hospital. And what really drives my antagonism is that you, Critical Masser, just don't seem to care. About anything but your fun ride.", "author": "Phil D."}

I have to say with all the criticism and harp I've heard about this gathering, it is truly an experience to be had. And to top it off, some of San Francisco's hottest, finest and coolest bikers converge then ride for 3+ hours of exhilarating biker fun.\n\nCan't speak for impatient, ignorant car drivers that speed around in 2-3 ton junk boxes but I do know biking is in. (So glad I don't have to pay for gasoline). If you haven't tried CM, you should. It is safe at your own pace and thrilling at the lead. You can quit when you want or stay til the end. \n\nOne last thing, this gathering IS about awareness and fun and bringing a sense of understanding and obedience on the road.
