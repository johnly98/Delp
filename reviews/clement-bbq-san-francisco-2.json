The restaurant is undergoing slow repairs from a fire 2 years ago.\n\nWhy go here over others.  Well its sister restaurant Xiao  Long Bao just two doors down to the west is now more of the fresh noodle and dumpling kitchen while Clement Restaurant has transformed into the sweet pastry and exotic pastry bakery. You will see employees running back and forth between the two.\n\nIf there is a reason to come here beyond anything else it is for the curry bun.  Tired of the traditional pork bun or chicken bun?

Yes, in the past I've tried their cooked food, and while convenient, the grease was just too nasty. Last night, I was in a hurry and decided to pick up some BBQ pork (char sui) because I was pressed for time and this place was near my car and I figured what could go wrong with char sui? I was badly mistaken. \nUpon opening up the plastic box, I noticed that the char sui pieces were 70% fat. There were slivers of meat attached, but not much. As I was making char sui ramen, it was too late to change things so I made due with what I had. \nUpon eating a piece, my son immediately sensed that it tasted funny. He did finish two pieces before he asked to be excused. One guess as to where he went. My wife immediately tried a piece and concurred that it was probably spoiled or left out too long. I had them fish out the pieces and throw them away, and then preceded to throw out the rest of the box. \nMaybe this was an isolated incident, but I would just say that you can pretty much tell what type of place this is when you walk in and smell that smell. \nYou've been warned.", "author": "Dom L."}

I've never had bbq pork like that before. Really liked the sweet & savory combination. Did I mention how big the bun was?\n\nThe coconut bun was also excellent. Like half a small loaf pan sized with fluffy bread and an almond (?) coconut filling. I love coconut so it was kinda a given I would like this bun but I didn't think I would like it this much!\n\nEgg custard was okay. I'm going to stick to Golden Gate Bakery. The pastry was flaky but a little underdone - could have baked a bit longer and browner. Very pale.", "author": "Jean K."}

True to her word, the next tray of buns came out of the kitchen. Yes!\n\nThe bbq pork buns ($1.25) are on larger size compared to others that I've had.  The bun had a nice toasty texture.

MSG !!   \n\nI finally decided to try this place after reading a Yelp friend's glowing review some time ago.  I was out running some errands and decided to drop in just for a few things for a late breakfast.  My small order consisted of three har gows, three pot stickers and one chicken combination bun.  It's quite a bit of food to have for breakfast, but I'm just glad I had a big can of Monster energy (not sold here) to wash it all down with.\n\nIt hit me with that very first bite into the potsticker.  The MSG that is.  I'm pretty sensitive to the stuff and I felt the sting on the tip of my tongue as soon as I tasted the filling.  They must use a lot of it because it was very noticeable in all three items I purchased.\n\nThe potstickers are plump and the skin is soft and oily.  Inside you'll find a stinging mixture of ground pork, chopped cabbage and ginger.  I'll bet this would have been tastier without the MSG.  The har gow had a stinging mixture of firm pieces of rock shrimp, some tapioca starch and solid cubes of bamboo shoot.  I liked the skin which was thin and very chewy almost like chewing gum.\n\nI usually order chicken combination buns over regular chicken buns.  Most places give you chicken, Chinese sausage, hard boiled egg and a piece of shiitake mushroom.  The tongue-stinging mixture offered in Clement's version features chopped cabbage that is still crunchy instead of the mushroom.  In addition there's a piece of chewy BBQ pork inside as well.  Here is how it looked dissected (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/MKGPb57KYoj11x0t7r5HGw?select=DmiUDqQnSH5b8Y76NIxB2A).  I liked the bun itself which had nice texture and good flavor, but damn the MSG which ruined the entire product.\n\nI don't think I'll return for any of their savory items anymore, but I might try some of their sweeter pastries sometime in the future.  Friendly service.  The ladies speak both Chinese and English.  Carry bottled water with you if you're sensitive to MSG.  You'll need about three liters of it to wash away that sting from your tongue!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-19", "description": "I've been going to this place for over 30 years. You'd think they must be doing something right, right? Indeed, but it can also be a big disappointment. Although I like the food which, when it is hot and at its best, deserves 4-5 stars, the incredibly rude and unhelpful staff really brings this place down. \n\nThe staff's attitude is not new. I remember when I was a kid one waitress (back then they used to actually serve you dim sum at a table as well as at the counter) used to literally throw the silverware at your face. While rudeness is not exactly uncommon in Chinese restaurants, the kind you'll experience at Clement Restaurant is not of the variety that you may have experienced at places like Sam Wo's (for those of you who remember that old place in Chinatown) where the staff was rude but in a friendly, jovial way. Here the staff is genuinely displeased with their work and don't miss an opportunity to let you know how little they care about your experience at the restaurant. \n\nExamples: So like I said the food is best when it's hot. While not so critical for the steaming goods, for the baked and fried goods that sit out unheated, timing is key. Either you have to be lucky or wait for the hot stuff to come out. But you may just be waiting for a hassle. Often I'll go in there and see them coming out with a steaming hot fresh tray of something good (like the baked baos). I'll ask politely for those hot ones instead of the ones that have been sitting there for awhile, and just about every time I get an argument from the staff who prefers to push out old product rather than please their customer. \"Same thing, same thing\" is their mantra. NO, it's not the same! \n\nToday  I didn't bother asking for the hot one's because I simply didn't want to deal with the staff. But after I paid I asked for a small cup of water (I needed to take some pills). \"No water.\" Really? You made all this food but don't have access to tap water? \"Only bottle water.\" I'm sitting there looking at a stack of small plastic cups (presumably used to serve something in) and asked the clerk if she could just put some water in one of those. She gives me a look of disgust and then says \"75 cent.\" I told her that even McDonalds will give you a cup of water for free, but then said fine and then handed her a buck. She sat there and thought about it for a minute, and then tells me \"only hot water, you want hot water?\" I asked for my dollar back and left. Sorry folks, but when you go to a restaurant and are refused free water it is the ultimate sign that the establishment is inhospitable. \n\nAnother thing to avoid in this joint is the staff's pushy insistence on knowing absolutely everything you might want right away rather than letting you select each item one by one as they get it. Maybe you need a little time to figure it out. Maybe you might buy more if you had a little time. Believe me I have little patience for those people who can't make up their mind and take forever, but c'mon.The other problems with this are that : (1) They don't always remember everything you ordered; and (2) They do the math in their head. Sometimes they get it right, sometimes they don't. Often you'll walk out without things you ordered and or without paying what you actually owed. \n\nNot long ago I peeked in the window next door in what used to be the dining area of Clement Restaurant. Now it's like a Panda-express style joint that I assume, but do not know, is owned by the same people that own Clement Restaurant. Some of the chicken looked good, but I've been burnt by crap of this variety before. So I went in and asked the clerk for a sample. She looked at me like I was homeless and started waiving at me to leave. Ok not your friendly local neighborhood butcher who takes pride in what they do and is happy to give you a free taste of something you might buy. So I offered to pay for a sample. \"No, sorry, no sorry\" and again waiving at me to leave. Hmm? You sell food. I will PAY you for it. Not interested? There was no one else in line waiting to buy anything. It could just be our little secret.  Ok, how much do I have to buy to make it worth your while to scoop up some of that chicken sitting there for me to try instead of standing there doing nothing? I finally managed to purchase a 1/2 pint. It was cheap and cold, definitely not worth the hassle. \n\nTo be fair, there is currently one lady working at Clement Restaurant who is friendly and helpful. Give her a raise as she's all you've got going in the service department. \n\nAside from the staff in this place, one also has to be vigilante of certain clientele who don't understand the concepts of a queue or personal space (you know who you are).  I can't tell you how many times I've been there where someone has cut in front of me in line, or bumped into me, without giving it a second thought. Again, not so uncommon in this city. \n\nOverall this is a place to go for cheap dim sum to go, but you will get better service at McD's.", "author": "Dan H."}

And we even waited in the longest line at the end of the day just because we HAD to get more luscious dim sum delights. I considered it a dim sum pub crawl, so to speak. Except we kept going back to the same place. ;-) The dim sum is amazing. Perfectly prepared every time. We love the fried shrimp balls and the crispy crunchy fried sesame balls. Also tried the steamed shrimp dim sum and baked chicken roll and the custard cups. They're all delicious. Just be careful, break into the sesame ball by opening it with your hands first to let the steam out before biting into it. Don't get so carried away that you bite into it immediately otherwise you will probably loose the roof of your mouth. Those things are HOT HOT HOT! \n\nLet's just say we filled up on so much dim sum that afternoon that we passed on our original plans to get Thai noodle soup down the street after the game. And my honey had a serious cold that day, so the soup would have been a surefire cure-all. But we just couldn't stop with the dim sum. It's just that good. \n\nI love this place.

There are actually tons of choices to pick for the two sides to accompany whatever main you want. I usually go for the chicken teriyaki and the rehydrated dried tofu. The other dishes are pretty much hit or miss for me. The sticky rice that they make here is also very good. Though the food does indeed get very greasy, it isn't that bad for the price that you pay. The one lady that is always at the register is alright. She is friendly enough to help with whatever questions I have about what a tray holds to how telling me how much longer the sticky rice will take until being ready. If you stick to getting their lunchbox deal it will come out to $5.25 and you will get plenty of food to last a good amount of your day.

Crispy crunchy outer layer with a savory chicken meat on the inside.  I ordered 6 of the large legs.  $1.99 a pound.  I knew I was coming back.\n\nHowever, this past evening, I walked down for these legs again and realized that everything notable Chinese closes right on the dot at either 6:30 pm or 7:00 pm.  Since I was already starting to get aggravated by the numerous CLOSED signs my puffy hair was on static alert by the time I reached this usual place of consolation.\n\nFAIL.\n\nTwo people walked out with some hot foodstuff before us and this was ten minutes prior to 7:00.  The minute we walk in the double doors left open, the woman at the counter scowls and screeches \"NO NO\" at the top of her lungs and motions away with her gloved hands.  Her male counterpart says something back in Chinese to her, but she remained firm.\n\n\"What, you won't even sell that 1/2 cup portion to me?\"\n\n\"NO NO,\" the scowling pony-tailed woman reiterates, without looking me in the eye, busy with placing leftovers in Chinese containers so that they could probably take them home.  \"We closed!\"  the phrase came back and slapped us in the face.\n\nThis was delivered, not in a courteous manner, where I might have left understandably and without feeling odd, but it was fucking rude.  And I said it, not that they would understand it.  \"Rude.\"\n\nI know these places don't really expound on customer service, but when I have experienced nothing but good customer service at Gourmet Dim Sum further along the way, I'm not one to stereotype all of the places on the block.  Put up a fucking sign that says \"CLOSED\" or give us an idea of your hours, that way I won't walk in over the threshold where you've left the two front doors conveniently opened.\n\nOtherwise, I'll see if that rude woman is as rude on the weekends, when I can sneak back for the brandy fried chicken legs.  Despite this fucked up awakening, I'm still a sucker for something that is really really good.\n\nAnd I'm not talking about great sex with an ugly man. \n\nHell no.", "author": "Miika M."}

Walking by, the items in the window never looked particularly appetizing.  But I kept hearing that they have the best Chinese buns in the city from trusted sources (I don't think I bought the buns in the past), so I returned to investigate.\n\nThey have a wider variety than most places since they have baked goods and dim sum, so you'll find egg custard tarts, loaf bread (Taiwan toast, red bean toast), 3 types of porridge, dim sum dumplings (3 for  $1.55), Chinese donuts, Chinese rice tamales, baked buns, steamed buns, mochi (coated in coconut), grass jelly, dried shrimp rice rolls, sponge cupcakes, and more.  The menu is in English.\n\n* Steamed red bean buns: smooth and uniform in size and shape - professional looking and stamped in red on top.  There was a decent amount of filling inside, a smooth sweet red bean paste, though the first few bites were all bun, no filling.\n\n* Baked red bean bun (80 cents) had a pineapple top.  I prefer plain baked red bean buns.  The pineapple crust top fell apart easily and made the bun too sweet.  The chunky red bean filling was delicious and the overall bun was heavy with plenty of filling and chewy, thick dough.  \n\n* Steamed chicken bun ($1) was the best one I've had in a long time.  A delicate looking teardrop shape, the dough was tender and sweet and the chicken filling (think chicken meatball) wasn't salty or bland - it was juicy and had a stronger chicken taste than you usually find.  I liked the addition of cabbage too.  They even added a bit of ginger to the chicken filling.  Divine.\n\n* Steamed vegetable bun - chock full of veggies, including carrots, wood ear mushrooms, clear noodles, cabbage, pickled mustard green\n\n* Steamed combination bun - it's a monster, their largest steamed bun with chicken, cabbage, savory Chinese sausage and even a hard boiled egg - wow!\n\n* Baked BBQ pork bun - filled with plenty of meat and some onions, the sauce is a bit too salty - Lung Fung has better BBQ pork buns\n\n* Baked chicken bun - doughy and soft, with big chunks of chicken in a thickened savory sauce (mainly tastes like soy sauce).  Generous amounts of meat, a bit salty though.  The equivalent of the baked BBQ pork bun only with chicken.  I prefer their steamed chicken bun which is more delicate and less salty.  \n\n* Baked tuna bun (80 cents) - sweet, soft dough surrounds a tuna salad with generous amounts of black pepper and onions.  The pepper makes it different.  Very tasty.  Update: I had another tuna bun and the filling was way too salty :-(\n\n* Chicken and mushroom congee - good flavor, broken down and on the watery side, tastes like chicken vs. just water + rice, even has some ginger in it \n\n* Pork and preserved egg congee - quite bland and on the watery side, pork lacks flavor too, no ginger flavor.  The chicken congee is better.\n\n* Har gow - decent but the bamboo shoots were hard.  I wouldn't get these again.  \n\nAmple seating, not much in terms of ambiance - it's an old, inexpensive Chinese takeout Chinese/bakery so it has the ambiance you usually get at such places.  I've never tried the other side with the prepared food but my sense is that you should stick to the buns.\n\nMy trusted sources were right about the buns. Great price for heavy buns with superb fillings - be sure to get a couple of them, particularly the steamed chicken buns.", "author": "Lolia S."}

However, I have gone to the dim sum section of this restaurant numerous times and they do justice to dim sum. Good Luck Dim Sum is down the street yet I have not gone there because of the extreme long lines there. Clement Dim Sum has to be the best Dim Sum when it comes to fried taro dumplings, potstickers, xiu mai, steamed pork buns, and endless amounts of freshly baked pastries. The lady in front is fast and gets your order very quick while keeping the lines moving. I'm from San Jose and I just paid 16 bucks for dim sum in San Jose but at Clement Dim Sum, 3 bucks for the many options of dim sum I desire. 3 pieces for 1.50! How can you beat that?

I had a good range of selections: char siu bow (pork bun), har gow (shrimp dumpling), fun gor (pork and peanut dumpling), and the pan-fried cilantro and shrimp dumpling.  \n\nThe pork bun was the giant, gut-buster size that I normally like (not the delicate fluffy little things with a speck of meat inside that you get at the big hong-kong style banquet halls).  It had a good ratio of bow-to-meat, but the meat was one-note in flavor: sweet.  Not bad at all, but it grew a bit tiresome quickly.\n\nThe har gow was the high note, a nice plump shrimpy delight.  But the fun gor is what really let me down.  The dumpling skin was hard (undercooked?), and unappetizing.  The insides were fine, but not lip-smacking good.\n\nI'll keep on searching for great dim sum.  I didn't find it at the Clement Restaurant, but for the price, it did alright.", "author": "Laurence W."}

Most of the bakeries considered good nowadays are these sterile storefronts where you grab a tray and use tongs to grab your selection, or the pastry is already individually wrapped. They were fun when they first came around, but these bakeries have lost their souls and it's evident in their blah tasting, mass produced buns. \n\nClement Restaurant's bakery reminded me of everything a Chinese bakery should be. Nothing beats the smell of fresh baked bread and that in combination with the smell of fried dumplings reminds me of family trips to Chinatown when I was a kid (to this day, SF to my parents is still Chinatown). While I stood in line trying to remember how to say my order in Cantonese, the female workers in the front were yelling to workers in the back when something ran low. I can't believe it's been so long since I've seen fresh dough being rolled at a Chinese bakery. \n\nAnd all of my favorite sweets treats were cheap: 3 for $1.55! The cocktail buns were so good and fresh. The pineapple buns are the best I've ever had. The bread was so fluffy and the sweet crust on top stayed intact. These pastries are all I've been thinking about all day. And oh how I've missed the pink box wrapped with that pink plasticky string. \n\nI didn't think it would be possible to pull me away from Good Luck Dim Sum, but I just might have to try Clement's dim sum next time because I'll definitely be making a stop here for the sweet stuff.", "author": "Mimi L."}

Now those two things are forgiveable, but I've also noticed that the filling inside the buns has been getting less and less sweet over the years.  Not sure what happened.  It used to be so good!!!  What's up with that?  Has the price of sugar gone up that much?\n\nI do like their variety though and do enjoy their fried chicken and spring rolls.

If you're anything like me, then you try to get your mitts on a pork bun as soon as it comes out of the oven.  Hotness of the bun is nearly perfectly positively correlated with it deliciousness.\n\nThe outside of the bun is caramelized into this creme-brulee-esque shell that, once bitten into, gives way into the softest, sweetest dough that has just a little textural bite.  The filling is this pork chunks and caramelized onions suspended in hot, viscous syrup.  What makes the filling especially good is the balance between the bbq pork bun taste trinity: sweet, salty, and savory.  And you best believe that glistening sheen is from the copious amounts of cornstarch that bring this filling from a stew to a consistency more akin to sterno.  This is my pick for best baked pork bun in the city.  So far.\n\nEverything else:\nis ok.  Except for the siu mai, which, if propelled through a cannon, could bring down a small castle.

You can't swing a soy replica of an expired feline (I'm trying to be sensitive to our animal loving vegan friends out there, and you know who you are) on Clement St. without hitting a Chinese bakery/dim sum take out joint. So if they were trying to come up with a catchy name to differentiate themselves from the slew of other restaurants they failed miserably. \r\n\r\nThat being said Clement Restaurant is my favorite. And it was no easy road let me tell you. When I first started coming here I thought the women who worked here hated me...and I was RIGHT! You wouldn't believe the attitude. It got to the point that I was tempted to say, \"I'm half Chinese! Could you  just be HALF an asshole to me?!\" I should have a card that reads, \"Half Chinese; good for 1/2 off rudeness.\" Actually I don't think it would matter because I've seen some serious stink eye directed towards Asians as well.\r\n\r\nDespite the unwarranted hostility I continued to come here. After about a YEAR the women finally began to soften and actually joked about how I got the same shit every time. No one has ever called me a quitter. The reason I endured such abuse for so long is that I just like this stuff better than the others. That, and you can get a BOX of it for like $10. It's enough food for three people (or MY fat ass.)\r\n\r\nSo if you have a thick skin, are cheap and have a hearty appetite this place may be just be your new favorite spot.", "author": "Josua P."}

Its is really convenient!  And im sure that you would like to know that it is definitely nice that this place is cheap too!  Their bakery has many tasty and filling goodies that are all under a dollar!  Plus, a few of their goodies are 3 for 1.25.  Now thats cheap! :-D  I usually go in there and get a pineapple bun and a steamed pork bun, but they also have potstickers, soup, and other hot meal goodies to enjoy.\n\nNow i will say that there are a few places on this street that feature rice and 2 items of food for 4 dollars + tax (I miss when it was 3.70 :-P)  But this place is by FAR my favorite.  Why you might ask???\n\nBecause unlike the other places on the street...you can get your two items with EITHER rice or noodles!  Let me explain...The other places on the street that offer the 2 item 4 dollar deal...say that the 2 item combo is only 4 dollars if you get steam rice and 2 items, and steam rice only!  This place is nice cause you can choose from their 2 or 3 selections of fried rice, or their 3 or 4 different kinds of noodle dishes, AND ANY of their two items :-D  That definitely makes this place my favorite.  Oh and it all tastes good too :-)\n\nOh and i should mention that i am really rating this place 4 1/2 instead of just 4.  I gave this place a little bit of a reduction because everyonce in a while you get a crankier then usual person behind the counter at either places, and even though it doesnt happen often, its enough to warrant a little bit of a deduction.  Oh and their cash only policy can be a little bit annoying at times, but i guess it makes sense considering its kind of silly to charge purchases under 5 bucks, since thats what a majority of their transactions are.\n\nAnyway, if your craving some Chinese food that isn't 7 bucks for 2 items (Panda Express, Eeerrrrrrr :-P), then this place is definitely the spot to grub :-D", "author": "Mark R."}

This took some work--actually, I still have so many places to try--but using Yelp, I determined which were the best candidates and went from there.\n\nNeedless to say, I think Clement Restaurant is the best, at least for what I like: green onion pancakes, green onion and shrimp balls, custard buns, red/yellow bean buns, pineapple buns, baked chicken buns, and--my all-time favorite--sesame balls. The only thing I've had there that I didn't like was the vegetable bun, but there are so many other good things that I don't really mind. \n\nThe food is tasty and cheap, but also easy to order. The women working the counter speak English and the menu board is written in both Chinese and English. There are a few tables at which to eat, but if you're taking your dim sum to eat on the go, be sure to ask for napkins (they won't give you any otherwise). The line can be kind of long at times, but it's totally worth it.\n\nEdit (7/08): I've been wanting to try the baked chicken buns for a while (though I didn't write it before, I'm not the biggest fan of the steamed chicken buns), but they always seem to be sold out of them.

Since it was a rainy day, we decided to just pick a random dim sum place and grab some stuff to go rather than walking around to look for another place to eat. She got her lo mai gais ($2.25 each) while I got some buns for my parents and grandma. My dad loves pineapple buns so I got him six (they're priced at three for $1.60). I got my mother three large steamed chicken buns ($1.40 each, I believe). I'm not sure if that's a good deal since I rarely buy dim sum or buns.

Thus far, I recommend...\n- BBQ Pork Bun (Steamed OR baked)\n- Baked curry beef bun\n- Tuna bun\n- Red Bean bun\n\nI had a steamed chicken bun once and it was.. meh. It wasn't BAD.

Somehow I didn't realize that it wasn't really a sit-down place (can't read, I guess) but we stayed anyway because I was about ready to gnaw someone's arm off, I was that hungry. It was easy to pick out what we wanted because everything was clearly labeled (in English!) which I haven't come across too often, especially in Chinatown. I chose a few of my favorites - turnip cake, shrimp & chive dumplings, baked pork bun, wu gok - and threw in a green onion braided roll and a bottle of water for good measure. My total? $6.90. Freaking amazingly cheap for that much food, especially since I got three dumplings and two slabs of turnip cake.\nDue to the lack of seating, we took our treasures next door and went to work. My friend attacked her fried chicken leg like it was her last meal - I didn't even have a chance to nibble but it looked tasty. I was so excited to dig into my turnip cake but it was cold. Like, from-the-fridge cold! Super bummer, but I saved it to fry up this morning (awesome!). The baked pork bun was steaming hot though and filled with delicious BBQ pork. Too bad I had a bite that was basically one big glob of pork fat - ugh. The wu gok was very good - the puff was fried crisp and the pork & taro filling had good porky flavor. The shrimp & chive dumplings were also very good but I wish there was some sort of chili sauce readily available in addition to the black vinegar; the dumplings were a little bland and could have used some spice. The green onion roll turned out to be my favorite - they used a sweeter dough than I'm used to (almost tasted like brioche?) which was a great contrast to the savory onion flavor.\nMinus a star for the turnip cake served cold and the fat in the pork bun.

My dad worked in a very bland office around the corner but the saving grace was that he was on Clement Street so whenever we visited we knew we'd eat something amazing.\n\n I was having a physical craving for this place on my latest visit home. It was like a magnetic beam forcing me to trek from my parents' place in Novato. I could practically hear it calling me. I hadn't counted on the evil, hellish nightmare that driving on Clement Street on a Sunday has become. It was always bad, but holy crap the traffic, the stupid stopping in the middle of the street are enough to drive a peaceful man to murder. And if that's not enough, the lines dragging to the back wall were almost enough to have me go somewhere. But I persisted, even the 100 + year old man behind me who started ordering before his turn and then kept pushing me for no apparent reason didn't stop me from ordering a huge bag of delicious curry puffs, corn thingys(which I've never seen in any other dim sum), pork buns and dumplings.

So, we decided to try Clement Restaurant. \n\nFor all we bought (Har Gau, Siu Mai, Dry Shrimp Crepe, Chinese Donut, Potstickers, and BBQ pork steam bun) all for only $8 something. Dirt Cheap!!!

He loves bbq pork buns! \n\nHere is why it's not the winning dim sum for me and I choose Good Luck Dim Sum way over this one:\n\n- Har Gau- the skin is too thick and not enough shrimp in it, unlike Good Luck Dim Sum, the skin is thin and they are loaded with shrimp. \n- Potstickers- mine were cold although they were good, they weren't crispy. Too bad!\n- Dry Shrimp Crepe- it was cold and no sauce to eat it with.. disappointing! \n\nBut, they do have something I like, such as Chinese Donuts. Love them, especially with porridge! Yumm! Gotta try it:  hot porridge with egg on the bottom with slivered of Chinese Donuts on top!

This place is a steal, and yes, it's very, very tasty. The combo plate alone is two full dinners.", "author": "Ice Cream Truck I."}

AND they had 3 kinds of congee! and they had the fried bread thingy! oooh! but since i got there late, they only had 2 of the 3 kinds of congee so that was a little sad. and the lady was slightly irritable (maybe because the people ahead of me were kinda dilly dallying). hmmmm congeeeeee was deelirshus and definitely not stingy on the meat side. i would have loved more of the egg though. no matter, the presence of dipping bread made it all worth it. and the sesame ball for dessert was a lovely ending. hooray! another congee hankering conquered!", "author": "ray e."}

The top coat is so good and cannot be found anywhere else. They are a bit pricier than most places but they're totally worth it. Talking about them just makes my mouth watery.. hmm. I usually go out of my way just to get my hands on one of them. Love them especially when they're warm.", "author": "Dianne I."}
