It has the skin and legs on it.. ewww... there was no salt no oil no chilli or any kind of masala... the worst experience as after Fasting a whole day we got a food like this.\nWe cooked that gravy by adding some masalas and oil and salt into it and then had it... so there is no point of having to go order from restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-22", "description": "The small one block stretch on Jones between Geary & O'Farrell hosts three Pakistani/Indian restaurants namely Shalimar, Chutney and Pakwan that I decided to try, to find one that I could stick with on a regular basis. After trying Shalimar, I decided to try Chutney. Chutney is located in the heart of the hood so apart from letting you know that you have to basically ignore panhandlers on your way here and back, I'm going to spare you other details.\n\nChutney seems to be slightly bigger than Shalimar and is also a lot cleaner compared to Shalimar. The carpet definitely needs cleaning, but it does look like the floors and tables are cleaned periodically unlike Shalimar where they seem to be simply wiped down.\n\nAt the peak dinner hour Chutney too was almost full but not as packed as Shalimar across the street. I decided to get the Chicken Tikka Masala ($8.99) and a couple of naan ($1) to-go. Wait time again was around 20 minutes which was not too bad.\n\nTaste wise the Chicken Tikka Masala was nicely cooked. It was hot but not overly spicy. The naan was also nicely cooked without it being overly soft and chewy or hard and brittle. Overall this was a pretty good meal. After my first visit I've been back a couple of times to try out a couple more of their chicken and lamb dishes all of which are around the $10 mark. Similar to Shalimar the quantity of food that you get when you dine-in is much less when compared with to-go, but they seem to be a little more generous than Shalimar.\n\nPrice-wise Chutney is about 15% more expensive than Shalimar across the street and 15% less expensive than Pakwan that is on the next block. Taste-wise and consistency wise it is on the top followed by Shalimar and then Pakwan. Chutney is my preferred choice when I want to dine-in.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-05", "description": "My review is a bit biased, since after living in Fremont I came to know the other Chutney location like an old friend. The SF location pales a bit in comparison, but there are several hold-overs that also make this place a local gem, especially for the Tenderloin. \n\nAnd yes, the biggest detractor for me is that this place is in the Tenderloin. I'm not a fan - never have been, never will be. The interior of this Chutney seems to have taken on the dark, inexplicably grungy vibe of the Loin', but the service is fast and the food is generally great. \n\nTwo things I would skip are the Raita ($1) and, sadly, the Saag Paneer (~$8). The raita has the consistency of Elmer's glue - almost elastic and slime-like. Really off-putting. The Saag was fairly bland (but still tasty) and had large chunks of barely-heated paneer in it. The Bengan Bharta was better, but similarly uninspired. Both lack a depth of flavor and richness that places like Naan n Curry are able to achieve. \n\nThat said, Chutney continues to be the heavyweight champs of Chicken Tikka Masala. It's one of the few - if only - places that actually grills their chicken in a tandoor oven, and the sauce is amazing: rich, creamy, spicy, complex, and super flavorful. Paired with their aromatic rice (studded with cardamom), it's a dream dinner. \n\nTwo thumbs up for the free chai, plates of fresh veggies, and some killer Tikka. Next time we're craving our old fave, we'll definitely return!", "author": "Laura B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-29", "description": "We have been going to Chutney for about 5 years and it is definitely our favorite Indian/Pakistani food in the city.  The Tandoori is particularly good, with the meat well cooked without being dry and the naan perfectly prepared.  We especially like the curry dishes, very spicy without being overly hot.  \nI also experienced the incident another reviewer witnessed with the homeless lady and while it was rather sad and unfortunate in the way it was handled, I truly don't know what choice the owner had.  Unlike the other reviewer, who had no contact with the lady before she was removed, this lady came up to our table, drooled on the floor, begged for money, and then grabbed my drink and drank it.  She then proceeded to sit down at another table with some guests.  \nWhile picking her up and depositing her outside was probably not the way I would have handled it, it was done gently and quickly and didn't appear to hurt the lady.  This lady apparently comes into this business often and causes the same type of scene.  As someone who works in healthcare and comes in contact with the homeless daily, I recognized this lady as extremely mentally ill and therefore I believe she was not someone who could be reasoned with.  I believe if they would have asked her politely to leave, that she would have just made an even bigger scene.  And forget about SFPD as the previous reviewer suggested to the owner.  This would have been an extremely low priority call for them and they would likely not have responded in time to do anything.  \nWe will continue to come here and support this business.", "author": "Steve C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-22", "description": "In at least one conceivable universe I would offer up four stars. The food is quite good, though I've had better, and the service is reasonably prompt, though some places bring it out faster. But I'm going to bump it up to five based on how well they've kept to their program in the midst of the ocean of haterade whiny entitled San Franciscans are pouring on them below.\n\nI enjoy their food. It comes well-spiced and in large portions. Their tikka masala will win no awards for creativity but is thick and creamy, satisfying, and addictive. The veggie curries don't all make full use of the Bay Area's bounteous locavore harvest, but the flavors leave my mouth wonderfully happy. They could up their game on their free chai and on their naan. The rice is already perfect as is.\n\nMore to the point, this is a value restaurant. That doesn't mean it's a total dive: The room is actually fairly spacious and attractive given its downtown location, the affordable prices, and order-at-the-counter bring-your-number-to-your-table service dynamic. A single diner can get away for under $10 and a group of four can stuff themselves silly without going far beyond $40.\n\nPlus they're open until midnight, which makes this a great if heavy post-bar option and a good one for a quick bite when I'm on my way home to do more work. On all of these counts we should be encouraging them to keep doing what they're doing, and hope that anyone with issues kindly take them to less affordable, more precious establishments.", "author": "James D."}

I highly wouldn't recommend bringing a date in the area, unless you're feeling a little adventerous and aren't phased by the homeless on the street. Also, street parking can be a bitch. I circled around for 15-20 min. on a week night to find a metered spot (after 6 PM free parking). Plus, semi-close to Union Square; smack dab in downtown SF. I would drive cautiously, because SF is known for jay walkers and people crossing without even looking for traffic. Keep in mind TOURISTS are always in the city too.\n\n\nOn Wednesday evening (12/14/16) decided to grab some Indian/ Pakistani cuisine. We originally wanted to try out Shalimar, but there was a line of at least 6-8 people infront. Since, we didn't want to wait to eat, we noticed Chutney across the street and was like \"why not, let's try that out.\"\n\nWe proceeded to walk into the restaurant, ordered 3 entrees and several Naans.\n\n1. Chicken Tikka Masala\n2. Lamb Curry (mild)\n3. Daal Masala\n4. Garlic Naan $2.99/pc\n5. Naan (2 pcs) $1/pc\n\nI sat down while my two friends ordered on what we agreed upon. A waiter brought a pitcher of water, cups, plates, utensils, napkins and a plate of salad (tomato slices, raw onions, iceberg lettuce & lime wedges).\n\u00a0\nAfter about 5-10 min, another waiter brought our food to the table and set them down. 1 star for fast service. The restaurant is spacious, and can fit maybe a crowd of 20-30 people tops. 1/2 star for room.\n\nFood came pipping hot, so did the naan. 1/2 star for hot food. \n\nIf you love Chicken Tikka Masala, DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT... order their Chicken Tikka Masala. It is all wrong here. Tasted more like tomato bisque (sour & alot of tomatoes). It felt like it was missing the cream/ yogurt and the spices that make it a Masala. It definately wasn't even the same category as Chicken Tikka Masala. My bestfriend and I were so disappointed about this dish, because you know a place is great for their most commonly knowm dish... we were so disgruntled about it. Knowing that we were hungry, we ate it but vowed never to come back to this establishment. We compared it to our go-to's back in East Bay (Hayward) and South Bay (San Jose/ Santa Clara).\n\nNaan is very typical. Nothing much to rave about. It came hot, was a large piece of bread, & dry. Not fluffy. \n\nLamb Curry: very gamey if you preferr to have that distinct smell or taste with your food. I can't say I like or dislike it. It's not something I would order on my own.\n\nDaal Masala: I wish they had Daal Makhani. Which is the best because it's so creamy and lucious. But no where on the menu did it have that specific dish, so I settled on Daal Masala. It's not great, and it seemed like it consisted of the same oils and spices as the Lamb Curry. I would not recommend getting.\n\nOverall experience: 2 stars. \n\nDon't be scared to try new places. Our expectations were a bit higher, because my best friend and I would frequently eat Indian food back in San Jose during the time we both were students at San Jose State University. FYI, we were pretty disappointed and bummed that we didn't get a great Chicken Tikka Masala. We felt we could've made a better one than this restaurant.", "author": "Vivian V."}

Mother was packed with wisdom and wit.\n\nI like the owner.  He's always friendly and helpful.  It's a place for regulars.  Since it's run down and you have to figure out how to take care of yourself.  The Alec A. review is a good example of someone who doesn't belong.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-11", "description": "The infatuation recently came out with a first timers guide to Indian restaurants and Chutney fit quite nicely into its qualifications of a legit indian restaurant: They were terrible service, less than updated ambiance, no wine list, and packed with Indian families. Obviously this doesn't hold true for every single indian restaurant, but by and large I feel like the food suffers a little when the restaurant focuses on being fancy/ nice. ( I can think of a handful in SF) \n\nMy point is, this is one of the better Indian restaurants in SF and you just have to put up with some of the shortcomings in terms of service in order to get to the delicious food. When I went, you order at the counter and I felt kind of rushed because they already wanted to get to the next person in line. Once you order they bring out your food and thats it. We were missing a fork and when I went to ask for another one I was pointed to where I can get them myself. Same for the chutney sauce. But then, you taste your food and its so good you completely forget about everything I just mentioned. I would rather have great food in a sketchier place than mediocre food in a really nice place. \n\nThe food truly sets itself apart from most Indian restaurants in SF (which, there are a lot). It isn't a sort of Naan-n-Curry extremely thick-creamy-greasy food, and it also isn't watered down. I was so glad to have finally found a decent Indian place in SF that compares to the Indian food in the East Bay (I'm just gonna say it now... the East Bay has better indian food overall than SF). \n\nWHAT I GOT:\nBecause this is getting long, let me just get to what I actually had while here. \nNaan (was perfect and fresh! fluffy and warm) \nSamosas - small but good \nChicken Vindaloo Yees \nBaigan Bhartha Yeeees! \nSaag Paneer YEAAAS \nMango Lassi - Standard \n\nOne more thing I liked about this place is they aren't afraid to spice your food if you ask for it.

I mean like take the best Indian food you've ever had and times it by a hundred. The portion the perfect the flavors a savoury succulent sensational and spectacular. And the best part is they can literally make food tailored to your taste buds. For example if you like food lukewarm they'll make sure the food doesn't come out as hot. If you like it spicy they'll make sure you need bread Water Ice and the fire department. If you want your food super flavorful they can do that. And then to top it all off you get the most amazing milk tea (Chai) that is on planet Earth. And it's not like it's an upcharge anything this is free F-R-E-E.

The food was around $10 or less, which is great. I was disappointed with the portion sizes though. I finished my whole entree...which could either mean I was an extra fatty that day or portion size was indeed small. I prefer to believe the latter ;) \n\nI got the lamb biryani which was spicier than the same dish I got at Pakwan. Personally, I like a milder dish so I liked Pakwan's better. But if you like a spicier dish, Chutney's is for you.\n\nAll in all, compared to Pakwan, I definitely prefer it a lot more than Chutney.

So oily and too much bland potato mixture. 1 bite and I was done. But, wow the keema naan definitely made up for it. The keema was perfectly spicy, favorable and evenly distributed in the naan. Also the mango lassie is amazingly decadent and a great drink/dessert. \n\nSo why only 3 stars?? Free food is money, but only if it's actually good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-10-07", "description": "This place is without a doubt the worst Indian food I've ever eaten. Ever. \n\nI came here with high hopes, after being slightly disappointed with the Indian fare at another popular SF spot. I knew it was a hole in the wall, and honestly that is an advantage in my book because it speaks to the restaurant's authenticity. Or so I thought...\n\nMy partner (who was born and raised in India) and I came in somewhat late and were encouraged by the large crowd in the restaurant. That's usually a good sign! We ordered at the front counter and the guy taking our order was really friendly. We ordered the chicken tikka masala and bhindi gosht (lamb with okra). Our food came out within 10 minutes of ordering, along with a couple of naan and some raita on the side. \n\nThe chicken tikka masala looked good but was bland, bland, bland. Besides a slight spicy (hot) kick, it tasted like chicken that had been plopped into some cream. The chicken itself was dry as a bone and not chicken tikka, which is normally what you see in chicken-based curry dishes (especially a dish called chicken TIKKA masala). The dry chicken was especially difficult to choke down as we had not received water or anything to drink at all. \n\nMy partner's lamb with okra was very bland and tasted like plain stewed okra with lamb meat. The okra was limp, slimy, and cooked to the point where it was beyond mushy. There was very little spice to it at all. He is usually the type to finish any dish even if it is mediocre, but he left over half of the serving untouched. \n\nAll in all, I would recommend that people go elsewhere. I don't care that the food isn't really all that authentic- I know everyone has their own take on certain recipes. But the food here was bland, heavy, and left us wishing we had eaten elsewhere. The whole area is chock full of Indian restaurants. I suggest choosing one of the others- any of them- besides this one!", "author": "Kate B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-04", "description": "Came here on a busy Saturday night with some of my good friends craving Indian food. The restaurant was busy but I guess we came at the right time as tables were open without any wait. My group of 5 decided to order family style and share all of our dishes. We decided to order the Chicken Tiki Marsala, Aloo Vindaloo (I love the name of this dish!), Aloo Ghobi, Lamb Biryani and Bengan Bharta with Garlic, Keema  (beef), Onion and plain Naan. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nChicken Tiki Marsala: Delicious as usual. Probably the most popular Indian dish and this place makes it to perfection. Creamy sauce, perfectly seasoned and chicken wasn't over cooked. Highly recommended if you are new to Indian food or don't feel adventurous ordering Lamb.  \n\nLamb Biryani: Holy crap this was spicy. I have a low tolerance for spiciness but I took a few bites and I was sweating and panting. I had to refill my cup with milk tea 2 or 3 times to counter the capsaicin in my mouth. However, of all the dishes we ordered, this was the best and had the most powerful seasoning. You could definitely taste each unique herb and spice placed in the dish and the lamb was delicious without any gamey taste. \n\nBengan Bharta: YUM! Who would think eggplant could be prepared so well? The dish is a puree of eggplant and other veggies into a paste or thick salsa like texture which goes perfectly with the Naan. Lots of flavor and I liked the texture. \n\nAloo Ghobi: This dish was quite flavorful and the texture of the cauliflower was perfect. A good alternative if you don't like the saucy curry to dip your Naan in. \n\nAloo Vindaloo: Although I love the name, the dish was subpar. This was the only dish I didn't like because it was very bland. The curry had no taste and we had to add salt. I'm not sure if they forgot to add seasoning or if the dish is purposely bland but I probably wouldn't order this again. \n\nGarlic, Keema  (beef), Onion and plain Naan: all were good but I probably wouldn't spend extra on the Keema (Beef) Naan next time. The dishes come with enough flavor and doesn't need beef to compliment an already delicious dish. Garlic was my favorite but when it comes to Naan, everyone has their own favorites. \n\n**********************************************************************\nOverall, excellent service and great good. Unlimited milk tea which I love. The secret to the optimal sugar-tea ratio is one full cup to two table spoons of sugar. Although the milk tea runs out quickly, the waiters are very efficient in refilling without much wait time. Also the waiters and cashier are extremely polite and nice. They aren't afraid to recommend dishes if you're indecisive. Many of the Indian restaurants I've been to have had unfriendly workers but not this place. As for the food, Chicken Tiki Marsala,Lamb Biryani and Bengan Bharta are highly recommended. Solid 4 stars.", "author": "Jonathan L."}

Granted, this was probably my 3rd or 4th time eating Indian cuisine so I'm no expert on how the best should taste.  However, I felt like Chutney prepared their food half-heartedly and the ingredients used to prepare the dishes weren't that fresh.\n\nI tried four things from here; the garlic naan, the chicken tikka masala, the lamb boti and the palak aloo methi. My \"favorite\" dish was probably the palak aloo methi, which was spinach cooked with potatoes. I used the garlic naan to mop up the spinach and made vegetarian tacos. I know, genius right? The chicken tikka masala and lamb boti was nothing to rave about. I know I'm going against the grain here but the chicken was chewy and rough to eat. It tasted like pre-boiled chicken covered in the bombay sauce - not good at all. The lamb was over-cooked and wasn't tender like I'm used to.\n\nThe prices were decent at 7-12 dollars per dish but I expected more based on the great reviews.", "author": "Quoc N."}

On the plus side there was a beer store across the street so we bought some and drank while waiting in line. \n\nOnto the food...which was nothing out of the ordinary. To start the samosas weren't good at all. The crust was very soft and the filling was not tasty at all. We ordered chicken tikka and paneer tikka masala. The at the counter said they had different tastes and he was right! The sauce of the chicken had this smokey flavor which was great. Paneer was standard. The veg biryani was okay quite oily though. On the plus side, the roti was gigantic! Definitely something to get. We were told they ran out of kheer and gulab jamun which are dessert staples for Indians. \n\nOverall, this place wasn't any different than other Indian restaurants I have dined at.

When I studied in San Francisco, I met some Saudi and Lybian friends. They took me to Chutney Restaurant. I want to recommend this restaurant because the food here is awesome. When I went to Chutney, there was a long line outside. I asked my friends for the best food suggestions. They recommended chicken masala and naan. \n\nThe first time I saw chicken masala, it reminded me of chicken curry in my country. Chicken masala is an orange color same color as chicken curry in my country. However, it is better. A taste of chicken was tasty. The masala sauce was creamy. It was marvelous. Moreover, I ate chicken masala with the naan. Naan is a type of bread. It was crispy because they made naan in the oven. When I ate naan with chicken masala, the taste of the naan was soft and juicy. \n\nOne more thing I like about this restaurant is the sauces that I ate with. They have 2 sauces. One of the sauces is a green color. It was not too spicy, not too salty and not too sour. They mixed the ingredients together and it was very good. Another sauce is brown color. It was sweet, but not too sweet. I like to eat both together. \n\nAfter that I went to Chutney again and tried more food.

It's way up there in my top 5 worst meals of all time too!!\nI'm not particularly picky when it comes to eating out but I do have  a few simple requirements: Hot Food, clean warm restaurant and (preferably) Boneless meat. This met none of these.\n\nAfter reading such good reviews here husband and I decided to give it a try being huge Indian and Curry fans. I really cannot understand why so many people rate this food so highly, the only thing I can think is that those that enjoy the food don't know any better.\n\nThe 'restaurant' (I use that term loosely) was freezing cold even sat there wearing 3 (yes 3 one being my winter coat!) layers. It's also more like a take out that the owners just put a few tables in to make it dine in.\n\nWe ordered our food and although it wasn't on the menu my husband asked for a Chicken Madras. The guy at the till said this was fine. \n\nWhen our food came the 'Madras' was actually BBQ Chicken according to the server. He didn't have a clue what we were talking about when we told him what it was supposed to be so my husband went for the Vindaloo instead.\n\nThe food:\n\nMy Chicken Korma (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/atXwmmJOrBLOaq-OROY2EA?userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#gBAfUT50_AEbaBy0dhzRtQ) was not like a Korma at all. Typically it is made with yoghurt, cream or coconut milk ect and is of thick consistency. This was more like oily runny gravy and had very little flavour at all. The meat was also on the bone and pink - Yuk. By the time I had picked what little meat there was off of the bone it was freezing cold due to the temperature inside the place.\nMy husbands was pretty much the same maybe with a little bit more spice. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/atXwmmJOrBLOaq-OROY2EA?userid=wwmJ56OlvMC_Z8llXTd6mA#OwOVAG5elBYzQE0W-m3okw).\n\nThe Naan was over cooked with an odd after taste, Roti was thick and doughy and the Rice was the only thing I had no fault with but then you can't really go wrong with Rice.\n\nUpon paying we were asked how our meal was. Although we were asked they didn't really appear to the that concerned. Ok so they took a little off the bill (like $5) but then we barely ate any of it.\n\nYes.. the food is cheap but the quality and taste reflects that. I can't help but think reviewers are letting the price guide how they rate this place. We won't get going back.\n\nParking:\nThere is a covered parking lot right next door (at a cost of $7 a day) that I think may even be owned by the same people but a word of warning - When my husband and I went to collect our car nobody was there. We waited almost 10 minutes for someone to come back and when they did they went straight to our car and opened the door - the key's were also left in the ignition!!! Of a brand new car!! So if you can I suggest you don't drive.. or at least don't use the lot next door.", "author": "Emmalouise B."}

Because I am so disappointed and the only word that comes to my mind, is \"meh\".\n\nI have eaten at this Chutney in the past. And then I have eaten at the Chutney in Fremont. And I truly do not know what the reviewers who are giving this place anything more than a 2 star rating liken Indian/Pakistani food to be.\n\nFirst of all, customer service here is a sham. We called them up last night to place an order to-go. \nExperience A) How long is your wait time for food delivery? Response - We aren't delivering tonight. Hangs up the phone.\nCalled back 2 seconds later.\nExperience B) We'd like to place an order for pick up. Response - You know where we are located, right? Yes, I do know where you are located. \"You called the Tenderloin branch. We keep getting calls but folks intend to call the other branch\". Yes, I realize. \n\nWe placedan order for 3 naans, 1 chicken seekh kebab, 1 beef seekh kebab, 1 chicken tikka masala and one matar paneer.\n\nWalked in, paid monies, didn't see any roaches, walked out smelling like chicken tikka.\nCame home, relished seekh kebabs. It was all downhill after that.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala - Tasted like rubbery premade chicken tikka kebabs thrown into tomato basil bisque. That's not how I remember it being. First of all, as a desi I should have known better than to order tikka masala. But come on, don't be feeding this to your patrons!\n\nMatar Paneer - Where's the masala? Where's the gravy? Why is this even on the menu when the chefs don't know how to make it!?\n\nThe naan was not bad. A bit on the smaller side. But the taste was not enough to salvage the debacle that is the tikka masala. \n\nAside from the food, what I didn't like was the fact that one of the cooks brought in a giant tub of tandoori'd chicken, only to be managing in with his bare hands. The f**k? I understand hangling uncooked meat with bare hands, because once cooked, those cooties don't stand a chance. But cooked chicken with bare hands?\n\nTotal order came to $25, which is not bad at all. But I would rather pay $100 and get served good food.\n\nI typically don't like dishing out 2 stars to restaurants. But I truly cannot help it.", "author": "Ranjani S."}

You wait in line at the counter to order.  They give you a number and you take a seat, without paying.  The space is no frills, kind of dingy, and almost everything you touch is sticky.  Unclear whether you are supposed to set your own table and get your own water, all of which is stationed at the back of the restaurant.  I think it depends on the mood of the employees and how busy they are.  The food is relatively cheap for the portions, and delicious.  I rarely stray from chicken tikka and never regret it.\n\nThe most strange part of the dining experience was the fact that after you eat, you  pay.  Why don't they just have you pay when you order?  It's all counter service anyways.  We were pissed bc the line was out the door and we thought we'd have to wait just to pay, but the guy told us to just cut the line and pay.

Maybe not such a surprise since it's in the same local vicinity of Shalimar, Dottie's True Blue, and Pho Tan Hoa - all among my favorite urban dives. I can now add Chutney to this select list for serving some really terrific Indian-Pakistani dishes on par with Pakwan, Lahore Karahi, and Golden Gate Pizza & Indian Cuisine. In fact, their service model is exactly the same as Pakwan's. Go up to the counter, order, and wait at a table of your own choosing until someone legitimate takes your number away. \n\nAs you wait, you get a pitcher of water and then a bare-bones salad of iceberg lettuce, tomato slices and sliced onion with a few wedges of lemon for dressing (see photo). It's good, and hey, it's free. My order starts to arrive. First off is the $2.99 Tandoori Chicken Leg, scorching hot but tasty-crispy-tender once the temperature climbs down (see photo). I had a $1.99 flat of Garlic Naan sprinkled with bits of cilantro (see photo). It was bigger than my hand. My main dish was not their curry (next time) but their $6.99 plate of Lamb Biryani (see photo). \n\nReally good stuff since it was a fried rice deep with flavor with huge chunks of tender lamb embedded in the generous mound of savory goodness. Service wasn't overly friendly but fast and efficient. Table turnover is a pretty critical component of their value proposition since the lines get long here. Expect it to be crowded, so you aren't disappointed with your first impression. It's definitely worth the breathless hike up Jones to try their extensive menu. Bargain meals of this level of quality are all too rare indeed. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...savory tastiness with a Bollywood twang \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...comfortable inside, not so much outside \nSERVICE - 4 stars...fast and efficient \nTOTAL - 4 stars...really good South Asian food or a price that will please the economically downtrodden", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-17", "description": "Famous for drug dealing, prostitution, hobos and crazy people, the Tenderloin aka \"TL\" neighborhood is avoided like a plague by most SF residents and tourists alike. Well, that's before they started opening speakeasy joints in the area, but I'll save that for another review.\n\nGrowing up 5 blocks from here, I never had the balls to enter the TL - yes, shocker!  My family never went there and neither did my friends.  The very first time I walked into the area was to go to Chutneys.  Located in the heart of the TL, you will never have a boring moment if you people-watch from the window.  The scene going on outside is somewhat like a soap opera and if you watch long enough, you might be able to catch a hobo fight or see a druggie getting arrested.\n\nNow, DON'T discount this place just because of the neighborhood it's in.  Trust me, the food is worth it! Ever since B introduced me to this place, I've been back several times.\n\nFOOD\nTandoori fish: This fish is flavored with red colored spices then cooked in the tandoori clay oven.  My dad calls it the \"Devil Fish\" because of the color. (He chuckles to himself when he says this). The result from cooking in the tandoori oven is a beautiful char on the skin and crispy edges while maintaining moisture inside the meat.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala: one of their most popular dishes, the chicken is tandoor chicken cut up into pieces and the sauce is creamier than most tikka masala's ive had.  I usually get this one spicy.\n\nChicken Biriyani: My favorite dish! It's a rice plate flavored with spices and onions.  The chicken in this dish is a dark meat that's always fall-off-the-bone tender. Delish!\n\nLamb curry: I like the flavor in the curry but the lamb was on the drier side.  I prefer my lamb with a little fat to add moisture back into the meat.\n\nGarlic or Potato Naan: The garlic naan has little pieces of garlic sprinkled on top before it's baked; I like to get one of these and the potato naan.  The potato one has mashed potatoes and parsley inside, it works great to sop up the sauces from the curry and masala.\n\nChai tea: free chai!! Some people prefer not to add sugar but I'm so used to Asian milk tea that I add tons of sugar.  It really chalks up to preference.\n\nChutney: they offer two complimentary flavors of chutney.  One of them is a mango sauce and the other is a mint sauce.  I don't prefer the mango sauce on its own because it's too sweet for what I prefer, but if I mix it with the mint sauce it's actually pretty good.  You can find these in the soda refrigerator next to the Chai. \n\nSERVICE\nThe style is very self-serve where you order at the cashier, bring a number to your table, and the food is brought to your table.  Although I usually set the table myself, anytime I've interacted with the employees, they have been very nice and helpful.  Even if there's a huge line going out the door, the guy at the cashier who takes our order is always patient and doesn't get upset when you can't pronounce items on the menu. During the weekends, there's usually a line that goes almost out the door.  Don't be afraid! It moves really fast.\n\nPARKING\nThere's only metered parking available in the area.  I'd suggest parking in front of an area with high walking traffic so it's less sketchy.  After 6pm you won't have to pay for the meters.\n\nONLINE ORDERING\nI haven't tried this feature, but I've seen that they offer this on Yelp.

But, just figured not for me, oh well.  \n\nWell several years later having moved into the neighborhood I figured I would give it another chance and order something else.  I got the chicken korma.  More like bone korma.  First.....I've eaten at a lot of Indian restaurants and NEVER had bones in korma, masala, or butter chicken, basically never in any dish that is really saucy.  Well good thing I didn't just bite in and I like to shred up the chicken so it can get all saucy.  I could have really hurt myself.  I would think in a dish that's all sauce you should note if there are bones.  Besides just not expecting there to be bones in it, it was a LOT of bone.  I took a photo and that's sans one bone that I tossed in the trash when I found it.  So, a good 30% of what I got was bones.  Though it turned out to be a good thing I was sorting through my food, there was a giant dark thing which I cut into and assume is the fenugreek pod.  Holy crap, glad I didn't chomp on that.

With a hint of smoke in the air, the noise level was high as I sat among many large groups and South Asian families with small children. Their service protocol required me to stand in line to order by the kitchen and then return to the same spot to pay once the meal was finished. \n\nI thought my chicken tikka masala ($6.49) was fulfilling due to the thick creamy Bombay sauce with seven thick pieces of white meat chicken that embodied a faint smoky taste. The cream sauce was a bit sweeter than desired and it would have tasted better if the spices were more potent and penetrating. Luckily I asked for the dish to come spicy to meet my palate interested, and even at that the side plate of raw onions among the fresh vegetables were sharper and robust in flavor. My side order of rice ($1) was nicely seasoned and onion naan ($1.99) was a huge heaping piece of bread with nice crisp and fluffy texture.\n\nIt was overall a good portion and good value experience but I've certainly had better. I would only come back when I'm in the area and will likely to skip their curry for kabab and tandoori items instead.", "author": "Daniel L."}

While it is no longer the hole-in-the-wall place anymore, we still go there whenever we get an opportunity.\n\nMy favorites are Chicken Tandoori leg, Fish Tandoori, Chicken saag, and Chicken Sheesh Kabobs.  \n\nIn the last 2 years, I have noticed that occasionally, the taste quality will go down.  When that happens, i am prompt in letting the owner/son know, and they are good about listening to my opinion. \n\nI have been to Shalimar restaurant too (in that area), and I prefer Chutney because the food contains less oil.

A bit crowded too. (Totally worth it, though. Plus: there's always take-out!)\n\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nSomosas (potato, peas and spices stuffed in a thick folded dough, then fried)\n\nPompadoms (super thin crispy 'wafers' dotted with fennel seeds)\n\nChicken Tikka Masala (white meat tandoori chicken cooked in a thick red creamy sauce, tastes a bit tomato sauce-y and yogurty)\n\nBodi Chicken (tandoori chicken, breast meat chunks served with sliced onions and lemons with a savory thin \"sauce\" and chopped cilantro\n\nAloo Mattar (potatoes and peas in a flavorful curry sauce)\n\nPlain Naan (soft and tender flat bread)\n\nGarlic Naan (flat bread topped minced garlic and cilantro)\n\nWe loved everything. We(2 of us) actually were able to make 5 meals out of what we got--- and we were ravenous when we first tucked into our hot, fresh food so it's not like we were eating like birds or anything.\n\nI was a little less enthusiastic about the Chicken Tikka Masala. I found it a little too creamy and felt like some of the flavor was a little diluted. But not bad at all. It was still  yummy. \n\nThe Bodi Chicken was fantastic!! Only drawback? The to-go container was the soft papery kind (great for the environment and ideal when used properly) and all the liquid slowly absorbed into it and dissolved out. Fortunately we put napkins under it in anticipation. Missed dipping chicken into that liquid though. \n\nAloo Mattar was incredible. This isn't one of my commonly ordered entrees but it is one of my favorites and Chutney did it so well. No hint of bitterness (from using too-old spices) as is occasionally found. A touch of sweetness and a lot of seasoning. \n\nThe somosas weren't the best I've ever had but they were up there. I like mine not too spicy and seasoned heavily and these fit the bill. Great dipped in tamarind sauce or the green chutney stuff. \n\nThe pompadoms were pretty good. I ordered them more for nostalgia than anything. \n\nThe Garlic Naan was the best I've EVER had. Crunchy. Garlicy. Cilantroy. Soooo Flavorful. Sooooo Good with the food. Order 2.\n\nSo.... Here's the thing. I almost didn't come here. In fact I was going to go to their main competitor (so I assume: Shalimar) because soooo many people complained of a rude guy in a Giants hat. Well people: He was not there today. Or if he was, he was hatless and nice as can be. :P I chose Chutney over the other in the end because a lot of yelpers said the other place was greasy and had tiny bits of meat. \n\nChutney had generous, flavorful portions. I would be happy to go here again. However I have one little annoyance: Rice didn't come with my dishes and it wasn't obvious until we were far away. So if you want basmati rice, make sure you order it. \n\nFor what it's worth I've eaten Indian all across the country and this is a standout establishment, food wise. I will be back here on my next visit to the area. My guy even said to me \"Do you think we should start ordering more Indian food back home?\" Does it get better than that? \n\nTo the yelpers: I love ya'll but if an employee is rude to you please don't just write a review... Call the management and let them know. If someone lies to you: give management an opportunity to resolve it. If someone is not polite: talk about it with someone who can do something about it. Don't just diss the place and close the book forever. You're short changing yourself in the end. -Usually- owners and mangers do care and would like to know if their staff is turning people off.", "author": "Nika T."}

So, when I venture over the hill, I almost always try to convince my fellow diners that we must have an Indian feast, which is precisely what I did the night that Chutney happened.\n\nIt's a walk up and order, eat your food, get your own Chai, and then pay at the end kind of place, which I generally prefer over fancier sit down Indian restaurants.  \n\nTwo of us shared the Chicken Tikka Masala, Lamb Vindaloo, plain naan, and rice.  The CTM was very tasty, but it lacked the spice I was looking for and the chicken was a tad overcooked and a bit dry as a result.  The lamb on the other hand was delicious!  The fall apart when you try to pick it up, perfect amount of spicy kind of lamb dish that I love.  The kind of spice that you and your date can bond over because your nose is starting to drip in your food.  And the kind that when you are left alone at the table with only a little bit left, you quickly finish everything before your friend can return...classy, I know.  \n\nWith so many Indian places in the area (seriously probably four on this block), I would be tempted to try others, but would definitely return for another meal at Chutney.", "author": "Josie S."}

The chicken was so tender and the sauce was amazing.  It was so tasty that I drank the sauce.  Yes.  I drank it like it was Gatorade. I don't care if the cream clogs up my already cholesterol laden blood vessels. The naan was so soft, fluffy and had the perfect amount of garlic.  The rice was perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nThe first time I went there, they didn't put enough chicken in my chicken tikka masala.  That didn't bother me because the sauce was extremely yummy.  We ate there after a night at Bourbon and Branch and I must say that the Chutney cashier was much more pleasant than our Bourbon and Branch server.  The Chutney guy was super nice and the restaurant looked really clean.\n\nToday was a different  experience, but pleasant nonetheless.  I ordered my meal to go and the guy who took my order was so kind enough to ask what time I will be picking it up because he wanted to make sure that my order was made fresh and that it is hot when I pick it up. Bonus: They gave me a lot more chicken in my order.  I'm definitely going to be a regular here.", "author": "Shirleyanne A."}

Totally has the feel of a somewhat-divy no-frills type of place. You enter, order at the counter, find your own seating, and they bring it out. Takes some time, but that's because it's made fresh. And it is delish! Tandoori chicken was super tasty. And the portion is big (we ordered two pieces, but shared only one). The naan was also fresh out of the oven. Overall, the food was very very good. Authentic.\n\nMy only complaint is that when we asked for wine glasses (we brought a bottle with us) we got plastic cups. Yet, somehow the table next to us actually got wine glasses. What's that about??? Did we not appear worthy of actual wine glasses?!! Such service would probably prevent me from going back in the future.", "author": "Judi B."}

It has never been one either. Once I and my friends are seated, we place our order at the cash counter. Grab the number and some bottomless, complementary chai with it. The food was served promptly to our table.\n\nA must have at Chutney is their Chicken Tikka Masala. Creamy, sweet, spicy and just a notch tangy, at $6.49 it is by far the most succulent Chicken Tikka Masala I have ever tasted.\n\nAlong with it we ordered a Chicken Seekh Kabab and a Tandoori Chicken for $2.99 each. While the Chicken seekh kabab, which is ground chicken marinated in spices and cooked in a clay oven on skewers, was juicy and tender the Tandoori Chicken seemed a little dry and chewy. \n\nTo go with that we ordered Butter Garlic Naans, for just $2.00 each, perfect to soak up the awesome Tikka Masala sauce with!

You may find a star anise here and there but that doesn't bother me.\n\nBengan bharta- Mesquite smoked eggplant cooked with onions, tomatoes and spices. I've had several different veggie dishes and this one stands out as the best in flavors and I like that it has a kick to it. \n\nTandoori fish- hands down, one of my favorite dishes of all times. The fish comes out of the clay oven smoking hot, so you may need to wait for it to cool down a bit before digging in. The fish they use for this particular dish is very fatty, so I can't help myself but to suck on all the goodness.\n\nGarlic naan- good\n\nMy only negative is the chicken tikka masala, which changed within the past year or so.

Upon returning to our table, we watched the server casually bring over the same plates that had been sitting there.

Anything with tikka masala is pretty good. The chana masala is super tasty, as is the bengan bhartha. The spinach and potato curry is spiced a little differently than other places, but it's also less greasy and has more flavor.\n\nI've noticed that if you call in an order for carry out and they tell you it will be ready in 10-15 minutes, they almost always have your food bagged up and waiting for you at the counter when you walk in. If you're eating in, it seems like you wait a bit longer for your food.\n\nOn a recent visit, I got some karayla masala, which is bitter gourd or bittermelon. Compared to other times I've had bitter gourd, this tasted a lot less bitter. I think the spices did a good job of both highlighting the slight bitterness but also mellowing it out so that it didn't activate my gag reflex. At first, it was reminiscent of chayote, but the more I ate, the more I could taste the bitterness. Oddly enough, it was really quite pleasant, which I can't say for most of my bitter gourd experiences. I'll have to order it again to make sure it wasn't a fluke, but if this is what bittermelon can be like, then perhaps I've found a new favorite dish.", "author": "Kristina L."}

On the other hand my wife liked her samosas and the naan was decent.\n\nService: The restaurant is disorganized; with no service. They don't explicitly tell people that you don't need to wait in line to pay, but you need to line up when you order. One man answers the phone, takes orders and payments, and seats customers: the line is long. We had to ask a confused bus boy to remove the prior patron's food and dishes from our table.

It's in a bad part of town and it's quite plain inside, but the food is always great.  I go threre with friends often.  We order:  Benghan Birtha, Gobi Aloo, Veggie tikka masala, Tandoori fish and tandoori chicken, plus other stuff.  And rice and various naans.  Chutney is at a good price point.  If you go there, you'll see moslty indians and pakistanis, so you know that the food is authentic and good, and well-priced.  Highest recommendation.

What are the chances anyone will read this? Anyone?\n\nFor those that don't know the difference between Indian and Pakistani restaurant, here goes:\n\nIndian restaurants do not serve beef or cow meat. Pakistani restaurants do. Having said that, there are some recipes that are always better at an Indian restaurant and vice versa.\n\nSo I went to this place after reading rave reviews of the Chicken Tikka Masala and was thoroughly disappointed. This is a Pakistani restaurant and yet again, the proof was in the pudding ... well ... Chicken Tikka Masala. It was just not that good. For that matter, neither was the Chicken Tandoori. \n\nThe naan was amazing and the Seekh Kabab was delicious, but name one Pakistani restaurant that doesn't get those two dishes right. \n\nPerhaps I am being harsh. Maybe I should have tried the Chicken Karhai or the Haleem or even the Nihari - the latter two being exclusively Pakistani dishes.  \n\nAnyway I thought this place was below average. Even the so called mango ice-cream they served was awful (it was vanilla with mango flavor and not in a good way).\n\nFor those that don't know, there is no service at this place. You place the order at the counter and they bring it to you, similar to other Pakistani restaurants in the area. \n\nWith Pakwan and Shalimar across the street from this place, I opt for any of those three over Chutney.", "author": "Faisal L."}

We were in the city on Christmas day and ended up at Chutney based on their high yelp rating.\n\nWe ordered, found an unclean table in the packed restaurant and sat down. After 10mins of waiting, our table was finally cleaned. The cleaning was of course not thorough and some spoons and napkins were left behind under the table. I was willing to forgive them as all I wanted was some exceptional grub. Our 15mins of wait turned into 30mins. A larger table seated after us were also served food meanwhile. We kept waiting for 10mins more, after about 45mins of wait we finally asked the server if it would take longer. They had clearly forgotten us. We got our dishes in a couple of minutes after we asked.I can understand where they are coming from and service was clearly not their strong point. I was only looking for top notch food and did not care about the rest.\n\nAnyway, the food arrived and the first thing I noticed were tomatoes in the biryani!! I tried to calm myself down hoping the tomatoes in their biryani elevated it somehow. Anyway, all they did was turn parts of the biryani they came in contact with into absolute mush. The chicken in the biryani had 80% bone and it was tough hunting for some meat. The only positive was that the little meat was falling off the bones easily, implying it was extremely well cooked.Taste wise it can best be termed bland.\n\nWe also got the special of the day- achari murgh, some chicken sheesh kebab and garlic naan. The naan was non greasy, fresh and soft. The sheesh kebabs were crying for some extra kick. The achari murgh was not too greasy and definitely tasted like achari murgh. The only negative I could find in the curry was the excessive use of whole peppercorns and coriander seeds. It is definitely nice to get some whole spices once every few bites. But, 5 of them in every mouthful is not good. The positive was that the chicken was easily falling off the bones like the chicken in the biryani.", "author": "Minu M."}

It was about 7pm when we walked in the door and were able to sit down right away.\n\nWe went for the basics:\n\ntwo orders of chicken tikka masala with rice\ntwo mango lassi\n\nThe flavor of the chicken tikka masala was so good. This was my first time, but my bf had claimed it was the \"best chicken tikka masala ever\". I can understand why he claims it as so because the flavor was spot on. The chicken, however, was pretty dry. Even between the two bowls there was some inconsistency. So I'm holding out hope that the next time we go, the chicken will be tender and juicy. \n\nThe mango lassi (lassis? how do you pluralize that?) were HUGE. And only $2.50 if memory serves me right. After destroying the tikka masala, the mango lassi was a lovely dessert/drink to finish it off. Filled me to the brim, too.\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty sure this will be a new staple in my diet when I'm up in the city.", "author": "Alison C."}

The tandoori chicken is very good and becomes even better when you squeeze a little lemon juice on it. It's one of the better tandoori chickens I've had. The chicken tiki masala was disappointing though, it tasted like it was cooked in tomato soup - not something I'd order again. We also ordered the palak paneer which had a strange consistency because the spinach was pureed, but it tasted good and was a great dip for the naan. \n\nThere is water in the back as well as chai, but the tea is watery so I skipped it.\n\nIn terms of value, the prices are right for the food you get and is in line or more inexpensive than other places nearby. I'd rate it as a pretty good value.\n\nI almost ordered the goat brain masala but random images of mad cow disease and the scene from indian jones where they eat monkey brains flashed through my head and I chickened out. Maybe next time. \n\nI'd give Chutney 3.5 stars if I could, unfortunately I can't. There isn't enough to give then 4 stars, so 3 they get.", "author": "Russ C."}

I'm told it will be 10-15 minutes. \n\n8:45PM: Fifteen minutes later, I arrive at Chutney. I'm told my order will be done shortly. I'm double parked, so I decide to find a real parking spot for my car, but the Chutney manager tells me it will probably be OK (glad I did not take his advice). \n\n9:05PM: Food is finally ready, but I notice that the mint chutney sauce has exploded out of its container all over the bag. Chutney manager says he will fix it. I see him dish out a new container of rice. The cashier won't let me pay at this point even though I want to get out the door because he can't recall how much my bill is and won't tally it up again since the manager already did it. \n\n9:10PM: Finally get my food and pay and on my way. This is a full 40 minutes after I called and 25 minutes after the promised time. Out the door, I notice that the chutney sauce is still all over the bag. Ugh. \n\n9:25PM: Arrive home to see that the mint chutney sauce has seeped inside two dishes that I ordered, and there's pretty much unwanted sauce everywhere. \n\nAlso, the bengan bharta (eggplant) turned out pretty gross. \n\nChutney: I am so glad you are busy and your business is thriving, but why are you so inconsistent?? When you're on, you're really on, but when you're off, it's really horrible. \n\nDon't set expectations that it will be 10-15 minutes, when it's more like 45 minutes. All would be forgiven if the service was better - maybe a smile and \"sorry it's taking so long\" or actually caring that the sauces didn't explode all over my dinner and fixing it. Or even if the food was top notch, then I could forgive all these missteps but sadly, it's not tonight. \n\nI hope you fix your glitches.

I always order it with a side of Garlic Naan for dipping! So BOMB!\n\n The Seekh Kabab is a tender skewer of ground beef cooked in a clay oven that goes perfectly with their sauces, specially the sweet plum sauce!\n\nThe Keema Naan is really good too, its a Naan stuffed with flavorful ground beef. Perfect as a side order!\nThe other day, I ordered the Rice PUllao-- basmati rice with saffron, its a better option than their plain rice.\n\nThe only bad part is that some dishes are way too spicy. My mouth has been on fire--literally, felt like I was drinking lighter fluid and I had to drink a gallon of water to cool off-- specially with the Lentils (Daal Masala) and the Garbanzo beans (Chana Masala).

You get your drinks yourself (pop, a pitcher of water, delicious hot chai) unless you order a different drink like Mango Lassi. A can of pop is only $1 and Mango Lassi is $2!\n\nWe ordered naan, palak paneer, chicken korma curry, and aloo ghobi. The meal also came with a plate of lettuce, tomatoes, and lemon for the table? But it didn't look like a salad, more like toppings for a burger? We didn't touch it and noticed most other tables didn't either. Anyway, the food came out after about 15 minutes and it was amazing! The spices they used were perfect, not underwhelming and not sweating-like-a-waterfall spicy. The palak paneer was different, it was more like pureed spinach with the same consistency of baby food. Nonetheless, it was still really good, just a weird consistency that I've never had in a palak/saag paneer dish. $27 for a meal for 3 people was pretty awesome too.

It's extremely saucy (SAUCY!) so I wound up taking advantage of the bread and rice far more than other restaurants with a similar dish. This is quite ok though cause the Tikka Masala sauce is tasty awesome in a dish.\n\nService is done a bit weirdly here... you order at a counter and then sit down, with a waiter bringing your food out. The issue is you don't actually pay until you're done eating. Because of the way it's set up, it's pretty easy to not actually pay and walk out. It's definitely a bit odd and easy to forget that you didn't pay at the counter. Make sure you do though!

Plain Naan (Bread) is yummy and it cost $1. Ooh I must mention the Kebab (seikh Kebab) only $1.99 best spicy kebab you'll ever eat. Their Food is addictive. Folks if you're feeling down & life isn't treating you right, Go to Chutney it will give you hope.", "author": "Bara N."}

I point this out only to establish a pattern in which Chutney blows the roof off its competitors in this curry-rich region of San Francisco. The ordering process is straightforward in its efficiency. Look at the laminated menu, place your order with the handsome, smiling man (he struck me as a South Asian Jesus) behind the counter and take your plastic number to your table. \r\n\r\nTry and fetch your own silverware, napkins and water tureen and you will be gently nudged back to your table - they've got this part covered and will bring everything you need to you. Food arrives in a timely manner and is for the most part delicious - especially considering the price.", "author": "Miriam W."}

The gentleman running the cash register never offered to help us (after 8 minutes) until a customer waiting in line to pay for his meal said, \"Are you going to help those people first?\" He also took one order and a party of four's money (who cut in front of us) first as well. Didn't start us off with the feeling like we were welcome and we should have taken the hint.\n\nHe then took our order and pointed to the back where the water and table service was. We took our number, got ourselves water and service, found a table up front and then waited ....and waited ....and waited while we watched people who ordered after us get table service, drinks, salad and tea brought to them.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes we politely asked if our food was coming up. He said he'd check and then disappeared and never came back to tell us how much longer it would be. 10 minutes later we started seeing people who ordered after us get their warm food.\n\nMy husband asked one of the servers if our food was coming out pointing to our number and the server didn't even look at my husband or the number; he just walked right past him like he wasn't even there. We grabbed our coats and walked out. \n\nWe were disappointed as Chutney looked like a very tasty place to eat and we sure were hungry (especially after walking in the door 35 minutes beforehand).

Samosas, naan, and lamb vindaloo.\n\nWhen I arrived, the place had a good number of people enjoying food, which is always a good sign. I was quoted a quick EPT of 15mins, but wasn't able to get to the restaurant for about an hour due to an unplanned shopping trip; so I'm hoping this is the reason why my to-go bag was waiting for me on an unoccupied table near the register, rather than behind the counter? This was my first visit here, so perhaps they use that area regularly for pickups. But, I'm happy to report, this was the only raised eyebrow moment I had during my experience.\n\nTo the food:\nSamosas (2/order) were a filling, hefty size (compared to other places) filled with soft potatoes, peas and a nice blend of spices for flavor. The sauce had that nice sweet 'n sour taste that makes the samosas that much more delicious.\n\nNaan, oh naan, oh.naan! It's really good. There's two other places in the immediate area and I'm willing to bet dollaz that this place has the best naan. Soft (even when it's not straight out of the oven hot) and fluffy. mmmmmm.\n\nMy lamb vindaloo was also good. Though, I think because it had to be packed to-go, there was something to be desired that I can't quite put my finger on. The lamb was tender and soft off the bone, and there wasn't too much fat to pick around on the bone. The potatoes were good and the sauce was tasty as well.", "author": "Jamie T."}

Well I went back to my fav place, Lahore Karahi and they too have the same set of seeds and cinnamon stick spices, but the difference is that they are not broken up in the rice. So, I was ignorant in my review below on some levels and changed my rating from a 1 to a 3, because the food at Chutney was good, but the service sucked and the broken up sticks of wood were in bad form. But now I know, that those seasonings are typical and etc. etc.\n\nSo, there.\n\n***********************************\n\nBad Review ahead...\n\nMe and my girlfriend went here after taking in West Side Story during the day. Lahore Karahi was closed for Halloween partying I'm guessing, so we stood in front of this place and the restaurant across the street from it trying to decide. We went with this one because it appeared to be better than the other visually. \n\nWhen we went in we ordered at the counter and sat down. The tables were dirty and food was on the chairs. I know that sometimes bussers will wipe off tables and food goes on the chairs, so no big whoop, but figured I'd mention the messy display.\n\nThen we were brought the weird plate of crappy iceburg lettuce and vegetables that were not appealing. \n\nWe ordered Veggie Korma, Veggie Biryani, Chana Masala and Garlic Naan.\n\nWe got up and grabbed our own drinks and the server brought us a pitcher of water and glasses.\n\nFirst, let me say that everything TASTED just fine. Actually pretty good, even the Naan.\n\nWe began to eat and after a few bites into my Biryani I bit something hard and nearly broke a tooth. I stopped chewing, started getting really freaked out, not knowing what was now in my mouth. I tried to be as casual as I could in spitting it into my hand and placing it on my table for examination. After I put it  on the corner of my plate to examine it, it appeared to be a piece of wood. I cleaned it off well with my napkin and it was. Almost like a popsicle stick shard of some sort, but it was darker in color. Then I broke it in half, just to confirm, IT WAS WOOD. Not some spice or something that I was misunderstanding.\n\nAt that point I was shellshocked. I began to examine the plate of Biryani more closely. I found more pieces of weird wood chips. My girlfriend suggested maybe they were spices, I pondered that idea, but thought it would be weird to leave such a thing in food and allow your customer the potential to get stabbed by the wood or damage their teeth. \n\nI continued to dig. \n\nI then found 2 very large seeds. I would say that they were near the size of a peach seed, but smaller, but larger thn an apricot seed. This seed was definitely covered in some sort of spices or something, it was very dark and gooey. I picked those out. Then I noticed in the mix of rice and veggies there were a large amount of whole cloves. Hard cloves, not soft and cooked like on a ham, these were straight up hard and unpleasant. \n\nI was flipping out in my head, so I called over the waiter and asked him what that stuff was, he looked at me and barely even gave it a thought and said \"Spices\" and just walked away without allowing anymore discussion. \n\nI'm never going here again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-06", "description": "We found this place from a recommendation by our cab driver when we arrived in San Francisco.  When the rain started falling just around lunch time, we ducked into Chutney for a quick bite and a place to wait out the weather, and we were quite pleased.  The service is fast-food fast, but the quality of the food is far above.\n\nWhen you go in, you order at the counter and are given a number for your order - menus are at the counter, and then you can sit at any table.  We sat down and waited only a few minutes (during which time they brought us water - including a pitcher for us to refill our drinks on our own - and a little salad plate to split) for the food to arrive.  Very prompt service, and the staff was all friendly as well.\n\nI'm not quite sure what makes an Indian/Pakistani restaurant different from a regular Indian restaurant, but the difference in the food here compared to other Indian places we've gone was mainly in the texture of the sauce.  I got the mattar paneer, and my husband got the goat curry, and both sauces were thinner than we usually see with these dishes.  Honestly, I think I prefer the thicker sauces, but these were not quite as heavy, so we didn't leave the restaurant feeling overly full. Also, we didn't get to specify the spiciness of the dishes, and mine wound up being quite mild, while my husband's was pretty spicy.  The mattar paneer had tomatoes in the sauce, which I haven't seen before.\n\nSince we wanted to be able to do a fair comparison of the place, we got their vegetable samosas, and they were great.  Crispy outside, thick filling, and perfect with the tamarind sauce.  We also got garlic naan, which was huge and delicious.  Tons of garlic flavor, so I was sold.\n\nI liked the fact that the portions were more manageable than a lot of Indian restaurants, since we're staying at a hotel and couldn't really bring back leftovers.  And you can beat the prices here: two entrees, bread, and samosas were less than $25.  I would also imagine this would be a good place for takeout, especially if you were in a rush.\n\nI did find it a little weird to go back up to the counter after we finished eating (you pay at the end of your meal at the same place you ordered), and the area of town is a little sketchy depending on the time of day, but overall, we were glad we checked it out!", "author": "Jenn T."}

We also had a goat curry (I don't eat 4 legged things, so I didn't taste it, but my wife thought it was very good), and chicker cholley (this is not a typo - it's \"chicker\", and it's completely different from a dish called \"cholley chicken\"), which was an excellent chicken/chick pea dish. The chicken cholley was unlike anything I'd had before because the chicken was somehow blended into the dish so it added flavor, but no discernable texture. I'm not sure whether that sounds appetizing or not, but I was really glad we got it and I'd definitely get it again.\n\nWe enjoyed the free chai, which was unsweetened so we could adjust to our desired level of sweetness.\n\nThe owner's son took our order and was very friendly and helpful when we asked questions about the specials, and overall made us feel really welcome.

What's different compare to all the other Pakistani-indian restaurant  is that they give you free veggies or salad if you want to call them, so it is good to have something on the side to gulp all the food down. The service is usually good unless if you come during dinner or peak hours, but this is never a problem. The food comes fast and the price is very reasonable.

Instead, they really increased the spinach to paneer ratio and it wound up more like lamb with mustard greens.\n\nMy friend ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which was much much better. The curry was thick and creamy as well as sweet and tangy. It just hugged and smothered every grain of rice you poured it on. They didn't add in too much chicken, but it didn't matter because the curry itself was definitely the highlight. Both of us also each had an order of garlic naan, which came out hot and fluffy, with a hearty helping of that garlic flavor.\n\nRegardless of how you think the food tastes, the food is undeniably very cheap.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-05", "description": "Is it possible to  eat good indian/pakistan food at more than reasonable prices? Chutney definitely shows that \"yes, it is!\"\nThe place is big, quite caotic and doesn't look particularly attractive, if not for the open kitchen where the frenzy and accurate work of the south american (in an indian restaurant ???) cooks can  be admired by the enthusiastic clients. A little annoying thing is that you have to order by yourself, as you would do in a crowded pub, but, ehi!, the little effort is well rewarded by the averagely very good food quality.  \n\nBeing my first time here and the menu so huge, I ordered two main dishes: lamb with lentils and chicken strips with mixed vegetables (mainly mushroom and paprika). On the one hand, chicken and lentils were both very tasty and well balanced in terms of spices. On the other hand, I was rather disappointed by the lamb: way too greasy, probably cooked too fast and definitely not melting in the mouth ... I can tell I have had much better \"indian\" lamb than this in the past. \n\nTogether with my  main dishe(s) I also took naan bread stuffed with spicy ground beef which was pretty well done. My girlfriend took mixed vegetables with curry which was good, with a surprisingly light but flavourful sauce. \n\nSomething that I really loved was the mango lassi I took as drink ... actually I took two of them, the second one as \"dessert\", in order to recover from the \"shock\" of knowing that they did not have kulfi, the indian \"nutty\" ice-cream  that I simply adore.\n\nIn summary, despite some imperfection,  I believe Chutney deserves a 4-star rating (maximum), since the ratio quality/price is considerably high. I'm sure I'll come some more times. However, for romantic dinners full of indian flavours and attention to all culinary details I would head somewhere else.", "author": "Andrea L."}

The food, the best way to describe it is uninspired.  Now I'm not Gordon Ramsey, but that was really the only word that I could come up with to describe it.  Garlic Naan tasty but undercooked.  Shrimp Tikka Massala tasted like creamy tomato soup that needed more seasoning and salt (odd - another yelper said their food was too salty).  It contained 5 large shrimp that were overcooked.  Their chutneys...aside from being in squeeze bottles, were watery and not really that tasty.  Their samosas were fried to perfection, but the filling was a bit flavorless.\n\nSo, the price is right,..but the food is WRONG, bitch.\n\nPS - I'm quoting a movie here, not calling the owners of Chutney bitches.", "author": "Michael C."}

I am unsure as to what piqued my interest, but there I was - in the sketchiest neighborhood of all of San Francisco (Tenderloin) traversing about to suddenly encounter Chutney.\n\nThe first time I went there, I ordered beef kabobs with pita, some type of okra dish, and maybe dal. Not to mention the prerequisites with every order - rice and naan. The food was SOOOOOO good. And SOOOO cheap! I swear that my partner and I ordered everything to our heart's delight, and our bill was less than $20. The food was spicy, but not too spicy. It was flavorful in the way I wish everything was flavorful - not one spice playing a major role. All the spices working together as a team to bring out the innate flavors of the vegetables and meats. Ahhh - it was delightful\n\nI don't think you can go wrong ordering anything off of the menu, so be as conservative or adventurous as you like. Portion size was also nice. The interior was comfortable - not elegant by any means, but comfortable. Service wasn't particularly memorable, but for the price you're paying, you can't expect a lot.

If you come on Saturday night, don't expect good service, and don't expect to get your food under 45 minutes. Sit as far away from the kitchen as possible, otherwise you'll walk out stinking like oil and smoke. And if there are friends of the owner who walks in after you, expect to get served AFTER them. And expect the server and cooks to appear frazzled and unfocused, which causes everything in the system to run extra slow. Other than that, the taste of the food is okay. At least they use authentic spices. I think the trick is to order at the counter before you get seated.", "author": "John R."}

It was after lunch but before dinner and many places were closed so I wandered from the Civic Center to this even more savory area of town. I had heard great things about Shalimar, and was on my way over but I saw Chutney, looking a lot cleaner, lively, and more inviting (dont get me wrong, i love dirty, uninviting places, and I will try Shalimar soon) So I ordered the cheesse naan, shrimp tikki massala and the mattar paneer (My all time fav dish). The guy behind the counter was super nice and friendly. I then hightailed it back to my office to stink up mu cubicle with ethnic food.  Of course the food was piping hot and needed a good while to cool down. But the naan was excellent and when the food cooled down I was very happy with both dishes especially the tikki massala shrimp.", "author": "Chelsey G."}

Tandoori Chicken: Chicken is delicious, spiced well and has that nice char flavor that would have you ordering a second helping. \n\nThese three dishes alone will make you come begging for more.

Sorry if this review isn't as detailed. Chutney is another great tasting, no fuss Indian spot. I love when you're with a big group because you get to dig into lots of people's dishes haha. This turned out to be a great thing because while everyone else's dinner was tasty (hence 4 stars!), I was quite displeased with my own.   \n\nI got a pretty typical Indian dish, the Palak Paneer. It's basically spinach cooked with spices and home made Indian cheese. Usually it's one of my favorites but Chutney's version was a bit unappetizing. Instead of chopping up the spinach, they pureed it. And it wasn't just pureed spinach but pureed spinach with the spices and even some of the cheese. WHY?! I felt like I was eating baby barf. I know it all goes down the same but while I'm eating, I like a bit of texture. \n\nWhile my curry was disappointing, I'd like to note that the Naan and Roti are super fluffy and hot. MMMM!

Strong, exotic flavors and very affordable prices make this a great place for you and some buddies, although I wouldn't take a date here.\n\nWhen you walk into the place, the smell of spices will wash over you to reassure you that they don't skimp out on those ingredients even though the prices are so low. I like my food mild, and too many other places equate \"mild\" with \"make it more bland,\" so I really appreciate that they successfully use lots of spices while still having the heat level stay mild.\n\nThe portion sizes are more than satisfactory for me, but since I'm a relatively light eater compared to most of my friends, that probably means that most people would consider the portions to be medium or medium-small. However, since the vast majority of their curries are in the $6.50-7.00 range, I still think that the price-to-amount ratio is very good.\n\nThat being said, you do need to pay extra for rice and naan bread, which will bring your total up to about $10. You can probably share rice with a friend though, or two friends if you stretch it carefully.\n\nAlso, soda drinkers, be aware that you'll be paying $1 for a can of soda, no refills. Your table will get a big pitcher of water that they'll keep full for free, but still, I'm always a little sad when places don't have free refills.", "author": "James L."}

It's pretty much the premier spot for consistently good Pakistani fare at a very reasonable price. Just last night, I had dinner for less than $8, with hot, fresh, aloo (potato) naan, tandoori chicken and a drink. These guys are well known for their Butter Chicken, aka Chicken Tikka Masala, a dish with chunks of spicy barbecue chicken swimming in a creamy, lightly spiced and fragrant sauce. It goes best with their fluffy naan, cooked in a clay oven. You can also get traditional Pakistani favorites like Biryani, Nihari, and some fresh takes on the classics, like Chicken Jalfrezi. But be forewarned: although this place is a smallish, cheap spot, do not consider this a fast food joint. Service is attentive, yet food is slow.

On busy nights, you might have to wait a while, but you will not be disappointed. \n\nIndian classics such as Chicken Tikka Masala, Garlic Naan, and Mango Lassi are always available and delicious as ever. The Chicken Tikka Masala was perhaps too sweet for my taste on my most recent visit but the saffron-spiced rice helped balance the meal out. \n\nChutney is a comfortable place to take family and have a satiating meal. While you should expect a long wait during weekend evenings, you will ultimately be satisfied by their simple, affordable, and authentic approach to Indian food.", "author": "Seth F."}

This is a solid choice to go soak up your booozed self after a few rounds at B&B next door.\n\nWalk on up to the counter, super patient as we scan the menu. 2 entrees, 2 flavored naan's, they help us find the only free table in the joint, and give us a number. Later on we get water and a plate with iceburg lettuce, onions, tomatoes and lemons. I'm hungry so I decide it's my salad and dig in avoiding the onions.\n\nAh, the tikka masala sauce. Rich and tomatoey with a wonderful heat to it. It was like eating the most delicious cream of tomato soup ever. I was seriously having to refrain myself from licking the plate. We also ordered another curry of some sort that had a nice sweetness and all spiceish flavor. Both the Naan's were hot, a little crispy on the outside and nice and doughey on the inside. Mmmm, a perfect meal for a cool Autumn evening.\n\nSatisfied but not stuffed we return to the counter to pay. Under 20 dollars! I was thrilled. So satisfying and good deal to boot. I want to try a few more plates, if they all add up we're in 5 star land.\n\nFriendly, festive atmosphere.

Once word is out that a place kicks ass (see: 4 star average or higher after 200+ reviews), you can almost guarantee a certain level of snobbishness. Maybe the employees here are jaded from being in this part of town too long, fending off tranny hooker syringe fiends; or maybe they know it ain't their cheerful service that keeps customers wanting more. Either way, your attitude stinks like the homeless tranquilized cat I tripped over on the way in! A bit of advice to newbies...\n\nI've never been to a place where you order at a counter, take a number to a table of your choice, have a waiter bring your food, eat, wait, drink some water, wait, then realize your check isn't coming anytime soon. You sit there clueless, wondering how/when/where to pay. Whaaa? I have to take my number back to the counter, where I ordered, and pay after I eat? Do I tip? Who and where? Is this some kind of test?\n\nYou better know the routine before stepping inside because you will get no help from the help. No sir, nuh-uh, not in the Tenderloin. Follow procedure or I will bust a cap in your Tikka Masala loving ass! Foo!\n\nMmm... speaking of Tikka Masala... oh my! Just like Grandma used to make.* I would pass on the smoked eggplant dish next time - too spicy and mushy. Garlic Naan for a buck, nothin' wrong with that!\n\nDon't walk, RUN to Chutney. Delish Indian/Pakistani/Halal food (whatever the crap Halal is??) at an unbeatable price. It is perfectly Tenderloinesque, with an even balance of sidewalk crackies, little to no eye contact with strangers, and lost, frightened Union Square tourists.\n\n\n\n*I am totally podunk.

Perfect time for some Indian food! \nThe first thing I noticed about this place, is that it felt classier (is that the right word?) than the other fast food Indian places in the city. \nWe ordered mixed veggie korma, palek paneer, chicken korma, a prawn curry, veggie samosas, some kind of lamb sausage, rice, plain naan, and a naan stuffed with meat. \n\nThe food was brought to our table very quickly. The veggie korma was good, not as creamy as I've had it at other places. But still very good and tasted fresh. The palek paneer, I would recommend passing on. It was too pureed. I like to see some spinach in my palek paneer, but this was just like a light green runny soup. And the cubes of cheese in it, were not flavorful at all. The whole dish tasted like it needed salt. \nThe veggie samosas were tasty. Fried food, can't go wrong with that. \n\nAnd the meat eaters in the group enjoyed their meats dishes, especially the naan filled with meat. I think that was the favorite surprise of the night. \n\nChutney feels much cleaner and less greasier than other places like Shalimar. The food tasted fresher and less heavy. Although as I write this review, it is the day after that meal, and I still feel full of Indian food. Don't know if that's a good or bad thing....Also it was nice to not feel rushed to order and rushed to grab a table and then rushed to eat and get up and clear the table for other customers. It was a leisurely eating experience. I think we were in there for about 2 hours. I'd definitely go back again.\n\nThe prices are great, all dishes, 3 drinks and tip: $60 for 4 people.", "author": "Caroline C."}

The guy who took my order frankly could care less, he was more interested in his Iphone, but he was polite, just distracted.  \n        To sit and watch the cooks work is a double-edged sword: It is interesting to watch them put meat and bread in and out of these hot tandoor ovens, but as you sit there the aromas just soak into your clothes, hair, any exposed area of your body.  I sit here and still smell the spices and the food has been put away.\n        Bottom line, go if you are in the area.  I would not drive from Oakland just for this, but if you are in the City and hungry for some great Indian food come on by.  I dont care what the negative reviewers say, this place has it going on.  Solid, solid solid.  \nNow, excuse me while I sit and enjoy my food coma.", "author": "Mario N."}

We had lamb saag, chicken saag and two other chicken dishes for which I can't recall the exact name.  However, the naan (we had both the plain and garlic & cilantro naan) was definitely not as good as  Naan-N-Curry's.  And the naan is what I like the best so my experience is going to be skewed by this.  The naan was not as fluffy and doughy as  Naan-N-Curry's and it was actually kind of dry and flat.\n\nPrice-wise, I think Naan-N-Curry may be a bit cheaper for exactly the same thing.  The big plus about Chutney though is that it is cleaner and less smelly by far, especially the restroom.\n\nOverall, if I was craving cheap Indian food, I would hit up the Naan and Curry on Irving given that its closer to where I live and the naan is yummier.

Man, that aloo Gobi was awesome!  So fresh and not salty.  Take that with some naan, and I was in heaven.  Well, almost.  I needed some spice so I could build up a nice sweat.  :)  There is a fridge in the back and they have two types of hot sauce.  I don't know the name of the brown one, but it's sweet at first and then spicy. The Green one was a typical chutney for the meats.\nThe Tandoori and kebab came out next.  The Tandoori is something to write home about.  Cooked to perfection with the most real Tandoori flavor I have had in a while.\n\nWhy is it 5 stars?\n\nPrice -- For the volume of food I got, $17 in DT San Fran is peanuts.\nQuality -- the salad traditionally given before the meal was fresh as were all the ingredients in all the dishes.\nCleanliness -- very clean\nService -- fast enough and friendly.\n\nNOTE: This is not some fancy joint.

You place or order at the counter, help yourself to chai, sit, and you'll be brought a plate with lettuce, tomato, onion & some water and after a brief wait, you'll get your food.  Prices are higher than naan & curry, but still very reasonable.  \n\nAs for the food, it's not bad, especially when the price is considered.  The naan is good, but I prefer it crispier.  The Tikka Masala is very skimpy on the chicken, so you might want to order some chicken on the side.  It's tasty, but not my favorite Tikka Masala.", "author": "She-Ra .."}

The flavors were good, but the Paneer tikka Masala was a bit lacking in flavor (Sameer even added salt).  The saag/palak paneer was a over pureed, but still enjoyable.

Most of my coworkers are Indian, so we hit an Indian restaurant every other week. This week, I convinced them to try out Chutney to take a break from the popular Shalimar or the Naan and Curry also in the Tenderloin. Chutney was recomended by an Indian woman I work with, who mentioned there were more varied vegetarian dishes there. \r\n\r\nThe food there was quite tasty. But in comparison to the two other restaurants, I just mentioned, Chutney just wasn't quite as good overall. I have to admit that I am quite influenced by the opinions of the several Indian guys who I ate with who seriously thought it sucked.\r\n\r\nI had a couple of my favorite dishes: Bhindi masala and palak paneer. Stay clear from the palak paneer, as it is practically a soup. The okra was nicely spiced, but not exceptional. I tried a bite of the tandoori smoked fish (bad vegetarian) and it was nice, smokey and tender. The naan was on the fluffier side, and worked well to sop up the curries.", "author": "Ron L."}

Quality chunks of white meat happily drowned in the most beautiful of sauces.  Whenever I eat here with someone, we are usually tempted to just pick up the plates and literally lick them clean.  I probably have at some point, but I eat here so much i couldn't remember.  Basically,  shit's amazing.  I haven't tried many other dishes because i'm picky, especially when it comes to meat, and besides, chicken tikka masala beckons.  But i did try the palak paneer which was way too spicy for my debilitated digestive track.  I didn't care for the consistency either, which was too pureed for my taste.\r\nservice has always been fast, except for one time when I went with a big group on a busy friday nite, which was understandable.  the place is surprisingly clean, especially compared to the street it's on.  If you order smart with other people, you can get away with spending $6 and stuff the hell out of yourself.\r\nBe forewarned:  don't plan on being far from a bathroom after your meal...unless you have intestines of steel.

Funny story - I actually WAS going to go to Naan N Curry down the street, but there were police barricades in front of it).\r\n\r\nI had sheekh kabab, garlic naan, and the vindaloo. Sheekh kabab = insanely good. I wasn't expecting anything, it was just $1.99 so I decided to order it because it was cheap and easy. What a treat - the spices were perfect, and it tasted great paired with the onions it came with. Delish. he vindaloo, however; I must say, I've had better. The sauce really wasn't as flavorful as a few places I've had in Massachusetts, of all places, and it wasn't spicy enough for me. My least favorite part of the vindaloo was the fact that the chicken was done more authentically, which means it was chopped up as a chicken instead of using just the meat. Why do I not care about authenticity here? Because of the really insane amount of bones that kept getting stuck in my teeth. \r\n\r\nReading all the other yelpers on here, I really wish I had tried some of the specials. . .that's for next time.

Yes, you should wash your hands before eating. And yes, the line can often get out of control. But the food is so worth it. \n\nFirst off, let's talk about the prices. Each dish is around $7, with samosas/apps even cheaper than that. The portions are heathly -- I always share a rice and naan with whoever I am eating with. \n\nAlthough they don't use organic food (like some snobs have knocked them for), it's Indian. Who cares?

Service is pretty basic - order in front, take a number, food is delivered, pay when you're done.  And yet, the consistent excellence of the flavors themselves have not been topped by any other Indian/South Asian restaurants I've tried in SF, regardless of whether the eatery was up- or downscale.  Sure, I've seen more creative menus elsewhere, but if you want to get some really delicious, spicy curry every time, Chutney will serve it to you.

The only downer I've hit on the menu was the chicken curry, which just wasn't up to the quality of the rest of their food.  Also, if you order samosas, they're coming with the meal and not as an appetizer, which is a bit of a downer, because by then I'm too busy shoveling naan, rice and mutter paneer (or whatever my dish of the day is) to give the samosas their proper attention.\n\nIt's the definition of a 4-star restaurant.

So it was last night, roaming the streets of San Francisco looking for a place to grab a bite. We consulted Yelp of course and saw this place was rated 4 stars.  Sorry to say, I disagree with you Yelpers!  This is clearly an average place not deserving more than 3 stars!  The best thing about this restaurant was that every dish was about $6.99 - cheap!  The taste of the food was not bad but the chicken in my tikki masala was tough and I expect soft, melt in your mouth chicken for 4 stars.  My hubby's dish was lamb and lentils and it was just a bit too spicy for my taste but again not bad. My mango lassi was nice. Can't speak for the naan - I love it but can't eat it.  It did appear yummy though.  The system of standing in line twice once to order and again to pay was unusual.  I wonder how that works when there is a rush.

The preparations may not be as authentic as those in the other local dives, but at least you won't be making a mental note of obvious health violations while you eat.", "author": "Gourmet G."}

Want to know why Im so confident? I tried them. In one night. We called it the 2010 Tikka Tour. Yes it's a bit cheesy but think about it. When you taste wine you need to taste them side by side to have a frame of reference. So last Saturday night we went to three different Indian places in the Loin to see which has the best Tikka Masala. Chutney ranked number 2 behind Shalimar but beat out the place that is actually called Tikka Masala. Chutney had the nicest decor and a friendly staff but we all thought that the Tikka was had too much tomato flavor and not enough chicken or spice. They did make us a garlic naan on whole wheat which was noteworthy.", "author": "Kris N."}

Unfortunately, my tastebuds and I were let down, but I think that may be because we ordered things that I don't necessarily like.  \n\nWe ordered the chicken korma curry, the lamb curry, the tandoori chicken (both the leg and the breast), and chicken biryani.  We also tried the naan, the garlic naan, and the aloo naan.    Out of the entrees we sampled, my favorite was the tandoori chicken leg- it was flavorful, juicy, tender and fresh out of the oven.  The chicken was just delicious with a hint of smoke from the oven and a crisp exterior.  The tandoori chicken breast was okay, but the breast was a little dry.  The lamb curry was a little gamey, but with a good balance of spices.  I'm not a fan of lamb, so I probably didn't appreciate it as much as my family, who all thought it was delicious.  The chicken korma curry's sauce was good, but the chicken breast pieces that came in it were too dry.  The chicken biryani was a big disappointment, only because they decided to mix in a large amount of fresh cilantro into the rice.  I HATE cilantro, so needless to say, I didn't have much of it.\n\nThe naans were all very fresh and hot out of the oven.  My favorite of the three was the aloo naan, which was naan stuffed with a layer of mashed potatoes.  When dipped into the curry sauce from the chicken korma, it became absolutely magnificent.  The garlic naan was good, but I think it could be improved by having the garlic cook a little bit more- it was too raw for the garlic fragrance to absorb into the naan.\n\nOverall, I liked the fact that they have an extensive menu, where most entrees run about $5.99.  For five people, our bill came out to be about $35.00 and we were all stuffed.  The restaurant is very clean, and even though you are ordering at the counter, the dishes are all brought to the table.  There is also free chai, which was a great way to end the meal.  I would be back to Chutney to try some of their other dishes (making sure to request no cilantro in any of them) and to have the aloo naan and tandoori chicken leg.", "author": "Angela H."}

I've had problems with parking.. but not the food. My two main dishes.. the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Lamb Vindaloo. I've ordered also the Daal, Chana, Bhindi Masala dishes which are quite tasty and of good consistency on their respective sauces. \nMy new favorite at this time is the Bengan Bharta.. and I'm not even a fan of the eggplant, but this dish is soooo sooo good. \nWhat I like about this place is that for less than 20 buck two people can get full and then some... \nWhat I don't like about this place??? \nIt takes me foreeeeeeeeverrrrr to find parking... \n...And the neighborhood sucks too... I feel like i need to watch my back every time I'm around this area. If ever you see a parking place and a group of people are lingering around that spot.. look for another parking area... my friend's car got peed on the last time we were there. \nThat is why I usually make others drive when going to Chutneys... or usually I'll say \" Hey!! ...

They are half the price of any other Indian place in town and you save even more by bringing your own Indian beer (purchased at the liquor store across the street)! I would say the food could have been a bit spicier (because we like it 911) but when we asked for a side of pickle to spice it up we were given an assortment at no charge. Lamb Tikki Masala and Spinach Paneer..to die for. LOVE IT!!!\nP.S. Please please...\nAnyone know of an Indian grocery store?

Being a Brit raised on curry and living in Ventura county if this is the best Indian that SF can offer it's pretty sad. Having said that I thought the food was OK. The chicken tikka massala was one dimensional and didn't burst my taste buds with flavor, all yogurt based no onion in the gravy and lacked some whole spice like cinnamon, cardamon and cilantro. The lamb vindaloo had potatoes but no vin (wine) typical of this portuguese inspired dish. The lamb was beautifully cooked but the sauce had no depth of spice, sadly lacking in cumin, mustard seeds, tomato and any firely black pepper kick. Shish kebabs were hand made and not dry but litle spice and sadly missing in fenugreek leaves. It was decenly priced but some of these reviews are a little over the top. Inside has a nice atmosphere, lots of Indians eating which is a good sign but if your looking for a great Indian taste explosion and you eat a lot of Indian food then it's overated but nevertheless authentic, cheap and fresh.

But it was so so good that I have to add my two cents. It's a fast food type Pakistani place (one of those where you can see all the foods behind the counter), but with lots of seating in a clean environment. There is also free tea which is a nice added touch. Now for the food - everything was so delicious! My favorite was the lamb biryani - one of the best I've ever had! The meat was cooked to perfection, melted in my mouth and the entire dish was spiced perfectly. We also had the brain masala. I grew up on my mom's brain masala so this was the first time I had it in a restaurant and it was delicious. They add some tomato to it so it is slightly soupy. The naan and tandoori chicken were also delicious - the naan was fresh which makes all the difference.  A lot of South Asian food is overly spiced to the point where you can't taste the meats, but all the dishes here were perfectly balanced. A must go if you are in the area! In fact, we were in town from NYC. Our friends live in Oakland and we were back in Oakland for the evening after having spent the entire day in SF. They suddenly remembered about Chutney and actually insisted we drive all the way back. I am so happy we did - the drive was totally worth it!!!", "author": "Su R."}

We ended up at Chutneys as we were only a few blocks away.  My first time eating here and though I love Indian food I felt this was average at best.  I had the chicken tandoori (my favorite) which came with a huge salad and a lot of garlic naan.  Mind you, the prices are great.  It only cost me a whopping $5.95 for this meal.  But, the chicken was dry and the salad tasteless even with a yogurt dressing.  The garlic naan, however, was soooooo good.  I love naan and love garlic.  So, of course the combination is going to win me over.  But, garlic naan does not a meal make.  The portions were huge, this was more like two meals.  I could only eat half of it.  So, although the chicken was dry and the salad tasteless, I ate the other half for dinner.  I am not going to write this place off, I'll give it another try and see if perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing.  My friends seemed to enjoy their dishes, so it's a possiblitiy.  However, until then I can only give it two stars.\n\n\nUPDATE:\n\nYes, I did indeed order the wrong thing.  I went back two days ago and ordered Tandoori Chicken, rice, lentil dal, mango chutney, and raita.  All was good.  I wish I had more of the raita but, oh well, need to go back again I guess.

You order at the counter, then take a number to the table. It seemed cheap. We sat down, and got a pitcher of water, which I like, because I hate when places are stingy with water. Then they gave the 3 of us this tiny thing I guess you could call a salad, with whitish wilting iceberg lettuce and a couple discolored tomato slices. One tiny one for all of us. We didn't want to touch it anyway. It had a slice of lemon on top as dressing. Our food came, and it was tiny. A got chicken tikka, I belive, and it only had THREE pieces of chicken. Yes, just 3! And some sauce. J got a lamb dish, which was also small, with some fatty lamb in it. I had the grossest one, it was lamb saag. I usually love saag. So here is a small dish of extra grated up burnedy tasting spinach, with a bunch of BONES and a few pieces of FAT and about 2 bites of legit lamb. Seriously, one whole section of the plate was piled with fat and bone. Disgusting. I choked down the bad spinach with my naan. I had plain naan, which I usually love, but this one, while not bad, wasn't good. It had no taste. A and J had cheese naan, which they thought was the best part of the meal, but still didn't taste much cheese in it. All 3 of us had some watery mango lassis, which weren't bad but definitely not good. I can't for the life of me tell why on earth it has a good yelp rating, or why there were people in there. We spent $40, which is cheap I suppose for 3 meals, but since they were small, fatty, no meat bleh meals, it was expensive and a waste of money. I had a stomachache after :( and we were all hungry.", "author": "Merredith L."}

We eagerly opened up the food only to find that they'd forgotten to include all the naan we ordered. I called Chutney immediately and was very upset about the mistake (it was 8pm and we were VERY hungry). The staff who took the call didn't know how to resolve the issue and even hung up on me. I called back and ended up speaking with the owner's son who promised to comp our meal the next time we visited.\n\nYesterday evening we ordered to-go again but this time it was a smaller order. I explained the previous situation and the staff on the phone said he was also family so he would 'take care' of me. When I picked up the order, he charged me $20 for a $36 order.

First of all, the place was pretty jumping, which I always take as a good sign. Although all of the cooks were Latino, I find that they often makes the best cooks in all different kinds of restaurants, so no points off for not staying pure Indian/Pakistani.  The Boyfriend and I ordered some food to go - he got his go-to favorite, chicken tikka masala, and I was jonesing for some chicken biryani and a mango lassi. We also ordered basmati rice and some garlic naan on the side. The service was pretty prompt. The tikka masala was really creamy and had a nice smoky tomato flavor and the chicken was tender and flavorful. The biryani was good - the chicken fell right off the bone. The naan was a little burnt and I've had better but for the price, I'm not going to knock off points for it. The one drawback to the place is its location. If you're craving cheap good Indian eats, just brave the prostitutes and druggies who prowl the neighborhood.", "author": "Christine P."}

It was so damn good that my boyfriend and I came back a day later to eat it again, no joke. And talk about cheap! I don't know how they do it but goodies to me for knowing about it! The 1st time we ordered we got the lamb vindaloo, a chicken dish (it was a special and I can't remember the name), garlic naan, and a mixed pickle side order. All that was under $20 (including tip). The lamb vindaloo was amazing!!! the lamb was sooo tender. You know what, that was the best prepared lamb I've ever eaten. Hands down. The vindaloo was a little spicy with an amazing clove flavor. The chicken special dish was good too (we requested that to be spicy) but I can't remember too much about it because the lamb vindaloo blew everything else outta the water! The garlic and cilantro naan was excellent. The mixed pickle wasn't what i expected...good, but it had a very intense salty flavor. You have to find the right thing to pair it with as I'm sure it would be great as a garnish on something. You will get the gas attack if you're not use to eating the spices and chilies they use, but its well worth it. When we came back a day later we ordered the chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken (leg), onion naan, and papadams. All for only about $16 we left very satisfied again. No gas this time as we didn't order anything spicy. I wish I lived in SF so I could eat at this place at least once a week!", "author": "Niki P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-02", "description": "So here's the thing about Chutney. It's good, but it's not as good as Shalimar. With Shalimar, you go home, and you need to take 2 or 3 showers to get rid of the smell since you WILL reek of it once you walk out--there's no avoiding that. With Chutney, you can go home and only take one shower to get rid of the smell. So with Chutney, you're trading in having to reek of curry for less tasty food--Chutney is basically a less grimier version of Shalimar in terms of cleanliness. It's still delicious, just not Shalimar delicious..so, think Shalimar, but 3.5 notches down--yea, still good. I ordered their saag paneer which seemed more watery than most places, but it was still good. Their CTM (chicken tikka masala for those new to pakistani cuisine), was decent. Naan was soft, so that's always a plus. I walked out, and smelled my hair, yep, smelled like Chutney--but at least body spray masked it (this method will not work at Shalimar).", "author": "Sami A."}

The host was all smiles and was totally fine with us holding a large table even though our other friends had not arrived.  We had also brought wine (again, perfectly common at Shalimar) but I grew hesitant when I glanced around the restaurant and it didn't appear that you could byob.  I asked the same smiling host about their policy and he was super chill and told us it was perfectly fine and offered us a wine opener.   Portions border just right to a little small.

It's also just a little more expensive than NNC but less so than Punjab because of location. I was bought over to them from NNC because they have lamb tikka masala, not just chicken tikka like most places. Also, they have seekh kebabs (beef), which NNC got rid of (they only have chicken seekh). Their tandoori chicken is very good, very moist, better than NNC + Punjab. Also, this place gives you free salad: lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and lemon wedges. But, NNC on O'Farrell + Mason does this too now, as well as Punjab. I must say that this places has nicer decor than most Indian/Paki cheap eats, almost like more fancy, and the bathroom is nice. Of course, you order at the counter here and they bring you the food. They also bring you the plates and utensils and water but you get your own free cha (tea) at the counter. The neighborhood, if you're not rough-neighborhood savvy, you may not want to walk there alone.

The tikka masala is great, the lamb curry is yummy, and all the different kinds of naan (pita bread) is mouth watering! the garlic naan is sooo good and the cheese one is to die for.  The staff is friendly. Definitely try it!", "author": "Esther Y."}

The extra salad with onions is also a good touch for someone like me that loves raw greens.  The garlic and potato naans are so good that I think I just might try and make a naan ham & egg sandwich some day!", "author": "John C."}

The service is friendly and prompt, and even on really busy nights, everything runs smoothly. We went with a group of 6 last Friday during prime time, and we were seated in about 10 minutes and our food was in front of us 5 minutes later! It is clean and inviting, and it is BYOB! We brought some great beer and enjoyed it with our meal. I would highly recommend this place to anyone in need of a speedy, cheap bite in the downtown area.", "author": "Jammy M."}

The Aloo Ghobi, spicy cauliflower and potatoes, was my favorite but the last two times I ordered it it was sandy; I don't think they washed the potatoes enough. And one time the potatoes tasted odd and were mealy. Kind of a shame really because the food is good when it's good.", "author": "Greg M."}
