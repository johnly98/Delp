It's a moderately sized restaurant, but when my friend and I went for a lunchtime meal, we were able to find an open table easily.  The service was friendly but somewhat impersonal; it also took a few reminders to get my friend's beverage request.\n\nIn terms of the food, I thought our entrees were average.  We tried the chicken korma and the saag paneer, and I found both to be lacking in flavor.  Granted, there were not the spiciest dishes on the menu, but both items were more on the bland side.  I did enjoy the sesame naan, which was warm and nicely fluffy.

Yes, I can be very \"particular,\" and yes, I used a euphemism.\n\nSee, tonight, my friend and I had a really difficult time choosing among their meat curry dishes. And that uncomfortable feeling of ambiguity and uncertainty is something I never want to impart on my dining companions.\n\nFriends, my \"particularity\" is just a way of showing how much I care about you.\n\nAnyhoo, onto the review. We took Mark Y.'s recommendation to get the $6.99 LAMB WRAP, which is a flour tortilla surrounding pulled lamb, lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber, accompanied by mint&jalape\u00f1o chutney and sweet tamarind sauces (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tikka-masala-san-francisco-2?select=-I1hCo5xaZDdhcIzvHCxRA#8luLLKW3VNGEeo8WklNYog). The wrap wasn't overflowing with ingredients but was still filling. The tortilla was toasted for a nice crunchiness, and the lamb was juicy and surprisingly subtle, in a good way. The sauces definitely added an appreciated dimension of flavor, which could explain the toned-down flavor of the lamb meat.\n\nAs for the conundrum of our second dish, we took a page out of another reviewer's book and ordered according to the restaurant name: CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA, $8.49 (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tikka-masala-san-francisco-2?select=-I1hCo5xaZDdhcIzvHCxRA#6ZPatkIRY-ALrGLzE9tCwQ). To hear the restaurant describe it, the dish had \"tender morsels of boneless chicken breast marinated in a blend of freshly ground herbs, baked over charcoal, then cooked in the chef's special masala sauce.\" A classic dish that didn't stand out above other chicken tikka masalas I've had at other Indian places. The chicken was neither moist nor strongly seasoned, but the chunks were large, and the sauce was comforting and not too acidic. The $1 NAAN, which is made with wheat, was a tad bit crispier than other places I've been to, but it was doughy enough for adequate sauce-mopping.\n\nAlso, it should be noted that for dine-in, you place your order at the cash register, and they bring you the check at the end of your meal. And, while you're up there, turn to your right and grab a cup of free chai tea.\n\nIt's not fine dining, but the dining is fine nonetheless. Especially with me ;)\n\nHAHAHA.", "author": "Adele F."}

Unfortunately the service and the food were disappointing.\n\nThe employees weren't actually rude or unpleasant, but they weren't exactly paying much attention. We both decided to order the restaurant's signature Tikka Masala. When it arrived it was lukewarm, and there were just five tiny pieces of chicken in each portion! The sauce was acceptable, but neither of us left there feeling satisfied.

Most people who they serve UCSF get off at 5. I can't tell you how many times I call at 5 and I get told 25 minutes for my food. That means I have to wait until 530 to get my food. \n\nIf they opened at 430, took orders then SO much more business for them. \n\nThe food is good, often you get decent amount of chicken, in a tikka masal for instance. SOme times you get 4 BIG pieces and I just break it up, other times its more even and more plentiful. The amount of meat you get varies. \n\nThe Nan can be very hard at times. Often in the middle burnt and rock solid pieces are there. Inconsistant. \n\nOver all when you get a good soft nan, not over cooked rice and the right portion of chicken its all good and some one the best quality:cost ratio in the IS. \n\nBut more than often you get 1 bad element to the dish and the hours starting at 5 for dinner is a mistake imo.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-08-08", "description": "I'm not what you would call a Pakistani nationalist. I'm not ignorant of my region's history and culture - I'm just not that crazy about it. \n\nHowever, I am, and have always been, a culinary jingoist. If you mess around with the food of my people I WILL END YOU. \n\nThere are tons of Pakistani/Indian restaurants that are MEH. Truly, honestly enhhhh. There's probably a hundred between Berkeley and San Francisco alone. I feel nothing towards these places, and eating there is a function of staying alive rather than enjoying my meal. And that's totally fine. \n\nBut Tikka Masala goes full retard in several ways that irritate me and shift it to being actively bad rather than neutrally nothing. \n\n1) The Food\nThe most obvious point I have to make is this: the food is BLERGH. It's not meh, it's not maybe ok, it's not misunderstood - it's mediocre. I ordered a naan, saag paneer, and  korma and I ended up being able to eat absolutely none of it. I have eaten at a lot of sub-par Desi restaurants, but Tikka Masala set an impressive new low. You know how delightfully racist TV shows and movies depict our food as gurgling, greasy, graying primordial ooze that will tear yo ass up? That's the shit right here. I understand that kids are starving in Africa so I try not to be an entitled prick who wastes food, but when I can't tell if the meat in my dish is lamb or reconstituted jelly meat substitute then i will toss that shit out, burn it with blue flame, and sprinkle holy water over the ashes as I sweep it into the toxic medical waste bin. \n\n2) Location, Location, LOCATION\nTikka Masala is located just a few minutes walk from the main campus and hospital of the University of California, San Francisco. If you know anything about medical schools/hospitals, ESPECIALLY in the Bay Area, you know that there are A LOT of hungry, hardworking Indian/Pakistani densely packed into that location. There was an opportunity here to do something great and they choked like the fat boy who would play far outfield in kickball and trip over his own feet trying to catch the ONE ball that would come his way (... some wounds never heal). \n\n3) Service\nI'll be real and fair here, my anger at this place is weirdly intimate and personal. I think it all started with this point - I waited 40 minutes to pick up food that I was told would be ready in 10 minutes. I know that Pakistanis/Indians are all about that IST (Indian Standard Time) but that shit does not apply in the food service industry! \n\nBut then again, maybe I shouldn't complain about that last point. Because every minute they made me wait was another minute I WASN'T eating their food. What a glorious 40 minutes that was....", "author": "Salman Q."}

We were so hungry that we couldn't wait to have their wonderful smelling food!!  Well, unfortunately we were less than impressed. The lamb, instead of tender, was extremely dry and hard to chew. The presentation was pretty unappetizing also - several chunks of charred meat scattered on the plate...  The butter chicken was better but there was hardly any chicken in the sauce.  \n\nThere was a bug flying around and wouldn't leave us alone - guess it came in from the open entrance.

The person on the phone was having a difficult time understanding and said that is not a dish on the menu. I explained I had ordered it before, and he said okay he would make it that way since I have had it before. When I arrived to pick up my food there was a paneer tikka masala and mixed vegetable tikka masala with paneer. I explained I did not order the paneer tikka masala and the older man behind the register was very aggressive and rude saying I had ordered wrong over the phone, and next time to say mixed vegetable masala paneer. I understand mistakes can happen if the order is something not directly off the menu, but the way he spoke to me showed poor customer service. The other man working behind the counter perfectly understood what I wanted and quickly fixed it for me.

It's probably the best-tasting Indian food in our area for the price, and out of the dozen or so times we've ordered from here, we've never had a problem... That is, until now.\n\nI read one of the reviews for this place talking about finding shit in the food that didn't belong there; a used band-aid in the rice, a toenail in someone's curry, and I really didn't want to believe it... Now it seems I've experienced it.\n\nWhat I found might not be as unusual or disgusting as the aforementioned things were, but as a vegan, I was pretty grossed out to find a piece of animal bone in my mouth after taking a bite of baigan bharta, which is a (supposedly) vegetarian curry consisting of eggplant.\n\nI understand that mistakes happen, but with this place's track record, it almost seems like there's no regard for what gets scooped into the food here, and quite frankly that is disgusting.\n\nI guess we won't be ordering from this place anymore.

It had that smell that rice get after it's been left in the rice cooker for too long. I was hungry though and didn't want to go all the way back to complain.. so i ate it.

The sauce was thick and succulent and paired nicely with the naan and lamb.\n\nOther dishes we got were the chicken tikka, daal, saag aloo, and saag paneer.  I enjoyed the creamy spinach in the saag dishes but found I preferred the saag aloo (potato) to the saag paneer (cheese) as the potato spinach dish had a cleaner more vibrant taste to the spinach and helped to cut through the other dishes.

Indian food should be served in a dark, claustrophobic den suffocating under the smoke and heat of a roaring Tandoori furnace.\n\nFood-wise, I've sampled enough of TM's dishes to say that it's perfectly ordinary Indian food, which in these parts puts it solidly behind New Ganges, N&C, and Tasty Curry.  Nothing has stood out and the sauces don't seem to vary much across dishes.  The one unique item is the quail masala, and while the meat flavor works well for curry, the extreme boniness makes it hard to shovel into your mouth at a satisfactory rate.", "author": "Wes M."}

I think the food was fine, and it all tasted pretty good. However, my mom found a hair under her pile of food, and politely brought it up to the waiter. Although he tried to remedy the situation, he kept saying things like \"No one in here has hair that long.\" ... as if he was blaming my mom (who has short hair). Furthermore, the hair was found UNDER her food, instead of on top, which means it was probably on the bottom of the plate to begin with. If there's hair in your food, then whatever. It's probably not going to kill you, but it's just bad practice. But the right thing to do is to take responsibility for it and not blame your customers for your careless service or anything else that goes wrong in your business.", "author": "Rhea K."}

As I walk out with my friend in the foggy atmosphere, all i can think of is how my stomach is growling like no other and insanely cold SF can be compared to San Jose.. cafeteria food is closed across the street and we are all the way up on a hill.. As we drove down Judah street, my friend looked closely with his hawked eyes for a bright OPEN sign on the door of the restaurant...and IT WAS! we looked at each other and i turned abrupty to find parking right on the street.. That was how hungry we were.. but at the same time, we talked about our indian food craving throughout lecture... talk about focusing in class?\n\nWe walked right in with 10 minutes to spare.  I felt bad because that meant they had to stay longer but the workers didn't mind since they apparently ate their late night dinner also.  The guy told us \"You have one hour!\" when our food was served.. but hey! we wanted to head back home also so we finished in like 20 mins ha! Quick and friendly service.. music provided in the background. Chai tea free also!\n\nThis is a small fast food joint for a campus restaurant.  Convenient and fast. Plenty of chairs and tables.  Nothing too fancy but who needs fancy on campus?  Very cheap prices from $5 to $10 a plate.  I was very surprised!  Affordable for students.  I give them 3 stars according to the quality of the food compared to other Indian restaurants.  We ordered the Chicken Tikka Marsala and Chicken Aag. I preferred the Tikka Marsala since i love saucey curry. Perfect for dipping with our Garlic Naan.  They used chicken breast for the meat which was healthy!  The other dish was made with spinach.  There was no sauce to it since it was just covered in spinach.  There wasn't much chicken pieces in there though. I was fooled! I thought they were just buried in the massive green mush my friend chose to order!  The naan was alright.. a bit too crispy at some pieces.. I felt like i was just eating crunch pieces and no bread.. I didn't really taste the garlic itself so that was a bit of a downer.. Overall, it did satisfy my quick indian craving for the night though!\n\nTotal: $17 for the night  Cheap or what?", "author": "Kathy D."}

It all tastes delicious to me.\nAs far as the people that say they had bland food, they must be life long smokers or something  because this restaurant does not have bland food.

The interior looked awkward, but the chef's special Fish Masala seemed like a great choice. I added garlic naan to my order. \n\nUpon paying $12 (for what?), the clerk at the register didn't have enough change and mentioned he'll come back with my $5 bill. As I waited at the table, I started wondering about my money, and whether it was wise to trust him. Meanwhile, a very dry salad came out with no dressing and no silverware. By this time my opinion of the place totally went South, and I declared that it was a $12 loss for the evening. I kept waiting and waiting for my missing $5, even after the clerk returned to the front. I finally had to go up and ask him about my $5 he still owed me. He gave me a blank face for a second, then said \"Oh oh, here you go.\" \n\nWhat. Theee. Fuck. \n\nThe silverware came out finally, followed by the \"special\" fish masala. While the sauce and naan were quite tasty together, the fish sported some dark and bony spots-- a sign of a bad fillet job. I kept biting and gnawing into the dense coriander, which certainly doesn't taste good in full force. I also kept finding fragments of bone and bay leaves in the sauce, as well as a few fibrous strands of something or other. It's easy to pull out entire leaves, but not when they're fragmented throughout the sauce. I then noticed that half of the naan was over-cooked, but by that time I had lost my appetite. \n\nUnimpressive and regrettable.

Place is clean and well lit.  Note the CLEAN mention.  They got a 99 score from the board of health.  It's hanging right by the cash register.\r\n\r\n The chef Ash used to make curry in Hollywood, which is why he has all those signed pics of Farrah Fawcett and stuff around.  Ash worked at Shalimar briefly, and the other chef worked at Shalimar for a while.  Good friendly management and staff.  One thing you'll note for all the dishes is that you'll find whole herbs/spices everywhere.  And I think it makes everything taste more fresh.\r\n\r\nTheir chicken tikka masala is very tasty--a unique spice combination I think--a lot different from other places, with a perfect balance of cream and tomato, unlike most places that are just too creamy. \r\n\r\nI also like their Quails tikka masala that is even less creamy than the chicken tikka masala.  great balance for the stronger quail flavor.  Tandoori chicken leg is only like $3 per LEG.  \r\n\r\nLots of specials you don't see elsewhere.  including a chicken jerrafy (?) and beef jerrafy (not sure if I wrote that right).  Very spicy hot dish with bell peppers and hot peppers.  Perfect thing to warm you up on a cold foggy sunset evening.\r\n\r\nCan't remember which other dishes I usually get, but Ash has some talent with this balance of spices.  Good all around, fast, and not too expensive.  The lamb chop is kinda the exception--it's good, but not as good as shalimar, and you only get 2 pieces.\r\n\r\nAnyways, with this place so close to my apt, I usually don't need to go to the Tenderloin for my indian curry fix.\r\n\r\nTHIS PLACE RULEZ", "author": "Fong L."}

Its darn good, although I would recommend calling the retaurant to confirm before you show up expecting it. They only do it occasionally.\r\nWhich is a shame, I have taken it upon my self to educate the ignorant masses on the goodness of indian style black-eyed peas, so that restaurant can be more frequent in cooking it. The chef/owner told me that if I call a day in advance they will make it for me.\r\n\r\nlast but not least, their aloo naan (naan bread stuffed with spicy potato filling) is excellent. Their aloo naan rivals that of Shalimar, there I said it, I'm not claiming one is better than the other, but they both are right up there.\r\n\r\nprices are excellent, and I would recommend stopping by the liquor store across the street and picking up a bottle of wine/6-pk beer and say hello to the chatty Lady from Turkey. if you have been nice, then she might even reward you with little sweet nibbly.", "author": "An u."}

The garlic and basil naan didn't have that much extra flavor than the regular naan. The sizes were also a lot smaller than the ones I'm used to.

I had to order $25 worth- gotta take the good (mostly everything) with the bad (this kind of shit) when living solo.  The chicken was good but the sauce not as creamy as I like.  I think the sauce will be perfect for the prawn masala, which I will order next time.  The paneer was excellent- homemade and it tastes like they fire it in the tandoor.  The palak part was okay.  It was more like chopped greens than the mush I usually like.  Much better tho than the greens water they serve you in India.  The lamb was very tasty.  It could have been hotter- I even asked him to make sure it was spicy, to which he replied, \"Lamb vindaloo is always spicy.\"  I said, \"I know but please make it spicy.\"  The rest was all good as well.  \n\nIt didn't blow my mind but it was SO much better than the Indian I had delivered when I first moved here- I think it was Great India.

It's a nice, little (very clean) hole in the wall restaurant with very good food. The staff is very friendly. They have a 99 health safety rating, so that has to count of something, right? The prices are completely reasonable too.", "author": "Kevin O."}

Tried it tonight for the first time.  The service sucked horribly (mostly due to one clueless kid) but the food was great and the prices were reasonable.  I'm Indian and am pretty picky but the palak paneer was cooked to perfection and the naan was fresh and yummy.", "author": "Sat Kriya K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-05", "description": "Love this place.  Soo close to UCSF and the food is both relatively inexpensive and tasty.  The food is fresh and of good quality.  And after my friend told me a really terrible story about Naan n Curry involving yep you guessed it cockroaches, I make this my must pit stop for indian/pakistani food.   The chicken tikka masala is also my favorite, but I haven't been disappointed with any of their dishes.  The atmosphere is extremely casual and pretty clean.", "author": "Michelle T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-03-28", "description": "My favorite Indian restaurant in the city and probably one of the best kept secrets. The chicken tikka masala is very good. The naan is crisp in a way I don't see at most Indian places. You can tell the owners are devoted to making good food. The only reason this place isn't as successful as other Indian joints is because it's located away from the main restaurant drag in the Sunset. It's definitely better than Naan and Curry on Irving Street or any place in the Mission.", "author": "Hmmm W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-12-30", "description": "i came here with my sisters and they heard that the food was good and cheap. but they obviously lied or have not had much Indian food. i cannot say it was entirely bad. the shrimp biryani was delicious and not too spicy. but that was it. the naan (garlic and plain) was horrible! the plain had a doughy texture to it. the garlic and basil only tasted like garlic (maybe i've been spoiled but i prefer the naan with actual garlic and basil bits on them.) i always get the chicken masala at any Pakistani/Indian restaurant and i have never been so disappointed. it was bland and warm. the lamb vindaloo was never a favorite of mine anywhere. so i don't have much a review for that. if i were to try this place again it would only be for the shrimp biryani but i doubt i will be returning to this restaurant in the future.", "author": "Jen P."}

It's a small place and sometimes you have to ask them for extra cups, etc... but overall, the food is consistently good, the service is consistently friendly, and the location is consistently convenient for those that work at UCSF.  I'm a frequenter of South Asian restaurants since I'm a brown kid that can't really cook, and this food is definitely the best South Asian food in the inner sunset.", "author": "goph s."}

We have gone several times and I think the flavors and freshness of the food is better than most other places we have tried in the city. My only complaint is that it is sometimes a little too spicy. My fiance and I are huge fans of spicy foods, but there have been a couple of  times that we were both crying while eating out dinner!!! Once we asked them to make it mild and it came out even spicier...must not have liked our request. Despite, I still love this place and will continue to eat here.", "author": "Lauren D."}
