On a recent Friday morning, I had just seen my dad's name among the interned and was feeling somewhere between pensive and peckish when I noticed Arguello opened at 11AM. Oh good, I'll have a bit of lunch, I said to myself, so I waited on the bench and in front of their patio gate. They opened the gate on time, and I asked if they were ready to serve lunch. Indeed they were. They serve a pretty healthy menu for a Mexican restaurant, but keep in mind this is Des Jardins of Jardiniere. That means this is not your typical Mission taqueria.\n\nThey offered alluring plates such as the $12 Quinoa Salad with arugula and pepitas and the $10 Little Gems with avocado, cotija cheese and a serrano vinaigrette. However, what caught my eye was the $12 Pozole Verde, which turned out to be a steaming bowl of goodness on a brisk morning. It had chicken, hominy, cabbage, radish, and oregano in warm chicken stock and topped with a fried corn mini-tortilla drizzled with creme fraiche (photo: http://bit.ly/2oI7Npy). Nice and it satisfied my periodic menudo fix. With a minty $3 Lemonade (photo: http://bit.ly/2tkTyeY), it hit the spot. Not to worry if it sounds too healthy as they offer five different tacos in the $4.50-$5.50 range and three desserts. Nice to be there before the lunch rush if there is one. It's the Presidio after all.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...lighter Mexican fare and pretty tasty\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...part of the gorgeous Presidio Officers' Club so very much a Spanish colonial vibe\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...attentive enough as they seemed to still be preparing the restaurant for business\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Des Jardins leaves her unmistakable mark on the small but impactful menu", "author": "Ed U."}

My friend of ill-fortune stumbled back into Arguello in a fit of panic and told the staff the tale of how her phone had just ran out of battery. That was her first time in the Presidio. Beautiful as it was there, she was stranded in unknown territory. The helpful staff took her in with open arms, shielded her from the rain, and offered her the usage of their charger. Alas, my poor friend, being one of the few Pixel users left in the world, was not able to use any of their iPhone chargers. One of the staff members then proceeded to dial her a Lyft with her own phone. And my friend was able to return safely home. One cannot ask for a better and more helpful staff than that!\n\nPS.

On this visit, I was glad that we were able to be seated rather promptly (although there was a 30 minute wait to sit outside on the patio). I must say, this is a gorgeous place to have brunch, especially on a beautiful day. It gets the right amount of sun and you can catch some great views of the Bay as well. \n\nThe hostess was very nice and accommodating (which is always nice when you're eating with children), bringing us two high chairs and having overall great customer service. For the most part, we were able to order quickly however service seemed to be a little slow. I ordered the agua Fresca of the day (my partner ordered a beer). Both drinks were good and satisfying. The waiter (who also had great customer service) took our orders and our food arrived pretty fast. One thing I did not like about the service was that we ordered chips and guac (chips were made on-site and DELICIOUS!!! The guac was rather bland and needed major seasoning) but that didn't come until after our main courses had arrived. \n\nWe ordered the house tacos and the Mexican omelette. The house tacos were delicious, but I wish they weren't so small for their price (it's about $12-$14? And you get the equivalent of two small street tacos, one with shrimp and one with fish). The Mexican omelette looked good, but lacked a lot of flavor. We also ordered the corn cake, which was delicious however the fresh vanilla bean cream was super bland.\n\nThis place has the potential to be really good, but I feel like they keep running through chefs because the quality of the food isn't consistent (and if they food isn't good, then why pay?) The last time I came I had a great food experience but this time it wasn't the same. I am thankful for great customer service (hence the 3 stars), which goes a long way in my book. \n\nI will say that this is a great place for brunch overall due to its location (bay views), and being very stroller friendly (both inside and out). Parking is also plentiful right out front (but don't forget to feed the meter, as they are active on the weekends as well.", "author": "Tracy T."}

This place would hold its own in the middle of the country where there are just Mexican-ish chains.  However, it's definitely not a destination Mexican joint in San Francisco.  More like you happen to be nearby in the Presidio and want alcohol and want a little food with that alcohol.\n\nChips w/ Salsa, Guacamole and Refried Beans: If drinking is your game, this snack option will do the trick for the table.  Don't expect someone to hand mix your guacamole table side.  Nothing is particularly amazing, but it's better than store bought.  The chips seem homemade, though some were a bit over fried.\n\nChicken Taquitos: Better than the frozen aisle version.  Kinda of a small portion though, with just three.  Loved that the shell was crunchy all around and the shredded chicken inside was tender.  The dish is a bit skimpy on the salsa, but not a big issue if you have the chips & salsa on the table.\n\nCarne Asada Tacos: A bit disappointing.  Despite the \"asada\" name, it didn't seem very grilled. Kinda like the limp beef option at Chipotle.", "author": "Adam B."}

I especially like the historical artifacts on the wall and the old photos. If its warm enough outside, I think the patio would be quite enjoyable.\nRegarding the dining experience, while the food tasted good, I would stick with just the starter menu as the Mexican poke was absolutely delicious. I was irritated that chips were not provided, chips are a staple at any Mexican restaurant, and to not provide them complementary was annoying. Rather you have the option to get chips, salsa and guac for $9, or just guac for $6?! Secondly we decided to get a pitcher of margaritas because the price on the menu the price was shown as $11 for margarita and $40 for a pitcher. Usually when you show two different prices in the same line, its because there is an incentive to the consumer to select the larger item because there is some type of cost savings. When the \"pitcher\" arrived, the container looked like a wine carafe, which is smaller than a pitcher, and we probably got at the most 3.5 drinks out of it total, which is no cost savings, and at that rate we should have just bought 4 drinks, because at $4 more, I would have preferred a whole second drink instead of splitting the remainder margarita between our two glasses. \nFor entrees/larger plates - there is only one taco option and its pork. I'm was very surprised that there were no steak or chicken taco options, as I don't eat pork, and it seems to be a more common thing in the Bay Area. There were three seafood inspired dishes on the menu, crab enchiladas, snapper, and a shrimp dish, however I was surprised there weren't other classical items, such as street tacos, chile relleno, some type of mexican inspired burrito, or a steak dish.", "author": "Lisa H."}

First off, it's more convenient than your average SF brunch stop, albeit a little out of the way in the Presidio, but you can make a reservation and there is plenty of parking in front of and nearby the restaurant. The space itself is beautiful. There is an outdoor seating area with tables and benches that is kept very clean as well as plenty of tables indoors. It's also located within a museum (?) so you kind of have to navigate to the bathrooms, but those are also kept very clean. \n\nI know people gripe about the service here, but I really had no issues. The wait staff was lovely - we were offered seating before the whole party arrived and they were quick to check up on us to offer drinks and some starters. \n\nThe food itself here was the most underwhelming part. For the atmosphere of the restaurant, I found the food to be really meh. Firstly, they say you eat with your eyes. Dishes here are definitely not the most visually appealing. Beyond that, I would say my food was tasty, but nothing that would make me want to return here over any other Mexican restaurant in SF. We ordered:\n\n- Huevos Rancheros: definitely underwhelming. It came with tortilla, cheese, and egg, surrounded by refrained beans and salsa. Visually, no other colors but brown and red. I would have liked maybe some chopped salsa (tomatoes, onions?) or guacamole/aioli of sorts? It was not inedible or anything, but again, one of the most disappointing Huevos rancheros I've ordered.\n\n- The fish tacos were good - reasonably priced, battered and fried very well, and this came with a great sauce and slaw. If I had to come back, I would probably stick to the tacos.\n\nTo summarize: a great beautiful, open space, friendly staff, but just very mediocre food. For that reason, I'm not sure I would make the trek out to return here.", "author": "Sarah N."}

When the person beside me mentioned that she'd just come from there I wrinkled my nose and asked \"How was it?\"  \n\nYelp reviews for Arguello had led me to believe that, despite the Traci Des Jardins pedigree, this place wasn't a winner.  With the blessing of this stranger I had reason to see for myself and, $90 worth of food and drink later, I'm in agreement.  Arguello is a fun place serving Mexican fare that goes well with alcohol.  \n\nArguello has a sweet outdoor patio, indoor tables (which could've used quicker bussing), and a friendly bar.  It was at the latter that I enjoyed a mess of margaritas ($8; alcohol content kicked in at #3), chips/2 salsas/excellent guacamole (about $8), and Frijoles Rosas with Queso Fresco topping ($3.50).  On Cinco de Mayo this constitutes a meal.  \n\nI can't vouch for the larger plates of food with the higher prices as I didn't try them.  Nor can I grouse about the service issues some have spoken of as my service at the bar was quite excellent.  \n\nIf I were in the Presidio and someone recommended Arguello for drinks and a little something-something I'd agree without hesitation.  In fact, were I in the Presidio I'd probably be the one making that recommendation.  I'd sit right back down at the bar and order up pretty much the exact same thing (maybe a few less margaritas) and I'm pretty certain I'd leave feeling the same way I felt on this visit.  \n\nArguello is a good place for drinks and a little something more.", "author": "Tracey A."}

We were served margaritas on the rocks with   barely enough salt to taste on the rim. APPARENTLY they were saving the salt for later. No matter the margs were weak and slightly flavored. Not bold and  a citrusy as one would hope. I sent mine back and told them what i wanted: lime juice, triplesec and a better tequila and rocks and salt. They assured me they used fresh lime and triple sec. There was no evidence of lime, perhaps they need MORE and a better triple sec as well. The service was confused and inefficient. They returned with something very like the previous margarita. I did not finish that single margarita in the hour and a half that we were there. Normally I would have shared a pitcher or had three.\nWe ordered an appetizer, ceviche, it came w no chips, we waited for a return of the waitress, meanwhile we were asked if we'd care for chips and salsa. I thought these were to be gratis and in lieu of the fact we had nobody to take our order. I finally called someone over to take our order. (Btw the chips were not free). After about an hour from the start our order appeared. My wife liked her carnitas tacos. I had ordered the fish. The fish came attractively prepared on a bed of green coloured rice mixture. Maybe cilantro? I could not taste anything in the rice as it was too salty to distinguish. The fish was nicely browned, broiled BUT It was also too salty and laden with grease, butter i think. As small as the fish and green rice serving was, I could not bear to finish it. I asked for some lemon to try to brighten the flavour but it was too far gone. I don't write reviews or consult yelp but i felt the need to object. The bill was 95 dollars without tip. Two drinks, ceviche, $al$a and \u00a2hip$, tacos, and fish.

This was a risk for me because I'm not a fan of enchiladas but they came out to be really good with green sauce and a bit of kick to them. As an Indian girl, I love any kick to my entree so that was great. My friend/mentor got the squash and she LOVED, LOVED it. She was a little worried about the mushrooms (because she's not a fan) but she basically licked the plate and had all of us taste it (it was good but I'm not a lover of squash so that says something). My other mentor got the Beef cheek which ended up looking like pulled pork and tasted delicious- really soft and just great seasoning. As a table, we also ordered the squash and it was perfect because it came with three slices enough for one for each of us. \n\nWe were full but couldn't pass up dessert... so we had the tres leches cake- super moist, soft, and a good finisher to our meal. \n\nThe only \"gripe\" that I have is that it seems like the chef is a big fan of pomegranates and puts them on a lot of dishes.

That is a staple of Mexican food. I ended up ordering a cheese quesadilla which was BLAND as hell. It was plain white cheese in a tortilla on a side plate and that's it folks. Cheddar would have been better and perhaps the chef could throw in a few finely chopped jalape\u00f1os or some diced green chiles. Get a little creative, why don't ya? My friend had avocado toast which looked pretty blah. She said the bread was \"nothing\" and the salad that came with it was ehhh. Basically, all she ate was the bacon on the salad. The waiter came over to ask how it was and she explained the above and all he could say was \"Sorry about that.\" You'd think he would have taken hers off the check, but nope. We paid over $50 for a very sub-par meal. Honestly, Taco Hell aka Bell would have been better. These people need to go to Javier's on Newport Coast and find out what a really OUTSTANDING Mexican restaurant is all about. I'd be surprised if this place makes it. Surely, there must be some good Mexican places in the Bay Area, but this ain't it people. Save your money and go elsewhere. Trust me on this one. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I like the wood beams on the ceiling.", "author": "Lisa R."}

Small place when the outdoor patio area is closed (as it was), and a bit disorganized.   There's a line that snakes back from the bar where you order food and then sit down.  The signage could be better.  \n\nI was shocked as to how much everything cost, but you're paying a premium for eating Mexican food in the Presidio, and it was pretty tasty.  For ~$5 per taco, you get a good amount of meat (I ordered the carne asada and carnitas tacos, and my friend gave a good review on the fish taco).  We also got chips/salsa/guac, which was $6.50.  I think chips only were $4, and that's a 1 star deduction immediately.  \n\nAside: Restaurants, don't be stingy with the chips.  At a cheap dive, fine, limit the chips because your clientele can't afford that much, and they'll just fill up on chips.  At an expensive place like this, people can already afford the entire menu, so why charge a premium for something so cheap? Bad form. \n\nSo, overall disorganization, small portions and high prices, and good tasting food equals out to a 3 star experience.  I might come back for dinner at some point and revisit this review.", "author": "Ben K."}

Perhaps someone ought to erect a petition on moveon.org or change.org. Writing to Yelp may also get this rolling. \n\nRecently, I learned the Manager abused his authority and prioritized his personal feelings over his professional duties.  He created false accusations that I called him non-profane terms when I informed him his waiter was lagging and incompetent.  He then relayed these false accusations to his boss, Arguello's Owner or CEO.  In so doing, he banned me and a regular small crowd of people from ever making reservations at the restaurant or attending. \n\nEssentially, if you're looking for good food, decent to great service at reasonable (NOT wild) prices, look elsewhere.  If you dare speak up and demand the basic services every diner is entitled, prepare to suffer backlash or muzzle yourself.  I gather their prices reflect these facts.

(Or after taking dogs to Chrissy Field!) The outside fire pit is fantastic to have a cocktail and chat. The margaritas tasted fresh and had a decent tequila for their house blend. Parking on a Saturday evening was effortless and free--which is certainly a rarity. The guacamole was fresh but pretty bland, as were the two salsas that were served. The haba\u00f1ero salsa at least brought some needed heat.  The chips were very good. I had the carnitas sopes appetizer ($12) as my meal, and they were tasty, with nice bits of carmelized meat.  Pretty small portion but not outside of expectation. The taco appetizer was also good, though the salsa it came with was again unexciting though fresh. Our friends all had the pork shoulder, which is clearly what is considered their best dish based on waiter recommendation. The presentation of a chunk of meat on one side of an otherwise empty plate, for $23, did not win me over. \nSo for the pricing I would like to see better presentation and more interesting seasoning.

It was perfectly balanced and full of nuances. I have never had anything like it. I had the bar make me a non-alcoholic drink and it was the perfect mocktail. Different from anything I had ever had, not too sweet and utterly refreshing. The rest of their drink menu looked incredible and I highly recommend people come here to at least grab a drink. They are worth their $12 price tag. The bar staff are extremely friendly and I recommend sitting at the bar if for nothing else than for the chance to share a laugh with them. \n\nThe tortilla chips are homemade and thick; we got them with guacamole and salsa. The tomatillo salsa was amazing, the red salsa a bit to sweet for my liking. The amount of guacamole was healthy but I would have liked to have been able to add a bit of salt to it. The soup of the day, oxtail $12, plus the sopes ($14) plus chips were perfect for two people for dinner and all of it was very tasty. We didn't order any mains because $22 was a bit steep for the portion size, although they are trying to go for a more upscale crowd which is hard to with Mexican.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-01-09", "description": "This review is for the bar as well as food at the bar. While I believe the food is a bit expensive if this were in a hotbed of other restaurants I know rent and locations in the Presidio have to increase their margin to stay afloat. It is a tricky business, this Presidio, for the stream of visitors is challenging to maintain. Without further ado onto the bar!\n\nThe barman was excellent. His knowledge of the booze at his disposal was excellent. He had created a hot alcoholic chocolate with Oaxacan flair and almond milk(for those who prefer their cocktails entirely bespoke they had indeed made the almond milk onsite). It was delicious. The compound whipped topping was astoundingly complex and delicious. I found myself making sure I metered my intake of it to ensure it lasted for the entire drink.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e grabbed a mocktail that he whipped up after asking about flavor preferences. It was tasty, only a tiny bit sweetened, and the color was an impressive shade of purple.\n\nWe thought the food was delicious. Their tortilla chips are stout: thick, greasy enough, and the overbearing salt crystallization I have seen at some places was delightfully absent. Their tomatillo salsa is delicious. It is not spicy, it simply showcases the flavor of the tomatillo. A big win. The guacamole is fine. Not a showstopper, but certainly fresh and the presentation was nice. It was easy to extract with the chips, and as a borderline glutton this is a key feature I look for in a serving dish. \n\nWe ordered the carnitas sopes, which were nice and fresh, but did lack a bit of pizazz from the corn sopes upon which the fresh radish, avocado, and beans were served. They were great texturally but were missing something that would have made it an extroardinary dish. The carnitas was lean and delicious.\n\nThe soup of the evening was an oxtail soup. Referred to as gallinas but was not actually chicken which the barman explained was the origin of it coming from working class kitchens where oxtail was a more common ingredient. It was as he had explained: savory, flavorful, but not a rich and overpowering dish. The mix of herbs and cabbage on top made a great addition and added a fair bit of complexity and flavor. The oxtail near was delightful, tender, and served on the bone.\n\nAs a resident of the Presidio and a fan of Mexican cuisine of all sorts Arguello is a welcome addition to the main post area. I understand that it may lack some finer dining features gourmands in the Bay Area may expect but I found that the charm for me was the bar. I found the drinks the staff created to be unique, complex, and satisfying to my palette. If choosing between a two top seating and bar I would choose bar every time.

Okay, so maybe not cheap but you get what you pay for. Two entrees an appetizer and two margaritas each for around $100 in SF is not bad at all!

Second time around we sat at a table and ordered mezcal margaritas, nachos, and drunken chicken. Again, they did not disappoint. The food was so fresh and delectable and the service was impeccable. I can't wait to go back and order the snapper and try the chicken enchiladas, all which looked divine. The service we experienced at the bar and in the dining was top notch!

Long waits when more than half the tables are empty- no I asked, most are not reserved.\nInefficient and rude staff. I was here on 4/2 for my bday and they are just not accommodating. To add to this the waiter thought we short changed him which we did not. \nI LOVE Mexican food. All kinds. But this menu is very limited and the portions are very small. \nSorry I won't be coming back. Too many other excellent Mexican food restaurants with better service, and a more appealing menu. In the marina alone which is the closest neighborhood they have 3-4 really quality, fun and friendly full sit down Mexican food restaurants. \nThe owners need to close, fire the chef and staff and reinvent themselves fast!", "author": "Jon D."}

I will start off by saying that I think Traci des Jardins is spreading herself too thin. A month or so ago, a friend and I had lunch at Commisary which was very disappointing - so-so food and amateur service.  So, bravely, we did lunch at Arguello.  First of all, the young lady taking orders set me off by telling me to  \"stand over there, not here\" to place my order! My response was, \"sorry, but no one gave me an instruction booklet when I walked in\". \n\nAnyway, we ordered and since it was a beautiful day, I spotted a shady table in the patio so could dine outside. We walked out and the table was dirty! It was obvious that it was not cleaned up after the diners who had just been there. The dishes had been cleared but the table had not been wiped down. So we sat inside.\n\nThe orders came -  one.  at.  a.  time. I was  done eating my first taco before the 3rd person at our table was served! The food was very bland and almost tasteless and luke warm. My fish taco was about a 4 inch taco with a piece of battered deep fried fish on it the size of my thumb. We all had the fish taco and we all decided that it cried out for salt, even though non of us are major salt eaters. My carne asada taco had 3 small strips of beef. They were tasty but after 3 bites, it was all gone. \n\nTraci (may I address you by your first name even though we have not met?) get your self over there and start cracking the whip. Get some professionalism imbued in your people there, increase the size of your portions and make the food tasty. $4.50 for a fish taco that is about 3 bites is not a good value. As for flavor, I can think of several Mexican restaurants in the Mission District that have delicious food and reasonably priced. Get with it, Traci !!", "author": "Tom B."}

My husband and I were staying at the Inn at the Presidio, so we thought Arguello would be convenient as it is just a short walk down Moraga.  The decor is very nice, but that's about the only positive thing I can say.  We were seated quickly, and ordered a glass of wine, two cocktails, one taco appetizer to share and chips and salsa.  We also ordered our main entree at the same time.  \n\nAppetizers came out pretty quickly, and the chips were just so-so, a little greasy.  The 5 little tacos were tiny, hard fried and greasy, with barely any meat in them.  The bowl of chips was small, and the salsa portions were tiny.  \n\nAfter about an hour and a half, we found out that the kitchen had not even started our entree, and there were only about 5 tables left in the restaurant at that point.  We cancelled the entree order, paid our $57 bill and left.  We definitely felt like the stereotypical \"trapped tourists\".   It's a shame that a location like the historical Presidio Officers Club is not being honored with a good restaurant.  Time to call in Chef Ramsey.", "author": "Mary K."}

We ended up sitting at the bar for dinner, as the seat next to me opened up and the host never called our name to be seated. \n\nOne thing I did appreciate was how fast our food came out once we ordered it.

We concluded that it is truly the most disgusting meal we have ever been served. \n\nAfter not being able to get into Commissary, we tried Arguello. Chips, salsa and guacamole were edible, but not great. Then things got really bad- the mushroom quesadillas were cold, salty, and the home made tortillas were dry and flavorless. It is also a very small portion (though so gross we would not have eaten anymore) served on a large plate- presentation on everything is bad- salsa bowls so small you can not dip your tortilla chip (which were greasy and bland). We had a side of beans that were also terribly salty (I tend to like a lot of salt, but across the board everything was too salty and lacking any depth of flavor or balance. ) Next came the little gem salad- how is it possible to screw up such a simple salad? Again salty, needing acid. The radishes were limp. \n\nThe grand finale was the roasted squash plato. Inedible, swampy over cooked squash in a watery base with the worst tortilla I've ever had.

I thought this was an order from your table restaurant, but instead you get your own seat and then stand in line to order from the side of the bar.\n\nAfter placing my order (for 2 people) which was two tacos, a salad, a quesadilla, coke, and juice, it took the servers 10 minutes to even bring out our drinks. The server fumbled my coke and some of the soda spilled on the floor.  So he left the juice and said he would be back with a new coke.  10 minutes later he came back with the same bottle of coke he dropped (it was just over half full since he spilled it on the floor) and proceeded to tell me it didn't fall on the floor so he was just giving me the bottle back.  I obviously told him to get me a new full bottle, which took him 5 more minutes.\n\nWhile this soda debacle was going on, some of our food arrived.  However, my quesadilla was not delivered. I waited about 10 minutes and asked where the rest of our order was.  The lady at the register said it wasn't her issue, but she would go ask the kitchen.  After 5 minutes of talking to the kitchen and server, she came back and said it's on its way.  About 8 minutes later it arrived at the table, but the person that came with me had already completed their meal since it took forever for my food to arrive.  \n\nIt's important to note that in-between all this time it took to get my soda and food the bartender and server were basically chit chatting behind the bar, cursing, and not really doing much of anything.  It should have literally taken the server 30 seconds to grab me a new bottle of coke, open it, and walk it to my table.\n\nThe quesadilla was very small, maybe 4 inches in diameter, but it costs almost $11!!!!  Definitely not worth the price, but it was good.\n\nI give this place 2 stars entirely based upon the extremely poor service.  The food for lunch is OK, nothing special and definitely nothing that would make me want to go there for lunch again.

For dessert we all shared the rice pudding type of dish and churros.  \n\nOverall the food was just okay - a few comments that we all had dining. \n- taquitos only come in 3. We asked that a fourth be added so everyone had one and our server just said they are only made in threes.  Huh? \n- chips and salsa - should always be complimentary! I mean how much does it cost to offer chips and salsa to customers!?! \n- such a long wait between the appetizer course and our mains.  I mean a really long time.

We went for dinner the week after it's grand opening and clearly they had not worked out any of the major kinks in food service. \n\nThe Hostess was probably one of the worst I've ever dealt with. After taking our number to call us when our table was ready, we informed her that we were going to grab a drink and sit on the patio until our table was available. After grabbing a drink, we sat directly outside the door about 10 feet away from her for 45 minutes. After 50 minutes went by, I went up to her and asked how much longer the wait would be. She then proceeded to tell me that they gave our table away because we didn't answer the phone when she called. \"We have a ten minute grace period. Sorry.\" WHAT! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I was looking at you through the door the entire time. I'm sorry, either that is just ignorant or plain lazy to not walk 10 feet and tell the patron their table is ready after being told. \n\nAnother highly irritating experience I had was with their bartender when we went to order a drink to wait. My friend and I both ordered a glass of wine. Instead of a standard 4 to 5oz pour, he served us nothing more than 2.5oz. I was in disbelief when he gave them to us and charged $24 total. I don't know what kind of establishment they are running over there, but clearly ripping people off is high on their priority list. \n\nAfter the seriously frustrating series of events that transpired, we walked out of the restaurant and went to The Presidio Social Club down the street. Thank God there is one well run Presidio restaurant with great customer service and amazing food. \n\nDon''t waste your time or money on this place.

They just nailed historic preservation and its presentation to visitors. The Presidio Trust, the historic architects, the general contractor, and everyone involved should be really proud. It's stunning.  The art, on top of the museum displays, is absolutely stunning.  I was absolutely emotional and blown away going through the building.\n\nThe building itself was restored with such loving care it reminds me of a Smithsonian West, really nailing the museum quality, and is deeply relevent to our city's history. It's just stunning addition to the United States, let alone the city of San Francisco, or Presidio. It is bigger than just \"us\"....

It's just so amazing... we are all ending up immersed, totally steeped, in one of the greatest cultural sites in America at this intersection of history, architecture, art, and interpreting all of that.

Greatness ends.\n\nSimply, any cantina in the Mission stomps this place.  Actually, any Mexican restaurant in the city limits will give them a run.  $106 for 3 adults and 2 kids.  And hungry afterwards. \n\nService was horrific.  Yes, they have been opened only a few days, but there's no excuse for tables to go un-bussed for 10-20 minutes with a 45 minute seating wait time.  Eventually I think the Manager bussed the tables -- he wasn't doing much actually, so good thing.  They must have a \"system\" -- wait person takes order, then 2-4 other people serve the dishes.  If they remember what you ordered.  Wrong beer.  No appetizer.  Food comes cold.  Or not at all.  Various people coming to your table with confused instructions and wrong dishes.  Did you order this?  No.  Did you order that?  Nope.  Oh well.\n\nNow a word about quality -- and quantity.  I don't expect gourmet micro-dishes from any Mexican restaurant.  \"Platos\" were tiny, itty-bitty.  Did not come with the corn tortillas as advertised on the menu (they \"forgot\").   Pollo Chile Verde was a leg and a thigh -- disappointing for $15.  The caramelized pork shoulder was terrific -- but cold, and a very small portion for $18.

We were never offered a dessert menu (I wasn't that excited by the menu when I'd seen it when we ordered entrees, but would have been nice to receive it), though water was refilled regularly, which is something I appreciate. Parking was generally not that easy to find, though it was Off the Grid in the Presidio, so it's probably easier otherwise. \n\nFood and drinks were both delivered promptly. We didn't do a thorough check of the menu beforehand, but vegetarian options were a bit lacking (on their website, I only saw dinner and lunch menus, no brunch, which is what we went for). Generally, dishes were on the smaller side. Prices were not outrageous, and generally matched the size of the dishes, but we left a bit hungry.\n\nWe had:\n\nPassion Fruit Agua Fresca - Delicious - a perfectly sweetened drink without being too syrupy. A fantastic, fresh taste of passion fruit. I wanted more when the drink was done!\n\nCompanions had two grapefruit-based cocktails. Both drinks were almost overwhelming in taste and small, of a mix of alcohol and grapefruit. I didn't enjoy the drink, and my dining companions only felt mediocre about them.\n\nChips and Guacamole/Salsa - The guacamole had some good chunks of avocado and was definitely freshly made. Not a huge serving (similar to the below), but enough to be easily shared between two people. The red salsa had a nice kick to it. Chips were crunchy and well-salted without being greasy.\n\nHuevos Rancheros - Followed the small theme. About two (maybe three) small, round tortillas were laid flat on the plate, with two poached eggs atop them. There was a semi-spicy salsa/sauce on top, which was the highlight of the dish. A small pile of refried beans were on the side of the dish. Flavors were fine though nothing special.\n\nOaxaca squash quesadilla - Two medium-sized quesadillas. There was a fair amount of saut\u00e9ed squash inside, which I enjoyed, (not too greasy, etc.), but the cheese was a bit stringy and bland. Again, nothing wrong if you dipped it in some salsa, but also not fantastic.\n\nI wouldn't rush back soon.", "author": "Jackie W."}

Thought, why not grab a few cocktails and sit on the patio. The restaurant, especially the outdoor space is very chic and comfortable and staff seemed friendly (somewhat).  The menu is limited, but we weren't there necessarily for the food, so didn't pay much attention.\n\nSo, why the 2 stars?  I head to bar to grab two signature cocktails.  For $13, I thought they would be made \"fresh\". Instead, they were pre-made and poured from a bottle.  Himmm....maybe I'm naive and this is done on a regular basis, but something just didn't seem right about seeing them pour this drink.  And for $13, really?

The flavors were good, mushrooms and cheese had great texture, but the tortillas up top and on the bottom? Could barely be cut by a fork, and because the thing was thick and fluidy, clearly not meant to be eaten by hand. The thing was obviously overcooked and because of the petrified tortillas, almost inedible. Unfortunately I had another destination and didn't have time to talk to anybody about it.

The initial looks are deceiving.  Perched along-side the Golden Gate Bridge, this atrocity barely gets by with ultimate compliment of mere existence.  Boring ambiance, boring service, boring food.  I only have one explanation of why such a view could be so blatantly avoided-The owner must be blind.  Or perhaps they were complete oblivious to their proximity to one of the seven wonders of the world.  Either way, it is inexcusable.  Additionally, the service was in subliminally sorry state of dissolution.  My best guess is that they were under the impression the food & beverages would serve themselves. This is without even mentioning the food itself: some poorly plated Costco microwaveables (not undermine Costco's excellence) of an excuse for Mexican cuisine.

Granted, I went there on a weekday at the very end of what is considered the lunch hour, so it wasn't crowded, and we didn't have to wait to order. \nThe first thing that impressed me was the tortilla chips.  They are actually made by frying tortillas!!  This is totally not common, at all, in any Mexican restaurant, or food store.  Whatever happened some years ago, possibly having something to do with health vs fat, every supplier of tortilla chips is using batter extrusion.  If you don't know what I mean, see if youtube has a video about it.\nAnyway, the chips at Arguello are fabulous!! They came to our table warm and crisp, and I could barely stop eating them.  And believe me, I know about tortilla chips; I get my favorite ones at a Mexican grocery store in Los Angeles.\nThe grilled fish taco was excellent; the carnitas were very tasty, if a little lacking in fat, and I would order them again.  The mushroom quesadillla left something to be desired as I didn't detect any seasoning and didn't taste any cheese.\nThe restaurant itself is rather industrial looking, but it's comfortable.

We had to ask if we might wait at the bar and order a drink.\n\nWe did wait at the bar, but although we were given menus, no one ever took our drink order (lost revenue).\n\nWe were shown to a group table right in front of the open front door on a cold day. We asked if the door could be closed, since everyone in the place had their coats on, but, \"Well, we'll have to ask the manager, and he's outside.\" After freezing for several minutes, we asked if we could move to a free deuce further away from the door (and why didn't they give us the free deuce to begin with, since it couldn't have been reserved for someone else, because they don't take reservations?). Again with the asking -- they would have to ask our waiter if that was OK (it was).

Our entrees came out shortly thereafter, so we had to ask for the chips and guacamole we'd ordered as an app. The entrees were unexpectedly topped with fresh avocado -- fine, but equally unexpected when later we were charged for the avocado add on. We had to ask for salt, pepper, and hot sauce (also an unexpected surcharge, we later discovered), which took quite some time to appear.\n\nOf course, we did not expect any acknowledgement as we left, so were not disappointed when one was not offered.\n\nWe never did get the agua fresca we ordered (lost revenue).

The quesadilla was miniscule, more like an appetizer rather than a brunch level entree, as the price implied. Barely warm, under seasoned, overcooked mushrooms and barely there melted cheese between two 6\", chewy, flavorless, almost undercooked tasting, corn(?) tortillas with a thin line of tomatillo salsa and cotija cheese. Size and quality did not justify price. \nThe chicharonnes were tasty, like \"pork popcorn,\" as the bartender pointed out, but again, not something that I'd rush back to experience over and over again or even recommend.\nNew concepts in upscale fast-casual dining combining beautiful spaces with simple \"pseudo-authentic\" ethnic food seem to be reaching for diners who think they're getting a great experience without having to dress up, never eat food with their hands and/or have huge credit limits.

That's ok. Because a lot of the food is fantastic. The chips are even better than what they used to serve up at Tortilla Heights, which were lightyears ahead of most the crap they serve at any Taqueria in the Mission, sans La Taqueria. Arguello's pork shoulder is to die for. Tender, moist, well flavored and basically you can't stop eating it. The chicken verde is a plus too. Dark meat, but still fantastic. I'd also suggest both squash dishes, the main and the salad. Don't miss the guacamole, it's a tad pricey, but who cares, it's perfectly seasoned and will be devoured in about 3 minutes. The tequila list is one of the best in the city and features 7 Leguas tequila (in blanco, repasado and anejo) which is the benchmark brand which all other distillers can be compared too. Hopefully the can have more salsa assortments and tad better decoration on the outdoor patio (and a few more heat lamps.)", "author": "Brian J."}

There was a long wait for a table, even though there were multiple empty tables. We were told that the KITCHEN was full. We were told that we could go wait at the bar; only problem was that the bar was full. I understand that they were busy...but why couldn't we sit down while we waited? Instead we had to stand in the corner and try to keep out of everyone's way.  While we were waiting, a couple walked in and was seated immediately. We heard one of the couple say to the other \"I'm glad that we called ahead so we didn't have to wait\". WHAT? It clearly says on the website that they don't take reservations. My guess is that they are regulars and favorite customers, but it's disheartening to have spent 20 minutes standing against a wall, trying to stay out of the way of the waiters, and then listen to someone be pleased that they didn't have to wait.\n\nFood! \nWe got chips, salsa and guacamole. The chips and guacamole were excellent! Very generous amount of guacamole. I've read other people complaining about being charged for chips, but I imagine the chips aren't free because they are deep frying actual tortillas rather than just dumping a bunch of chips out of a bag. \nWe ordered huevos rancheros, fish tacos, and banana pancakes. The huevos were on top very dry corn tortillas, with rubbery cheese and a fried egg on top. Beans were on the side. My beans were whole pinto beans but my dining companion's beans were all mushed up and cold. The beans had no flavor, and as the salsas we ordered with the chips were also very, very mild, we had to ask for hot sauce and salt. The fish taco was okay. The fish itself was delicious; crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Unfortunately, as with the huevos rancheros, it was served on a dried up corn tortilla with some flavorless wet cabbage. I ate the fish and left the rest. The banana pancakes consisted of three pancakes, a lot of banana and caramel syrup. Yum! \nWhen my friend ordered coffee at the end of the meal, she was told \"Sorry, we're closed\". WHAT?? She was able to get a cup of decaf that she said was awful (but we weren't charged for). \n\nOur waiter, Kristina M (name on our receipt) was very nice, checked back in frequently and did a good job. I'd like to eat at a restaurant with better food and Kristina as our waiter.\n\nThere were definitely some yummy things to eat..the chips/guacamole and the pancakes. Everything else was mediocre and bland. I don't understand why. Maybe because the restaurant is in the Presidio they figure that they are catering to a tourist crowd who may not be used to big flavors or spicy food? I have had more flavorful beans dumped straight out of a can. This is San Francisco. This is a Traci Des Jardins restaurant. Very disappointing.", "author": "Kate M."}

We ordered two of the squash plates, one mushroom quesadilla, a jicama salad, and a remarkably small order of cilantro rice. The squash was extremely bland. It was large amounts of unseasoned squash with small bits of unmelted mild cheese, served on an unsalted tortilla. The mushroom quesadilla was pretty good, but not amazing. There were a few too many of the slightly slimy mushrooms. If you really like mushrooms you would probably be happy with this. The jicama salad was okay, again a little bland and unoriginal. For three very normal- size average eaters, this wasn't enough. We went home and made some more food. The service was good. This whole meal was pretty unremarkable and tiny for $72.

The restaurant is set in a beautiful location with a nice back patio and well-done rustic furnishings.  \n\nHowever...the food needs improving.  While the guac and chips are solid, things go downhill from there.  The carnitas taco had bland, flavorless meat.  The eggs divorciado were bland missing salt, pepper and spices.  The chorizo and egg burrito was also really bland with no chorizo flavor and it was the same size as my 2.5 year old's bean burrito--tiny.

We were excited to be trying a new place. The setting at the Presidio is beautiful and the space is nice, but that is their only saving grace. It is a very, very loud place inside. Difficult to converse. \n\nThe waiter took a long time before we even got our orders in. We only had one drink order, a pale ale. We ordered a guac and chip appetizer, salads to share, and main plates. We then settled into spending a lovely evening in celebration. We waited a long while before our water was refilled. My friend did not like the beer and found it left a very bitter aftertaste. \nWe also waited a long time before we got anything to eat and much to our surprise, the hot plates came first. No apology for them coming, just the question \"Was that ok?\" Really? We just looked at each other and said \"Why not!\" Well, the salads were brought out next and then the guac and chips...all within about two minutes of each other. Our only choice was to eat the hot plates first. \n\nThe waiter gave us one beer to make up for this and remember, the beer was too bitter to finish the first one. The waiter did admit the order of the food was his fault when he keyed it in. Good for him.\n\nThere are only four main dishes on the menu and we got the port shoulder, pollo and squash dish. Each of these dishes were very bland and as a vegetarian, I was extremely disappointed in the squash dish. Only two small pieces of squash in a bowl with all zucchini in a bland luke warm white liquid. I could not finish it. These were served with corn tortillas that fell apart when you unwrapped them. \n\nSo, we ate in reverse order. \n  \nWe ordered desert and they had only one chocolate choice in the four deserts. A churro with chocolate. It is what the birthday girl ordered. The waiter took our order. Returned to the table after about five minutes and let us know they didn't have this on the dessert tray today and they forgot to tell the waitpeople in the line. \n\nHe asked if we still wanted the Mexican cookies we ordered. We all just burst out laughing and said, forget dessert, give us our check, we just want to get out of here! \n\nThis whole process was unenjoyable and over $100.00 later!!!\n\nOh, BTW, he did give us the Mexican cookies on the house. They were also not very good.\n\nReally a huge disappointment, a house of cards experience and probably in my top three of disappointing restaurant experiences.", "author": "Pat O."}

They should put the bowl on a plate OR use a bowl with a lip or edge. Instead the meal is served in a cereal size bowl with a brown wrapper of two tortillas placed right on the table. Nowhere to put your taco between bits. A little bowl and a wad of brown paper just looks like a pathetic entree. The person who had this said the dish was \"pretty good\" but not memorable - not enough spice or flavor for her.\nShrimp - came eight minutes after the squash (yep, we were timing it at that point). The waiter noticed I had no food and went to the kitchen. Obviously, the shrimp hadn't even hit the pan at that point (which was LONG after the pork had been served) because it was several minutes before I got it.\nThe shrimp dish was three whole shrimp - you take off the head, peel and in the case of one of my shrimp, even devein it. Kind of messy with the sauce. I was up for it, but it should be mentioned on the menu or by the waiter. Not filling at all. Good I had ordered beans and more chips.\nMargarita - best part of the meal, but tiny. It would take three ($30 worth) to equal the pint glass you get at many other places. \nWater glasses - tiny and constantly empty. Just leave a bottle of water on our table please. \nI work less than 10 minutes away and wish it could be a new go-to place. Instead it seems like one of those places you go on vacation, convince yourselves it was worth the trip, then never return.", "author": "M D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-10-19", "description": "This review is not for Service - the place is less than 2 weeks old so spotty service is to be expected. This review is for a) value for money b) quality / taste of food c) ambience\n\nValue for Money: 1 star - I have never felt so ripped off in my life. The $10 wine pours are a joke - apart from our table I overheard one other table next to us ask our server the same question \"are the bartenders using some sort of a measuring device to pour these wines\". The server claimed they were std. 5 ounce pours but I have never witnessed such a blatant attempt to rip off customers with such stingy pours. The fish taco for $4.xx and the steak taco for $4.xx are a complete joke - having lived in SF for over 20 years and having eaten at a lot of places, both cheap and expensive, Arguello is one of the worst in recent memory when you look at price and compare it to what is served on the plate as far as quantity is concerned. The $18 pork shoulder and the $6 guacamole were other examples of a gross attempt by this establishment to screw the consumer monetarily when you take portion sizes into account. \n\nQuality / Taste of Food: 2 stars - The best thing served was the habanero salsa - it was creamy, spicy and delicious. Outside of that the overall taste of things was poor. Not only was the guacamole  terrible value for money,  the taste was below average at best - bland and unsatisfying - the fish taco and the steak taco were both \"meh\" - thank god for the pickled onions that come with the steak taco - at least they added a bit of depth of the meat. The tortillas for the tacos were not fresh and extremely hard when they arrived - when you struggle to take a bite of a taco due to the lack of freshness of the tortilla, that is a bad sign. The pork shoulder was the best tasting dish served - it was decently cooked and had the tortillas been edible and had the price / portion been fair,  I would recommend it.\n\nAmbience: 4 stars - the outside patio with fire pit presents a great vibe. When you have decent weather it is pretty sweet having the opportunity to sit and soak it all in. We were definitely happy to have found a seat by the fire pit and chatted with our neighbors for  a bit. The outside dining seats are likely the best place to eat when the weather is decent - they had blankets for people who felt chilly and I did see some cushions on the long benches by the fire pit for patrons to use to get even more comfortable. The inside of the restaurant is nothing special - a bit warm and noisy and par for the course in my opinion. \n\nIf I were to take Service into account, I would give Arguello 1 star overall but based on everything else except Service, it's a 2 star rating at best. I realize this place is extremely new and has a lot of tweaking to do but I'm hopeful folks are taking feedback to heart as I would love to see this place thrive and be successful.", "author": "Anon Y."}

To be fair, we were there on a night when they had a band and swing dancing in the Officer's Club so Arguello was slammed. However, the bartender was surly and made, in my opinion, probably the worst Manhattan I've ever had. A woman sitting at the bar commented on how rude the bartender had been to her and her group so aversion to this guy seemed to be pervasive. Later in the evening, my friends decided they wanted to eat so we took a seat at the bar, which was our only option. I usually love sitting at the bar, so this was fine with me. Well, the surly bartender is now our server and he makes the switch from surly to downright creepy. I order the pork. His response was to point at my Manhattan and say \"I can tell. You look like you like to get porked.\" Wtf? My hearing is pretty damn good so I'm sure this is what I heard. I laughed it off, primarily because I think I was so shocked.

After a half an hour my guest went to the cashier to find out where our food was. She reported that the kitchen printer (where the orders are routed to) was having a problem printing. They had to track down our order and gave the  usual  \"sorry about that\" apology.   Yet, we waited another 20 minutes for the tacos to arrive. This was the worst part.

Friend had crab taquitos which he liked but said they didn't have much crab.  Only 4 entrees to choose from.  I ordered the pork ribs which were unfortunately sold out.  Being sold out of 1 of your four entrees at 8pm on a Saturday night is not OK.  My friend and I each had the duck with pumpkin seed mole.  It was tasty but, once again, an incredibly small portion for $18.  It was one duck leg with sauce, no vegies or rice or anything else.  It was more like a generously sized appetizer.
