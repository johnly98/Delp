As I was craving for the five spice chicken at Perilla, I decided to give their version of the dish a try. \n\nUnfortunately, the flavor was a bit off and it tasted more like a soy sauce/teriyaki chicken than what i'm use to for other five spice chickens that I've had before. The five spice chicken plate was presented with a salad (per my request) and portion wise, it's not bad. However, overall the meat was too salty and had a weird look to the meat (seem like they pounded the chicken flat?).\n\nThe friend and I also placed an order of their crunchy rolls which is a version of the nem nuong spring rolls with the pork sausage. This was not a star dish. The roll was not made well and too loose. The crunchy part of the dish was actually not too crunchy and I wish the piece of pork sausage was bigger. \n\nOverall, it was a nice alternative to perilla, but I don't think ill come back. Perhaps, I ordered the wrong dish and should've tried their noodle soup dishes which they appear to be known for.", "author": "Diane T."}

I don't normally care for red onion in pho, I prefer green, but I didn't mind as much as I thought. Next time, I would skip spending the extra $2 for the veggies - they were in large pieces and were difficult to eat with chopsticks.

The ambience is very nice and you could definitely come here for a date or dinner with friends. They have 2 big booths and a large side booth seat with multiple tables across in addition to chairs which seat couples or can be combined to accommodate 10+ people.\n\nThere is a 60 inch plasma screen TV and they're very nice about putting on the game if you ask. As soon as we were seated (without a wait on 6 pm on a Saturday) they brought us hot tea and water. The menu is very extensive with your traditional Vietnamese pho and vermicelli bowls,  in addition to appetizers. \n\nWe got the chicken spring rolls as an appetizer.  The peanut sauce was really good and you get 4 large rolls,  so it is definitely worth the $6.95. For the main course ee gotwonton soup with extra noodles and the chicken Vermicelli bowl.   With the Vermicelli,  It comes with an egg roll and i didn't realize it had pork in it,  so be sure to ask for a vegetarian before hand. The wonton soup is humongous.

Awesome vibe!\n\nWhat I ordered:\n\nBeef Combination Noodle Soup (~$10)\nThai Iced Tea (~$4)\n\nTbh I feel this is a little pricey for the food I'm getting. Walk 10 blocks down to 19th and Irving, and all the Pho places there are so much cheaper and better. \nThe beef pho I got here is mediocre at best, it's nothing special. The soup tasted actually a little bland compared to the other pho places I've been around the neighborhood. The thai iced tea was good though! I just wish it was cheaper though.\n\nI really want to like this place. Maybe I ordered the wrong item from the menu?", "author": "Xin W."}

My boyfriend and I ordered the appetizer combo, bun bo hue, and beef combination noodle soup. \n\nAppetizer combo: I was very surprised that it was good! Each and every one was very fresh, unlike other restaurants that can taste a bit stale. It is a bit pricey ($14) but I would definitely order it again.\n\nBun Bo Hue & Beef combination noodle soup: Do you ever eat food and think to yourself there's just that ONE ingredient missing? and if that ONE ingredient was in it, it'd taste way better but you just don't quite know what it is? My boyfriend and I came to an agreement that both of the soup was missing that one ingredient and we couldn't find out what it was. My bun bo hue was pretty watery and bland and my boyfriend's pho was just bland. HOWEVER, I give them props for giving us lots of meat!\n\nI'm honestly the type of person to never go back to a place if it doesn't make me satisfied, but I really liked the appetizer combo so I'd come back, but I'll just make sure to order a rice place instead of soup.", "author": "Elaine C."}

I ordered Imperial Rolls, Sunflower Vermicelli Bowl (Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong), and Sauteed Curry Chicken.\n\nImperial Rolls: 4/5. These were good, although not special or exceptional. But they were good. I appreciate that they provided vermicelli, but I wish they provided more than just one lettuce leaf. However, that's not a big deal and is only a nitpick.\n\nBun Cha Gio Thit Nuong: 1/5. The meat (pork) was dry and tough, and the sauce was too strong and had an unbalanced flavor. It was a chore to finish eating the meat.\n\nSauteed Curry Chicken: 2/5. Again, the meat (chicken) was dry, and the sauce tasted somewhat overseasoned.\n\nOverall: Dry meat is a deal-breaker for me, especially when the sauce and seasoning are not great, which was my experience. I'm not sure why the meat was overcooked this much. I probably won't order delivery from here again, although I would be open to stopping in, so I can at least ask the staff about the food.", "author": "Thuan N."}

I'm so happy for this family that they have a larger and modern space. I don't mind paying a little more as the prices are still reasonable. They are a hard working family, making consistently great food with fresh ingredients!", "author": "M M."}

The pho has the delicious light broth that is savory but not salty. And the beef balls are so good! The vermicelli is also great, especially with the imperial rolls! The chef is really good, as you can taste the power of the wok in the stir fry dishes. I prefer this place to the other ones around in the neighbourhood for Asian food. Oh they have amazing young coconut juice! Bit small but so fresh and you can eat the flesh! Service is also very friendly. Pretty much hits all the checkmarks for me!", "author": "Zoe E."}

The ambiance is \"date\" worthy and they upped the level and added to the dishes from their New Sandy's menu.  My staff and I tried the sea bass (excellent), rack of lamb (was well done but if you like medium rare... tell them when you order) and lemon grass spicy soup (top level).  Our favorite waitress/manager Jo-Jo and her crew has been there lunch time.  \n\nGreat, normally priced food, upscale ambiance and Jo-Jo with her friendly staff...... Great!", "author": "Bruce D."}

There are several Vietnamese places within 2 blocks of Sunflower Garden, and I've been to them all and actually like them all, but this one definitely has a more stylish atmosphere than the others nearby and prices weren't that much different. The service was good and the food was great.  \nThe only complaints I have are that the Bun Cha with grilled pork that we ordered, was pretty light on the pork, and while we were there, there was a large TV with nothing playing....only a Netflix menu. I would prefer to have it off and just play music. No need to watch TV while at the restaurant.\nWill definitely be going back though.", "author": "Desmond G."}

This restaurant had some unique soups, Bun Rieu and Canh Chua Ca which are much more fragrant and exotic in comparison to a traditional pho.

I miss the old dive location 2 doors down (which is apparently going to be their Banh-Mi take-away branch),  but this place is very nice. Food is just the same as New Sandy's maybe on fancier plates. The shaking beef on red rice is still amazing for $14, given that Slanted Door charges $40 for the same thing.", "author": "W D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-08-31", "description": "This place looks nice, but that is all.  The service is slow and mediocre even when the restaurant is empty. The servers don't say \"hello\" or \"welcome\", they just take your order, and they bring it and don't return until you wave at them.  Despite what yelp says, they do not have beer or wine. We had Spring Rolls, a BBQ Pork Vermicelli Bowl, and the Five Spice Chicken Rice Plate. It was all bland and uninteresting.", "author": "Harold W."}

Fortunately, I was informed by the waitress that New Sandy's will still be serving their legendary BBQ Pork Banh Mi. I had their rice dish (#15) with bbq pork. The pork was perfectly marinated (same meat as their bbq pork banh mi), a nice dash of onion oil, shredded pickled carrots, and fish sauce. I'm glad this new store front is open, New Sandy's is truly a gem and I'm glad they are finally getting an upgrade to their restaurant.", "author": "country g."}
