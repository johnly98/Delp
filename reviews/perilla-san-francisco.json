My friend and I each had a noodle dish and shared an appetizer and came out to just under $30. \n\nThe shrimp spring roll was quite good, with ample filling and thin rice paper wrapper. I was pleasantly surprised with my vermicelli as well. The five spice chicken was perfectly cooked with a great crunch. I like that they use thin vermicelli, almost like the angel hair equivalent. The sauce had great flavor too. My friend had the five spice chicken noodle soup and it was essentially the same but with broth. I tried a few spoonfuls of her soup and was rather disappointed. The broth lacked depth of flavor and a richness you normally get with pho ga (chicken pho). \n\nDef will be back for lunch and will still to vermicelli dishes for now and maybe try a rice dish.", "author": "Lynn C."}

(Apparently the other items on the menu aren't as good as this dish) I can only describe it as \"Vietnamese comfort food\" because it satisfied my carb guilty pleasures. The overall portion is smaller than, say, a typical bowl of pho.

It typically gets pretty busy around prime lunchtime, so to avoid the lunch rush I usually come a little bit earlier around 11:30 or later around 1. \n\nThe menu is pretty straightforward. They offer your choice of protein with either garlic noodles, rice, vermicelli, or noodle soup. Entrees range between $10-12 which is pretty affordable for this area.\n\nThe garlic noodles here are pretty bomb, and I've never gotten anything else. Just make sure you take a couple extra sips of water and wash out your mouth before you go back to work, since they do load up on the garlic. \n\nI've had both the five spice chicken and the pork here, and while the chicken is good, the pork is definitely my favorite. It's incredibly flavorful and tender. On my most recent visit, my coworker ordered the five spice chicken, but once he tried my pork, he agreed it was tastier and said he'd start getting the pork going forward.\n\nThey prep your food fast here, so I usually get it within minutes of ordering.

Not the least of which was the opportunity to try so many new places!  Well, for me anyways (all those years working on the Peninsula left me seriously deprived).  At the same time, it's always nice to have something familiar and comforting to turn to, especially when you're having \"one of those days\" at the office.  Ugh...management, amirite?!\n\nWhile I'd never been to this Perilla, I've been a fan of the one by 9th Ave since the first time I tried them...and not just because they're owned by the same folks as PPQ (one of my long time, go-to spots).  Rather, it's because of their garlic noodles - they may not be the best around, but they're great!  So, when I dropped in for lunch with one of my coworkers, it was an easy call on what to order.  Although I normally get the one with BBQ pork, this time, I decided to go with the GARLIC NOODLES WITH FIVE SPICE CHICKEN ($11).\n\nBesides how the price of my order here was slightly higher than what I typically pay over on 9th (to be expected, given the area), I thought this was still pretty solid, though not quite as good as what I'm used to from their sister location.  The chicken isn't any different by comparison (crispy skin, juicy meat, a bit oily), but the noodles didn't seem quite as garlicky or buttery as what I'm used to.  What's more, the portion size felt somewhat lighter as well, though it might be due to the flatware (these were circular, as opposed to 9th Ave's oval-shaped plates).\n\nWithout alternatives like it around, Perilla and its menu of legit Vietnamese options (including the awesome Satay Beef Pho that I always get at PPQ) are a solid choice for lunch in the area.  Steady food, fast service, and a lot more bang for your buck compared to some popular joints nearby (looking at you, Sushirrito).  The THREE AND A HALF STAR average is dead on, but if I'm being honest with myself, it's closer to three than four, especially since I can just as easily hit the one by 9th Ave.  Three stars or four though, Perilla is definitely worth checking out!", "author": "Mike L."}

I went with Melanie N. For lunch and she ordered garlic noodles with five spice chicken. I tried some of her garlic noodles and enjoyed it very much. It's not as garlicky as Crustacean's garlic noodles but still very tasty. She said her five spice chicken was seasoned well.\n\nI ordered the Charbroiled Pork Vermicelli (Bun Thit Nuong) and the pork was charred perfectly.

On a subsequent  visit, some one else in my party ordered the garlic noodles that came with a side of broccoli and the protein of your choice.  \n\nDepending on the protein that you choose, the noodle dishes range from a little over $10 to $12 - a doable price considering being in the heart of downtown San Francisco.  \n\nThe restaurant definitely caters towards small parties and business lunchers where most tables are set up for parties of two. There are few tables that can accommodate four, or otherwise the tables would need to be combined together for larger parties.\n\nService levels are adequate as the staff's primary focus is to get their customers in and out as quickly as possible.  \n\nI'll definitely be returning for my lunchtime noodle fix!", "author": "Candice F."}

After browsing through Yelp to see where I could possibly talk my sister into eating for lunch that had garlic noodles on the menu, I came across Perilla. 3.5 stars is usually pretty decent. A look through the pictures and I was sold. I'm a big fan of hearty, thick noodles and the coloring on the garlic noodle pictures looked promising.\n\nI was able to convince my sister that walking all the way from Bush Street to 1st and Mission to have lunch was totally doable all within her 1 hour lunch break. I may have been stretching it a bit, but I think she really did make it in on time! \n\nService: There was a guy waiting at the door when we entered so we were seated immediately and handed ice waters. He was also at the ready with his notepad so once we were ready to order, he was right by our table side! About 5-10 minutes later, our food was delivered. This gave us plenty of time to eat our food and talk without being super rushed. Additionally, when we were finishing up, the a lady appeared with our check! Quick and efficient. Although at any other time I might have felt rushed, this time the speedy service was welcomed!\n\nFood: I ordered the veggie garlic noodle plate and my sister ordered the five-spice chicken garlic noodle plate. I wasn't sure what kind of veggies to expect, but really all I wanted was some solid garlic noodles. What I came out with was a bunch of saut\u00e9ed cabbage mixed in with mushrooms and some other items. It was definitely oily and lacked flavor, but it was served with a side of chili sauce that helped a bit. The garlic noodles were the perfect texture and had a chewiness I could appreciate. The flavor was more buttery than garlic, though. I think everything was so rich that I filled up quickly and had to take nearly half of it home with me! My sister seemed to like her dish and she finished it up all except one slice of chicken and her single piece of steamed broccoli.\n\nPrice: After 6 months of living in SOMA, I've come to accept the fact that there will be no more cheap Asian food down the block from me. All food will have to be carefully selected (thank goodness for Yelp) and elevated prices are to be expected. At $10.50 + tax and tip for each of our lunch plates, this was definitely a bit steep for a carb-based meal. However, I think it killed off my garlic noodle craving for awhile now.\n\nWill I return?

Noodles were a bit thin and maybe overcooked where they were kind of breaking? Not sure. The chicken was quite tender and soft, but not full of flavor as I was expecting.

If you want to avoid a line you have to come at around 11:30 AM or past 1:00 PM otherwise expect to wait for a bit. So I went one day with a friend and was able to sneak in there right before the huge lunch rush. We are seated promptly and menus brought over quickly. We decided to share the dishes and order the Garlic noodles with Pork and the Vermicelli with the Five Spice Chicken. \n\nThe Garlic noodles are just as good as everyone raves about on yelp. The buttery garlic flavor is perfect and the pork was a wonderful compliment to the noodles itself. I know a lot of people go for the Five Spice chicken on the Garlic noodles but definitely recommend you try the pork. It basically tastes like bits of marinated Korean bbq. How can you go wrong with marinated meats Korean BBQ style and garlic noodles? You can't. The vermicelli was a nice alternative to not have something as heavy as the Garlic noodles. The five spice chicken on this was great. The skin was crispy and the chicken was tender so definitely NOMS. \n\nThis place is a nice spot to grab lunch in SOMA but definitely on the more pricey side for what you are buying.

I ordered the Beef Garlic Noodles and also got to taste the 5-spice chicken off of my coworker's plate. By no means was the food bad.\n\nThe noodles had a consistent texture and a nice subtle garlic taste. Personally, I would have preferred a much stronger garlic flavor. My coworker thinks the restaurant may have made the flavor less powerful in the last year to serve a larger customer base. The beef and chicken were both very well cooked today, but the broccoli was not.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed having lunch here. However, I don't think I will be going back for what you're getting at approximately $15 per entree (w/ tax and tip).\n\nPros:\n- Noodles were consistent\n- Meat (beef + 5 spice chicken) was prepared very well\n\nPotential Improvements:\n- The restaurant could give an option to ask for more garlic (maybe incorporate it into their menu\n- Price point is a bit high, but that is kind of expected for a restaurant in the financial district", "author": "Jeff M."}

This place definitely was a better alternative than the one on Irving, simply because of one reason. Easier to find parking. I also didn't realize that they close on the weekend, so just a heads up!\n\nMe and my girlfriend tried the 5 spice chicken with garlic noodles, which came with 3 egg roles as well; way more than what you'll get at other pho places for a rice plate. I tried the same dish, but substituted grilled pork for the 5 spice chicken. When the food came around, took about 15 minutes or so, it smelled freakin delicious. I love absolutely love garlic! However, my first bite of the garlic noodles came not as I expected. I kind of expected a little more for the amount that they advertised about it. The 5-spiced chicken on the other hand was so pretty darn goood. In my opinion. It was moist in the inside, yet the skin was perfected fried on the outside. On another note, the service was  quite amazing as the waiter came to our table to refill water every 5 minutes. Filled our cups even when our water was full. \n\nPrice: Each plate was about $10.25 each, which came out like around $24 total after tax.

Seriously, I can't count the number of missed calls that have been followed by some 5 minute long voicemail consisting of them talking with their friends about what they'd do in the event of a zombie apocalypse.  \n\nFeeling curious, I decided to pick up; and, as it turned out, they were just 2 blocks away at our Dad's office, and Daddy dearest was wondering if I could take them out to lunch because he just realized that he had a meeting to go to in less then 10 minutes.  (Yes, folks... write that one down and feel free to use it on your eldest child once they start working.)  Being the super-duper daughter and big sis that I am, as well as the possessor of a growing list of places to try having just started a new job in SF, I picked up the little bros and headed to Perilla, walking down Mission from Fremont.\n\nFirst tip?  Do not enter in the very first door following the entrance to Porticos.  That first glass door will lead you into a small entryway that'll put you face-to-face with a glass door through which you will see a staircase leading up to some office or another.  How do I know this?  Well, I tried opening that glass door, experienced some shock when I realized it was locked and that there was a buzzer to the left, experienced some disgust as I thought \"The garlic noodles here can't be THAT good.  What kind of a restaurant would make customers BUZZ their way in\"... and then a huge wave of embarrassment and shame, the degree to which I haven't felt since I peed in my pants in the 1st grade, as I realized that this wasn't in fact the entrance to the restaurant, but rather, to someone's office.\n\nI totally wanted to bolt to a different restaurant because I'm sure everyone sitting near the HUGE GLASS WINDOWS saw my EP-IC FAIL, but the little bros really wanted to try garlic noodles so I had to slink in, grateful for the dim lighting that hid my beet-red face.  \n\nThe restaurant was about 3/4 full, with a healthy amount of people waiting for take-out (always a good sign).  We were seated immediately, and given water and menus.  Their menu is pretty simple, but I've actually come to appreciate places that know what their strengths are and focus on doing those things really well.  When the waiter came around, we ordered their shrimp rolls (3 in every order) - $7.25, and 3 orders of garlic noodles - $11.75/each (one with beef for the youngest , one with curry chicken for the older one and one with shrimp for me).    \n\nThe shrimp rolls and accompanying peanut sauce were good, but not great.  Simply put, they were an adequate placeholder before we got to try the legendary garlic noodles which definitely met my expectations and are worthy of all the hype... until you start getting down to the last 1/4 of what they dump on your plate.  \n\nFrom where I was sitting I could watch as plate after plate of meat was taken from the kitchen to this small assembly area near the beverage refrigerator.  Once there, another woman would open up a rice cooker and then pile the garlic noodles on.  I know that this place can get pretty busy, and that it might not be realistic to expect the noodles to be \"fresh\" and made upon order, but having them at only slightly above room temperature was not that appealing.  You have to realize that what makes these noodles really good is the BUTTER... and I don't know about you, but the same butter that is freakin' ah-mazing as it melts on a fresh-from-the-oven piece of cornbread, is positively disgusting right from the refrigerated stick.  The same principle applies to these noodles.  They're good when you first start plugging away since they're still warm from the cooker, but as time passes, well, it quickly starts losing its appeal.  As far as the meat went, it came in at a 1:4 ratio to the noodles.  I mean, could they make it any less apparent that Perilla could just as easily be renamed \"Garlic Noodle House\"?  Anywho, the shrimp and beef were great, while the curry chicken was just so-so, swimming around with chunks of potato in a thin curry sauce.  \n\nAll in all, I'm a fan of garlic noodles, but I'd much rather learn how to make it myself so that it'll be nice and hot rather than coming back to Perilla.", "author": "Iona C."}

Well for starters, no one will want to come near you, which means you can hide in your cube or office for the rest of the day; no one nagging and bothering you in turn means higher productivity! A win-win situation for all...\n\nMy friend who works nearby has been raving about Perilla, so I came here yesterday with him. He arrived a little after the lunch rush at 1:15 PM and was able to immediately snag a table for us.\n\nFOOD:\n*Papaya Salad w/ Beef: OMG! One of the BEST papaya salads I've ever had. The perfectly julienned papaya and was mixed with basil and carrots and topped with peanuts, fried shallots, and grilled beef. The beef was perfectly grilled. It was tender, moist, and very well seasoned; savory with a slightly sweet aftertaste. All the ingredients were fresh and crisp and the combination of the veggies, peanuts, fried shallots, and nuoc nam dressing created a perfect balance of salty, savory, sweet, tangy, spicy and various texture combinations from the peanuts and fried shallots. \n\n*Charbroiled Beef w/ Garlic Noodles: YUMMY! Again, the beef was perfectly grilled and was super tender and flavorful. The lemongrass and garlic flavor was prominent but not overwhelming. It was so well seasoned that there was no need for the nouc nam sauce. \n\nAlthough Perilla is part of PPQ Crab Dungeness Island, I can tell there was a difference in their garlic noodles. Perilla's version is more soft with a slight bite to it and it's more buttery as opposed to garlicky; while PPQ's is more al-dente, oilier, and has a more distinct garlic flavor. Nevertheless, you can't go wrong with butter and garlic, so I can't say I like one more than the other. \n\nMy friend ordered the five-spice chicken (dark meat) which I tried a piece of and it was DELISH!!! The chicken was perfectly grilled producing a very crisp skin (as if it was fried) and the meat was moist, tender, and very flavorful. You can really taste each component of the five-spices: the star anise, cinnamon, clove, pepper, and fennel which produce the perfect balance of sweet, sour, bitter, pungent, and salty. \n\nPortions are HUGE, so you will definitely have leftovers for the next day. \n \nPRICES:\n*Apps: $5.25-$6.25\n*Salads: $7.50-$9\n*Garlic Noodles w/ Choice of Meat: $9.50-$10.50\n*Rice w/ Choice of Meat: $8-$9\n*Bun: $8-$9\n*Noodle Soups: $9-$10\n\nCCs accepted.\n\nSERVICE:\nI can't say, the waiters were the friendliest; but I can say they were fast and efficient. Although it was past the lunch hour rush, Perilla was still at 90% capacity and we got our salad within 3-4 minutes of ordering and then our entrees 2 minutes later. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR: \nSimple and minimalist with bare walls and clean wood tables and chairs. There's capacity for approximately 30 people. \n\nThe CON is they're ONLY opened Mon-Fri from 10:30 AM-3 PM which sucks a$$ b/c I no longer work nearby and it's not like I can take long lunches all the time. But, I'll definitely be back and/or go to their Irving Street location. \n\nMy recommendation is whenever you want to be left alone at the office, come to Perilla for their garlic noodles and request it w/ extra garlic!

After a gruelling 2 hour interview at a firm in SOMA, a friend and I decided to grab some quick lunch and chitchat and she recommended Perilla to me.\n\nThe menu at Perilla is super simple and everything is explained as is, if you aren't familiar with Vietnamese food. My friend ordered their Garlic noodles with meat and I opted for exactly the same, but with Veggies and Tofu. We also ordered a plate of their summer rolls to start with. Now, I am not particularly fond of Tofu and was rather disappointed that the chef couldn't eliminate that option for me. Turns out that they pre-make the garnish. Understandable. \n\nThe Garlic noodles were delicious. Not too garlicky that you'd end up with dragon breath and the tofu and veggies we cooked to a crisp. I could barely see any tofu since it was all shredded. My friend loved her order just as much. Their summer rolls were very refreshing on a sunny day. All in all, my tummy was very content with the food.\n\nThe restaurant is also very clean. And I loved the ambiance. You don't feel like leaving after your meal since it's a good place to just sit and chitchat \nand no one rushes you out, unlike a lot of other restaurants at SOMA.\n\nPrice-wise, it's very reasonable. Out lunch for two came up to $30.\n\nSo why only 3 stars? Rude service. Our server could use a smile on his face at the very least. Rudely telling me that the food is premade and cannot be altered doesn't count as good customer service. I realize that lunchtime might not be your favorite hours, but suck it up and stop being grumpy.\n\nPS: I will go back. I loved the noodles!", "author": "Ranjani S."}

The meat was well marinated and some pieces were cooked to a medium rare, which is good.\n\nService was fast and prompt.  I'd probably give it a higher rating if it was cheaper, but $11 for a viet plate with tons of noodles and minimal meat isn't too great!  Plus the vietnamese coffee that costed over $3 bucks was in a tiny glass!  For the size of that, it should cost only $2.  \n\nFor the area, this is probably one of the few viet restaurants!

Infused with garlic and butter, it was very good and everything I expected as I've tried something similar at other Vietnamese restaurants before.   Since you get a nice sized bed of noodles (along with whatever meat option you choose with your garlic noodles), I found it was also advantageous to just share two plates and give you friend half of your garlic noodles so you can limit the amount of garlic/butter that gets into your system.  The pork was thin, tender, and marinated with a teriyaki type sauce.  For the price, you cannot go wrong in this part of the SOMA Financial District area.  But like Wendy H said, it would have been nice to have more than one little broccoli on your plate.  Two or three little broccolis  would certainly help offset some of that butter that the garlic noodles are marinated in.  \n\nLunchtime tip: if you don't get here by sharp at noon, be prepared to wait as there is a swarm of people looking for the same less than $10 entrees you are seeking", "author": "Albie F."}

Their beef is juicy and tender, but the garlic noodles...mmmmmmm, so good.  The noodles are fresh egg noodles, mixed in with a whole lot of garlic powder and minced garlic.

The spring rolls could have used a little bit more shrimp but the vermicelli noodles were soft and you could tell they just made the spring rolls.  The Vietnamese coffee doesn't come in the traditional french drip so I was a little cautious but it was very flavorful and sweet..So good I wanted another one but not for $3.25.\n\nWould definitely frequent this place again if we are in the mood for Vietnamese food in the area.", "author": "Betty C."}

I love that Perilla something fierce, so I was particularly stoked when one of my coworkers suggested we go out to lunch to the Perilla nearby our office.\n\nThe food did not disappoint.  I had the vermicelli with veggies and some summer roll, and both of those things were delicious.  The cabbage was sweet, the mushrooms had the right amount of chewy-to-crunchy ratio, the tofu was a little sweet, and the noodles covered in fish sauce and Siracha were cool, smooth, and mysteriously hearty.  I'm a relatively new convert to summer rolls, too, but Perilla makes some of the best ones I've had - all the snap and crunch of fresh veggie inside a chewy, sticky rice paper!\n\nAnother interesting thing to note is that, though the menu seems small at first glance, there are at least a bajillion different ways to combine a handful of basic ingredients that kept me looking at my neighbors' meals thinking \"Ooh!  I wonder what that is?\"  And believe me - it all looks so good.\n\nI highly recommend thou get thee to a Perilla, but better to make it the one on Irving.

I know the waitstaff was doing its best, but my coworker was told they could seat a party of eight, only to find out once we got there that they meant they could seat a party of eight at two or three separate tables.  (Eight is a pretty huge number and it doesn't bother me they couldn't seat us together, only that they made it seem like they could).  The food wasn't long in coming out, but for anything else we wanted, we had to actually get up and find a server to help us.  And it was definitely noisy - I'm actually a bit surprised that such a small place can echo so well!\n\nSo, not really the place to go for a quiet or intimate meal, but if you can make it on an off hour or make it out to the Inner Sunset, it's absolutely worth it: if nothing else, the food will leave you thinking \"Hey, baby, where you BEEN all my life?\"", "author": "Becca S."}

I love vietnamese food so I know how it should be like. Their garlic noodles are nothing compared to Crustacean (or Thanh Long) and even PPQ.\n\nWell maybe it's just my experience because everybody seem to love Perilla. I came in 30 minutes before they closed at 3 pm, so I might got the leftover which were not that fresh.

Especially, reviews for places that have already racked up a shit load of reviews. \n\nI'm usually only motivated to write when I experience something unique and specific during my visit (good, bad, weird, funny etc.) so I'm going to bust out of my own personal pie slice and write about Perilla. \n\nThat's correct, I'm writing because nothing of noteworthy excellence, vileness, oddness, or humor has transpired for me at Perilla. \n\nThey do have this odd habit of NEVER bringing me my lemonade (and it's the GOOD kind of freshly made, ultra sour Vietnamese lemonade that makes my tongue and cheeks ache just thinking about it). This has happened so consistently I've given up ordering it (3 times in a row). Rather than get my panties in a bunch, I'm going to take this as a bit of Restaurant Parenting from the staff at Perilla.

I like waiters with opinions. At least I like them right up till they veer into \"fill your own damn water up\" territory. \n\nBriefly: \n-the garlic noodles are too greasy and soft. Get the small order ($3.25) it's plenty \n-they either loath vegetables here or value them the way I value jeans that are comfortable without falling into \"gangsta\" territory, I wish they'd adopt a more Asia-esque veggies to meat-noodles ratio (say closer to 2 to 1 rather than the current 1 to 4) \n-way too crowded during the regular workdays lunch period (11:30-1ish) \n\n*Rooster sauce = Sriracha but I grew up calling it that because as a wee tot there was no way in hell I was going to wrap my gums around \"sriracha\".

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-11-14", "description": "I've been here a few times and have always enjoyed the food. This time (10/12) I went with 6 friends/co-workers. We got there around 11:30, so we beat the lunch crowd and were able to get 2 tables for ourselves. If you come here during peak lunch, expect to put your name on a list and wait 10 - 30 min.\n\nI usually order the pork chops and garlic noodles, but decided to opt for the chicken curry and garlic noodles this time. The curry fell short of what I was expecting/hoping for. The sauce was very runny, which I did not care for, and it was not at all spicy as the menu had indicated. It also lacked flavor; it was rather bland for curry, but once I added my garlic noodles to it, it was a bit more tolerable.\n\nI also ordered the imperial rolls for us. I haven't found imperial/spring rolls at a restaurant that even come close to my grandmother's, but thought the est of the group might enjoy them. I was not impressed with how they were served. You get the rolls and fish sauce and that's it; no lettuce and mints. I guess that's to be expected in the financial district. The rolls were very crispy and the filling was better than many other places.\n\nMost of the others ordered five spice chicken with garlic noodles. I think the five spice chicken is their most popular item there and for good reason. It's super tasty. The flavor seems just right and the chicken is moist.\n\nI still like their pork chop with garlic noodles best though; 3 juicy, flavorful pieces that remind me of how their like in Vietnam, except I get them over rice in Vietnam.\n\nVietnamese iced coffee is pretty darn good here. Nice and strong, but not too sweet. Everytime I've had it here it's made fresh to order. They drip it with the Vietnamese coffee filter behind the cashier and bring it to you when it's ready.\n\nService is sometimes fast and sometimes slow, it just depends. Depends on what? I don't know. I've been in here when there was just my table of 2 and 2 other tables and the service took forever. Then again, I've been in here when it's really packed and the service was surprisingly fast.\n\nAnyhow, my 4 star rating is based off of my overall experience of this place including past visits.\n\nCurry I would rate 2 stars. Imperial rolls 2.5 stars. Pork chops and five spice chicken get 5 stars.\n\nPrice seems a bit high, but the portions are pretty hefty, mostly b/c you get so much garlic noodles. You really could eat half now and half later. Must also take into account it's in the financial district.", "author": "Dennis Z."}

If you are a carbophile, just get the BIG bowl of garlic noodles for $6.50. If you are a carb-conscious, this is not the right place for you. \n\nThree of us ate lunch here today. We ordered Imperial Rolls, Five Spice Chicken, Charbroiled Beef, and Charbroiled Shrimp. The Imperial Rolls were fantastic!!!! Thin, crispy skin and delicious and hot fillings. Mmmmmm.\n\nThe Five Spice Chicken was very delicious and flavorful. The chicken skin is so crispy. I thought it was good, and I hate dark meat! (Yes, they use dark meat for this dish. White meat doesn't even seem to be an option.) The Charbroiled shrimp was pretty good, too. However, the Charbroiled Beef was a bit disappointing. The quality of beef wasn't all that great. It was flavorless and not particularly tender. Portions for the meats are very limited. On the other hand, the garlic noodles that came with the meats could have been 3 separate meals for me. The plate also came with some broccoli. The Broccoli is a strange accompaniment. It's steamed plain broccoli with hoisin sauce that's been chilled. Why are they serving cold broccoli? I guess because it's cheap and easy.\n\nNow on to the much talked about garlic noodles. Yes, you will stink all day. I brushed my teeth after I came back to the office, but the garlic breath is too potent to be quelled. And I'm sorry I drank a soda or two. The burping was lethal. :( \n\nMy coworker came into my office and kept looking around and smelling her own shoes. She said something smelled strange and that she thought it was her shoes, she thought she stepped on something. I pretended that I didn't know what she was talking about and kept quiet. \n\nSmelly though it may be, the noodles are very tasty. It's a simple dish -  lots of garlic, butter, and chewy noodles. \n\nThe service was very fast. Our water glasses were never empty. By noon, there was a long line of people waiting for a table. It gets crowded and very loud. I felt bad for people waiting for a table, so I wanted to eat fast and get out of there. Maybe next time I will sit away from the door, so I am not reminded of the people out the door. \n\nWell, we all liked the place very much and we think this will be our regular lunch spot.

I had never ate at Perilla's.  Everytime I walked by to grab a meal at Portico, the wait line for Perilla was out the door.\n\nAnyhow, we arrived at 12 sharp and was seated at 12:10.

We lucked out as a few groups at the larger tables were finishing up.\n\nI already knew what I wanted to order based on Yelp reviews, the Five Spice Chicken Garlic Noodles.  It did not disappoint. The noodles were very garlic-y and just the right texture.  The meat was well-prepared and the skin crisp.  There was a little bit more fat than I expected, but no biggie.\n\nThe meal was fairly priced for the area, especially for a sit-in type restaurant.\n\nWill visit again if my craving for garlic noodles acts up.", "author": "S N."}

From 11:46 on you are probably waiting unless you send someone ahead to hold a table (which they tended to let people do).\n\nThroughout San Franicsco there are restaurants that manage to warp the price-quality continnuum.  They are able to charge much higher prices than the food would suggest they should be able to get away with -- given how much competition there is.  Mama's in North Beach was always one of those places for me.  Nothing bad about it.  It would even be a good place at 30% off-- but it is simply over-priced for what you get- and the lines make no sense at all.\n\nPerilla seems to be one of those places as well.  The restaurant is packed by noon.  People come and go getting their take-out orders.  But for what?  And in this case the food isn't even at a levelthat you could say \"at 30% less it would be a steal.\"  It's just not good.\n\nTheir signature garlic noodles were basically dry spaghetti with garlic and butter.  And everything else was nearly flavorless.  This was particularly noticeable in the 5-spice chicken which tasted like generic baked chicken.  But the beef was also a genuine disappointment.  Even the jasmine rice was dry and bland.   The spring rolls were okay but just okay.  The side of vegetables was 2 thin slices of cucumber per plate (or we assumed that was the role they played).\n\nAt about $12-13/person (entree + soda) they are not ripping you off.  The problem is you can get much better food even at the Rincon food court for $2-3 less.  That's what makes this restaurant really hover between 1 and 2 stars- it is both too expensive and likely over priced even if it were 20% cheaper.\n\nThe service is fine.  They don't hug you but they were friendly enough.  And like many small restaurants, the focus is on turning the tables.  Halfway through our appetizer the main courses arrived. The waittress even gave us a puzzled look as if to say, \"where should I put these?\"  Had we known the experience we were about to have we would have been able to offer a simple, \"in the kitchen, just bring us our check\"", "author": "William H."}

For me, chief among the offerings is the respectable, if not dazzling, Bun Thit Nuong (charbroiled pork on the menu). If that name doesn't register, it's the delicious Vietnamese combination of vermicelli noodles atop herbs and vegetables with grilled meat and then dressed with Nuoc Cham. What holds their version back some is that its best parts are the supporting cast. The noodles, fresh herbs, and well-balanced blend of fish sauce in the dipping sauce hold everything together well.\n\nBut the grilled pork, which ought to be the star of the show, comes off merely as good. For my tastes, I'd prefer it cooked on a hotter grill to get it seared a little more, and though tasty, a little more spice wouldn't hurt. Likewise, the imperial rolls -- I like them in my Bun -- need to fry in a little bit hotter oil. They're not soggy by any means, but nor do they have that flaky, crispy wrapper of a perfect imperial roll.\n\nAnd to add another voice to the request, I haven't seen Pho offered there, but would be all for them adding it!", "author": "Garnett L."}

Once you get seated, the waiters are very prompt, and the food comes right out quickly. I suspect this place is related to the Perilla out near Golden Gate park, which I went to and got sick over their not good greasy garlic noodles, so I've never tried the garlic noodles here. That doesn't necessarily mean they're bad here, just because they were at the other branch, but I don't want to risk it. Both times, I've had the shrimp vermicelli.  The waiters are always helpful and good about making sure there are no peanuts on my dish, as I'm allergic. You get a nice sized bowl of noodles, with shrimps and leaves and some sauce on the side. It's tasty and depending on the type of vermicelli you get, it's $9-10. It's not greasy at all. I've had both the Vietnamese iced coffee and the thai iced tea, and both are good.  The interior is very casual. It's not a place I'd come to specifically, but only because it's right next to work, because it's nothing special, just an averagely good lunch spot.

The shrimp rolls were OK, the peanut sauce was OK, the soup was, again just OK. And there is butter on the garlic noodles! Ick, big disappointment. The service was fairly fast, but I seemed to get a lot of servers' arms in my face because they reach all the way across the table instead of walking around to the other side of the table to grab dishes.", "author": "Corinthia C."}

They're not being rude, that's just how it is. Understandably, there are so many options in the city that it may work against them, but I would rather have indifferent service than for them to awkardly try to be friendly - that would be like my vietnamese parents showing affection, just weird. The price point is ok, not great for an Asian place but definitely less than an equivalent amount and quality of food anywhere else. And really why do they have to charge rock-bottom prices just because it's Asian food? I pay $10 for lunch at Boudin for crying out loud.", "author": "Mimi N."}

I could barely finish my plate but I forced it. I was in a food coma after but it was worth it. Too bad I discovered this place on my last day working in the city.

Now that they've gone wacky with their prices though, it isn't even average anymore.\n\nThere aren't many Asian lunch places in this neighborhood that can hold a candle to the ones out on Clement.  For awhile though, Perilla was taking a run at it.  You could get a plate/bowl of pretty respectable Vietnamese food for $7.50 or so.  Which, IMHO, is about what it should be. Now, they charge $8 for a bowl of vermicelli pork and an extra $2 for the spring roll that used to come free in the dish...and does in EVERY OTHER Vietnamese restaurant in the city.  \n\nWhatever.

That is Chinese people do not cook Vietnamese food well.  Basically, non-Vietnamese do not cook Vietnamese food well.  The spices are often not on point or even true to the cuisine.\n\nAs for Perilla, it is exactly that, a restaurant with Chinese cooks horribly bastardizing Vietnamese cooking.  It is food for the downtown office lunch crowd that's really trying not to overwhlem the gentile palate.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-04", "description": "Working in the Financial District, Vietnamese food alone is hard to come by, nonetheless, flavorful Vietnamese food.  Often times I complain to my co-workers how I wish my favorite Vietnamese restaurant PPQ, would open another location downtown.  Dreams do come true - well. . .almost.  My friend and I decided to try Perilla yesterday since we both had heard about it but hadn't had the chance to try it.  Even when we were waiting for our table we both exchanged our deep affection for PPQ on Irving and how nothing comes close to the quality and flavor of the dishes there.  My co-worker went recently and raved about the garlic noodles, but my immediate response was how could it be any better than the ones at PPQ Dungeness Island?  Anyhow, I ordered the charbroiled pork chop over garlic noodles while my friend ordered the charbroiled beef over garlic noodles.  We both agreed both meats were a bit overdone and dry, but the garlic noodles were very tasty.  I blame the thin-ness of the pork chop because the flavors were definitely there.  The texture of the garlic noodles was perfect and the garlic wasn't over the top nor too buttery.  As I was paying the bill, I noticed that the owner of my beloved PPQ on Irving was at the counter and then it hit me - could it really be true?  PPQ has finally hit the Financial District?  I'll definitely be going back because it's the yummiest Vietnamese food in the area - hands down.  Props to the owner of PPQ on making a move to the FiDi.", "author": "Jana H."}
