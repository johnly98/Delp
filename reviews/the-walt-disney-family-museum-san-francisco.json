Honestly, the museum is not what you would expect when you hear \"Disney Museum\", thinking first of bright lights, theme parks, laughing cartoons, and smiling children. Rather, the opening rooms of the museum are a bit sobering, with a focus on the toughest moments of Walt's life as he struggled to get started and make his brilliant ideas into reality. You hear about his failures and bankruptcies in his early companies and studios, which, although were certainly heartbreaking for him at the time, each taught him something and moved him closer and closer to the success. In particular, the museum, at least for the moment, offers a window into the early years of Disney Studios, especially into the lives of those who surrounded Walt, through an Exhibition on the Nine Old Men, the core group of animators at the studio which brought it to life. \n\nThe museum itself is easily accessible in terms of content, making us of multi-media displays and important artifacts from the era. You feel like you are going on a personal journey as you walk through the museum, with smooth transitions from one period to the next. The staff are very friendly and make sure you feel welcome. Do know that you can get lost in the content of this museum, though, and should expect to spend at least a few hours here. Overall, a highlight of my trip to San Francisco!", "author": "Tim K."}

I made a day trip out of it by taking advantage of Amtrak's buy-one get-one capital corridor promotion and the museum membership to the North American Reciprocal Museum (NARM) group. The Amtrak bus from Emeryville brought us to the Pier 39 and from there it was a $14 Lyft ride between the museum to the wharf. There is also a free bus called Presidigo that roams around Presidio and downtown that may be helpful for some weekenders visting.\n\nThe museum is a heartfelt tribute to Walt Disney and the warmth of staff members make the experience magical. Upon entering the staff member helping us with entry tickets gave us a great preview of the museum and perhaps noting how wind swept we looked, he helpfully pointed us to a free coat check/restroom downstairs from the cafe. \n\nThe museum tells Walt's story with as much creativity and diversity as you find in his many projects  You will travel his life via video, audio, photographs, sketches, paintings, models, memorabilia and trains. If you have a chance, catching a talk by a museum docent is a must. The one I managed to hear was a wonderful history of Disneyland, and much longer than the advertised 5-10 minutes. \n\nAt the end, the cafe and museum store await for more shopping. The cafe was decent though the food over-salted for my tastes. The museum store was a nice browse, but other than a set of postcards from artist Tyrus Wong, items were bit overpriced for me.\n\nIn all, this was a great place to spend an afternoon on a foggy day by the bay.", "author": "Lisa K."}

Being a big Disney fan, I always find it fascinating to learn more about his life, and the events that drove this man to become the visionary he came to be. I have read multiple books about Walt and seen multiple documentaries and movies, as well as having a large collection of books and items about the parks and characters. This was a totally different experience, for someone like me, that is familiar with the background story about Walt himself it was a validation that al I've read through the years was factual, getting to see and read some of the original telegrams and photographs was amazing. This museum has a great flow, you literally have to spend a great amount of time to see everything and it's a tribute to Walt Disney the man and his family. A great experience overall. \nI thought that it was so cool that they show classic movies at the theater and little princesses can come dressed up for a showing of Cinderella, etc! Such a fun and intimate setting! Finally the gift shop had many original items that you don't get to see at the parks. Also it's in such a beautiful area of San Francisco!

It was interesting to learn about Disney's life from beginning to end, and how his empire came to be what it is today. There are a lot of sketches, storyboards, character designs, etc., and it was cool to see the painstaking process of animation. You get information about the historical context of each stage of Disney's life, and how it impacted his work. Not going to lie, I was feeling a bit emotional in the last section that talks about Disney's legacy lol.

We did not visit the special exhibit at the time, only the basic part of the museum. I could have stayed here for hours! However there were some people in my party who grew a little bored and hungry. \n\nThat being said, even though the museum is \"Disney\", I do not know how suited it is for children. Much of the museum covers the history of Walt's family and the history of animation. While I found this fascinating, I can see how a child would become easily bored from all the reading. \n\nOnly a portion of the museum is devoted to Disneyland and Walt Disney World. At first this bummed me out. Then I realized how much \"Disney history\" focuses on the parks and how few really honor Walt's life and struggles. I knew Walt was a great man going into this museum, but he faced so many more struggles and hurdles than I thought. Turns out, Walt Disney and his family were real people (; \n\nTruly I wish I could have stayed longer. The surrounding area is very beautiful and peaceful too.

The museum is in the Presidio, right by Chrissy Field and the Golden Gate. Absolutely beautiful area. When we arrived, the only place to park is on the street. Luckily we found parking down the street from the museum. Ovviously,  SF parking isn't free so I paid $6 for 3 hours of street parking at a pay station. Plenty of time for us to explore the museum.\n\nAnyways, the building is a beautiful brick building and when you walk up they do a quick bag check (safety first!) Then when you enter -- to your right is where you buy tickets. While waiting in line (only one person ahead of us; they're pretty quick), my friend and I decided \"hey maybe we should just get a CityPass?\" So we decided that was the route we were going to go for so we had something to do after the museum. However, much to my surprise, the lady behind the counter who was going to help us was an old high school friend. We asked her about the CityPass to see if we can buy them there but she said they don't currently sell them in the museum but she was so kind that she offered us to be her guests for the day! We were super excited and so grateful (thaaaank you). After getting our tickets, we started our exploration. The museum is full of Walt Disney's memories, stories, pictures, etc, of himself, his family, and colleagues journey to making Disney what it is today. It was interesting, educational, and fun. It's a beautiful museum that will get any Disney fan excited! My favorite part of the museum is the mini Disneyland of what Walt envisioned Disneyland to be; it was pretty dope. Also, the gift shop is great -- as A Disney Pin collector, I was super excited to get a Walt Disney Family Museum pin. \n\nOverall, we had a great experience. For a Saturday in the middle of summer, the museum wasn't too crowded (there were still quite a few people there) and we were offered to be guests at museum for the day by a long time friend, it seems we were meant to be there. And, I'm so happy I finally got to visit the museum -- It's a gem!Usually I don't like visiting museums more than once but I'd be happy to visit it again.", "author": "Misty T."}

Wifey and I are a couple of Disney nuts so we enjoyed seeing the life and they times of Walt Disney. The museum is located at the Presidio which is located at this beautiful building right next to this huge grass area. Why a great place to hang out. \n\nEverything is well laid out. It will take a couple of hours to see everything but it is well worth the time. They present the whole animation process that Disney and his people invented. The best of it is one of Disney's multi plane animation photography thingy they invented. That thing is cool! We also bought tickets to have a reading by Claire Keane which was fun. \n\nIf I knock anything about the museum is this. You have to pay for everything extra. You pay to get in to see the main exhibit. If you want to see any of the other exhibits or talks...show me the money! This should be surprising as it's Disney but still. The other thing to note is it is more geared for adults. There are some child centric activities but mostly it's for people that can walk, watch, and read a lot of static displays. \n\nAll in all it's a wonderful place.", "author": "Don P."}

It's tucked away in the very nice presidio. I love coming to visit this part of San Francisco. Not to mention it's right on the water so you get a spectacular view. \n\nWe walked in and initially it feels a bit dull. But we paid (somewhat expensive, $25 a person). So you pass the front desk, your bag is checked by security, and your on your way. It starts with all of his awards he won for animation. Very cool seeing as I have never really read much into the man that was Walt Disney. \n\nOnce you enter the actual museum, it is amazing. It is full of historical articles and items from Disney's life. It shows in great detail where Disney met his original staff. It showed where he started his first animation company, that his first company failed etc. \n\nFun place to visit, and a fun place for adults and older kids to see.

The general admission is a self-guided tour which took us to 10 different sections of the museum in two levels. Non-flash photography is allowed inside (at least for the general admission tour)\n\nAfter touring the 1st section we were immediately directed to the second floor by way of elevator to where most of the exhibits were. Here is a summary of each gallery:\n\nLevel 1\n1- Small Beginnings and Dawn of a Career\n\nLevel 2\n2- Hollywood and Oswald, Mickey, & The Walt Disney Studios\n3- New Horizons in the 1930's\n4- The Move to Features\n5- \"We Were in a New Business\"\n6- The Toughest Period\n7- Postwar Production and Walt's Collections & Family Treasures \n8- Walt & the Natural World\n9- The 1950's & 1960's, The Big Screen, & Beyond\n\nLevel 1\n... continuing section 9 - Walt's Final Projects\n10- Epilogue and gallery exit. At exit there is a museum store as well as a cafe which is open to the public during museum hours.\n\nWhy is the museum in San Francisco as opposed to having it near Disneyland in LA?? Having the museum in San Francisco offers neutrality that could have been overshadowed in Hollywood, Burbank, or even Anaheim. It is the work of Walt's surviving daughter, Diane Disney Miller. \n\nOne thing was for sure... after touring the museum I wanted to drive to LA and visit Disneyland. It was interesting exploring the life and times from Walt Disney's humble beginnings to his success by interactive galleries that featured many artwork, artifacts, photographs, documents, videos, and animations.

So if you're planning to learn all about him, then spend at least 3 hours! Go earlier because the museum does close pretty early. I underestimated the length of the place and didn't gauge the timeframe well.

The only downside is that it is so far from Disneyland down in Anaheim that it may make doing both an issue for some.\n\nThe museum, located in the Presidio complex, is steps away from Lucasfilm & within sight of the Golden Gate Bridge, making it an ideal location for tourists & travelers. \n\nIts content crosses all media types, with audio visual & even interactive elements, & like most things connected with Disney, a substantial gift shop with many exclusive & hard to find items. The museum has a core collection & special exhibits that rotate regularly. As you can imagine, there is often merchandise tied into these special events available for purchase. While that may sound cynical to some, it's more often than not quality products that should appeal to souvenir hunters & collectors alike. \n\nI've visited twice & spent hours each time as there is so much to pour through. While I'm more engaged by Disney history than many, Walt & his legacy have had a substantial enough impact on popular culture that even casual fans should find themselves immersed in this look back at the life of one of the 20th century's most gifted entertainers.", "author": "Shawn F."}

To find a Museum about Disney on my vacation while in San Francisco? Made the trip complete. \n\nThis is how generous Walt Disney was, even to this day. Military get in *free*. Wow. That was such a blessing and I know Walt is smiling as he saw my face. We spent over two hours here, lets get started with this review.\n\nWalking in, you start with the Disney family history. The family had their hard times and when Walt Disney first came to Marceline Missouri by train, his eyes were opened to an Idyllic lifestyle. He always hung onto the images of Marceline Missouri and built that into his Main St USA theme parks. Walt felt family was very important and that's how Disneyland was first started. He wanted a place where a father can take his kids on the weekend, to kick back and let loose. \n\nThe museum is really an American treasure. It shows the history and progression of film and how art was integrated into the medium. Walt was a pioneer in this field. He invented special cameras and technologies, won awards and kept on pressing on during and after WWII. \n\nHere's a story, it's a glimpse of the mans generosity. Walt knew his artists needed to be cutting edge. He goes to a few local art schools and was laughed at except one. He spun it, train my artists. Once my movie is finished, I will pay you in full. True to his word, the movie was finished and Walt paid the final bill. Years later, the proprietor was sick and her home & the school was about to being foreclosed. Walt heard this news, paid off all her debts, set up healthcare for her and a trust to be used until her passing. Folks, that is on a level of sainthood.\n\nSeeing all the wonderful technologies and accomplishments until his passing, Walt Disney was a great American. This museum is a testament to the mans life.

Neither did I until visiting this museum. All of the awards he received during his lifetime, and the creation of the parks. \n\nYou'll also learn about how he use to work on a farm, all the hardships his family endured and came out on top, good values that most take for granted, it was a very educational and took you down memory lane from early years up to the present. \n\nThere are items from Oscars, to medals, to actually internal memos, to the jeep he drove in the war, etc. There are live recordings of him, you'll even get an opportunity to operate one of the animatronics as the puppeteers did, its just simply too much to list in this review you'd be reading forever. \n\nTickets in my opinion were a bit high, if you are a student definitely ask for student discount adult tickets are $25 per person. Parking is free which is nice as if you are in the San Francisco area there is no free parking anywhere. \n\nYou are allowed to take as many photos as you like, so long as the flash is OFF as in NO FLASH, its amazing how many people don't understand that, especially with camera phones, a flash is a flash; I digress; as in true Disney fashion all rides must end at the gift shop, so does this tour whether guided or self-guided you'll end at the gift shop. Speaking of said gift shop; it was very pricey and surprisingly there were not a lot of specialty pins and magnets as you would find at any of the parks. I really couldn't justify paying $25 and then spending another $40 on a pin and a magnet. They have a small cafe inside on the bottom level\n\nIf in the area, its worth checking out if you have the time, but again it can get pricey if going with a large group. Looks are deceiving when you approach the building looks large, but in reality the museum is not also making it hard to justify the entrance fee. \n\nIf you're a die hard Disney fan, you'll learn the reasoning behind one of Walt's sayings \"Let's us not forget, that it all started with a mouse\".", "author": "M W."}

If you bring your kids they'll likely be bored. It's a museum focused on the man behind the mouse, Walt himself. Teenagers might be a little more interested but young kids probably not. It's a gorgeous museum and you learn about the evolution Disneyland, Disney films and the empire that we've come to love. I would recommend to anyone studying cartooning or film because you see some of the early ways cartoons were made. It's also fun to look at the old films made by Walt and Co.

Located in the Presidio area of San Francisco is where you'll find this wonderful exhibit. \n\nSome might say why this isn't closer to Disneyland or anywhere in the Southern California area. I even ask myself this same question but its definitely a breath of fresh air to be showcasing everything that Walt Disney stood for. Since this place opened in 2009, many people may not even realize its here. And as far as the address, make sure you put in the correct zip code (in your phone or GPS) because there are TWO Montgomery Streets in San Francisco.\n\nI came here on the morning of Monday, Dec. 26th with my lady and her sister. The admission price was $20.00 (which is not a bad deal at all). Not to mention, I also brought a printable coupon good for $3.00 off. There are other various discounts (AAA member, military, etc.) so be sure to do your research online prior to visiting. Parking could be a bit difficult since everything is metered so make sure to watch how much time you spend inside. \n\nWhat makes the museum unique is that there are ancient artifacts that were actually used when Walt Disney was still in its early stages. Everything that includes actual cameras, film strips, interactive galleries, equipment, classic Disney character figurines, drawings, animation, music, and even audio being given from Walt Disney himself. There is even a 12-foot diameter model of Disneyland when it first opened in 1955. This place more or less bring Walt's timeline to life. From when he was born (in 1901) to his death (in 1966).\n\nOne thing that I do want to point out is that I do NOT recommend bringing kids here! Some might think if it has \"Disney\" written on the building, kids will love it. Just about everything here is more history-related that the youngsters will find boring. What I found educational is that Walt Disney went through very humble beginnings while getting started in the comic and film business. This place explains how he started his life in Illinois drawing animals to his adult life in Kansas until finally settling in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFinally, while walking in the building, you will see a picturesque view of the Golden Gate Bridge. Additionally, there is a gift shop to purchase Disney souvenirs as well as a small cafe that sells coffee and sandwiches. Overall, this place is a must see for anyone that wishes to know much more about the history of Disney and its characters.

I gained an appreciation of him as being a risk taker (who occasionally failed) and an innovator in the field of animation.  There are a lot of personal items as well.

I'm glad that I did; the overall experience was interesting and I especially appreciated Disney's resilience in the face of early failure, his strength and optimism, and his management style.  \n\nThat said, there were a few things that were frustrating and these surprised me, given the Disney name.  In particular, the rooms didn't introduce the flow of their story.  You'd walk into a room and  it wasn't clear which direction to go - what are you telling me, and why?  For someone who was passionate about storytelling, this seemed ironic.  Also, each room had lots of information in print, which works poorly in a crowded room where you end up craning over other's shoulders just to read whatever is written.  There were some really great interactive elements, but more would improve the experience.  \n\nJust as an example, we went downstairs because the sign said, \"learning room\" and I thought that maybe there would be something to learn.  Instead, there was an exhibit with the art of another cartoonist, but no introductory sign to say why this person had any relationship to Disney, why his work mattered, or even what the \"story\" (introduction, why-it-matters, conclusion) of this exhibit was.  We looked and looked, but never found a \"learning room.\"\n\nAlso, there was a section about his conflicts with labor and how much they upset him, but though I searched, I couldn't see any resolution.  Why were the workers striking?  In the end did they get better wages?  Is Disney known now for being a fair employer?  The lack of conclusion about this made me suspect that Disney was not (and perhaps still is not?) employee-friendly, but that may not be accurate,,, just an unanswered element to what is really a fairly relevant question.\n\nAlso, the overall price was expensive - not \"crazy\" expensive, but enough that I expected a bit more.    So - worth a visit, but I wouldn't go back... and do hope that maybe the exhibit design team invests a bit more in how they introduce each element of the exhibit, since even minor changes would have improved a good experience and made it great.", "author": "Katherine S."}

OK, yes, we are Disneyphiles. We love everything Disney. And I guess some people would not need two entire days. But we wanted to read every caption and see everything and see the movie Pinocchio and the special Pinocchio exhibit.\n\nIf you are visiting San Francisco with children, this museum is an absolute must. If you are a fan of all things Disney, you must visit this museum. Even if you have been to the Walt Disney special exhibit in Hollywood Studios in Florida, you still want to visit this museum. There are things here that you will not see anywhere else ever.\n\nIt is definitely an adventure just finding the museum. It is certainly out of the way. But getting there is part of the fun. The public transportation system, consisting primarily of buses (the train system is not nearly as extensive as in other cities such as New York city), will take you just about anywhere in the city.\n\nMy recommendation is to arrive first thing in the morning because it's hard to know how much time you will actually need. We thought we would need three or four hours. It turned out we needed two full days.\n\nThere is a lot to see. My favorite was the miniature Disneyland. I stopped and listened to every recording of Walt's voice. I read everything there was to read. I saw everything there was to see. I was not bored for one second.\n\nEven the food in the caf\u00e9 was delicious and surprisingly not overpriced. The employees could not have been more friendly and helpful and professional and kind.\n\nOnce we finally had to leave, a member of the staff was happy to call a taxi for us.

The audio clips were wonderful and really told the store. I will need to go back to finish part two of the museum. \n\nI suggest you either bring food and leave it in your car or take a break and eat at the caf\u00e9. We were 1/3 through and took a break at the caf\u00e9. The museum is really intense and chuck full of information.\n\nThe book store is not like going to Disneyland.

I am a certified Disney nut and am so pleased that this museum is so beautifully done. It certainly does Walt justice. \n\nFrom the moment you walk in, you can feel that Disney quality in the atmosphere. The music, the cast members, the service, the quality, the attention to detail... everything is there when you enter the lobby.\n\nThe museum takes you on a journey through Walt's life. From his childhood and family history, to his time with the Red Cross overseas in France during WWI, to his early successes (and failures), to the birth of Mickey Mouse, through his mega success as a visionary, artist, and entrepreneur. You walk from room to room in chronological order. It's a multimedia experience with video, audio, artwork, historical photos and letters, written history, and even an animatronic tiki bird! \n\nThere are some amazing items that belonged to Walt that I was awestruck to see in person; such as the special Oscar award with the seven little Oscars he was given for Snow White, the Showman of the World award, and mementos he brought home from France. There are also great anecdotes and family photos (including a photo booth strip of Walt and Lilly).\n\nThere is such a rich treasure of information at the museum I could spend all day and night there taking it in.

I'm not a huge fan of Disneyland or the characters/brand but there was enough here to keep me interested for hours.\n\nIt's a really comprehensive museum. We spent 3.5-4 hours there including a lunch break in the cafe.

What a great exhibit place with all things dedicated to Walt Disney himself. All Disney fanatics, this is a MUST! You will fall in love. My boyfriend, who's not a big of a fan as I am, even enjoyed this place. He was very impressed with how much details this museum was able to get on Walt. He thought it was really well done and very interesting. There are two levels for this museum. $20 for adults. There was a small caf\u00e9 where you can buy sandwiches, salads, pastries, drinks and coffee drinks in case you get hungry. \n\nMost people aren't aware that Walt Disney isn't just known for only creating Disneyland. His passion for artwork and cartoons and his perseverance to \"make it\" is what I commend him for. He came to California with only a few bucks under his name. He was fearless. When the bankers doubted him for his loans, he proved people wrong. He wasn't vengeful...he was a down to earth hard working man. The classic films he made like Dumbo, Pinocchio and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs are still popular to this day.\n\nThe most popular and favorite room is the Disneyland room. Pictures, short video clips, and text inserts with all things DISNEYLAND. It was freakin amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I especially love seeing vintage Disneyland photos. Such a beautiful, happy place Walt built.\n\nI have to warn you about the last room though. It was about Walt's death. I knew this was coming and I read above it on Yelp before hand. I got choked up. My throat felt tight and I had to hold back my tears. If I wasn't wear lash extensions, I would have let those tears run. The cartoons artists drew photos and cartoons about this solemn news and it was just so heart breaking. I could only imagine the day of when the entire world heard about the news. \nWalt Disney, you were such an incredible man. Every time I stepped through the gates of Disneyland and I see that light glowing in your apartment above the fire station, I stop and thank you for creating such a magical place. \n\n\nSo glad I finally got to check this out.

First off, they close at 4:45 P.M. so I wouldn't advise to come that late because they will only allow you to be there until 6:00 P.M.  We didn't go that late but I asked an employee at the end of our visit because I was curious since we'd already been there for over 3 hours.\n\nIt's located in the Presidio, lovely clean and all around nice area of San Francisco (next to the Marina District).  Parking was easy too.  We parked in the street right in front but I know there's also a lot in the back of the building.\n\nI wasn't sure about the temperature inside and really didn't want to lug my coat so I left it in the car.  The temperature inside was just right but I did notice that they have a coat check downstairs next to the ladies room in case you don't want to carry your outerwear.\n\nThe entire museum is chock full of history with exhibits, interactive devices, etc.  You won't be bored here I promise you that.  And there are plenty of places to sit if you're feet and back start to pain you like mine did.  Mostly towards halfway through.\n\nThere's a small caf\u00e9 to the left as you walk in and we shared a small \"Walt's Favorite Beef Chili\" bowl topped with cheese & onions before we started.  Wow, that was really good stuff and I am going to seek the recipe!  No hamburger, but chunks of beef!  They also have complimentary water next to the cash register.  \n\nAfter a few hours of walking around you think it's the getting to the end but it's not.  The place is really quite large with 2 floors.\n\nI highly recommend that if you are going to visit, plan on staying at least 3 hours to get the full effect of the amazing Mr. Walt Elias Disney.  His daughter Diane is the co-founder and she gives so much of her father and herself in this time capsule that dates back to when her father was only a young ambitious teenager.   \n\nMuch to see, read, and hands on.

I had read a lot on Walt's life already but I was excited to see a lot of items from his life in person and whatever else the museum had. \n\nI was pleasantly surprised by how large it was (17 galleries I believe?). I was picturing maybe 3 big rooms. The museum has a nice flow to it. The first floor is his childhood and life before Disney and then you hop on the adorable elevator themed like a train car and ride up to the second floor where you enter Hollywood. The little details of this place are what make it as magical as the man himself, even down to the light hearted Disney sound track that plays throughout. Even having read books on his life, I still learned things I'd never known about him. The highlight for me was the grand model of Walt's dream of Disneyland, but there are a lot of other interactive areas that I wasn't expecting and loved like the animatronic tiki room bird you can learn how to animate.\n\nI think kids might find this museum a bit heavy on the reading and old timey pictures, but teens and adults who love Disney should enjoy this place. We went in the morning on a rainy Friday and I was shocked that there was a good amount of people in there so it seems to still be a happening place.

I've been a huge Disney fan for as long as I can remember and this museum has been on my radar for quite a few years and I was surprised and taken here. *FYI the way to my heart is Disney oh and food lol* The Walt Disney Family Museum is located in the lovely and historical Presidio area of San Francisco and features the history and legacy of Walt Disney along with tons of artifacts and interactive features. The museum itself features about 10 or so galleries and then they have special exhibits that are separate from the museum, the one they have now is Wish Upon A Star: The Art Of Pinocchio.\n\nOnce you walk into the museum you are just overcome with so much joy and so many emotions, it was like that for me throughout the entire visit. You are met with a life size cardboard cutout of a young dapper looking Walt Disney and then after you pass the ticket counter there are a few cases showcasing Walt Disney's accomplishments. For example all of his 22 Academy Awards that he won are on display and it's just nice to see all of his accomplishments. Now we all are familiar with Walt Disney for making all of these amazing movies that we know and love and of course for building the \"Happiest Place On Earth\" Disneyland (sorry but this is the only Disney park I acknowledge since he didn't build the others) but here we get a glimpse into his life and how he became the amazing man that he was and the man that has brought joy and happiness to all of our lives in one way or another.\n\nYou get to see and experience so many amazing things here. It's a journey through his life from beginning to end, all the trials and tribulations and how Walt Disney Studios or Disneyland almost never happened. There are the first original drawings of Mickey and Minnie Mouse on display, many of the drawings of his most famous movies like Peter Pan, Pinocchio, Snow White and so on. You get to see the process it took to make certain movies, original artwork, various cameras used to film said movies and various excerpts and history. There are random telephones scattered throughout each exhibit where you can listen to Walt to about Disneyland, making films, talking to his brother Roy about the business and you just get to hear his take on things. I really enjoyed that because I just love to hear his voice and hear how passionate he was about his craft and his business, he wanted nothing more than to make people happy and smile.\n\nOne of the last exhibits and my absolute favorite was the Disneyland exhibit, I got all giddy and child like when stepping foot in there. There are many posters of current and past rides from the park, history of particular rides and the most amazing aerial view replica of Disneyland. I was told that this replica was from when Walt built it and how he saw it, so from the late 60's before many of the rides we love were built. It's amazing how one mans vision could create such an amazing place. Aside from the replica they had one of the Autopia cars on display, it was a bit small so I'm guessing it was from the Midget Autopia, they also had one of the audio-animatronic birds from The Enchanted Tiki Room on display. It explained what his vision was for this show, how it came about and you were able to control the bird to talk or sing. \n\nThis museum is simply amazing and while I've read books about Walt and watched various documentaries about him I didn't know a lot of the stuff that I learned here. It really truly opened my eyes about how amazing he was and how much he has been a part of my life since a child. While I was a ball of emotions throughout the entire museum I really got sad at the end which talked about Walt's final years, makes you wonder if he lived longer how the Disneyland might have changed or what movies he would've made. Just a lot of what ifs! In conclusion if you are a Disney fan or if you are looking for a great museum I highly recommend coming here and give yourself about 1 1/2-2 hours to see and explore everything.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

Translation = lots of relatively cheap parking (for SF that is!) and a GREAT view of the bay and Golden Gate Bridge if you walk around the back of the museum. There are not many places that are easy to park and feel so open in SF but the Presidio is one of them! It doesn't hurt when you run into a pop up food truck event there once in awhile too! \n\nMuseum stuff: As far as museums go, if you are a Disneyphile like myself - this place is a must. TONS of memorabilia from the development of Walt's first cartoons and movies to the idea and development for Disneyland and WDW! It's a little pricy to get in - $20 for adults ($15 for students) but to me its always worth it to see the collection of pure Disney in one place. Also, take note that they have different speakers and events once awhile - last time we were there, they were screening a couple of early animated movies (can't recall which right now - sleeping beauty maybe?) which were FREE. You just had to let them know earlier so they could give you a ticket for the theater and reserve your seat. There's a small cafe inside the museum which serves some pretty nice food - pricy of course, since theres usually not a lot of options for food around there, but good for a small snack. \n\nOverall: Of course we will probably be back someday.

They also have regular exhibits that pass through, such as Eyvind Earle and Mary Blair, where you see the work of some great Disney artists.\nYou'll also see a number of Walt's awards, a model of Disneyland during Walt's lifetime, an original Autopia car that was at the park on opening day, a collection of miniatures that Walt collected, and much, much more.\nI am a NARM (North American Reciprocal Museum) member of a different museum, so I was able to get into the Disney museum for free by showing my museum membership card and paid $5 to see the special, Eyvind Earle exhibit.

But I kinda felt like checking it out. It was worth it. When I went they had a whole entire Pinocchio exhibit, it was a highlight of my tour for sure. I had to pay a little extra to see it but It was worth to see. The pinocchio exhibit is really quiet and dim and there for a special time. It really opened my eyes on the movie and the work behind it. They had some insane collectibles that are pure priceless. \n\nAhem now aside from bringing myself here, I would not suggest bringing kids here at all. It's really long and there's a lot of walking. A lot of reading and things kids just wouldn't understand. Just don't bring them. Okay moving on.\n\nNow in the main museum I was shocked by how it just seemed to just keep going room after room, it was a very long walk. 3 hours at least to check it all out. Now some of the stuff here is insane and crazy I even got to see with my human eyes. Tons of cameras, drafts, sketches, war collectibles, and TONS of information on Walt and his company. It's like a in person documentary, but you get to see real stuff, is it better than that? A lot of this I didn't even know existed and or how, OH that's how that happened thing. The museum has connected many dots for me on the history and it's really well floor planned. \n\nThe only problem I have with the entire exhibit is it's really hard to find a place to sit. My grandpa needed to break for a little from all the walking and standing. The first seat we saw was on the second floor around a hour through. We ended up taking a long break at least 20 minutes to relax. The room dedicated to Walt was really cool, and to my extent the technology seemed to improve over the length of the museum. Really blowing me away (you'll know I mean when you walk in okay) Anyways It was worth every penny to check this place out. \n\nA really good thing about the place is the people that work here are really nice. I mean I would hope so since a very select few would even apply to work here anyways. But the exhibits had security and lots of camera's to prevent stealing. It would be impossible I swear. Anyways in the main exhibit you can take pictures but with no flash of course which is nice. In the pinocchio one you can't even take pictures at all.  \n\n\nOverall great place to visit and relax after you're done. I ended up having a coffee and sitting outside enjoying the cooler weather and bridge before returning to my hot home. This place is a must see in my opinion.", "author": "Noah B."}

I was in a bit of a hurry so I only spent an hour and a half there, but could have easily stayed much longer. If you have the time, I encourage you to listen to each and every audio clip and explore the interactive exhibits. \n\nThe only disappointing thing for me was that there is very little about the planning and development of the theme parks.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-21", "description": "I should mention something first: iwould not suggest this museum for families with small children! Just because it's Disney, doesn't mean it's Disneyland. It's a museum. As such, small kids will probably be bored out of their minds without the patience to take the time to go through it. \n\nNow, onto my review: \n\nNot a bad tour. For only like $15 for student pricing, the price is good. It's packed full of Walt memorabilia. The museum is about 75% based on Walt's life and career, with about 25% extra about his family history, character history, and Disney parks. I'm a big Disneyland nerd, but I learned a lot here about Walt's humble beginnings. There was so much memorabilia and so much to read, so my only critique is that each room didn't have a defined \"flow...\" even though room to room went chronologically, going around each room, the chronology wasn't clear; do you start going clockwise around the room? Or counter-clockwise? Only one small other critique: many of the rooms had audio exhibits, but the audio from the exhibits mambos over itself, so it wasn't very easy to focus and listen to any one thing in particular.\n\nAnyway. All of the drawings, the telegrams, the cartoon notes, the movie cels.... all of that was really neat. Even getting towards the end of the museum and seeing Walt's collections of miniatures and stuff like that, that was cool. I loved the Disneyland diorama. It was so detailed! It would be really cool to see more Disneyland memorabilia in the museum. \n\nWalt Disney was truly inspirational, and he imagined so many wonderful things during his career. I loved the way the museum presented his career path and the growth of his ideas. You really see from start to end, where he started with caricatures and drawings in his school papers, to the animated films, the live- action films, and then to the creation of audioaimatronics. Every step of the way, Walt was bringing what was in his imagination to life. Really fun!", "author": "Angela H."}

It was lovely learning about his long and successful marriage and his lovely children.  I was surprised to learn that Walt had special fondness for the Bay Area and that his daughter, Diane, was a San Franciscan and had the responsibility of seeing to the development of the museum . \n\nIt is beautifully done and is in a majestic and historically significant  location. The Presidio is one of the loveliest spots in the City. The rest area between exhibits offers a spectacular view of the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\nFor film-making buffs, the explanation of the camera tricks used to create the animation Walt Disney developed is very educational.\n\nif it's lunchtime, the restaurant is great!

From the moment I saw the first gallery, you could say I went on a \"feel trip\". Man, it was so bittersweet to see all the history about these amazing films that consumed my entire childhood. The way they were made, the process that Walt Disney went through, etc. it's easy to think that these were simple films to make. Think again. Walt was constantly being challenged to basically beat time itself. He revolutionized animation in a way we will never truly understand. Every gallery that I entered went deeper and deeper into his career and the love and passion that he put into this work up until that day that he died. Look at Disney today, it's a constant reminder of what Walt has brought to every new generation. Just an incredible experience.\n\nI highly suggest allowing yourself at least 1 hour for the museum, though if you want to truly see (and hear) everything, I would recommend planning for 2 hours. You also don't want to miss out on the gift shop! I mean, that is unless you are tight on your budget, then I highly suggest steering In a different direction (as you may spend 2-3 times the actual ticket price on awesome Disney stuff).\n\nWarning: the final gallery that displays Walt Disney's death is an absolute heart breaker. So sad, yet a very proper way to end what is an amazing presentation. \n\nFinal verdict: Walt Disney Family Museum is a must visit, a bucket list item for any true Disney fan, an adventure, a learning experience, a fun filled hour that truly let's you immerse yourself in the world that Walt Disney helped us build today.", "author": "Alex B."}

Adult admission is $20, kids under 6 are free, and you get $5 off if you're a student.  \n\nThis museum is about the life of Walt Disney and the amusement parks are just a small piece of Walt's legacy. It's a self-guided tour between two floors. Walt's family life and professional life are presented by his daughter in a loving and interesting series of galleries full of memorabilia, photos, and very well done multimedia presentations. It was an amazing journey through Walt Disney's life. There were so many things to read about his life, timeline of events and recordings at every station . If you are a fun of W. Disney you will find it engaging and truly inspiring about how a very talented and determined Walt Disney put his stamp on everything related to his company and built an entertainment powerhouse from very modest beginnings. \n\nPlan on at least 4 hours and spend time in the details - it is fascinating and enjoyable. There's also a small gift shop, offered a few original t-shirts, pins and key chains. Near the end of the tour, be sure to take your time to soak in the amazing views of the Golden Gate bridge as you walk towards the finale. Then you enter a room that contains a very cool miniature of Disneyland that is completely decked out and very detailed.", "author": "Steve N."}

From \"Steamboat Willie\" to \"The Sword in the Stone\", this experience is an amazing portrayal of not only Walt Disney himself, but the franchise that is Disney. I found myself remembering films that I had seen decades ago, but didn't know that they were Disney productions. Walt was truly a visionary ahead of his time.\n\nAllow yourself minimum of 2.5 hours as there is a LOT to take in. Actually, it's almost overwhelming. I went with my mother so, it was nice to be able to chat about our experiences with Disney even though we are generations apart. I suppose that's the beauty of Disney films and productions. \n\nBy the time I had come to the end of the exhibit, I was in tears. Good tears though :) I won't give away as to why, but you'll figure it out during your next visit. \n\nThanks Walt.", "author": "Benjamin F."}

In case you hate Walt and his empire, you can stare at the Golden Gate instead. Nice view of that and the Bay!\n\nThis place focuses more on Walt's life and family, and the development of Disneyland and the classics. Disney World gets just a few honorable mentions. There is plenty to see here, and some interactive stuff too. The model of the 1955 Disneyland is impressive and so much fun to look at! \n\nAlthough my husband wanted to take me to the zoo on the rainy Saturday after Thanksgiving, I'm glad I made him choose an indoor event. This was the perfect way to spend the afternoon.\n\nHere is my list of recommendations:\n\n*Students: bring your ID for a $5 discount. Seniors: you get the same discount, too.\n*Be prepared to spend two hours minimum. We arrived an hour and a half before closing, so we were rushed at the end.\n*Coat check is downstairs if you don't want to carry it around.\n*Bathrooms are located in two spots: at the entrance/exit and about 2/3 of the way through the walk.\n*Because of the bathroom locations and because this is more of a behind-the-scenes scoop on Disney, I wouldn't recommend it for children under 10. Not enough interactive stuff for them, and talk of \"grown-up stuff\" like Walt's first animation business filing for bankruptcy will bore them. This is definitely for the kids trapped in adult bodies.\n*As this is in California and is aimed at Disney fans, I believe that this is a given, but it's a huge help if visitors have previously visited Disneyland and remember it. Visitors who have not been to Disneyland will still enjoy, but there won't be a frame of reference for the creation of Disneyland.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

The exhibits are presented in chronological order, from Uncle Walt's early days as a cartoonist, through his experiments with animation, selections from the famous (\"The Band Concert\") and the not-so-famous (\"The Flying Mouse\"), the Disneyland exhibit taking up the most space, and the final year of his life.  You can listen to taped interviews by Disney and his associates, and see the actual equipment used in the movies, the Circle-Vision camera, and a large-scale model of the Mouse House.  Many secrets are revealed here, including a big project in the Sierras that never happened.  Those who like the behind-the-scenes stores will be like a chocoholic in See's Candy here.  (Note:  photography is allowed as long as it's not flash.)\n\nExtras:  An art studio for the kids.  My daughter made a dinosaur diorama (Primeval World), and a 12-frame animation for the zoetrope.  She loved adding her own sound effects to one scene in \"Steamboat Willie\", and had to push her way in because the other kids loved this part too.  We were going to watch Dumbo, but he was pre-empted by a talk by dancing Mouseketeer Bobby Burgess;  he signed our copy of his book.\n\nI'll repeat myself about the directions, from the original post:  When San Franciscans think \"Montgomery Street\", they think the Financial District.  So does Mapquest.  When you're inputting the address \"104 Montgomery Street\", Mapquest and your GPS will put you on the corner of Montgomery and Sutter, even if you put Zip Code 94129.  My suggestion:  enter 2770 Lombard Street;  this will put you at the Lombard Gate of the Presidio.  Then follow the signs to \"Main Post\", and when you get close, you'll see signs for \"The Walt Disney Museum\".\n\nI can easily understand Disney lovers making a special trip to San Francisco only to go to the WD Family Museum.

The exhibition has a variety of multimedia elements - the touch screens, movie screens and headsets for some narratives. A lot of effort put into building this family museum.\n\nI enjoyed this museum so much... Lots of stories I didn't know about Walt Disney or just the Disney brand itself.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-25", "description": "Great place to visit and a must visit for any Disney fan. I've never been to the Presidio area before, and dang, it is sooooo nice and unlike the rest of the city. There's so much space and you do not at all get the sensation that you are in the middle of the city. The park and views are beautiful and the drive to this museum is gorgeous lined with tall trees!! It also overlooks the water and Golden Gate Bridge, seriously a million... or in San Francisco, this view is more like $10 million dollars worth!!\n\nIt was my first time here. After learning about this museum, I knew that I had to visit. So on our most recent trip to San Francisco, my mom, brother and I made a visit. Unlike the rest of most of San Francisco, parking here is paid parking 7 days a week. There is no free Sunday parking. The museum is a brick building and it is much bigger inside than it looks from the outside. We found parking right at the door. Parking is $1.80/hr, max of 3 hours. I paid for a full 3 hours because that will surely be less costly than any ticket I could receive. \n\nOn the main level is security where you enter, the ticket counter and the gift shop. The museum is technically 3 stories, with 2 stories and the the lower basement level. You go through Disney's life from when he was born in Chicago, to moving to Kansas, to enlisting in the military, to his career struggles to moving to California, to finally becoming a success, and to his death. It was quite the learning experience. I would say 2 hours is a fair amount of time to spend if you want to take your time to see everything. I honestly could had spent more time if I really did look at EVERYTHING... but time did not permit us to. I enjoyed seeing his early artworks and even many stuff I also did not know about. They have a film that they show also and that is complimentary and shown on the basement floor. I had thought it was maybe a 15-30 minute showing, but it was a full length movie!! The movie we saw was called The Great Locomotive Chase and was about the Civil War and based on real events that happened during that time. The movie was 88 minutes long!\n\nI think one good long visit here is enough, if you are a Disney fan. My mom is not a big Disney person, so she was done with the museum long before I was, only a few things caught her interest. I am a Disney fan and so I really took my time and enjoyed seeing everything. I don't think displays change often as it is mostly historical stuff and there is not really new stuff in the museum either. They do have special exhibits. Right now, it's the Pinocchio exhibit, but it's offered for an extra cost and we did not have the time to see that either. Entry is on the pricey side, but for one visit, it's not too terrible... Adults are $20 and juniors up to 17 years of age is $12. They have $3 off coupons. I had printed it from online and forgot to bring it. However, when I told them and showed them on my phone, there was no issue with me getting a discount. Special exhibits are an additional $10, if you combine it with regular entry. The films are $7, but included with the general ticket. Students get discounted tickets and military get free tickets, and also free if you have a membership.\n\nVisit this museum if you are a Disney fan. It is worth the visit! There is plenty of parking. If you have time, have lunch on the grounds as the views of the bay and Golden Gate is AMAZING!! There is a coffee shop/cafe inside the museum too.", "author": "Carol N."}

I'm an enormous Disney Lover. A mouskateer, if you will. I ubered up the windy SF streets to the gorgeous location in Presidio Park with stunning views of the Golden Gate Bridge to this suburban-ish street with a building that looked like a family home. I walked inside to the front desk and presented my student ID (they give discounts, $15 instead of $20) and paid for my entry. \n\nI didn't book ahead of time because after doing my research it didn't seem necessary. However, if you're traveling at a busy time of year, I would suggest it. You wouldn't want to miss out!\n\nThe entry room consists of a lot of mementos from Walt's childhood, as well as his extremely impressive case of Oscar trophies. My personal favorite being the time he won an Oscar for Snow White and they presented him with one regular trophy along with 7 mini ones :)\n\nThe museum basically walks you through his life in chronological order. You start with learning about Walt's father's life, and then Walt's childhood, followed by his series of successes and failures before he became the man we know and love today. The museum is very modern and media heavy. Lots of screens showing you different videos and the animation process. There is also a hands-on aspect in some of the rooms where you can interact with various things. The coolest rooms in my opinion are at the end. There is a giant active replica of the Disneyland park that Walt knew. There are also some animations you can interact with such as the tiki room bird.\n\nBring tissues, If you are as big of a Walt fan as I am, the last room will tug at your heart strings. It's full of artwork that was published when his death rocked the globe, and personal commentaries from close friends on how they felt when they heard the sad news.\n\nIf you are a Disney fan, this is a must see!", "author": "Kayla M."}

I didn't really read up on the museum so I expected more Disney film exhibits versus Walt Disney's life. As people have said, it may not be the best museum for children...  I could see them easily getting bored. I liked seeing all the original drawings and other artwork from his films. The actual history behind his life and other things were kind of a bore and had lots of reading. That's just me though. :\\\n\nThe museum was surprisingly huge! I kept asking myself when it was going to end! It was enjoyable though to have a surprise after each room. Favorite part was definitely the miniature Disneyland!\n\nAfter fiiinaaally getting through the museum, we headed over to the Dali exhibit in the back building. I wasn't that impressed with this exhibit. I just enjoyed the Dali paintings, really.\n\nTickets are $20 for adults for the actual museum itself. A little pricey if you ask me. Thankfully, I have a museum badge and get in freeeee + a friend. The Dali exhibit was extra for $10/adult. Also a bit much for what we saw in there. $20 for the actual museum makes more sense if you compared it to the special exhibit.\n\nThis is probably gonna be a good, one time visit.

The exhibit featured a great deal of original sketches and short films created by the man himself. I thoroughly enjoyed the Disneyland room which featured original plans and models of Disneyland.  The amount of thought and detail Disney put into creating Disneyland is unfathomable. \n\nThe museum really brought out Walt's determination and his imagination extremely well. They didn't dive to deep into dirty bigotry details though, that would have been an interesting plot twist.  \n\nAlso checked out the Sal Dali exhibit. I'm a fan of Dali's work but not necessarily a fan of the exhibit. Unlike the Disney museum which featured audible factoids at each station, I had to download an app for an audio tour which was supposed to cue up factoids as I walked thru the exhibit which sounded cool in theory, but didn't actually work. This exhibit was also significantly smaller than the disney museum and wasn't laid out as well. \n\nI felt they should have done a better job tying the two artist's exhibits together as well. They were well acquainted at a point in their lives, and I thought that was going to be the focal point/ or binding point of the exhibits but they only talked about the connection in one small area of the Dali exhibit. They should have drawn some parallel between both artists grand imagination and dream worlds they create or something but, nah. They did showcase several letters and sketches the two shared with one another which was very cool to see. \n\nBest part of the museum, though, is when you turn one of the corners in the Walt Disney exhibit, you get an immaculate view of the Golden Gate bridge. \n\nI'd love to go back and see what else the museum has to offer.", "author": "Kenny S."}

Then I was told that it is recommended to start with the Disney/Dali exhibit (going on thru January 2016) and then go through the museum.\n\nThe exhibit was in another building. You follow stickers on the cement to a building behind and someone checks your ticket, directs you where to start. This Disney/Dali exhibit had a free audio option. You can download an app and press on the corresponding \"stories\" of whatever you're looking at, narrated by Sigourney Weaver. She pretty much says what you can read in front of you. It was ok.

It seems a whole breed apart from the standard SF museums, like Cal Academy and the SFMOMA. \n\nI'm actually rather fond of the whole Disney vibe. It's just not that trendy or pretentious. It doesn't have the pseudo-intellectual geek chic vibe of the Exploratorium or the scientist pretentions of Cal Academy. I don't think this museum is trying to be much. Like the film showed, it's just a place for the uber-wealthy Disney clan to house all their paraphernalia. \n\nYou'll learn a lot about pop culture as you go through in this museum. Disney is, like, synonymous with pop culture over the decades. One of the most interesting parts of the museum was about the union strike that went on in Walt Disney's day. You think of Disney as so apolitical - like beyond politics. It's like they've always been trying to create a fantasy instead. That works for me. \n\nThis museum doesn't have any newer stuff, like Frozen and all the rest. It seems to only have retro Disney films. Are the newer stuff off-limits because of some copyrights or Pixar collaboration or something?\n\nThe gift shop has some interesting stuff, like postcards of stills(?) from Snow White or Cinderella. The whole museum feels very conservative, classic, and old money. \n\nStaff could be little more polite and courteous. They were cold and indifferent to me. \n\nOverall, the museum feels a bit sterile. Maybe it just doesn't get enough visitors for a more lived-in feel. Maybe it's just too far off the beaten path, deep in the Presidio. It's worth a visit, maybe, but it's not like you're going to have the time of your life.", "author": "Alecia K."}

However, I would advise against bringing young children as there really isn't much for them and they're likely to get bored and want to leave quickly. I went with my fiance (who is an animator), his mom, and his niece and nephew (who are 7 & 9), and the kids wanted out after awhile. There's so many words everywhere - LOTS OF READING - and not much that's interactive. If you're hoping to bring children, totally do it, but know your group. If they're too young to read/not interested in reading, this probably isn't the place for them. The Walt Disney FAMILY Museum is more ABOUT the Disney family than an actual place to bring the family.", "author": "Nicole F."}

Due to inclement weather, our plans for biking were nixed and we decided to visit this museum instead.\n\nThe admission ticket costs $15 with student ID and $20 for a regular adult. The museum itself goes through Walt Disney's personal and professional life in chronological order. From humble beginnings and difficulties Walt encountered (financial obstacles, strikes, wars, politics), to well-known successes (theme park, box office success like Snow White) and end-of-life and posthumous events, The Walt Disney Family Museum was thorough, detailed, informative, and interesting.

During that time, I learned quite a bit about Walt and the parks. Three years later, I finally found time to visit the museum, and I'm happy I did. \n\nI visited on a Wednesday, so there weren't many visitors. There were a few school tour groups that made it hard to focus on some of the exhibits since their guide was discussing details on a walking tour pretty loud. They always moved on quickly however. \n\nThere were many details about Walt's childhood and early years in animation that I never knew. The museum has lots of cool photos that you should look at closely and read all the captions. The final exhibit nearly made me cry seeing the true impact Walt's life had on the world. \n\nI think we probably stayed for about two hours.

Don't forget to bring those AAA membership and student ID cards to save a little.  Also, I wouldn't recommend this museum for small children as there isn't a lot for them to do as far as interactive stuff goes.\n\nAnyway, this museum is really laid out nicely.  The lobby has on display many of Walt's accolades, including the Oscar and little Oscars for \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\"  (I'm sure you've seen the picture of him and Shirley Temple.)  From the lobby, you'll be transported to the beginnings in Marceline, Missouri and conclude with his passing in 1966.\n\nNot gonna lie, I did get a little emotional at the end and felt a great urge to visit Disneyland afterwards. \n\nMy only complaint is that I hope that they work on the gift shop and the cafe.

I loved looking at all the early concepts of Walt Disney and how it shows how many of Disney's famous characters and movies came to be.  My favorite was most definitely the full scale model of Disneyland.  I was told by one of the curators that if you have sharp eye you can see Walt Disney himself in two locations.  She pointed them out to me and he's really tough to spot.  Just something to look out for when you come by to visit.  My friend and I stuck around and got to see an in-depth presentation on the Disneyland Model.  But my least favorite part was the memoriam exhibit.  It didn't suck but it was very depressing.  It must've been a really dark day when Mr. Disney passed away and seeing drawings of Mickey in tears was really sad.\n\nIt's a great place to check out if whether or not you're a Disney fan.

This museum is in the top 10 recommended places to visit. \n\nThey're open 10am-6pm daily, except for major holidays (they were open on Easter though -- which is the day we went in). Admission is about $20 per person, but well worth the money. I'd plan at least two hours to enjoy the whole museum (wear comfy shoes too!).

More than I would have ever known if I hadn't visited this place. My boyfriend enjoyed it too, and he isn't as big of a Disney fan as I am. I learned about Walt Disney's childhood, his struggles growing up, and even how a few people rejected his ideas saying they would \"never work\". Seeing how his cartoons came to life, as well as his movies, was amazing. Learning more in depth about the building of Disneyland (and how everyone thought he was crazy for building an amusement park as well). I learned more about the park in the 20 minutes I read about it here than I ever did in my four years of being an annual pass holder.

When seeing clips from many of Walt Disney's creations, it brought back many memories of what I remember watching from years ago. Fantasia was no doubt one of the most interesting masterpieces put together. You'll also learn about how Walt Disney put together his company and how he was able to make his dream come true. Highlights of great accomplishments and the challenges he faced along the way are also highlighted.

My admission also got me entrance to their current special exhibit on Tyrus Wong. Admission is normally $20, but if you have a student ID you can get a $5 discount. Tickets can be purchased either online or at the entrance to their main gallery, in Building 104 of the Presidio. This houses the gallery, museum store, theater, cafe, and some museum offices. But the special exhibit is in Building 122 (just a minute's walk away), which houses any special exhibitions as well as the rest of the museum offices.\n\nSo I started off my visit with learning about Tyrus Wong and seeing his amazing artwork. That man is so talented! I loved his style of art (he's the artist behind Bambi) and his story is quite inspiring. After he retired from painting he took up the art of kite-making and has since been inducted into the World Kite Museum and Hall of Fame for his amazing creations (including hundred-foot-long centipedes!). Apparently he still flies kites once a month on the beach near Santa Monica Pier so I definitely want to check them out in person someday :)\n\nAfter finishing that exhibit, I headed back to the main gallery to learn more about Walt Disney. He was such an incredible person! I loved learning more about his life and his career. He was so blessed with his mind and creativity, not to mention his family (especially his brother Roy) and their friends. He got screwed over many times in his career but he always managed to get back up and rise even higher. I wasn't able to watch any of the videos (my friend was waiting for me outside) but it was still so great just to read and see everything the museum had on display. The presentation of everything was very nice and I greatly enjoyed walking through the galleries.\n\nThen you finish at the gift shop! They said that their items are not sold anywhere else, including Disney Parks, because they're completely separate from them. So of course I carefully perused the gift shop and bought a few souvenirs for myself and friends.

It's giving the Snoopy Museum in Santa Rosa some stiff competition! \n\nThe permanent exhibit of the museum focuses on the life and times of Walt Disney - his beginnings to his career (both the ups and downs) to the birth of the most famous mouse in the world to the first full length animated film Snow White to Walt's death in 1966.  There is lots to see in this gallery - tons of great black and white photographs, clips of old cartoons including the Silly Symphony ones, and stories from his daughter Sharon, who cofounded the museum.  Being a huge fan of the world of Disney, it was so much fun to read about the early days of Mickey and Minnie, and how Pluto, Donald, and Goofy came to be.  There's also a really cool model of DisneyLand. There was so much to see - I would think you would need between 2-3 hours to really see and read everything that's in this part of the museum.  \n\nThe temporary exhibit when I visited was \"Magic, Color, Flair: The World of Mary Blair\" and it was amazing. Mary Blair was one of Walt's favorite artists and did the conceptual art for Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, and Cinderella, and did the designs for the It's a Small World ride at Disney Land.  Her artwork is both beautiful and adorable.  The temporary exhibit costs an extra $5 on top of regular admission, but the Mary Blair exhibit was well worth it! \n\nThe museum also has a small movie theatre where they screen a different film every month.  This month (the month of May) the film was Sleeping Beauty.  The screenings are at 130PM and at 4PM and you need a ticket from the front desk to get in to the theatre, but the tickets are complimentary when you pay for museum admission.  \n\nAnother really cute thing at this museum is the Oscar awards that Disney won for Snow White - there is one regular sized Oscar statue and seven mini Oscar statuettes representing each of the seven dwarfs.  This is in the museum lobby, where a bunch of awards are displayed.  \n\nIt's important to note that this isn't a comprehensive museum about all things Disney. It focuses on the Walt Disney's life and career and the work and films and projects he worked on himself, so you won't see stuff anything on the new age Disney stuff. \n\nThe museum is located all the way in the Presidio.

And I recommend doing so because there is no where to buy drinks inside. \n\nThere are SO many cool things to see inside. From original Mickey Mouse sketches to Walt Disney's miniature collection. My favorite was seeing a 1937 Cartier Snow White & the Seven Dwarves charm bracelet in the Snow White room. \n\nThis place will make you appreciate Disney so much more. 5 stars!", "author": "Christine L."}

It was a real treat to visit on our trip to San Francisco. \n\nIt's not only about Disneyland and Mickey Mouse, it's about the man himself, Walt Disney. The museum goes through the timeline of his life. It starts with his grandparents story and it moves on to his childhood and the rest is history.\n\nYou will find the coolest stuff here, animation cells, Walt's personal belongings, and whatnot. I like how the museum does not sugar coat things either. They tell us about Walt's struggles and how he overcame them. \n\nWe did the Pinocchio exhibit.

However, I rarely head to NorCal so once I planned my SF trip, the Walt Disney Family Museum was set on the first day.  \n\nFirst of all, if you are by the Embarcadero BART station, keep in mind that because of the construction, the pickup location for the free PresidiGo shuttle has moved to right by the grassy park by the Hyatt.\n\nSecondly, do try to go as early as possible! We missed the 1:30 pm shuttle because of the change in pickup location and had to wait until the 2:30 pm shuttle. Once we got to the museum, we had only 3ish hours to browse before they closed at 6 pm. It honestly wasn't enough time since there was the special exhibit for Tyrus Wong on display which we viewed first and then we had to speed through the main museum exhibits. Luckily, we've gone to the special Walt Disney exhibit at the Reagan Library, so some things we were okay in speeding along, but there is so much to read and learn about Walt's background, his early work and his masterpiece with Mickey and Disneyland that you would want the time to enjoy at your leisure.\n\nThe Tyrus Wong exhibit was pretty cool. I was not familiar with his work or involvement with the Bambi film, so the exhibit did a great job showcasing his work, especially what he does now in his 102 years of age -- kite making and flying the kites in Santa Monica. The items that I particular liked were the toys he made for his daughters -- wonderfully and creatively designed toys made out of common household objects (like a tissue box, pringles can, those Easter Seal stickers), what a great use of resources!\n\nThe view outside the museum is also pretty fantastic. You get a very nice view of the Golden Gate Bridge when it's not too cloudy a day.\n\nThe ticket price is very well worth what you see and the museum does have parking available--albeit a $1 per hour charge!", "author": "Grace C."}

The Walt Disney Family Museum is the most enjoyable museum experience that I have ever been to.  \n\nA couple notes before I proceed further, for those looking for a Disneyland-like experience this isn't for you.  For those looking for a completely \"unbiased\" account of the history of the Disney Brothers (Walt & Roy), do know that this museum was founded by the Disney family and is owned and operated by the non-profit Walt Disney Family Foundation.\n\nNow aside, the Walt Disney Family Museum offers an incredibly modern, interactive and audio/video driven presentation of the Disney family, in particular Walt and Roy's youth, upbringing, rise and formation of all things Disney and it's legacy.  There are different rooms and area along the way, each one focusing on a period or important section of Walt and Roy's lives.  Each room always has text timelines along with spoken or video (in form of animated shorts, archival video or documentary footage) explaining the importance or significance moments of time.  There are also important artifacts of for each point, from early Walt sketches to (my personal favorite) a 20 foot, or so, wide model of Disneyland.\n\nThe experience of the museum really is a feast for the sense.  You can casually peruse parts or spend hours in a single room.  The museum does a good job of steering you linearly through time and you honestly feel like you are on a ride and making a connection with Walt and everything he created to the point that when you get to the section where he passes away (Sorry...spoiler alert) it really does hit you.  There were a few people in tears at this part and I myself was a little choked up.\n\nAlso on the premises are a Cafe (not great) a fine little gift shop with plenty of great things, along with exclusive Disney collectable items that which can't be purchased anywhere else.  I, personally walked away with a great mug http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Kkrxk2Uz7UGyvuVIDtfXDw/l.jpg and a DVD documentary on Walt Disney.  There is also a downstairs area with a screening room and animation room where they do special events and screenings.\n\nOverall, I had a great experience.  I did, honestly, feel that there were a few points in Walt's life (particularly the McCarthy Witch Hunt stuff and the sometimes tense relationship Walt had with his brother Roy) that was a little glossed over and possibly a bit white washed.  But overall I walked away with a great insight and appreciation of the men who build the Disney empire.", "author": "Rob P."}

The Dali/Disney exhibit is fascinating and inspiring. Not only does it explain why each was a pioneer and how, but it also tells the story of their collaboration and friendship. The most fascinating part for me was to watch how their work changed during WWII and how the war even affected Disney's business. Audio guide is free for Dali and you can even use the provided headphones with your own iphone. Even if you don't buy a ticket to that exhibit, I recommend going to that back building where it's housed to see the gorgeous view of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe Walt Disney area is charming with plenty of video and a few hands-on experiences. There's a significant focus on his family history, his early days of animation, and the blossoming of Disney productions. \n\nMuseum admission includes a screening in the theater downstairs. I saw Ichabod and Mr. Toad, Kids are welcome there. \n\nThe cafe has sandwiches, soups, desserts. My main recommendation is to choose something hot! During busy times, the sandwiches are pre-made and left out without refrigeration. But also the hot stuff is just tastier. You can eat at one of the handful of tables inside or handful of tables out on the deck with a beautiful view. Of course there's also plenty of grass to sit on and eat.\n\nParking was easy. Granted we were there on a weekday, but we found parking right on the street in front of the museum(don't forget to pay and put the receipt on your dashboard!) and just across a swath of grass in a huge outdoor parking lot. Even the view from the parking lot is gorgeous. If you can't find handicapped parking in front of the museum, do a drop off in front and park in the lot.\n\nAs far as bringing kids, I'm glad I went with adults only to the Dali exhibit and that one is not great for young kids. The other part of the museum is more appropriate for young kids than the Dali exhibit but I wouldn't consider it a destination for young kids. I think ages 8+ would enjoy it significantly more.", "author": "Marina N."}

We thought it would be a quick one hour visit.  We could have easily spent another hour or two .We ended up rushing through the museum since we wanted to have lunch in SF before and hopefully avoiding rush hour traffic.\n\nThe museum is housed in one of the buildings at the Presidio.  The setting is beautiful. I like how they kept the outside intact.  The inside is well laid out---lots of good signage, bathrooms on every floor, exhibits in a logical order with lots of hands on exhibits and videos with listening devices.  The lightning both natural and artificial was great.  So many museums are darker than they need be.  \n\n\nWe visited the Walt Disney Family Museum this past week using the Group-on coupons. Mr Rinky was very reluctant to go since he's never been pleased with Walt's political leanings.  \n\nEven though I grew up in SoCal and went to Disneyland at least twice a year as a kid and teen I can't help remembering my mother's memory of our first visit to Disneyland .  Apparently Walt saw our Japanese-Amerocan family and gave us some major dirty looks.  Through the years there were some probably questionable policies regarding hair length, dress codes, sexual orientation and other policies that prevented people from entering the hallowed grounds.\n\nThere was an exhibit focusing on labor issues but we didn't examine it too closely.\nMy husband noticed that there was an exhibit of Disney giving testimony in an early HUAC (House on UnAmerican Activities Committee) meeting. Disney along with Ronald Reagan fueled the frenzy by implying that the labor issues were caused by Communist infiltration.  Several Disney employees were named and blacklisted.\n\nI mentioned the above because Disney, like all of us, had good and bad qualities.\n\nThe staff at this museum was very sweet and welcoming and helpful.\n\nWe were given a map and directions.  We were asked if we wanted to see the movie of the day (free with admission) which happened to be one of my favorites, \"Lady and the Tramp.\"\n\nThe first floor consists of cases featuring all the awards Disney had received over the years.An extensive and impressive collection.  I especially liked the Emmy with the seven mini Oscars for \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.\"\n\nThe exhibits start with Disney's childhood.  Impressive films of his parents and early movies with special effects.  I forgot how Disney was talented in his own right.\n\nI enjoyed the exhibits showing the early animated folks.  I especially liked an exhibit where you supplied the sound effects to a animated film (i.e.. turning a crank,\na \"meow\" machine)\n\nWe only scratched the surface--there are many exhibits here that we were only able to walk by.\n\nThe auditorium where they showed \"Lady and the Tramp\" was roomy but on the smallish side which actually added to the intimacy.\n\nThere is a small cafe which offers basic coffee, cold drinks and snacks.\n\nThe gift shop is small and I liked the fact that it wasn't just an offshoot of the Disney\nStore with tons of clothing and toys. There were some books, DVDs, charms,\nand other items.\n\nSo even though I have mixed feelings about Disney I thought the museum was\na great use of space, had well thought out exhibits and general layout.\nI'm not sure if kids under 7 would like it although there seem to be hands-on exhibits it definitely is nor a \"kid\" museum.", "author": "Rinky N."}

I'll review both. \n\nDali/Disney exhibition:\nFirst off, it's an additional $10 to the regular museum admission. \nI love how they did a side by side timeline for both artists starting from when they were born. And it really builds up to the moment where they become friends and coworkers. I won't spoil anything, so I'll just say that I learned a lot. I also recommend using their headsets. It has more information than what's on the board. It also adds narration to the videos throughout the exhibit. \n\nWalt Disney Family Museum:\nThey did such a great job depicting his life. And there were so many memorabilia to admire. Walt was a very meticulous and somewhat picky man, so they even had his favorite brand of food and toiletries. Then of course, they have all the things related to his life as an animator from the comics he used to draw to all of his featured films. They also have an impressive collection of all things Disneyland related. \n\nOverall, this was any Disney fan's heaven. It is overwhelming. They have an elevator at the halfway point so you can take a bathroom break and mental break. But I'd go through the museum slowly to truly appreciate everything he built.\n\nPs. They allow photos now! \n\nPss. If you're staying in downtown, take the Presidigo bus. It's free on the weekends and takes you pretty much to the front of the museum.", "author": "Lynn T."}

It is also tucked in a national park that shows awesome vistas of the Golden Gate. \n\nThe building is small, but brimming with trophy, and artifacts from Walt's life. It was a little expensive to go in, but my mother would have paid three times the cost of admission.

Walt through the years with the biography and self spoken quotes was my favorite part.

There are exhibits where you can listen to Walt, Roy, Lillian ect, tell stories, you can read original handwritten letters, view original drawings and even the Oscar Award is in the lobby for Snow White- check it out! One of the last exhibits is the original model of Disneyland *GRINS IN EXCITEMENT*. I couldn't take it, I could have stood at that model all day long!

The place is huge (so also wear comfortable shoes!). We arrived at 3:00 on the dot, knowing full well that the place closed at 6, thinking that three hours would have been enough time. Yeah, no. Budget at least four hours!  Our three hour stay included visiting the Diana Disney Miller gallery, which, I suppose, could be skipped if you really dislike whatever happens to be in there.\n\nThe museum is well laid out, and includes a lot of fun video and audio clips from Walt himself, which really helps bring the museum to life.  The museum is really about Walt, and the beginning of the museum covers his childhood and then works its way through to the creation of the studio to Disneyland, the World's Fair and his death.  There are a lot of neat artifacts about the various animated works, but the biggest disappointment is that a lot of pieces are copies of original documents, not the real deal.  Good copies, but it was disappointing to read facsimile over and over and over again.\n\nHighlights include the train that once ran around the family home, a multiplane camera, and a large Disneyland diorama.\n\nAll of the staff that I interacted with or overheard interactions were very nice and friendly.\n\nThe only real downside to the museum is that I personally would not recommend it for children under the age of 9, maybe even 12.  There is a lot of reading involved, and subject matter that many kids may not be interested in, such as the strike Disney faced, and the studio's involvement with the war.

Just a heads up! Anyway, I've been wanting to come to the Walt Disney Family Museum for some time now after many visits to the bay area. But being close to three hours away, it took some planning and coordination to take the trip out there. Let me tell you though, this museum alone is worth the drive. The museum is located at the Presidio of San Francisco, just adjacent to the Golden Gate (you'll get a great view from one the exhibit rooms just FYI), on beautifully kept grounds. You can either make the choice to park in front by a meter and pay by the hour or to the rear of the building which will cost you about $7 bucks for the entire day (not bad for San Francisco if you ask me). We even went as far as walking down to Crissy Field for lunch leaving the car in the Disney lot. Anyway, the museum is incredible, even with the $20 ticket price, though I got in for free as they offer free military admission year round. The exhibits themselves offer a detailed look into Walt's life and that of his brother Roy's as well. Starting chronologically with his birth and boyhood, the exhibits progress from Walt's childhood influence on animation and art through to his very last projects of the mid sixties. They touch basis with everything from his service in France during the war, to his first feature animation (Snow White), Fantasia, his parks, the studio strike, and so much more. You can easily spend all day here, as I spent 4 hours speed reading and photographing through the museum. I will definitely be back for more. \n\nWhat were the great points of this museum?\nThe exhibits are colorful, and full of things to look at, not only to read.\nThose include the first EVER known illustrations of Mickey Mouse with Ube Iwerks and Walt, a TON of vintage Mickey and Friends merchandise, the large Disneyland Park model (this seems to be the focal point for most people that visit), Walt's personal collection of various items from things he carried every day to items from his office at the studio, his scale model trains that he took people for rides in and built himself, and SO much more. If you love Disney, this is a must do.\n\nMy only gripes are that the gift shop is very limited in merchandise, the cafe being very small, and the exhibits are a little hard to follow or know how to chronologically maneuver through without the help of an audio guide.\n\nOtherwise, this is one of the top museums on my list.", "author": "Brandon T."}

Emphasis was made on his contributions to the first World War by driving an ambulance in France (and the things he had to do I order to be allowed to go).\n\nAfter taking the elevator to the second floor that's when things get more interesting. You learn about Walt's initial entry into show business. I learned about the character Alice and his first animated series \"Silly Symphony\" (correct name?), both prior to the creation of Mickey Mouse.\n\nIt was after reaching the point that talks about Mickey that the fun started. There were many video display showing features and such. I enjoyed learning about the origins of his fellow characters Goofy, Pluto, and especially Donald Duck (which was described as Mickey's foil because Mickey can never get mad).\n\nAfter that there were galleries describing full-length features starting with Snow White, and much discussion about each dwarf (very informative). Later there was displays discussing Fantasia, and one detail I was surprised to discover was it was considered a financial failure despite its long run on the big screen.\n\nLater a big highlight is the gallery discussing the creation of Disneyland, including a sizable model of the amusement.\n\nConcluding the gallery are display of magazine covers and other discussion from when Walt Disney passed away. I wish I took a photo of the French magazine photo showing a very tearful Mickey Mouse.\n\nI spent just over two hours in the gallery because I was with a friend and her young nephew and niece, but I felt I could definitely stayed much longer especially if I was to slowly read all the displays and watch all the videos shown.\n\nRegular admission price is $20 but I bought Groupon deals earlier in the year for $10.

It's nothing of the sort. However, if you're fascinated with how a man created an empire with a mouse (and are willing to read... A LOT... to find out) this is an absolute destination.\n\nIt's a bit overwhelming at first, I will definitely attest to that. Your first room has movies playing, pictures of people you've never heard of before and the walls are covered in text about an upbringing of a guy named Walt that you get an immediate sense, you don't know at all. You peruse through this lobby and make your way to the next door where the second room is just as overwhelming as the first. At this point, you look back at the entrance, but you've come too far and then suddenly let yourself become immersed in the greatness of Disney.\n\nThroughout your self-guided tour, you'll come across amazing pieces of history, from Walt's early career as a newspaper comic artist, to the first ever sketches of Mickey Mouse, into the making of the first full-length Disney movie, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, and into the creation of Disneyland, Disney World and Walt's final moments. I must confess, we had to breeze past the last few rooms due to the fact that the museum was closing, but it was truly a great opportunity to delve further into the mind of one of time's most creative visionaries. I will definitely be visiting again with a few extra hours of time on my hands (I'd plan for around two and a half to three hours if you're really into this kinda stuff).\n\nIf you're a Disney fan, and have ever asked yourself how any of it was possible, do yourself a favor and head over to the Walt Disney Family Museum.

My cousin and I hopped on the MUNI to the Presidio.  The Google Maps bus transit feature is better than any MUNI app you'll find out there.  It calculates your route, tells you what bus to hop on, and even tells you the amount of the fare.  Cool, right?!  So for $2, Vanessa D. and I headed towards the Presidio.  We also walked down Lovers' Lane.  It's weird to do that with your cousin, but I digress.  Google maps says the walk from the bus stop is 1.2 miles.  WTH?  Sigh, a nature walk.  The walk wasn't so bad.  Although, I did get a few, \"Are we there yets?\" from the cousin.  Out of the forest, we stumble onto military baracks in brick.  It reminds me of Portland, well sort of.  \n\nWe purchased tickets through Goldstar for $10 plus a $4 handling fee.  Normal admission for adults is $20.  The museum was unexpectedly educational.  Things you didn't know about the Walt Disney family and Walt's personal life are exhibited in galleries.  Like how he and his wife tried for a large family but only had one daughter.  They adopted another girl, Sharon, shortly after Diane turned 2.  There's a huge mini replica of Disneyland in the main room.  There are photos everywhere and animated posters.  There are collections of Disney memorabilia of days gone by.  There are personal artifacts like Lilian Disney's 'Snow White' charm bracelet made by Cartier and gifted to her by Walt.  There's also Walt's 'Dopey' money clip on display.

So being a SoCal girl and growing up going to dland nonstop, this place was just made for me! Its so awesome to see the history of Walt Disney himself and how he created the fantasy of Disneyland. My favorite part was the model of disneyland. Like there was an actual model of how Walt disney pictured dland to look like. And it really looked just like disneyland back home. So I thought that was the best part because I felt like I was at home. I also loved the quotes at the end of the museum. Like, this one man with such an extraordinary imagination can create something so big and wonderful to every child and adult till this day.

One quote that I have always love and being at this Disney Family Museum made me really remember it. \n\n\"All our dreams can come true, if we have the courage to pursue them.\" - Walt Disney", "author": "Evelyn C."}

Hidden away in the Presidio, this museum was much bigger than I expected. I thought we'd be there an hour but we were there all afternoon!\n\nIt really goes through Walt Disney's entire life in pretty good detail. There are several rooms and it's organized well - everything is chronological and there are a ton of examples and artifacts and lots of information to read. Be sure to pick up the telephone receivers when they are there because many of them include audio of Walt speaking about what you're looking at.\n\nIt's much more focused on the animation and movie side rather than the theme parks but they do have a model of Disneyland that's pretty fun to look at.\n\nOverall I'd say adults will enjoy this more than kids.", "author": "Holly R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-31", "description": "My husband and I went to the Disney Family Museum to see the Disney and Dali: Architects of the Imagination exhibit (open from July 10, 2015 - January 3, 2016). I must say, it far exceeded our expectations. This exhibit would be most enjoyed by adults and older children who have a strong interest in art, art history, and surrealism.\n\nThis well-curated special exhibit is housed in a building behind the main museum and is priced separately from the main museum (and you don't have to pay for the main museum if you only want to see this exhibit). The admission price includes the use of an audio device and headphones. Alternatively, you can download the app onto your smart phone. You don't necessarily need it as most of the spoken audio is also displayed as text in each numbered area. But is nice to have, and is eloquently narrated by Sigourney Weaver. Allow yourself plenty of time as there are (if I remember correctly) 33 different stops in the exhibit.\n\nThe exhibit includes original correspondence between Disney and Dali, a number of short videos, artwork, and drawings. Some Dali paintings are originals and some are replicas. I enjoyed seeing some early work by Walt Disney himself, and there is a lot of artwork by his various studio artists. The exhibit draws parallels between the early careers of Disney and Dali (just three years age difference), both of whom were ahead of their time and dreamers in their own way. Surrealist images by Dali are shown side-by-side with concept art by Disney Studio artists who had been encouraged to push the boundaries of their own creativity; it's quite surprising how much overlap there is between their vision. The videos include clips of various Disney animations, and the dream sequence in Hitchcock's Spellbound that Dali had designed.\n\nThe exhibit presents the history behind the collaboration between Dali and Disney Studios for the short film Destino. Unfortunately production was cut short by financial troubles for the studio around the time of World War II. Some of the actual paintings and sketches developed for the film are shown in this exhibit. Destino was picked up and completed many years later by Walt's nephew Roy. All that was missing from this exhibit was the short film itself. Too bad, it would have been a culmination to an interesting and insightful exhibit. Nonetheless, many kudos to Ted Nicolaou, the guest curator of the exhibit!", "author": "Tracy W."}

Instead, the Disney family foundation renovated and expanded three barracks buildings in the Presidio into quite an impressive series of galleries that follow Disney's life, legacy and death. In fact, the journey through the museum reminds me a bit of a ride my mom would like in Disneyland like the People Mover which is coincidentally showcased in a vintage poster. \n\nIt's an oddly although not unexpectedly claustrophobic place. You start in the lobby where you're surrounded by all the accolades Disney won through his extensive career, including the famous special Oscar he received for \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\" which included a coterie of miniature Oscars representing each dwarf. The first room you enter after your ticket is scanned spotlights his childhood and early adulthood. Then you go up a period-looking elevator where you start to see how he and his brother Roy partnered to create Mickey Mouse. There is a great wall showing 348 enlargements of a single minute of Mickey's debut cartoon, \"Steamboat Willie\". \n\nThings move quickly from there and go through the production of his classic full-length animated films, nature documentaries, WWII propaganda features, and then how he branches out to television and theme parks. Along the way, you get an unexpected view of the Golden Gate Bridge behind the barracks. His death is given an appropriate tribute as well as a multimedia room where you get a final recap of his multi-storied life. Speaking of which, none of the more controversial elements are covered here, so don't expect a personal expose. On the other side, the kiddies may get bored during certain, text-heavy stretches of the museum.\n\nThe gift shop, of course, is chock full of Disney memorabilia but nothing of the magnitude you'd see in the theme parks. Yet, for its thoughtful, thorough approach and for all the attractive design touches, the museum still left me a bit wanting. I made the inevitable comparison with the Charles M. Schulz Museum up in Santa Rosa and just feel Walt deserves something even bigger, more spacious and certainly more interactive than the Presidio barracks could afford. Admission is a bit steep at $20, but the museum is a most worthwhile visit regardless, especially for baby boomers and Disneyphiles.", "author": "Ed U."}

It's not called \"Disneyland 2\" or \"Mini-Disneyland.\"  You HONESTLY expected the WALT DISNEY FAMILY MUSEUM to be some flashy, ride-filled fun parade?  That's like going to a really good Italian restaurant and giving it one star because they don't have Doritos Locos Tacos.  I think you're a little off there....Oh, and P.S., check your grammar!!  \n\nOK, rant over....\n\nThis museum is nothing short of impressive.  The size is huge, you could easily spend all day there.  There are passages and quotes to read, actual home movies of the Disney family, photographs dating as far back as Walt's grandparents, audio of Walt and his family telling stories, video displays, actual equipment used by the Disney studios, the list goes on and on.  I love all things Disney: the parks, the movies, the characters, but most of all: the nostalgia.  I visited the museum with one person who shares my love for Disney, and one person who loves history and is just OK with Disney.  When we left, the latter was the one going on and on about how great it was.  \n\nI'd always had a great respect for who Walt Disney was, but this museum lets you really experience him as a man: both personally and professionally.  I left with a deeper admiration of him.  What stood out most to me was his drive and work ethic: he never gave up, even in the face of terrible adversity and back-stabbing people.  The other thing I enjoyed was seeing how much he loved and adored his family.  The display of him spending time with his grandson at Disneyland was beautiful.\n\nHistorical events shaped the way the Disney came to be, and they do a great job incorporating history into events in Walt's life.  You get to see how the events in the world and in his family influenced the decisions and breakthroughs he made.  It was both educational and inspiring.\n\nThe museum is visually and architecturally beautiful, 17 rooms all connected by hallways or creative use of elevators.  I loved the displays of artifacts.  The ones I was most excited to see where the first known drawing of Mickey Mouse (and all the earliest merchandise), and the actual train Walt had built in his backyard that would later be the model for the Disneyland Railroad.  \n\nDon't bring young kids unless they like reading and history.

The first display details the very young life of Walt Disney and is presented via three v-e-r-y clever works of (flash?) animation. \n\nFrom there, you continue following Disney's life story through various interactive presentations and artifacts.\n\nWith each new room you enter, there are details and nuances about every project Walt Disney embarked on ... including missteps and failures. You will discover facts you may have never known about previously such as the Disney company involvement with WW2 and Walt Disney's tenure as an American \"ambassador\" to South America.\n\nThe tour can take an entire afternoon if you allow yourself the luxury of every exhibit. If you have the time to spare, there is even an additional screening room you can visit (showing the classic Mary Poppins when I was there as the new \"Saving Mr. Banks\" film was due to hit theaters soon.) The museum ends a bit abruptly, the same way Disney himself died. The history here stops at year of Disney's death ... but we all know the legacy lived on.\n\nThere is a gift shop and a separate gallery for ancillary exhibitions. That gallery is usually a separate admission price and though the show being presented at the time sounded interesting, you can keep quite busy with the main museum.\n\nAlso on premises you will find the museum's cafe serving respectable (if pricey) sandwiches and drinks. We decided to have lunch there and found the soups and sandwiches to be ahead of the curve culinarilly speaking. They could use a bit more seating near the caf\u00e9 proper, though you can find more seating downstairs and thats not made apparent enough on the first floor. \n\nCaveats the first: there is a good amount of walking to the museum. It doesn't seem like it but there is a lot of walking so take the time to use some of benches provided in some exhibits to get off your feet.\n\nCaveat the second: leave any child under 12 years old with a baby sitter. Yes, this is all about \"cartoons\", but it really is about animation as an art form and the untethered children running around indicate this place is not for the GameBoy generation.\n\nIf you are a fan of the Disney animation from the past, or even pop culture or Americana, then you owe it to yourself to visit this tribute museum originally conceived by Walt Disney's daughter.\n\nSince you will be on the grounds of San Francisco's 'Presidio' area, plan to visit the Yoda statue at the entrance of the new-ish Lucasfilm complex.

It is incredibly beautiful, and words can't describe it well enough.\n\nThe secondary exhibits are in a whole different building, which makes them feel special, and they are top notch as well. So far, I've seen the Maurice Sendack one, the Salvador Dali one, and the Pinocchio one. All three were amazing, and had a lot of pieces that I was shocked that they were able to acquire.  The museum workers mill around, happy to answer any questions you may have.\n\nLastly, there is a theater in the basement of the main building. It isn't in operation at all times, but they do really fun shows when it is. They'r usually structured around a theme, like a compilation of vintage holiday shorts or something along those lines. It's small and intimate, and you can really feel the Disney magic.\n\nAll in all, this place is great. It isn't Disneyland (my favorite place in the whole world), but it's a GREAT fix for when you can't travel there. I love it!", "author": "Erica M."}

(Blair was an artist and animator who was involed in productions such as Alice In Wondeland, Peter Pan, and Cinderella, just to mention a few). The gallery was so well organized and the drawings and paintings left me wanting to see more and know more about this artist. I am not big on museums, more of a \"speed\" tour person, but between the tour guide, the art itself, and the information that was set with each piece, I truly felt engaged.   \n\nAfter touring Blar's exhibit in Building 104 we went back to the main building.  This tour started with vintage pictures of Disneys family and short flicks of where he and his family came from and how his career began.  This particularly is a lengthy, but informative self-guided tour and you will want to take your time. Fill the meter up for sure. I made the mistake of not doing it.

You'll leave with a ton of knowledge about Walt Disney the man, his family life, the history of the Disney brand and company, and an urge tore watch all of the classics from Snow White and the Seven Dwarves to Dumbo and Fantasia!\n\nDefinitely an adult museum though- displays, plaques, signage, and labels are everywhere and they're text heavy. There are also a lot of pictures and stuff to look at, but without doing the reading they aren't particularly meaningful.\n\nMy favorite parts were the multiplane camera and the side-by-side comparisons of The Ugly Ducking videos circa 1931 and 1939- so much progress in the field of animation and in the talent at Disney! The expansive area on Walt's vision, plan, and execution of the Disney Land theme park was also personally meaningful to me, as I visited the park for the first time exactly a year ago. \n\nGot my ticket at half price through Groupon- worth checking to see if the promo is still running, as the $20 regular entry fee is a bit steep.\n\nThe museum itself is large and they've done great things with the space- though it's an impressive building from the outside, the museum space itself seems even larger than the building it's in.  Street parking was available right in front for us, and they even said it was a busy day for them. \n\nMuseum gift shop is a little lacking- some like the lack of trademark Disney merchandise, but I found that the store was terribly overpriced and had a variety of kitschy stuff that didn't have anything to do with the museum we'd just experienced- think coffee mugs with a single bird feather drawn on them, circle globe earrings, generic handmade felt stuffed animal Christmas ornaments, etc.\nWould have loved to find more references to Minnie mouse within the museum or in the store.", "author": "Stefany V."}

If you want to hear an amazing story of a man who beat the Chinese Exclusion Act and went on to become one of the greatest artists at Disney (and first Asian American Disney artist), check this exhibit out. The landscapes, watercolors, and works he made for both Bambi and Warner Bros. (classic movies such as \"A Street Car Named Desire,\" etc.) are absolutely breathtaking. Amazing if you think about how this guy was so poor growing up he'd paint using water; his characters drying up before he could even finish them. There's also tons of stuff from his personal life -- crafts he made his children for Christmas, the fantastic kites he builds now, and even old Chinese watercolors and murals he made before starting out at Disney. \n\nThe main Disney museum is also a must here if you're a Disney fan. (Tyrus Wong runs until sometime in February and is in a separate building behind the main Disney museum). At the main building,  you learn all about the life of Walt Disney and all his works. There's even cool videos of original footage of the artists drawing, reference models at work, first original cartoons, and concepts behind Disneyland and more. Watching these clips and seeing all the original artwork and photos brought back a wave of nostalgia for me. It is truly so beautiful. A great place to take the family- young and old alike if they grew up with Disney! I think it's about $15 for the main museum entrance and $10 for the featured exhibit. Worth every penny in my opinion.\n\nI can see myself coming back to this place every time they feature a new exhibit! It's truly wonderful!", "author": "Evonne L."}

The museum is ideal for MEGA MEGA MEGA Disney fans and animation history buffs - everyone else might be a little disappointed. \n\nIt's easy to assume that a museum with Disney in its name will be a treat for all ages, but it ultimately isn't kid friendly.  Interactive exhibits are based more on education than entertainment, and the majority of the exhibits are text with photos.  It's like a great history book come to life.  \n\n2 major highlights: when you reach the section where Disneyland comes to being, you see an amazing model of the park, with both original and added attractions.  As a Disneyland buff, staring at this model was like taking a quick trip to the Happiest Place on Earth, and reliving many great memories!  Another highlight was around the halfway point you enter a long glass hallway with a magnificent view of the Golden Gate Bridge.  We lucked out and visited on a sunny day, it is truly spectacular.  \n\nSo be prepared to learn a lot - this museum, while great, is less amusement and more education. \n\n*I Yelp today in honor of Roger Ebert, the ultimate critic - RIP*", "author": "Terri N."}

I was honestly taken by complete surprise by the size of the museum, the quality of the exhibits, and the amount of time you could spend here. I definitely do not think the website accurately represents this place; I came here expecting to spend maybe an hour looking around, and we were here for maybe 3. We could have been there longer if we didn't have to be somewhere at a certain time, so we rushed through the last couple of rooms. \n\nThere is a lot of detailed information about his life (yes, a lot of reading), but the museum also has a large number of \"things\" to look at. Additionally, they do an extensive job of integrating media into the exhibits. Throughout the museum, there are screens showing different clips of movies / cartoons, there are interactive media devices, little phones that play recordings to you, and more. \n\nMy favorite part was the gigantic scale model of Disneyland that had a ton of detail and moving parts. I could have stared at that thing for 30 minutes straight. \n\nWhen I visited, they we doing a special exhibit on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs that had a large amount of information on how the cartoon was actually made, and it was extremely interesting - this level of detail on animation was not present in the permanent exhibits. It was definitely worth checking out. \n\nI wouldn't necessarily recommend taking younger kids that can't read to this museum as they probably wouldn't be able to spend as much time in each room as you would want to if you are trying to experience the entire exhibit. \n\nThere was a little snack / beverage place inside of the building where you could grab a drink and hang out for a bit at some tables.

Admission was $20 each or $25 for the combo tix that allows you both regular museum admission + access to the special exhibit which was Snow White right now.  Do note that the special exhibit is time entry so you need to arrive at the set time that you choose.  \n\nWe went for the combo pack and ended up spending so many hours here, I felt like my legs were about to fall off and wish there was a monorail to bring you around.  We started off with the Snow White movie which I realized during it that I've read it as a child but never actually seen the movie so it was nice seeing it play out and noticing the differences between the book and the film.  It was a nice segway into the special exhibit as I started to notice a lot more things that I otherwise wouldn't have.  The special exhibit took about an hour to go through and is in a separate building behind the main building.  \n\nThe main exhibit spans the life of Walt Disney from the early years all the way til the end with everything you can imagine in between from his struggles, his movies, and Disneyland all across 10 areas.  It truly is a magical experience especially for adults.  \n\nNote:  Although there were children there, it is geared more towards older children and adults who can really appreciate the life of Disney.  \n\nSo the next time you need a rainy day activity, head over to the Walt Disney Museum!!", "author": "Joyce Z."}

It took us about 3 hours to get through the museum (with the last hour being a speed reading through the displays) but can easily go 4 to 5 hours if you read and digest everything it has to offer.\n\nThe museum is well kept and beautifully arranged.  I learned so much not only about Walt Disney but the way the technology evolved to create what is now Disney (Pixar and Star Wars and all).  It seems like a chain of events that are serendipitous.  In any case, the geek in me loved the techy part of it.  I would've loved more interaction with the set somehow.  I would've loved to take pictures but due to copyright issues, we couldn't.  \n\nThe bridge in the middle of the exhibit overlooks the bay and it was a gorgeous day when I went.  \n\nI think it'd be worth going at least twice, to catch anything you might've missed.  My brain was spinning from reading all the displays and my eyes literally hurt.  Still, the information made you feel connected with Walt Disney and I teared up at the end when reading all the tributes after his death.\n\nThe gift shop is expensive but offers some nice gifts to take home with you.

Visiting this museum and learning about how Walt Disney animation came to be, was so mind blowing. I can hardly believe someone like him existed. He did so much before the age of 30 - what is my life?\n\nThis museum is tucked away deep in the Presidio, and its so random. It looks like a military barracks outside, as it once was. We stumbled upon it. Being a native to SF for 24 years, I had no idea this even existed. Maybe I don't get out much? It does look small and quaint from the outside, but this is a deception. We spent a full 3 hours inside, and that is with skipping a few displays and not reading every single exhibit.\n\nMy favorite part about this museum was learning about Walt's involvement in World War II, and how he helped the US create WWII propaganda through his short animation films. It makes you realize how truly monumental he was to American history and culture, other than the fact that he revolutionized animation forever. I'm also obsessed with WWII in general so that was icing on the cake for me. Der Fuhrer's Face was awesome. and hilarious.\n\nI do agree with the other reviewers when they say this place isn't for kids, but maybe your young kids will gain a few IQ points going through this museum?

The museum boasts one of the most advanced museum multi-media experiences in the world, and it is hard to argue. It highlights and details Walt's life and life's work, certainly trumpeting the Disney glory while not shying away from detracting aspects as well (e. g., a section of the museum documenting the 1937 Disney animators' strike, etc.).\n\nFor Disney fans, unique highlights include:\n* Trophy case of Disney awards including an Emmy and multiple Oscars... quite a thing for us mere mortals to stand within a couple of feet of an actual Oscar. You can also check out the Oscar for Snow White which includes seven little Oscar-ettes...\n* A chance to actually stand near and get a complete description of Disney's groundbreaking Multiplane Camera, designed and first used to revolutionize animation in the '30's even today it looks years ahead of its time.\n* Engine and cars from Disney's Carolwood Pacific Railroad, the 7.25\" gauge miniature train Walt famously ran in the backyard of his California home - which embodied his love for the trains so prominently on display in Disney parks\n* All kinds of history around Disney movies - not just the films themselves but how they were financed, the approach to color and sound, their successes and failures along with the Disney Studios over the years\n* A scale model of Disneyland ca 1967 - 1970\n* Documentation of early Disney efforts (i. e., Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, the Alice films, Silly Symphony films)\n* and so much more...\n\nAdditionally there is a theater which shows features and special films regularly, along a separate building with rotating exhibitions which in the past have included the works of the legendary Mary Blair, Secrets of Disney's Movie Magic, A Celebration of Walt's Trains, and others.\n\nThe Walt Disney Family Museum only exists in San Francisco and its contents are (as I understand it) property of the Disney family, not the parks, so you won't see what is in here in Anaheim, Orlando, Paris, Tokyo, etc. The only advice I will give on the visit is that even though this is 'Disney' it is a museum, not a 'ride,' and not really compelling for young or younger children - in my experience. If your young children want to go be prepared to keep them interested while you are touring the exhibitions, because you will want to stay for a long time.\n\nHighly recommended, a must see for anyone visiting The City and for residents alike.

We bought the admission to the main part of the museum as well. The special exhibit was housed in a separate building. The best way to describe the exhibit is as unpleasant. The problem was not as much the contents of the exhibit, but how it was displayed. Every wall was crowded with information organized in a linear timeline. Over the course of the exhibit you see Dali's and Disney's lives intersect. The exhibit was extremely crowded, and the path very narrow, so even if I had wanted to see all of the text that was written it was impossible. People pushed and shoved to get to the next thing, and a couple of times obliviously almost knocked my 88 year-old mother over without a word of apology. We hurried though as quickly as we could to go to the main museum.\n\nThe main museum exhibit was better, but similarly linear, driven by Disney's life and accomplishments. The curator relies too heavily on timeline, and does not do a good job of story telling, and tries to jam everything Disney left behind, including every award, every letter, and every drawing that he ever did, into a space that is not really big enough. In the end, I was left wondering what Walt would have thought. I loved many of the drawings, and learning about the evolution of animation, but my favorite parts were about the animators strike of 1941, and learning that Mr. Disney was a bad guy (anti-communist informant and anti-union) during the McCarthy era. These were the only true glimmers that I got of Disney, the man. I  actually felt sorry for all of the artists who spent their life at Disney and whose drawings were displayed, in most cases attributed to \"Disney studio artist,\" or in other cases to \"Unknown.\" Disney made so much money on the backs of underpaid artists, and basically took all of the credit for what they did. \n\nMy mother, who is a wonderful artist, grew up in LA. One of the best moments of attending this exhibit was when she told me about learning to draw Micky Mouse from the guy who lived across the street from her who was a Disney studio artist. She went on to author a cartoon strip of her own, and to become an incredible drawer. Thank you unknown Disney studio artist for getting my mother started. I hope that one of your drawings is displayed at the Disney Family Museum, and that I saw it today.\n\nIf you are a Disney fan, you may like this exhibit. There are wonderful things to discover through the clutter and the noise of it. If you are a parent of younger children, think twice about bringing them to this; they will be bored out of their skulls, or trampled to death.

My friend and I got a pretty good deal on Groupon though I wouldn't mind paying the regular ticket price ($20, though if you have a student I.D. you can get it for $15). \n\nLike many people have said this isn't the best place to take young kids. There is a LOT of reading and hardly any interactive things.We didn't go through it as meticulously as I would have wanted to since I was the only one who was really interested in reading all the long descriptions. But either way it was enjoyable for all of us. The place is set up nicely so you can make an organized walk through the whole museum. \n\n- You're allowed to take photos as long as you don't use flash. \n- They have bathrooms downstairs and two single bathrooms in the middle of the museum. \n- You can pay extra to view the special exhibits they might have that day. \n- There's a tiny cafe and gift shop at the entrance/exit. (We didn't eat there since they were having Off the Grid right outside. We did explore the gift shop though and they do have quite a few interesting items. I purchased a black reusable tote bag for $15).\n\nOverall a really great museum. Might come back sometime in the future for a more in-depth visit.", "author": "Jenny C."}

Whether it's a classic Disney cartoon, a full length animated classic, one of his many theme parks, a TV show or a live action movie, everyone has some sort of positive, magical memory that is linked to Walt Disney.\n\nPersonally, I have seen every full length Disney animated classic, I've probably seen almost every old cartoon, watched almost all the companies movies, been to all the US theme parks and read many books on Walt. Since I'm such a huge fan of Walt, I really didn't gather too much new information on him when visiting The Disney Family Museum. However, that doesn't mean I didn't have an awesome time, because I did. I loved watching his family's home movies that show him playing with his kids, reading his personal hand written notes to his associates, listening to what his peers thought of him and more. And of course it wouldn't be a Disney museum without some Disney magic. There are many fun, interactive exhibits you can play with that give you a better insight to how special an individual Walt really was.\n\nThe museum starts off when Walt was born on December 5, 1901 in Chicago, Illinois, moves onto his teenage years when he was an ambulance driver in the World War, takes you through all his trials and tribulations of becoming an animator and studio owner, shows you how he became the industries leader in making cartoons, movies and television, lets you see how he came up with the theme parks and ends with his untimely death on December 15th, 1966, in Burbank, California at the age of 65.  The final room, which is all about his death, is very moving. There was not a dry eye in that room while I was there, including my own.\n\nNow, if you're a casual Disney fan, you may not enjoy this museum too much. Small children especially may find it boring. If you want to learn all there is to know about Walt, his company and the way he changed the animation industry, TV industry, movie industry and theme parks, you'll absolutely love The Walt Disney Family Museum. In my opinion, the world is a much better place because of Walt Disney. He touched so many people all over the world and this museum shows you how he did that. He worked very hard, was an imaginative genius, was a devoted father and husband and an overall magical person.\n\nPrice for an adult admission is $20 but if you're a AAA card holder, it's only $15. They also have many special events that take place at this museum like movie screenings and discussions. They do not allow cameras inside the actual museum, only the first room where all his many awards are housed.  \n\nIf you live in the bay area or are just visiting, please check out the Disney Family Museum . There is so much great information here about my hero, Walt Disney that by the time you leave, you'll know almost as much as I do about this enchanting man.", "author": "Craig R."}

I just got back today after getting a membership (P.S. College students: you can get a discounted membership). This museum is not run by the Walt Disney Company. The museum is a non profit created by Walt's daughter and heirs. The museum does not seem that large, but when you get inside, you realize it is huge. \n\nThe museum tells the story of Walt's life. You start at his early life and travel through the museum all the way till his death. You travel from his early days, arriving in Hollywood, to the rise of his animation empire, to his moving on to other projects, like Disneyland. There are lots of really great exhibits, showing how animation works, a multiplane camera, a diagram of Disneyland and so much more. This museum has a lot of reading, and not that many interactive exhibits. Parents, this may be a museum you go to the first time, without the kids, just so you can take it all in. \n\nThe museum also holds lots of film screenings, special events (a must for Disney fans!) and has special exhibits. The special exhibits are in the annex building, which has a smaller, more intimate feel. The current exhibit is the Mary Blair exhibit, which is filled with great artwork, for all those who love Mary Blair, or even those who don't know who she is. Previously they had a Snow White special exhibit, which was also very well done. \n\nFinally, I wanted to talk about membership. This museum has an awesome membership program.

The Museum is two stories and literally walks you through the life story of Walt Disney from his birth to his death. They have family heirlooms of Mr. Disney including letters from his childhood, pictures of his family, etc. All his major cartoons are showcased along with in depth stories behind the creation of each. I had no idea how much shady stuff had occurred regarding his cartoons and concepts being stolen by Warner Bros, how many woman were involved in the production of many of his cartoons ,and how many times he fell flat on his face and experience gigantic failures. I thought my daughter might be bored with the museum but they have great hands on activities  such as creating soundtracks for cartoon reels. I particularly liked that certain things that Mr. Disney did such as trying to block the unionization of his workers was also shown, there was no whitewashing here. \n\nThis is definitely not a day long museum trip but if you have two or three hours to kill and want to learn a little more about the history behind the Disney empire, I highly recommend this museum.", "author": "Rebecca T."}

We really appreciated that there was a staff member posted there to answer our questions/chime into our conversation about what rides are still there and a little more history about the park. Of course, my friends and I are all early 30s and the DIsneyland model was what interested my friend's 3 year old daughter the most.\n\nIn those 3-4 hours we were there I feel like there's a lot I skipped over because I was antsy and my feet hurt, and we didn't even see a film or any specific exhibit.

I've been to Disneyworld in Orlando twice, once relatively recently for a family reunion.  For all of my personal experiences ranging from theme parks, books, movies, television, music that came from the Disney camp, I honestly did not know much about the man himself.

I would find it nearly impossible to be able to explore the entire museum and all of its contents in one visit, even if you spent the entire day here.  Most of the exhibits contain quite a bit of reading material, so you may find yourself staring at the wall while reading what seems to be a novel (this actually reminds me of some of the exhibits in the SFMOMA).\n\nNear the end of the tour, be sure to take your time to soak in the amazing views of the Golden Gate bridge as you walk towards the finale.  I'm always intrigued by the interesting architectural design of the window panels and the white wall with TV panels.  I usually just take a seat here for about 10 minutes and give my eyes a rest from all of the reading.\n\nAnd for the finale (where they don't allow you to take pictures and they actually have someone standing there to make sure you don't but I've snuck in a few here and there but just don't tell anyone that), you enter a room that contains a very cool miniature of Disneyland that is completely decked out and very detailed.

Museum is mostly about his life and his achievements. Don't think it'd be a great place for kids though considering its not about Disneyland or Mickey Mouse. Although my favorite part was the Disneyland part of the museum, very cool to learn how he came up with the idea on his own and started with his own money. The area the museum is located in is also a very nice area, hidden behind the woods in a very nice community. Would be a great place to have a stroll through in the spring. Also has a cafe we didn't get to try out. As well as a theater downstairs where they show movies, they were showing Pinocchio that day. Overall a nice place to spend your day.", "author": "Eric D."}

When a fellow Disney maniac, *ahem*, \"enthusiast\" rolled into town, we put on comfy shoes and hit up The Walt Disney Family Museum for a relaxing Sunday. \n\nWell by golly, I felt like the museum was the physical incarnation of Walter \"Elias\" Disney's Wikipedia page. His creativity, genius, passion, trials and tribulations, family life and friendships all spill out and speak to you. The exhibits have been thoughtfully created with a perfect balance of photos, letters, videos, historical interviews, original sketches and storyboards, collector's item memorabilia, actual camera and equipment that revolutionized the cartoon industry and even includes multiple Oscar statuettes, awards and accolades. Bonus points for a tastefully small gift shop that features beautiful coffee table books, art material and figurines. Since the museum was founded by Walt's daughter Diane, it's a loving nod to everything he stood for and brings you deep behind the scenes on how these classics came to life and what an indelible mark he left on the industry and the world. \n\nTwo tips: Carve out enough time to walk through his life chronologically. The museum was much bigger than it appeared and I spent too much time reading each paragraph about his childhood and realized I was only a fifth of the way through the exhibits without much time to spare. It's also not the most kid-friendly place and more suitable for adults who heart Disney. There's quite a bit of text and historical info and young ones might get bored fairly easily (or tire out)!", "author": "Faith Y."}

A lot of the long introductory texts were placed right at the entrance of the major galleries.

I had to skip over a few of the more popular exhibits as the lines are often long. I will budget about 3 hours if you plan to see everything in greater details.

I didn't understand the special exhibits/movie are all separate fees because white on orange is hard to read in the board. I eventually saw the Mary Blair's exhibit after some back and forth, there is a Marc Davis exhibit somewhere that is still a mystery and I never found it, but ran out of time anyway, since I was lost in the presidio for 2 hours driving in circles earlier in the day.\n\nTo fully enjoy and interact with just the main museum you need at least 2.5-3 hours,and the special exhibit probably at least half an hour to an hour and then there's an hour and a half movie if you like, so you could easily spend the entire day there. Though be warned the caf\u00e9 is expensive, but so are all other museum caf\u00e9s, so that's nothing new really. \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised at the size of the museum, but they could use some more security through telling people to get off their phones or stop talking so loudly. We happened to be around a few parties of loud talkers, and they weren't talking about the exhibit, which was annoying. We spent extra time waiting them to move on, but kept catching up to them.\n\nAlso don't be tricked into taking the elevator down at the end of the war movie stuff, continue on the path to see awesome miniatures disney collected, a great view of the golden gate and a disneyland model.

For $20 per person, I expected  a lot of interactive pieces and there wasn't much. Ultimately, I came out of the museum feeling unhappy, which is sad because Disney is supposed to be uplifting.\n\nI did not go to see the movie they were playing \"Alice in the Wonderland\". but I believe I would have had to pay extra to see it. I believe they give out discounts to AAA members and students, among some others, but only a couple of dollars off.\n\nOverall, you can skip this museum and save your money to go somewhere that is more worthwhile.", "author": "Mona H."}

Welllllll now you know, + so like any true Disney fan, I made a trip to the one + only Walt Disney Family Museum on a recent trip back home. Yes, I do find it odd that the Walt Disney Museum is in SF (rather than somewhere that Walt had actually lived or worked) + hidden in the Presidio of all places, but hey, all the more convenient for me!\n\nWe pulled up to the unassuming brick building http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0LOx2_t8mUQ8zB_JY5pBHg?select=wSiyMVmkA40_Psx1_31uiw on a weekend afternoon + only knew we were at the right place by the small signs along the lampposts + on the front grass http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0LOx2_t8mUQ8zB_JY5pBHg?select=3ojo6iKwP25sAi7j8OsNAw. It wasn't crowded, surprisingly, + to my relief, the fellow visitors around us were mostly adults so we didn't have to be concerned about infants or children disturbing the experience.  \n\nThe museum, itself, consists of 10 galleries that chronologically follow Walt Disney's life starting from his family's genealogy in Europe to his passing away + the legacy that has followed. You begin the journey in a waiting room full of awards + Oscar trophies until it is time for your timed-entry group to enter the first gallery on the first floor. Here is where you see a glimpse of Walt's childhood + modest upbringing in the Midwest before taking an elevator up to the second floor to follow his early career + hardships as he ventured west before finding success with his now-famous beloved cartoon, Mickey Mouse. Continuing through the growth of Disney's thriving business in film, merchandising, + then eventually his theme parks through the decades, the exhibits then begin to spiral down http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0LOx2_t8mUQ8zB_JY5pBHg?select=grefdG7z1lnSH7wy4Jz4hw to the last 50 years of expansion of the Disney empire.\n\nIf the story of Walt Disney's life is not inspiring + admirable enough as it is, the layout + presentation of the museum will wow you for sure. Each gallery contains countless amounts of original artwork in the form of drawings, model figurines, film clips, etc as well as actual personal correspondences, photographs, documents, + memorabilia with captions, quotes + stories that explain the meaning behind each piece. Passing from room to room brings a refreshing new experience as the interior decor embodies varying themes + color palettes beautifully complemented by creative wall + freestanding installations, light fixtures + the architecture.   \n\nI went with my family on this visit, + we probably spent a little over 4 hours there in total as we were taking our time admiring everything in each of the rooms, watched all the video clips, + of course, made a visit to the Museum Store gift shop afterwards. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/0LOx2_t8mUQ8zB_JY5pBHg?select=EX4q7ne0jxKMqRKG51Bosw Highly recommending for all Disney fans who are of age (I'd personally say about at least 10 years old?) to patiently appreciate the detail + artistry in this peek into Disney's life. In a few years, I would definitely like to come back to visit the museum again!  \n\nAdmission is $20 for adults, $15 for seniors (65+), $15 for students (must have school id) + $12 for kids (6-17).", "author": "Janelle Q."}

It may sound like a great place to bring the kids but do everyone a favor and wait until your child is a bit older. \n\nThe museum is located in the Presidio, one of the most beautiful places in San Francisco. If you come on a weekend, parking is plentiful and free so that's definitely a plus. Ticket prices are pretty expensive (if you aren't a member nor plan on becoming one) - $20 for an adult general admission. We got the combo ticket today (general admission + special exhibit admission) which was $25. If you buy the special exhibit admission separately it's $10 so you save $5. FYI, you cannot apply your AAA discount of $5 when you get the combo since it's already discounted. \n\nThe museum is very big and in depth. It's best to go when you have a few hours and are not in a rush. There is a lot to read and appreciate (that's why it's not great for young kids as they will look around and be bored really quickly). In the middle of the museum (as you are walking through) there is an entire wall of glass that gives you an amazing view of the Golden Gate Bridge. \n\nThe special exhibit going on right now is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. There is a lot of the original artwork on display and definitely worth paying the extra $5 to go and see if you are at the museum. One of the employees told me that it is so popular that it may be traveling after April 14th when it is finished at the Walt Disney Family Museum (as opposed to being in storage).\n\nIf you have to use the restroom, go downstairs in the main building. There you will get to see all the retro posters advertising the different parts of Disneyland (Tomorrowland, Fantasyland, etc.). \n\nI grew up in Southern California and have been to Disneyland numerous times but I love that I got to truly see how it all started with Walt Disney.

This place is a treasure. From entrance to exit, the museum manages to be cozy, educational, and accessible. The exhibits are multimedia, featuring original drawings, story boards, photographs of the studios, movie clips, musical scores, and collectible Disney items (including a Snow White charm bracelet by Cartier). If you want to take a peek, interactive galleries are here: http://www.waltdisney.org/interactive-galleries#. It's interesting to read about Walt's humble beginnings, his passion for his art, and his faith in animation. His exuberance and enthusiasm are contagious; he's one of those guys you wish you could have known. I was inspired by his vision, a world in which visual art and music unite in a unique, original way to inspire ideas and emotions. Nothing like it had existed before him, and there has been nothing like it since. \n\nThere is a short film worth watching on the creation of Fantasia; Walt describes how artists were asked to listen to music by famous composers such as Bach and Tchaikovsky, and drew what they felt and saw when they closed their eyes. What was born from these creative, inspired sessions were eight animated segments many of us remember from childhood, including The Sorcerer's Apprentice. The concept drawings are fascinating, as is hearing the story behind the story. \n\nWe were lucky enough to get into the 4pm showing of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. I loved it as a kid, but never saw it on the big screen. What a treat! It is amazing to see how much animation has changed over the years. I have a new found appreciation for the beauty and difficulty of drawing each frame by hand, the camera work required to give depth perception, and for the artists who spent their lives sharing their gifts with us.

I also enjoyed seeing his pioneering visions when he entered into the animation field of work.  He truly was a great innovator that was ahead of his time.  From Steamboat Willie to Snow White and then subsequently Disneyland, all of these great ideas came from the active and brilliant imagination of Walt Disney despite many trials and tribulations over the course of his career.  \n\nOverall, this museum is worth visiting at least once for anyone who has grown up with Disney and want to know who the man was and how he created the cartoon and animation genre.  As some Yelpers have mentioned, the museum tour ends with Walt Disney's death so there won't be anything in there with Pixar's footprint on there.

Be warned: A lot of people know this!\n\nThere were two major exhibits going on: the permanent collection, which is in the main building, and the Snow White exhibit, in a neighboring building. Tip: You don't have to go to both. You can choose one or the other. Since we didn't realize this, the Manpanion and I ended up getting tickets to both. \n\nWe hit the Snow White exhibit first. It took about an hour to get through. I really enjoyed reading the history behind the film. I had no idea the impact it had on filmmaking and animation. The exhibit showcases how the characters were designed and how the story was adapted from its various versions. It'll definitely give you a new respect for the film!\n\nThe permanent collection is much longer and I highly recommend that folks give themselves about three hours to get through everything. You don't really understand the magnitude of Walt Disney's contributions until you see this collection. It's quite detailed and there are so many components that it's easy to get lost and overwhelmed. While I enjoyed it, I'm definitely going to come back and see all the things I missed out on the first time around.\n\nAnother cool discovery is that they have a theater where they screen select films.

Wow, I haven't had so much fun reading beautifully crafted texts and playing with all the different instruments and touch-screen monitors inside.\n\nThe best part of this museum is the miniature re-creation of Disneyland and definitely the glass view of Golden Gate Bridge. On a sunny day, you'll get awesome pictures of the beautiful bridge.\n\nThe staff inside are REALLY friendly and are willing to help you navigate through all the crazy exhibits. My favorite exhibit is one of the earlier stages of his animation career.  I've learned so much about Walt's career and struggles from this museum. He is truly an inspiration for adults and kids everywhere.\n\nA MUST-VISIT for anyone visiting San Francisco or the Bay Area and anyone who loves animation!", "author": "Vinky I."}

If you are a fan of Disney history at all, this is a must-visit. Tons of information on the makings of the Walt Disney Company, on Walt Disney's humble beginnings, and if you have any sort of inclination to learn about the world of animation and its origins, you NEED to come here. Be warned - if you're a huge Disneyland fan and are expecting to get a Disneyland-like experience here, that's not what you'll find. You'll recognize the design and technical elements like you'd find in the park (as expected), but there is only one large room dedicated to Disneyland.

Even though it wasn't as interactive as, say, Disneyland, there were videos, sketches, memorabilia, murals, etc. that was just exciting to see and read about. For the price, it was quite awesome.

I have read much about the man, himself and everything that is Disney oriented.  My grandmother was a childhood friend of Walt and his sister back in Missouri.  Every few years, I head to Disneyland for vacation every since I was little.  Disneyland has fond memories for me.  \n\nAnyhow, I did like the layout of the museum and the experience in itself was enjoyable.  The displays were educational and there was much video footage throughout.  My favorite exhibit was the small scale of Disneyland with actual moving parts.\n\n But there were a few reasons why I did not like it.  First, this museum lacks hands-on exhibits.  It involves mostly exhibits with reading text.  This would be okay if you wanted to just spend hours learning about Walt Disney through text.  But in a way, I was hoping for an amusement park like atmosphere with a fun and interactive way to learn about this amazing person.\n\nSecond, you are not allowed to take pictures while in the museum.  And yet, there is a picture book you can buy in the gift shop, although it is not cheap at $34.95.   Still, people often want to take pictures of their family and friends or even take a picture of themselves to prove that they were there.  But taking pictures is not allowed.  That sucks!\n\nThird, the gift shop items are pricey.  It is actually cheaper to buy merchandise at the regular Disney Store or better yet, at the nearby Disney store outlet (AMS) which is open at a nearby shopping mall for a limited time.  For about the price of a necklace I had liked at the museum gift shop, I was able to buy a Disneyland hat and charm bracelet for about $10 less at the outlet!\n\nFourth,  I did not like that fact that not everything is included in the museum admission.  The new Snow White exhibit admission is separate from the museum's admission.  I am a huge fan of the Snow White movie but I would have to wonder with the lack of information I found at the museum regarding this Snow White exhibit,  if it was worth paying another $10 to go to it.  Personally, I think that there should be one straight admission fee that covers all exhibits and events at the museum for that day.\n\n\nPros:\n-great place to learn about Walt Disney\n-nice layout of the museum\n\nCons:\n-lack of hands on exhibits\n-no taking pictures allowed\n-gift shop items are pricey\n-not all exhibits are included in the general admission", "author": "Irene S."}

I was there for five and a half hours and was never bored once. The artifacts, video and audio clips, the history - it was well worth the time. \n\nThe opportunity to hear Walt's voice and see his image in video could only be matched by seeing in person artifacts such as original furnishings from the Disney apartment above the Disneyland Firehouse; the actual Carolwood Pacific engine #173, the tender, and several boxcars and gondolas; the incredible scale model of Walt's Disneyland; personal effects that once belonged to Walt and Lillian; dozens and dozens of awards and honors bestowed upon Walt from around the world; and, the heartwarming quotes from Diane Disney Miller throughout the two-story museum. \n\nWalt Disney has meant a lot to me in my lifetime and has been an inspiration, role model, and icon for me. This experience was the closest I'll ever get to meeting Walt and his family now that all of his immediate family with the exception of Diane have passed on. \n\nThank you WDFM for making my dream come true today.

Are there museums to explore?\" he asked.  \n\"Let's go to the Walt Disney Museum!\" I exclaimed.\n\"Why there?\"  he asked.\nWhile I can't remember my official answer, the reason was that I wanted to show him my unhealthy obsession with all things Disney early in our relationship so he could run away before we really started to like each other.  \n\nSuffice it to say that while he tends to mock me at every available moment about said unhealthy obsession, he's stuck around.  Bonus points for him.  \n\nLike others have mentioned- this is really a museum for adults.  While some of the younger generation will recognize Snow White or Mickey Mouse, it's the adults who will appreciate clips of the Silly Symphonies or cast photos of the original Mickey Mouse Club.  \n\nTruth be told, I love that museum.  Sure, there were parts I skipped over because it REALLY gets into Walt Disney's life, and there are a ton of recorded interviews you can listen to, but it's an inspiration that a man with his background became one of the most influential men in all of media (and has the most Oscars to boot- trivia question.  Look for the one for Snow White- they are original Oscars, and they are all on display).\n\nParts I loved- the whole Disneyland section...for obvious reasons.  Particularly the little replica.  Also, although I almost cried, the part at the end when it covers his death was very touching.  \n\nIf I ever need a Disney fix, I'll come here.  It's well worth it.\n\nOne tip: Don't bother taking a cab out there- your cabdriver will not be able to fathom that there is a Montgomery Street in the Presidio, and will keep trying to take you to the Financial District.

The museum is a journey from Walt's very early family life, his military years, his first adventures into cartooning, all the way up to the creation of many characters and movies we know today. I have a feeling that this museum was done better than some presidential museums. \n\nI love taking pictures of places I know I'll be Yelping- however taking pictures in the museum is not allowed. I guess it's better that way though- I wouldn't want to spoil some of the awesome things you'll be seeing in here! A lot of previous Yelp reviews suggest that bringing kids here is a no-no, but if you're kids can appreciate Disney(and can stay QUIET in a museum) then I say go for it! \n\nBring a student ID and save $5. If you are lucky enough to be a Bay Area resident- the Walt Disney Family Museum is a must see local attraction. If you're a tourist reading this review deciding whether this museum is for you- It's a little out of the way from all the other downtown SF tourist attractions, but it sits right next to the Golden Gate Bridge and Yoda Statue http://www.yelp.com/biz/yoda-fountain-at-lucasfilms-hq-san-francisco#hrid:-Z_eJKTOcVohlivHPNyKgA/src:self\n\n5 Stars- Magical, Inspiring, Great place to go.", "author": "Greg G."}

It was very interesting to learn about Walt's early life, as well as his career. \n\nI was visiting with all adults, and the one thing that surprised me was that this place is definitely NOT a good place for kids. It is a museum about the Walnut Disney Family, not a family museum about Walt Disney. It is entirely geared towards adults, with very few interactive activities and lots of reading. It was  a pretty busy day, and there was only one couple with a child there, who was getting obviously antsy after just a short time in the museum, because there really was nothing to keep their attention.

The museum contains so much of Disney's life, work, creative process, and more; I learned much more than I had expected to. The interactive audio tools for kids are great. My favorite part of the museum was the miniature model of Walt Disney's vision of Disneyland, it was so interesting to see all the attractions that still exist today and what had been originally planned. As a child of the early 90s I admit to hoping there were some displays about The Lion King inside; there aren't any, but I learned a ton about the older works of Disney than I previously knew. The museum also has a cute little gift shop (I recommend picking up some pins!) and cafe with delicious Ginger Beer. Being located in the historic Presidio was an absolute bonus for me; the buildings have a lot of history and are beautiful to walk amongst.

Beautifully and thoughtfully designed and costs not spared to bring an extensive and gorgeous museum to the Presidio.

There was sooo much crammed into this museum that I got a little tired of it after a while, but don't let that deter you from checking this place out. \n\nThe design was the best aspect. Beautiful views of the Golden Gate Bridge. High tech features. Interactive displays. It really couldn't get much better. My fav was the room towards the end dedicated to the building of Disney Land. The miniature model of the Park was AWESOME!!! I couldn't take my eyes off of it. I'd go just to see that room.

I've grown up with the movies, and have visited Disneyland during an insane amount of family vacations growing up and presently as an adult.  \n\nSo naturally, I've always wondered about the background, the  r e a l  background of Walt Disney, this mangnificant person who helped to contribute to so many great memories for me as a child.  This museum is a true testimony of proof that if you have a love and passion for your interests can truly reach your dreams in life.  \n\nI had the opportunity to visit to Walt Disney Family Museum with my good friend Johnny W. this past Valentine's Day since we both share a huge love for all things Disney. \n\nUpon entering the museum in the Presidio, you are first visually stimulated by the abundance of various awards and recognitions that Disney has earned over the years including the actual Oscar's that the Walt Disney company has won.  \n\nThis museum is not a  museum for kids looking for the colorful Disney characters and waiting in line to get their autograph and pictures taken. But it is instead a \"Story\" of Walt's backgroud and life as a small town farm boy to being one of the world's most influencial characters himself, in conquering the entertainment and travel world.  Afterall, Walt Disney was first and foremost, a Storyteller.   \n\nThe museum is chronologically laid out starting with the humble beginnings of his family prior to their immigration to America, and concludes perfectly with Walts final projects in the making, and a tribute to his life with various newspaper articles, Telegrams of fans who express their sympathy, and cartoon drawings depicting the pain and loss that the world has encountered with his death.  I found this exhibit of the museum to be the most touching.  \n\nWe all know of his movies and his parks throughout the world, so there's no need for further explaination here.  But to me, it was visiting this museum that put a deeper meaning to the entire Disney empire that has contributed so much Happiness to my life over the years.\n\nP.S. - Pictures are not allowed anywhere in the museum, as the staff scope you out like starving hawks.   But despite this sour note, my love for all things Disney continues to grow.", "author": "Cass J."}

The museum has displayed everything in a wonderful and thoughtful way and also added interactive elements to make learning fun.  It's great for kids and adults alike, especially history buffs and those who are interested in animation or all things Disney.  I liked how the videos were framed in lovely picture frames so it seemed like they were pictures but there was movement and speech.  I also liked the spectacular view of the Golden Gate bridge (more on that later) as well as the model of Disneyland with moving parts.  The wall of Oscars and all the awards that Disney amassed was pretty incredible too!  The museum also shared some of Walt's failures such as his first picture company going bankrupt so I liked that even though he had failures, he was able to pick himself up and stay true to his vision.  My favorite part though was the special exhibit featuring Mary Blair's artwork.  Mary Blair was the artist behind Alice in the Wonderland, Peter Pan, Cinderella, and It's a Small World.  She also illustrated many little Golden books.  It was great to see all her work in one place and it would be very inspiring to a budding young artist.  There was even a sketch book where kids drew pictures of what they enjoyed in the exhibit - I was amazed at the talent!  this special exhibit is in a separate building but easy to get to if you follow the decals on the sidewalk.\n\nI think we spent 3 to 4 hours here - and towards the end it was information overload for me.  I would probably recommend coming on two separate occassions so you can soak everything in.  The unexpected bonus was the $20 million view of the Golden Gate bridge through the wall that was made entirely of glass to afford a complete view of the bridge.  Wow!  I grew up in SF but the bridge just takes my breath away and I can take a ton of pictures of it and still not get bored!\n\nEntrance fee is $20 for adult, and $15 for students and seniors.  Special exhibit is an additional $5.  It's pricey but definitely worth it.  Unlike some other local museum which has a fabulous location but not enough content to fill it's space (and I won't name the museum), this place has both a great location and a wonderful exhibit with substance.  It's a true local gem. i took a ton of pictures - pictures are allowed BUT NO FLASH!!!

Couldn't get enough of it, was the family afficianado when it came to knowing all the insider information about Disneyland Park, followed the early history word by word in books and memorized the lyrics to every song up through Beauty and the Beast.\n\nOh, but wait, this isn't about my obsession with Disney. This is about the Walt Disney Family Museum and how awesome it is to finally have the inside glimpse to the area of which there hasn't been much public knowledge: Walt, his family and how innovative, intelligent and determined he was to succeed in the risky business of animation. I will admit that it starts off a little dry, being centered in the early 1900s and moving up through his birth, which is a bit harder for the youth to really relate to. But it weaves a story, much like Walt believed in doing when he was creating films, and had me hooked by the second room. Once you were able to see his early drawings and publications, well, the crack phase starts to kick in. \n\nThis is definitely a place to take anyone and everyone touched by Disney, who will be have the patience to read a lot and really spend time with the exhibits.

If you are a fan of the old Disney movies, you will love this place.    \n\nIt is located in the middle of the Presidio.  Its in a amzaing location with the bay nearby and isolated from the city.  Its in a old brick building.   And when you walk in you entered the life and imagination of Walt Disney. \n\nWow is all I have to say, its a wonderful museum.   First you enter into the early life of Walt, a humble life, to a cartoonist, and then to the development of Walt Disney company.  There is lots of pictures, short videos,of his life and of his work.  There is a lot to see and absorb.  You view the characters, story development, and then to the development of Disneyland.  I spent about three hours in this place and was absorbed by story of Walt Disney.", "author": "Richard G."}

We ended up buying the membership but if you buy the day pass it is reasonably priced at $20 per adult.  There is so much to see and a lot to learn about Walt, the man, even before he became famous.  The bathrooms are super clean and make sure that you visit the gift shop for some cool souvies on the way out.  Some are overly priced but some are fairly reasonable and if you get the membership you get 10% off.  If you go on a Sunday there is a picnic in the park event right across the street with food trucks and vendors offering a large variety of items.  The feel of the location is worth the drive to the Presidio.  Parking is on the street and reasonably priced.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-06-10", "description": "This is definitely a historical museum. You learn about the history of Walt Disney and what his company was when he originally started it. There are about 14 rooms and I would plan a good two to three hours to be able to read/watch everything. DON'T COME AFTER 4PM IF YOU CAN HELP IT!!!! The museum closes at six and the employees will start to rush you at like 5:15. If you want a pleasant and enjoyable experience I would plan to get there either when it opens at 10 or in the middle of the day or early afternoon. \n\nThey show movies, sometimes there is one at 11 then the others are at 1:30 and 4pm. I think you can look up on their website what movies are playing but it is included in your ticket price so thats a nice bonus if you want to see a Disney Classic. \n\nI think that this museum is more for adults but on the weekends they have more family/kid friendly activities like open studio where you can do an art project (like animation) and kids are more than welcome to those classes. Otherwise I think your kid may get bored if they are under the age of 12. \n\nBecause the museum is located in the presidio it took me awhile to find the place. There are TWO Montgomery Streets in San Francisco and that is super confusing, so when you put the address into your gps, make sure you go to the Presidio and not downtown! You have to pay for parking, but I think it is because of the museum being on government property and they don't really get a say in it. It is something like $1 per hour or $7 for all day. I would say to just get the $7 parking because that is pretty darn cheap for the city and then you don't have to keep running outside to fill the meter. \n\nSome of the highlights for me were the oscars in the lobby, the silly symphony room, the war propaganda (super interesting!), and then this huge model of disneyland! I am a huge Disneyland fan, so this was really neat! You are allowed to take pictures which was awesome but they tell you no flash and when you are at the disneyland model they get a little upset if you put your camera over the glass to take a picture (I was able to snag a couple before getting caught!). \n\nOverall, I think this a fantastic museum! I just got a student membership and it works great for me because I like being able to take a friend with me to the museum to show them some of the great things about Walt. They have a number of membership levels, mine is the basic so I get myself and one guest in. It's a great deal too because it gets you into whatever the special exhibition is! Most other museum memberships I have I still have to pay for the special exhibit, so that is a major plus. I know they have a membership where you can get three people in or something like that, but it was just out of my price range! It is worth it, especially if you plan on coming more often than not. Also, they let you apply your tickets to the membership, so say you want to check out the museum before getting a membership they will let you use those tickets for a membership, so that was a bonus for me! \n\nI would definitely schedule time if you are ever in San Francisco to see this place!", "author": "A.J.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-29", "description": "Once upon a time, in a far away land, a baby named Walt was born. \n\nLittle did the world know, he was going to be one of the world's most influential and innovative man. \n\nEven though the name Disney has become synonymous with princesses, family films and of course, Disneyland, leave your stereotypical thoughts of Disney at home.  For this newly constructed Walt Disney Family Museum pays homage to Walt Disney's life.  He was only 65 years old when he passed, but no other man has accomplished what he had.  Although it looks unassuming from the outside, this is a 2 story museum which has 10 galleries depicting his family history and his life here on earth.   So, you think that's boring and it seems to cater more to history buffs, but I give credit when credit is due.  There is no other museum like this.  It's highlighted with 21st century touches:  there are HD TVs displaying filmed artifacts or narrating his work.  This makes for an easier learning experience if you're not into reading all those information plaques.  There are interactive audio handsets at some stations and touch screen monitors which allow users to browse through antique documents.  \n\nThe galleries are extremely detailed.  You'll find cherished documents such as original drawings of Mickey Mouse, a wall (on the 2nd floor) with Steam Boat Willie's frame by frame stills and cameras used by Walt Disney in his various productions are randomly placed everywhere.  For those interested in animation and special effects, there is a Schultheis Notebook (the notebook of the special effects man of \"Fantasia\")  under glass but there is an interactive display for that.  \n\nNeedless to say, this museum caters more to the adult crowd or children 10 and up.  There are stretches where it's boring, but I loved Gallery 9 which has the miniature scale version of Disneyland.  The model is lovely to look at with its lights and moving parts.  It just brings back memories of when I went to Disneyland. Also, in this gallery, younger patrons will probably appreciate the model trains on display.\n\nI didn't partake of the food in the cafe, though the prices are expensive for the small portions.  You've got the usual salads and sammies, cookies and other pastries.  Mini-cupcakes are $2.50 each. \n\nSome people mentioned that there are not enough restrooms on the second floor, they're right, so go to the restrooms at the ground floor (where the theater is,yes you can buy tickets for the movie showings here) which has more stalls.  \n\nI was lucky enough to snag preview passes, but don't fret, the museum opens this Thursday, Oct. 1.  Tickets are $20 and it's timed entry, so buy your tickets in advance.  There are plenty of parking available in this area and take note that on the ticket stub it says that strollers are not allowed in the museum. The no photography rule was also enforced and they watched us like hawks.

We spent an hour and a half on the gorgeous Mary Blair and Marc Davis special exhibits, and had only a hour and a half left to visit the main exhibit, where we could have used another hour (and we also barely got to look at the Oscars in the entrance hall). \n\nThe special exhibits are beautiful with mostly drawings and paintings, a few cartoon clips, and some tablets that enable you to flip through text from original journals displayed nearby.\n\nThe main exhibit is a rich and overwhelming mix of clips, quotes, audio, telegrams, photos, merchandise, etc. that takes you on a journey of Walt Disney's life. The exhibits included difficulties and mistakes as well as triumphs. By the end, while I did not know much about Walt Disney before going to the museum, I was so emotionally invested that I could not help choking up while reading the sympathy messages about his death. \n\nThe journey also reflects the American story of this time period, and the reminders at the beginning of each room about other major events in film history and American history helped highlight these links.

No fireworks, character greetings, rides, or theme music.  However, stepping into the exhibit is a whole new world (haha, see what I did there? ^_^)  In true Disney fashion, this museum impresses with its scrupulous attention to detail... from the architectural path that leads you through the deceptively small building, to the devices you use to hear sound bites, to the strategic placement and design of seating.  At $20 for an adult ticket ($17 with a discount, and as low as $10 on Groupon), you can immerse yourself in the life of Walt Disney, the man.  I spent about 3 hours there, but you could probably spend more.  To get the full story of his life, a lot of reading is involved, but it is balanced with realia, videos, sound files, and a few interactive displays.  Because of its more informative nature, I imagine younger kids would get bored very quickly, so consider carefully before shelling out that $12 for the youth rate (6-17 years).  \n\nSide note: go on a holiday to park for free!

The museum is spotless, well organized and honors an individual whose creativity, talent and vision earned him a place in American culture and throughout the entire world.  I learned so much about Walt and his family that I never would've known had I not learned it here.  Of course, I also learned a bit about animation, film, story writing, editing, sound, color, etc...  and how Walt was ahead of his time in implementing all of this into what would one day become Walt Disney Productions.  \n\nThe museum lays out Walt's life in chronological order and one can truly see him not only as a creative man with a futuristic vision, but also as a family man and friend to all those who knew him. The vast array of personal letters, photographs, and voice recordings throughout the exhibit greatly impact his life story and ultimate success.  He never forgot those who helped and encouraged him along the way.  He also dealt with failures yet persevered because he believed in himself and his futuristic vision.\n\nAlthough his life ended abruptly at age 65, he's allowed countless people around the world to enjoy his many creations through his numerous films and Disney amusements parks, and will continue to do so with future generations.\n\nA must see in the museum is the display of Academy Awards (Oscars) that he received for his many films.

Thankfully it wasn't too overcast.\n\nAdult tickets are $20 so I basically paid half with the Google offer. Kids under 6 are free and you get a discount if you're a student.

While growing up, as a russian six year old, ive heard my parents talk about far a away place called america, which to me was about as real and tangible as anything i've heard in a fairy tale or read in a childrens book. Until, that is, i watched my first disney cartoons featuring mickey mouse, and other characters, those must have been classics from the 30s or 40s but to a 6 year old me they were new, different and exciting, and finally gave a tangible image to this place i've heard my parents talk about. So until about 10 years of age i was pretty fascinated with the idea of disney, and disney themed parks, and cartoons that company produced. Then i got over it. Then i came to the US, and found it totally weird that adults get totally excited about trips to Disney land.\n\nFast forward to the WWWDD YEE.  Not really caring too much about the company i arrived to the museum and went thru the exhibits, which are by the way expertly put together in an awesome setting.

My favorite part of the place was the first 3 galleries that detail Disney's early life and exploits.

But being a Disney fanatic, I found myself stopping to read everything and poring over all the pictures and artifacts. I pretty much did this till the halfway point (second elevator) and I realized I had to leave in about half an hour. And I think the second half was even more interesting than the first half. Well maybe Disneyland's history, maybe not (spoiler alert?) Walt Disney's death. Lots of videos and audio clips and some interactive stuff as well. That miniature model of Disneyland was one of the coolest things in there. So the second half, I just read all the really big signs and glanced at the all the pictures.

This museum is amazing for the fact that held my attention for that time period and I still wanted to stick around and see more.  I was intrigued with all the history that was presented. The subject matter, Walt Disney, being a corner stone of a lot of my childhood, kept me interested.  \nThe exhibits begin with a family history room because this place is named the \"Walt Disney Family Museum\" after all.  This was a bit dull to me, but you could start seeing the inklings of Walt's animation.  What captivated me were all of the shorts that they showed of iconic Disney films.  Some exhibits were even interactive.  A lot of exhibits had earpieces which resembled old telephones which you could place to your ears to hear the history of an exhibit in audio.  A lot of detail was put into this museum.  It truly is a hidden gem because I don't feel that if you were intent on coming here, most people wouldn't venture into this neighborhood.  \nI especially loved seeing all the short films \nPrices range from free (children 5 and under) to $20 for general admission; $15 for students (w/ valid ID's) and seniors.  There was also an additional $5 fee if you combine it with your general admission fee to see the special exhibition, which is currently Tyrus Wong, best known for \"Bambi\".  It is $10, if you want to view just the exhibition.  \nAlso, there was a featured Disney movie of the time, and when I visited, it was \"Mary Poppins\".  Be aware though, you can't just show up and expect to get a seat.  You have to inform the ticket sellers that you wanted to view the movie and you are issued a ticket.

It is definitely a must-see for my fellow Disney-nerds, or anyone who's interested in animation, cinema, or American history.\n\nAdmission for the museum is $20-$25 for adults (depending on whether you decide to see the special exhibits), and I'd allot a good 2-3 hours to get through everything. Even the main lobby is a spectacle in itself, with displays of all of the awards Walt Disney won, a replica of the living room of the Disneys' apartment on Main Street in Disneyland, and paintings and portraits that hung in the Disneys' house. Once you leave the main lobby, expect to be immersed in room after room dedicated to the life and history of Walt Disney, the Disney family, and the Disney company, from the time even before Walt was born all the way up until Walt's death. The whole museum is extremely interactive with visual displays, audio recordings, and movie and music clips playing throughout, including a ride up to the 2nd floor in an elevator tricked out to look like an old fashioned train car complete with a train \"conductor\" (as a nod to Walt's fascination and interest in trains). To many, the highlight will be near the end with the miniature replica model of an embryonic Disneyland.\n\nTo be honest, I don't know how much children (say under 10) will enjoy this museum. There is very little on the movies that kids will be most familiar with, as the museum focuses mainly on the earliest Disney movies (Steamboat Willie, Snow White, Pinocchio, Fantasia, and Dumbo), and even then, approaches them more from the perspective of how it impacted the Disney company, and filmmaking and animation in general. There are some neat parts that go into how sound, music, and colour was added to the films and plenty of imagery from the movies to ooh and aah at, but I don't know how much a kid will appreciate listening to a sound clip of Walt speaking to his banker about financing Snow White. Plus, the museum is deceptively large, so props to any kid who can make it through the whole thing without getting tired!", "author": "Stephanie T."}

This museum focuses more on the life and influences of Walt Disney. It may be boring for the kids, as it's less hands-on and more about looking at old photos, reading history tidbits, and watching film clips that show the evolution of his characters.

Aside from the museum area, there is also a cafe (catered by Wolfgang Puck) and a store. The cafe is decent (and pricey) with salads, sandwiches, soup, chips, and coffee/drinks - we ended up having lunch here since we rushed to the museum before getting the chance to eat. The store is also pretty cool filled with Walt Disney Family related and some movie related gifts (definitely not stuff you'd find at the Disney Store).\n\nThe museum area is great - very clean, organized, and good looking exhibit displays. Like others mentioned, the first floor is slightly boring - it's all information about Walt's family history and childhood - great information, but I do remember thinking \"hopefully the rest of it gets better.\"\n\nThe rest of the museum is great and I enjoyed it a lot. You'll see everything from the works of Walt before starting Disney and through the time of his death. The exhibits are very informational (lots of reading!) and I liked that every description was accompanied by some sort of visual. This came very useful when the museum referred to Disney films I had never seen or heard of - glad to have a visual/video reference. \n\nIf you come here, you'll learn a lot about not only Disney, but also topics like animation techniques, color, etc. Be prepared though - I was definitely not mentally prepared for so much information (if you want to learn, you're going to need to do a lot of reading), and got pretty tired by the end.

The museum is nestled in between these communities and you already feel excited by the time you walk in.\n\nThe arrangement of the exhibits are logical and chronological and takes you from Walt's family up until his death. They go into extreme detail about his life and take you to places you didnt know existed in the life of Disney. It's fascinating to see what inspired him and what brought him to the point where he created such an amazing legacy.\n\nThe museum itself succeeds not only in wealth of information but also presentation. There is movement and sound at every turn as exhibits combine text, pictures, video, interactivity, sound, and unique presentations to really engage you and keep you moving through his life. You can tell incredible thought went into the design and it really does make the experience that much better.\n\nI can say that this is the first museum that I actually saw EVERY SINGLE exhibit as you did not want to miss any part of this fascination journey.

I nearly collided with people at least 5 times while reading all the little plaques and whatnot because I was so  focused.  This museum is definitely more adult-oriented.  Be prepared to read when you get here... and be prepared to read A LOT.  My eyes were exhausted by the end, but it was way worth it.  It was so interesting to learn more about Walt's personal life outside of his career.  Just looking at the stuff he left behind for his family, you can tell he was a wonderful husband, father and friend-- just another reason to love and worship him even more.  By the last exhibit, my eyes were welling up... I had to try very hard not to cry.  You'll know what I mean after you've seen it. ;)", "author": "Amy H."}

I don't think you can call yourself a true fan until you do to be honest. There's just so much history to absorb it's actually quite overwhelming. At least for me it was. Even though a good portion of this museum is very hands on and interactive (lots of touch screens and games to play) i do not recommended this for children. Not only is it not the environment for kids.. I personally don't think they would appreciate it since they're so young. So this is definitely a trip to take either without the kiddies or maybe wait until they're older. Overall as a museum it's a great place. I learned a lot (most of it I already knew but still...). You get to learn the real story of Walt Disney and his life. There's just a lot to take in, so wear comfortable shoes if you intend on getting your monies worth by reading and interacting with every station. I would say it would take you at least 3-4 hours to go through the whole exhibit if you're a fast paced/average reader. So get there early!! Personally, I would say the best parts of the whole museum would be the giant miniature (contradiction?) replica of Disneyland. The attention to detail.... wow. Breathtaking! As well as the final two rooms of the exhibit leading away from the Disneyland room. I think I spent the most time that room, MORE TIME THAN WITH THE REPLICA! It was a lot to take it. I won't spoil anything. But.. it was definitely tugging the strings of my Disney loving heart...\n\nOverall, I'd say it's worth. You should at least go once in your life.

It mixed the personal and business life of Walt Disney.  I walked away knowing a lot more about the man and how he built his business then I did going in.

I usually like museums, and I think Disney is okay (although I'm not a huge fan). The tickets were more expensive than generally expected of a museum ($20 per adult) but the reviews were so great that I decided to check it out. We had a group of four people, so this was $80. The location is in a really nice area to walk around. Walking around the museum and the nearby national cemetery was actually my favorite part of the visit. They also have a very nice porch area and the facilities are clean and new.\n\nNow for the actual museum experience... \n\nI have never seen such a text-heavy museum in my life. There were paragraphs and paragraphs of information EVERYWHERE with very few objects that were interesting. It honestly reminded me of reading a book of Walt Disney's life. It was sort of like information overload. Also, the museum was pretty busy so it was hard to find space in areas that I did find interesting. The overall experience was just too overwhelming, and we basically ended up running through the museum and not learning very much at all. \n\nI can see how someone that is very interested in animation might enjoy this museum and take the time to read everything so they can follow along. Sadly, I'm not that person and the museum felt more like a chore. So much reading..... I would recommend that (if you're not an animation junkie) you check out the Legion of Honor instead.", "author": "A. N."}

However, it may seem like a museum targeted to children but I think adults, or young adults, will actually appreciate it more. \n\nIt is basically a museum showcasing Walt's remarkable life and all his creative works in ten different galleries. It will take you from the beginning, when he was born, when he started, his first creations, his struggles during the depression and the war, his accomplishments, until the very end of his life. It is very interactive, but there is also a lot of reading. But what is amazing about this museum, is hearing his own voice in a lot of the showcased materials. It is like he was personally telling you the story of his life. He is such an asset in the film industry, most especially in the cartoon animation. He is a man of courage, dedication and passion. You will definitely be inspired after leaving the gallery. \n\nI suggest though, that you plan to be there for at least 2-3 hours. I only had an hour to visit the galleries and it was not enough. I want to come back another time. \n\nBut oh, one more thing, I lolove the view of Golden Gate Bridge inside one of the galleries. I was astonished.

It's in a rather unassuming building, it doesn't even look like it could house something of this caliber seeing as it used to be an army barrack (I think?). \n\nThis place is pretty damn amazing.\n\nI think that sums it up. Lol. Just kidding! I'm pretty sure you Yelp kids expect more from me. And more you shall get. \n\nFirst off, this is definitely more of a history of Mr. Walt Disney himself and how he created his Disney empire rather than the story of Mickey Mouse. His story is pretty interesting and I read everything! I don't think I've ever read that much at a museum ever! So be prepared to read and rest your eyes the night before! Given that, do note that it will take 3-4 hours to get through the museum, took me and my friend around that long. They stamp you at the door though, so you can go out and give your eyes a rest before you go back in. Not that there's much in the vicinity to rest at/on. \n\nTheir exhibition design is amazing! Like mindblowingly awesome. All the displays be them animated or still images are cool. They find ways to make it cool. Even the biography of Walt Disney's early years, might sound boring to you now as you're reading me type about the topic. The animations make it 48392048329x more interesting. \n\nThe gift store is cool too, I wanted to bring EVERYTHING home. But little ole me on my designer's salary can't afford that. So I settled for some cutesy postcards since I'm sucha sucker for museum postcards and fresh graphic designs.\n\nI thought it was pretty cool to see the man behind the mouse and what he went through to build the empire he did. Younger kids might not enjoy the museum as much so I don't really recommend that just because of the sheer amount of reading.

There is something so fascinating about seeing the life of such a legend in my field. I can't imagine that there are many children on this planet that are not familiar with at least a few of Disney's classic characters. The museum talks about the beginnings of Mickey mouse and the beginning's of the Walt Disney studio. All of Walt Disney's accomplishments are significantly more impressive when you get the full perspective as to where Walt came from and how he built his empire. Nothing stopped him, he thrived despite his downfalls...and created some really innovative filming techniques that took animation to a whole other level as an art form as well as validating it in the competitive Hollywood world of film with the wild successes of Mickey Mouse in Steam Boat Willie, then onto Snow White and Pinocchio. \n\nThe museum has old character sheets, character models (sculptures the animators used as reference while animating,) old posters and a wicked cool model of Disneyland that lights up and the rides actually move & work like the real thing. There are also old filming rigs such as the Multi-plane Camera & their immensely complicated compositing machine that helped them create films like Mary Poppins where the animated characters interact with the live action actors shot on film. Now-a-days those film treatments are easy to come by. That wasn't the case back in Disney's day. He didn't let that stop him. He hired people to engineer a machine that helped him combine the two mediums together with a very convincing result, especially for that point in film history.\n\nIt was really interesting to see family pictures, to get a background of such a hero in the animation world.

Don't be fooled that this is for children; it's not. Unless you have a really exceptional child, this is really for high school age and above.

It took us about three hours to go through the exhibits. We found the staff to be uniquely qualified--well informed, welcoming and outgoing. Good little museum shop, too. \n\nThe Presidio is a stunning (though isolated) location. The Golden Gate views from inside the museum are eye-popping.

The next section brings you through his early adulthood--joining the military, his continued interest in drawings/animations, his marriage. Then you're brought into a room where it's all about Walt's move to California and how he got into the industry.\n\nOf course there is a whole section dedicated to his whole genius behind what we know today as Disney.

Disney, then this is the place to go. \n\nThe museum is, in true Disney fashion, very clean and with ample parking (I know, what? Ample parking in S.F?). It's location in the Presidio makes it ideal. Parking is free and directly across from the museum, which already gives it three stars in my opinion. \n\nWhen you walk in, you are immediately greeted by a friendly volunteer docent. The docent is glad to take his or her time to make sure you are familiar with what you are about to experience. \n\nWe purchased our tickets in advance for the 11:30 tour. We arrived at 10:30 and they gladly took us in an hour early. Of course this was on a very quiet Wednesday morning. Saturday may be more crowded and you may have to stick to your ticket time. The lobby has many displays to keep you busy while you wait. They also have a cafe and gift shop. (What Disney place would be complete without a gift shop?) \n\nAgain, in true Disney fashion, you are treated as their special guest as you explore all three galleries presenting the life story of Walt Disney. The layout of the museum is very well done. It has many videos and displays that will have you reading and listening with interest. You will learn not only how Walt got his start but also what propelled him and motivated him to continue his legacy of fun and laughter that will last for many generations, if not forever. \n\nI would have to warn parents that this museum is not for small children. There are not too many interactive exhibits and there is a lot of reading. They may be amused by the cartoons and short videos on display but I fear anyone under the age of 10 would be bored quickly. \n\nThe museum does have a small theater that shows Disney films for an added price. I saw some parents coming to the museum just to take their children to the theater. I mean, how cool is it to have your child still be able to see Silly Symphonies, or Peter Pan on the big screen? \n\nIn short, if you are an avid Disney fan you will love this place. If you are just a so-so Disney fan, you may not appreciate paying the $20.00 to read about Disney's family life, business life (including mistakes he made), and so on. \n\nMy favorite gallery was the last gallery that contained a miniature layout of Disneyland park. I will not spoil it for you but lets just say it almost had me in tears and did have me in goosebumps with a walk down memory lane. \n\nAnd that's what Disney is all about after all.... making wonderful memories. :)", "author": "Jules P."}

Here are my thoughts: \n\nPros: \n(+) Very detailed, great storyline of Walt Disney's life\n(+) Educational - I had not seen some of the movies and short films which Disney created, and for the movies that I had not seen or heard of in a very long time, it was a great walk down memory lane (like the Three Caballeros)\n(+) Overall cool exhibit - lots of old Disney family photographs and home movies, Disney memorabilia, telegraph messages between Walt and his brother, etc.\n(+) Towards the end there is a miniature replica of Disneyland. Can you say awesome?\n(+) Easily spent about four hours in there, if you want something interesting to do that will last you for a while, definitely go here.\n(+) They were also holding a special Snow White exhibit for another ten bucks or so. It was pretty neat as well, shows lots of the original drawings and sketches used for the movie\n(+) Also the museums provide a neat history of the development of movie and filmography\n(+) Great location in the middle of the presidio with a great view of the Golden Gate bridge\n\nCons:\n(-) The museum exhibit ends when Walt dies, and it ends really sad. They show a bunch of Disney characters crying. I left the museum feeling sad. \n(-) There is a LOT of reading in this museum. For someone who likes to look at things (like pictures, exhibits, movie clips, etc.) I got really tired of reading after a while. \n(-) We went on a weekend which makes it understandable, but it was very crowded in there. Sometimes I'd have to pace around for a few minutes before being able to read a placard because some inconsiderate baffoon would be standing in the middle of the way.\n\nAlso, neither a positive nor a negative point, but Yelp is right - this place is not good for kids. This is a museum of the Disney Family and their background and involvement in the Disney legacy and movie industry.

As an adult, I enjoyed it, but the kids that were there, especially younger ones you could tell were bored.\n\nThe museum is located in an area of the Presidio in SF that is beautiful.  It has a huge grassy area, great view of the bay, and plenty of parking (and free parking on weekends).  \n\nThe museum focuses on Walt's life.  There is very little about Disneyland, and nothing after 1966 as that is when Mr. Disney died.  It is much less interactive then I thought it would be.  About 75% of it is standard plaque displays, and you are reading information.  About 20% is audio, mostly where you pick up a headset to listen.  The remaining 5% was some videos playing, and one hands on activity where you see how sound was created for Steamboat Willy.   I took my time going through it, and it took me about 3 hours.  \n\nIt is nicely laid out in chronological order with lots of pictures, and as I mentioned above, text-based things to read.  Of course, everything is pretty much \"pro Disney\" including the brief information about the 1941 strike (which is attributed to Communists).  \n\nIf you are interested in Walt Disney as a person or the older Disney movies like Bambi, Dumbo, and Snow White, then you should enjoy a visit to the museum.

This museum is a one of a kind experience that allows the visitor to learn about the vision behind the Disney empire that we know it as today. However, don't expect to breeze through this museum in a short time. It would be easy to get lost in discovery for 2-3 hours. The Walt Disney Family Museum isn't huge so to speak, but it's filled with detailed information, movies and images. But let me start at the beginning...\n\nHidden within the Presidio, the Walt Disney Family Museum celebrate the man behind the mouse in a renovated historical building overlooking the Golden Gate bridge. It's a tranquil and beautiful setting before you even step foot inside the museum. Tickets for non-members are $20 but it's worth it.\n\nUpon entering, you're welcomed by a cafe, gift shop, ticket counter and walls filled with Disney's endless awards. And that's just the beginning. The museum wraps around and you don't really realize what you're walking into until you're there. The first room is dedicated to the early life of Walt beginning with his parents history, where he was born, where he lived, what his parents did, etc. Each room is like a timeline of his life and the best part is that it's narrated by Disney himself. They have several pictures, artifacts and videos with Disney's voice in the background, I won't go room by room, but it's definitely a historical masterpiece of information and pictures. Slowly but surely you start to see Disney's progression from small cartoons with Alice Comedy Company which ultimately led to the creation of Steamboat Willie, aka Mickey Mouse. Then the Disney fun begins. The rooms start to transform into each of Disney's magical movies such as Alice in Wonderland, Snow White, Bambi, etc. After walking through several rooms with the history of each movie, you enter a room with a ongoing reel of all of his movies. It's pure perfection with the combination of state of the art imagery, movies and original artifacts. \n\nSo now you're asking Disneyland. Me too. Luckily, an entire room is dedicated to the creation of Disneyland and it's as magical as the theme park itself. They created a special model of what Disneyland looked like at the time of Walt's death. It's amazing to see how so much of the park is the same today. It also talked about Walt's final projects and his final days. \n\nThis museum is one where a description won't do it justice. It's one where you must visit yourself and make it a day by packing a picnic and enjoying the Presidio while you're there!", "author": "Lindsey D."}

We enjoyed learning about Walt Disney and his family and his success. It was quite cool. There's a lot to see with lots of pictures. Eventually we just went through it pretty fast. It took us about 1.5 hours to go through the whole museum but we did speed up a bit and not look at every single detail. If you are the type that wants to see everything, then it'll probably take about 3 hours. $20/person + $1/hour for parking on weekdays.

It brought me right back to when I was 6 years old seating on my Grandmother's floor, staring up at the TV mesmerized by \"Ferdinand the Bull\" or the \"Grasshopper and the Ants\" or, my favorite, \"The Old Mill.\"\n\nIf you are a fan of Walt Disney this is a must-see!  The museum is broken down into periods of Disney's life from childhood to his untimely passing.  It was interesting to see his ups and downs, perseverance, and eventual rise as the creator of \"The Happiest Place On Earth.\" Not only does the museum highlight Disney as the entrepreneur but also as a family man and loved employer.  It goes without saying, you'll probably learn something you never knew about this American icon.  \n\nHowever, I would caution those with kids, if you're expecting \"Disneyland\" this isn't it...it really is a museum and it takes a while to look through all the exhibits so be prepared for restlessness in your youngsters.", "author": "Amber G."}

Why don't you do some reading about the place before going? It's non-profit, it's going to be pricey. It's the WALT DISNEY FAMILY museum, not the MICKEY MOUSE museum; it's Walt's life from beginning to end. Right there you should realize that it's most likely not a place for little kids. Someone said you could do the museum in an hour if you don't like reading everything -- then what's the point of even going? It's hard to swallow that ignorant people like that were even able to find the place or even know how to setup a Yelp account.\n\nNow that I have that out of my system, I can begin my review. Disney enthusiasts beware!!! Give yourself 3 hours or more to see the entire exhibit -- I'm not exaggerating. I went in twice giving myself 2 1/2 hours each time and I STILL haven't had the chance to read everything. You are overwhelmed with so many amazing facts about Walt and his life!\n\nThe staff are incredibly courteous. They are always letting guests know that they'll happily answer any questions about that content. I've overheard some of the conversations guests have had with them and you can tell they are real Disney enthusiasts which is great to know.\n\nI learned a lot about Walt's life and everything that lead up to the creation and success of Mickey Mouse among other amazing achievements. There are some items in the museum I couldn't believe they had! Early sketches, really old merchandise, and much more. I must warn my fellow Disney enthusiasts one more time: the ending will make you cry.\n\nThere's a nice little gift shop at the end with lots of great goodies. Next to it is a little cafe as well. The museum even has a little theatre downstairs where they show all kinds of classics. Today they were showing Lady and the Tramp. They also have various events going on throughout the month so check their calendar. On Valentine's Day I saw that they had some kind of wine and movie thing going on -- pretty sweet, huh?! An excellent place to bring a date -- you have a marvelous view of the Golden Gate Bridge. I've been twice so far and I'll be coming more often. Maybe I should become a member?\n\nP.S. $20 regular admission or $15 with student ID. Parking is free and there's tons of it in their lot. Have fun!", "author": "Jonny A."}

I can definitely see why the museum has chose to put an hour and fifteen minute buffer before close (where most museums cut off at about half an hour prior to close) as navigating the exhibit space takes a great deal of time.\n\nThe WDFM is in a very scenic location, but it IS a hassle to get to. Public transit drops you off about 5 minutes away but only if you are in a part of the city where the 43 Masonic or 29 Sunset is nearby. \n\nOccasionally you can take the \"Presidigo\" from the gate, but that depends on the time of day and the shuttle driver.\n\nNow, as to the actual museum? It is a very INFORMATIVE museum, with lots of old relics, photos, and excerpts about Walt's life. It felt very old time-y in the first gallery; senior groups must LOVE this place. I felt a bit uncomfortable with all those vacant flapper eyes starrin' at me from the video screens.\n\nAs an animation geek and illustrator, I got a kick out of all the production art and sketches you find further along into the galleries.\n\nWe also played an interactive musical game where you try to replicate the soundtrack from Steamboat Willie.\n\nI was still feeling overwhelmed when we got to the back of the building, where you can use the restroom (Nicest restroom ever. SERIOUSLY, it was immaculate). Following the restrooms there is a large glass wall, with a great view of the GG Bridge and the floor is done up all shiny and modern. Then you get the coolest part, which I won't spoil totally, but the theme is EPCOT. Super cool model city in there. \n\nAfter that the museum gets a little creepy, with the white walls, crying Mickey Mouses, political cartoons-- everything following Walt's Death. We made our way out after a few minutes of that. \n\n\nI might come back, but I'd want to go with a Disney Enthusiast who would get more out of the trek to the Presidio. Or just to use those nice, nice bathrooms.", "author": "Adora S."}

Sounds like there isn't much right? WRONG! There are SO MANY ROOMS! Especially upstairs!! So, give yourself some time to look through it. My sister and I took 2 hours and we ended up having to rush at the end because we had to make dinner reservations. \n\n2) The more \"interesting\" stuff is at the end...well at least for most people. I was completely fascinated by the first few rooms because I love learning more about Walt Disney. My sister was upset by the fact that we wasted so much time in the first rooms and didn't get to really look at the end. What's at the end? More information on Disneyland!!  The beginning is the history, then about his career progression and then finally Disneyland and Disney world/epcot plans. \n\n3) This is not really for children. There are parts they will find entertaining but overall it isn't really geared towards kids. Plus, how are you supposed to enjoy it if your kid is constantly pushing you from room to room. I think other patrons would also be happy to have you leave the kids at home. I heard a couple people say (in response to a particularly annoying child), \"Ugh, why do people bring kids to these things?\"\n\nLook at the yelp pictures and you'll see that they feature a mini mock up of Disneyland. This of course isn't the actual Disneyland you see today but you can see some old rides that they used to have!\n\nLook up directions cause getting to this place can be tricky, especially for tourists!\n\nOverall I loved it!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-04-15", "description": "Wow. I think, absolutely one of the best museums in the Bay Area. Heck, California, USA.\n\nWhile I am a Disney fan, I felt this museum had something for most people over the age of 13 or so. Whether you're a creative, a film buff, a historian, a techie or a Disneyphile, there's at least a few galleries, if not all, that would entertain and hold your attention.\n\nI loved the wonderful details in the exhibits which follow the life of Walt Disney, showcasing his highlights and even a low-light or two. The amount of thought in creating this journey for the viewer is pretty neat when you realize that the museum is truly and thoughtfully designed for you, the visitor. \n\n***Warning: Minor Spoilers Ahead***\n\nThe beginnings of Walt's life is a simple narration from an old recording of his voice but is elevated by a lively animation. And just below the LCD screen, a little train quietly chugs by in a long, horizontal, glass window. Lovely! For those hard of hearing - like me - there's closed captioning available at many of the stations. \n\nAs a whole, the space is well-designed, guiding you into the different spaces chronologically. There's still freedom to move organically (and sit here and there.) The galleries are warm and inviting and it's a fully immersive environment to support the gallery content.\n\nThere's always something to play with your visual, hearing and tactile senses. Recordings from those associated with Walt (adding great personalization) are available and galleries with different medias to explore: videos, phone handsets, techie hands-on stations, short films, photographs, ephemera, original concept art, collector's items, maquettes, replicas, models and more. There's originality like visiting a mini-projected Dick Van Dyke hanging out on an Optical Printer - and he'll explain to you about that Disney-invented technology.\n\nNot only is the content and technology diverse but the manner in how they draw you in can be sincerely surprising and inspiring. I ate up a lot of time viewing a library of digital imagery that encompassed a vast number of subjects. They've projected an interactive interface on a ledge that allows you to choose topics spanning from A to almost Z. For Mary Blair fans there is a satiating amount of work showcased in the form of digital imagery (under several different subject headings) and original concept art. \n\nAnother highlight is the 20 ft diameter model of the original Disneyland. You approach it first from an ariel view and then are able to get closer and peek into it at an eye level if you're okay with crouching down. If you look into Tomorrowland they even drew in the detail of Mary Blair's original murals that once lived there.\n\nThere's lovely thought in adding emotion to the galleries, like the announcement of Walt Disney's death. A carefully designed display is built, honoring how one would have heard the news in 1966. I think because of this, many people are surprised at how moved they are when encountering this section (as some of the Yelpers here have expressed.) And as you are carried along after hearing and reading about his passing, they symbolically and elegantly remind you that Walt's legacy lives on. \n\nFor a detailed listing of technological specs and gallery subjects, you can read up here:\nhttp://www.e-architect.co.uk/san_francisco/walt_disney_family_museum.htm", "author": "Thanh T."}

The first official gallery is about his childhood. It takes you chronologically. Do not expect to see information about \"The Little Mermaid\" or Pixar. The museum reminds attendees that Disney(R) was not always the billion-dollar juggernaut it is today. Walt had triumphs like Mickey Mouse and Snow White but also failures, and failures that would later be considered successes.\n\nThe museum attempts to tell Walt's story through as much of Walt's words and images as possible. There are dozens of televisions and telephones throughout the museum with the voice of Walt and his family and artists. \n\nThe museum is laid out beautifully. There is a lot of video, original artwork, props, models, and collectibles sure to make the biggest Disney salivate. In addition, the museum displays many of Walt's personal effects, home movies and photographs. My favorite parts of the museum are the walkway in which viewers are inundated with animation from post-WWII, and the gallery highlighting Disneyland, with an impressive animated model of the park, television, and the World's Fair. Many guests skip over the display of a large special camera towards the end of this gallery. Be sure to pick up the receiver and watch a miniature Dick Van Dyke explain it to you.\n\nI agree with another attendee that this is not a Disneyland attraction. Although there are a lot of familiar characters and interactivity, some children may find it boring. There is a lot of information to soak in here that will likely educate even the most informed Disney fan. Depending on how much you want to soak up, it is possible to spend hours here reading and looking. The museum costs $20 for the average adult. It behooves one spend a lot of time for this price.\n\nOn a personal note, one of my favorite Disney artists is heavily featured throughout the museum. This is Mary Blair, best known for the flat, colorful, graphic, playful work that inspired much of \"Three Caballeros\" and \"it's a small world.\" I enjoy seeing her original work, the bottom floor inspired by IASW concept art, and prints of some of her pieces in the museum gift shop.", "author": "Amanda H."}

One thing you find is that Walt and the Walt Disney Company are impossible to fully distinguish from one another.\n\nThe whole museum flows similarly to a Disney attraction. Your preload area is big and bright and adorned with little bits of eye candy. Just like a Disney attraction you can also see the gift shop from the preload. \n\nBiggest thing to note: no pictures allowed! Yeah, this comes from aforementioned fusion between man and company. The Walt Disney Company has nothing to do with this place and, therefore, makes no money from it. Since they are not making any money from your memory making excursion, you must keep your memories the old fashioned way. Between your ears and behind the eyes.\n\nThe museum starts with Walt's story from before he was alive and ends, kind of morbidly, with his death. It is packed with artifacts and multimedia displays. Many of which come from the Disney family or the Disney Company vaults. The big finish before the total bummer (death bits) is a classic Disney move: giant model of Disneyland.\n\nFor more animation minded folk: you can skip virtually the whole first section and the last section. The gooey middle has your fix. Spend time with Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. Mickey's older and way more awesome brother. He will buy you beer if your underage (that cool).\n\nDo not take kids. Please. If your kid sucks (be honest with yourself here okay?) and has more in common with Victorian glazed bricks keep them tied to a tree out back. This place is for the older set, both in mind and vintage. However, they do run a movie series here and it could be the only time you or your child(ren) will see a  Disney classic on the silver screen.\n\nThe gift shop is sorry. Nothing of value or interest really, but it is not their fault. Again, since Walt and the Walt Disney Company are stuck like glue, they can only sell Disney stuff that the Disney Company approves.\n\nDespite the negatives, you run into kindred walking through and I spent an hour talking with a dear old lady that was a secretary in the Ink & Paint department in 1956.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-21", "description": "Located in a remodeled building in the Presidio with stunning views of the Bay and Golden Gate Bridge, the Walt Disney Family Museum is more of a history and celebration of Walt Disney, the man himself, and not necessarily of the Disney corporation. Parents should bear this in mind when thinking about taking the kids, as those looking to catch a glimpse of Selena Gomez, Zack and Cody, and London Tipton paraphernalia will be sorely disappointed. Also, be sure to inform the little ones that there are no rides or a giant Pooh or Mickey strolling around the premises.\n\nWhat we are treated to is a stunning collection of original drawings and inspirations of the incomparable Mr. Disney. It should be thought of as an educational experience rather than entertainment. The museum is broken up into about 10 rooms, each representing a certain phase in the development of the vaunted Disney brand, starting from the birth of the man who would become a legend, all the way until the day he took his last breath. As mentioned, any Disney related items post-Walt are not included, unless he specifically had a hand in it himself.\n\nThe best thing is that, unlike the actual Disneyland, parking is free and abundant. The exterior of the buiding is very non-descript, with no mouse ears or any of that pizazz and neon you would normally expect from a Disney production. You would never even know what this place was without checking the small sign up front.\n\nMy favorite Yelper and I were invited to a special \"soft opening\" on 9/20, so not everything was fully functional, but it seemed about 90% complete. We spent a little over two hours, but one could easily stay much longer, as we didn't necessarily take the time to read every single capsule or play with the interactive kiosks. We already had more than enough to keep us occupied. The normal rate is going to be $20, which is the typical of museums of this ilk, but for those on a budget, can be somewhat pricy, especially if adding up the costs for a family of 4 or more.\n\nHere are some of the highlights and general observations:\n\nTotally out of this world awesomeness:\n-Miniature replica of the original Disneyland, which is set up at the bottom of a long winding staircase, giving you a bird's eye view of all the rides and attractions. Even more impressive is that a few of the set pieces actually move, almost like an elaborate model train set. For the enclosed buildings, the roof has been removed to give a peek inside.\n\n-Allotted time slots for visitors. This helps a great deal with crowd control, especially since the layout is set up as one long queue instead of allowing everyone to roam freely. The ushers are also very polite and helpful, sporting the popular blue and gold Disneyland unis!\n\n-Collection of original marketing memorabilia. It's been said that in modern times, pop culture icons are oversaturated, appearing on everything from lunch pails to underwear to silverware. Heck, this isn't anything new. It all started back in the day with one famous little Mouse.\n\n-Actual frame by frame cells from the original animation. It takes at least 700 frames to produce less than one minute of video. Credit is also given to Walt Disney's associates and fellow animators, who were just as integral in the creation of characters and movies.\n\nCould use a little work:\n-Only two unisex bathrooms on the second floor for this huge facility. Even on a preview day, which was likely not to full capacity, there was a line at least 3-4 deep. I don't want to know how it would look on a holiday weekend when things are in full swing.\n\n-Gift shop is rather disappointing. I did walk away with a cool Mickey Mouse mug featuring raw animation sketches, but that was probably one of the few nifty things I saw. I'm not sure what type of licensing agreement they have with Disney itself, but there was NONE of the normal stuffed animals, magnets, keychains, pens, etc. you would find at Disneyland, or even the Disney store at Any Mall, USA. Instead, there is a plethora of random, non-Disney related items, such as bracelets, earrings, art books and drafting pencils. I guess this is intentionally done to further separate the museum as a place of learning rather than entertainment.\n\nUpon leaving the Walt Disney Family Museum, one can't help but be awed and inspired by the genius of Mr. Walt Disney. This was a man with a vision and unwordly talent, but above all, the determination to make the world better place. From all accounts, he has succeeded in his quest with flying colors. However, as great as he ended up being, the museum makes a point not to immortalize him, instead pointing out his failed business ventures when starting out, and his struggles when first arriving in Hollywood dealing with upscrupulous distributors taking advantage of his unbelievable skills. The rest, as they say, is history...\n\nCome witness this amazing history for yourself starting October 1, 2009!", "author": "Eric W."}

I love  disneyana but i'm not that hardcore to subscribe to D23 or go to conventions. the red brick building is unassuming as with all the buildings in the presidio . once you walk pass the glass case containing all the Oscar awards Walt Disney won especially the Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs with the mini Oscars WOW!!!  \nthe museum is very modernistic with the interactive features  making it an all sensory overload of pictures and sound. there is a lot of things to read and I took my 6.5 year old son who wanted to run & climb the displays. it's not a good place for young children b/c there's a lot of stuff I couldn't read b/c I had to keep an eye on him. My favourite thing was the miniature Disneyland with moving parts one word AWESOME!!!I would recommend as other posters to spend at least 2 to 3 hours to look and READ everything. wear comfortable shoes and bring something to drink & snack for later. they have a gift shop and caf\u00e9 with Disneyland prices HIGH!!!\n\nsadly i found out Walt Disney's daughter Diane recently passed away. I learned she co-founded the museum. I can see the love she put into the museum: it is a beautiful wonderful tribute to her father.\n there is a  letter toward the end of the tour about her father's passing that brought tears to my eyes and other people who read it. thank you for this beautiful museum a testament of the wonderful imagination of her father!!!", "author": "Jo K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-10-26", "description": "On this past Sunday I met up with a Disney friend from LA and two of his good friends for what turned out to be a very full day at the Mecca of Disney geekatude, the Walt Disney Family Museum. I thought couple of hours and then lunch and then home to relax the remainder of the Sunday afternoon away. I was wrong, we got there at 11, broke for brunch (word to the wise, avoid La Terasse, it's barely passable, that review is elsewhere) and then back to the museum until closing time, 6pm. \n\nI neither saw everything nor absorbed everything, but what I saw was truly, truly amazing.  The WDFM is a project not of Disney in Burbank (though I am guessing some items shown are from Disney Burbank and I suspect the Disney Archive, too), but many personal items courtesy Diane Disney Miller and Disney Family. The mission, in a nutshell, is to bring this story back to the beginning and show who Walt Disney was and what he accomplished. They succeed in this 110%. \n\nThe WDFM is beautifully laid out in a repurposed building in the Presidio and comprises 10 galleries encompassing Walt's life, his achievements. In the lobby are the awards (including the very cool Snow White special Academy Award which I never thought I'd see, it's really quite huge). \n\nIn the lobby, before you enter the first gallery is a reproduction of a portion of Walt's apartment at the Firehouse in Disneyland. The lamp was on, but as my Disney geek friend commented to me, they should have had a photograph behind the window showing the view down Main Street behind the sheer curtains. I agree, that is one cool touch they could add. Anyone listening? \n\nYou really do need to pace yourself, the mind exploding stuff increases with so much incredible stuff as you move from gallery to gallery. It is all beautifully presented. I would really recommend this to be a 2 day trip. \n\nI had the real pleasure to make my first visit to the WDFM with my friend who is a real Disneyphile and this made the experience extra super special. He has so much knowledge and we spent what had to be a full 90 minutes looking at and examining closely the Disneyland model, alone. That was mind-bending, the Disneyland of my childhood. The model is amazingly detailed and to get the story behind some of the things shown in this model was a real treat. Let me mention here the WDFM staff are super friendly and all do seem to realize they work in a very special environment. \n\nDo not miss this when you come to SF. So many of the exhibits are very interactive and fun. Not merely geared to the kids, it's for the kid in all of us. Extreme nostalgia factor. It's all laid out beautifully, designed fabulously. The attention to detail in the presentation, is so great, loads of little touches. In gallery 5, Fantasia, Pinnochio and Bambi, there is an animator's table reproduced, on the desk is a radio, of course the narrative is coming from the radio. Awesome little details like this are sprinkled throughout. It was, quite simply, one of the most exciting museums I've ever been to. \n\nMy special moments of geek, the display from the Ink & Paint Department, a wall of bottles of Technicolor cell paints from the studio. Still bright as Technicolor! To stand above and at the multiplane camera (in the gift shop, we got to push buttons, nothing worked but it was SO cool) there is a background painting from Bambi on the glass (I'm sure a repro, but the effect is as if the camera would be working right now). To see some original Eyvind Earle (sp?) concept art on Sleeping Beauty and Mary Blair concept paintings on Peter Pan that were just astonishingly beautiful. Again, the model, the model of Disneyland. \n\nA special moment of geekness for me, on display an AtomMobile from the Mighty Microscope from the defunct Monsanto Adventure Thru Inner Space (it was my favorite ride as a young kid, might have had something to do with it being cool in there, but I was and still am a science geek). Also, in the Disneyland Model among many wonderful things, Adventure Thru Inner Space back where it belongs.  \n\nThen, you are hit in the gut and brought back to reality as you come to the end of Walt's life. It was quite sobering, emotional and affecting. You are brought fully to the realization of how much Walt Disney did and what a creative force he was. The last room is what I would call a slice of heaven to ease you out of the shock of Gallery 10. A fabulous looping video of Walt, quotes by and about him and photos of so much work he produced and inspired. I'm paraphrasing, but the quote from Rolly Crump summed it up for me. \"He called us His Geniuses, but we were inspired because he believed in us.\" A great way to end the day and a great summation of who Walt Disney was. \n\nPhotography is NOT allowed.   Awesome, not to be missed if you know or love anything about Disney.  This brought it all home to me.", "author": "Donna H."}

I've always been very fond of the Disney classics and wanted to take my 13 year old daughter to see what I thought would be some cool sketches of some of his original creations...We found this and a whole lot more.  I was very impressed to find a truly excellent museum that was very well laid out and very detailed without being dry.  Wtih each room we entered I went one direction and my daughter another --both stopping along the way to point out exhibits of interest.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-11-22", "description": "The Walt Disney Family Museum tells two histories. It provides visitors with an in depth, creative and cool walk through the life and imagination of Walt Disney himself. At the same time it also lays out an interesting educational look into the early years of animated shorts. \n\nThis museum is chalked full of interactive exhibits allowing visitors that opportunity to hear audio commentary for early illustrators, employees from the Disney studio color lab and actors. There also exercises in matching music to character and sound effects to soundtrack. \n\nIntertwined in the history of Disney's empire, is the story that is the birth and growth of Disney's own family. Lilly Disney and the couple's two daughters along with their families are all represented here. It is really a touching tender and intimate look at the man behind the far reaching Disney culture. \n\nSome of the most memorable points of interest for me: \n\n- Disney Studio's work during WWII -- some of the signs and poster art displayed are entertaining! Image Donald Duck warning bugs to stay out of the victory garden and Mickey Mouse throwing gunk in the der Fuhrer's face!! \n- The expansive model of early Disneyland! It's amazing how much of the original is still there! \n- Video footage introducing, \"It's a Small World.\" \n- Video explaining animatronics used to manufacture a display where Abe Lincoln appears on stage and gives talks to visitors at the NY World Fair and during the early days of Disneyland. It is positively creepy!! We're talking Honest Abe giving talks from the grave!! \n- A photo of Mr. Disney with the first two children to ever enter Disneyland. \n- An entire wall (and it is a long wall) of editorial cartoons and telegrams expressing the grief and sadness over the Mr. Disney's death. Very touching!! \n\nThis museum will make you nostalgic for your childhood, inspire you to use your imagination and touch your heart. What an amazing legacy!! \n\nNOTE: Despite the Disneyland connection and the great vestige to childhood, I do not recommend taking young kids here. Our kindergartener had a very hard time holding attention or interest. Many of the topics were technically and emotionally beyond his grasp. Our eight-year-old however, was fascinated by most of what she saw.", "author": "Kristine D."}

I was pleasantly surprised though, that they managed to fit sooooo much about the beloved Walt Disney and his craft inside that little bunker building at the Presidio. There were a few kinks here and there, but for a soft opening, I thought it went fabulously well. I loved learning about the earlier Disney productions and hearing more about the man behind the magic. Some real sketches were also available to see as were collections of Mickey Mouse paphernilia, including the \"Mouse Getar\" HAHAHA...the precourser to Guitar Hero? :)\n\nThe entire museum was well laid out but there was so much to see! I did get teary eyed at the end, where it has some info on Disney's death - how could i not? Definitely a great man, who led the way for animated cartoons and film, and definitely a pioneer. \n\nThere's plenty of parking and a cafe as well. The gift store was alright - seemed like a total mishmash of random items...the only gripe i really had was the bathrooms...only two single unisex bathrooms at the 2nd level. Didn't know if there were any at the bottom, but didn't seem so. \n\nRegular priced admission is about 20 a head (I think)...people who really want to learn about Disney will have a great time here. The exhibits are fun and interactive and definitely kid friendly.

This museum is dedicated to the I whole life of Walt Disney and it truly does take several hours to get the most out of the exhibits.  I would say it is more of an adult oriented experience since it covers his early life and his business dealings extensively, though certainly there are exhibits that kids would find interesting.  I also enjoyed seeing the special exhibit on Snow White though wasn't expecting a track to an outlying building to view it.  Again, it was interesting to see the production notes on the artwork and the final cells from the film, but kids might give it a yawn.  On the other hand, the ones that were there seemed to be having a good time so who knows, depends on your kids tolerance for non-interactive entertainment.\n\nMy only complaint, and its not really the museums fault, but following the directions on their website I ended up getting lost because of some street closures in the Presidio.

I also liked this one station where we could play a game where we match a tune to the animation. I was dancing while playing the game. There were a few interactive stations, but most of them were just for looking/reading/observing. Some displays have audio phones/headphones/speakers for you to listen to. Do not forget to stop by the multi-plane camera section to listen to the audio. It's a short audio clip, but that camera is RADICAL, DUDE!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-08", "description": "If you are a fan of the man, or even if you are a bit skeptical of his foresight and courage, then this museum will eliminate the doubt about Walt Disney being a true pioneer in American entertainment.  Things we take for granted today, theme parks, animated movies, character merchandising, never existed until this man paved the way.  Imagine everyone in your closest circles telling you your greatest dreams will never work, that they will ruin you.  What would you do?  Disney forged ahead, and in room after room you understand how innovative and ahead of his time he really was.  Tons and tons of archival video and audio, replicas of Disney attractions and memorabilia, and the most poignant stuff has nothing to do with the movies and parks.  It has to do with the family that inspired Walt to create Disneyland in the first place.  Pictures, video and never before seen home movies of Walt Disney, as always, acting like the big kid he always was. Telegrams tell the not-so flattering story of Disney's animators strike and the fights with the men that tried to ruin him and his brother financially.  There is very little sugar coating of Disney until the very end where his death is reflected upon by quotes and cartoon snippets as classical music plays softly in the background.  There was a lot of love put into this museum, and the attention to detail shows in the pieces collected, the knowledge and helpfulness of the staff, and the importance with which this museum memorializes a man that for better or worse, changed the shape of pop culture forever.  If you enjoy anything Disney, movies, theme parks, cruises, then you will learn more than you thought, but you will come away with a much better appreciation of the risk-takers that were Walt Disney and his under-appreciated brother Roy (without him, Walt Disney World would neither have had a name or kept the vision of what it is today).

So if those facts give you reason to shrug off my five star rating and look for another opinion by all means please move one. \n\nHowever, this is one of the most impressive museums I have ever visited. In fact the Walt Disney Family Museum might be more enjoyable for people who are rather indifferent about Disney. \n\nIf you are a fan of the Academy Awards and have never seen a real Oscar you need to visit WDFM. This is the only place in the world where you can see multiple Oscars and the infamous Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Oscar that Walt Disney received for his ground breaking work on his classic feature length animated film. \n\nIf you are a fan of the history of animation then WDFM is your Mecca. You get to see the evolution of animation from crude flip books to full color stereophonic productions. \n\nI fully expected to see a lot of drawings and old photos of Walt but I was pleasantly surprised how much of the museum was dedicated to the technological side of animation. There is a Foley setup where you get to try synchronizing sound effects to Steamboat Willie. And best of all there is a full scale multiplane camera on display that is almost two stories tall. Definitely a major display for animation geeks and historians. \n\nThe last few galleries were my favorite part of the museum. I was in awe of the scale model of Disneyland. It was about 20 feet in diameter and had so much detail that I spent at least 20 minutes looking at it from every possible angle. It was particularly fascinating because it wasn't a model of a particular time in Disneyland's history but a representation of what Walt envisioned Disneyland to grow into. Seeing some of the old rides like the Flying Saucers and Adventures Thru Inner Space was really neat. \n\nThe museum ends with a very touching display of political cartoons depicting the world's reaction to the Walt's death in 1966. Growing up in Orange County I always thought Walt was a local hero but seeing how the rest of the planet reacted to his passing really showed how great of a man he was. \n\nAllow plenty of time for this museum.

This place is best enjoyed by people bewitched by the cult of Disney (the man himself, not necessarily the corporation & its often not-great output of today) and is definitely a must-see for folks who love Hollywood history.  Through Disney's story you can also learn a lot about the golden age of studio filmmaking - from those early experimental 'let's try just about anything' days to the struggles of staying afloat during WWII all the way to 'how do we get them back into the movie theater?' vibe of the 60s. Anaheim Disneyland fans will ooh and ahh at the perfect little replica of the park as it was the day it opened.  \n\nSet aside an un-rushed 3 hours to really enjoy every corner of this museum, and don't expect a lot of signs in the Presidio to show you the way.

I took the family and kids to check it out on a fine Sunday afternoon. The wait to get in was not long at all and while the staff is still green, they were very knowledgeable and helpful in answering questions. \n\nThe museum is divided into 8 different sections and prior to entering the first section, you'll find yourself in the main lobby, surrounded by Mr. Disney's numerous Awards and Accolades. As you venture through the building, each room devotes itself to one specific period of Mr. Disney's life, beginning with his childhood. \n\nThe first room is all about the Disney family history, wedding certificates, baptisms and the like. As you journey on, you'll interact with recordings of Mr. Disney via telephones or other various modes of media. When you get to about the sixth section or so, you will notice the amazing contraption engineered by Disney studios to create life like camera work. This was best explained in Bambi where the camera almost \"walks beyond the trees\". \n\nTowards the end, before you walk into section 7, there is a hallway with one side comprised of windows...on a good day, you can see an AMAZING view of the Golden Gate Bridge and parts of the Presidio. Follow that hallway down and you'll see a miniature replica of Disney world, learn of the trials and tribulations in building the magic kingdom and all the modern technologies placed into Mr. Disney's dream world. \n\nThe last part was the saddest part of all as we go through the death of Walt Disney. You leave the place feeling utterly somber. \n\nWhen you are finally done with the tour, you can complete your visit with a stop at the gift shop. \n\nOverall, the kids really enjoyed the (limited) interactive play but the older folks really appreciated the historical value which is really what this museum is about. Personally though, I think the kids would have much rather gone to Disneyland and the Museum would be best for teens or older.", "author": "Monlia W."}

First off, there is A LOT of reading involved- bring your reading glasses!  This is a museum about Walt, his life, family, and the history of his career and the Disney company.  I was hoping to see more Disney stuff actually, and I think a kid would too.  My impression after I left was that it was historical and interesting, and my boyfriend or anyone else interested in the production of film would also like it a lot.  My interest began to fade out towards the end but was piqued again with the Disneyland model which was really cute.  Again, I just didn't see the kids really having themselves a ball at the museum itself, except I did see them enjoying the hands-on activity room where they had some projects set up for them.  Honestly, I think this was the only place kids seemed most interested and engaged.  I think the Walt Disney museum is more something that my grandfather would have loved if he was still here.  The older generation of visitors I saw really seemed to be the ones who were enjoying it the most.  I think this museum would make a perfect outing if you have grandparents visiting and need something quiet to do in SF where there is not a lot of walking involved, is handicap friendly, and lots of history on the legendary man Walt Disney.", "author": "Alexandra P."}

This museum chronicles the life of Walt Disney from the human man, not the mogul or corporation we all associate with the name  \"Disney\" (come on admit it- when you hear the name, you think of the company, not Walt).\n\nThis museum houses the answers to every conceivable question you could ever have about Walt- his family- his life (I had always wondered where the name \"Disney\" originated) and more. We were in the museum for 2.5 hours and we will need to go back because we sort of rushed from the 8th gallery through the 10th.\n\nI am super happy that the Presidio was chosen to house this fountain of knowledge and information. Most of the galleries are narrated by Walt himself and it is very cool~ it gives him an immortal air (let's face it, would you trust anyone else to take you through the Disney families History?). This is WHY the museum needed to be separate and apart  from the parks- this was the DISNEY FAMILY HISTORY (and it just happened to INCLUDE DISNEYLAND not the other way around). \n\nAlthough there are many interactive stations that are fun for everyone, and there are plenty of cartoons around it is appropriate for families however I am not sure I would bring someone under 7, because there is a lot of museum and they get bored after about 1 and a half hours (but hey! If your child has the attention span- they will have a blast).\n\nThe next to last gallery is Disneyland (and you thought that was all Disney did- shame on you!). It is breathtaking with the actual model Disney used to present to the banker's to fund Disneyland (\"Walt's Folly- my butt, I wish I had a folly half as popular!).\n\nThe last gallery, is the radio announcement of Walt's death and the outpouring of support to his family. I got weepy and my sister dragged me through with the promise of the gift shop.\n\nThe gift shop is great with a good balance of all priced merchandise, and the cafe's coffee smelled great.

It was fantastic.  One step inside reminds you that the Disney folks do things so beautifully.  (By the way, this museum is not from the Disney entertainment corporation -- it is run by the Disney Family Foundafion.)  The decorations and presentations were beautiful and clever and done with a lot of entertainment and wit.\n\nWe did not have advance entry tickets, by the way.  We showed up on a weekday afternoon in summer and had no difficulty getting in.  There were a few people wandering around but there were no crowds at all.\n\nWe were impressed that upon entry, you go up an elevator to the top level, and then as you make your way through each room (following Walt's life chronologically) you wind down a gently sloping path and end up down at the first floor again.  No steps to go down, never a sensation of having to climb up or down stairs.  It felt effortless and seamless.\n\nThe exhibits were wonderfully animated so even if you are not the type to scrutinize exhibits and read the descriptive cards, you get a clear and entertaining story of how Walt's life unfolded ... Most often, from Walt's own lips as he talks about various events.  It was great fun to see the original papers behind the Disney mark on animation and television and movie history: early Micky Mouse sketches, the letter Walt wrote to Julie Andrews about her playing in Mary Poppins, etc.  \n\nWe LOVED the model of Disneyland  and could have looked at that for hours. It's delightful.\n\nWhile I think this museum is more suited to adults, there is much for kids to enjoy and the animations will keep them interested.  There is a small cafe where one can buy fruit, simple snacks and drinks, and a lovely porch with chairs and tables outside.  There are also, apparently, different films and events featured from time to time that may require special ticketing.  None were running when we were there.  Parking is free and abundant.  \n\nIt was a well-spent 2 hours and $20, and we came away with a new understanding of how profoundly Walt Disney affected animation, tv and movies, the theme park industry, and our popular culture.", "author": "Diane H."}

Like the Picasso museum in Paris, this one tells the story chronologically and gives you both the how and why Disney did things.  If you have read a good Disney biography you may find there isn't a whole lot of new info, which is surprising since the museum was put together by his family.  Regardless, the story is well told with a bounty of artifacts.  I was particularly struck by the earliest known drawing of Mickey Mouse.  \n\nMy complaints are petty.  The staff wear purple uniforms which would be right at home in a Disney park, but this is not a Disney park.  Others have complained that some rooms in the building were small.  I didn't really notice or mind.  I did notice that the museum sort of ends with a whimper, though.  You leave the largest gallery through a small, nondescript door into a small room that is the final room and that's it.  The subject and content of the final room is moving but the physical space is not.  For a showman like Walt it seems a bit anticlimactic.\n\nIf you are a bone-fide Disney nut-job (like me) you will be very happy and satisfied.

I ordered tickets online and printed them out at home and we showed up in the morning right during opening time at 10AM. We got our tickets scanned, hand stamped for re--entry and then we were off into the world of Walter Disney. \n\nThis place is really a biography of Walt Disney himself and from the first room to the last you get an experience of what his life was about. There's a room that describes his ancestors and how they came to be, pictures, everything. Then it goes into the life of young Walt, and how he came to do what he did. In different \"sections\" you get to watch interactive videos with Walt Disney himself narrating what is going on. \n\nYou experience the rises and falls of his career and then how films and songs came to be. Then everything slowly pieces together with his vision of Disneyland and how he became inspired with it.  All along the way, family pictures and candids of him and his family are framed on the walls. One thing that really cracked me up was a list of his \"favorite things to eat\" that he wrote down and gave to his housekeeper to prepare which apparently was later found in an old magazine in the housekeepers' quarters.\n\nAlthough I came here with my girlfriend, not a lot of conversation took place. That's not necessarily a bad thing, because we were both fixated on all the exhibits and reading the articles that were attached to each. A lot of reading is to be done here, and to capture it all, may take more than just one visit, but even if you do just come just once, you'll leave with an appreciation for the man who let us know that you're never too old to have a heart like a child", "author": "Derrick L."}

It's Disney.  Do you feel bad when you eat a chocolate Santa?  You do?  Oh...you don't eat chocolate because it's bad for you.  Cool..go plan your next low-investment/high profit margin rave that is neither licensed nor permitted under current zoning regulations.  Don't forget to sell $3 bottles of water, not pay taxes or permit fees, pocket the proceeds and then bitch about why the economy is so bad.\n\nGoing to keep reading?  Feel that burning situation in the pit of your stomach?  It's called reality.\n\nDisney is one of the original rebels.  An amazing risk taker who got screwed many times by people who profited off of his vision because he was too romantic to hire an attorney to read  contracts.\n\nI've read many biographies on this guy.  A lot of them were insightful and provided new information.  Some of them could have been written by anybody who had read others or had a decent internet connection.  Some of them were outright fabrications (I'm looking at YOU, \"Hollywood's Dark Prince\").  \n\nWhat surprised me here was how much of this exhibit is relayed in Walt's own words.  The mystery of the man appears to be based on protective custody of footage and voice recordings.  But this museum is funded by the Disney family.  They have that footage.  They have those recordings.  And they use them here.\n\nOne walks from display to display and gets to hear Walt's own voice and watch interviews where he explains where he was at, where the company was at, where society was at, when it happened.  From Chicago to Missouri, to Kansas, to World War I, back to frikkin' Kansas (and bankruptcy) and then to Hollywood.  He talks about how he lost his (and Ub Iwerks') creation Oswald the Lucky Rabbit to Mintz (along with Iwerks) due to poor business acumen.  He talks about how he lost out on a year of profits due to Pat Powers' (Cinephone) unethical business practices.  This guy got steamrolled by corporate thefts more times than any small technology startup out there and he kept going.  He kept true to his vision because he believed it could be better.  It also sort of explains why the Disney empire is so protective of their property.\n\nYou rebels still reading?  When you give up and cut your hair in order to get that job you just took the step Walt wasn't willing to.  Go back to planning that next rave now.  I think there is an abandoned factory in the outer mission that you might be able to swing a deal with.  Please pick up the broken glass before you start charging people a $20 'donation' to go take drugs and dance.\n\nBack to Walt.\n\nSo you get the idea that he narrates a good portion of his visions nascent years.  He narrates perhaps 70% of the entire museum tour.  Many of the original \"Nine Old Men\", Walt's inner-circle, are interviewed  as well as inkers, animators, and family members.\n\nThe displays are amazing.  If you're the type of person who could spend a year going to the Smithsonian and standing in awe at original sketches and artifacts from history this place will leave tears in your eyes.  Shut up.  I know Karate.  Most of the displays are related to the business of Disney, but many are related to the man himself.  Everything from watches to letters.  One of my favorites was a display of Walt's beloved miniatures collection.  My least favorite exhibit was some stupid interactive 'hot spot' projection display where you touch an image projected on a Formica table and it brings up something or other.  Perhaps I didn't give it enough time, but it was jumbled, confused, and way too random for me.  My absolute favorite display, the one which got me in trouble with Museum staff (how many of you saw that coming?) was Walt's miniature, ridable train.  According to the guy who chastised me soundly, this was not a reproduction...this was the actual train Walt got in trouble from Lilly with at his house.  According to some, this was the train that provided one of the inspirations for Disneyland.  A ride Walt had installed at his own house.  Yeah...I spent some time 'looking' at that.  The other display that truly took me aback was the scale model of Disneyland.  I could have done without the not-to-scale haunted mansion and pirates on top of their respective buildings, but I'm in real estate and like scaled models.  This one is pretty frikkin' awesome.\n\nIt is spendy.  Disney spendy.  I can do without that part, so reality does rear it's ugly head at the ticket counter and the gift shop.

We took a very bright 7-year-old and there just wasn't too much that kept him occupied. Although there was a neato Disneyland scale model and some cartoon clips that had him semi-interested, we had to keep our visit at about an hour and fifteen minutes because his attention span just couldn't hold out. Another warning: this museum is really about Walt Disney himself, and there really isn't much information about any Disney-related projects that occurred after Walt Disney's death in the mid-60's. \n\nAll that said, the museum was quite engaging and an interesting examination of the creative process. Say what you will about the current Disney empire, the guy really did take some risks and make some real creative leaps. For some reason I'd always thought that Fantasia was made in the 1960's (kind of a psychedelic thing) -- it was actually released much earlier; no one had really ever done anything like it before. \n\nI especially enjoyed seeing how \"one thing led to another\" -- for example, the Disney live-action nature documentaries were actually an offshoot of research that was done for \"Bambi\" -- in order to get the characters of Bambi as \"animal-like\" as possible, the artists studied live animals and footage of live animals; the footage later provided inspiration for the live-action flicks. \n\nProbably my favorite part of the museum was a clip of about 20 Disney artists sitting in a circle around a live deer, trying to get a feeling for what real deer do.  How much work and study they put into these 90-minute cartoons! \n\nBe aware that the restroom and eating facilities are limited.", "author": "Jen C."}

I admit I was a little hesitant to go because when I hear \"Disney\" I picture the toy store at the mall and themeparks.  But as others have written, this is a history of Walt, his family roots, how he got into the business, his successes and challenges.  There is tons of material, tons of exhibits with original art, artifacts, photos, and media; by the end we felt the $20 admission was well worth it.  We also visited the Mary Blair exhibit which was an extra $5 and wonderful.  Plan to spend at least 2 hours, more if you plan on watching a movie.  By the way, the day we were there we didn't think to confirm movie times when we bought tickets, and we found out later there would be none today due to a private event.

I've worked for the company for several years so was thrilled to get an inside look at the life of Walt. \n\nFirst off, this isn't really a museum for kids. There were definitely families there but the children looked bored and just kinda ran around. The museum is half dedicated to the life of Walt Disney (childhood photos, his personal sketches, family videos, telegrams he sent, etc.) and half dedicated to the founding years and evolution of The Walt Disney Company from the 1920's on. \n\nThere were HUNDREDS of original sketches, pieces of concept art, animation cels, etc. along with vintage products (ie: lunch boxes, figurines, watches, etc.), camera equipment, original movie posters, etc. I think the coolest part of the entire museum was a miniature, to-scale replication of Disneyland from when it first opened. \n\nWe only had about 2 hours to spend but I could have stayed a whole day. An absolutely stunning history of Walt Disney - a must see for anyone interested in the man and the company.", "author": "Erin O."}

This is the \"Walt Disney Family\" Museum, not the Walt Disney \"Family Museum\".  It was commissioned by his daughter, who lives in Northern California, apparently as a tribute to her father and his works.  His early interests and ongoing vision throughout his life comprise the message.  \n\nIt is really not child-friendly, but for those who appreciate a sense of the history of animation or of Disney himself, it is a remarkable presentation of his life and works.\n\nI visited with my wife, our son and his girlfriend, all fans of Disneyana to varying degree.  Personally, I found the influence of his creativity on other areas of cinema, media, technology and popular culture to be a revelation (despite what I thought I knew beforehand), and gained a new admiration for the man and what he endured during a career that spanned two world wars and beyond.  \n\nThere is definitely a lot of reading material throughout the exhibit, and one can spend the better part of a day there if you so desire.  I finished in around five hours, but if you skip some of the mutlimedia exhibits and are judicious about what you read, you may be able to do it in two.  Again, this is not really a kids' museum.  Rather, it is more of a well-stocked testament to the life, family and works of an icon of the 20th century whose legacy lives on well after his death.\n\nIf you are interested in the development of animation or in Disney himself, this is well worth the admission fee.  Diane Disney would be happy you enjoyed it.", "author": "Jeff B."}

There is a little kids studio area where they can do crafts. We went there first and found it very nice with kind staff. But when we went to the main exhibits I wasn't sure what the story was. I was with two three year olds who were very excited by many of the exhibits and would shout things like \"dumbo!\" and \"Mickey!\" And point excitedly at the scale model of Disneyland - \"Wow! What is that!????\" They were very happy and excited, and yes, louder that I would like but hey, kids love Disney. We just happened to be visiting at the same time as two grumpy women who gave us the stink eye at every opportunity and continually told our children to be quiet. When I told them to please stop they snapped \"This isn't a kids' park!\" Okay, point taken. But given that my children were happy and excited - not bratty or tantruming or climbing on the exhibits etc. I did not understand why their behavior was so inappropriate. This is, when you get down to it, a museum about a man who made children's films and cartoons.

All I can say about this museum is WOW!!  What a fantastic collection of items!  It all starts with a great assortment of awards that Walt won (including about 20 Oscars which was an amazing display in itself!).  Then you go through a door and the story of the man behind the mouse begins.  It literally starts with his baby picture and goes through his young life and up to his enjoyment of drawing when he served in the military.  After that, it takes you through his life as a fledgling cartoonist and the different ideas and businesses he tried to start.  Some failed, he got ripped off a few times, but he never ever lost his smile or the enthusiasm he had for his art and craft.  When he arrived in Hollywood and not one single movie studio would hire him, he was undaunted and opened his own studio.  This museum has pictures, movies, memorabilia (my favorite part...the tin toy Mickey Mouse's from the 30's) and telegrams/letters and that's just for starters.  I never saw a collection of such amazing items from anyone and in addition, it included items and stories about his wife Lillian and his daughters, Diane &  Sharon.  It was a true biography.  If you are expecting to take your kids there to have them dressed up in Princess outfits and your boys to don Mickey Mouse ears, take a flight to Disneyland.  This is NOT interesting to small children and honestly, I can't see young teens enjoying this either.  It's for a more mature audience wanting to see Walt Disney come to life via a bioigraphical museum.  I say GO!!   You will really enjoy it.  Prepare to spend 4 hours in there.  We did and I bet we only read or saw 60% of the items we could have read or watched.  You didn't know where to look first as there was so much memorabilia.  Terrific way to spend the morning or afternoon.  Snack bar too, at the end, if you get hungry.  For the price of $20, we learned so much.", "author": "Sandra P."}

This was down in the financial district and when a meeting was canceled, I hoped in a cab and $21 later I was at the Presidio at the Walt Disney Family Museum. And another $20 later I was looking at black and white family portraits of Walt's ancestors in room #1. \n\nThe museum may not be a part of Disney Corporation, but the sticker shock is eerily similar.  There is however, complimentary coat check in the basement, next to the women's restroom - convenient!\n\nThe exhibits are largely interactive and interesting to an adult audience. I saw a group of young school children being hurried through so perhaps they have special tours and activities for children. Mostly, on this Wednesday morning in early December, it was adult couples - a mix of Baby Boomers and Gen Xers. It took me about 3 hours to tour the museum and I didn't know about the theater so I only explored the 10 rooms, the cafe and the gift shop.\n\nUnlike a typical Disney-fan, I had no plans and no idea what to expect. I was largely pleased with my visit. The one thing I wish I had mentally prepared myself better for was that this is NOT Disneyland or Wald Disney World. I knew I was going to a museum, but I was going to a Disney Museum, so I thought. Basically I was expecting Cast Members - friendly, outgoing people who are ready to answer questions and be helpful. The staff were instead bored, over-educated museum staff. I actually don't know their education, they all just seemed like they had masters degrees from expensive universities in comparative religion and women's studies and were really disappointed in the turn their lives had taken.

However, some of Disney's works, including \"Fantasia\" and a slew of lovable, ageless, iconic characters deserve esteem.  \n\nAfter reading other reviews that this was a great museum for adults, we took the bait.\n\nWhat a thrill. In fact, while their interactive portions offer entertainment for children and adults alike, overall the entire museum could well just be for adults. The museum provided plenty of background history on Walt Disney, his family, the business from startup to success, and the \"making of...\" aspects that were undeniably fascinating.  Also give them credit for acknowledging the labor disputes that occurred at Disney. How many other museums gloss over or never bother to mention the 'trying' points in a company's history?  \n\nWhile the $20 adult admission may deter some, there are occasional offers.  We went earlier this year on a yelp summer offer for half off.  Goldstar also ran a promotion recently for Sunday and weekday admittance.  \n\nThe small cafe was buzzing and packed...we didn't try it, but since the Presidio does not have many other dining options around, it's a smart idea for them to have an onsite cafe.  \n\nGorgeous interior with plenty to keep one engaged.

I ended up working my way through college at Disneyland in the 70's and his memory was very much alive then.\n\nMention the name Walt Disney today and it seems that  most people think of the company and brand that bears his name, and maybe the statues in the theme park, but rarely do you hear much about Walt Disney the human being and that's just sad, because there is much than can be learned from his life. He was one of the truly great and defining figures of the 20th century.\n\nFor me, walking through the museum is like walking through Walt Disney's life.

As his life unfolds in chronological order,  you get a sense of who he really was, warts and all. The myth becomes very real. \n\nI'd suggest planning to spend at least 3 hours exploring the museum.

The museum tells the life story of Walt Disney. As such, the first third (or so) of the exhibit is devoted to Walt's childhood and early adult life. All the things you typically associate with Disney such as Mickey, the animated films, Disneyland, etc. don't appear until you reach the second floor. Even then, much of the focus is on Walt's family life and career. This is a museum of Walt Disney the man not Disney the entertainment empire. Because of this focus and the nature of the exhibits, I think many children would find it dull, at least for the first half. There's a lot of reading to be done to fully appreciate the exhibits and artifacts. Maybe there are docents for children's groups? Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend the museum for children under 10 or so.  As an adult, I found the museum very interesting and educational. My favorite parts were the elevator ride cleverly decorated to recreate Walt's train trip to Los Angeles and the huge model of Disneyland. (I want one!) My only real complaint about the exhibit is how it ends. There's a room about Walt's death and it's all very sad then... nothing. End of tour. How depressing! OK, so there's one last room with some video screens and a couple of quotes about Walt, but really that room should be devoted to the legacy of Walt, perhaps with a summary of all that Disney has done since, so visitors leave on a positive note rather than a downer. It seemed rather an odd design choice to me. The museum also contains a nice gift shop (not as overly \"Disney\" as you might expect) and a small cafe/snack bar.

It is indeed the history of the Disney family and Walt himself. You really get a feel of how Walt had a passion for drawing and art in general. He was man with a vision and put it on paper and brought it to life There is so much to see and read that 2 to 3 hours is needed to visit this place.\n\nI was amazed with the Disneyland model that they have inside the museum very detailed and it almost like you can see yourself walking down mainstreet. I would have to say this was my favorite part.  \n\nI was also impacted by the last part of the museum where all the newspapers ran there interpretations of Walts death and how the nation mourned his passing.\n\nThe only downside was someone pulled a fire alarm and we had to evacuate the building. When we got back inside some of the Audio Visual stuff was not operating and took 40 min to come back on.", "author": "anthony e."}

I went on a weekday and it was a beautiful day outside, which means the view of the Golden Gate Bridge was amazing. Parking was also a breeze at the lot across the street. It was nearly empty and you pay with a credit card at the machine (it does not accept cash). I don't remember the exact rates, but I do remember it was really reasonable. Like a dollar an hour or something like that...\n\nI paid $15 for admission (with the student discount) and I think the price was just about right. I spent over three hours there and enjoyed it. I read pretty much all of the displays - starting with the awards and keys to the city in the lobby area before the ticket entrance. \n\nI LOVE everything Disney and learned a lot visiting the museum about Walt Disney's life and the creation and growth of Disney the company. \n\nThe reason I give it 3 stars is because I would not go back again. The food selection and prices are a bit high and the items in the small gift shop are definitely overpriced. I also found the people who work there to be a bit unwelcoming - maybe I expected the usual Disney demeanor...", "author": "L H."}

I am not going to review the exhibits in the museum because there is so much and it is all GREAT. A truly complete journey of the life of Walt Disney from pre-birth to passing. Amazing. \n\nPlan on spending ALL DAY here, you will need to if you truly want to see everything. \n\nThey now allow you to take non-flash pictures inside now which is great in some places but the light levels are low and most of the lightibg is in a direction that is not conductive to taking pictures. But some of it works which is better than before when you could not take any pictures inside.\n\nI was also very surprised to run into Walt's daughter Dianne who was VERY nice. We talked to her for a few minutes and even took a picture with her. But she was VERY nice and we saw here walking thru the museum talking to kids and other families. Such an unexpected treat and a great memory.\n\nThey do have a small food area with even a smaller eating area. You really have no options in the area so you are forced to scope out a table and all huddle around it to eat. But the food is not great- I had a salad that was turning brown and the wife had a sandwich that was soggy and also old. Kids had the chili that was greasy... its rare my kids say no to chili but this was one of those times.\n\nThe gift shop is somewhat disappointing and is what is keeping this from a 5 star rating for me. I am a huge Disney fan and like to get things with the name of the location on them. I want to have a shirt with the museum logo on it more than a random Disney design that could have been purchased anywhere. The selection of logo material was horrible. They had one shirt in long sleeve that had the true logo on it and it was only in size small. When I asked if they had more shirts with that logo on it I was told it was discontinued and they were trying to get away with the logo with Walt's face on it. WHAT? I had to settle for the logo with Mickey on it, not bad but not what I wanted. We did pick up a magnet, a pin and a key chain with the Walt logo on it as well as other items that said the name of the museum on it. But a bigger selection of logo material is desperately needed. I was really ready to spend a few hundred dollars on this stuff but only spent around $90. It was really the only let down of the day (was not expecting giid food do that part was not a let down lol) - granted not a major let down, but still.... I want more WDFM logo merch!", "author": "Mark P."}

I really enjoyed perusing the galleries and learning more about Walt Disney. My favorite part was the small scale version of past/current Disneyland, so neat! There were also a few interactive portions which were fun. Everything felt like it was thoughtfully included in the museum, as if someone who cared very much had collected everything and put it in it's place.

I honestly thought the \"Family\" in \"The Walt Disney Family Museum\" stood for all families, but once inside  it became clear it meant the Walt Disney Family, more like a shrine for Mr. Disney.\n\nAll of the other reviews are very favorable and rightfully so - for adults. I enjoyed this remarkable museum for the same reasons cited in the other 140 plus reviews. However, for the two six year olds that accompanied me (the reason for going) were bored from the very beginning. The description on the ticket provides a strong hint as to how children are going to respond to this place - \"no cell phone, no photography, no strollers, no backpacks, no food and no beverages - the only 'no' missing was no children.\n\nYes, I know what you're thinking, \"hey dummy, it's a museum, what did you expect.\" Well...what I expected is the same magic a child feels when visiting Disneyland, or watching a Disney movie, or wearing a Disney costume, what I didn't expect was a museum as serious and as strict as the Louvre. Actually the Louvre permits photography, video, strollers and cell phones like most other museums. \n\nThe two girls did find some entertainment value in the barrow stools that lied in front of a small movie screen. Resourceful as children are they turned the stools on their side and straddled them like a horse which only lasted 30 seconds when an employee asked them to stop.  Children six and older are charged $12, money that would be better spent on a Disney movie. \n\nIf you want insight into this wonderful and remarkable man who has entertained us during our childhood, the museum does that and more, but leave the children at home, with the sitter and some Disney movies.", "author": "Larry S."}

Each \"chapter\" of Walt's life is covered in the various rooms and each room has a distinct feel to it.  My favorites being the True-Life Adventure section, the SPECTACULAR Disneyland section (literally made me gasp when I walked in) and the somber and perfectly executed final room commemorating Walt's death and the world wide reaction to it.\nI did work at Disneyland for a long time, and was involved in Disney University and Training for a stint so none of the information was new to me, but I was still engrossed with the detail and the cutting edge technology used.  \nI can say without hesitation that The Walt Disney Family Museum is the most spectacular and innovated museum I have ever been to!

If you are a fan of all things Disney, this is a must see.  Free Parking at the Presidio can't be beat either.  I thought we might spend a couple hours browsing through, but we were there for nearly five hours, that seemed to fly by on how well this is done.  It starts out very simple and as you continue to progress from room to room, gets more and more complex and bigger and better culminating in a scale size view of Disneyland that is wonderful to look at at all angles.  Even the elevator ride from one floor to the next is themed so the guest experience was well crafted at every stop.   Includes a couple of movie options, one made for the museum and the day I was there a showing of Nightmare Before Christmas.  I can see a Pixar exhibit coming in the future as a special exhibit - not necessarily part of the Disney family, but part of the Disney company and in the \"hood\" so to speak, so would be interesting to see a special exhibit.  No trip to a Disney attraction would be complete without a gift shop, and this one has some items I hadn't seen anywhere else.  Well worth your time.", "author": "Steve A."}

A little bit of Disney heaven in the middle of a state park and so close to my house can only mean all plusses everywhere.\n\nFrom the outside, it's unassuming and that's deliberate, otherwise, the Presidio trust would never okay the WD museum to be built here...it completely blends in with the other barracks, with only a sign outside to tell visitors that it is the Walt Disney Museum.  But once you enter inside, it's definitely going to be an experience. The lobby houses tons of Disney's awards (I believe that they have more in storage but not all are on display). They had the famous Shirley Temple presentation of the 7 mini Oscars behind glass, as well as Disney's furniture from Disneyland that he had used in his hidden apartment. The shop and cafe area are also on this level. If you're a museum member, you get 10% off on the merchandise.\n\nThere's 3 levels, the main level explains Disney's childhood years, and it has really cute cut-out animation with Disney's own voice telling his childhood stories, and there's a real cool Red Cross ambulance from WWI. You need to ride an elevator up to the second level, and the elevator decor is supposed to re-enact the inside of the Santa Fe train (don't pull on the shades, they don't move).\nOn level 2, is Disney and his brother's efforts in Hollywood. Please do listen to the old-timey phone sets, Mr. Disney voices his stories again on those phones. The next rooms are the Mickey years (ooo...Mickey's original merchandise wall!!! Ewww...original stuffed Mickey is ugly!) the Silly Symphonies room (ewww, original Donald has no pants! hehe), the Snow White/Bambi/Pinocchio/Fantasia rooms were beautiful. I really like seeing the workers' commissary menu (who knew you can get filet mignon for 15 cents??? And butter milk??)\n\nThe section for the union strike and the war years were informative, and the true life series along the wall with the Golden Gate panorama view was cool, but the gemstone of the museum is definitely Disney's Disneyland area. You see Disney's Lily Belle train and the progression of Disney's Land, then the piece de resistance: a miniature of the entire conception of Disneyland.  If you look straight through main street through Sleeping Beauty castle, you'll notice 2 tiny figures: it's Walt Disney and his child. The park also will go from Daylight to night time...NICE!\n\nThe latter parts are the tv shows, the live action movies and then the really sad room: Disney's death...(my friend always runs past this room cause she doesn't want to see the sadness). \n\nThe lower level houses a theater, workshop rooms, a free coat room, and an art gallery. \n\nFree parking outside, and sometimes if you're lucky, you'll meet Diane Disney Miller...the wonderful lady behind her father's museum.", "author": "Pauline L."}

The museum consists of 10 galleries, each of which you could give at least half an hour. The galleries are more for adults rather than for children, they walk you through the history of Walt Disney's family, of the development of his ideas, history of multiplication and animation as related to his world, and his fight to succeed. You will also see multiple snippets if various cartoon and animated movies. The developers of the museum has put enormous efforts into the presentation, and you can easily call it a World Class museum. I and my boyfriend had about 2.5 hours to spend there, and we could easily come back and enjoy it again, as there is so much to see. If this is your first time there, try to give yourself at least 3 hours, and do not purchase a special exhibition tickets, as you would have neither time nor energy left to cover that as well. If it is your only opportunity to visit this museum, then... you should decide what you want to see and go with that:, whether it is the main collection or a special exhibit.

Do not go here if you want to learn about aladdin, lion king, or anything disney past 1965 (the year Walt Disney died).\n\nThere are two levels of exhibits along with a gift shop and an extra area with a theater and mini exhibit (it is currently peter pan now).  Tickets are $20 and $15 for students and seniors. Entry is timed, but they weren't strict when I went. They made it this way because there is a lot to read and it's annoying when there is a giant group of people trying to read the same thing - no thanks.  \n\nThe museum did a great job integrating multiple forms of media, from traditional written descriptions on the wall and in front of the object, to mixed media cartoon with photos and walt's voice narrating his youth, to audio clips of walt through hand held old time phone receivers, to large tv screens playing disney cartoons and videos from walts life, to a ribbon like HD screen showing clips of disney movies.  There are also many interactive exhibits where you attempt to match the sound effects to steamboat willie and match music to the movie and learn a little bit about appropriate tempo and mood.  \n\nEnjoy the silly symphonies, disneyland tv, miniature replica of the original disneyland park, and world's fair exhibits from 1964 (I found out this was my parents third date and it was cute to see them both view this exhibit and reminisce).\n\nI tend to rush through musuems, but i spent over 5 hours here.  Luckily, there is ample free parking in the presidio!\n\nI found Walt's life to be very inspiring and would recommend that everyone learn more about him and his dream.", "author": "Valerie S."}

Would recommend to future out-of-town visitors, but would be unlikely to go back again by ourselves. The subject matter entertains a somewhat self-limiting audience, including those who grew up between the 1940's-60's or are interested in animation, film, etc. Those younger may find displays of how it was done \"in the olden days before computers\" to be tedious.\n\nThe exhibits are extremely well-done -- leveraging current technology to meet the various ways in which people can learn. Short audio and video presentations are spread throughout the exhibits, complementing  original documents, drawings, and photos. Information is often repeated in more than one medium, so whether you prefer to listen or read, you won't miss out. And instead of waiting for your turn in a little video cubicle, typical of many museums, there are few bottlenecks in the exhibit flow.\n\nBe forewarned, restrooms are available after more than half-way thru the exhibits. Which is why that area is one of two we found to be more crowded -- the other being towards the end with a plethora of framed tributes at Walt's passing. Is there some intended analogy to feeling as if one is in a slowly narrowing birth canal filled with these accolades, then passing thru a doorway into a large oval room with the final pictorial celebration of his life?\n\nAlso be aware that the museum signs are impossible to see from the parking lot -- we had actually been there months ago with visitors and left when we couldn't see where the museum was -- the Presidio restricts larger signs.", "author": "Karen-n-Rick C."}

If you are a typical family with a dog and 2.5 children thinking this will be Disney in San Fran, you will be disappointed.\n\nWe went to the Walt Disney Museum with my retired In-laws and my 9 year old daughter. We had read other Yelp reviews and set proper expectations with my 9 year old to the point that we had to talk her into going. She didn't hate it....she didn't love it. She did tolerate it for a 3 hour visit.\n\nIf you are a Disney FANATIC without kids, you can easily spend 4-5 hours going through the museum viewing all of the videos, reading all of Walt's letters to Roy and others, reading the dozens of pre-war Telegrams, watching the home movies, etc. Really fascinating stuff for the Disney fan.  If you are a casual fan you will also enjoy it, you will simply spend 90 minutes instead of 4-5 hours. \n\nThe museum itself it not Disney-esq on the outside, as it is in a Presidio building that (I assume) is a historic building that cannot be altered, so other than a small Disney Museum sign, you would have no clue what is inside. Once you step inside, you will see that the museum is exceptionally done in typical Disney quality, it is really well done. Nice blend of history with technology with many interactive exhibits, some of these will appeal to the young kids. There is also a small cafe and a nice gift shop.  The location is great inside the beautiful Presidio, right near the Golden Gate Bridge (with gorgeous views from one of the galleries!). Parking is plentiful and free right in front of the museum, a nice treat for San Fran.\n\nBottom line, if you are Disney fan, GO TO THIS MUSEUM. If you are fanatical, spend 4-5 hours. If you are a casual fan, plan on 2-3 hours. If you have pre-teens or toddlers in tow, either skip it, or go and plan to spend 60-90 minutes.", "author": "Craig C."}

Obviously my favorite part was the large scale model of Disneyland from the 50's and 60's. Much more impressive than the model they have at the Opera House in Disneyland.

First you see the early history of Disney as he's born in the very early 20th century, as well as some of the first jobs he had before moving to Los Angeles.  Then you get to see Disney Studios, prior to its development, particularly with some controversies Disney faced with certain investors he dealt with.  At some point, you will then get to see the original drawing paint used for animated classics like Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs, sitting in jars (not even empty).  Then of course you see the various periods in time which Disney, himself, was faced with political and world events and how he dealt with such events as far as making appealing motion pictures.  The whole history continues on and on, it's as if you're being transported back into time and being apart of Disney's life.  Really, the Walt Disney Museum explains the WHOLE history, even the not too great parts that happened in Disney's life.\n\nHowever, what really touched me the most about this museum was a video of Walt Disney and other voice over artists practicing their craft and bouncing ideas back and forth as far as how to appropriately illustrate the characters.  Not everyone knows this but Walt Disney did voice over work for a number of early Disney pictures.  In this video with Disney and the voice over artists, you can see Disney with a lot of smiles, clearly excited and enthusiastic about practicing the voices with his team.  It is clear that Disney wasn't just a CEO, he was an innovator and loved making films.  This is a stark contrast compared to when Michael Eisner was CEO of Disney Studios, even Robert Iger who is running the Disney Studios these days.  Anyone who loves filmmaking and not the big studios would really appreciate this video.\n\nI encourage anyone who loves Disneyland, Disneyworld, Disney films, is an animator, filmmaker or likes Disney to go to the Walt Disney Museum.  It is an experience you'll never forget.", "author": "M B."}

You know, I was surprised that I have heard virtually no buzz about this museum which is an excellent exploration of the art of animation and creativity in general.  It tells you how Disney built the empire.  It is loaded with artifacts like old cameras and drawings, and includes all of his Oscars on display.  Uncle Walt (actually my real uncles were nothing like Walt) comes across here as a flawlessly nice and creative family man.  I was quietly hoping for some depravity but the closest was an exhibit on a strike of the Disney studios.   It is called the Disney Family Museum but I believe that refers to Walt's family (much in evidence here) and is not meant to suggest that this is a place especially for the kiddies.  There were no kids in evidence when I went although there's probably enough representations of Mickey and the gang to keep them occupied while you envy Walt's great and productive life.", "author": "Frank B."}

It completely covered the company's history, Walt's creative process, his family history and how that influenced his work, and huge amounts of film clips and memorabilia. \n\nThe most impressive thing about Walt Disney was his vision, and how that vision created the long form animation film, three dimensional animation photography, and redefined amusement parks and family entertainment. \n\nWe spent two and a half hours in the museum, and bought memberships because we felt like we could have spent several more hours and still not gotten through all of the material presented. \n\nIt was fun, informative, inspiring, creative, and a great way to spend an afternoon.

If they don't have good attention spans and/or dislike large amounts of reading, this isn't going to be their thing. You can take kids when they're about 10 or so, and if they're interested in learning about Walt Disney. The man, not the Park. If that doesn't sound like your kid, then this isn't the place for you. This isn't a replacement for Disneyland.\n\nAnd that's one of the reasons why I love it so much. I still love Disneyland--and am looking forward to my next trip in July--but I've been here twice and felt that my $15 admission (student rate!) was well worth it. I came here in February with my family (dad, 18-yr-old brother, 15-yr-old sister) and then my boyfriend in late April.\n\nThe museum itself advises about two hours for a complete tour, but I'd give yourself around three. It's nice to go through at a leisurely pace, especially if--like me--you find yourself fascinated by concept art of the films or the conversations and speeches you can listen to on old-fashioned phones. \n\nThe family and I left momentarily for lunch--and even got wristbands so we could come back, which was nice--about halfway through our tour. The boyfriend and I had eaten beforehand and we were able to go through the entire museum without a bathroom break.\n\nThe museum primarily focuses on things that the company did during Walt's lifetime, so you see everything from the earliest cartoons he did in Kansas City to what he was working on at the time of his death. Films covered are everything from Snow White to Mary Poppins, and it also features the first ever diorama of Disneyland Park. They incorporate both the 1955 elements and the 2010 elements in the diorama, which I thought was a nice touch.\n\nThe gift shop's very expensive (although this depends on your taste), but offers really cute Disney merchandise you don't find anywhere else. I fell in love with a Snow White purse that was unfortunately $80: more than I can justify spending on something as replaceable as a purse.

I took a chance and took my 5-year-old inside and was so glad I did - she was in awe of the chronological journey through Walt Disney's \"cartoons\" showing in each room...granted, I would have loved to have more time to read, but I read and looked around at most everything and was still having a hard time getting my little girl to leave each room we were in to come to the next room.   Her favorite part was the early Mickey cartoon that had many sound effect makers (including a cat's tail, made of metal and pulled from metal box), xylophone, ratchet  box, drums, tapping things, etc. in front of it -you put on earphones then get to be, well, a Foley artist, basically, and sync the sound effects to the cartoon.  She could have stayed at that all day).  Her second favorite was either the huge, magical model of Disneyland or the cartoon with the live-action little girl (Alice) in it that jumped, ran and rode through 5 different screens).  She also loved listening to the other interactive music \"games\" based around Disney classic films.  My favorite was seeing how Walt created so much from what was available at each moment in the history of animation and then pushed the art forward into so much more, and then to see how he and his team leaped into creating new techniques, like the multi-layered camera, to add dimension and magic to early animation.   I even loved seeing the first camera he used for his Alice Comedies series in the 20's...funny how it took my breath away, and my daughter asked me why it had a turn crank on it so I got to explain (while I imagined) how they once had to make the camera \"go\" with a crank (at least their batteries never died).  I guess it's obvious I was transported into how a genius takes what's available and makes it magic...and then add that to his ability to take a new path each time he faced adversity and.... I was inspired by the message that Walt proved...you gotta have heart.  I don't always feel that heart today at Disneyland, that was for sure still there when I was a child at Disneyland, but is sort of diluted by others in the Disney franchise these days...but at this museum, I felt deeply the magnificent heart behind all of it, that made that innocent childlike heart in me respond on such a deep level to everything Walt Disney created, at this museum.", "author": "Cindy K."}

Be aware this is a museum; it tells the story the way the Disney family wanted it told, doesn't have any rides and while there are a lot of film clips to watch, it won't entertain most kids as much as it will adults who remember \"Wonderful World of Color\" and \"The Mickey Mouse Club\".  We lunched at the museum sandwich shop which was fine for our purposes - just a healthy light lunch.  We also enjoyed seeing the Presidio itself which is a historic and beautiful former military post.  Take a taxi, and be prepared to wait for the taxi to pick you up on the return trip, because not everyone wants to go out to the Presidio for a fare, apparently.", "author": "Nelda E."}

They answered 'about 2 hours.'  Six hours later, we still weren't done. The exhibits were varied and piqued my interest as animation is a hobby of mine.  I enjoyed the fact that a good portion of the museum was spent on Walt's career PRIOR to Mickey Mouse.  Of course, they can't leave him out or the works that followed.  The entire '50s film decade was showcased in a single room - seemed kind of rushed to me.  But there is a great 3D sculpture of Disneyland park.  There's no photography allowed inside, so don't bother bringing a camera.  eat before you go!  There's a cute gift shop at the end (of course) that sells E Ticket magazine editions!  A fan-produced publication that highlights past and present Disney attractions.\n\"I also liked the fact that they were not overly biased in favor of him;  they did include a display all about his animators' strike.\"  -Johnny\n\n\"I could have been done with this museum in 2 hours.  But SOMEBODY had to take forever looking at every little thing.  Oy!  It was very nice, though.  Very clever presentations of the information.  Bring your tissues for the last room :(\"  -Dirkie", "author": "Chien V."}

The museum is about Walt Disney and his family and his career - it is not a \"fun\" place for kids, so don't bring 'em.  If you have a bookish teenager that likes Disney, s/he'll probably do ok. Quite a bit of the museum is reading vs. interactive or electric media. I did really enjoy the replica of the original Walt Disney World. If the museum had been $10/adult, I would have given it another star - but, I tend to find all the museums in this area too pricey.  There is plenty of free parking in front of the museum (+), but I didn't like that you couldn't take any pics in the museum (-).  During busy times, it's best to go on line and get your tickets in advance.  They have timed entry, meaning only so many people are admitted each 15 minutes or so - I did notice that towards the end of the day, it seemed like there was more availability, so maybe you could walk in.", "author": "Lea T."}

Well done, well laid out.\nI must mention as a con I found it a bit difficult to get there by public transportation - being from out of town and never having been to the Presidio before I felt the map on the website was not as clear and helpful as I would have liked. We ended up having to walk quite a bit, not being sure where we were going as we walked into the Presidio.\nAlso, I would have liked it to have known beforehand that it's $5 off with a AAA card. The website does not advertise that very openly - you have to look under \"special discounts\" to discover this!", "author": "Julia S."}

It is located in a great part of the Presidio and offers a nice view of the Golden Gate Bridge. A friend of mine came into town and she is a HUGE Disney fan. She begged me to take her here and she was like a kid in a candy store,\n\nI will agree with the others who have said that this museum is not really kid-friendly for those youngsters who hope to see a lot of visually stimulating cartoon stuff. There are a lot of exhibits that require reading, and explain history and technology. Not something most 6 six year olds would be interested in. There was one little kid who told his mom he was bored in the 3rd exhibit hall (there are ten). Definitely set aside at least 3-4 hours if you really want to absorb everything. My friend read *everything* and it took us 4.5 hours to get through the whole museum. On certain days, they even have special screenings in the theater downstairs (which we did not get to see--I imagine this happen on the weekends).\n\nYou definitely leave having a better understanding and respect for Walt Disney and his imaginative creations.\n\nI think the part that excited me the most was the FREE, PLENTIFUL PARKING! We all know what a miracle this is in San Francisco!\n\nNo photography is allowed though--which includes cell phones. They have volunteers monitoring every exhibit hall, so photographers, you will be caught!\n\nI took off one star because of the ticket situation. They state on the website that you have to purchase your tickets in advance via their ticket-selling contractor. BE CAREFUL WHEN PURCHASING YOUR TICKETS! We had difficulty with the website, and every time the page crashed, we had to go back one step. And if you are not careful, you will miss the fact that the DATE GETS RESET when this happens. This happened to me and I didn't notice until we were getting ready to leave for the museum that the date of entry was for the week prior (the date I purchased the tickets). So I had to spend another $40 on new tickets and they would not let me exchange or return the tickets we did not use (granted, I should have caught the error myself, but it still irked me). And they were allowing people to buy tickets at the door even though the website said they didn't sell at the door. We went on a Thursday afternoon though, so it wasn't crowded at all.\n\nAll in all, definitely worth the $20 a ticket (or in my case, the $80 I spent on tickets!)", "author": "Rachel H."}

My family has been into Disney for a very long time and to come here and see these exhibits were fantastic. They had a lot of things in there that I was shocked to see: for example, some of the first sketches of Mickey Mouse (that might have been one of my favorite things). There was a bunch of info about Walt and his family and the Walt Disney company as it progressed through the years. I sort of felt bad though- in order to read everything, and to listen to all of the audio exhibits, I felt that I was in a lot of people's way, but there really didn't see any other way. I tried to hurry through the stations as fast as I could, but in doing so, I sorta feel like I missed some stuff. Oh well, I guess it can be a reason to go back. :) All in all, it was a very fun and sweet experience. In my opinion, this probably wouldn't be all that fun for younger kids. Well, maybe a rare kid who is interested in early Disney work. :) And of course for all of us kids-at-heart.", "author": "Roya K."}

It walks you through Walt's life and how everything started, such as Mickey and Disneyland. There are some really neat exhibits and interactive things to do, but also a lot of reading.  The interactive things aren't really made for children, so as many said, I  wouldn't recommend taking children.  It does take about 4 hours to get through everything. Its only two stories but it takes a long time to read and do everything. I went on a weekday so it wasn't too busy. they're not strict on the ticket times, but like I said, it wasn't busy when I went.  For the not so big Disney fan, which I dragged a couple friends with me who were not, they still found it interesting and enjoyed themselves.  There were many small clips of Disney movies and shows that bring you back to your childhood.  I would definitely go check it out again.", "author": "Christopher L."}

The museum is in the most beautiful location, but I don't know that Walt Disney had any connection to this city.  Odd choice.  Even though the museum isn't directly connected to Disney Burbank it still has that slick, well organized, you can't get hurt feel to it.  They have purple coated employees at every turn who smile and say 'hello' and guide you through the process.  The $20 entrance fee is bit much as others have mentioned.  The layout of the museum is very entertaining and informative.  Lots of interactive displays and visual elements everywhere.  Most of the info was old news to me: Walt in WW1, his early work in Kansas City, Oswald, then Snow White and the nine old men of animation.  I didn't have the patience to stand and listen to every old recording but was taken by all of the animation.  My interest began to peak when I hit the Fantasia period, and the very entertaining trip to south America (they even have Walt's 16mm camera he used to document the trip).  The wartime years was when I stopped and started watching the entire video display until it looped back. I love those DD propaganda cartoons and the posters for \"Victory Through Airpower\".  The live action films of the early 50's were next and this too was very cool.  I was surprised as hell when I came across the \"True Life Adventures\" and \"People and Places\" exhibit, which not only showed clips from those fantastic docu's but also afforded you a gorgeous view of the Golden Gate.  They even have the original golden globe model that was used for the true life logo.  Now I was in my wheelhouse and completely hooked. \n\nThe descent from floor 1 to floor 2 was the most amazing.  Artifacts that I was completely (as a fan) amazed by.  An original cirCARama camera!  The red sport autopia car for Walt's grandkids.  The Lilly Belle!  Even small items like Walt's dresser valet with the contents of his pockets.  The last section covering Walt's death was very touching.  \n\nI found the gift shop to be very 'eh' and I didn't try the chow.  The theater I definetly want to come back for (separate admission).  I couldn't believe how much free parking there was at the Presideo.", "author": "David B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-09-16", "description": "It was ok.  Sometimes hard to hear, because several things are playing all at once and you hear things coming from several directions.  Then when you picking up the audio things to listen it was sometimes very loud and sometimes not loud enough.  I found it frustrating to read something and then pick up the audio thing and hear the exact same thing.  The day we went it was not crowded - the employees words - if you went on a crowded day it would be awful, because it is a small place with displays close together.  It would be better if it was more spread out.  It looks like they plan a headphone audio tour in the future, because they had a room to return them, but they are not provided yet.  I think that would be much much better. I was disappointed that they did not have a place to see the Spin and Marty show or the Hardy Boys show.  Most people these days have not seen them and I think that would be neat. I also thought it was too expensive, but I guess they have to pay rent for that fabulous location that isn't even utilized, by having a place to eat seeing the view.  I do not think I will ever go back or take visitors from out of town.  I think Walt Disney was a unbelieveable man, I don't think this museum told his story that well.", "author": "mary m."}
