I show up to pick up my order and all the staff just stand around with a clueless look on their faces while they walk around pretending to look like they're busy doing something. The  place has not a single customer in it and yet service is nowhere to be found. Then I see one of the chefs, Debbie, and she kindly but with a look of frustration tells me that she'll find Mike to help me since apparently that's what he's in charge of.\n\nMike walks over from around the corner and proceeds to fumble around with the order bringing the same two salads from back and forth between the kitchen to where I'm waiting. He sets the items on the table without even bagging them up and says \"there you go\" and walks back to where he had been sitting and chatting with some person. For the order to not be ready on time and for the shit-show of a service experience Mike provided I would have to say this is the least professional staff I have witnessed. \n\nPro tip: I also saw one of the staff change a garbage can's bag with the same gloves she has used to touch food. \n\nThanks Lemonade.", "author": "Phi P."}

A simple tomato and avocado salad isn't usually tossed with roasted pine nuts- but it should be! \n\nIt's not just the twist on comfort food or the three kinds of poke they featured that day; it's the amazingly friendly, service-oriented staff they hire. \n\nThe employees are tremendous, all focused on the customer experience. The restaurant is clean and organized. Even the flooring-  patterned with lemon slices -is friendly and makes me smile. \n\nI feel happy when I look at the wall garden that's the restaurant's entry to the greeting I've received as if I'm a welcome friend or frequent customer- which I haven't become- yet.\n\nYou can ask for samples, order \u00e0 la carte or choose plates to have hot and cold items assembled for you. \n\nAnd the lemonades are so delicious. The rosemary-watermelon is particularly refreshing but they have several flavor combinations to try. \n\nAnd I'll tell you, the next time we have a record-breaking 106-degree day like we had last September, I'm heading over to Lemonade for one of their frozen lemonade slushies.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

It has a cafeteria style set-up and you can choose from a variety of prepared dishes either a la carte or on combination plates. You can even sample nearly anything before you order--on my most recent visit, we selected a wide variety of things to share, and some of the standouts to me included the Brussels sprouts with dates (what an interesting pairing!), the salmon/avocado \"Louie\", butternut squash with corn and corn nuts (fascinating textural contrast), the Thai green curry with chicken meatballs (lovely lemongrass flavor), harissa cauliflower, curried cauliflower with almonds, broccoli with ricotta, and spicy green beans with chicken. I was definitely impressed by how flavorful all of these veggie-centric dishes were. However, some of the items looked like they had been sitting around for quite a while--the avocado in the avocado/salmon Louie was turning brown, and the pre-marinated soy ginger salmon poke we ordered was definitely losing its freshness as well. While I'm a fan in general of Lemonade, I've also had somewhat inconsistent experiences here, but it's still definitely worth a stop for a quick, casual meal!", "author": "David K."}

She was super friendly and bubbly. However, the workers that scooped the food seemed a bit confused and dazed. I wanted the chef's plate ($13 -- 1 protein, 2 sides, and a piece of bread) but the lady behind the counter repeatedly asked what I wanted. I'd chalked this up due to the store being new though. So hopefully it'll get better!\n\nI got the tender steak with chimichurri sauce, truffled mac and cheese, and the mashed potatoes. I really like the two sides, but I was a bit disappointed in the steak. It was cold and tasted like it was sitting there for awhile. The two sides were served hot and were really really creamy.

It's super easy to pick up something healthy from Lemonade when we need a quick bite. The brussel sprouts are great, as is anything that is curried.\n\nHowever, constructing a meal is super confusing. Our last trip, we wanted a plate of 4 marketplace salads. We chose our salads, and then were billed for 3 salads and an extra - which was about $5 more than we expected to pay (not a big deal, but that's also about a 40% larger tab than just the 4 salads.) Why? Because one of the salads (the \"Chicken Apple SALAD\", was not actually considered a salad by the cashier. What? Why on earth would you call something that is not considered a salad and place it right next to the salads, and then declare that we could choose any 4 salads?\n\nThe cashier was not helpful in the least. Like so many people in customer service jobs now, she just seemed indifferent. At that point, she said, there was nothing we could do because the food had already been delivered to us. Oh, and she also couldn't tell us where to find the prices of the plates. It felt like no one really cared about the user experience. That is, until I spoke with the manager Paolo.\n\nPaolo is *awesome*. He completely redeemed our experience. We often lament how customer service has disappeared. Paolo made things right, and most of all, he made me feel listened to and validated.\n\nOur experience was 1 star, but Paolo was 5 stars, so in the end, it averages out to about 3 stars. We'll probably go back, but I won't be recommending the chain to our friends - I'd hate for them to having a confusing/frustrating first experience just trying to get oriented to get food.

Soup wasn't sealed properly so it spilled when I try to take it out of the paper bag (imagine the disaster with tomato soup). The rest that was left I had to drink it out of the bowl because they gave me two forks. The sandwich was cold and everything slid out because the thick wrapping paper was so big I couldn't use it to wrap my sandwich and eat it at the same time. I ended up eating my sandwich separately - ingredients then bread. Truly a MESS and unenjoyable meal for $18. Ironically, the two forks came in handy so I don't have to use my fingers to feed myself. But seriously, do yourself a favor and find another sandwich shop.", "author": "Jennifer F."}

Vibrant, bright and clean space. Really friendly staff that smile from beginning to end. Unfortunately, the food is sub par. \n\nLemonade often feels like a bait-and-switch with their fancy stores and mediocre taste, and this location is no exception. The Inner Sunset's restaurants are unique because they are low key, grungy, and ultimately delicious. Lemonade stands out from the pack, but blending in would have probably been a better strategy. Restaurants are food first and until this is true for Lemonade, they will never get as far as they desire. \n\nI will come back in a few months to see if the food has improved.

The Downtown and West Portal locations tasted so much better and the workers were more competent.\n\nIt was 2:30pm on a Saturday afternoon and hardly anyone there. There was a party of three in front of me and a lady was helping them get their orders. I waited five minutes and I saw at least five people working. Not sure what they were doing.\n\nFinally someone took my order. I had to repeat my order of Chicken Sandwich with orecchiette pest pasta salad and Chicken Breast entree with truffle mac n cheese and mashed potatoes twice to him. It's weird. He'd partially input one order and then ask me what I ordered again. Fine - maybe he's new to the job. He asked me what sauce I wanted with my chicken and I said chimichurri after he listed the options.\n\nI grabbed by number and proceeded to pay at the cashier where I ordered a blood orange lemonade and frozen lemonade. I took my drinks and waited at a booth for my food.\n\nFive minutes later, the cashier shows up with one box with the chicken sandwich and asked what else I ordered. I said the chicken entree and she replied that it'd be a few more minutes.\n\nFive more minutes later, the guy who took my order came by and asked what else I ordered. Seriously? Can't you guys look at my receipt? I said that I'm waiting for my chicken entree and he replied with mash and mac n cheese? Nodding because he was so proud he remembered. Then replies with, \"It's going to take a little longer because they're making it. Like ten more minutes.\"\n\nSeriously?! Why the f did you not tell me that when I ordered from you after waiting five minutes to be serviced? My frozen lemonade is no longer frozen and my sandwich is no longer warm. I thought this was a grab and go type of place. Instead I've been here 15-20 minutes waiting for \"fast food.\"\n\nTo top it off, I brought my food home and noticed that I didn't get a \"baked crisp.\" Not sure what it is but considering I paid $37 for food, I'd like to get what I'm supposed to get. Additionally, I never got my chimichurri and he gave me balsamic sauce for the super dry chicken. So disappointing. If I got this kind of treatment with bad food, imagine how bad this place would be during a rush. No thank you. I rather go somewhere else or drive to West Portal.", "author": "Remus L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-01-08", "description": "My partner and I stumbled across this place as we left from Golden Gate Park and without looking at yelps ratings and reviews, we decided to take a chance. As it was our first time paying a visit to the Lemonade chain, we found it difficult to order but thankfully the Lemonade staff was beyond friendly and was able to help us order something based on what we were in the mood for. Both my partner and I ordered the herb grilled chicken sandwich and despite the delectable images on the menu, there were two major problems with our sandwiches. \n\n1. The combined price for a cup of lemonade, a cup/side of macaroni, and the sandwich came out to a little over $22.00! Since I was practically starving and refused to go through the already complicated ordering process, I gave the cashier my card :-( In my opinion, this seemed very pricey compared to the other delicious food places within the sunset area but nevertheless, I was excited to try something new.\n\n2. After purchasing my meal, I was told that it would take an additional 10 minutes to prepare my food over the fact that there was no available cooked chicken. Although upsetting, I kept my hopes up. When the food arrived about 13 minutes later, I was completely unimpressed with both the taste and presentation. As with the rest of the reviews on yelp, the sandwich was not only bland in taste but also was mushy in its texture. The chicken was soft and slippery, leaving my partner to mistake the  chicken for egg whites and the mozzarella for jello. We were both unimpressed with both the food and the price and will most likely not return. \n\nOn the plus side, Lemonade's staff was extremely friendly and knowledgable about their menu down to the ingredient. Its refreshing design was more than inviting and their $4 blood orange lemonade was impressive. Until Lemonade improves their awfully bland taste and texture, which seem to be something that they are infamous for, I will not be making a second visit anytime soon.", "author": "Isaiah W."}

I don't know what happened but after that, it's now always dry to the point that it's hard to swallow it. As for the sides, one constant side that I would always get is the roasted brussel sprouts but then it happened again and they cooked it differently that it just tasted sugary and raw. Ew. I just wasted money and didn't even finish my meal. I had the truffle mac n cheese once and that was quite good. I just wish the cooking of the food would be more consistent.

I believe this is my first.\n\nCame to this branch after having a positive experience at the Burlingame location. When I ordered there was only one person in front of me. I got a Chef's plate with steak and an order of chicken a la carte. After I paid, staff asked me if I would want to change my order to steak because chicken would take an extra five minutes while it finishes cooking. I said I can wait. Staff told me they would bring the food to me. I sat directly in front of the register to make it easier. A rush of about 7-10 people came in. At this time, one of the chefs took out a tray of chicken. I anticipated getting my food momentarily.\n\nAfter 20 mins, I went up to the counter to follow up. I expressed empathy knowing they were busy, however I was told 5 minutes--I did not expect to wait this long. Staff took my receipt and went to check on my order. Staff said, \"I'm sorry we ran out of chicken but I'll make sure it comes out right away\". This came on the heels of me seeing all of the chicken that was just brought out be served to patrons that came after me. I asked her if they served all of the chicken that was brought out and was not able to get a straight answer. \n\nI waited for another 10 minutes before I just asked for another order of steak instead. The staff then asked me what my order was again. Are you kidding?! That was just incompetence in my opinion. At the very minimum, I wish they would have owned up to their mistake and told me they forgot my order and begin to try to make it right. The least one can do is offer me a lemonade while I wait perhaps? I don't know. I ended up getting one order of hot steak, one order of cold steak, a decent tasting side of green beans and some arugula. His place only gets two stars because I feel like one star restaurant's are reserved for places with racists maybe.

There was no line, a plus. There were many food options, another plus. So why only two stars? \n\n1. Bad service\n\nAbout five minutes after we ordered, an employee came over with the bf's plate.  He set it down and grabbed our number so I thought he would be right back with my food. \n\nFive minutes later, still no sight of my food so I go up to inquire. The same employee who helped us with our order was ringing up a family. Ten minutes later, he's still helping them without any acknowledgment of my presence. \n\nFinally, he finishes up and asks me what I want to order. I tell him it's been over 15 minutes and I still haven't gotten my food. He goes and looks at the sandwiches waiting to be plated, returns to confirm my order, then goes back and looks at the sandwiches packed in takeout boxes. Turned out my sandwich had been chilling on the counter in a takeout box.\n\n2. Mediocre food, small portions.\n\nI liked the spicy jalapeno kick of the roasted chicken sandwich (\"the San Diego way\") but the portion was small for $12 with only four tiny pieces of chicken. The menu said it came with avocado but there wasn't any in my sandwich. The tomato and pasta salad was ok, but the chips were mostly crumbs.\n\nThe bf had the roasted chicken breast with mashed potatoes and veggie chili ($13). He said the chicken wasn't terrible but a bit overcooked and lacking flavor. It came with balsamic chicken jus on the side which was fine. The chili was basic and the mashed potatoes was fine. He considered it a light lunch in terms of the amount of food.\n\nI would've liked to add Lemonade to my list of go-to food places in the area, but overall, the various issues left a sour taste in my mouth that doesn't make me want to return any time soon.", "author": "Venna L."}

The salmon looked really old  and mushy, so I opted for the tuna. When the girl went to put the rice in, she failed to ask me whether I wanted white or brown rice.

I asked her for soba noodles, as I did not feel like having rice so I guess that was nice of her. Then she told me that they ran out of wakame salad and asked if I would like to have the furikake, ginger, or fried garlic to replace. Again, she knew there was no wakame but didn't mention that beforehand. If I had known that, I could have gotten something else than a sub par poke bowl with half of what I wanted. Now when I actually ate the food - I was surprised by how mushy the soba noodles were. They literally broke as I put my fork into the bowl. It was really close to the consistency of baby food... and the poke itself was fine, but it barely had any tuna in it. I had only 5 pieces, and the rest was mostly mandarin orange and oranges.

Not acceptable to take this long.\n\nFinally, the sandwiches we got were made poorly.  They were drenched in aioli - we went through probably 15 napkins.  They also left huge chunks of pure skin/fat on the chicken - not the good crispy skin you might actually want to eat.  Not acceptable.\n\nI'm not giving this a one star only because the food wasn't terrible.  It wasn't very good to be clear, but it was far from inedible.\n\nSo attention Lemonade corporate management: fly up more trainers from LA.  Your employees don't know what they are doing or your managers aren't managing well.  Course correction needed.", "author": "Kevin G."}

Some of the sides cost a bit extra, like the Poke.  The poke was really tasty though.

There was barely anyone there when I went the other evening, but half of the tables had random food left on them and/or were \"wiped clean\" with grease smeared all over them.

I ordered an entree, was told the noodles weren't available, after a 10 minute wait, and was offered rice. OK. When I started eating, I realized I had been given a completely different entree. Too upset and frustrated to complain. One person serves one customer at a time, including filling the beverage order and ringing up the check. If there was an actual crowd - we were the only customers - they would be totally unprepared. Food bland and overpriced. Not fresh. Understaffed. Are these company owned locations or franchised?

The service was much less friendly and disorganized. The salad selections included many empty dishes. We were told \"The tomato avocado salad won't be out for at least 20 minutes.\" and \"The avocado poke is really popular so it goes fast.\". We did not come in near to closing time, so I wonder whether or not they were trying to clear the other salads and didn't want to prepare new batches of the \"popular\" foods.\n\nThe wait to receive our food was really long. When we finally received our meals, we were even less impressed. We ordered the \"tender\" steak and the \"seared\" ahi both which carry an additional charge above the $13 cited in giant numbers at the top of the menu board.\n\nThe steak and the ahi were both tough and loaded with sinew. The worst of the meal was the SALT overloaded on everything. The mashed potatoes were inedible due to the excessive salt and the macaroni was not far behind. The cauliflower salad was okay, but not nearly as good as it is at the Mission Street location. The lemonade was yummy though.\n\nI am sad to say that with so many more affordable dining choices in the neighborhood, I will probably not return to this Lemonade location unless I am simply thirsty.", "author": "Rebecca H."}

My sister was in town and wanted to try it, so she ordered the plate with chicken, mac n cheese (regular), and tortilla soup. The staff was super helpful--my sister asked what was in the tortilla soup and the girl brought out a book and read off the ingredients, and then poured a little taster cup for her. I wasn't hungry, but got a blood orange lemonade. It was absolutely delicious, and I still can't stop raving about it. My sister said the food was just OK--the tortilla soup was too salty for her to eat and she said the mac and cheese was disappointing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-07-22", "description": "I will preface the review by saying that I have enjoyed eating at Lemonade restaurants in Los Angeles for the past several years - I have probably been close to two dozen times at multiple locations, and have always had wonderful experiences (which is why I have continued to go back).  I was incredibly excited when Lemonade opened in SF - and it's really disappointing that the experience just isn't the same as LA. \n\nI have eaten at the downtown SF and Portola locations before - they have been just okay.  Today I tried the brand new one and had just a terrible experience.  While the SF restaurants look the same and overlap in terms of the menu, the quality just isn't the same - and the operations need huge improvement.  This location is new, so certainly some growing pains - I just hope the folks looking to build a consistent experience and brand recognize that their operations in SF do not match the great restaurant they have built in LA.  A quick scan of Yelp reviews reflects the discrepancy in customer experience.\n\nSpecific feedback regarding my lunch today in the Inner Sunset:\n- Operations are clearly problematic.  The restaurant was half full and the line snaked out the door with it taking several minutes to move people along through the ordering process.  They didn't have enough people working - and there was confusion amongst the staff as to who was supposed to help who  \n- The multiple stations laid out weren't clear to people.  Customers who wanted sandwiches/salads were standing in the cold prepared salad station, and then waited in line for the people who were served cold salads to eventually pay.  When they reached their hot station it just clogged the line they then blocked the people who had cold salads waiting to pay (which blocked people from ordering cold salads)\n- They ran out of many things on the menu. About half of the cold salads were not available.  We instead tried to order the roast chicken - but that too was sold out.  Eventually I ordered the tuna and it was served without a \"crisp\" (aka toasted bread).  I was told at the cash register that they were out of that too\n- The food quality is bad - not anywhere close to what is prepared in LA.  The tuna I had was stringy - impossible to cut through, and required pulling the meat from the natural texture in the fish which resembled thick dental floss.  Pretty nasty.  The broccoli with riccota salata wasn't as fresh or tasty as what I eat in LA, and had much less cheese.  My wife's chicken thigh was grizzly and not super tasty.  Her cold salads also didn't taste like what we remember enjoying\n- Selection is not the same in SF.  There are fewer prepared salads available.  Additionally, they are always the same ones.  In Los Angeles they always seem to offer different salads, including special and seasonal ones.  Here it's the same selection every time - no seasonality\n- Pricing is weird.  No longer do they have the pick 2,3 or 4 salads, instead encouraging you to buy the 4 salad plate.  I think the intention was to simplify the menu through offering fewer choices - but it ends up being more confusing as there are so many options if you want to mix and match along the way, with the ability to do so and pricing being unclear\n- A small point, but for whatever reason there is a $4.25 markup per serving for ordering the Tuna & Avocado Poke as part of your 4 salad combo.  That's on top of the $12.50 for 4 salads.  So if you wanted one order of Tuna poke, it would cost $16.75 for the plate.  And say you wanted 4 scoops of the tuna, it would cost $29.50. This seems bizarre\n- Service was well intentioned - the staff did their best working through the obvious operational challenges.  \n\nI feel bad giving this review as I have historically been a huge advocate for the restaurant.  Not only have I continued to frequent the Los Angeles locations when I have been in town, but I was incredibly excited at their opening in SF.  I have tried the SF restaurants several times - they have all been disappointing, but borderline acceptable where I have remained hope that they would eventually get better.  Today it's clear that things have unfortunately gone downhill and I can no longer assume it's the same as Lemonade Los Angeles.\n\nI hope things improve improve to the experience at their Los Angeles restaurants.", "author": "Daniel W."}

I usually make a point of hitting local joints when traveling but was stocked when I saw a familiar name. This is a \"10.0\" Lemonade so they didn't have the Louie salad I like. In Beverly this can be made into a sandwich, so I was a little thrown off by the different layout. The plus is that in its place they have hot proteins Tender Greens style. I was bummed the tuna was served cold though advertised as a hot item, I mentioned this, the server asked a manger if she could heat it for me, the immediate response was \"of course\". So I had the seared tuna hot, with the same citrus sauce I love from la lemonade (which was better hot) and two sides for an \"AJ special\" was pricey but I'm use to that here. She served me my sides then said she would bring the hot tuna out to the table (Katie, likes her job). Lady at the register sold me on a cookie and 'Frozade\". Both good but I'll go for my regular blood orange next time. (Make that into a Frozade!) Same woman brought out my tuna and it was pretty damn good, small though. We got to chatting about the festival, she was former manager at one of the above mentioned locations. She mentioned they were new and the community had some reservations. I get the big business stigma, and the portion sizes are small, its pricey, but that's because we're a McDonalds nation.
