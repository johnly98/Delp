They don't have a huge wine selection for being a wine bar, but I did really enjoy the Pinot Bianco I got. I ordered the Spanish octopus gnocchi , and I really enjoyed it! I'm a huge octopus fan right now, so to be fair, I would probably like any dish with octopus. It wasn't rubbery at all and was really tender. The gnocchi was okay. It was a little too soft for my liking, but the dish as a whole was pretty good. The other good thing about here is that they make all of their pastas in-house which is always a plus! We also ordered the panna cotta which I really enjoyed! It was perfectly creamy and delicious. \n\nThe only downside was that the waitress we had wasn't super friendly, but she did give us a lot of menu suggestions!", "author": "Frannie Y."}

The music & wine is always thoughtfully curated. It's my ideal SF date night because it feels lively any night of the week, and casual enough to drop in and grab a seat the bar, lounge area, or communal tables. \n\nFor wine & small bites, it's solid. Mid-range prices. But main courses can be hit or miss. I once had an incredible gnocchi here, and then had a super disappointing $20 octopus \"paella\" (more like fried rice). The avocado toast is pretty unique, with halibut ceviche. \n\nOh, and service -- so so cool and unpretentious.

My version came with bourbon-poached cherries, polenta, and asparagus. It was a decently prepared and presented dish, and it was then quite reasonably priced ($17). It was also a good way to soak up a couple of their wines; here, they've got pretty much all the varietals covered, whether my own favorites like gruner veltliner, riseling, pinot noir, or cabernet franc.\n\nThe vibe is laid-back and casual, as the inside sort of feels like someone's living room, right down to music coming from a record player. Service was merely perfunctory, as it was obviously skewed towards regulars. Overall, a good neighborhood venue to try various wines by the glass and grab some decent food while you're at it.", "author": "Vincent L."}

The food that I tried here were pretty good and the wine were reasonably priced. \n\nWe had the tuna poke served on top of crispy seaweed, which was pretty tasty. When we were there, they were serving $1.50 oyster, which was a good deal but I'm not sure if it's always $1.50 or just that day. We also had the roasted asparagus; it was served with some creamy sauce and it was seasoned nicely. The cheese plate was pretty good too; it came with 3 different cheeses (one soft and two semi-soft cheeses) and served with perfectly crisp crostini, honey, pickled veggies, candied mixed nuts and some marmalade... not bad for $20 and definitely good for sharing.\n\nI will definitely be back to try other dishes in their menu.", "author": "Sam M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-22", "description": "What a lovely wine bar.  I heart you, 20 spot :)\n\nMy husband and I were so happy to have found this place.  You would think SF being so close to wine country and being a city that loves its wine, that there would be excellent wine bars litered throughout every neighborhood.  While there are definitely certain \"gems,\" unfortunately there are too many \"meh\" spots that leave you disappointed.  Not the case with this neighborhood gem.\n\nI had stumbled upon it and \"book-marked it\" as a \"must-go at some point,\" but just never got around to it.  Until earlier this month, and now it is on the short list of \"where should we go for dinner tonight.\"  Needless to say, I believe we will become regulars at this spot...\n\nFOOD: \n\nOur first time in, we went with another couple.  We had some cheese/charcuterie at our place before stopping in, so we decided just to do a few things to share.  Here's what we tried:\n\nDella Bread Plate (4 stars) - Wasn't expecting much with this; we opted to get it just so we had something to munch on while we waited for our other items to arrive. Well, were we blown away.  The bread was simply delicious.  Fresh, warm, and chewy - came with a variety of breads, and all were delicious.  The butter it came with was yummy as well; loved the addition of sea salt (love me some salted buttah!!).\n\nCoconut Milk Ceviche (5 stars) - This dish was one of my favorites - perhaps THE favorite of the night in my opinion.  The fish was so fresh, and the sauce/ingredients accompany offered so much flavor and the perfect amount of texture.  Yum - definitely recommend this dish.\n\nPotted Rabbit (4.5 stars) - Decadent, flavorful, creamy.  Was actually expecting not to be much of a fan, but I was blown away by this dish and couldn't stop myself for going for seconds.\n\nGrilled Octopus (5 stars) - My husband and I love octopus when it's done correctly - but it's always a gamble, because some places just don't execute it correctly.  This dish was perfectly cooked; crispy at the tips, yet soft throughout (no rubbery, tough texture like you can get when it's over cooked or gooey/flabby texture if under-done).  And the fennel salad and sauces that accompanied the octopus rounded out the entire dish.  One of our favorite dishes of the night - huge hit with all of us.\n\nWINE: \n\nThree of us (including myself) decided to do the wine flight - so glad we did that.  My husband opted to go for the sparkling rose (but was a bit jealous of our wine selections once they came!)  The wines included in the flight were impeccable.  You could tell that whoever selected the wine really know what they're doing.  Later we found out that the owner of 20 spot is actually the owner of Bacchus Wine Bar on Hyde Street in Russian Hill (close to Elephant Sushi): http://www.yelp.com/biz/bacchus-wine-bar-san-francisco.\n\nBacchus was one of our favorite wine bars in Russian Hill, offering a great selection of quality wines.  No surprise that 20 spot offers the same - a wonderful selection of quality wines at reasonable prices.\n\nWe had such a wonderful experience the first time, my husband and I made the decision right then and there that we would be back soon.  Aaaand, less than a week later, we were stopped in again.  This time we chose to sit at the bar, and ended up meeting the owner who was working behind the bar that night.  Such a friendly guy - it was so nice to chat with him.  He was also very generous with the wine, offering generous servings of those we ordered, and offering an \"extra\" pour of another red toward the end of the meal.  As with last time, every wine we tried was amazing.  For the food the second time around, we decided to do the cheese plate for 2, the ceviche, and one other \"main\" item (though it's slipped my mind what we actually ordered!).  All of the food was once again, amazing.  \n\nWe were out of town the last couple of weeks, and while we kept saying \"I can't wait to go back to 20 Spot when we get back!\" :)  We will definitely be in again soon, and I highly recommend stopping in.  Definitely recommend for a quiet/intimate dinner spot, but would also be great for a pre-dinner/post-dinner glass of wine or snack.", "author": "Rachael S."}

The restaurant is dim and sort of hipster/romantic, and they (true to their sign outside) play records all night long - the daily menu lists the records they'll be playing, but they also went \"off-book\" while we were there.  The folks working there are super friendly and really knowledgeable - it was fun to talk shop with them about different wineries and varietals.\n\nThe food was really impressive.  Not just for a \"wine bar,\" but in general.  It's pretty much vegetarian, which is cool - my meat-loving boyfriend said he could be a vegetarian if it meant eating like this all the time!  The only non-vegetarian item was the raw oysters - which were great.  Big and briny :)  We also had the clay pot asparagus, cast iron radishes (woah - turned me into a radish-lover!), snap peas, and chocolate avocado pudding.  Everything was awesome.  I could elaborate, but it would probably be too much.  Every flavor was spot on (appropriate given the wine bar name!).\n\nThe wine list was also fantastic.  We had stopped by Lark and Blush in Castro earlier in the night and had been uniformly disappointed - U.S. / California wines were very underrepresented, and the selection of Italian/French wines were pretty pedestrian.  At 20 Spot, they have tons of trailblazing U.S. winemakers on their menu (Donkey & Goat, Broc Cellars, etc) and then they have super unique foreign options, like an amazing Chardonnay/Posip/Pinot Grigio blend from a Croatian winery named Bibich.\n\nI can't wait to return!", "author": "Tay H."}

I think by the end of my review, you will hate the word \"cute\". It's an every Friday ritual. After a long week I require myself a quality cocktail or a nice glass of wine to welcome the weekend. The place looks like a tiny \"cute\" little house on the sidewide. The ambiance inside is very simple, \"cute\", and clean with very artsy and interesting decor. Bar stools, tables, and couches, great place to sit and relax. However, I may warn you - there is a regular who is really annoying.

The raw veggies, I'm not a fan... Raw radish? Your breath will be kickin. \n\nDeviled Eggs ($10) - smoked salmon and trout roe. it was lovely and \"cute\". This was probably one of the best deviled eggs I've had. the whipped yolk was smooth like silk and creamy, the smoked salmon gave it an additional layer of flavor, and the trout roe added the salty factor. It also came with a side of pickled vegetables and cucumber. Not sure that was a great combination with the eggs. And the presentation was beautiful... just not the teal round dinner plate it was served on (i know, i'm so judgemental LOL).\n\nSANGUINETO SANGIOVESE/CANAIOLO MONTEPUCIANO 2011 ($14/glass) - where do i begin?!

I love the retro & antique mismatched dinner- & silver-ware:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/20-spot-san-francisco?select=lGbRZvmE6ZCs4pvwDHeTsA#uPB5I6Z5nlMf6uPcULvHsQ\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/20-spot-san-francisco?select=lGbRZvmE6ZCs4pvwDHeTsA#EyqZV-lnip2tKgtbUmshzQ\n\nTHE WAIT: My bf called at ~8pm on a Thursday to hold a table. It was waiting for us at 9pm, but there were a few tables open anyway. When we left around 10:45pm, there were plenty of people still eating & at the bar!\n\nSERVICE: Excellent! We were greeted right away, they knew our name on the list, our server came to our table immediately & checked on us regularly. I felt terrible because I tried three different wines before settling on one she'd originally suggested. She was incredibly patient, professional, & nice.\n\nMUST-HAVES: None, unfortunately! Almost everything was well prepared but at the same time could have been greatly improved w/ one small change. That being said, of what we tried, the Burrata, Duck Lasagne, & Panna Cotta were more memorable.\n\nREDS: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/20-spot-san-francisco?select=lGbRZvmE6ZCs4pvwDHeTsA#VIGZbXmfftnpwg6HthzlUw\n\nBILL OF FARE: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/20-spot-san-francisco?select=lGbRZvmE6ZCs4pvwDHeTsA#Dy47Mh22TXM6Bl04LoK2jg\n* 1/2 dozen beausoleil oysters (shallot mignonette, 20 spot hot. $20) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/20-spot-san-francisco?select=lGbRZvmE6ZCs4pvwDHeTsA#oq_ThUsTHO4bMPqnoJUINw\nhot sauce: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/20-spot-san-francisco?select=lGbRZvmE6ZCs4pvwDHeTsA#OQBv9q0k1_wzf9QYVmFPPw\nServed on a wooden board on top of a bed of pebbles!

The burrata was soft & stretchy, subtly flavored, & the fresh greens & small slices of asparagus were a perfect complement. I wish there was an extra dash of sea salt to add a bit more flavor. We added some hot sauce from the oysters & that was good.\n\n* Devilled eggs (smoked salmon, trout roe, cucumber. $10) - 3 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/20-spot-san-francisco?select=lGbRZvmE6ZCs4pvwDHeTsA#LeLtRmZPTqm-8Blp9Zt3-g\nWell made, but not particularly a stand-out. The filling was very soft, & while the roe was a nice touch, it all just got blended in when you took a bite, probably because there was just an overwhelming amount of filling. Less filling & a topping w/ more texture/flavor (i.e. bacon!) would have made this much more interesting.\n\n* Rabbit lasagne (chard, tomato, fromage blanc. $20) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/20-spot-san-francisco?select=lGbRZvmE6ZCs4pvwDHeTsA#lr6r9VcZ2GvBHOzweBwwCg\ncross-section: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/20-spot-san-francisco?select=lGbRZvmE6ZCs4pvwDHeTsA#YKqSGQ3tHlpJLglZSYf2VQ\nReally nice, but in retrospect this was pretty pricey for a dish for one. The tomato was zesty & fresh, the cheese balanced it well, & the lasagna sheets soft. It had a bit of a spicy kick. The spinach layer at the bottom was tough compared to the lasagna & harder to cut through when I wanted to get a bite w/ good proportions of everything. I think it would've been better if integrated into a layer of the lasagna.\n\nDESSERT: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/20-spot-san-francisco?select=lGbRZvmE6ZCs4pvwDHeTsA#Ir7t_sxwp10CBCKTvHPcSA\n* Buttermilk panna cotta (lemon curd, blueberries. $7) - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/20-spot-san-francisco?select=lGbRZvmE6ZCs4pvwDHeTsA#eITDi_h8Es-iJEElsyA3tg\nThis was great, but don't make the mistake of digging only into the top! It's hard to tell, but only the top 1/4 is the lemon curd. My first few bites were purely lemon curd & I was overwhelmed by the sweetness. The panna cotta's (which had perfect soft texture) flavor was more neutral & blended really well w/ the lemon curd. The blueberries weren't ripe enough - they definitely could have been softer & sweeter.\n\nSWEET & FORTIFIED WINE\n* Nieport 10 year Tawny Port ($12) - 3 stars\nOnce again, that grain alcohol fortification - you can definitely taste it, & it doesn't blend well w/ the wine, a lighter port.\n\n* Landgraf Riesling Auslese, 2009 ($10) - 4.5 stars\nCame chilled, lightly sweetened, yet w/ a little bit of a tart fruit flavor. Well balanced, just strong enough, & light. I enjoyed this throughout my meal.\n\nTo try next time: Hamachi, Mussels (smelled great!).", "author": "Ziyan C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-11-14", "description": "4.5 STARS\n\nThe First Date.\n\nMany people have asked me for suggestions on where they should bring a first date. You want to impress the girl (or guy) without looking like Mr. Desperado who hasn't gotten laid in a century by forgoing your rent with foo-foo tasting menus. But, you don't want to be that guy who gives off the cheapass vibe by suggesting to grab a banh mi in the TL and share a pee-stained curb and a 40 with the hobo you're sitting next to. The latter actually happened to me. *Sigh* Damn you, Match.com. \n\nYou want a place in the middle of the cost spectrum and that's intimate yet low-key. A place that you can hold a conversation without feeling like have to shout so nearly deaf, Mrs. Simpson (Saved by the Bell) can hear you. \n\nEqually important is a place with good food and drinks. Nothing quite gets a date going as booze right? Remember to always follow Patti Stanger's rule of a two drink max or you may end up like Mr. NSS and I; we have no recollection of our first date other than the hangover we both had the next day. No bueno. \n\nWalking into 20 Spot, I immediately knew this would be THE perfect first date spot. Formerly a record store, 20 Spot has been transformed to small restaurant and wine bar with a contemporary vintage rock ambiance. There's just four 2-top tables, a communal table, and counter seats so do come early to snag a seat as it's a walk-in restaurant: http://bit.ly/1as0tzQ. You can also chill on one of their leather sofas and they even have a vintage rocking chair. Candles and soothing soul music really set the mood if you know what I mean. *Wink wink*\n\nTheir New American menu is small and changes daily. There's less than 10 items on the menu excluding their cheese offerings and dessert. We sampled about half the menu and I have to say, I was very impressed (there were some slight misses though) because they don't have a real kitchen other than several appliances like an immersion circulator, a toaster oven and an induction burner.\n\nWe started off with the Oysters ($3 each) which are a must order: http://bit.ly/1cYy5tr. They were like taking a bite of the fresh ocean breeze. Next, came the Hamachi ($15) served sashimi style: http://bit.ly/174WKYC. Although fresh, I felt some the combo of the leeks, preserved lemon, grapes, espelette overpowered the delicacy of the fish. But this is coming from someone who likes to eat her nigiri with just a dab of wasabi and soy.  \n\nIf you like smoked salmon, you must order their Deviled Eggs ($10) if it's available on the menu: http://bit.ly/1ioEzSn. It was deliciously creamy with a nice pop of saltiness from the cured salmon and roe. And because it's crab season, we couldn't miss the Spiced Potted Dungeness Crab ($18) served with warm toast points: http://bit.ly/1cYo4MQ. It was chockfull of freshly sweet crab meat with just a hint of creaminess from the cr\u00e8me fraiche and zip from the meyer lemon. \n\nNothing sticks to your ribs like a hunk of braised meat and that's what we thought the Farro & Short Ribs ($18) would be but it was more like a porridge: http://bit.ly/1aVGNHk. It was still delicious especially with the decadent soft boiled egg with an oozing yolk and generous shaving of  pecorino but I wish there was more short ribs. \n\nWe ended dinner with the surprisingly and insanely divine Vanilla Panna Cotta ($7): http://bit.ly/1cYp97u. It was a tad stiff but once it hits your tongue, the silkiness was sublime. I adored all the vanilla bean flavor and soon found myself with an empty  jar. *Sad pouty lip*\n\nIn honor of hump day, I had two glasses of wine which the ladies at 20 Spot recommended; both were great. One offered me a tasting of Spanish wine to go with the faro and short ribs fish which was spectacular. I'm a total wine noob so I won't get into the nitty gritty details other than it gave me a good buzz. Two thumbs up from me. \n\n20 Spot may be in hipsterville but there's not a bit of 'tude here. Service was wonderful. The ladies who waited on us were warm, attentive, and knew their sh*t. If I could take them to every restaurant I eat at, I would.  \n\nAs for parking, if the parking gods aren't kind to you, there's a garage 2 blocks away on 21st and Bartlett. \n\nMr. NSS and I are well past our first date but 20 Spot made me feel like we were on a first date again...minus the WtfHappenedLastNight hangover.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

The music was a little loud and the restaurant is a little dark, but both contribute to the classy mood, I suppose. It's a new-ish place. I came here with my friend and we were initially skeptical of the food because it didn't sound all that appetizing. We decided to take a risk and order a few things.\n\nHoly crap. The Deviled Eggs ($10) are to die for. They have trout, roe, and cornichon... words cannot explain how godly these eggs are. Seriously. Hands down my favorite dish of the whole meal. I would go out of my way for these 20 Spot Deviled Eggs anyday. We also ordered the Spanish Octopus ($17) with fingerling potato, castelvetrano olives, and harissa. It was my friend's favorite dish. The quantity of octopus is super generous and the texture is very tender. \n\nBefore I progress further with food, I want to say that the House Wine Flight ($20) was the second best idea next to the deviled eggs. It comes with three different selections, and they matched well with the variety of foods that we ordered. \n\nIn our second round of food, we got the Rainbow Carrots ($13) which was pretty good, and that's coming from a person who does not like carrots. The Lentil Soup ($9) was recommended by our waitress. THAT is the best lentil soup I've ever had. The menu is very counterintuitive because I liked dished that I normally wouldn't order because they did not sound appealing. \n\nAnyways, our meal ended with the must-have Panna Cotta ($8) which was topped with chunks of rhubarb. Light and refreshing. Would recommend. Overall, thank you to our waitress Karina for showing us a fantastic culinary experience! Fantastic recommendations.

The Mission can feel that way, at times.\n3) Great wine selection: my personal favorite is the teutonic from Santa Barbara. The perfect summer drink. Once in a while, they let you taste before settling, but you need not worry if they don't. Every bottle selected for the menu is wonderful. \n4) Pours are generous. If you've been served the bottom of the bottle, they're sure to give a little more.\n5) Wait staff is attentive and charming.\n6) Food is delicious--from the bread plate to the deviled eggs. Please don't come here expecting to get a full dinner experience--this is definitely a wine bar, and the food selections are small portions. (Amazingly delicious small portions.)\n7) The atmosphere is smart and intimate. This is the biggest selling point, for me. I find myself spending an entire evening here, rather than what I'd planned to only be the beginning of my night.\n8) They play their music from a record player. It's a mix of classic rock and indie hits. Off the top of my head, I remember hearing The Cure and The Black Keys in the same night. It's at just the perfect volume to facilitate conversation.\n9) Variety of seating: you can pick a table, a seat by the bar, or even one of two corner sofas. All cozy. \n10) One of the bartenders has begun to remember me. Becoming a regular is the ultimate perk.\n\nI'm away from San Francisco, at the moment, and I can't help but miss this place terribly. I daydream about the riesling, lightly toasted whole grain bread, and orange infused olives. I think I have a problem.", "author": "Nicole C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-28", "description": "20 Spot is a cozy little wine bar perfect for a date or a small group of friends.  A little get together over some wine and small bites after a long day of work is always a nice touch before bed.\n\nFirst time I was here with some friends, and we all fell in love with this cozy place.  We ordered everything on their menu except the salad which they just threw in there for us since that was the only thing missing from the menu on our order.  A couple bottles of wine later, some laughter, and another round of bites we vowed to be back.  That we did.\n\nTheir menu changes quite frequently depending on what they can get their hands on.  There are a couple of things on the menu that were always available every time we've been there.  The oysters are always fresh and a great start to the night with a bottle of champagne or sweet riesling.\n\nI'm a sucker for deviled eggs especially when the flavors and combination of ingredients are endless.  The little kid in me awakens every time I see a different devil to try.  Over here, they make theirs with smoked salmon, trout roe, and cucumber.  Little bites like these always tend to make the bottles go faster as the girls gossip and laugh.  \n\nMussels are steamed with tarragon butter and leeks.  First things first here.  Dip the bread into that tasty butter and indulge in its aroma as your palate salivates for more.  Then reach in for that fresh juicy mussel!  Hate it when a restaurant either overcooks the mussels or serve mussels with a smell.  That won't be happening here.\n\nIt's too bad they don't always have meats on their menu.  When we did get the chance, we were able to have a beautifully braised lamb shank.  Meat falling off the bones with flavors deeply infused.  It melted in our mouths.  Amazing.\n\nI don't want to put up false 411 so someone please let me know if my hunch is correct.  I think they may have changed their chef.  The most recent time I was there, the food seemed a little off or different as a whole.  Not sure.  I hope they didn't change their chef because that would be a sad reason for me not to spend more time at this little gem in the city.\n\nService however can use just a little bit of charm.  The owners, a brother and sister maybe in their 40's, are such kind and friendly people!  Such warm hospitality from them all the time, but their servers don't seem to have that same energy totally misrepresenting the owners' love for their bar.  I've had 4 different servers here, and I always seem to feel rushed or on the other end of their mild irritations... for what I don't know.  What I hear from friends and from other reviews, it seems like others are experiencing the same thing.  It's not too bad but it sure needs a little help.\n\nI agree with some other yelpers about the menu being on the pricey side.  It's not expensive but a bit up there for what they serve.  Not too bad if everyone in your group is splitting the tab.  If you don't mind spending a little more this place is a really great place to wind down.  I'd still come back for the most part unless someone can confirm for me that they changed their chef.  Quality of their dishes aren't spectacular the way I remember the very last time I went.\n\n3.5 stars based on my last visit but overall because of the owners and the handful of times I've been there I have to round up to 4 stars for the fond memories.", "author": "Colin M."}

Small and unassuming, if you didn't know better you'd think this was a simple wine bar. \n\nAu contraire! \n\n The moment I walked in I was greeted warmly and seated at the bar to begin my culinary journey. The bartender was exceptionally knowledgable about the wine list and willing to help me choose the perfect wine. \nI started with the hamachi and cucumber plate. Excellent and well prepared! It danced on the palate and was a very refreshing start to the meal. Next up was the Burrata and red beet salad. The fris\u00e9e was fresh and edible, paired with a huge slice of burrata and garnished with delicious beets made it perfection. The dressing was minimal, which was important because the dish did not need to be overpowered. I finished with the potato and leek soup; I could have licked the bowl! \n Each dish was paired with a perfect wine that was all at the suggestion of one of the owners of this fine establishment. \n Amazing space, delicious food and exciting conversation all made this a special night. \n\nDon't miss out!", "author": "Eden F."}

A delightful little place in the Mission that serves pretty outstanding and shareable items for a large group too!  Sitting just off Valencia, it's pretty easy to miss this little gem - I almost walked right by it thinking it was a furniture store! In any case, there were about 10 of us that showed up to 20 Spot in need of some Friday food and libations and we certainly got it.  Despite trying to say no, I caved and ate a significant portion of the Della Fattoria bread plate by myself.  Three different types of bread showed up, and when slathered with some maldon salt butter, this was hard to say no to.  Other items that showed up on the table were the olives & nuts, deviled eggs, and some grilled octopus. I couldn't stay for very long, but this would be a wonderful place to have a quiet/intimate happy hour with some close friends over some delicious looking wines and bubbly.

When you were so condescending last week to a couple of mild-mannered women regarding a question regarding wine and acidity, did you know you were talking (down) to a well-published, well-reviewed California food and wine writer and scholar?  No, it wasn't I (I wouldn't write that about myself), but my best friend, who deigns to Yelp so I'm doing it for the both of us.  The joke's on you, mister.  You would be well advised to educate yourself on the current debate among California winemakers and sommeliers regarding acidity in wine vis-\u00e1-vis the shaping of \"California\" wine identities.  If you had been privy to the ongoing professional discussion on the topic, you would have known better than to claim that all \"California wine is acidic.\"  If you had known whom you were talking to, you would certainly not have been so condescending (for the record, you should be nice to ALL of your diners, even if they're asking you for White Zinfandel--lack of wine knowledge is not a character flaw, and people come into your establishment to have an enjoyable experience).  A couple other pointers:  1.  It's okay to bring people bread when they're sitting with a half plate of burrata--don't skimp on the toast, son; 2.  If a little fly lands on the wall behind a diner, please don't smash the bug against the wall behind her head and then smear the blood down the wall.

I wouldn't say the entire experience was \"Meh\", but I'm not feeling the \"A-OK\" option either. I've been here twice. Once for dinner and drinks and once for a drink at the bar. The food was really very good. Surprising actually. It was fresh- distinct flavors and great presentation with little treats all over the plates we shared. \n\nHowever, when I took my husband back for a before-dinner drink we had a disappointing experience. One reason why we live in San Francisco is because of the amazing food and drink options and in a town so saturated with amazing spots, I don't know how places get away with bad service. We were served by the owner, no less. He barely gave us the time of day. He said no more than five words to us and was too busy drinking bubbly with some friends to notice if we needed anything. This was disappointing for such a cute, quaint little joint...I'll reconsider going back...bummer!", "author": "Robyn A."}

Take a look inside the Force of Habit record shop, and record shop it is no more!   Its now a snazzy new Mission wine bar.  It was great to check out the space and see the awesome little layout.  There are various intimate seating areas.  The furniture is super trendy and the behind the bar is a huge intricate system for storing the bazillion wines they have.  The food is top-notch wine bar fare - oysters, clever salads, sandwiches and fancy cheeses.  This is going to be one of the Mission's hottest new little night spots for wine lovers.  Great addition to the SF night scene! :-)", "author": "Jaydee B."}

OUr server, Marc, knew his wines really well--he just asked what kind of wine we typically liked and brought us both tastes of very different wines that we both liked. Very cool interior, excellent wine choices by the glass and an even larger selection by the bottle. We didn't have the food, but the people next to us did and it looked great. My guess is this will quickly become a Mission hotspot. A tip: Get there early if you want a table and look for the neon \"Records\" sign outside.", "author": "N B."}

We were told before we came that \"40% of their menu was vegetarian.\" Not!!  We particularly got a good laugh when we were told, when asked what was vegetarian on the menu, that the bread and butter and olives/nuts were good options.We were told by staff beforehand that \"We always have a salad and roasted potatoes with sauce mornay,\" neither of which were on the menu. The roasted king trumpet mushrooms, while tasty and priced like a full meal, was smaller than a tapa.\n\nThe cheese plate was quite good - but there is not much you can do wrong with a cheese plate.\n\nThe burrata beet salad had to be returned; it was difficult to find the tiny beets buried under the plate of mashed cheese.\n\nAnd... this was one of the noisiest restaurants we've been in.\n\nOn the positive side, the wait staff were attentive, friendly and tried hard to please.\n\nTo conclude, this is really a wine bar with a few light snacks and limited options of small portion main dishes. Don't expect to make a full meal out of it.  Unfortunately you will have already paid for a full meal by the time you leave, but  the good news is you can go around the corner and get a great burrito or a fantastic dosa for a fraction of the price. 20 Spot needs to decide what it wants to be: either provide a real dinner menu or just provide the bar bites and price them accordingly.", "author": "Joseph S."}

They did such a great job on every detail.  The wine list, fantastic.  I would expect nothing else from the owner of our favorite Russian Hill wine bar.  The food, light, refreshing, packed with flavor.  We tried a sampling of a good percentage of the menu.  Oysters, so fresh and delicious sauces on the side.  The cheese place was beautiful and every element added a punch.  I especially loved the pickled vegetables. The razor clams, a first for me, were amazing.  I could have eaten 5 more plates of them!  Every dish had such care and so much flavor.  Great spot!", "author": "Jaime C."}

The consensus: deftly curated wines in a cozy-artistic-funky-musical setting with unique and delicious small plates/ smaller hot dishes. Seriously, the attention to detail is something to behold. Even the WC is dope. Their crew is fun and attentive and will definitely help you choose the right wine for the right moment/mood/dish. The menu changes up a bit, too. The clams and pearls is one of my current favorites and always the burrata, oh and the house cured caviar, delicate! Deserts always hit the spot (get it).

A good friend of mine took my to 20 Spot to celebrate my birthday   I wasn't expecting much.   But to my surprise it was better than great.  We shared my absolute favorite oyster \"Boh Solei\".  Small, super flavorful, slightly briny, not creamy, and served with a homemade hot sauce and vinegaret.  Pared with some bubbly champaign suggested by a lovely host Bodhi Then we shared King Trumpet Mushrooms with artichokes and a Bernaisse Sauce which was out of this world party in your mouth good, pared with a lovely Pinot.  Our next dish was a potted crab which was a pot of cleaned succulent crab ready to eat. No mess, and served with perfectly toasted crusty French bread. It was so YUM!  Oh and the salad of baby fresh crispy hearts of Jem leaves with a fresh mozzarella cheese was divine.  I was full but wanted to try the soup which was our last dish. The butter bean soup with chunks of bacon (the candy of meats). It was was amazing. Of course more wine,  a Cab Franc which I loved.  Deserts because it was my birthday... but there wasn't room left to eat it.  If you haven't been there you are in for a treat!  It a great place to get Amazing Food in a a comfortable great atmosphere with a lovely host \"Bodhi\", who knows his wines and a place.  Ladies this would be a place I would feel comfortable going by myself   It was warm and inviting yet chic.  I definitely will be going back with another friend.
