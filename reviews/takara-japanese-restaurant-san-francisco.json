We luxuriated on melt-in-your-mouth toro, crunched through the great giant clam, and the uni from northern Japan was so good that I had to steam one of Julie's pieces when she wasn't looking. \n\nThe service was also a big step up from the past.

Paired with the sauce, it was a delicious dish. The octopus was firm and chewy. \n\nFor my main, I got the three item combination dinner, and chose the tempura, salmon teriyaki, and pork cutlet. The dinner came with many side dishes, including an egg custard (quite yummy) and miso soup. The pork cutlet was tough and hard to chew. The salmon teriyaki was small in size and very average. Nothing special about the tempura. \n\nFor dessert, I chose the green tea ice cream. It was okay, not nearly as creamy or milky as I prefer. \n\nMy friend ordered the eel, and I think this dish was much better than the one I got.

I've heard good things about the omakase spot down the hall, and the ice cream place everyone raves about downstairs is edible but nothing to write home about. Bottom line is: my pocketbook can afford to keep me coming back here and the quality of this restaurant will surely do that.\n\nThe sign outside read, \"no fusion.\" For once, it didn't lie. The waiter was polite and prompt. Ordered the two dish combination. It comes with an assortment of small dishes.\n\nWhat I enjoy about this place is that no single dish is over-the-top french fusion caviar too rich to eat. It's all just mom's cooking, and it's good. The steamed egg uses real chicken stock, not that crap out the box your lazy ass keeps buying. It's full of real chicken. I mean real chicken, not chicken breast. You know, the kind with brown meat and flavor. There's also a mini-shrimp and a mushroom. Exactly what you wanna when you order this dish.\n\nMiso soup was standard. Seaweed (the thick kind). Pickled vegetables were there, but I've never really been a fan. And I never remember having those salads with orange thousand island while in Japan, but hey, they are serving Americans. In any case you can choose not to eat it. The rice was sweet and properly cooked. Everything you would want.\n\nThe sashimi was the appropriate temperature and cut to the correct proportion. I don't know why that's so difficult for most sushi chefs to get right in SF, but these guys nailed it. Also, the serving size was just right for a five dish combo (I think there were seven pieces). Only thing lackluster here was that fake green kind of wasabi. But at an everyday kind of restaurant, I guess I can really expect fresh wasabi. In fact, I don't think I've even seen real wasabi get used in SF, even at that overpriced one-kind-of-sushi-omakase served at akiko, the chefs only use the green paste.\n\nTempura was a classic finish to the meal. Light and crispy on the outside and cooked to perfection on the inside.\n\nI think the only thing I was disappointed by during my visit to this lovely neighborhood restaurant was the lack of dobinmoshi on the menu.\n\nTo recap, this restaurant just didn't make a wrong turn, like nearly every other restaurant in SF does. And at SF prices, there better not be any oops I served you warm sushi mistakes. I'm really not sure why Yelp only gives this place 3 stars. All I can come up with is that yelp reviewers are fickle and don't judge a restaurant on its food. You guys tend to send me to fancy looking places that play house music and taste like shit, serving me $30 plates prepared by a donkey that's never tasted the frozen seafood s/he serves his/her customers. I wish you guys who don't know what real foods is, who don't cook for a living or in your spare time, would stop reviewing; you're fauxing up our restaurant culture. But this place is really the only restaurant I will return to in Japantown. I highly recommend it if you enjoy real Japanese food.", "author": "JWest M."}

Now, it seems to be the opposite with many diners looking to grab a quick, inexpensive bite to eat before or after they see a movie down the street. My Mom grew up in SF Japantown and this area has has a long, rich, and genuine culinary history.  \n\nWhen the Chef/Owner of Aka Tombo (formerly of Yamato) unfortunately passed away unexpectedly a few years ago it marked a turning point for the neighborhood and what used to be inexpensive stables in Japanese and Asian Pacific Islander cuisine, ramen and poke,  suddenly became contemporary hipster, along with the prices, sigh. \n\nYou really can't go wrong dining at Takara! They have one section that's an awesome sushi bar and another that's a full on restaurant and, for over past decade I've had the pleasure of dining at both and have never been disappointed. I love the combination lunches and dinners at the restaurant and their tempura is truly out of this world!\n\nLast month we decided to give the sushi bar at Takara another go and were totally stoked! The head Sushi Chef Ken really knew his fish and made brilliant recommendations. He and his staff were warm, cordial, knowledgable and gave amazing insights into Japan and it's culture, which I totally appreciated being 1/2 Japanese American. \n\nThe Hirame was perfection personified! Fresh, delicate, and enticing. So much so that we devoured 3 whole orders!\n\nI LOVED their Saba Sushi! It wasn't \"fishy\" tasting and the pieces were prepared with only the the tenderest cuts on top of the rice!\n\nMy favorite has always been the Ama Ebi. OMG, it's so sweet and delicious! What's more, Sushi Chef Ken gave me the option of them preparing the shrimp head either in a miso soup or coking it tempura. I love me my deep fried shrimp heads and I wish I ordered a few more!\n\nWhat truly stood out at Takara's Sushi Bar was their Unagi. I've had eel and then I've REALLY had eel! Golly, this was the divinely buttery and fragrant! Truly outstanding!\n\nWhat more can I say but Takara is now our official \"GO TO\" authentic Japanese Sushi Bar and Restaurant in SF Japantown!

Her condition now keeps her from being able to keep food down but she is still able to enjoy the taste. \nShe lived for many years in Japan and learned to speak Japanese fluently. When she moved to San Francisco a dozen years ago, she discovered Takara and enjoyed many lunches and dinners there.\nSadly, she is now so weak that she can't walk. As someone who loved Japanese cuisine, in the past couple of weeks she's asked for chawan mushi, which is quintessential Japanese comfort food. It's steamed egg custard with small amounts of mushrooms, gingko nuts, pieces of meat, etc. mixed in. A week ago I had called Takara and spoke to a waitress asking if I could get chawan mushi as a take-out. She said no, it was only available in the restaurant. (The reason is that it's made in a ceramic bowl.) Last night I walked by the restaurant. I explained the situation. Owner Hiro gave me a steaming ceramic cup with a cover and said \"I'm pretty sure that I know your mom. Tell her I'm so sorry and that's it's on us. Just return the bowl and cover, when you can.\" I nearly started crying. When I went to show her, she was dozing. But I gently woke her and asked if she wanted to taste it now or tomorrow. She replied without hesitation, \"right now!\" She was so happy. Her happiness means everything to me. Thank you, Hiro and Takara.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-05", "description": "Of all of the restaurants that I've tried in and around Japantown, Takara is one of the most divisive among my friends (New Korea House would be another).  The two times we've been here, the same issue has popped up - decent food, but why are some items so expensive?  And this isn't even counting the first time we tried coming here, when my friends walked up, saw the prices, and walked away.\n\nCost aside, Takara's menu is actually one of the more interesting ones Japantown has to offer.  Beyond the usual slate of bento boxes, udon/soba, donbouri, and sashimi/nigiri/rolls (which is what we had the first time, about four years ago), there are more authentic and unique items, like onigiri, ochazuke (rice in soup), and zousui (rice porridges).  \n\n-- SPIDER ROLL - Deep Fried Soft Shell Crab...$9.50\n-- ROCK & ROLL - Unagi and Avocado...$6.00\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/takara-japanese-restaurant-san-francisco?select=spIuS38sLgZJwfHhO92E4A)\nNeither were bad, but they weren't very notable either.  Both were pretty standard for the most part, though the unagi in the Rock & Roll was pretty decent.  The Spider Roll also had a shiso leaf in it, but I thought that actually was more distracting than anything else.\n\n-- OYAKO ZOUSUI - Salmon and Salmon Roe Porridge...$13.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/takara-japanese-restaurant-san-francisco?select=HcemjcGTz_JaVlc87-pKlQ)\nNot only was this the whole point of coming back (and to write this review), but this is the only reason why I'd come back.  On such a cold, foggy night, this was perfect - hot, filling, and subtly flavorful.  What's more, it had a fairly generous amount of salmon and roe.  Yum.\n\nAs for what I had the first time I came here, it was a few years back.  For the most part, we stuck with sushi and sahimi - Negitoro, Spicy Hotate, Hamachi Sashimi, Aoyagi (Surf Clam) Sashimi, and Mentai Onigiri (Spicy Cod Roe).  The exact details of everything we had escape me, but from what I recall, while the sashimi was fresh, everything else wasn't very memorable.\n\nWhile the food falls somewhere between three and four stars, the prices really are a buzzkill.  Some things are priced pretty typically (like our rolls), but $16.75 for a Rainbow Roll?  $18.75 for a spicy Dragon Roll?  As much as I appreciate how authentic some of the food is, these aren't exactly budget friendly prices!  Since they aren't easy to find though, I'll be back for the zousui and perhaps the ochazuke.  Otherwise, I don't think I'd come back for anything else.", "author": "Mike L."}

The food is more traditional Japanese rather than the newer Americanized style noodle and sushi dishes you will find in the more recent J-Town eateries.  My favorite dishes at Takara are the Chawan-Mushi, Miso Cod, Tempura, Teriyaki Bento, and Yosenabe. The food is fresh, well prepared and presented attractively.  The staff is attentive and unobtrusive.\n\nTakara is my Japanese boyfriend's favorite restaurant in Japantown.

Takara pretty much serves the whole spectrum of a Japanese restaurant, from your typical terikiyaki dinner combination, sushi, ramen to donburis and traditional porridge. To sum it up, my $17 pork katsu dinner paired with some nigiri, overcooked chawan mushi, and udon wasn't quite worth the $50 price tag for a painfully average tasting meal. \n\nService was okay, although the interior of the restaurant felt pretty sad and empty.

She brought them the ice cream and the check, and continued to ignore us. \n\nWe contemplated leaving without paying, as it had been half an hour since we finished our food. Eventually, after the other family left, I decided to go get another server (an older lady), who took care of us from that point on.  This second server was extremely courteous and quickly brought us the check.  The first server kept going by, refusing to make eye contact.

The lights were on, but no one was home. \n\nFood: \"mediocure and boring\" is a description by another reviewer, and it is TRUE. Nothing BAD, nothing really GOOD. Shawanmushi is for me a nice & -not- common dish, however it has devolved @ Takara.... thin on the ingredients ( where was the ginko nut?, the shrimp ?... ). It has been a valued Takara tradition, it now is a disappointing \"going through the motions\" dish. Not expecting culinary revelations, I had hoped for a glimmer of \"that was good\". Shawanmushi @ Takara is a disappointment. \n\nService: While IMa very very FAR from a \"new-age\" - \"energy\" \"sensitive\", Takara pulled my mood down to \"HO HUM\", mainly due to the sad faces & demeanor of the servers. While certain that it is no fault of theirs, it affected me. Its the same faces you might see in communist countries where \"workers\" are conscripted.\n\nJTown (this \"mall\") which includes the Mifune outlet that was mentioned above was sold a couple of a years ago, and I'm wondering if the businesses are just: \"maximizing profit...hanging on..get what we can\" kinda feel.

Hell, it's the Japanese restaurant that the Japan Center forgot, and it's slipping from my memory as I write this review. Next to the neck massage place, it's in that semi-hidden hallway in the Miyako Mall which provides a shortcut for guests of the Hotel Kabuki. That means locals like me barely notice it in the distance unless they have a hankering for standard-issue Japanese food or need a neck massage. I'll write about the former, but somebody else can tell me how the massage place is. Jamie W. and I came here simply because it's probably the only place I had not eaten at in the entire complex. Gee, that's a lousy reason to patronize a place, but they had teriyaki on the menu and Jamie was game.\n\nIt was surprisingly popular the evening we went though not so much by my people if you know what I'm saying. Let's just say the chicken teriyaki was a popular item that night. The robust menu is eight pages long, so it's not like it was the only thing they served. This didn't stop Jamie who ordered the $16.95 Chicken Teriyaki Dinner, which came with an appetizer, miso soup, rice, savory egg custard, pickles and dessert (photo: http://bit.ly/1MODkdh). As far as I could tell, I think the accompanying salad was acting as the appetizer, and the custard was like a naked chawan-mushi bereft of any shrimp, mushrooms or any other ingredient you would expect to find in it (photo: http://bit.ly/1GC1U1L). Jamie immediately pushed it to me since he didn't like the texture. Finger-burning, yes, but blandly comforting as well.\n\nThe chicken teriyaki itself was a generous serving but rather overwhelmed by the sweet sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1TgvQE8). I think I fared better with the $23 Two-Item Takara Dinner Set since I went for the Salmon Teriyaki and the Grilled Mackerel. Same accessories for me even, more custard for me and for some reason, the salmon didn't seem quite as overrun with the sauce much to my benefit. It was a pretty decent-size cut as well (photo: http://bit.ly/1GC1OqX). Even so, the mackerel, an unadorned as it was, turned out to be the highlight of my meal (photo: http://bit.ly/1FYcFVB). Meanwhile, Jamie was downing a mini-bottle of the Sho Chiku Bai Nigori Unfiltered Sake to counteract the sweetness of the sauce. Also he likes sake. I don't know when that started happening. Anyway, the obligatory scoop of Green Tea Ice Cream ended our meal (photo: http://bit.ly/1cQ2GKJ). What was the name of this place again?\n\nFOOD - 3 stars....like I said, standard-issue Japanese doesn't really make this destination dining....may I suggest the mackerel?\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...speaking of standard issue though roomier than most in the Japan Center\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...a little too rushed at the beginning followed by long pauses at the end\nTOTAL - 3 stars...if the Japan Center was a theatrical movie, then Takara would be the 6th sneak preview before the main feature", "author": "Ed U."}

I ended up adding a lot of soy sauce to the broth which made it a lot better. The noodles were amazing and very filling. I wish there was a little more beef and vegetables in there as well. Needless to say, successful spot to get a big bowl of udon.", "author": "Alisha K."}

But Takara actually seems pretty authentic (read: there are a significant number of Japanese people who eat there), rather than an overpriced tourist trap.\n\nMy friend and I split a grilled mackerel dinner set and a salmon avocado roll, which turned out to be the perfect amount of food at a decent price. The grilled mackerel was fatty, greasy, and delicious, yet still seemed fairly healthy in the way that only fish can be. The dinner set also comes with some fun side dishes and appetizers, which were pretty tasty. The salmon avocado roll was fresh and well-made, and paired well with our set.\n\nService is friendly and fast, and it seems like the staff is mostly Japanese. There's a quiet and casual vibe so it's a nice place to hang out or chat. It sounds obvious, but this is a good place to get some authentic and affordable Japanese food in Japantown.", "author": "Brittany C."}

It's actually really close to the Hotel Kabuki and Daiso. My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a try for lunch on Saturday, and we weren't the only ones who were out and about! The entire front area of the restaurant was filled up when we arrived at noon, but there were still some tables in the rear area. They seated is the corner which was a bit concerning because I thought they would forget about us, but it ended up being fine.\n\nI ordered the vegetable udon set with a mini chirashi (sashimi on top of rice), and my boyfriend had the lunch set with the fried oysters and tonkatsu. An older lady brought us both miso soup and tsukemono (pickles), and gave my boyfriend his rice. You rarely see Japanese pickles so I was super excited!! Two minutes later my chirashi arrived which was ridiculously quick, but I think it was because the sushi chefs were ready to go =) The fish was quite good and tasted fresh; I loved how they added a substantial pile of ginger, but the tamago (egg) wasn't too good. The rice underneath was vinegared which was surprising but tasty. The aforementioned miso soup had great flavor, and we also each received a cup of hot green tea without even having to ask!\n\nMy mini vegetable udon arrived before my boyfriend's food. I was still working on my chirashi and miso soup when it was placed in front of me lol. The veggies were tasty: spinach, mushrooms, various greens, and the noodles were delicious and perfectly chewy. The broth had a subtle fishy undertone which was weird when I first took a sip but it wasn't bad after awhile. My BF's tonkatsu arrived and it was perfect! The cutlet was uniformly cut and the breading was light and delicious. The fried oysters were delicious as well, but be careful when you bite into them because they are extremely hot in temperature! The side salad was a refresher after all the fried food.\n\nThe cuisine here is a lot closer to legit Japanese food than the other restaurants in the restaurant row area. I'd come back here for lunch for sure! The waiters/waitresses are quick to bring you your food, but they can take a bit longer to bring you your check.

Restaurant was average - no frills, minimal ambiance, average quality food, that is a little pricey.  Captive clientele from nearby hotel.  Where else would a traveler go if you don't have a car, don't speak the language, and want something that reminds you of home?\n\nThe restaurant fulfills the demands of clientele expecting the full gamut of Japanese cuisine:  Grilled Items, Steamed Items, Raw Items, Rolls, etc.  Although each item we ordered fell short of expectations.  \n\nWe had the Grilled Ika / Squid Appetizer which could have benefitted from more grilling to add more flavor.  The squid was fully cooked of course but lacked that grilled taste.  We also had the Miso Cod Appetizer - a properly cooked fish but overly miso'ed.  The Agadashi Tofu Appetizer was very disappointing - sauce was thick and cornstarchy with only 4 small pieces.\n\nThe 30 piece Sashimi platter was fresh with a good variety of fish...although slices could be a little bigger.  Dragon Roll was nothing special....\n\nWe ordered approximately $70 worth of food for three people - multiple appetizers, sashimi platter, sushi roll....and did not receive any complimentary soup or salad.

That said, I'd like to think that as a family we know our Japanese food. My grandmother has been to Takara twice with me and she says they have the best udon noodles in Japan Town.   \n\nAs for me I've dined here three times. The first time I ordered nabeyaki udon which was phenomenal. I took the extra step and asked how they cook it. Apparently they actually cook it inside the cast iron bowl, which is rare these days. Most places will cook the udon in a regular stainless steel pot, then serve it in the iron bowl. I appreciate the more traditional touch and I could definitely taste the difference. This was by far the best nabeyaki udon I've had outside of visiting Japan. I've also had their sashimi, teriyaki salmon, teriyaki chicken, salmon shioyaki, tempura, and fried oysters. \n\nTwo of the main reasons I like this place are location and culture. It's located on the other side of Japan Town and more away from the tourists and also a little more secluded.  As for culture, the servers are mostly (if not all) Japanese, and the clientele is consistently at least 1/2 Japanese. There's something to be said for an ethnic restaurant with these two characteristics because, and I'm making assumptions here, the food is more likely to be \"authentic.\" \n\nI'll end with saying that this place has been busy all three times I've been so be prepared to wait.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-07-08", "description": "When it comes to sushi, I tend to separate places into two categories: casual and special. The \"casual\" is a place with good quality sushi at a reasonable price. That's really all it takes, and I'll be back on a fairly regular basis as long as things are kept consistent. The \"special\" places are much more expensive - usually in the $50 per person range, at least - but you're very much paying for quality. If I find these places, I typically won't go often, but I will make it a point to go occasionally.\nLocally, I have my \"casual\" place already marked, though I do continually seek out new ones, both in other cities and locally. This may be my new SF casual sushi spot.\nI stumbled upon it after finding other places inside this little shopping center closed on Monday. Admittedly, I came for lunch and only had two sushi items. They have a \"lunch box\" on their menu, which includes a choice of one entree item, miso, rice, a half California roll, salad and tempura. All this is $8.50. They have a variety of lunch specials though, including several with much more fish, for just a couple of dollars more. The entree items included teriyaki, katsu and - what I found to be the best option - albacore sashimi.\nThe place is set up like any other Japanese restaurant. I believe there's a sushi bar at the back, and the rooms are decorated with the typical lanterns and screens. There is a row of tables that faces the window out to the mall, which itself faces a nice garden area outside. The restroom is behind the restaurant, in another hallway.\nI found it somewhat reassuring to hear the servers speaking Japanese to one another, and many of the patrons coming in speaking Japanese with the staff. It may be a bit judgmental, but I do this a lot with any sort of ethnic food, and I don't think I'm the only one who does. It's quite popular. I got there at about 11:40, and there was a wait for a table within 30 minutes.\nThe service was excellent. The food came out relatively quickly, and the staff were attentive. My soup and rice came out first, very quickly. I appreciated that, even though I'm white, they didn't give me a spoon for the miso, which I think is silly.\nThough I know it's not \"authentic sushi,\" I'm a sucker for a good California roll, and this was a good one. Not only that, but the sashimi was also quite good. Much better than I expected for a lunch under $10. The tempura featured a shrimp, a carrot, a zucchini, a sweet potato, and (IIRC) a mushroom, and was served with tempura sauce.\nI left very satisfied. More satisfied than I'd been with a lunch in a long time. It was almost too much food, it was very cheap compared to most of San Francisco's restaurants, and the service was quick and friendly.\nAnd that leads me to the five stars: I just can't find anything for which to knock off. It was all so good. Though it's a bit off the typical track, I would make it a point to come here next time.", "author": "Colin G."}

The end where the old Miyako Hotel (now called something else) is. \n\nTheir set bento box lunch is oh so oishii http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=oishi. For $7.50 you get to choose one item like your standard terriyaki chicken for instance. I got the fried fish, but if you are really hungry go for the chicken. It also comes with the standard little goodies like California roll, salad, miso soup, rice and tempura. \n\nThe decor is pretty typical for the Japanese restaurants around here. Little cozy rectangular booths. The tea was hot and refilled quickly and the tempura was crispy, light and no oily aftertaste. \n\nIf you spend $30 on your tab (excluding tip & tax), you get one hour of validated parking in the garage. So, lessay there are four of you, then at least you can get one hour of free parking. \n\nGood food and you can practice your Japanese here too!", "author": "Tiffany K."}

I reviewed Takara just last week and gave them a pretty decent review and rating for their lunch, but after tonight's dinner experience, I just had to update and let everyone know that Takara, in a nutshell, isn't really as great as people make it out to be.\n\nI had a dinner planning meeting with a couple of fellow Board members this evening at Takara, and the service was just, simply put, bad. As slow as it was in the restaurant, there isn't any rationale for the unfriendly or uninviting service that we received. Our server checked in on us once for the whole night. And when she did, I almost turned to stone when she scowled at me for asking for another side of ginger for my sashimi platter. Who knew Madusa was Japanese?\n\nThe food, however, was was still good. I had the sashimi dinner platter, which comes with miso, rice, a couple of other side dishes, and dessert. it filled me up, and is definitely worth the $20.95. \n\nOH! I almost forgot! When we got our check, tip percentages were hand written on the bottom of the receipt... I mean, I get it. I'm a server/bartender myself, and tipping is important. but when you hand write what 15% and what 18% of my total bill on the bottom of the receipt for me... that's just tacky.\n\n1) It's indirectly undermining my ability to do simple arithmetic, and\n2) You're assuming i WOULDN'T tip you the 15-18% to begin with.\n\nKudos to the kitchen and sushi chefs.

After years living in San Francisco, I could never make sense of it.\n\nYet, there is something about traveling to Japantown with its easy underground parking, its quirky shops including great bookstore, incense and teapot shop, Hello Kitty store, Cherry Blossom festival and Japanese paper goods store, that keeps us inexplicably coming back over and over again.\n\nSo if you find yourself vering to Japantown's Kintetsu Mall, then Takara with its bento boxes, tasty food and access to Japantown is a very solid lunch choice.  Its one of only a handful of good restaurants in Japantown (Maki, Ino Sushi and Sophie's Crepes are your best choices.) At lunch, Takara is particularly affordable (not so much at dinner) and worth a visit, although service is often spotty  --sometimes brisk, always overwhelmed and plates are typically not cleared until after you pay your bill.\n\nTakara lunch boxes and bento boxes are pretty darn tasty, fun for kids, and an incredible deal, considering maybe you may want to save your pennies for some other great momentos, artwork or anime.", "author": "Rachel H."}

Yes, Takara does offer those items, but also has rice, noodle, nabe (hot pot) and soup dishes along with grilled and fried items.  Most of the dishes come with miso soup, pickles, appetizer, rice, dessert and my favorite, chawanmushi, a steamed egg custard with bits of vegetables and chicken or fishcake.  I do enjoy the quality of the food and find the portion sizes to be more than generous.  This establishment is Japanese owned and reminds me of some of the meals I experienced in Japan.  \n\nThe service (not the wait staff) has always been an issue for me here.  Dishes are not always ready at the same time.  On this latest visit my dish, the Yosenabe (seafood, meat and vegetables cooked in a broth), arrived about 10 minutes after all the other main course arrived.  On prior visits the dishes either took a long time to arrive or they arrived at separate times. The waitstaff does a great job of checking in and letting us know that the missing dish(es) are coming, which I very much appreciate.  In most cases, this really isn't much of an issue but I have noticed that this happens fairly often.  I guess I'm willing to overlook this as I keep coming back to enjoy their food.  \n\nThe restaurant does fill up, but mostly after 7 pm.", "author": "Melissa L."}

We came across Takara as being the only one opened in the East Mall of Japan Center.\n\nI remember the restaurant having typical diner decor, nothing really stood out in terms of style or decoration. The place was fairly small and very busy. The atmosphere was very casual - a mix of tourists and residents. We were greeted and seated immediately by staff and the waitress took our orders right away. The food came quickly and the waitress was very attentive to our table, refilling our drinks and taking away our courses as we finished them. The food was average. I had the Katsu Don lunch and there wasn't anything spectacular about it. It was good but not the best I ever had. The portion size was also very good and filled me up right up until dinner.\n\nOverall, my experience at this restaurant was ok. if you are in the neighbourhood and are looking for a place to eat (particularly a Japanese restaurant) during lunch I would recommend this place.

My review might be a little biast just because I finally found a place that does actual shio yakitori and the waiter understood what that meant 3 star dish! They also rock out a decent +1 point maguro yamakake - yea its small, but its under appetizer so anyone who expects more needs to get real. Got a nice quail egg in addiiton to some nice pieces of ahi in there. only thing they didn't have was a shiso...3.5 star dish. Had the Wafu steak ( aka daikon steak) 3.5 stars, was not impressed, but the dish was in line with my expectations and ordered mostly to make sure that I was full. They have some nice Jazz playing and a very nice sushi bar. Atmosphere is comfortably casual and you can have a decent conversation there. \n\nHonestly a 3.5 denotes bad food or something was wrong, but nothing was wrong and the food was decent, so I'll say 4 stars just because they didn't do anything worth degrading the restaurant.

All of the elements (fish, shiso garnish, etc) were there, but there was no care for how it looked - it was just hunks of meat in a box. Takara, did you get a new sushi chef?  What happened?  I'm so sad.\n\nThe quality of the tuna (maguro) was the most disappointing.  The texture was mealy and crumbly - marginally better quality than what you would get with sushi at an American supermarket or an all you can eat pan-Asian buffet.  Ick. The other fish were just ok, but what I would expect from a $10 chirashi instead of the $17 we paid.  None of the fish, except for the salmon (sake), which is super fatty anyway, had that \"melt in your mouth\" quality that I looked forward to with the sashimi at Takara.\n\nTo be fair, the ebi and the tamago were pretty good still, and the tako was cooked nicely as usual (tender, not horrible and rubbery like at most places).\n\nMy aunt said that sashimi is out of season, so maybe I should cut Takara some slack, but it doesn't explain the crappy presentation of the food. Also, if the food continues to be this mediocre, then the so-so service needs to improve to make up for it (waitress from Japan with blond hair - I'm talking about you).  I should saved some money and gotten sashimi at Nijiya Market this time. :(", "author": "Lisa M."}

It's not high concept, style de jour, or artsy Japanese food, but rather sort of home-style, one level above okazu Japanese comfort food, with nice little flourishes like the little bowl of chawanmushi (the savory egg custard that Venerable Mom used to make you when you were sick which showed you how much Venerable Mom loved you) served at the start of the meal.\n\nAnd the entrees at tonight's meal were all competently prepared from quality ingredients with Venerable Mom's tempura being crisp and grease free with a generous quantity of shrimp, Shorty's unajyu having a generous portion of first-rate unagi, and my taramiso having the requisite scorching and not being excessively salty.\n\nWhat cost the place a star and actually makes us wonder whether we need to start looking for a new \"old reliable\" is the indifferent chaotic service.\n- Venerable Mom's Tempura was dumped on the table at the same time we received our chawanmushi and before the misoshiru or salad were served. \n- The waiter dropped a spoon into tempura dipping sauce, disappeared for an extended period before returning with another spoon and never getting around to wiping up the splashed sauce.\n- The waiter dropped the check off at the table and disappeared before returning and asking if we wanted the included-in-the-meal ice cream or anything else.\n\nThere were plenty of empty tables so it wasn't like they were overworked or stretched too thin. Perhaps we missed the memo regarding finding somewhere else to eat.", "author": "Ed T."}

Authentic, check! \n\nI got Yakizakana dinner - grilled salted salmon. The salmon was well seasoned. Not too salty. Good taste. The rice covered with a lid to keep it warm. The miso soup, salad and dressing were all good. But what really made me happy were the small bowl of chawamushi  (savory cup of custard) and takuan (the yellow pickle). Can't remember when was the last time I saw these two guys in a dinner set in SF, probably never. Overall everything was well-balanced seasoned and well prepared. I'll definitely go back again and try something else. 5 stars for the food. Authentic, check! \n\nThe service was OK. The servers were very polite but they were too busy. We have to wait several minutes to get my server. So I minus 1 star here. I saw two customers waiting at the door at around 6:30p in Monday evening. One waited for about 5 minutes, no one came to take her to the seat, and she left. The other one waited for 10 minutes, the same result. Then I started to see people lining up.

I instantly knew the sushi wasn't going to taste good when I saw the ginger was fluorescent pink (not the \"true\" cream color it should be). The lunch was relatively expensive and the options were quite obtuse. Like, I couldn't order any lunchtime combinations with maki rolls. I found that a bit weird. My meal was miso soup, 5 pieces of nigiri, and a side order of spider roll. \n\nThe nigiri was decent; it wasn't horrible by any standards but again, the ginger was poor. The spider roll was the worst excuse for a sushi roll I have ever seen and tasted. The individual parts of the roll were so large I literally could not fit each piece into my mouth in one bite. The roll had two layers of rice. TWO LAYERS! Nothing of substance was stuffed in the middle either.\n\n I liked how the restaurant brought around green tea constantly; that was nice.\n\nIn short, there are much better sushi restaurants in Japan Town; I wouldn't come back again. $50 for shitty lunchtime sushi just doesn't make sense to me.", "author": "Tommy C."}

So there is always some comfort for me to know there is real Japanese influence, rather than so many Korean and Chinese owned Japanese restaurants in the city. I was afraid that it was Korean owned, because I saw the long list of sushi rolls in the front of the menu, usually a dead give-away. But nowadays, many middle of the road Japanese restaurants have to  offer a lot of rolls because most Americans or younger American born Asian customers expect it. If they travelled to Japan, they would be disappointed. It is so much easier to mask old fish in a roll with Jack-in-the-Box secret sauce dripping all over it's tempura fried ingredients than to serve fresh sashimi or nigiri to Americans.  \n\nWe came and just got a bento dinner combo.

They were not served in a big bento tray, but in separate dishes, which I prefer, but is not as easy for the restaurant to serve and clean up.  It was a Friday night, so the service was a little slow from the kitchen and a bit hectic out front.\n\nThe combo dinner came with the 2 pickled tsukemono dishes, a covered bowl of rice, miso soup, and ice cream for dessert. The nice extra was the Chawan Mushi, which is unusual for most places to serve, and gives you another idea this is more Japanese than your average Japanese restaurant, which isn't necessarily Japanese anymore. Chawan Mushi is a light, hot, egg custard served here in a large tea cup (often with a hat on it). This one had sliced pieces of kamaboko (fish cake) and shiitake mushrooms and other goodies.

It would have been helpful had they told us before they seated us that we were going to be so rushed but since we had already settled down, we just stayed. Plus the waitress was still really nice and apologetic about rushing us.\n\nAfter looking at the menu for 10 seconds, I ordered their Miso Ramen. It was decent, not terrible but nothing spectacular.  Being in J-town and with so much competition, you'd hope that the ramen would blow your mind but it was just good enough.

While it was okay it was really cafeteria food, felt like cattle in a feed lot. It wasn't cheap either. I know it then closed for a time, but then opened with new management and chef. What a difference!\nIt's the sort of place that gets the details correct, something a lot of places don't bother with. Recently had lunch there and it was rather hot outside. So when they served us tea, it was iced tea, how thoughtful and unexpected!  They also give oshibori with dinner. With the dinner combination they give you a great selection of items, including chawan mushi, done very well.\nProbably my favorite dish is the tekka don, slices of excellent sashimi over sushi rice with all of the trimmings. Not cheap, but so satisfying!\nAlso had the sukiyaki here, which you cook on a table top unit. When you first look at all of the stuff packed into the sukiyaki pan you don't see how it could taste like much. But it cooks quickly, and thanks to their delicious sauce it was an amazing meal, probably one of the best I've ever had.\nSo if you get a chance visit Takara, they have a large menu, good variety, and delicious food.

They did not skimp out on the veggies either--tons of shitake mushrooms, thinly sliced yellow onions, and green onions topped with a smattering of seawood. The sauce the donburi was simmered in was delicious. Sweet and flavorful, just like it's supposed to be. \n\nMy mom ordered the special lunch obento where for $6.95 it came with soup, rice, salad, 3 California rolls, nicely battered and fried tempura, and a choice of entree; my mom got the white tuna sashimi.

The tempura was good, though. \n\nThe combo meal came with some sort of seaweed salad (I think that's what it was... the seaweed was chopped into little rice-like pieces and tasted like beef jerky, which reminds me of dog-food flavor). I've never had anything like it at other Japanese restaurants and don't know if it's traditional or not but I would pass on it next time. \n\nA nice surprise was the fact that my combo came with vanilla or green tea ice cream at the end. I chose the green tea and asked for it to-go, since we were staying at the hotel next door and wanted to wrap up our dinner and head back after a long day. The same guy acted like that was unheard of, saying that it was really small and I could eat it there. He ended up bringing it out to me in a to-go carton anyways and I enjoyed it in the luxury of my jet tub, although it tasted funky and made me wish I had gotten the vanilla instead.

We also ordered Sake Onigiri  (rice ball) and it was good too. However, the menu was a bit overwhelming, there was a lot in it. What I was really looking for was a firecracker roll, but I was disappointed by their lack of variety when it came to the specialty rolls. \n\nThey were pretty busy, but we got our food in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nMy biggest complaint?

The service was ok. They were attentive but definitely forgot a few things here and there. That could be blamed on the restaurant being busy. \n\nWe ordered the Vegetable Tempura Udon Soup which was a good idea at first, but then the crispy tempura crust quickly dissolved into a mush. Not a great idea as far a soup goes. The udon itself was good.\n\nI ordered the Tofu Steak, which I assumed would be some type of saucy and fried tofu. When it came, it turned out the tofu was barely fried. It was just jiggly, soft, and tasteless. The worst part was the mushroom sauce that the tofu was drenched in. While it didn't taste bad (or good, really), the smell was just atrocious. I've never ordered anything at a restaurant that I literally had to scoot away from me because of the smell. That made me lose my appetite pretty quickly. I will be trying other restaurants next time I come to this mall. Not Takara.", "author": "Christina L."}

Was here just yesterday for lunch and was not disappointed with the food. Ordered their lunch Bento Box at $7.95, which includes, miso soup, 4 pieces of California roll, tempura (1 shrimp with veggies), salad , rice, and whichever you pick..I think it was tonkatsu, chicken terriyaki, beef terriyaki. I know there were a couple more but I can't remember at the top of my head.. I picked the tonkatsu. The tonkatsu was crispy, juicy and not one bit oily. \n\nMy only disappointment for the last couple of  years is the service. They are a bit slow getting to the tables..Took quite some time to get a refill for water or to even get our bills.

Discovered Takara whilst searching for reasonably priced sushi restaurants in Japantown on Yelp. Noticed the star ratings ran hot and cold, so we figured it was going to be a toss up. Uhhh yeeeah. Try throw up. \n\nOrdered the agedashi mochi to start. It didn't just look wrong, it tasted wrong. The mochi was drenched in sauce (versus a light drizzling), piping hot on the outside but cold in the center. Took one bite and set it aside. Next came our rolls. The fish was definitely not fresh. The nori was way too chewy. After sampling a piece -- one piece! -- from each of the rolls we ordered (4 total), we concluded that it was just not palatable. So, we got up, explained to the gentleman at the register that we were not pleased with the food, told him we'd pay for the alcohol we drank, but that the sushi was just flat-out awful. He insisted the chefs use only the freshest fish. And while that may be the case any other day or night, it wasn't the night we visited. After about five minutes of back and forth protestations, we paid for the entire meal (sans tip). It was approaching 9:30PM, we were starving, and our Japantown options were closing up one by one. So it was either continue to bicker with this guy or pay the check and get the eff on our way. Needless to say, we'll be disputing the charge with the credit card company come sun-up.  \n\nLemme tell ya, no amount of O-positive blood and electricity could've saved that meal. There are plenty of decent sushi/Japanese food options in Peace Plaza. I'd recommend you try any one of them in lieu of Takara.", "author": "Monster M."}

We already tried the Japanese fare there so I asked him to meet me in SF instead.  I planned to try out Okina Sushi, then realized at their doorstep that they are closed on Tuesdays.  Darn, yet again I had to pick a new place off the top of my head... and if you know me, there aint much on the top of my head.  No fancy mobile Yelp so I used my car's GPS to help me find a place.  The Takara name rang a bell, but I couldn't remember why.  I'm having this memory problem recently.\n\nLooking at Takara from the outside, my bad food warning light was flashing.  It doesn't look good.  But looking at the menu, it was filled with mispelled Engrish words... hmmmm, must be good then.  We went in.\n\nTypically I'll order a couple of items, get a sense of the food and what everyone likes, then continue ordering throughout the meal.  We ordered the chawan-mushi, the nabeyaki udon, tonkatsu, and yamakake for starters. \n\nSurprisingly the chawan-mushi came out first, in about 5 minutes.  I looked at my buddy, he looked at me.  There is no way chawan-mushi can be made in 5 minutes... yep, it was lukewarm like they reheated it.  Nasty.\n\nThe yamakake and tonkatsu came out next.  My friend loves yamaimo.  The maguro looked old and tasted kinda fishy.  My friend asked, \"How can they screw this up?\"  Yuck.  The tonkatsu was decent, not great, but the best thing we ordered.\n\nThe nabeyaki udon came out last.  This is a standard order for my friend, so I wasn't surprised he ordered it again, even with it being rather warm outside.  The udon was clearly the frozen variety.  We didn't bother finishing it.  Pffftt.\n\nI told him, don't waste your belly space eating this stuff.  So we closed out our bill and went out wandering Japantown aimlessly, looking for someplace else to eat.  What a shame, 900+ Yelp bookmarks and I'm playing Russian Roulette with my stomach's happiness.\n\nWe ended up at New Korea House just to play it safe and not risk two bad dinners in one night... how sad is that, settling for Korean food in Japantown?", "author": "Bryan K."}

My wife commented that the slices of fish was a little thin and the rice was a little too much for the slices of fish. She said that the salmon was very tasty. Salmon sashimi is her favorite. One of my checks on the sushi chef is to look at the tamago, egg omelet, If the chef is trained the omelet  has a consistent yellow color and is a solid piece with no joints. The tamago in my chirashi met all the qualities I look for. Raw fish was delicious, presentation was nice to look at. The rice was firm a texture that a good sushi chef prepares.

Every time I'm back in SF, I wind up here.\n\nIts incredibly large menu has something for everyone -- from the obligatory teriyaki to the less commonly found kamameshi. This can be a drawback since I think generally you'll fare better at specialized restaurants for certain things ... like ramen. For ramen I like Tanpopo across the street. \n\nBut to me, Takara is all about comfort food and it does it well. It is a little pricey, but in my opinion it's a bargain for the good quality and good portions. My favorite is ordering the \"Takara Chirashi\" which is sashimi over sushi rice. Something that can't be missed is their chawan mushi (savory egg custard), which comes with most of their set meals. I'd also add kamameshi (rice pots) and chazuke (tea over rice) are both comfort foods that I think are relatively rare finds in restaurants here.\n\nThe service ... has character. It definitely can drag at times, but my favorite is walking in to see the grey-haired old Japanese man with the beaming smile who hustles faster than I can.

You can't find this in a lot of places!

Pairing my meal with a cold glass of plum wine really topped it off! \n\nThe service was great here! Everyone was SOOO nice, and they even brought out a complimentary ice cream! As most people have complained about the service here, I'll have to let you in on something. In Japan, servers don't wait you every minute of your dining experience as they do here in America. And I think they've sort of carried on that cultural aspect here. They want you to enjoy the meal, so don't feel bad flagging someone down. In fact, I like not being bothered. Having little service here and there IS the Japanese way. \n\nThere was plenty of seating all around. And the atmosphere was relaxing, and quiet. The prices aren't the cheapest, but they're not overly priced. It's Japanese food, so don't expect gigantic portions!

The second time I went on my own and tried their cold buckwheat soba and an order of the barbecue squid.  It was so good I went back the 3rd time for the same meal and it was spot on again.  The soba was fresh and cooked perfectly.  The squid was barbecued just right to add that flavor you look for yet it was still tender with that snappy texture.  I knocked back a large Sapporo and life was good.  The forth time, today, I decided to try their Saba Shioyaki lunch and I was impressed yet again.  The Mackerel was perfectly grilled; it was flavorful; it was moist; it was delicious!  Add to that some silky Hamachi on the side and I was a happy man.\n\nThis place is now my goto place for a great lunch.  I have yet to have dinner here because I rarely eat out for dinner but I'm going to make an exception soon.\n\nNeedless to say I have been recommending Takara to all my friends as a hidden Gem in Japantown; for Japanese food, of all things.

Being half-Japanese and having been raised by a Japanese mom, I know what good Japanese food is.  I also understand the importance of service and presentation in Japanese culture.  This restaurant could not be further from that standard.\n\nIn that arena, I have given this place the benefit of the doubt SEVERAL times.  The service is absolutely and astonishingly bad.  Someone else's review said service was \"atrocious\".  I have to agree.  And no, the quality of food is not so stellar as to make up for the service.  I will write here, my last experience there...\n\nI went there with a friend who is not only new to Japantown, and new to good Japanese food, but also is not from this country (no Asian in him).  So, in a way, I was trying to introduce him to a great Japanese experience in the wonderful Japantown community.  In my opinion, he got neither.\n\nWe got there around 8:30pm, so I thought, oh good, we will be seated and served pretty quickly because dinner is winding down, the restaurant was barely half full (lots of empty tables).  We were two, standing behind another party of two.  As we waited unacknowledged for about 5 minutes, I started to think \"uh oh, maybe not the best first place for my friend here\", but again, I was trying to be optimistic.\n\nThen finally, seated, we looked at the VERY extensive menu, which is why I liked this place.  They have all the choices.  I love my authentic Japanese food.  We had so much time to look through the menu, we changed our minds about 3 different times.  Remember, my friend is very new to this type of food, so we could have had questions.  Anyway, we waited and waited and waited.  The whole time, I kept looking up for a server to take our order.  I could have sworn, the servers (two females) were avoiding eye contact.  But finally, one came over to take our order.\n\nAt the end of the ordering, I realized, I had not been asked what I wanted to drink.  I always have hot green tea when I eat Japanese food.  The response was \"look over there, we have no cups right now, it's been busy tonight, you will have to wait for your tea.\"  Uhm ... okay ... look over where?  Err ... what am I supposed to say, \"No\"?\n\nNot only did our food come out very slowly from the kitchen and in a very strange order, but it was just so-so in quality/authentic presentation.  After about a half hour, and half way through my meal, I was getting really thirsty.  I flagged down one of the servers and asked for my tea.  Again, I was asked to look over \"there\" and know that there were no tea cups and that I would need to wait.  Okay, where is \"there\"?!  And why do I need to wait?  Couldn't they find something else to use?  The water glass that I hadn't touched was sufficiently thick enough to hold that damn tea!\n\nClose to the end of the meal, after I had finally gotten my lukewarm tea after an hour of sitting there parched, I guess one of the servers had left our bill on the table.  We were deep in conversation and did not notice it.  We were trying to enjoy the meal despite the bad, slow, rude service and so-so food.  But as we were talking, one of the servers interrupted our conversation, \"we are closing the register, so would you PLEASE pay your bill now\" ... to which my friend turned to me and said \"wow, she's kinda bitchy\".  He's a sweet guy, so for him to say that, pretty much confirmed it.  She was really being a bitch.\n\nAfter all that.  I remember thinking, I keep giving you servers the benefit of the doubt tonight, but this is ridiculous.  I have been nothing but \"please\" and \"thank you\" and smiles all through dinner.  I was pretty upset, but instead of making her wait, we paid the bill.  Instead of not tipping, we tipped.  I walked out first.  Servers did not say thank you to me, but did so to my friend, which I fully expected.\n\nMy friend said that in his country, service is expected and they get paid to deliver it.  A tip would only be given on the rare occasion that a server went above and beyond expectation with exceptional service.  He would have left nothing, no tip.  I left them more than nothing, which in retrospect, was the wrong message.  So, instead, Takara servers, here is my message.  I will never eat at your establishment again.

We were told by the manager (a guy) to either take a booth tight enough for 4 people or a table for 4. The place was empty so I asked what's the problem about giving us a bigger table. The manager keeps on talking to the waitress and not addressing us directly. When I ask the waitress if the manager speaks English, she says he speaks perfect English. Then why the hell would he not address us directly? So disrespectful. And the waitress snobbishly says it is a very busy restaurant as if to justify why it could not accommodate a request for a bigger table.

He stayed on for 2 months after to transition, but is now off to find a new place - in Hawaii or Japan.  San Francisco just suffered a great loss because Takara really isn't the same.  Most of the fish was a little bland.  Not gone bad, but just bland.  And hamachi kama was tough - hey, I can make better hamachi kama - so that's just sad.\r\n\r\nHowever, the raw clams on the half shell were amazing.  And their toro was indulgently fatty-fat.  The Uni was generously proportioned and extremely fresh - and I don't even eat uni.  The menu is also fairly extensive including some great post-sushi rice porridges and multiple different varieties of miso soup.  There was no wait on a Wednesday night, and street parking is somewhat decent that far up the Japantown strip.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-10", "description": "Note: I am commenting on the sushi bar only -- I haven't eaten in the main restaurant nor have I ordered from its menu.\n\nAbe-san and Shin-san are two of the best sushi chef's I've encountered in San Francisco.  Personable and accessible, they make hanging out at the sushi bar more laid back and less fussy than hanging out with the sushi chefs at, say, Blowfish.\n\nAbe-san's cutting technique for sashimi guarantees that you feel like every bite is substantial  (he cuts in thicker, shorter chunks than other chefs, who rely in thinner, broader slices to make it appear as if you've received more food than you actually have).  The modest addition of clover sprouts and cuke slices to a sashimi plate makes the whole affair seem more well-rounded.\n\nThey also do a great job with nigiri sushi, particularly saba.  Their uni is always fresh and vibrant with flavor.  They also do a great job with unagi.\n\nAnother reason this restaurant is so terrific (from a sushi standpoint) is that you don't have to buy fixed slices of sashimi.  For instance, toro is priced at 7 pieces, but you don't always want that much toro (or other cuts).  It's nice to be able to say, I'd like 4 pieces of toro and 4 pieces of hamachi, without raising an eyebrow or getting that \"we don't mix it up like that\" look.\n\nI highly recommend them for lunch, when you can get some personal attention (they close at 2PM for the afternoon, and won't seat you at the sushi bar after 1:30PM).", "author": "Andrew L."}

I called the host over and said I didn't think it was made as stated, and he curtly told me \"no, no, that's how it's made\" and strode away. Well, I asked our waitress for a menu and sure enough, it stated avo and cucumber. When I pointed it out to the waitress, she was very nice about it and replaced our roll with one that had the proper ingredients.

For raw fish - this is THE place to go if you don't care about slow service and the lack of ambiance.  A plain hole in the wall  with authentic excellent sushi, at a decent price.   And an \"excellent\" from me, on sushi, is a rarity.\n\nI admit that I ended up here every time when I couldn't get a seat at Ino Sushi, the little sushi joint, next door.  But this place never disappointed me.  And no reservations required either.  After yet  another excellent experience at the sushi bar last night, I decided that it's worth a review. \n\nFrom sake, hamachi, maguro, hirame, amaebi to uni and toro, there was not a damn piece of sushi that I could complain about.  And even the hamachi kama was good, even though I don't usually get anything cooked here.  \n\nSome basics to cover: \n- For a much faster service, sit at the bar.  \n- If you sit a the bar, speak the very limited Japanese that you know -- order sushi in Japanese, and say thank you in Japanese (\"arigato\" - pronounced \"a-li-ga-do\")  when the sushi chefs hand you your sushi -- when the sushi chefs boss the wait staff around for you to get you what want, you know you are in good hands. \n- Know the difference between sake (the drink) and sake (salmon).  If you don't know the difference, you don't belong here.    \n- Know the difference between nigri and sashimi.  Again, if you don't know the difference, go somewhere else.   \n- If you ever see a big Japanese tourist group inside, go somewhere else and come back next time.\n- Don't bother with the dessert here.  You are better off hopping to the ice cream place across J-town.  You'd need the exercise after all that good sushi....", "author": "Shirley F."}

We shared spinach with bonita flakes, chilled tofu with bonita flakes, clam soup cooked in sake.\n\nOne thing about this place is they seem busy regardless of what time you stop for dinner.  Service is horrible here, you basically wait and wait for a table, the reason being is that there's no one to bus.  Once you finally get seated, you wait and wait to order.  The food comes after a bit, then you never see your waiter again until to wave him down for the bill.

Teriyaki salmon was really good, and the fried oysters. The salad that it came with was good as well; I would like to know what that dressing was! Miso soup tasted like typical miso soup. Nothing special. Good stuff. These weird pickled vegetables came with my dinner also. The stringy one was okay, had a weird texture. But the yellow, whatever it was, was NASTY!

Reasonably priced, it serves more authentic food than can be found elsewhere ... where else can you order natto and konnyaku?\n\nBrownie points for that one.\n\nI love this place for two reasons:\n\nOne, the waiters/waitresses ACTUALLY speak Japanese and are incredibly friendly, offering to substitute any portions of meals upon inquiry. \n\nTwo, it's much quieter and calmer, and the food is served hot, and presented well. Sure, they might not specialize in chicken teriyaki and the other items most tourists tend to order, but they excel in their noodles, soups and other non-sushi items -- which I have found other restaurants tend to butcher. Their sashimi has always been fresh with the tuna bright red, the salmon without a lot of white lines. \n\nI don't usually order their sushi, but the few times I have, it's always been nigiri and it's always been impeccably prepared, in the true Japanese style.

The first plan was to make our way to Saigon Sandwiches to get the best banh mi on the planet and order enough to get us through lunch for the week (seeing as how hotel and conference related fare was expensive and not all that tasty).  Unfortunately, we got there 30 minutes late (they close at 6:00 p.m.).  So, we decide to just get something to eat instead and planned to visit 8 Immortals (Chinese Seafood place).  On the way, we stopped and looked around Japantown and stumbled onto Takara.  On the outside were reviews of the place and it had managed to become one of the 100 best in the Bay Area.  We were intrigued, but I still wanted to go with our original choice.  Well, we truck all the way over to 8 Immortals and they were CLOSED on Wednesdays.  Doh!  \n\nSo we make our way back to Takara.  Our waiter was super nice and we opted to go with more of a yakitori experience here.  We ordered everything that was available (e.g., chicken wings sold out) on the grilled menu.  And I have to say, everything was just okay.  \n\nSure there were a couple of stand outs.  The black cod neck (though it looked burnt) was exceptional.  The tofu and mushroom dish (not a grilled item, but I don't remember where it came from) was repeater.  It was really soft tofu that was fried then placed in a thickened mushroom broth.  \n\nThe eggplant with benito flakes had a unpleasant burnt taste to it.  Everything else was just okay.

It's like I have to order natto (texture is similar to mucus) to prove to the sushi chef that it's ok to give me the good stuff.   I can see that the chef has two types of Uni at the bar.   One from Santa Barbara and the other from Hokaido, and I always get the one from Santa Barbara first until I order the booger roll.  Then, the chef feels bad and gives me something decent.  I never have to put up with this in NYC.  \n\nPretty solid sushi here, nothing stellar...except for the live ama-ebi (sweet shrimp) which they keep in a tank out front.  I'd compare it to very good, fresh spiny lobster.  Service is horrendous - it takes an act of Allah to get a refill on water.

Mine was with white tuna which was very nice. My husband had a square bowl with mixed sushi,, He liked it,but did not like the pickled stuff. I ate that and gave him some of my sashimi. The one thing I really noticed was lots of locals. Probably because its cheap/good. But the place is run down and a bit dirty for my liking. There were wrappers on the floor and that just seems lazy/sloppy to me. \nThe food was over all good. Service very nice/fast and accurate... prices good/cheap for decent quality.  This is not a fancy place, but definately a very good value. 3 of us got out of there for 31 dollars plus tip. \nI might go again. But there are other places for a few bucks more that I am also interested in trying.\n\n***On a side note,,,, Japantown has much improved.

I've had udon that were made by Chinese people who ran Japanese restaurants so I though this would be a great opportunity to try more authentic cuisine (not saying other people can't do it).

But Ino was, inevitably, closed like many other shops in J-Town for the most celebrated holiday among Japanese, also known as the first 3 days of the year.  \n\nTakara stayed open.  The tank of abalone was quite encouraging.  Live seafood is always a good sign.  Sitting down at the sushi bar, I was greeted warmly with 2 small complimentary appetizers (dry seaweed salad, only so-so; and meatballs, which were quite tasty).  I ordered the following items:\n\n2 pcs of Kanpachi\n3 pcs of cockle---  absolutely delicious.  With the flavor of giant clam yet the interesting texture of octopus, every bite was delightfully yummy.  This was apparently a UK favorite as well, recalling that Andrew Zimmern ate a bunch in Wales (anyway).  Oh, and it did NOT come with the price of giant clam.\n2 pcs of Hirami--- wonderfully drizzled in ponzu...  heavenly...\n1 pc of Hamachi belly\n1 pc of Saba--- the best Saba I've ever had.  The meat was so tender and tangy.  I love them on the more vinegar-y side.\n1 pc of Uni--- as my dessert\n1 order of Matsutake (Pine) mushroom soup in a small teapot--- When I was little, every time we had Japanese food we had to order the teapot soup.  For nostalgic reason I asked for it.  Also I have this thing for mushrooms in general.  The soup was fragrant and light.

I didn't try the Chawanmushi.\n6.  They have rice balls and they're tasty.  Tasty rice balls makes my wife happy.  If you've never had a tasty rice ball, you need to try one here (onigiri, try the salmon one).  If I could choose to be reincarnated as something, it would be the warm center of a tasty rice ball.\n7.  You're spending time on Yelp reading reviews.  The whole point of Yelp is to try places for yourself and tell people what you think.  So give it a try and write a review.", "author": "Chris P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-27", "description": "People here keep complaining about the health inspector score of 74, let me tell you a little background why this score is so low, they used to score around 92 in Takara but one time they had a pipe burst (not theirs but the building's) and flooded the place. This was just a few months ago. This affected their score and made it pretty low. I do not contest the other things that might have lowered their score but the place is not a 74, if you are really nit picky maybe its an 86. Take these health ratings with a grain of salt, our local Chinese restaurant 1 block from my apartment gets a score of 100, and believe me they do not deserve it. \n\nAnyway the Japanese food in Takara is generally the best in Japan town, that might be a bold statement but in my opinion this is true, and I have eaten at all of them. I used to take Japanese classes near JTown and pretty much went to all of the restaurants in the area. Mind you the food in Maki is generally better and the sushi at Kiss Sushi is definitely at a different level, but mind you these two that I mentioned are significantly more expensive than Takara. If you compare Takara with the other places in JTown like Mifune, Iroha, Sapporo, Kitsune, those others who serve the \"usual\" Japanese American fare, then Takara is safely the better of the lot. \n\nI suggest going for lunch since the Bento Box lunch is one of the best deals in town. They have really good tenpura, miso soup that taste authentic, the sushi is good (not the best) but as a general restaurant it is pretty good compared to the rest. \n\nIf you want really good sushi, go to a specialized sushi place, or if your thing is ramen go to a restaurant that specializes in ramen. It is pretty unfair to rate a restaurant with an extensive menu such as theirs and compare a specialized dish to a restaurant that specializes in that dish. But all in all, Takara is still the place to go in JTown if you want good Japanese everyday fare. \n\nDon't believe me? I dare you to go to each of the \"general\" Japanese restaurants in Japan town and listen to the people speaking and figure out who is speaking Japanese. I will bet you that aside from maybe Tanpopo, Takara has the highest percentage of Japanese locals eating at a restaurant in JTown (Benihana being the lowest). This fact alone shows you something about a restaurant.", "author": "Jonathan G."}

I need to be more selective in who I tell. :P  I've had the best toro and uni here, as well as the freshest amaebi (right out of the tank in front).  MMmmm.  I try not to cloud my palate with all the tempura-teriyaki offerings; I stick with the fresh sashimi and nigiri.

My last time was pre-Yelp days.  And at that time, the sushi was fresh and ok.  It still is, although not as top-grade as I once remember.  They changed owners a few years ago, so that may have something to do with it.  \n\nLast night might be the last time I go here...ok, maybe just for 2007.  We took a seat at the sushi bar, and asked the waitress to see the menu.  We weren't planning to order from the dinner menu, just the appetizer.  The sushi chef pretty much flipped out and told us we couldn't order dinner at the sushi bar.  We were ok with not ordering, but that didn't stop him from practically ripping the waitresses head off for bringing a menu to us.  From that point on, the service was pretty slow and forgetful.  I had ordered a hamachi kama which never showed up.  I think the waitress mistook my ordering of gyutataki (which sucked badly...it was some sort of low grade beef that they were using) as a substitute. It took her awhile to bring me a coke.  And then when we were asking for the bill, it took like a good 15 min for them to bring the correct bill to us.

We sashayed to Takara and were warmly greeted by the wait staff.  Plenty of seating available, and they were quick to take our drink orders and let us look over the longdong menu.\nBig props on a menu that has plenty to choose from: sushi, sashimi, tempura, yosenabe, udon...you name it, they got it.\nWe ordered some staples: edamame and a standard roll, plus a couple of the tasty-looking combo dinners.  Food came out fast and furious, which was exactly what we needed in order to get to the show on time.  We loved all but the savory custard, which seemed a bit too creamy before a jump-up-and-down-hollar-and-scream concert.\nTempura was excellent - crispy and uncoagulated, with a great variety of veggies to choose from.  Miso soup was nice and thick.  The chicken terriaki was tasty and had a great sauce, and the side salad had a zippy dressing.  Only problem with the meal was the fact that my sashimi order never arrived.  It looked close to arriving on 2 occasions, but then was whisked away elsewhere.\nLucky I was stuffed and didn't need the fish (but I secretly yearned for it, since I would've easily thrown the tempura out as a sacrifice to scrumptious sashimi), and the wait staff was very apologetic and gave us a hell of a deal on the bill.\nStill, I have to knock them a star for the miss...

My waitress ignored me for the entire night: not once did she check in to see how I was doing, not once did she refill my tea, she didn't even bring me my chawan mushi and miso soup!  I had to ask the poor bus boy for everything, which he did with impeccable manners.  But still, that's unacceptable to have such an incompetent waitress, right?!  Worst of all, I saw her serving all her other tables all night.  Boy, that burns me up.  I gotta knock 1 star off for that crap; however, I won't take more off since the bus boy and other waitress were very nice even though I wasn't their responsibility.  \n\nIf you've all ready read my review, I guess you can expect me to give that star back after my temper settles and my \"lifetime boycott of this crap hole\" ends sometime next season. ;)\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nTakara's like the girl that you've dated on and off over the last decade or so.\n\nThe food's always been pretty good (she's always been quite pretty), but I've ended boycotting Takara on and off over the past decade because of their sometimes super-crappy service (she has a bitchy streak).  They'll do things like argue with you over stupid things, sometimes botch your order, take a long time getting things to you, and they'll even do super killjoy things like carding you when it's obvious that you're over 21 (she argues with me over mundane things, nags me, and always does things to make me look stupid in front of my friends).  But what brings me back?  Well, the food of course (yeah, she's pretty good looking)!  And when I do break the boycott, I get really good service at that time (she's nice to me again).  So what happens?  I go back again a few more times, and invariably the service sucks again (she starts bitching me out again).  So I leave again (so I leave again).  But I always just end up coming back.  This has been happening for the past decade or so.\n\nYes, I have issues, thank you for asking.\n\nHighlights: really great sushi -- super fresh, good cuts, great selection on omakase (real rarities that you rarely see anywhere else), but cut a little on the small side (damn, perfect opportunity for an Asian joke here but I won't go there); nice full-sized oysters on the kaki fry (although they no longer have that delicious miso-based dipping sauce but instead just give katsu sauce now); uber fresh yakizakana; and the lunch bento and lunch chirashi are steals.\n\nOverall, a very solid authentic Japanese restaurant that is better than most others in the city, but expect to develop a looooong love-hate relationship with them.\n\nHere's to another decade, babe!", "author": "Ryan D."}

So being the smart cookie I am, I decided to kill the proverbial two birds with one stone and try a Japanese restaurant in Jtown. First, I have to say that I was kind of surprised by the lack of 5 stars for the food in the area - I mean, how hard is it to have decent Japanese food in a place called Japantown? Second, and this is probably because I was raised on Texas Japanese food, I thought this place was really good! Ambiance is dive-ish (which I ADORE) and when we went for lunch just before the lunch rush, it was filled with these cute older Japanese people who reminded me of my grandmas and grandpas. For starters, I thought the miso was good - not too salty and kind of gritty but not overly so. I had the udon lunch combo with katsu don (as did Dad) and I thought they got the donburi sauce/ rice mixture down nicely. My mom had the chirashi lunch special and said it was one of the best she's ever had (though, again, she has lived in Texas for more than 40 years). She said that the vinegar flavor to the rice was practically perfect and the fish was incredibly fresh. And for the 3 of us, the bill only came out to 35 bucks.

EVER.   ahhhhh!!!..........but wait.......they don't waste anything.   they heads come back to you fried.....eyes, brain, whiskers thingies.  it may be scary to some, but just eat it...it hella good!\n\nso yeah.........it was all delicious.   the bill came to $81 bucks (food & tea).  would've been $84, but they never brought us our miso soups that we ordered from the get go.  but its okay by me....i was effin stuffed by the end.  i dropped a $21 tip...so it came out to $102 altogether.  yeah, it got expensive...but it was worth it.  plus it was the lady's bday.\n\nthis place is legit.  i can see why the yelpers here want to keep this place a secret.   this place is number 1 on my sushi lists.  extra points because i think they freshly grate wasabi roots for you when you come in.  you can taste it.......and so will your nose canal and brain.\n\ni'm coming back on saturday with 3 friends to have em try the ama-ebi.\non sat they are open from 5:30pm-9pm.  i have no idea if they are open earlier for lunch though....sorry guys.  thats all the info i have.\n\ncheers!  -nick2k", "author": "Nick N."}

And tonight, we thought we'd try somewhere new.  Takara is situated on the east side of the Japantown Shopping Center. The times we've walked by, it's always been busy... which would indicate good food.  Well, we were seated immediately and the menus were we given offered a wide variety of choices.  From sushi/sashimi to udon/soba, there was nearly every Japanese food items that you could imagine. The prices are a bit higher than the restaurants on the west side of the center, but the portions are bigger.  I had the Tonkatsu dinner (which game with an egg custard, miso soup, rice and side salad), wifey ordered the nabeyaki udon.  We also shared agedashi tofu appetizers.  The boiling udon came out quickly, even before the tofu made it out.  It looked real hearty but the flavor seemed to be a 'little' lacking.  My tonkatsu pieces were rather thick (dare I say meaty)... which made it a bit tougher to chew, and the panko crumbs seemed like they had been fried a longer time.  The agedashi tofu... a simple dish of slightly battered and fried tofu with radish shavings on top... was this blocks of tofu submerged in a syrupy sauce with the radish shavings and shiitake mushrooms.  The sauce overwhelms what is supposed to a rather delicate and simple dish.  We'd come here again to give it another try, but would have to go back to our usual staple a couple of times to satisfy our udon desire.", "author": "Dale K."}

I had made a reservation for when the place opened at 5:30pm (on a Sunday) and within 10 minutes the place was pretty much full...good sign, right? Well, the problem was the service was slow, really slow. The poor lady was in over her head. I was taking my boyfriend's parents from out of town and chose a place that I thought would be moderately priced (they usually like to front the bill). The sushi came and it was good, but when we wanted more we had to wait a good 20-25 minutes for her to come back (she forced us to be those annoying people who raise their finger when they need something..urgh! I hate those people!). Then, when we were done, we waited another 20-25 minutes for the bill (which in the end was not so moderate). I would think with so much competition in the area that they would try a little harder, but they are obviously on to something because there was a good wait when we left. Final word: if you don't mind waiting, give it a try, but its not so incredible that you have to go...a lot of help I am :)", "author": "Debbie L."}

The city is known for its amazingly fresh food and creative approaches to it. The quality of sushi in SF really stands out... apparently not in Takara. \nIt is very touristic place that targets crowd who have no or a very little exposure to sushi. It was almost impossible to get an attention of a waiter, who was running between the tables and the cashier. \nThe first warning that I saw on the menu was the \"bundled dinner\" that comes with soup, a couple of appetizers, sashimi etc. This was scary enough. Though I ordered \"Special Sashimi\" that wasn't anything close to special, the quality was still very mediocre. However, fish in spicy tuna roll was so old that I had to stay on Tums for rest of the night.\nIf you have never had sushi in your life and would like to try it for the first time - try some other place (Ino next door is pretty good). If you are sushi connoisseur - stay away!", "author": "Milena A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-02-23", "description": "Authentically Japanese from the cooks to the waitpeople, who all speak Japanese.  Takara is my favorite place in Japantown, and apparently a favorite of many Japanese Americans in the Bay Area who flock to it at lunch time.      The menu is extensive.    It t offers many different a la carte items and combination meals, including \"bento boxes.\"   It has all of the familiar fare:  teriyaki, tempura, broiled fish, domburi (rice bowls), noodles, sushi, and sashimi.    The raw fish is impeccably fresh and all sushi, even in the bento boxes, is made to order.   My favorite is a combination lunch that allows you to choose 2 or 3 items and comes with  miso soup and pickles.  Service is quick and efficient despite only 3 wait people who  seat guests, take and serve orders, and refresh water glasses and tea cups.  There is also a sushi bar in a separate room from the main dining area.", "author": "Evelyn G."}

Other dishes are good but the sushi sets this place apart from many others.", "author": "Dennis B."}
