Personally, I think this is the best way to tackle this place as they have many different selections that you'd want to try. The ability to order family style is an extremely powerful one as you can satisfy your cravings in multiple areas like beef noodle soup, bbq squid, pork belly over rice, fried chicken, pancakes, etc etc and the list goes on.\n\nAll of the food above + taiwan beer = happy brain and stomach. The place is very authentic and service is excellent. Food is reasonably priced. Parking is a bit hard which is one negative and portion size can be dauting for those from out of the country but this is fine for me.", "author": "Sang P."}

Lots of brown sugar flavor, loaded with red beans, grass jelly and the taro balls. I loved that taro balls because they were huge and soft/chewy. Big portion so perfect for sharing between 2-3 people. Their dessert selection wasn't as much as I thought but hoping that they can expand it. \n\nThe beef wrap was actually pretty salty. I wish that they had the hoisin sauce instead of soy sauce, but even by itself it was pretty salty. It was a tiny wrap, but packed with a lot of meat.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

My favorite was the beer with lychee! I'm not a big beer fan, but this was definitely chuggable LOL. The milk tea was standard, nothing too special. The shaved ice was alright, it was too sweet tbh with all the syrup and I wasn't a fan of how hard the ice was. \n\nI'd definitely come back to try their savory foods next time!

Looks like they are still trying to establish their menu tho. I hope this one lasts!\n\n*Tables were too close each other it was hard for people to get out without touching the table next to you and get close to them.

After eating, however, my overall analysis is that there are better options close by (just head up to Clement and go in almost anywhere - there are so many good and cheap restaurants nearby!)\n\nUnfortunately, the pork belly buns I would have to say were just pretty bland and a little dry; they could really use a little fish sauce or some other kind of sauce to liven them up. \n\nI definitely enjoyed the meat lovers more; the noodles were served with a tasty broth and properly cooked meats. It's not a soup but it's a little more juicy than say an Italian noodle dish. Definitely enjoyable, but still nothing to write home about - it was just good, nothing special. Unfortunately, this was priced at $19.95. (I did notice that price is $1 cheaper in the restaurant vs delivery)\n\nBetween the pricing and lack of anything special, 3 stars felt right.

You can get better buns for $1.30 each just a few blocks away, or better noodles for less money even cheaper, and that's what you should do. \n\nI did notice there are some items on the menu - especially the cheaper entrees - that were not on uber eats, so perhaps I will stop by in person or get take out to try them sometime.", "author": "Chris S."}

What's your favorite Taiwanese dish? Where can I get good Taiwanese food in SF? The last question always stumps people, because we just don't have many options, and I can't just Uber to Cupertino on a whim.

The crushed peanuts provided a nice crunch to the tender pork belly. \n\nEveryone agreed that the niu rou jian bing was by far the standout. DO NOT SLEEP ON THIS DISH. Despite being close friends, we were all being modest and/or selfless for some reason and nobody touched the last piece for a long time until I commanded W to just eat it. \n\nThe niu rou mian was pretty spicy, which the menu does warn you about.

W and C were nice enough to let me eat most of the egg, but the rest of it was missing something.

The decor is really cute and reminds me of Taiwan. They have some unique dishes and traditional dishes like fried chicken cutlet and lu rou fan. What stood out to me was the black pepper noodles and GRILLED SQUID! omg that was super delicious! I would go back just for that dish. Their chicken was mediocre, it was a bit dry and thin.

I love Taiwanese food and have pretty high standards for it, and haven't really found any legit Taiwanese in SF yet.\n\nFirst thought when walking in - I don't love the decor. There's a big display in the middle of the floor piled with Taiwanese/Chinese snacks for sale, which is great for nostalgia value, but takes up tons of space that could be used for... like 3-4 more tables, in a restaurant that doesn't have much seating to begin with.\n\nI wanted to hit all the Taiwanese classics to see how well the kitchen executes the basics. The pork belly gua bao was pretty faithful to the version you'd find in Taipei, though a bit inconsistent - the first bao I ate was filled with a perfectly braised, luscious and unctuous slice of pork belly. The next was disappointingly chewy and stringy.\n\nBeef noodle soup - maybe the single most championed Taiwanese dish (yet not truly Taiwanese... but that's a discussion for another time). Other reviewers have said the broth was too salty. I didn't find it overly salty, but I did find it hard to detect any other flavor besides the salt. There was an occasional hint of the quintessential Taiwanese beef noodle spices, like star anise and chiles - but it was so faint as to be almost a hallucination.\n\nThe fried chicken rice was definitely the highlight - tender but crisp chicken thigh coated in exactly the right mix of spices that I hoped for. Definitely hoping to try the pork chop rice next time.\n\nIn the future, I'm hoping they add some more seafood-focused Taiwanese favorites to the menu - namely, \u86b5\u4ed4\u714e and \u86b5\u4ed4\u7c73\u7ebf. Overall, this is probably a top 3 Taiwanese restaurant in SF - looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu.", "author": "Andrew W."}

While the beef pancake here is filled to the brim with meat, it definitely lacks the balance of a good beef pancake (i.e. needs more hoisin and cilantro).\n\nThe only dish that I thought was done well at HoDaLa was the beef noodle soup: definitely as good as a bowl you'd find in Taiwan. Restaurants will frequently overcook beef till it's fall of the bone tender, but that's actually not authentic to Taiwnese beef noodle soup. The best beef noodle soups will cook the beef just enough that you still are able to get the texture of the beef with every bite.\n\nI'd give HoDoLa another shot in the future, but if you could only choose one Taiwanese place to try out during your visit in SF, I'd look elsewhere.", "author": "Austin W."}

It was very hyped up for me and it definitely lived up to the hype, and this is coming from a Taiwanese girl who's from 626. The restaurant decor is very throwback with a ton of good ol Taiwanese candy, snacks and posters. \n\nI went so ham and ordered 6 things for 3 people. \nStir Fried Preserved Egg with Sweet Potato Leaves - Sweet potato leaves is such a Taiwanese staple vegetable, the preserved egg went really well with it, I'm definitely going to steal this recipe. \nPork Belly Gua Bao - The flavor is on point and the bao was fluffy, delicious and with a sweet aftertaste. The sauce went really well with the peanut crumbs. The pork belly was cooked really well, it was juicy and meaty. \nGrounded Pork over Rice - Another traditional dish that was done very well. The ground pork was juicy and flavorful, it had a mixture of ground mushrooms in it as well so the texture was great. It had enough sauce to make the rice really tasty. It also came with some sour cabbage (my favorite), marinated egg and also pickled radish for garnish and taste. \nFried Pork Chop over Rice - I love how thin the breading of the pork chop was, and how juicy the meat was. The sauce was on point but it made the fried pork chop a bit soggy in the end. Overall was still a great entree especially with the bamboo shoots on the side. \nSizzling Beef with Black Pepper and Mushroom Sauce - The flavor of this dish was on point! Just like the ones you'd get in a night market. The steak was too tough imo and the noodle was overcooked. I'd skip this dish next time.\n\nMy favorite of the meal was the TOMATO BEEF NOODLE SOUP, I was obsessed. It reminded me of my childhood, and I had always been on a search for tomato based bns. This place has done a perfect job, and it had a really nice kick to the broth as well. The beef was also a perfect balance of tendon and meat. \n\nI'd have to come back here again if I'm ever visiting sf!! The service was also friendly and attentive.", "author": "Jamie Y."}

Little known secret is to make a reservation, as those are first come first served and they have a limited amount they put aside for it. My boyfriend took nearly 45 minutes to find parking, so obviously take public transportation or rideshare to avoid such a waste of time. Luckily, he dropped me off to be seated first and I put in the order while waiting. The space is super small inside, but definitely gave me the Taiwanese restaurant vibe. I think it' mostly due to the decor of the space with candy and other goodies sold at the front and the seating behind the snacks. I started with a peach green tea, since boba tea originated in Taiwan. A bit disappointed that there wasn't boba with the drink. It was a little on the sweeter end versus tasting the actual tea, but it was okay. \n\nStarters:\n- Baked Cheese Corn: this plate came out a lot larger than I expected, but it was good! Cheese was good and the corn was sweet. I would definitely reorder when I return.\n- Beef Wrap: Gave this a try, but was disappointed. The wrap was very dry as a whole and the pieces fell apart so easily that it was not easy to eat. Flavor was also lacking in the wrap, and the meat had a bit of flavor but was super dry. \n\nMain Course:\n- Braised Beef Noodle Soup (spicy): The bowl was fairly large, and had a good kick of spice to it that I could handle. It wasn't overpowering so that you could taste the flavor of the rest of the dish, but a perfect amount for me to taste all the flavors. Noodles were a great texture and perfect firmness and the meat fell apart easily as it should for this dish.\n- Sizzling Whole Squid with Peppered and Mushroom Sauce: Originally I didn't want this because I don't like mushrooms, but the mushroom was just in the sauce and not all over the dish so I could deal. The peppery flavor was very apparent in the noodles and the fried squid was huge! Super flavorful and I couldn't finish the dish - had to take it home and it still was two more meals for me after that from this one dish.\n\nOverall, it was around $50 something to try all those dishes.

When that came out, there were sprinkles on the ice cream which I didn't care for, but then quickly learned that they don't taste like anything (they're just not my preference on ice cream is all... I know it's just sugar). The dessert was amazing. Something so simple was so tasty. It reminded me of firecakes (ice cream filled donut bars) in Chicago, IL! Haha.  \n\nNow, we were even more stuffed but we were happy we tried out this new spot. We were overall pleased. \n\nThen, it took longer than 5-minutes just to get our bill. But once we made eye-contact because all the workers were super busy. So, we understand...\n\nAgain, those were the only 2 's-- parking and waiting for the menu, then waiting for our check. \n\nOtherwise, the workers were great especially the young man (only man at least on that shift) who was super helpful, cheerful, and busting his butt!", "author": "Roxane P."}

And man, this place was so legit!!!!\n\n\nReminded me a lot of the beef noodle soup I had in Taipei and Taichung. The broth here was on point, very hot , spicy, and lots of flavors. What surprised me the most was the noodles. Tasted like they made it in house and was very fresh. I loved it!!!! Then the beef, was nice and tender. Simy amazing. The Resturant itself had a lot of cool stuff that would remind you of Taiwan ( candy, snacks, Taiwanese beer). \n\nOnly weird thing is those auditorium seats they have. Very uncomfortable and tacky. They were weird, looked ugly, and uncomfortable when you sit on them. One thing I would suggest is to replace those chairs.\n\nI have still not tried their baos aka buns, but I will try that next time. Deff coming again. Great job opening this in the city!

Yeah, no.. it took about an hour for our food to arrive, which arrived separately; we finished the noodle soup right before we were served our rice bowl. \n\nWould not return because of the wait time.

Unfortunately, this place does not serve any of those classic Taiwanese items. They listed bubble milk tea on their menu but do not serve any pearls- like most authentic Taiwanese restaurants do. I tried both the Taro Milk Tea and Matcha Milk Tea. Personally, I would get the Taro Milk Tea again because it has a strong Taro taste and is nothing compared to those powder milk drinks. The Matcha Milk Tea, on the other-hand, tasted like matcha drowned in milk (not good).\n\nIn terms of food, I ordered their popular items: pork belly buns, beef rolls, braised beef noodle soup, and ground pork over rice.

The broth tasted nice and flavorful with a subtle kick of spiciness. Meat was nice and tender with no fat. The only thing we didn't like were the noodles, they didn't seem cooked all the way. They also seemed to skimp a little on the veggies.\n\nPork Belly Gua Bao: The bao came out cold and the pork belly had a lot of fat on it. Otherwise the flavor was decent, especially the sweet peanut shavings. Looking around, a lot of parties ordered this.\n\nBlack Pepper Steak Noodle: One of the better versions I've had of this in the Bay. The pepper, garlic pieces, and noodles made for a good combination.

I give a three star because everything was just mediocre. I think my experience at the Taiwan cafe was better and many S Bay taiwanese cuisines serve much better and more authentic food.

Driving down Geary, I noticed a bright and new sign I did not recognize... I was like \"Ho... What... Ho Da La??\"\n\nFast forward 5 minutes of debating and finding a parking spot across the street, we decided to go in because I read \"Taiwanese\" and that pretty much sold me. The City seriously lacks some good Taiwanese food. \n\nService:\nWe came in during soft opening and the service was honestly phenomenal. The server was very helpful in explaining the menu and giving us a plethora of options. He was also very attentive and made sure we were enjoying our evening. Afterwards, he even let us Venmo the restaurant account because their credit card machines were not up yet. \n\nFood: \nYES. Finally! A spot that actually has some awesome Taiwanese food! I was hoping I was not buying into some weird... fusiony... Asian food... but surprisingly found a nice medium between hole-in-the-wall and boujie. They served flavors I recognized when I ordered their gua bao (pork belly buns), nu rou mian (beef noodles), and lu rou fan (braised meat rice) with portions that was just enough to make me feel like the price was worth it. Would I change anything about that? Definitely not. I had a great meal for a solid price point (at least in the City). \n\nInterior/Ambiance:\nIt's a bit on the darker side in the restaurant and they were playing Taiwanese favorites like Jay Chou. I believe they are also meant to be like a mini-bar and they have games and stuff too.

Then again Turtle Tower being right across the street can be hard to beat. \n\nFirst off, very nice choice of decors to the ambience and even down to the details of furniture choice. Kind of a rustic modernized twist, from those 2 Star war and iron man figurine posters at the door to the dim light Taiwanese night market looking stand at the entrance with many candies and snacks to choose from. Seems like a cozy appealing place to step into for a cold windy night with some warm food. First thing I noticed were the water cups. They're silver and bronze version of our typical red party cups haha, brownie points. \n\nNow what I actually tried were their Taiwanese pork belly bao, fried spicy chicken wings, squid and steak pasta, and their beef noodle soup. \n\nTaiwanese pork belly bao might be gimmicky but get it! Won't disappoint! Tender juice thick pork belly on the inside, very nice pairing, on point. \n\nFried chicken wings, meh they were ok. To me more flavors were on the outside and the inside were pretty bland. \n\nSquid and steak pasta.... where do I even begin with you. First of all maybe you guys should cut that up for us because it was annoying cutting that whole squid on your own. Plus it kind of ruin the presentation because it just looked like a sizzling plate of pasta with the grilled squid slapped on top. Taste wise, I would past.\n\nBiggest past up I would give it to the beef noodle soup. You would think with a Taiwanese theme restaurant this would be safe. NOPE. It was definitely on more of the tomato side of things... tasted like those tomato vegetable can soup and you just add in noodles and beef. The beef were done nicely though, I give it that. \n\nCan't tell if we were just trying the wrong things or everything we ordered was just not up to par. Maybe I'll give the braised pork over rice a try the next time I decide to go there.", "author": "Aly C."}

I wish I could give it 1 star, but I just can't bring myself to do it.  \n\nAs a Taiwanese person, everything on the menu is something my mom used to cook for me growing up.  \"Minced Pork Over rice\" dish is called \"Lo Bah Bung\" in Taiwanese and traditionally comes with a stained hard boiled egg.  \n\nI went at 9 o'clock with my cousin at night (Sunday), we were already a few drinks in and slightly rowdy.   The waiter was very patient with us, and had definitely more than accommodated us.  \n\nWe ordered 4 things on the menu: \n\nBraised Beef Noodle Soup - A lot of flavor in the broth.  Beef melts and is very soft.  Noodles are good. One of the best beef noodles soups I had.  \n\nPork Blood (Steamed) - This is one of my favorite thing to eat, and they do it well with peanut powder.  It's very chewy, and the pork blood has the flavor (and texture) of a rice cake.  Not for the faint of heart. \n\nScallion Pancake w/ fish sauce - My cousin loved this.  It was pretty good.  I'm not sure if they make this in-house or if this is a pre-packaged dish.  \n\nPepper Steak w/ Noodles - This is like Taiwanese junk food.  I loved that they had it.  Beef was a bit over cooked & dry, but otherwise a fairly good dish.  Can't really do this one wrong. \n\nOne recommendation I have for the restaurant is to add ba wan (traditional Taiwanese meat bun) to the menu (images below). \n\nBa Wan's are just waiting to be the new asian craze in the western world, just like Ramen & Soup Dumplings.  \n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=taiwanese+ba+wan&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJ26y36efZAhUuwVkKHdaTCcsQ_AUICigB&biw=966&bih=438", "author": "Justin L."}

I've got to say...my mood was lifted as I saw the wall with the old school (and semi recent) Jay Chou MVs. Definitely brought back nostalgic moments in early high school. The one dish that I was looking forward to was the tomato beef noodle soup..however that was the one dish that did disappoint. Maybe I have high expectations since my mama has a pretty bomb recipe..but the broth just wasn't super flavorful and the beef was mediocre. However, the other dishes that we did order--pork belly gua bao, ground pork rice (\u6ef7\u8089\u98ef), pork chop over rice (\u6392\u9aa8\u98ef), beef wraps (\u725b\u8089\u6372\u9905), and sweet potato leaves with thousand year old egg (\u5730\u74dc\u8449\u7092\u76ae\u86cb) were all incredibly tasty and I highly recommend ordering them. Service was also decent--very efficient for only having 2 waitresses. The restaurant was also decorated with Taiwanese 90s toys and candies. Overall, the experience brought back a sense of home for a Taiwanese millennial and had authentic music and delicious food to top it off. Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys Taiwanese music and food! Will be back if I'm ever in the bay area.", "author": "Jenni W."}

The broth for the \"mai fun\" has good depth of flavor and wasn't too salty or oily. The spicy tomato beef noodle soup only had a couple pieces of tomato, but overall hearty for a cloudy cool day.

We got bunch of things-a pitcher of beer, pork guabao, green scallion pancakes, fried meat sticks, braised beef noodle soup, and fried pork chop over rice. There was a little wait when we got there, but somehow they skipped over some parties and took us to a table fairly quickly. The two ladies waiting tables are super nice and kind, which is kinda amazing. I tend to associate Asian restaurants with straight forward service aka North Korean style (just kidding) sans any smiles. The food overall was unfortunately very average and a bit of miss for me. I was totally stoked that another Taiwanese eatery opened up. The guabao was probably the best. The meat was tender and flavors were nice and not over the top like chairman bao's in the tenderloin. The buns were pretty cold or luke warm at best. The pancake was little greasy and chewy.  the fried meat sticks were ok. They are like miniature fried wontons, and not memorable. The pork chop over rice tasted really good but the meat was over cooked and became very stringy. The braised beef noodle soup was similar. The broth was really solid but the meat was very stringy, I had one piece that was tender and rest felt like they were cooked to death. But it was the noodle itself that did me in. They were just flat,\nstore bought noodles with no texture what so ever. I was hoping that for 12 dollars, I'd get fresh hand made noodles, which ironically a lot of the Asian hotpot places (which line the street) have now. So taking everything into account, I think the prices are a bit high for the quality of food dished out, but good and friendly service. Will probably wait a while until we come back.

We got seated immediately into these uncomfortable old theatre chairs. They are extremely uncomfortable and feel very awkward. The servers brought us the menu and it looked really old and worn out, it was made from paper there was no lamination or anything and the menus smelled bad. We ordered the squid noodle, pork buns, minced pork over rice. The pork buns were pretty good however I can tell the meat was extremely fatty , I didn't like it so I took off the fat from the meat. But the bun is very delicious! And the presentation is the cutest! The minced pork over rice was just ok, I wouldn't order it again. It was not that special. The squid noodle was SO UNBELIEVABLY SALTY!! I could not finish that fish because the noodles were soaked in oil and salt and msg. It was so bad I couldn't eat much of it. The squid was pretty good but really salty as well. The service here is pretty good, all the waiters were pretty friendly. But due to the food and atmosphere I would not come back.", "author": "Carissa C."}

Sadly we just weren't at all impressed. \n\nTo be fair, they did have a \"Soft opening\" sign up so perhaps these are areas they can still tweek and improve on.  \n\nThe service: very slow. The restaurant wasn't packed and there was technically no line and yet we still had to wait a while to get seated. Ended up getting seated at the bar. It'll be another while before anyone came to take our order and give us water. And it'll be longer still to actually get the food.  New restaurant though so I guess this is expected. \n\nThe food: We got a few things to share:\n\n\"fried chicken\" bao\nbeef rolls\nbeef noodle soup\n\nI put the fried chicken in quotes because this was as much fried chicken as a McChicken patty... Meaning this wasn't fried chicken at all. It's not even clear whether this was chicken. Basically think of the McChicken sandwich, cut it in half and replace McDonald's bread with a bao then add a little Costco mustard.  Thats the fried chicken bao. The pork belly looked better. We regreted our decision. \n\nBeef rolls were okay. Slightly on the small side. The beef was very tendony and the wrap was chewy rather than crispy.  Beef noodle soup was good, but not anything to come back or wait for.\n\nThe space: Overall well decorated, slightly cheesy with a 80s Taiwan theme. There is a projector that's plays Taiwanese music videos. The most entertaining part though is that the projector was connect to an iPhone and it would also project text messages and incoming phone calls.. amazing.", "author": "John S."}

Knowing there's a new Taiwanese restaurant opened in San Francisco is definitely a good news in my mind! After reading all the raving reviews on yelp! I decided to check this place out! The theme of the restaurant definitely reminds me of the 80s, which is similar to the theme set from class of 302 down in LA. Due to soft opening, the menu is limited, I didn't see anything Taiwanese dessert such as snow ice or boba drinks. I ordered the potato leafs, beef noodle and mi fun! My first sip of the beef noodle soup def reminds me of spicy bean paste, soup itself is bland and noodle isn't the typical fresh noodle you find in Taiwan! Overall, I will say the beef is tender but still chewy. 3 out of 5 and definitely something I will not order. As for mi fun, it reminds me of instant noodle soup packet mix with hot water, add mushroom, green onion and rice noodle! Bland and not flavorful! Lastly, the potato leaf is actually very good.

The braised beef soup definitely has a spicy kick to it which I loved. We loved their yam leaves dish as well. The pork belly rice bowl was a bit lacking, but decent. I wish there were more veggie options on the menu (I think yam leaves was the only veggie dish if I recall...). I wish the restaurant fit more people (is the center table/bar really necessary to sell $1 candies?)
