{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-09-19", "description": "They are frequently understaffed during the morning rush hour with on average 2-3 workers total with always only one person making the drinks (the other at cashier and the other if there is one on food). Hence, orders take longer than promised to come out even if you placed them via mobile order. The flow of the place seems off and inflexible - staff should float around and assist with not only food but drinks too if the drinks are getting backed up.  \n\nThe morning staff frequently don't correctly customize my drink per the order instructions. The amount of espresso shots was off once, too. Ice customization is never considered, not even once.\n\nCustomer service is also super lacking if not borderline abrasive and cold. I love Starbucks as a company but this store is definitely the worst coffee shop that I have ever been to and needs to make some extreme improvements.", "author": "Amanda N."}

I came in around 6:20am and waited about 10 minutes for 10 pastries. About 5 mins after paying for the pastries, a woman came up to me and said they were out of the specific pastries I ordered and I would have to pick different ones. Ok, fine; that would have been nice to know prior to pay nearly $25 for these. Then after waiting 5 minutes more, I was finally handed the pastries and the staff that bagged these said, \"did you buy a bag?\" and I said no, because when I'm buying pastries at the crack of dawn I do not think of buying a bag. Perhaps, it would have been helpful if your cashier asked if I wanted to buy a bag just like EVERY OTHER establishment in the bay area. So after my response, he said \"well next time you have to buy a bag. I gave this one to you for free\". Great, he stuffed 10 pastries into literally a GIFT BAG. Not even a regular size bag, and he stuffed the pastries into individuals baggies. Cool, I never asked for that, but perhaps if you wanted to save your business some money you could have 1.) asked me if I wanted to purchase a bag & 2.) ask if I wanted these pastries packed a different way\nDude, you gave me a \"free bag\" after you ran out of 4 pastries these I purchased? To note, I just told this lady to give me an assortment of the other 4 pastries- I didn't care to figure out if the pricing was different.\n\nThough there were at least 5 staff members behind the counter, this didn't make service any faster nor any friendlier.\n\nI can't come back to this Starbucks anymore because it's not very kind to ask if someone purchased a bag and that tell them that you gave them a free GIFT SIZE bag after stuffing $25 worth of pastries in it.\n\nIf you're not as awake as you should be,  neither is the customer who is at your coffee shop!", "author": "Tracy L."}

Everyone is really nice and patient with my small children and the bathrooms are clean.

My husband always orders a venti iced coffee with milk. The app clearly says there are 6 pumps of sweetener in this drink but they never sweeten it. Every single time I have to taste and then ask for sweetener. We've had friends pick up coffee for us as well with the same problem. \n\nWhen you ask for sweetener they seem annoyed and say the label doesn't say to sweeten it but the recipe in the app clearly says to sweeten!

It's just starbucks...\n\nThis review is not based off their coffee (although, I was introduced to the mighty Coffee Mistro the evening I attended) but rather my dining experience whilst at Starbucks.\n\nIt was one of those nights (ah ah ahhh) when everything (yes, everything) that could go wrong; was going wrong.\n\nGot an email from the teacher stating the paper that was supposed to be attached - and due the previous week- was not attached to the email. My lap top is in the shop (virus); my neighbor was nice enough to let me use theirs - however, their mac would turn off within 10 minutes if not directly plugged into the wall. \n\nThe paper, which was only on this lap top's desktop, could not be transferred via bluetooth and my iphone *shrugs.*  The jump drive with the paper already on it is mia. We try to piggy back off neighbors WiFi but alas, we kept picking up wireless networks except for the two nice neighbors who gave us their passwords. Now we have to lug the computer around (not my mac, mind you) until we find a hotspot - ALAS - Starbucks!\n\nIt was 9:30 - 30 minutes to closing. I place my order - plug in the lap top...only to find the outlet not working. Of course. Try a couple different ones - success. Get the lap top up and running and try to find the free Starbucks WiFi...only.....once AGAIN the computer was finding other networks but not the one I needed.\n\nI asked the nice gentleman who had recommended the mistro (as it's the strongest they got) if he could help me with the WiFi settings - he told me the name and although we found it - the computer kept timing out and would not connect!\n\nIn comes another employee who has a mac. He tries to work some mac magic (me and other fella were familiar with PCs), he goes to settings; some network places, some other stuff.......and still...although it would find the at&t network the stupid thing would not connect!!! ARGHHH!!!! He said it was probably due to battery issues (Yuppp!)\n\nThe fellow suggested we use the store's lap top. My other half departs to Walgreens to pick up another jump drive so we can transfer the paper to the store lap top...By this time it was nearing 10 p.m.  they were sweeping and clearly closing but assured me I was 'ok' and could stay until we figured this out (they are students as well and recognize the importance of sending an over due paper.) \n\nMy other half returns and in comes the store lap top. Naturally, the store lap top could not connect to the WiFi either. Also, the jump drive was not showing up on the mac. (ARGKHJHEDJWHSDJHASDKJAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, right?)\n\nAt this point the store is closed, we are all equally frustrated and ready to throw the lap tops off the table.\n\nI gave the mac to the mac friendly fellow and took the PC. After some toying I noticed the little blue wireless thingy was not on - switch it on. Mac dude noticed that the jump drive was one of those microchip cellphone jump drives - which we luckily happen to have within our phone. Insert, delete some shit (since it was full) and on goes the paper.\n\nIn goes the paper to the store's lap top, in goes the paper into the email and out goes the email.\n\nI am totallllllllllllllllllllllllllly greatful they were all so willing to help us in our plight!! Without their help that night would have been even more miserable than it was! \n\nThank you both (sorry I never got your names :( ) for helping us!!!!!!!", "author": "Maple S."}

I come here almost every morning and the staff are always great and professional.  Four stars in general but Lanette made it a 5 star experience.  She is super nice, friendly and smiles every time.  With that kind of customer service, she should seriously be considered for the manager position.  Ok, now to the not so good.  Parking is generally awful in the evenings or weekends but we're reviewing Starbucks, not Starbucks parking.  Next, the lines can be sometimes pretty long and slow, but it is slow because of the customers and not the staff.  These annoying customers (and you know who are you) always order not just 1 drink but 4 to 5 frapps (seriously, I thought we're still recovering from a recession) some bagels, pastries, CD's, croissants that need to be heated and THEN they slowly dig into the little purse of theirs and have 7 different gift cards to use and then for some inexplicable reason, also wants to reload that gift card.  WHAT??  What is suppose to be a simple order of coffee or latte now turns into a 5 minute transaction. Most of the time, they will open up another line, but sometimes they don't.  My only suggestion to the staff is that maybe if you do see a long line, drop what you're doing, i.e., cleaning equipments or loading supplies and clear the line and wait till it is quiet before returning to your other task.

I had a hard time finding a parking spot in the first place.  I had to double park and leave my friend in the car.  I jaunt over to Starbucks with my wonderful hangover from the new year's celebration trying to avoid the glorious sunlight that was shining ahead of me for my drive back down to the peninsula.  \n\nI stumble in this place, hidden behind my sunglasses just wanting my coffee and to run away.  The instant I stepped inside I was semi-taken aback by all the people.  Ok, I can handle that.  I then get in line, and decide I want a grande nonfat no-foam latte with a shot of eggnog.  The snotty cashier informed me, \"Oh, we no longer have eggnog.  You'll have to order something else.\"  I'm completely baffled in my state, and continue on, \"It's on your menu?  In three places no less.\"  \"Sir, we haven't gotten our new menus, we'll be changing them on Thursday.\"  \"Well, don't have it as your 'Choice of the Day' if you don't have it.\" ...\n\nContinuing on, I decide then to order a grande 2 pump sugar-free vanilla, 2 pump sugar-free hazlenut, nonfat, no-foam latte.  She proceeds to write this down after asking me to repeat myself three times.  Then she rang it up, charging me for 2 flavors.  So, not wanting to make a joke of myself, I say, \"A grande comes with 4 shots of syrup, yes?\"  \"Yes,\" was her reply.  \"So, why are you charging me for 8?\" \"I have to charge you for the two flavors.\"  I'm thoroughly unimpressed with her attitude, so continue on, \"I ordered 4 shots, not 8, so why are you charging me for 8?  I've other baristas charge me only for 4, why are you doing 8?\"  \"Because I have to ... .\"  At that point, I was thoroughly pissed off and tired of arguing with this blonde, so I said, \"Whatever.  Charge me, I'm done arguing with you, I don't give a d*** about the 40 cents anymore.\"  \n\nAfter having spent a few minutes arguing with her, I picked up my coffee, but was so disgusted with the place that I didn't even drink any of it until late that night after I reheated it.\n\nThis place is to be avoided, plain and simple.\n\n*WiFi hotspot (TMobile)\n*iTunes WiFi Music Store", "author": "Brent A."}

Starbucks is Starbucks wherever they appear. Just wish that they would make my drink hotter. I seem to always have unmelted chocolate at the bottom of mocha.\n\nCashiers are friendly. Baristas could speed it up a bit. Sometimes, I'm the only one who has placed an order and they still manage to take forever. They just chat with their coworkers while I'm standing there waiting for 5 minutes.", "author": "Ricardo L."}

Last week I had a little time before work and I had a Starbucks gift card leftover from Christmas, so I decided to stop in.  I was standing in line waiting to order, when I was suddenly seduced by the sight of RED VELVET cupcakes in the pastry case.  Red velvet cupcakes???  How could I pass them up?  So I got three red velvet cupcakes (one for me and two of my co-workers) and one vanilla cupcake (cheaper if you buy four, so why not?).  The red velvet cupcakes were a huge disappointment!  They weren't even cocoa flavored!!  The frosting was good, though.  Maybe I shouldn't have had my hopes up too high since they were, after all, from STARBUCKS.  Much to my surprise, the vanilla cupcake was REALLY good!  Moist with good frosting.  So, if you're ever in Starbucks and see the pretty red velvet cupcakes, don't be fooled!  Just get the vanilla one.  I promise you, you'll be much happier  :)\n\nMy vanilla latte was o.k.", "author": "Eileen H."}

I stop here for coffee every morning at 6:55 and have nothing but good things to say about it..\nThe workers are all nice and all but one are friendly.(The nice but unfriendly girl isnt on the register any more lately, guess she cant be even fake friendly).\nAt less than $2 for a giant cup of regular coffee served by friendly folks - compared to Phil'z overpriced coffee ($3. 25 for a \"large\") served by mildly interested hipsters.", "author": "Aaaaa B."}

In the AM, it's easy to find parking, and you're on your way fairly quickly.  Otherwise, this location is kind of cramped.  Plus there are a lot of other decent places to get your sweet beverages from only a block or two from here.  But hey, for those of you who resist change, embrace globalization, or simply want a cup of fast food coffee on the way to work, this Starbucks may be the place for you.", "author": "Tony L."}

They're so good at what they do that within 3 seconds they coerced me into getting a grande when I walked in wanting a tall. The guy with the long hair who makes the espresso drinks is so funny. I'm the kind of person who loves chatting it up with random people, so that's why I like seeing him behind the counter. But what's good is that he is able to read people. If you come in here and your energy is all business, he's not gonna bother you. Good guys. Good coffee. A+.", "author": "Becky U."}

My friend and I were there and they didn't have the cups ready to just take orders and write on them what you wanted and or they were missing a 3rd person. But then when I think about it, there was 3 people. The guy making the drinks was clueless and the guy at the register was clueless. OK, he charged the right amount, but he couldn't write the drink on the cup. There wasn't much of a wait for the order to be placed, but one for waiting to pick up.\n\nI guess I'm just used to the place that I go to each morning where they know me and have my order down to a science. There is free Wi-Fi if you have a Starbucks gift card and register it online. You'd get two hours of free Wi-Fi. If you don't you do have to pay so really you have to pay if you're not a Starbucks member and if you exceed the two hours.\n\nI don't know if I'd go back, but they need a better design. The drink making area is small.", "author": "Jen C."}

I had a cheese bagel with cream cheese. It was pretty good though I had to spread the cream cheese on it myself.  The restroom has a lock code on it that's hard to remember. I'm not sure about power outlets but the seating layout seems to be a good for both folks chatting and studying. Parking sucks. Sorry barrista if I stared at your nose ring. I tried not to but I was just curious about it. Its like with women with cleavage, I'm not turned on, nor horny, and I try not too look, its just a natural phenomena for the eyes to follow things that follow or lead to a certain symmetry or line. Just innocent looks.", "author": "Dijon Y."}

The place gets a lot of foot traffic and the door never stays closed for more than 7 minutes (on an average) with it being in front of a bus stop as well as on the corner of 19th Ave. They have a kids table but that's about it...well, a table and maybe one crayon (if you're lucky). Occasionally I'll see a homeless guy sit on one of the chairs for a few hours. Coffee tastes like Starbucks.", "author": "Janel Y."}

Well, in this neighborhood there is not a lot of good coffee and almost no good places to sit down. The Third Place, ie Home, Work... and Starbucks, is necessary for a healthy community.
