The weather was beautiful and we could see straight down to the water from our picnic area.\n\nI called ahead 2 weeks in advance and reserved both time slots for the picnic benches. There are 4 reserve-able areas at the Park - two are close to the playground, and two are up the hill. We opted for the option up the hill because my dog is scared of children. Each slot you reserve is $32 and its first come, first serve.. so make sure you reserve early during peak picnic/park season. Fortunately, November doesn't seem to be super popular. :)\n\nThe park itself is not technically off-leash, but there is an off-leash area close by. It's really nice, even if it is fake grass and all the dogs had an great time! Our pups played together and were able to burn off the calories of our doggie liver cake.\n\nVery spacious area up at the top of the hill, though there isn't much grass there. It didn't end up being too much of an issue because there was still some open space to set up a playpen for the pups and ladder ball for the humans.\n\nDefinitely recommend for future events and more than enough space to accommodate groups of 25+!", "author": "Jennifer S."}

There's an area for dogs to roam around and make new friends with other dogs and humans.  There's a play structure area for kids.  There's a nice open lawn for small groups or large groups to get together and relax.  There's flat areas and hills with endless paths for you to run around and get your workout on.

There is a sweet spot to sit on a bench and enjoy the serenity.  Unfortunately, Danielle Steel's massive mansion with ridiculous bushes stands in the way of the view, however. \n\nI especially love foggy days when the fog rolls up and you can hear the fog horns.  There is nothing like it.  It also has a pretty good view of the fireworks on the 4th (although there are trees in the way a bit).\n\nI take my dog here several times per week and I enjoy the scenery and the fact that it is usually not as overcrowded as some of the other dog parks in the city.  The people who frequent here are also quite friendly and not as uptight as they are at Alta Plaza.  I do still frequent that park as well but in general I don't see much interaction between people/dogs there, and the owners are snobby and asocial.  Their dogs often follow their behavior.\n\nSome minor gripes: the dog park is on an awkward slope and has no shade on hot days.  The dogs are dying up there on a sunny afternoon (and so are the people). I also would prefer some seating at the other end of the dog run (where there is a tiny spot of shade).  There is a lack of seating in general.  My biggest concern is that they really need to enclose the area so that dogs don't run outside of the dog run. There have been many dogs that take off down California Street, and some have been run over and killed.  I am lucky that my dog never strays but I feel awful for owners that have to chase after their loose dogs, or keep them on a leash (which inhibits the dogs's enjoyment).  I have had to help people catch or locate their dogs so many times that I have lost count.  People start chatting with one another and suddenly their dog is missing.", "author": "Teresa K."}

La Fayette has always been my favorite not just because it's a block away but the whole package, especially since the renovation.  I still remember the first time I went to this park on a full moon evening stroll.  Even in darkness it was beautiful.  I sat at the very top on a bench to enjoy the breeze when a gust of wind rustled the giant trees that surrounded me and made the scariest sound I've ever heard, so loud and so close I jumped.  I guess its true what they say about falling in love and being frightened.  Levels of adrenaline released when frightened means that two people going through a scary experience together can fall madly in love.  I am in love with this park.\n\nWhat's not to love.  Awesome playground for the little ones, off-leash dog area, tennis courts, lot of secluded areas to enjoy discretely if you want solitude, plenty of benches and picnic area and views of the city & the bay in a four block area.

The dog park is only fenced in on three sides, which means if your dog spots an interesting friend advancing up the hill en route to the dog park area, he may zoom out of the semi-enclosed area, toward the street. That's enough to cause any pup parent some panic, if your dog isn't the best with recall. So my advise is to practice plenty of recall before trusting your pup off leash in the dog park area!

Come on.\" Do you remember the scene in \"Wuthering Heights\" when Laurence Olivier filled Merle Oberon's arms with bunches and bunches of heather up on Penistone Crag as the ultimate act of romantic yearning? Well, Hollywood gossipmongers claimed Merle hated Larry because she said he spit when he talked. Also, heather isn't exactly lavender, but they both grow like weeds in the Moors. Well, don't even think about recreating that classic movie scene here because the lavender makes a nice aromatic fringe as it falls along Sacramento Street. They have laws against that, don't you know?\n\nI'm not a local to this charming neighborhood, a denizen who is able to enjoy the park on a daily basis with a French toy poodle, neutered of course, but I have been aware of it by its formerly seedy reputation as a cruising hangout after dark for wanton men. Back in those days, I always navigated around the park even if I had an opportunity to enter it for fear of being propositioned. Or maybe not propositioned. I don't remember which offended me more at the time. Now I'm envious of my friend Maggie who lives barely half a block away because the $10 million renovation has given this four-block park a facelift that should be the envy of any San Francisco neighborhood (photo: http://bit.ly/14ibfJm).\n\nYet, I noticed it was fraught with controversy over what elements should be redesigned. There's a small meadow area that looks like it's being set up for public performances since they added terraced grass seating to make it feel like you should perform Hamlet's soliloquy (photo: http://bit.ly/1775Rqk). Some apparently don't like the idea of it. Less controversial are the two dog play areas and the expansive playground that has quite a stone water feature for frolicking toddlers (photo: http://bit.ly/1cEq0Xc).

This is a review for the lady in the pictures attached who is actually a dog walker, and because she is responsible for other people's dogs I feel so strongly to leave this review and hope some of her clients read this and think twice about putting their dogs lives in her hands: I was here with my dog last Sunday and it was busy! We were here for about an hour when I heard a lady screaming by the water fountain:\"this is bullshit, this is bullshit\" so we all turned and looked and it was this disheveled looking older lady trying to get a handle on her golden puppy, the puppy ran towards the grass area and a few other dogs chased after it, trying to play, the lady is running towards the puppy and yelling at all the dogs while trying to grab the leash, the puppy started running towards me and I grabbed his leash, she runs up to me and again said:\" this is bullshit\" so I said to her:\"they are just playing, relax\" at the time I didn't know she was a dog walker since she acted like a first time owner. She turned to me and said:\"fuck you\" and walked away! I was speechless....a week later I saw her again when she was with a group of her dogs, two of her Bulldogs were playing with each other when she started yelling at one of them loudly: \"do you want to get kicked out?\" While putting him in an alpha roll.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-07", "description": "This review is mostly for the playground. I used to live a block away when I was a kid, in 1992-1995. So I had been to the sparse playground with splintery wood structures many times and I used to practice my tennis serve against the bathroom wall when I joined the tennis team my freshman year of high school. I had not been here since, until a few weeks ago when I took my 3 yr old and he was in heaven! \n\nFirst of all the playground is HUGE although you can't even see if from the street. You can enter from Clay & Laguna to be closest to it. In the middle is a giant man made mountain with long metal tube slides, rocky areas to climb and play, a rope bridge, giant poles to slide down and a large rubbery hill that my son loves climbing straight up!\n\nNext to that is a very large yellow metal structure, for older kids, with some slides, climbing areas, and monkey bars. There's a small \"merry-go-round\" with ropes to climb on while your mom spins you. There's a small toddler structure with a slide and climbing areas. \n\nBut the very best part, and what sets it apart from most parks in the city is the water play area. There's a beautiful river rock lined trough, that is filled by hand with different pumps and spinning handles! While it says to play from the side, everyone seems to jump right in and run around until they fall and get soaked and bonk their heads. I watched 2 kids do this before my own son did. Loads of fun! \n\nThey added some landscaping to the hill. For those of you who are new to this park, you can enter from any corner. It runs along Sacramento St/ Laguna St/ Washington St/ Gough St. But unless you live across the street, you will have to walk up at least one GIANT hill to access the park. \n\nit's interestingly warm up here too. You'd like a park on top of a SF hill would be cold & windy, but it's actually quite sheltered and comfortable here. There is a bit of a view of the city when you look south but nothing like the view from Alta Plaza a few blocks away. However when you look north there is a gorgeous view of the bay down Octavia St. and an interesting view of downtown, down Clay looking east. \n\nThere are also several picnic tables & benches around the middle of the park, tennis courts, renovated bathrooms, and pretty flowers and plants throughout the park. It's gorgeous and I really love seeing the improvements over when I lived here growing up!", "author": "Venus S."}

It's not unsafe for the dogs (not close enough to the street fortunately) but they're constantly running into the landscaping.\n- Grass is not holding up. \n- I think there is a drainage problem because it can get quite muddy\n- Parking is tough if you don't live close enough to walk\n- Doesn't have separate areas for large vs small dogs\n\nI haven't really explored other dog parks in SF so I don't have much to compare to.

It's up on a hill, and had spectacular sunset views. Unfortunately, what I don't like is the sometimes \"coddled\" or \"purse dogs\" that come with their owners and just sit. And it's only because I have a pretty excitable dog that doesn't take too well to these types of dogs, which has caused me to take her elsewhere to play and run out her energy. I also wish the \"dog park\" area of the park was actually enclosed completely. Several others have commented about this. What ends up happening is that dogs start playing and sometimes one will start to run out of the park, taking 4-5 others with him/her. This causes a domino effect of owners to be running after their dogs (which, you would think would be hilarious to watch, but it gets pretty scary when the dogs get close to the street). But I love the general environment and vibe of the park. It's great for kids or a cool place to visit to catch some rays on a nice day. I definitely come here when I don't have my dogs with me and just want to relax. Just remember to bring a jacket or blanket.

I've come to love hilltop parks like this one, Alta Plaza, Alamo Square, Dolores, Tank Hill, Grand View and few more.  They tend to have larger lot sizes, so they offer respite (you know, a decent amount of nature in the middle of a big metropolis), pretty views, plant diversity and a a little quieter above all the City noise.   \n\nShe's currently undergoing a MASSIVE $10M renovation for the next 10+ months, so those quaint places for quiet, enjoying greenery or taking your dog for a pretty walk sadly are really not there for now.\n\nI've visited on a few occasions to accompany a quirky but loveable french bull dog and his owner.  The dogs still gather in all shapes and sizes in makeshift grassy areas, but the existing conditions make it unpleasant to spend time  chainlink/plastic fencing, 1-2 rickety picnic tables, and incredibly dry grass.

A lot of the dogs are off-leash, so be aware of that if you walk your dog in the area and if that doesn't match up with what your dog can handle. \n\nThere are plenty of benches on which to sit, especially if you head up the hill where most of the trees are. I find it peaceful and nice. When the sun goes down there are very few lights and it may feel a bit unsafe, so I would advise against coming by after dark.

In the morning hours, people with day jobs use it for a quick exercise routine -- usually involving running or stair-step routines.\n\nThrough the morning trees I saw two orientals, a man and a woman, both about 35 years old, doing what we might call shadow boxing.  \nWhen I drew closer I saw they were doing very slow Tai Chi movements, positions, breathing.  They took no notice of each other, and perhaps in the way of city folk, had no knowledge of each other.\n\nThat's when it came back to me -- when we lived in Hong Kong in 1973:  the image of Statue Square, near the approach to the Star Ferry -- there materialized 50 or more old Chinese, mostly women and very old.\nMany looked to be in their 80's and a few were said to be in their 90's and at least one a centenarian.  \nEarly every morning they came into being there. \nI tried to find out where they came from but it was no use, one would step out of an alley coming down from the Peak, another stepped out from behind a newspaper delivery van, and suddenly the square was alive with them.  \n\n50 or more old and very old Chinese, each practicing their own slow Tai Chi movements, holding positions long and motionless.  \nOther Chinese told me these were the real statues of Statue Square -- not the British Bronze on its stone pedestal.\n\nAnd with no sound or signal, they were gone in the early morning.  Just as I couldn't see where they came from, neither could I see whence they disappeared.  It was over for the time.\nAnd now there are no statues.  The old people are gone.\n\nI saw the aged Chinese perform their Tai Chi and hold their elegant positions nearly every morning on my way to the ferry -- and I know there are other old Hong Kong hands around who saw it, too.\n\nBut, in Lafayette Park I was taken aback.  Damn, I lacked the presence of mind to approach the young Chinese there and ask them if they had old people in their families who might have practiced Tai Chi at Statue Square.  Had they learned the practice from them?  \nBut when I go back to Lafayette Park looking for the two young Tai Chi practitioners, they're gone.  Disappeared.\n\nI can't find photographs of the old Statue Square in Hong Kong, but I'll keep searching.  They've got to be somewhere.", "author": "Peter N."}

This place is great for sunbathing and gossip, but I think it really shines as a fantastic wine picnic venue.\n\nWhat? You've never heard of a wine picnic? Well! It is an impromptu outdoor gathering of friends and wine. All you need is at least one other person and your wine accoutrements and voila! Picnic!\n\nNothing is more relaxing. You can expand your picnic to include snacks, tunes, dogs, and beer if you so desire.\n\nI've also attended a going away party here with a preppy croquet theme. Love it!\n\nOften, one runs into neighbors and friends from far and wide here, as it seems people will travel beyond their local parks to get to this special spot. \n\nThe bathrooms are the CLEANEST I have seen in a park in, like, my entire life, although they are locked up for the night pretty early in the afternoon.\n\nAhhh.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-09-14", "description": "Lafayette park is a perfect example of what's wrong with San Francisco. \n\nSteps from Danielle Steel's huge mansion, street people are splayed out like casualties on the grass. You don't have to worry about them too much. They'll leave you alone. Just don't sit downwind of them. Of course the rest rooms are all boarded up - heaven forbid any street people take up residence. Not that the police could be effective at monitoring this - they're only concerned with ticketing people for lapsed vehicle registration. \n\nThere is a very nice separate \"pen\" for a kid's playground. But we all know who the real \"kids\" in San Francisco are. (hint: they don't have two legs but four and usually a tail) Why is it that every green space in San Francisco is turned into a huge dog toilet?? It's so disgusting. I have no problem with a dog section in the park, but does every single blade of grass need to be christened by doggie urine? And I don't even want to think about the traces of fecal matter peppered liberally on the green.\n\nPersonally, I find it annoying when I'm quietly sitting on the grass and trying to read a book to have a dog come bounding up out of nowhere and knock me over. \"Oh Matthew, you rascal. Leave the nice lady alone.\" Who names their dog \"Matthew\"?!? And guess what, lady? Dogs don't LISTEN. They don't REASON. They only understand discipline. So do like you're supposed to do - be the alpha dog, put your damn animal on a leash because I don't need him charging me and slobbering all over my head! Listen, dog owners, we don't all think your dogs are as cute as you do. If they were children you wouldn't let them run up to strangers and annoy them. And since you all think your dogs are your children anway, remember, nobody likes other peoples kids. Keep 'em in line and on a leash.\n\n\nSpeaking of leashes, the new leash law is in effect and that seems to have brought the police into the parks once again - in their squad cars, of course. heaven forbid a San Francisco police officer's feet touch the pavement unless they're issuing you a ticket at the window of your car! \n\nThere is also a tennis court on the East end of the park. And a creepy guy lurking in the bushes carrying a camera with a telephoto lens to take unobtrusive crotch shots of you as you're sunbathing. Charming.\n\nSo anyway, going to the park sure has changed, hasn't it kiddies? I'm not sure who the parks are for anymore.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-02-25", "description": "One of the perks of my apartment is the nice view of Lafayette Park out my window. After living here for almost two years I've formed a number of observations about this pleasant oasis of urban green.\n\nThe sun comes out more often than not over LP because of Lone Mountain and Alta Plaza running defense against the ocean fog's offense. On weekends sun bathers come out and enjoy a book, bikini and bacardi. It's particularly amusing when the bare bronzed-ones neglect to bring a towel or chair. \"Hey sexy! This is a dog park and you're lying in sh**!\"\n\nDuring the week dog owners shoot the sh** as their beloved pets sniff each others asses in equal contentment. Most of the time everything is cool, until the inevitable dog fight happens. Stupid owners act surprised as a terrier becomes lunch for a german shepherd. Skinny women quickly realize they can't manage the big dog they bought to feel safe. Or two dudes get into an argument about their dogs ending in hitting a dog as punishment for something biology told the dog was ok. It's just symptomatic of keeping large pets and owners with egos couped up in tiny pac heights apartments.\n\nA lot of homeless people live or sleep here. There are a couple in particular that I recognize. \"One foot up man\" prefers sleeping on either of the two benches with one foot up on the back rest. He has unusually large feet. \"Passed out on the lawn man\" wraps himself in his overcoat and sleeps on the exact same patch of grass in the middle of the lawn. He prefers the greenest patch of the lawn. Nothing can disturb him, not retrievers, nor people playing frisbee, nor sun bathers, nor even the huge combine that mows the lawn and circles around him, mere feet away. Occasionally \"suitcase man\" spices things up and makes a guest appearance for the day. SM has a large yellow suitcase which he converts into a raised day bed above the grass. The rest of the homeless in the park prefer to avoid my childish nicknaming and live in makeshift camps in the bushes surrounding the two tennis courts. \n\nThis doesn't mean the park is unsafe. There are people walking their dogs at all hours and police regularly drive up the service road to kick people out of the park at night. But when late it's probably better to walk around the park, rather than through. Also, parking your car around the perimeter might be a bad idea as break-ins are frequent. I've interrupted break-ins more than once by yelling out my window. Maybe it was the threat of being thrown in jail... or that I was in my underwear that scared him away.", "author": "Brady K."}

It might not have the view like Alta Plaza, but it has something better on a sunny weekend...and that's people! So for a people watcher like myself it's marvelous. I go to Whole Foods grab a sandwich, a magazine and head to Lafayette to pretend to read my magazine but really watch people. Now the tennis courts aren't as nice as Alta Plaza, but you are more likely to see and hear those crazy Parrots of Telegraph Hill flying from tree to tree. Cool.", "author": "Amanda P."}

The park has tennis courts, you can actually grill out in it, people laying out and working on their tan, a place for kids to play, wonderful views and plenty of quiet places to get away. My wife and I loved it so much that when we moved here, we wanted to be close by. Imagine our happiness when we found a place that looks out over the park (the quiet side on Gough) - we are sooo cool. We moved in, got settled and were so pleased with our view (You can see the bay too if you stand on your tip toes, and you're already tall), watching all the nannies walking their paychecks an what not and of course all the people walking their dogs. I love dogs, I have always had them - Newfoundlands, labs, Irish setters - big dogs. Well, after about a week, i began to notice a pattern. People tend to come home about quarter to 5 (I don't know what it is about these short hours on the west coast) and naturally, every body's Fido's needs to get rid of breakfast. So for about the next two hours, we have the most beautiful view of dogs taking dumps. I can't tell you how many times i have seen some dog scrunch up and unload while i am having dinner. In fact, i have come to 'know' this pug (that has a striking resemblance to its owner) that (i swear) is smiling every time it takes a dump! I mean really! so that's worth at least half a star (maybe one in and of itself) and the other drawback is that i get to watch sweet romantic couples stopping by for a nice picnic or setting down to eat their lunch. This of course would we a great thing - if not for the fact that they tend to sit right where the pug usually unloads every night at 5:45! \r\n\r\nSeriously, this is a great park! The dog thing is really only a vent on my part. My daughter loves it. We just don't roll around in the 'lush' grass.", "author": "The Man M."}

With rare exception, the dogs (and owners) who come to this park are well-behaved and don't try to eat my little munchkin.  There's a little trail that goes almost all the way around the perimeter of the park, which gives my dog the exercise she needs.  The rest of the time is spent with her jumping into people's laps.  And there's plenty of space for my dog and my boyfriend's dog to run around to let off some steam.  The only things I would change about this place are adding a fence so that I wouldn't worry about the little one running off (which she very rarely does) and make the drainage better (gets a bit swampy after the rain).  I've heard there are plans to do a bunch of construction/renovation/whatever in the future, but I really hope that if that happens that they preserve enough doggie space.", "author": "Danielle B."}

Until, of course, the day I tossed one of those textbooks down, spread out a towel and sat down in the sunshine to enjoy cute dogs, rare SF sunshine AND be productive.\nSo  I sat down, picked up the book and set it in my lap, ready to get down with some neurologic communicative disorders when suddenly I felt something on my fingers. Turning the book over, I discovered that I had actually tossed my pretty book right into a big pile of dog shit and then transferred that shit onto my jeans, my hands and my towel. Mothertruckersonofa.... ok, no need to freak out. Just go to the bathroom and clean up, right? Well even though by some miracle the bathroom wasn't locked, there was no soap. Of course. So I then made the rounds asking moms and dog owners for purell or a wipey or some effin thing to make me feel not so icky. Yes, I'm sure they thought I was a bit odd but if people cleaned up after their dogs, shit like this wouldn't happen. Or maybe if I paid attention to my surroundings....\nAnyway, long story to say that I love this park for the dogs (minus their by products), the people watching, the view and the sunshine but I hate that the bathrooms are never open and now know that I need to bring my own damn soap.", "author": "deb C."}

Finally decided to go sunbathing on a Saturday while walking my roommates dog, Jack Bauer. Two problems here: I was given specific rules to not let JB off his leash (while he is a cute boxer puppy, he is very very naughty. Known to eat people's food, which is not great when there are tables of picnickers around) and I forgot a towel and refused to lounge around in dog shit grass. So I instantly became \"that girl\" being dragged by an overly energetic dog who wanted to sniff other dogs butts, jump up and say hi to people, and chase after balls that do not belong to him. Agh! After almost ripping my arm out of its socket multiple times, Jack meets cute girl dog Morgan. Who is cute girl dog accompanied by? Cute boy. Cute boy and cute girl talk for an hour while dogs play. Cute boy lives around the corner from cute girl. Cute boy walks cute girl and cute dog home. While they see each other again? Who knows. But I have realized that having a dog is the fastest way to improve my love life. I didn't even need to lay out in my bikini to meet someone! Problem solved.", "author": "Lauren Y."}
