I love me some fish and chips! I walked in around 11 am before the lunch rush.  There was a woman restocking supplies at the register who'd seen me walk-in, and we look at each other; she says nothing.  Maybe it is not in her job description to greet customers because that is when the manager walks out of the kitchen area and says hello.  \n\nAlthough I came for the fish and chips, I studied the menu- they seem to be somewhat of a deli. A cheesesteak shop and burger joint rolled into one. Much variety of food items to choose from. They have shakes, too, which is always a plus, but I didn't get one due to an already heavy meal. It is a very tidy, sleek and modern establishment with plentiful seating and even more seating in a closed off area just outside the building.  It was a beautiful day out and decided to eat indoors because I'm always cold!\n\nThe food took a while, which was understandable because it was barely lunchtime and they probably needed time to warm up their fryers.  The fish was nice and crispy on the outside and light and flaky inside, though I doubt is prepared in-house; it is not the kind you would get at a fish fry.  I didn't care too much about the fries because they're the kind you buy that are pre-salted, which is also salty for my taste.  Tarter sauce was a single packet  Kraft brand, which is unfortunate because I love to give my fried fish a good dipping.  At least they didn't forget the lemon, so all basis were covered.\n\nOverall, I had an a-ok dining experience but doubt I would be back anytime soon.  Perhaps if you were bringing a picky and unadventurous friend out to lunch, this might be the place to go.", "author": "Leslie G."}

The malty beer flavor was prevalent in both the fish and in the batter - delicious.  Speaking of batter, it was paper-thin, light and crispy.

Manhattan sounded so cosmopolitan and uptown, but it turned out to be more Hoboken than Manhattan and more spoke than hub. Like the kind that broke off your banana-seat Stingray when you taped baseball cards to them to make your bike make that flatulence noise. But then the name Hoboken Spoke would sound like a school that gives elocution lessons rather than a deli which it's trying to be. And speaking of flatulence, I was not a fan of this place. It's in a choice spot in that alley off Sacramento across from Wayfare Tavern attracts a lot of FiDi regulars during the busy lunch hour. It was also hot the day I went with the sun blinding me since I forgot my sunglasses. That also contributed to my dissatisfaction, I suppose.\n\nThere was quite a queue waiting to order, and believe me, someone didn't take a shower. And it wasn't me. Some of these tech guys need to live with girls who could tell them they smell bad before they leave the house into a world of innocent noses. Anyway, I was in the mood for a veggie sandwich, so I ordered the $7 Garden Hub, which sounded pretty good with avocado, greens, provolone, tomato, sprouts, cucumber and a sun-dried tomato spread on foccacia (photo: http://bit.ly/1Bf3pNy). That sandwich refused to come together for me. There was a cakiness to the spread that I found unappetizing that I threw it in the trash after three bites. It was redeemed by the $3 Couscous Salad which I liked even though it tasted like it was in the refrigerated section all morning. There's outdoor seating which I suppose could have been nice if I brought my sunglasses. Manhattan Hub? No. Hoboken Spoke.

So I have been dutifully going to MH once a week for many months to collect my punches. Sure, they are insufferably crowded at lunchtime, but it's never been longer than a 10-minute wait, and the variety of their fabulous menu is worth it and their sandwiches are delicious.\n\nOn Tuesday, August 19, I went in for my 8th card punch. I ordered a tuna melt to go, paid for it, and was handed a to-go placard with #24. I stood directly next to the cash register and waited, and waited, and waited. My wait seemed unusually long. Nearly 20 minutes passed. At NO time did anyone working there seem fazed by how long I was standing there or bother to check on my order.\n\nFinally, after realizing that food orders were being handed to customers who had arrived long after me, and seeing that there were NO tuna melts being prepared on the grill, I asked where my sandwich was. The manager lethargically picked up a soggy, abandoned box of food with #23 written on it, that had been sitting on the counter DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME FOR 20 MINUTES and said, \"It's right here. The girl wrote the wrong number on it\" and then he WALKED AWAY. NO apology. NO offer to re-heat my sandwich and fries, which were limp and cold. NO offer to make the mistake right - no voucher for a new sandwich, not even an extra punch on my card or any other compensation for my inconvenience. Absolutely nothing. The jerk just handed me an old sandwich that was as stone-cold as his rudeness, and walked away.\n\nIt was bad enough that the counter girl got my order number wrong, and the equally incompetent staff couldn't figure out that the unclaimed sandwich belonged to the customer standing next to the counter for 20 MINUTES. But the manager's rudeness sealed the experience: I paid $10 and 20 lunchtime minutes for a nasty, greasy, COLD tuna melt and fries, with an extra side of bad attitude.\n\nI understand that no one is perfect and that mistakes happen. It is how businesses HANDLE their screw-ups that make all the difference. In this case, that difference  means you've now lost a long-time customer who has worked around the corner for years.

I would have preferred a slightly longer wait to the nearly catastrophic fish and chips I was given at Manhattan Hub.  The fries were soggy, lifeless and just plain bland.  The three strips of lightly battered fried halibut were okay, but not memorable.  The problem is that the fish was not very tender and flaky, and was quite hard.  Overall, not a very satisfying lunch by any means.\n\nThe place, in terms of selection and quality, is similar to a deli one would typically find in Raley's or Safeway - lots of selection, very few of them are actually very memorable, but they are at least filling.  Like I said, this is a very generous three star rating.", "author": "Angel S."}

Poking around downtown SF, I've only heard of a couple places that actually offer this scrumptious sandwich. Manhattan Hub was one of them. Keep in mind, I had no reason to venture to this place other than their Reuben, since there are many more sandwich places of higher caliber nearer where I work.\n\nSo it was with great anticipation that I ordered their Reuben. I figure, if they're keeping true to most places east of the Mississippi, I couldn't go wrong. I mean, the Reuben is just five ingredients. Shouldn't be too hard to not muss it up, no?\n\nWho the heck puts mustard on a Reuben?! In the holy high canon of Reubens and their variants, I have never read of, seen, nor eaten one that had mustard on it. Strong deli mustard, at that! Now, this might have been a nice touch had it not overpowered the rest of the sandwich and drowned out the sour of the sauerkraut. It was a poor, confused sandwich.\n\nTo top it off, literally, it was between marble rye bread, a.k.a indecisive rye. Pick a side and do it well. Lacking in caraway and soft to the touch, it came apart quite easily when pulling at the rubbery corned beef. I'm not talking \"this is a little tough\" rubbery, but \"don't bite down too quick lest your chin bounce back and sprain your jaw.\" They could have at least toasted or seared the bread (like one should) to help maintain the structural integrity of the Reuben, but alas, that did not seem to be the case.\n\nSo mark me disappointed. On the plus side, I am not a big fan of coleslaw, but I didn't mind eating theirs. It was tangy and sweet. For all I know, the rest of their sandwiches might be decent, average fare. Personally, I will continue my quest for a good Reuben sandwich in the Financial District, or give up and just make and bring my own. Wouldn't be as \"fresh,\" but would be better than those found at the Manhattan Hub.", "author": "Higgins D."}

The spinach was crisp and the mozarella had a firm but moist texture.  The slivers of red onion were a really nice touch too.\n\nThe pesto pasta salad of course has pesto and pasta in it.  Also in the mix are broccoli, carrot shavings, black olives, and I believe some shredded parmesan cheese.  This is a great spring salad that has a nice cool feel in your mouth.  I'm a big fan of the carrots and olives so having them in there is wonderful.\n\nThe prosciutto pasta salad has peas in it, which I also love.  This salad has a bit of a spicy bite to it.  The prosciutto was on the road to drying out but you really can't have that sitting out for very long before that happens.  The flavor was still good.  The slight saltiness of the prosciutto, the crisp mellow flavor of the peas, and the spicy kick all work really well.\n\nYou really get a generous portion of each salad too.

That Gyro's are supposed to have Tahini sauce on them also listed on the menu.\n\nWhy then would you serve me a pita pocket wierdo salad/sandwich type thing thrown together and topped with hummus?

You can choose any of their salads: pasta, fruit, pasta with prosciutto, falafel.....soo many to choose from.  Every now and then I get cravings for Philly Cheese steak sandwiches.  sooo good!!!  I've even stopped by in the morning for a breakfast sandwich.  How can I say no to good food?", "author": "Mary H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-02-17", "description": "I like the falafel (although it is no comparison to the Oasis Grill) and I enjoy some of the salad selections (a little big for a lunchtime serving, but I guess portion control is a real personal thing).  The reason this gets a fourth star (since pedestrian food and nondescript interiors usually amount to three) - service.  Quick, efficient, accurate.  All I need when grabbing an oft-rushed lunch during the work day.  One of these days I'll listen to my mom and pack a lunch the night before.  Until then, this is a nice alternative.", "author": "Anjali K."}
