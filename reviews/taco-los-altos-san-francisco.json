The cheese enchiladas were just okay.  They were not very hot and the sauce tasted like pure tomato paste with not enough heat or spice to my liking.

Extra props to the chefs for offering hefty portions, fresh habanero salsa and crisp vegetable garnish on every plate.  I look forward to going back soon!

I can't help that I cannot live w/o Yelp; Yelp is a way of life, a necessity... but today's luncheon choice wasn't coordinated by me because I have been busy and cost was a factor but that did not mean the selected wasn't great.\n\nMy director have mentioned this taco place for awhile now and I'm glad one of the supervisors set this up for the luncheon.  Although this isn't so Christmas-y but it is nice to have the company you work for appreciate you by buying you lunch.  \n\nThere is one guy working the grill.  He comes early to set everything up: the salsa bar, the chips, the salad, and the bazillion bags of flour tortilla awaits the hungry.  There was also refried beans and rice.  You get a choice of meats: pollo, carne asada, and carnitas.  You can pick either a taco or a quesadilla.  I don't pig out when I'm not the one paying for it plus I think it's rather rude to pile your plate so I grabbed a little bit of salad, a small handful of tortilla chips, and a chicken quesadilla.  All orders took about 1-2 minutes, BTW.  The meats were all cooked, it was just heating the flour tortillas that took a brief moment.  My plate was not full compared to my coworkers... they were ordering 6 tacos and a quesadilla.  A lot of them went back for seconds and grabbed me to go so I caved but no tortillas on my second round: all protein but the sour cream was a deadly choice but I just have to have it.  \n\nThe carne asada was flavorful and tender but the chicken although flavorful and tender but was a little tough to chew (not chewy).  I just can't explain it.  My chicken quesadilla was fine, it was my second plate that had the tough chicken.  Chicken was bursting w/ flavor.. I can taste the cumin!\n\nI feel like garbage now though.  I had 2 slices of pizza and a garlic breadstick dipped w/ ranch this morning so do you know what this means?  Probably no dinner for me, no Twinkies when I get home, and I will need to burn 1,200 calories tomorrow at the gym.  \n\nNote to self: do the usual workout w/ the addition of Insanity.\n\nOi vey.. my diet ALWAYS start tomorrow.\n\nOh God..

They make their own fresh corn tortillas.\nYou haven't had real Mexican food till someone makes you a taco with a tortilla they made from scratch.\n\n2. They do not over cook the vegetables. \nThis is INSANELY important! So many Mexican restaurants cook their veggies in batches and let it sit in the cooker while it waits to be served so by the time it gets eaten 90% of vitamins, food value, chi, taste, are all but gone!\n\n3. They are fast! \nMy meal was ready in less than 10 minutes! \n\n4. This place has an excellent vibe! \nIts mellow, CLEAN, the waitresses are nice, nice art work on the walls, outdoor seating and its a generally good neighborhood with available parking.\n\nSo do yourself a favor, and please, treat yourself to the best Tacos north of the boarder.", "author": "Nicole W."}

They decided to buy me a taco in order to compensate me for my moral support (because a lot of moral support is needed when apartment hunting in this town, as we all know). We went in because a guy outside on the sidewalk said \"awesome fish tacos!!!\" - that was all the convincing I needed. \n\nThe said fish taco - ordered \"super\" for $4.95 total - was a grilled style fish taco - not beer battered. It was pretty a-okay, but you could get a similar one in the mission for about a dollar less. just saying. the fish WAS really good though - it was perfectly cooked and seemed like a fairly high quality cut of white fish. It also came with grilled mushrooms and peppers, a nice touch. \n\nWhat really annoyed me was that chips and salsa were NOT complimentary. C'mon now, folks.", "author": "Shannon R."}

I first came across their foo at my friends son's birthday party, it was amazing. The taquero serves tacos, tortas and quesadillas. They also set up a nacho bar with various salsas and guacamole. One nice touch is the agua frescas that you can have them serve.\n\nWe knew who to call when looking for a taquero for my son's baptism party. Taco los Altos can work with your budget to make sure that your event is a success. We served almost 100 people and everyone raved about the food. My wifes' family is Mexican and they thought everything was great, my father in law being particularly hard to please when it comes to Mexican food thought it was perfect. Taco los Altos showed up on time, very orderly set up, polite employees and undoubtedly great food. I am a huge fan, wide variety of meats and menu, no doubt I will use them again when we need a taquero. \n\nExtra star for serving the south bay area.

Yes, it's a seven dollar burrito, which is sort of wrong, but it's worth it.\n\nKeep in mind, I haven't eaten anything other than the super veggie burrito there, but that alone warrants five stars, seriously.\n\nThe place has a cozy atmosphere and is located on the always festive Cortland Ave., a short walk from my house when I need a burrito fix, which is fairly often.

I'm not sure if the guy who brought our food to our table got a good look at me, but he started speaking to ME in Spanish. Sitting right across the table from me was my half Mexican fiancee who looks more Latino than anything, but he didn't answer. Now, I've been mistaken for other nationalities, but only other Asian ones. Fortunately I hadn't forgotten all of my 4 years of AP Spanish that I took 10 years ago and I was able to converse with him. He was super nice and very attentive, as was the woman who had taken our order.\r\n\r\nWe shared an order of 4 taquitos with carnitas ($3.90), the Noel's special torta with carne asada ($3.50), and two carne asada tacos ($1.70 each). I thought it was a good amount of food, and $13 for a dinner for two is a great deal. The taquitos weren't my favorite though - they came as taco shells that were deep fried along with the meat inside, so the carnitas were a bit too dry and crispy for me. The torta was a large sandwich cut in two and the meat inside was very tasty. The tacos were good, and if I was more hungry, I could have probably eaten a few more because they were small. \r\n\r\nThere are lots of better taquerias around, but if you happen to be in Bernal, check this place out.

This is a tacqueria that doesn't seem out of place with the Liberty Cafe and its wine bar just down the street.  \n\nThey include an appealing assortment of grilled veggies in their vegetarian dishes (yes, that means you will find broccoli, zucchini and carrots in your super veggie burrito - not bad at all, but also not really what I typically want when I have a burrito craving).  That said,  if you are after a freaking gigantic veggie Tostada that will water your mouth or a sky-high order of impressive-looking veggie nachos, then Tacos Los Altos is definitely worth a try.

Yes, Mexican food is good, but this isn't it.\n\nAdmittedly, I have not tried all of their food. I do not eat meat, which is 90% of their menu, but I can get along anywhere in Mexico... They have a vegetable mixture that can be included in the standard taco, burrito experience but, it's not very good.  And WATERY as all get out. My plate is filled with water after a burrito.\n\nThey charge premium prices for their food (think Papalote), and the cuisine is not imaginative (as similarly priced competitors).\n\nI'm sure it would be better if you eat intestines, menudo and the like. I asked for their hot salsa on my burrito last time and it was so hot I got a horrible stomach ache and had trouble breathing, and I love hot food. \n\nI doubt I will never go there again, they would have to radically change their menu.", "author": "Freud R."}

This, of course, causes a dilemma for people who do not eat meat.  What should the put in their burrito instead of meat?  VEGETABLES!\n\nSadly, most places in San Francisco, even places that tout their skills at making a vegetarian burrito, do not replace the meat with vegetables.  They simply remove the meat from the burrito equation, leaving it unbalanced and incomplete.\n\nTacos Los Altos knows how to do the math.  Their vegetarian burritos are filled with delicious spiced, roasted vegetables.  The mixture varies - sometimes is broccoli-heavy, sometimes it zucchini-heavy, sometimes there are a lot of carrots.  But my god, delicious.\n\nI also humbly submit that they have the best chips in the city.  Crispy! Not crunchy.  Not crackly.  Crispy!\n\nFinally, Tacos Los Altos makes their own extremely spicy hot sauce.  I believe it has habeneros in it. Like a fire made of awesome in your gullet.", "author": "Ben B."}

If you want fresh grilled al pastor pork, chicken or shrimp tacos for your party, call Los Altos Tacos. I am very satisfied.", "author": "lola s."}

It was bland and unappetizing, like eating chewy water. The salsa that came with the greasy chips was also watery and tasteless. I can't afford to throw away any food so to try and salvage my meal I asked for some hot sauce and had to douse each bite just to get my taste buds activated. I will not be going here again.", "author": "Emily G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-10-08", "description": "This place keeps getting better and better over time. Stick with the tacos, burritos, and fajitas. Avoid the carne as it is dry and tasteless (another reviewer mentioned this.) I love getting a super shrimp burrito. Also, this is the only joint in the city which actually puts roasted veggies in its burritos- mmmm, muy bueno.", "author": "Mike K."}
