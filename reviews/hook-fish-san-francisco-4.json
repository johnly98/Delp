They realize how long their line can get and walk through to make sure everyone has a menu or has looked at one to speed things up. \n\nSecond of all, the food is incredible. We ordered chips with guacamole, which was incredibly flavorful. For my main meal, I had fish tacos. I asked for whatever fish they recommended and asked for it blackened. It was a bit hard to eat since everything was spilling out, but completely worth it. The blackened taste was amazing paired with the toppings. I also loved their spicy sauce. It added a nick kick to the taco.\n\nI will definitely come back here, especially since I live in the neighborhood. I'm pretty bummed I hadn't heard of it until recently.", "author": "Remy B."}

I was their first customer of the day and the staff were pretty chill. I ordered two tacos (Rockfish) and fish and chips. My order came out pretty quick and everything looked great! I really enjoyed the tacos! They were filling, well seasoned, and you could tell they only cook with fresh caught fish  The fries were awesome too! They are seasoned as well and taste way better than your traditional fries. The fried fish from the fish and chips was decent but I won't be ordering it again. Their tacos and fries just stood out more to me.\n\nThis was an awesome place to visit during my lunch break. It is pretty small so I would definitely recommend visiting during off peak hours (read another review that mentioned long lines on a Friday evening). I am adding this place into my San Francisco rotation and I will be visiting again.", "author": "Christopher W."}

The fish is fresh and you can even read how it was caught. The hot sauce is a fine puree of spice and flavor.

They give you information about where it was caught, how it was caught, and on what vessel was it caught. Plus the fish  on display for you at the counter and they alllook beautiful. \n\n2 tacos with any fish you want will run you $16, and they will mostly fill you up but you may need some chips or fries to go with it. The tacos are beautifully decorated and bursting with color: super red pico, bright avocado, pink sliced radishes and slaw, nicely grilled fish, and a single fluffy tortilla as the base. I wish the tacos had a little more kick to them -- the spicy aioli isn't very spicy -- but it's still an awesome bite. I went with the lingcod fish which was hearty with some softer texture but now very chewy at all. \n\nWould definitely try the burrito next time though because it sounds awesome too.", "author": "Jason S."}

Why did I think fish would be fresh in Iowa? Why did I even go to Iowa? Why do we let Iowa be a state? So many questions, not enough time to answer them all--but what I can say is that Hook Fish's tacos have made me see the light again! These are so damn fresh that there's absolutely no fishy smell or aftertaste. \n\nI had the grilled fish of the day tacos for $13, a bottle of beer for $6, and split an order of poke + chips ($9) with a friend. The pickled slaw and spicy aioli of the tacos really go well with the subtle flavors of the fish! The spicy and salty combo of the poke + chips was also very spot on. Portions are on the smaller side but, then again, we are in SF. \n\nTip: The shop is pretty tiny and there's not a lot of seats (i.e. not good for big groups), so definitely try to get there as it opens if you're going on a weekend.", "author": "Rie U."}

Sometimes it comes out fantastic, and other times it comes out really disappointing. I think it really depends on who is making your burrito, which is my main gripe with this place. There is a lack of consistency, almost feels like whenever I go I'm taking a \"risk\" hoping the person who makes my burrito is someone good. I don't want to ever feel like I'm taking a risk.\n\nWhen the burrito is good, it's good. Large chunks of avocado, fish, warm soft rice, soft beans, all in a big burrito. When it's good I'm left feeling very satisfied that I got my entire $15 worth of burrito.\n\nWhen the burrito is bad, it's bad, and it happens multiple times (probably over 10 times). I've had burritos here with hard rice and hard beans, almost like it's undercooked or something. I've also had the pibil burrito where they accidentally leave multiple cinnamon sticks in so when you bite it it hurts your teeth. The one I'm currently eating barely has any avocado and the burrito is quite tiny and holds no weight. The one I'm currently eating I have to spit out some of the rice because it's too tough to bite through.\n\nI would say that it's a 50/50 chance that you'll get a good or bad burrito. But, at $15 per burrito, I shouldn't have to be taking this chance. It should be 100% of the time that I'm getting a large, quality burrito, without any parts that are hard to bite through. If they improve the quality control, I will be happy to keep coming back more. I'm really hoping they read this honest review and make improvements, because sometimes it's really frustrating.

A lot about this shack reminds me of Outerlands down to its reclaimed wood furniture and eco-conscious of food sources.\n\nWe ordered a variety of food here and here are the 2 things you shouldn't miss\n\nTuna Poke appetiser - nicely done, tasty and good portions. Served with chips.  Only comment is that it would be even better if the chunks can be cut smaller so it fits better on the chips \n\nFish and Chips - the batter is crispy and the fish is very fresh.  The fries (chips) are well seasoned and just done right.  Don't miss this. \n\nWe also ordered the fish taco and burrito and I would say that they're just ok. The fish taco is hard to pick up to eat because it's lot of stuff piled on top.\n\nThe food doesn't come cheap.  2 tacos or a burrito run you $13 each.  Fish and chips cost $17 for 3 pieces of fish", "author": "Jannie Q."}

Again, simple, very fresh, everything you want a fish plate to taste like...otherwise, here are our take aways: \n\n1. Well trained, service oriented team working here that knows their product = fresh fish.\n\n2. Friendly atmosphere which seems so rare these days!\n\n3. Layout and design is simple, beachy, functional and very cool/relaxing.\n\n4. EVERY dish we ordered was fresh tasting and cooked perfectly.\n\nThe menu is linked to the catch of the day - locally and the fish is displayed on ice (like at a sushi restaurant).\n\nIf you are in the area check it out...we are NOT locals but always visit here when we hike nearby and take the kids to the SF ZOO.\n\nVery casual, kid friendly with some outdoor seating.

Good fries too. \n\nWe also ordered a salad that came way after we finished our tacos and fish and chips luckily by asking the waitress but it probably would have never come back. Bland bland salad. No herbs, plain dressing and the nut clusters are a bit weird and don't really compliment anything but just add unwanted texture that tastes like dried seaweed snacks. \n\nWasn't impressed but will possibly try this spot again for a fish burger or the burrito.

You could really tell that the fish was fresh. There were definitely enough chips for the amount of fish given. Though a bit pricey, we were surprised at the amount of fish given. \n\nThe staff is super friendly and the concept of the restaurant is cool (only serving sustainably caught fish).There seems to be plenty of street parking around.

You first place your order at the register, find a place to sit, and somebody will call out your name and bring you your food. \n\nI think we will be back to try the poke burritos (they looked pretty large and the burritos were grilled before serving) as well as the fish and chips.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

We kinda want to try this place again, but I'm not too sure I want to go out of my way for a \"maybe\".\n\nSo we ordered fish burritos instead (rockfish and halibut) because hey, the place looks good anywho. Here's a breakdown of the pluses and minuses:\n\n- BURNT. Holy crap, every other bite was acrid.\n- Portion size: Where was the fish? It wasn't much and half of it I couldn't taste the fish or filling because all I tasted was burnt.\n- It was filling because there was mostly rice instead of fish.\n\n- Was it halibut? Well, it was nowhere as delicious as the one my mom bought and cooked. Nor did it taste much different than the rockfish.\n- Hella dry fish in both (2) burritos... do people really eat fish like this.\n\n+ The slaw and everything else in the burrito was really yummy, BUT I ordered a *FISH* burrito. I want the fish to be good.\n+ Customer service was good and friendly!\n\n* The Physical Space: it's small... But not a mom and pop's place, not a true hole-in-the-wall (when there's a lot of exterior seating and decorations). It has a really bougie/hip vibe. But, I am neutral about how the place looks and feels. I kinda like it but I don't.\n\nOverall, burnt-flavored fish is inexcusable.", "author": "Lilian C."}

As a born and raised local of the outer sunset, i'm happy to see all the influx of new restaurants and establishments booming all around the neighborhood. Hook fish co offers a nice variety of fresh, sustainable seafood options that will also tantalize your taste buds. \n\nParking is a hit or miss around here- all neighborhood and may be tough. Seating is limited, and if you're coming with a big party I suggest you either A.) order to-go or brave the fog and sit outside. \n\nHook Fish have an assortment of dishes including their fish chowder (more of a red soup base) that was absolutely delicious. Besides that, other staples include fish and chips, fish tacos, fish and/or poke burrito, and fish sandwich. You can also purchase fresh fish by the lb here ( think). Their philosophy is to purchase and sell local fish, which is great, but also means an increase in price.\n\nOverall, the qualify of the items were great. We had the chowder and wished we ordered a larger bowl. The BF was satisfied with the first sandwich and I was amazed by the flavors in the grilled fish tacos.\n\nSo...with all the high remarks, why 3 stars instead of four? Well, you definitely have to pay a higher premium for the qualify of your dishes, but hey, it's good food and it taste good. Nonetheless, for our order of fish tacos (2), fish sandwich, and  CUP of chowder, it was close to $40. \n\nI would suggest if you're hungry to probably grab a snack before you come here and/or eat after since the plate definitely didn't fill me up. The tacos were quite tiny (tiny and delicious yes), but oh so small. I would probably come back for a quick bite, but not as a go to dinner option. Prices quickly adds up.", "author": "Diane T."}

I couldn't finish the grilled fish tacos because they were so bland. Ah and I especially didn't like the cabbage that leaked an unappetizing purple juice everywhere, blegh. I'm getting a stomach ache thinking about it. \nSecondly, value: four fish tacos, two oysters, chips + guac set us back $50. \n\nI would actually return to try the fish and chips since that looked tasty, though realistically may just continue deferring to Devil's Teeth.", "author": "Leah F."}

Very good, very fresh and generous.\n\nThe place is super small with a communal table inside that can seat 10-12.

I was especially \"hooked\" by their sustainable fish/food philosophy (yum!), the restaurant's surfer twist and minimalist decor, and unique residential location.\n\nWe arrived at 11:30 (when they opened) so we were the first ones in line. We ordered the ceviche, the poke, the fish burrito, the special seafood chowder, and the two piece fish and chips. Overall, the fish and chips stole the show. The batter was crispy and seasoned and the fish was expectedly fresh and soft. The accompanying dill tartar sauce added a sharp and creamy taste to the battered fish. The rest of the dishes I would give a solid 3 stars. The ceviche was yummy and spicy and the poke was fresh, but I didn't really taste the sauce. The fish burrito was hearty and fresh but it too lacked salt and seasoning. The chowder tasted similar to minestrone soup but the stuff to soup ratio was a bit too high for my liking. There were also a couple of stray fish bones. \n\nI bumped my review up one star because we had excellent service. On top of that, I really loved how they revamped the restaurant to give it an authentic oceanside vibe and aesthetically pleasing touch.

Best Fish and Chips OF MY LIFE!  \n\nWe walked into this tiny, possibly hipster seafood shack and didn't know what to expect.  The ambiance reminded us of being inside a small yacht- cute wooden wall features and an open kitchen.  Small uneven wood stumps for stools lined the cold case and communal tables were the only seating choices.\n\nAll my anti-hipster doubts were erased by the kind and charming young man taking our order.  He was perfectly personable- and dreamy to boot!\n\nAs we just came back from a weekend trip to San Diego, we had to order the Fish tacos.  We weren't satisfied with the tacos down in SD.  But let me tell you the fish tacos at Hook are OFF THE HOOK!!  (Pun intended.) Nice freshly grilled fish with ALL the proper fixins.  Cabbage slaw and fresh veggies topped with crema.  \n\nWhile we enjoyed our meal, I spotted a bowl of BALLS in the open kitchen.  What are those?  I wondered, never passing up an opportunity for some fried dough action.  Dessert?  I then observed the cook pick up a ball and place it into a tortilla press.  WAIT WAH???  FRESH TORTILLAS??  No.  I.  Don't.  Believe.  It.  \n\n'Twas true.\n\nGuys, this also explained why the Tortilla chips that came with our ceviche were SO damn amazing that I wanted to hog the whole thing.  And believe me, I did. (*note to owner: we think calamari would have been a better protein than white fish for the ceviche)\n\nThen came our Fish and Chips.  Holy lord.  I thought I had the best FC in London but no way.  These were so good we were fighting over the last bite.  Ok, more like I didn't protest when I was offered the last bite.  And I usually do.  The chips/fries?  My FAVORITE kind.  Medium cut, perfectly crisp, and expertly seasoned.  I was in heaven.  It brought back memories of my college years when only the fries at the Haas school of business cafeteria could satisfy my fried food cravings.  I'm picky about my fries 'mkay?\n\nOverall a memorably delicious quick and casual meal.  The food was fresh and perfectly cooked, and the guys working behind the counter were professional and looked like they were a tight team.  \n\nWe'll be back as regulars.

Totally added to the 'staycation' vibe I was going with after a perfect walk on the beach. Fresh fish is the name of the game here. I wish this was my local spot as they have a ton of fresh fish for sale, as well as a nice, but limited menu of fish tacos, burrito, fish & chips and a few other options. You can opt for grilled fish or poke in most of the options they offer.\n\nSeating inside is limited with one long communal table, a standing bar and a raw bar seating area. Outside seating consists of some benches that you sort of eat over your to-go box. Just an fyi, as at least on weekends, it seems to get quite busy.\n\nAlthough I don't find this place to be pricey, you don't get much fish for what you're paying for. They were out of burrito tortillas, and we ended up splitting guac & chips (not worth the $8), fish tacos, fish sandwich and an agua fresca - with tip it was close to $50. We enjoyed the sandwich more than the tacos, as the flavors were more pronounced, but there really wasn't a ton of fish in either dishes; just a very thin sort of spread. The sandwich at $13 would have been better if it came with some chips or a small side, or I would have been much happier paying more for a thicker piece of fish. Charge me $18, but give me a small filet. Something.\n\nThe tacos ($13) were great with a homemade tortilla and fresh cabbage, but you couldn't even taste the fish. Again, the actual fish amount was pretty small. $13 isn't cheap, but again, I'm more happy to pay a few more dollars if that means there's more meat to the dish. \n\nAll in all, we left full, but not necessarily on fish.\n\nI LOVE that the fish is seriously so fresh and local, and from the small taste, great flavor. I love the vibe here, but I may be the only person in the world that says something like this in a Yelp review: let me pay more and give me more fish vs having to order more items that just fill me up with \"filler.\" Does that make sense? \n\nJust my two cents. 100% come check this spot out. It nails service, vibe and offers up super fresh fish, I just wish I could opt to order a meatier item (and pay for it!).", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

It really had a whole, Nor Cal kind of vibe.  The d\u00e9cor was laid back and the outdoor seating with sunshining a cool 61 degrees is just what the doctor ordered coming from a brisk 27 degree Seattle.\nBut down to the food... I had the poke burrito. Spending a few years in Hawaii and being over taken by the Poke craze in Seattle... I honestly wasn't impressed by what HF served up.  The tuna didn't seem as fresh as everyone described how fresh the fish is at HF.  There was more slaw than fish and the Ahi itself looked a bit discolored, like a dark brown versus a vibrant red.  \nThe crab cakes at $18 for two pieces was a sky high price but delicious.  Can't say it's worth it but it was definitely one of the better crab cakes I've ever had.  Ample amount of crab in every bite, perfect crunchy texture on the outside.  I wish there was hot sauce as all I saw was ketchup and a sweet sauce of some sort, however I didn't ask if they had any. \nFrench fries were pretty on point as well.\nBottom line - if you love fish tacos I'm sure this is the spot to be, I wouldn't recommend the poke burrito.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-02", "description": "I've tried their burrito, sandwich, and fish and chips and everything has been amazing. If you're hungry, probably get the burrito. I usually go with the fish of the day, but the poke is good too. I love the spicy carrot stuff on all my orders. Also, the french fries are great. They serve wine, agua fresca, beer, and sparkling flavored water. \n\nTiny spot. Clean. Always a line but it goes quickly. The people who work there are nice and friendly with customers and each other. You can sit outside or inside - bar area facing the kitchen, communal table inside and outside, and little tables outside next to the sidewalk. I've never had a problem finding a place to sit after I ordered my food.\n\nMinus one star because it's kind of pricey for the quantity of food. \n\nNo stars deduced for the weirdest experience I've had at a restaurant. I asked for no pico on my burrito given a tomato allergy, and asked for it on the side so I could give it to a friend. I saw my burrito being made, given I was standing by the wooden bar table thing. The person making the burrito put pico in it (so I thought it wasn't mine), but then realized their mistake after re-reading the receipt thing that said no pico, and was scooping it out of the burrito. The burrito was rolled up and given to me. I pointed out what I saw, not because I'm a brat but because I sincerely am allergic. Someone told me the burrito maker was scooping the pico to one side of my burrito, since I asked for it \"on the side.\" This was false, because they remade me a burrito (thank you) and gave me the pico one to keep/throw away/give away (so awk). I gave it to my friend. It had no pico \"on the side\" - just remnants of the juices. Why lie about it? So awkward. I love this place and go back all the time. That's why I'm not deducting stars for this. But I hope they take allergies a tad more seriously - I'm not crazy and realize there is the possibility of coming into contact with my allergens at facilities that use the ingredients, but this was kind of too much.", "author": "Nelya T."}

Not in any place one has the feeling of being in your own garden while sitting on the street. \n\nIn any case, enough about the decoration.

For true local sourcing, step up to the counter and learn where and how the fish you're ordering was caught and perhaps even the fisherman's name. If you don't buy into in this kind of sustainability or understand how it works, you might get sticker shock at the menu prices, but remember who you're supporting and why.\n\nI've tried the fish burrito, poke burrito and fish tacos and the poke burrito is far and away the best item so far. It's a good size without being overwhelming. Don't miss their hot sauces (serve yourself from bottles on tables) to add on as you please. \n\nIt's also a beautifully designed space. It's small, however, with one communal table and some bar seating inside. Outside, there are small benches where you can park yourself and enjoy fresh seafood within spitting distance of Ocean Beach (or even better, take to-go and eat at said beach).", "author": "Elena K."}

Unsurprisingly, the popular place was packed on a Sunday afternoon, but the atmosphere was so cheery and bustling, clean and well decorated with wide open windows and genuinely friendly staff, that the wait was surprisingly pleasant.  And I think this is definitely a place that rewards patience; in order to keep up with the rapid demand they seem to have developed a system by which the line cooks prepare a batch of each kind of dish (burrito, sandwich, etc) at a time.  Since our party of three ordered a salad, sandwich, and burrito, we each had to wait vastly different amounts of time for our orders and even ended up basically eating separately.  Despite this chaotic and somewhat confusing system, the freshness and quality of the fish was hard to argue with.  I'm not sure I'd want to fight the weekend crowds again, but if I'm ever in the area during off-peak hours I would for sure wanna stop back in here.", "author": "Mary C."}

We got 2 Pacificos, ceviche, tacos, and fish and chips. It was $65. That is way too much to be ordering from and then picking up the food from the counter. \nThe seating sucked! After paying $65 for my meal and feeling a little bit like a sucker for it, I went to sit at my seat at the bar, which was a tree stump, with a chainsawed notch for my feet. I was crammed in there such that my right arm was jammed against the wall, resulting in T-Rex arm.\nThe staff looked like a fucking side show. You know, I'm all for expressing one's individual style, but when I pay a lot at a restaurant, I'm expecting a little ambiance and maybe a little professionalism. Neck tattoos and goofy Where's Waldo hipster beanies aren't doing it for me. And while we are on the topic of professionalism... When I asked for a little more tartar sauce, I watched Waldo #1 (there were 2 idiots with the same reservoir tip beanies on) slather a bunch of the sauce on his fingers and then spoon it off of his ungloved fingers into the cup and then hand it to me. Not very impressive.\nAnd the little Latin guy was just running around flinging beans and cabbage everywhere. Slamming plates, fucking up orders and generally giving the appearance of working really fast, but not really getting anything done. He couldn't stand still, I think he was tweakin'.\nAll of these complaints would not be a big deal, in the sort of place that it is, a little beach seafood shack, except it was $65.\nHalf that would have been fair.

We sat down with our dog and were promptly greeted and brought water, hot sauce and menus by the waitstaff. They were friendly and attentive. The atmosphere was super casual full of other san franciscans relishing their Saturday afternoon. The menu is a mix of multicultural and comfort food. I ordered the crab burger and my friend order the fish sandwich. We shared salmon ceviche to start. It was served with really fresh ingredients and nice quality fish and crispy fried tortilla chips. My grab burger was full of fresh Dungeness crab and super tasty. My friends fish sandwich was also good and less flavorful. We enjoyed our meal in the sunshine.

We were going to eat there but there's limited seating so we took the food to go. The staff was super friendly. My girlfriend and I saw good reviews on Yelp so we decided to try it out because it was in the neighborhood we were hanging out at. Since I love poke I got the poke burrito. (I'm a poke snob/foodie) I'm not a fan of burritos but the cashier suggested it since it was one of their most popular items. I'm always hesitant to try poke anywhere other than Hawaii (by far the best Tuna poke ever)\nThe burrito was the size of the burritos you find at the authentic taqueria's in the Mission (some what large). When I bit into it there was no poke until the 3rd bite. After opening it up, There was maybe 2 Tbsp of tuna. Not much for a burrito that size. It was disappointing since the burrito cost $13. It was mostly filled with white rice, some black beans, salsa, a few slices of avocado and lots of cabbage. The flavors were good. Tuna was on the browner side probably due to being marinated in sesame oil/soy sauce. \nMy girlfriend tried the blackened fish sandwich. She saw the pics online and she liked the french roll it was on, the pics also showed a nice size filet of fish. When we got home it was on a buttery hamburger bun with 3 index fingered size pieces of fish. The flavors were there also with the tarter, cucumbers, cabbage, and peperoncinis. More bun than fish. Not worth the $13 also. We would love to go back but the skimpy seafood portions don't  justify their prices.", "author": "Elyssa P."}

Although I made eye contact with the young lady taking orders I was not greeted or even acknowledged. I approached the young lady at the register, smiled and said \"Hi!. Can I get\".....I was ignored and she acknowledged another girl coming in through the door, grabbed some keys from her and began to have a conversation right in front of me without acknowledging  my presence, while I just stood there feeling awkward and confused as to what was going on.  I was so caught off guard and taken back I just stood there feeling embarrassed and disrespected. She just stood there looking at me as if to say \"if you want something you better ask for it!!\"  I felt like shit! I just turned around shook my head and walked out. I was never asked if I could be helped. There were three other people in the restaurant who all had plates full of food and appeared happy. They were all WHITE PEOPLE   I can't but help to wonder if all people of color are treated in this negative manner at this establishment. Did the other white patrons have the same awful experience?? DOUBT IT!! When the white and privileged continue to outright disrespect, prejudge, and stoop people of color to a lower level than their peers, there is NO WONDER why we in 2017 are still crying out \"Black Lives Matter!\"  Because  places like Hook Fish co. make us feel like we don't.", "author": "Snooty F."}

There are a few tables outside as well as a longer bench.  We opted to just get food to go.  We had the avocado tacos (Robert's on a Fish Are Friends, Not Food thing.  Thanks, Disney.), poke, and poke burrito.  It took about 10 minutes to get our order.\n\nThe avocado tacos were tacos with slices of avocados.  Nothing fancy, and in hindsight, I should've just made his avocado tacos at home because we had everything there.  \n\nThe poke with about 2 to 3 ounces of poke with a handful of chips.  It seemed pretty expensive for what we got, but I May just be accustomed to buying poke in Hawaii where we can get a pound for $12.  \n\nThe poke burrito was good.  I wish it had more poke.  I'm a firm believer that any ____ burrito should be made up of that _____.  Like a carne asada burrito should have carne asade in every bite.  Along those lines, a poke burrito should have poke in every bite.  We opened it up and determined that the poke burrito had about as much poke as the order of poke, possibly less.  I'd have preferred the rice and beans to be cold, since the poke should be cold.  After finishing this, I was still hungry and made some quesadillas at home.\n\nThey have house made hot sauce.  They're in bottles here, and they'll put them in little containers for to go food.  It's REALLY good.  It's not too spicy, but it is flavorful.  Try it!\n\nI liked the food, but I wish the portions were a little bigger.  If I ever learn to cook fish, I'll probably pick it up from here.  I love the mission and idea behind this place.\n\nIf I had to choose between Hook Fish and Sushirrito, I'd choose Sushirrito every time.", "author": "ROB L."}

I ask gentlemen at the cashier if my order is coming, the response was \"you are next\", I waited for another 10 min, a total of 30 mins since the order was placed I ask the same gentleman the status of my order, \" it's coming\". Food never came , We end up leaving the place after wasted $62 for two tacos, salad and beer including 20% tip ( for not getting my food at all, not know ahead of time as you prepay before you get food) All I got back is $ 14.10, horrible service and no apology for waste of my time and money.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-07-09", "description": "Was really excited to give this place a shot and left pretty disappointed. In short, the food is super overpriced, under-portioned, and bland.\n\nAround 60 bucks got us a burrito, poke, 2 fish tacos, and two Pacificos. The burrito was $16 bucks because their fish of the day was Rockfish and since I wanted the halibut it was $3 extra. The way it works is, even though they have like 5 fish to choose from, they select just one to make all their fish dishes with that day, and if you want another one, it's gonna cost you. Forcing your decision and jacking up the price as a result of wanting a choice is pretty lame. $13 got you tiny fish tacos that should be $10 or $11. \n\nThe poke was pretty damn good. Smaller size but that's expected with that kind of dish. Flavor was solid, fish was fresh. \n\nThe halibut in my burrito was really tasty and fresh. The problem is that there was barely any in it for that $16 price tag. Seriously only got fish in about 4 bites of it. It was almost exclusively loaded with plain white rice and black beans. Not only is that filler, but there was no discernible seasoning in the rice, making it even more bland. The menu says there's pickled slaw, spicy aioli, and pico de gallo in the burrito, I didn't taste or see any evidence of this. 16 bucks for plain beans and rice. \n\nThe fish tacos were initially forgotten by the staff, even though they were on the order and we were charged, so we had to remind them to bring those around. There wasn't really any apology or compensation for that. Again, the fish was really tasty, reallly tiny. The slaw and aioli I was missing was on these though. \n\nUltimately, it's just far too expensive and far too underwhelming to justify coming here. There's a reason they don't list their prices on their website (which is pretty obnoxious anyway), and that's because if you knew how much it was going into it, you'd go somewhere else; trust me, go somewhere else. If I'm shelling out that kind of money, there are a billion places it's better spent. Go to Sotto Mare and get a giantic bowl of amazing cioppino to feed 3 for $40.", "author": "Steve B."}

Yes, the portions aren't huge and I was not overfull but my husband and I left plenty full. I do wish there was more guacamole for the chips.

They play great music too.\n\nIt's small, so don't expect a sit down meal. There are benches outside, a handful of bar seats, and a big table. Come with friends or make new ones, and by all means, don't be a kook.\n\nThanks for opening a great place in our neighborhood, I plan to visit often.", "author": "Jesse H."}

Fish tacos were tasty and were good if you like Californian fish tacos with lots of slaw and avocado on top. They ran out of poke so we couldn't get the poke burrito but got the special tuna belly instead. By boyfriend enjoyed that. It was flavorful, but still a ton of rice and beans. All in all a bit over priced but tasty. I'd likely go. Can for the fish and chips and to try to poke. I do like their sustainability focus, which likely is the reason for their high prices.", "author": "Wanchee P."}

The most important thing I want to point out is that they are committed to offering SUSTAINABLE and relatively local seafood.

It feels like an Outer Sunset ritual, the perfect beach spot before or after a day in the water. Their menu is incredibly impressive, each dish listed on the wall was caught that day, giving a great variety to their already amazing sandwiches, fried fish, poke, and soups. This may be the best fish spot in San Francisco by a mile. The staff is incredibly passionate about their craft, you can tell their customers' culinary experience is their primary driving force, and it shows with each interaction. Hook's interior and outdoor seating are gorgeous, allowing for meals to be shared with friends (or an intimate date if you wish to impress).

It's been my fourth day in a row going. First day. Poke burrito. Phenomenal. Next day, seafood chowder with bacon and the fish sandwich. Wow the fish sandwich. Next day half dozen oysters and fish and chips. First of all miyagis on the half shell for two bucks a piece all day is dope. The fish and chips. Damn. Best tartar sauce ever. Then today. I grabbed a modest quarter pound of beautiful halibut. Baked that piece at 400 for 11 minutes which may have been one minute too much but regardless it was the single best piece of halibut Ive ever cooked. Buttery, delicate, flakey, and simply brilliant. Hookfish is killer. Go there. Drink Pacifico. Eat everything. This is a sick addition to the hood and I'm stoked for all the guys and gals apart of this !", "author": "Jimmy W."}

This stoner is a white privileged fool along with being way to high. He was super nice to the white people in front of me and the white people after me.
