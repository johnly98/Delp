We KNEW that this place would be overpriced, BUT, we came for the nice decor and relaxing environment and just wanted to get away from the usual Mother's Day crowd... what we didn't expect is the POOR and INATTENTIVE SERVICE.\n\nFrom the moment my party was seated, we were pretty much ignored the entire time while other tables were being served and greeted.  Our server was nowhere to be found.\n\nWhat seemed like a long time (I'm sure it's like 5-10 mins) someone finally brought the table water.  We waited some more...  Still, no menu, no waiter, no greeter.  My sister finally walked to the Maitre 'd to complain about this.  Then long behold, the waiter FINALLY arrived.  By this time, we're 25 mins in after being seated.  Well, he simply passed some menus around and then left... again..  and again, no where to be found.  By the way, he was also short 3 menus... ok, no big deal I guess; we can share.  But this just speaks to the level of inattentiveness.\n\nThen, after reviewing the menu for another 10'mins, we need to FIND OUR WAITER so that we can order our food.  My sis has to go to the Maitre'd to ask for someone to help us, AGAIN.  This time, we're told that there are actually 2 servers who back each other up and apparently, our primary server is pretty awful and the other waiter was supposed to pick up the slack...  well, sorry, I don't really care!  Can we just get some help here, and mind you, we're paying $20 for a bagel here so I do expect some service!! \n\nWell, throughout our brunch, my sis pretty much had to coach the waiters every step of the way...  take away the empty coffee cups, more half and half for coffee please, more sugar, more coffee, more water, take away the empty plates...  what the heck! \n\nFor our party of 14, we pretty much ordered everything on their limited menu.  All items tasted decent to pretty good, but everything is twice the price than what one might expect to pay :\n\n$16 pancakes -- very good, 3 very fluffy pancakes\n$23 smoked salmon bagel -- good but a similar bagel at New York Bagel would be $7\n$28 Crab benedict -  pretty good\n$19 Chicken Club sandwich -- ok, but awful chips \n$16 -- Steel cut oatmeal.  Well, it's oatmeal \n\nWhen servers brought out the plates, they were very confused and did not have a clue which plate goes where and simply yelled out the name of the dish, waiting for us to raise our hand to claim the entree.\n\nAWFUL SERVICE.  Again, we KNEW we'd be paying for mediocre food but we came for the nice ambience and to avoid the crowd.  What we didn't come for is a 18% mandatory gratuity and awful service.  \n\nYep, there is a reason why this place is never busy.", "author": "Winnie W."}

I finally planned to come here for dinner after purchasing a TravelZoo deal $69 dinner for two that included one Share dish, two \"Taste\" dishes, and two Mains, plus 20% off bottles of wine.  Without this deal, I feel that the individual dishes at regular menu prices are delicious but just not amazing enough to warrant the cost.\n\nWe selected the charcuterie board for our Share dish. It included paper-thin Italian cold cuts, pan-fried crostini, tomato jam, stone ground mustard and a sharp, cheddar-like cheese.  I love charcuterie and think this stood out as one of the best parts of the meal. \n\nWe were also super happy with our \"Taste\" plates. I chose Creamy Tomato Soup with Grilled Cheese Toast, and the BF chose Roasted Scallops.  Both of these dishes were flawlessly executed, but here is where things started to go wrong with the service.  No sooner had the Taste dishes arrived then the Mains arrived as well.  Now we also had plates of Flat Iron Steak and Sauteed Branzino on the table that were about to get cold while we finished the hot soup and scallops.  The waiter basically apologized as he was setting the Mains on the table and started the delivery by saying he could return them to be heated.  But, we really didn't want fish and steak to be heated up!\n\nPortions for the Mains were small, while portions for the other two courses were average.  My BF's flat iron steak turned out to be a few slices.  It was properly cooked medium rare, but seemed under-seasoned. It really didn't have very much flavor. \n\nI was happier with my Branzino.  It was simply but perfectly prepared with a crispy skin, but I definitely wished for a bigger portion. It seemed like barely 3 ounces of fish, and maybe 1 or 2 sliced fingering potatoes with a bit of leeks.  I have to wonder if the portion sizes for the mains weren't down-graded due to our TravelZoo coupon.\n\nOverall, I'm neutral about TRACE as a culinary experience, but it's a beautiful space and I feel overall that it's a good dining experience if you want a relaxed and generally good meal in downtown SF.  Just purchase a deal for value.", "author": "Sheri W."}

Made a reservations for 6pm on a Saturday night and there was plenty of seating. It didn't end up being too busy till around 7pm.\n\nOur server was Roger and he was amazing! Really attentive and checked up on our table throughout the night.\n\nMy friend and I both opted into their $40 restaurant week deal and wine pairings for an additional $15. The wine pairing consist of 2 wine, a white and red (but you can request something else if you have a preference). For my meal, I ordered the roasted brussel sprouts, Duck confit, and Vanilla bread pudding. My friend got the Pork belly, duck confit, and chocolate ganache.  We also shared an order of their West Coast Oysters.\n\nFor the starters, the brussel sprouts had a pleasant crispness to it and the seasoning was good. It seemed more like a dish to be shared than to be consumed by one individual. I tried the pork belly and it had a nice balance of fat to meat. It also had a side of julliened green apples which I didn't really fit with the dish, but I assumed acted as a palate cleanser between bites of the pork.  The highlight of the entire meal definitely had to be the Oysters!  Our server said they were shigoku oysters from Washington and it was served with a mignonette, shallots, and garnished with a piece of small cilantro. Definitely try these if you are a fan of oysters, they were delicious!\n\nFor the entree, the duck confit was sadly lackluster. The duck was cooked perfectly fine, but I felt like it was a bit underseasoned. It came with three fried duck croquettes, farro, and some type of greens. It just wasn't that impressive after having a positive experience with the appetizers.\n\nFor the dessert, the bread pudding is typical of what you expect. It wasn't too heavy which was nice.  The chocolate ganache was definitely a better dessert. They give you a decent size of ganache. It would have been too rich by itself, but when served with the cookie butter ice cream and marshmallow, it becomes quite the treat. If you are a fan of chocolate, that definitely is the way to go. They also had a kaffir lime Panna Cotta, which I should have tried instead, but alas.\n\nOverall the experience was great. The setting was fancy and intimate, our server Roger was great, and food for the most part was pleasant.", "author": "Jacky C."}

The restaurant is right next to the MOMA in the middle of SOMA so you'll probably want to Bart out here instead of driving. \n\nService was spectacular. Our waiter was very pleasing and you could tell he really likes to work here and he really likes food. Very good with recommendations and explaining how the flavors work together. Also checked up on us after every dish to see if we liked it and talked to us about why we liked it which i appreciate. \n\nIn addition to the set menu we decided to get the wine pairing for $15 and also oysters for $15. ALL SO WORTH IT. \n\nMy first course was the pork belly with a butternut squash puree and finely sliced pears. The heaviness of the pork belly was very well balanced by the squash and pears. But the most amazing part was it's pairing with a glass Riesling. The cold sweet crisp taste of the wine after taking a bite of the pork was remarkable! \n\nWe then had the oysters, which is must say were one of the best oysters I've ever had and would definitely come back and get more. They're fresh oysters from Washington with some champagne vinaigrette, shallots, and cilantro. The shallots and cilantro added a very nice texture that went along with the vinaigrette that enhanced the taste of the oyster. I'm so glad this is on their regular menu.\n\nMain course was the duck confit. The duck was duck. It was tender however I felt it was lacking a little pick of flavor. It did go well with the oats and almond farro but I think I was looking for something a little more. I was impressed with the duck croquette though. Maybe since this isn't on their regular menu that it wasn't as good. \n\nLastly, dessert. Chocolate ganache will always have my heart. They gave us a quite a fair share of ganache. I was a bit worried it would be too heavy and I wouldn't be able to finish it, however it came with a small scoop of cookie butter ice cream, a toasted marshmellow, and some graham cracker crumbs that balanced out the ganache quite well. I finished the whole thing. Could've had another plate if I wanted to. \n\nWe had a wonderful time.", "author": "Tatiana T."}

It was an inventive way to present the dish and it was really photogenic as well. :-) The cutlet was fried well and didn't have too much breading.

It was part of a deal with Travel Zoo so we had a discounted meal, but waiter Roger treated us as if we were ripping them off. Service charge at 20% ($25!) was automatically added based on the undiscounted value of the meal so it's not clear how he would be losing out. He spoke condescendingly when we wanted clarification on the bill and when we asked for a complimentary birthday cake that was promised to us at the beginning by the maitre d', waiter made it a point to let us know that we already had a great deal and they don't usually give cakes. Pretty ridiculous from a restaurant at a W hotel. Not very classy. A neighboring table was using the same deal and also seemed to be complaining. All customers should be treated the same.

The couple with us also got similar items except they tried the scallops and said they were tasty. \nOther than water, the only drink between the 4 of us: my wife had a glass of Riesling ($12). \nThe travelzoo coupons together were $138 worth, and then the wine $12 brought the bill to $150. When the bill came though, there was a $48 \"Service Charge\", plus tax. I don't begrudge paying the tax outside the coupon, but come on. The service charge is basically a forced 35% tip. So we ended up having to pay $76, which as students, is not ideal. \nMy biggest problem is that a tip is supposed to be based on service.

LOL, probably not true, however, it seems like every week and weekend, someone new is in town and ready for dinner. Last night was no different. An old colleague of mine came to town on business and wanted to have some dinner. We settled for the W because of the great reputation of the hotel. \n\nThis place is dramatic! Vaulted ceilings and bunched up white lace hung from the ceiling down to the floor. It looked like the Tree of Life on Avatar. I felt like I needed to chant. Lots of white tables and chairs and decor made this place fancy. The service was no different. She was calm, collected and gave a lot of suggestions for drinks and food. Heads up, if you check into Yelp and order two entree plates, you'll receive a coupon for a  share plate for free. Great deal! Here's what I had for dinner:\n\n-My cocktail was the Metropolitan for $15. Michter's Rye Whiskey, muddled raspberries, pink grapefruit, fresh lime, basil and peychaud's bitters. This was a great drink! The whiskey was masked with a refreshing combination of citrus and herbs. I loved it! Highly recommend!\n\n-Our share plate was the Crispy Fried Quail for $16 (free with coupon). 3 pieces of quail on a bed of sour cherry reduction, topped with nicoise olive leaves, shaved celery and hazelnut. The quail was fantastic! Nicely breaded and fried, the cherry sauce wasn't too sour, really complimented the dish  well. Loved the refreshing texture you got from the celery as well. \n\n-For dinner, our server suggested the Winter Dungeness Crab meal, a new dish to the menu, for $30. Crab meat mixed with root  vegetables matignon, shaved black truffle on top, meyer lemon, parsley over a bed of creamy white polenta. For starters, I didn't taste polenta. There were some here and there, but for the most part it was a soup on the bottom. Not a lot of crab meat. It seemed that way because they shred it all over the plate, however, you got a lot more parsnips, carrots and brussel sprouts. It was just OK. I do like that they incorporated butter into the dish for the sake of the crab. Points for that. \n\nWhat a beautiful restaurant. Minus some minor details, I really liked it!

There are some open area tables as well as \"booths\" screened off a bit (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trace-san-francisco?select=XmS7vbY3Qp3I4oKrJPhhjA#UwC1B9kmdsgWMAnu7O1d8A) which is where we were seated.\n\nWhat better way to start a spa day than with a Bloody Mary (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trace-san-francisco?select=XmS7vbY3Qp3I4oKrJPhhjA#XmS7vbY3Qp3I4oKrJPhhjA), though the g/f would say a Mimosa the better choice.\n\nShe started with the Market Fruit Salad (vanilla and honey straus yogurt http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trace-san-francisco?select=XmS7vbY3Qp3I4oKrJPhhjA#Gb7WosLJ5CvKJsf4eEUb5Q) which had banana, orange, apple, watermelon, pineapple, pears, and grapes. Pretty basic, it was a big plate with everything nice and ripe.\n\nI went with the Sliced Yellowtail (green goddess, cucumber, radish, toasted almonds\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trace-san-francisco?select=XmS7vbY3Qp3I4oKrJPhhjA#8f8B3AXJ8aLTG0Tzq_xCFA). In addition to the listed ingredients there were strawberries, kumquats, and some watercress. Fresh and clean flavors. The fish was better than many sushi bars I've been to. The almonds were a great component adding crunch and flavor.\n\nFor the mains, the g/f got the Fregola Sarda \"Risotto\" (slow poached egg, fall mushrooms, herb salad, aged balsamic http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trace-san-francisco?select=XmS7vbY3Qp3I4oKrJPhhjA#KvHYyjsiMg7rfNTEDEAxxA). Fregola Sarda is an Italian pasta reminiscent of Israeli couscous. The egg was nicely poached and the \"risotto\" got a thumbs up.\n\nI had the Grilled Albacore Tuna Salad (arugula, shaved fennel, quinoa, mixed beans, green goddess http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/trace-san-francisco?select=XmS7vbY3Qp3I4oKrJPhhjA#tb_Z2G3sC7sD93tt94sSCg). Nicely seared tuna. This had a little too much going on with the green goddess on the plate plus a different dressing on the salad.\n\nPretty good as part of the package we got, but next time I'd go for the a la carte brunch menu, though with the hotel restaurant prices, that might not be soon.", "author": "Andrew C."}

We came in last Saturday night for dinner and were seated within 15 minutes after arriving. The restaurant manager and team were all very friendly, professional and courteous. \n\nThe W San Francisco outpost hired architect Stanley Saitowitz to redesign the W's two levels (including the lobby, restaurant and two bars) and to really give it a more local San Francisco personality and feel.  His design inspiration comes from a line in Ambrose Bierce's poem \"This city is a point upon a map of fog.\" The dark gray and purple color scheme gets lighter and cloudier as you head towards the top level and you can catch traces of many San Francisco monuments on the walls. Saitowitz steers away from commonplace themes of SF (the Golden Gate Bridge, cable cars) and really captures the mysterious and edgy side of SF. The sleek and simple white vinyl-cushioned dining room (with white banquettes, vinyl placemats and sleek touches) really embodies the W brand. \n\nWe were both very pleased with the seasonally-minded, many-layered dishes. The cuisine really mirrors the fresh, clean, stylish and sophisticated W brand. We both savored the Roasted Lamb Meatballs, a very bold-flavored starter plate featuring fresh Mediterrean ingredients like seasoned lamb, olives and mint. I had the Pan-seared Alaskan Halibut with summer beans, roasted garlic and onions and a sweet-savory grape mustarda sauce. Beautiful summer flavors with a perfectly cooked filet. \n\nMy friend had the Flat Iron Steak with maitake mushrooms, grilled spring onions, salt roasted potatoes finished with a porcini glaze. I cannot vouch for the flavor of the steak because my friend did not offer me any. Bad friend, bad friend! Jk I can say  one thing: he left no trace (pun intended). Musta been good! \n\nThe Trace menu includes both large plates (wild king salmon, roasted duck breast, pork tenderloin, crispy chicken and more) and small plates (lamb meatballs, seared Monterey squid, sliced yellowtail, chicken liver mousse, Pacific oysters, roasted pork belly & fontina flatbread) and some high-brow cocktails and wine.\n\nCome in and experience this sexy and cutting-edge hotel and restaurant in SOMA.", "author": "Nicole D."}

They paired the scallops with a subtly spicy lamb sausage - an interesting choice - and the inclusion of baby carrots, zucchini, and peppers was lovely.  The flavors were on point, and everything went well with a Riesling.\n\nMy only critique was that the restaurant was a bit loud, and the sound system seemed to be directly wired to an oldies station.  At times conversation could be difficult, but that's my only complaint. \n\nAll and all, a great pick. I would pay another visit soon.", "author": "Sydney K."}

I've  walked by Trace before and have always wanted to give it a try. The restaurant itself reminds me of LA, very trendy with a seductive jewel-tone color palette. I'm obsessed with the terrarium light fixtures and the white fringe outlining the restaurant, adding privacy to the over-sized centric booths. I came here on a Thursday and was shocked at how quiet the W was. Trace was even more desolate with just two or three other tables occupied. I'm not complaining; scenes are wonderful to be part of, but there's a unique level of intimacy that comes from having a restaurant almost all to yourself. The service was superior. Roger is the real gem of Trace; he's attentive, personable, and knowledgeable on the menu. I can't speak highly of him enough. I was pleasantly surprised to see they offered Cakebread by the glass. I ordered a glass of sauvignon blanc and salmon rillette to start. The salmon rillette makes for a decent appetizer; it was good but not great. The whole grain mustard that comes with the rillette is what gives the dish edge. For the main course, I ordered the scallops, and that's what took Trace from a competitive three star to a four-star restaurant. If you're going to try any dish at Trace, make it the scallops. The scallops are generous in proportion and come in a sweet sauce with small shavings of apples as garnish. My boyfriend had the chicken. We were both excited to see how it paired with the bread pudding and brussel sprouts. Much like the salmon rillette, it was nice but didn't stand out. Overall Trace is a beautiful restaurant that offers unique dishes with interesting spins.", "author": "Leann W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-07-12", "description": "Ultra chic, ultra modern, but a pretty average/ below average brunch experience. \n\nI came here with my roommate after purchasing the Gilt City deal and was wholly disappointed with the experience. \n\nFirst up was the mimosa that came with the Gilt \"Energize Breakfast.\" It was terrible. How do you serve up a bad mimosa? Maybe it was the juice they used, but it definitely was a strange clash between oddly sour and unpleasantly bitter.\n\nSecond was the coffee. \nMy first cup was sour. Usually, if it's my first cup of coffee for the day I down it before it even gets a chance to hit the taste buds. This cup was so bad though, that I had to ask them to bring me a second cup.  I felt like \"that annoying customer\" doing it, but how do you even make sour coffee? (It wasn't the milk) Second time around, the coffee was better, but at $4 a cup, you'd think they would get it right the first time.\n\nThen came the fresh squeezed juices. I ordered the kale, celery, parsley, etc. juice and my roommate order the chai \"juice\". Both were pretty good. As a raging Pressed Juicery fan, I would equate the Chai to one of the almond milks and the kale one to one of Pressed Juicery's green drinks.  To be honest though, Pressed Juicery is a LOT better in terms of taste.\n\nThen came the meals- my roommate ordered the vegetarian hash and I ordered the proscuitto benedict. This is where I was most impressed. The hash was average, yet still managed to convinced me that if I were a vegetarian and all dishes tasted like TRACE's vegetarian hash, that I wouldn't die.  The benedict was especially worthwhile.  The egg was poached perfectly and complimented by a wonderful hollandaise sauce that was tinged with the perfect amount of citrus flavor. The home fries were clear winners here- perfectly seasoned, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't come back here again, but if you do find yourself in this establishment, I would go ahead and skip straight to the meals and pass on the mimosas, juices, etc. They aren't worth your while.", "author": "Patricia K."}

Back then, I was closer to a 'P' than a 'W'... OK, maybe an 'S' but surely not a 'W'. A lot of years have passed and a lot of rings have grown around my trunk, so I must surely be past 'W' by now. Sparked by a couple of positive reviewers by Yelpers I could trust, I decided to give it a try with a longtime friend of mine, but now it's been redone into Trace. Trace? Like \"he left the crime scene without a...\"? Gee, that's so hip I don't get it.\n\nWhat I do get is that they use all the right buzzwords on their website - \"socially responsible\", \"sustainable\", and the ever-popular \"locally sourced\". And the entrees are described as \"Farmed\", \"Crafted\", or \"Shared\". So San Francisco. Michael Bauer was none too impressed with the food he had there last month according to his Chronicle review, chiding its \"uncomfortable surroundings\" and uneven execution. My friend and I didn't have the same experience as we pretty much liked the place. Sure, the decor felt like an West Elm catalog spread, but the food was quite good and creatively prepared.\n\nAs a working mother of two and wife of a burgeoning car-wash magnate, my friend Liz deserved the pleasures to be had with the $15 Anson Mills Farro Verde, which was a delicately delicious mix of melty farro, cavolo nero, delicata squash, crispy ginger bits, and best of all, Brussel sprouts. Mine was the \"Crafted\" selection - the $13 Braised Niman Ranch Pork Shoulder, which was a nice meat-falling-off-the-bone delight piled on some pan-crisped gnocchi and accompanied by hen-of-the-wood mushrooms and pecorino cheese (see photo). Even Bauer liked it, and I would definitely order that again.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...liked the creations despite the pretensions\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...like I said, West Elm...dark chocolate woods, blinding white chairs\nSERVICE - 3 stars...attentive enough\nTOTAL - 4 stars...guess I have to be farmed and shared next time since I was crafted this time", "author": "Ed U."}

As time moved on it was no longer a destination, and i think the management has recognized that.\n\nSleeker, darker and more contemporary, Trace has undergone a transformation in it's aesthetics, food and bar program. The space certainly looks more club-lounge like. Stark white tables with patterened mercury colored matts, large black perforated dividers with sheer mercury curtains allow them to break up the space. There's a very long communal table in the back with a matching long bar on the second floor with various lounge booths.\n\nAfter being promptly seated by the attractive hostesses, we perused the drink menus. Now most (if not all) the W's in Manhattan are designed by one Randy Gerber (Mr Cindy Crawford) and his rep and the fact that it's NYC causes cocktail prices to be at a certain level. The fact we're in the W here also carries some rep and at $14 a pop theyre not the cheapest. However my Bourbon based Mr Robinson was excellent and well worth the price. It was a good start. After perusing the menu, we saw that they are following the farm to table ethos that most of SF is championing and that's good to see from a national hotel chain. We ended up with:\n\n-BRAISED PORK SHOULDER\ncrisp gnocchi, pecorino\n-CHICKEN \"OYSTER\" TORTELLINI\nroast chicken broth, pickled cherry peppers\n-PAN ROASTED DUCK BREAST\nsavoy spinach, pine nuts, wine grapes, black barley, quinoa\n-BAKED CALIFORNIA SEABAKED SEA BASS\nfresh shelling beans, cippolinis, broccoli spigarello, fennel sausage\n-PANNA COTTA\nthyme, apples, tuille\n-PEACH CRUMBLE\nwhite wine sauce\n\nNow i like XYZ's food when it debuted, but it wasn't widely memorable. I'm liking the fact that they're letting the chef do his food and it's definitely an upgrade. Everything was tasting with solid flavor profile combinations. I'd say my only complaint was the duck breast was over on temperature. The staff were quite attentive. Roger our server was in tune with us, our waters were never below half full and we were certainly well taken care of. They were smart to open on a holiday weekend and when we arrived there were a handful of folks. but by 9.30 the place was mostly full for a Monday night. Go figure. They maybe hammered when the next weekend rolls around, but if they can keep this level up, it will be definitely worth returning for both food and drink. 4.25 stars.", "author": "Kim N."}

The restaurant doesn't validate, so just be aware of that when you go.  However, parking aside, which I would guess could be difficult in a rush, it is WELL worth the visit.  This is one of the best restaurants I have been to.  The food was phenomenal.  \n\nIt started out with fried brussel spouts with pecans, an heirloom tomato salad, which was fantastic.  I had chicken, which was beautifully prepared and delicous.   My companion had the duck, which was also wonderful (I tried some).  I ordered a glass of wine and didn't think to get the strawberry basil lemonade like my friend did.  Boy, as soon as I tried that, I wanted a glass of it as well.  \n\nThe wine was high quality, but don't dis the non-alcoholic fare.  Well worth the money.  \n\nDon't pass this one up, go to it if you have the chance, they are amazing.", "author": "Heidi F."}

The music was great! There were 5 of us and we had a very good time but the fun was more due the company than the venue itself. \n\nThe drinks and food were at 90s prices* but the prices are high and drinks less than average that it does not feel like deal at all. Side note, the burger is $19... which is the same price on their normal bar menu. The previous night, I went to a happy hour and got a very good cocktail for $8 and at Trace I got a subpar $8 cocktail. Pretty disappointing. *Hotels do charge more than the average bar so yes, the prices are discounted but the quality should be much higher.\n\nTo my surprise, the service was actually very very good. Very attentive waiters came to our lounge area so we didn't have go to the bar.

I have basic taste and I know what I like.  So when the hostess placed this small one page menu in front of me I thought \"Crap! We're gonna have to find another place to eat.\" Well, I was wrong.  Most of the menu consisted of seafood, which I don't eat but I did spy the fried Brussels sprouts with sweet and sour mustard seeds and pecans.  Ok. I also noticed the roasted beet salad. Ok.  Nothing else on the menu appealed to me in the least bit. So fried Brussels sprouts and beet salad it was.  \n\nThe food was DELICIOUS!!! The honey used on the beet salad is produced by the hives located on the roof of the hotel and maintained by a couple of the restaurant staff.  I thought that was very cool. \n\nI will say the service was very slow but our waiter was nice and made up for the delays with a free dessert.

There was no offer to take it off the bill.\n\n2) I ordered a side of bacon to my french toast/pancakes.  My friend ordered a side of fruit with her eggs benedict.  We got neither.  Oh, and we got charged, so we had to send the bill back.\n\n3) My husband's granola with fruit ended up coming with what appeared to be a single sliced up banana and apple.  Seriously?  He had seen another patron's granola the day before, heaping with strawberries and grapefruit.  Seriously?  What a disappointment that a meal can differ so much in quality from day to day.\n\nAll in all, the food was just OK and the service a little lacking.  Everyone was perfectly nice, but I really just expected more from a restaurant of the W.  (I do want to note that our experience at the HOTEL was awesome, so this review definitely only applies to TRACE).", "author": "Vicki C."}

The wooden menu holders are supposed to underscore the homey mantra of \"farmed, foraged, crafted, and shared,\" but in reality they are just incongruous elements in the stark dining room.\n\nUnimaginative, the menu does not feature anything diners in The City have not already seen.  Pickled beet salad was good, but nothing new.  Sweet and tender, seared scallops on a bed of celery root puree was not innovative either.\n\nThe overpowering scent of lilies wafting halfway across the dining room made it hard to appreciate the food and wine, and salt and pepper were conspicuously missing from the table.  Service was ham-handed at best:  the waiter carried water and wine glasses in his hand, not on a tray; dishes arrived at an irregular pace, and used plates were not cleared immediately.\n\nDespite a few bargains (for example, 2009 Justin Cabernet Sauvignon for $60), the wine list is over-priced, listing a Veuve Clicquot (orange label) for $120.  While low on value, the list is high on diversity, featuring at least 15 wines by glass with four on tap.  \n\nThe food at Trace was good, but not great, leaving the dining room nearly empty at 7:00 on a Saturday night.  With the myriad of great choices available in The City, Trace is a good option if you are an out-of-towner staying in the hotel, but not if you live in San Francisco.", "author": "CJ G."}

Honestly, I had an overall good experience but I just didn't get that special wow factor. The ambiance is perfect --- trendy and hip the way I like it. Depending on where you sit you can be isolated from the world or you can enjoy people watching if you sit near at the window. The lighting give me the feeling of upscale-ish dining in an underground party like environment.\n\nTheir service was great. Typical service you would get at a high end type restaurant. You ask for a knife and you get a knife brought to you on a silver platter. My water was just about refilled after every two sips.\n\nI ordered the pan roasted duck breast. Great presentation. I was hoping it was going to taste so good that I would quack but it was just mediocre.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-09", "description": "I have to say I'm very surprised at Trace's low average at the time of this review. I suspect that it's due in large part to the fact that the highly anticipated restaurant in the W opened during one of the craziest times of the year for this neighborhood - a huge Oracle convention thing that took over the streets for a week. I'm confident that based on their excellent waitstaff service alone that soon the average will creep up. \n\nAs for my own personal experience, I very much enjoyed myself at a lunch with my coworkers a couple of weeks ago. I made a reservation earlier but the place was pretty empty when we walked in at 12:30 on a Monday... I was surprised, especially after so many people griping about how long they'd had to wait in the past! The hostess was lovely but no one compared to our waitress (kicking myself for not remember her name), who was charming, funny, helpful and efficient all the way. She alone gets five stars!\n\nAs for the food, there were hits and misses I'd say. We used our handy dandy Yelp check-ins to get two free shared dishes, which were the charcuterie board and a pork belly flatbread pizza, both of which were incredible! I think these were definitely the high points of the meal. For my entree, I got the pork belly BLT which was just fine (the pork belly was heavenly), but I wasn't too impressed with the potato chip side or the bread that was used. My dining companions weren't huge fans of the rabbit club or ahi tuna either... neither were terrible but just maybe not too special.\n\nHowever, I highly recommend saving room for dessert. Our lovely waitress was nice enough to send over two complimentary desserts for our group and I practically had to ask my coworkers to restrain me to my chair so that I wouldn't lunge for all of this light almond panna cotta they sent out. \n\nOne major tip: turn down the AC! We were all shivering like crazy eating our meals, even though it was sunny and fairly mild outside. I had to order a cup of hot tea just to be able to get through the meal! It didn't help that the ambiance of the place is pretty sterile and cold too, with lots of sharp lines and white furniture.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-14", "description": "Being that Trace is just a hop, skip, and jump from my workplace... it was only a matter of time until I had an opportunity to pop in and nibble on the nosh at the latest iteration of the former XYZ space within the W Hotel. And upon dipping my fork into many 'a bites from Executive Chef Paul Piscopo's farm-to-table eats, I gotta say... I'm pretty fond of what they're doing. \n\nThis is no knock on the former tenant, but for me, the W used to stand for cutting edge style, fashion, and culture. Whether you were at one of their properties in San Diego, Chicago, or San Francisco, you knew that if you were eating, sleeping, or flirting at one of their outposts, it was one of the hottest hangs in town. But for some reason (complacency, perhaps?), the W seemed to fall behind the rest of the pack when it came to forward thinking concepts... but that's all changed with the turnover project of Trace.\n\nTo run with the theme of the W's former cutting edge spirit, they're back to their old ways with one of the first locally-sourced, farm-to-table operations in any hotel I can recall. When was the last time you visited a hotel and encountered meats from grass-fed animals that were procured from within 90 miles of the front door? Greens hailing from a farm just a quick 45 minute drive away? Dishes featuring Bellwether Farms Carmody cheese, so close, you can almost hit it with a rock? Often times when you're eating at a hotel, you're stuck ingesting horrible factory-farmed products and Cisco processed franken-food. Bravo to the brass at W for jumping aboard the trendy, yet much-needed and appreciated slow food movement that many other visionaries around San Francisco have been practicing as of late. \n\nDoting aside... how does all this backyard fare play out? Well, let me recall some of the flavorful items that found their way ol' Ruggeford H. Joesten's eagerly-awaiting palate.\n\n+ The spiced eggplant with grilled scallion, coriander and crispy rice: a fantastic little starter with all the smokiness you'd expect from a pureed nightshade like this. \n\n+ Brentwood corn soup with spiced popcorn, cotija cheese, and cilantro cream: it's the tail end of corn season, but this little bugger still packed quite the punch. Served cold, it's a must try if you're fortunate enough to catch it before it goes away until 2012.\n\n+ The heirloom tomato \"PBLT\" with grilled pork belly, romaine, aioli, whole wheat, and of course, bacon: Well, it had both pork belly AND bacon. It shouldn't take too much convincing to let you know it was divine, porky gluttony. \n\n+ The grilled flatbread with  figs, caramelized onions, pork belly, arugula: again, our pal pork belly makes another appearance, and this dish is perfect for sharing as a starter. Not too heavy despite the fatty hunks of swine scattered throughout, and the figs help to offset the salty nature of the rest of the ingredients.\n\nYes... there's even more food!\n\n+ Prosciutto and Fig grilled cheese sandwich featuring Valley Ford cheddar cheese, whole grain mustard, and crispy sourdough: with the gourmet grilled cheese crazy seeing no end in sight, the stand right in there with some of the bigger names you'd come to expect from the high-end comfort food game. \n\n+ And finally, for dessert... quite possibly one of my favorite sweet indulgences I've had in some kind. I can't recall the name of this one, but it featured a peanut butter waffle (yes, a peanut butter waffle!) with housemade Concord grape jelly, chocolate chips, and a dollop of cr\u00e8me fraiche on top. Holy cow -- it was like eating the greatest peanut butter and jelly sandwich of my life! Seriously, this might be one of the greatest dessert items in all of San Francisco.\n\nSo, as you can see... I'm fairly pleased with my first romp with Trace. I see some of these neg reviews from folks who waited a couple extra minutes during one of the busiest times of year in SOMA (Oracle World), and it's a shame, as it's a tad unfair to judge a place at the height of the pandemonium that Larry Ellison brings to downtown. Hopefully they'll have an opportunity to swing by on a less intense evening.", "author": "Ruggy J."}

However, I think the concept could be followed through more.\n\nWe had a pasta dish with short rib. I expected the pasta to be made in-house but it wasn't. I asked our server and he told us it's not fresh pasta. It's imported from Italy. What happened to locally sourced?\n\nAlso, I had a blood orange cocktail called the bloody sunrise. It was garnished with a wedge of regular orange not blood orange. Where is the blood orange? Apparently, they don't use fresh fruits in their cocktails. It was a blood orange liqueur. At a place where they pride on their locally sourced ingredients, I expected market fresh fruit cocktails especially at $13 a pop. An option of non-alcoholic fresh fruit house made sodas/drinks would be nice as well.\n\nI was with 3 other people so I was able to sample of variety of dishes. Food was great but not mind blowing. The food here reminds me of the food from Prospect. \n\nThe stand out dishes of the night were the braise pork gnocchi app, squid app and the chicken entree.\n\nOne of the desserts we had was the panna cotta and it was tiny. I could have eaten the whole thing in one big bite. Not kidding. Especially compared to the two other desserts we had (red velvet cake and chocolate bar, they were good not great). The size of the other desserts were normal. Not sure what they were thinking when they made the panna cotta.\n\nThe food prices were on point (~$23 per entree) but cocktails were way overpriced. At $13 a glass it was more than what most of their appetizers cost (~$10 each). However, I do like the fact that soda refills are complimentary.\n\nService was fine. We liked our quirky server but he disappeared for long periods of time in between courses.\n\nThe space is modern and loud. One of my friends said the space reminded him of a Virgin America plane. White wall, table and chairs, purple and pink lighting, trance music... he was right on.  The second floor is a bar/lounge area with a DJ blasting music.

The butternut squash risotto was quite good - hearty, nutty, and slightly reminiscent of mac 'n cheese.  It was just a tad bit saltier than I would've liked, but then again, I tend to like things to be blander so that could just be a personal preference thing.  The hangar steak was well-cooked, but also a bit salty.  I enjoyed it but felt like it was nothing to write home about.  The bed of kale that it sat on was good but again, not mind-blowing.  The steak also came with a side of fries.  The chocolate carre was pretty awesome, but I was pretty full by the end of the meal so didn't finish the entire thing.  I'm not sure if it was a mousse or something else, but whatever it was, it was yummy!  It also came with some ice cream (salted caramel, mayhaps?) and some crumbles of something, which I really enjoyed!\n\nMy boyfriend had the seared scallops and pasta entree; I tried a bite of the scallops and it tasted well-cooked.  The one strand of pasta I tried seemed really greasy.  Also tried his bread pudding, which I thought was quite good.\n\nService: \nService was quite good, as expected from a trendy place like this.  Instead of giving you a basket of bread, they come by with a basket, and ask you what you want, and then put a slice of bread on your bread plate.

Generally, attentive, good service.\n\nAtmosphere:\nSo, when it comes to nicer restaurants, I prefer warmer and more intimate settings, maybe with some dim, yellow-ish, soft lighting.  This was the exact opposite, and I did not like that.  Most of the furniture is white, the place has a trendy feel, and the entire room felt kind of cold and sterile.  Also, it was quite empty, so that certainly didn't help.  I think the cold atmosphere is a big reason why I can't see myself coming back here.

I'm not a small rodent who might nibble.  I like to EAT. Anyways - for a $22 salad, I was offended by the small size of it.\n\nAs I was eating it I noticed that the wasabi dressing was smeared on the bottom of my plate and it took me eating almost my entire salad to notice.

I heard the bar is great, so I'll have to try that some time. Great service, too, as expected for a restaurant inside a fancy hotel, the W.", "author": "Vera W."}

Also, the management followed up with me after my last review to assure me that the next time I came it, the burger would be up to my expectations. And, I have to say, the burgers have been great since then. The only missing star is because I miss the brioche bun, the aioli we used to get, and the fingerling potatoes.

Overall their dishes aren't too greasy or heavy so they have that nice healthy aspect to them. No fresh squeezed juices although the waitress claimed they were freshly pasteurized and still tasted good...whatever that means. \n\nHighlights were the steak and eggs and poached eggs. The steak was flavorful and cut into easy to eat pieces. As for poached eggs, they were atop prosciutto and the pair worked well. All the dishes had yummy yukon gold potatoes that were crispy and savory.\n\nMisses were the omelette. The eggs were overcooked and the fillings were pretty scant and meager. Tasted like styrofoam with hints of egg. The blood mary pizza was basically a raw pizza but the bread was stiff and the crushed tomatoes just tasted like something from the can. \n\nOur waitress was a major bitch, though.

Yellowtail sashimi (topped with so many complementary toppings, I can't name them all) was top notch. Pumpkin raviolis were rich and melty.

I even stood up to go to the bar to pick it up myself. She finally came by for us to tell her that we were still waiting for it.) \n\nShe took our order, didn't say a single word. The food took a while to come and a food runner brought it over, our starter came first, the Chicken Liver Mousse. We had no plates, server no where to be found, I had to flag down someone else to get us plates. \n\nWaited longer for our entrees to come, our server finally brought it out and just left it on the table, didn't ask us if we needed anything else, just plopped it down and left. She did not once come by to check in on us during our meal. She walked by plenty of times, didn't give a shit. \n\nMind you, there are two other tables next to us. One 3 white businessmen, they seemed satisfied with her service, she was much nicer to them, she checked in, she chatted. Another table that was sat after we had already begun our starter, 2 white men, 1 white woman, the server was speaking to them, laughing with them, making sure they were getting great service. Brought out the wine for them to try immediately, their first dish came out within 10 minutes of sitting down. \n\nAt first, I was telling myself, \"ok, maybe she's having a bad day\" but after seeing how she serviced and interacted with the other two tables, made me think that maybe she though \"oh no, a young asian couple, they're probably going to do DAT and not tip well, so I won't bother\".\n\nHey, guess what ma'am, we may be younger than the other business people dining in the restaurant, but I am no way a cheap tipper nor will I give you any trouble, I just want to be treated with respect like everyone else. I want the same goddamn dining experience everyone else is having. \n\nAnd you know what, even after the shitty service you gave us, I still gave you a decent tip. \n\nYes, my angry rant isn't just a rant, I let the manager know. I pulled the race card, I tried to be empathetic in case she was having a bad day, but honestly, she ruined what was supposed to be a nice lunch out. And the manager's response: \"will you be coming back to dine with us? I apologize, I promise next time will be better\" Yea ok, sure, not like you care or will do anything about it. \n\nYou want to know how the food was, it was ok. You can dine anywhere else in the city and get the same quality if not better for the same price. So if I had a choice to pick between Trace or another restaurant, I would pick the latter. \n\nThank you for an amazing experience.", "author": "Anh P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-11-11", "description": "I had breakfast at Trace for the first time today. I must say I was disappointed. To start with I had requested a window table on Open Table and the hostess mentioned that when we checked in but stated they were very busy that morning and everyone wanted window tables. Maybe so, but everyone didn't have reservations. They had plenty of table available and rarely fill up for breakfast so I think the fact that I had a reservation should have resulted in their saving a table for me by the window. \n\nAs for the food itself, I ordered the Trace which was eggs, toast, bacon, and potatoes. My wife had an omelette with mushrooms and gruyere cheese and peppers. I had expected the Trace would be similar to the Plow at Plow and it looked the same on paper but that was it. The eggs were fine but the bacon was thin and dry with no taste of applewood. Not that it claimed to be applewood but I expect that for a $15 plate. The toast was uninspiring and served overcooked AND cold. Not sure how you accomplish that. My wife ordered a decaf coffee and I ordered a regular coffee and we were served from the same pot so I had to call the waiter on it. He apologized and brought another pot of regular for me. I must say the coffee was delicious though. The omelette was also uninspiring and the potatoes were pretty but land  \n\nI've eaten at W in SF when the restaurant was called XYZ and I much preferred the food and interior.

The food was pretty good, the soup could have been hotter, the salad could have been bigger but other than that no complaints.  \n\nTrace is the renovated restaurant that used to be XYZ.  They have opted for more of a casual feel from what was more I believe a sophisticated, classy feel.  The vibe is still the same, it's still very much like a W Hotel which means it has the club like atmosphere.

When I inquired why we would have to wait to be seated in a virtually empty restaurant, this person so very condescendingly informed me she was short-staffed. I said no problem, please just seat us and we'll wait. This person refused to do so, and again being horrifically rude said we could wait at the bar, which was closed. So we waited.

My friend had the ox tail soup and said it was hot and tasty.  I had the pear and beet salad and that was really good. We had their signature chicken Fulton Sandwich,  The chicken was breast only and was really moist and delicious it came with jalapenos , I told them to hold the Aioli, don't like Aioli. Once served the service was sort of slow.  Didn't have a lot of options on the menu. Saturday is Brunch so mostly breakfast, eggs, waffles, etc. If you have a hankering for Saturday breakfast  this would be the place to go. Otherwise i probably won't go back.

After being seated for breakfast, it took a long time for my server to greet me.  I ordered the omelet, which was pretty tasty, however that is about all the good I have to say about this place.  The service was horrible.  I was not served any water for a good 10-15 minutes, actually my coffee beat the water to the table.  As for the coffee, it was never refilled nor was the water.  (5.50 for one cup of coffee is ridiculous) I finished my meal not having anything to drink throughout it.  My server even approached my table and didn't fill either of my drinks.  \n\nOn top of the horrible service, my meal was 27 dollars after tip.  I suggest walking another block down the road and going to the Grove for breakfast.  At least there you are not paying for full service and don't expect it.  Even though the food is good, it's not worth the money due to the service.  Throughout my meal I watched a number of tables experiencing this same disappointment.  Either they need a couple more severs per shift or they need to let the one I had go.  He completely ruined my overpriced breakfast.  Needless to say I will not be back.", "author": "Andrew S."}

They also had a finger foods buffet with some exciting options outlined below:\n\n- Yellowtail with green goddess, pickled cucumber and toasted almond - OH. MY. GOD. I think I selfishly had like 3 of these. They were melt-in-your-mouth delicious.\n- Heirloom Pumpkin Agnolotti with brown butter and TRACE rooftop honey. Paired with Push Back Sauv Blanc - If I could have selfishly had a bunch of these, I would have, but they ran out. The ravioli was made in house and quite stellar. I'll definitely make it back to Trace just for this dish. Additionally, I really enjoyed the Sauv Blanc that they served with it. I'll have to check them out next time I'm in Napa.\n- Crispy Berkshire Pork Belly with beluga lentils and broccoli rabe\n- Braised Lamb Shoulder with potato gnocchi\n- HAPA SF's Lumpia with sweet & sour chili\n- Bacon Bacon's Mini Cobb with triple b's, avocado, Pt. Reyes blue, bacon jam vinaigrette\n- Taco Guys Squash Taco with crema and toasted ginger - LURVED this.\n- Brass Knuckle's Pork with gangnam pork bun bite - Highly reviewed/enjoyed by other yelpers.\n\n- Creme Fraiche Panna Cotta wtih satsuma tangerine\n- Nitrogen Ice Cream Bar with honey ice cream - the honey is made on their rooftop.

I had a delicious poached pear salad and my friend had an oxtail soup she said was great.

Located at the W Hotel in the heart of SOMA, it's truly a great place to enjoy some city atmosphere. I had made a reservation, and when we arrived we were greeted by a friendly hostess who seated us right away. The space is hip, modernly dressed in gray-scale, with wide open space by the big street-facing windows, and sweet little nooks near the bar. \n\nAfter a brief consultation with our friendly server, Nathan, we decided to go with a prix fixe dinner complete with wine pairing. It's hard to go wrong with chef's choice at a fine establishment. Some of the dishes had more subtlety to their pairings, like the yellow tail with green goddess dressing (but oh how the almonds made that dish pop! Brilliant!), but even those had fresh notes that whet my appetite as we dove deeper into the night. The roasted asparagus had a meyer lemon \"relish\" that was incredible. The English pea agnolotti was light, sweet, and creamy (one of my favorite dishes). The Liberty Farm duck breast (skin perfectly rendered) came with an outrageously flavorful and tender sweet potato gnocci. My favorite dish was the pork tenderlion with fennel and spatzel. This tenderloin was perfectly cooked, flavorful and melt in my mouth. The spatzel was the best I've ever had. The pairing of the three sang beautiful melodies in my mouth. All of the wine pairings suggested by our server were also spot on. Though we took our time eating, when the dessert came several hours later, we were still so full that we weren't sure we could bite into anything else. Of course, when chocolate stout \"pot de creme\" bar is placed right under my nose, there's no way I can resist just a lick. Well, that was enough to entice me to take a few bites. Smooth, super chocolatey, with a little of that stout bitterness - delightful. \n\nI found the servers to be friendly, well-informed, and extremely attentive. The food was definitely a hit, and the wine took the whole experience over the top. I highly recommend giving yourself over to the chef's choice and enjoying the ride.", "author": "Shannon F."}

I tried about half a dozen things, and I have to say, the food was pretty good. The standouts for me were the braised pork shoulder (with crisp gnocchi, mushrooms, and pecorino) which was positively delicious, and the heirloom pumpkin ravioli. Both were nicely balanced in terms of flavor and had a lovely mix of textures. I particularly loved the crunchy element on the ravioli.  I also really liked the cocktails. My favorite was a tequila concoction called El Diablo that was made with Tequila and some house made habanero syrup. It was a gorgeous drink to look at (florescent white floating on a bed of deep rose) and had a subtle kick. I didn't really care for the desserts (I had the panna cotta - great texture but odd yogurt-like flavor flavor), but that was a minor thing. The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is like being in a dance club minus the heavy bass (mood lighting, Day-Glo light accents, nice looking but slightly uncomfortable furniture). I've been before for cocktails and liked it (pricey though they are at $15 a pop), but now I think I may work a dinner outing or two in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-03-07", "description": "There I was, deep undercover in the cesspool of corrupt swindlers, precarious lies, and shocking lack of charisma known as the Game Developer's Conference (GDC) in San Francisco. While I can't remember how I ended up there with the alias of Pip Tiddlywinks, mutton-chopped philanthropist and avant-garde board game designer, I do recall that we suspected our next lead in the Case of the Missing Papaya Diamond to be present. But where? Ay, there's the rub. \nI found myself nursing an Afternoon Delight in Trace, a swanky restaurant part of the W Hotel, and cleaning Bangers, my trusty magnifying glass. It's not that peculiar of a name, really: Upon discovering a clue I tend to exclaim \"Bangers!\" rather loudly, so it practically named itself.\nThe atmosphere in Trace resembled that of a bloated Virgin Airlines cabin mid-flight, aesthetics and loud, non-descript noise included. I was finishing off the drink when the bird walked in, graceful, elegant, and dressed to tighten my trousers. Yes, she was the lead in our case. I still remember her beautiful smile, flowing strands of golden hair, lips only reserved for angels, hypnotizing eyes, and that the duck item on the menu was accompanied by pickled quince. What the bloody hell is quince? We ordered our respective meals without mentioning a word to each other. Once the waiter chap was off to the kitchen, the game was afoot.  After a brief silence, she started to speak in a voice that would enchant even the most chivalrous of gentlemen: \"Detective Honeybutter. I need your help.\" It was at this point that the chap placed my plate before me and I stopped listening. \nThe wild fennel pollen fettuccine with braised lamb shank was rather exquisite. While I feel that the portion was appropriate for a five course meal, there were no other courses included. Here's a tip when ordering this dish then: Claim the bread basket and dip those spoils of war in the lamb concoction. It lengthens the culinary experience without sacrificing the charm of the dish. During the meal, the waiter chap kept asking if we were done when I was not. Not by any stretch of the imagination.  Upon the fourth attempt to steal my plate, I was ready to engage in award-winning fisticuffs and made it clear: \"Just because I'm British doesn't mean I want to go colonize your bloody kitchen with my dirty plates, my good sir!\". He backed down after that, as well he should have. \nBut it was the dessert that sealed Trace's fate. I ordered the Panna Cotta on recommendation from the now-emasculated waiter, but let me describe, in essence, what I was served: Imagine that a tiny glob of whipped cream from a larger, more dominant dessert fell off and the chef was so ashamed he tried to hide it under a small, single tangerine slice.

We found this in Trace.  LOVE that is is open late for dinner and the whole vibe inside the W Hotel is sexy, loud, fun.  Our server Roger was amazing - attentive, great with recos, personable.  The food was fantastic, I love that you can get a few smaller plates to share and try a variety if you'd like.  Can't go wrong with the meatballs.  We stayed after dinner to hang out in the bar.  Overall, it was a fantastic date night and we'll definitely come back.  I will warn that we are late-20's and like louder, funkier places for dinner.  I would not suggest this for someone who is looking for a traditional romantic dinner.", "author": "Amy D."}

We stayed at the W as we have on other occasions. We wanted to get some breakfast before we headed back down to Sunnyvale. There is not a lot of food choices in this part of SF, so we decided to just eat at the hotel restaurant, Trace. What a complete waste of time and money. We were seated right away in the cramped and uncomfortably close dinning room. The problems started almost as soon as we sat down. The hostess asked what we wanted to drink. My wife asked for orange juice and wanted a coffee with cream and a tomato juice. She returned about 5 minutes later with the orange juice and the coffee. No creamer and not my tomato juice. I waited, thinking they would be coming any second now. Nope. I had to flag down a bus boy and ask for cream. I never did get my juice. I would say we sat there, waiting to have someone take our order for at least 15 minutes. The only reason we did get to finally order is because the waitress came to give the bill to the table behind us. It was only they she saw us there, menus in hand, waiting. She acted surprised to see us there. We ordered and waited again, this time for 20 minutes. Finally the food came. I had the Chilaquiles and my wife ordered the breakfast sandwich which had a diced ham gravy. When the food came, both dishes were stone cold. Her breakfast potatoes looked like they had been dipped in batter and then deep fried. Very unappetizing.  My wife took 1 bite of the gravy covered sandwich and said, that's it, I'm not eating this. The waitress never did come back, even to bring us the bill. I had to ask another waiter as he was passing to bring me the check. All this for a mere $47 dollars. Needless to say, we will not be dinning at the Trace any time soon.", "author": "Chad H."}

Had breakfast on day 2 and it was good, but pretty pricey for eggs and bacon. Service was friendly and helpful.\n\nNow for round 2 we came back for dinner the next night. Atmosphere is very cool and hip here (it IS the W) and we were seated promptly. The popcorn soup was really tasty. Unfortunately that's about the only good part for this night. We ordered a bottle of wine but our server recommended something \"better\" that would be around $80 a bottle. I figured, what the heck it's SF. After pouring our glasses, he mentioned that he had made a mistake on the price and it's a little bit more...$140 to be exact. Well, the dude was smart to pour the bottle first, since it's not like we can pour it back. He apologized and said to take it out of his tip (dude sure thought we were a generous bunch to tip him $60...).  Now onto the rest of the meal, it doesn't get any better. All 3 of us in the party ordered the Rib Eye medium rare...they all came out well done. We sent 2 back (one guy doesn't know steaks) and they came back pretty rare, but at least they knew to take the steak off sooner than before. $38 a ribeye too. They comped us dessert and coffee for the steak mishap, but our server definitely didn't tell anyone he screwed us big time on the wine. I won't be back but that's ok, live and learn. I guess it helps to throw a fit if you're that kind of person.", "author": "Mark H."}

Hence, since we are in San Francisco so infrequently, we try to make sure we make something special of our evenings there.  We had a Travelzoo coupon for the prix fixe dinner for two at Trace.  I can't say enough about the entire experience.  First of all, each course came with a choice of three adult beverages.  The night we were there, one could choose from an exquisite lemongrass drop, a very good pinot noir, and a whiskey-based liqueur with walnut liqueur and bitters named a Mr. Robinson.  I had one of each and each hit the spot.  Not only were the choices on the prix fixe menu good, they allowed reasonable substitutions from the regular menu.  I started with a beet and goat cheese plate accompanied by tasty flat bread.  I'm not a foodie, so i can't describe each element in the dish, but both my wife and I were wowed.  My wife started with a pumpkin  soup that was totally satisfying.  I then had the slow-cooked Berkshire pork loin. My wife had the roasted chicken breast.  I usually like a dark or fruity sauce on pork. While the pork loin came with a light sauce that would have left a less than perfectly cooked pork loin flavorless, that was not the case here.  The subtle seasoning  was perfect, particularly with the earthy pinot noir and the lentils were delicious.  It is always dangerous to order chicken breast because it can be either bland or dry.  Again, this was not the case.  My wife loved the chicken breast, it was juicy and the kale and pistachio aigre doux complimented the chicken, adding just the right touch.  For dessert we both had the chocolate creme bar.  It was the perfect ending to the meal,, I'm not much of a dark liquor person, but the Mr. Robinson went quite well with the dessert.\n\nApart from the food, the experience was perfect, the place feels at once hip SOMA, romantic and comfortable, the service and attention received from the staff was magnificent, my wife and i had the sort of experience that reminded us of how lucky we are to live so close to such a great city.  We will definitely go back to Trace, knowing that any dinner there will feel like a special occasion.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-12-22", "description": "This review is going to be absolutely scathing, and I am sorry for that. Mostly I am sorry for the chef  (Paul Piscopo) who is clearly very talented as well the wait staff who are quite attentive and capable. \n\nThis restaurant has absolutely NO business being open.  I feel misled and cheated out of $280 and I hope whoever owns this place either a) starts to take reviews like this to heart, b) closes up so the chef and staff can go work somewhere worthy of their skills OR c)  advertises what the restaurant really is and does not pretend to be something that it is not in order to lure in more upscale patrons like us. I wish I could file a claim for false advertising and get my money back! Maybe the general manager will read this review and take note.   \n\nI frequented xyz  (the restaurant in this same location) many times in the past before attending an event at SF MOMA or Yerba Buena Center; and I always had a nice experience and assumed by it's location (as well as it's very misleading website) that the ambience at Trace would be similar with it's farm fresh food, warm and welcoming photos on it's website about visits to organic farms, and a \"thoughtful culinary atmosphere\" (a direct quote from their website). WRONG!  \n\nOMG, the four of us walked in to the restaurant and were immediately hit with the loudest and the most obnoxious canned techno music I have ever heard. I like to dance and move my booty as much as the next person; but this music was just dreadful, and I felt like I was in the middle of a very bad dream that I really wanted to wake up from.  The restaurant is right next to a very loud and very crowded bar. and there is NO soundproofing at all - no  doorway to separate the two, no rugs, no drapes, no fabrics, nothing at all.  The restaurant is just one big 23rd century fantasy of what 'might' be cool if the Star Trek Enterprise opened a restaurant. It was just a caricature of itself and all the furnishing were cold, un welcoming and completely non functional. My husband is an Architect and it took him and one of our friends all of 10 minutes to assess the situation and to come up with some solutions. So my assumption is that the owners also knew what could be done to fix the situation and chose their own grandiose ideas with clearly no regard for the restaurant patrons. But back to the music: the techno music was thumping on our ears the ENTIRE time with a beat that brings to mind water dripping/nails on a chalkboard; and at such decibels that you want to run screaming from the room.  \n\nSo naturally my first reaction was to order a bottle of wine to dull the pain, and here was shock #2.  I was offended any restaurant in SF would offer such a poor selection of wines with these absurd prices. I believe the lowest price bottle of wine was $60, most of them were between $70 and $90 (some were $300 and $400) and almost none of these wines were even remotely qualified to be selling at those prices. I have eaten in many fine restaurants with extensive and very high quality wine lists that offer way more diversity in price and choice than this list.  Frankly, the wine experience just felt exploitative, and I think the owner (or whomever makes these decisions) should be called out as clearly they are just trying to make a buck at our expense.\n\nWhen I walked around the restaurant to see if any other tables were even remotely quieter (they were not) it was sad to see other patrons having the same experience as we were and talking to their waiters asking for the music to please stop. Make it stop!  Unfortunately nothing could or would be done. So I am writing this review for the half dozen other tables I saw with equally unpleasant experiences. \n\nAnd if I had to do it all over again I would have left the restaurant;  and in our limited time before the ballet, walked down the street to find somewhere, anywhere else to eat. \n\nAnd again sincere apologies to the chef, who as I mentioned at the top of this review, is clearly very good and the poor wait staff who must have to take a valium before coming to work just to get through the experience. They all get an \"A\" for effort.", "author": "Kristine H."}

I liked it but I didn't love it mainly because the tartare was served room temperature. I also had lunch there a few times and ordered the veggie burger which was absolutely amazing! Very huge...the kind of burger you need to cut in half or you need large hands to hold. The veggie patty was very thick and juicy. It was served with a pickle slice, and shoe string fries. I was stuffed after eating only half. I thought it was pretty expensive but not much different than other casual places in the area. Hell!
