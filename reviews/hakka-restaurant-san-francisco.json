Ordered the potstickers and Mongolian Beef (piks attached). The potstickers were totally underwhelming and I would certainly not order them again, but the Mongolian Beef was terrific, I've had so many poor versions over the years in so many places, I forgot what it tastes like when it's done well. And the portion was very large, plenty of good size pieces of beef. Definitely recommend it... \n\n4 stars is fair, or maybe 3 1/2 due to the potstickers, but it's definitely on my recommend list, regardless... :)", "author": "Steve M."}

There's an upstairs so it's actually pretty spacious. One thing to note. The service kind of sucks. They got our order wrong, gave us catfish when we wanted sea bass. They also forgot one of our orders. They proceeded they were super sorry, and they would fix the bill.....by charging us for the price of the catfish instead of the sea bass....that was it. I was very disappointed by that\n\nFor a party of 5 we got the Typhoon Shelter Clams with Spicy Salt and Black Bean Sauce, half baked chicken, house special pan fried tofu, chinese bacon with preserved veggies, kong xin cai, and catfish.\n\nThe clams. They were my favorite. They were a little breaded and fried. They reminded me of the crabs at PPQ where it's a bit salty, has a lot of garlic, and was clearly fried. I actually really enjoyed the flavor in it and really wished there was more to share (there is actually a decent amount).\n\nThe baked chicken reminded me a lot of peking duck in the sense that they clearly rubbed 5 spice powder inside the chicken, let it bake and then the dipping sauce is just all the fat + spices dripped down. The chicken was quite juicy though. Nothing wrong with it, definitely not as light as the steamed chicken.\n\nThe pork belly with preserved veggies. It was pretty tasty. The pork was very soft and fatty. Feel like it's hard to mess up pork belly and they didn't mess it up. It's exactly how you imagine the dish to be. It is a little salty and so I would recommend eating it with rice. \n\nThe catfish was pretty good too. Very sizable portion and they give you the whole fish (head, body, tail, everything). It was pretty oily so it's not the most healthy thing, but it was also very tender.\n\nThe kong xin cai was standard. Goes well with the salty dishes. They clearly added something else as the sauce was a bit more yellow than I'm used to.\n\nFood was good, not too expensive (25 a person). The service was very disappointing in how they handled mistakes.", "author": "Victor D."}

It was a $35 item! (We found it later under another name, different from the Chinese description.) \n\nThe second time, we waited 30 minutes outside for a take out order, when they told us it would only be 15 minutes. Mind you, they were carrying a conversation amongst themselves as I was trying to order. \n\nThe final straw was when I ordered with Eat24 for pick up, and the prices were inaccurate (prices had gone up but apparently not reflected on Eat24 menu) and they pointed it out to me and expected me to pay the difference. If I would've had their physical menu handy at the time, I would've noticed it.  But for me to order $40+ worth of food, walk to pick it up and then to have them argue with me about it.  Unacceptable. \n\nWe haven't eaten there in a few months because I don't feel like supporting their business when there are 3 other nearby Chinese restaurants with comparable food (and better in some instances) and I don't have to deal with such rudeness.\n\nI grew up in the Chinese restaurant business and understand how much work goes into it and treating your customers like they're bothering you is definitely not the smart way to go about doing business.", "author": "Fannie S."}

This means large tables for 6 or more, large dishes, and lazy susans.\n\nI came here with 2 other people after a stroll at land's end and was starving. We sat upstairs at a corner table (the only non-round table up there) and received a delicious lotus beef soup while waiting. Among the three of us, we shared a lamb dish, a white chicken and veggies dish, green beans and minced pork, and the sticky rice in lotus wrap. Everything tasted pretty good but I was not blown away. We had a hella leftovers (about 4 meals worth for one person).\n\n-lamb dish & chicken dish:  lamb tasted just like beef (probably was beef) and came with veggies that were mostly identical to the white chicken and veggies dish. I had hoped for different veggies between the two since the picture seemed to suggest that. However, both were well-cooked (crunchy veggies, tender meats) with a variety of ingredients. \n\n-sticky rice: was not sticky and had a lot of really greasy peanuts (small pieces of everything else) but the flavor of the leaf was well infused (subtle) which added to the somewhat dry rice. Not bad. I wouldn't order this again since everything came with rice so the sticky rice was a little unecessary. \n\n-green beans: really good--preserved veggies and minced pork flavors were on point ( a little salty) but I enjoyed it. \n\nI'm only giving it 3 stars because the veggie/meat dishes were both too sauced up which left me really dehydrated. While the texture was bomb, the flavors didn't come through enough in these two dishes. The other ones were decent but not amazing. \n\nBasically great serving sizes, lots of well-cooked food with OK flavors, and come with a large group!", "author": "Lydia Z."}

Many of the people who eat here are likely, I figure, to live nearby and aren't likely to put up with bad food.  A quick glance at the photos on the windows registered another plus on my quality meter: tasty looking beauty shots of the food, but better were the quaint misspelled words that indicate to me the place isn't all that twisted by our anglo culture.  Hang onto your Asian heritage as long as you can, folks.  In my book it's more often good than not, that you find \"salter pepper prawns\" or \"x and y with bran curb\" on the menu.

The hainan chicken was decent, though hardly any meat on the bones at all.  Same with the crab with garlic glass noodles.

You take the sticky rice and pan fry it so that the edges are all crispy and brown. You then fashion and decorate the entire dish to look like a whole fried chicken, except when you cut into it, it's actually \"no mai gai\". Soo good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-08-25", "description": "After stuffing my face at the restaurant, I'm sad to say my overall impression was one of \"meh\". First of all, almost everything at the restaurant is very heavy on the salt, that just kills it for me because it overwhelms all over flavors. I think if they didn't employ the \"when it rains, it pours\" method with the NaCl, I would have enjoyed the food a lot more.\n\nWe shared the pork belly with preserved veggies, the hakka tofu, the crab, the clams, the bean sprouts, the house steam chicken and the lotus wrapped rice.\n\nMy favorite, surprisingly, was the pork belly. The meat were perfectly tender and didn't taste fatty, and it wasn't too salty. If anything, I would expect that dish to be heavier on the salt (due to the preserved veggies), but the sweetness of the preserved winter vegetable balanced out the dish.\n\nThe hakka tofu was disappointing. This is the quintessential Hakka dish and it was just run of the mill stuffed tofu. There was nothing special about it, just salty meat stuffed tofu with some salty nondescript sauce. Booo!\n\nThe house steam chicken was tender, well, let me rephrase, the dark meat portion of the chicken was very tender and flavorful, although continuing with the theme through out, salty. The breast meat pieces tasted over cooked like your average chicken. Pass!\n\nThe lotus wrapped rice was deceiving... the leave was for presentation only. I could not taste a hint of the lotus leaf flavor in the rice. The rice was also pretty one note, the only thing in there were the rice and Chinese sausage, no mushrooms or dried shrimp. The sparse sprinkling of scallions did add some flavor, but it needs a lot more scallions to make up for the one-note flavor of the dish. \n\nThe crab was salty and the crab is small. I guess it's not crab season, but I just had the crab at R&G Lounge a few weeks ago and I swear the crab there is 50% larger than the one tonight. It had good flavor, although too much salt. They did a good job of cracking all the shells, though, to make it easier to eat. would be nice if they give us some utensils to help us dig out the meat and some wet toilets to get the fishy taste off our fingers. Would be a nice dish during the crab season.\n\nThe clam was probably the saltiest dish of the day. It had a thin batter and is fried. I've never had clam cooked like that before. Like the crab, the flavors are there, but it needs less salt. I'm neutral on this one.\n\nLastly, we also got the pea sprout. I really enjoyed it. The seasoning level was right and it tasted fresh. Just garlic and the pea sprouts, something lighter to go with the other artery blockers that we ordered.\n\nAll in all, I don't think I'll come back here. I can't believe it has a 4 star rating!! Generally in a neighborhood as competitive as the Richmond, a 4 star rating means something. I usually don't like a lot of salt in my food, but the other people at my table agreed that the food was too salty, too. I think if there was less salt, I would give it 3-3.5 stars.

Now I'm not Hakka but I am Malaysian and being that I've spent quite some time there, there are quite a bit of Hakka descendants in the country and their food is DELICIOUS which brings me to this place.... such a let down...granted we really ordered 2 dishes that were Hakka-specific.\n\nWe made reservations for 7:30pm but still had to wait about a half hour.... Once we finally settled in, we ordered a bunch of dishes: pork belly with preserved mustard greens (hakka dish) and this sticky rice dish (hakka dish and my mom ordered it), lamb & bitter melon clay pot, 2 orders of steamed meat in tofu, walnut shrimp, ginger green onion crab, ginger green onion lobster, sweet n' sour pork, garlic string beans, garlic pea shoots, soup, and chicken with ginger sauce. I think that was all of it.... quite the order but there were at least 10 of us there.\n\nAnyways, the pork belly with preserved mustard greens was sweet... not salty and had a funny taste...definitely not authentic. They have Americanized that dish like most dishes at panda express. The sticky rice was alright.... my mom says it may have been an off-night because it's usually more flavorful and the rice is softer.... The walnut shrimp was by far the worst plate, it was overly dressed with mayonnaise and had a very unpleasant taste, definitely something I would never order again. As for the rest of the dishes, they were decent...basically as expected from any other Chinese restaurant but nothing outstanding.\n\nI'll go here again if it was another obligated family dinner but not something I would go out of the way for... it's literally at the far-end of town in comparison to where I live. Oh and can I mention the parking.... it is all residential and terrible! We circled around for 20+ minutes before we found something.

I believe it was 10 courses with both lobster and crab for less than $200 per table of 10.  Yes please!  We basically took up half of the downstairs with just my family!\n\nThis place is definitely for those who want real Chinese food.  I saw mostly Chinese people while I was there.  One of my friends (who's Caucasian) is a little scared of this place since they post pictures of some of their dishes and they are a little too, I guess I could say, authentic for him.  So come here if you're in the mood for super Chinesey food!\n\nSome of my favs were the Salt Egg Yolk Crab and the Ginger Scallion Lobster.  I have a pet peeve with overcooked seafood and both retained their juicy seafood flavor.  No rubbery shellfish here!\n\nWe unfortunately didn't get the braised pork belly, but we had the lettuce cups, fish, fried rice, etc.  I don't quite remember them all and I didn't take any pix to remind me, but I was super happy and satisfied after the meal.\n\nWe had an early dinner at 5:30pm, so we didn't have to wait for a table.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-17", "description": "Chinese Village Food? LOVE IT!\n\nMy mom grew up in one of the villages in China and introduced me to this type of cuisine early on. Apparently, this type of cuisine has a name, Hakka Cuisine which is what Hakka Restaurant (opened in January 2010) is named after; I learn something new every day. \n\nHakka Cuisine can be attributed to environmental influences. To make up for the huge loss of salt content in their body from farming, Hakka migrants added more salt to food which also preserved the food longer. These qualities meet the nature of the Hakkas. This is why you will find several salt baked and salty egg yolk items on Hakka Restaurant's menu. \n\nBeing the typical non-American born Asian, my mom believes in penny pinching and even a $5 bowl of wonton noodle soup she considers expensive. Needless to say, the only restaurants we went to were Chinese ones that offered $2.99, $3.99, and $4.99 main entree dishes (it's no wonder I now have severe allergies to MSG). Some of the Hakka-type dishes at these restaurants were not very authentic to say the least so Hakka Restaurant was a real treat for me. \n\nOn Sunday, 11.13.11, my friend and I came to Hakka for dinner at 6:30 PM with reservations. It's very busy and chaotic on weekends, so RESERVATIONS ARE A MUST!\n\nF O O D\nHakka is NOT a place to order sweet & sour pork, kung pao chicken, or chow mein (not sure if they even have that on the menu). Please save that for PF Chang's or Panda Express. \n\nTheir most popular dishes are the lettuce cups with squab, salty egg yolk pumpkin strips, salty egg yolk crab, salt baked chicken, pork belly with preserved mustard greens, and house special pan fried tofu. You can request NO MSG be made with you food (YAY!). Since it was just my friend and I, we ordered the following: \n\n*HOT & SOUR SOUP (6.95) - 4 STARS\nWarm and comforting, the hot & soup had an assertive sourness but wasn't overwhelming. The heat was just enough to awaken our tastebuds and leave a subtle heat on our palate. Bits of wooden ear fungus and tofu gave the soup some texture.\n\n*SALTY EGG YOLK LOBSTER ($25.95) - 4 STARS \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pknqZiaDbSNFUnJrOpkKcw?select=SjRBhrPYxhYA0QEtRPGwzA\nThey didn't have crab available that night so we went for the lobster instead. An unlikely combination, the fried salty egg yolk crust adds a crispy texture contrast to the tenderly moist lobster. Together, the egg yolk and lobster married together creating a mouth-watering salty and sweet flavor.\n\n*BRAISED PORK BELLY w/ Preserved Mustard Greens ($12.95) - 4.5 STARS \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pknqZiaDbSNFUnJrOpkKcw?select=o4ly8CJ04DTJtE3xeRNdMQ\nThe thick slices of pork belly were perfectly braised to a soft, melt-in-your-mouth butteryness. The sweet soy braising liquid imparted a lip-smacking savoryness with a hint of sweetness into the intensely rich pork. The mild sourness of the preserved mustard greens nicely cut through the richness of the pork belly.\n\n*BEAN SPROUTS w/Garlic ($8.95) - 3.5 STARS \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pknqZiaDbSNFUnJrOpkKcw?select=Ur8Cfx0CC7_iRyoZ34eKfA\nSimilar in appearance to spinach, the bean sprouts had a crisper texture and a milder flavor. The slices of garlic added a nice essence but were a little bland as we requested all our dishes to be made without MSG.\n\nS E R V I C E\nFast and inattentive which is very typical of most Chinese restaurants. They were VERY busy so you had to wave your hand in the air if you wanted something. Hakka is a place where you come for the food and the food only so don't expect good customer service.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nLOUD AND CHAOTIC! Being part Chinese even I was in a bit of a culture shock when I walked into Hakka. People were shoving each other and anxiously awaiting their table. If you're unfortunate enough to be sitting at the tables near the entrance, expect people lingering and looking over into your table. There are two levels with mostly large round tables for family dinners. \n\nP A R K I N G\nStreet parking is VERY difficult to find since Hakka is located in a residential neighborhood. Do give yourself an extra 10-15 minutes to look for parking. \n\nNext time, I'm coming with a village of people so we can go on a Hakka rampage!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Alice L and I showed up late with reservations one night, having let them know we were running about 30 minutes late - to which they had no complaints, surprisingly.\n\nWhen we finally arrived outside, we were slightly taken aback by how quiet the area was, and semi-jokingly wondered what sketchy middle-of-nowhere restaurant we'd decided on. Stepping foot inside the restaurant though, we were surprised by how busy and bustling it actually was inside - while there were no lines, almost every table was still occupied at 830pm.\n\nScouring over a fairly extensive menu, we eventually decided on the pumpkin chips, fish filets with XO sauce, and clay pot oxtail. The pumpkin chips weren't bad: simple, tasty, interesting/different when served up with the salted egg, and more enjoyable with each bite; the fish filets weren't bad either, but were also not amazing; while the oxtail, unfortunately, was just okay. We were also served a tasty complimentary pork and kale soup to start, and an okay, but also complimentary, pumpkin tapioca for dessert.\n\nThe total ended up around $32 after tax, with enough leftovers to last one or two people - and this was after having stuffed two to their limits, so, the food here is certainly affordable and of good value. Perhaps not worth trekking out here for often, but if you're in the area, or craving Chinese food that's a little different, Hakka is a safe bet.", "author": "Johnny W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-20", "description": "A quick search will discover that Hakka cuisine concentrates on the texture of food, and its skill lies in being able to bring out the flavor of meat without hardening it. Although uncertain if this is one of Hakka restaurant's tenets, its flavor focus is certainly differentiable from typical Chinese cuisine in the city.\n\nThe Sticky Rice wrapped in lotus leaf is my personal favorite at Hakka. Despite not being inherently unique, the rice's densely packed flavor and teeming, finely-chopped fillings would be arduous to replicate at home. The giant lotus leaf may be used to seal in flavor or may be purely decorative, but definitely adds to the fun factor either way.\n\nThe Dry Black Bean Clams are infused with millions of tiny, potent fried garlic bits that somehow do not obstruct the taste of the actual clam flesh but impede any essence of the black bean from settling in. When eaten atop the stick rice, rebellious garlic will jump overboard, creating the delightfully remixed Garlic Sticky Rice. This is what some dreams are made of.\n\nThe Half Baked Chicken is surprisingly well-executed. Usually, any order of a large amount of chicken results in neglected, dry pieces, but Hakka's version is devoid of such atrocities. The chicken pales in flavor when compared to other dishes though.\n\nThe Salt and Pepper Spareribs are juicy and neatly battered, resisting the ravages of sogginess that typically sets in when the oil cools down.\n\nThis is a small sampling of Hakka's diverse menu, but as far as Chinese restaurants go, its flavors are far from boring.", "author": "Andrew M."}

A few standouts are the braised pork with preserved veggies (best I have had in the Bay), and the fried tofu and zucchini dish! The fried tofu had substance and didn't feel greasy or unfresh. Their salt baked chicken was pretty good! It was soft and the skin had a slight crisp to it. The dipping sauce was a bit grainy, probably due to spices. I wanted to try the fried pumpkin, but they don't have half orders and the order is huge, so maybe when I bring more people next time I will order it.\n\nThe pork stomach dish was whatever. Wasn't really a fan. The beef dish was whatever as well - the beef was marinated way too soft that it seemed very fake. The 4 person set menu was a pretty good deal, so even if one or two dishes were whatever, it was still worth it. Portions are pretty big so plenty of leftovers!", "author": "Annie K."}

Oh, man was it good!\n\nThe salt-baked chicken is really tasty and juicy. It's a dish where you just want to keep eating until you are sucking meat off the bones. The pan fried stuffed tofu was delicious, when you bit into the stuffed meat, a burst of salt hits your taste buds, which is enhances by the flavor of the sauce on top of it. The sauce was so tasty that I was mixing it in with my bowl of rice. The egg yoked, pumpkin crab was really good, I just wish it wasn't such a chore to get to the sweet meat of the crab. The fried eggplant was good too and I'm not normally a fan of eggplant.\n\nAll in all, it was a great dining experience, eating, drinking and being with good friends who were also trying Hakka for the first time.

Well, the Hakka are a subset of Han Chinese who long ago migrated from Northern China to the mountainous regions of Guangdong and Fujian provinces, and in more recent times spread across the world to places such as Southeast Asia, India, South America, and the Caribbean.  Despite the assimilation into diaspora, they've held onto their language and culture.  Nope, didn't consult Wikipedia for this: I'm proudly half Hakka and thus super excited to -finally- have a restaurant in SF serving my peoples' food!\n\nBrought my mom in for lunch one Saturday, and the three of us ordered the set menu for $38 along with an extra dish and a couple of substitutions, wanting to try most of the authentic Hakka dishes.  \n\nSparse decor, but the food is cheap with large portions- we had enough leftovers for another full meal. Service was awesome- our waiter happened to be landlord of the restaurant and was incredibly enthusiastic and also helpful with recommendations and descriptions.\n\nMust try classics: pork belly over preserved veggies, salt-baked chicken (if getting the set dinner, can choose this for $4 more), the salted egg battered kabocha squash \"fries\" (next time def. trying this with crab!).\n\nAll was incredible and best of all, my mom loved it too.  Definitely brought back lots of food memories of all the good things we ate in the Hakka villages a couple years ago, and even some of the amazing food my great auntie cooks up whenever I'm in Singapore.  Even the plain old Chinese soup and pumpkin tapioca dessert were so flavorful. \n\nHopefully someday they'll add to the menu my absolute favorite Hakka dish:  http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Suan_Pan_Zi.jpg\n\nUntil then, go with the fried kabocha strips.

We arrived at 5:40pm and was seated immediately, which is surprising since the restaurant fills up pretty quickly. Anyways let's talk about the food. \n     We started off with a complimentary soup of potato and chicken. It was subpar- typical soup you would expect from an Asian restaurant. \n      Fungus saut\u00e9ed vegetables- Omgawd I cannot express how much I live this dish! Def. absolute fave! The dish was colorful and crisp and it was really refreshing. I know a lot of people might not be used to the black fungus, but it honestly just absorbs the flavor of the dish and offer a nice crunch. In fact, it's my fave part of the dish. The veggies were also really fresh and crisp. \n       Spicy ground pork with string beans- This dish was actually something we never ordered before and it was pleasantly surprising. We all fell in love with it instantly! The ground pork was stir fried with diced jalape\u00f1os and fermented veggies and the strings beans were fried to crisp perfection. It was spicy, salty, and crunchy and meaty all at once. \n        Yellow skin chicken- This is a cold dish and it's half of a chicken served with a side of ginger and scallion dipping sauce. Typically, when we order this dish at other restaurants the chicken is dry and disgusting. However, here the chicken is tender and very flavorful. \n        House special pan fried tofu- This dish was also something we never ordered before but we decided to try it out anyway. First off, this dish was a complete disappointment. It lacked color, texture, and flavor! Hell, it didn't even look appetizing! The tofu was bland and there was barely and meat stuffing inside. The sauce that it was smothered in had no flavor besides saltiness. Def. would not order this again!\n        Sweet and sour spareribs- This dish was presently beautifully. The chunks of fried spareribs was slathered in a bright red sauce and the bell peppers and pickled radish added a nice zing. It was delicious however, there was barely any meat on it since the chunks were mostly bones! I think next time we'll stick to the regular sweet and sour pork. Nonetheless, my sister killed the whole plate since she's obsessed with anything sweet and sour. \n        Eggyolk crusted fried pumpkin- This is def. the staple dish that we order every single time. It would be a crime if you didn't!!! It honestly looks like a plate of gold and it smells and tastes like heaven! Thick slices of Korean pumpkin is fried and encrusted in salted egg yolk. It comes out piping hot, but that doesn't stop us from devouring it!! Once you bite through the crunchy salty exterior, you are then greeted with a warm sweet velvety interior. \n       The \"dessert\" or orange slices are to avoided at all cost!! They're black and dry and absolutely disgusting! I'm not even sure if they're edible! We just left them at the table!", "author": "Celina C."}

There's almost no other shops or restaurants around (it's on Cabrillo for crying out loud!). It's practically in the ocean. Yet, as you draw close, you start hearing the muffled chatter and forceful intonations of impatient Chinese people. As you draw even closer, you see a crowd around the entrance to this place, peering in through windows, pouring out through the door. Aggressive gaggles of Asian grandmas and their families fighting for the attention of the servers, hovering over seated guests hoping to get a table sooner.\n\nThis is how you know this place is good.\n\nWe had been recommended this place and so expected it to be decent. But MAN, this place blew away all my expectations. So, I normally don't ever choose to eat at Chinese restaurants. It's not snobbery, it's not cultural trauma. It's simply that I don't really like the cuisine as much as others. Sauces tend to be too heavy, things all start to taste the same.\n\nBut this place! I can really get behind this place. Every dish we ordered was spot-on delicious, and not the usual dishes you can find everywhere else. The pumpkin with salted egg is ridiculous, the texture firm, but slightly cakey, the flavors rich and not too overpowering. The Chinese bacon is stellar as well, not too greasy and the perfect blend of salty and sweet. I would also recommend the clay pot ox tail and leaf-wrapped sticky rice! Each dish's flavor was unique, and pair really well with rice. The highlight of the night, though, was definitely the fried crab with salted egg. Absolutely amazing!!! The salted egg almost gives the crab a cheesy richness and the lightly crispy fried exterior just took it to the next level. Unreal.\n\nDefinitely call ahead so you don't get caught up in the mob of hungry people outside. It'll still take a little courage to worm your way through to actually check in, but it's worth it.

Asian Pearl dim sum should be ashamed of charging so much for a lesser rendition. This stuff is killer.\n\n- Not Hakkanese but good ol' fashion Cantonese claypots. Braised fish (rock cod?) fillet/belly with tofu and a rustic lamb brisket claypot that will surely be wonderful during cold nights.\n\n- Those feeling seafood adventurous might want to try \"frog fried with salted egg yolk\" or \"stewed bitter melon with catfish claypot\"\n\n- Squab/pigeon lovers who want to experiment beyond the deep fried salted version could try the stewed one in claypot (with dried orange peel and ginger flavors)\n\n-Love innards and pork stomach?

They have that here too, but probably done in a much better scale and more authentic Cantonese. But you might do better getting the sweet and sour spareribs, more authentic Cantonese version, known as \"sahng tsau gwut\", which they execute beautifully here (aka pineapple spareribs\", less fattening than the SSP. Ordering this with some beers will give you that Hong Kong dai pai dong feel...\n\nThe best dish of my evening?\n\nHome style steamed sea bass, a 1.5 pound black bass that was a bit under $30. It looks Hakka Fugly if you know what I mean, but it tastes like heaven. \"Ga Heung Seung Mei Dzing Mahng Tsoe\" or Countryside home double flavor steamed black bass....the double flavor is the pickled sweet veg and black bean sauce (dau see). The fish is pan fried first, then steamed. Then garnished with magic sauce and cilantro. It was one of the phattiest black basses I've had in a while. Sweet, a hint of sour, and good fish flavor and texture. Despite being pan fried initially then steamed, this was one of the best preps I've had in a long time. Asian Pearl's \"country style auntie's steamed fish\" is no match against this one. A very appetizing, almost transporting back to the old dayz when life was poorer and simpler.\n\nComplementary house slow fire soup (2nd visit yet again was the delectable lotus root with pork bones) with the final encore of the performance being the pumpkin dessert soup (likely made with kabocha/Asian pumpkin), but w/o sago. I know what I want for Thanksgiving instead.\n\nA complete symphony of a meal, no pretense, no bullshit.

The crab was market price of $45, a bit pricey, but it was a whole crab and we all got our fill. The crab was also wok fried with bits of chilies, scallions, and ground pork for extra flavor. Dinner also includes a house soup, which was lotus and carrots, and very much like my mom's! This is a great little place in the middle of the neighborhood, which means it's also kind of hard to find parking.", "author": "Rita L."}

I have only gone for the lunch time meal and so far my 5 trips to this spot is right on. Enjoyed every dish so far and portions are just right from the lunch menu. The quality is quiet well considering the other Chinese restaurants not to far from here. Not greasy, not to salty and the sauces are not the \"over saturated with salt \" kind. This food won't get you all sleepy after a meal like typical Chinese food restaurants do due to the amount of MSGs that the other places have. My suggestion is the 3 plate lunch special at 24.99. Considering it started at 21.99 4 months ago but then again, in SF the wages went up and so the prices at home restaurants like this one had to hike up the prices a bit. No problem, keep the food good and I'll keep coming...service is average, great serving of warm soup before your dish comes out is a nice treat. It does get a bit busy during the lunch hour and parking is sometimes a drag since its smack in the middle of a residential neighborhood. But all in all a good spot to take a affordable and filling lunch, without feeing the after lunch \"hangover\".", "author": "Jaime P."}

The food was decent (we had salted egg friend pumpkin strips, chinese bacon with greens, chinese broccoli in rice wine sauce, house stuffed tofu, and sticky rice in lotus leaf), but not spectacular. The pumpkin and some of the other dishes were pretty salty, and the waitress was extremely stingy with the beverages--having run out of tea and asked twice for water, she finally brought one glass for the person who requested it.

He's so very knowledgeable about what to order. We've been coming in here for a few years now and always order some of the same dishes on a regular basis. Here's what we've tried, including our favorites:\n\n-The strings beans in XO sauce, to DIE for, especially the Chinese pickle and minced pork. It's full of flavor and my #1 favorite wont go here without ordering dish!\n\n-The stuffed tofu dish which is popular\n\n-The Fish and tofu clay pot, again, very good!\n\n-The Pumpkin strips-their fried in egg and would be a favorite also if they weren't overly salty tasting. Otherwise, try asking for it without the salty layer.\n\n-The soup of the day which is always free is also very good-my favorite being the winter melon.\n\n-The chicken and salty fish fried rice-another favorite that we like to order along with the Strings beans.\n\n-The mussels with the black bean sauce are delicious and steamed just right. \n\n-Last but not least, they always serve you free dessert after your meal, usually it's a hot dessert such as red bean with tapioka soup, pumpkin tapioka or my favorite the taro with tapioka. I always get seconds and sometimes the Raymond sends an extra container home with me.\n\n-The service is excellent thanks to my two favorite servers there, Danny and Raymond! You guys are the BEST!!! :)\n\nBut whatever you do and especially if you're out here in the outskirts of the city, you MUST try this place.", "author": "Petra S."}

Most of our party of 9 were late, though I had booked reservations ahead of time (thank goodness - and best if you make the reservation in Mandarin, but they do speak English, too)!  They gave us a HUGE table!  \n\nWhile we waited, I perused the menu for the dishes mentioned in the reviews, and pretty much wrote down the \"Coordinate Values\" and the names (which later helped quite a bit, as the staff was SO busy - on a WEDS night! - and I was able to give the paper with the codes of each dish, making our order highly easy to make!  \n\nWe started with the egg yolk pumpkin strips - weirdly delicious!  My 11-year-old daughter said the outside reminded her of Cheetos.  Whatever.  They were a perfect appetizer as the rest of our group came inside.  \n\nWe ordered the Braised Pork Belly, Claypot fish and tofu, Bean sprouts and Garlic, Hong Kong style steak with green and red peppers, Lotus Wrapped Sticky Rice (one of the LARGEST I've ever seen!), Beef Stew Claypot (wonderfully tender beef and tendons!), Hong Kong style Crab (luscious and meaty!), Squid and Chicken with celery, Egg vermicelli, and one more dish that I cannot know remember, but nothing was bad, so it must have been good!  The surprise was the large soup tureen of beef broth filled with large pieces of beef, tendons, carrots, but mostly broth that was simple and delicious, not salty.  \n\nOrange slices topped off our customized Chinese New Year dinner!  We slowly removed ourselves from the restaurant, carrying bags of our minor amounts of leftovers stored in clear plastic covered containers.   \n\nThe best surprise was how inexpensive this feast came out to be!  We averaged $17 / person for a 14-course dinner!\n\nWhat also surprised me was how busy the restaurant was on a mid-week evening!  Parking is street only, and it's easy to find - corner with a bright yellow awning.  Several large tables that can seat up to 14 people each are available, giving the impression that crowds may be the norm for them.  \n\nThe wait staff and hostess were pleasant though running everywhere.  When it calmed down a bit, we were able to chat with them, and that was pleasant in itself!  \n\nI can hardly wait to return again!  WITH a crowd next time!", "author": "jeannie l."}

As this restaurant has mustered good reviews, we decided to give it a shot. Parking is a pain in the neck; we hunted high and low for a parking space for 10min, but in vain. So, I asked my husband to park in a corner with emergency lights on, so that I could buy to-go food for us. \n\nThe menu had several food options which beguiled me into thinking that this is one awesome restaurant. I ordered the salt and pepper tofu/eggplant, short ribs and rice. Our boxes were ready in 15minutes and the food looked so yummy that I could not wait to treat my taste buds with it.\n\nWe drove to the Lands End, parked the car facing the beach and eagerly opened the boxes. The salty tofu/eggplant was good, nothing exceptional. Likewise, the short ribs was commonplace. It was bland.

I know nothing about Hakka cuisine but I know my Chinese food. This place has it down pat. \n\nOur table of eight ordered from the Economy Family Dinner ($19.95 for three huge plates!) which runs for both to-go meals and lunch. Note that you can't order the Economy Family Dinner for...dinner. We ordered twice from the fixed-price menu, and two extra dishes from the lunch-time special. $4.95 for rice places, yum! So literally, this whole meal cost a little over $60. \n\nPros:\nClean venue, kind waitrers/waitresses, insane portions, constantly refilled tea, the starter soup (some tofu-corn concoction)\n**Braised fish fillet and tofu: One of the \"lighter\" dishes; served in a clay pot and almost perfectly executed.\n**Ma pao tofu with minced pork: I love tofu! Spot on. NOT SPICY AT ALL!\n**Salt and pepper spare ribs with string beans: More meat than batter, surprisingly. \n\nMediocre: \n**Black mushroom chicken with veggies: My mom can make this.\n**Beef and broccoli: I can make this.\n**Chinese sausage fried rice: I can DEFINITELY make this.\n\nCons:\nStreet parking\n*Eggplant and tofu with minced beef: Not really a con, but since I was the only one who liked eggplant, I ended up eating most of it and I began hating eggplant... A little overcooked.\n*Village style vermicelli: Way too dry!!!\n\nAN IMPORTANT CHEAP CHINA WOMAN'S TIP:\nA tub of rice is $5, so just order a plate that comes with rice for your group! \n\nSuper cheap, good for groups, and pretty yummy.

We got the egg yolk crab and Id have to say it wad delicious and one of the better crabs Ive eaten. I hate all forms of eggs besides scrambled but it was their signature dish so I had to try it. The egg yolk batter on the outside gave the crab a lot more flavor that complimented the juicy hot crab well.\n\nOther notable dishes included their fish stomach soup and seafood fried rice that were both saturated with cilantro. Being lazy, I didnt want to pick out the cilantro despite my detest for them. To my surprise, the cilantro mixed pretty well and I barely tasted it which actually enhanced the flavor of the dish. For the most part 80% of their dishes have cilantro in them.\n\nThe pork catfish was an interesting combination but it worked well. The catfish was half deep fried and the pork on top lessened the fishy taste in my opinion. They also added sour mustard greens.\n\nThe beef spareribs, seafood vegetable dish, baked chicken, abalone mushroom with mustard greens, and squash sago dessert were good but nothing exciting to report about them.\n\nOverall a very nice chinese restaurant and an upgrade over the usual places I go to.

The first thing we saw was a picture of a pork stomach dish on the wall: a good sign of authenticity.\n\nIt was only my partner and I. So we didn't get to try much from the menu, most of which sounded very appetising to us. We ordered the holy grail of Hakka cuisine--pork belly with preserved vegetable--and a claypot of tofu and fish fillet. Pork belly was served on a bed of lettuce which is very normal but it was rather bland. Dare I say, old? I could tell they didn't make that on the very day, perhaps just steamed to warm it up. Preserved vegetable had some hard bits in it and a slight grittiness in the sauce--and indication that they didn't wash the veg very well. Pork and tofu claypot came with big pieces of fried tofu and fish fillets (that didn't taste fishy) and smothered with brown sauce. I quite enjoyed this actually, especially when it came to our table piping hot.\n\nOverall, the food was a hit or miss but I would love to come back to try their other dishes. Less than enthusiastic service to say the least, with zero smile whatsoever. Then again, it's quite typical in a Chinese restaurant. What bugged me the most is that I had to pay extra for rice. WHO EATS CHINESE FOOD WITHOUT RICE?? Most of these dishes are meant to be eaten with rice, unless you're in a banquet. By not including rice with the entrees, they are taking an important part of the experience from the customers.", "author": "Kwoky L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-10", "description": "Once upon a time, in a neighborhood FAR FAR FAR AWAY, there was a young man and a band of friends who met at a certain place. A place where a Chinese restaurant existed. Okay, it's not that far away, but if you're a native San Franciscan the Outer Outer Richmond darn near seems like a trek through suburbia. I mean this neighborhood should be reserved more for the Zoo or the wave breakers. But nevertheless, this Hakka style restaurant appears out of nowhere among other residential homes.\n\nThe converted two story Richmond home has a large front room with approximately 4-5 large 8-10 person tables. It is not readily noticeable, but there are tables on the second floor that are accessible by a stairway in the back, through the kitchen. These tables are mostly for smaller groups. My group was seated on the second floor after an hour wait. We were constantly thinking of ways to slip the head waitress some money so we could eat sooner.\n\nThe food was good as expected, in terms of Chinese family soul food. The Pork Belly is an essential dish for any meal here, it was so juicy tender and delicious, pinkish to the core still when served. We had an order of Eggplant with Garlic, Dau Miu, Shrimp Walnuts, Fried Pumpkin chunks (?), Clay Pot Tofu, and Sweet and Sour Pork. Top that off with lots of rice. The dishes were large enough to serve 8 people for our group.  \n\nThe reservation system is a bit disorderly, but this is no knock on the service provided by the waitstaff and cooks. There really is no room in the front entrance to respond to waiting customers, and throw on top of that the way most Chinese families are, they will walk right up to the head waitress even if she is in the kitchen and continue to ask how much longer the wait is for their table.\n\nThe most important part of this experience, the whole meal cost  $88 that includes tax and tip. So $11 per person! It was an incredible value. I was stuffed at the end.\n\nA important tip, if you are interested in eating here with a group, MAKE RESERVATIONS! You will be waiting for an hour or hour and a half for a table. There is no place to stand in the restaurant due to the crammed front quarters, so you must stand outside to wait. You can try your luck with K&L (a block up from Hakka), but I guarantee it will be the same type of wait.", "author": "Michael C."}

Obviously, you should try one of their special dishes like salt-baked chicken or the battered pumpkin or frog, but even their char siu chow mein (the thin noodle variety; they have thick, also) blew me away with it's flat-out tastiness and simplicity. The only thing that bored me was the pot stickers, but this isn't a dim sum restaurant so who cares; skip the appetizers and get right down to business.\n\nI went there on Thanksgiving last year, which I recommend because it's one of the few nights of the year these folks aren't crazy-ass busy. Get here early because it can become a bit of a madhouse on a weekend night.", "author": "Casey C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-23", "description": "\"This place is Hakka Good!\" Hakka restaurant is a great alternative to more common Cantonese restaurants. Some signature Hakka dishes here are the salt baked chicken, pickled vegetable with intestines, and my personal favorite, the melt in your mouth pork belly with preserved vegetables. For the most part these dishes reflect the ability to pair sweet and savory while using relatively inexpensive ingredients to create well balanced dishes that Hakka people are known for. \n\nOn the more modern side of things, the salted egg yolk frog & pumpkin dish was also excellent as the frog legs were super moist and the salt yolk texture went perfectly with the sweet/soft pumpkin.  Clams are also excellent here.\n\nGive Hakka a try and venture to dishes you haven't tried before. You won't regret it.\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Byron C."}

I must say, the place is pretty well designed for a Chinese restaurant. I especially enjoyed how they put high quality pictures of the foods on the walls. Also expect a loud environment since most people who eat there are Chinese families or old people so it's natural. Another thing to look out for is if you go there for dinner, it make be packed. So making reservations is necessary, especially if you're going to bring a big party or have a family dinner. \n\nThe waiter who served our table was really friendly and welcoming. His English is really clear because he is ABC just like me. Overall if he serves your table, consider yourself lucky since we all know how Chinese service usually are even if their food is great. \n\nWhat I recommend: \n\n-Fried egg yolk Frog with Fried Pumpkin\n-Pork Belly with preserved veggies\n-Ngiong Tew Foo (Tofu stuffed with meat)\n-Salted Baked Chicken (Pricy though)\n\nThe fried pumpkins do complement the fried frog and the fried outer layer is fried with egg yolk which gives it a nice flavor. The pork belly is fatty but really good to eat once in a while, a lot of different flavors go on in that dish. The tofu stuffed with meat has a nice smooth texture and is glazed with yummy sauce that also compliments the tofu and meat combo. The salted bake chicken has a nice golden brown skin and does taste salty, but not too salty. \n\nThe orders I recommended are Hakka foods, whereas many other things on the menu are the typical American Chinese food or Cantonese. \n\nThe price may not be as cheap as other Chinese restaurants but it's worth trying, especially since there aren't many Hakka people here. So if you are tired of the typical Chinese foods in the Bay Area, Hakka cuisine is totally different if you order the right things.", "author": "Victor Q."}

Try to avoid getting seated upstairs since it's downright depressing up there with just a few tables a banquet area. Food is middling tasty, as in the chicken could have used a little more marinating. It's weird to depend on the dipping sauce to get your chicken up to par. The pork belly here is amazing though, but I guess you have to take into account that it's hard to go wrong with throwing sugar, soy sauce, and fatty fatty meat together along with some bitchin' dried veggies. I could probably eat a whole bucket of rice with the sauce alone. We were feeling the cholesterol that day so we had the pork belly stir-fried with sea cucumber. Strange combo that didn't really quite come together. The latter seemed more there for texture than anything else.\n\nI really like their fish and tofu clay pot though. Fresh slices of fish are battered up and then cooked in broth with scallions, mushrooms, and then all the sauce is soaked up with big chunks of juicy tofu. The sauce again alone is delicious with rice and really rich with garlic, ginger, and a soy tang.\n\nGreat location since it's a block from the beach and you always get the sense that its perched on a cliff by the ocean, sea fog blowin' round.", "author": "Kevin L."}

That left the the day of Christmas pretty much free.  Instead of staying at home and cooking, my folks wanted to head out for dinner with my brother's and my family.  On Christmas Day, most, if not all Chinese restaurants are open for business, so we pretty much expected to go out for Chinese food.\n\nHakka Restaurant is the third restaurant at this location, after Taishan and Happy Immortal.  Though located in a relatively remote location in San Francisco, these restaurants have been very successful as evidenced by the full capacity of the restaurant, and the difficulty of parking in the surrounding areas.  For different reasons, the previous tenants closed, but not for lack of business.\n\nThat evening, I didn't have much luck finding any quick parking.  Took me at least 20 minutes.  Fortunately, most of my family were already seated, and proceeded to order while I tried to find parking.\n\nBy the time I found parking, the food came out a few minutes later.\n\nWe ordered a lot of dishes, and it was a blur towards the end of dinner.  Food came out fast, and unfortunately, I didn't have time to snap any pics.\n\nHere's what I remembered what we ordered (may not be in order):\n\n-Pumpkin Soup:  Fish maw and crab.  Never had this before.  Slightly sweet, yet savory, with an orange tint from the pureed pumpkin.  Nice pieces of fresh, sweet Dungeness crab.\n\n-Fried pumpkin with salted duck egg yolk:  They were like wedge-cut sweet potato fries, nicely contrasted with the salty dried duck egg yolk.\n\n-Baked crab with Salted Duck Egg Yolk:  Battered crab, wok-fried with salted duck eggs.  The crab was hot, sweet, and meaty, and again, nicely contrasted with the duck egg.\n\n-House Special Clams with basil sauce.  Arrived hot off the wok!  Yum.  Perfect with white rice.\n\n-Fried tofu and eggplant:  cube pieces of tofu and eggplant lightly battered and fried.  Tofu was crispy on the outside, but soft in the middle.\n\n-Braised Pork belly with Preserved Veggies:  So good, yet so bad.  Yes, artery-hardening goodness!\n\n-Spicy Eggplant and Minced Pork\n\n-Salt Baked Chicken:  A house specialty.  Chicken was very moist, even the white meat.  Came with a side of plum sauce.\n\n-Chinese Broccoli with XO Sauce: Gotta have some veggies!\n\n-Tofu, minced chicken, and salted fish in clay pot:  Another dish you have to eat with rice.  Love the pungent, saltiness of the fish with the soft tofu.\n\n-Short Ribs with Black pepper and honey sauce:  Quickly cooked in a wok, arrived hot to the table.  Very good.\n\n-Lamb with Dry Bean Curd in clay pot:  Another one of the house specials.  Pieces of lamb with bone, cooked in a clay pot with dried bean curd.  Very tender pieces of lamb, and the sauce in the claypot was nice over rice.\n\nI probably missed a few dishes, but needless to say, were quite full by the end of the meal.  I would have love a little more time to sit and let the food digest, but there were a few people standing, staring at our table, wondering if we were done.  I wouldn't have paid much attention to them, but we decided to vacate so they could enjoy their holiday dinner with their family.\n\nComfort food at it's best.....", "author": "Steve L."}

Not much pineapple or green pepper and a relatively small portion.\n\nSticky rice had a great presentation being wrapped in lotus leaves. But it was not hot, only warm.

I think they prepared it beforehand, and tried to steam it back up. (A certain lamb dish). Frogs with Vegetables, which I highly recommend. This one was my favorite out of all of them.\n\nFried Rice with Dried Scallop and Egg Whites. This dish was good, I recommend it too. \n\nBaked Salt and Pepper Chicken - I would recommend a HALF chicken for this dish. The chicken smells great and tastes pretty good too, but only in moderation. After a while, the chicken cools and the smell isn't as strong. By then, the chicken just turns dry.\n\nIt was a busy night for these guys so service was a slightly slower than usual. For 1 of our dishes, we had to ask a waiter 20 minutes after the 2nd to last dish came out where that last dish was. It was brought to us immediately after, and the waiter said that they're short 1 cook for the holidays. Oh well... water under the bridge.\n\nIt's not likely that I'll come back here again.

Very good dish, skin was crispy, baked just right, just wish there was more meat on the bird. Next we got the stringy spinach looking vegetable with garlic. Super good would order again. We also ordered the pan fried stuffed tofu. Very good dish I would also order this dish again. We tried to order the sea bass or the rock cod but they didn't have it, so we got the black bass.

The broth is a much more flavorful pork version of the broth you get in pho, with mellow Chinese herbs and even red bean. \n\nEntrees:\n\nStewed pork belly slices with preserved vegetable and iceberg lettuce. The pork belly was incredible, stewed to almost falling apart, and the flavor from the preserved vegetables infused the pork and sauce completely.\n\nFried pumpkin with salt duck egg batter. The \"HOLY MOLY THIS IS FREAKING DELICIOUS\" dish of the evening. If you can imagine the salty goodness from the egg batter paired with the sweetness of the kabocha pumpkin, cut like steak fries and served piping hot....well....I don't need to say any more.\n\nStir-fried lily bulb with woodear fungus, peppers, cucmber and asparagus. Light and flavorful, with all of the vegetables cooked halfway retaining their freshness and snap.\n\nHalf order of the salt baked chicken. This has been talked about thoroughly in other reviews, but what I love about this dish is how simple it seems, but has such difficult components working sublimely and harmoniously. The chicken meat was juicy and tender. The skin was salty/crispy like roast duck skin. The bird used was lean, flavorful and small, reminiscent of wild chicken or yellow feathered chickens. The dipping sauce didn't overpower the flavor of the chicken meat. \n\nStir-fried clams with basil. Aromatic and subtle, the sauce is good over steamed rice, and the clams were super plump. I loved that they used serrano chilis as opposed to the more astringent jalapeno to spice it up.\n\nDessert:\n\nPumpkin pudding with tapioca pearls. Served warm, with a bright orange glow from the pumpkin, we were stuffed, but couldn't let one drop go to waste. Not overtly sweet, and the tapioca was cooked to perfection.\n\nTotal cost: $52 and some change\n\nTakes credit cards. Friday night at 7pm, we didn't have a reservation and were seated immediately.

I liked it fine, but tonight I don't think I can ever go back to it. I didn't know what to expect when I walked into here. Hakka food is more \"homey\" than fancy. This type of food uses a lot of sauces, involves fatty cuts of meat, and incorporates lots of dried oysters (or so I thought, judging from what I've had...and I really don't like dried oysters.)\n\nBUT...this place suited me quite well. It has some serious \"wok hay\" meaning you can taste the intense flavor that a well oiled, well heated wok can impart to food. Our party included a bunch of Hakka people, and I kept hearing people say, \"oh yeah, that is close to what I remember.\"\n\nHere's a run down of what we had. It's a long list and will make us look like pigs, which we are, but we also had a lot of people. Ok...anyhoo, here goes:\n\nPineapple Spareribs - a bit crunchy, not fatty, tangy sweet sauce...pretty good rendition.\n\nBeef Ox Tail - tender, good flavor, almost as good as my mom's. \n\nChinese Bacon w/Preserved Green - I NEVER touch this stuff. I've had it once in a fast food sort of place where they scoop food into a box; it was nasty. But THIS version was pretty good...despite the fatty cut of meat, I really enjoyed the greens and the whole dish, though I gingerly took very little each time (only reached for it twice). The dish just screams \"heart attack!\"\n\nHouse Special Pan Fried Tofu - again, I'm not a fan of stuffed tofu, but I liked this one. It's the silky but firm tofu with a meat center, nicely browned in the pan with a sauce over it.\n\nSalt & Baked Chicken - This is the five spice chicken thing that I mentioned earlier. Light but so flavorful, this chicken is what the Hakka people meant for it to taste like when they invented it. \n\nOyster w/Ginger & Scallion - pan fried to a crisp...eat these oysters with some of the copious amounts of scallion that the chef throws into the wok. \n\nEgg Fu Yong Shrimp - I didn't know Egg Fu Yong was a Hakka tradition. This one was good, but the least of my favorites. \n\nSatay Chicken Diced w/Eggplant - mmmm, yummy sauce...a bit sweet and kept piping hot in its own clay pot. \n\nSauteed Chinese Broccoli w/Rice Wine - a staple in Chinese restaurants....very fresh and stir fried to a crisp.\n\nFor those of you watching your carbs, beware! Hakka cuisine is one of those styles of Chinese cooking that makes you fill your rice bowl way too many times. The sauces are just so yummy that you have to have something to absorb all of them.\n\nAnd yes...we did finish almost all of the food we ordered. Scary but true. Plus two containers of rice. Oh and it was a deal too...$100 for all that food I mentioned. That was enough for nine or ten people.", "author": "Virg Y."}

As a fellow Chinese, I've grown to accept this.  \n\nHakka Restaurant surprised me.  In terms of service and food.  The owner who you'll know immediately since he is the cheeriest, most helpful gentlemen there.  He is ABC so he can interpret very well to non-Chinese speakers.  You can tell he has a passion for his restaurant.  He's very diligent at explaining how dishes are prepared and he makes excellent recommondations. Although the past 2 times I went he rec'd the most popular vs his own real preference.  But even so the popular dishes were good all the same.\n\nI've tried several Chef Specials already.  The salt baked chicken we ordered came out a bit dry.  Don't really care to give it a 2nd try.  The braised pork belly w/ preserved greens was very flavorful.  The fatty layers moistened the pork well and added a richness to the sauce.  House clams are prepared with a Thai twist.  It's cooked with thai basil and chili.  It can get spicy after the 5th clam, but the clams itself are fresh and big!  Most other Chinese restaurants offer clams that aren't worth a chew and smell/taste fishy.  These are solid!\n\nI wanted to test out a \"mediocre\" dish, meaning something that didn't sound special or difficult to make.  So I ordered a very generic sounding pork w/ mushrooms.  They nailed that too!  It was a simple stirfy of sliced pork in a rich gravy sauce with a variety of mushrooms.  I realize they make the sauces here very well... not greasy, doesn't have that corn starch consistency.  And not dousing, over-taking the entire dish.  \n\nAlso do try their Chinese broccoli with rice wine.  They said the rice wine offers a sweet note for the otherwise slightly bitter greens.  Well prepared and just cooked to the point wher the stalks are tender and crunchy at the same time.\n\nGreat value for your money, especially when they offer complimentary soup and dessert (usually a dessert soup).

The chicken was perfectly cooked to a melt-in-mouth texture; there was no blood from uneven cooking nor any bone scraps, evidence of the chef's chopping skills.  The star of the show.\n2) House Soup - Watercress soup served in a small crock.  Tasty and not too salty.\n3) Stir fried Pork stomach with green onion and ginger - My father was the only one who enjoys this dish type (organs).  \n4) Pork Belly with Sweet Mustard greens - Succulent pieces of pork belly on a bed of sweet mustard greens and lettuce; a mix of fatty and lean pieces.\n5) Mixed Mushrooms and Beef - Stir fried fresh button and straw mushrooms with sliced flank steak pieces.\n6) Stir Fried Vegetables - Bok Choy stir fried with ginger; was undercooked so requested kitchen to cook a little longer.\n7) Beef Stew and Radish Clay Pot (added dish) - A mixture of some tendon pieces and mostly beef stew chunks in a bubbling brown gravy.\n8) Sweet Soup - A bright orange house dessert soup.

While immediately revolting, there was something strangely satisfying about their saltiness, paired with the crunch of sweet pumpkin.\nThe Chinese Broccoli in rice wine ($6.95) was pretty standard: crunchy, stem-heavy, chinese broccoli in a thin marinade.  I could actually taste the rice wine, a nice break from the standard garlic on most chinese veggies, and yet, at the end of the day I would have preferred oyster sauce.\nMy favorite of our dishes was the Fish in House Special Sauce ($8.95).  Spicy, strong sauce over herbs, celery (wha?) and tender fish.\nLastly, the Half Salt Baked Chicken was moist, tender and flavorful, but nothing to write home about.\nAs an asian alternative, Hakka Restaurant is a good place to try.  If I'm in the mood for Chinese, however, I'll head to Ton Kiang.", "author": "Laura S."}

My mom reserves 3 tables for my Dad's bday.  Each table fit about 9 people very tightly with no room to move.  The place is small so not really good to accommodate a large party but since it was near my parents house they wanted to go there.  We were served on plastic plates that were square so it didn't work very well on the lazy susan.  We also had to eat off plastic too.  They ordered from the set menu which I didn't think was very good.  The food was either overly salty or bland and greasy.  The fish and the lobster were under cooked.  I cook lobster better and I'm a horrible cook! Not what I would expect from a set menu that cost $368 a table.  We then ordered a couple of vegetable dishes for each table that was about $7 each.  Only 1 person of the 3 tables ordered 1 beer.  Check came with tip on it almost $500 per table!  I was flabbergasted!  The service was slow, we were seated at 7:30 and since it was a set menu my mom ordered ahead of time, there should not have been a wait!  The food didn't come until 8:30 and we didn't leave until 10!   I don't mind paying for good food and service, but for a place that was like a hole in the wall and smelled of it, I don't expect to pay prices like this.", "author": "Marilyn W."}

We ordered the quail braised in a clay pot with mushroom and fungus, which was not as big a portion as pictured (which was good for us), but was very delicious. The quail was moist and the fungus was almost buttery tasting to me. It cost $18, which is a bit on the pricey side to me. We also ordered a veggie dish, which included (more) fungus, snap peas, cucumbers, and lily bulb petals. This dish was refreshing and light, yet not at all bland in taste. \n\nAlso, our meal came with soup (yesterday it was melon+pork bone), and dessert (we had papaya and white fungus dessert soup), both of which were so delicious. So much fungus in everything we ordered! But it's ok, because my mom says the dark fungus is good for lowering cholesterol and the white fungus is good for your skin. \n\nOverall, a nice little find in the Outer Richmond.

Also had the dry fried clams in black beans, garlic & spicy peppers which really was disappointing. The taste was not quite there. Rather flat and a  one note flavor - just salty, and I love salty black beans!!!). There should have been more green onions or other sweetness to balance. We also had the no mai fried in skin whole chicken which was also just okay and actually rather disappointing for the lack of other interesting flavors and super hefty price tag (over $30).  It was missing some good Cha siu, black mushrooms and dried shrimp in enough amounts to be flavorful. The pan fried tofu was good, saucy, pork filled simmering in gravy flavor. The greens with preserved egg was over cooked, mushy, and the egg was rubbery. So sad! Honey walnut shrimp, while succulent, was heavy handed w the mayo sauce and nothing to write home about.

My parents had heard about this place in the newspaper and we wanted to check them out for their grand opening (at least that's what was advertised)\n\nThe restaurant is in a fairly quiet area and and it unusual to find one on the corner of 45th and Cabrillo...We walked in and to our surprise there was a full house.\n\nMy first observation was their inefficiency, but this is to assume that they're new and is still figuring out their process. All the servers were running around frantic...getting in each others way. Service was not to par, but they're trying and that goes a long way.\n\nThe layout was flawed. There were small tables in the corner blocked by 2 large tables. So when the two large tables were occupied , it was nearly impossible to get through to the small table since the walkway was blocked by a person in their chair. The only way was to either ask the person to get up or force your way through. Can you imagine how annoying that is if you're that person blocking the aisle?\n\nWe ordered the usual safe dishes (my family aren't the experimental types). I heard about the fried pumpkin outside and wanted to order it, but the majority ruled it out -_-.\n\nOur server was friendly, we wanted to order soup, but he mutters to us that soup will be provided so you could save money by choosing something else on the menu. A point for his honesty (or was it his ploy to earn more tips?) \n\nThe food was ok.  It wasn't bad at all. My father told me that if they can cook noodles well, then it's a good indication that the chef has skills. (Background: He use to be the chef of his own restaurant) I enjoyed the soy sauce noodles. It was crispy, evenly stir-fried to perfection.\n\nThe prices are around $8-15+ with most dishes averaging $9. Portions are enough, an order of broccoli beef will be decent for a party of 4.\n\nAnother point goes to their dessert. They didn't opt to do the typical Chinese restaurant/Red bean/Green bean/Taro...but offered us sweet pumpkin dessert. Unfortunately, I didn't really like it and it seemed like they added yellow 5 food coloring.\n\nOverall, a surprise to find another decent restaurant out in the outer richmond. No complaints.

Didn't  and still don't know much about Hakka food, but we were hungry and decided to give it a try anyway.  From the look of the menu, they still serve mainly Cantonese food with some Hakka dishes mixed in.  Interestingly. one of our waiters was an ABC but spoke both Cantonese and English well and the other was a native Mandarin speaker who spoke Cantonese and English.not as well. \n\nI was in the mood for jook, so ordered a bowl of pei don gee yuk (preserved duck egg/pork)  jook and the GF ordered the hom yue gee yuk  (dried salted fish/pork) claypot.  Both were pretty good. \n\nThe consistency of the jook was just right (not too thick or runny) and they used lots of pei don and pork.  I was expecting a small portion of shredded pork, but they used big chunks of tender pork instead.  Very nice.  Unfortunately, they don't make yow til (fried bread) to go w/the jook, but that's a minor matter.   Still trying to find another go-to place for jook since the Happy Dragon on Balboa (that IMHO made the BEST  jook) closed.   Hakka's jook didn't come in a clay pot (like it use to be served at Happy Dragon) but it was pipping hot (in fact all of the food was served pipping hot) and was right up there in taste w/Happy Dragon's.  Guess I'll just have to bring my own yow til with me if I want to get my jook-fix in the future.  \n\nThe hom yue/gee yuk clay pot was also served pipping hot filled with minced pieces of salted fish and pork mixed in with soft tofu in an delicious gravy.  The tofu was unexpected, but then we were thinking about Taishan's claypot, which is lined w/rice on the bottom, and not the traditional Cantonese style claypot with rice on the side was very good nonetheless, even though my GF missed the \"fon jew\" (the crispy rice at the bottom of the pot). So, we have to find another place for that too.\n\nWe were still hungry and decided to try to order some \"real\" Hakka dishes.  The waiter recommended the fried pumpkin and hom don (salted egg) dish and the \"special\" Hakka clam dish.  \n\nThe pumpkin dish was ok, but we really couldn't taste the hom don.  The pumpkin is cut into small pieces and then fried.  The hom dom is supposed to be in the coating which I assume was flour or cornstarch w/hom don mixed in, but we just couldn't taste it.  The fried pumpkin was still pretty good and tasted more like yams than pumpkin.  It was a good veggie addition to the meal.  \n\nThe clam dish was stellar.  The sauce was made w/basil and red pepper (not too much) and they used large clams (not the small manila clams).  It was GREAT!  It's on the list of Chef's Specials.\n\nWe wanted to try some other Hakka dishes, but they were not available for lunch.  So, if you want more of a selection try to drop in for dinner instead.  The Taishan Cafe was good, but I think the Hakka Restuarant that has replaced it is even better.  The room is still filled with large banquet tables and there are only a few tables for couples or parties of 4.  So, you may have to wait for a table unless they're willing to use one of the banquet tables as a \"community\" table for smaller parties.", "author": "Martin C."}

I first started going to Hakka several months ago, not long after they hung their yellow Grand Opening sign, which still flies proudly in the front. It's definitely far off the beaten path, as it's in the far Outer Richmond....but well worth the trip.\n\nAs much as I love Chinese food, there's only a few dishes I try regularly. Kung Pao chicken, Mongolian beef and General's (often Cho's) chicken are my so-called test dishes to see if a Chinese restaurant is worth patronizing.  Let me put it to you this way: I ate Hakka's Mongolian beef at least twice a week for the better part of my first month going there, it was THAT good. And only $5.40 for a huge plate of it over rice? Wow! With that quality, great portion size and low price, you've got me as a loyal customer for life!\n\nRecently I've become a huge fan of their Salt & Pepper spare ribs over rice. Again, the amazingly unexpected spicy flavor got me hooked. More basic dishes like Kung Pao chicken are also tasty, but since I'm starting to branch out slowly into Hakka's more traditional regional fare I've been more and more impressed by them.\n\nThe staff has always been very kind & courteous, if at times overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of people that come in at lunch or dinner time. In fact when I come in these days, they smile at me and ask, \"Mongolian beef?\" :) I'd definitely recommend calling ahead for pickup, especially if you're just getting takeout during lunchtime.

Seasoning is minimal (only that which is needed), and heavy sauces are generally not used, which tend to mask the true taste of the ingredients.\n\nThey can accommodate minor adjustments to their dishes if you have a certain preference.\n\n- A generous selection of dishes.  Just about every category is offered, including congee (great for a hot and filling meal) as well as rice plates at only $4.95, a great value. \n\n- The \"3-for-$19.95\" specials are comprised of a large selection of the same high quality.  Note that this special is available for take-out and dine-in Lunch only.\n\n- A variety of set Family Dinners are available, which offer more great values.\n\n(Please view the various menus that I have uploaded for details)\n\nWhile dining in, my experience has been enhanced in that the staff unobtrusively checks often to see if we need anything, and intuitively refill our teapot, replace bowls/plates without even having to signal our needs to anyone.\n\n- Look for Danny or Raymond.  They provide the very best service,  especially in describing the ingredients of a dish, it's preparation, answering any questions, making recommendations and occasionally translating between Chinese and English. \n\nEnthusiastic comments are usually overheard amongst fellow diners offering a variety of the most positive comments about the food as well as the service.\n\nAs a result, I continue to recommend this restaurant to friends, family and many others.\n\nOh a few reminders.  A few items, such as Salt-Baked Chicken,  require extended time in preparation and cooking, so Advance ordering/pre-ordering is required.  Also, reservations are a sure way to avoid having to wait for a table, as this restaurant can get really busy during peak days and/or hours.\n\nGive this place a try.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-10", "description": "I ran across the restaurant by accident. I was looking for parking, which goes to show how serendipity can be such a good thing. Many of the dishes are things that I remember eating growing up since there's a large Hakka population in Taiwan, and therefore the cuisine is prevalent on the island.\n\nThe parking in the area is good, it's a bit out of the way, so, if you want a place to walk around afterwards, you may want to drive back Eastwards a bit.\n\nThe restaurant is decorated like a standard Chinese restaurant. Nothing fancy, but clean and bright. The waitstaff is above average in politeness for a Chinese restaurant, and very efficient.\n\nNow, let's get to the real reason, well, the only reason you'd come here. It's all about the food. The bottom line? Superb. There's little to compare them with in the city, but, that's in their favor. \n\nLet's start with the much-yelped-about salt baked chicken. We ordered it ahead of time, based on the reviews, which was a very good suggestion. It came with everything else. Also, since we were only two, they suggested getting a half chicken. Good call, since at a restaurant like this, you want to try as many things as possible, and not fill up on one thing. Overall, it was good. However, didn't turn out to be my favorite, and didn't quite live up to my expectations. A table nearby had the steamed chicken, which is also a hakka favorite. Note to self to get that next time.\n\nChinese Bacon w/Preserved Greens - perfect! A word of warning, you cannot be afraid of pork fat. It is about the most unhealthy thing to eat. However, my relatives eat fatty pork all the time, and I have a theory that as long as you aren't eating a lot, and are eating a lot of veggies, all is good. Well, that is what I tell myself. Which brings me to some veggies.\n\nChinese Broccoli in rice wine - perfect! Usually you get it with oyster sauce in many restaurants. However, that's usually goopy and too sweet. The rice wine infuses it with a more subtle flavor. It comes cooked bright green, and delicious.\n\nFried pumpkin with salt duck egg batter - this seemed to steal the show. It's all deep fried, but remarkably not greasy, and the salt-duck egg is sprinkled about. Very nice.\n\nThen there was a shrimp and squid dish that was good. Can't remember the specifics other than the squid was so tender. Amazing.\n\nSoup is complimentary (we could have loaded up on the soup alone).  Savory broth with bean. (which isn't common at most chinese restaurants in the city) We were sad when they took away the bowl to make room for the food. Noooo. :-)\n\nDidn't get dessert since as you can read above, we were stuffed.\n\nit's definitely the kind of place you want to bring a big group. Beer and Wine license application done. You can BYOB. \n\nFood is a window into a culture. In many ways, Chinese food ends up being a reflection of where it is at. Chinese food in New York is different than Chinese food in California is different than Chinese food in Sweden is different than Chinese food in India. Those adaptations are beautiful despite being \"inauthentic\" simply because they too have a history behind them. However, it's also nice to find the food that is as it is in the place of origin (or close, since my Grandfather complains that American chickens don't taste the same as Chinese chickens), and Hakka Restaurant is an excellent window into a place half a world away.", "author": "Boris C."}

So don't eat here. Promise me. \n\nBut I do have give props to Hakka Restaurant. I found out I am part Hakka in my twenties. Hakka people are the Chinese version of Gypsies, always being driven from place to place, with hardly a region in China to truly call home. And so it might have been why they've learned to make dishes out of some of the least favored ingredients. And I'd say they've perfected the art of cooking these otherwise unpalatable things. Pork belly and preserved vegetables. To die for!\n\nHakka Restaurant is described by many of my Chinese and non-Chinese friends as the best Chinese restaurant in San Francisco. I agree! The servers are nice, the restaurant seems clean, and the dishes are marvelous. Avoid the typical Chinese-American fare. Bring a friend who can read Chinese so they can order from the wall. That's where they advertise the good stuff. And I highly recommend the chicken stuffed with preserved veggies...but you have to call a day ahead to order it. The fish dishes are awesome. \n\nBut don't eat here. Don't make me wait in line.", "author": "Jason J."}

I am a Hakka-nese so I think I'm some what qualified to say that it's not completely authentic but close. Authenticity aside, when it comes to taste, trust the professionals. \n\nTonight we brought 6 seniors relatives along, including 2 line cooks with 30 years of experiences combined and a 40 years experienced home-chef!\n\nOrdered 8 courses:\n\n- Fried crab with pumpkin and salted duck egg yolk. Everyone dug in with both hands. The best in the Bay Area. The crab is a bit small, less than 2 pounds. So they comp it with extra pumpkin strips. Loved it!\n- House special steamed chicken. Served as an cold app with 2 sauces. All chefs thought it's great. Nit picking: they used food coloring on the skin.\n- Honey BBQ short ribs. Super tender and very rich in the unique favor of a super hot work (wok-hey).\n- Chinese bacon with preserved green. Different than the Northern Chinese style. Less fatty and less salty. \n- House special pan fried tofu. The last time was better but still not bad.\n- House special clams. Essentially, wet fried clams in basil and garlic sauce. Great basil taste! Perfect to go down with white rice. \n- Cat fish in clay pot. Nice texture with sweet sauce. Lots of scallions.\n- Sauteed Chinese broccoli with rice wine. Last but not lease!\n\n\nComments from our guest:\n\nCook A ...\n- Short ribs. His wife just can't make it in such quality.\n- Tofu. A hint of dried fish in the mix of the meat but not to his taste.\nConclusion: Overall, he enjoyed it very much.\n\nCook B...\n- Bacon with preserved green. Different than the usual and he thought the preserved green is very tasty.\n- Cat fish. He couldn't stop eating the scallions.\n\nHome-chef...\n- Pumpkin. She wanted more and more of it.\n- The comp soup. Unique and not lacking of ingredients like other house soup.\n- Tofu. I'm sure she can make it better.\n\nThe girlfriend...\n- Cat fish. Never had cat fish clay pot as good.\n\nEVERYONE...\n- The crab is GREAT! Hands down!\n- The chicken dish is something you can hardly find in the Bay Area.\n\n\nIn Chinese, it's considered to be impolite to criticize the dishes when you're not the one who's paying the bill. At the end of the meal tonight, everyone was trying to pick their least favorite. That's because we all thought everything was great and we need to \"give face\" to the home-chef by saying that she can make a better tofu dish at home ;)", "author": "Rio T."}

Unfortunately, my search will continue because this place did not satisfy. \n\nWe ordered the salt baked chicken, pumpkin strips, and a few other dishes...Question: why do so many SF Chinese restaurants go heavy on the salt and oil and portions at the expense of flavor and authenticity? And why do people think this is an attractive thing? \n\nDoesn't help that as we were walking to the place, I saw the chef smoking on the greasy sidewalk, with the kitchen door propped open (boxes of food visible on the kitchen floor) and then saw him cooking our food a few minutes later. I love a good hole in the wall and can handle questionable hygiene but the look of this place's kitchen and building, the so-so food, and the line of cars and aggressive customers waiting outside to pick up orders are all good reasons not to return.

So, we got Hakka's famous kau yuk and pitted it against 2 other competitors kau yuk (Jumbo's & 8 Immortals - all in SF).\n\nWe marked all these 1,2 & 3 - had over 12 of us all tasted it. Over all we had 8 votes for #1, 3 for #2, and only 1 for #3.

If you're a large party and don't have reservations, please don't come here. My party was for 10 people. They plan for the exact time and hope you're all there when you're going to be seated. While waiting for the table watching people walk around it was like this place was chaos. Now for the review.\n\nI had a family dinner here last Friday. We had made reservations which helped. We were seated by the door. That wasn't too bad even though it was a cooler day. We practically had to flag down the waiter to take our order. We tried to flag down any waiter to check on our order and that was pretty much impossible. One of the waiters was pretty nice and brought us stuff after he set down the food. We ordered the $168 set menu and added a couple of dishes. When we were waiting for our food, we asked about one of the add on dishes. We never got an answer and finally when we did it came. It seemed like those that ordered off the menu instead of a set menu got their food faster. \n\nOverall the food at times seemed like it would be a couple of dishes and then all of them at once. The food was OK in my opinion. Nothing special. After we finally finished dinner we told the waiter that the one dish was kind of bad. It looked good, but the vegetable wasn't that great. The waiter explained if we told them earlier they would remake the dish. At that point we were ready to pay the bill and leave. \n\nYou wouldn't think this restaurant had a upstairs, but it does. The crowd died down after about 8.00pm. There seems to be this rush to eat at a certain time and then it's empty and silent at about 9.00pm. This place isn't in an area with a lot of restaurants and if you didn't know it was here you probably wouldn't go here. \n\nWould I come here again? Probably not.", "author": "Jen C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-04-19", "description": "Chinese restaurants tend to be inconsistent when service and quality of food is considered. Usually, the reason is because of over-worked waiting staff and under-appreciated cooks. For this reason, I prefer to avoid rating Chinese restaurants, but this one was deserving some good praise from unexpected surprises.\n\nOne big thing that stood out is the service. Under the usual Chinese restaurant norm, you get the basic service of refilling tea pots, clearing plates and ordering food. I think this place took an extra step by taking the initiative to make sure everything is okay, conversing with you and making sure everything that needs to be filled is filled. Now it could be the fact that we were there earlier than the main dinner crowd, so they had time, but these guys are friendly regardless.\n\nThe food itself was well made. We got the Yong Tau Foo (Something tofu...), Ginger and Onion Crab, Muy Choi Kao Yok (Braised Pork?), Garlic Stir-fried Kailan and some sort of Spicy Eggplant. The pork is something I would recommend! My mom makes it a certain way where the pork is diced, but the way they did it was sliced. All I can say is try it! \n\nAgain, low rating because it might not say great for long. The food is great, but that's only if the cooks are consistently working there and not planning to switch jobs. I would still recommend you to give it a shot especially the Muy Choi Kao Yok.", "author": "Jeremy L."}

Food tasted good but nothing to rave about.  Price is quite affordable.  It is basically your everyday type of food.  I will still come back to try their specialty dish though.  If you are hungry and want some good food, this is one of the great place to visit.  I just didn't care for the tofu pork with salted fish as much I wanted but I am a big critic because I have tasted the best salted fish ever and nothing can compare to it (because salted fish from Raiatea (French Polynesia) are the best).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-03-25", "description": "We went last weekend for dinner and thoroughly enjoy our meal.   What we ordered:\n\n- salt baked chicken.  This was a bit of disappointment for us since we had such high hopes.  We did like the chicken itself, which was tasty, with fresh and tender chicken.  However, the flavor is far more muted than what authentic \"Dong Jiang salt baked chicken\" taste like.\n\n- pork belly with preserved cabbage.  Very good rendition of the dish, with top quality pork belly and excellent execution.  The result is melting, succulent, flavorful chunks of pork.  The preserved cabbage, which is tender and flavorful without tasting like wet paper as is usually the case, is just as good.\n\n- braised tofu.  This is a simple braised tofu dish that can be found in every cantonese restaurant, but the execution here is above average.  Fresh tofu and snap peas without globs of sauce overpowering the ingredients. \n\n- Deep fried pumpkin with salted egg.  This was a pleasant surprise as we were originally going to cancel this dish.  The waiter suggest that we give it a shot and we loved it.  The pumpkins are cut into small carrot stick sizes, fried in a batter sprinkled with salted egg yoke.  The sweetness of the pumpkin is amazing with the savory batter.  Not sure if this is the chef's creation or a new trend in chinese restaurants.  But either way, it's a winner.  The waiter also told us at the end of the meal that this was one of the most popular dishes at the restaurant. \n\n- Salt and pepper spare ribs.  Very forgettable rendition of a popular dish in chinese restaurant.  Though it was not bad, compare to the quality of other dishes, it's not worth mentioning.  Won't be ordering this again. \n\n- XO sauce fried rice.  Very flavorful fried rice, not a bad deal by itself.\n\nAt the beginning of the dinner, we were served a soup with snow ear and a porky, clear broth.  At the end of the meal, we were served a sweet dessert soup with pumpkin.  Both were complimentary of the meal.   I think there was also a 10% Grand Opening discount, which is plastered on the front window.  Though I didn't check my bill carefully enough to see if we got it. \n\nOverall, we would definitely go back.  For the price, Hakka is by far the best Chinese in the Bay Area I have had.  Just judging by the quality of the food, it would still easily rank in top 3 Bay Area chinese restaurant on my list.", "author": "Leon W."}

I wouldn't make a special trip out to the boonies to eat here again (although I would like to go back with a big group to try more items) but if I was in the nabe, I'd eat here again. There were just two of us and this is what we ordered. \n\nPUMPKIN STRIPS WITH SALTY  EGG: They have pictures of a lot of their dishes on the wall and menu and this looked deep fried (thus, delish). I didn't know what the salty egg business was about but it turns out the egg yolk is sprinkled on the pumpkin strips after (?) they are deep fried. The pumpkin strips were nice and tender but the coating seemed like it could have been crisper. Maybe the oil wasn't hot enough or something but the exterior wasn't as crunchy as I wanted it to be. Also, the egg yolk adds a weirdly subtle smell as you bring the pumpkin strip to your nose. It smells vaguely of crotch. We had just gone running and I kept thinking I was smelling my own armpits or something everytime I lifted my chopsticks up to my mouth. Don't be afraid of it though, surprisingly, the whiff of dirty crotch adds a complexity to the flavor that is kind of interesting. Who knew...crotch is umami.\n\nCHINESE BACON WITH PRESERVED VEGGIES: This is big slabs of pork belly on a bed of finely minced brown veggies. I'm not wild about the preserved veggies but didn't hate it either. I enjoy fatty pork belly so I liked this dish but I feel like I've had better versions of this.\n\nOYSTERS IN BLACK BEAN SAUCE: Giant plump oysters with your standard veggies (bell peppers in various colors and onions). I enjoyed this dish a lot. A little on the greasy side, but nice flavor and nice plump fresh tasting oysters. \n\nWe also ordered one orange soda and steamed rice and I think the bill came to $33--so $40 including tip. The service was fine. Your basic Chinese restaurant casual/indifferent. The patrons eating there were all Asian when we were there. Would be interested to return and try more Hakkanese dishes and just a greater variety of dishes.", "author": "meehee o."}

My family got the $128 Family Dinner Set Menu and everything was good, also ordered a few extra dishes on top of it. I'm not going to go down the list but you can see my photos. Let me tell you my favorites and least favorites instead. Favorites: Fried Tofu/Eggplant bites so good!, Crab yum!, Blackbean steamed catfish this was one of the best I've had, shortribs were so flavorfu but some pieces were a little tough. Meh dishes: The Tapioca Taro Dessert at the end, wow lets talk cheap! this stuff tasted straight up like water because they tried to make more by adding more water and cornstarch, YUCK! The famous salty chicken, not that great and it's a tiny little chicken which I didn't mind since chickens shouldn't be huge and plump naturally. Honey pepper oysters, don't do it not all that.

Everything we ordered came out hot and delicious! For 8 people, we paid around $80 for 7 dishes. Here were the most memorable dishes:\n\n-Fried Kabocha Squash (Pumpkin) with Salted Egg Batter\nSo delicious! Their salted egg batter was not too salty and went with the sweetness of the squash so well! It stayed crispy from the first to the last piece. This must be tried if you like salted egg!\n\n-Stewed Pork Belly with Lettuce\nIf you like this dish, you must try Hakka Restaurant's version! I've eaten this at quite a few restaurants, and HR's is one of the best! The pork is super tender, with a certain sweetness that not all restaurants can get right.\n\n-Some kind of sliced tofu cooked with pork meatballs on top with brown sauce\nThis was good. The meatball was very tender and the sauce had pieces of salted dried fish in it. I like salted dried fish, so I liked it a lot. But not everyone likes it.\n\nDessert was on the house and was a sweet soup made from kabocha squash and tapioca. To the reviewer who asserted that this soup must have food coloring because it was so yellow: do you even know what kabocha squash is? There's no need to add any food coloring!  \n\nEverything was so good I definitely want to go back! I have to laugh when I see all the 100 something reviews of the Hunan Cafe place across the street from this place.

First I tried to eat at To Hyang, but they were closed Mondays. Next I tried to eat at Namu, but they turned the music way up as I was sitting there waiting to order. So I hopped back onto Muni and shlepped all the way out to 45th and Cabrillo and landed in the land of the Hakka. Restaurant, that is.\n\nThe first floor was jammed, with only one table available, and it was right by the kitchen entrance. Oh, well, I thought, I came all this way. I entered and asked for a table for one. They said I could sit there or go upstairs. Ah, they have an upstairs. So we went upstairs and I got a table.\n\nI specifically said I wanted to try some Hakka dishes and the waiter helpfully described some dishes to me. I decided on the fried squash with salted eggs and a half salt-baked chicken. (The waiter said their salt-baked chicken actually was salt-baked; apparently some other places take a shortcut of steaming.) \n\nI ordered the chicken in Cantonese (wasn't sure if I could use that, after all it's Hakka Restaurant, not Cantonese Restaurant, but apparently they do speak Cantonese there). As a reward, I got the long-cooked soup of the day, watercress in a pork-bone broth. It was yummy.\n\nThen the squash arrived and it was yummy and slightly crunchy and just a bit salty. And the salt-baked chicken arrived and the flesh was tender and tasty and definitely yummy and not excessively salty.\n\nBut apparently my speaking Cantonese wasn't enough as I got the fortune cookie for the Westerner instead of the dessert soup. Oh well. (In all fairness, I rarely get rewarded with the tong seui dessert soup no matter how much Cantonese I use. Not sure what the secret is to Westerners getting the tong seui. Or maybe I have to remember not to show off my Cantonese by saying \"sik baau laak\" (I'm full). Maybe I'm full=no tong seui.)\n\nAnyway, the service was friendly and quick and the food was consistently yummy. I'd definitely make the trek again as well as bring friends here.\n\nJust so you know, the salt-baked chicken is served cold, chopped with the bones in and has the head on. If you get the half salt-baked chicken, you get half a head. Not sure why, since the idea of having the head is to have the whole chicken, but if you halve the whole chicken, it's no longer whole. But anyway, I have now eaten Chicken brain. Or half a chicken brain. The half-portion is also smaller than their other entree dishes, but it's still a decent portion of both light and dark meat.\n\nI like frog so will have to come back and try the frog dishes.", "author": "Charles B."}

My friend ordered the filet lunch special rice plate and it was better than my pork stomach dish, it looked very fresh with fresh greens and white fresh fish, so that was a good deal for that dish.  A good restaurant in the outer richmond", "author": "John L."}

I am a fan of the special seafood noodles with red chili flakes and basil, and the pumpkin strips.  Yes, it's a trek to the Outer Richmond, but there's some serious good eats out there people!  I'd dare to say that district is the city's best kept secret.", "author": "Steve J."}

The place looks kind of sketchy from the outside since it seems to be in the middle of a residential area but when we walked it, it was pretty packed. Luckily they have a second story where they sat us down right away. We ended up getting the half salt baked chicken, house special tofu, the pork belly (it's called chinese bacon on the menu), and the salt and pepper pork chops. The food seemed normal and pretty ehhh. The half chicken seemed kind of expensive for around $12 from what I remember and it just tasted normal. The soup they brought out to us was complimentary but that tasted ehh as well. We all took a vote at the table and basically agreed we would give this place two stars and it kind of describes the place perfectly: \"meh. i've experienced better.\" San Francisco has so many restaurants to choose from and I'm pretty sure we will never be going back here due to the food being nothing special.", "author": "Richard H."}

This is some of the best Hakka cuisine in the city and southern Chinese cooking is my first love.!  I love the nice interior with friendly service and lots of Chinese patrons alike.  The pot stickers are crispy golden and not doughy with a wonderful ground pork, cabbage, and ginger filling; perfect with a little soy sauce.  The beef stew with turnips in clay pot is excellent with tender brisquette marinaded in five spices with fresh turnips; granted there are some fatty pieces in which you have to carefully chew or take off the meat which ever comes first, but it is well worth it.  The house special seafood yee noodles are sublime with fresh prawns, fish, and squid in  an xo sauce that just the right kick; the noodles are just right and not gummy.!  The steamed rice is firm not soggy.  The complimentary pork and vegetable soup is excellent with tender pork and free vegetables in a lightly seasoned broth.  The red bean soup is a perfect way to end the meal and is naturally sweet, not overpowering.!  The tea is perfectly brewed and flavored.  So, for excellent Hakka cuisine at reasonable prices with friendly service in a clean atmosphere, Hakka cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}
